00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,840
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,
we're here with Lisa [inaudible] and Joe

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,480
Diaz.
My name's Joe Rogan and I host a podcast

3
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:09,280
called the experience.
Dude.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,620
Uh,
this poster you just brought me in,

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,860
Joey Diaz was just brought me in one of
the dopest fucking things I've ever seen

6
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:16,610
in my life.
It is a,

7
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:19,600
a poster with Leonard scattered and the
rolling stones.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,910
And we were talking about this on the
way in here.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,850
Knebworth festival from 1976 America's
confederate rockers,

10
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:31,480
Leonard Skinner.
And then underneath it it says along

11
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:34,000
with the best rock and roll band in the
world,

12
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,670
Britain zone,
rolling stones.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,660
Who is kind of weird cause you've got
one band that's the headliner there,

14
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,700
the biggest picture.
And then it says the other bands,

15
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,050
the best band in the world.
No.

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,450
Okay.

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:45,721
Oh,
hi.

18
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:46,680
Oh wait,
no,

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,790
no,
no.

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,970
They had no fucking idea this but power
that these guys were bringing over that

21
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,530
bill on the road,
opening up the ted.

22
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,790
Ted was a powerhouse and 76 Ted
nugent's.

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,100
Oh,
cat scratch fever,

24
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,120
you know,
freefall.

25
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,820
Yeah,
cat scratch fever and then the live out

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,530
can go home.
Stranglehold.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,070
Nobody was messing with.
Dave was hunting.

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,070
He was eating what he haunted.
Nobody in heard these things.

29
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,440
He was hunting with some shitty ass
equipment too.

30
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,120
They had like old school archery bows
back then like recurves and like real

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,240
shitty compound bows.
Did he have like the whole compound then

32
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:29,241
with like the animals and like the
family has had property in Michigan for,

33
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,910
he's got a couple of places.
He's got one place in Florida and he's

34
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:37,230
got one place in Michigan and they're
both like these gigantic private hunting

35
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,064
grounds.

36
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,130
He just took,
he didn't do any coke.

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,440
He just took all his money and he bought
a,

38
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,900
you know,
just a giant chunk of land and then he's

39
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,790
got one in Texas now.
No booze,

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,380
no cigarettes,
no nothing.

41
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,060
You could do any of that.
He doesn't have no worry at all.

42
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,720
No,
no,

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,250
no.
I think he drinks a little one.

44
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,630
He's fucking crazy.
But it's like when those guys tried to

45
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,360
debate him,
like do you ever see a ted nugent versus

46
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:01,750
a Pierce Morgan?
No.

47
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,970
On gun control?
No.

48
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,690
He led them up like a Christmas tree
because Pierce Morgan didn't have all

49
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,570
piers Morgan is like,
you know,

50
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,050
he,
he's a proper sounding British guy.

51
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,870
But like when it gets to the fucking red
line,

52
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,990
when it gets the red line of arguments,
he falls apart.

53
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,530
Like Ben Shapiro ate him up and Ted
nugent ate him up.

54
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,590
A lot of the conservative guys that are
like really slick,

55
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:28,050
smooth talkers,
they can eat them up when they get into

56
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:32,850
the really like the high revs of the
conversation because he didn't

57
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:36,750
understand that a lot of the gun deaths
is also bad guys that are shot by guns.

58
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,180
Like people that are shot by cops.
Like all that stuff is sort of

59
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:41,670
calculated it in like he didn't
understand,

60
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:44,630
he didn't have all those facts in order.
So you,

61
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,400
if you're arguing with a guy like Nugen
who does these kind of arguments with

62
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:52,140
people like gun control arguments,
he's got like his words down to a tee.

63
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,350
He's done a couple of these.
Did one of them in a gun store?

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,360
They were in a gun store.
Yeah,

65
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,410
sure.
Go ahead please on it.

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,580
It's hilarious.

67
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,330
I'm not rock and roll stage.
I just saw sang a song about waist deep.

68
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,080
I mean,
you gotta be kidding me on a rocky.

69
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,490
Do you ever see Richard Pryor life?
I want Sam kinison.

70
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,500
How about Lenny Bruce?
I one of them.

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,100
Get over it.
That's some funny for a man who is a,

72
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,520
who is a patriot,
who purports to love his country.

73
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,990
That was quite shocking.
Disrespecting me.

74
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,590
Put it in a official CNN.
Piers Morgan.

75
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,760
Yes.
Yes.

76
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,180
Anybody that wants to disarm me can drop
dead.

77
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,680
Anybody that wants to make the unarmed
and helpless people that want to

78
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:40,681
literally create the proven places were
more innocence or killed called gun free

79
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:44,220
zones.
We're going to beat you there.

80
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,750
No vote you out of office or suck on my
machine is,

81
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,150
but you can take it,
whichever is,

82
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,320
I'd love to suck on your machine gun.
The whole point,

83
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:54,520
the whole point of your defense is that
a lot of people do drop dead precisely

84
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,560
because you are armed to the teeth.

85
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,790
You like everybody else to be not true.
Write this down.

86
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,390
See your soul.
You write this stuff.

87
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,480
80 people a day die in America from gun
shows,

88
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:10,481
75 of them to 78 of them statistics by
the uniform crime report by the FBI and

89
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:13,180
the UN and the UN study on violent
crime.

90
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,420
78 of those 80 are let out of their
cages by corrupt judges and prosecutors

91
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,120
who know the recidivism,
exotic control,

92
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,540
no that the commit the crimes again and
they let them walk through plea

93
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,880
bargaining,
early release and program.

94
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,140
They still just my ass.
Where you have the most firearms

95
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,270
citizens in America,
you have and lowest violent crime rate

96
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,970
where you have the hi the worst gun
control.

97
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,210
You had the highest crime rate peers
choose one.

98
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,250
Do you want a lot of crime?
We have it.

99
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,500
Gun Free Zones.
You want less crime?

100
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,140
We have that more people with concealed
weapons permit.

101
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,890
Why do you guys resists that?
Statistic is a you guys,

102
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,650
you guys are nuts.
You're playing the devil's advocate and

103
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,020
I can play any advocate.
I like my side job,

104
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,910
right?
You're playing the idiots advocates.

105
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,680
More guns equals less crime.
You'll area let me,

106
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,790
unless I'm wrong and not doing well,
the couch,

107
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,400
be sure to let you know acid at this
point if you don't mind.

108
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,500
Um,
and there's something wrong with your

109
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,350
argument,
but you'll basically saying that 90% of

110
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:14,530
the gun crime comes from people let
other 96%.

111
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,050
Right,
but they still have to get access to

112
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,000
firearms.
If you had your way,

113
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,730
they would be 10 times as many firearms,
right?

114
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,410
Not True.
Or you want everyone in America to want

115
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,610
to go?
Not at all.

116
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,090
I've never said,
I got to tell you what is your position

117
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,770
and I hope you don't edit this out.
Whenever I've done interviews with guys

118
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:36,970
that are inclined to be anti gun,
they always go,

119
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,590
well,
I knew you wants everybody to have a

120
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:41,800
machine gun nugent.
Watch all the dear dad,

121
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,560
what does Nugeo not even close.
You want,

122
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,650
what I want is the second amendment.
We the people free individuals to have

123
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,330
the right to keep and bear arms for self
defense.

124
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,160
Find Fault with that.
Some down.

125
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,240
It's too good at that shit.

126
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,310
Did the,
the argument is just too weird.

127
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,350
It's just a weird argument.
I see both sides of it.

128
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:03,970
If nobody had guns,
if there's no guns,

129
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,370
nobody getting shot.
But I think people would be like my

130
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:09,250
shitty and people more and shit.
They do something,

131
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,170
they do something.
So they're your,

132
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:15,970
they're saying 75 out of 80 gun deaths
or criminals and bad people.

133
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:17,530
I don't know what the real numbers are,
you know,

134
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:18,880
but that's what he was saying in that
argument.

135
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:20,200
He was saying something along those
lines.

136
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah.
The people that guide,

137
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,250
when we talk about people that dine gun
deaths,

138
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,740
a lot of the people that die in gun
deaths are cons.

139
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,660
Ex Cons.
People out of jail,

140
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:30,910
people have already committed violent
crimes in her life,

141
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,880
which makes sense.
Most of the violence shit's going to be

142
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:35,740
happening by people with a history of
violence.

143
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,870
Well,
it's crazy.

144
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,670
The penalty you get for like,
uh,

145
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,740
uh,
ex felon with a gun,

146
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,180
like Gucci Mane just get out after two
years is I like,

147
00:06:43,181 --> 00:06:46,030
I had been in print,
like you can go to prison for like seven

148
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,630
years.
Like there's a guy who said he's Prince,

149
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:50,020
his son,
he's in prison for seven years and he

150
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:52,030
had,
it was a felon in possession of a

151
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:53,620
handgun.
Let me ask you this,

152
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,250
when it's a guy like Gucci Mane,
who's a big time public character,

153
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,540
right?
He's a famous guy,

154
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,580
right?
Cause ice cream tattooed on his face.

155
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:02,830
He's fucking crazy.
Right?

156
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:04,870
When a guy like Gucci gets caught for
something like that,

157
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,640
do you think they make an example out of
him?

158
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,740
They do you think that they take that
guy?

159
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,880
Yeah.
You already have that law to whatever

160
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,970
law that if you get caught with a
firearm,

161
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,450
you do two years just period period.
I don't know exactly what the parameters

162
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:22,200
of the law,
the Brady law as something you do two

163
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:23,700
years,
you don't even go to court.

164
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,150
It's two years automatically if you get
caught with a gun without a permit.

165
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:30,100
I don't know exactly the parameters.
Uh,

166
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,320
you know,
does that keep people from doing crimes?

167
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,470
What's that?
That two years that carrying a gun for

168
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,200
two years in New York?
Yes and no.

169
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,310
Yes and no.
Right?

170
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,980
Yes and no.
Some people carry a gun and all of a

171
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:44,731
sudden they go,
you know what?

172
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,250
I'm not going to say what I do for a
living,

173
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,440
whatever.
I don't know.

174
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:48,870
I,
you know,

175
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,610
it's like a,
you're saying Gucci Man Right now.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,580
He's a high profile guy.
You know,

177
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,900
you're out at night.

178
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,900
You see some crazy shit at night.
There's times I'm driving after one.

179
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,570
I'm like,
I should've carried a fucking gun

180
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:01,620
tonight.
You know,

181
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:04,200
just in case.
Just in case you never know.

182
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,090
I don't know if,
look,

183
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:09,450
we were just talking about when you came
in about Denver and taxes,

184
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,040
like the make my day law.
I know people have moved to Colorado for

185
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:17,040
that law.
You know what that Youtube,

186
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,160
did you ever see,
you ever see the video of Sonny Liston

187
00:08:20,161 --> 00:08:23,420
pulling a gun?
Ever seen that before?

188
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,540
Never before.
No.

189
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:24,811
No.
What?

190
00:08:24,811 --> 00:08:26,340
I mean,
40 only told me about it.

191
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,480
Yeah.
Hinchcliffe told me.

192
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:27,880
Yeah,

193
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,750
we were at the ice house and I was like,
you gotta be kidding me.

194
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:33,560
There's a video of this play that play
both of them.

195
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,920
Not one that maybe we can just place.
I want to hear the redneck.

196
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,820
He was apparently like screaming shit at
Ali everywhere he went and Sonny Liston

197
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,440
was just tired of this bullshit.

198
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,510
The whole situation finally came a head
and clay approach listing at the desert

199
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:02,190
in Las Vegas where the champ was
shooting craps and lanes and he got up

200
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:05,550
with Liston was in no mood to be
harangued by the mouth from the south

201
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,910
drawing the gun.
Sunny fires frightened who's young

202
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:10,590
tormentor into a hasty retreat.

203
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,150
The gun was filled with blanks.
Holy.

204
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,810
Come on son.
That is one of the craziest things ever

205
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,770
going to see in your life.
Who pulled a gun out on Ali

206
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,020
in the middle of the casino,
shot at in the air and then said,

207
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:29,860
look,
it's just blanks.

208
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,230
No big deal.
Wanting to go back to his crap game

209
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,331
like,
dude,

210
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:36,520
what kind of environment that that dude
grow up in?

211
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,570
I used to know a lot of people never
carry fucking startup pissed has his

212
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:45,571
shit and the 70s just to get the father
would carry those type of pistols cause

213
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:48,700
you never know.
But what happens if the other guy has a

214
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,190
real one venue,
then you're fucked.

215
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,360
You're fucked,
then you're fucked.

216
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,510
But that sonny liston thing was so
crazy,

217
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,210
first of all,
how casually he did that.

218
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,440
He did so casually,
and then how he shot his jacket to let

219
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:03,700
everybody knows just blanks.
Like,

220
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:04,660
come on,
relax.

221
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,330
Like no big deal.
Let's just go back to the game.

222
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,250
Right?
Like he just went back to the game.

223
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,350
He didn't go.
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here right

224
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:14,200
now for TMZ shows up dog.
And let me say something.

225
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:17,230
They'll be runs quicker when they hear
gunshots to black people,

226
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,730
they fucking,
they react,

227
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:19,860
they react.
Exactly.

228
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,290
Know what time it is and they have
fucking that shit look on.

229
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,790
He just shoots it in the end.
They all run out.

230
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,910
It just shows you like,
I'll leave.

231
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:28,744
It's so crazy.

232
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,260
But then Denali should have gone at
frazier in Africa,

233
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,020
titty,
somebody shot somebody in Africa,

234
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:43,570
not shot,
but pulled up to the hotel with have got

235
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:47,830
an Africa.
Whether it was a foreman or Frasier,

236
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:50,560
somebody.
When holly was in his hotel room,

237
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:52,230
they went over.
It was frazier.

238
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,880
What is that phrase?
You went over there with a gun and

239
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:59,881
pointed it up at the building and shit.
Either or or something crazy like,

240
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:02,660
God,
these are just pulling guns on each

241
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,440
other back.
People aren't ready for Ali in the 60s

242
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:07,270
when he's not playing with you have like
that.

243
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,150
They just weren't ready for him.
He would just look at him.

244
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:11,620
He's still tormenting him.
A casino.

245
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,340
Super metal number.
The casino megaphone out of the bus

246
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,290
window.
Yeah,

247
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,450
exactly.
And that was in front of his house.

248
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,730
You pulled up on his lawn?
Yeah,

249
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:22,270
he told him,
man,

250
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,640
that's what he was doing.
The bus.

251
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,830
They'd like champ that bad in the world
or something crazy.

252
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,850
I know.
Like I'm telling you,

253
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:34,210
man.
I think Mcgregor takes it to a very high

254
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,430
level,
but you got to go back and look at the

255
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:39,850
old Ali stuff.
Maybe sometimes I forgot how good it was

256
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:41,650
because nobody had been like that before
him.

257
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,160
He showed up at the gorilla face.
Joe Frazier,

258
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,710
what does it say?
The most colorful fighter?

259
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,790
World's most colorful.
Cassius clay.

260
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,280
The world's most colorful,
and this was back

261
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,040
before he'd even change his name,
Cassius clay.

262
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,290
Wow.
It's crazy,

263
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,540
man.
It's crazy that that was in our parent's

264
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:06,541
lifetime and it seems like a different
world when your parents left them.

265
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:12,040
I'm an old man though,
before Asia.

266
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:16,810
I do remember being a little kid going
home to living in New York City.

267
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,330
What year was that?
What year was I'm Sonny Liston.

268
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,920
I want to say that was when I was a
baby.

269
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,300
Like I was 67 like it's 1967 or
something.

270
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,450
I don't know.
When did you win the title?

271
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,820
What year was it when he beats all he
listing?

272
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,163
Yeah,
I'll slightly,

273
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,260
it was fucking crazy.
They didn't even know how old he really

274
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:38,681
was.
No,

275
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,220
no one knew how fucking 90 30.
It's like a Cuban dude.

276
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,760
Their first fight was in 64 seconds.
65 64.

277
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:49,330
So I wasn't even born yet.
So it was three years before I was born.

278
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,400
And um,
that was a different world,

279
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:52,660
man.
It's a different world.

280
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,890
You watching that video,
you're like,

281
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:57,430
wow.
Like America was just a different place.

282
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,150
So when Cassius clay was fighting,
all of the country would just stop.

283
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,120
Like everyone went in everywhere would
just watch the fight.

284
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,190
Well,
I remember when I was a kid,

285
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,580
I was um,
living in San Francisco and my parents

286
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,830
went,
we went way out of our way to make sure

287
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:15,190
that we watch tv because Sonny Liston
and Muhammad Ali,

288
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:17,920
and not sounding less than I'm Leon
spinks in Muhammad Ali were having the

289
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:22,921
rematch and the rematch was a big thing
to everybody because Muhammad Ali was

290
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,400
such a hero.
He was so much more than just a fighter.

291
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,880
Especially then because he had gone over
the three years,

292
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:33,460
have not fought because he didn't want
to go to Vietnam.

293
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,960
What year was that,
Leon to and Mama Alley is in the early

294
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,540
seventies,
I want to say.

295
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,090
Um,
well,

296
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,850
you got to have no teeth.
Yeah.

297
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:45,700
Leon had no team.
Michael was the one that fought Tyson.

298
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,690
Tyson knocked on Atlantic city.
Yes.

299
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,381
Right.
Yes.

300
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:52,440
That's Mike Spence.
Michael spinks was the,

301
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:54,430
the genx.
He was the former light heavyweight

302
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,930
champion.
He was a light heavyweight champ for

303
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:57,360
many years.
He's a really good light,

304
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,140
heavy weight,
really good boxer,

305
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,400
very smart and beat Larry Holmes for the
heavyweight title.

306
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,870
But it really wasn't a heavyweight.
You know,

307
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:07,030
he'd be Larry Holmes.
Larry Holmes couldn't pull the trigger

308
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:09,190
anymore.
And you know,

309
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,380
Michael just was real slick,
real smart.

310
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,410
It wasn't dangerous enough to like
threaten homes,

311
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,770
like to try to knock them out.
But Larry just didn't have it in the

312
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:21,370
tank like he did later in life.
It was a controversial decision anyway.

313
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:22,570
But anyway,
beat Larry.

314
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,530
And so he became the champ.
I guess it was like Ibf champ or

315
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:27,070
something like that.

316
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,730
I don't even remember.
And then Tyson just marked them,

317
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,300
merck them.
Oh,

318
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,300
it was awful.
That's the difference between a real

319
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:37,840
heavyweight and a light heavyweight.
Like there's just a difference in frame.

320
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:40,090
Like nobody had ever done that to
Michael spinks.

321
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,630
Michael spinks was so good.
He had a nasty right hand dude.

322
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:45,610
He was fucking dudes up at light
heavyweight,

323
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,390
but he was also had,
had a long career,

324
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,250
fought a lot of really tough guys and
then,

325
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:53,270
you know,
gets uh,

326
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,200
gets the money fight the night that he,
that Tyson knock the mountain record

327
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,130
time.
Yeah.

328
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,800
I was never so pissed off.
My wife is robbing a drug dealer and he

329
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,640
will left the house to go to watch the
fight at somebodies house.

330
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,840
So here I am,
case in the fucking joint.

331
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:10,820
He leaves 10 minutes before the fight,
I'm still crawling through a window,

332
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:14,120
fight in the dog off and all of a sudden
I hear cars,

333
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,980
I get in my fucking car,
I got the coke.

334
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,500
Well,
often I see him coming back and he calls

335
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,850
me like,
and that way if somebody robbed my

336
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:21,380
house,
but he talking about Nah,

337
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,560
I went,
I came back early because he knocked

338
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,400
them on 13 seconds,
15 seconds.

339
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:27,650
What the fuck?
I'm never in Boulder,

340
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:32,630
Colorado on Macarthur Lane.
I was casing the motherfuck out.

341
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,300
Those are the days where,
do you remember the p?

342
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,740
The closed circuit days?
Yeah.

343
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,320
We used to watch fights at movie
theaters.

344
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,191
Really?
Yeah,

345
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:44,930
it was a big thing.
Yeah.

346
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,240
You get,
your friends would get together and we

347
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:49,370
would go,
we'd all go to a movie theater and we'd

348
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:54,290
watch a fight on like closed circuit or
they even have it at the Boston Garden.

349
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,780
I used to go to the track.
Oh yeah.

350
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,210
In the metal lands and that's why I saw
you,

351
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:00,840
boy,
the Detroit hip man,

352
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,590
Tommy hearns fight some,
but like a great fight.

353
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:06,180
Like,
I don't know if it was Duran or Leonard

354
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,400
Duran,
he murked around,

355
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,300
but he fought somebody and we watched it
on a track on a Monday night.

356
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,430
Do you ever see that knock out that
hearns have you seen it reasonably and

357
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,500
pull that up?
Tommy hearns man was such a freak of

358
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:22,190
nature because he was so tall and long
man.

359
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,550
And he had muscle,
like it wasn't just tall and long.

360
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:29,210
He was tall and long.
Buddy was fucking strong and if he

361
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,980
caught you at the end of that right
hand,

362
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:33,740
I mean it was one of the most
devastating punches and all boxing,

363
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,310
which is why it was so crazy that hacker
was able to just walk right through

364
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:40,280
them.
Haggler just walked right through him,

365
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:41,114
man.

366
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,860
Yeah.

367
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,360
Hagler you could just take it like
nobody else.

368
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,160
I mean haggler had to like nasty power,
but one of the things that was most

369
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:52,580
impressive about Hagler was you could
just hit him with anything.

370
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
They never seem to be here.
Oh yeah.

371
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,480
Ryan had a great fight.
Maybe four.

372
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,710
That was a great,
great,

373
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,000
great fucking fight.
Haggler really respected Duran in that

374
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:06,520
fight and really didn't take it to him.
He knew how dangerous Duran was.

375
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,200
Duran was a still a real sneaky boxers
this after you'd beaten Davey Moore,

376
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,570
but see her and just had this distance
man,

377
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,990
and he could fuck Duran up at distance.
He would just like come in with that

378
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:22,980
whip of a punch cod.
Damn Dude.

379
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,100
They don't even look like then the same
way.

380
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:26,850
Cool.
Ooh,

381
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,550
there's a right hand that drop some,
Oh shit.

382
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,690
They really weren't.
Duran started off his career as a 135

383
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:37,650
pounder,
then moved up to one 47 and I don't know

384
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:41,160
what the fight this fight was probably
one 54 if I had to guess.

385
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,420
[inaudible] would,
uh,

386
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,370
this fight was at what?
Weight class?

387
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,350
Because he fought as high as
middleweight.

388
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,180
We fought Hagler who was at
middleweight?

389
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,810
He was fighting guys at some pretty
heavy weights.

390
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,630
One 54 yeah.
So that's light,

391
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,130
light metal

392
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,590
or super welterweight depending on what
organization calls it.

393
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,630
But yeah,
there Duran was like 20 pounds over.

394
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:11,040
His ideal fighting weight is ideal.
Fighting way.

395
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,660
It was lightweight.
It wasn't a big framed guy like these

396
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:17,630
guys,
but he still was skillful enough to hang

397
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:21,660
in with them for the most part.
But hearns Merck.

398
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,003
Yeah,

399
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,570
it is right there as the MERC shot.

400
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,500
Yeah.

401
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,230
That's one they don't even count for.
When you get hit like that,

402
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:35,650
they don't even bother counting.
Let me ask you something.

403
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,620
How do you feel about guns right now?
This

404
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,490
point in your life with a family and
what's going on in your mind?

405
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,670
How do you feel about guns?
This is the real problem with guns.

406
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,360
The same problem with everything else.
People are fucking stupid.

407
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,520
They're a bunch of people that are
fucking stupid.

408
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,290
Now,
if you had to ask me,

409
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,700
do I think that everybody in this room,
do I think that they are responsible

410
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,950
enough to handle a firearm and own a
firearm?

411
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,270
Yes,
absolutely.

412
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,220
Everybody in this room is,
I believe so,

413
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,070
but is it everybody in the world?
Fuck no,

414
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,420
but it cou can decide.
Well,

415
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:09,330
that's the part in the whole law.
The whole point of the law is you can't

416
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:12,900
let some Thai ironical dictator decide
who can and can't be armed.

417
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,840
Because at the end of the day,
what we really have to worry about as

418
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:18,180
much as crime.
So you have to worry about the

419
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:21,770
government turning into crime because
the governments of,

420
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,170
of nations all over the world have
fucked the people over and done shit

421
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:28,020
that people don't want,
imprisoned them,

422
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:28,980
enslaved them.

423
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,840
And,
but when we supposed to ignore that and

424
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,900
we supposed to pretend we're passed that
we're passed that completely,

425
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,800
people never be like that again.
An armed militia is be in the

426
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,530
possibility that it all goes wrong.
That's what it's for.

427
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:42,060
It's not,
it's not for when everything's going

428
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:44,190
right.
It's for when it all goes wrong.

429
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:49,080
To deny the possibility that it could
all go wrong to me.

430
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:51,450
You're lying.
You're lying.

431
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,720
You're pretending we're better than we
are because you look all over the world.

432
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,780
There's war everywhere.
There's war everywhere in the world.

433
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,020
There's murder everywhere in the world
is robbery and thievery.

434
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,360
Everywhere in the world.
There's not equal.

435
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,300
It's not equal with,
as the amount of chances people have is

436
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:07,470
not equal.
The amount of,

437
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:09,600
uh,
the time you do in jail if you get

438
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:12,990
caught for things,
there's all sorts of inequalities and

439
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:15,330
all sorts of real fucking problems in
the world.

440
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,540
And to deny,
to say that we've reached some utopian

441
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,710
place,
we don't have to worry about the

442
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:22,530
government turning into a tyranny
bullshit.

443
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,233
No,
I don't think it's,

444
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,310
I don't think the government right now
is a tyranny.

445
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,800
I don't think they're controlling you.
That's,

446
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,060
I don't think they're doing anything
unbelievably oppressive.

447
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,620
I think they respond to it in a certain
extent to the amount of pressure that

448
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:37,140
people put on them.
And when people say things like that,

449
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:39,940
we don't want to go into Syria.
Remember that Syria thing or Obama was

450
00:20:39,941 --> 00:20:40,771
on TV.
We were like,

451
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:42,540
fuck this.
No one wants to go to Syria.

452
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,601
They like,
what did the dit,

453
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:43,881
dit,
dit,

454
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:44,171
dit,
dit,

455
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:46,170
dit,
dit to ease back on the Syria.

456
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,040
He's back on Syria.
At

457
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,240
the end of the day,
people that are used to going to war,

458
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,120
liked to go to war.
They make a lot of fucking money doing

459
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,620
it.
And you have to be aware of that kind of

460
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,600
shit.
You gotta be aware of people trying to

461
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:01,240
force you into things.
The other thing about Kent State,

462
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,920
man,
that was in our lifetime,

463
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,320
you know the,
during the Vietnam War,

464
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:10,321
they fucking shot kids that were
protesting the shot him on the college

465
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:14,260
campus for doing nothing but protesting.
That wasn't that long ago,

466
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:16,090
man.
It's not that long ago.

467
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,880
I'm not advocating.
That should be some fucking uprising and

468
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:20,640
people should pull guns.
But I'm,

469
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,740
I am saying you can't just have one
group of people running other groups of

470
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:30,060
people with no recourse with,
with no you,

471
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,450
you,
the,

472
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:30,751
the,
the,

473
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:34,840
the,
the people don't have any ability to

474
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:35,674
stop them.

475
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,650
So the people in power,
we just have to trust that they're going

476
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:40,840
to be good.
That's crazy.

477
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,720
Why would you do that?
They're just people and people.

478
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:46,840
If you give them too much power,
they almost always fuck it.

479
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,180
The almost always abused the shit out of
it.

480
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,860
It's very rare that someone gets in a
position of power and all of a sudden

481
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:56,800
does wonderful selfless things for the
world.

482
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,010
Bullshit.
They do weird things.

483
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,130
They have weird fucking people that get
paid off of subsidies for like oil and

484
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:09,490
corn and greasy dealings with private
prisons.

485
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:13,750
Like there's a lot of fucking weird shit
going on and power.

486
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,640
So to say that we're just,
oh,

487
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:17,520
everything's gonna be fine.
We don't need guns in him.

488
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,920
In England we didn't have guns and we
find you still a queen.

489
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,420
You still in some weird fucking quasi
imperial state.

490
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,170
The scariest thing though is like if you
go on facebook and you scroll through

491
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:32,470
this video after video of people fight,
like that's the biggest thing that was

492
00:22:32,471 --> 00:22:35,740
worldstar orange people fighting.
Well that's only hears me for all these

493
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:37,540
people to have guns like it.
That's true too.

494
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,450
But to be honest,
like with all the road rage happening,

495
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:42,880
like that guy a few months ago,
it got pulled out of his car.

496
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:46,240
I'm like Hollywood boulevard.
Some fucking gun took up to be on the

497
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:49,570
offensive.
I don't want a gun to be on the

498
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:50,770
offensive.
Right.

499
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,190
I want a gun and case.
Last night him and I were talking shit

500
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:57,910
to pull 30th bet on my side street.
Three cops with three,

501
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:01,060
uh,
a guy kept circling God,

502
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,880
you know,
after half hour cop came by because

503
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:06,610
somebody actually called the problem
with competencies is two guys standing

504
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:07,560
out there.
Ah,

505
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,463
bullshit.

506
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,390
Look at you and criminal looking
motherfucker.

507
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,840
We were out there just telling stories
that till the commies.

508
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,693
Yeah,
I know

509
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,860
for a minute.
Then when that white car came around the

510
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:20,860
second time,
I thought I needed a gun.

511
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,750
I don't know what people are thinking.
No,

512
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:25,990
you don't know what people are thinking.
You could zig when you could have zagged

513
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,400
and you could run into someone who's out
of their fucking monitor and fucking

514
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,420
once and you never know.
I mean,

515
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:33,490
I'm not an advocate of being armed all
the time.

516
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:37,000
That's not what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is you can't let the

517
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:41,470
government tell you whether or not you
can have a weapon.

518
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,750
It's just not.
It doesn't make sense.

519
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:44,920
For years,
I had the felony.

520
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,550
I still have the felonies and the
government tells me I can't have a

521
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,230
pistol.
Now.

522
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,690
Mike crime was with a pistol.

523
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,210
All right.
They go off.

524
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:57,920
No,
but there was a potential for violence.

525
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,130
There's always a,
always a potential for violence in my

526
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:04,340
heart and in my mind.
I did a probationary period already.

527
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,500
That was a 19 987 I did a probationary
period.

528
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,210
Again,
more in the probationary period.

529
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,870
I feel in my heart right now,
I'm capable of carrying a gun.

530
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,010
As much as I hate it,
I fucking hate those things because I

531
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:20,720
know what they bring.
You know what I'm saying?

532
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:23,300
I know what they bring to some people
and I got to bring it to me cause I'm

533
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:25,700
not young and stupid anymore.
Do you understand me?

534
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:29,270
I really wanted to protect my daughter.
I really wanted to.

535
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,180
There's weird people doing every time
you watched the news,

536
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:34,130
every time I watch the news and I see
something stupid.

537
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,740
What happened in Houston yesterday?
You see that?

538
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,460
Yes.
No.

539
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,110
So what happens?
Soldiers snapped.

540
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,120
No four fucking tours in Afghanistan and
he got some fucking machine gun.

541
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:47,840
He shot somebody at a gas station.
There was so many fucking bullets that

542
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:50,130
the gas station blow up in a suburban
install.

543
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,730
The cops were in this,
you got to see the cop cars.

544
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,240
It was like heat.
Remember those cars with the windshields

545
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:59,040
and shit.
So do not get in a road rage with

546
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,551
somebody.
No,

547
00:24:59,551 --> 00:24:59,821
no,
no,

548
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:01,490
no.
He just wanted to go guest as you shot a

549
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:04,130
customer and from there the party
started,

550
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:08,090
walked down the street shooting a one
dead six engine,

551
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,580
you know,
shot up 30 fucking cause in the middle

552
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,950
of the street.
I'm walking into a movie with my

553
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:15,680
daughter.
I'm minding my business instead of

554
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,040
fucking driving.
Let's walk through the Taco place today.

555
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,030
That could happen.
That could happen.

556
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,760
I know this going in when I leave my
house every morning,

557
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:26,390
I know this is possible and that's the
messed up part because he has a gun,

558
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,610
he has the right to have a gun.
But if someone else in Houston,

559
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,270
they come up,
shot dead,

560
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,250
six injured randomly.
Just that whoever you need that in your

561
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:37,010
life.
Now I'm not a sharp shooter.

562
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:38,720
Black could shoot him in the fucking
leg.

563
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,930
I believe in shooting them in the leg.
If I have a great cover,

564
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,810
I'm not looking to shoot the fucking guy
like the cops are gonna.

565
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,350
I mean you should have heard the tapes.
It's crazy.

566
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,460
Mass Texas to where everybody's armed.
But you know,

567
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:57,440
many people are not trained.
That's also big part of a brother.

568
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,680
Let me tell you something.
You have no idea what happens to your

569
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:03,440
body when you hear a gunshot 10 feet
from me.

570
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,180
Oh yeah,
you have no idea.

571
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,180
I don't know.
I don't give a fuck what they won't want

572
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,070
to try for chocolate though.
And I know,

573
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,550
I know he knocked the fuck out of you,
but you've never heard a gunshot go off.

574
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,970
You got to see people's faces to see
people's faces and you hear that clip

575
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:22,070
for real.
They ain't a movie.

576
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,280
The Saint,
no dogs no longer in movie or what's the

577
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:27,680
other guy that played the mechanic?
Ain't one of these movies.

578
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:29,690
This is [inaudible] stadium.
You know,

579
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,820
just shoot you.
It just kills you.

580
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,920
That's why people freeze.
Freeze.

581
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:35,660
You're going to shock people that are
not used to that.

582
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,570
They play Bingo and they take their
family for ice cream.

583
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:40,330
They don't need that shit.
Yeah,

584
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,590
I,
I'm petrified.

585
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,060
I live in theories of

586
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,740
this.
It always listen to this Ted podcast.

587
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:50,280
It was really interesting man.
And they were talking about a comradery

588
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,920
and they were talking about the people
that go to war together.

589
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,470
And one of the things that they all say
is that,

590
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,080
uh,
their comradery and their love for each

591
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:02,940
other is unlike any love or friendship
that anybody else could ever possibly

592
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:07,941
experience because it's so intense
because it's like life or death every

593
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,020
single day in that when the wars are
over and they're back home,

594
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,230
they're happy,
they're safe and they're with their

595
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,240
family and everything,
but they,

596
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,850
they look back and they go,
the best time of my life was being at

597
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:19,440
war.
Like tat.

598
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,400
That's crazy.
What does that say about people about,

599
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,990
and I'm not,
this is not a judgment,

600
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,750
I'm not like not a moral judgment.
What does that say about people?

601
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,890
What I'm saying is what does that say
about the way the brain works?

602
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:37,230
Like how strange is it that people can
get so excited about being in danger and

603
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,850
the comradery that comes from being in
danger?

604
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:47,060
It like reawakens us almost puts us in
this like primal state that we use to

605
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:50,940
exist in.
And now instead of that worst case

606
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:53,040
scenario,
some guy fucking snaps and he's on the

607
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,330
high,
he starts shooting at people.

608
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:56,190
That's the,
that's kind of like worst case scenario

609
00:27:56,191 --> 00:28:00,060
that we all worry about.
But most people fucking keep it

610
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:02,220
together,
which is one of the most amazing things

611
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,510
about being a person.
But the experience is flat,

612
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,780
does not enough excitement.
There's not enough happening.

613
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,540
There's not enough stimulation is not
enough creativity.

614
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,880
So you live a different life,
you live a different life.

615
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:17,460
You guys are podcasts and then doing
standup shows.

616
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:20,810
So there's all this,
how this outpouring of creativity.

617
00:28:20,811 --> 00:28:21,644
You have all this,
uh,

618
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,320
room for expression.
Some people that just feel like

619
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,360
compressed,
they feel like they've just,

620
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,330
they've got a board tied to their chest,
into their back,

621
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:34,650
and every day someone pulls the fucking
strap on that board and that's every

622
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,450
day.
And it's just boring as fuck.

623
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,140
And when they deploy and they're over
there and you know,

624
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,370
yeah,
they're gonna miss their family.

625
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,320
Yeah.
They're going to be risking their lives.

626
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:43,921
Yeah.
All the,

627
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:46,680
all those things are 100% true,
but for them,

628
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,590
that experience was the best time of
their life.

629
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,300
That's amazing.
We're strange.

630
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:53,810
No,

631
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,620
no,
no.

632
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,260
Because you and I work in an office
together.

633
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,170
You'll meet Jamie and lead work in an
office together.

634
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,870
We go on every Monday we talked about
the UFC and then,

635
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:06,650
and I will lay this back,
the fucking stocks and bonds or whatever

636
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:10,010
the fuck we're doing,
and then we call away on Friday and

637
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:13,670
that's it.
The same works for the people I did

638
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:17,330
crimes with early on.
I still talk to those people because I

639
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:18,980
went through a weird experience with
that.

640
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,120
Something that you don't do it.
Most people something that,

641
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,690
and they accepted me,
who I'm in front go on before and I,

642
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,380
I talked to this kid timmy,
I will every fucking day at five in the

643
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:32,780
morning we'd talk.
He was the getaway driver.

644
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:35,870
When I robbed the jewelry stuff,
I have a loyalty to him,

645
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,830
but we were at a light and the cops came
by and the trunk opened up with a gold

646
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:41,350
chains.
We both shut up pants.

647
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,300
It's,
you know,

648
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,390
it's something about that.
I always had the respect for the

649
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:49,540
camaraderie.
What gets you through those first six

650
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:53,780
years of comedy when your life is shit.
What the fuck gets you through it?

651
00:29:53,781 --> 00:29:56,590
We'll get you through.
We were just talking about it right when

652
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:59,050
I call you.
When I go with driving to quincy tonight

653
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:02,470
motherfucker.
That way you just is dead always.

654
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,430
Shit.
How much older than I got like 11 bucks

655
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,440
Joey.
I know like fucking nine dog.

656
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,830
We got a steak.
We'll buy a bag of weed.

657
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,040
How much fun you don't want to like
that's the best part of comedy.

658
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,120
It's hard to believe,
right?

659
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,550
That's the batch part account.
I don't give a fuck what anybody tells

660
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:19,950
you.
Standing ovations.

661
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,420
Selling tickets.
Look.

662
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,610
Part of comedy you're going to remember
is when you were brody Stevens in the

663
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:27,520
car with Josh Wolfe and I got brody in
the back,

664
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:32,160
tied up in the fucking back in the Volvo
and I'm doing a hundred with his car and

665
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,340
he's yelling,
stop it.

666
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,960
Normal people do not live like this.
Every time I see droughty I give him a

667
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,961
hug because it's when I'm in that
fucking box on my mission to wherever

668
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:45,520
the fuck Buddha land.
That's what I'm going to be thinking

669
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:47,920
about.
How good of a time that I have when I

670
00:30:47,921 --> 00:30:50,740
had $3 in my,
you ever read the brother Sam book,

671
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,010
brother Sam,
you know about Sam and Sam Kinison,

672
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,640
his brother Bill,
part of that fucking story.

673
00:30:57,641 --> 00:31:01,840
The best part of that whole story that
every time I see call I give them a hug

674
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:04,450
because I can relate.
It's when they talked about how broke

675
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:06,630
they were and they would walk to the
comedy store,

676
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,810
they eat the fruit from the bar.
The bartender would chop up.

677
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,400
Wow.
Who admits that?

678
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,970
Who had mixed that?
But you and I know that secret.

679
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,940
And it's the same thing,
man.

680
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,150
Well,
this is a thing that this happened to

681
00:31:22,151 --> 00:31:25,450
when you're going on those gigs where
you don't know if this is gonna be,

682
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,750
it's going to be successful,
not just the Gig,

683
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,720
but this has a career like you.
You're not like,

684
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,640
I'm a comic fucking,
I'm a comic.

685
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,530
They like,
am I pulling this off?

686
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:36,364
Like,
is this,

687
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,770
I got a Gig now and I'm trying,
I'm,

688
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,640
I'm out here.
You know,

689
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:43,720
it's like me and fitzsimmons would do
these gigs and we would both be like

690
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,360
barely should be talking to people on
stage.

691
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,950
Barely.
I mean,

692
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,300
we were rookies,
man,

693
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,670
we were fucking rookies.
And in Boston,

694
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:54,490
if you could string together 20 minutes,
they had so many rooms.

695
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,770
Everybody was working.
It was crazy.

696
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,020
What are you able to have fun during
that time?

697
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:00,850
Or was a yes.
Fucking great.

698
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,950
Unbelievable.
So fun.

699
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,450
But I was like terrified.

700
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,170
It wasn't going to work out.
Terrified that I was wasting my time.

701
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,970
I mean,
cause it was a big chance.

702
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,840
I quit everything.
I knew I'd been papers or something like

703
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:15,610
that.
I kept delivering papers,

704
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:20,710
but I quit teaching at Boston University
and I quit teaching classes.

705
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,450
I said,
I don't want to do it.

706
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,450
I said I don't want to half asset and
I'm not thinking about it the way I used

707
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:29,710
to think about it when I was teaching
before it was like it was a,

708
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,980
it was life.
I was teaching life and I was teaching,

709
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,320
well you know people kicking and
punching.

710
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,410
It was like as important as life.
It was everything.

711
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:42,500
I was thinking constantly about
techniques and movements and strategies

712
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:46,310
and constantly and so when I was
teaching people I wanted people to be as

713
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:50,000
into it as I was and if they weren't I
really wasn't into it that they were,

714
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,060
I I like,
I had a bunch of students that I took up

715
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:55,190
to like you know,
pretty good level,

716
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,240
like a,
you know,

717
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,210
below black belt but pretty good level
where they're getting really good and

718
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,260
starting to win tournaments.

719
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,690
It was really exciting.
I was doing all this,

720
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:07,691
like from the time I was like 19 to 21
and I'm so teaching and competing at the

721
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:12,890
same time.
And when I first started doing comedy,

722
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,630
I was really,
I realized right away I was like,

723
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:16,100
I got to quit.
I coulda quit everything.

724
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,890
I just got to do this.
So it was like,

725
00:33:17,891 --> 00:33:20,990
it was such a fucking leap man.
Every Gig,

726
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:22,220
I was terrified.
I was like,

727
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:24,230
is this stupid thing I'm doing?
Look,

728
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:26,780
what am I retarded?
Why the fuck I think I'm funny?

729
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,250
One thing I can get people to pay me to
talk and I'd see the guys that were

730
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:33,890
doing and in town,
the guys that were making it,

731
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:36,710
and it was just like they feel,
they felt just out of reach,

732
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,310
just just out of reach.
So you never know,

733
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,160
you know?
And then you'd go and you'd do some Gig

734
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:42,890
in Maine and get heckled and eat dick.

735
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,070
He's fucking Obama stage.
And they'd go,

736
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,860
oh my God,
what else could I do if this doesn't

737
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:49,940
work out?
What else could I do?

738
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,700
Because there was nothing else you
wanted to do.

739
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,250
No,
I would go home at night after a bombing

740
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:58,720
and just cry and I'd circle.
They used to have just for the labs and

741
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,200
newspaper.
Yeah,

742
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,770
I remember that section.
It had all the clubs state by state,

743
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:06,320
Alabama,
and I would circle the clubs.

744
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:09,470
That's,
I'm going to show them some day

745
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,500
show that
Birmingham,

746
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,680
but I'm going to go to see,
I love the ground and,

747
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,560
and one day event.
And you're like,

748
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:20,510
wow.
But it's so weird that there's so many

749
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:22,130
things I'm alive.
You could pay for.

750
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,780
You can't pay for love and you can't pay
for Camaraderie.

751
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,280
Man.
There's something about a camaraderie,

752
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,350
a real camaraderie.
He didn't like.

753
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:32,740
Sometimes when you go to Jujitsu,
when this guy fucking design,

754
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,490
yet he taps you at the end.

755
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,530
You get up and you hug them.
You go,

756
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:37,490
man,
that was great.

757
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:40,400
You sweat my face.
Jesus Christ.

758
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,410
I could smell the cheeseburger from last
night.

759
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,530
And that's come out of it.
You can't pay for that.

760
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,810
But it's weird that,
listen,

761
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:50,180
if you're running with people everyday
and they got your back,

762
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,600
I can't imagine that camaraderie.
That's real.

763
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,561
Yeah.
So what about,

764
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:57,140
what were the comradery that we're
talking about that this makes you

765
00:34:57,141 --> 00:35:01,760
understand like what the story about
these guys that want to go back?

766
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,520
You know like the movie hurt locker,
you know,

767
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,400
but that's what's different because that
guy was kind of addicted to Dis

768
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,780
disarming bombs,
right?

769
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,651
The dude,
the other one,

770
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:12,310
the Clint Eastwood one American sniper.
Oh right.

771
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,390
Goes back and she couldn't figure it
out.

772
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:16,340
Why do you keep going?
What the fuck did you won't shut the

773
00:35:16,341 --> 00:35:19,070
fuck off because you won't shut the fuck
up.

774
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,960
And this kid,
I don't know what's going on.

775
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,640
Let me go over that.
At least kill people.

776
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:25,640
Because then you feel,
can you imagine Joe Rogan?

777
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:29,360
Like all your life you got thrown out of
school.

778
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,400
You know you're fucking your mechanic,
you'll laws,

779
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:38,130
but all of a sudden you realize you're
going take alive.

780
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,610
You have to think of that.
You would put yourself in that position

781
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:44,760
when you're 18 years old,
19 years old,

782
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:49,761
you're in Vietnam and you realize that
you're taking your first tour back to

783
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,170
the United States.
Now you finished your year,

784
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,980
but you survive the 11 that went over
this,

785
00:35:54,981 --> 00:35:57,990
six of them laugh.
Then you survive and then reality in

786
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:02,991
God's eyes you got 18 kills.
Nobody knows that as like a 19 year old.

787
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:08,151
Now you go back to civilization
and you've got to get paid 10 bucks an

788
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:13,020
hour to change tires.
Why do you think for years I kept

789
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:18,021
selling coke because nothing really can
compare to that excitement,

790
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:20,770
excitement,
excitement of doing something and I'm

791
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,990
supposed to do,
I'm going to,

792
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:25,560
I'm going to go sit with my wife and
drink mint juleps with her fucking

793
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,750
family.
I could be killing motherfuckers right

794
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,040
now.
You know?

795
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,700
You know,
you know you get that rally that you get

796
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:36,240
a lot of love for doing that.
It's like you get love and respect from

797
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:38,700
the people that you work with for doing
your job correctly.

798
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,730
But then for manning up but then not
dead when you're stabbing them

799
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:45,100
motherfucking tickets got dog and how
strong your heart heart's.

800
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,550
And then our dad,
brother one,

801
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,830
it's like a shock when they get that
taste of blood,

802
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,650
those 18 the way that they should be
over there when the ways that they want

803
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:55,890
you when you were 18 but when you're 31
and tried to go in,

804
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:59,250
you already got beliefs and shit.
That's why I think your central nervous

805
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,070
system has already been set.
They can't get you to kill and forget,

806
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,580
but an 18 year old who rob,
she had blood free.

807
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,250
What's that marine say?
Semper fi.

808
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,270
Mighten Cuba's yet,
but their fleet.

809
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:19,860
I thought about that.
Can you imagine coming back here at 25

810
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:22,740
and now you've got to work at a bakery?
Couldn't imagine good luck.

811
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:27,030
1250 an hour and you get two weeks a
year of me and my all you're dreaming

812
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:32,031
about his fucking putting makeup on and
I treat with ropes with a machine gun

813
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:36,990
and a gun and knives a whole,
how much work do you think they'd put

814
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:41,940
into Red Justin guys,
those first reacclimating them back into

815
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:44,760
society after.
You don't want me to tell you the

816
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:46,590
problems we have.
We don't,

817
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,500
we can't do it effectively.
It's like a guy getting out of prison

818
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,880
after 20 years.
We haven't figured out a way to do it

819
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:57,780
effectively yet that there's no mishaps.
There's always gonna be a small

820
00:37:57,781 --> 00:38:00,870
percentage for this guy in Houston.
Yesterday did four tours.

821
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,240
How old was he,
Jamie

822
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,180
for tours?

823
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,640
What the fuck are you going to do in
this?

824
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,010
The United States,
it's going to give you that unless you

825
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:13,140
go on stage.
Even that,

826
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,510
even that,
it's nothing in comparison.

827
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,940
You said earlier,
like how crazy our brains are.

828
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,620
It's crazy how different.
Like when I was 18 it was 2007 I got

829
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,250
just graduating high school,
so like Iraq and Afghanistan were blown

830
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:27,900
away.
It was right at that time and I had

831
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:31,980
friends who went over but might like
what you are saying is exciting.

832
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,100
What I would want to wait from that.
There's no part of one five

833
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,290
years old for toys.
Oh my God.

834
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,420
Yeah.
Well you're a smart guy,

835
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:42,310
Lee.
No,

836
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,840
but they're smart people there.
There's like,

837
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,970
oh it's just people that are willing to
do the stuff that's more dangerous

838
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:52,870
because it feels better because it feels
like even though there's risk involved,

839
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,200
at least you feel charged up and alive.
There's a life of excitement versus a

840
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:00,910
life of,
you know,

841
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,230
why do you think people climb rocks?
They'd climb Brock's cause it's actually

842
00:39:05,231 --> 00:39:07,150
enjoyable climbing a rock.
No,

843
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:11,440
they climb a rock cause it's fucking
scary and you don't know if you can make

844
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:13,420
it.
You pretty sure you're to make it.

845
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:18,421
But there's a real risk that you get a
fucking hand spasm and you use this fall

846
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,990
for a long time until you splatter on
the bottom.

847
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,720
When you watch someone crazy like Alex
honnold,

848
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,190
right?
The guy with no ropes,

849
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,600
it does it with no ropes.

850
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,270
We had them in the podcast is super nice
guy.

851
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,010
Real,
real interesting guy.

852
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,950
Lives out of a van,
just travels around in climbs rocks.

853
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,400
He's an adrenaline junkie kid.
The climbing of the Rock,

854
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:42,850
it's like,
I mean I guess it's Kinda cool to be up

855
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:46,870
high and it's sort of like a version of
hiking for him cause he can kind of make

856
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:48,990
it.
But what's really going on is you,

857
00:39:48,991 --> 00:39:52,480
you recognize that you are on the edge
always.

858
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,450
And so even if you're not like your
adrenaline's not flying,

859
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:57,850
you're not freaking out,
you're heart's not pounding your

860
00:39:57,851 --> 00:40:01,240
heightened focus.
Incense is keenly aware that you're

861
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:06,100
holding back a waterfall of adrenaline.
You're keeping it together.

862
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:08,980
And so you're,
a lot of times guys that are doing like

863
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:11,380
crazy shit,
like tight rope walking and stuff like

864
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:12,460
that.
They're,

865
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,240
they're sort of addicted to trying to
control

866
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,050
what is this guy doing jamie?
Oh is this part core or something?

867
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,830
Just something really scary here in
about two seconds.

868
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,450
Go hand in a handstand.
No,

869
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:26,284
it's not.

870
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,290
Uh Huh.
Oh my God.

871
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,970
Oh my God,
this guy did.

872
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,090
He jumped and then did a hand.
He's still doing it on the edge.

873
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:44,290
Oh.
Oh my.

874
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,370
Have you seen the videos?
I like the people on the hover boards.

875
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,410
Hover boarding on like the tops of
buildings.

876
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,670
Don might have freaked me out more than
the hoverboard cause it guy was upside

877
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:54,020
down and I watched my daughter do those
things.

878
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:55,370
They don't know what he's land.
Perfect.

879
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,980
Fuck man.
Jesus Christ.

880
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,130
What the fuck is going on in Russia?
What are they feeding these people then?

881
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:07,110
Radioactive pigs from Chernobyl goes.
Ain't Russians?

882
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,870
Russia.
Russia.

883
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,520
You heard Russian?
I heard Russian.

884
00:41:10,521 --> 00:41:15,521
Didn't you hear Russian sound?
Sounded the Russian sounds.

885
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,860
My hands are sweaty.
I'm assuming it was Russian and my being

886
00:41:18,861 --> 00:41:20,600
racist.
It's not a race though.

887
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,290
Rush the owner's room reason rob
Washington isn't a racist because they

888
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:26,720
look like us.
Right?

889
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,970
I mean they're totally not regular white
people.

890
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,560
No.
No.

891
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,170
What does it say?
Does it say it's Russian?

892
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,250
Yeah,
it is Russia.

893
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,780
See Jesus Christ just assumed.
I pretty sure I heard some Russian

894
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:40,880
sounds though.
Yeah,

895
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:43,460
we're,
we're crazy people crazy with the need.

896
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,250
The juiced up need for those things.
It's like,

897
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,790
how do you feel?
Don't you don't even like feel sad when

898
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:53,800
someone's a comic and then they quit and
then you see him kind of hanging around

899
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:57,700
in a comedy club and they come back and
hang around and I haven't done standup

900
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:58,790
at 10 years.
You believe that?

901
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,480
Yeah.
How to deal with the bullshit no more.

902
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,790
My family's getting raised correctly.
Okay,

903
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:12,700
that's fucking great.
I just listen man.

904
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:15,500
You're going to do things in life that
you don't like and you,

905
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,040
and you recognize it.
You move on in La.

906
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,850
How many people have we met?
How many people that'd be starved?

907
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,370
So how many people went to Montreal and
I had said a lot and all of a sudden you

908
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:29,420
don't see him no more.

909
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,810
You just what I'm saying?
And then one day you go to a town and

910
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,010
you got to facebook,
hey I had to come back cause my uncle

911
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:40,070
died and I'm doing the podcast and kind
of do a guest spot.

912
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:40,933
You're like,
nope,

913
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,300
nope.
I don't know who you are.

914
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,640
I mean I just don't know what's going on
in anymore.

915
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,620
The whole guest spot things are weird
thing,

916
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,770
you know?
It's weird.

917
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,350
It's weird to ask people to come on a
professional show if you're not a

918
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:56,030
professional.
Like I get it.

919
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,010
Like that's how people get better.
They do guest spots,

920
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:01,100
but that should be something that
somebody asks you for.

921
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,950
It's you know like would you like to do
a guest spot like that?

922
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:09,010
You know like check you out on stage in
front of 3000 people but to like ask to

923
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:12,420
do that.
Like cause we all know like some comics

924
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:14,480
that are weird,
they'll like show up at your shows and

925
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:15,570
asked to do guest spot.

926
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,120
I'm like God I didn't know you were here
tonight.

927
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,540
Yeah,
I'm just driving your backspace fucking

928
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:23,260
Ontario often young and you didn't know
I was here tonight.

929
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,200
You don't see my name out there.
I made a rule about two years ago.

930
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,600
I love comedians.
I know what it is to be a comic.

931
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,800
So I'll tell you what I do.
I know what it was like for me to

932
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:38,540
feature until he that $400 for rent and
want to say that you get a call the week

933
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,160
before it.
The headline is bringing a feature I

934
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:41,390
get,
so I made a deal.

935
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,730
I won't bring a lot of features,
but I'm not doing guest spots and the

936
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:49,610
word gets out.
It's so crazy.

937
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:52,400
The word really gets out when you don't
do guest spots,

938
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,200
people don't show up to your shows no
more.

939
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,360
That's interesting.
I don't want them.

940
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,810
Whereas before they were showing up and
you they want to hang out in the green

941
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:03,860
room and here's my philosophy on it.
If you're so funny,

942
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:05,610
you wouldn't be here.
Get,

943
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,700
go get onstage.

944
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,020
And you know people come to the green
rooms and they want to hang out and

945
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:14,420
that's great.
I love seeing my old friends and stuff,

946
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:17,750
but I'm working right now and you're not
working well,

947
00:44:17,751 --> 00:44:20,810
not only that,
you don't have to be on that show.

948
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,700
Here's the thing,
like I,

949
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,770
when I was a kid and that was a starting
out,

950
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,620
I love going to shows.
I still love going to shows.

951
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:30,020
I don't have to be on stage to enjoy a
show.

952
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,660
So if I go to show,
then I'm like trying to get a guest spot

953
00:44:32,661 --> 00:44:33,930
on.
Someone's showing don't even know that

954
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:37,620
person or barely know that person.
That's fucking weird.

955
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:39,960
I never did that.
I don't know anybody who did that.

956
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,370
None of us did that.
You either got asked or you just kept

957
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:46,500
working.
He kept doing shows that were at your

958
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:47,760
level until you got better.

959
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,030
That's just what everybody does.
Like this guest Bot thing,

960
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:55,050
like that is not how it works.
You can't just show up and get on in

961
00:44:55,051 --> 00:45:00,051
front of a couple thousand people.
I didn't have two gigs the night I lied

962
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:02,520
to you because I knew you were going to
ask me to come over to the ice house,

963
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,510
but I know you're working.
Yeah,

964
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,660
but I don't care what else.
I don't want them disrupting.

965
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:13,290
Oh that's very kind of you.
But I sometimes I go to the ice house

966
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,080
and there's 18 guys up before you and I
go,

967
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:20,460
this isn't right.
This pool guy did a all with justice and

968
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:22,520
now motherfuckers are doing 20 in front
of me,

969
00:45:22,521 --> 00:45:24,120
you know,
and I go up there and the weight he gets

970
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,840
mad at me because I noticed like the
feel when I get to the fucking club.

971
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:30,960
But I'm ready to go steams coming out of
my nose.

972
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,320
I got to eat two stars to calm me down.
I already ate,

973
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:36,330
I worked out,
I'm fired up.

974
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:40,680
I gotta wait two or three fucking comics
now the last 15 minutes I'm pacing back

975
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:42,870
there like a fucking animal,
you know,

976
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,170
I just want to get up there and do my
fucking thing and now I got to wait.

977
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,710
And it's not that,
it's just that some comedians come into

978
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:53,670
a room to ruin the show,
blow this fucking place up and they

979
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:56,460
really blow away.
When I get down Thursday you work with

980
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:58,380
the other two guys,
you get the niche,

981
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,440
you see who you're already working with.
And then some guy wants to come in

982
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:02,490
Saturday like,
oh my God,

983
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:04,130
I didn't know you went down because I do
it guest,

984
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,520
it's not going to happen.
Especially Saturday cause he got to show

985
00:46:07,521 --> 00:46:09,270
you,
I've got two shows especially fucking

986
00:46:09,271 --> 00:46:10,104
Friday.

987
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,350
And it's like my heart goes out to you
as a comic.

988
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:15,060
I know what it is to be a struggling
comic,

989
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:20,190
but there's nothing going on here.
But who does let guys to guest sets?

990
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,770
Who does what?
What does a lot of Comedians,

991
00:46:22,771 --> 00:46:25,440
national headlines or just let the local
guys do guests sets.

992
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,490
I Dunno and don't you have to worry
about like putting on a good show?

993
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,280
Like if you put it on a guy who was
terrible and they would just ruin the

994
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:34,250
show.
These people paid a lot of money first.

995
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:36,810
So I will let someone have a guest spot
once.

996
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:37,920
And,
um,

997
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:38,933
this was,
uh,

998
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,090
on a,
a show with like in one of those ice

999
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:45,210
house type shows,
like 10 people on and he bombed so bad

1000
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,230
that it tanked the rest of the night
because the people had to sit through 10

1001
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:53,610
minutes of like really clumsy,
shitty jokes like from someone who like

1002
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:55,080
barely does comedy,
you know,

1003
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,870
I had find out later and then
afterwards,

1004
00:46:57,871 --> 00:47:01,530
like the audience had a lowered
expectation whereas before it'd be like

1005
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,260
Ian Edwards,
Tony Hinchcliffe,

1006
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:05,550
Tom Segura,
smash,

1007
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:06,384
smash,
smash.

1008
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,820
And everybody would be experiencing that
all night.

1009
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,510
Well there's this 10 minute gap where it
was just sludge,

1010
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:17,230
just like really shitty ideas and just
not done well and the audience went

1011
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,920
whoa.
Like you could see them get super bummed

1012
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,190
out.
Yeah.

1013
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,840
Especially when you're on a good show
like that.

1014
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,070
I've been lucky enough to go the past
few weeks to the store.

1015
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:29,200
But Joey,
when it's really good shows it's fun.

1016
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:31,270
But when there's like,
I went to a show once and there was a

1017
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,390
magician on this on stage and it just,
I just,

1018
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:36,220
I think of him because I know he hates
it,

1019
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,700
but it's so weird how important it is to
build a good show and to build,

1020
00:47:40,701 --> 00:47:43,600
it shows the comics who global
altogether it's,

1021
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,120
you can't just have,
you can't just throw a comedian's up

1022
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:48,550
there and have a good show.
The problem is like people are friends

1023
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:50,890
with people that you know,
and then you know,

1024
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:51,761
they,
you know,

1025
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:53,920
you know them and they know you and the,
hey man,

1026
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:55,150
can I do one of those ice house shows?

1027
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:55,811
Yeah,
sure.

1028
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:58,210
Come on down.
Doucet I'll say,

1029
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,460
and then you just go,
oh no,

1030
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,670
what has happened here?
Jesus fucking Christ.

1031
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:06,460
And if you do that like this,
this guy,

1032
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:09,820
like it's written jokes that day and was
doing them that night.

1033
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,580
He had never done them before.
Like,

1034
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:14,440
can I try to do like a Ho?
So it's a long ass story.

1035
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:19,870
But when that does happen,
the p the audience feels like you fucked

1036
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:21,040
him.
You know,

1037
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:23,890
like people always say like,
why would I take the bass comedians on

1038
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:24,671
the road with me?
Like,

1039
00:48:24,671 --> 00:48:26,710
dude,
wouldn't you want to like stand out

1040
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,150
front of the other comedians?
Oh,

1041
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:31,480
the audience feels like you fucked him.
Then like you've made up for the fact

1042
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:34,510
that you fucked him by being really
funny for the last hour and 10 minutes.

1043
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,450
But you know you fucked them for the
first 20 minutes.

1044
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:40,600
If you fill in the blank with the name
of the Comedians,

1045
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:45,010
there's a bunch of crazy fucking
comedians that will open for other like

1046
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:47,470
national acts and they don't work
anywhere else.

1047
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:50,860
They just,
the work is like opening acts for big

1048
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:55,480
time national acts who don't want to be
like showing up on stage.

1049
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,910
They don't want someone going on before
I'm being really funny.

1050
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,020
But isn't that the point of the opener
to warm them up?

1051
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:05,470
Like that's why they have a studio warm
up people for TV shows because they want

1052
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:10,471
them to have good energy and
I want you to warm him up to a degree

1053
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:16,870
that you really have to hold back a
little bit because they're the star of

1054
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,120
the show.
This whole stupid.

1055
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,610
I rather we come from the school of
thought.

1056
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:26,350
We want everybody to be fucking great
because of the guy in front of me is

1057
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:28,360
fucking great while I'm back there
taking them,

1058
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:31,390
watching this,
I'm going to come out throwing 92 miles

1059
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,390
an hour if the guy's in front of me is
lack of days.

1060
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,090
I,
it happened to me one time where you on

1061
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:38,800
the road?
We left the gift set up.

1062
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,850
The guy's energy was low.
I W he sucked me in when I went up there

1063
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:46,450
and bomb because of him because I didn't
want to make him.

1064
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,430
It was so bad.
I said,

1065
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,210
I'm not going to do material now I just
go up to him and talk because it's a bad

1066
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:54,730
thing that does happen when you watch
really bad comedy,

1067
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:57,250
like someone who's like really amateur
level comedy.

1068
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:00,400
It's something weird happens where you
get confused as to what's funny,

1069
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:03,160
what's not funny.
It's like it's almost like a

1070
00:50:03,161 --> 00:50:05,800
smokescreen,
like one of the ink things at a squid

1071
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:06,634
shoots and like,
yeah,

1072
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:11,850
like you see someone on stage that's
really new and really bad and just you

1073
00:50:13,121 --> 00:50:14,980
got to get out of the room.
It's like why?

1074
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:18,670
Like you can,
your mind can get locked into their way

1075
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:22,060
of thinking because that's what I think
is happening anyway on stage.

1076
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,940
I think the reason why comedy is so
funny,

1077
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,290
it's because you're thinking like that
guy,

1078
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,363
the guys

1079
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:33,430
taking you for a ride and when you let a
bad comedian take you for a ride,

1080
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:37,160
like you get stuck in like what they're
doing on stage.

1081
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,630
Say if they're doing like real obvious
hack material,

1082
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,490
cop donut jokes,
you know,

1083
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,850
Tampon Chubb price check,
you know that kind of stuff and the

1084
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:48,610
audience is really laughing.
You'll,

1085
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,260
you'll get confused and your whole set
you like you have to shut him out and

1086
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:52,641
like,
wow,

1087
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:54,530
la La,
you've got to listen to some music.

1088
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:57,320
You got to go onstage fresh.
Like they didn't exist.

1089
00:50:57,321 --> 00:51:00,980
You're better off not seeing them.
I don't want to see him no more.

1090
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,860
I come out like gladiator.
Yeah,

1091
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,850
you have to come out of that case like
Gladia.

1092
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:08,810
I don't want to get caught up like
Friday or Saturday early show on what's

1093
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:11,600
the other acts and I started getting
into it,

1094
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,850
but until then I want to come out of the
box like a fucking savage.

1095
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,130
Right.
But if you're working with people that

1096
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:17,630
you love,
like if you were doing a show with

1097
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,720
Dunkin and Ari,
you'd probably watch a lot of their set.

1098
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,340
I would,
yeah.

1099
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,990
That's the cool thing about when we do
the road together,

1100
00:51:23,991 --> 00:51:25,730
we watch each other.
Shit's fun.

1101
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,430
It's like I get to see a show and do a
show,

1102
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,810
you know?
It's fun.

1103
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:35,630
I love going to the stores and the back
and laughing me to one of my all time.

1104
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:38,730
Favorite things to get done a little
early,

1105
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:43,810
like your spots at 10 45 you get none.
They were 10 and you watch a few guys

1106
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:47,600
and it really gets you in the,
in the swing of things.

1107
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:48,061
I was like,
yeah,

1108
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:50,300
it really does get you going.
You know?

1109
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,950
But I don't want to sit there all night
either.

1110
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,990
Well that's a cool thing about the
store,

1111
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:55,040
Zoe.

1112
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,490
Some chose going on,
someone's three rooms can move around,

1113
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,300
watch a bunch of different shit.
I think that's a not to be taken

1114
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:03,920
lightly.
I think with anything.

1115
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,630
I think if you were,
um,

1116
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,130
you know,
if you are a knife maker,

1117
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,900
if you are really into making custom
knives,

1118
00:52:08,901 --> 00:52:10,940
you'd want to be around other dudes and
make those things.

1119
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,670
That's why they have those expos where
people get together and they,

1120
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,110
it's what he'd been up to,
man.

1121
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:16,430
What's going on here?
I mean,

1122
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,830
there's no nine man.
It's doing a stainless steel.

1123
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,930
Look at that.
There's a dude who,

1124
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:25,931
Anthony Bordain did this thing when he's
done these videos about people making

1125
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:29,330
shit.
This guy makes knives with metal from

1126
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:33,280
meteors.
Where does he get the meteors?

1127
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,940
Meteors like the fucking land on earth.
It can pick it up.

1128
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,110
Yeah,
you can buy them.

1129
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,670
And they're super expensive.

1130
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,120
So He's,
he's getting his iron from space.

1131
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:45,950
Look at this guy.
Whoa.

1132
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:50,270
Look at that fucking knife.
Come on dude to Kramer knife.

1133
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,780
This guy makes these things by hand who
can pull it's receiving and find the

1134
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:58,781
video cause it's fucking crazy.
He's got like this herth I guess that's

1135
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:00,440
what you call it,
right?

1136
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:03,290
What do you call it when you some sort
of an oven where he's baking these

1137
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:06,260
knives but with Bordain bordain is like
a,

1138
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:11,710
he's a real lover of craftsmanship.
So this is making these things sort of

1139
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:14,060
in a similar way to the way Samurais
made them.

1140
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:18,470
Well you have big plates of metal and
um,

1141
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,930
you,
you compress them and heat them up and

1142
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,900
smash them and get all the layers into
one layer.

1143
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,280
But it's all done with iron

1144
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,940
that he's getting from fucking media
right now.

1145
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,420
What's the difference between the IMF
and the media rights?

1146
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,040
Just,
it's cool.

1147
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,990
You could say it's from space.
It makes you,

1148
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,540
so it's not a strong iron or nothing
like that.

1149
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:39,210
It doesn't last.
I think I would,

1150
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:43,050
as far as I know,
I mean there's ways to harden iron and

1151
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:44,700
steel.
What survives coming.

1152
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:45,980
He'll actually,
you,

1153
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,270
we're talking about steel,
they're making steel,

1154
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,410
but I'm using the iron from space.
Uh,

1155
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:55,260
I don't think there's any benefit.
I think it's probably just really cool

1156
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:58,890
looking and awesome to say.
It's just fucking steal.

1157
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,120
I mean,
it is what it is,

1158
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:00,930
you know?
Right.

1159
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,310
Isn't that correct,
Jamie?

1160
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:03,163
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1161
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,120
Uh,
Captain America's shield that they got

1162
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:08,850
from the right.
Exactly.

1163
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,180
So this dude,
I think his name is Steve Kramer.

1164
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:13,980
Bob Kramer,
excuse me,

1165
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:19,010
Bob Kramer and Bob Kramer throws 'em
this giant chunk of metal and it's

1166
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:21,510
unbelievably hot oven.

1167
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:25,410
And then he pulls it out and then he
puts it in this machine and hammers it

1168
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:30,411
and he's just talking about all the
different methods of hardening steel and

1169
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,800
adding carbon and all the things that
they add during the process.

1170
00:54:34,801 --> 00:54:37,830
But it's crazy wild shit,
man.

1171
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,140
Leave that.
So he pulls out this

1172
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:46,500
orange and white glowing thing and they,
it pounds it down,

1173
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:52,550
so he takes it and all those layers get
smashed down into a thinner and thinner

1174
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:57,960
layer and it just keeps doing it over
and over again until it becomes like a

1175
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,380
blade.
It's wild shit man.

1176
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:06,560
So when it's down to being a blade,
that fucking thing is so compressed and

1177
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:10,740
smashed down.
Just really interesting shit.

1178
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,840
So what is the name of the video?
People want to watch it

1179
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,280
raw craft with Anthony Bordain.
He's got a bunch of these.

1180
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:19,520
He's done.
I don't know how the fuck that guy has

1181
00:55:19,521 --> 00:55:20,354
so much time.

1182
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,650
Just so much shit.
There's like a few of those guys where I

1183
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:30,210
feel lazy dude does personal speaking
gigs when eating out with their joint is

1184
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,213
pray,
leaves,

1185
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:34,080
pumpkin shoots a little bit of nature
bugs.

1186
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,290
Joe Dan was nature bucks,
never killed nobody.

1187
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:41,620
This guy's making fucking swords.
I mean that those guys want to be around

1188
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:44,100
each other.
You know like if you're making knives

1189
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:45,540
like that,
you're going to want to be around other

1190
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,840
people to make knives as well.
It's like we're the,

1191
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,090
one of the things about places like the
store is a,

1192
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:54,240
we can all meet each other and hang out
like the other night in the bar,

1193
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:59,250
like Stan Hope Ron White,
me bunch of us just hanging and I'm

1194
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,260
like,
well where's their place like this?

1195
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:06,261
Where we can meet like a s fucking
saloon where a fellow fellow travelers

1196
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:08,970
can meet.
I got to tell you something.

1197
00:56:08,971 --> 00:56:11,040
Run.
Why this really taken to the store?

1198
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:14,220
He has,
he's really taken to the store.

1199
00:56:14,221 --> 00:56:16,950
Like he's one of the guys and he gives
you a big hug.

1200
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:21,090
He's got a drink in his hand.
He's happy as fuck up there.

1201
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,340
He goes up there.
He the fucking room

1202
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,140
in a slow,
methodical way.

1203
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,750
But at first he would just stay back
there and go,

1204
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:31,840
what the fuck is this shit?
This ain't right.

1205
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:33,490
And yeah,
and I watched them.

1206
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:36,850
I've been watching him just become a guy
at the store.

1207
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,190
Yeah.
He's always in the back bar is always

1208
00:56:39,191 --> 00:56:41,590
hanging out with were bro.
He's always at a bar.

1209
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,590
If there's a bar open,
he's close by the way.

1210
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,570
Walking fucking with distance.
Okay.

1211
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:48,790
That guy's the real fucking deal.
Yeah,

1212
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,710
no,
he shows up with his own bottle and ice

1213
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,360
cubes.
We has his own brand.

1214
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,430
Right.
Tequila.

1215
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:59,230
What is it called again?
Get Fuck Gut something.

1216
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,890
That's what it's something won.
Something won.

1217
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,570
Fuck's it called
number one.

1218
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,860
Number one.
Yeah,

1219
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,180
that's it.
Number one.

1220
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:14,110
How racist number one.
Tequila Papa Ham.

1221
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,750
It's good shit.
It is really good shit.

1222
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,060
He had it at the meeting.
As far as that stuff goes,

1223
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:20,830
it all tastes like shit really.

1224
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,810
You know what I mean?
Let's be real.

1225
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,330
Even the best tasting Tequila tastes
like shit.

1226
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,150
The best tasting,
all that alcohol.

1227
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:31,070
I never get the people.
I sit wine,

1228
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:34,070
I started don't like wine.
I can drink a glass of wine.

1229
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:35,380
You know it's,
it's still alcohol.

1230
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,680
I still like Jack Daniels shot.
It tastes off as the shit out of me.

1231
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:43,270
It tastes like shit and I love it.
You know what you're talking about that

1232
00:57:43,271 --> 00:57:47,770
that I still remember I was a little boy
in New York City with my mom and I let

1233
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,040
leap for Joe Frazier.
Like I lived on 88th street.

1234
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:54,130
Like I still remember how big that event
was.

1235
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:56,590
Like if you asked me about events in New
York City,

1236
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:01,240
one is Muhammad Ali,
Joe Frazier to and the early seventies

1237
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:04,060
and Elton John came to New York City.
He fucked that city up.

1238
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:07,450
The captain,
fantastic and goodbye yellow brick road.

1239
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:09,220
When I was a kid,
he fucked up traffic.

1240
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,700
Michael Jackson,
fuck up traffic of 84 you know,

1241
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,490
he a couple of nights at the garden
then,

1242
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,830
but Mohammed Ali,
Joe Frazier,

1243
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:24,670
when I was a kid was fucking huge.
It was huge.

1244
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,310
I remember crying.
I wanted to watch it.

1245
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:29,100
I tried to get a blow job from my
babies,

1246
00:58:29,101 --> 00:58:32,020
so that was a kid.
She was a Puerto Rican chick named D.

1247
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,310
Dot.
And I kept asking about blowjobs.

1248
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,560
She goes,
I'll give you a blow job.

1249
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:39,790
So I gave her a bag filled with quarters
that I had and she came into the room

1250
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:42,580
and I took a shower.
I comb my hair,

1251
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:46,110
I put Cologne on,
and she came into the room and blue on

1252
00:58:46,111 --> 00:58:47,890
my stomach and said,
that's a blow job.

1253
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,890
And took my $20,
killed the dog.

1254
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:54,940
I cried myself to sleep that morning.
My mom,

1255
00:58:54,941 --> 00:58:56,530
I woke her up like,
I got to talk with you.

1256
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:00,320
My mom was like,
what is in broken English on my teeth

1257
00:59:00,321 --> 00:59:03,640
and stole my $20 and she said she was in
a suck my dick and she did.

1258
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,110
And my mom's like,
what are you talking about?

1259
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,380
What the fuck are you talking about?
You know,

1260
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:10,250
like six or seven.
What are you talking about man?

1261
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:14,740
I said I wanted a blow job.
I gave her $20 and then she took my 20

1262
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:16,170
hours.
I'm gonna fucking kill him mom.

1263
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,670
And my mom's like,
are you fucking crazy?

1264
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,680
Why would she suck?
Get deck with $20 you can get other box.

1265
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:25,900
Why would she suck you a little helmet
vic for $20 and shit you were,

1266
00:59:25,901 --> 00:59:27,740
how old is it?
Six seven.

1267
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:32,770
How old was she dairy too?
When did Muhammad Ali fight Joe Frazier?

1268
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,400
The first time?
71 maybe [inaudible] 71 I was probably

1269
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:40,100
eight
I was a little kid,

1270
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:41,900
man.
Your money.

1271
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,160
Oh my mom had to give me back the 20 I
made my mom get back to me.

1272
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:49,310
If mom gave it to you and my mom says,
what would it take to make this problem

1273
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:50,000
disappear?

1274
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,920
So she gave you 20 just to shut you up?
Yeah,

1275
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,980
cause she knew I would help her teeth
and asleep.

1276
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,010
I would kill it.
And the sleep,

1277
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:57,350
she was sleeping on the couch,
the babysitter fell asleep on the couch.

1278
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,770
This God,
you give me the $20 I'm going fucking

1279
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,000
killer right there.
Asleep.

1280
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,090
I was like are you fucking crazy?
I'll give you the 20 just leave Quito

1281
01:00:07,091 --> 01:00:09,260
alone.
I didn't talk to Peter for a year.

1282
01:00:09,261 --> 01:00:11,120
Doug,
she never talked to her again.

1283
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,070
When was it?
Yeah,

1284
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,310
one I was eight and she's ripping off
little kids.

1285
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,140
She was great though.
Data that group.

1286
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:19,460
Great.
Babysit this girl now.

1287
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,300
I didn't like my mom going out at night.
My mom had the bar so I would spend the

1288
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:26,810
whole day with my mom and then at night
you'd have to go to the fucking bar and

1289
01:00:26,811 --> 01:00:28,010
it would drive me crazy.

1290
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:29,360
Joe,
I want to go to the bar.

1291
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:30,980
Right.
You can't go to the bar.

1292
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:33,470
You go to school.
I don't give a fuck.

1293
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:38,240
Let me come protected size or weird.
I would fucking wait for it to get the

1294
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:42,890
Jersey and I cause a war and the house
and she'd have to get back in the car

1295
01:00:42,891 --> 01:00:45,770
and come over the 88th street.
Fuck me up,

1296
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:49,520
put me to sleep,
getting in bed with me and laid down.

1297
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,280
And then she would go back to the bar
and fucking close it.

1298
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,190
Hell man.
Hell.

1299
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:58,430
And then when we moved in Jersey,
I would call her up.

1300
01:00:58,431 --> 01:01:00,990
I was scared at night cause I thought
the house was haunted.

1301
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,950
So I would call her up and then you're
going to get down there.

1302
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,450
I'd be crying and shit.
Violence.

1303
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,790
You could just take a capital,
your friend's house asleep over there.

1304
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,680
There was a year I didn't sleep at my
house.

1305
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:12,020
You know,
really like a year when I was in the

1306
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:14,030
seventh grade,
I didn't sleep in my house.

1307
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,120
Never.
I would go there after school,

1308
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:18,650
get clothes.
I didn't go to my friends house and

1309
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:21,800
sleep there and lived there.
I was scared of fucking ghosts and shit.

1310
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,580
My grandparents insisted their house was
haunted data guy.

1311
01:01:27,581 --> 01:01:29,740
Uh,
during the 50s,

1312
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,970
who rented a room upstairs.
So local guy was a bachelor and he just

1313
01:01:33,971 --> 01:01:36,400
rented a room because um,
you know,

1314
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:39,920
people did that back then they were poor
and uh,

1315
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,640
that guy died.
I think he died while he's at the house.

1316
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:46,390
I don't remember.
But they insisted that the fucking guy

1317
01:01:46,391 --> 01:01:48,910
was still like walking around.
They'd hear him walk around.

1318
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:52,390
I lived there for months when I first
moved up to number and shit.

1319
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,670
Then I realized,
you know what a lot of that is

1320
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,740
people just get bored.
They want there to be a ghost.

1321
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,590
They want something crazy to be going on
their board.

1322
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:05,890
They don't have any excitement.
And so the only excitement is like being

1323
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:09,780
in that room in the dark and having
feelings about something.

1324
01:02:09,781 --> 01:02:10,614
It's not even real.

1325
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,610
Oh,
I feel something.

1326
01:02:12,611 --> 01:02:15,030
I feel presence.
I feel a presence.

1327
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,840
Something that's wrong,
that's wrong.

1328
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,320
We can get the fuck out of this room.
Oh,

1329
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,260
well,
nothing happened.

1330
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,970
It's just you're in the dark.
You're in the dark in an old house,

1331
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,530
but your board is,
fuck.

1332
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:28,350
That's what it is.
I don't know Joe.

1333
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:30,360
I don't know dog.
I lived in,

1334
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:35,361
I want the fucking house.
My mother bought this house in North

1335
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:36,301
Bergen,
New Jersey.

1336
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:39,930
I'm given that terrorists,
given that terrorist was originally to

1337
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:43,470
give it to that
which one kids die.

1338
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:47,880
Wouldn't parents die and kids go,
it was an orphanage to orphanage set

1339
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:51,870
fire
in the forties so they took Charles

1340
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:55,080
Court and given that terrorist and build
it over this orphanage.

1341
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,820
There was an article about it on
facebook about six months ago,

1342
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,620
but the whole given that terrorist
fucking spooky shit.

1343
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:03,300
Yeah.
So in that house,

1344
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:04,150
my mother bought him.

1345
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,920
The reason why my mom,
my mom got in that with the alias was

1346
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:11,190
because who came in with a heavy cash
and the guy killed himself in the

1347
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:13,620
garage.
All right.

1348
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,370
The,
I hung himself in the fucking 60 so

1349
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:20,280
skids was selling the fucking house.
Well we didn't know about this.

1350
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:23,990
I never knew about this til years later.
Once we moved in Lima.

1351
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,590
In the beginning I was going to Catholic
school,

1352
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:29,430
so I only slept her on the weekends.
Once I moved in full time.

1353
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:32,370
Like in the sixth and seventh grade was
when I would hear that goes to at night

1354
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,830
and went Jan,
I would hit them coming up the fucking

1355
01:03:34,831 --> 01:03:36,930
status and shit and I would cry and
yell.

1356
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,240
Right.
So they sent me to the Santa Maria

1357
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,090
Lady's House and she told me to put a
glass of water under my bed with a red

1358
01:03:42,091 --> 01:03:45,210
towel on the top and I would sleep
better,

1359
01:03:45,211 --> 01:03:47,070
but I would still do your fucking noises
at night.

1360
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:48,120
I was fucking then,
that's all.

1361
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:51,280
That's spooky shit.
Now do you remember when we did Tom

1362
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,960
[inaudible] years ago and my friend
called girl with y'all.

1363
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:56,730
We and I want to get coca.
Okay.

1364
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:02,180
Her brother died on that block when he
was 1615 he died on that block.

1365
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:07,620
This is silly ones.
And if you think Cuban people are creepy

1366
01:04:07,621 --> 01:04:10,950
with this Santa Rita and shit,
nobody's creepier than old school

1367
01:04:10,951 --> 01:04:13,950
Sicilians.
I mean she broke it down.

1368
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:15,090
She kept telling me,
I told him,

1369
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:17,970
my husband,
Sicilians don't live on dead end streets

1370
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,870
because they're bad luck.
Like they broke.

1371
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:23,840
Like when I see them now,
they still fly out here,

1372
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,190
especially house and coming on.
The streets are bad luck.

1373
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,390
Oh yeah.
The Sicilians,

1374
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:31,260
I mean she's an old school Sicilian that
she took the fish,

1375
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:35,760
the eyes from fishers to help people see
better help people.

1376
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:39,690
You ever see the movie sleepers?
You ever see the movie sleepers?

1377
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,140
Which movies are sleepers heads explode?
No.

1378
01:04:43,141 --> 01:04:44,060
No.
Let's scanners.

1379
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:48,020
The fucking heads explode.
This is about 24 kids who rob up,

1380
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,470
hot dog man.
And my mistake,

1381
01:04:49,471 --> 01:04:51,890
a guy dies and they send them to a jail
who was in,

1382
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,740
uh,
look all star cast.

1383
01:04:56,250 --> 01:05:01,200
Brad Pitt was the priest.
I do go book is a lot better.

1384
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:03,990
The movies suck because they put too
many stars in the movie.

1385
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,720
Too many.
But that's about store fucking kids that

1386
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:09,780
gets sent to an orphanage and they get
beat up or whatever the fuck it is.

1387
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,690
But before that they go to work for my
boss.

1388
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:17,860
If you've ever watched any of mafia
movie every month and blows the

1389
01:05:17,861 --> 01:05:18,694
characters.

1390
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:23,560
The only mobster that was ever any good
in any Italian movie beside Marlon

1391
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,560
Brando was the guy that played the
mobster and this movie put,

1392
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:31,480
see if he could fly asleep as King Benny
King Manny was a bad motherfucker.

1393
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,270
He wasn't Italian Act that they
recruited to come all week.

1394
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:38,080
I didn't even speak that good English.
Wait till you see the king batty boy

1395
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:42,220
king baddies explained to him that he
takes the eyeballs to this lady for

1396
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:45,900
headaches.
When I was a kid looking at King Betty

1397
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,600
King Benny is a bad mobile fuck.
Both

1398
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:57,050
a King Benny has to go deal with fucking
brother's in Harlem and the guy says to

1399
01:05:58,991 --> 01:06:01,630
a man,
but you said this movie sucks dot movies

1400
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:04,970
or five but him,
as you know,

1401
01:06:04,971 --> 01:06:06,610

You're Chubby Buddy,

1402
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:09,220
the guy you did softball with that Mike
Star?

1403
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:12,910
No,
the Spanish kid that you did that series

1404
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:14,140
with,
he was a Spanish kid.

1405
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,530
Lombardi Puerto Rico or Puerto Rican
get,

1406
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,850
Oh,
I know who you're talking about.

1407
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,060
He played that well,
he was last seen from that.

1408
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,540
See if he was in last.
No,

1409
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:24,940
no,
no.

1410
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,710
The kid,
the Spanish gay plays fat.

1411
01:06:26,711 --> 01:06:27,544
Moncho.

1412
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,460
Hmm.
So you have to have the scene from

1413
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:32,520
sleep.
Is it the black guy when the black guy

1414
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,710
says to him,
see if they have a scene from a movie

1415
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:35,544
that sucks.
No,

1416
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:35,771
no,
no,

1417
01:06:35,771 --> 01:06:36,091
no,

1418
01:06:36,091 --> 01:06:36,341
no,

1419
01:06:36,341 --> 01:06:36,930
no,
no.

1420
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:37,940
He says to them,
God,

1421
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:41,520
look at you.
You bring style to the game.

1422
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:43,530
The Italian guy goes,
I can not help.

1423
01:06:43,531 --> 01:06:44,790
You.
Might Tailor is dead.

1424
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:47,880
I mean,
this guy has got lines and this fucking

1425
01:06:47,881 --> 01:06:50,160
movie and they never talk.
He died years later,

1426
01:06:50,161 --> 01:06:51,870
like they were saying,
who the fuck is this guy?

1427
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:57,320
The guy is just a monster.
Just my point is not about fucking

1428
01:06:57,451 --> 01:07:00,960
sleepers or the fucking guy.
What's the point?

1429
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,350
I have no idea.
I'm seeing going.

1430
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,750
I'm like,
I wonder how he's going to be talking

1431
01:07:06,751 --> 01:07:10,740
about what we're talking about.
We're talking about for kids and shit.

1432
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:11,574
Like,
Whoa,

1433
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,920
oh,
this is silly.

1434
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:17,640
Are we talking about bad luck blogs?
They just have a spooky beliefs.

1435
01:07:17,641 --> 01:07:21,450
So they came to me years later and was
telling me all about this block.

1436
01:07:21,451 --> 01:07:22,620
How,
how many people had,

1437
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,470
I had had bad luck on that block after
that.

1438
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:28,080
Like the,
the maloneys died from cancer.

1439
01:07:28,081 --> 01:07:30,180
The both of them,
you know the parents,

1440
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:34,140
the old rocks died from cancer.
The girl across the street died in a car

1441
01:07:34,141 --> 01:07:35,610
accident.
Raul,

1442
01:07:35,611 --> 01:07:38,130
I just robbed him.
Raul and his family.

1443
01:07:38,131 --> 01:07:41,130
I just took a stereo and they wouldn't
let him in my fucking bedroom for years.

1444
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:44,250
How do you rob some of these houses?
And I hung out with the kid cause he is

1445
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:46,680
later we became friends while they were
moving in.

1446
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:49,750
I robbed Raul and his family and I took
the stereo.

1447
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,350
Some kid took the fucking desk.
It was amazing.

1448
01:07:52,351 --> 01:07:53,900
And that would be talked to him anymore.
Rau,

1449
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:57,450
old learner all ended up fucking moving
to the bronx in the eighth grade.

1450
01:07:57,451 --> 01:07:59,490
Over night they left.
They owed money on the rent.

1451
01:07:59,491 --> 01:08:01,770
So,
but he would come through my house and

1452
01:08:01,771 --> 01:08:03,030
go,
can't we go to your room and listened to

1453
01:08:03,031 --> 01:08:04,060
this time.
It a good idea.

1454
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,680
Hilarious.

1455
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:12,680
Yeah.

1456
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,140
Terrible.
Do you ever look back on your past?

1457
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,490
Go,
how the fuck did I become like an

1458
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:20,510
upstanding citizen?
How did I become a regular person last

1459
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:22,580
night I was telling him these stories,
so that was shaking.

1460
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,280
Well,
I remember when I first met you,

1461
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,520
you were always a great guy,
but you will,

1462
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,540
you are way more dangerous like you
were.

1463
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,450
You're a dangerous person.
You could do,

1464
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,570
you could do some ridiculous shit.
You A,

1465
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:38,630
you were very volatile.
There's a part of me that's a very,

1466
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:43,310
very nice law abiding person that really
is as a part of me,

1467
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:45,620
that's always one of the try to be a
nice person,

1468
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:50,060
but there's a part of me that does not
comprehend a part of human behavior

1469
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,950
because it would not be alive.
I was raised by no means at all.

1470
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:57,980
What do you mean?
It's just stupid human behavior that I

1471
01:08:57,981 --> 01:08:59,450
see everyday now I wouldn't know.

1472
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:03,620
I say acceptable and how I was raised or
how the people like rub her work.

1473
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:07,520
So when I look at that on behavior,
my head explodes.

1474
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:12,890
I really can't handle it and I didn't.
I got a beaten when I was 19.

1475
01:09:12,891 --> 01:09:15,770
That was such a great beaten.
It was worse than the one that been on

1476
01:09:15,771 --> 01:09:20,060
Hopkins put on Felix Tryna dread.
And that's the day I made my decision,

1477
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:23,020
my hand to hand combat days room like,
God,

1478
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:27,140
I don't need this shit in my world.
If you come into my world and get

1479
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,910
disrespectful,
I'm going to hit you with a weapon.

1480
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:30,560
I'm gonna hit you with a chair or a
bottle.

1481
01:09:30,561 --> 01:09:33,290
I threw a lot of bottles in the store,
a couple of glasses.

1482
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,790
He definitely throw some shit at the
store.

1483
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:38,330
I don't fuck around with people because
I don't like people fucking with me.

1484
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:40,460
I'm really sensitive.
I don't know how to handle it.

1485
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:41,870
But see,
I think it's,

1486
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,260
it's one of the things we're talking
about when we were talking about um,

1487
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,610
um,
p people who go to war and how they get

1488
01:09:49,611 --> 01:09:53,030
addicted to that feeling and then it's
almost like,

1489
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:55,460
um,
like that becomes their world.

1490
01:09:55,461 --> 01:09:56,370
Right.
Well,

1491
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:01,070
I almost feel like with,
with some people they become,

1492
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:05,690
they become like real addicted to like
bad situations.

1493
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:10,750
I was get addicted to drama is drama.
Like you don't know how to handle life

1494
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:17,420
if there's no drama in your life.
There was times I would rob Joe Rogan

1495
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:22,040
knowing that Joe Rogan knew I was on the
rob and my state of mind was not what,

1496
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:28,240
not what not what
you'd cause and they just,

1497
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,850
I didn't know how to live without the
swirl of danger,

1498
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:33,680
you know,
and let's be honest,

1499
01:10:33,681 --> 01:10:36,500
the last 10 years I did blow and not
because of an addiction.

1500
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:41,240
The last 10 years I did blow up because
I was addicted to that state of mind

1501
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,390
were always,
you were always in need of something.

1502
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:49,040
The thrill was going to get the coat and
driving them with the coke in the car.

1503
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:50,630
Yeah.
That's something that you,

1504
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:54,350
when you told me that it was the first
time anybody's ever articulated it that

1505
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:56,420
way,
like what you are addicted to was not

1506
01:10:56,421 --> 01:11:00,000
even necessarily the drug.
It's the whole thing.

1507
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:05,020
The driving and little danger of danger.
Police going to the guy's place to buy

1508
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:06,260
it,
the cop,

1509
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:09,230
everything.
I would look at myself after snoring at

1510
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,410
two three in the morning and see this
person I didn't even recognize in the

1511
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:14,100
mirror.
I wouldn't even want to look

1512
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,920
at them cause I was so ashamed that I
let that position take over my mind.

1513
01:11:18,921 --> 01:11:21,600
It wasn't the fact of the call or the
whatever.

1514
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,060
Are they getting my dick sucked or
they're doing dirty things.

1515
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:29,660
It was the fact that drive and fronting
it and all the scamming that went what?

1516
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,750
And somebody told me when I got locked
up,

1517
01:11:33,751 --> 01:11:35,680
they said,
you think of all the time you put into

1518
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:40,700
scams thinking that you put that time
into doing something on a positive level

1519
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:44,340
it,
there's no surprise that my life has

1520
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:48,900
changed as much as I did without the
drugs because 60% of your mental state

1521
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,390
was always in those drugs.
Don't matter.

1522
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:55,440
For the other 40 was in comedy.
The other 37 wasn't comedy and the other

1523
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:57,420
three was in God knows what the fuck it
was.

1524
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:02,750
But 60% of your day is dominated by that
addiction or whatever drives you and was

1525
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,060
some people,
they've described it as like the

1526
01:12:06,061 --> 01:12:10,200
addiction and having that addiction was
like almost like a built in excuse to

1527
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:13,110
not live up to their full potential in
anything to try and do.

1528
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,190
Absolutely.
You.

1529
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:17,690
Oh well for starters it's not,
it's,

1530
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:22,730
it's the personal blame.
You want that just in case if you fail,

1531
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,030
you always have a fucking excuse.
Well,

1532
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,620
what'd you expect?
I was having those problems those years.

1533
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:30,630
You didn't have any problem having a
problem is when,

1534
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:32,700
uh,
you know,

1535
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:36,240
you get fucking shingled floor or your
family member has cancer.

1536
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:41,010
That's a problem that happens in life.
The coke and all that shit is your own

1537
01:12:41,011 --> 01:12:42,670
men.
Men made dilemma.

1538
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:44,850
Are you with me?
Like these are the things you create,

1539
01:12:44,851 --> 01:12:47,010
all these things you create.
You know,

1540
01:12:47,011 --> 01:12:51,420
I think about that last year I did blow,
I was ready to call 60 minutes.

1541
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,000
Like I think of this state of mind right
now.

1542
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,810
Like I had already a pitch for 60
minutes to explain to them that I had

1543
01:12:57,811 --> 01:13:02,811
found the cure for cocaine.
That if you do heroin on Mondays just a

1544
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:06,390
little bit,
you will not snort the rest of the week.

1545
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,970
Like I was really going to put 60
minutes.

1546
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:11,100
I was going to get an agent and go to
CBS and go,

1547
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:13,140
listen,
I got a groundbreaking idea.

1548
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:16,260
There's no reason for rehabs.
We'll get that white powder.

1549
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:17,640
You motherfuckers are going to war for
it

1550
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,900
and we'll get that little white poppy
seed.

1551
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:24,870
We'll make it into some pill and we'll
get people high on Monday cause the rest

1552
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:26,160
of the week.
I didn't want to get high.

1553
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:31,560
How crazy that I was doing heroin on a
Monday and it wouldn't let me do coke

1554
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:33,740
the rest of the week.
I look forward to Mondays.

1555
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:36,480
Fuck CSI Miami.
Why only Monday?

1556
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:38,280
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1557
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:43,170
I have no fucking idea.
That was just the guy that was just a

1558
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:44,710
snorting it.
Yeah,

1559
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,720
snoring at two little lines of heroin
just to get me out.

1560
01:13:47,721 --> 01:13:49,530
And what does it do?
Like what's the feeling?

1561
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,810
Hit?
Tell me what it feels like when it hits

1562
01:13:51,811 --> 01:13:54,120
you.
Well,

1563
01:13:54,121 --> 01:13:57,010
it takes a couple of minutes to hit you
and you feel this weird thing and then

1564
01:13:57,011 --> 01:14:01,540
you feel like your blood pressure going
up and you feel like this euphoric

1565
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:04,410
warmth.
You feel like this fucking warmth.

1566
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:07,600
I felt like my body.
Do you ever take a wet shit?

1567
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:12,400
It's warm and you could see if you shit
outside steams gonna come out of it.

1568
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:14,890
That's what your body feels like that
warm.

1569
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:16,960
And then I would get an urge to puke

1570
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,950
for a couple of minutes.
I would gag and Puke a little bit would

1571
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:23,360
come out of yellow and then after I
puked a little bit,

1572
01:14:23,361 --> 01:14:28,361
I would just go into this state of
fucking Mona's for four hours.

1573
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:33,611
It was like smoking in because all day
and like just sitting there smoking

1574
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:36,590
cigarettes,
looking at a window and I'd make believe

1575
01:14:36,591 --> 01:14:41,591
I was writing John Lennon type lyrics to
jokes until I looked at them the next

1576
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,540
day.
This brilliance about a refrigerator.

1577
01:14:44,541 --> 01:14:49,040
Like I remember writing a bit about a
refrigerator once and looking at it the

1578
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,300
next day and say thank God,
thank God I never tried it.

1579
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:54,080
You know what I'm saying?
Like little things like just,

1580
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,010
well that was hedbergs drug of choice
and his jokes,

1581
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:00,840
man.
I mean

1582
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,310
it's,
I think he's probably the best

1583
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:08,140
nonsequitor joke I ever because all his
jokes are unrelated.

1584
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:09,970
It's like,
here's a non sequitur.

1585
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,860
Here's some other things I was thinking
about.

1586
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:14,680
Here's something I thought,
here's how I saw.

1587
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:17,080
And it was like I was listening to it
the other day.

1588
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:20,350
He was like,
half of his jokes were only funny

1589
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:23,290
because he was saying them,
you know?

1590
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,120
But they were hilarious like he had,
he had a way of doing it that was kind

1591
01:15:28,121 --> 01:15:30,700
of like heroin comedy,
you know,

1592
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,970
you be messed up during the week or no.
Ooh.

1593
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:38,840
Ah.
It takes me a day to recover.

1594
01:15:38,841 --> 01:15:41,810
On Tuesdays I'd be out,
I didn't say nothing to nobody.

1595
01:15:41,811 --> 01:15:44,810
I was doing the heroin and I wasn't
doing coke.

1596
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,890
It was really fun.
So you would be like sober Thursday,

1597
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:50,300
Friday,
Saturday.

1598
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,760
And then he'd look forward to the big
bump on Monday.

1599
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:53,594
Yeah.
That kid,

1600
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:56,680
he used to send it to me.
He used to send me $7 bags.

1601
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:58,760
What kid?
His name was a bonehead.

1602
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:01,340
He died from an old date.
How weird.

1603
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:05,750
Yeah,
figure that was going to live forever.

1604
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:08,140
I knew own head.
I knew bonehead from Ohio.

1605
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:10,990
My rest and peace loss bone had broken
the taste.

1606
01:16:10,991 --> 01:16:13,250
Some of my bone had boneheaded was like
your boy.

1607
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,130
He was.
I could go into a room with 90

1608
01:16:16,131 --> 01:16:17,950
motherfuckers and bone that little like
a date.

1609
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,020
That bonus was a bad motherfucker dog.

1610
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:22,760
I love bump bonding.
Her three brothers,

1611
01:16:22,761 --> 01:16:24,760
I love Dalton,
but bone.

1612
01:16:24,761 --> 01:16:27,770
That was two of the brothers were very
successful.

1613
01:16:27,771 --> 01:16:30,950
I believe in not bonehead was successful
as a plumber.

1614
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,130
He has his own company.
He only went to crazy at night bone.

1615
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:38,720
That bone it when I was 17 would take me
to mcsorley's hell house in New York

1616
01:16:38,721 --> 01:16:40,820
City.
Don't want Id.

1617
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:44,550
He called the bartender.
I'm going to give them three mugs of

1618
01:16:44,551 --> 01:16:48,420
beer and give him three mugs or be and
give them a bowl of Chili mug.

1619
01:16:48,421 --> 01:16:51,890
Ed would take 10 bucks for the both of
us and he'd go to Washington Square Park

1620
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:56,810
and he'd come back and he'd give me a
balance and by the meantime he would go

1621
01:16:56,811 --> 01:17:00,680
by his heroin and they buy these mixture
of pills and even melt them to the black

1622
01:17:00,681 --> 01:17:04,280
and whites.
They take us to a strip club in New

1623
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,610
Jersey or something and they'd take us
home and the next day,

1624
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,550
seven in the morning,
they'd strip this.

1625
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:14,540
There's bone head in the fucking in the
fucking a plumbing van up.

1626
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:16,490
And Dan that he was a functioning
addict.

1627
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:19,280
He wasn't like your regular,
there's a lot of those guys out there.

1628
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:24,281
And he had a chick
that was a 13 bailey,

1629
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:28,850
she was half Asian,
half Irish.

1630
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:33,230
Good.
They used to do heroin together and

1631
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:34,520
they'd pass out in the living room.
Wait,

1632
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:37,160
fuck.
And they both go to sleep and then I'd

1633
01:17:37,161 --> 01:17:39,860
be in the bedroom cause I just moved
that were bonus family.

1634
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:43,010
Okay.
They were Italian Bro.

1635
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,160
They were real fucking Italians and I,
the mother used to,

1636
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:48,590
the mother was the first person who ever
made me an that grant.

1637
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:51,800
She was a little Irish chicken.
She said that she used to say the word

1638
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:55,130
Earl,
she couldn't say oil and she was the

1639
01:17:55,131 --> 01:17:58,880
bookkeeper for union 52 whatever the
teamsters,

1640
01:17:58,881 --> 01:17:59,900
the Labor is unit.

1641
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,810
You know,
I was over there one day when I was 16

1642
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:03,800
she goes,
you got a book,

1643
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,680
not walk me to work tomorrow.
Get your book.

1644
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:09,400
You could stop fucking being a hottie.
So I,

1645
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:14,410
you know like a hod carrier,
like hod carrier for brick masons.

1646
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:17,000
And she goes,
I can get you with the Italians over by

1647
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:18,500
the brick mason cause she was from
hoboken.

1648
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:21,230
So she got me a book.
I financed that.

1649
01:18:21,231 --> 01:18:24,260
She got a loan shark to finance it.
I loved these people.

1650
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:26,060
This is,
if I'm thinking of Mike,

1651
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,410
I don't like doing documentaries,
but I needed to do a documentary about

1652
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:33,550
this family because it's the rise and
fall of it in American families.

1653
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:37,880
I saw before my eyes as a child,
I went over there and ate with them.

1654
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:40,220
You know,
I hung out with all three brothers by

1655
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:41,054
the way.

1656
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,450
Like I wasn't just friends or bone had I
not with Chrissy fish.

1657
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,840
And I hung out with the little,
whatever his name was,

1658
01:18:47,841 --> 01:18:51,830
but bonehead was my nighttime guy.
Bonehead used to take me into the murky

1659
01:18:51,831 --> 01:18:55,880
waters of the underworld.
He could get me guns are shooting of the

1660
01:18:55,881 --> 01:18:59,150
medium.
Brother was a drug dealer in the 80s and

1661
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:01,640
he drunk.
He sold big times coke and he used to

1662
01:19:01,641 --> 01:19:03,800
buy jewelry.
He used to put them in the tackle box.

1663
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:06,920
So one night me and the younger brother
in the bed,

1664
01:19:06,921 --> 01:19:10,870
sleep and bone had comes in to borrow
money from us because he was going to

1665
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,950
this.
They get heroin and he goes and I go

1666
01:19:12,951 --> 01:19:14,320
bone it.
I got to go to the back of the time,

1667
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:17,090
the money on me.
He went into his brother's room and

1668
01:19:17,091 --> 01:19:19,430
instead of his brother was sleeping,
the drug dealer,

1669
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:22,960
instead of just opening up the tackle
box and taking $40 down,

1670
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:27,970
he took the whole tackle box and it has
40,000 in cash and the other 30 and

1671
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:29,930
jewelry,
he went to the Bronx.

1672
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:34,030
These are the best times of my life.
Once you go by comrade,

1673
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:37,790
this is the best time,
like your war stories,

1674
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,480
and he thought the house was haunted.
This was not a haunted house at all.

1675
01:19:41,481 --> 01:19:45,410
These people were decent Italian people.
Dad was a longshoreman and the mom was

1676
01:19:45,411 --> 01:19:48,620
in charge of the teamsters union and
they hung out with westies.

1677
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,800
They hung out with the fucking,
the mother was friends with this dude

1678
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:55,820
that was a a whatever for the West East
and he used to get me jobs.

1679
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,070
He would get me jobs.
Casing joints.

1680
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,260
You know when you have a summer job?
Nah.

1681
01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:01,390
He would tell me,
come in,

1682
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,250
I want you to go in that warehouse.
I'm going to give you 200 and they're

1683
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:07,740
going to give you one 80 I want you to
go in that warehouse and write down all

1684
01:20:07,741 --> 01:20:11,790
the alarms and Tommy where the safe is,
who walks around the safe and he would

1685
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:12,624
pay me money.

1686
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:15,270
This is a great house,
old school,

1687
01:20:15,271 --> 01:20:16,730
Italian house,
but back the bone,

1688
01:20:16,731 --> 01:20:19,260
that bone,
it has the fishing tackle box.

1689
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:21,540
He's about to go upstairs to buy heroin
and shoot it.

1690
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,800
He puts the tackle box and the garbage
can in front of the building and puts a

1691
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:28,110
lid on it.
When he's upstairs shooting heroin,

1692
01:20:28,111 --> 01:20:33,111
the garbage bin come and they'd take the
40 large with the 30,000 and fucking

1693
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:36,840
jewelry
to understand me.

1694
01:20:36,841 --> 01:20:38,580
I mean,
this was nonstop.

1695
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:40,860
Another night,
boneheaded came home high on heroin.

1696
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:45,560
He decided to make French fries.
So he put the pot out better than they

1697
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:49,500
remember in the 80s they had those pots.
You could bring it home with the hot oil

1698
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:52,100
and they would boil and you can throw
French fries.

1699
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,510
America went crazy over him.
I forgot what they were.

1700
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,220
Praised everybody,
French fry machines.

1701
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,110
Everybody was making an onion rings and
shit.

1702
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,670
Well,
he did the heroin and not up and it at

1703
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:02,790
the thing went on fire.
We're of course,

1704
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,380
we're all on the fucking house.
Oh,

1705
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:05,400
Jesus.
All right.

1706
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:09,300
I went to boil.
I wake up to buy boom and alarms and

1707
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,940
awesome.
Kurt's waking me up and we'd go out of

1708
01:21:11,941 --> 01:21:15,540
the house and the father's outside and
the grandmother and the fire department

1709
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:18,790
crawls on top of the roof.
Joe when they hit the fucking roof to

1710
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,590
let the smoke out and fire trucks are
coming from the side lane ward and they

1711
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:24,730
got the sirens in the middle of all
this,

1712
01:21:24,731 --> 01:21:26,460
the tate in the morning and we all look
around and go,

1713
01:21:26,461 --> 01:21:29,070
oh my God,
Emile still in the house.

1714
01:21:29,071 --> 01:21:32,100
Bonehead was still in the house on fire,
Bro.

1715
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,950
They turn the fire off,
they go in and he's still with his feet

1716
01:21:34,951 --> 01:21:35,784
up.

1717
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:41,500
When his hands draw just heroin.
Dad of his mind,

1718
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,470
he slept through the fire.
Oh my God.

1719
01:21:45,471 --> 01:21:47,030
Everything.
When they woke up,

1720
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:52,320
he goes on my fries.
This is how crazy this family was.

1721
01:21:56,390 --> 01:22:01,380
We have to fucking battalions out there.
We got half of nine 11 out.

1722
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:05,810
You still fucking sleeping.
Oh my God.

1723
01:22:05,811 --> 01:22:08,990
It burned the house down.
Burn the fucking kitchen down and have

1724
01:22:08,991 --> 01:22:10,970
the bedroom.
They had to move to a hotel for six

1725
01:22:10,971 --> 01:22:12,510
months and they had [inaudible] the
grandmother

1726
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,190
downstairs,
it was old school Italian,

1727
01:22:14,191 --> 01:22:16,070
but she couldn't smell.
So we Kinda,

1728
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,000
we smoked pot.
We'd just go down there and blow smoke

1729
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:21,600
in her face and grandma would pass out
in the wheelchair and that was the end

1730
01:22:21,601 --> 01:22:22,830
that,
I mean it didn't stop.

1731
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:27,540
It didn't stop genes.
So this is why you get mad at people for

1732
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:30,750
binge watching stuff on Netflix and this
is what you were talking about.

1733
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,060
I get mad at everything.
What are you going to bother me for?

1734
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:36,510
I get mad when people like he used to
hide the coke.

1735
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:40,500
The medium brother used to hide the coke
under his car and I'd be walking down

1736
01:22:40,501 --> 01:22:42,780
the hill and I can see a little
container and that he didn't even have a

1737
01:22:42,781 --> 01:22:45,450
Maserati.
What's the other Italian call?

1738
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,630
This is how much of a guineas these
motherfuckers were.

1739
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:52,230
What's the other Italian car like you
said?

1740
01:22:52,231 --> 01:22:54,140
The avanti Avanti.
Oh,

1741
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,110
okay.
I remember those.

1742
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,700
Remember that piece of shit that was a
piece of shows up pieces of shit.

1743
01:22:58,701 --> 01:23:02,040
And you show me a piece of carbon trust
to anything Italian.

1744
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,170
Oh my God.
That was the,

1745
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:06,130
he tried to sell it to me once.
It like 20

1746
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,880
I give it to you for two grants.
Yeah.

1747
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:09,610
I drive it down.
The corner blows up.

1748
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,450
Like I feel like if you buy a Ferrari,
I feel like if you drive that thing,

1749
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:16,480
it's going to fall apart.
I'm black.

1750
01:23:16,481 --> 01:23:18,430
I like,
I trust German cars,

1751
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:20,620
you know,
I don't trust people like me making

1752
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:23,750
cars.
What's the other one?

1753
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,210
The other one that Lamborghini is that
tally those things fall apart?

1754
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,700
Do they really guarantee you just look
at them.

1755
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:32,160
There's no way that starts the ugliest
fucking call.

1756
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:34,920
And it was actually Lamborghini's don't
wound by Audi,

1757
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:38,340
so who knows?
They might be like much better

1758
01:23:38,341 --> 01:23:41,130
engineered now I'm talking shit
obviously.

1759
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:42,580
Okay.

1760
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:44,460
I don't know that much about things
other than uh,

1761
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:48,040
I know a lot about porsches,
but there's a lot of cars I don't

1762
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:49,150
understand about,
but God,

1763
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:51,160
those things are disgusting.
The avanti,

1764
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:56,280
when a piece of shit disgusting sought
us out to me for two grand 30 look at

1765
01:23:56,621 --> 01:23:58,420
that thing.
It's crazy.

1766
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:01,930
Lamborghinis or like the biggest like
here's my Dick Carr.

1767
01:24:01,931 --> 01:24:03,870
You can get right.
That's the closet.

1768
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:05,890
I,
they had the doors open up sideways.

1769
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:09,250
You walk out of that naked.
Like,

1770
01:24:09,251 --> 01:24:11,440
if I had that car,
just walk on with my dick out.

1771
01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:14,860
Like what bitches put up $20 bills as
you go.

1772
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:17,860
I can get a mic jock strap.
Oh,

1773
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:22,660
your boys sent this.to Syrah.
Sent this fanny packs.

1774
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,790
Oh really?
I got my fanny pack to the Brim with

1775
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:27,590
Reed.
He's got giant fanny pack.

1776
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,540
Those are great for anybody and they fit
me the way really good for the travel on

1777
01:24:31,541 --> 01:24:31,880
the road.

1778
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,640
You can get a lot of stuff and um,
yeah,

1779
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,230
no,
no,

1780
01:24:34,230 --> 01:24:36,890
that's true.
You glasses your license and your

1781
01:24:36,891 --> 01:24:38,170
passport.
Oh yeah.

1782
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:43,380
Well you don't have my plane tickets.
Canadians.

1783
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:46,420
They have to come down to America to see
you and they have a great time.

1784
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,310
Don't get me wrong.
It's a road trip.

1785
01:24:48,311 --> 01:24:50,350
That's what I do in Buffalo.
Buffalo,

1786
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:52,840
Toledo.
I tried to really give me money for

1787
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,920
Seattle,
Detroit,

1788
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:55,960
Detroit.
I do grand harbor,

1789
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,280
grand rapids,
grand rapids.

1790
01:24:57,281 --> 01:24:58,900
I'm trying to get the handle on it,
but next year.

1791
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:01,330
And I remember we did that once.
Did I do that?

1792
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:02,920
I did that once with,
uh,

1793
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:06,220
I think Ari,
I ain't no harbor back in the day.

1794
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:09,050
That's a college town,
right?

1795
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:11,620
The comedy club down there yet.
You did it with something.

1796
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:12,483
Yeah.
Yeah.

1797
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,670
Oh,
I did it with the girl.

1798
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:16,190
You came back and told me to call you
like gold called them.

1799
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:17,570
Yeah.
Fun People.

1800
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:19,820
Fun.
Fucking club fun.

1801
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,220
Yeah.
There's some good spots where people can

1802
01:25:22,221 --> 01:25:24,110
come down.
The Canadians can come down like,

1803
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:25,520
well,
he can't do Seattle either.

1804
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:32,830
Ugh.
I can't do,

1805
01:25:32,831 --> 01:25:37,090
I know who he is.
The word fucking tear Seattle apart.

1806
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:40,240
So sad he can't get into Washington
state.

1807
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:43,000
There's still breaking my balls too.
Can you work that out?

1808
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,640
I thought you already had that almost
two years ago.

1809
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:48,310
You don't want men,
they want a bunch of cash and they still

1810
01:25:48,311 --> 01:25:50,350
want me to go up there and surrender
myself,

1811
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:52,840
so fuck all that.
I'm not surrendering myself.

1812
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:56,740
I ain't fucking surrendering yourself.
What does that even mean?

1813
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:00,310
Come on in and turn yourself in and
we'll put you through the process.

1814
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:02,500
12 hours in the holding thing and I
shit,

1815
01:26:02,501 --> 01:26:04,010
that ain't going

1816
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:06,170
to King County fucking jail for that
shit.

1817
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:10,310
12 hours in a holding tank.
It's not like you're some threat to

1818
01:26:10,311 --> 01:26:12,170
society.
Why do they have to put you in a holding

1819
01:26:12,171 --> 01:26:14,750
tank?
What kind of weird formality is that?

1820
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,730
Like sorry,
we have to cuff you.

1821
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:20,270
Well wait a minute.
You know I'm not and I have no failure

1822
01:26:20,271 --> 01:26:22,730
to appears like I've,
I've always gone to court.

1823
01:26:22,731 --> 01:26:24,140
I never,
I don't have a failure.

1824
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,760
I even went to court with an alias.
Like I used an alias one time when I got

1825
01:26:28,761 --> 01:26:30,320
arrested,
that's the class I got.

1826
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,620
I covered the spread.
When they arrested me,

1827
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:36,290
I gave him like Joe Rogan's name and not
so you wouldn't get a warrant.

1828
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,790
I went down and did the 16 hours
community service in the age of unit

1829
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,770
painting for the age people.
So next time you look at me and tell him

1830
01:26:42,771 --> 01:26:45,230
he ain't got no fucking character,
think of that.

1831
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,720
And 10 years later I go to eat dinner
with that guy and he's like,

1832
01:26:47,721 --> 01:26:49,610
can I have a Tan?
I got pulled over and I had a warrant in

1833
01:26:49,611 --> 01:26:50,444
Colorado.
I got,

1834
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,180
we got the rest of them Colorado for
shoplifting.

1835
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:55,160
No Way.
I just kept eating my fucking meal

1836
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,800
but at least he didn't get arrested
cause it's fucking time proof.

1837
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:02,770
I did my fucking thing.
That is so ridiculous.

1838
01:27:02,771 --> 01:27:06,740
You imagine getting arrested in boulder.
I think about the words you told me

1839
01:27:06,741 --> 01:27:09,650
about boulder once you go.
I was driving into boulder and my wife

1840
01:27:09,651 --> 01:27:13,880
and I kept thinking this must've been a
candy store for Joey did.

1841
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:15,860
Yeah.

1842
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:18,590
How do you get arrested?
They let you out without a life.

1843
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:20,690
They're all like barefoot.
Yoga people listened to me.

1844
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:25,310
I was in jail for three weeks as Jose
Diaz waiting bail for kidnap me.

1845
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:31,270
I sat in there from December,
from November 18th to December like

1846
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:35,680
ninth to 10th I had the jail.
Why'd you do know that?

1847
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,530
You do know that I could just go up to
the gardens I need to make along with

1848
01:27:38,531 --> 01:27:40,970
business call and he let me out.
Everybody else had a sign the list.

1849
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:45,500
You do know that when I was smoking weed
and then I had all access to cool lake,

1850
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:48,320
cause I don't like,
I hate fucking milk.

1851
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:52,070
I like Mo shakes.
Not Know I had all access.

1852
01:27:52,071 --> 01:27:54,890
Do you know I got arrested three months?
Not even Joe Rogan.

1853
01:27:54,891 --> 01:27:58,940
I got the rest of the month after I made
bail and they put me back in that jail

1854
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:03,800
and I went back as Jimmy
and everybody was calling me Jimmy.

1855
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:04,191
No,
no,

1856
01:28:04,191 --> 01:28:05,024
no,
no.

1857
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,140
My name,
I'm the fingerprint was the alias and

1858
01:28:09,141 --> 01:28:12,550
their fingerprint and me calling me Joey
doing joey.

1859
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,540
How's it been lately?
I see you're back in here.

1860
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:19,820
Meanwhile,
on that card it blatantly says Jimmy.

1861
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,180
So they didn't read the card?
No,

1862
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,550
they just assumed it was you.
But you went in with someone else's.

1863
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:28,010
Yeah.
And then what happened?

1864
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,720
And then I called the girl,
they said,

1865
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:33,770
we can't let you out without a license.
So your driver's license,

1866
01:28:33,771 --> 01:28:35,840
yet I didn't even have the license for
that name.

1867
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:40,520
In those days,
there was no paperwork on me at all.

1868
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,110
If you,
if you arrested me,

1869
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:42,973
guess

1870
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,390
always like jeopardy.
Right.

1871
01:28:45,391 --> 01:28:49,500
And here's your chance to beat jeopardy.
You get no prices.

1872
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,330
I never carry the license on me in those
days till till this day.

1873
01:28:53,331 --> 01:28:55,760
I hate that bulge in my pocket.
I fucking hate it.

1874
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:59,360
So what you do?
So I wouldn't bring an idea with me so I

1875
01:28:59,361 --> 01:29:00,710
can be anybody.
When you were arrested,

1876
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,160
how could it be a fucking penguins?
Well you fucking

1877
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:07,530
so you just had nothing on nothing.
So they made me call.

1878
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:09,510
So I called my girlfriend at the time
and I go,

1879
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:10,440
hey,
how you doing?

1880
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,360
This is James.
She was like,

1881
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:12,880
Ooh,
I go,

1882
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,210
this is James.
I took you out to dinner a couple of

1883
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:16,860
weeks ago.
I lost my license.

1884
01:29:16,861 --> 01:29:18,390
She's like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1885
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,760
I'm just a cops right there.
I'm like,

1886
01:29:20,761 --> 01:29:24,570
I lost my fucking license and these cops
won't let me out one unless somebody

1887
01:29:24,571 --> 01:29:26,340
comes down here and lets me,
I'm not,

1888
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:27,920
she knew the kid,
I was talking about

1889
01:29:29,690 --> 01:29:30,600
you following me.

1890
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,630
She always heard me talking about him.
I said,

1891
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,371
James,
James,

1892
01:29:33,371 --> 01:29:34,071
James,
James,

1893
01:29:34,071 --> 01:29:34,831
James.
And she goes,

1894
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:36,480
Okay James,
this last name.

1895
01:29:36,481 --> 01:29:37,314
And I go,
yeah.

1896
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:39,750
And she went down there and they brought
her in.

1897
01:29:39,751 --> 01:29:40,860
They said,
what's his name,

1898
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,060
James,
where does he live?

1899
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:44,130
She told them and they go,
okay,

1900
01:29:44,131 --> 01:29:47,800
we'll let you out.
That was it.

1901
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:52,170
They gave me paperwork and four days
later I turned myself in.

1902
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,880
I went,
I stood in court,

1903
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:57,240
I got charged.
I pled guilty because I didn't want to

1904
01:29:57,241 --> 01:29:59,160
fuck with it.
I didn't want to take a chop with

1905
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:02,310
things.
Think the trial they had me and I

1906
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:06,930
fucking did the uh,
community service at the age unit under

1907
01:30:06,931 --> 01:30:08,670
this guy's name,
under this guy's name,

1908
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:11,940
that 16 hours of the fucking,
the community corrections.

1909
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:16,230
But I met a cop that was there.
So see everything works itself out and

1910
01:30:16,231 --> 01:30:18,060
throw the other,
because when I was there,

1911
01:30:18,061 --> 01:30:21,360
there was a cop that would do a detail
that in those days,

1912
01:30:21,361 --> 01:30:26,160
the police age,
that AIDS unit was getting death threats

1913
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:27,920
from like militant people in Boulder.

1914
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,950
The people up in the hill and they had a
cop there and I would talk to the cop

1915
01:30:31,951 --> 01:30:33,600
every day,
talk to the cop a little bit,

1916
01:30:33,601 --> 01:30:34,680
hey,
how you doing officer?

1917
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:39,240
And we'd talk about this or that,
and one day I got into a beef,

1918
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:44,070
I had two felonies and my ex fucking
boyfriend thought he was tough for me

1919
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:44,940
and I said,
you know what?

1920
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,590
I got to smack this guy,
but if I could get them,

1921
01:30:46,591 --> 01:30:50,070
I got to get them good.
And I went to meet him and I fucking

1922
01:30:50,071 --> 01:30:52,710
smack them.
I guess it was the first cop on the job,

1923
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:57,330
the dude from the AIDS unit.
This guy's holding onto his face.

1924
01:30:57,331 --> 01:30:58,170
He came,
he asked me,

1925
01:30:58,171 --> 01:30:58,951
Charlie,
what happened?

1926
01:30:58,951 --> 01:31:00,480
I told him the truth.
They gave me a ticket.

1927
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:04,890
So life is his circle of my foot kind of
ticket.

1928
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:06,210
They get for slapping someone.

1929
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,000
He got a ticket to,
he got a ticket,

1930
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:13,010
I got a misdemeanor assault and he got
using a racial slur outside the city

1931
01:31:15,451 --> 01:31:17,670
limits of boulder.
Oh,

1932
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,640
is that really the case?
That's a really cool is always been like

1933
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:21,270
that.
Yeah,

1934
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:24,690
because the football players and 85
those football players that were really

1935
01:31:24,691 --> 01:31:27,570
powerful that that those teams that won
the national championship,

1936
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:29,320
there was always beef with them in
boulder.

1937
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:33,510
The cops always had beef with them.
So there was one,

1938
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,060
there was a couple of incidents.
It was Kuneva Magee.

1939
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,730
He just smacked them motherfuckers.
I ball out of his head.

1940
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,240
I told those,
you think I'm kidding,

1941
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:45,420
I'm not cracking jokes.
He broke his eye socket six foot five to

1942
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:50,421
45 well that smack with a smack Jesus.
Oh Stockton slap I ball went out of his

1943
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:53,160
fucking head weight made money,
had a ring on.

1944
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:57,300
And then another lady called Jj Flanigan
a nigger and he punched her in the face.

1945
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,040
So they dropped the,
because she

1946
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,020
said a racial slur.
That's hilarious.

1947
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:06,640
So when a woman can call a guy in and
just get punched in the face,

1948
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:09,770
oh he slapped the,
so they call it the Jj Flannigan rule.

1949
01:32:09,771 --> 01:32:13,360
So like God is so crazy.
When I got arrested for that racial

1950
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:14,021
thing,
I told him,

1951
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:16,270
he called me a Spec what she did in
front of my daughter.

1952
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,430
So I smacked him.
So wait a minute.

1953
01:32:20,431 --> 01:32:24,670
Did the football player smacker or
puncher thank you smack that Jj

1954
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:26,660
Flanagan.
That's a street corner in the bolt and

1955
01:32:26,661 --> 01:32:30,770
Pearl Street mall is something that's
how strong that word is just smack.

1956
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,550
And Zoe is the only word that it has a
letter.

1957
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:35,700
Like you could kind of say the f word,
but most people say fuck.

1958
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:40,080
But he was still,
this is still 88 this is 88 this is

1959
01:32:40,081 --> 01:32:42,540
named d.
These are the times when they would come

1960
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:44,340
down and see you football,
you know?

1961
01:32:44,341 --> 01:32:46,620
But they had a lot of shit going on.
Like there's a document,

1962
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:48,630
there's a 30 for 30 Oh really?
Okay,

1963
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:50,100
great.
Let me ask you this,

1964
01:32:50,101 --> 01:32:52,500
why do you think boulder has always been
so liberal?

1965
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:56,410
Because they want to be,
they had that right to be,

1966
01:32:56,470 --> 01:33:01,470
these are people that want to live,
you know the boulder now I'm others will

1967
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:03,310
go set him.
So Santa Monica,

1968
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:06,220
it's the same fucking people.
What do you mean it's the same people?

1969
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:10,420
That was not the bold and when I got
there in 1980 not even close.

1970
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,660
What's the difference?
I don't know.

1971
01:33:13,661 --> 01:33:15,400
What the gentiles,
you know,

1972
01:33:15,401 --> 01:33:18,010
starbucks,
that's not what blogging was.

1973
01:33:18,011 --> 01:33:22,510
Stalls to be.
Boulder was totally brought up to be

1974
01:33:22,511 --> 01:33:26,410
anti very much establishment.
Very uh,

1975
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:28,510
you know,
people who have soap companies,

1976
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:31,390
right?
People who have shirts with designs of

1977
01:33:31,391 --> 01:33:33,370
the grateful dead.
But that's what it is.

1978
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:35,410
Right?
If that's what it is,

1979
01:33:35,411 --> 01:33:38,650
let that be that.
Well there's a bunch of people in

1980
01:33:38,651 --> 01:33:41,650
Boulder,
it'll just go democrat no matter what,

1981
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:45,040
which means they just vote Democrat.
Oh No,

1982
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:46,390
they don't vote Republican ever.

1983
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:47,710
So like when I was there,
it was,

1984
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,760
it was during the Obama election after
he got elected for the first term is

1985
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:54,180
when I was there.
And uh,

1986
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:58,720
I was like this,
it's so weird that there's so many

1987
01:33:58,721 --> 01:34:03,220
different people that have the same
thing on their front lawn.

1988
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,510
It's Obama,
Obama,

1989
01:34:04,511 --> 01:34:08,830
Obama like everywhere you look,
he didn't see any Republican candidates

1990
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,780
on anybody's launch.
So you just didn't see that.

1991
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:13,480
What is the rest of Colorado like?
Way Republican,

1992
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:16,690
way more republican rest of Colorado is
like cowboys and shit.

1993
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:18,580
Denver's kind of a mixture.
DENVER,

1994
01:34:18,581 --> 01:34:20,880
you get a little bit of everything cause
it's sort of like Austin,

1995
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:22,690
Texas,
like that sort of like no,

1996
01:34:22,691 --> 01:34:25,450
no,
no because Austin is more like cowboy

1997
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:27,610
funky.
Austin's different.

1998
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:32,410
Austin is like a lot of bad ass music
comes from Austin fucking Gary Clark Jr

1999
01:34:32,411 --> 01:34:36,040
comes from Austin.
But the state of mine of Wash of Boulder

2000
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:40,300
and Austin were pretty much similar
representing that the states.

2001
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:43,510
But you can't compare them because most
there's only a hundred thousand people.

2002
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:46,030
It's tiny ass place.
Austin's a million.

2003
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:49,330
What's the population of of bold?
100,000 still.

2004
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:52,690
It's tiny bates camp build.
They don't let you build.

2005
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:55,090
They got that place locked down.
Well that's what I'm saying.

2006
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:58,220
They always buy up open space.
Boulder always

2007
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,110
wanted to be different than everybody
else.

2008
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,820
Yeah.
When I first went to boulder,

2009
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:06,380
I first peaked at Boulder July of 83 and
I was like,

2010
01:35:06,381 --> 01:35:09,970
I'll never come to this fucking place
too boring.

2011
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:13,640
But I was from New York City Guy Get us
the population Jagan find it was an all

2012
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:17,570
of a sudden I'm dealing with pizzas and
slept on a mattress about 300,000 but

2013
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:21,410
it's 100,000 the Metros 300,000 Oh,
okay.

2014
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,460
So it's about you hundred thousand
weight [inaudible] we doing stepping

2015
01:35:25,461 --> 01:35:28,470
back to chew.
You were in the middle of the store.

2016
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,350
Yeah.
Boston's a totally different animal.

2017
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:37,640
Austin as much more like a,
I just meant in the way like Texas is

2018
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:38,840
right repo.
Yeah,

2019
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:39,470
yeah,
yeah,

2020
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:41,240
for sure.
But there's a lot of Republicans in

2021
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:44,750
Austin.
Austin's not entirely liberal.

2022
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:46,940
Austin's a mixture.
It's a weird mixture.

2023
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:50,780
Boulder's not much of a mixture.
Bolger like Greg for Tim and said it

2024
01:35:50,781 --> 01:35:51,110
best.

2025
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:52,610
He's like,
it's just too one note.

2026
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:57,110
He liked a denver because uh,
we were talking about like how amazing

2027
01:35:57,111 --> 01:35:59,420
Colorado is and he did a weekend at the
comedy works.

2028
01:35:59,421 --> 01:35:59,961
He's like,
you know what,

2029
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:01,970
I could fucking live here.
He goes,

2030
01:36:01,971 --> 01:36:03,500
I don't really say that about many
places,

2031
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:06,140
but I could live there.
And we were talking about bolder and

2032
01:36:06,141 --> 01:36:08,540
he's like,
I think bold is just a little too one

2033
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:12,320
note.
They're a little too college influenced,

2034
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,140
Super Liberal,
social justice,

2035
01:36:15,141 --> 01:36:17,030
Warrior type,
Vegan,

2036
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:19,640
barefoot,
handcrafted,

2037
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:21,740
all that nonsense.
You know,

2038
01:36:21,741 --> 01:36:24,470
there's like a lot on the People's
Republic of Boulder.

2039
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:28,600
That's what they call it.
Leap is Republic of Boulder Place.

2040
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,231
Yeah.
Oh,

2041
01:36:30,231 --> 01:36:32,120
it's listening to me.
He's folding the traction.

2042
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:34,430
They're very nice people at that time in
my life.

2043
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:37,990
Bold or just meant something to me.
It meant peace of mind.

2044
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:40,880
I Dunno.
I don't know what the place itself is so

2045
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:42,260
fucking beautiful.

2046
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:44,660
I mean,
you're there in the foothills of the

2047
01:36:44,661 --> 01:36:47,570
rocky mountains and you just sit
sometimes he just like,

2048
01:36:47,571 --> 01:36:48,620
you'd go to boulder,
he just,

2049
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,630
what's that street?
That Mall Street Pearl.

2050
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:52,030
Pearl Street.
Pearl Street Mall.

2051
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:54,710
And when you just look up and you see
and you're looking at fucking,

2052
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,490
he leave the street and you look up,
you're looking at like mountains.

2053
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:01,430
So rocky mountains right there.
Like you're in this beautiful,

2054
01:37:01,431 --> 01:37:04,640
amazing spot and the people,
it's not that many people.

2055
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,940
I think that's a big thing.
I think when you get too many people in

2056
01:37:07,941 --> 01:37:10,760
a,
in a place that gets annoying that you

2057
01:37:10,761 --> 01:37:12,650
fucking don't appreciate each other as
much.

2058
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:17,150
Just too many fucking people.
There's 3 million people has grown a lot

2059
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:18,680
since I left Hawaii,
Florida.

2060
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:21,470
It has butters,
can't grow much more than it's already

2061
01:37:21,471 --> 01:37:23,750
grown.
What they've done is amazing.

2062
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:27,590
His bio up so much open space and make
it super difficult to put up apartment

2063
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:30,410
buildings and people like that's
bullshit.

2064
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:34,070
We need affordable housing.
Drive to boulder,

2065
01:37:34,071 --> 01:37:39,071
stupid fuck drive there just fucking be
part of the Denver Metro areas included

2066
01:37:39,261 --> 01:37:43,010
in that 300,000 that's okay.
Arvada and places like that.

2067
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,020
Well it's like,
uh,

2068
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:46,550
it's awesome.
Longmont,

2069
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:49,970
Longmont,
Lafayette,

2070
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:56,140
you know what's the hidden gem?
Evergreen Evergreen's this is the shit.

2071
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:58,410
God Damn,
they have some views.

2072
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:03,500
Evergreen has some ridiculous views or
you just tucked in with like this giant

2073
01:38:05,611 --> 01:38:07,740
elk herd that walks down through the
middle of town,

2074
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:11,700
got a giant elk herd walking through the
middle of the street and a buddy of mine

2075
01:38:11,701 --> 01:38:14,510
moved there and he was living in Vegas
before and he,

2076
01:38:14,511 --> 01:38:16,080
and you know,
he was asking him about Colorado.

2077
01:38:16,081 --> 01:38:17,300
I said,
you've got to check out evergreen.

2078
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:18,930
And he,
he went there once,

2079
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,610
bought a house,
immediately moved.

2080
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:23,520
And uh,
he texted me that these elk,

2081
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,220
they get in the middle of the street and
someone who was from out of town

2082
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:30,810
apparently was like beep in and trying
to get the elk out of the road and like

2083
01:38:30,811 --> 01:38:35,811
revving his engine and cause he was in a
rush and some old cowboy got out of his

2084
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:38,220
truck,
walked up to dude's car window,

2085
01:38:38,221 --> 01:38:41,580
punched him through the car window and
then got back in his truck,

2086
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:46,380
get sick because the guy was harassing
the helicopter.

2087
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:47,550
Yeah,
that's no joke,

2088
01:38:47,551 --> 01:38:49,380
dude.
That's really what happens in evergreen.

2089
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:53,130
This is a herd of elk walking down the
middle of the street and you can't do a

2090
01:38:53,131 --> 01:38:56,490
God damn thing about it.
And because the people in the town

2091
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,400
itself,
I mean they don't really hunt them when

2092
01:38:59,401 --> 01:39:00,290
they do that.
So the,

2093
01:39:00,291 --> 01:39:03,810
the,
the elk feel super calm about walking on

2094
01:39:03,811 --> 01:39:07,230
the highway in front of everybody
because if they were in the woods with

2095
01:39:07,231 --> 01:39:09,420
you like that,
they would fucking bolt of,

2096
01:39:09,421 --> 01:39:11,370
they saw a person,
they smelled you,

2097
01:39:11,371 --> 01:39:13,830
they would bolt.
But meanwhile these things have chosen

2098
01:39:13,831 --> 01:39:18,420
to go like by the road.
It's interesting too because they,

2099
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:22,200
they don't recognize people as predators
in those situations.

2100
01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:24,780
It's like people around urban areas
aren't predators,

2101
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:26,610
but people in the mountains are
predators.

2102
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:30,350
It's real weird.
So for generations that like [inaudible]

2103
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:32,610
group of Alex has just been walking down
the street.

2104
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,740
Yeah.
Unbelievable.

2105
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:35,400
It's crazy.
Not only that,

2106
01:39:35,401 --> 01:39:37,230
um,
I mean that's the case everywhere.

2107
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,010
Like in yellowstone,
there was a,

2108
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:41,490
a video that someone sent me today.
I didn't,

2109
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:43,830
I don't think I retweeted it.
Um,

2110
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:45,190
someone send me,
I didn't watch him,

2111
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,850
I wasn't getting self service,
but there's a video that someone sent me

2112
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:50,190
today about some woman and got too close
to an elk in yellowstone.

2113
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:52,920
I guess it was real recently,
but mo for the most part,

2114
01:39:52,921 --> 01:39:55,950
they don't worry about people they're
wearing about wolves and grizzly bears

2115
01:39:55,951 --> 01:39:57,790
and shit.
So they see a person they go,

2116
01:39:58,230 --> 01:40:01,050
cause no one's hunted in yellowstone for
over a hundred years.

2117
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,390
So elk see people there and they were
like,

2118
01:40:03,391 --> 01:40:04,470
what's up dude?
How you doing?

2119
01:40:04,471 --> 01:40:05,760
Man?
Got some carrots for me.

2120
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:07,140
Is this it?
Yeah.

2121
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:09,960
Yellowstone elk decides a woman's too
close for comfort.

2122
01:40:09,961 --> 01:40:10,440
Yeah,
go,

2123
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,273
go,
go.

2124
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:12,410
Oh,
oh,

2125
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:13,320
oh no.
Oh No.

2126
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,180
Oh yes.
Did you get that on video?

2127
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:16,220
Oh.
Oh,

2128
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:18,050
she just got launched

2129
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,180
ma'am.
Could you please?

2130
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:27,090
Oh yeah.
Oh yes.

2131
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:28,940
Video.
I didn't get it.

2132
01:40:28,941 --> 01:40:29,340
Look,
she,

2133
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:30,470
she went salen

2134
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:35,210
the video.
Whoa,

2135
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:38,730
you're too close to got out.
And that's why

2136
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:42,320
25 yards,
ma'am.

2137
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:49,370
Thank you sir.
That's the,

2138
01:40:49,371 --> 01:40:50,750
I just got humbled,
sir.

2139
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,640
That's a certain kind of,
sir.

2140
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:55,560
Have you seen the video of the hunter
getting beaten by a whore?

2141
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:56,560
A deer?
Yeah.

2142
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:58,100
Saying this,
there's a bunch of hits in the face.

2143
01:40:58,210 --> 01:40:59,590
A Dell,
they'll fuck you up.

2144
01:40:59,591 --> 01:41:02,770
Especially in the Rut.
They're horny and they think you cock

2145
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:04,300
blocking them.
They get mad.

2146
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:05,950
Jack,
you are you sure?

2147
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:08,060
Oh yeah.
Did people died from deer?

2148
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:11,110
A lot of people had died because they
get gored like the,

2149
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,123
you know,
they're hot.

2150
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:16,090
They're either hunting homer there,
hiking him or what for whatever reason

2151
01:41:16,091 --> 01:41:17,830
they may be like that lady,
they get stupid.

2152
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:21,820
Like she was lucky that that was either
a cow elk or that was an elk that didn't

2153
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:25,780
have antlers yet cause they shed their
antlers and then the grown back.

2154
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,780
Um,
so she got lucky cause if that was a big

2155
01:41:28,781 --> 01:41:29,800
bull elk,
there's one,

2156
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:30,860
this one,
this is the one I saw.

2157
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:33,550
He just kicked him.
That guy has dog shit Jujitsu.

2158
01:41:33,551 --> 01:41:35,710
First of all should be spinning for one
of those rear legs.

2159
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:38,670
You try to get them in a heel hook on
that real.

2160
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,720
I,
I,

2161
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:42,280
uh,
comorbid a deer's lag and snapped it in

2162
01:41:42,281 --> 01:41:45,170
half after it was already dead.
I was trying to,

2163
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:46,930
I was like,
I wonder if this would work.

2164
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:52,050
A deer snapped its leg when Callan and I
and went hunting in Montana.

2165
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:54,790
So I feel real confident that I could
heal.

2166
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:56,440
Hook a deer.
Fuck it up.

2167
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:00,060
Have you lost your fucking
deal?

2168
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:01,750
I take us back.
Take us back.

2169
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:06,350
Take that fucking,
then you're in the hospital with a ball.

2170
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,240
By the way.
My fault.

2171
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:13,320
Probably just recovering right now.
Yeah.

2172
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:15,970
He's in the hall in the hospital today
and he got his,

2173
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:19,120
his discs replaced.
How long does that take now?

2174
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:22,210
Um,
I don't think the operation is,

2175
01:42:22,211 --> 01:42:24,510
uh,
just a few hours and I'm,

2176
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:28,600
the recovery time is a ridiculously low.
I think a,

2177
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:30,670
in six weeks he's allowed to start
lifting weights.

2178
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:34,570
So six weeks,
his body has to heal up.

2179
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:37,900
So I'm talking out of school cause I
don't know the exact procedure,

2180
01:42:37,901 --> 01:42:42,190
but I know this is what he told me is
that they're replacing a disk with a

2181
01:42:42,191 --> 01:42:46,340
titanium disk.
They have some sort of a new technology

2182
01:42:46,341 --> 01:42:49,240
in disc replacement where they used to
take the disc out and then they would

2183
01:42:49,241 --> 01:42:52,030
fuse it together.
Right now instead they'll put an

2184
01:42:52,031 --> 01:42:56,770
artificial disc and it's supposed to be
just as good as um,

2185
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,480
uh,
a real desk.

2186
01:42:58,870 --> 01:43:01,690
And the difference being that like when
they would fuse those discs,

2187
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:04,780
it would limit your mobility pretty
drastically because you don't have any

2188
01:43:04,781 --> 01:43:09,781
articulation in between the two joints a
now that they have this artificial disk

2189
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:12,550
that aren't dead,
artificial disc actually moves around

2190
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:17,710
and it allows your spine to be flexible.
So I'm one of the guys from school,

2191
01:43:17,711 --> 01:43:21,460
Victor got it done and apparently he's
never been better and it feels great.

2192
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:23,890
No pain at all.
And it was bothering him for a long time

2193
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:27,250
and Eddie's been bothering his for
almost as long as I've known him cause

2194
01:43:27,251 --> 01:43:29,490
he does so much stuff from his back.
You know,

2195
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:33,610
it's all guard work and it's getting
stacked all the time and compressed all

2196
01:43:33,611 --> 01:43:36,550
the time and not,
you know,

2197
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:40,060
not the most diligent about stretching
the back out early in his career.

2198
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:43,270
You know,
just he take your stretching before and

2199
01:43:43,271 --> 01:43:46,090
after you who you definitely should warm
up before.

2200
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:49,240
Um,
but the big thing is mobility,

2201
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:51,100
mobility,
training meaning,

2202
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:54,440
um,
doing things like bending down,

2203
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:59,090
grabbing the back of your heel with your
four fingers on both sides and trying to

2204
01:43:59,091 --> 01:44:03,140
put your pinkies together and then
extending your legs and you're popping

2205
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:05,750
your back and stretching your back.
For me,

2206
01:44:05,751 --> 01:44:08,550
that's big.
Hanging by your ankles as big and he

2207
01:44:08,551 --> 01:44:11,360
sort of decompression anything that
alleviates pressure.

2208
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:14,240
I have one that I put on my neck and
it's like I'm hanging myself and go

2209
01:44:14,241 --> 01:44:14,721
click,
click,

2210
01:44:14,721 --> 01:44:15,171
click,
click,

2211
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:15,681
click,
click,

2212
01:44:15,681 --> 01:44:18,290
click.
And I'm like literally hanging a good,

2213
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:20,030
good percentage of my weight from my
neck.

2214
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:22,730
Then I have a bunch of them in the back.
I have different,

2215
01:44:22,731 --> 01:44:24,680
uh,
decompression devices in the back.

2216
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:27,830
I've got the reverse hyper,
which strengthens your back.

2217
01:44:27,831 --> 01:44:32,000
And also it's like an active,
moot moving decompression of the bag

2218
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:33,180
that's created by that.

2219
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:35,150
Uh,
Louie Simmons guy that from a west side,

2220
01:44:35,151 --> 01:44:37,250
barbell,
just genius guy.

2221
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:41,360
He had a back injury too and you needed
to get it fixed and they were going to,

2222
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:42,850
they wanted to cut him and he was like,
ah,

2223
01:44:42,851 --> 01:44:46,350
I think I can figure this out.
I think there's gotta be an exercise.

2224
01:44:46,351 --> 01:44:49,070
It strengthens this instead of surgery.
And so that's what he came up with.

2225
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:51,290
But see in Eddie's position,
don't even know if that would have

2226
01:44:51,291 --> 01:44:54,950
helped because Eddie's was so far gone.
He didn't have any disc left.

2227
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:56,210
There was like,
there's nothing there.

2228
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:57,260
You know what?
I'll burrow those.

2229
01:44:57,261 --> 01:45:01,360
They do look 12 o'clock class then at
one 15 it's a mobility class for half

2230
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,140
hour.
And I said that Kettle Jitsu guy.

2231
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,760
No,
but isn't there a guide?

2232
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:05,870
Yes.
Now,

2233
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,860
but he's got tip,
tick,

2234
01:45:07,861 --> 01:45:09,230
fit,
tick,

2235
01:45:09,231 --> 01:45:10,460
fit.
He's got tick fit.

2236
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:11,330
What does that mean?

2237
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:13,400
Tick fit?
Is that new training with the bats?

2238
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:17,210
How'd he say tick?
How do you spell it?

2239
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:20,600
T I see fit I think.
Huh?

2240
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:22,880
Take fit.
And it's the stuff with the bat.

2241
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:25,520
Okay.
Like Eskrima like that kind of stuff.

2242
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:29,510
No one is police baton.
What do they have happen on it now?

2243
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:30,570
What do they do for,
oh,

2244
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:31,820
oh,
you mean macy's?

2245
01:45:31,821 --> 01:45:34,430
Like Steel Mace or on a club?
They have the club.

2246
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,750
Phillip were playing charades.
The club.

2247
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:38,000
The club on the metal club.
Yeah,

2248
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:40,100
it was great.
It was something with a club and they

2249
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:41,580
have a class at nine.
Oh,

2250
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:43,880
okay.
And then they have a class at one and

2251
01:45:43,881 --> 01:45:47,190
they have a class at six 30 what he's
been doing lately,

2252
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:48,230
he's like,
you know what man?

2253
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:51,650
My one's been like,
why did I come out here and do mobility

2254
01:45:51,651 --> 01:45:56,240
with you guys from one 15 to one 45 I
feel like class warmed up and ready

2255
01:45:56,241 --> 01:45:59,330
after Jujitsu and he just does,
you know,

2256
01:45:59,331 --> 01:46:01,730
a squat.

2257
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:05,360
Touch the ground,
lift your foot down and go up and switch

2258
01:46:05,361 --> 01:46:06,141
legs.
You know,

2259
01:46:06,141 --> 01:46:07,940
just stuff like that.
Six exercises,

2260
01:46:07,941 --> 01:46:09,920
three minutes with a,
with a thing and you're out of that.

2261
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:12,650
You're stretching your rob,
then it's no,

2262
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:13,540
no big deal.
I mean,

2263
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:15,230
you break a sweat on some of them,
you know,

2264
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:18,770
downward dog to something else into it
and do push up.

2265
01:46:19,070 --> 01:46:21,230
We know it's problem with Jujitsu is
that it's fun.

2266
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,510
And when it's fun,
you're going in there and getting

2267
01:46:23,511 --> 01:46:26,030
smashed all the time and the overall
look,

2268
01:46:26,031 --> 01:46:29,380
you don't give yourself a lot of time to
recover from those rolling sessions and

2269
01:46:29,381 --> 01:46:32,840
there's a lot of little micro injuries
and those rolling sessions and some of

2270
01:46:32,841 --> 01:46:35,570
those micro injuries become chronic.
After awhile.

2271
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:39,890
Like Eddie's back or like for me it was
my neck just like over and over again.

2272
01:46:39,891 --> 01:46:41,510
You're doing the same thing over and
over again.

2273
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:44,290
You're out sore the next day.
Just keep training,

2274
01:46:44,291 --> 01:46:46,370
you keep crying.
He'd developed scar tissue.

2275
01:46:46,371 --> 01:46:49,980
Your disks get compressed and then you
start weird shit like

2276
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,180
numbness like some guys get like numb
feet like a cade.

2277
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:54,861
My friend.
Kay.

2278
01:46:54,861 --> 01:46:57,120
Does lower leg is still numb.
Still Numb.

2279
01:46:57,710 --> 01:46:58,770
Yeah.
My hands,

2280
01:46:58,771 --> 01:47:00,840
I was getting numb hands,
bas rutten's got it.

2281
01:47:00,841 --> 01:47:04,110
Like a whole,
his whole like neck area is fucked.

2282
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:06,750
He's had several surgeries in his neck
and his,

2283
01:47:06,751 --> 01:47:11,290
he's get at least two disks,
maybe three discs frozen and,

2284
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:11,940
and,
and,

2285
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:15,980
and fucking like the,
the disks are removed and the,

2286
01:47:15,981 --> 01:47:20,981
the bones are fused in his neck.
I tried to take a day in between except

2287
01:47:21,991 --> 01:47:24,840
with days that I have to go on the road.
The weeks I'd have to go on the road,

2288
01:47:24,841 --> 01:47:28,230
I want to get three.
And so I just do it Monday,

2289
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:29,490
Tuesday,
Wednesday and got on a plane Thursday.

2290
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:33,330
But the weeks I'm in town all week I'll
do Monday,

2291
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:35,580
Wednesday and Friday.
And then sometimes like this week I did

2292
01:47:35,581 --> 01:47:38,670
Sunday and I went Monday.
But Sunday is very light.

2293
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:42,240
It's just a three minute roles and guard
pass past stuff.

2294
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,060
He's a great guy.
He doesn't really hate Mondays.

2295
01:47:45,061 --> 01:47:48,090
Wednesdays and Fridays are hard.
Wednesdays,

2296
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:50,700
Sundays I go cause the guy is just so
great.

2297
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:54,060
Technically I always learn one little
stupid thing,

2298
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,340
you know,
just one little stupid thing.

2299
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:59,030
Your role like two or three times in
your out of that.

2300
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:01,980
Right.
So I always tried to take,

2301
01:48:02,030 --> 01:48:03,450
he was,
if I want to go that day,

2302
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:08,040
even if I feel okay and I'm not sore,
I'll take the day off because I don't

2303
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:09,750
want to go every day.
I don't want to do that.

2304
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,630
You know,
I'll do a light kettlebell workout or

2305
01:48:12,631 --> 01:48:13,980
something.
But then there's other people that think

2306
01:48:13,981 --> 01:48:16,440
you just keep doing it and eventually
body hardens up.

2307
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:18,090
Yeah.
I don't know.

2308
01:48:18,230 --> 01:48:19,110
It's uh,
it's,

2309
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:20,010
it's,
it depends.

2310
01:48:20,011 --> 01:48:21,390
I guess it depends on how you approach
it.

2311
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:25,600
I know bordain does it every day.
The trains every day sometimes does

2312
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:28,290
twice a day until it,
he'll take a private and then I'll take

2313
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:29,190
a group class.
Well,

2314
01:48:29,191 --> 01:48:30,450
it's an,
it's an age thing.

2315
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:33,960
It's to time barrier and it's also,
um,

2316
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:35,790
like for me,
it's the weight.

2317
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:38,400
You know,
when you judo throw me,

2318
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:40,860
it's 300 pounds.
It's driving the five.

2319
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:43,830
You do that 10 times.
The next day something's going to be

2320
01:48:43,831 --> 01:48:45,660
rattled in my fucking head.
Right.

2321
01:48:45,730 --> 01:48:47,340
Okay.
Last week we had a guy,

2322
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:52,960
Rick Gay Machado.
He's Jack or race coach and the Amazon.

2323
01:48:53,311 --> 01:48:54,610
You got to take Wayne,
uh,

2324
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:59,420
boke and a fucking bicycle.
You know what I'm like,

2325
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:00,900
I'm not,
I'm not trying to be cute.

2326
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,060
It's true.
We had our burden on him.

2327
01:49:03,061 --> 01:49:05,100
I'm about,
Britta was saying that the one place in

2328
01:49:05,101 --> 01:49:09,030
Brazil that you got to train 10 hours,
then you've got to walk a mile.

2329
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:11,700
Then you've got to go across and one of
these things,

2330
01:49:11,701 --> 01:49:13,530
there's some days somebody would steal
the paddle.

2331
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:19,490
Can you imagine Jesus?
10 hours a fucking fucking around our

2332
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:22,740
mile walk and now some of these steals
the fucking battle.

2333
01:49:22,741 --> 01:49:25,560
I can't even battled through my fucking
house and there was shit in the water

2334
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:27,930
and there was shit.
No water cause that the house,

2335
01:49:28,230 --> 01:49:30,630
the sewage would go into the water.
Oh Jesus.

2336
01:49:30,650 --> 01:49:30,861
No,
no,

2337
01:49:30,861 --> 01:49:31,021
no,
no,

2338
01:49:31,021 --> 01:49:32,550
no.
And then you wonder why they got Zika

2339
01:49:32,551 --> 01:49:34,470
and everybody's head's getting big in
Brazil and shit.

2340
01:49:34,471 --> 01:49:36,270
It was small.
That's what I'm now how's,

2341
01:49:36,271 --> 01:49:38,450
uh,
I think that's what they gave Jose Aldo

2342
01:49:38,490 --> 01:49:40,380
is to fight against mcgregor,
the Zika virus.

2343
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:45,930
They're all fucked up.
They had them crying after the show that

2344
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,770
had a camera in the room.

2345
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:49,480
I'm telling you,
Dana,

2346
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:51,710
find a way to give them the Zika virus
is shit.

2347
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:55,930
Imagine how bad the population would be
if there was no viruses.

2348
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:59,290
If there was no diseases,
diseases didn't kill anybody.

2349
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:00,580
I mean,
how many people are killed?

2350
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:03,070
Let's just take a guess.
How many people are killed every year by

2351
01:50:03,071 --> 01:50:03,904
disease?

2352
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:07,460
Let's guess 2 million,
3 million.

2353
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:09,500
How many people you think probably
around there,

2354
01:50:09,501 --> 01:50:11,520
but it's not in America.
I think it's in like,

2355
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:13,190
right.
Did she get that picture?

2356
01:50:13,191 --> 01:50:15,770
By the way of that,
that a ladder and China,

2357
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:19,670
China kids were climbing at places like
that.

2358
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:24,170
Like it's like a 2000 foot bamboo ladder
that like six year olds are climbing up.

2359
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:26,570
Why are they doing that?
It's the only way to get to their town.

2360
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:28,190
So I think that,
yeah.

2361
01:50:28,191 --> 01:50:31,010
Have you seen that Jamie?
Jesus Christ.

2362
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:33,820
A 2000 foot ladders.
It might not be feed.

2363
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:35,000
It might be.
Look at this.

2364
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:38,930
Oh my God.
Children in China would climb 2,500 foot

2365
01:50:38,931 --> 01:50:41,270
cliff to get to school,
maybe given stairs.

2366
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:43,370
Oh,
pussies.

2367
01:50:44,150 --> 01:50:45,940
They're six years old.
So it's pulling like this.

2368
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:49,980
Look at this dude.
They're climbing with their backpacks on

2369
01:50:49,981 --> 01:50:52,130
you.
Imagine sending your little baby and

2370
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:57,140
your baby has to climb 2,500 feet on
this Janky ass wooden ladder that looks

2371
01:50:58,491 --> 01:51:00,740
like it was made when Columbus was
sailing.

2372
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:03,200
Cut.
Fucking wanky.

2373
01:51:03,201 --> 01:51:05,240
That ladder looks,
that's insane.

2374
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:10,280
See if there's any other pictures
that is fucking bananas.

2375
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:15,190
Oh
well was poor kids.

2376
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:16,960
They got a hard look in their face,
man.

2377
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:21,770
Jesus,
that's so crazy.

2378
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:24,860
I wonder,
do you know there's one fucking weak ass

2379
01:51:24,861 --> 01:51:27,920
bitch kid that starts crying.
They meg and then he falls.

2380
01:51:27,970 --> 01:51:29,660
I was everyone down.
Not In China,

2381
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:32,300
not in China.
They don't make it.

2382
01:51:33,230 --> 01:51:35,210
They don't make it.
Those kids don't make it.

2383
01:51:35,211 --> 01:51:36,590
That has been Nana's.
So yeah,

2384
01:51:36,591 --> 01:51:40,190
I think it's places like this where
people are dying of viruses cause you

2385
01:51:40,191 --> 01:51:41,330
don't,
you never really hear about it in

2386
01:51:41,331 --> 01:51:44,330
America that often.
Well people definitely die of the flu

2387
01:51:44,331 --> 01:51:46,400
here in America.
That's still happening.

2388
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,800
I bet thousands of people die every year
from the flu.

2389
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:53,480
But as far as how many people die from
diseases worldwide?

2390
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:57,560
I'm going to say every year.
I want to say 20 million.

2391
01:51:58,640 --> 01:51:59,750
How many?
How many people?

2392
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,860
It depends on like what kind of disease
cause there's lots of disease.

2393
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:04,670
Cardiovascular disease.
Oh yeah.

2394
01:52:04,671 --> 01:52:06,020
It was different.
But that's like,

2395
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,210
that's just like poor health.

2396
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:12,800
It says 2012 an estimated 56 million
people died.

2397
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:17,270
Just died in America.
The whole world?

2398
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:19,040
No,
no.

2399
01:52:19,730 --> 01:52:21,130
56 million.
1 million in the hole.

2400
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,850
It was America.
That'd be like in one year.

2401
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:26,690
That'd be a sixth of the country.
That wouldn't happen just America but in

2402
01:52:26,691 --> 01:52:29,590
the whole world only 56 million people
at a 7 billion.

2403
01:52:29,591 --> 01:52:32,490
And the either estimation I didn't,
they can't count on it.

2404
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:34,130
Would you have guessed that that would
be what it was?

2405
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:36,480
Uh,
I don't know.

2406
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,910
I would have thought I'd been way
higher.

2407
01:52:37,970 --> 01:52:40,530
What would you think?
Like pre or like how many people die in

2408
01:52:40,531 --> 01:52:43,820
the year?
Actually I think 56 million is a pretty

2409
01:52:43,821 --> 01:52:44,990
big number.
If you really stop,

2410
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:47,330
think about it.
And they're not counting anybody in

2411
01:52:47,331 --> 01:52:49,940
Africa.
No good luck.

2412
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:54,110
Certainly people in Canada that's twice
that at least twice I guess.

2413
01:52:54,111 --> 01:52:54,720
That makes sense.

2414
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:57,360
When you say disease,
this is HIV,

2415
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:02,030
syphilis and Medina crabs,
flu,

2416
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:04,350
Zika,
Zika.

2417
01:53:04,351 --> 01:53:06,660
I don't think Zeke is really killing
many people just fucks up.

2418
01:53:06,661 --> 01:53:09,630
Kids just really fucks women up when
they,

2419
01:53:09,690 --> 01:53:12,300
when they get apparently you can get and
not even know you have it.

2420
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,970
Get pregnant at fucks your kid up.

2421
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:21,560
Non Communicable disease is responsible
for 38 million of those.

2422
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,980
Okay,
so that's like heart disease and

2423
01:53:25,490 --> 01:53:28,490
cardiovascular.
11.6 million.

2424
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:29,510
But I want,
I want,

2425
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:32,720
what I'm interested in is like malaria
and shit like that.

2426
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:34,550
HIV,
uh,

2427
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:39,580
decreased slightly from 1.7 deaths and 2
million to 1.5 million sold in 2000 or

2428
01:53:40,881 --> 01:53:44,480
200,000 less.
1.5 million people die every year from

2429
01:53:44,481 --> 01:53:47,330
HIV.
Diarrhea is no longer among the top five

2430
01:53:47,331 --> 01:53:50,030
leading causes of death.
Diarrhea and aid.

2431
01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:54,910
Neck and neck
people die from diarrhea.

2432
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:55,841
Chorus.
Yeah,

2433
01:53:55,841 --> 01:53:59,200
they get dehydrated.
But how bizarre is it that that aids

2434
01:53:59,201 --> 01:54:04,201
kills that many people?
HIV deaths decreased 1.7 million to 1.5

2435
01:54:04,721 --> 01:54:08,350
million in 2012.
That's still crazy.

2436
01:54:08,590 --> 01:54:13,590
Like when was the last time you heard
about someone in America dying from HIV?

2437
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:19,850
You don't hear about it very often.
They say complications and they usually

2438
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:24,680
just something later.
It gets a deficiency is something that,

2439
01:54:24,710 --> 01:54:27,230
yeah,
that definitely can be it.

2440
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:29,780
You don't,
my uncle got whatever we cancer four

2441
01:54:29,781 --> 01:54:30,830
years ago.
Dot.

2442
01:54:30,831 --> 01:54:32,980
Whatever with cancer.
He got diagnosed with cancer.

2443
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:34,700
Okay.
Crazy one on west.

2444
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:35,900
Really?
When I pulled the gun on,

2445
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:38,570
you know he's still alive.
That happens.

2446
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:39,980
No Chemo.
What does he do?

2447
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:41,960
Change his whole diet.
No sugar.

2448
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:44,900
Everything is organic.
Really.

2449
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:48,110
Everything is organic.
Everything was Vegan and what happened?

2450
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:51,170
He's still alive.
He still works the door on his bar.

2451
01:54:51,171 --> 01:54:53,660
He just bitch slap somebody.
About three months ago,

2452
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:57,740
he still walks five miles a day.
Griffith Park and he still gets the bag

2453
01:54:57,741 --> 01:55:00,530
for now.
What's his cancer like to get it checked

2454
01:55:00,531 --> 01:55:02,930
out or it's just this fuck.
This is from testosterone.

2455
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:05,720
Cancers from testosterone with
testosterone.

2456
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:08,170
Since he was 35 he had three households
going.

2457
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:11,690
It's got three households going.
What do you mean?

2458
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:16,050
He had the wife and the kid,
oh this year told me that he cheated on

2459
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:19,730
her.
He had the hook her for 30 years who we

2460
01:55:19,731 --> 01:55:24,140
still has a relationship with and then
he fucked her cousin.

2461
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:26,900
She had a kid that lives in the
backyard.

2462
01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:32,120
Boris.
I got him in the back.

2463
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:37,660
Oh my God.
We household through not just what they

2464
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:39,060
all know about each other.
At least everybody,

2465
01:55:39,061 --> 01:55:39,740
buddy.
No,

2466
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:40,820
that's good.
Everybody is,

2467
01:55:40,821 --> 01:55:42,830
otherwise it'd be too much pressure.
The fucking,

2468
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:43,980
the wife just brought

2469
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:47,520
the kid home after he fucked the cousin
because it's like,

2470
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:49,200
all right.
He was fucking the straight when they

2471
01:55:49,201 --> 01:55:52,020
fucked her cousin once she had the kid
and she goes,

2472
01:55:52,021 --> 01:55:55,170
you went back with my cousin.
She just walked the kid to his house one

2473
01:55:55,171 --> 01:55:55,561
day.
She goes,

2474
01:55:55,561 --> 01:55:58,470
I don't want this fucking kid.
This is your problem.

2475
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:01,530
And she's never seen the kid say,
oh my God,

2476
01:56:01,531 --> 01:56:03,630
my uncle's got them in the back like
Boris.

2477
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:05,280
Oh my God,
I'm whipping him.

2478
01:56:05,281 --> 01:56:09,840
His shit he's got cover was that,
it's so crazy.

2479
01:56:09,841 --> 01:56:12,060
It's fucking career.
Three households.

2480
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:14,940
I have a hard time with my daughter and
my wife.

2481
01:56:14,941 --> 01:56:18,360
Never mind three fucking households.
Do you see a guy like that?

2482
01:56:18,361 --> 01:56:21,990
Does that just cause to for a
distraction or is he just retarded?

2483
01:56:21,991 --> 01:56:22,870
He's retarded.

2484
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:28,770
He's retired now.
He's banging a new one that's like

2485
01:56:28,780 --> 01:56:30,180
funny.
And how old is he?

2486
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:33,310
78 he's got a 40 year old,
a 40 year old man.

2487
01:56:33,311 --> 01:56:34,590
He hooks up,
went on Thursdays,

2488
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:38,540
and it takes it to the fish market.
You go to Orlando,

2489
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:40,200
real weird place.
Tell your girl,

2490
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,070
well,
he takes it down.

2491
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:44,160
There's a fish market.
So you saw the natural fish and shit.

2492
01:56:44,450 --> 01:56:46,170
Right?
And he fucks the shit out of and he

2493
01:56:46,171 --> 01:56:47,970
brings home,
it gives us some lung cancer.

2494
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:52,610
It gets a little heavy duty,
cancer day.

2495
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:55,830
Any rocks her world would.
So the whole family's concerned because

2496
01:56:55,831 --> 01:56:58,530
they know and he punches the ticket.
He's going to leave all his money to

2497
01:56:58,531 --> 01:56:59,860
her.
Ah.

2498
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:01,830
So everybody's pissed.
Don't make with like,

2499
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:03,870
we don't know what goes on Thursdays.
I do,

2500
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:08,100
but get your clock swigs isn't that
funny that people worry about that?

2501
01:57:08,101 --> 01:57:11,430
They're worried he'd like something more
than them when it comes to the money.

2502
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:13,320
Where's the money coming?
You know,

2503
01:57:13,321 --> 01:57:15,180
man,
it's one of the ugliest,

2504
01:57:15,450 --> 01:57:17,790
I just got a call from a school teacher
and he goes,

2505
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:20,790
I'm sorry I haven't gotten back to you.
He goes,

2506
01:57:20,791 --> 01:57:23,220
I've just had the hardest to once in my
fucking life.

2507
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:26,220
My mom died.
What a fucking nightmare.

2508
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:31,590
What a fucking nightmare death is.
And then there were big because nobody

2509
01:57:31,591 --> 01:57:34,080
gives a fuck.
And also it's like prince.

2510
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:36,510
Prince dies.
No will.

2511
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:41,430
$2 billion.
Six motherfucking savages.

2512
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:43,790
He had $2 billion.
What?

2513
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:45,840
He had 250 million.
Fuck.

2514
01:57:45,841 --> 01:57:48,180
He really had no,
well I've heard that a lot of things.

2515
01:57:48,181 --> 01:57:51,990
Talking about how,
how an investor involved in copyright.

2516
01:57:51,991 --> 01:57:55,290
He was with his own music,
which is especially why I changed his

2517
01:57:55,291 --> 01:57:58,710
name and to think he would not think to
have a will.

2518
01:57:58,711 --> 01:58:01,410
It seems really strange.
Some people who think it's bad luck.

2519
01:58:02,690 --> 01:58:04,380
Yeah.
Prince was crazy.

2520
01:58:04,381 --> 01:58:06,210
Just crazy.
Like you think that that would be odd

2521
01:58:06,211 --> 01:58:07,980
for him to not have a will?
I don't know.

2522
01:58:07,981 --> 01:58:09,300
I don't,
I don't think it would be that odd.

2523
01:58:09,301 --> 01:58:14,270
He was so odd anyway,
being that invested in your money cause

2524
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:16,080
that's what he was worried about with
knowing all this thing.

2525
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:17,160
That's the last,
I don't know.

2526
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:20,730
Maybe it doesn't care valuable.
Maybe didn't want to be valuable when he

2527
01:58:20,731 --> 01:58:23,730
was dead to family members and shit.
Maybe he did want to like have that.

2528
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:25,440
He's like,
who cares what happens to my money when

2529
01:58:25,441 --> 01:58:27,660
I'm dead?
The problem is the government gets a big

2530
01:58:27,661 --> 01:58:29,730
chunk of it.
If you don't have it written off,

2531
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:31,710
if you don't have a given off to,
uh,

2532
01:58:31,730 --> 01:58:32,870
various family members,
I,

2533
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:36,660
the government gets up fat piece,
but don't they still get a piece?

2534
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:38,280
They definitely get a piece.
They get a piece.

2535
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:40,860
Not only do they get a piece,
they get a piece from money that you've

2536
01:58:40,861 --> 01:58:42,130
already been taxed on.
Like say

2537
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:43,570
of Joe,
he makes $1 million,

2538
01:58:43,571 --> 01:58:45,190
right?
And Joey is $1 million in the bank and

2539
01:58:45,191 --> 01:58:49,060
he leaves it all to you.
Joey didn't make $1 million to get $1

2540
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:50,800
million.
He had to make way more than a million

2541
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,690
dollars.
So he probably had to make closer to two

2542
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:58,080
because when you get over $250,000,
tax percentage is like 40 something

2543
01:58:58,571 --> 01:59:01,900
percent.
And then sales tax and all the other

2544
01:59:01,901 --> 01:59:03,670
taxes that you have to take,
any consideration,

2545
01:59:03,671 --> 01:59:06,160
state tax,
all this different stuff,

2546
01:59:06,161 --> 01:59:07,270
right?
Property tax,

2547
01:59:07,370 --> 01:59:10,780
I think about all the taxes you pay to
save up a million bucks get,

2548
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:13,360
it's a lot of money.
So if he leaves out of that million

2549
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:14,860
bucks to you,
you don't get the million dollars,

2550
01:59:14,861 --> 01:59:17,200
you have to be tax on that million
dollars.

2551
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,380
So you have to be taxed on money.
He's already been taxed on.

2552
01:59:20,710 --> 01:59:23,080
It's not like he's,
unless he gives you a gold coins.

2553
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:25,420
But even if he gives you gold coins,
you Oh,

2554
01:59:25,421 --> 01:59:30,421
the value of those gold coins in tax,
you owe a percentage in tax.

2555
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:35,940
So let's say if I to sit rows,
I have a safe and every day I put a gold

2556
01:59:36,821 --> 01:59:38,710
coin in there.
I put money in the bank.

2557
01:59:38,711 --> 01:59:41,530
You got a half a mil in the bank or they
with thousands thousand savings.

2558
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:45,070
But I probably got like 2 million back
thing coins and nobody knows what I

2559
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:48,280
leaving cause Joe Rogan to pay taxes on
that.

2560
01:59:48,290 --> 01:59:51,610
Yes,
I would legit even if nobody would.

2561
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:52,830
Well,
if otherwise it would,

2562
01:59:52,831 --> 01:59:55,510
it wouldn't be mine unless you'd written
it off to me.

2563
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:57,610
Right.
So once you write it off to me,

2564
01:59:57,611 --> 01:59:59,920
then it becomes mine.
So if it becomes mine,

2565
02:00:00,070 --> 02:00:01,630
that's some money that someone just gave
me.

2566
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:06,010
I got to pay tax on it.
Uncle Sam is just a robber just to like,

2567
02:00:06,011 --> 02:00:06,910
oh,
what'd you get a gift,

2568
02:00:06,911 --> 02:00:08,590
Joey?
You get a gift from me.

2569
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:10,480
That's nice.
That's nice.

2570
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:13,390
How come I didn't get a gift?
Where's my fucking gift?

2571
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:15,630
But what if I want my fuck?
What the fuck?

2572
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:20,020
What have Uncle Sam don't know about
that 2 million?

2573
02:00:20,021 --> 02:00:20,860
Would you rat?
Well,

2574
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:22,840
you have to.
You have to figure out a way that you

2575
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:25,870
have that 2 million.
See if someone gives it to you.

2576
02:00:25,930 --> 02:00:28,390
What does this gift tax.
Okay.

2577
02:00:28,420 --> 02:00:31,660
How's that work?
The following gifts are considered to be

2578
02:00:31,661 --> 02:00:36,661
taxable gifts when they exceed an annual
gift exclusion amount of $14,000 taxable

2579
02:00:38,051 --> 02:00:43,051
gifts count as part five point $3
million in 2014 you're allowed to give

2580
02:00:43,121 --> 02:00:46,630
away during your lifetime before you
must pay the gift tax.

2581
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:51,690
Why hold the fuck on gifts subjects to
the d?

2582
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:55,330
So if I give you something and it is
expensive,

2583
02:00:55,480 --> 02:01:00,460
you have to pay a gift tax.
It's over a certain amount of money.

2584
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:02,390
That's disgusting.
Thousand Dollars.

2585
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:05,530
That's disgusting.
It really is.

2586
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:08,980
It's really sad.
That's just sad.

2587
02:01:09,190 --> 02:01:12,850
It's sad that we live in this fucking
country that thinks it's okay to steal

2588
02:01:12,851 --> 02:01:14,110
money like that from people.

2589
02:01:14,410 --> 02:01:17,770
Like say if you don't have anything and
you know you don't make a lot of money

2590
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:22,630
and a guy gives you $20,000 you have to
give the government a piece of that

2591
02:01:22,631 --> 02:01:26,920
$20,000 fuck them.
Fuck them.

2592
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:29,830
I mean fuck that.
That's bullshit.

2593
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:31,750
What about when you like when I first
moved here,

2594
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:36,580
it was my first like real adult job and
I figured out I was working in 30% of

2595
02:01:36,581 --> 02:01:39,530
the time for the government.
They take 30% yeah,

2596
02:01:39,590 --> 02:01:42,090
directly out of and it just,
it blew my mind.

2597
02:01:42,091 --> 02:01:43,910
And then,
and then like I don't know what's going

2598
02:01:43,911 --> 02:01:45,470
on with trump,
but like in the last election,

2599
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:48,890
I think Mitt Romney finally came out
until he paid like something like 17%

2600
02:01:49,580 --> 02:01:51,630
which is not like they,
it's an,

2601
02:01:51,631 --> 02:01:52,730
it's,
it's so sad.

2602
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:54,890
It's,
it frustrates people when like the rich

2603
02:01:54,891 --> 02:01:58,680
people can have all those deductions and
pay 17% oh yeah,

2604
02:01:58,850 --> 02:02:02,270
we're paying 30 well there's tax
shelters and then there's also storing

2605
02:02:02,271 --> 02:02:03,200
money overseas.

2606
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:05,150
That's where thing gets things gear real
weird.

2607
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:10,310
Cause there's a lot of super fucking
uber rich people that have a fuck load

2608
02:02:10,311 --> 02:02:14,660
of money stored overseas.
And by doing that and by these oh,

2609
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:18,680
these overseas tax shelters,
they can fucking hide a lot of money.

2610
02:02:18,830 --> 02:02:22,340
You know who's got that going on?
I remember that dude who had those late

2611
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:24,410
night commercials,
the weight loss secrets.

2612
02:02:24,411 --> 02:02:26,540
They don't want you to know about Kevin
Trudeau.

2613
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:28,490
Remember that Kevin Trudeau guy?
Yeah.

2614
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:33,610
That guy made a fucking grip of money
ripping people off and vanished and uh,

2615
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:36,740
he went to jail,
he went to jail.

2616
02:02:36,741 --> 02:02:38,590
But the money vanished.
Like he just like,

2617
02:02:38,591 --> 02:02:40,790
there's a lot like he's claiming he
doesn't know where any of it is.

2618
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:43,940
And so then they'll lock them up.
They're going to lock them up for like

2619
02:02:43,941 --> 02:02:46,100
10 years.
But then once he gets out,

2620
02:02:46,101 --> 02:02:47,650
that guy's going to get in the fucking
raft.

2621
02:02:47,650 --> 02:02:50,780
It's going to peddle out to the middle
of the ocean to get picked up by a yacht

2622
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:55,010
and swept off to Costa Rica or wherever
the fuck he's got that money hidden like

2623
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:58,220
these,
a lot of these reg really rich dudes,

2624
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:02,420
they figure out a way to preserve as
much of that money as possible.

2625
02:03:02,570 --> 02:03:05,480
That's why they kind of like Bernie
Sanders comes along and they fucking

2626
02:03:05,481 --> 02:03:08,330
freak out.
He was shot him up,

2627
02:03:08,570 --> 02:03:13,570
shut him up the fuck is he saying he
wants more people to pay how much and

2628
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:18,530
then there's like there's rates while he
was in favor of like say if you make a

2629
02:03:18,531 --> 02:03:21,440
certain amount of year,
like if you make more than $15 million a

2630
02:03:21,441 --> 02:03:23,540
year,
let's just make up a number then every

2631
02:03:23,541 --> 02:03:28,541
dollar over that they could tax you buy
like some stupid amount wasn't only 90%

2632
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:29,550
percent.
Yeah.

2633
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:33,800
Yeah.
And he said he didn't think that was too

2634
02:03:33,801 --> 02:03:34,634
much.

2635
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:39,050
The idea is like you shouldn't be
winning the game that that much like if

2636
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:43,340
the game is about money and the idea is
like well we should probably be control

2637
02:03:43,341 --> 02:03:45,770
how much money people make.
Cause it shouldn't be just about money,

2638
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:48,410
should be about productivity,
how much you contribute.

2639
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:52,010
It shouldn't be that you figure out how
to move numbers around and some

2640
02:03:52,011 --> 02:03:56,090
accounts.
And because of that you've made $3

2641
02:03:56,090 --> 02:03:57,170
billion.
Like what have you done?

2642
02:03:57,171 --> 02:03:59,150
What have you actually contributed to
society?

2643
02:03:59,450 --> 02:04:02,690
You figured out some weird little
loopholes and little sneaky ways you can

2644
02:04:02,691 --> 02:04:07,610
move ones and Zeros around on servers.
And because of that you've made $1

2645
02:04:07,610 --> 02:04:10,490
billion.
Like so his idea is that that shouldn't

2646
02:04:10,491 --> 02:04:12,350
be possible.
And that after,

2647
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:14,060
you know,
it's not like you can't be rich,

2648
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:16,760
but everything after like $15 million a
year,

2649
02:04:16,761 --> 02:04:18,740
you got to fucking just give it all
back.

2650
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:21,620
But that people are not going to work
that hard.

2651
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:25,010
They're going to get to that $15 million
a year mark and they got a slow it down,

2652
02:04:25,011 --> 02:04:26,900
a backing off,
just go on vacation.

2653
02:04:26,901 --> 02:04:28,220
Yeah.
And they're every,

2654
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:32,510
well it slows productivity cause those
crazy fucks is dark as it is.

2655
02:04:32,511 --> 02:04:35,030
Like they have to be washed.
She's just gotta be some regulation

2656
02:04:35,031 --> 02:04:36,830
because greedy fucking people get
greedy.

2657
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:40,710
But if you don't have their,
their ability to push it to the limit,

2658
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,790
if they don't have that ability,
we'll have a lot less things that are

2659
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:47,880
new,
a lot less innovation does be a lot

2660
02:04:47,881 --> 02:04:49,110
less.
Um,

2661
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:52,950
the companies like huge companies like
apple and companies where you buy like

2662
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:54,870
awesome shit,
it's going to be a lot less of them.

2663
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:58,260
They just,
people are not going to push that hard

2664
02:04:59,310 --> 02:05:01,320
cause they did not going to get the
benefits that you like.

2665
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:05,850
You get crazy benefits when you're some
Elon musk character.

2666
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:07,860
You know when you've got billions and
billions of dollars.

2667
02:05:07,861 --> 02:05:11,250
He's a crazy benefit to that.
Not just a benefit in terms of like

2668
02:05:11,251 --> 02:05:16,251
being a guy who's like an innovator and
someone who makes cool shit.

2669
02:05:16,801 --> 02:05:20,460
But there's also benefits financially.
Like the guy lives in a castle,

2670
02:05:20,490 --> 02:05:22,320
right?
He can do whatever the fuck he wants.

2671
02:05:22,321 --> 02:05:26,100
He flies around in private jets.
If you're limiting people and living in

2672
02:05:26,101 --> 02:05:28,350
there,
the amount of money they can make that

2673
02:05:28,351 --> 02:05:30,240
drastically,
you're going to lose a lot of those

2674
02:05:30,241 --> 02:05:32,910
people.
It's not a good argument for a

2675
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:35,090
going against

2676
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:40,120
sort of organizing wealth to the point
where wealth distribution,

2677
02:05:40,990 --> 02:05:43,240
but it's a,
it's the reality of human nature.

2678
02:05:43,870 --> 02:05:44,720
You know,
people,

2679
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,870
people aren't gonna work that hard if
they can't make a grip of money they

2680
02:05:47,871 --> 02:05:51,580
want to make.
But again,

2681
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:55,890
I put a box of $2 million and I leave
with you.

2682
02:05:55,950 --> 02:05:59,420
I think at the fucking wake.
My wife cause you to my and then I have

2683
02:05:59,421 --> 02:06:01,460
to pay.
Would you have to,

2684
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,260
why?
Because you go to jail.

2685
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:06,770
How would you,
how would they find that?

2686
02:06:07,330 --> 02:06:09,620
They're going to find out because I have
$2 million all of a sudden.

2687
02:06:09,621 --> 02:06:11,150
No they're not.
What do I do with the money?

2688
02:06:11,151 --> 02:06:12,770
Just keep it in a bag.
No,

2689
02:06:13,910 --> 02:06:14,461
but you know,
you,

2690
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:15,500
you money has like,

2691
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:18,430
like they could find out,
but if they see is,

2692
02:06:18,450 --> 02:06:19,340
here's the thing,
if you,

2693
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:23,480
if they found out you're going to jail,
you'd have to trust the person.

2694
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:25,160
If you have $2 million,
listen,

2695
02:06:25,190 --> 02:06:28,160
if you have $2 million and you go to
jail,

2696
02:06:28,161 --> 02:06:31,310
you would give that $2 million back to
get out of jail.

2697
02:06:31,990 --> 02:06:34,480
You wouldn't know somebody who died and
left a million cash.

2698
02:06:34,481 --> 02:06:36,910
It was illegal type shady character in
their hands.

2699
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:41,170
The money went to three different places
and now the sisters got it and she never

2700
02:06:41,171 --> 02:06:43,120
paid taxes.
She just came from Cuba.

2701
02:06:43,290 --> 02:06:45,010
She is spending a little bit here and
there.

2702
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:48,500
If I gave you $2 million,
the first thing you'd do is go to the

2703
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:52,030
Lee.
Lee's got a restaurant on Ventura

2704
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:54,820
Boulevard.
Angelina's I don't know what he grosses

2705
02:06:54,821 --> 02:06:56,380
out of that.
When you go to the lead and you go,

2706
02:06:56,381 --> 02:06:57,790
I'm going to give you a hundred grand a
year,

2707
02:06:58,180 --> 02:07:02,080
you're going to pay me 60
I'm not going to show up to work.

2708
02:07:02,290 --> 02:07:05,650
You're going to pay me 60 grand a year
and get my money back and I'll pay taxes

2709
02:07:05,651 --> 02:07:08,460
on that stupid amount.
I didn't give him nobody a half a

2710
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:11,320
million dollars that you left me.
That's an interesting way to do it.

2711
02:07:11,390 --> 02:07:14,210
To have like a no workshop you to pay
somebody.

2712
02:07:14,211 --> 02:07:16,570
You keep 40 why can't do it?
It's illegal.

2713
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:20,080
40 grand.
Shut your fucking mouth til the day I

2714
02:07:20,081 --> 02:07:22,400
die.
So the day I died,

2715
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:25,320
you got an extra 40 off me just for
doing the paperwork this month.

2716
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:28,950
Well that would work if you could do it
this way to do it.

2717
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:31,480
Somebody leaves me 2 million fucking
dollars.

2718
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:34,900
That's not in the television industry.
This guy sold coke or whatever.

2719
02:07:34,930 --> 02:07:35,980
Here's the problem.
You're saying

2720
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,620
Dick,
that person I saying Dick Dog,

2721
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:42,530
that person has to figure out a way to
justify getting that money like that.

2722
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:45,010
Where do you get that hundred thousand
dollars where'd that go?

2723
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:46,150
Nobody knows.
Now listen,

2724
02:07:46,690 --> 02:07:48,970
there's tons of people that have done
shit.

2725
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:52,210
You just said it you so listen.
You work hard for your money.

2726
02:07:52,211 --> 02:07:54,100
You're going to send money to some
fucking Bahamian.

2727
02:07:54,101 --> 02:07:59,101
Back with two fucking guys were weapon
is holding your money.

2728
02:07:59,141 --> 02:08:02,590
Good fucking luck.
Nobody sends over 50 mil unless they got

2729
02:08:02,591 --> 02:08:05,110
50 mil hidden over here.
I wouldn't,

2730
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:08,380
I wouldn't.
You see what happened to Johnny Depp in

2731
02:08:08,381 --> 02:08:11,770
that movie there with the coke?
When he went back down in the Panamanian

2732
02:08:11,771 --> 02:08:15,670
government took his fucking money.
It took $250 million from a little more

2733
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:17,770
blow.
That happens all the time.

2734
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:20,620
That happens all the fucking time.
They'll switch back accounts.

2735
02:08:20,621 --> 02:08:23,560
You trust somebody with your fucking $10
million over that.

2736
02:08:23,650 --> 02:08:27,040
Really for me to put $10 million,
12 hours from me,

2737
02:08:27,330 --> 02:08:29,500
I can have 10 million.
That was close by too.

2738
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:35,110
That's gotta be so I know.
Thousand you know if,

2739
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:39,630
if when they watched narcos,
those fucking Panamanians whenever they

2740
02:08:39,631 --> 02:08:40,800
were,
they making so much money.

2741
02:08:40,801 --> 02:08:44,790
They were burying that Colombians
burying it looked like it was seeds.

2742
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:46,980
Yeah,
just plant the money tree.

2743
02:08:47,010 --> 02:08:48,720
They had to figure out where to put it.
What are they saying?

2744
02:08:48,721 --> 02:08:51,690
He spent 2,500 a month on rubber bands.
Four or something crazy.

2745
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:57,770
You know how many millions of dollars?
20 how much money?

2746
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:00,990
500 is what I saw on rubber bands at one
time.

2747
02:09:00,991 --> 02:09:03,000
He broke $1 million just to stay warm.

2748
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:06,340
Jesus cried.
It was cold at night.

2749
02:09:06,341 --> 02:09:08,890
He just put money on the thing limit
just to stay warm.

2750
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:12,880
I wonder what keeps a guy like that?
Here's a perfect example.

2751
02:09:12,910 --> 02:09:16,540
I mean not it's obviously drug dealing
and not capitalism,

2752
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:19,330
but what keeps a guy pushing when he's
making that much money?

2753
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:22,240
What keeps the guy from Virgin American
look,

2754
02:09:22,241 --> 02:09:25,180
keeps an American,
will keeps trump building and making

2755
02:09:25,181 --> 02:09:26,530
millions of things.
What is it?

2756
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:28,120
Power,
right?

2757
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:30,980
It's gotta be three of the seven.
Yeah.

2758
02:09:30,990 --> 02:09:33,220
You were speaking about addiction to
drama earlier.

2759
02:09:33,250 --> 02:09:35,050
It seems like.
What would be the same thing?

2760
02:09:35,051 --> 02:09:37,660
Get Your Dick sucked by that.
Listen,

2761
02:09:37,690 --> 02:09:42,640
that rats ate $1 billion of Pablo
Escobar's profits each year.

2762
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:48,640
He was earning so much a year.
We would write off 10% of the money

2763
02:09:48,641 --> 02:09:52,330
because rats would eat it in storage or
be damaged by water or lost.

2764
02:09:52,331 --> 02:09:56,120
Holy Shit.
Cartel spent 25 yeah,

2765
02:09:56,121 --> 02:09:57,910
and rubber bands to hold the money
together.

2766
02:09:58,150 --> 02:10:01,090
Oh my God.
This is a crazy stats,

2767
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:04,780
but the thing about Escobar's,
he made more money than you could ever

2768
02:10:04,781 --> 02:10:08,800
possibly spend and yet he kept working.
He kept wanting that money to come in.

2769
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:13,090
He kept working and from the little I've
seen people loved him there.

2770
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:15,040
Yeah.
Cause he would build soccer stadiums and

2771
02:10:15,041 --> 02:10:16,990
do all of them.
I think that's part of the reason why

2772
02:10:16,991 --> 02:10:20,680
people get annoyed with trump or whoever
you want to say here because it doesn't

2773
02:10:20,681 --> 02:10:23,230
seem like they're doing anything.
Well it's also that thing when you're

2774
02:10:23,231 --> 02:10:27,280
selling drugs you get locked up in a
business like Escobar was we had so much

2775
02:10:27,281 --> 02:10:30,400
power and so much drugs he was selling.
You don't want to give that power to

2776
02:10:30,401 --> 02:10:33,190
somebody else.
So once you've got that whole thing down

2777
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:33,980
and you're making all that

2778
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:37,160
money like do you,
you must be incredibly reluctant to give

2779
02:10:37,161 --> 02:10:39,770
that up.
I mean think about how long it took him

2780
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:43,820
to to put together the network to make
the kind of money that he was making

2781
02:10:43,821 --> 02:10:47,060
towards the end.
Very reluctant to just hand that over to

2782
02:10:47,061 --> 02:10:50,590
somebody else because the business is
always going to be there that the demand

2783
02:10:50,591 --> 02:10:52,970
is always going to be there,
the supplies it was going to be there,

2784
02:10:53,330 --> 02:10:56,780
like who's making these transactions?
You just have to give it to somebody

2785
02:10:56,781 --> 02:10:59,030
else.
And then plus you'd open yourself up to

2786
02:10:59,031 --> 02:11:03,020
all these other fucking drug dealers
becoming just as crazy as you were when

2787
02:11:03,021 --> 02:11:05,540
you're coked up and nuts.
He,

2788
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:06,130
I read it.

2789
02:11:06,130 --> 02:11:09,150
One of his books,
I read one of the books by a Colombian

2790
02:11:09,190 --> 02:11:11,980
journalists,
like I just don't read any off of.

2791
02:11:11,981 --> 02:11:15,250
This guy was referred to me like this
guy really worked in the transit.

2792
02:11:15,730 --> 02:11:18,890
He was an amazing
eye.

2793
02:11:19,030 --> 02:11:23,860
He couldn't read any CEO fucking 500
company and how it's them with a third

2794
02:11:23,861 --> 02:11:25,570
grade education.
What did he have?

2795
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:29,590
He knew he knew what he had.
He knew the price.

2796
02:11:30,010 --> 02:11:34,750
He knew how to buy people off and he
knew how to speak like he was a fucking

2797
02:11:34,751 --> 02:11:36,460
Yanno like have you looked at them in
the street?

2798
02:11:36,461 --> 02:11:38,950
And I go,
that guy makes 6 million and out where

2799
02:11:38,951 --> 02:11:39,671
you'd go,
Joey.

2800
02:11:39,671 --> 02:11:42,700
Look,
it was a belt buckle was belt buckle was

2801
02:11:42,701 --> 02:11:44,260
got.
I got a belt buckle is big,

2802
02:11:46,150 --> 02:11:50,050
but the guy made so much money.
I knew a guy that was making 6 million

2803
02:11:50,051 --> 02:11:54,100
every six weeks,
6 million every six weeks because I know

2804
02:11:54,101 --> 02:11:54,760
him personally.

2805
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:56,200
No,
but I knew him on site.

2806
02:11:56,201 --> 02:11:58,120
I knew what he did.
Was He doing?

2807
02:11:58,420 --> 02:11:59,740
He was,
what do you think he was doing?

2808
02:11:59,980 --> 02:12:04,030
He wasn't even looking at the code.
You understand me?

2809
02:12:04,031 --> 02:12:07,950
I wasn't even looking at,
it was coming from Columbia with Landon,

2810
02:12:07,990 --> 02:12:12,990
Denver and from then he would ship it to
no walkie Hawaii and all the states

2811
02:12:13,631 --> 02:12:14,620
around it.
Cause that what?

2812
02:12:14,621 --> 02:12:19,621
He shipped that drought,
white people with a family put in the

2813
02:12:19,631 --> 02:12:23,700
trunk of a car and we're going scan me
and why?

2814
02:12:23,710 --> 02:12:26,350
Why are you going skiing?
And you got 25 fucking pounds.

2815
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:29,620
My the back of your truck.
You don't even see it.

2816
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:32,320
You can just say you go somewhere,
you meet somebody handed off.

2817
02:12:32,510 --> 02:12:35,720
You don't even have him go home.
Just give him the car

2818
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:39,590
like a movie.
It's like a giant time.

2819
02:12:39,591 --> 02:12:40,670
I'll just give him the car.

2820
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:42,730
You see all this giant dip shit that's
going on in the news.

2821
02:12:43,070 --> 02:12:45,220
Johnny Depp is girl.
Doug Stan Hope wrote an article.

2822
02:12:45,790 --> 02:12:47,200
It's scary.
Yeah.

2823
02:12:47,930 --> 02:12:51,460
Well it's one of two things.
Either giant deb really beat up his

2824
02:12:51,461 --> 02:12:55,540
girlfriend or his girlfriend is lying
and saying that giant depth beat him up

2825
02:12:55,541 --> 02:12:58,210
and Stan hope and his girlfriend saw it
the whole time.

2826
02:12:58,270 --> 02:13:00,780
That Stan hopes version of it.
I trust Dan up.

2827
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:03,640
I trust him very well.
I trust Dan hope,

2828
02:13:03,641 --> 02:13:06,460
but as much as anybody I know.
So if he says that,

2829
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:08,890
that she was manipulating him and that
she was going to,

2830
02:13:10,090 --> 02:13:12,850
she had said and he had was worried that
she was going to do this.

2831
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:16,000
Yeah.
Johnny Depp was being blackmailed by

2832
02:13:16,001 --> 02:13:18,400
amber heard.
Here's how I know guest column,

2833
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:23,520
Doug's Dan hope the rap bunch of people
got upset at me for tweeting that it's

2834
02:13:24,281 --> 02:13:27,400
cause it's,
you're not supposed to take a side.

2835
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,290
Uh,
and if you do take aside,

2836
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:32,130
do you have to take the side because a
woman's

2837
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:35,700
should could potentially be actually
getting abused.

2838
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:37,590
Did he get arrested?
I don't think so.

2839
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:41,580
The cops came and I think they found no
evidence of what happens when the cops

2840
02:13:41,581 --> 02:13:43,170
come and there's an argument now.
Yeah,

2841
02:13:43,171 --> 02:13:44,400
they take you away.
It's not good.

2842
02:13:44,610 --> 02:13:45,660
Yeah.
They take the man away.

2843
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:46,770
No.
I'm also wasn't there.

2844
02:13:46,771 --> 02:13:48,510
He split the scene.
Did he?

2845
02:13:48,630 --> 02:13:49,590
Yeah,
he fled the scene.

2846
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:52,320
But if there was a problem they'll come
and got it.

2847
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:57,150
So with the pictures,
if there was pictures and shit's broken

2848
02:13:57,151 --> 02:13:59,700
now because of old Jay,
you have to,

2849
02:14:00,210 --> 02:14:04,070
especially in La.
Yeah,

2850
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:08,160
it's specially in la,
but it's weird how many people like

2851
02:14:08,161 --> 02:14:10,170
automatically assumed that he was
beating her up.

2852
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:14,970
It's um,
why is it that someone wants to pick a

2853
02:14:14,971 --> 02:14:18,840
side?
Is it like to show that you're a good

2854
02:14:18,841 --> 02:14:21,210
person and you side with the woman
always.

2855
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:22,170
Is that what it is?

2856
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:23,460
Like what's going on?
Like why,

2857
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:28,500
why do people pretend that some people
aren't manipulative at some?

2858
02:14:28,501 --> 02:14:31,770
Some people are manipulative and we know
that,

2859
02:14:31,771 --> 02:14:32,910
right?
We know some people are going to be

2860
02:14:32,911 --> 02:14:34,770
live.
We know some people lie and we know some

2861
02:14:34,771 --> 02:14:36,330
people set people up.
We know some people,

2862
02:14:36,331 --> 02:14:37,710
black male,
we know that's real,

2863
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:40,410
but why?
How come when it's a girl we all of a

2864
02:14:40,411 --> 02:14:41,940
sudden go away.
I can't think that way,

2865
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:44,100
man.
I can't believe you're supporting a wife

2866
02:14:44,101 --> 02:14:44,934
beater.
Like,

2867
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:46,980
what do you,
she knew that she had a scar.

2868
02:14:46,981 --> 02:14:50,580
She had a scar over her eyes.
She got a restraining order.

2869
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:52,800
I just can't figure out why they didn't
arrest him.

2870
02:14:53,850 --> 02:14:55,890
Yeah,
maybe he's got recordings or something,

2871
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:58,740
maybe know something,
but he definitely has a bunch of

2872
02:14:58,741 --> 02:14:59,910
witnesses saying that.
Uh,

2873
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:02,520
Johnny Depp was worried about it before
it ever happened.

2874
02:15:02,730 --> 02:15:03,900
First of all,
Joe Rogan,

2875
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:05,940
they live in a creepy,
creepy.

2876
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:08,970
How so?
They don't live in a real life.

2877
02:15:08,971 --> 02:15:11,760
Joe Rogan,
I love Johnny Depp.

2878
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:16,440
He's done some great movies,
but any of those actors at that level,

2879
02:15:16,710 --> 02:15:18,150
you just had a,
you just said,

2880
02:15:18,151 --> 02:15:19,500
uh,
you were talking about,

2881
02:15:19,501 --> 02:15:20,500
I just saw clip.
Well,

2882
02:15:20,501 --> 02:15:23,460
you told me personally about you went to
Naomi Campbell was party.

2883
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:26,820
How is that different from your fucking
birthday body weight?

2884
02:15:26,821 --> 02:15:28,110
First of all,
I know you're 20 years.

2885
02:15:28,410 --> 02:15:30,120
I don't have birthday parties.
Birthday parties.

2886
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:32,100
Okay.
That's number one.

2887
02:15:32,101 --> 02:15:35,580
Gives you the right,
you're looking at inviting like Thursday

2888
02:15:35,580 --> 02:15:38,990
night at seven cafe landwatch right.
You know,

2889
02:15:39,150 --> 02:15:40,700
bring a gift.
We're going to have dinner.

2890
02:15:40,730 --> 02:15:42,390
Listen,
I wouldn't go to your fucking birthday

2891
02:15:42,391 --> 02:15:45,060
party if you're born with fire crackers
out of your ass.

2892
02:15:45,061 --> 02:15:47,310
Cause that's not me.
That's not the world I'm from.

2893
02:15:47,311 --> 02:15:50,580
Once you 15 and you get roller skates,
birthdays are over,

2894
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:54,750
you get a kiss and a blow job from your
wife.

2895
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:56,370
I don't even give a fuck about a cake
anymore.

2896
02:15:57,420 --> 02:15:59,340
I do on the show.
Went to a birthday party.

2897
02:15:59,341 --> 02:16:01,380
Okay.
When you live in that realm,

2898
02:16:01,381 --> 02:16:05,670
we started him thinking,
what the fuck and Jayda Pinkett and that

2899
02:16:05,671 --> 02:16:06,660
black dude,
what's his name,

2900
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:10,050
will smith if they lived in Philadelphia
with that son of this,

2901
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:13,800
pick that motherfucker.
You've ever seen the pilot of empire?

2902
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:14,911
No.
You didn't.

2903
02:16:14,911 --> 02:16:16,290
No.
Pilot of empire.

2904
02:16:16,291 --> 02:16:19,140
It has something very interesting that
nobody caught in this country.

2905
02:16:19,530 --> 02:16:22,560
Nobody said done the pilot of empire,
the Black Dude,

2906
02:16:22,650 --> 02:16:23,590
uh,
uh,

2907
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:25,800
turnstiles lonely with a pimp,
whatever.

2908
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:29,170
This is seen in that with a young kid
that's gay.

2909
02:16:29,171 --> 02:16:29,990
Comes out with lady

2910
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:30,823
shoes.
Huh?

2911
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:34,300
And he's writing a lyric to a rap song
like,

2912
02:16:34,301 --> 02:16:35,134
yeah,
the,

2913
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:38,500
he sees the kid,
he picks him up and he puts them in that

2914
02:16:38,501 --> 02:16:39,334
garbage can.

2915
02:16:41,430 --> 02:16:42,470
Did you know that?
No,

2916
02:16:42,471 --> 02:16:44,120
I didn't know that.
He runs in and they're like,

2917
02:16:44,121 --> 02:16:45,950
what'd you do when he goes,
fuck that motherfucker.

2918
02:16:46,310 --> 02:16:49,130
I ain't gonna have no faggots labored in
my fucking house and all this shit.

2919
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:52,040
When I came from Cuba,
the first family I haven't counted

2920
02:16:52,041 --> 02:16:54,410
before the deal,
Lorenzo's was a black family.

2921
02:16:55,010 --> 02:16:56,720
They didn't say the word nigger in the
house.

2922
02:16:57,110 --> 02:17:01,400
This is the 70s and you couldn't even
talk about a gay relative.

2923
02:17:02,030 --> 02:17:06,410
That's why I always knew that gay guys
in the NFL and the NBA,

2924
02:17:06,411 --> 02:17:09,740
that shit ain't gonna work though.
That's just never going to work.

2925
02:17:09,741 --> 02:17:14,000
It's like a hidden thing.
But remember when they first introduced

2926
02:17:14,001 --> 02:17:17,570
the gay basketball player in the NBA,
people were jumping up for joy and not

2927
02:17:17,571 --> 02:17:19,310
those brothers.
Those brothers were on the phone with

2928
02:17:19,311 --> 02:17:22,700
the general manager going to listen.
This shit's deep rooted.

2929
02:17:22,820 --> 02:17:24,410
I don't want no game.
I was looking at my thing.

2930
02:17:24,411 --> 02:17:27,560
I don't care if he's black or not.
A lot of people can't say that in

2931
02:17:27,561 --> 02:17:29,240
public.
They would be,

2932
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:32,340
people can't talk.
When we really liked anymore,

2933
02:17:32,990 --> 02:17:35,030
people just say shit just to fucking
sad.

2934
02:17:35,720 --> 02:17:38,930
We don't come from that fake worlds,
man.

2935
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:41,600
We haven't been sucked into that
Hollywood world.

2936
02:17:41,630 --> 02:17:43,640
We won't allow it.
We won't allow it.

2937
02:17:43,641 --> 02:17:46,790
We just were having a Hollywood party.
What happened?

2938
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:50,580
I don't leave to go to premieres.
I don't know.

2939
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:56,600
I see people kissing cheeks twice
cause I need to be there.

2940
02:17:57,890 --> 02:17:59,930
So they come from a different world.
Joe Rogan,

2941
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:04,040
what they see as reality and fucking
what's going on.

2942
02:18:04,041 --> 02:18:06,200
It's not really going on because they've
sucked up.

2943
02:18:06,350 --> 02:18:09,650
How many times you've been on the set
and what you're looking at is dog shit

2944
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:12,120
and they laughing and giggling.

2945
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:13,730
Laughing,
fake laughing.

2946
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:15,740
That's not the world I came from.
The producer.

2947
02:18:15,741 --> 02:18:18,930
Fake laugh is that's a real thing.
We tell the,

2948
02:18:19,030 --> 02:18:22,070
I heard that they have to keep you up.
Build you up.

2949
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:24,500
It's on the 30th take.
That was hilarious.

2950
02:18:24,501 --> 02:18:26,590
No ones.
I know what?

2951
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:28,580
How about I come to your house and tell
you the same jokes?

2952
02:18:29,750 --> 02:18:31,910
Same joke word for word.
You're going to be giggling.

2953
02:18:31,911 --> 02:18:33,350
Nugget know don't,
don't do this to me.

2954
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:36,050
Something that's too much.
So you got to assume these people are

2955
02:18:36,051 --> 02:18:38,980
living in this fucking world.
That God,

2956
02:18:39,060 --> 02:18:43,240
she was on the phone,
a friend and she calls her friends at

2957
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:48,260
dot nine one one and all this shit.
You know who the fuck knows joe?

2958
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:50,900
We right there.
We don't know.

2959
02:18:50,901 --> 02:18:53,780
He don't have a prenup.
60% he's going to lose.

2960
02:18:54,020 --> 02:18:55,940
Why do you get yourself in these
predicaments?

2961
02:18:55,941 --> 02:19:00,941
You fucking asshole picks up stabbing a
bitch and dropping off in the one seven

2962
02:19:01,870 --> 02:19:05,280
Johnny Depp have a prenup.
I supposedly doesn't.

2963
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:07,870
California is a 60% state.
I don't,

2964
02:19:07,970 --> 02:19:11,090
wait a minute,
please tell me giant deb has a prenup.

2965
02:19:11,790 --> 02:19:14,700
Then you know he's on drugs.
If he didn't,

2966
02:19:14,710 --> 02:19:17,300
didn't have.
We'll find out here.

2967
02:19:17,450 --> 02:19:19,520
If he didn't have a Prenup,
he was on drugs.

2968
02:19:19,790 --> 02:19:22,910
Has there been anything before like I've
never heard of Johnny Depp headed girl

2969
02:19:22,911 --> 02:19:24,120
or no,
no.

2970
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:26,480
His ex wife said it's preposterous.
It's not an Om.

2971
02:19:26,690 --> 02:19:28,290
Doug Stanhope so it's not,
I'm Doug Stan.

2972
02:19:28,290 --> 02:19:30,540
It was actually good friends with them.
He says the guys are like,

2973
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:33,980
the last thing we would do is hit.
Somebody just doesn't have it in them.

2974
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:37,100
It's not that guy.
It's not like an aggressive guy.

2975
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:38,060
Well,
at the other hand,

2976
02:19:38,061 --> 02:19:41,690
something else happened.
His mother died a week before.

2977
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:45,680
Now let's talk about a death.
A death takes a while to sink in,

2978
02:19:45,950 --> 02:19:48,680
but the first 25 days,
my friend,

2979
02:19:48,681 --> 02:19:50,200
you'll know.
Well,

2980
02:19:50,210 --> 02:19:52,490
Stan hope talked about it in the actual
interview.

2981
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:54,200
Oh my God.
Pair did not have

2982
02:19:57,010 --> 02:20:00,950
15 months.
So heard benefits in California law,

2983
02:20:00,951 --> 02:20:05,030
which guarantees her a minimum of one
half of however much they're combined

2984
02:20:05,031 --> 02:20:08,090
worth increased during their 15 months
together.

2985
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:12,110
Huh?
Forbes listed death as a 12th richest

2986
02:20:12,111 --> 02:20:17,111
act or 2015 and net worth of $400
million.

2987
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:22,430
We'll see pirates of the Caribbean,
six seven eight nine oh my God.

2988
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:23,780
During his badge to her.

2989
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:25,710
Oh God.
Go back to her during,

2990
02:20:25,711 --> 02:20:27,140
he's managed to her depth.
God,

2991
02:20:27,141 --> 02:20:31,250
an estimated 61 million to appear in the
$170 million.

2992
02:20:31,251 --> 02:20:35,910
Alice through the looking glass and 40
million to star and black mass where he

2993
02:20:35,911 --> 02:20:38,340
won raves playing Boston gangster,
Whitey Bolger.

2994
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:42,920
Holy fucking shit.
Oh my God.

2995
02:20:42,921 --> 02:20:46,370
You dumb motherfucker.
What are you do when you walk to the

2996
02:20:46,371 --> 02:20:49,550
bank with a $40 million check?
They don't even put you in the regular

2997
02:20:49,551 --> 02:20:51,650
wine with Stan hope so you don't go to a
bank.

2998
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:55,910
It's all done wireless.
But when Stan hope was talking to him,

2999
02:20:56,300 --> 02:21:00,080
he was saying that his mother,
like obviously it troubled him badly

3000
02:21:00,081 --> 02:21:03,080
when he died,
but that this was as bad as that.

3001
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:05,480
This was like looming over him.
He knew that he was going to get

3002
02:21:05,481 --> 02:21:07,250
blackmailed.
He knew that,

3003
02:21:07,251 --> 02:21:08,360
uh,
she was going after him.

3004
02:21:08,361 --> 02:21:11,810
She had some demands and then hit unless
he met him.

3005
02:21:11,870 --> 02:21:13,760
She said she was going to go to the,
the press.

3006
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:16,340
He look man,
he's an older dude.

3007
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:21,270
He's like 52.
She's young and hot and obviously if

3008
02:21:21,590 --> 02:21:23,840
it's,
if doug and Johnny Depp or telling the

3009
02:21:23,841 --> 02:21:26,900
truth,
she's been at plf live and some people

3010
02:21:26,901 --> 02:21:28,070
are really good actress,
man.

3011
02:21:28,071 --> 02:21:29,570
They're really good at pretending they
love you.

3012
02:21:29,630 --> 02:21:31,700
And when you're a guy who's like a
celebrity,

3013
02:21:31,701 --> 02:21:35,450
to the extent of Johnny Depp,
he hasn't been not famous for more than

3014
02:21:35,451 --> 02:21:39,020
30 years.
So through all that time he's had like

3015
02:21:39,021 --> 02:21:42,620
weird interactions with people where
he's not exactly sure where they're

3016
02:21:42,621 --> 02:21:44,300
coming from.
It's never balanced,

3017
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:45,021
you know,
it's always,

3018
02:21:45,021 --> 02:21:47,480
he's Johnny Depp at the end of the day,
he's johnny deaf.

3019
02:21:47,481 --> 02:21:51,380
I'm saying it's a different head pro,
but the fact that he was willing to

3020
02:21:51,381 --> 02:21:55,400
marry her and not sign a prenup is
hilarious.

3021
02:21:55,940 --> 02:21:59,660
That's hilarious.
Called ether the ether Posey.

3022
02:21:59,830 --> 02:22:04,830
No little living in the ether.
The ether gel pussy like that non song.

3023
02:22:07,190 --> 02:22:11,030
Can you imagine if I came to you every
day and told you really?

3024
02:22:11,031 --> 02:22:13,940
In fact there's that and then there's a
pussy.

3025
02:22:13,941 --> 02:22:16,310
You're that Leora hace shifts.
You've seen how hot she,

3026
02:22:16,311 --> 02:22:17,150
oh,
she's beautiful.

3027
02:22:17,151 --> 02:22:19,100
She's stunning.
That's the ether.

3028
02:22:19,130 --> 02:22:20,790
That's the really thorough,
it's ethan,

3029
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:22,070
both of them.
It's ether.

3030
02:22:22,071 --> 02:22:24,890
It's the whole borough.
You live in this fucking bubble.

3031
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:26,070
You

3032
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,370
know.
Everybody wants to come to la.

3033
02:22:28,371 --> 02:22:31,290
That that to be a star.
There's so much that comes with that

3034
02:22:31,291 --> 02:22:33,960
bubble.
She should have just taken a divorce.

3035
02:22:33,961 --> 02:22:36,660
Why should have to slap around to San,
I want to do this anymore.

3036
02:22:37,290 --> 02:22:39,570
That's all she says.
And she's making millions right.

3037
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:43,260
Was only 15 months like so do you think
there's like a lot of hot girls,

3038
02:22:43,261 --> 02:22:48,261
especially in this town who their entire
plan is just to land a rich guy,

3039
02:22:48,890 --> 02:22:50,730
marry him for a year and then just leave
him?

3040
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:52,260
No,
but let me tell you something.

3041
02:22:52,261 --> 02:22:57,261
If that girl was smart and she looked at
her attractiveness as a like a career

3042
02:22:57,660 --> 02:22:59,280
and marrying rich dudes.
Yeah,

3043
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:03,300
there's like a lot of value and it being
broken up with Johnny Depp.

3044
02:23:03,870 --> 02:23:07,740
Like if she breaks up with him and she
makes like fucking look if he's worth

3045
02:23:07,741 --> 02:23:10,260
that much money,
she's getting 10 million,

3046
02:23:10,290 --> 02:23:11,010
right?

3047
02:23:11,010 --> 02:23:12,780
She's getting 10 million at least,
right?

3048
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:13,680
Yeah.
Right.

3049
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:15,660
Okay.
So she gets a 10 million,

3050
02:23:15,870 --> 02:23:19,320
she relaxes and other rich dudes come in
and try to scoop her up.

3051
02:23:19,321 --> 02:23:23,700
Cause it's Johnny Depp's,
former ex wife or current ex wife.

3052
02:23:24,870 --> 02:23:26,180
You have to have a lot of those.
Like they,

3053
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:28,620
they go from celebrity,
the celebrity,

3054
02:23:28,770 --> 02:23:32,280
if she wanted me to play and Kevin,
he went through a nasty bags.

3055
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:35,610
If you want to get dark,
you just go to the next is to go to the

3056
02:23:35,611 --> 02:23:39,000
next Mick Jagger's wife.
Just married fucking somebody who's got

3057
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:42,480
tons of cash and I said,
what's his name?

3058
02:23:42,570 --> 02:23:46,500
I don't know who did,
who did Jerry Hall just married like

3059
02:23:46,501 --> 02:23:51,501
she's 61 or something or 57 she's a
Rupert Murdoch.

3060
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:53,490
Wait a minute.
Jerry Hall reggae.

3061
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:55,510
Rupert.
I thought I'm Rupert Murdoch.

3062
02:23:55,511 --> 02:24:00,360
Kinda hot little Chinese boy
last week when you would hold on a

3063
02:24:00,361 --> 02:24:03,930
second.
Scroll up and it's 59 beautiful family.

3064
02:24:03,930 --> 02:24:07,020
Jerry Hall,
59 posts photo with her and a new

3065
02:24:07,021 --> 02:24:10,890
husband Rupert Murdoch.
85 surrounded by the children on their

3066
02:24:10,890 --> 02:24:12,810
wedding day.
Please expand that picture.

3067
02:24:12,811 --> 02:24:16,680
Much larger.
What kind of dark prostitution are we

3068
02:24:16,681 --> 02:24:19,260
looking at here?
This is dark.

3069
02:24:19,261 --> 02:24:23,130
This is like sorcery.
This is so strange when she can't even

3070
02:24:23,131 --> 02:24:27,630
possibly pretend that he's attractive.
That's like our dad man.

3071
02:24:28,350 --> 02:24:32,550
She was married to Mick Jagger and he
told her the wedding was Nolan boy cause

3072
02:24:32,551 --> 02:24:34,890
they got married on an island.
Shock.

3073
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:39,960
Johnny Louie C for a guy like Rupert
Murdoch.

3074
02:24:39,990 --> 02:24:41,040
That's a prize.
He look,

3075
02:24:41,041 --> 02:24:44,100
he's got a bunch of Chinese kids.
Kids are like half Chinese.

3076
02:24:44,250 --> 02:24:46,350
That's the ex wife.
That's the last one he jettisoned.

3077
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:49,650
She talked too much.
He didn't bow hard enough.

3078
02:24:50,370 --> 02:24:53,860
I still see your face when you bow.
No one.

3079
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:56,870
Let's find out what happened.
Why am I tmz and uh,

3080
02:24:57,270 --> 02:25:00,360
Rupert Murdoch.
But he said he had some hot wife before

3081
02:25:00,361 --> 02:25:01,500
that Jerry Hall.

3082
02:25:01,530 --> 02:25:04,260
Good luck.
But my point was that I really think

3083
02:25:04,261 --> 02:25:07,470
that this lady,
if she just divorced him,

3084
02:25:07,890 --> 02:25:10,860
but I guess she wanted a lot of money.
She might've been greedy.

3085
02:25:10,861 --> 02:25:13,500
She might've been angry at him.
You know,

3086
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:15,480
who knows?
I think it'd be more than 10 because it

3087
02:25:15,481 --> 02:25:19,500
was half of what they made in that year.
And they said he got paid 40 and 60 so

3088
02:25:19,501 --> 02:25:24,070
that's near 50 no,
it's half of what he is his money

3089
02:25:24,071 --> 02:25:25,990
increased by.
Okay,

3090
02:25:25,991 --> 02:25:28,180
so let's pull that up again so we get a
look at it.

3091
02:25:28,181 --> 02:25:31,300
I'm pretty sure that's what it says.
I think it said half of what it like,

3092
02:25:31,301 --> 02:25:34,870
say if he made $20 million one year and
then $30 million with her,

3093
02:25:35,650 --> 02:25:39,040
half of that 10 yeah.
You don't get a half of the fourth

3094
02:25:39,050 --> 02:25:43,030
amendment guarantees her a minimum of
one half of however much they're

3095
02:25:43,031 --> 02:25:43,720
combined.

3096
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:46,510
Worth increased during their 15 months
together.

3097
02:25:47,410 --> 02:25:52,410
So she made $10 more that year and
Johnny made 50 million more.

3098
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:54,160
Yeah,
it's madness,

3099
02:25:54,161 --> 02:25:54,671
man.
I mean,

3100
02:25:54,671 --> 02:25:55,504
she,
uh,

3101
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:58,480
she got him.
There's a lot I've met girls like that

3102
02:25:58,481 --> 02:25:59,740
man there.
Coyotes,

3103
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:00,950
they're strange.
They,

3104
02:26:01,270 --> 02:26:03,830
they stand outside your fence and they
howl and they're,

3105
02:26:03,870 --> 02:26:06,250
they're vicious man.
And there's this girl's like that and

3106
02:26:06,251 --> 02:26:07,270
there's guys like that,
right?

3107
02:26:07,271 --> 02:26:10,620
There's guys that are roofie a girl's
drink and raper.

3108
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:13,390
There's guys that'll a rip a girl's bank
account off.

3109
02:26:13,391 --> 02:26:14,920
There's guys that are creepy fucks,
right?

3110
02:26:14,921 --> 02:26:16,450
Well,
there's girls that are creepy fucks to

3111
02:26:16,630 --> 02:26:18,160
does human beings.
It's suck.

3112
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:22,170
And we have to be aware on both sides.
There's human beings that do devious

3113
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:23,890
shit.
And uh,

3114
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:25,330
just because a,
it's a girl,

3115
02:26:25,331 --> 02:26:27,280
it doesn't mean she's not going to do
stuff like that.

3116
02:26:27,281 --> 02:26:29,770
Believe me,
my friend was killed by a girl.

3117
02:26:29,770 --> 02:26:32,530
It's Phil Hartman was shot and it's
sleep by a woman.

3118
02:26:33,130 --> 02:26:34,030
They,
people are,

3119
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:36,370
people are dark.
They do dark shit.

3120
02:26:36,460 --> 02:26:39,070
Men and women.
And the idea that you're going to go on

3121
02:26:39,071 --> 02:26:40,700
one side or another,
I retweet,

3122
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:44,470
tweeted that article.
Not because I believe 100% that that's

3123
02:26:44,471 --> 02:26:46,870
what happened.
But because Doug's Tan helps my brother.

3124
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:49,690
So if Doug Stan hope put something like
that out there,

3125
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:53,410
I help him promote that.
I help other people read his work does,

3126
02:26:53,411 --> 02:26:56,620
it's not an endorsement,
but it's 100%.

3127
02:26:56,670 --> 02:26:57,503
Um,
I'm,

3128
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:01,300
I will trust doug stand hopes,
opinion on things before I will take

3129
02:27:01,301 --> 02:27:04,750
some actress ladies word on what
happened.

3130
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:09,840
I would to trust at least Doug's opinion
that Johnny was at least saying that he

3131
02:27:11,231 --> 02:27:13,150
was going to get black male.
But who knows.

3132
02:27:13,151 --> 02:27:16,100
He might admit smacking her yesterday.
Didn't want anybody to know.

3133
02:27:16,180 --> 02:27:17,580
I was like,
hm,

3134
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:21,430
business.
I ain't bothering nobody.

3135
02:27:21,431 --> 02:27:23,770
I'm watching the baby.
It's four 30 that day.

3136
02:27:23,771 --> 02:27:24,730
About this week.
No,

3137
02:27:24,790 --> 02:27:28,660
I heard a knock on the door.
I'd never opened my door knocking on my

3138
02:27:28,661 --> 02:27:29,411
door.
You want,

3139
02:27:29,411 --> 02:27:30,930
if you don't call me,
I don't know when the door,

3140
02:27:31,090 --> 02:27:35,500
I just sit there once.
I'm one of those motherfuckers,

3141
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:39,080
unless you call me coming over,
I don't open the door for anybody.

3142
02:27:39,081 --> 02:27:39,720
You can.
And that's,

3143
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:43,080
I've been doing that for 30 years.
Nothing but the baby.

3144
02:27:43,081 --> 02:27:45,470
It was like daddy something.
It's just a dorm like God dammit.

3145
02:27:46,650 --> 02:27:47,250
Okay.

3146
02:27:47,250 --> 02:27:49,050
I opened the door,
three women at my door,

3147
02:27:49,051 --> 02:27:51,120
two of them a cockeyed.
I swear to God,

3148
02:27:51,121 --> 02:27:54,210
I'm not even trying to be funny.
Then from the Cert Church of Latter Day

3149
02:27:54,211 --> 02:27:55,270
saints.
Huh?

3150
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:56,280
Okay.
How are you doing?

3151
02:27:56,281 --> 02:27:56,731
I go,
listen,

3152
02:27:56,731 --> 02:27:59,940
I'm not into this stuff,
but my wife is my wife,

3153
02:27:59,941 --> 02:28:02,100
isn't it?
The more minutes I just said that so I

3154
02:28:02,101 --> 02:28:03,900
could get off the hook.
I'm feeling the baby.

3155
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:07,170
If you want to come back in 30 minutes
ago was I'm really thirsty.

3156
02:28:07,171 --> 02:28:09,420
Can I get a glass of water or a water
bottle?

3157
02:28:12,460 --> 02:28:13,290
Yeah,
man.

3158
02:28:13,290 --> 02:28:15,720
That's how they get you in.
That's a tactic.

3159
02:28:15,750 --> 02:28:17,970
I close the fucking door.
You know me?

3160
02:28:17,971 --> 02:28:19,570
I don't give a fuck.
Hold on one second.

3161
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,070
I close the door.
My wife was

3162
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:24,680
from Tennessee.
She saves those fucking bottles and

3163
02:28:24,681 --> 02:28:26,480
fills them up with water and takes him
to yoga.

3164
02:28:26,481 --> 02:28:28,370
I throw them away.
What are we white trash?

3165
02:28:28,371 --> 02:28:29,900
I throw these things away.
What's that done?

3166
02:28:29,901 --> 02:28:32,150
That done.
My wife saves him and puts them in the

3167
02:28:32,151 --> 02:28:35,690
freezer for headaches and shit.
So I went to get one of those and there

3168
02:28:35,691 --> 02:28:38,510
was no bottles,
so I give her a glass of water.

3169
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:41,240
She takes off.
Now I'm running against the clock.

3170
02:28:41,241 --> 02:28:43,130
These three little more than bitches are
going to come back.

3171
02:28:43,131 --> 02:28:44,620
My wife walks in,
I go,

3172
02:28:44,621 --> 02:28:47,180
let me let me go outside and get it.
You know they stole my pipe.

3173
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:50,980
When they asked me to get the water,
they stole my pot pipe from the balcony.

3174
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,200
Nobody else was on that balcony,
but water got comes on that balcony and

3175
02:28:54,201 --> 02:28:56,350
he sees the pipe.
I don't leave weed up there.

3176
02:28:56,350 --> 02:28:58,520
I'm not that stupid.
I just leave the pipe with the cleaner,

3177
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,860
the pipe,
the fucking,

3178
02:29:00,861 --> 02:29:04,250
my wife was there and warner came.
The lady who takes care of mercy,

3179
02:29:04,330 --> 02:29:07,430
they didn't steal the fucking,
the Mormon stole my pipe.

3180
02:29:07,880 --> 02:29:09,810
Let me tell you something.
I got in that car and a hundred those

3181
02:29:09,811 --> 02:29:11,750
few little cockeyed bitches down all
over.

3182
02:29:11,751 --> 02:29:13,340
I couldn't find them.
They never came back.

3183
02:29:13,910 --> 02:29:17,990
They stole my pot pipe.
Do you think they stole it because they

3184
02:29:17,991 --> 02:29:20,750
were just stealing things or do you
think they stole it because they didn't

3185
02:29:20,751 --> 02:29:24,050
want you to be engaging in such horrible
behavior?

3186
02:29:24,350 --> 02:29:26,870
Smoking marijuana while you're taking
care of your child?

3187
02:29:26,871 --> 02:29:28,550
I wasn't smoking when I was taking care
of the child.

3188
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:30,380
I just always leave it out there.
It's always out.

3189
02:29:30,381 --> 02:29:32,150
That's how I mean.
I mean like you have one,

3190
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:35,360
you have a child but he's still smoking
marijuana and like how dare you?

3191
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:38,060
What are you doing with a pot pipe that
we need to take this from him?

3192
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:40,860
Maybe they took it but they smoked half
ain't cockeyed know

3193
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:46,850
that two bitches ain't cockeyed though.
Much shit that holes in her feet and the

3194
02:29:46,851 --> 02:29:49,640
shoes on.
What religion?

3195
02:29:50,030 --> 02:29:52,490
Since people knocking on doors,
I'm Memorial Day.

3196
02:29:52,491 --> 02:29:55,100
That's a guaranteed slam through the
door to the face.

3197
02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:57,980
Then you have another one that you kept
like he kept coming back.

3198
02:29:58,110 --> 02:30:00,140
I had a job with witness.
I was stringing him along.

3199
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:04,280
I wanted to talk to you.
Caught me at a bad time to come back in

3200
02:30:04,281 --> 02:30:06,680
an hour and see him lurking in front of
my house.

3201
02:30:06,681 --> 02:30:07,940
I'd be dry,
could even go home.

3202
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:10,070
I couldn't even go home.
I had to,

3203
02:30:10,071 --> 02:30:11,870
him was strung out for like four months
though.

3204
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:15,260
Every time he'd come over,
you know what I really want to talk to

3205
02:30:15,261 --> 02:30:15,320
you?

3206
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:17,030
Give me those pamphlets.
I ball in number.

3207
02:30:17,950 --> 02:30:19,940
So some people must be happy that they
come,

3208
02:30:20,110 --> 02:30:21,140
right?
They must get,

3209
02:30:21,141 --> 02:30:22,390
some people are like,
oh,

3210
02:30:22,391 --> 02:30:24,260
well I've been really curious about
this.

3211
02:30:24,261 --> 02:30:25,450
Please come on.
Any revenue,

3212
02:30:25,460 --> 02:30:26,630
invite anybody in,
you know,

3213
02:30:27,110 --> 02:30:29,570
in the hallways.
One time a girl was selling cookies.

3214
02:30:29,850 --> 02:30:32,900
It was pretty hot.
[inaudible] I invited around.

3215
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:36,800
What happened?
Nothing close the deal.

3216
02:30:36,801 --> 02:30:39,560
Back then I was like 21 did you buy the
cookies?

3217
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:41,420
I thanks.
So thinking about cookies,

3218
02:30:41,450 --> 02:30:43,130
I don't remember.
I just remember her being hot.

3219
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:45,920
It's fucking ass.
But y'all didn't smells a lot of cookies

3220
02:30:47,270 --> 02:30:50,150
knocking on people's doors.
Speaking about taxing or what about

3221
02:30:50,151 --> 02:30:55,151
those religions that make you give like
10% church tithing on top of taxes?

3222
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:56,601
Tithing.
Oh,

3223
02:30:56,601 --> 02:30:58,280
thank God.
We had a guy in fear factor,

3224
02:30:58,580 --> 02:31:01,550
they want 1 million bucks.
You don't really win 1 million bucks

3225
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:05,360
because the government takes a big chunk
and most people they take the one time

3226
02:31:05,361 --> 02:31:08,270
payment instead of like the 50 grand a
year for the rest of your life,

3227
02:31:08,271 --> 02:31:09,850
that kind of thing.
Um,

3228
02:31:09,860 --> 02:31:13,040
but this guy before he did the stunt,
started talking in tongues.

3229
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:16,250
He's like standing on us like cliff
side.

3230
02:31:16,251 --> 02:31:21,251
It's like Sha la La la La La
[inaudible].

3231
02:31:21,830 --> 02:31:24,000
They like,
they talk in a made up nonsense

3232
02:31:24,001 --> 02:31:26,310
language,
so like repeats the same sounds over and

3233
02:31:26,311 --> 02:31:28,500
over and over again.
But this talking in tongues,

3234
02:31:28,501 --> 02:31:32,370
he really believed it was like a
religious experience and that God helped

3235
02:31:32,371 --> 02:31:37,020
him win 1 million bucks.
I was going through a box of vhs was

3236
02:31:37,021 --> 02:31:41,430
about a month ago and I put one in and I
caught the beginning of the fear factor,

3237
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:46,230
like one of the second season.
And I watched like 15 minutes of it.

3238
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:51,320
And looking at it now and knowing you,
I don't know how the fuck you did that.

3239
02:31:52,940 --> 02:31:55,980
The show should have been,
how long does it take to Joe Rogan?

3240
02:31:55,981 --> 02:31:58,830
Fucks you up?
Like how long?

3241
02:31:58,900 --> 02:32:01,610
Remember when Tony Soprano,
I used to beat people up like there's

3242
02:32:01,611 --> 02:32:04,260
somebody would say something and he just
draw bottle and go over and start

3243
02:32:04,261 --> 02:32:05,094
kicking it.
Right.

3244
02:32:05,130 --> 02:32:06,840
He'd beat up Georgie like four times.

3245
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:08,420
Hilarious.
He knocked the xy out.

3246
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:11,370
That's what the episode should have been
like half the time.

3247
02:32:11,371 --> 02:32:14,490
Like in the mid sentence,
you just started punching somebody,

3248
02:32:15,510 --> 02:32:17,820
kicking them when they're on the phone.
What do you mean you don't want to eat

3249
02:32:17,821 --> 02:32:20,550
the fucking eggs?
That's the next level of fear factor.

3250
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:25,740
Like go on there like with Chris liebing
as the host and every time he like act

3251
02:32:25,741 --> 02:32:27,240
up,
they just beat the fuck out of here.

3252
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:30,800
Like America's ready for seat.
Fear factor was I had everything else in

3253
02:32:30,801 --> 02:32:32,370
it.
90% of the people were cool.

3254
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:36,240
I think 90% of the time.
Yeah.

3255
02:32:36,690 --> 02:32:38,160
Yeah,
90% it was some goof.

3256
02:32:38,161 --> 02:32:42,120
He can tell you probably,
and I know you would look at him and go,

3257
02:32:42,121 --> 02:32:45,210
oh,
the cameras on as a grown man,

3258
02:32:45,211 --> 02:32:48,750
it's the closest I've ever been to a
street fight or that one that that one

3259
02:32:48,751 --> 02:32:49,710
guy in that persona.

3260
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:52,350
And if that wasn't,
if that wasn't there,

3261
02:32:52,380 --> 02:32:54,840
if that was somewhere else,
instead of like in front of cameras,

3262
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:59,310
I definitely want to strangle them 100%
like it just the whole thing.

3263
02:32:59,311 --> 02:33:02,250
It was like there was eight cameras
around all these people around and I was

3264
02:33:02,251 --> 02:33:03,900
like,
I don't want to commit to hurting this

3265
02:33:03,901 --> 02:33:06,210
guy,
but he's a dangerous fuck.

3266
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:08,940
I'm like,
that guy could totally sucker punch me.

3267
02:33:08,970 --> 02:33:11,730
He just,
he was so amped up and kept coming into

3268
02:33:11,731 --> 02:33:13,380
my face,
kept running towards me.

3269
02:33:13,890 --> 02:33:15,810
I pushed him away,
ran towards me again.

3270
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:17,970
I pushed him away and I was like,
okay,

3271
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:19,110
this is on.
I'm like,

3272
02:33:19,111 --> 02:33:21,080
I'm not gonna.
I'm not going to pete pushing this guy

3273
02:33:21,081 --> 02:33:22,290
way.
I'm not going to take a chance.

3274
02:33:22,291 --> 02:33:25,200
It didn't doing something.
It's like clamped onto them.

3275
02:33:25,980 --> 02:33:29,710
I was thinking of key attended them or
needing them in the face trying to,

3276
02:33:30,270 --> 02:33:33,510
I was trying to think like,
I was like legally the good team would

3277
02:33:33,511 --> 02:33:35,610
be as much smarter move because I have
his head.

3278
02:33:35,610 --> 02:33:37,350
I'm definitely sure I get snap them
down.

3279
02:33:37,351 --> 02:33:40,650
I know he's got no defense and if I hit
him in the face it's probably going to

3280
02:33:40,651 --> 02:33:42,150
be ugly.
You know,

3281
02:33:42,151 --> 02:33:45,060
need someone in the face.
It's fucking devastating.

3282
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:48,270
It's terrible.
It's terrible to do someone's face.

3283
02:33:49,410 --> 02:33:52,920
I got kneed in the face.
Ones broke my nose,

3284
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:57,450
my eyes got black and blue.
I had a headache for three fucking days

3285
02:33:59,190 --> 02:34:02,310
after one knee,
one fucking knees straight on the nose,

3286
02:34:02,311 --> 02:34:05,820
just right on the nose.
That amped up that they want to fucking

3287
02:34:05,821 --> 02:34:08,520
physically fight you.
Like people show amped up.

3288
02:34:08,521 --> 02:34:10,980
They want to actually throw their
fucking limbs at you.

3289
02:34:12,390 --> 02:34:14,640
Boy,
everything's gotten so out the window

3290
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:16,680
and when you're that close screaming at
each other,

3291
02:34:16,681 --> 02:34:18,130
like in each of the guys getting

3292
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:21,340
in your face,
it's so close to like a catastrophic

3293
02:34:21,341 --> 02:34:23,890
injury.
Like anybody that's that nuts that's

3294
02:34:23,891 --> 02:34:27,760
screaming at you inches from your face.
Like all bets are off.

3295
02:34:28,150 --> 02:34:30,850
Like we're on a,
we're on safari rules here.

3296
02:34:30,910 --> 02:34:33,970
Like this is a,
we're in jungled territory.

3297
02:34:33,971 --> 02:34:36,970
This is a very dangerous time.
If it wasn't for a lot of people being

3298
02:34:36,971 --> 02:34:39,640
around particularly like if that happens
and you're alone manage,

3299
02:34:39,650 --> 02:34:43,390
if you're alone in the woods with a guy
who's screaming at you and getting in

3300
02:34:43,391 --> 02:34:46,750
your face like that,
like people die like that all the time.

3301
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:49,750
People have a knife there in that sort
of a situation.

3302
02:34:49,751 --> 02:34:54,070
People stab people out of fear.
Just trying to be the one who doesn't

3303
02:34:54,071 --> 02:34:55,240
get stabbed,
you know,

3304
02:34:55,241 --> 02:34:57,370
you think it's gonna it's eventually
going to get ugly.

3305
02:34:58,200 --> 02:35:00,820
Oof.
I had a situation with Joe Rogan,

3306
02:35:00,821 --> 02:35:04,480
I was so scared,
but it made sense what people say that

3307
02:35:04,481 --> 02:35:08,320
when sometimes it takes to get hit and
the fee it goes away.

3308
02:35:09,290 --> 02:35:13,780
Like my ex wife got some guy with my ex
with her boyfriend to jump me one time

3309
02:35:14,530 --> 02:35:16,660
and they hit the dog with a two by four
and I think,

3310
02:35:16,740 --> 02:35:18,120
oh wow,
that,

3311
02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:20,920
that they hit a,
his name was Hercules'.

3312
02:35:20,921 --> 02:35:23,830
They hit him with a,
with a two by four and when I ran

3313
02:35:23,831 --> 02:35:26,440
downstairs,
the guy hit me with a two by four but he

3314
02:35:26,441 --> 02:35:30,310
didn't really break my ribs.
I just felt something and I could still

3315
02:35:30,311 --> 02:35:33,460
swinging and stuff and I was really
scared and my heart was pumping.

3316
02:35:33,461 --> 02:35:37,150
But after I got my hands on him and the
pain went away,

3317
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:42,040
like I was a different fucking person.
Like his buddy hit me from behind and he

3318
02:35:42,041 --> 02:35:45,400
tripped and he started running once I
took the first guy down and I was scared

3319
02:35:45,401 --> 02:35:47,800
shitless and the one guy was way bigger
than me,

3320
02:35:48,280 --> 02:35:49,350
but I got so pissed off.

3321
02:35:49,350 --> 02:35:54,070
Which one ran the guy with the stick?
The bigger guy or the littler?

3322
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:57,190
The little guy,
he hit me with the stick and I don't

3323
02:35:57,191 --> 02:35:59,950
know what I did.
I didn't know about singles and doubles.

3324
02:35:59,951 --> 02:36:00,820
I don't,
nothing about that.

3325
02:36:00,821 --> 02:36:04,410
I'm not going to want to know about it.
I was just so hot that I tackled him and

3326
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:06,490
I kept punching and punching him,
punching a bunch of,

3327
02:36:07,060 --> 02:36:08,720
and then I got away and I started
kicking him

3328
02:36:10,270 --> 02:36:14,280
and I just started stepping on him.
I started stepping on them dog.

3329
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:17,950
I didn't know what to do.
He was making weird noises and I went

3330
02:36:17,951 --> 02:36:20,650
inside the house and I called the bolder
copper was off duty.

3331
02:36:21,820 --> 02:36:25,530
Who was a cool guy and I was prepared to
go to jail like I had no.

3332
02:36:25,620 --> 02:36:27,730
I knew I had Nigga.
I was still outside on the ground.

3333
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:28,870
Guy was on the ground.

3334
02:36:28,900 --> 02:36:30,970
I fucked him up.
I stepped on his ankle.

3335
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:35,380
I fucked up his foot,
you know all that dirty shit.

3336
02:36:35,381 --> 02:36:38,650
I kicked him before I went to call.
I kicked him like three times in the

3337
02:36:38,651 --> 02:36:42,550
balls just to really keep him down.
Like I fucking kicked him with

3338
02:36:42,551 --> 02:36:45,490
everything I had because listen,
you want to hit me?

3339
02:36:45,491 --> 02:36:47,860
That's one thing.
They hit the fucking dog.

3340
02:36:47,890 --> 02:36:49,330
You ain't going to hit a dog in front of
me.

3341
02:36:50,180 --> 02:36:52,900
Not In your fucking worst situate,
especially in my dog.

3342
02:36:52,901 --> 02:36:55,240
You're not going to have my dog two by
four.

3343
02:36:55,420 --> 02:36:57,210
And the other guy took off,
and I know,

3344
02:36:57,211 --> 02:37:02,211
I forget the guy's name was durfee and
he came and he was 400 pounds durfee

3345
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:06,730
big,
those big fat cops or boulder cop never

3346
02:37:06,731 --> 02:37:10,020
got out of his car.
And I said,

3347
02:37:10,030 --> 02:37:11,860
durfee,
you don't call the cops.

3348
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:13,930
You know,
I protected myself.

3349
02:37:13,990 --> 02:37:16,520
I maybe went a little bit overboard,
you know,

3350
02:37:17,420 --> 02:37:18,950
and turfy goes,
call the cops.

3351
02:37:18,980 --> 02:37:22,090
This is beautiful.
Let's just wrap them up and dropping the

3352
02:37:22,100 --> 02:37:26,450
front of the hospital.
And I was always a pussy.

3353
02:37:26,451 --> 02:37:28,490
I was never scared that night.
Like at all.

3354
02:37:28,491 --> 02:37:31,010
I think once that,
that fucking two by four hit me,

3355
02:37:31,011 --> 02:37:32,570
whatever the fuck hit me in the side.

3356
02:37:33,060 --> 02:37:35,670
Well there's,
the anticipation of violence is almost

3357
02:37:35,671 --> 02:37:39,510
sometimes worse than the violence itself
because the anticipation that fight is

3358
02:37:39,511 --> 02:37:41,700
what everybody's terrified of.
It's like what could happen?

3359
02:37:41,701 --> 02:37:43,440
The unknown.
But once it's happening,

3360
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:46,250
it's not the unknown anymore and it's
the bright.

3361
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:47,310
What's,
what's going on,

3362
02:37:47,580 --> 02:37:49,650
what's going on right now?
Like in,

3363
02:37:49,651 --> 02:37:50,970
um,
competing.

3364
02:37:52,140 --> 02:37:56,550
Once a fight starts,
you don't feel the same fear.

3365
02:37:57,060 --> 02:38:00,930
Like the real fear is the way in
[inaudible] before the fight,

3366
02:38:01,360 --> 02:38:04,110
like the announcements,
walking to the,

3367
02:38:04,260 --> 02:38:06,420
to the ring,
waiting in the locker room,

3368
02:38:06,450 --> 02:38:07,680
all that.
That's the real fear.

3369
02:38:08,010 --> 02:38:09,690
When you're there and you're actually
fighting,

3370
02:38:09,691 --> 02:38:11,260
it's not a fear thing.
It's just a,

3371
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:14,680
you're so zoned into the moment.
You're so reactive.

3372
02:38:15,510 --> 02:38:16,830
It's,
I would imagine that's probably the same

3373
02:38:16,831 --> 02:38:19,530
thing,
but that it's just like the fear of a

3374
02:38:19,531 --> 02:38:22,980
guy coming over and kicking your ass is
way worse than actually being in the

3375
02:38:22,981 --> 02:38:24,650
fight with the guys.
Especially if you know how to handle

3376
02:38:24,651 --> 02:38:26,490
yourself.
It's like now it's,

3377
02:38:26,491 --> 02:38:28,860
I actually control something.
Something's going on here.

3378
02:38:28,861 --> 02:38:31,260
I can react.
I can move around with something that's

3379
02:38:31,261 --> 02:38:34,110
actually going down.
Guys get addicted to that too.

3380
02:38:34,111 --> 02:38:34,920
Boy,

3381
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:37,410
I'm very surprised.
I'm not really,

3382
02:38:37,411 --> 02:38:40,710
really violent.
Like I'm really surprised.

3383
02:38:40,711 --> 02:38:41,040
No,
no,

3384
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:42,750
no,
because they always blame shit on your

3385
02:38:42,751 --> 02:38:45,540
childhood.
They always attach things to your

3386
02:38:45,541 --> 02:38:49,410
childhood and I grew up around one of
the most violent people I haven't met in

3387
02:38:49,411 --> 02:38:52,560
my life.
That's why I know fear like I know what

3388
02:38:52,561 --> 02:38:55,680
fear is to be scared of somebody really
fucking great.

3389
02:38:56,010 --> 02:39:00,390
There's a difference between getting
smacked his Stepdad and his friends.

3390
02:39:00,470 --> 02:39:05,130
The people we hung out with and I'm
surprised I'm not more violent like I

3391
02:39:05,131 --> 02:39:07,230
don't,
I don't shoot animals.

3392
02:39:07,350 --> 02:39:08,190
Well,
you're smart guy.

3393
02:39:08,191 --> 02:39:10,410
You were well,
you would never do that.

3394
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:12,210
You've always been an animal lover man,

3395
02:39:12,930 --> 02:39:15,030
but it's just weird that I didn't come
out with that.

3396
02:39:15,031 --> 02:39:20,031
Like I don't believe in a
stop though.

3397
02:39:21,450 --> 02:39:24,630
When did your violence stop because you
were still smacking people?

3398
02:39:24,780 --> 02:39:26,010
I don't know when,
Nah,

3399
02:39:26,020 --> 02:39:29,880
my violence stopped when I got beat up.
That's when that violin mentality,

3400
02:39:29,881 --> 02:39:33,510
when I realized that there's always
somebody out that's going to fuck you up

3401
02:39:33,570 --> 02:39:36,900
and now it's not like your mom.
It's not a controlled beating.

3402
02:39:36,990 --> 02:39:38,200
It's real.
Somebody could,

3403
02:39:38,460 --> 02:39:41,130
you don't know what makes somebody
punched you three times in the head and

3404
02:39:41,131 --> 02:39:41,670
stop.

3405
02:39:41,670 --> 02:39:44,850
Isn't that interesting how that is like
the answer that everybody always has to

3406
02:39:45,080 --> 02:39:47,190
how many pussies they're out there that
talk so much shit.

3407
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:49,770
Like there's a lot of people running
around the really need to get a fucking

3408
02:39:49,771 --> 02:39:53,250
punch in the face and people go,
that is a terrible way to think about

3409
02:39:53,251 --> 02:39:55,050
that is awful way.
But no,

3410
02:39:55,110 --> 02:39:58,170
there's a humbling too that just like
that lady who was like,

3411
02:39:58,171 --> 02:40:00,930
thank you sir.
When she got fucked up by that elk,

3412
02:40:01,140 --> 02:40:02,940
you need to get,
thank you sir.

3413
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:05,430
You,
you really need that in your life.

3414
02:40:05,490 --> 02:40:08,040
Like people need to get their fucking
ass kicked man.

3415
02:40:08,230 --> 02:40:11,490
They don't.
So they just run around thinking there's

3416
02:40:11,491 --> 02:40:14,340
no consequences to their actions.
The living in his nerfed

3417
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:16,490
environment,
the guy like you,

3418
02:40:16,680 --> 02:40:19,230
you see some dark shit going on and you
know,

3419
02:40:19,470 --> 02:40:22,260
you know there's consequences.
You grew up with consequences,

3420
02:40:22,550 --> 02:40:25,190
heavy,
heavy going to the hospital believes

3421
02:40:25,220 --> 02:40:28,140
that's a consequence.
Unless you're always around drugs and

3422
02:40:28,141 --> 02:40:33,030
drug dealers and drug people and people
that are involved in illegal activity

3423
02:40:33,031 --> 02:40:36,990
where they have to protect their freedom
like drug dealers and being around drug

3424
02:40:36,991 --> 02:40:41,100
dealers like they're always one step
closer to violence than anybody else

3425
02:40:41,101 --> 02:40:43,700
around them.
They're always cause they are living a

3426
02:40:43,770 --> 02:40:47,280
dirty life.
They're living a life of complication

3427
02:40:47,530 --> 02:40:50,250
and and worry.
You always get to worry about someone

3428
02:40:50,251 --> 02:40:52,020
turning you in.
He always got to worry about someone

3429
02:40:52,021 --> 02:40:53,670
getting arrested.
Where'd you get these drugs from?

3430
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:55,890
Oh where does he live?
And then boom,

3431
02:40:56,190 --> 02:40:57,930
you got to worry about people showing up
at your house.

3432
02:40:57,931 --> 02:40:59,730
You got a stash stuff in weird spots.

3433
02:40:59,950 --> 02:41:04,500
You got to always be on edge.
And once you add that drug to the mix,

3434
02:41:04,530 --> 02:41:06,820
like once you're dealing coke.
Okay.

3435
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,880
Like okay,
take for example Pablo,

3436
02:41:08,970 --> 02:41:10,140
Pablo,
then snort cold.

3437
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:13,470
He didn't do drugs but I find the movie
swung on a lot of weed.

3438
02:41:13,471 --> 02:41:15,360
Right.
Did you do any coke?

3439
02:41:15,420 --> 02:41:16,300
No show.
No.

3440
02:41:16,480 --> 02:41:17,313
No.
That's all.

3441
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:18,960
I think you're right.
Once you,

3442
02:41:19,020 --> 02:41:23,940
once you do coke as a dealer or heroin
or prescription pills,

3443
02:41:24,270 --> 02:41:28,380
that puts your judgment somewhere else.
When you do coke and you'd do coke for

3444
02:41:28,381 --> 02:41:31,290
three hours,
the high become something else that you

3445
02:41:31,291 --> 02:41:32,790
for.
It becomes paranoid,

3446
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:34,350
right,
and the more you do it,

3447
02:41:34,351 --> 02:41:37,020
the paranoia,
it's shuts the window.

3448
02:41:37,110 --> 02:41:42,000
That euphoric state goes from three
hours to two hours to one hour to two

3449
02:41:42,001 --> 02:41:43,960
bumps,
like towards the FMA.

3450
02:41:43,980 --> 02:41:45,270
Two bumps.
I was done.

3451
02:41:45,540 --> 02:41:48,000
Paranoid was high on the way home.

3452
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:53,000
If I was driving and I saw a cop car
over there just watching speeders that

3453
02:41:53,101 --> 02:41:55,710
cop cars stayed in my mind and grew like
a weed.

3454
02:41:56,250 --> 02:41:59,790
Why was he there?
Why that makes your trigger finger a lot

3455
02:41:59,791 --> 02:42:03,030
quicker?
That makes so many things a lot quicker.

3456
02:42:03,240 --> 02:42:05,400
Yeah.
I used to call the cops on myself.

3457
02:42:05,430 --> 02:42:08,130
That's not a junk,
that's not a fucking joke.

3458
02:42:08,490 --> 02:42:13,440
That's a joke on stage.
Where I originated from was in 1986 I

3459
02:42:13,441 --> 02:42:17,160
spent the weekend doing the best coconut
world and I kept calling the cops,

3460
02:42:18,270 --> 02:42:20,070
called the cops and they kept coming and
going,

3461
02:42:20,071 --> 02:42:21,450
what?
There's a paragraph in the other room

3462
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:24,520
and the time they go,
can we talk to you

3463
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:26,970
and said,
listen,

3464
02:42:26,970 --> 02:42:30,660
how many lines have you done?
And I haven't stopped him.

3465
02:42:30,670 --> 02:42:32,760
Like we suggest you put away the bag.
Oh,

3466
02:42:32,761 --> 02:42:34,830
that's so fun.
The next Monday I had a walkthrough the

3467
02:42:34,840 --> 02:42:37,050
police station,
like when I have to a good 12 hours

3468
02:42:37,051 --> 02:42:37,320
sleep.

3469
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:41,280
And explained to them I wasn't doing
blow was just the reaction to the orange

3470
02:42:41,281 --> 02:42:41,990
juice.
And they're like,

3471
02:42:41,990 --> 02:42:44,040
listen,
you gotta stop.

3472
02:42:44,970 --> 02:42:49,570
You gotta stop doing powder.
You would call him the cops on yourself.

3473
02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:53,030
That God,
this happens all the time or period

3474
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:55,140
asked me.
So David tape when I was a volunteer

3475
02:42:55,141 --> 02:42:56,610
fireman and aspirin?
No,

3476
02:42:57,270 --> 02:42:58,450
you didn't know about that?
No.

3477
02:42:58,550 --> 02:42:59,610
Okay.
Your uncle joy.

3478
02:43:00,890 --> 02:43:01,560
Okay.
And,

3479
02:43:01,560 --> 02:43:06,560
and snowmass village to be,
you could go to a shitty gym or you go

3480
02:43:06,571 --> 02:43:10,720
to the snow mass club where they have
shaving cream and cute tips kitchen.

3481
02:43:11,140 --> 02:43:13,030
So you know,
Joe Angel in the snowmass club,

3482
02:43:13,031 --> 02:43:16,780
but it was three bills a month in 1982 I
couldn't afford Danny hundred a month.

3483
02:43:16,810 --> 02:43:18,130
Oh my God.
The snowmass club.

3484
02:43:18,550 --> 02:43:21,380
Oh,
the snowmass could even do what I spend

3485
02:43:21,381 --> 02:43:24,700
in those days.
The Aspen Club was what gray boy got

3486
02:43:24,701 --> 02:43:26,590
blown up.
That drug deals making 6 million every

3487
02:43:26,591 --> 02:43:26,980
six weeks.

3488
02:43:26,980 --> 02:43:28,630
They blew them up at the Aspen Club.
Jack,

3489
02:43:29,170 --> 02:43:30,110
right by,
uh,

3490
02:43:30,130 --> 02:43:33,130
blew him up,
boom up with a pipe bomb and then you

3491
02:43:33,131 --> 02:43:35,440
know who his wife May die.
Oh fuck.

3492
02:43:35,441 --> 02:43:37,090
You know,
he held down for six or seven hours.

3493
02:43:37,091 --> 02:43:41,260
He bled out of his ass that year was the
jeep that they put an extra plate under

3494
02:43:41,261 --> 02:43:43,810
the jeep.
He would always give somebody a 20 to

3495
02:43:43,811 --> 02:43:45,140
start his car.
This one night,

3496
02:43:45,141 --> 02:43:48,280
he didn't get my money.
He was 20 days from going on trial.

3497
02:43:48,281 --> 02:43:52,270
They found inside of this house in
garbage cans.

3498
02:43:52,610 --> 02:43:54,850
Well,
he would just go into a restaurant and

3499
02:43:54,851 --> 02:43:55,511
say,
hey joe,

3500
02:43:55,511 --> 02:43:56,310
how are you?
Joe?

3501
02:43:56,310 --> 02:43:59,200
Do me a favor.
He's on a thousand Tommy when it's over,

3502
02:44:01,090 --> 02:44:02,350
wait a second.
Wait on trades.

3503
02:44:02,360 --> 02:44:05,740
$18.
So he would just give them money and

3504
02:44:05,741 --> 02:44:07,900
that way he would never pay when he
would go there and just had a running

3505
02:44:07,901 --> 02:44:08,320
account.

3506
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:11,380
Just had so much cash coming in.
That's actually pretty smart fabrics

3507
02:44:11,390 --> 02:44:13,150
where he would do so when he got blown
up,

3508
02:44:13,151 --> 02:44:14,570
you know who married his wife?
Who?

3509
02:44:14,710 --> 02:44:17,590
James Caan,
James Caan,

3510
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:18,670
Mary Gray,
Bud's wife.

3511
02:44:18,671 --> 02:44:21,730
All those single why he was that get
money.

3512
02:44:21,731 --> 02:44:24,460
When they get blown up,
they fucking all getting remarried.

3513
02:44:24,461 --> 02:44:28,600
You're right.
That's why I'm thinking if she just kept

3514
02:44:28,601 --> 02:44:32,590
her mouth shut and it took some cash,
he'd probably give her many millions.

3515
02:44:32,770 --> 02:44:34,460
Right?
You would think so.

3516
02:44:34,461 --> 02:44:37,000
But how many more millions do you think
she'll get for lists and she'd have to

3517
02:44:37,001 --> 02:44:42,001
imagine some Iranian dude.
So person guy with the fucking Gold

3518
02:44:42,580 --> 02:44:43,750
Bentley was still dog.
They told me,

3519
02:44:43,751 --> 02:44:45,760
listen,
you don't want to pay the 300 you could

3520
02:44:45,761 --> 02:44:48,520
be on a volunteer fireman.
And I go,

3521
02:44:48,521 --> 02:44:51,460
fuck the 300 I'm a fireman.
So for six weeks they put me through a

3522
02:44:51,461 --> 02:44:55,430
training program where you just like put
out dumpsters and give them out of their

3523
02:44:55,431 --> 02:44:58,000
mouth and CPR and you gotta run with a
little bags.

3524
02:44:58,420 --> 02:45:00,490
I'm doing all this shit.
Coked up to the gills.

3525
02:45:00,890 --> 02:45:03,880
I'm selling coke.
I'm going back every week and getting a

3526
02:45:03,881 --> 02:45:07,150
pound of coke is selling it and to give
me my hobby.

3527
02:45:07,151 --> 02:45:10,230
I'm a volunteer fireman,
but have you ever been in Aspen

3528
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:11,290
snowmass?
Yes.

3529
02:45:11,291 --> 02:45:14,320
I've been asked the only fucking fire,
so the one's white people don't know how

3530
02:45:14,321 --> 02:45:16,250
to do a fire in the fireplace.
Debit,

3531
02:45:16,270 --> 02:45:17,980
fire.
They scoop it and they put in the

3532
02:45:17,981 --> 02:45:19,890
garbage.
Then there's a fire blow,

3533
02:45:19,990 --> 02:45:22,930
so I would get coked up at night and
they'd be outside of my house beeping

3534
02:45:23,440 --> 02:45:25,030
behind pine with the bell.
It's like,

3535
02:45:25,031 --> 02:45:26,230
come on out,
there's a fire.

3536
02:45:26,580 --> 02:45:28,000
Come down.
Fuck you.

3537
02:45:28,330 --> 02:45:31,750
I wouldn't come out of the house.
I get so paranoid and then asked me the

3538
02:45:31,750 --> 02:45:32,860
next day.
What happened to you last night,

3539
02:45:32,861 --> 02:45:34,780
Dawg?
I took a sleeping pill.

3540
02:45:34,781 --> 02:45:37,150
I couldn't get up.
This must have happened because every

3541
02:45:37,151 --> 02:45:39,340
time I did show up it was always a
dumpster.

3542
02:45:39,620 --> 02:45:41,710
Right there was on fire.
What am I going to leave the house and

3543
02:45:41,711 --> 02:45:45,010
fight for fucking dumpster.
Eight white people with sticks and the

3544
02:45:45,011 --> 02:45:50,011
helmets were radios
over the fucking got a six third street.

3545
02:45:55,041 --> 02:45:56,920
They get in the mouth,
the mouth of the parrot,

3546
02:45:56,921 --> 02:46:00,970
the shit,
the fucking dumpster.

3547
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:03,940
Did he do any fires and you're like
three fires,

3548
02:46:03,941 --> 02:46:06,850
but they would just dumpster fires.
So after a while I said,

3549
02:46:06,860 --> 02:46:09,920
well,
there's 80 years idiots with things,

3550
02:46:09,921 --> 02:46:11,660
you know,
make them believe that busy,

3551
02:46:11,710 --> 02:46:13,790
forget to leave me at home.
Call me for the big ones.

3552
02:46:14,210 --> 02:46:16,010
That's so fine.
There was never a big one,

3553
02:46:16,070 --> 02:46:19,540
so they fucking fine with me.
That's when they realized I was only in

3554
02:46:19,541 --> 02:46:21,110
it for the membership pass.
They said,

3555
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:25,700
well that spends a weird place because
obviously there's a lot of router really

3556
02:46:25,701 --> 02:46:28,250
wealthy people and they've called it
home for a long time.

3557
02:46:28,250 --> 02:46:31,250
But then there was a lot of hippies and
moved there in the 70s because they just

3558
02:46:31,251 --> 02:46:35,120
wanted to get out of society and they
somehow or another gravitated towards

3559
02:46:35,121 --> 02:46:37,490
aspen.
Like I don't understand how that

3560
02:46:37,491 --> 02:46:38,400
happened.
Well,

3561
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:42,920
what it was about Aspen,
Colorado jails and number one and two in

3562
02:46:42,921 --> 02:46:46,490
the country as far as capacity in the
old days,

3563
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:49,310
10 to 20 years ago,
Boulder County jail was number two

3564
02:46:49,311 --> 02:46:53,380
county jail in the country.
They fed you that gave you clothes.

3565
02:46:53,540 --> 02:46:56,450
That's why they vote democratic.
They trim your toenails,

3566
02:46:57,020 --> 02:46:58,290
they give you rolling paper.
You know,

3567
02:46:58,291 --> 02:47:01,880
in boulder you could still smoke it.
Years ago they gave you rolling papers

3568
02:47:02,180 --> 02:47:04,220
and sick tobacco.
Real.

3569
02:47:04,221 --> 02:47:07,130
No other prison did that.
Everywhere else you got to pay for

3570
02:47:07,131 --> 02:47:10,700
cigarettes and Bogan and Aspen.
They don't even have a kitchen.

3571
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:15,290
Paula France used to cater.
That's why fucking Bundy escape.

3572
02:47:15,980 --> 02:47:19,310
Paula French used to cater and ask him
if you're going to jail,

3573
02:47:19,550 --> 02:47:20,600
you get catered dentists.

3574
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:22,730
They don't have a jail.
They have a county.

3575
02:47:22,731 --> 02:47:25,640
They killer Ted Bundy.
Escape from the aspirin jail.

3576
02:47:25,700 --> 02:47:28,070
Yeah.
Well you opened up a window and jumped

3577
02:47:28,071 --> 02:47:29,510
down.
Whoa.

3578
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:31,550
And he killed the girl in snowmass
village.

3579
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:34,170
Man,
that guy's scary.

3580
02:47:34,180 --> 02:47:37,360
He is a scary motherfucker.
He just escaped from the fucking ass in

3581
02:47:37,361 --> 02:47:38,540
jail.
Jumped out of a window.

3582
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:41,450
Wow.
Well you got to drive.

3583
02:47:41,780 --> 02:47:43,850
Then you get to drive for a little bit
and we're in prison.

3584
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:46,370
Like you went to Wiki spaces and I would
drive,

3585
02:47:46,460 --> 02:47:47,900
you know,
because I was the only one who went to

3586
02:47:47,901 --> 02:47:51,260
driver's license.
So they would let me drive to the places

3587
02:47:51,261 --> 02:47:54,470
where people usually go on the road and
see inmates picking up trash.

3588
02:47:54,490 --> 02:47:56,000
Yeah,
I would bring them lunch,

3589
02:47:56,780 --> 02:47:58,550
but at the same time,
those people,

3590
02:47:58,551 --> 02:47:59,930
they know where they're going the next
day.

3591
02:47:59,931 --> 02:48:01,460
So he called Joe Rogan and go,
Joe,

3592
02:48:01,490 --> 02:48:02,150
what are you doing tomorrow?

3593
02:48:02,150 --> 02:48:05,270
Nothing.
I'm going to be between a Laurel Canyon

3594
02:48:05,271 --> 02:48:06,740
and Compton.
Uh,

3595
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:09,740
cold water.
Do me a favor by that sign that says

3596
02:48:09,741 --> 02:48:13,910
save the apples,
dumped the weed that and so that's what

3597
02:48:13,911 --> 02:48:16,280
you do.
So the invictus come pick it up and

3598
02:48:16,281 --> 02:48:18,680
things and they give me the bag and I
would drive with them.

3599
02:48:18,710 --> 02:48:20,600
The weed would be in the trunk and the
garbage.

3600
02:48:21,820 --> 02:48:24,620
So I believe the garbage on the trucks.
Then the Ebix come back.

3601
02:48:24,621 --> 02:48:28,700
I would mark the bag that they throw the
weeding and they would kick the weed out

3602
02:48:28,701 --> 02:48:33,701
or heroin or the fucking speed and give
me a cut while it's fucking amazing.

3603
02:48:34,700 --> 02:48:36,890
That's how they bring jail.
And he never got caught.

3604
02:48:38,750 --> 02:48:43,610
You know what's crazy thinking about it
now the gods are part of the action.

3605
02:48:43,860 --> 02:48:45,650
They don't want to get caught.
Yeah.

3606
02:48:45,710 --> 02:48:48,350
They'd rather not deal with the stuff.
They were extra income guy.

3607
02:48:48,360 --> 02:48:51,140
They'd rather just relax.
I get nervous bringing in an edible onto

3608
02:48:51,141 --> 02:48:55,150
a plane.
Shit edible on the planet.

3609
02:48:55,270 --> 02:48:59,140
My middle fucking damn doctor.
She joint disease and scared of the

3610
02:48:59,141 --> 02:49:00,470
edibles.
I'm playing the shit.

3611
02:49:01,100 --> 02:49:02,210
What's up baby?
That's it.

3612
02:49:02,390 --> 02:49:03,770
Three hours.
That's it.

3613
02:49:03,830 --> 02:49:04,800
We did it all.
What do we got?

3614
02:49:05,420 --> 02:49:08,010
We got a July 8th you and me are

3615
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:09,960
the car theater.
The MGM.

3616
02:49:10,340 --> 02:49:13,260
I was going to be fun.
UFC 200 yeah.

3617
02:49:13,440 --> 02:49:15,520
Yeah,
UFC 200 that's going to be chaos.

3618
02:49:15,550 --> 02:49:18,510
I think I'm going to go on Thursday for
the fucking thing.

3619
02:49:18,570 --> 02:49:19,920
I'm walking around.
Yeah,

3620
02:49:19,950 --> 02:49:21,090
for the expo.
Yeah.

3621
02:49:21,150 --> 02:49:24,330
Good idea at the nice people,
but you should probably get a set,

3622
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:28,230
see if you can get a set at a the at mgm
club at Brad Gareth's club Thursday

3623
02:49:28,231 --> 02:49:28,951
night.
Yeah,

3624
02:49:28,951 --> 02:49:31,740
but you could do a show that there's an
iphone to fucking set.

3625
02:49:31,950 --> 02:49:33,230
You don't give a fuck.
Oh,

3626
02:49:33,240 --> 02:49:34,190
hang on.
All right.

3627
02:49:34,191 --> 02:49:36,600
That'd be through a seminar or some
learning seminar.

3628
02:49:36,660 --> 02:49:38,460
Yeah,
probably put some salmon has got some

3629
02:49:38,461 --> 02:49:40,350
great seminar.
I think that's part of a package.

3630
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:41,393
Well,
this is a giant,

3631
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:45,510
it's a giant week,
you know of the UFC experience down

3632
02:49:45,511 --> 02:49:48,000
there for UFC 200 so it's great.
I went about five,

3633
02:49:48,001 --> 02:49:48,600
four years ago.

3634
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:50,760
The first year they did it,
you took me and I walked around.

3635
02:49:50,761 --> 02:49:52,230
It was pretty interesting.
Great stuff.

3636
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:53,970
They usually have gotten grappling
tournaments.

3637
02:49:53,971 --> 02:49:55,860
I don't know if they haven't then this
time I'm sure they are.

3638
02:49:56,250 --> 02:50:00,090
They have a lot of Gnocchi,
grappling tournaments to seminars,

3639
02:50:00,091 --> 02:50:03,740
all kinds of shit.
Joe [inaudible] for me is to countdown

3640
02:50:03,790 --> 02:50:08,790
for UFC one 99 and you can watch the
church of what's happening now on

3641
02:50:10,681 --> 02:50:15,681
youtube and Vimeo and Vimeo and a,
you can get it on itunes.

3642
02:50:16,050 --> 02:50:19,500
It's a fucking hilarious.
I suggest you get on that shit and

3643
02:50:19,501 --> 02:50:24,100
subscribe a least at on twitter.
Lee's spell it out.

3644
02:50:24,200 --> 02:50:25,520
L.
E e s y.

3645
02:50:25,530 --> 02:50:25,861
A.
T.

3646
02:50:25,861 --> 02:50:29,040
T and of course,
bad flavor for young Joey Diaz.

3647
02:50:29,430 --> 02:50:32,910
And then Jamie Verna is still Jamie
Vernon when it should be young.

3648
02:50:32,911 --> 02:50:34,170
Jamie,
someone's got it.

3649
02:50:34,230 --> 02:50:36,930
I changed my a fucking piece of shit.
Name to young Jamie.

3650
02:50:37,110 --> 02:50:37,980
Oh,
beautiful.

3651
02:50:38,010 --> 02:50:39,750
That's all you need.
The display name.

3652
02:50:39,990 --> 02:50:41,460
That's all you need,
ladies and gentlemen.

3653
02:50:41,461 --> 02:50:42,540
Good night.
We'll be back tomorrow.

3654
02:50:42,541 --> 02:50:44,340
Sam Harris.
See you soon.

3655
02:50:44,430 --> 02:50:45,263
Bye Bye.

3656
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:51,473
Okay.

3657
02:50:56,950 --> 02:50:59,330
Okay.
Okay.
