1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,780
Two.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,290
That's it.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:08,910
Wow.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,660
A two count from young Jamie.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,940
That's what the buttons
and hit the other one.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,660
Sorry.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,200
Greg re,

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,570
how are you fella?

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,480
Joe Rogan always a
pleasure to be back in a,

10
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,950
what I love is that you kept this studio
the same as the old one because the

11
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,120
vibe was perfect.

12
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,930
I tried to recreate it as
long as we had the desk.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,860
We have the heart,

14
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,870
the heart of the studio.

15
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,310
The rest of it's just stuff.

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,180
And Jamie,

17
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,170
the heart and Jamie,

18
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,350
there's something about,

19
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:39,040
uh,

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,361
I,

21
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:39,650
I've,

22
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,483
I really think

23
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,640
when you use a desk for a long time,

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,170
there's something about desks.

25
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,100
Like if you found out like

26
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,540
hunters Thompson desks was for sale,

27
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,291
he'd be like,

28
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,430
Holy Shit.

29
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:52,690
Fuck.

30
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,290
I want to get my hands on that thing.

31
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,150
Like that's got some ooze.

32
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,060
You know,

33
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,400
he wrote on this,

34
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,570
Holy Shit.

35
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,270
Yeah.

36
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,250
Nice old one of those old like
railway station roll top desks.

37
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,001
Oh,

38
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:05,780
those are the best.

39
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,613
Yeah.

40
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,980
I gotta protect my shit while I'm out.

41
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,620
So nobody reads my chair in
one of my all time favorite

42
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,430
photos of him was him typing in big Sur,

43
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,960
like sitting on like this,

44
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,330
this outside table typing.

45
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,090
I think he's on the edge of a
cliff or something like that.

46
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:25,751
In the background.

47
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:26,650
You see the water?

48
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,350
You know that photo Jamie?

49
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,461
Yeah,

50
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:31,480
that's it right there.

51
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:31,781
Oh,

52
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:32,950
look at that and put the pipe.

53
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,240
That is one of the most iconic
writing photos of all time.

54
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Hunters Thompson with hair
with a typewriter in front
of the water at big Sur

55
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,790
and probably like 1960 [inaudible].

56
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,670
And you know his schedule.

57
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,810
Did you ever read his schedule?

58
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,900
His daily schedule?

59
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,090
Not only did I read it,

60
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,921
he lived,

61
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:56,890
I read it on air and I might've
read it on air with you.

62
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,630
I think you did a self portrait.

63
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,220
Hello?

64
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,800
You took the picture himself by saying,

65
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,023
oh,

66
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,983
so this was,

67
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,610
I mean it's what it's listed as.

68
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,350
This is in big Sur.

69
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,390
That was when he was in the
early stages of his eruption.

70
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,210
That was like right around when
he was writing hell's angels.

71
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:18,730
Probably 61.

72
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,643
Yeah.

73
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,420
That motherfucker was unique.

74
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,050
Yeah.

75
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,370
Did you ever see his documentary?

76
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,830
Now there's a couple of really good ones,

77
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,431
but,

78
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:27,820
um,

79
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,120
the,

80
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,040
the one that was the mainstream one.

81
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,293
What was that?

82
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,373
Yeah,

83
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:32,990
yeah.

84
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,970
It was called Gonzo.

85
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,871
And then there was,

86
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:35,590
um,

87
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,080
there was another one
that was made by BBC.

88
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:39,070
That's really good too.

89
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,500
But yeah,

90
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:44,140
if you could get ahold of
fucking Hemingway's desk.

91
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,353
Wow.

92
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,960
Yeah.

93
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,141
Let me,

94
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:47,974
let me maybe like,

95
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,683
worth too much.

96
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,490
Like you wouldn't want to write on it.

97
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,411
Yeah,

98
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,070
that's true.

99
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,260
Yeah.

100
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,240
It's Hemingway's desk,

101
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,860
like I can't ride on this fucking thing.

102
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,100
Yeah.

103
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,881
It was hunter's desk.

104
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:58,440
I'd tell I'd totally right on it.

105
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,681
Well,

106
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,390
first scrape the excess coke off the top.

107
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,080
Just lick it,

108
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,913
lick it off.

109
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,030
Wipe did jazz.

110
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,030
And from the underside of the table
I'll get the badge sauce off the sides.

111
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,490
What about his typewriter?

112
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,570
How much you think it's typewritten?

113
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,920
Hemingway's house and
hangouts preserved in Havana.

114
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,720
Wow.

115
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,270
So the preserved where he lived and

116
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,160
I wonder if that's
where he killed himself.

117
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,990
I think he was in Cuba
when he killed himself.

118
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,751
Yeah,

119
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,140
man.

120
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,501
His,

121
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,334
um,

122
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,740
his style of writing.

123
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,520
And like that whole
bravado that went with him,

124
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,710
he was a different cat.

125
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,761
It was like,

126
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:43,380
uh,

127
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,213
uh,

128
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,320
you thought of him as like
an aggressive male writer.

129
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,070
Like that's an odd thing.

130
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:51,904
Like Hemingway,

131
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,430
he was a aggressive,

132
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,180
yeah,

133
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,700
it wasn't,

134
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,700
you mean even Stephen King for all was
most horrific depictions of violence and

135
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,030
Gore and terror in his books.

136
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,310
He's not thought of is like I said,

137
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,720
posing physical thing.

138
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,931
Well,

139
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,310
Hemingway was in the war.

140
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:09,790
Yeah.

141
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,530
You know.

142
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,320
Yeah.

143
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,590
He is elderly age.

144
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,860
He was a,

145
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,530
he used to go skiing in the winter in a,

146
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,630
I think it was Switzerland
and they would all,

147
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:22,830
uh,

148
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,260
there was no chairlifts back then.

149
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:29,261
So you would fucking grab your 50 pounds
skis and walk up the side of the Alps,

150
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,730
Jesus cry like a half a day
to take one fucking run.

151
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,290
And he would do that every day.

152
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,660
That must be amazing for you.

153
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,560
Yeah.

154
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,393
God Damn.

155
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,770
Kind of exercise,

156
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,790
like carrying skis uphill in the snow.

157
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,893
Yeah.

158
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,760
That's incredible issue.

159
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:50,391
So I was like,

160
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:51,980
I bet there were jacked.

161
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,200
I put those skiers from the olden days.

162
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,680
Yeah.

163
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,210
They had to be like crazy athletes.

164
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:56,870
Yeah.

165
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,760
And the skis were long back then.

166
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,950
They were like twice as
long as they are now.

167
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,990
When did anybody figure out a ski lift?

168
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,473
I don't know,

169
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,230
but I mean Hemingway would
have been skiing in what?

170
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:11,810
The 1930s and 27

171
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,250
God damn dude.

172
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,030
Yeah.

173
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,730
The Walk Up Hill and ski down.

174
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:17,960
You gotta be dedicated.

175
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:18,661
Good.

176
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:19,620
Are you ever going to get,

177
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
I mean normally you do in a day,

178
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:27,801
maybe you do a dozen runs going up a
couple miles and this one you do one run.

179
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,083
That's it.

180
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:30,451
Yeah.

181
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:31,710
You gotta be dedicated.

182
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,383
Try getting a,

183
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,730
like a lazy person to do that.

184
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:36,840
Lazy people will ski,

185
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,311
you know what I mean?

186
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:41,810
Because you just kind of get into
it and you can get la Di da Di da.

187
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,160
You don't have to like get crazy.

188
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:44,760
Right.

189
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,710
You can just see like I'm not good.

190
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,330
So I ski like a Lazy Person.

191
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:48,750
Yeah.

192
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,421
I just like go,

193
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:50,254
don't fall,

194
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,030
don't fall.

195
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,863
Don't fall.

196
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,703
Don't fall.

197
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,993
Didn't fall.

198
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,100
That's literally me scan
because I've had knee

199
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,410
surgery three nights.

200
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,290
It's crazy.

201
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,011
It's crazy.

202
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,990
How quickly you can fuck
up your body skiing.

203
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:03,830
I am so,

204
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,300
I've skied my whole life.

205
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,640
I've never had an injury and I ski hard.

206
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,080
I hit ain't every fucking jump.

207
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:09,914
I can find

208
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,340
the only one that I know
that like my friend Matt,

209
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,810
he broke his ankle or he broke his ankle
and it happened in the course of like a

210
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,690
just a year.

211
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:18,980
Yeah.

212
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,540
Two friends at school.

213
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,740
Parents at school blew out their ACL.

214
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,921
Yeah.

215
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:28,330
You don't want to do that
when you're 43 you don't.

216
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,661
Right.

217
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:31,810
That's the thing is you get to a certain
age and you the risk reward because

218
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:36,160
injuries take so much longer to heal
and you have so much less time to live.

219
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,031
You just,

220
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,350
the math doesn't work anymore to ski.

221
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,460
You've got to protect
your knees if you can.

222
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,090
Yeah.

223
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,890
Your knees are so God damn important.

224
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:48,700
Whenever people have like hurt
knees and they keep working out,

225
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:49,660
I always cringe.

226
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,480
Yeah.

227
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:50,921
We were like,

228
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:51,131
yeah,

229
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:52,420
I'm not going to get it fixed.

230
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,190
I'm just going to rehab it and like,

231
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:54,430
what do you,

232
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,930
we were talking about rehabbing.

233
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,771
No rehabbing.

234
00:06:56,771 --> 00:07:00,610
You just going to ignore the fact that
you don't have an ACL like rehabbing.

235
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,230
Yeah,

236
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,391
it was,

237
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:01,930
it get it fixed.

238
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,740
He's not going to,

239
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,470
you don't have the
stability in your knees.

240
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:08,080
So there's a lot of guys who blow it out
and they keep exercising and they just

241
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:09,450
chew the inside of their knee.

242
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,673
Yeah.

243
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,311
Yeah.

244
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:12,510
I got something going on in my,

245
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:14,910
the inside of my left knee
for two fucking months.

246
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,530
If I try to squat down,

247
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:20,190
it kills is like a tended
on the inside of the knee.

248
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,600
And uh,

249
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,200
so I'm,

250
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,750
I'm gonna start some physical therapy
this week to try to figure it out,

251
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:25,231
cause I can't,

252
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:28,800
I have an exercise and fucking two
months just because of this one thing.

253
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,431
What,

254
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:30,264
what am I going to do?

255
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,920
But I do more cardio.

256
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't really lift that much.

257
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,880
Have you ever thought about getting like
PRP or Regena keen or anything into it?

258
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,481
Oh,

259
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,314
now what's that?

260
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,430
Well,

261
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,010
PRP is platelet rich plasma.

262
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,250
And will they do is they take your blood
and there's some sort of a process they

263
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:51,130
do and the separate it and then they
take this platelet rich plasma and the

264
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,590
injected into the wounded
area and accelerates healing.

265
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,630
A lot of people have really
good results with that.

266
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,470
Yeah,

267
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,370
and then there's this stuff called Regena
keen that's like platelet rich plasma,

268
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:05,270
but it's apparently the next step up
and what they do is they heat your blood

269
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,280
and by heating it,

270
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,270
it produces some,

271
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,501
for sure.

272
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,191
If you're a doctor,

273
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:13,550
I'm so sorry that I'm butchering
this if you're a scientist,

274
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,970
but I think it produces some sort of
a anti-inflammatory serum because your

275
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,920
blood is reacting to the heat.

276
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,341
Right.

277
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:24,200
Here's the here explains,

278
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,630
I've had this done and
it was really effective.

279
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:27,801
Yeah.

280
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:32,480
Serum removed from the layer and cultured
with glass beads so that a white blood

281
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:37,481
white blood cells per to use r r a p
which is a natural anti-inflammatory glass

282
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,250
beads going into your knee.

283
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,690
I don't understand what that's saying.

284
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,280
It says Cierra was removed from this
layer and cultured with glass beads,

285
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,710
so it's removed after the platelet.

286
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:51,140
Rich Plasma said they made
complete Louis Rich plasma.

287
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,150
They get the serum and then they,

288
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,390
and then they culture it so that the
white blood cells produced this natural

289
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,080
antiinflammatory.

290
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,430
So they trick the white blood cells.

291
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:01,920
I guess maybe for lack of a better word.

292
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,031
Anyway,

293
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:03,864
so this shit,

294
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,970
it's really good for,

295
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,370
uh,

296
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,160
accelerating your recovery
process for an injury.

297
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:12,900
Like a lot of people like
do it like while they,

298
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:13,980
if they get surgery,

299
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,750
they get surgery and then they
have some of this done to,

300
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,950
it accelerates the healing.

301
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,730
Right.

302
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,840
Especially as you get older,

303
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
it just provides you with a,

304
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:21,691
any,

305
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,830
it's actually natural to,

306
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:23,641
you don't have to worry about it,

307
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:28,641
but it provides you with this just an
extra boost of healing for weird neck

308
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,990
injuries and back injuries.

309
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:31,940
People like it for,

310
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,490
it's really good,

311
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,140
really good for lower back injuries.

312
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,910
I'll have it as inflammation,

313
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:36,744
you know?

314
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,450
And so then they,

315
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:37,811
did they,

316
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,501
is it local?

317
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,270
They shoot the blend into the area?

318
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,830
Yeah,

319
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,560
it's hard.

320
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,090
Yeah,

321
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,760
it's freaky.

322
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,550
They put this little needle in you and
then they screw the blood cap in there

323
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,384
and it's like,

324
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,470
now it's yellow.

325
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,700
It's like this yellow senior,

326
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,680
and they squirted into
your back and you're like,

327
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:51,220
whoa.

328
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,030
Damn.

329
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,863
It's weird.

330
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,351
Yeah,

331
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:54,184
it's weird.

332
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,480
I think they would do my cock.

333
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,430
They get it up for you,

334
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,190
but I want your blood in my car,

335
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,610
dude.

336
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,750
I don't know if that's legal.

337
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,150
You can sell all kinds of things.

338
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:07,331
Right,

339
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:09,010
but you can't sell
somebody your own blood.

340
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,000
Is that right?

341
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,930
I don't think so.

342
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,670
Do you think he could sell your own blood?

343
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,450
I mean,

344
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,130
if you to walk a blood bank,

345
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,610
right?

346
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:15,790
Sure.

347
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,950
There's a website you could probably do.

348
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,453
You think so?

349
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:18,791
Oh,

350
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,930
like a dark web and that whole
myth about selling people's cases.

351
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:22,200
Yeah,

352
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,461
sure.

353
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:24,440
William Shatner would be
dealing it if he could.

354
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:24,980
No,

355
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,090
no.

356
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,320
Fuck you.

357
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,190
You could just like,

358
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,660
if someone was selling blood like some,

359
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,280
you know,

360
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,270
there's a lot of those,

361
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,900
uh,

362
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,610
young enterprising young gals on the
internet that smelled like dirty socks.

363
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,643
Oh yeah.

364
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,750
They sell toenail clips and share it.

365
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,663
I'm not kidding.

366
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,343
I'm not kidding.

367
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:44,963
Yeah.

368
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,500
Nothing.

369
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,700
Nothing goes to waste.

370
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,150
No.

371
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,650
Nothing goes full blood for sale.

372
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:50,640
India is illegal.

373
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:51,361
Red Market.

374
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:52,194
What is this Jamie?

375
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,291
Oh,

376
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,124
this is like,

377
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,443
this is a,

378
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,180
they're doing it like medically
though in an alleyway.

379
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,231
Yeah.

380
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,340
But that's how they do it there,

381
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,751
man.

382
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:01,584
That's crazy.

383
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,010
Or is there still a ban on a

384
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,430
Haitian people and gay
people giving blood?

385
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,120
That's a very good
question because they've,

386
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,770
they've gotten so close to stopping HIV,

387
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,203
they can get it like,

388
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,560
correct me if I'm wrong,

389
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,570
they can get it like to you
to the point where you're,

390
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,980
you can't even detect it.

391
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,873
Oh yeah.

392
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,103
Which is incredible.

393
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,600
Yeah.

394
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,980
And then now in the third world,

395
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:27,401
because my,

396
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:27,760
uh,

397
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,780
my friend Peter Current,

398
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,740
he lives in a symbolic way and uh,

399
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,491
no,

400
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:37,330
Mozambique and he used to work for
the health department in La County.

401
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:40,330
He was the guy that was in
charge of AIDS prevention.

402
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,720
And so he got a job working over in
Africa and he said that you can now cure,

403
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:48,311
not cure,

404
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:53,311
but stabilize somebody with HIV
with a pill that's like $60 a month

405
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,180
or something like that.

406
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,840
Wow.

407
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,141
Yeah.

408
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:58,450
They've got the price
way down in Africa now.

409
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,650
That's incredible.

410
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,880
Why is there's so many
cases of HIV in Africa?

411
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,903
Um,

412
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,810
well I think when nutrition is poor but
then there's more cutting and bleeding

413
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,880
because I had heard that a lot of what
you see in terms of like if they're

414
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:20,920
talking about aids in Africa,

415
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,310
that it's very easy to put aids,

416
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,980
like put like that category aids,

417
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,790
um,

418
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,970
that sometimes it's just people with
damaged immune systems from a host of

419
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:35,110
different diseases that it's sometimes
people aren't getting tested.

420
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,660
I was wondered like how many
those people are tested for HIV?

421
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,080
Right,

422
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,471
right.

423
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:39,304
What is,

424
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,810
but the fact that a guy like magic
Johnson has had it since you remember when

425
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,450
you heard Magic Johnson
had I was in a panic.

426
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,780
Yeah.

427
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,340
I felt like it was a Zombie movie.

428
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,480
Like it's happened.

429
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,490
It started and then people
were just going to get it.

430
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:52,630
We're all gonna dive aids.

431
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,680
Everybody what our generation when you
and I were like 21 that's what everybody

432
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:57,040
thought.

433
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,840
Everyone's going to die
from AIDS right now.

434
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,940
Magic Johnson's looks great.

435
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,151
Yeah.

436
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:01,960
He's still alive.

437
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,700
Yeah.

438
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,090
I think of how many people who've died.

439
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,880
We didn't have HIV and we're
worried about this one thing.

440
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,320
I remember he wanted to play in the all
star game and all the players were like,

441
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:11,821
Nah,

442
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:12,654
I'm good.

443
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,550
It's to be a slam dunk contest.

444
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:18,520
But this Jesus Christ.

445
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,490
But what did,

446
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,700
what did fucking Damon Wayans you
used to have a bit about Dennis Rodman

447
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,730
did.

448
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,080
It's about Dennis Rodman spit and then
magic Johnson smile to accelerate his

449
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:35,914
symptoms.

450
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,700
He's like,

451
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,890
if he wanted to try to
get hardcore with them,

452
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,420
I forget.

453
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,510
I hope he did.

454
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,670
Damon's,

455
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,280
I'm a huge Damon Waynes fan,

456
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,090
so I hope I'm not butchering his bit.

457
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,850
Yeah,

458
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,880
but I think that was one.

459
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,450
I know that was his line.

460
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,760
I'll spit in your mouth and
accelerate your symptom.

461
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,723
Dude.

462
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,890
Damian Wayans my opinion is like
one of the most ignored greats.

463
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,041
I agree.

464
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:04,671
100%.

465
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:07,750
I used to open for him sometimes and uh,

466
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,751
twice.

467
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:10,850
I remember him coming
in on a Thursday night.

468
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,380
It was Thursday to Sunday.

469
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:13,790
Faneuil hall comedy connection.

470
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,770
Thursday night he comes
in fucking yellow pads.

471
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,850
He goes up and just regurgitates
a new hour and gets,

472
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,511
okay,

473
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:25,010
laugh for a new hour.

474
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,160
Friday night he comes back tighter,

475
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,930
tighter Sunday night.

476
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,540
It's like he would fucking
destroy with a new hour.

477
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,160
It was so crazy.

478
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,570
He's really good man.

479
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:36,990
Yeah.

480
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,620
He would go,

481
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,620
he would just go up at the comedy store
and literally let whatever thought came

482
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:47,970
into his head and he would take long
sets and he would take that stuff and he

483
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,030
would turn that stuff
into killer closing bits.

484
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,500
Yeah.

485
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,070
But for whatever

486
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,371
reason,

487
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:54,740
I think he just got
into doing sitcoms more.

488
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,340
Right.

489
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,710
It was like,

490
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,543
Nah,

491
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,190
fuck it.

492
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,620
Yeah.

493
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,453
You know?

494
00:14:59,210 --> 00:14:59,661
Yeah.

495
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:00,494
He's uh,

496
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,281
he's,

497
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,690
can I say interesting family man?

498
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:02,811
They,

499
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:03,021
you know,

500
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:05,000
they grew up in the projects in Manhattan,

501
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,610
Dude.

502
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,960
Talent and that family.

503
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,213
Keenan,

504
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,893
Damon,

505
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,070
Marlin,

506
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,780
Sean.

507
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,720
When Jesus Christ.

508
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,583
Yeah.

509
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,910
That's a lot of camps.

510
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:15,860
And,

511
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,920
and isn't Damon's son
doing stand up to now?

512
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,690
Yeah.

513
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,760
Dude at Damen junior.

514
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:21,240
Right.

515
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,300
What a crazy family.

516
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,193
Now.

517
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,800
That's a crazy,

518
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,980
you better be in show business
and that family or you're doomed.

519
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,473
Yeah.

520
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,920
Let me think about that.

521
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:31,754
It's like,

522
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,240
right.

523
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,630
Like,

524
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,550
if you want to compete with your brothers,

525
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,070
Keenan and every wins,

526
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,011

00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:37,641
Kim Wayins,

528
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,180
Sean wins,

529
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,871
bottling winds.

530
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,250
Damien Dante wanes.

531
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,780
Damien Wayne's junior.

532
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,843
That's all of them.

533
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,210
Yeah.

534
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,320
All of them in showbizness.

535
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,483
It's amazing.

536
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,053
Yep.

537
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,910
Good luck in to teen and the had a
fucking great talk show how he yeah,

538
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,883
he was,

539
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,270
he was really good as a talk show host.

540
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,540
Yeah.

541
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,890
He was so talented.

542
00:15:58,891 --> 00:15:59,870
Fucking family man.

543
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,920
But for whatever reason,

544
00:16:01,921 --> 00:16:03,600
Matt Damon did this one,

545
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:08,690
a HBO special and I think he
called it his last stand and uh,

546
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,800
it was really good,

547
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:11,071
man.

548
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,330
It was a really good,

549
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:12,871
and the end of it,

550
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,850
he just throws the
microphone down and says,

551
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:15,000
look,

552
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,450
this is the last time I'm doing stand up.

553
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,200
Oh no shit.

554
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,870
Yeah.

555
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,280
Wow.

556
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,280
It's just like a decided
he was going to do movies.

557
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,043
That's it.

558
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,730
Last stand with a question mark.

559
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,933
Yeah,

560
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,221
he got,

561
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:28,700
um,

562
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,533
you know,

563
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,740
he just got into other stuff,

564
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:31,491
but I'm telling you,

565
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,324
man,

566
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,140
when he was like,

567
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,710
go up and above go that photo though.

568
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,700
The one like that was the stage,

569
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,410
the baret wearing stage.

570
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,340
Yeah.

571
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:40,770
Dude,

572
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,660
I'm telling you,

573
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,400
people forgot.

574
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,660
He's one of the best,

575
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,040
one of the best ever do.

576
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,630
He would murder that
one particular special.

577
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:51,050
It's just murderous.

578
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,970
He had a lot of great sets.

579
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,840
Yep.

580
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,800
On television,

581
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,950
but just like real original too.

582
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:58,761
Like one of those guys,

583
00:16:58,761 --> 00:16:59,900
we would watch them and you go,

584
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:00,531
God damn.

585
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:01,364
Why didn't I think

586
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:01,540
well,

587
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,580
and his voices were so fucking good.

588
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:03,791
You know?

589
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,120
A lot of times people do their
girlfriend voice and it's just,

590
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,500
it just sucks.

591
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,810
It just sounds like the
guy raising his voice.

592
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:15,811
There's no like female intonation to it
or anything and his kids voices and his

593
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:18,670
wife or girlfriend versus
just fucking amazing.

594
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,504
Yeah,

595
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,250
yeah.

596
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:21,580
There.

597
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:21,851
Oh,

598
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:23,560
and then of course it's
like Richard Pryor.

599
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,491
Richard Pryor.

600
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:25,090
So good.

601
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:25,341
I mean,

602
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:27,550
you had so many characters
in living color.

603
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,900
How about handyman?

604
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,010
You could never do that too.

605
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,093
Yeah,

606
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,203
that's right.

607
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,320
You could never do that
to a homeless guy too.

608
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:40,750
That's another show in living color
is another show that people forget.

609
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,280
They forget how good it was.

610
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,510
Yeah,

611
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,051
there he is.

612
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:44,740
There's handyman.

613
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,390
They don't even show
reruns of that show too,

614
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:48,260
that these are frail reruns.

615
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,113
A handyman.

616
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,770
I remember what it was on TV,

617
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,310
man.

618
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,050
No one could stop saying,

619
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:58,381
homie,

620
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,214
don't play that.

621
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,570
Everybody would say that.

622
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,411
Everybody was like,

623
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:01,741
Homie,

624
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:02,610
don't play that.

625
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,320
Like every kid would say that because
homey the clown homie don't play that.

626
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,183
People Forget.

627
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,250
People fucking forgot
about homey the clown.

628
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,680
They should come back.

629
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,693
Netflix.

630
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,170
Please throw some money at
getting it back on the air.

631
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:21,600
They just tried to do it
and it all fell apart.

632
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,440
What happened?

633
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,750
I know they had big money and uh,

634
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,090
I don't know if it was going
to be the original cast.

635
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:28,920
I might've been part of the original cast.

636
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,451
I bet.

637
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:31,680
What happened with Jennifer
Lopez who want to be a fly girl.

638
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:31,951
Yeah,

639
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:32,460
right.

640
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:32,911
She's like,

641
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:33,744
no,

642
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,790
she should jump on that shit.

643
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:36,920
That would be cool.

644
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,950
She jumped back in.

645
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,270
Was a fly girl again.

646
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,511
I mean,

647
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,280
how much time would it
take it not that much time.

648
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,271
She's there.

649
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:42,881
She's there.

650
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:44,370
I mean she probably
could dance in her sleep.

651
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,940
Yup.

652
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,773
Yup.

653
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,953
Damn.

654
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,510
I would love that to be a fire girl.

655
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,360
I don't know who else was a flag
around any other famous ones.

656
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,160
That show was so good.

657
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,690
I remember watching it.

658
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,550
I was playing pool in Yonkers,

659
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:01,730
New York and I looked up at this,

660
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:05,730
this TV set and it was
a Jim Carrey doing the,

661
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,863
the,

662
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,150
the fire marsh or fire fire Marshal Bill.

663
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,691
I was like,

664
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,220
what the fuck is going on?

665
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:11,460
Yeah.

666
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,060
This guy's got a burnt up face.

667
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,590
Rosie Perez was the core your ground
for for the first four seasons.

668
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,220
Wow.

669
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,400
No,

670
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,141
Rosie Perez,

671
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:22,710
a giant boxing fan.

672
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,700
Oh yeah.

673
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,660
Giant boxing,

674
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,170
Huh?

675
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,800
Yeah.

676
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,431
Like people,

677
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,290
like she's like a boxing expert.

678
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,340
Not like an expert.

679
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:30,240
Like she could train fighters,

680
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:33,720
but like people asked her
questions about boxing.

681
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,130
She's a real enthusiast.

682
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:36,570
That's a better term instead of an expert.

683
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,680
I mean maybe she is an expert,

684
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:38,514
I don't know.

685
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,450
But uh,

686
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,440
she is always around box.

687
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,031
I think it's so,

688
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:43,510
because you always think of her as having,

689
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:46,200
that's the cute voice and you know,

690
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:49,950
in all of those comedies and to see her
at like boxing matches a really right

691
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:50,260
into it.

692
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,660
It's like,

693
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,390
yeah.

694
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,223
Yeah.

695
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,433
Cool.

696
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,070
Um,

697
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,871
and Jim Carrey,

698
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:55,111
I mean,

699
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,070
Jesus Christ,

700
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:56,290
he would,

701
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,971
he would do the,

702
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:57,570
uh,

703
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,400
the convenience store,

704
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,840
a security guy,

705
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,660
and he was just so big and so big,

706
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,950
so different than like,

707
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:05,191
I mean,

708
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:08,220
you have to go back to Jerry Lewis to
think about somebody doing physical comedy

709
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:09,030
that well,

710
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,211
yeah,

711
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:09,810
he was,

712
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,800
he was a 10,

713
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,100
like his energy and everything was
like the fucking ace Ventura movie.

714
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,040
Yeah.

715
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,080
Like that move was just all performance.

716
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:19,230
Yeah.

717
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,170
Like what does this one,

718
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,350
what is this Vera de Milo to
that fucking show was so good.

719
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:25,980
Yeah.

720
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,880
People forgot.

721
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,743
Yeah.

722
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,201
Yeah.

723
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:29,160
There's fire Marshall Bill.

724
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,060
So I was in,

725
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,520
I was in this pool hall and I looked up,

726
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:32,821
I'm like,

727
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:34,470
what the fuck is that?

728
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,131
And they're like,

729
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:36,660
that's fire Marshall Bill.

730
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,190
That's,

731
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,011
that's what it is.

732
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:38,731
He came in like that.

733
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:38,971
I was like,

734
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,210
that is the creepy shit I've ever seen.

735
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:43,500
I can't believe they have
a character like this.

736
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,780
It was so over the top.

737
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,070
Do you think Jim Carrey or maybe

738
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,540
uh,

739
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,540
the one of the Wayans brothers has bought
up the rights for reruns because they

740
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,740
don't want that

741
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,043
blowback?

742
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,970
Yeah,

743
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,511
no,

744
00:20:57,511 --> 00:20:58,590
it's a different era.

745
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,630
You have to accept as a different era.

746
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,513
You just,

747
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,503
people were different.

748
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,960
Look,

749
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,000
people are changing and
it's really interesting,

750
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,630
obvious sign that things
that were super acceptable.

751
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:11,760
And when was this in living color?

752
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,100
I want to say it was like 92,

753
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:15,090
90 to 94.

754
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,650
9,094 yeah.

755
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,680
So that the way you could do certain
bits and what you'd get away with and put

756
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:23,851
on television,

757
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:24,684
it was just different.

758
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,240
So I think that's one of the,

759
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,270
like probably one of the least understood
things that's happening with us with

760
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:37,770
social media is as the rapid
evolution of what's acceptable,

761
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:38,970
not acceptable anymore.

762
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,070
And it's changing very quickly.

763
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,600
In terms of subjects,

764
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,270
in terms of the way you approach things,

765
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:49,350
in terms of like obvious
bigotry or obvious bias,

766
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,300
it's like it's all
getting very highlighted.

767
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:52,331
Well,

768
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:52,420
the,

769
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,420
I think the big question is whether or
not you see an artist as somebody who's

770
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,260
taking their inner vision and putting
it out and you go for the ride or you

771
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:03,094
don't.

772
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,150
Or is it,

773
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,920
are we supposed to be representing
society in our standup?

774
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,910
Or is it all supposed to be fair,

775
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,860
balanced representations of
different ethnic groups and genders?

776
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:15,540
You know,

777
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:15,770
and,

778
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,603
and it's like,

779
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,060
when did it all have to
become a morality tale?

780
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,690
When did every depiction of
every race have to be fair?

781
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,823
You know,

782
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,870
can't you have an asshole who's black?

783
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:31,000
Can't you have a killer who's gay
without it becoming a depiction of that

784
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:31,834
entire,

785
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,733
you know,

786
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,603
subgroup?

787
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,261
Yeah.

788
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:35,094
It's like,

789
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,510
if what our real problem is
that prejudice does exist,

790
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,800
so when it does exist,

791
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:43,020
you kind of look for it
and things and you say,

792
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:43,650
hey,

793
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,780
this has the characteristics of prejudice.

794
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,980
I see this here.

795
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:49,650
I see what you're doing here
that I think this is prejudice.

796
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,170
We say,

797
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:50,311
no,

798
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:50,371
no,

799
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:50,581
no.

800
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:52,710
This is making fun of Puerto Rican men.

801
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,360
This is not prejudice.

802
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,720
Yeah.

803
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,420
This is,

804
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,070
uh,

805
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,990
an account of real occurrences
that I've turned into humor.

806
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,410
Yeah.

807
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:01,681
The,

808
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,890
the flamboyant masculinity
of Puerto Rican men.

809
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,000
I mean,

810
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,110
like in New York,

811
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,630
like that's if you,

812
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:13,980
if you thought of a type
of a Latino sort of,

813
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:14,370
uh,

814
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,870
the bravado,

815
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,321
you know,

816
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:17,340
the music,

817
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:18,061
the food,

818
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,270
everything spicy.

819
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,330
Like if you can't make fun of that.

820
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:21,511
Yeah.

821
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:21,990
Yeah.

822
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,560
Come on.

823
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,080
I Know Collin Quinn does a
whole thing about how racist,

824
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:25,380
right?

825
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,330
Puerto Ricans who never inside or outside,

826
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:28,164
they're always both.

827
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,070
Like there's always a window open.

828
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:34,080
People on the inside and outside of
dogging the car door is always open.

829
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,130
They're half in the car.

830
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:36,150
They're half right.

831
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,350
This isn't racist.

832
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,640
This is observation.

833
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,060
Can I take an option rate?

834
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,790
Can I tell you that yesterday,

835
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:45,890
about twice a week I go to this Japanese
market in Mar Vista and they've got all

836
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:46,220
different

837
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,761
kinds of,

838
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:47,420
uh,

839
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,721
you know,

840
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:52,721
you can get Sushi tempura whatever
the parking lot for this place,

841
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:58,541
because 80% of the people that are
Asian film it and put it on a fucking

842
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,601
television channel.

843
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:00,320
It is,

844
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,550
it is just people.

845
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,540
Why don't you produce it?

846
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,010
I could announce it like I was Adj Foy.

847
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,810
You're an Emmy award winning writer.

848
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,580
You could actually do something like that.

849
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,050
You're like a legit writer.

850
00:24:11,051 --> 00:24:12,310
You could totally produce that.

851
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,950
Can you imagine announced it like Nascar.

852
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,090
It's just people like not getting how
to get out of a parking spot with us

853
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:24,091
taking like eight k turns and people on
the wrong side of the street and backing

854
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:27,100
up without looking over the shoulders
and they're all Asian and it's fucking

855
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:27,910
hilarious.

856
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,600
I didn't,

857
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,830
I didn't tell them to do it.

858
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,690
I didn't say it was wrong,

859
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,280
but it's happening.

860
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,863
Yeah.

861
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,540
Dave explained it,

862
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,290
um,

863
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,210
why it's a stereotype,

864
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,150
but why also why Asian people would,

865
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:42,780
um,

866
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,750
be more likely to walk straight.

867
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,560
And,

868
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:46,920
you know,

869
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,521
like if you,

870
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:50,670
if you go to China or if
you go to any of those,

871
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:50,850
uh,

872
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,683
Asian company,

873
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:51,930
uh,

874
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,763
Asian countries,

875
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,900
when people walk straight at each other,

876
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,570
they all kind of have this
way of touching and they just,

877
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,590
there's so many people,

878
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:00,270
they're just grinding past each other.

879
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,080
Yeah.

880
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,411
Yeah.

881
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:04,020
So when you're in China in particular,

882
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,590
people are like indifferent
to bumping into you.

883
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,180
It doesn't bother them at all.

884
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,350
They just bump into you.

885
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,540
Like if you're in the aisle of a plane,

886
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,860
they just bump into you.

887
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,310
Yeah.

888
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,861
Like they'll do it.

889
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:16,570
The little kids just
walk right through it.

890
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,070
Right.

891
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,491
It's just,

892
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:18,301
that's how they did.

893
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:19,110
It's not rude.

894
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,730
Just like how's culturally different?

895
00:25:20,731 --> 00:25:20,930
Yes.

896
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,763
It's more crowded.

897
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,370
Why can't you comment on that?

898
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,780
Or couldn't you comment on that?

899
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:25,614
If that's a real thing,

900
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,610
because that is a real thing.

901
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:27,450
They do do that.

902
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:27,930
Yeah.

903
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,610
They also do a lot of great stuff.

904
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:29,761
I mean,

905
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:30,780
it's not like you're not,

906
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,050
it's a negative judgment on the
entire race because they have this one

907
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:34,884
characteristic,

908
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,920
but to ignore that one
characteristic seems crazy.

909
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,610
Yeah.

910
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:38,881
It's like,

911
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:41,190
why can't I talk about something like,

912
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:41,760
I'm not,

913
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,590
it's not mean I'm not a bad person to
talk about a real thing that you see and I

914
00:25:46,591 --> 00:25:47,040
see.

915
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,873
Yeah.

916
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,310
I get booed on stage sometimes.

917
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:53,410
Now that never used to happen for what?

918
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:54,244
What'd you say?

919
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,870
I did a joke.

920
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,070
We don't have to say the joke,

921
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:58,260
but just say it.

922
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,670
I don't care because I
don't think it's offensive,

923
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,100
but there's,

924
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,520
but this person did and it was uh,

925
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,190
you know,

926
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,023
I go,

927
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:05,680
oh it's girl,

928
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,950
it's girl scout cookie season.

929
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,210
Those little whores are out there
popping up their tables wherever you are

930
00:26:10,211 --> 00:26:11,560
selling those stale,

931
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,850
shitty overprice.

932
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,580
But you buy them cause
it makes you feel good.

933
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:16,630
Like you're a good person,

934
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,290
you know,

935
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,930
and then you walked through the parking
lot in some black kid comes up with a

936
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:21,280
box of snickers gone,

937
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,050
hey we use support my basketball team.

938
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:23,620
And you're like,

939
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,570
that's a fucking scamps

940
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,480
guy goes,

941
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,313
Ooh,

942
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,150
through not all skin.

943
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,230
I'm like,

944
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,420
that's not what we're saying.

945
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,313
Stupid.

946
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,253
Yeah.

947
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,790
You're doing a character.

948
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,690
I'm commenting on a very real thing my
entire life I have bought girl scout

949
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,220
cookies and I have

950
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,980
not always bought that fucking
snickers bar in the subway or the,

951
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,170
sometimes I do.

952
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,481
Yeah,

953
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:52,980
the girl scout cookies.

954
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,290
It's universally accepted.

955
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,850
Yeah.

956
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,683
Right.

957
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,370
But they only have like the ones
that are like are the ones that,

958
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,020
it's like a coconut one with someone.

959
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,170
I like chocolate on it.

960
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,070
You that one.

961
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,240
This one's pretty Carmel.

962
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,861
One's pretty,

963
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:07,800
that was a legit,

964
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,970
but they've got one called

965
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,120
the muff,

966
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,110
but then there's also like there's steps
away from girl scout cookies where,

967
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:16,231
well,

968
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:17,490
you don't have to participate.

969
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,980
Like when kids come over
with chocolate or candy.

970
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,550
Thanks.

971
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:21,930
Good.

972
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,711
I don't eat that stuff.

973
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:24,390
Like you kind of have to
buy girl scout cookies.

974
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:25,430
You want to support the girls camp,

975
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,760
but you know it's such a scam.

976
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:28,770
All that money goes to the manufacturer.

977
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:32,370
Apparently the girl scouts make
like 20% of the the cookie money.

978
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:32,820
Really?

979
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,001
Yeah.

980
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:33,834
They're getting fucked.

981
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,430
A girl scouts again.

982
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,470
Fuck course someone came in.

983
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,180
Some ruthless man.

984
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:40,630
Probably the MOA.

985
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,360
Moa is,

986
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,860
that's exactly what it is.

987
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:44,790
Those are the shit.

988
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,450
Yeah.

989
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,200
With milk.

990
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,760
With a cold glass of milk.

991
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,860
Duncombe Yup.

992
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,630
Fuck yeah.

993
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:52,710
It almost tastes like neat.

994
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,900
Then look at it.

995
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,821
It's chocolate.

996
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:56,411
Eat Coconut.

997
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:57,244
He goodness.

998
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,510
Why do they have to be so bad for you?

999
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,823
When I was,

1000
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,410
when I was working on a TV show,

1001
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,520
one of the producers had a daughter who
was in the girl scouts and I guess you

1002
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:12,480
win contest if you sell over if
you sell the most cookie boxes.

1003
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:18,000
So when the audience would stream out
after the show is a daily Shell and the

1004
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:20,040
audience was stream out and uh,

1005
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,660
the girl had a table set up to sell our
cookies and she was selling a hundred

1006
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:29,661
boxes a day and for every day she was
there fucking won that contest dam.

1007
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,240
And they would have the audience,

1008
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:38,460
a warm up guy like plug
it during the shell,

1009
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:39,241
like after the shit,

1010
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:42,450
like a comedian selling his cds after
the show you go buy some girl scout

1011
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:45,150
cookies on the way out and all these,

1012
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,570
these fat people from the
Midwest or like Kooky,

1013
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,420
like Marie Callender's died.

1014
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,750
Just have pie.

1015
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,530
Just Pie.

1016
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,363
[inaudible] Pie.

1017
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,013
Yup.

1018
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,370
Not even good pie.

1019
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,911
It's good,

1020
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:01,890
but it's not great
considering it's all they do.

1021
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,120
I should have eaten there.

1022
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,410
I don't think I've ever eaten there.

1023
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,370
Maybe I eat it one,

1024
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,310
I don't think I had their Pi.

1025
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,840
That seems a weird thing.

1026
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,370
Like come selling pies.

1027
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:11,800
Yeah,

1028
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,090
Blake,

1029
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:12,923
good luck.

1030
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,390
It looks on pies.

1031
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,253
You're going to go broke,

1032
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,920
but they're everywhere.

1033
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:20,860
We know you have an element.

1034
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,580
We know you have flour
branch out a little bit.

1035
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,130
Like who the fuck gets
famous as selling pies?

1036
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,860
Like how genius is that company?

1037
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,710
Admins member Edmonds intimates,

1038
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,211
but then they,

1039
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:32,730
they,

1040
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,480
they broke out.

1041
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,070
They started doing cakes and cookies too,

1042
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:35,490
but they all,

1043
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,200
they did just pies for a long time.

1044
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,591
Dude.

1045
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:39,420
They used to have this,

1046
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,160
this Ah God,

1047
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,850
this pastry.

1048
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,010
I'm trying to think of
what the hell it was,

1049
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,210
but it had like,

1050
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,750
like hard sugar on the outside of it and
then it had some sort of creamy sweet

1051
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:54,370
stuff on the inside of it.

1052
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,840
Holy Shit.

1053
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:56,370
Was it good?

1054
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,203
Yeah.

1055
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,131
God Damn it.

1056
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,080
We lived off that shit.

1057
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:00,130
We ain't meds every night.

1058
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,964
They had like,

1059
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,470
they had one that had like a chocolate
filling in it and it was powdered outsize

1060
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,353
filled

1061
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,080
mine.

1062
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,760
They went out of business
and then they say,

1063
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:09,971
oh,

1064
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:11,290
that was the cheese one.

1065
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,580
That was a good one too.

1066
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:14,170
I remember the cheese filled crumb,

1067
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,340
those,

1068
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,710
they had some ridiculously delicious shit.

1069
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,290
Yeah.

1070
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,330
What are the other big ones?

1071
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,291
You know,

1072
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,200
I decided to fight in a
tournament once because a,

1073
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:26,170
I had a crazy sugar
high from Dunkin donuts.

1074
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,860
I'd hurt myself or hurt,

1075
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,520
um,

1076
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,970
something in my crotch and I couldn't
work out for like a week that pulled some

1077
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:36,460
sort of a muscle and there was a
big tournament that was coming up.

1078
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,193
And uh,

1079
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:38,951
all the,

1080
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:40,060
the guys that are competed with,

1081
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:40,811
we're going to this tournament.

1082
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:43,210
It was like I had just
fought like a week before.

1083
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:43,451
I was like,

1084
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:44,410
I don't think I can do it.

1085
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:44,681
I'm like,

1086
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:45,760
this doesn't feel right.

1087
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,260
I'm just gonna take the whole week off.

1088
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,270
So I decided I'm just going to take off,

1089
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:50,170
let this thing heal.

1090
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:50,951
And so,

1091
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:51,180
uh,

1092
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:56,050
delivering my newspapers and
I go to Dunkin donuts and
I got this powdered lemon

1093
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:57,400
filled donut.

1094
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,260
I got one of those and I got a,

1095
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:01,020
a Boston cream donut,

1096
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,433
one of those.

1097
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,010
And I got a,

1098
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,820
I ate like three donuts
cause I'd be exhausted,

1099
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,810
tired,

1100
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,800
drinking coffee,

1101
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,750
delivering fucking
newspapers for three hours.

1102
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,700
And I was so jacked on sugar
and coffee that I said,

1103
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,271
fuck it.

1104
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:17,104
I want to fight.

1105
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,300
And so I drove.

1106
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,370
I drove into town like right
before everybody was leaving.

1107
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:23,681
They were like,

1108
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,430
why are you here?

1109
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:24,840
I said,

1110
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
I'm going to fight anyway,

1111
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:26,674
man.

1112
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,050
Like Beavis and Butthead,

1113
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,980
I won.

1114
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,820
I won the tournament.

1115
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,010
It was a giant tournament for me.

1116
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:33,844
It was big.

1117
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,170
It was the American open.

1118
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,004
It was like a big,

1119
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,023
it's a big deal.

1120
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:37,840
Wow.

1121
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,620
Yeah,

1122
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,460
it wasn't going to do it.

1123
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,670
I got jacked up on sugar
and made a rash decision.

1124
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,530
I can see you winning the first match,

1125
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:44,930
but then,

1126
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,520
but then,

1127
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,630
then you crash.

1128
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,131
No,

1129
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:48,010
you got to keep fighting.

1130
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,431
No,

1131
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:49,181
it didn't.

1132
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:50,650
It worked out somehow or another,

1133
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:52,150
I guess I ate when I got there too,

1134
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,160
but also the week off,

1135
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:54,821
I'd never done that.

1136
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:55,750
Like taking a week off.

1137
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,810
Sometimes when you do
something like that where you,

1138
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:00,970
if you exercise too much,

1139
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,680
you're really always in a
state of recovery and your
body doesn't get a chance

1140
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:07,600
to like fully charged back up again.

1141
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,420
So at the time I was probably 19
and I was going hard like every day,

1142
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,191
every day that I could,

1143
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,870
so I'd never really taken a week off.

1144
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,790
So taking a week off and just be like,

1145
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,240
wow,

1146
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,810
this is,

1147
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,760
I did take a week off when
I started getting laid.

1148
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,330
Yeah.

1149
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,700
That is one thing that happened
the first time he got late.

1150
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,180
Yeah.

1151
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,620
When I first started getting laid,

1152
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,250
I took a long time off and at yelled at.

1153
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,233
Yeah.

1154
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,280
Like I yelled and I
wasn't doing any training.

1155
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,020
I came back all tanned and shit.

1156
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,890
All he did was fuck.

1157
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,070
That's a workout at

1158
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,581
that age.

1159
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,414
That's a workout.

1160
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,330
You know that those weren't
20 minutes sessions.

1161
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:44,460
Well,

1162
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,020
it's weird how your,

1163
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:49,230
your body changes from no,

1164
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,430
no urge to fuck to like
fucking is your whole life.

1165
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,320
Like when you're 18 years old,

1166
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,390
it's your whole life.

1167
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,840
Like you found the craziest drug ever.

1168
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,200
Yeah.

1169
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,011
And like two years ago,

1170
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:02,910
it wasn't in your life.

1171
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,200
Yeah.

1172
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,850
Then all of a sudden it's in your life
and then all of a sudden you're having

1173
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:06,750
sex and you're like,

1174
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,360
I can't believe that.

1175
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:08,830
Yeah.

1176
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,000
And you can't believe that,

1177
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:14,140
that women are letting you do it because
for years they were stopping you and

1178
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:15,520
now they're initiating.

1179
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,360
Yes.

1180
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:16,711
Can't leave.

1181
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:17,221
They want it.

1182
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:18,510
You actually want me to fuck you.

1183
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:18,870
Yeah.

1184
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,740
This is what you like.

1185
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,910
Yeah.

1186
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,720
Okay.

1187
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,100
Yeah.

1188
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,980
It feels wrong.

1189
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,020
But if you insist it
feels wrong that you like,

1190
00:33:26,021 --> 00:33:29,760
it is a weird mentality that we
think it's wrong that they like,

1191
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,970
is that a Christian thing?

1192
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,040
So crazy.

1193
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,010
I think it has to do with,

1194
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,690
um,

1195
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:38,280
initially if you read sex at dawn a,

1196
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:41,020
he's got a really interesting series of,

1197
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:41,854
uh,

1198
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,470
thoughts on the origins of
sexual behavior and why,

1199
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,310
why we all sort of have
adopted this one thing now.

1200
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,480
What do you think?

1201
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,313
Let me ask you,

1202
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,640
I think it's Christian.

1203
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,670
I know it is for me.

1204
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,181
You know,

1205
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:55,661
I got a lot of,

1206
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:55,840
hey,

1207
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,461
I got a lot of shame.

1208
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:56,630
Yeah.

1209
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,463
That all that stuff.

1210
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,710
I think it has to do with
people getting pregnant too.

1211
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,993
Yeah.

1212
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,590
I think it had to do with,

1213
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:05,930
it was too easy for a
girl to get pregnant.

1214
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:09,920
And if a girl got pregnant back when
people were fucking just barely making it

1215
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:10,820
out of the caves.

1216
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,960
Right.

1217
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,430
It was either really good cause he had
food or it was a real burden because you

1218
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,640
had to take care of this baby now.

1219
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,011
Now you're,

1220
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:19,760
you're not going to be
gathering food for us.

1221
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:20,270
Right.

1222
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,040
I think there was a lot of that going on.

1223
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:25,610
So if you were going to be with a
person and you decided to make babies,

1224
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,900
you got to be sure that this person
is going to be there and take care of

1225
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,830
everything and you're,

1226
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:31,850
you're all set up.

1227
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,390
Yeah.

1228
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,030
So you can't just be banging a bunch of
guys on the side and having kids with

1229
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:35,331
everybody.

1230
00:34:35,331 --> 00:34:36,470
Then who's going to raise your kids?

1231
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,353
Right.

1232
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,010
This guy's going to come over and talk
to his kid and he's going to come over

1233
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:40,844
and talk to his kid.

1234
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,500
Yeah.

1235
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,333
That'd becomes a problem.

1236
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,030
Right.

1237
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,980
I think that's,

1238
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,070
and the amazing thing is that
having kids back then for guys,

1239
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:51,490
the reason why guys stuck around was,

1240
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:51,761
you know,

1241
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:54,490
we have 401k is an IRA accounts back then.

1242
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:55,300
It's like when you,

1243
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,890
when you couldn't gather anymore,

1244
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,130
you are at the mercy of charity
and so if you had a lot of kids,

1245
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,710
you had a chance of being able to
actually live into your old age.

1246
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,440
Yeah,

1247
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,630
yeah.

1248
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,500
They would take care of you.

1249
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,823
Yeah.

1250
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,800
It's also interesting too,

1251
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:12,480
because there was so much infant
mortality back then that there was a,

1252
00:35:12,481 --> 00:35:16,560
a lot of places where there's real good
evidence that they had fertility cults,

1253
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,390
like they were trying to figure out
ways to get pregnant more and easier,

1254
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,920
and they're just trying
to have a bunch of kids.

1255
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:23,041
Yeah.

1256
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:23,874
Because kids were,

1257
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:24,900
you know,

1258
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,100
kids tied a lot.

1259
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:26,410
Yeah.

1260
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,840
Then dying from injury and sickness
and a lot of people died from sickness,

1261
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:31,081
you know,

1262
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:32,190
no vaccines.

1263
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,670
Right.

1264
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,810
When you just at the mercy and then
also it's the beginning of agriculture.

1265
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,500
All these diseases are emerging that we
don't have immune systems for it because

1266
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:41,334
they're being,

1267
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,650
they're being jumped
from like they're there,

1268
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,540
they're jumping from pigs to people.

1269
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,120
They're jumping from
chickens and birds to people.

1270
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:51,480
That's where the source of most of
these pandemic diseases come from.

1271
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,250
It comes from large scale agriculture.

1272
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,050
Those funky pigs all tucked together in
these little cages that doesn't come for

1273
00:35:58,051 --> 00:35:58,850
free.

1274
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,530
Like there's some demons are
being brewed in that mix.

1275
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,461
Yeah.

1276
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:02,911
Like this,

1277
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:03,390
this,

1278
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,050
what was this?

1279
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,490
What was the source of,

1280
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:06,324
um,

1281
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,710
the Spanish flu,

1282
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,860
which I think was the most
deadly epidemic in u s history.

1283
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:14,931
Oh,

1284
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:15,451
is that right?

1285
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:16,660
It was international too.

1286
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,570
Was International for sure.

1287
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,950
I think for sure it was the most
deadly epidemic in the u s yeah,

1288
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,840
but I think he came,

1289
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,550
I don't think it came from Spain.

1290
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,990
I think I want to say it came
from somewhere around Virginia.

1291
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,940
Does that bullshit?

1292
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,790
This is going to take time
probably in New Jersey.

1293
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,060
I feel like it came from
some sort of farm situation.

1294
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,523
I don't know why.

1295
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,931
I feel like,

1296
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,170
I'm guessing no surprises.

1297
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,850
Not more of that now because you see some
of these like pig farms and they have

1298
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:48,684
links.

1299
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,640
There are lakes of waste.

1300
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,960
Have you seen the drone footage?

1301
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,920
Is that what we're talking about?

1302
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,091
Oh my God.

1303
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:55,370
Some guy fluid,

1304
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:55,590
you know,

1305
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,150
cause they have these ag gag laws,

1306
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:59,940
which apparently one of
them just got shot down.

1307
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,710
Somebody sent me an email

1308
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,270
that some,

1309
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,020
maybe it was Idaho or Iowa,

1310
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:07,681
one of those places.

1311
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:08,010
One was,

1312
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,420
I states that,

1313
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:10,230
uh,

1314
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,800
the,

1315
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,633
uh,

1316
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,160
ag gag laws got shutdown to ag.

1317
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:14,761
Gag laws are,

1318
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:19,200
say if you are working in a slaughterhouse
and you saw horrific conditions,

1319
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,670
you got your cell phone out,

1320
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,510
you filmed it,

1321
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,890
you could get prosecuted,

1322
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,270
you would go to jail,

1323
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,500
you could be sued.

1324
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,610
Because if walking,

1325
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,500
all of those documentaries that came out,

1326
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,190
well it's,

1327
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,461
they,

1328
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:32,880
I think those ag gag laws existed as soon
as they figured out that people could

1329
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:33,714
film thing.

1330
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,231
You know,

1331
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:36,900
because a few people released
videos of her and it looked,

1332
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,540
those ag gag laws kept,

1333
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:40,441
you know,

1334
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:43,560
kept people from talking
about a lot of creepy shit.

1335
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,730
Like this video,

1336
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,050
if you see this video,

1337
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:50,850
this guy decided since no one's gonna
give him access to film the place openly,

1338
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,710
she's going to fly over it.

1339
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:55,740
So he flew over with a
drone Spanish flu thing.

1340
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,401
Okay.

1341
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,031
For many years,

1342
00:37:57,031 --> 00:38:00,930
medical historians and epidemiologists
hypothesize that the outbreak could have

1343
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:04,920
started in a British army
base in [inaudible] place,

1344
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,830
France or at Fort Riley in Kansas,

1345
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,480
where the first American cases of the
new strain of flu were recorded in March

1346
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:15,030
of 1918 more recently,

1347
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:18,630
experts have experts have
proposed a third hypothesis.

1348
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:23,631
The Spanish flu originated somewhere in
northern China in late 1917 and swiftly

1349
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:28,650
move to eastern Europe within
140,000 Chinese laborers and,

1350
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,340
uh,

1351
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,270
the French and British
governments recruited to
perform manual labor to free up

1352
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:35,710
the troops for war time duty.

1353
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,400
Wow.

1354
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,581
Yeah.

1355
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,110
I think more people died of that.

1356
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:39,790
Then they die then died in world war one.

1357
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,481
The fifth song,

1358
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:45,340
50 million people were
killed because of this damn,

1359
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,330
whoa.

1360
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,240
Just think about core disposal.

1361
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,340
50 million people claiming,

1362
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,120
look at this.

1363
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,660
It says,

1364
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,660
claiming more lives in a single year than
either the first world war or the four

1365
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:00,040
year long black death,

1366
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:04,630
bubonic plague outbreak that swept
Europe and Asia in the Middle Ages.

1367
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,780
And this is one that for whatever reason,

1368
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,220
people talk about the plague.

1369
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,960
They talk about the bubonic plague,

1370
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,580
like everyone's here,

1371
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,080
but no one talks about the Spanish flu.

1372
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,610
Like that's a rare,

1373
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,271
it's not,

1374
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,590
it doesn't get brought up that often.

1375
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:18,670
If you see this number,

1376
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,080
this number of people die.

1377
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:23,830
50 millions of people in a year in a year.

1378
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:24,664
Man.

1379
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,250
People talk about how
bad that is right now,

1380
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,150
but that's not what they're saying.

1381
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,900
They're saying it killed more lives in a
single year than either the first world

1382
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:34,900
war or the four year long
black death people on.

1383
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,080
It's when they have killed and that he
may have kept one third of the population

1384
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:38,741
was sick with it.

1385
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:39,820
At least they didn't all die.

1386
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,650
God Damn.

1387
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,600
I mean he taught,

1388
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,800
people think that the
world is in such bad shape.

1389
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,110
We don't have plagues.

1390
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,160
You know,

1391
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,960
there is a,

1392
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,960
the the poverty rate for the average
poverty rate in the world has gone up for

1393
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,380
like the last 10 years.

1394
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,640
There's less poverty,

1395
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:58,061
there's less.

1396
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,070
Starvation is more education.

1397
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:00,791
You know,

1398
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:01,624
there's a lot of,

1399
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,700
there's a lot of good shit going on too,

1400
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,690
but just think about that.

1401
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,050
We haven't had a world war in what,

1402
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:09,190
70 years?

1403
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,363
Yeah,

1404
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,460
it's been,

1405
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,390
it's been quite a while.

1406
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,051
Not to say it,

1407
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:15,820
not to diminish the wars
that are happening now,

1408
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:17,950
but something that really affected,

1409
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:18,671
you know,

1410
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:22,060
the entire population always feel like
even since high school that it's always

1411
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:23,140
been like around the corner.

1412
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:23,900
Yeah.

1413
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,950
That was when we were in high school was
the big fears that we're going to go to

1414
00:40:26,951 --> 00:40:27,910
war with the Russians.

1415
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,490
Do you remember going into the coat
room and putting your head between your

1416
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:30,970
knees?

1417
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,870
Did you have to do that?

1418
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,170
I don't think we did that and we used
to do this and we did the debt get under

1419
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,130
the desk drill,

1420
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,600
which is hilarious.

1421
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,800
Get Out of the desk.

1422
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,130
So stupid like Mitch,

1423
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:43,390
this is a nuclear war.

1424
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,650
Do these to tell you you're going to get
onto your desk as if they had some way

1425
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:48,910
to alleviate our stress.

1426
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,661
Yeah.

1427
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:50,021
I know.

1428
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:50,670
Attending,

1429
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,770
I could get under the desk.

1430
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:52,810
I'm going to give you an answer.

1431
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,913
Yeah,

1432
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,121
yeah.

1433
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,380
Nobody knew what the fuck to do,

1434
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,510
so they just made up some nonsense.

1435
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,340
Let's get under your desk.

1436
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,620
Duck Duck and cover Nicolette war,

1437
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,400
that linoleum is going to save your life.

1438
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:06,850
Yeah.

1439
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:07,331
Look at this.

1440
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,081
This is the drill.

1441
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:09,910
All these little kids
underneath the tables.

1442
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,120
What a fucked up thing
to put in a kid's head,

1443
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:13,840
man.

1444
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,740
Just stop and think about how close we
were to doing something so stupid that

1445
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,420
this could have become a reality.

1446
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,340
And how now think about how this is a
reality in certain parts of the world.

1447
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,090
Like in our place,

1448
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:28,924
it's not,

1449
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,490
but in other places it is.

1450
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,503
Yeah.

1451
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,403
And that's,

1452
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,440
that's their life.

1453
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,743
I mean,

1454
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,730
especially when it comes to
things like drone warfare,

1455
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,650
that freaks me out.

1456
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,151
I know.

1457
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:42,980
It's very effective at shooting terrorist.

1458
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:43,251
I know.

1459
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:43,581
It is.

1460
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:43,821
I know.

1461
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:44,391
It's excellent.

1462
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:46,910
It's also super effective
at killing civilians.

1463
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,680
Super effective.

1464
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:49,971
Yeah.

1465
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,260
And there's something about,

1466
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,180
when you think about how,

1467
00:41:52,181 --> 00:41:54,680
how we're being perceived
and the rest of the world,

1468
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:59,570
there's something about not even being
present for the accidental killing that

1469
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:00,500
makes it just,

1470
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,053
you know,

1471
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:02,730
okay.

1472
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,840
Twice as bad.

1473
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,740
It just seems weird.

1474
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:07,410
And apparently it gives
him pretty severe PTSD.

1475
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,220
Yeah.

1476
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:08,670
Um,

1477
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,031
you know,

1478
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:09,271
I'm,

1479
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:12,300
I'm laughing because I'm like thinking
like that's so crazy that they don't even

1480
00:42:12,301 --> 00:42:14,820
have to be there and they're getting PTSD.

1481
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:15,031
Like,

1482
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:18,080
just the fact that they're
doing it from a remote,

1483
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,530
I heard that pilots
are freaking out there.

1484
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,593
Some of them.

1485
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,470
Yeah.

1486
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,720
I'm,

1487
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,400
by the way,

1488
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,840
this is just what I'm reading
might not even be true now.

1489
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,210
I read that sensationalized,

1490
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,180
but I would imagine that would
kind of fuck with your head.

1491
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,370
Okay.

1492
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:31,791
Yeah.

1493
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:33,350
The first couple of times it'd be fun.

1494
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,770
It'd be like a video game and then you,

1495
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,270
and then we'd start to
sink in when you heard,

1496
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:39,590
when you heard the reports later.

1497
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,280
Okay.

1498
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:40,431
Yeah.

1499
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:41,264
You'd have to,

1500
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,340
so detach yourself from it that it would
be like this growing thing in the back

1501
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:47,150
of your mind.

1502
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,700
Yeah.

1503
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,990
He was just launching missiles
into apartment buildings

1504
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,190
and they're telling you it's okay.

1505
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,630
Everybody says it's okay.

1506
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,190
Yeah.

1507
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,160
This is what you're supposed to do.

1508
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:58,850
Um,

1509
00:42:58,850 --> 00:42:59,960
when I talked to,

1510
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:00,740
uh,

1511
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,870
this gentleman than I
know that was in the CIA,

1512
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,840
he said that all those
decisions are done by lawyers.

1513
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,460
How really?

1514
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:07,970
Yeah.

1515
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,350
Whether or not they do it or not do it.

1516
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:09,561
He goes,

1517
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:10,071
at the end of the day,

1518
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:15,071
lawyers are deciding whether or not
it's like likely to be successful.

1519
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:16,700
What's the legal ramifications?

1520
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:17,534
He goes,

1521
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,850
when you're talking
about that kind of stuff,

1522
00:43:18,851 --> 00:43:19,131
he was like,

1523
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:19,840
seriously,

1524
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,890
it's a lot of us decided by lawyers.

1525
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,880
I'm like Whoa.

1526
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,490
Cause they want to know if
you show her operated the,

1527
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,350
the siting and [inaudible]

1528
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:27,860
yeah.

1529
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,161
Yeah.

1530
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:30,260
And they want to make sure that
all the ducks are in order.

1531
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,123
Yeah.

1532
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:31,731
Which I mean,

1533
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:33,290
is that better or is that worse?

1534
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,531
I mean,

1535
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:35,960
is it better to just leave
it to the generals to design,

1536
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:37,220
you know,

1537
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,600
you get this cartoonish impression of
what that would be like some general,

1538
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:45,770
like the fucking guy from avatar would
go down there who are going to fuck

1539
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:46,410
everybody.

1540
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,720
That's what everybody's worried about.

1541
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:48,080
Right.

1542
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,970
The character,

1543
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,790
the,

1544
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:52,730
the cartoonish out of control.

1545
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,260
Murderous soldier.

1546
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,173
Right?

1547
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:56,361
Yeah.

1548
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:57,570
What was the Kubrick movie?

1549
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:59,001
Oh,

1550
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:00,050
a full metal jacket.

1551
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,690
Now the one with the,

1552
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:02,524
uh,

1553
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,230
Peter Sally's was in it
and it was about how I,

1554
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,440
how I something the nuclear,

1555
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,420
Oh yes.

1556
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,620
Dr. Strange.

1557
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,483
Yeah.

1558
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,353
Like the general,

1559
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,180
yes.

1560
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:13,511
Yeah.

1561
00:44:13,511 --> 00:44:14,830
They're always like cartoonish.

1562
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,570
Yeah man.

1563
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,610
You better hope guys like
that are on your side.

1564
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:19,791
Dr. Strange.

1565
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,040
So that was a great movie man.

1566
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:22,840
It was so weird to watch it today.

1567
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:23,380
Yeah,

1568
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,580
I watched it a few years back.

1569
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:25,443
Did you really?

1570
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:25,751
Yeah,

1571
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:28,060
like maybe four or five years
back and washed it and I was like,

1572
00:44:28,061 --> 00:44:28,601
wow.

1573
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:33,601
It's so wild to watch these little
captured moments in time where you can see

1574
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:35,820
like people were different then.

1575
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,570
Yeah,

1576
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,800
like old movies.

1577
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,390
When you watch old movies,

1578
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,340
you know what the biggest indication that
something's different is women didn't

1579
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:45,174
work out that.

1580
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:46,320
Yeah,

1581
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,320
they weren't like fit like we are used
to seeing a lot of actresses that are on

1582
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:53,160
TV and the movies date,

1583
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,920
they all do like crossfit or something.

1584
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:56,970
They're all working out.

1585
00:44:56,971 --> 00:45:01,920
They're all taking gymnastics or something
or they're doing spin classes and and

1586
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:04,620
they have trainers and doing
these box jumps and shit.

1587
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,710
Like girls are built now
it's a different thing.

1588
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:12,030
If you go look at like King Kong look
like Fay Wray and King Kong soft.

1589
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:12,710
They just,

1590
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,350
yes.

1591
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,060
They're not even picking
up their groceries.

1592
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,070
They're built different.

1593
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:17,681
Yeah,

1594
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:18,580
and they don't last.

1595
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,900
If they didn't do manual labor,

1596
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:20,734
they don't last.

1597
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:23,980
Some of them do when they do.

1598
00:45:23,981 --> 00:45:24,641
It's a shock.

1599
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:25,570
Like Raquel Welch,

1600
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,840
like deep into her sixties
Janice is still hot,

1601
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,610
so feel around right to the end.

1602
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,210
Jesus.

1603
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:31,680
Yeah.

1604
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,570
It's a few of them that
were so potent that they're,

1605
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,310
they're spell lasted there.

1606
00:45:36,311 --> 00:45:41,311
Their entire existence is just started
this Jane Fonda Workout Fonda back in the

1607
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,640
day with the doggy thing.

1608
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,361
What was that like?

1609
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:46,130
1970s seven to me.

1610
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,323
Damn,

1611
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,990
that was crazy.

1612
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,810
That was so fucking big.

1613
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,720
It was the first time women
were marketed to for exercise.

1614
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,590
I think so.

1615
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,491
I think so.

1616
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:05,491
I think before that women may be competed
in athletic events like Diane sticks

1617
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,240
and shit like that when they were young,

1618
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,000
but then when they probably got
families or moved on to jobs,

1619
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:10,930
they probably stopped.

1620
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,610
What is this one go?

1621
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:13,900
A robot championship.

1622
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,390
Oh my God.

1623
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,640
Look at this as a choreographed dance.

1624
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,620
This is so strange.

1625
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:21,660
Oh,

1626
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,151
that's right.

1627
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:24,160
Do you remember aerobics click.

1628
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,960
I'm going to take an aerobics class.

1629
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,300
Yeah,

1630
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,133
you remember that?

1631
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,260
I'll be kind of just dance
around and you would do stop,

1632
00:46:30,261 --> 00:46:31,130
feel the pump,

1633
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,010
pop the pop and two and three and go.

1634
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,540
They turn everybody gay
for about five years.

1635
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,713
But it all these guys,

1636
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:39,963
look at these guys.

1637
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,820
These guys are straight as fuck and
they don't even know they're doing gay

1638
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:43,654
stuff.

1639
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:44,771
You know it's like,

1640
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:46,600
it's like when before,

1641
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,440
but he knew that Rob Halford
from Judas priest is it is gay.

1642
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:56,240
He used to make everybody dress up like
him because everybody like kids that

1643
00:46:56,241 --> 00:46:58,790
were straight kids that we're
huge fans that Judas priest,

1644
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:03,910
they would wear the cap and the jet and
wearing gay aesthetic like gay biker

1645
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:05,250
looking right.

1646
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,083
Tough guys.

1647
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,930
Everybody got into it because
they loved him because Judas,

1648
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:14,950
it is so bad ass and he's such a fucking
awesome front man that like he had

1649
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:17,820
straight guys dressing up like a gay bike.

1650
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:19,200
That's fucking hilarious.

1651
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,100
And then he comes out and they're all so,

1652
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:21,421
they're like,

1653
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:21,761
what?

1654
00:47:21,761 --> 00:47:22,860
This so confused.

1655
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,480
He did it in a concert.

1656
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,550
There's 100,000.

1657
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:25,771
No,

1658
00:47:25,771 --> 00:47:29,110
I'm just saying what if he did and
they looked down and there were actual

1659
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:32,560
wearing is what I like in my men.

1660
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,950
I had him on a show I did once.

1661
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,220
It was a,

1662
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,080
it was like to this,

1663
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:38,914
um,

1664
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:41,140
thing for VH one called the list.

1665
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:41,591
Oh yeah,

1666
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:42,160
I did that.

1667
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,521
You did it.

1668
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:43,354
You do host it too.

1669
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:43,721
Yeah.

1670
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:44,320
Here he is.

1671
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:44,770
Look at that.

1672
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:45,011
I mean,

1673
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:46,180
look at the outfit Bro.

1674
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,020
Seriously.

1675
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:47,471
Wow.

1676
00:47:47,471 --> 00:47:49,750
The leather paper boy hat on.

1677
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:55,170
Or it's more like a soldier's hat and
he's got leather vest on with no shirt

1678
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:56,141
underneath.

1679
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:58,360
Leather gloves at spikes all SNM shit.

1680
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,111
Tight,

1681
00:47:59,111 --> 00:47:59,411
tight,

1682
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:00,370
tight leather pants.

1683
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:01,204
It's hilarious.

1684
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,513
Freddie Mercury.

1685
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:05,741
Yeah,

1686
00:48:05,741 --> 00:48:06,574
man.

1687
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,080
Um,

1688
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:08,913
what was my point?

1689
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:10,510
What we're,

1690
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:10,930
we're,

1691
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,270
we're talking about something right
before we were talking about that.

1692
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:13,661
Oh,

1693
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:13,851
the,

1694
00:48:13,851 --> 00:48:14,081
the,

1695
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:16,060
the aerobics aerobics guys.

1696
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:16,181
Like,

1697
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:16,451
come on,

1698
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:16,600
man.

1699
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,550
They had dudes were in singles.

1700
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,413
Look at this.

1701
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,470
Look at this outfit.

1702
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,280
This,

1703
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,900
that's like a singlet from wrestling,

1704
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:24,430
but with long pants.

1705
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:24,850
Yeah.

1706
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:28,240
This is bananas that they
got man addressed like this.

1707
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,500
Look at what they're wearing.

1708
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,760
You see their nipples,

1709
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,620
like their nipples are popped out,

1710
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,500
they're all super gate out.

1711
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,000
Then they pick out those three
quarter length Reebok high tops.

1712
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,460
Exactly what the velcro
you had to get the velcro.

1713
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,810
That's the newest technology.

1714
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,000
Yeah.

1715
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,571
So look,

1716
00:48:46,571 --> 00:48:48,580
every girl is dressed like,

1717
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:49,503
you know,

1718
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,090
I guess they look more like why
they have two different outfits.

1719
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:54,220
The girls have some of
them expose the mid drift,

1720
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:57,160
like the dirty girls that they are.

1721
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,370
And the other ones that
we're a a one piece.

1722
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,580
Oh Alan Thicke was hosting
this mother fucker.

1723
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:04,781
Oh Shit.

1724
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:05,710
Course he was,

1725
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,311
oh shit.

1726
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:06,671
Look at him.

1727
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:07,390
Look at that hair.

1728
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,440
It's wonderful.

1729
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:10,660
Look at his jacket.

1730
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,970
Solve Miami vice doubt.

1731
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,211
Yeah,

1732
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,740
he's got shoulder pads.

1733
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,210
You got up,

1734
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:18,520
got to get rid of the shoulder pads.

1735
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,990
Back then you could have shoulder pads.

1736
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,200
And I remember having shoulder
pads and my first jacket.

1737
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,010
It's nice.

1738
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,843
It makes you look better.

1739
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,290
It isn't like a stuffed bra for a girl.

1740
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,170
It is.

1741
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:30,400
Yeah.

1742
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,270
It's the same thing.

1743
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:31,750
Yeah.

1744
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,320
Yeah.

1745
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,610
But how weird that people,

1746
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,930
so do you remember people
actually dressing like that
and in a class situation,

1747
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,460
did they go to classes,

1748
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,220
dress like that grade school?

1749
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:43,300
We had uniforms and stuff.

1750
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:43,711
So no,

1751
00:49:43,711 --> 00:49:44,630
I see.

1752
00:49:44,631 --> 00:49:47,320
If I never took it a robotics class.

1753
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,170
But see if you could find video
footage of an aerobics class.

1754
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,910
If all the guys that dress like that,

1755
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,260
those dudes got punked.

1756
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:53,980
Yeah.

1757
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,870
Somebody talked him into
dressing like a dancer.

1758
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:56,460
Yeah.

1759
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,293
Yeah.

1760
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,740
And they're not showing
the kids this video.

1761
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,020
Why not?

1762
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,030
So you used to be stupid.

1763
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,690
So what if you're stupid
once you're stupid forever.

1764
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,560
Is that real?

1765
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,603
Come on.

1766
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,630
Your kids love seeing
you looking stupid tiff.

1767
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,360
And you should tell him I had a mullet.

1768
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,343
They laugh.

1769
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,620
One thing that I always do and I told
my kids would do something wrong.

1770
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,700
They've done something wrong.

1771
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,211
I say I,

1772
00:50:19,211 --> 00:50:20,044
I did worse,

1773
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:20,800
way worse.

1774
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,530
I did exactly what you
did and I lied about it.

1775
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,393
I always lied.

1776
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,280
My parents asked me if
I did anything wrong,

1777
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,153
always loud.

1778
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,100
And I'm like,

1779
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,870
I know if he did something
or you didn't do it,

1780
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:30,704
I'm not mad at you.

1781
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,120
I'm just trying to make you not do it
in the future cause I want you to learn

1782
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:35,983
why it's bad.

1783
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,970
And so I would always tell that's good.

1784
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,090
The number one thing I always
do and I get mad sometimes.

1785
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,050
I mean it's just there's,

1786
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,580
there's no way you can't sometimes,

1787
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,960
especially as they get older,

1788
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,590
they get upset about things and
you got who you got to calm down.

1789
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:52,910
You gotta to like figure out how to calm
down and stop screaming at each other.

1790
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,890
Sisters scream at each other.

1791
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,180
You took my thing.

1792
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,000
That's fine.

1793
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,621
Yeah it's not,

1794
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:58,550
you gave it to me.

1795
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:58,940
No,

1796
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,930
but I can take it back.

1797
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,701
That's amazing.

1798
00:51:02,701 --> 00:51:03,540
The pitch they can get.

1799
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,090
Cause usually when people get
that hostile to each other,

1800
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:06,560
you,

1801
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:06,901
you,

1802
00:51:06,901 --> 00:51:08,430
you're worried there's going
to be a physical fight.

1803
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,620
But sisters can take it two,

1804
00:51:10,621 --> 00:51:11,401
three times.

1805
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,890
That level it makes you so uncomfortable,

1806
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,510
but then they'll cuddle with each other.

1807
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:16,863
Yeah.

1808
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:17,800
It's funny.

1809
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,190
That's sweet difference.

1810
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,460
Two years.

1811
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:20,621
Yeah.

1812
00:51:20,621 --> 00:51:23,050
It's interesting watching them evolve,

1813
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:28,320
like watching them learn new facts and
learn new things and wash their little

1814
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:30,010
brain filled with information.

1815
00:51:30,011 --> 00:51:32,470
Their vocabulary starts
growing and you're like,

1816
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:33,520
wow.

1817
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:33,990
Yeah.

1818
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,823
And you realize like,

1819
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:35,770
Eh,

1820
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:36,011
I mean,

1821
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:36,731
I've said this before,

1822
00:51:36,731 --> 00:51:38,140
but it bears repeating.

1823
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,990
We look at people in a static state.

1824
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,460
We're always looking at people like if
I see a guy and he's 40 years old and

1825
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:46,294
he's an asshole,

1826
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,250
oh that's that 40 year old asshole.

1827
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,241
That fucking guy.

1828
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:50,074
I know that guy.

1829
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,720
That guy is so annoying.

1830
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:54,730
But you don't think are that was a baby.

1831
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:55,390
Yeah,

1832
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:59,090
that was a baby with a bunch
of shitty data thrown out him.

1833
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,300
A bunch of Shitty interactions,

1834
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,650
bad genes,

1835
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:04,090
bad environment.

1836
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,340
Maybe some alcoholism,

1837
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:06,960
maybe who,

1838
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,580
maybe some,

1839
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,110
uh,

1840
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,320
throw it in all of it,

1841
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:09,801
right?

1842
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:11,120
The lady HD

1843
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,220
bad nutrition.

1844
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,030
Throw it all in there,

1845
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:14,631
throw it all in there.

1846
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,370
A bunch of bad breaks in life.

1847
00:52:16,371 --> 00:52:17,204
Throw it all in there,

1848
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:17,730
you know,

1849
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:20,480
I mean that happens to so many people.

1850
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,100
So you look at them and instead of,

1851
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,820
I always like look at
what they are now like,

1852
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:25,820
oh this guy.

1853
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,260
But what they are,

1854
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:32,261
all of them including you and me is
a baby that became an older thing.

1855
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:33,981
You know,

1856
00:52:33,981 --> 00:52:38,981
and a great deal of people whose
lives are chaotically fucked up.

1857
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:42,140
It's through no fault of their own.

1858
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,750
It's a great deal of him.

1859
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,810
It's a large number.

1860
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,650
Right.

1861
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,483
You know,

1862
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,880
and as I've gotten older and tried
to be more compassionate and more,

1863
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,270
uh,

1864
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,110
more understanding,

1865
00:52:54,111 --> 00:52:54,944
more patient,

1866
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,700
those are the things that I worked on
a lot and I still struggle with it.

1867
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,260
But um,

1868
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,221
it's,

1869
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:02,900
I don't think that's
anything you ever really,

1870
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:03,800
totally get over,

1871
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:04,700
but you get better.

1872
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,070
You get,

1873
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:08,870
I've seen a lot over the years here.

1874
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:09,770
A lot more patient.

1875
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:10,880
Yeah.

1876
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,880
I think a lot of that has to do with just
getting better at being a person when

1877
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:17,301
you work on it.

1878
00:53:17,301 --> 00:53:22,160
But I think also a lot of it has to
do with my change of my attitude about

1879
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:24,080
people and that I,

1880
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:26,430
I started to think of them as

1881
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:32,070
a product of a lot of different
interactions and that we,

1882
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:32,911
like,

1883
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:34,470
you hear the term white privilege,

1884
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,520
it's a fucked up term,

1885
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:35,910
right?

1886
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:36,743
It's weird.

1887
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,090
But you have to admit,

1888
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:44,750
if you're a person and nothing completely
catastrophic has happened to you and

1889
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:51,450
you became this 50 year old successful
comedian that's an Emmy award winning

1890
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:52,380
writer and like,

1891
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,401
Yay,

1892
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:54,720
bad things happen to you.

1893
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:55,380
Right?

1894
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,650
But they could have
been fucking way worse.

1895
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,330
It could've been way worse.

1896
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:03,840
And for some people it
is fucking way worse.

1897
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:09,200
They just got a shit roll the dice from
the jump and it's been bad experience

1898
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:15,441
after bad experience and fucking
abuse and violence and jail and the,

1899
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:16,440
the,

1900
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,280
you can't get out.

1901
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:18,031
There's no way out.

1902
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:19,110
You can't even read.

1903
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:19,600
She's like,

1904
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,420
you're frothing around at see,

1905
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:22,860
trying to keep your head above water

1906
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:27,300
and you run into them when
they're 32 at a gas station.

1907
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,970
And it's as much,

1908
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,130
it's a,

1909
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:32,490
I mean,

1910
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:37,350
it's not saying it's not their fault
because whenever someone does anything to

1911
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:37,680
you,

1912
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,520
it's their fault.

1913
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:40,620
Like if someone commits violence on you,

1914
00:54:40,621 --> 00:54:41,700
they shouldn't have done that.

1915
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:42,370
It's their fault.

1916
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,203
That's agreed.

1917
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,970
But what were the underlying
factors that led this to happen?

1918
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,820
And for all this talk that
we do in this country about,

1919
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,181
uh,

1920
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:57,540
about violence and crime and the
problem of violence and crime,

1921
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,420
nobody ever looks at it in terms of like,

1922
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:05,160
how do you stop children from
being raised fucked up and violent?

1923
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,380
How do you stop them from being abused?

1924
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:11,040
How do you step in you that cause
that's the root of all of it,

1925
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:11,441
right.

1926
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:15,280
And I think early childhood education
can make a big difference because if you

1927
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:17,050
have a kid growing up and you know,

1928
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:18,160
the dad took off,

1929
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:18,941
there's no money,

1930
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,080
he's living on the streets.

1931
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,210
If you can create an environment for that
four year old to come in and have two

1932
00:55:25,211 --> 00:55:26,200
decent meals,

1933
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,460
a nap time,

1934
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,170
some structured play,

1935
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,740
it makes all the difference in the world
because that can become like the family

1936
00:55:32,741 --> 00:55:33,290
to them.

1937
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:34,340
Now let me ask you this,

1938
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:36,223
cause this is the,

1939
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:40,220
we're in the biggest crisis
in terms of immigration,

1940
00:55:40,221 --> 00:55:41,660
in terms of national discussion.

1941
00:55:41,661 --> 00:55:42,620
The biggest discussion of it,

1942
00:55:42,621 --> 00:55:44,450
they're not going to
ever remember right now.

1943
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,590
This wall shit where the government is
completely shut down and no one's budging

1944
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:49,191
on either side.

1945
00:55:49,191 --> 00:55:51,860
And all these government workers are
not getting paid and so on because Trump

1946
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,210
wants $5 billion for this wall.

1947
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:55,993
I'm not.

1948
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,253
Let's just,

1949
00:55:58,370 --> 00:55:59,810
in an ideal world,

1950
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:04,150
it would be ideal if the way the world
worked was the way America works where

1951
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,240
you could just go wherever you want.

1952
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,400
That'd be the ideal world.

1953
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:12,620
If the whole world was America in the in
the sense of you can go to New Mexico,

1954
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:14,540
you didn't have to get paperwork signed.

1955
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,690
You don't have to know.

1956
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:20,240
It has to tell you whether or not you're
allowed to go visit or not go visit.

1957
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:21,440
He just drive there.

1958
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:22,371
That's,

1959
00:56:22,371 --> 00:56:23,890
that's a nice thing about America.

1960
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:25,150
It's almost like Europe,

1961
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,530
but you don't need a passport.

1962
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,161
Not In,

1963
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:27,791
it's like Europe.

1964
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:29,740
I know you guys have been around
longer and all that good stuff.

1965
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,671
That's not what I mean.

1966
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:32,680
I mean in terms of there's
a bunch of different fields.

1967
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,570
It's all speaking one language,

1968
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:38,800
but like there's a big difference between
visiting Montana and visiting Miami.

1969
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,371
You know,

1970
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:40,600
if you go to billings,

1971
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:44,260
Montana and hang out with the local
folk at a coffee shop and then you go to

1972
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:49,210
some fucking crazy after I already after
hours party in Miami and Miami beach at

1973
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:50,810
four in the morning and p did,

1974
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:52,660
he shows up and fucking,

1975
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:53,081
you know,

1976
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:56,440
and there's all these celebrities and
people are doing coke on the floor and

1977
00:56:56,441 --> 00:56:56,591
like,

1978
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:58,540
what the fuck is this?

1979
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:59,940
This is a different world.

1980
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,110
It's a different world and there's
a bunch of these different worlds.

1981
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:03,400
New York City's a different world.

1982
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:03,941
You know,

1983
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:05,080
La is a different world.

1984
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,910
You're allowed to go there.

1985
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,960
Wouldn't it be great if the
whole world was like that?

1986
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,460
You can just kind of go wherever you want
it to go and it would all sort itself

1987
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:12,790
out.

1988
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:16,360
The idea is you can't because it would
fuck up our quality of life and would

1989
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:17,380
make us less safe.

1990
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:19,780
And I get the argument,

1991
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:22,450
certainly you don't want to
bring in criminals and murderers.

1992
00:57:22,451 --> 00:57:25,600
You don't want drug dealers making their
way into this country and starting gang

1993
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:26,740
violence and all that stuff.

1994
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:27,100
Yes,

1995
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,180
you're absolutely right.

1996
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:30,490
And to deny that I think
it's pretty fucking foolish.

1997
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:31,751
Yeah.

1998
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:34,420
I think it's a matter of
like there's a lot to it.

1999
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,560
It's a fluid.

2000
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:38,440
The border is always going to be
fluid and it needs to be fluid.

2001
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:38,651
You know,

2002
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:43,210
we need the immigrant spirit of coming
in and a lot of them do start small

2003
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:44,200
businesses when you know,

2004
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:44,531
and again,

2005
00:57:44,531 --> 00:57:45,820
when they're brought in legally.

2006
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,163
Um,

2007
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,700
and so how do you,

2008
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:53,590
how do you create a flow of people that
is good for us cause they say most of

2009
00:57:53,591 --> 00:57:56,200
the immigrants that come
here are the smartest,

2010
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:57,250
sharpest people,

2011
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,650
most driven and wherever they're from.

2012
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,870
So we're actually drawing a really good,

2013
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,441
you know,

2014
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:02,590
be,

2015
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,000
they talk so much about the criminals,

2016
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:08,350
but the truth is most of them that
are coming over here are the ones that

2017
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,240
probably have the most
to offer to this country.

2018
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,780
Well exactly like our parents' generation.

2019
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,340
Like our grandparents,

2020
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:15,420
like my grandparents.

2021
00:58:15,421 --> 00:58:16,120
Like when did your,

2022
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,340
your grandparents come over here?

2023
00:58:17,341 --> 00:58:17,400
It,

2024
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,280
was it your grandparents or

2025
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,630
teen 10 my grandparents.

2026
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:20,900
Yeah,

2027
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,733
mine as well.

2028
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:25,160
My grandfather was one of 13
and 12 of them came over here.

2029
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,860
And they lived in a two
room fucking mud hut.

2030
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:31,040
Somehow they kept finding the money
to send one kid over at a time.

2031
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:35,000
Like usually when there were
about 15 whole crazy shit.

2032
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:35,730
Yeah.

2033
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:38,790
See that kind of shit is
what I'm talking about.

2034
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:40,170
Like those kind of people,

2035
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:42,960
shouldn't they be allowed to come here?

2036
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,180
That's,

2037
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,700
that's how this thing got started.

2038
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:49,950
The real problem is that their
spots that suck as the real problem.

2039
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,510
It's like we were talking
about like white privilege.

2040
00:58:51,511 --> 00:58:52,650
White privilege is not the problem.

2041
00:58:52,651 --> 00:58:53,760
The problem is racism.

2042
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:57,000
Racism doesn't exist in
everyone's exactly the same.

2043
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,460
And then we're okay and then we don't
need to worry about white privilege.

2044
00:58:59,461 --> 00:59:00,660
What the real problem.

2045
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,650
You're not getting,

2046
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:05,820
you're not getting racist things
thrown at you the way black people are.

2047
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:06,031
Yeah,

2048
00:59:06,031 --> 00:59:06,780
for sure.

2049
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,740
But that's not the problem.

2050
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:10,080
The problem is racist things
being thrown at black people.

2051
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,800
It's not that I don't get it right.

2052
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:16,230
It's say you get it right and it's like
it took to highlight the fact that it's

2053
00:59:16,231 --> 00:59:17,280
not happening to me.

2054
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,560
I get what you're saying.

2055
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,980
But the real problem,

2056
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:21,290
we're,

2057
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,620
I think it's a distraction that the
real problem is the racism itself.

2058
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:25,520
The real problem is the,

2059
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:30,850
when you see actual Nazis
in 2018 2019 actual ones,

2060
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,740
real ones like not,

2061
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:35,600
not just dressing up cause
they think it's a hoot.

2062
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,400
You go move rebel.

2063
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:38,910
I'm fucking road.

2064
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,020
I got a piece of tape under my nose.

2065
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,020
The,

2066
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:44,090
there's a fucking people
that aren't really Nazis,

2067
00:59:44,091 --> 00:59:45,250
but they're dumb here.

2068
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:45,830
Right.

2069
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,230
But then you see a real
Nazi in 2019 you're like,

2070
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:48,501
okay,

2071
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,810
that real racism.

2072
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,673
Yeah.

2073
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,800
Now when they go into a,

2074
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:58,690
I was in Portland and they said there's
regular clashes like once a month

2075
00:59:58,691 --> 01:00:02,650
there's a demonstration and it's either
the alt right having a demonstration and

2076
01:00:02,651 --> 01:00:03,281
then the a,

2077
01:00:03,281 --> 01:00:03,851
what do they call them?

2078
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:08,851
The something far Antifa Antifa show up
and they have regular fights and it's

2079
01:00:08,921 --> 01:00:09,910
fucking Nazis.

2080
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:11,330
God Damn.

2081
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:14,440
Oregon's a fucked up state
because it was originally,

2082
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,450
there were no black
people allowed in Oregon.

2083
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:17,170
That's the,

2084
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:17,950
that's the,

2085
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:18,191
you know,

2086
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:19,120
cause now Portland is,

2087
01:00:19,121 --> 01:00:20,320
is very progressive,

2088
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,180
super progressive or acid,

2089
01:00:22,181 --> 01:00:23,560
but there's no black people there.

2090
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:25,210
So it seems there are,

2091
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:25,410
it's,

2092
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,890
he feels a little hollow
that when you're there,

2093
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,530
I just did new year's Eve
shows there and they were,

2094
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:29,951
they were,

2095
01:00:29,951 --> 01:00:32,110
it was all white.

2096
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:33,790
It was all white.

2097
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:34,624
It was weird.

2098
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:35,920
That is weird.

2099
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,071
There.

2100
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:36,400
Dot.

2101
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,890
If I was black I would go
to Portland and his second,

2102
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,870
you'd have so many friends instantly.

2103
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:42,760
Everybody wants to high five.

2104
01:00:42,761 --> 01:00:44,680
You have you over for dinner.

2105
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,153
It's um,

2106
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:53,070
the real problem for sure is any
kind of discrimination because that,

2107
01:00:53,071 --> 01:00:55,540
that also fucks with us too because if,

2108
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,220
if people are discriminating
against people,

2109
01:00:57,221 --> 01:00:58,180
we can't even make fun of them.

2110
01:00:58,181 --> 01:01:00,580
Now we have to leave him alone
because he's punching down like,

2111
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,170
but it's right there.

2112
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,480
The best joke,

2113
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,200
I mean when you think
about it as a stand up,

2114
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:07,600
what your topics are,

2115
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:08,830
race,

2116
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:09,910
racism,

2117
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:12,160
sexuality,

2118
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,113
politics,

2119
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,141
it costs,

2120
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:15,450
people don't do politics.

2121
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,160
I know.

2122
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,750
I would say the average comic
is talking about two topics.

2123
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,420
Racism and sexuality.

2124
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:27,650
You did a great job of co
covering politics without,

2125
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:28,740
uh,

2126
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,240
actually being political.

2127
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,810
You do a great job with that.

2128
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:32,600
You're,

2129
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,750
you're Hillary Clinton bit.

2130
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:38,363
Yeah.

2131
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,260
I,

2132
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,870
I did this thing during the election
about her and I didn't mean it to knock

2133
01:01:42,871 --> 01:01:43,141
her,

2134
01:01:43,141 --> 01:01:45,660
but it really wasn't
about knocking anybody.

2135
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,300
It was about her having
a dry pussy and you know,

2136
01:01:48,301 --> 01:01:50,790
that's the kind of political
comedy you can expect from me.

2137
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:54,750
It was also about countdown
till Trump calls her a con.

2138
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,430
That was my favorite.

2139
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,340
It was my favorite line
about the election.

2140
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:05,891
Dude.

2141
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:06,521
I did the,

2142
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:10,990
I did the dry cut jokes about her and
then a true Carrie was in the audience and

2143
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:12,190
he came up to me after the show.

2144
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,730
He gave me an entire piece of paper
with more jokes on that premise.

2145
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,550
He had tears in his eyes.

2146
01:02:18,551 --> 01:02:20,010
Like that's the thing I've ever seen

2147
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,161
here.

2148
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:20,994
Take these.

2149
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,410
He loves filth.

2150
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,700
Drew Carey's one of the
nicest guys you ever.

2151
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:24,941
Yeah,

2152
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:25,570
he's great.

2153
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:26,860
I met him at the Improv and dude,

2154
01:02:26,861 --> 01:02:28,000
he talks to everybody.

2155
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,670
He was given young comics advice,

2156
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,050
telling them write a joke a day.

2157
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:32,950
Just one joke a day.

2158
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:33,460
Yeah.

2159
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,420
You get one joke a day.

2160
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:35,980
That's good advice for a week.

2161
01:02:35,981 --> 01:02:36,814
You've got seven jokes.

2162
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,020
Make yourself write a joke.

2163
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:38,460
Yeah,

2164
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,020
that's right.

2165
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,360
How do you write a joke yesterday?

2166
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,110
Nah,

2167
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,940
I wrote some shit that wasn't funny.

2168
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,160
That's root some shit.

2169
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:45,351
Yeah,

2170
01:02:45,351 --> 01:02:45,840
we did.

2171
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,680
You and I did the store
together last night.

2172
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:47,951
Yeah.

2173
01:02:47,951 --> 01:02:49,300
And the last night I came home wrote.

2174
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,050
Yeah.

2175
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:50,321
Yeah.

2176
01:02:50,321 --> 01:02:50,801
I'm just,

2177
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:51,220
um,

2178
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:51,400
I,

2179
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,920
I've in this stage of a couple of these
bits and I'm working on right now where

2180
01:02:54,921 --> 01:02:55,270
the,

2181
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,103
they're just like,

2182
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,670
they're on Bambi legs.

2183
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,020
They'll go south on me.

2184
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,420
I'll lose the script.

2185
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,313
Yeah.

2186
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:02,621
It's,

2187
01:03:02,621 --> 01:03:03,250
um,

2188
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:07,510
it's interesting because when you go
from doing a special and then chuck and

2189
01:03:07,511 --> 01:03:09,190
everything out and starting from scratch,

2190
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,570
it's the most fun time.

2191
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,020
Yeah.

2192
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:11,601
Cause you're like a,

2193
01:03:11,601 --> 01:03:11,861
you look,

2194
01:03:11,861 --> 01:03:12,880
you're a beginner again.

2195
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,640
You thinking about it all the time.

2196
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,770
I'd like after dinner
I've got a half hour.

2197
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:17,310
I'm like,

2198
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:18,610
I want to get back to that bit.

2199
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:19,663
Yeah.

2200
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:19,900
Yeah.

2201
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,600
You think that you're thinking
about it all the time.

2202
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:22,870
Yeah.

2203
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,370
Like you're thinking
about bits all the time.

2204
01:03:24,371 --> 01:03:27,070
Whereas once you have an act
together and you could do,

2205
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:27,701
you do an hour,

2206
01:03:27,701 --> 01:03:28,840
20 minutes easy,

2207
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,310
then you're not thinking
about it that much.

2208
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,630
You're thinking about when you do it,

2209
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:32,670
are you thinking about
it when you're right,

2210
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:32,930
but you know,

2211
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:34,060
thinking about it all day?

2212
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:34,471
No.

2213
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:36,450
You're tweaking it in in motion.

2214
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:38,820
Like when you're on stage
and you've got the hour down,

2215
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:39,931
that's when we,

2216
01:03:39,931 --> 01:03:42,930
you and I were talking about a comedian
you just told to take a little extra

2217
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:47,190
time before they did this special and
it really is and that extra few months

2218
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:52,140
that you find emphasizing
this syllable makes the joke,

2219
01:03:52,141 --> 01:03:54,390
get an applause break
instead of just laughs.

2220
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,570
It's also one of the most
interactive art forms ever.

2221
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:01,390
Whereas you need other people to do it.

2222
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:03,610
You need other people to watch.

2223
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,340
There's no way I can do that without you,

2224
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:07,780
without people listening,

2225
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:08,980
the watching,

2226
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:09,670
whatever it is.

2227
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:10,061
I can't,

2228
01:04:10,061 --> 01:04:10,900
you can't do it right.

2229
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:14,080
You need them because
they help you make it.

2230
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,250
Their reactions to what you're saying
tightens up what you're saying right

2231
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:18,581
there.

2232
01:04:18,581 --> 01:04:21,100
Reactions to make you throw away.

2233
01:04:21,101 --> 01:04:22,810
Certain parts just aren't working right,

2234
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,891
but you think it's funny.

2235
01:04:23,891 --> 01:04:24,724
They don't think it's funny.

2236
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:27,610
Like how many times did they not think
it's funny before you decided that part

2237
01:04:27,611 --> 01:04:28,540
might not be that good?

2238
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:29,830
Let me concentrate on this part.

2239
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:31,150
This part seems to have fruit to it.

2240
01:04:31,151 --> 01:04:31,720
This part,

2241
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,800
this is the part that kills,

2242
01:04:32,801 --> 01:04:34,330
I didn't even expect this part to work,

2243
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:37,690
but this partner and become a bigger
part of the bit than the first part and

2244
01:04:37,691 --> 01:04:39,130
then weird stuff starts branching off,

2245
01:04:39,131 --> 01:04:40,930
but I don't think branches
off in front of people.

2246
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,440
Yeah,

2247
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,273
it's weird.

2248
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:42,731
No,

2249
01:04:42,731 --> 01:04:44,380
it really is interesting.

2250
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:44,590
If,

2251
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:44,891
uh,

2252
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:47,260
if you could track a
comedian writing a bit,

2253
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:50,140
a good comic who really takes
on a premise like you do,

2254
01:04:50,141 --> 01:04:54,820
like take on a thought or a philosophy
and step it out as far as it can possibly

2255
01:04:54,821 --> 01:04:56,070
go and walk,

2256
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,480
track that person doing
that set for six months.

2257
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:03,280
It can morph to where this almost nothing
left from the original premise all the

2258
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:03,850
time.

2259
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:04,180
Yeah.

2260
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:04,421
Yeah.

2261
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:07,360
Sometimes I'll take an old joke
and I'll use it as a scaffolding.

2262
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,050
Like when I'm writing
again and I've got no luck,

2263
01:05:11,051 --> 01:05:12,580
I'm trapped and I'm like,

2264
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,120
[inaudible] no way to
get from this bid to it,

2265
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,280
but not going the old joke.

2266
01:05:15,281 --> 01:05:16,510
I'm a shovel old joke in there.

2267
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,033
And then

2268
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,761
from that,

2269
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:21,040
like the little bursts
that you get out of that,

2270
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:24,280
we'll carry on and make the
s the next premise better.

2271
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:27,700
It's got a little bit more momentum to
it and now you can explore it a little

2272
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:28,630
lightheaded,

2273
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:29,980
a little lighthearted,

2274
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,120
little little easier,

2275
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:33,010
less tense because the new stuff,

2276
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:34,061
think about it.

2277
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:38,710
That fucks me up the most is that I'm not
exactly sure what's the best way to do

2278
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:38,831
it.

2279
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:42,250
So I'm thinking about while I'm saying
it instead of just being in the moment,

2280
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,450
right until I,

2281
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:46,150
until you can just get it to the
point where you can be in the moment,

2282
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,110
it's just clunky,

2283
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,280
but because it's clunky,

2284
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:49,570
you're nervous and because you're nervous,

2285
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,550
you're thinking about it all the time.

2286
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:50,950
Yeah.

2287
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,540
So it becomes like this obsession.

2288
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:55,840
So if I feel like more premises
start popping up that way,

2289
01:05:55,841 --> 01:05:56,320
it's weird.

2290
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:01,320
It's like you have this hyper focus that's
way less comfortable than being like

2291
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:06,250
having an hour and 20 down ready to film.

2292
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:06,760
Yeah,

2293
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,750
it's way less comfortable,

2294
01:06:07,751 --> 01:06:11,800
but it's probably more productive in
terms of like creatively of course,

2295
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,310
but I always,

2296
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:13,091
I always think of like,

2297
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:14,530
it's like learning a new language.

2298
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:15,640
Every time I have a new bit,

2299
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:16,330
it's like,

2300
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:20,080
how do I translate this thought
in my head into like you said,

2301
01:06:20,081 --> 01:06:20,980
what's my approach?

2302
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:23,830
What's my strategy to
get that idea across?

2303
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,860
And so you're thinking about
that and it slows down you.

2304
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:27,131
Yeah.

2305
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:28,360
You're not in the moment as much.

2306
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,270
I think I'm going to start doing
some real late night sets too.

2307
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,530
That's a good idea.

2308
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,450
When you gotta do tired people,

2309
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:34,801
right?

2310
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:36,340
Like 13 people in the room,

2311
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:37,720
you got to try those.

2312
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:42,750
Those little spots out to you can get a
little too used to do and crowds and if

2313
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:45,370
you're a little too used to and crowds,

2314
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:48,370
what happens is people want to laugh.

2315
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,840
They want to laugh.

2316
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,250
The dare to have a good time.

2317
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,320
When you get at one
o'clock in the morning,

2318
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:54,750
they've already laughed.

2319
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:55,260
They,

2320
01:06:55,260 --> 01:07:00,030
they've laughed and laughed and
laughed and they've laughed for hours.

2321
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:00,640
Some of them,

2322
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,090
some of them get there at
nine and they stay till two.

2323
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:04,620
Yeah.

2324
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,120
They just get up to pee or another drink,

2325
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:07,901
have another seat,

2326
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:11,890
and you're watching a crazy lineup of
comedians you get on at one o'clock in the

2327
01:07:11,891 --> 01:07:12,221
morning.

2328
01:07:12,221 --> 01:07:13,780
And I'm like the dawn Barris hour,

2329
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:16,770
that fucking you're,

2330
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:19,510
you're getting in front of
people that have seen everything.

2331
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:24,190
So if you make them laugh
that that's a legit bit.

2332
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:24,970
Yeah.

2333
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:28,870
If you can get through to these people
when they've probably heard everything,

2334
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:33,220
well then it gets you in your voice more
because when there's only 15 people out

2335
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:37,390
there versus 300 couple hours earlier,

2336
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:42,100
at 300 you're performing something
out to the back of the room.

2337
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,260
They talk about playing
to the back of the room.

2338
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:45,130
In bigger rooms,

2339
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:46,930
you have to be more physical,

2340
01:07:46,931 --> 01:07:48,940
you have to slow down and,

2341
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,290
and then when you have 15 people,

2342
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,420
all of a sudden you're
in your human being,

2343
01:07:52,421 --> 01:07:54,040
talking to human beings voice.

2344
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,420
And sometimes that's where you can find
really the flow of the joke a lot better

2345
01:07:58,690 --> 01:07:59,290
because you're not,

2346
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:00,820
you're not pumping it up,

2347
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,390
you're just saying it.

2348
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,550
Yeah,

2349
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:04,383
I agree.

2350
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:08,710
But I think you have to do
those larger places too,

2351
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:11,290
just to know how to do them.

2352
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:14,110
Like there are different thing
you can do a big theater,

2353
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,950
a big theater need to

2354
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,750
be comfortable with the fact that there's,

2355
01:08:17,751 --> 01:08:18,020
you know,

2356
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,900
x amount of thousands of
people in that room and in,

2357
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,430
unless you do a bunch of those,

2358
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,930
like you and I have done
a few of them together.

2359
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:24,200
Yeah,

2360
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:24,790
they're fun.

2361
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:25,160
Yeah.

2362
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,000
But you have a time.

2363
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:27,690
There's a timing thing that's different.

2364
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,740
You have to like wait a little longer.

2365
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:31,360
You can't,

2366
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,370
can't beat your punchlines
like one after the other.

2367
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:37,520
Like you can in a club and
the club you could just keep,

2368
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:40,400
you can keep hammering because there's
only so many people in the room.

2369
01:08:40,401 --> 01:08:42,160
We won't overpower the sound system

2370
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,170
and that's why for so long comedy central,

2371
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,950
the mandate was always they want the
special shot in a nice theater like a,

2372
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:49,731
you know,

2373
01:08:49,731 --> 01:08:53,330
1500 2000 seat or where
they can get that big,

2374
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,240
the crane camera shooting down and,

2375
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:58,910
and the truth is for
most including myself,

2376
01:08:58,911 --> 01:09:00,230
I'm not a theater comic,

2377
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:01,080
I'm a club comic.

2378
01:09:01,081 --> 01:09:06,020
So all of a sudden I shoot my special
in a room that holds 1600 people and it

2379
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:06,681
was in,

2380
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:09,890
I don't look back at it and go
that's exactly how I want it to be.

2381
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:10,910
Sane.

2382
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:12,230
I was slower,

2383
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:12,900
I was,

2384
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:16,700
I was bigger and it's like I would have
rather done it in a like a nice little

2385
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:17,840
400 seat club

2386
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:18,501
also.

2387
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:21,290
You weren't doing a lot of those places
so we weren't comfortable with it.

2388
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,120
Like when you do those really big places,

2389
01:09:23,121 --> 01:09:24,290
once you get comfortable with it,

2390
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:25,580
you start treating and liquor club.

2391
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,180
Yeah,

2392
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:30,260
like one of my most comfortable sets was
one of the biggest places ever did the

2393
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:31,920
Scotia Bank arena in,

2394
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:33,710
in Toronto at the end of my tour.

2395
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,150
But is at the end of the tour.

2396
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:38,210
The very last spot before
the Netflix special came out.

2397
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,560
So I had,

2398
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:44,870
I'd been doing stand up like real
regular in these big giant ass places for

2399
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:45,860
months.

2400
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:49,760
So when I got there it felt like the
store felt like doing the main room.

2401
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:51,080
It was just a bigger main room.

2402
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:51,740
Right.

2403
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:51,951
You know,

2404
01:09:51,951 --> 01:09:52,400
you just,

2405
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,233
it was just fun.

2406
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,110
Just have a good time.

2407
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:54,830
Yeah,

2408
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,570
it's just doing a lot of those.

2409
01:09:56,571 --> 01:10:00,230
You got to do 'em but you really do
have to do the little tiny shitty ones.

2410
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:02,090
You've got to do those 1:00 AM spots.

2411
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,950
You've got to do those belly rooms spots.

2412
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:04,430
Yeah.

2413
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,180
That's a big one.

2414
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,230
The peli rooms a big one.

2415
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,450
That's him right there.

2416
01:10:07,451 --> 01:10:07,961
It is.

2417
01:10:07,961 --> 01:10:10,330
If you are not connected to them,

2418
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:12,910
they do not laugh and a few are connected.

2419
01:10:12,911 --> 01:10:15,640
It's the greatest crowd
because there's only what,

2420
01:10:15,641 --> 01:10:16,710
60 people in there,

2421
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,340
huh?

2422
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,530
Oh something like that.

2423
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,460
I also like doing alternative room.

2424
01:10:20,461 --> 01:10:21,770
Sometimes I go to Largo,

2425
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:24,710
go up there in front of
the cool kids and you know,

2426
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:26,480
have to be a little more PC and

2427
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:30,770
you should have a fake act
that you do only for Largo,

2428
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,330
like put together.

2429
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:35,000
Actually I did Largo with a Whitney a lot.

2430
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:38,090
I like Largo Hardwick
was on that show too.

2431
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:38,540
And um,

2432
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:39,080
someone else,

2433
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:39,913
maybe Adam Ray.

2434
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:41,210
No,

2435
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,780
Adam Devine and um,

2436
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:43,641
and uh,

2437
01:10:43,641 --> 01:10:45,170
it was a fun time and it was really fun.

2438
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,510
Largo is a really
interesting old place too,

2439
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,560
but all those,

2440
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,120
those are all seen things like
I would love if somebody did,

2441
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:56,360
they put an act together that's
only for like that crowd,

2442
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:59,900
but it's like just onion ask
enough that it sneaks through,

2443
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:01,813
you know?

2444
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,480
Yeah,

2445
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:02,781
right.

2446
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:07,781
Just a really like a guy who plays
like the strongest ally possible for

2447
01:11:09,621 --> 01:11:10,454
everything,

2448
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,230
for Trans Rights,

2449
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:13,920
gay rights rights,

2450
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:14,370
women's

2451
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,203
rights.

2452
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:18,450
It's like the ultimate ally or norm,

2453
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:21,580
everything Birkenstock,

2454
01:11:21,581 --> 01:11:21,841
whatever.

2455
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:26,841
We can do whatever we do to make them
a character and then write really good

2456
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:28,080
jokes.

2457
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:28,460
Right,

2458
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:28,711
right.

2459
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:29,431
Really good.

2460
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:31,080
Jokes like that would be
an interesting approach.

2461
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:33,030
Almost like a Borat type project.

2462
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,540
Like create an all comic who's like,

2463
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,160
who's really calculated,

2464
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,170
who's really probably
just trying to get pussy.

2465
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:40,541
Right.

2466
01:11:40,541 --> 01:11:40,770
But,

2467
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:41,603
but,

2468
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:43,710
but puts together the right words,

2469
01:11:43,711 --> 01:11:44,011
you know,

2470
01:11:44,011 --> 01:11:46,710
if you don't support intersectionality,

2471
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,160
then get the fuck out of my face.

2472
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,163
Yeah.

2473
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:55,230
And then he should try to get laid after
every show as part of the care course.

2474
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:55,441
Yeah.

2475
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:57,990
It'd be just super sleazy
with coke and needles.

2476
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,860
Fucking syringes evil today

2477
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:04,950
he's got shaky bottles of bills.

2478
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:08,550
It takes the pussy hat off his head
and starts fucking it backstage.

2479
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:11,160
He's got a flashlight for a pussyhat.

2480
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:12,570
Oh my God.

2481
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:14,840
There'll be a hilarious character.

2482
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,130
The thing

2483
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:19,100
about people is who are you really?

2484
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,190
And when you're like,

2485
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,390
when you're talking to people,

2486
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:24,620
do you know who you are?

2487
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,040
Do you,

2488
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,450
you sure you know who you are?

2489
01:12:26,451 --> 01:12:26,661
Like,

2490
01:12:26,661 --> 01:12:29,870
are you 100% certain and cool and calm?

2491
01:12:29,871 --> 01:12:30,950
I don't think most of us are.

2492
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:36,160
Like most of us are like constantly
evolving the way we behave in think,

2493
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:37,580
constantly thinking about it.

2494
01:12:37,581 --> 01:12:39,260
Maybe things went wrong last night.

2495
01:12:39,261 --> 01:12:40,130
I got to stop drinking.

2496
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,720
There's always like something like,

2497
01:12:41,721 --> 01:12:41,890
oh,

2498
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,010
I gotta get my ass to the gym.

2499
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:43,731
There's always something.

2500
01:12:43,731 --> 01:12:45,650
There's always something you're
trying to improve and move around.

2501
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:49,610
So if you are a person who is,

2502
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:50,541
you know,

2503
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:55,541
if you don't know exactly where you're
coming from but you want to sell that,

2504
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:57,200
you know where you're coming from.

2505
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,570
He wanted people to believe you
know where you're coming from,

2506
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,230
then you,

2507
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:05,230
then you get all this momentum behind you
and you almost can't get away from it.

2508
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:06,981
You know,

2509
01:13:06,981 --> 01:13:07,814
like you're,

2510
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,751
you're like,

2511
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:09,111
you're like,

2512
01:13:09,111 --> 01:13:11,420
you see this a lot with people
that are trying to be spiritual

2513
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:16,160
or they're always trying to sell you
on the idea that they're spiritual.

2514
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,210
They're always pushing.

2515
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:18,140
There's,

2516
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:18,801
this is me,

2517
01:13:18,801 --> 01:13:19,220
man,

2518
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:19,790
this is me.

2519
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:20,623
Are you sure?

2520
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:21,770
Are you sure?

2521
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,420
I can think who we are.

2522
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,470
All of us is,

2523
01:13:24,471 --> 01:13:29,270
a lot of it is like who we've encountered
and how we've interacted with those

2524
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,104
people.

2525
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:31,051
Yeah.

2526
01:13:31,051 --> 01:13:33,000
And then the uniform comes along with it.

2527
01:13:33,001 --> 01:13:33,800
And the Diet,

2528
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,720
there's like a whole
follow this manual that,

2529
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:37,020
you know,

2530
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,040
they talk about hipsters,

2531
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:38,820
which,

2532
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,653
you know,

2533
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,030
it's a pretty wide umbrella.

2534
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:43,710
About what kind of hipsters there are,

2535
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:48,711
but just the idea of wearing a uniform
always kind of puts me off on people like

2536
01:13:48,781 --> 01:13:49,614
you stopped,

2537
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:53,340
you stopped growing if you're going to
put on what all the other people that you

2538
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:54,480
want to be like are wearing.

2539
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:54,921
Yeah.

2540
01:13:54,921 --> 01:13:55,760
This is the thing.

2541
01:13:55,761 --> 01:14:00,761
It's like the opinions aren't necessarily
wrong because they're your opinions,

2542
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,520
but the thing of the,

2543
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,340
the thing of any kind of ideology,

2544
01:14:04,341 --> 01:14:09,140
whether it's a hipster all ideology
or if it's a fucking conservative,

2545
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:12,010
right wing farm worker ideology.

2546
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:13,810
Like when people adopt those,

2547
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,590
it's very little deviation and a lot
of times an not even really thinking

2548
01:14:17,591 --> 01:14:18,940
entirely about what they're saying.

2549
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,360
They just,

2550
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,240
they just know what is going to get the
right positive reaction from their clan.

2551
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:24,851
Yeah,

2552
01:14:24,851 --> 01:14:25,361
I feel bad.

2553
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:25,961
My Mom,

2554
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:26,650
who is,

2555
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:26,921
you know,

2556
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,440
we grew up pretty liberal
family in New York.

2557
01:14:29,441 --> 01:14:33,280
My Dad was in radio and he talked politics
on the air and it was pretty far left

2558
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:34,901
reading that,

2559
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:35,171
you know,

2560
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:36,970
my mom worked at the New York Times,

2561
01:14:36,971 --> 01:14:38,320
he can't get any more liberal in that.

2562
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:43,321
And so then she moved down to Florida
where everybody watches Fox News in her

2563
01:14:44,441 --> 01:14:48,280
building and they all sit around the
pool and they fucking berate her because

2564
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:49,270
they don't agree with them.

2565
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:50,141
And I just say,

2566
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:50,951
good for you mom.

2567
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:51,640
You haven't,

2568
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,170
cause a lot of people go
down there and they were,

2569
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,510
they changed their views
because they are so,

2570
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:56,141
you know,

2571
01:14:56,141 --> 01:14:58,300
intimidated by not fitting in with the,

2572
01:14:58,450 --> 01:14:59,980
it's your social group.

2573
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:00,940
It's a different country.

2574
01:15:00,941 --> 01:15:03,640
Florida's different kinds
of saying American Europe.

2575
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:05,120
Right.

2576
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,350
And that you go to Florida
does a different country.

2577
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:08,111
Yeah it is.

2578
01:15:08,111 --> 01:15:08,560
And it's,

2579
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,350
it's two different countries
because if not three,

2580
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:13,360
because you've got the locals,

2581
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:18,010
which I'd put them against Mississippi
and Alabama for being deep south.

2582
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,620
And then you've got the retirement people,

2583
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:24,940
which is old Jews from New York and then
you've got the Latino Element Florida.

2584
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:26,170
It's V it's three different,

2585
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,820
a lot of old Italians
from New York to Oh yeah,

2586
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:29,211
that's right.

2587
01:15:29,211 --> 01:15:33,010
All those people just as at
fault this winter we get Nadie.

2588
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:33,351
Yeah.

2589
01:15:33,351 --> 01:15:33,911
What do we do?

2590
01:15:33,911 --> 01:15:35,180
Talk and get in the boat

2591
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:39,600
down as hard as you fucking cunt.

2592
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,540
Get some good Italian food in Florida.

2593
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:43,460
Oh yeah.

2594
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,300
Got some good food.

2595
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:44,841
But yeah,

2596
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:45,321
you're right.

2597
01:15:45,321 --> 01:15:46,340
The upper part of it,

2598
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:46,941
especially,

2599
01:15:46,941 --> 01:15:48,710
that's like all that mean,

2600
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:50,630
might as well be any other southern state.

2601
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:51,090
Right,

2602
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:51,470
right.

2603
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:53,570
And then at the bottom it's Cubans.

2604
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:53,850
Yeah,

2605
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:54,681
no running shit.

2606
01:15:54,681 --> 01:15:55,514
And Miami.

2607
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,870
Miami's just international.

2608
01:15:56,871 --> 01:15:58,520
Miami is like an international city.

2609
01:15:58,521 --> 01:16:00,890
It's like an international
city that's in America.

2610
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:01,641
That'd be that.

2611
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:03,500
It's so different than Seattle.

2612
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:06,380
Like in terms of feel and like
the way you're walking around,

2613
01:16:06,381 --> 01:16:09,560
everybody's like thin and in
tight clothes and you know,

2614
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:13,400
people are partying and fucking
dancing and music's coming out of cars.

2615
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:13,581
Like,

2616
01:16:13,581 --> 01:16:14,000
Whoa,

2617
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,390
hey,

2618
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:15,223
spaces alive.

2619
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,061
Yeah.

2620
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:19,650
It's alive and it's going to be
underwater soon when they get a suit.

2621
01:16:19,651 --> 01:16:22,150
And when the moon is in
certain positions in Florida,

2622
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,950
it doesn't even matter what tide is.

2623
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:24,510
The fucking,

2624
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:24,950
if it,

2625
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:27,610
if there's a high tide and no storm,

2626
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:30,670
they still streets still flood in Miami.

2627
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:31,840
It's getting bad.

2628
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:32,980
Is that real?

2629
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:33,813
Yeah.

2630
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:35,480
Well,

2631
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,290
here's what they gotta do.

2632
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:38,390
They're gotta dig under the
city and then lift it up.

2633
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:38,540
Yeah,

2634
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,373
that's right.

2635
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,210
Just go all the way under Ilan mosque.

2636
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:46,160
Use that on machine thing and you want
to put some giant metal bars and just

2637
01:16:46,161 --> 01:16:47,300
jack it up to chick,

2638
01:16:47,301 --> 01:16:47,511
chick,

2639
01:16:47,511 --> 01:16:47,830
chick,

2640
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:48,220
check,

2641
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:49,053
check.

2642
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,240
He got the Italian down there.

2643
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:53,200
They do construction,

2644
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,610
but what if they do in New Orleans
deal where they put up a levee?

2645
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,271
Yeah.

2646
01:16:57,271 --> 01:16:58,380
That's what they're going to need to do.

2647
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,400
Jesus Christ.

2648
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,770
I think the problem with that though,

2649
01:17:01,771 --> 01:17:06,600
what I read was that there's something
about the porous nature of the soil in

2650
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:08,820
Miami that the waters are
going to come to the ground.

2651
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:09,260
Yeah.

2652
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,620
The ground under the cities of
south Florida's larceny for the IRD,

2653
01:17:11,621 --> 01:17:12,980
it's largely poorest live.

2654
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:13,873
Jamie's on the ball,

2655
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,800
largely porous limestone,

2656
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:18,740
which means water will
eventually rise up through it,

2657
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:20,443
so they're fucked.

2658
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,440
They're fucked no matter what.

2659
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:22,790
Even with a levy there fucked that.

2660
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:24,950
Water's just going to get
through the ground right up.

2661
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:28,610
You know how like you're on the beach
and you could dig a hole in the sand and

2662
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:29,600
eventually you hit water.

2663
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:30,463
Yeah.

2664
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:31,940
That always freaked me out.

2665
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,331
Yeah,

2666
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:33,050
I know.

2667
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:33,883
I now

2668
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:36,201
wait a minute.

2669
01:17:36,201 --> 01:17:37,280
This water under here.

2670
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:38,150
How much water?

2671
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:38,460
However,

2672
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,590
my kid was sitting in one
of those holes and I'm like,

2673
01:17:40,591 --> 01:17:42,540
you're going to get
fucking sucked underground.

2674
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:42,761
Yeah.

2675
01:17:42,761 --> 01:17:43,594
I didn't like it.

2676
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:44,620
I didn't like it.

2677
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,453
Yeah.

2678
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:45,851
I was,

2679
01:17:45,851 --> 01:17:46,060
uh,

2680
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,940
listening to a radio lab
podcast on quicksand.

2681
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:52,570
It was really cool podcasts
because it made me think I went,

2682
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:53,560
oh yeah.

2683
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,990
Nobody worries about quicksand anymore.

2684
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,820
Is that a real thing when we exact kids,

2685
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:58,271
dude?

2686
01:17:58,271 --> 01:17:58,441
Yeah.

2687
01:17:58,441 --> 01:17:58,630
Yeah.

2688
01:17:58,630 --> 01:17:59,620
Quicksand is a real thing.

2689
01:17:59,640 --> 01:17:59,950
Yeah.

2690
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:00,250
Yeah.

2691
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:00,910
It's a real thing.

2692
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:03,100
You can fall into this soupy,

2693
01:18:03,101 --> 01:18:04,540
watery sandy shit,

2694
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,670
and if you don't try to swim out of it,

2695
01:18:06,671 --> 01:18:07,780
you try to walk out of it.

2696
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:08,763
You could drown.

2697
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:09,100
Yeah.

2698
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:09,933
You could die in there.

2699
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,940
People have definitely died and you
might not even get out if you try to swim

2700
01:18:12,941 --> 01:18:13,360
out,

2701
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,560
but that's how you handle it.

2702
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:18,700
You handle it the same way you handle
water and if you try walking through it,

2703
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:19,150
yeah.

2704
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:20,900
Like people just get
sucked into the Merck.

2705
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:21,341
I mean,

2706
01:18:21,341 --> 01:18:21,461
if you,

2707
01:18:21,461 --> 01:18:21,940
if you,

2708
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:22,541
if you think about it,

2709
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:25,990
there's like a certain amount of
density to what you need to stand on.

2710
01:18:25,991 --> 01:18:26,261
Right.

2711
01:18:26,261 --> 01:18:27,220
That's why mud,

2712
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,061
it's not hard.

2713
01:18:28,061 --> 01:18:28,820
You use,

2714
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:30,910
you just go in there and
you can get really stuck.

2715
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:31,570
Right.

2716
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,670
Well if it's more watery than that,

2717
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,750
then what happens?

2718
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:37,430
Well then you can't even stand then you

2719
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:40,203
people just panicked.

2720
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:41,140
Wow.

2721
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:41,920
Yeah.

2722
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,753
You've got to swim.

2723
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,593
Yeah.

2724
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,433
If you can,

2725
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,790
because there's all
this weight on you too.

2726
01:18:45,791 --> 01:18:47,530
You have to realize
that that stuff's dense.

2727
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,581
So it's watery,

2728
01:18:48,581 --> 01:18:51,430
but it's also heavy and then
your clothes are covered in it,

2729
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,530
so your clothes become really heavy

2730
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:55,920
and so nobody can save you
because if they get close,

2731
01:18:55,921 --> 01:18:56,754
they're going to fall in.

2732
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,593
Yes.

2733
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,070
Yeah.

2734
01:18:58,070 --> 01:18:58,430
If,

2735
01:18:58,430 --> 01:18:58,921
if they,

2736
01:18:58,921 --> 01:18:59,370
you know,

2737
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:00,660
if you're going to drag them down,

2738
01:19:00,661 --> 01:19:01,210
man,

2739
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:01,401
they,

2740
01:19:01,401 --> 01:19:02,670
it's hard to swim with somebody.

2741
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:04,320
You know that as well as anybody.

2742
01:19:04,321 --> 01:19:05,190
You saved somebody.

2743
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:06,500
Yeah,

2744
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,450
I was in Costa Rica and uh,

2745
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,700
we were down at this Ga,

2746
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:10,401
this water,

2747
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:11,930
it was the biggest
waterfall I've ever seen.

2748
01:19:11,931 --> 01:19:15,590
It was like hundreds of feet high
and Atlanta did in this lagoon,

2749
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,840
this round lagoon and the water,

2750
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,790
they told you don't go near the water.

2751
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,730
And so there's these Japanese
girls sitting on the edge.

2752
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:27,500
They got their feet in and then one of
them like jumps in and the water fucking

2753
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:29,690
sucks her down immediately.

2754
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,140
And I dove out.

2755
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:31,701
I have,

2756
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:35,270
I have a lifeguarding to Greg
from when I was stoned and 16.

2757
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:39,680
And so I dove into the water and I grabbed
her and luckily I was checking them

2758
01:19:39,681 --> 01:19:41,300
out because they were
these beautiful Japanese.

2759
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,250
So I had my eyes on them.

2760
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,091
And uh,

2761
01:19:44,091 --> 01:19:45,530
so I dive in and I grabbed,

2762
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,810
I grabbed her and I
pulled it to the surface.

2763
01:19:47,811 --> 01:19:50,420
I do the cross arm carry and
I've pulled our polar out.

2764
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:51,880
And you know what she did well,

2765
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:52,783
just turned,

2766
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:53,690
turned to her friends.

2767
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:54,950
They all like console there.

2768
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,120
Nobody said thank you,

2769
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,320
I fucking saved her life.

2770
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,040
So anyway.

2771
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:58,790
Wow.

2772
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:00,170
So there was these kids and the three,

2773
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:01,340
you are jumping these lady.

2774
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:02,323
How rude.

2775
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,251
How bad.

2776
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:06,260
A little shoddy got tall Japanese,

2777
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:06,960
Japanese,

2778
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,070
I think she was Japanese.

2779
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:08,260
No,

2780
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:08,430
no,

2781
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,151
they were Japanese.

2782
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:09,670
Japanese,

2783
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:10,080
yeah.

2784
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,850
She probably thought you were a lifeguard.

2785
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:12,510
Yeah.

2786
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:13,530
Probably thought that's what happened.

2787
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:13,980
Yeah.

2788
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:14,431
And then I,

2789
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:16,770
and then I left and
I'm with my family and,

2790
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:17,010
uh,

2791
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:18,090
they didn't see it happen,

2792
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,190
so I was so fucking bummed.

2793
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:22,050
Then we get to the parking lot and,

2794
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:22,110
uh,

2795
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:26,400
there's this busload of kids from some
school and they had seen the whole thing

2796
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:28,980
and they started chanting hero to me.

2797
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:29,451
Oh.

2798
01:20:29,451 --> 01:20:30,410
And I said to my kids,

2799
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:32,270
do you fucking see what's
happening right now?

2800
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:36,190
That's,

2801
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:37,430
that's gotta be a great feeling.

2802
01:20:37,431 --> 01:20:39,020
Even if they didn't say thank you,

2803
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:39,830
saved him.

2804
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,220
I like,

2805
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,031
it's what I do.

2806
01:20:41,031 --> 01:20:42,740
It's my job superhero.

2807
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,630
You ever save anybody's life?

2808
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:45,470
No,

2809
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:46,303
I don't think so.

2810
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:47,931
Not,

2811
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:48,764
not directly.

2812
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:49,470
Hmm.

2813
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,790
Maybe you did this podcast.

2814
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:51,624
Probably did.

2815
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:54,660
I bet this people that have been suicidal
that heard this and the cheer them up

2816
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,970
ruined a few people too.

2817
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:57,823
Let's be honest.

2818
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,340
You don't listen to me.

2819
01:21:04,341 --> 01:21:05,174
I'm a fucking idiot.

2820
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:06,710
What are you listening to me?

2821
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,780
Because if people say
I changed their life,

2822
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:12,230
I was like,

2823
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:12,620
okay,

2824
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:14,810
if I accept it on the positive,

2825
01:21:14,811 --> 01:21:16,370
then I have to accept
it on the negative too.

2826
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:16,970
That's right.

2827
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:17,121
No,

2828
01:21:17,121 --> 01:21:17,271
no.

2829
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:17,960
You did it.

2830
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:18,890
You did the whole thing.

2831
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:19,310
Yeah.

2832
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:21,950
You might've heard I said
some shit that you enjoyed.

2833
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:25,970
I'm very happy for that and I talked to
some people that brought you some great

2834
01:21:25,971 --> 01:21:26,511
information.

2835
01:21:26,511 --> 01:21:27,680
I'm very happy for that too.

2836
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:28,850
We're all in this together.

2837
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,010
I'm not saving anybody.

2838
01:21:30,011 --> 01:21:30,350
Yeah.

2839
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:30,620
Yeah.

2840
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,453
Save yourself.

2841
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:33,110
Don't listen to me.

2842
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:33,670
Yeah,

2843
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:34,481
call a hotline.

2844
01:21:34,481 --> 01:21:34,800
Yeah.

2845
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,340
Listen and me,

2846
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:36,000
don't take yoga.

2847
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,660
Don't even do it.

2848
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:37,493
Don't take it.

2849
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:38,850
Don't listen to me.

2850
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:39,960
I don't what the fuck I'm talking about.

2851
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:40,980
Don't pick up archery.

2852
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:41,801
What the fuck do you want to do?

2853
01:21:41,801 --> 01:21:42,900
You want to shoot arrows at things?

2854
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:43,710
Get the fuck out of here.

2855
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:44,250
Carbs.

2856
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,240
Eat some fucking carbs.

2857
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:46,290
Don't do Jujitsu.

2858
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,090
You're going to get hurt.

2859
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:47,923
You don't want to get hurt.

2860
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:50,220
You're a 40 year old man.

2861
01:21:50,221 --> 01:21:51,870
We trying to choke people for stop it.

2862
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:53,003
Don't listen to me.

2863
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:53,251
Yeah,

2864
01:21:53,251 --> 01:21:54,060
don't eat elk.

2865
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,110
Go Get a burger.

2866
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:57,240
But we had an actual American hamburger.

2867
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,290
Don't eat mushrooms.

2868
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:58,960
Get outta here.

2869
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,120
Just close your mind off.

2870
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,013
Break your head.

2871
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:02,011
They're going to break your head.

2872
01:22:02,011 --> 01:22:02,850
What did you go crazy like?

2873
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:03,810
That guy from pink Floyd.

2874
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:06,210
What if you go crazy?

2875
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,680
What if you never come back?

2876
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,280
But if you get antisemetic cause a judo,

2877
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:13,531
but the thing is,

2878
01:22:13,531 --> 01:22:17,910
what if you do like for sure some people
have smoked too much pot and blown a

2879
01:22:17,911 --> 01:22:18,780
fucking gasket,

2880
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:20,010
let's be honest.

2881
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,060
Right.

2882
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:21,890
It has to have happen.

2883
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:24,200
They say that actually they're finding,

2884
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:26,030
my wife just told me this yesterday,

2885
01:22:26,031 --> 01:22:30,410
she read this article about people with
schizophrenia are getting older and

2886
01:22:30,411 --> 01:22:33,770
they're smoking pot more
because it's legal and uh,

2887
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:38,830
they're finding people are coming in with
a schizophrenia episodes from smoking

2888
01:22:39,531 --> 01:22:40,320
too much pot

2889
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,520
that worst gets a phrenic or ready
or became schizophrenia from the pot.

2890
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:45,563
Not sure.

2891
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:46,920
I think when you,

2892
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,540
especially when you get too high,

2893
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:50,790
it feels exactly like being crazy.

2894
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:51,600
Yeah.

2895
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,190
And I think when,

2896
01:22:53,191 --> 01:22:53,650
uh,

2897
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:58,410
there's been moments for sure that I
smoked too much pot and I freaked the fuck

2898
01:22:58,411 --> 01:22:59,130
out.

2899
01:22:59,130 --> 01:22:59,521
And,

2900
01:22:59,521 --> 01:22:59,670
uh,

2901
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:01,470
when that happens,

2902
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:03,870
it almost always feels like,

2903
01:23:03,871 --> 01:23:04,171
wow,

2904
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:05,950
if I had to live life like this,

2905
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,500
and it's one of the things that I
tried to take any consideration when I,

2906
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:12,250
when I think about people having
something wrong with the way their brain

2907
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:17,251
processes information or the way they
talk is like thinking about how you feel

2908
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:21,370
when you're on like a 200
milligram edible and you're like,

2909
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:21,791
oh my God,

2910
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:22,630
I just can't do this.

2911
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:23,411
This is just too much.

2912
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:27,730
Everything is anxiety and the freak
out and life and death and all of your

2913
01:23:27,731 --> 01:23:31,620
memories pouring back into your head
like a waterfall and you can't call them

2914
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:32,290
circles.

2915
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:37,290
They're spinning plates and all
you want is for it to end please.

2916
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:38,940
And a lie down here.

2917
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,540
I hear when you take a shower,

2918
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:42,310
it helps you get in the shower.

2919
01:23:42,311 --> 01:23:43,144
You're still freaked out.

2920
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:48,070
If that was your whole life
and you got to think what is,

2921
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:48,430
uh,

2922
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:51,310
what's your state of consciousness
versus another person's?

2923
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:52,240
You have to guess.

2924
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:53,170
I don't,

2925
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:54,730
I've never been in your mind.

2926
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:56,290
I don't know how your mind works.

2927
01:23:56,291 --> 01:24:00,370
I have to guess that your
mind is some reasonable,

2928
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,820
it's got something like
the way my mind works,

2929
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:06,160
the way you look at life and
we talk about so many things.

2930
01:24:06,161 --> 01:24:07,510
We agree on so many things.

2931
01:24:07,511 --> 01:24:09,520
I've got to think you're
processing is very similar to mine,

2932
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,630
but there's gotta be people out there
where it's chaos where it's just like you

2933
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:14,830
would the 200 milligram edible.

2934
01:24:14,831 --> 01:24:16,660
You're just like fuck all day.

2935
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:17,494
It's just so like what,

2936
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,550
who's who's doing that?

2937
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:19,121
You know,

2938
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:19,691
people do.

2939
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:22,750
Just people watching the man from the
is a building near us and just people

2940
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:23,584
watching me like,

2941
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:24,790
and they can't escape,

2942
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:26,020
can escape the Kennys can't,

2943
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:31,060
they're trapped in this is fucking
constant snow ball effect of anxiety and

2944
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,001
chaos.

2945
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:34,600
And,

2946
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,920
and you've got a wondered like what,

2947
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,960
how much of that is brain chemistry?

2948
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:42,460
How much of that is brain chemistry
that's been adjusted by nature and by life

2949
01:24:42,461 --> 01:24:46,210
experiences and abuse and
all these different factors
that happen to people that

2950
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:48,700
make them lose their grip.

2951
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:49,673
All right.

2952
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:50,090
So,

2953
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:50,390
yeah,

2954
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:50,691
I mean,

2955
01:24:50,691 --> 01:24:52,310
you see them on the street and he just,

2956
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:52,761
you know,

2957
01:24:52,761 --> 01:24:54,950
there's a woman that is near my house.

2958
01:24:54,951 --> 01:24:59,951
She's at a bus stop and she's been at
this bus stop for three years and I have

2959
01:25:00,501 --> 01:25:01,011
never,

2960
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:03,530
and I pass her two or three
times a day and I check,

2961
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:06,950
I'm kind of obsessed with checking
on her every time I drive by.

2962
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:08,293
And uh,

2963
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,770
she's never not been in
that bus stop sitting down.

2964
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:16,580
She's either reading or
just under a blanket.

2965
01:25:16,581 --> 01:25:17,660
She's chain smokes.

2966
01:25:17,661 --> 01:25:19,190
I don't know where she gets a cigarettes.

2967
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,240
She's got a cell phone.

2968
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:21,680
Don't know how she charges it,

2969
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,680
but I guess she goes to the
bathroom at the gas station maybe.

2970
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,200
Maybe people give her money and she goes,

2971
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:27,320
doesn't beg,

2972
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:28,250
doesn't engage,

2973
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:29,120
just sits at this.

2974
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:29,980
And it's a,

2975
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:30,440
there's a,

2976
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:33,080
she's in front of a gas
station and a busy road.

2977
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:33,950
It's,

2978
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:36,500
it's the worst spot to say pouring rain.

2979
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:38,940
She's out there cold winter.

2980
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:39,980
She's out there.

2981
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:41,210
It's crazy.

2982
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,233
Wow.

2983
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:45,180
Does the bus stop?

2984
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:46,014
Have a cover?

2985
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:47,123
Yeah,

2986
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:48,090
but not,

2987
01:25:48,091 --> 01:25:48,601
not like,

2988
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:49,160
uh,

2989
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,550
the sides are not there.

2990
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:51,170
Oh,

2991
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:52,320
so on driving rain,

2992
01:25:52,321 --> 01:25:52,561
it's,

2993
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:53,040
you know,

2994
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:53,581
so she's just,

2995
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:54,390
she's soaked.

2996
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,223
Yeah.

2997
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,680
And you see her talking to
herself a little bit and
you just think Jesus Christ.

2998
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:00,360
And so I looked her up online,

2999
01:26:00,361 --> 01:26:03,270
I researched her and it
turns out she's from Venice.

3000
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:06,550
She went to Venice high and she's got a,

3001
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,470
she's got parents in the neighborhood
and they know she's there.

3002
01:26:09,471 --> 01:26:10,670
They can't get her to leave.

3003
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:14,780
Social workers come by and they
just realized she's happy there.

3004
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:15,051
You know,

3005
01:26:15,051 --> 01:26:16,880
we're not happy but she's safe there.

3006
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:21,170
Something about that spot maybe cause
it's like the busiest spot round.

3007
01:26:21,171 --> 01:26:22,430
It makes her feel safe.

3008
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,330
Wow.

3009
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:24,163
Yeah.

3010
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,320
Imagine that your kid,

3011
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,740
I know.

3012
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:30,743
Yeah.

3013
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:35,150
As you kid blows a gasket and you
got to let go at a certain point.

3014
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,103
Fuck.

3015
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:39,690
You can't make them take their medication
after the age of 18 and for some

3016
01:26:39,691 --> 01:26:43,110
reason a lot of schizophrenia don't like
taking their medication because of the

3017
01:26:43,111 --> 01:26:44,010
way it makes them feel.

3018
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,800
God it man.

3019
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:47,260
Okay.

3020
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,370
What are the other options?

3021
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:52,180
My think lithium is the main drug and
then there's a couple other ones that

3022
01:26:52,181 --> 01:26:52,750
work.

3023
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:57,180
Is there any behavioral
therapy or physical therapy?

3024
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:57,611
Oh yeah,

3025
01:26:57,611 --> 01:26:58,390
definitely.

3026
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:59,080
Yeah.

3027
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,940
I think it's about replacing thoughts.

3028
01:27:00,941 --> 01:27:02,590
It's cognitive behavioral therapy.

3029
01:27:02,591 --> 01:27:03,041
They have to,

3030
01:27:03,041 --> 01:27:04,600
when they start thinking something,

3031
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:08,200
they have to replace it with another
thought and they have to train in that

3032
01:27:08,201 --> 01:27:09,430
until they can stop

3033
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:10,790
the the voices.

3034
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:11,130
But I,

3035
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:13,460
but I think it's mostly medication.

3036
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:14,563
Yeah.

3037
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:20,120
I think we have an aversion to treating
the brain the same way we treat other

3038
01:27:20,121 --> 01:27:21,170
things that get broken.

3039
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:21,770
Yeah,

3040
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:22,580
like a,

3041
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:22,911
you know,

3042
01:27:22,911 --> 01:27:23,744
a few,

3043
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,150
you have something wrong with your liver.

3044
01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:26,970
They,

3045
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:27,380
they go,

3046
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:27,651
Oh,

3047
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:28,850
you've got liver disease.

3048
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:31,040
Well we're going to give you
medication for the liver.

3049
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,420
Or there's something
wrong with your brain.

3050
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:32,601
Like,

3051
01:27:32,601 --> 01:27:33,434
are you sure?

3052
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:34,581
You sure the sun,

3053
01:27:34,581 --> 01:27:35,414
right brain,

3054
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:36,530
you know what's wrong,

3055
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:37,430
right?

3056
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,860
Like your brain's really not
producing enough chemicals.

3057
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:40,694
Is that it?

3058
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:42,980
Or is it just the way you look at things?

3059
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:43,130
No,

3060
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,240
they look at it as a weakness.

3061
01:27:44,241 --> 01:27:44,660
Yeah.

3062
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:45,021
That's all.

3063
01:27:45,021 --> 01:27:45,890
This is a weakness.

3064
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,753
Yeah.

3065
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:47,930
That's a weird thing.

3066
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:50,090
It's a weird thing
because sometimes it is,

3067
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:52,010
sometimes people are weak,

3068
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:54,260
but sometimes that's not it.

3069
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,940
Sometimes there's something wrong.

3070
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,510
And so if you are a person who's got
something wrong and people were telling

3071
01:27:59,520 --> 01:27:59,611
you,

3072
01:27:59,611 --> 01:28:00,444
you just week,

3073
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:01,460
they're like,

3074
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:01,601
no,

3075
01:28:01,601 --> 01:28:01,820
no,

3076
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,140
this is fucked up.

3077
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,430
Like this is this,

3078
01:28:04,431 --> 01:28:07,970
this is a terrible feeling and
this is everyday for me all day.

3079
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:08,360
Yeah.

3080
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,920
There's just something
wrong going on in there.

3081
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:14,030
Like it has to be that there's
variables to the way your brain works.

3082
01:28:14,031 --> 01:28:14,570
Just why,

3083
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:18,590
like there's variables to the way your
eyes function or any other part of your

3084
01:28:18,591 --> 01:28:19,120
body.

3085
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:19,490
This is very,

3086
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:19,631
I mean,

3087
01:28:19,631 --> 01:28:20,270
it just,

3088
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:21,320
it's not equal.

3089
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,880
Everybody doesn't get the same dose.

3090
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:23,251
Right.

3091
01:28:23,251 --> 01:28:23,461
I mean,

3092
01:28:23,461 --> 01:28:25,590
depression is something that,

3093
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:28,320
it's funny because I think I've asked
you and you don't have depression.

3094
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,010
And My,

3095
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:29,430
my,

3096
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,750
my buddy Mike Gibbons,

3097
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:34,770
he's my best friend and we connect
like you and me on everything.

3098
01:28:34,771 --> 01:28:37,620
But I have so much
fucking depression that I,

3099
01:28:37,621 --> 01:28:38,850
I deal with it every day.

3100
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:39,450
Yeah.

3101
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:39,751
You know,

3102
01:28:39,751 --> 01:28:40,291
and I can't,

3103
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:41,340
I have to meditate.

3104
01:28:41,341 --> 01:28:42,510
I got an exercise.

3105
01:28:42,511 --> 01:28:43,230
I,

3106
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:43,590
I'm,

3107
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:44,423
you know,

3108
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:46,930
medicate everything.

3109
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,071
Do you,

3110
01:28:48,071 --> 01:28:48,580
um,

3111
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:48,941
what the,

3112
01:28:48,941 --> 01:28:49,240
well,

3113
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,350
while you're injured right now,

3114
01:28:50,351 --> 01:28:51,161
you can't work out.

3115
01:28:51,161 --> 01:28:51,550
Right,

3116
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:51,950
right.

3117
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:55,000
And does that affect you when
you take the time to help you?

3118
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:55,241
Yeah.

3119
01:28:55,241 --> 01:28:56,074
I've been in a Rut,

3120
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,190
if not exercising.

3121
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:58,870
When you do exercise a lot,

3122
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,210
does it alleviate your symptoms,

3123
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:01,860
your feel?

3124
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:02,190
Very

3125
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:02,521
much.

3126
01:29:02,521 --> 01:29:02,940
Really?

3127
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:03,630
Yeah.

3128
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:04,463
Yeah.

3129
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:05,640
I'm doing this thing now.

3130
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:09,450
I think Neil Brennan recommended
it and a magnet thing.

3131
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,020
Yeah.

3132
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:10,853
Tms.

3133
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,290
Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

3134
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:13,500
Yeah.

3135
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,251
He said it was amazing.

3136
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:15,390
I've done it for 10 weeks.

3137
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:16,500
Every single day.

3138
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,220
Really?

3139
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:17,491
Yeah.

3140
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:18,420
Just did it this morning.

3141
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,680
Do you do it to yourself?

3142
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:20,041
No.

3143
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:20,910
You go in first,

3144
01:29:20,911 --> 01:29:23,100
you get an Mri and they
map out your brain.

3145
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:28,370
And the whole theory behind it is that
they can use magnetic stimulation to sort

3146
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:32,130
of like waking up one of the lobes
in your brain that's associated with

3147
01:29:32,131 --> 01:29:32,964
depression.

3148
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:37,260
And so you go in and first they map out
your brain and then you go in and for

3149
01:29:37,261 --> 01:29:38,250
like a half hour,

3150
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:42,870
they just pulse this magnetic
thing onto your head.

3151
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:43,691
It's like,

3152
01:29:43,691 --> 01:29:46,080
I'll very low grade MRI almost.

3153
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:47,701
And uh,

3154
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:50,970
I've had amazing results
and it lasts forever.

3155
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,241
You know,

3156
01:29:51,241 --> 01:29:53,040
you go through this cycle of it and then,

3157
01:29:53,041 --> 01:29:53,310
uh,

3158
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:53,800
he's,

3159
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,320
Neil's had the same experience.

3160
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,130
That's crazy.

3161
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:56,550
Yeah.

3162
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:56,861
Highly.

3163
01:29:56,861 --> 01:29:57,990
We're last forever.

3164
01:29:58,130 --> 01:29:58,590
Yup.

3165
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:00,720
Well they say some people
have to come in and,

3166
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:01,501
and you know,

3167
01:30:01,501 --> 01:30:01,890
get a,

3168
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:02,723
get a tuneup.

3169
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:04,830
But generally it's one time.

3170
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:06,020
Um,

3171
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:07,540
there's a woman named Cat Zingano.

3172
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:08,390
She's one of the UFC,

3173
01:30:08,391 --> 01:30:10,940
he's a top bantamweights and she,

3174
01:30:10,941 --> 01:30:11,420
uh,

3175
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:15,440
fought UFC champion Amanda Nunez back
in the day and actually beat her before

3176
01:30:15,441 --> 01:30:16,274
she won the title.

3177
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:20,810
But in that fight she got hurt real bad
and she talked about it on the podcast

3178
01:30:20,811 --> 01:30:24,140
that she developed a bunch of
brain issues after that fight.

3179
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:27,830
Cause like her cortisol levels were
all fucked up at home unless we're all

3180
01:30:27,831 --> 01:30:28,580
fucked up.

3181
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:31,190
She developed thyroid problem
she had hit in the head.

3182
01:30:31,191 --> 01:30:31,780
So

3183
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:32,613
she is,

3184
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:34,170
yeah,

3185
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:36,690
she couldn't keep weight off just trying
to figure out what the fuck is wrong

3186
01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:37,260
with her.

3187
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:38,970
And one of the things
that helped her the best.

3188
01:30:38,971 --> 01:30:42,540
She talked about it really openly
and in depth on the podcast.

3189
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:45,380
But one of the things that helped her
the best was they have this at the,

3190
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:48,660
I think it's a different kind of
magnetic therapy then this one,

3191
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:50,140
cause I think this is only,

3192
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:55,370
the center only exists around San Diego
and a lot of military guys come back and

3193
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:56,340
use it.

3194
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:57,180
Football players,

3195
01:30:57,181 --> 01:31:00,270
people with head injuries and someone
recommended it to her and it helped her

3196
01:31:00,271 --> 01:31:00,951
tremendously.

3197
01:31:00,951 --> 01:31:01,470
Yeah.

3198
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:02,550
Really brought it back.

3199
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:03,221
Yeah.

3200
01:31:03,221 --> 01:31:05,620
There's some real breakthroughs
going on because um,

3201
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:06,191
you know,

3202
01:31:06,191 --> 01:31:07,130
people are and they,

3203
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:07,540
they,

3204
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:07,751
you know,

3205
01:31:07,751 --> 01:31:11,240
they still use like electric
shock therapy and it,

3206
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:11,560
you know,

3207
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:11,800
with,

3208
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,230
with pretty good results
but a lot of side effects.

3209
01:31:14,231 --> 01:31:16,810
Did you get hit in the head
a lot when you were a kid?

3210
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,513
Sometimes,

3211
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:20,370
but did,

3212
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:22,970
was there any like moments
which get knocked down?

3213
01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:24,280
I don't think I ever got knocked out.

3214
01:31:24,281 --> 01:31:25,740
Did you ever get hit with a bat or,

3215
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:26,741
I played hockey,

3216
01:31:26,741 --> 01:31:28,330
so I used to check people a lot.

3217
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:29,290
Did you ever get down?

3218
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:31,120
Did you get really hurt doing that?

3219
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:32,883
Nah,

3220
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:33,401
never that.

3221
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:33,970
My neck,

3222
01:31:33,970 --> 01:31:35,920
my neck is still fucked
up to this day from a,

3223
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:36,800
from a check,

3224
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,080
a head check that I made,

3225
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:40,960
but now I don't think I
ever had any concussions.

3226
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:42,611
My friend mark,

3227
01:31:42,611 --> 01:31:42,761
no,

3228
01:31:42,761 --> 01:31:43,000
mine.

3229
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:43,271
Mine.

3230
01:31:43,271 --> 01:31:43,481
Right.

3231
01:31:43,481 --> 01:31:43,721
Sorry.

3232
01:31:43,721 --> 01:31:44,920
My mind runs in the family.

3233
01:31:44,921 --> 01:31:45,401
My Mom,

3234
01:31:45,401 --> 01:31:46,270
my dad's got it.

3235
01:31:46,271 --> 01:31:46,481
It's,

3236
01:31:46,481 --> 01:31:47,050
it's,

3237
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:48,760
it's very genetic depression.

3238
01:31:48,761 --> 01:31:48,911
No,

3239
01:31:48,911 --> 01:31:49,590
I'm sure it is is,

3240
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:51,500
but I think it's accentuated by trauma.

3241
01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:52,040
Yeah.

3242
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,450
And that's why I was asking you because,

3243
01:31:53,451 --> 01:31:53,810
uh,

3244
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:55,310
even though you probably,

3245
01:31:55,311 --> 01:31:55,551
I mean,

3246
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:56,990
I know you played a lot of hockey.

3247
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:57,741
He knew the,

3248
01:31:57,741 --> 01:32:01,510
you probably don't think about it every
time you collide and even falling down,

3249
01:32:01,511 --> 01:32:02,480
slamming into the wall.

3250
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:03,560
Yeah.

3251
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,420
There's a lot of that.

3252
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,860
All that stuff rattles your brain.

3253
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:06,851
Believe it or not.

3254
01:32:06,851 --> 01:32:09,490
People get concussions from
getting hit in the chest sometimes.

3255
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,000
Really?

3256
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,360
Yeah.

3257
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,171
Here's cats and gone.

3258
01:32:11,171 --> 01:32:11,980
No,

3259
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:16,980
it says a EEG and vitals for my RM dams
treats FDA approved to treat migraines.

3260
01:32:17,021 --> 01:32:18,880
Depression improves anxiety,

3261
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:19,571
PTSD,

3262
01:32:19,571 --> 01:32:20,111
Tbi,

3263
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:20,531
sleep,

3264
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:21,011
ADHD,

3265
01:32:21,011 --> 01:32:21,700
et Cetera,

3266
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:22,271
et cetera.

3267
01:32:22,271 --> 01:32:22,541
Now,

3268
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:25,090
accepting insurance and tri care mindset,

3269
01:32:25,091 --> 01:32:26,680
Rancho Bernardo,

3270
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:27,820
check them out.

3271
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:28,391
And this is a,

3272
01:32:28,391 --> 01:32:30,760
you can find this on cats
and Ganos Twitter page.

3273
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:33,430
She's got a picture of her with
this apparatus on her head.

3274
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,690
But I know it helped her.

3275
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:34,901
Yeah,

3276
01:32:34,901 --> 01:32:35,721
I've heard of EEG.

3277
01:32:35,721 --> 01:32:35,951
It's,

3278
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:37,030
it's really effective.

3279
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,960
It helped her a lot.

3280
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:38,621
He helped it.

3281
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:39,070
Uh,

3282
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:39,401
you know,

3283
01:32:39,401 --> 01:32:43,700
she could talk about what sparring
was like before and afterwards.

3284
01:32:43,701 --> 01:32:44,530
So she just,

3285
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:45,820
her coordination was off.

3286
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:46,683
She was,

3287
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:49,570
that's one of the things that happens
to people when they get brain damage.

3288
01:32:49,571 --> 01:32:51,280
If they get knocked out or you know,

3289
01:32:51,281 --> 01:32:52,780
bad concussions is your,

3290
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:55,240
your system's not firing correctly.

3291
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:57,250
So you'll see their
body's not moving right.

3292
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,930
So it almost resets,

3293
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:00,100
resets to hard,

3294
01:33:00,101 --> 01:33:00,351
dry,

3295
01:33:00,351 --> 01:33:01,184
damaged,

3296
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:02,180
damaged,

3297
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:02,380
right.

3298
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:02,530
You know,

3299
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:04,810
the signals aren't getting
to the muscles correctly.

3300
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,800
So like you see,

3301
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:09,820
one of the things that you see in older
boxers when they've taken too many

3302
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,240
horrible fights and they're,

3303
01:33:11,241 --> 01:33:12,670
they're really starting to lose it,

3304
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:13,610
is there,

3305
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:15,250
there steps look shorter,

3306
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,750
their legs or look closer together.

3307
01:33:16,751 --> 01:33:17,050
They have it.

3308
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:17,300
Oh,

3309
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,970
they're having a harder time moving.

3310
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:23,080
They don't have the confidence to have
the balanced move around and they're

3311
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:23,400
their,

3312
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:23,950
their,

3313
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:26,260
their systems circuiting.

3314
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:26,820
Yeah.

3315
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:27,070
You know,

3316
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:28,660
and you're seeing it
in their coordination.

3317
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:30,010
It's a weird thing to see too.

3318
01:33:30,011 --> 01:33:34,000
I've seen it in fighters where I remember
them in their prime and then I see

3319
01:33:34,001 --> 01:33:34,811
them now and I'm like,

3320
01:33:34,811 --> 01:33:35,644
Whoa,

3321
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:36,450
there's too,

3322
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:37,300
it's two possibilities.

3323
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:38,140
It could be an injury,

3324
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:39,370
they could be dealing with an injury,

3325
01:33:39,371 --> 01:33:41,250
but if you find that
there's no injury and like,

3326
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:41,860
oh,

3327
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:42,760
this is not good.

3328
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:42,941
No,

3329
01:33:42,941 --> 01:33:45,850
just look at Ben Roethlisberger
out there and the pocket when he,

3330
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:47,230
he tries to run,

3331
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:49,120
it's like little steps.

3332
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:50,640
No movement in the shelters.

3333
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,540
And that guy used to be fast back there,

3334
01:33:52,541 --> 01:33:53,830
but he's gotten hit a lot.

3335
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,480
Does no getting away from it,

3336
01:33:55,481 --> 01:33:56,230
man.

3337
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,063
It is what it is.

3338
01:33:57,450 --> 01:33:58,360
If you had a,

3339
01:33:58,361 --> 01:33:59,320
you ever been knocked out?

3340
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:00,250
Yeah.

3341
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:00,760
Yeah.

3342
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:01,810
Not unconscious.

3343
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,730
I've got stopped and a kickboxing match.

3344
01:34:03,731 --> 01:34:07,720
I got hit with a big left hook boom
and my legs went out from under me.

3345
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:08,680
It was crazy.

3346
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:09,550
Well it didn't even hurt.

3347
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,860
It was like like because you're,

3348
01:34:11,861 --> 01:34:16,180
you're full of adrenaline so you don't
feel it in terms of like a ouchy.

3349
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:18,160
It's not like [inaudible] but it's like,

3350
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,140
it wasn't like a painful thing.

3351
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:21,430
It was like being,

3352
01:34:21,431 --> 01:34:22,900
and then my legs just stopped working.

3353
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:23,231
I was like,

3354
01:34:23,231 --> 01:34:24,100
Whoa,

3355
01:34:24,101 --> 01:34:24,940
what the fuck.

3356
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:28,600
That was the hardest I ever been hit
because it was just on the button.

3357
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:30,820
It was a perfect Isaac Dwin.

3358
01:34:30,821 --> 01:34:31,091
I should,

3359
01:34:31,091 --> 01:34:36,091
as I was exhausted already at this
third fight of a day in a kickboxing

3360
01:34:36,131 --> 01:34:41,131
tournament and just crank and my legs
just went woopsies getting really lucky

3361
01:34:41,291 --> 01:34:43,570
with all the fighting you did
that you never got knocked out.

3362
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:44,680
Super Lucky.

3363
01:34:44,681 --> 01:34:48,310
But I definitely got hit in the head
a bunch and even though I didn't get

3364
01:34:48,311 --> 01:34:49,060
knocked out,

3365
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,260
there's a lot of sparring.

3366
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:52,600
There was a lot of getting
punched in the face.

3367
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:54,040
There was a lot of getting
kicked in the head.

3368
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:55,480
Less kicked in the head,

3369
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:56,081
believe it or not,

3370
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:56,891
cause I was terrified.

3371
01:34:56,891 --> 01:34:58,010
I was always moving fast.

3372
01:34:58,340 --> 01:34:59,180
She wear helmets?

3373
01:34:59,210 --> 01:34:59,691
No,

3374
01:34:59,691 --> 01:35:00,950
we wear these things.

3375
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,370
The first tournament's we used to wear
these things on the back of the head and

3376
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:06,200
that that was so when you get knocked out,

3377
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,320
your fucking head doesn't
bounce too hard off the ground.

3378
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:11,060
I'm not bullshitting you pick one spot.

3379
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:13,430
There's a video of me
fighting with one of those on.

3380
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:15,710
It's a video of me on youtube.

3381
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:19,540
I've got this spot in the back
of my head that it looks like a,

3382
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:20,331
like a bald spot.

3383
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:22,640
Like it would have if I had hair now,

3384
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:24,050
but it's a Yamaka.

3385
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:24,441
Yeah,

3386
01:35:24,441 --> 01:35:24,780
like a,

3387
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:26,180
it's a red plastic thing.

3388
01:35:26,181 --> 01:35:27,650
It's hard to tell cause
it's a shitty video.

3389
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:31,940
But that red plastic thing was basically
like a spongy thing that these to use

3390
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:33,130
in taekwondo terms.

3391
01:35:33,131 --> 01:35:33,380
Cause we,

3392
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:37,310
it was first it was no padding
and then eventually they made,

3393
01:35:37,311 --> 01:35:41,500
people start wearing these helmets and
they basically like these Cushnie helmets

3394
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:43,980
that go over the top of the head and
you've got to strap them out underneath.

3395
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:45,320
See how that guy's wearing it.

3396
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:46,693
The White Guy,

3397
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:49,730
the see the guy in the background or
the right side that's wearing the white

3398
01:35:49,731 --> 01:35:50,210
thing.

3399
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:51,140
That's the standard one.

3400
01:35:51,141 --> 01:35:51,670
What I'm wearing.

3401
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:53,060
Just a pat on the back of my head.

3402
01:35:53,061 --> 01:35:53,250
Right.

3403
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:55,820
See that there's like a red
thing in the back of my head,

3404
01:35:56,530 --> 01:36:00,770
but that's in case I got code because
when we're fighting on a fucking,

3405
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:02,360
this is a basketball court.

3406
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,610
This is wood floor protection.

3407
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,410
That was me knocking that guy out.

3408
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:08,301
That was me.

3409
01:36:08,301 --> 01:36:11,200
This is me when I'm 19 so these,

3410
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:12,770
this was where we fought all the time.

3411
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:14,270
We always fought on hardwood floors.

3412
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:17,120
One time I fought crazy
way crazier from this.

3413
01:36:17,121 --> 01:36:17,954
Ready for this,

3414
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,370
the bay state games.

3415
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:21,290
I find the bay state games.

3416
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:24,560
We fought on a tarp that was
laid out over a cement floor.

3417
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:25,430
Wow.

3418
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:26,000
Yeah.

3419
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,830
And I knocked a guy out in his head,

3420
01:36:27,831 --> 01:36:29,000
bounced off the cement.

3421
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:30,200
Oh my God.

3422
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:32,820
Kicked this dude in the head
and his head bounced off some,

3423
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,310
I'll never forget that sound.

3424
01:36:34,311 --> 01:36:34,830
Yes.

3425
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:37,700
So I was 19 I didn't
know what the fuck to do.

3426
01:36:37,701 --> 01:36:39,380
This is where the tournament was,

3427
01:36:39,381 --> 01:36:40,160
is okay.

3428
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:40,701
It's okay.

3429
01:36:40,701 --> 01:36:41,534
We're going to do this.

3430
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:42,620
We're going to fight here.

3431
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:43,160
Like,

3432
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:43,941
if that was today,

3433
01:36:43,941 --> 01:36:44,420
I would like,

3434
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:46,910
are you guys out of your fucking mind?

3435
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:47,450
I would.

3436
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:51,020
I would be screaming if I went with my
kid and he was supposed to fight in a

3437
01:36:51,021 --> 01:36:55,850
tournament and I got there and there was
a thin plastic tarp stretch out over a

3438
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:57,110
smooth concrete floor.

3439
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:57,651
I'm like,

3440
01:36:57,651 --> 01:36:59,300
what the fuck are you talking about?

3441
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:00,230
Are you crazy?

3442
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:00,590
Yeah.

3443
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:01,880
Like you need pads.

3444
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:04,020
You need people to make sure
they don't go out of bounds.

3445
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:06,740
Tarp laid down over concrete.

3446
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:07,380
Wow.

3447
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:08,213
He was so,

3448
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:09,470
so dangerous.

3449
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:12,350
So I definitely got my noggin rattled.

3450
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,213
Yeah,

3451
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,450
a gang at times.

3452
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:14,990
Yeah.

3453
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:15,920
I don't know how many times

3454
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:19,470
I said do a gymnastics for like six years.

3455
01:37:19,471 --> 01:37:22,070
Starting when I was like six backflip.

3456
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:22,621
Oh yeah,

3457
01:37:22,621 --> 01:37:23,250
I could do,

3458
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:24,570
I used to double backs.

3459
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:24,950
No,

3460
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:25,111
no,

3461
01:37:25,111 --> 01:37:25,471
I did.

3462
01:37:25,471 --> 01:37:25,751
I,

3463
01:37:25,751 --> 01:37:27,120
I trained for like six years.

3464
01:37:27,121 --> 01:37:27,930
Hard way.

3465
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:28,860
How did I not know this?

3466
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:29,131
Yeah,

3467
01:37:29,131 --> 01:37:30,540
so I used to do a,

3468
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:30,751
yeah,

3469
01:37:30,751 --> 01:37:31,531
I could do round off,

3470
01:37:31,531 --> 01:37:33,140
back handspring into a double back.

3471
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:34,020
And you still do that?

3472
01:37:34,110 --> 01:37:34,943
I can.

3473
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,020
I haven't tried a single back in a while,

3474
01:37:37,021 --> 01:37:37,800
but I could do,

3475
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,960
I could do standing back
flips until a few years ago.

3476
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,220
Wow.

3477
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:41,610
Yeah.

3478
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:42,510
No Shit.

3479
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:43,353
Right.

3480
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:44,261
That's so I,

3481
01:37:44,261 --> 01:37:45,730
so I just wanted to learn how to do that.

3482
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,361
I did,

3483
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:46,530
uh,

3484
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:50,410
I over rotated a flip one time and I
fucking slammed my head in a maths back

3485
01:37:50,411 --> 01:37:50,890
then.

3486
01:37:50,890 --> 01:37:52,840
When you see floor exercise today,

3487
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,520
it's not even the same sport.

3488
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,473
It's all

3489
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:58,020
right with like two inches of padding.

3490
01:37:58,170 --> 01:37:58,321
Right.

3491
01:37:58,321 --> 01:37:58,951
When we did it,

3492
01:37:58,951 --> 01:38:00,720
it was those fucking rubber,

3493
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:01,411
you know,

3494
01:38:01,411 --> 01:38:04,980
half inch thick mats that you've rolled
out in the corners come popping up.

3495
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:06,330
That's what we used to do it.

3496
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:08,040
Oh yes.

3497
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,410
You were fucking twisting
your ankle all the time.

3498
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:11,340
Landing on that shit.

3499
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:13,530
How bad you fuck your
head up when you landed.

3500
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:14,670
It was bad.

3501
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,280
My injuries or my ankles.

3502
01:38:16,281 --> 01:38:17,190
So I used to fuck up my,

3503
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:17,331
yeah.

3504
01:38:17,331 --> 01:38:17,851
And then you know,

3505
01:38:17,851 --> 01:38:18,361
you can't,

3506
01:38:18,361 --> 01:38:19,980
then you can't do anything
for a little while.

3507
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:20,920
So,

3508
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:25,140
well the reason why I keep asking you
about head trauma is cause my friend Mark

3509
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:25,620
Gordon,

3510
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,960
he's an expert in traumatic brain injury.

3511
01:38:27,961 --> 01:38:31,200
He's an endocrinologist and he studies
a lot of soldiers and he's written a

3512
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:32,500
bunch of papers on um,

3513
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:33,780
soldiers,

3514
01:38:33,781 --> 01:38:34,830
former football players,

3515
01:38:34,831 --> 01:38:35,371
fighters.

3516
01:38:35,371 --> 01:38:39,570
He's worked with a bunch of people
that have had brain injuries and his

3517
01:38:39,571 --> 01:38:40,404
conclusion like,

3518
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:41,910
and a lot of them that were suicidal,

3519
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:43,440
a lot of them that are severely depressed.

3520
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:46,650
And his conclusion is
that for a lot of them,

3521
01:38:46,651 --> 01:38:50,490
what happened was damaged to the
pituitary gland that stopped them from

3522
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:52,050
producing hormones correctly.

3523
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:54,720
And it leads to severe lack of energy,

3524
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:55,554
depression.

3525
01:38:55,830 --> 01:39:00,600
And it's almost always correlated with
head trauma and oftentimes head trauma

3526
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,060
that people forgot about why they
didn't think of that big of a deal.

3527
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,600
But it could be literally wiping out on
a jet ski slamming into the water game

3528
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:10,471
and yeah.

3529
01:39:10,471 --> 01:39:12,720
And then you're fucked up for
years and you don't know why.

3530
01:39:12,721 --> 01:39:13,680
Skiing for sure,

3531
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:14,251
falling down,

3532
01:39:14,251 --> 01:39:16,200
hitting your head
snowboarding is really common.

3533
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:19,470
I've never snowboarded but apparently
when the s the board kicks up,

3534
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,560
your feet go up in the air and
the fucking head comes down.

3535
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:22,080
Yeah.

3536
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,550
That's how people get got well,

3537
01:39:23,551 --> 01:39:25,110
and you got to wear a helmet.

3538
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:25,500
Yeah.

3539
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,490
And a lot of kids down.

3540
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:27,810
Yeah,

3541
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:29,760
I've heard of kids getting fucked up.

3542
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:30,593
So yeah.

3543
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:34,050
But so all those things
contribute to the foot.

3544
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:36,120
Your brain is super delicate,

3545
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:36,721
you know,

3546
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:38,190
it's really complicated machinery.

3547
01:39:38,191 --> 01:39:39,780
It's like when you drop your iPhone,

3548
01:39:39,781 --> 01:39:40,800
maybe you drop at once,

3549
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,560
how many times you drop your iPhone
dropped to three times today.

3550
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:43,801
Hey,

3551
01:39:43,801 --> 01:39:44,011
hey,

3552
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:44,430
hey,

3553
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:45,780
put a fucking case on that thing.

3554
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:46,673
Yeah,

3555
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:50,460
I mean they of these drop tests,

3556
01:39:50,461 --> 01:39:50,970
right?

3557
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:54,030
They do drop tests where they drop it
over concrete and see how good it is.

3558
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:57,270
Your head is similar in that you,

3559
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:59,550
you can get away with
getting racked in the head.

3560
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:02,920
But I was in Hawaii recently and I
dropped my phone the last time that,

3561
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:03,590
you know,

3562
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:04,590
you drop your phone and you know,

3563
01:40:04,591 --> 01:40:08,100
it's getting a little wonky and then
you drop it the last time and it's just

3564
01:40:08,101 --> 01:40:08,934
gone.

3565
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:09,511
It's gone.

3566
01:40:09,511 --> 01:40:11,580
Ceville it was just calling people.

3567
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:12,150
I would,

3568
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:12,880
I was smelling,

3569
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:13,270
yeah,

3570
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:14,190
I was showing a,

3571
01:40:14,191 --> 01:40:14,760
so when I was,

3572
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:15,240
uh,

3573
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,830
had the phone open and I was like,

3574
01:40:16,831 --> 01:40:17,071
watch,

3575
01:40:17,071 --> 01:40:17,311
watch,

3576
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:18,110
it's on the context.

3577
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:20,880
Like it's just going to start calling
people and just started calling people and

3578
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:22,980
I'd hang up and then would
just call somebody else,

3579
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:24,730
hang up and it would just cost wheels.

3580
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:26,490
It was just falling apart.

3581
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:28,410
It wouldn't let me log in anymore.

3582
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,101
Like it wasn't,

3583
01:40:29,101 --> 01:40:33,090
it wasn't sensing my fingers touching
the screen to put in the key code.

3584
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:34,470
Who's your shit all backed up.

3585
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:34,890
Yeah,

3586
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:35,370
yeah,

3587
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:35,611
yeah.

3588
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:36,241
It was all backed up,

3589
01:40:36,241 --> 01:40:36,631
but it was like,

3590
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:37,464
God dammit.

3591
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,460
God dammit.

3592
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:39,293
Yup.

3593
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:40,560
Yeah.

3594
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,640
I smashed my screen.

3595
01:40:41,641 --> 01:40:41,970
I didn't,

3596
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:43,620
I didn't give a fuck your heads like that.

3597
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:44,580
That's my point.

3598
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:45,420
Your heads like that.

3599
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,190
Like if I didn't get that one last drop,

3600
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:48,930
maybe a phone would've been all right.

3601
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:49,410
Yeah.

3602
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:50,520
They would've kept that phone today.

3603
01:40:50,630 --> 01:40:51,000
Yeah.

3604
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:51,181
You know,

3605
01:40:51,181 --> 01:40:52,410
maybe be able to look
through the new phones.

3606
01:40:52,411 --> 01:40:52,530
We,

3607
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:53,200
I don't need that.

3608
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,520
It's basically the same phone,

3609
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:55,453
right?

3610
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:56,323
Nope.

3611
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:57,560
Draak smack.

3612
01:40:58,190 --> 01:41:00,020
I'm reading this book now about,

3613
01:41:00,021 --> 01:41:00,650
um,

3614
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:01,910
speaking of changing your brain,

3615
01:41:01,911 --> 01:41:04,310
it's called a how to change your mind.

3616
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,050
God is Michael Pollan.

3617
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:06,790
Yeah.

3618
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:07,130
Yeah.

3619
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:08,480
He's been on the podcast talking about,

3620
01:41:08,510 --> 01:41:08,601
oh,

3621
01:41:08,601 --> 01:41:09,240
no shit.

3622
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:10,073
Yeah.

3623
01:41:10,430 --> 01:41:11,720
Did he talk about his new book,

3624
01:41:11,721 --> 01:41:12,261
about the,

3625
01:41:12,261 --> 01:41:12,910
um,

3626
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:13,220
it,

3627
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:13,611
it's,

3628
01:41:13,611 --> 01:41:14,990
it's basically about,

3629
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:16,363
uh,

3630
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:16,910
um,

3631
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:20,330
psychedelics and LSD and
mushrooms in particular,

3632
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:22,340
and it traces the whole
fucking history of it.

3633
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:26,780
I had no idea how much research was
done back in the fifties and sixties.

3634
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:27,351
I mean,

3635
01:41:27,351 --> 01:41:31,310
they had conclusive studies
that were showing with,

3636
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:32,163
um,

3637
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:33,740
alcoholism.

3638
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:38,860
People were 70% of people that underwent
these treatments with psychedelics got

3639
01:41:39,471 --> 01:41:40,110
sober,

3640
01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:40,730
you know,

3641
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:41,570
depression,

3642
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:42,643
cigarettes,

3643
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:43,820
cigarettes.

3644
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:44,811
I mean,

3645
01:41:44,811 --> 01:41:45,591
it's amazing.

3646
01:41:45,591 --> 01:41:48,350
And all that shit just
got fucking thrown away.

3647
01:41:48,970 --> 01:41:53,350
Corrupt people kept that
information away from folks.

3648
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,270
The studies that Nixon funded,

3649
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:58,810
like Nixon funded a bunch of studies that
showed positive benefits of marijuana.

3650
01:41:59,320 --> 01:41:59,741
How is that?

3651
01:41:59,741 --> 01:42:00,010
Right.

3652
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:00,460
And they,

3653
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:00,880
you know,

3654
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,110
the Nixon administration
just fucking Canva.

3655
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,920
I get out of here with this
shit not releasing this.

3656
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:06,141
Well,

3657
01:42:06,141 --> 01:42:06,620
and the,

3658
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:09,370
the other thing he mentioned
is that it got squashed by,

3659
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:13,420
by shrinks because they had
a vested interest in people
not going into the woods

3660
01:42:13,421 --> 01:42:16,150
for a weekend and coming back
without their depression.

3661
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,280
So yeah.

3662
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:17,850
So they,

3663
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:19,870
so they disqualified all the studies.

3664
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:20,561
Oh fuck.

3665
01:42:20,561 --> 01:42:21,120
Yeah.

3666
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,540
What psychiatrists were like,

3667
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:24,080
horrified that there was the,

3668
01:42:24,081 --> 01:42:25,810
these kind of results were coming back.

3669
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:27,350
Was it that for sure?

3670
01:42:27,351 --> 01:42:32,210
Or was it people who've never taken
psychedelics horrified that people are out

3671
01:42:32,211 --> 01:42:33,710
there experimenting with
their consciousness?

3672
01:42:33,711 --> 01:42:37,010
Because I think a lot of
these psychiatrists are
probably really straight laced

3673
01:42:37,011 --> 01:42:37,730
guys.

3674
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:38,870
And so in their mind,

3675
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:43,810
especially in the shadows of reefer
madness and all the propaganda that they'd

3676
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:47,660
heard in the 30s and forties and when
you look at those people and they're out

3677
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:51,050
there in the fucking desert or wherever
they're going dancing around and taking

3678
01:42:51,051 --> 01:42:52,130
mushrooms under the moonlight,

3679
01:42:52,131 --> 01:42:52,311
you like,

3680
01:42:52,311 --> 01:42:53,690
they're blown their brains out here.

3681
01:42:53,691 --> 01:42:54,530
You've got to stop this.

3682
01:42:54,890 --> 01:42:57,080
If they're straight laced people
that have ever done psychedelics,

3683
01:42:57,530 --> 01:42:58,940
they might not be in cahoots.

3684
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:03,320
It might more likely be a bunch of people
to think it's a fucking terrible idea

3685
01:43:03,321 --> 01:43:04,910
to let people run around taking acid.

3686
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,210
Well there was just some of the
medical journals came out with,

3687
01:43:08,211 --> 01:43:13,070
with pieces saying that none of these
studies are valid because there wasn't a,

3688
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:17,030
I forget what it is about studies
that have to be consistent.

3689
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:18,140
Um,

3690
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:22,250
but the other thing is it was political
and you had Timothy leary who is,

3691
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:23,090
you know,

3692
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:27,590
the worst thing to happen to this kind
of testing because he was saying was it

3693
01:43:27,591 --> 01:43:30,260
dropped dropout in turn on drop,

3694
01:43:30,261 --> 01:43:31,094
drop out.

3695
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:32,660
And that whole idea they said,

3696
01:43:32,661 --> 01:43:33,260
you know,

3697
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:36,380
people taking LSD are not
going to fight your wars.

3698
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:40,070
And so that became a
threat to the status quo.

3699
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:41,503
Wow.

3700
01:43:41,570 --> 01:43:43,250
And that's when the law
is started to come out.

3701
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:45,763
Huh.

3702
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:46,520
It's interesting

3703
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,790
cause you also got a lot of
people to get excited about it,

3704
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:50,213
right?

3705
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:50,820
Yeah.

3706
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:51,653
But got

3707
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,710
he took it away from it being a,

3708
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:55,573
um,

3709
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:59,430
a medical process and he made it about,

3710
01:44:00,090 --> 01:44:00,511
you know,

3711
01:44:00,511 --> 01:44:01,261
enlightenment,

3712
01:44:01,261 --> 01:44:03,570
but in a kind of fluffy spiritual way.

3713
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,400
Well he made it a big movement.

3714
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:05,850
Right.

3715
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:08,790
I think you saw that he was probably
going to change the world with that

3716
01:44:08,791 --> 01:44:09,420
movement.

3717
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:09,650
Yeah.

3718
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:10,500
He kind of did.

3719
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:12,750
It definitely had a big impact.

3720
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:13,111
You know,

3721
01:44:13,111 --> 01:44:14,490
all those people that took acid.

3722
01:44:14,650 --> 01:44:15,031
It's like,

3723
01:44:15,031 --> 01:44:20,031
think about if you really stop and think
about apple and you really look at the

3724
01:44:22,381 --> 01:44:23,760
fact that apple,

3725
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,730
Steve Jobs said that taken acid was like
one of the greatest things that ever

3726
01:44:27,731 --> 01:44:28,231
happened to him.

3727
01:44:28,231 --> 01:44:28,740
Yeah.

3728
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:29,041
That was,

3729
01:44:29,041 --> 01:44:30,960
as it was famously talked about it.

3730
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:32,881
And who knows what a,

3731
01:44:32,881 --> 01:44:37,881
what an impact that had on him deciding
to start apple and what would an impact

3732
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:40,260
apple has had and the technology world.

3733
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:40,740
Oh No.

3734
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:42,030
And talks about it in the book.

3735
01:44:42,031 --> 01:44:45,810
He draws a straight line from people
starting to take all this stuff because it

3736
01:44:45,811 --> 01:44:47,760
was happening in Silicon Valley.

3737
01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:50,880
This whole psychedelic movement
was like right in that area.

3738
01:44:51,330 --> 01:44:52,320
And he says that it,

3739
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:52,681
you know,

3740
01:44:52,681 --> 01:44:53,040
Bill,

3741
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,810
Bill Gates apparently took it once,

3742
01:44:55,410 --> 01:44:58,170
but that all those guys were
coming in and they were,

3743
01:44:58,350 --> 01:44:58,621
you know,

3744
01:44:58,621 --> 01:44:58,831
they,

3745
01:44:58,831 --> 01:45:01,050
there were these people that would lead.

3746
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:03,270
There was a guy named,

3747
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:04,163
um,

3748
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:05,633
uh,

3749
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:06,743
no Hubbard,

3750
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:07,051
well,

3751
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:08,670
Ron doss has mentioned also,

3752
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:11,610
but there was a guy name
Hubbard who was really like,

3753
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:12,330
you know,

3754
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:14,430
a corporate version of LSD.

3755
01:45:14,431 --> 01:45:19,431
He was going to companies and he was
taking the CEOs of companies and taking

3756
01:45:19,741 --> 01:45:24,060
them in for these three
day drop acid experiences.

3757
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:25,403
Wow.

3758
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:28,070
Corporate acid.

3759
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:28,221
Well,

3760
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:29,810
they're kind of doing that at burning man.

3761
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:31,101
How is that?

3762
01:45:31,101 --> 01:45:31,341
Right?

3763
01:45:31,341 --> 01:45:32,174
Some corporations,

3764
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:33,590
I mean not a lot,

3765
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:36,440
but there's some cool companies
and go to burning man.

3766
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:37,220
Yeah.

3767
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,053
You know

3768
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:39,940
what's this?

3769
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:40,451
Alfred?

3770
01:45:40,451 --> 01:45:41,560
Matthew Hubbard.

3771
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:44,320
He's an early proponent of the drug LSD.

3772
01:45:44,321 --> 01:45:49,321
During the 1950s he is reputed to be the
Johnny Appleseed of Lsd and the first

3773
01:45:49,481 --> 01:45:54,481
person to emphasize led lsds potential
as a visionary or trends and dental

3774
01:45:55,401 --> 01:45:56,234
truck.

3775
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:58,780
But this guy had an a fucking life.

3776
01:45:58,781 --> 01:46:00,610
Somebody's got to do a
movie about his life.

3777
01:46:00,611 --> 01:46:00,871
He,

3778
01:46:00,871 --> 01:46:04,540
he was like working for the government.

3779
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:06,130
He was a double agent.

3780
01:46:06,131 --> 01:46:06,964
He was,

3781
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:08,560
while he was dropping acid,

3782
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:09,543
he was,

3783
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:12,760
he started with nothing
now I think before,

3784
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:13,841
before,

3785
01:46:13,841 --> 01:46:14,680
during and after.

3786
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:19,710
He had like eight different careers
and he was like a spy and he bought it.

3787
01:46:20,501 --> 01:46:24,250
He started with nothing and ended up with
like a bunch of airplanes that he was

3788
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:25,420
leasing out,

3789
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:29,200
became a millionaire and then spent it
all trying to educate people on Lsd.

3790
01:46:29,201 --> 01:46:33,100
He was worth like tens of millions of
dollars and he ended up broke at the end.

3791
01:46:34,690 --> 01:46:35,290
Wow.

3792
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:36,123
Yeah.

3793
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:37,143
Wow.

3794
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:39,820
All for the LSD,

3795
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:43,930
he believed in it so strongly that said
it was going to change the world and it

3796
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:44,764
would have,

3797
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:46,120
it may still now there's,

3798
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,440
now it's coming back.

3799
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:48,490
Well,

3800
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:50,160
there was a hiccup or several

3801
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,190
generations had a pass before people
started understanding that there's,

3802
01:46:53,770 --> 01:46:54,080
there's,

3803
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,340
there's a risk to everything.

3804
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:58,380
There's a risk to sports.

3805
01:46:58,381 --> 01:47:02,430
There's a risk to every fucking thing
you do driving your cars at risk.

3806
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:03,900
There's a risk with psychedelics,

3807
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:05,460
but there's also a reward.

3808
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,120
And I think if you're going to be honest,

3809
01:47:07,121 --> 01:47:08,250
do you have to look at both of them?

3810
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:09,840
You have to look at the potential risk.

3811
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:14,170
You have to look at the reward and they're
not looking at the reward to try to,

3812
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:17,640
there's too many people out there that
are trying to deny the reward and you got

3813
01:47:17,641 --> 01:47:18,474
to find out why.

3814
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:19,410
And in this day and age,

3815
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:21,630
it might be a conspiracy.

3816
01:47:21,631 --> 01:47:26,070
It might be some pharmaceutical industry
that doesn't want it to be legal

3817
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:27,810
because it would undermine their profits.

3818
01:47:27,811 --> 01:47:28,410
It might be,

3819
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:32,970
it might be some law enforcement unions
that think it's a bad idea to make less

3820
01:47:32,971 --> 01:47:33,960
things illegal.

3821
01:47:33,961 --> 01:47:34,794
It take,

3822
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:35,730
you know,

3823
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:36,480
prisons.

3824
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:36,721
Yeah.

3825
01:47:36,721 --> 01:47:38,220
It will take people away,

3826
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:38,460
you know,

3827
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:40,590
in terms of the amount of people
that they need for the job.

3828
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:41,160
It'll,

3829
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:41,580
you know,

3830
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:44,220
which I think that's another story.

3831
01:47:44,221 --> 01:47:46,600
But when you

3832
01:47:49,810 --> 01:47:52,790
and people look at that kind of
stuff and you look at like the,

3833
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:58,000
the underlying sort of patterns
that we follow in this country,

3834
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:00,321
you know,

3835
01:48:00,321 --> 01:48:01,370
the patterns that we like,

3836
01:48:01,371 --> 01:48:05,180
are you happy or not happy
with the way things go,

3837
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,460
the way things are run?

3838
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:08,960
In what sense?

3839
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,410
Just in any sense in all of it.

3840
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:12,623
Yeah.

3841
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:18,120
I trust that we do have the best system
out there and we challenge it every day.

3842
01:48:19,601 --> 01:48:24,601
And I still think that we live in a place
where the tenants of our society are

3843
01:48:26,111 --> 01:48:28,540
in place for sure they
swing one way or the other.

3844
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:32,410
But I still believe in democracy and um,

3845
01:48:32,411 --> 01:48:37,411
I think the internet as an as an overall
thing has been positive for people

3846
01:48:38,141 --> 01:48:39,880
getting their voices out and for,

3847
01:48:39,970 --> 01:48:41,080
for information period

3848
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,173
being distributed.

3849
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:43,680
But the I,

3850
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:47,160
the idea that we're faced
with that in this day and age,

3851
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:50,610
there's grown adults telling other grown
adults what they can and can't put in

3852
01:48:50,611 --> 01:48:51,444
their body.

3853
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,840
Yeah.

3854
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,370
And then not being honest
about the benefits.

3855
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:53,730
Right.

3856
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:55,680
That's where it gets squirrely.

3857
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:57,210
That's where the whole thing falls apart.

3858
01:48:57,510 --> 01:48:58,410
Like you're just a guy.

3859
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:01,080
Like if you and I are the only two people
on the planet and he only came out,

3860
01:49:01,081 --> 01:49:02,400
I'm not going to let you take that acid.

3861
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:03,773
Like why?

3862
01:49:04,650 --> 01:49:04,891
Well,

3863
01:49:04,891 --> 01:49:06,150
because it's illegal.

3864
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:06,451
Look,

3865
01:49:06,451 --> 01:49:07,284
I wrote it down.

3866
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,610
Can you take the acid?

3867
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:08,861
Right.

3868
01:49:08,861 --> 01:49:10,110
Well that would be preposterous.

3869
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:10,530
Yeah.

3870
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:11,311
But somehow or another,

3871
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:12,144
it works.

3872
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:13,680
When there's a million people,

3873
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:15,090
then a person could tell you,

3874
01:49:15,091 --> 01:49:15,410
you know,

3875
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:16,950
if you're a fucking grown adult,

3876
01:49:16,951 --> 01:49:20,610
you can't tell me what
I can take that stupid.

3877
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:21,473
Yeah.

3878
01:49:21,510 --> 01:49:21,810
If,

3879
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:26,490
if you can't prove beyond a shadow of
a doubt that what I'm going to take is

3880
01:49:26,491 --> 01:49:27,630
going to fuck with you.

3881
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:29,010
If you can't prove that,

3882
01:49:29,011 --> 01:49:29,670
then stop.

3883
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:30,503
Yeah.

3884
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:30,991
Look,

3885
01:49:30,991 --> 01:49:32,160
if someone does something,

3886
01:49:32,161 --> 01:49:35,610
if takes something and does and they take
PCP and they run phase first through a

3887
01:49:35,611 --> 01:49:37,890
fucking seven 11 window that's on them,

3888
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:39,150
it's on their actions.

3889
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:42,420
It doesn't mean you shouldn't be able
to try PCP and I don't think you should

3890
01:49:42,421 --> 01:49:43,254
try PCP.

3891
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:46,500
I think when enough enough people
smashed through windows and go crazy,

3892
01:49:46,501 --> 01:49:46,651
you go,

3893
01:49:46,651 --> 01:49:46,831
hey,

3894
01:49:46,831 --> 01:49:48,240
maybe that's a drug I
should fucking avoid.

3895
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:50,350
But that's how you find out about that.

3896
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:51,100
Yeah.

3897
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:55,240
You let grown adults make
their own decisions and if
you're the one who's making

3898
01:49:55,241 --> 01:49:56,890
the decisions for all the grown adults,

3899
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:59,470
you better have some real fucking
logic to what you're saying.

3900
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:00,760
It turns out they don't,

3901
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:04,710
and this is the same society that allows
the pharmaceuticals to peddle opiates

3902
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:08,700
to people for the last 30 years saying
that it was the greatest thing you could

3903
01:50:08,701 --> 01:50:09,400
do.

3904
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:10,180
Exactly.

3905
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:13,750
I think it's good that they make money
because they make medicine that helps a

3906
01:50:13,751 --> 01:50:14,584
lot of people.

3907
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,060
They're not all bad.

3908
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,890
I think in general,

3909
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:21,550
pharmaceuticals have helped
people in tremendous ways,

3910
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:25,030
but you can't deny that
if there's some way,

3911
01:50:25,031 --> 01:50:25,571
shape,

3912
01:50:25,571 --> 01:50:30,490
or form that people are influencing
other people having access to beneficial

3913
01:50:30,491 --> 01:50:33,130
things because it would
impact their profit line.

3914
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:34,790
That's,

3915
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:35,800
that's evil,

3916
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:36,880
that's evil.

3917
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,130
You have a lot of fucking money.

3918
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:43,390
If you really going out of your way
to hire lobbyists to make sure that

3919
01:50:43,391 --> 01:50:45,130
mushrooms don't get on the table,

3920
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:47,411
come on,

3921
01:50:47,411 --> 01:50:48,140
man.

3922
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:48,391
You're,

3923
01:50:48,391 --> 01:50:49,120
you are,

3924
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,980
you're a fucking real problem.

3925
01:50:50,981 --> 01:50:52,120
That's a real problem.

3926
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:53,740
If you look at Yin and Yang,

3927
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:54,341
this is,

3928
01:50:54,341 --> 01:50:55,050
this is the,

3929
01:50:55,050 --> 01:50:55,131
uh,

3930
01:50:55,131 --> 01:51:00,131
opposing forces that were battling to
try to get total complete freedom of your

3931
01:51:00,371 --> 01:51:01,204
consciousness.

3932
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:02,830
These are the opposing forces.

3933
01:51:02,831 --> 01:51:03,664
Their ignorance,

3934
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:05,050
like these psychiatry,

3935
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,650
I guarantee you these psychiatrists
were worried about correlations between

3936
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:13,480
psychotic episodes and psychedelic drug
use and they're worried about people

3937
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,490
falling apart and they're right.

3938
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:16,210
They're right.

3939
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:17,380
This are the ones that wanted to get it.

3940
01:51:17,381 --> 01:51:17,951
Illegal debt,

3941
01:51:17,951 --> 01:51:18,760
right?

3942
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:22,330
It's like working on backflips when
there's a fucking thin pad under you.

3943
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:22,631
Yeah.

3944
01:51:22,631 --> 01:51:23,620
You could fall on your head.

3945
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:24,523
You're right.

3946
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:24,971
And we say,

3947
01:51:24,971 --> 01:51:26,680
don't do gymnastics.

3948
01:51:26,770 --> 01:51:28,000
People fall on their head.

3949
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:30,160
One out of 10 falls on their head.

3950
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:31,210
You're not doing chimney,

3951
01:51:31,211 --> 01:51:32,530
not falling on your fucking head.

3952
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:32,890
Right,

3953
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:33,191
right.

3954
01:51:33,191 --> 01:51:34,024
This is the same thing.

3955
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:35,013
It's the same thing.

3956
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:38,950
So people worried about it that
don't really have experience in it.

3957
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:43,060
I guarantee you most of those
psychiatrists just didn't
have experience in it or

3958
01:51:43,061 --> 01:51:46,000
we're super cautious folks is if
they did have experiences with it,

3959
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:48,370
maybe they try a little mushroom
dose and they'd be like,

3960
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:49,323
wow,

3961
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:51,100
this is amazing.

3962
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,380
His brain and also controlling,

3963
01:51:53,410 --> 01:51:54,243
um,

3964
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:55,750
you know,

3965
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:56,800
set and setting.

3966
01:51:56,801 --> 01:51:57,940
They keep talking about,

3967
01:51:58,330 --> 01:51:58,721
you know,

3968
01:51:58,721 --> 01:52:00,450
and realizing that the,

3969
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:05,460
the occurrence of a psychotic
episode is so much lower when it's,

3970
01:52:06,521 --> 01:52:06,791
you know,

3971
01:52:06,791 --> 01:52:07,360
when you're,

3972
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,620
when it's being dispensed the right,

3973
01:52:08,621 --> 01:52:09,060
right.

3974
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:09,670
Yeah.

3975
01:52:09,670 --> 01:52:10,503
So much lower.

3976
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:15,590
You ever been led through it by somebody
now when you did Iowasca was there like

3977
01:52:15,591 --> 01:52:16,061
a guy,

3978
01:52:16,061 --> 01:52:17,360
Wasco DMT.

3979
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:20,380
My friend Aubrey acted as a,

3980
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:22,750
he co signed to like set the setting.

3981
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:24,453
Um,

3982
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,570
in a way where it was,

3983
01:52:25,950 --> 01:52:26,783
you know,

3984
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:27,780
I would,

3985
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:29,260
I would say like spiritual,

3986
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:33,040
like not dot Riddick not over the top,

3987
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,210
but just announcing your intentions
that we're going into this,

3988
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:38,460
we're going into this,

3989
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:39,850
we're going to let go.

3990
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:41,040
We're going to,

3991
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:41,873
you know,

3992
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:44,200
give thanks to all,

3993
01:52:44,201 --> 01:52:46,550
all the spirits around us
and all the energy around us.

3994
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,650
Just go into this with a good intention.

3995
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:49,520
Give,

3996
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,570
be grateful.

3997
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:51,980
Be uh,

3998
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:53,600
go into it with gratitude.

3999
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,690
And then the way it hits you,

4000
01:52:56,691 --> 01:52:57,620
it hits you like,

4001
01:52:58,970 --> 01:53:03,970
like a infinite cyte clone of geometric
patterns in impossible colors.

4002
01:53:05,150 --> 01:53:07,700
Just blasting in your
brain instantaneously.

4003
01:53:07,701 --> 01:53:08,534
And you'll have

4004
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:14,480
going into it with the intention of
letting go is probably one of the best

4005
01:53:14,481 --> 01:53:18,200
pieces of advice you could give
people to avoid a freak out,

4006
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:19,000
right?

4007
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:19,833
Go with it.

4008
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:20,930
Let it go.

4009
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:21,920
Just let yourself go.

4010
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:25,190
And it's what it's trying to do is
your ego is trying to wrestle with this

4011
01:53:25,191 --> 01:53:26,060
grizzly bear,

4012
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:28,430
this enormous short face.

4013
01:53:28,431 --> 01:53:30,110
Bear on steroids is trying to,

4014
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:33,590
your ego is trying to wrestle with
this impossible to resist force.

4015
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:36,230
And that's what leads to a
lot of people freaking out.

4016
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:37,280
So Iga,

4017
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,970
losing your ego is the
ultimate goal of it.

4018
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:42,463
Um,

4019
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:45,260
I don't think anybody
ever really loses or ego.

4020
01:53:45,770 --> 01:53:46,440
I think you,

4021
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:47,480
you keep it in check,

4022
01:53:47,481 --> 01:53:48,710
you lose some of it.

4023
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:52,770
You keep some of it because that's
what's part of your survival mechanism.

4024
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:55,010
The real problem is like
having a healthy ego.

4025
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:55,970
You know,

4026
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:56,370
like,

4027
01:53:56,370 --> 01:53:57,203
uh,

4028
01:53:58,510 --> 01:54:00,910
like if your wife looks good and she's
looking at herself in the mirror,

4029
01:54:00,940 --> 01:54:01,271
she was like,

4030
01:54:01,271 --> 01:54:01,810
I look good.

4031
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:02,860
You look fucking great.

4032
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:03,730
I do look good.

4033
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:04,751
Like she feels good.

4034
01:54:04,751 --> 01:54:05,860
It feels everybody that's ego,

4035
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:06,341
right?

4036
01:54:06,341 --> 01:54:07,120
You want to know you,

4037
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:07,840
you look good,

4038
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,130
but it's not a bad ego.

4039
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:10,170
It's fun.

4040
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:10,750
You know what I'm saying?

4041
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:11,583
Yeah.

4042
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:16,210
The real problem is when it
gets out of control and toxic,

4043
01:54:16,211 --> 01:54:18,250
then it looks like other people see it.

4044
01:54:18,251 --> 01:54:19,270
And like if you,

4045
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:19,961
you know,

4046
01:54:19,961 --> 01:54:21,460
you see gross,

4047
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,460
just gross behavior,

4048
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:25,570
grow selfishness,

4049
01:54:25,571 --> 01:54:26,770
you see that and you go,

4050
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:27,041
oh,

4051
01:54:27,041 --> 01:54:28,720
that's the bad part of the ego.

4052
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:29,583
That's what I'm seeing.

4053
01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:30,460
Yeah.

4054
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:33,400
But the key is to know which is which.

4055
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:34,450
And that's hard.

4056
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:35,560
It's hard to know which is which,

4057
01:54:35,561 --> 01:54:38,680
which one is the overwhelming
force inside your mind?

4058
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:42,790
Which one is the one that's controlling
your consciousness and your behavior and

4059
01:54:42,791 --> 01:54:43,260
which is,

4060
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:43,920
is it the good ones,

4061
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:44,440
the bad one?

4062
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:47,830
Is it the fun healthy one
or is it the one that is a,

4063
01:54:47,831 --> 01:54:48,664
you know,

4064
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:50,950
completely obsessed with
yourself and only yourself?

4065
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:51,520
Yeah.

4066
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,280
You don't know until you have
these experiences and then the,

4067
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:55,150
the,

4068
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:57,250
the nature of them gets exposed.

4069
01:54:57,251 --> 01:55:00,280
You'd like takes him down to the
roots and you start thinking about,

4070
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:01,690
well where did all this come from?

4071
01:55:01,691 --> 01:55:02,440
Like where is it?

4072
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:02,951
Where's all,

4073
01:55:02,951 --> 01:55:04,120
what's the source of all this?

4074
01:55:04,121 --> 01:55:04,330
Like,

4075
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:06,160
oh there's a validation issue.

4076
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:07,060
There's a this issue,

4077
01:55:07,061 --> 01:55:07,960
there's a trust issue,

4078
01:55:07,961 --> 01:55:08,740
there's a,

4079
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:09,100
you know,

4080
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:10,390
whatever the fuck it is.

4081
01:55:10,391 --> 01:55:15,391
It's swirling out of that in this a
unnatural form to create the negative

4082
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:22,750
behavior that you are
manifesting in your life.

4083
01:55:23,230 --> 01:55:23,681
Like it,

4084
01:55:23,681 --> 01:55:25,030
all of it comes from something.

4085
01:55:25,031 --> 01:55:29,110
And one of the things about psychedelic
experiences is it shut it like it shuts

4086
01:55:29,111 --> 01:55:32,470
the ego off for a second and lets you
stand outside of and go look at the things

4087
01:55:32,471 --> 01:55:32,700
new.

4088
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:34,410
You look at this thing,

4089
01:55:34,411 --> 01:55:34,660
things,

4090
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:35,720
grubs and alia,

4091
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:36,640
it doesn't work.

4092
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:37,331
You know like here's,

4093
01:55:37,331 --> 01:55:38,500
here's the PR for example,

4094
01:55:38,501 --> 01:55:38,771
ego.

4095
01:55:38,771 --> 01:55:39,604
That doesn't work.

4096
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,473
Name dropping.

4097
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,380
Like if you're hanging out
with someone and he's like,

4098
01:55:43,381 --> 01:55:43,561
yeah,

4099
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:45,420
you know Sean Penn was
over my house last night.

4100
01:55:45,421 --> 01:55:45,780
Man,

4101
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:47,050
I'm fucking in Ely.

4102
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:48,030
No.

4103
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:51,330
You know what Jeremy Pivot was just
telling me about that last week.

4104
01:55:51,590 --> 01:55:53,010
Name dropping skinny,

4105
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,073
why that name?

4106
01:55:57,420 --> 01:56:01,200
But like it doesn't really
work but everybody knows
your name dropping and I'll

4107
01:56:01,201 --> 01:56:01,351
be like,

4108
01:56:01,351 --> 01:56:01,531
yeah,

4109
01:56:01,531 --> 01:56:01,671
what?

4110
01:56:01,671 --> 01:56:03,460
I'm Steven Spielberg and are pretty tight.

4111
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:04,500
Like yeah.

4112
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:09,030
But it's one thing like if you told
me you went over Sean Penn's house,

4113
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:09,630
I'd be like,

4114
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:09,871
oh,

4115
01:56:09,871 --> 01:56:10,704
what's he like?

4116
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:13,080
Like then it wouldn't be name dropping.

4117
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:14,221
Like if you did it,

4118
01:56:14,221 --> 01:56:15,054
it wouldn't be namedropping.

4119
01:56:15,150 --> 01:56:18,210
Like if you told me like I was hanging
out with Cha with Sean Penn and I'd be

4120
01:56:18,211 --> 01:56:18,390
like,

4121
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:18,810
oh,

4122
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:19,520
how weird.

4123
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,080
Well because it's the
beginning of a story.

4124
01:56:21,110 --> 01:56:21,380
Yeah.

4125
01:56:21,380 --> 01:56:22,460
I'm not just going to let that,

4126
01:56:22,490 --> 01:56:24,340
let that hang is a followup.

4127
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:24,511
Yeah,

4128
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:25,620
that's not your whole thing.

4129
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:26,340
Yeah.

4130
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:26,641
Right.

4131
01:56:26,641 --> 01:56:30,930
So like comedy is like
name dropping with stories,

4132
01:56:31,290 --> 01:56:32,400
good stories that go with it.

4133
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:33,321
But you know,

4134
01:56:33,321 --> 01:56:38,321
there are comedians that are really like
guileless about just bringing a name in

4135
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:43,690
or bringing up a project they worked on
and you look back at the joke and ego

4136
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,900
could have told that joke without telling
me that a Frank Sinatra was in the

4137
01:56:47,901 --> 01:56:48,830
audience that night.

4138
01:56:48,890 --> 01:56:49,723
Yes,

4139
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:50,623
exactly.

4140
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:51,643
Yeah.

4141
01:56:51,890 --> 01:56:55,970
And I remember Anthony Clarke used to
do that when he was coming up in Boston.

4142
01:56:55,971 --> 01:56:56,840
He was the guy,

4143
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,070
he was the guy,

4144
01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:00,650
the young hot guy in Boston,

4145
01:57:00,700 --> 01:57:01,533
dude.

4146
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:02,870
And I mean that dude,

4147
01:57:02,871 --> 01:57:06,920
you put his name on a marquee and he was
fucking one year out of college and he

4148
01:57:06,921 --> 01:57:10,670
was this cute guy with a southern
accent and the base of El cap on.

4149
01:57:10,671 --> 01:57:15,560
And he was silly and he would fill
up a fucking room and he would just,

4150
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:20,360
and then he started to get some success
and it always found his way in his act.

4151
01:57:20,361 --> 01:57:21,111
He would talk about it.

4152
01:57:21,111 --> 01:57:21,351
Yeah.

4153
01:57:21,351 --> 01:57:21,771
You know,

4154
01:57:21,771 --> 01:57:22,400
uh,

4155
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:26,510
I was talking to this act or when I
was doing Chicago on Broadway and,

4156
01:57:26,511 --> 01:57:27,050
uh,

4157
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:27,261
no,

4158
01:57:27,261 --> 01:57:27,951
not Chicago.

4159
01:57:27,951 --> 01:57:28,161
What,

4160
01:57:28,161 --> 01:57:28,750
what did he do?

4161
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:29,450
Oklahoma,

4162
01:57:29,450 --> 01:57:34,450
he did Oklahoma on Broadway when he
was like 24 years old and you know,

4163
01:57:36,411 --> 01:57:40,370
and then he just started and he got in
with that with the river Phoenix and he

4164
01:57:40,371 --> 01:57:44,060
did like three river Phoenix
movies and he was fucking good.

4165
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:46,100
And then somehow,

4166
01:57:46,570 --> 01:57:47,100
uh,

4167
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,680
he got into the TV route and
didn't follow the filmer,

4168
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:50,180
but he's,

4169
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:51,170
he's a good actor.

4170
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:51,851
Yeah.

4171
01:57:51,851 --> 01:57:56,820
I remember he had Boston common number
that Boston common and that didn't go,

4172
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:57,870
it went for a little while,

4173
01:57:57,871 --> 01:58:00,630
but it got canceled and it was
a show that was all his right.

4174
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:01,650
And then he went to do.

4175
01:58:01,651 --> 01:58:02,484
Yes dear.

4176
01:58:02,610 --> 01:58:02,911
They did?

4177
01:58:02,911 --> 01:58:03,870
Yes dear for a long,

4178
01:58:03,890 --> 01:58:04,723
long time.

4179
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:05,130
No.

4180
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:06,570
Then he did one with Dan Akroyd.

4181
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:06,721
Oh,

4182
01:58:06,721 --> 01:58:07,140
he did?

4183
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:08,760
Where Dan Aykroyd was a priest.

4184
01:58:08,761 --> 01:58:10,110
I maybe they were both priests.

4185
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:10,611
Really?

4186
01:58:10,611 --> 01:58:11,444
Yeah.

4187
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:17,090
That might've been af cause cause
a yes dear was on for a good seven,

4188
01:58:17,101 --> 01:58:17,760
eight years.

4189
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:18,360
Easily.

4190
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:18,900
Forever.

4191
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:19,230
Yeah.

4192
01:58:19,230 --> 01:58:20,063
Yeah.

4193
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,410
Soloman Soloman.

4194
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:23,790
Soloman.

4195
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:24,570
Huh?

4196
01:58:24,570 --> 01:58:26,760
So that dude and his,

4197
01:58:26,761 --> 01:58:31,761
his quote per episode was very high from
the get go and he just kept buying real

4198
01:58:32,491 --> 01:58:33,324
estate.

4199
01:58:34,170 --> 01:58:34,570
Well done.

4200
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:35,700
That's what he does know.

4201
01:58:35,701 --> 01:58:36,534
Right?

4202
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:37,450
I haven't,

4203
01:58:37,450 --> 01:58:38,640
I haven't talked to him in a while.

4204
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:40,110
I think I heard he sells real estate.

4205
01:58:40,111 --> 01:58:40,500
No.

4206
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:41,333
Yeah,

4207
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:43,150
I was like Anthony,

4208
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:47,710
he was a murderer or back in Boston and
we used to see him at Faneuil hall and

4209
01:58:47,711 --> 01:58:49,030
you'd fill that fucking place,

4210
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:51,050
you know the comedy
connection when they moved,

4211
01:58:51,051 --> 01:58:51,701
when Bloomin' right.

4212
01:58:51,701 --> 01:58:54,670
Took over and they moved to the big room
and they moved out of that little tiny

4213
01:58:54,671 --> 01:58:56,440
room and put it in Faneuil hall.

4214
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:00,780
I remember walking through there one
day and Anthony Clark was murder and,

4215
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,990
and I was like,

4216
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:03,220
this is 90% women.

4217
01:59:03,690 --> 01:59:04,523
It's so weird.

4218
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:04,710
Yeah.

4219
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:05,110
At least,

4220
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:05,943
right.

4221
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:06,790
It's all women.

4222
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:07,180
Yeah.

4223
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:07,350
Dude,

4224
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:07,991
I'll come and see him.

4225
01:59:07,991 --> 01:59:08,950
Guys loved them too.

4226
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:09,813
Don't get me wrong.

4227
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:11,350
But women really loved him.

4228
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:12,610
He was so cute,

4229
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:14,040
you know.

4230
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:14,281
Well,

4231
01:59:14,281 --> 01:59:17,700
they say that's the secret to being a
draw is appeal to women because they're

4232
01:59:17,701 --> 01:59:18,930
the ones that decide what to do it.

4233
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:19,820
Yes.

4234
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:20,600
Yeah.

4235
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:21,433
Right.

4236
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:24,260
Like there's not a whole lot of
chicks begging to go to slayer.

4237
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:27,741
Right.

4238
01:59:27,741 --> 01:59:28,574
And if they are,

4239
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:29,390
take them.

4240
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:29,751
That's it.

4241
01:59:29,751 --> 01:59:30,560
That's a good one.

4242
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,130
Yeah.

4243
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:32,720
They want to go see someone cute.

4244
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:36,680
I bet this like probably a
disproportionate number of
chicks going to see aqua

4245
01:59:36,681 --> 01:59:37,514
man.

4246
01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:38,091
I bet.

4247
01:59:38,091 --> 01:59:38,571
If you allow,

4248
01:59:38,571 --> 01:59:38,871
yeah.

4249
01:59:38,871 --> 01:59:39,704
If you looked,

4250
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:44,830
if you looked at the number of women
that want to go see a superhero movie and

4251
01:59:45,201 --> 01:59:45,321
uh,

4252
01:59:45,321 --> 01:59:47,480
the number of women that
want to go see aqua man.

4253
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,081
Yeah.

4254
01:59:48,081 --> 01:59:49,430
It's off the charts.

4255
01:59:49,860 --> 01:59:50,631
Aqua man's favor.

4256
01:59:50,631 --> 01:59:51,530
Someone should do a study.

4257
01:59:52,370 --> 01:59:53,240
That's a handsome man.

4258
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:53,580
Well,

4259
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:54,413
he's his name.

4260
01:59:54,650 --> 01:59:55,483
Jason Momoa.

4261
01:59:55,670 --> 01:59:56,600
He was Badass.

4262
01:59:56,630 --> 01:59:57,463
Game of Thrones.

4263
01:59:57,470 --> 02:00:00,370
He's a beast to super nice guy too.

4264
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:03,140
I met that guy in a whole
foods and nail sweetheart,

4265
02:00:04,190 --> 02:00:05,310
sorta telling you,

4266
02:00:05,311 --> 02:00:06,021
oh sweetheart.

4267
02:00:06,021 --> 02:00:06,860
He is like,

4268
02:00:06,861 --> 02:00:07,694
you're so handsome.

4269
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:09,013
It's confusing.

4270
02:00:09,590 --> 02:00:12,210
So call and beautiful
and [inaudible] feelings,

4271

4272
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:12,770
Yeah.

4273
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:13,603
Leave that guy.

4274
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:14,623
Yeah.

4275
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:15,973
Yeah.

4276
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:17,180
My wife said it best.

4277
02:00:17,181 --> 02:00:18,800
She said he's everybody's type.

4278
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:20,181

Yeah.

Some girls just Jimmy Fallon.

4286
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:32,680
He's everybody's tight

4287
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,030
and he's a giant and
he's got awesome tattoos.

4288
02:00:38,031 --> 02:00:39,140
The fucking Nice Guy.

4289
02:00:39,141 --> 02:00:40,040
Fucking fuck.

4290
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:41,450
Are those his real tattoos?

4291
02:00:41,451 --> 02:00:42,180
I don't believe so.

4292
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:43,640
I think that's just for aqua man.

4293
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:45,020
That's his tattoos for aqua man.

4294
02:00:45,021 --> 02:00:45,980
What are his real tattoos?

4295
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:47,390
He's got a gang of real tattoos.

4296
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,700
The forearm ones.

4297
02:00:49,701 --> 02:00:51,080
I think this is real tattoos.

4298
02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:52,093
Yeah.

4299
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:52,881
Boy,

4300
02:00:52,881 --> 02:00:55,760
that takes some time and makeup because
if he's doing a role where they don't

4301
02:00:55,761 --> 02:00:56,594
want that,

4302
02:00:57,380 --> 02:00:59,630
that's a lot of time covering
that shit up every day.

4303
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:01,710
I think they have to
cover up shit with him.

4304
02:01:01,770 --> 02:01:02,603
Yeah,

4305
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:03,810
it was just that,

4306
02:01:03,811 --> 02:01:04,621
that beautiful face.

4307
02:01:04,621 --> 02:01:08,700
Get on screen that all those
damp and panties do the talk and

4308
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:13,530
see you again tomorrow,

4309
02:01:13,531 --> 02:01:13,890
man.

4310
02:01:13,890 --> 02:01:15,030
Whew.

4311
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:15,690
Yeah.

4312
02:01:15,690 --> 02:01:16,560
Girls are going to that movie.

4313
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:17,700
It's like a crane.

4314
02:01:17,740 --> 02:01:20,790
It's like a porn theater in Times
Square in the 70s for women's.

4315
02:01:20,791 --> 02:01:22,110
Probably like slipping there,

4316
02:01:22,111 --> 02:01:22,944
hands down,

4317
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:26,610
moisture in the air and yourself
off all these little heaters.

4318
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:28,710
When you're walking at cheaters,

4319
02:01:28,770 --> 02:01:30,060
your feet are stuck on the floor.

4320
02:01:30,061 --> 02:01:31,530
You think it's the popcorn butter?

4321
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:32,100
Nope.

4322
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:32,933
Nope,

4323
02:01:33,390 --> 02:01:34,223
nope.

4324
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:35,150
Yeah.

4325
02:01:35,150 --> 02:01:35,520
Um,

4326
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,780
how do we get on subject to him,

4327
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:38,813
aqua man

4328
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:41,930
girls deciding what to go see it,

4329
02:01:41,931 --> 02:01:42,260
right?

4330
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:42,441
Yeah.

4331
02:01:42,441 --> 02:01:43,191
Girls would be,

4332
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:43,671
they'd be like,

4333
02:01:43,671 --> 02:01:44,000
yeah,

4334
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:44,930
let's go see aqua man.

4335
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,231
You'd be like,

4336
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:45,681
wait a minute though.

4337
02:01:45,681 --> 02:01:46,730
You hate superhero movies,

4338
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,350
whatever you want to go.

4339
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,333
Yeah.

4340
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:53,630
She wants to stare at
tasting them all off.

4341
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:55,253
You're right.

4342
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:58,010
He is pretty beautiful.

4343
02:01:58,080 --> 02:01:58,940
We watched him on screen,

4344
02:01:58,970 --> 02:01:59,420
dammit.

4345
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:00,020
Yeah.

4346
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:00,840
Shit.

4347
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:01,670
Can't hate her.

4348
02:02:01,670 --> 02:02:02,510
He thinks some lemon.

4349
02:02:02,511 --> 02:02:03,590
Watch MMA for that reason.

4350
02:02:03,591 --> 02:02:04,550
I think some guys are cute.

4351
02:02:05,190 --> 02:02:06,023
Yeah.

4352
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:07,190
Fuck yeah.

4353
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:07,971
Not only cute,

4354
02:02:07,971 --> 02:02:08,840
but savages.

4355
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:09,703
Right?

4356
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:13,460
I mean the number of women with a

4357
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:19,590
sketchy childhoods that are attracted
to MMA fighters off the charts.

4358
02:02:19,591 --> 02:02:20,424
Yeah.

4359
02:02:20,570 --> 02:02:23,420
I want to say that in a very
polite way is pled as I could say.

4360
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:27,110
I think even regular women,

4361
02:02:27,111 --> 02:02:27,980
I think like lawyers,

4362
02:02:27,981 --> 02:02:32,270
like buttoned down women see a cause
there are ran neutered men all day.

4363
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:32,561
Yeah.

4364
02:02:32,561 --> 02:02:35,340
You're around a guy like you
know Luke Rockhold is no,

4365
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:36,291
it might be better.

4366
02:02:36,291 --> 02:02:39,080
Look in the Jason Ma and he's a UFC.

4367
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:40,760
He was middleweight champion.

4368
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:42,823
Beautiful.

4369
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:43,851
Six foot three,

4370
02:02:43,851 --> 02:02:44,511
six foot four,

4371
02:02:44,511 --> 02:02:45,231
somewhere in that range.

4372
02:02:45,231 --> 02:02:46,640
Plan features looks like a model.

4373
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:48,290
Handsome was fuck God.

4374
02:02:48,291 --> 02:02:50,240
I want to say hell yeah.

4375
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:51,193
Ass Kicker.

4376
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:52,470
That's not the best picture of him,

4377
02:02:52,471 --> 02:02:52,641
Bro.

4378
02:02:52,641 --> 02:02:53,390
That's kind of gets,

4379
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:55,880
that's after I've seen before.

4380
02:02:55,881 --> 02:02:56,714
If it's a beast,

4381
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:59,250
but point is uh,

4382
02:02:59,460 --> 02:03:01,940
there's Garol and t go
that one above what?

4383
02:03:01,941 --> 02:03:02,631
The blue shorts on.

4384
02:03:02,631 --> 02:03:04,460
What you see is a look
at that handsome bastard.

4385
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:06,260
Look at him.

4386
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:06,651
Yeah.

4387
02:03:06,651 --> 02:03:07,730
He's got a good build.

4388
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:09,470
That's the kind of build my wife likes.

4389
02:03:09,471 --> 02:03:11,060
She doesn't like it too big.

4390
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:13,220
Shakes likes like me and him slow down.

4391
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:14,360
You and him are the same.

4392
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:15,793
The fuck

4393
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:19,730
I just short girls are
watching that guy though.

4394
02:03:19,731 --> 02:03:19,971
Like,

4395
02:03:19,971 --> 02:03:20,241
okay,

4396
02:03:20,241 --> 02:03:20,841
here's another one.

4397
02:03:20,841 --> 02:03:22,550
George Saint Pierre hundred percent.

4398
02:03:22,551 --> 02:03:23,810
Look at that beautiful body.

4399
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:24,351
Oh yeah.

4400
02:03:24,351 --> 02:03:25,880
George Saint Pierre is beautiful.

4401
02:03:26,590 --> 02:03:30,030
Like George Saint Pierre Literally
has to beat women away from them

4402
02:03:31,730 --> 02:03:33,170
because they're five from me.

4403
02:03:33,171 --> 02:03:34,130
I'm busy.

4404
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:35,450
I am busy.

4405
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:36,381
Go to that picture up there.

4406
02:03:36,381 --> 02:03:37,250
We're just throwing a punch.

4407
02:03:38,570 --> 02:03:39,403
The one right there.

4408
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:40,130
Look at that.

4409
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:42,740
I mean you don't think girls would be
begging to have that inside of them.

4410
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:45,921
I was a woman.

4411
02:03:45,921 --> 02:03:49,010
If I was a heterosexual woman and
I saw that guy and he was like,

4412
02:03:49,011 --> 02:03:50,090
would you like a drink?

4413
02:03:50,091 --> 02:03:50,421
I'd be like,

4414
02:03:50,421 --> 02:03:51,350
fuck yes,

4415
02:03:51,351 --> 02:03:52,160
I'd like a drink.

4416
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:52,490
Yeah.

4417
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:53,810
God Damn you savage.

4418
02:03:53,811 --> 02:03:54,550
Let's do this.

4419
02:03:54,550 --> 02:03:54,700
Yeah,

4420
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:55,351
I want to drank.

4421
02:03:55,351 --> 02:03:56,420
Can we have it after you?

4422
02:03:56,421 --> 02:03:57,020
Fuck me.

4423
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:57,290
Yeah.

4424
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:58,101
I don't want to get too drunk.

4425
02:03:58,101 --> 02:03:59,120
I want to feel it still.

4426
02:03:59,780 --> 02:04:00,613
Woo.

4427
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:01,483
Yeah,

4428
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:03,740
and they go after it.

4429
02:04:03,790 --> 02:04:05,270
The I or some of the players?

4430
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:06,133
Some of the fighters.

4431
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:06,290
Oh,

4432
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:07,360
I don't want to talk about that.

4433
02:04:07,790 --> 02:04:10,490
How dare you kiss and tell,

4434
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:13,880
but it's when other thing is
interesting is female fighters.

4435
02:04:14,030 --> 02:04:14,510
Right?

4436
02:04:14,510 --> 02:04:18,350
That I was reading a story
about a husband who's white,

4437
02:04:18,351 --> 02:04:19,071
who's a trainer,

4438
02:04:19,071 --> 02:04:19,401
I think,

4439
02:04:19,401 --> 02:04:23,030
and his wife was a boxer and I
was reading the story about him,

4440
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:25,130
like his experience,

4441
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:27,800
like bringing her to the ring,

4442
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:28,660
like getting her,

4443
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:33,150
his wife is in there and she's going to
knuckle up with some other chicken shit

4444
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,880
and maybe get really fucking hurt.

4445
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:35,510
Yeah.

4446
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,280
And to be there while
this is all happening.

4447
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:40,100
That's a wild,

4448
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:41,330
that's a wild life.

4449
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:44,540
A female fighter is a wild creature.

4450
02:04:44,810 --> 02:04:46,220
You gotta think of male fighter.

4451
02:04:46,221 --> 02:04:48,230
It's like almost all boys,

4452
02:04:48,830 --> 02:04:53,830
somewhere in the back of their head have
this ridiculous fantasy of being able

4453
02:04:54,141 --> 02:04:55,220
to fuck everybody up.

4454
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:56,060
Like,

4455
02:04:56,060 --> 02:04:56,893
come on bitch.

4456
02:04:57,110 --> 02:04:57,351
You know,

4457
02:04:57,351 --> 02:05:00,590
fight a bunch of people like Goddamn
Chuck Norris Movie Karate Kick People.

4458
02:05:00,591 --> 02:05:01,424
That would be cool.

4459
02:05:01,670 --> 02:05:03,210
It's just the reality of
learning how to do that.

4460
02:05:03,211 --> 02:05:03,470
It's like,

4461
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:03,830
oh,

4462
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:04,670
I don't want to do that.

4463
02:05:04,671 --> 02:05:05,660
That's too much.

4464
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:07,400
It's too dangerous to scare.

4465
02:05:07,401 --> 02:05:08,061
Fuck this.

4466
02:05:08,061 --> 02:05:09,170
And most people don't do it.

4467
02:05:09,890 --> 02:05:12,470
But for women to have that,

4468
02:05:12,471 --> 02:05:16,850
it's probably way more rare to have
this desire to secretly fuck people up.

4469
02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:18,140
Probably way more rare.

4470
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:19,160
Maybe like,

4471
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:22,150
let's be generous and say 20% of the,

4472
02:05:22,151 --> 02:05:26,840
the number that men would want to fuck
people are maybe 20% of that is like the

4473
02:05:26,841 --> 02:05:27,920
number that would be women.

4474
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:30,080
So then how many of
them go through with it?

4475
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:30,530
Yeah.

4476
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:34,910
How many of them go through with it and
get to be like a cat Zingano or get to

4477
02:05:34,911 --> 02:05:37,280
be like an Amanda Nunez like Jesus Christ.

4478
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:39,200
If that number is so small,

4479
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:41,720
so small in terms of
like general population,

4480
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:44,330
those are some wild humans.

4481
02:05:44,331 --> 02:05:44,790
Yeah.

4482
02:05:44,790 --> 02:05:48,560
If they get to that stage where they're
fighting in a fucking cage for a living,

4483
02:05:48,910 --> 02:05:49,690
whoa.

4484
02:05:49,690 --> 02:05:50,390
Yeah.

4485
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:51,530
Someone like Holly Holm,

4486
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:54,290
like that is a crazy way to make a living.

4487
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:55,153
Yeah.

4488
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:55,941
Yeah.

4489
02:05:55,941 --> 02:05:57,420
Now you've got to think
if they make it that far,

4490
02:05:57,421 --> 02:05:59,290
they're even more vicious
than men because they've,

4491
02:05:59,320 --> 02:05:59,800
they've,

4492
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:00,131
you know,

4493
02:06:00,131 --> 02:06:00,301
they,

4494
02:06:00,301 --> 02:06:02,710
there's such a social taboo for them.

4495
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:03,431
For men,

4496
02:06:03,431 --> 02:06:03,850
it's like,

4497
02:06:03,850 --> 02:06:03,971
oh,

4498
02:06:03,971 --> 02:06:04,781
that's bad ass.

4499
02:06:04,781 --> 02:06:05,620
You're an MMA fighter.

4500
02:06:05,621 --> 02:06:06,454
But for women,

4501
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:09,370
everybody just thinks it's weird and
they think there's something wrong with

4502
02:06:09,371 --> 02:06:09,610
you.

4503
02:06:09,610 --> 02:06:09,791
Well,

4504
02:06:09,791 --> 02:06:11,050
it's become more acceptable,

4505
02:06:11,051 --> 02:06:12,190
but it's still terrifying,

4506
02:06:12,250 --> 02:06:13,810
especially for men that don't train,

4507
02:06:14,110 --> 02:06:17,470
like to wait for a man who doesn't
train and he's like around Misha Tate,

4508
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:18,640
she's really hot.

4509
02:06:18,641 --> 02:06:19,860
And she had also fucked people.

4510
02:06:19,870 --> 02:06:20,320
Like,

4511
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:21,390
Ooh,

4512
02:06:21,550 --> 02:06:22,030
yeah.

4513
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:23,140
They get weirded out.

4514
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:27,310
Like imagine that girl could fuck you
up like she's hot and she could fuck you

4515
02:06:27,311 --> 02:06:28,144
up.

4516
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:29,623
That's not nice.

4517
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:31,640
Some guys probably love that.

4518
02:06:31,641 --> 02:06:35,660
People like that bondage with
are tied up and overpowered.

4519
02:06:35,690 --> 02:06:39,290
But what are the odds that a girl who
knows what the fuck people up is looking

4520
02:06:39,291 --> 02:06:39,411
for?

4521
02:06:39,411 --> 02:06:42,260
That kind of guy at almost zero.

4522
02:06:42,290 --> 02:06:42,741
Yeah,

4523
02:06:42,741 --> 02:06:43,490
that's true.

4524
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:44,080
Those girls,

4525
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:47,900
it doesn't line up Luke Rockhold to
in and get stuff by another alpha.

4526
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:49,700
That would be a good porn movie.

4527
02:06:49,701 --> 02:06:50,520
Right.

4528
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:51,353
Shit,

4529
02:06:52,190 --> 02:06:54,700
I would go for day to do his bank.

4530
02:06:54,701 --> 02:06:55,910
It like Luke Rockhold,

4531
02:06:55,911 --> 02:07:00,620
you chew a lot of porn in bank and then
have it released after he's retired from

4532
02:07:00,621 --> 02:07:01,370
his career.

4533
02:07:01,370 --> 02:07:01,690
Yeah.

4534
02:07:01,690 --> 02:07:01,960
You know,

4535
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:03,290
cause right now it's just
going to get in the way.

4536
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:03,710
Yeah.

4537
02:07:03,710 --> 02:07:04,760
It's going to be a distraction,

4538
02:07:05,870 --> 02:07:08,450
but he knows that's his 401k my porn.

4539
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:11,273
Yeah.

4540
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:12,613
Um,

4541
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:14,681
yeah,

4542
02:07:14,681 --> 02:07:15,514
it's uh,

4543
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:18,790
the numbers of women that
become elite fighters.

4544
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:21,160
W I wonder what it is in
terms of like the amount,

4545
02:07:21,161 --> 02:07:25,030
the try it and then the amount
that become fully successful.

4546
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:27,610
I bet it's a tiny,

4547
02:07:27,611 --> 02:07:30,340
tiny percentage like to
get all the way through.

4548
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:31,713
Like how many,

4549
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:33,430
like how many men,

4550
02:07:33,431 --> 02:07:33,851
when you,

4551
02:07:33,851 --> 02:07:34,601
when you were growing up,

4552
02:07:34,601 --> 02:07:35,434
how many,

4553
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,010
uh,

4554
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:40,950
either wanted to learn how to
box or wrestle or do some kind of

4555
02:07:41,170 --> 02:07:42,170
a lot of wrestlers.

4556
02:07:42,171 --> 02:07:42,560
Yeah.

4557
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:43,140
Yeah.

4558
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:44,600
I mean it was a school sport.

4559
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:47,390
There was taekwondo and
there was wrestling.

4560
02:07:47,391 --> 02:07:49,130
Those were pretty much
the only forms that I,

4561
02:07:49,190 --> 02:07:49,701
that I saw.

4562
02:07:49,701 --> 02:07:51,140
We didn't have boxing in my town,

4563
02:07:51,290 --> 02:07:53,360
but a lot of kids you knew were into it,

4564
02:07:53,361 --> 02:07:53,540
right?

4565
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:54,110
Oh yeah.

4566
02:07:54,110 --> 02:07:54,530
Yeah.

4567
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:55,363
How many girls?

4568
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:00,010
I can't think of any.

4569
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:01,213
Super rare,

4570
02:08:01,430 --> 02:08:04,400
but the martial arts classes
did have a lot of girls.

4571
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:05,630
It's kind of interesting.

4572
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:06,650
It was a good number.

4573
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:07,640
It wasn't half,

4574
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,340
but it might've been 20%.

4575
02:08:10,570 --> 02:08:10,791
Yeah.

4576
02:08:10,791 --> 02:08:14,060
It might be 20% women that were in those
classes cause they wanted to learn self

4577
02:08:14,061 --> 02:08:14,720
defense,

4578
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:15,553
you know?

4579
02:08:16,140 --> 02:08:16,610
Okay.

4580
02:08:16,610 --> 02:08:21,230
I put my daughter in taekwondo
just she wasn't that into it,

4581
02:08:21,231 --> 02:08:22,370
but I go just do a year.

4582
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:26,930
Just to give you some sense of
facing somebody if a fight happens.

4583
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:27,840
Yeah,

4584
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:30,860
and some sense of what it's like to
struggle with someone physically there

4585
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:31,200
moving.

4586
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:31,981
You've got to move with them.

4587
02:08:31,981 --> 02:08:32,814
You got to,

4588
02:08:33,390 --> 02:08:34,770
the older you are,

4589
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:35,830
when you start learning that,

4590
02:08:35,870 --> 02:08:38,220
the more difficult it is to
incorporate it into your,

4591
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:39,360
the way you think about things.

4592
02:08:39,390 --> 02:08:39,770
Right.

4593
02:08:39,770 --> 02:08:40,561
I think when you're young,

4594
02:08:40,561 --> 02:08:42,750
if you have some experience
with martial arts,

4595
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:46,920
you'll be more calm and confident if
something happens when you get older.

4596
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:47,280
Right.

4597
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,480
You're already your bodies.

4598
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,760
You develop knowing how to move that way.

4599
02:08:50,910 --> 02:08:51,420
Yeah.

4600
02:08:51,420 --> 02:08:55,050
When you were already like kind of set
in your ways and you're injured and

4601
02:08:55,051 --> 02:08:57,240
you're old and then someone
wants to teach you a wheel kick,

4602
02:08:57,241 --> 02:08:57,450
like,

4603
02:08:57,450 --> 02:08:58,140
oh Christ.

4604
02:08:58,140 --> 02:08:58,660
Yeah.

4605
02:08:58,660 --> 02:08:59,281
I like this.

4606
02:08:59,281 --> 02:09:00,570
No way my body's going to do that.

4607
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:02,100
My body has move like that.

4608
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:02,670
Yeah.

4609
02:09:02,670 --> 02:09:05,590
It's like you being able
to do backflips click.

4610
02:09:05,591 --> 02:09:08,010
You could still do a back load your body,

4611
02:09:08,011 --> 02:09:09,810
learn how to do that when you were young.

4612
02:09:09,870 --> 02:09:10,200
Yup.

4613
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:12,210
It gets in there that programs in there

4614
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:12,960
and there's a,

4615
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:17,100
there's a moment of faith when you do a
back flip where when you go up you have

4616
02:09:17,101 --> 02:09:18,990
to go up before you go back.

4617
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:22,560
And that's the first mistake and
the constant mistake is people,

4618
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:27,270
people go to do a backflip and they lunge
backwards and they land in their head,

4619
02:09:27,271 --> 02:09:30,930
but you really have to trust that
you have to shoot your hands up,

4620
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:31,913
not back,

4621
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:33,870
and then you pull it in,

4622
02:09:34,190 --> 02:09:35,850
go over damn scary.

4623
02:09:35,910 --> 02:09:37,230
And that's like that with the,

4624
02:09:37,231 --> 02:09:37,350
yeah.

4625
02:09:37,350 --> 02:09:40,680
I'm sure with martial arts is this
moves it or does a moment of faith.

4626
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:41,950
When I don't,

4627
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:45,730
I mean for a long time then I tried to
do a a turning side kick on the heavy

4628
02:09:45,731 --> 02:09:46,300
bag.

4629
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:47,140
There's like a moment like,

4630
02:09:47,141 --> 02:09:47,441
okay,

4631
02:09:47,441 --> 02:09:48,161
I'm going to hit this thing.

4632
02:09:48,161 --> 02:09:48,880
Right.

4633
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:49,713
What am I doing here?

4634
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:50,560
Yes.

4635
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:50,920
Okay.

4636
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:53,470
Ready and turn watch drops off.

4637
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:53,890
Oh,

4638
02:09:53,890 --> 02:09:54,723
I just dropped.

4639
02:09:55,240 --> 02:09:56,470
It's big ass knife.

4640
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:57,320
Shit.

4641
02:09:57,320 --> 02:09:58,570
That's not good to have
around right there.

4642
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:03,220
What am I 12 keep this big
giant knife on the table.

4643
02:10:03,970 --> 02:10:04,271
But yeah,

4644
02:10:04,271 --> 02:10:04,720
when I,

4645
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:05,560
when I do it today,

4646
02:10:05,561 --> 02:10:06,150
to this day,

4647
02:10:06,150 --> 02:10:08,500
I have to do it slow a couple
of times and get the feel of it.

4648
02:10:08,501 --> 02:10:08,710
Yeah,

4649
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:10,810
I haven't trained in
a while and then then,

4650
02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:12,010
then it becomes a normal thing.

4651
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:12,893
Right.

4652
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:13,271
But man,

4653
02:10:13,271 --> 02:10:14,950
it's hell on your fucking knees.

4654
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:16,810
I got a new knee thing going on,

4655
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:21,040
like the Za the third time I've had
to get stem cells injected into this

4656
02:10:21,041 --> 02:10:21,760
meniscus tear.

4657
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:22,750
I got to school really?

4658
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:22,910
Hey,

4659
02:10:22,910 --> 02:10:27,570
this little tiny meniscus tear
and it develops into assist.

4660
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:28,510
Uh,

4661
02:10:28,510 --> 02:10:28,751
the,

4662
02:10:28,751 --> 02:10:29,291
the tear,

4663
02:10:29,291 --> 02:10:32,380
we've hit it with stem cells a few
times and it doesn't give me any pain

4664
02:10:32,381 --> 02:10:32,801
anymore,

4665
02:10:32,801 --> 02:10:36,230
but assist keeps developing
in that area and it assists,

4666
02:10:36,231 --> 02:10:39,740
has to get punctured and drain
is getting smaller and smaller.

4667
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:42,740
It happened three different
times or how to get it drained.

4668
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:47,750
And the last time was a few days ago
and it was the smallest it's ever been,

4669
02:10:47,751 --> 02:10:49,460
but still fucking annoying.

4670
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:50,870
But you're still running.

4671
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:52,033
Yup.

4672
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:53,090
It doesn't hurt when you run.

4673
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:56,360
I'm taking time off right now and taking
a little bit of time off right now.

4674
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:58,390
I'm going to tell you a
couple of weeks off and a,

4675
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:01,220
I'm going to run at a slower pace,

4676
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:02,870
skip the dog some exercise,

4677
02:11:03,170 --> 02:11:05,660
and I'm going to be more
just more cautious about it.

4678
02:11:05,661 --> 02:11:06,680
Not going to push myself.

4679
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:11,180
I'm trying to figure out what it is I'm
doing that's causing this sis to recur.

4680
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:14,920
I think it's just overall pounding of the,

4681
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:16,130
the hill running,

4682
02:11:16,131 --> 02:11:17,870
kicking the bag and all that shit.

4683
02:11:17,890 --> 02:11:18,260
Yeah.

4684
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:19,041
I need to,

4685
02:11:19,041 --> 02:11:19,430
uh,

4686
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:23,390
let it fully set in before I
go back to doing that shit.

4687
02:11:23,391 --> 02:11:25,070
So I'm just doing a bunch
of other different stuff.

4688
02:11:25,071 --> 02:11:25,340
Now.

4689
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:27,440
A lot of yoga is the cryogenics help.

4690
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:28,460
Um,

4691
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:29,540
it'll help someone,

4692
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:29,841
you know,

4693
02:11:29,841 --> 02:11:32,510
what would cryogenics is really
good for is first of all,

4694
02:11:32,511 --> 02:11:33,740
it's really good for your mood.

4695
02:11:34,090 --> 02:11:34,400
Uh,

4696
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:35,960
if you've never done it before,

4697
02:11:36,050 --> 02:11:39,350
the best kind are the kind where
you get your whole body in there,

4698
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:41,360
not just your neck down the neck.

4699
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:42,194
Down is okay.

4700
02:11:42,350 --> 02:11:43,580
It's definitely better than nothing,

4701
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:48,910
but the real feeling is when your
head's under and your whole body is like

4702
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:53,930
immersed in this air that's
cooled by liquid nitrogen,

4703
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:56,060
it's fucking for raising.

4704
02:11:56,060 --> 02:11:56,741
Dude have,

4705
02:11:56,741 --> 02:11:57,860
you've done it now,

4706
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:58,820
today.

4707
02:11:58,820 --> 02:11:59,640
Let's do it today.

4708
02:11:59,640 --> 02:11:59,831
He,

4709
02:11:59,831 --> 02:12:00,260
I'll do it.

4710
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:00,800
We'll do it today.

4711
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:01,161
Okay.

4712
02:12:01,161 --> 02:12:01,994
We can do it today.

4713
02:12:02,270 --> 02:12:03,030
You're going to love it.

4714
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:03,220
It's,

4715
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:04,520
it's a freak out man.

4716
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:05,510
It's a freak out.

4717
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:06,591
How long did you stay in?

4718
02:12:06,591 --> 02:12:07,424
40 minutes.

4719
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:10,700
And then I stay out for 10 minutes
and then I do another three minutes.

4720
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:12,020
Damn.

4721
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:12,560
Yeah.

4722
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:15,320
You feel amazing afterwards
and they'll fix my knee.

4723
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:16,100
Well,

4724
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:16,933
won't fix it.

4725
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:18,290
It'll reduce inflammation now.

4726
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:19,470
But norepinephrine,

4727
02:12:19,490 --> 02:12:20,031
that's what it's called,

4728
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:20,300
right?

4729
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:21,290
Is that the word?

4730
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:23,173
Sure.

4731
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:24,410
Um,

4732
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:28,070
that stuff gets radically
boosted in your brain.

4733
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:30,080
It helps a lot of people with arthritis.

4734
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:31,430
A lot of people have,

4735
02:12:31,431 --> 02:12:31,700
um,

4736
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:33,020
a lot of inflammation.

4737
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:34,570
It helps him is that
I say I said it right.

4738
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:35,600
Um,

4739
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:36,500
it ramps that shit up.

4740
02:12:36,501 --> 02:12:38,450
You feel so good when you
get out of there like woo.

4741
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:39,470
It lasts a while to,

4742
02:12:39,820 --> 02:12:41,320
ah,

4743
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:42,680
you're just freezing to death.

4744
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:45,140
You are freezing to death.

4745
02:12:45,141 --> 02:12:46,370
You are on your way to death.

4746
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:47,810
And he stepped out of it and you're like,

4747
02:12:47,811 --> 02:12:48,680
wow.

4748
02:12:48,710 --> 02:12:49,071
And it just,

4749
02:12:49,071 --> 02:12:49,940
everything just feels,

4750
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:52,761
yeah,

4751
02:12:52,761 --> 02:12:53,780
it feels good man.

4752
02:12:53,781 --> 02:12:54,650
It feels good.

4753
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:55,550
Yeah,

4754
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:56,091
I saw him.

4755
02:12:56,091 --> 02:12:58,220
I fucking love swimming in cold water.

4756
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:01,460
It's amazing for you the way
you feel when you get out too.

4757
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:02,780
But here's the thing,

4758
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:03,590
um,

4759
02:13:03,590 --> 02:13:08,590
it's not the best thing to do if
you're trying to gain muscle weight.

4760
02:13:10,490 --> 02:13:12,980
You have to wait a while
after the exercise.

4761
02:13:12,981 --> 02:13:14,620
Like there's apparently there's,

4762
02:13:14,621 --> 02:13:18,170
there's a bunch of different studies and
I know Andy Galpin has been involved in

4763
02:13:18,171 --> 02:13:19,490
a bunch of these studies and Rhonda,

4764
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:22,010
Patrick has discussed some
of this research as well.

4765
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:22,861
But what,

4766
02:13:22,861 --> 02:13:22,990
uh,

4767
02:13:22,990 --> 02:13:26,030
what happens is there's a window
of time after you lift weights.

4768
02:13:26,031 --> 02:13:26,151
We,

4769
02:13:26,151 --> 02:13:31,151
you should just leave your body alone and
not ice anything and that this is more

4770
02:13:32,371 --> 02:13:37,371
beneficial to gaining
strength and explosiveness
and mass and stuff like that.

4771
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:39,990
But that after a window of time,

4772
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:45,020
then it's beneficial to get into the fro
the ice bath or to do cryo or something

4773
02:13:46,231 --> 02:13:46,740
like that.

4774
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:51,740
But you want to give yourself your body
a period of time to physiologically

4775
02:13:52,501 --> 02:13:53,670
adjust to the work.

4776
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:56,160
Like your body knows what's happened.

4777
02:13:56,580 --> 02:13:56,701
Oh,

4778
02:13:56,701 --> 02:13:58,080
Greg did dead lifts today.

4779
02:13:58,590 --> 02:13:59,190
Okay.

4780
02:13:59,190 --> 02:13:59,611
Okay.

4781
02:13:59,611 --> 02:13:59,911
Okay.

4782
02:13:59,911 --> 02:14:01,650
We got all the way to
get everything in place,

4783
02:14:01,651 --> 02:14:01,910
get it.

4784
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:03,540
But if you freeze it right there,

4785
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:06,250
then it has an effect on the overall,

4786
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:07,590
and I might be butchering this,

4787
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:11,430
but I think it has effect on the overall
amount of gains that you can make.

4788
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:12,293
Okay.

4789
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,550
Because your body's not
sending the chemicals to the,

4790
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:16,760
the way it would see
if you could find out.

4791
02:14:16,761 --> 02:14:17,540
That's true.

4792
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:18,373
Um,

4793
02:14:18,410 --> 02:14:19,243
that's uh,

4794
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:20,780
figured out how to Google that one.

4795
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:22,040
How do you agree with that one?

4796
02:14:23,030 --> 02:14:23,271
Yeah.

4797
02:14:23,271 --> 02:14:24,260
Post workout,

4798
02:14:24,360 --> 02:14:25,010
um,

4799
02:14:25,010 --> 02:14:28,790
cryo therapy and hypertrophy
cause that's what they're,

4800
02:14:29,570 --> 02:14:31,200
that's what they're trying to uh,

4801
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:31,870
Dick,

4802
02:14:31,870 --> 02:14:34,700
they were trying to figure out whether
or not it's beneficial or not in that

4803
02:14:34,701 --> 02:14:35,534
case.

4804
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:40,880
So they think that it's really good for
the mood and it's really good for people

4805
02:14:40,881 --> 02:14:42,410
with joint issues.

4806
02:14:42,411 --> 02:14:44,330
A lot of the folks that go there,

4807
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:49,540
they have like a back surgery or back
issues and it gives them a lot of relief.

4808
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:51,020
And you can do it every day too.

4809
02:14:51,021 --> 02:14:52,130
Cause it's only three minutes.

4810
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:54,560
The thing about something
like that is it's not,

4811
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:56,420
it's not like any other kind of therapy.

4812
02:14:56,421 --> 02:14:56,571
Like,

4813
02:14:56,571 --> 02:14:57,650
you can't do it any longer.

4814
02:14:57,680 --> 02:14:59,510
It's not like you're being a pussy
because you're only doing it for three

4815
02:14:59,511 --> 02:15:00,320
minutes.

4816
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:00,561
Bitch.

4817
02:15:00,561 --> 02:15:03,200
You can't even do three minutes the first
time you go in there at two minutes,

4818
02:15:03,201 --> 02:15:03,411
you're like,

4819
02:15:03,411 --> 02:15:04,244
fuck this.

4820
02:15:04,390 --> 02:15:04,990
Yeah.

4821
02:15:04,990 --> 02:15:06,230
Oh my God.

4822
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:06,690
Yeah.

4823
02:15:06,690 --> 02:15:07,161
Two minutes.

4824
02:15:07,161 --> 02:15:08,120
You're probably ready to bail,

4825
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:10,430
but then your body will get used to
it and then you can do three minutes.

4826
02:15:10,431 --> 02:15:12,230
But it's a,

4827
02:15:12,231 --> 02:15:13,280
it's very controversial,

4828
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:14,990
especially because a woman died.

4829
02:15:15,650 --> 02:15:16,700
There was [inaudible] Vegas.

4830
02:15:16,701 --> 02:15:17,031
Yeah.

4831
02:15:17,031 --> 02:15:20,210
A woman in Vegas was
operating it herself and uh,

4832
02:15:20,211 --> 02:15:25,211
apparently she was not in the right
height and the liquid nitrogen was getting

4833
02:15:26,901 --> 02:15:27,440
into her,

4834
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:28,011
her lungs.

4835
02:15:28,011 --> 02:15:31,280
She was breathing it in and she passed
out and she passed out and froze to

4836
02:15:31,281 --> 02:15:32,060
death.

4837
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:32,720
Wow.

4838
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:33,050
Yeah.

4839
02:15:33,050 --> 02:15:33,883
Terrifying.

4840
02:15:34,140 --> 02:15:34,430
They,

4841
02:15:34,430 --> 02:15:35,360
she had,

4842
02:15:35,420 --> 02:15:36,140
uh,

4843
02:15:36,140 --> 02:15:36,500
again,

4844
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:40,150
I think the story was that she
had worked there and you know,

4845
02:15:40,250 --> 02:15:45,250
she was after hours just doing therapy
on herself and she fucking fell asleep in

4846
02:15:45,861 --> 02:15:46,694
there.

4847
02:15:47,210 --> 02:15:48,680
He should never do that by herself.

4848
02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:50,400
If you do it at a reputable place.

4849
02:15:50,401 --> 02:15:52,670
So always be someone standing
by watching while you're in.

4850
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:54,530
They stand outside the door.

4851
02:15:54,531 --> 02:15:55,460
While you're inside of it.

4852
02:15:56,450 --> 02:15:57,410
It's scary though,

4853
02:15:57,920 --> 02:15:59,090
because you realize when you're in there,

4854
02:15:59,091 --> 02:15:59,361
you're like,

4855
02:15:59,361 --> 02:16:00,350
this is a,

4856
02:16:00,740 --> 02:16:03,920
this is something you can't
survive for that long.

4857
02:16:04,010 --> 02:16:05,450
You can survive it for a few minutes,

4858
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:10,400
but you're literally exposing yourself
to something that is 100% fatal if you

4859
02:16:10,401 --> 02:16:11,040
stay in it.

4860
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:11,873
Yeah,

4861
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:12,241
no,

4862
02:16:12,241 --> 02:16:13,170
it's like cold water.

4863
02:16:13,650 --> 02:16:15,360
You don't have to be
in freezing cold water.

4864
02:16:15,361 --> 02:16:20,361
They say the amount of hours
you can survive in water
is like surprisingly warm.

4865
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:22,810
Yeah.

4866
02:16:22,810 --> 02:16:23,251
It fits.

4867
02:16:23,251 --> 02:16:25,290
Like in the forties,

4868
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:27,810
you can die after a couple hours.

4869
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:29,350
I'm throwing numbers out,

4870
02:16:29,351 --> 02:16:30,010
but

4871
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:34,540
not surprising that getting wet is one
of the most dangerous things that can

4872
02:16:34,541 --> 02:16:36,730
ever happen to you if you were
in the winter in the mountains.

4873
02:16:36,731 --> 02:16:37,120
Yeah.

4874
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,290
It's one of the most dangerous things.

4875
02:16:38,291 --> 02:16:39,190
We fall into water.

4876
02:16:39,490 --> 02:16:42,550
They actually have a rewarming
drills that they teach people,

4877
02:16:42,551 --> 02:16:46,540
particularly soldiers and a outdoorsman
that are interested in this shit.

4878
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:49,030
My friend John Barklow,

4879
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:49,391
uh,

4880
02:16:49,391 --> 02:16:50,680
he works for Sitka.

4881
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:54,130
That's a premier outdoor company.

4882
02:16:54,131 --> 02:16:58,330
They make 'em like hunting clothes and
stuff like that and they have a whole

4883
02:16:58,331 --> 02:17:00,940
video on how to do a rewarming drill.

4884
02:17:00,941 --> 02:17:01,751
And so what he does,

4885
02:17:01,751 --> 02:17:01,841
his,

4886
02:17:01,841 --> 02:17:06,640
him and his friend jump into a frozen
river and then go into a tent and heat

4887
02:17:06,641 --> 02:17:07,760
themselves back up again.

4888
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:09,660
Do Dude,

4889
02:17:10,090 --> 02:17:11,050
you watch this and your,

4890
02:17:11,051 --> 02:17:11,980
your whole body just goes,

4891
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:13,350
ah,

4892
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:16,600
cause you there in the winter
and the jump into a river,

4893
02:17:16,601 --> 02:17:20,620
they've got to move the ice around and
hop in this fucking frozen stream and

4894
02:17:20,621 --> 02:17:24,010
they go all the way under and then they
come out with their soaked down and all

4895
02:17:24,011 --> 02:17:24,190
their,

4896
02:17:24,190 --> 02:17:27,850
they're soaked wool clothes and they're
soaked synthetics and they get into a

4897
02:17:27,851 --> 02:17:28,211
tent,

4898
02:17:28,211 --> 02:17:28,670
the climate,

4899
02:17:28,670 --> 02:17:31,870
their sleeping bags and they
try to heat themselves up.

4900
02:17:32,110 --> 02:17:32,800
If you have,

4901
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:33,170
yeah,

4902
02:17:33,170 --> 02:17:35,200
if you have no access to,

4903
02:17:35,240 --> 02:17:35,521
uh,

4904
02:17:35,521 --> 02:17:36,400
a building,

4905
02:17:36,401 --> 02:17:37,210
a house,

4906
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:38,050
no shower,

4907
02:17:38,110 --> 02:17:38,380
no,

4908
02:17:38,380 --> 02:17:39,041
you're fucked.

4909
02:17:39,041 --> 02:17:39,880
You're out in the woods.

4910
02:17:40,330 --> 02:17:42,880
There's very specific things that
you have to do in order to survive.

4911
02:17:43,450 --> 02:17:46,120
If you don't follow the right steps,

4912
02:17:46,390 --> 02:17:48,010
you absolutely will die.

4913
02:17:48,910 --> 02:17:49,510
Yeah.

4914
02:17:49,510 --> 02:17:54,010
It's really common to kills more people
than probably anything in the woods

4915
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:55,740
freezing to death.

4916
02:17:55,740 --> 02:17:55,861
Yeah.

4917
02:17:55,861 --> 02:18:00,861
That movie revenant freaked me out just
going into the woods up north for three

4918
02:18:01,831 --> 02:18:06,160
months to collect pelts and you're
walking through fucking streams and it's

4919
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:10,080
pouring rain and he got
no heat or no electricity.

4920
02:18:11,300 --> 02:18:12,410
Fuck that.

4921
02:18:13,010 --> 02:18:13,251
Yeah.

4922
02:18:13,251 --> 02:18:14,270
That's how people died.

4923
02:18:14,820 --> 02:18:16,280
Lots of people live that way too.

4924
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:17,990
A lot of people live
that way until they died.

4925
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:20,960
I mean that.

4926
02:18:21,140 --> 02:18:25,010
Do you think about those people that made
it across this country and the people

4927
02:18:25,011 --> 02:18:30,011
like Lewis and Clark and all of these
pioneers that just didn't even know what

4928
02:18:30,321 --> 02:18:34,180
the fuck was around the next corner and
they just walked on through with what

4929
02:18:34,190 --> 02:18:36,320
they have like donkeys
with shit on their back.

4930
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:37,370
How much food you have?

4931
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:38,060
Yeah.

4932
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:39,320
Do you even know what
the fuck you're going?

4933
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:39,560
Yeah.

4934
02:18:39,560 --> 02:18:40,490
He hit an impasse.

4935
02:18:40,491 --> 02:18:40,671
You,

4936
02:18:40,671 --> 02:18:44,630
you hike for miles and then you come up
to a mountain and you got to double back

4937
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:46,970
and go around Christ.

4938
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:48,290
No Google Earth,

4939
02:18:49,310 --> 02:18:50,143
no nothing.

4940
02:18:50,390 --> 02:18:50,841
Shit.

4941
02:18:50,841 --> 02:18:55,400
Maps and dog shit maps written by people
you hope knew what the fuck they were

4942
02:18:55,401 --> 02:18:56,130
talking about.

4943
02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:56,963
Right.

4944
02:18:57,220 --> 02:18:57,811
You know,

4945
02:18:57,811 --> 02:18:59,600
he'd get maps from native Americans,

4946
02:18:59,601 --> 02:19:02,000
get maps from a sailor
and try to figure it out,

4947
02:19:03,870 --> 02:19:07,620
and then you randomly go into the wrong
territory and a Indians want to kill

4948
02:19:07,621 --> 02:19:08,030
you.

4949
02:19:08,030 --> 02:19:08,271
You know,

4950
02:19:08,271 --> 02:19:09,200
there's an interesting,

4951
02:19:09,250 --> 02:19:11,450
a film that's out on Netflix right now,

4952
02:19:11,451 --> 02:19:12,950
the ballot of Buster Scruggs,

4953
02:19:13,610 --> 02:19:14,600
Colin's great movie,

4954
02:19:14,870 --> 02:19:15,860
and it's all about that.

4955
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:16,940
It's all about the old west.

4956
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:18,410
It's really weird,

4957
02:19:18,411 --> 02:19:18,760
man.

4958
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:19,820
It's so weird.

4959
02:19:19,821 --> 02:19:21,320
They're the weirdest guys of all time.

4960
02:19:21,321 --> 02:19:22,420
It turns away the Kahn brothers.

4961
02:19:22,421 --> 02:19:22,710
Yeah.

4962
02:19:22,710 --> 02:19:23,090
Yeah.

4963
02:19:23,090 --> 02:19:23,801
Big Lebowski.

4964
02:19:23,801 --> 02:19:25,070
You one of my all time favorites.

4965
02:19:25,430 --> 02:19:26,690
They've just made so many cool,

4966
02:19:26,691 --> 02:19:27,524
weird,

4967
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:28,040
but this one's

4968
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,790
really weird.

4969
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:30,680
It's like a bunch of
non connected stories.

4970
02:19:30,681 --> 02:19:31,580
I thought they were connected,

4971
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:32,121
but they're not.

4972
02:19:32,121 --> 02:19:35,330
They just all taking place in the same
time period and it's called the old west

4973
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:37,180
and the end pretty similar late.

4974
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:39,960
They're all fucking
dark and you got to go.

4975
02:19:39,990 --> 02:19:40,681
Go into it.

4976
02:19:40,681 --> 02:19:42,060
I would highly recommend it,

4977
02:19:42,061 --> 02:19:45,300
but go into it knowing it's
going to be fucking dark.

4978
02:19:45,301 --> 02:19:46,200
You've got to go there.

4979
02:19:46,650 --> 02:19:47,483
Just accept it.

4980
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:50,580
But Tom waits his one is fucking amazing.

4981
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:51,570
Yeah,

4982
02:19:51,570 --> 02:19:51,901
Dude.

4983
02:19:51,901 --> 02:19:52,734
Amazing.

4984
02:19:53,010 --> 02:19:53,221
Yeah.

4985
02:19:53,221 --> 02:19:54,660
I thought it was Dick
[inaudible] for a second.

4986
02:19:55,170 --> 02:19:55,560
Oh yeah.

4987
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:56,720
Is that it's multi,

4988
02:19:57,220 --> 02:19:58,053
right?

4989
02:19:58,180 --> 02:19:59,250
Dude is so good.

4990
02:20:00,270 --> 02:20:00,620
Okay.

4991
02:20:00,620 --> 02:20:01,100
That one.

4992
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:03,680
That one was really good that the
singer guy who was really good.

4993
02:20:04,430 --> 02:20:05,263
I love that he,

4994
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:05,421
well,

4995
02:20:05,421 --> 02:20:06,171
I don't want to spoil it.

4996
02:20:06,171 --> 02:20:06,680
I don't want to spoil it,

4997
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:07,320
but now it's,

4998
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:07,970
yeah,

4999
02:20:07,970 --> 02:20:08,630
they're all,

5000
02:20:08,630 --> 02:20:09,440
they're all great,

5001
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:10,280
but at the end of it I was like,

5002
02:20:10,281 --> 02:20:11,600
what the fuck did I just watch?

5003
02:20:11,601 --> 02:20:12,434
Yeah.

5004
02:20:13,790 --> 02:20:14,800
Did you ever watch the deadwood?

5005
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:16,460
They live on Hbo.

5006
02:20:16,461 --> 02:20:17,091
I never did.

5007
02:20:17,091 --> 02:20:17,930
I never saw that

5008
02:20:18,460 --> 02:20:18,640
it,

5009
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:22,730
the thing about deadwood is I watched
it once and they were swearing so much

5010
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:24,740
that my bullshit alarm went off.

5011
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:25,970
That's why I stopped watching.

5012
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:26,511
Yeah.

5013
02:20:26,511 --> 02:20:26,931
It was like,

5014
02:20:26,931 --> 02:20:28,760
I don't think people
talk like that back then.

5015
02:20:28,761 --> 02:20:29,150
Yeah,

5016
02:20:29,150 --> 02:20:32,840
because they didn't talk like that in
the 50s and the 60s see like the trend

5017
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:33,674
doesn't make sense.

5018
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:36,650
If people talked like
that in the wild west,

5019
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:38,290
then what?

5020
02:20:38,291 --> 02:20:39,410
Where did that go?

5021
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:40,101
Where'd that go?

5022
02:20:40,101 --> 02:20:41,390
That all went into the ether,

5023
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:42,350
like they had kids,

5024
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:43,670
they raised their children.

5025
02:20:43,671 --> 02:20:47,510
The children are around this kind of
language and somehow or another it escaped

5026
02:20:47,511 --> 02:20:48,740
and it went away and it stopped.

5027
02:20:48,741 --> 02:20:49,760
That's not how the world works.

5028
02:20:49,761 --> 02:20:50,300
Right.

5029
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:51,290
The world doesn't work that way.

5030
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:55,670
The world works in the way that like you
slowly introduced fucked up words and

5031
02:20:55,671 --> 02:20:57,620
then they become like the word fuck.

5032
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:01,490
If you said the word fuck
on television in the 1950s,

5033
02:21:01,550 --> 02:21:02,990
you would get arrested.

5034
02:21:03,110 --> 02:21:03,470
Yeah.

5035
02:21:03,470 --> 02:21:04,303
Right.

5036
02:21:04,510 --> 02:21:05,930
How's that Pos staying on stage?

5037
02:21:05,931 --> 02:21:06,710
You get arrested,

5038
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:07,490
Lenny Bruce,

5039
02:21:07,490 --> 02:21:08,323
George Carlin.

5040
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:08,700
Uh,

5041
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:12,290
how was it possible that that is a hundred
years removed from people saying it

5042
02:21:12,350 --> 02:21:14,390
with abandoned constantly?

5043
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:15,560
I don't believe it.

5044
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:16,370
Yeah,

5045
02:21:16,370 --> 02:21:21,080
like I think a better example of
what it was probably like his,

5046
02:21:21,081 --> 02:21:23,450
like gangs of New York and then
it's probably more accurate.

5047
02:21:23,451 --> 02:21:24,284
Yeah.

5048
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:26,000
Like that was probably
what people were like.

5049
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:26,361
Right.

5050
02:21:26,361 --> 02:21:28,340
Then there were probably brutal as fuck,

5051
02:21:28,490 --> 02:21:33,370
but I bet they didn't swear as much as
we like to think they did the deadwood

5052
02:21:33,410 --> 02:21:33,541
thing,

5053
02:21:33,541 --> 02:21:35,150
it was like they were using it as a,

5054
02:21:37,330 --> 02:21:40,060
I mean maybe I need to go back
and watch it before I talk shit.

5055
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:41,890
But it felt like they were using it.

5056
02:21:41,891 --> 02:21:43,450
Almost like to modernize it.

5057
02:21:44,260 --> 02:21:44,730
Yeah.

5058
02:21:44,730 --> 02:21:48,190
Well you know they were having these
people talk like scallywags would talk

5059
02:21:48,250 --> 02:21:48,940
today.

5060
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:49,773
Right.

5061
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:51,670
They also say cursing is cultural.

5062
02:21:51,671 --> 02:21:52,570
Like if you,

5063
02:21:52,571 --> 02:21:53,321
if you're in a,

5064
02:21:53,321 --> 02:21:54,154
uh,

5065
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:54,551
you know,

5066
02:21:54,551 --> 02:21:59,551
they talk about how black people curse
versus how Protestants curse coffee.

5067
02:22:00,810 --> 02:22:01,050
Yeah.

5068
02:22:01,050 --> 02:22:01,883
I'll have some more of that.

5069
02:22:02,290 --> 02:22:02,951
Did you have any,

5070
02:22:02,951 --> 02:22:04,180
will you have a name and a little bit,

5071
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:05,590
just this article about,

5072
02:22:05,591 --> 02:22:08,920
it says that they purposely changed
the words because to make it more

5073
02:22:08,921 --> 02:22:11,840
contemporary because people wouldn't
have been buying if they're saying

5074
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:14,050
tarnation and Gold Darren
and shit like that.

5075
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:14,590
Yeah,

5076
02:22:14,590 --> 02:22:14,861
yeah.

5077
02:22:14,861 --> 02:22:15,251
There you go.

5078
02:22:15,251 --> 02:22:16,300
What in Tarnation Glee.

5079
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:18,100
But imagine if they did that with vikings.

5080
02:22:20,130 --> 02:22:21,180
You know like Yo,

5081
02:22:21,181 --> 02:22:22,080
we pillage and or what,

5082
02:22:22,670 --> 02:22:26,040
where are we doing dog
the fuck I want to be

5083
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,910
king of this bitch.

5084
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:31,050
Yo saw let's let loose on this shit.

5085
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:33,030
Let's let loose on these bitches.

5086
02:22:33,930 --> 02:22:34,560
Yeah.

5087
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:36,210
I mean maybe that's,

5088
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:37,440
that's real similar.

5089
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:38,761
Yeah,

5090
02:22:38,761 --> 02:22:39,061
I'd see.

5091
02:22:39,061 --> 02:22:39,690
That's why.

5092
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:39,901
Okay,

5093
02:22:39,901 --> 02:22:40,734
so I'm not wrong.

5094
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:42,030
No,

5095
02:22:42,030 --> 02:22:42,863
they did it on purpose.

5096
02:22:43,010 --> 02:22:44,130
I bred the bringing it back.

5097
02:22:44,131 --> 02:22:47,790
They're making a movie
or something or other.

5098
02:22:47,850 --> 02:22:51,270
I'd bring the series back cause it ended
in the middle of season two when that

5099
02:22:51,271 --> 02:22:52,104
writer's strike happened,

5100
02:22:52,210 --> 02:22:52,800
I just kind of,

5101
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:55,770
I heard there's a dope viking
one that's on Netflix now.

5102
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:57,390
I think it's a comedy.

5103
02:22:57,540 --> 02:22:57,870
Is it?

5104
02:22:57,870 --> 02:22:58,703
Oh yeah.

5105
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:01,380
Norse nor scarves or something like that.

5106
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:02,670
Now that's not the,

5107
02:23:02,670 --> 02:23:05,110
I don't think that's the one
somebody else told me about one.

5108
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:08,850
I think I'll put it on my phone cause
I'm Norsemen Norseman does that it,

5109
02:23:08,851 --> 02:23:09,684
that might be it.

5110
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:10,230
Is that,

5111
02:23:10,230 --> 02:23:11,070
is that a comedy?

5112
02:23:11,510 --> 02:23:12,343
Oh

5113
02:23:12,630 --> 02:23:13,081
it's weird.

5114
02:23:13,081 --> 02:23:17,430
My kids fucking curse and I
never cursed around the house.

5115
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:18,750
My wife crystal little,

5116
02:23:18,930 --> 02:23:21,900
but now suddenly it's okay
and they're 15 and 18,

5117
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:26,100
but it's suddenly okay that were at dinner
and just fuck gets thrown around all

5118
02:23:26,101 --> 02:23:26,934
the time.

5119
02:23:27,130 --> 02:23:27,751
Like when did they,

5120
02:23:27,751 --> 02:23:28,740
when did I okay that

5121
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:33,710
this it Norsemen it's just
got a comedic vibe to it.

5122
02:23:33,711 --> 02:23:34,770
I don't know if it's like a full on.

5123
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:36,193
Okay.

5124
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:39,180
I'm just going to skip the whole thing.

5125
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:41,733
This is

5126
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:44,251
just based off of that.

5127
02:23:44,251 --> 02:23:44,551
I saw it.

5128
02:23:44,551 --> 02:23:44,840
I was like,

5129
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:44,940
oh,

5130
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:46,690
it looks like some Monte Python Shit.

5131
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:49,241
Well why not?

5132
02:23:49,241 --> 02:23:50,074
I heard it's good though,

5133
02:23:50,090 --> 02:23:50,710
but I haven't,

5134
02:23:50,710 --> 02:23:51,890
I haven't at this might be it.

5135
02:23:51,891 --> 02:23:52,724
Yeah.

5136
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:54,470
I was just too many new shells.

5137
02:23:54,560 --> 02:23:55,393
I can't keep,

5138
02:23:55,940 --> 02:23:56,773
I can't keep up.

5139
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:58,033
I now,

5140
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:00,240
yeah,

5141
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:01,073
it's um,

5142
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:02,040
it's like,

5143
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:02,873
it's great.

5144
02:24:03,090 --> 02:24:05,730
This such high quality
and things are so good,

5145
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:08,940
but it's not great in
that you can't keep up.

5146
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:11,580
Have you started watching
the marvelous Mrs Maizel?

5147
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:11,881
Yeah,

5148
02:24:11,881 --> 02:24:15,960
I saw the first season and then maybe
one or two of the second season,

5149
02:24:15,961 --> 02:24:16,794
but it just,

5150
02:24:17,130 --> 02:24:17,940
I really liked it.

5151
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:19,260
I think she's fucking great.

5152
02:24:19,290 --> 02:24:24,290
Obviously the cast Tony Shalhoub
but it just got so Jewish.

5153
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:25,910
Don't say anything cause I'm,

5154
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:26,380
I'm uh,

5155
02:24:26,380 --> 02:24:27,190
I'm just starting it.

5156
02:24:27,190 --> 02:24:27,550
Okay.

5157
02:24:27,550 --> 02:24:28,250
This is what I did.

5158
02:24:28,250 --> 02:24:28,901
I looked up,

5159
02:24:28,901 --> 02:24:30,610
I fucked up and started with season two.

5160
02:24:30,820 --> 02:24:32,830
How you did it started with episode one,

5161
02:24:32,831 --> 02:24:33,664
season two,

5162
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:34,630
got to episode three.

5163
02:24:34,631 --> 02:24:34,901
I was like,

5164
02:24:34,901 --> 02:24:35,734
what's wrong with those?

5165
02:24:36,790 --> 02:24:37,930
That's hilarious.

5166
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:38,111
No,

5167
02:24:38,111 --> 02:24:38,660
I didn't even know.

5168
02:24:38,660 --> 02:24:39,493
Somebody had to tell me.

5169
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:41,110
Somebody had to tell me at the store,

5170
02:24:41,170 --> 02:24:41,891
I forget who told me.

5171
02:24:41,891 --> 02:24:42,101
But,

5172
02:24:42,101 --> 02:24:42,934
um,

5173
02:24:43,090 --> 02:24:46,780
I went back and watched the
first episode of season one.

5174
02:24:46,781 --> 02:24:47,021
It was like,

5175
02:24:47,021 --> 02:24:47,441
Holy Shit,

5176
02:24:47,441 --> 02:24:48,274
this is even better.

5177
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:51,640
But I thought it was good watching
the first episode of season two,

5178
02:24:51,641 --> 02:24:54,040
not even knowing how she got there
because I knew it was about stand up.

5179
02:24:54,041 --> 02:24:54,910
I knew she was a comic,

5180
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:57,310
but then going back and
watching it from season one,

5181
02:24:57,311 --> 02:24:57,670
I'm like,

5182
02:24:57,670 --> 02:24:58,690
oh,

5183
02:24:58,691 --> 02:24:59,110
okay.

5184
02:24:59,110 --> 02:24:59,291
Yeah.

5185
02:24:59,291 --> 02:25:00,190
I think there's a lot,

5186
02:25:00,191 --> 02:25:04,300
there's a lot of stuff about how they
ha and writing on a show that's similar

5187
02:25:04,301 --> 02:25:07,030
and that it's about a comedian
starting out on crashing.

5188
02:25:07,420 --> 02:25:07,900
It's,

5189
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:10,030
I think they really capture,

5190
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:11,230
um,

5191
02:25:11,230 --> 02:25:12,970
the process of somebody brand new,

5192
02:25:12,971 --> 02:25:14,680
finding their voice on stage.

5193
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:15,270
Yeah.

5194
02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:16,103
Yeah.

5195
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:17,380
And the manager's grade,

5196
02:25:17,381 --> 02:25:18,790
the woman that plays her manager,

5197
02:25:18,970 --> 02:25:21,940
there's always somebody like that
that's in your corner that's helping you

5198
02:25:21,941 --> 02:25:23,020
develop yourself.

5199
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:24,633
Um,

5200
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:25,331
and she's,

5201
02:25:25,331 --> 02:25:26,770
she's natural on stage.

5202
02:25:26,771 --> 02:25:27,311
I buy it.

5203
02:25:27,311 --> 02:25:30,610
I buy her as a standup on stage
by her as being actually funny.

5204
02:25:30,790 --> 02:25:31,410
Yeah.

5205
02:25:31,410 --> 02:25:33,370
And it's interesting seeing Lenny Bruce,

5206
02:25:33,430 --> 02:25:35,050
the guy who plays with
Lenny Bruce is very good.

5207
02:25:35,051 --> 02:25:35,610
Yeah.

5208
02:25:35,610 --> 02:25:36,443
Who is that guy?

5209
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:38,080
Who's the,

5210
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:38,913
who's her too?

5211
02:25:40,180 --> 02:25:45,180
Her name and spoil or you get to see
her breasts call's fantastic by the way,

5212
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:47,140
Lord.

5213
02:25:47,140 --> 02:25:47,830
Good Lord.

5214
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:48,670
Thank you Jesus.

5215
02:25:50,550 --> 02:25:51,810
I had to do a search.

5216
02:25:52,140 --> 02:25:53,040
Not that I want to sound like,

5217
02:25:53,570 --> 02:25:53,911
but no,

5218
02:25:53,911 --> 02:25:55,220
I did a search on her news.

5219
02:25:55,230 --> 02:25:56,063
Just let it go.

5220
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:57,690
I did a thing on her nude and

5221
02:25:59,360 --> 02:25:59,760
proud.

5222
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:00,230
Put it up.

5223
02:26:00,230 --> 02:26:02,970
So you go for that.

5224
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:03,480
Yeah.

5225
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:04,313
Wow.

5226
02:26:04,590 --> 02:26:04,831
Yeah.

5227
02:26:04,831 --> 02:26:09,831
Rachel Brosnahan and I'm Mike
[inaudible] and agile nasal.

5228
02:26:10,261 --> 02:26:11,000
Great.

5229
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:11,670
And uh,

5230
02:26:11,670 --> 02:26:12,391
who is,

5231
02:26:12,391 --> 02:26:13,224
um,

5232
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:15,300
who's playing Lenny Bruce?

5233
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:17,440
Is that the guy?

5234
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:18,220
Luke Kirby.

5235
02:26:18,220 --> 02:26:18,791
Luke Kirby.

5236
02:26:18,791 --> 02:26:19,624
Luke Kirby.

5237
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:21,063
Outstanding.

5238
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:21,941
He did a great job.

5239
02:26:21,941 --> 02:26:22,051
He,

5240
02:26:22,051 --> 02:26:23,220
he sounded like,

5241
02:26:23,221 --> 02:26:23,590
um,

5242
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:23,800
you know,

5243
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:24,460
he sounds,

5244
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:26,890
without doing an obvious impression,

5245
02:26:27,370 --> 02:26:29,860
it sounds like it's got the tone right.

5246
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:30,001
Yeah.

5247
02:26:30,001 --> 02:26:31,180
He's got the inflection,

5248
02:26:31,181 --> 02:26:31,840
right.

5249
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:33,550
It's not overly stylized.

5250
02:26:33,580 --> 02:26:33,911
No,

5251
02:26:33,911 --> 02:26:34,211
no,

5252
02:26:34,211 --> 02:26:34,421
no.

5253
02:26:34,421 --> 02:26:34,580
It's,

5254
02:26:34,580 --> 02:26:35,740
and that you believe it.

5255
02:26:35,870 --> 02:26:36,450
It's,

5256
02:26:36,450 --> 02:26:36,820
he's,

5257
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:37,180
he's,

5258
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:41,110
he did a great job of like seeming like
a guy doing standup in front of a room.

5259
02:26:41,111 --> 02:26:43,810
People not like an actor
playing a stand up.

5260
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:44,321
Well,

5261
02:26:44,321 --> 02:26:46,060
the woman that created the show,

5262
02:26:46,230 --> 02:26:49,480
apparently her dad was a
standup and he knew Lenny Bruce,

5263
02:26:49,481 --> 02:26:53,470
which is why she put him in the series
because he's the only historical figure

5264
02:26:53,471 --> 02:26:54,240
in the shell.

5265
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:54,790
Right,

5266
02:26:54,790 --> 02:26:55,450
right.

5267
02:26:55,450 --> 02:26:55,601
Yeah.

5268
02:26:55,601 --> 02:26:55,721
Well,

5269
02:26:55,721 --> 02:26:56,650
it's also the show.

5270
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:58,570
They take some liberties with a history.

5271
02:26:58,810 --> 02:26:59,520
Like there was,

5272
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:01,720
I don't think there was
a comedy club back then,

5273
02:27:02,230 --> 02:27:02,531
you know,

5274
02:27:02,531 --> 02:27:03,430
this gas light,

5275
02:27:03,431 --> 02:27:04,010
they called it.

5276
02:27:04,010 --> 02:27:04,620
That's,

5277
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:05,680
I don't think that was real.

5278
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:07,960
I don't think there really
was a comedy club back then.

5279
02:27:07,961 --> 02:27:12,790
I think back then people were just
doing poetry nights and they were doing,

5280
02:27:12,810 --> 02:27:13,111
you know,

5281
02:27:13,111 --> 02:27:15,460
it'd be like a musician than a comedian.

5282
02:27:15,461 --> 02:27:16,680
Comedians would host things.

5283
02:27:16,681 --> 02:27:17,290
Right.

5284
02:27:17,290 --> 02:27:20,680
I don't think there was
necessarily a comedy club.

5285
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:20,930
Yeah,

5286
02:27:20,930 --> 02:27:22,030
I think that came later.

5287
02:27:22,390 --> 02:27:22,601
Yeah,

5288
02:27:22,601 --> 02:27:26,080
it's like catch a rising star came
out of being a cabaret and you know,

5289
02:27:26,081 --> 02:27:29,710
people would sing there and then suddenly
people started doing stand up there

5290
02:27:29,711 --> 02:27:33,680
and the two existed together for
years before it became a comedy club.

5291
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:34,533
We should,

5292
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:36,220
we should actually know this.

5293
02:27:36,221 --> 02:27:38,740
Why do we not know what was
the very first comedy club?

5294
02:27:39,670 --> 02:27:40,750
Well it was a catch.

5295
02:27:41,050 --> 02:27:43,540
There was the hungry eye in San Francisco.

5296
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:46,090
Is that the first night
and is the 60s though?

5297
02:27:46,130 --> 02:27:46,761
Was that when it's done?

5298
02:27:46,761 --> 02:27:47,470
Yeah,

5299
02:27:47,470 --> 02:27:49,570
that was the 60s because the ice house,

5300
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:50,680
um,

5301
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:54,550
is the oldest running
comedy club in the world.

5302
02:27:54,730 --> 02:27:55,750
The ice was the oldest.

5303
02:27:55,751 --> 02:27:58,150
All the other old ones are
gone except the ice house.

5304
02:27:59,170 --> 02:28:01,510
And the comedy and Magic
Club is right on its heels.

5305
02:28:01,730 --> 02:28:02,100
Right.

5306
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:02,440
That's,

5307
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:03,430
that's probably second.

5308
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:05,620
But what was the,

5309
02:28:05,950 --> 02:28:09,880
well that place is called The gas light
and I think there was a gas light.

5310
02:28:09,980 --> 02:28:11,650
I think it was a comedy club though.

5311
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:12,821
I don't think they,

5312
02:28:12,821 --> 02:28:13,750
the way they did it,

5313
02:28:13,751 --> 02:28:14,770
which was great.

5314
02:28:14,990 --> 02:28:15,431
And again,

5315
02:28:15,431 --> 02:28:16,264
I don't want to give,

5316
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:17,260
give too much of it away,

5317
02:28:17,261 --> 02:28:19,660
but the way they did it where
like people were getting bumped,

5318
02:28:20,110 --> 02:28:21,010
like she got bumped.

5319
02:28:21,020 --> 02:28:21,400
Yeah.

5320
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:21,621
It's like,

5321
02:28:21,621 --> 02:28:26,600
I don't think that that was what guys did
where they ran around doing 15 minutes

5322
02:28:26,601 --> 02:28:29,150
and go from one club to another the
way in New York comics do it now.

5323
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:30,560
I don't think that's real.

5324
02:28:30,590 --> 02:28:31,423
Yeah.

5325
02:28:31,580 --> 02:28:33,320
But that's a nit picky thing.

5326
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:35,210
That's more,

5327
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:36,463
you know,

5328
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:39,530
it's more indicative I think
of how people do it today.

5329
02:28:40,810 --> 02:28:41,210
You'd like,

5330
02:28:41,210 --> 02:28:41,960
do you think they were,

5331
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:42,231
I mean,

5332
02:28:42,231 --> 02:28:43,064
who the fuck knows?

5333
02:28:43,070 --> 02:28:46,280
Maybe they had a drop in back then
and maybe they did have nights,

5334
02:28:46,310 --> 02:28:48,380
like several nights where
they had just comedy.

5335
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:49,190
Yeah.

5336
02:28:49,190 --> 02:28:52,910
This is booked by a cliff nest
off about the history of comedy.

5337
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:53,570
You ever read that?

5338
02:28:53,570 --> 02:28:54,200
No,

5339
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:54,960
he's great.

5340
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:55,793
Um,

5341
02:28:56,450 --> 02:28:57,021
I don't know,

5342
02:28:57,021 --> 02:28:57,854
but it's cliff,

5343
02:28:58,050 --> 02:28:58,520
uh,

5344
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:00,050
any s t e r o.

5345
02:29:00,051 --> 02:29:01,310
V and A.

5346
02:29:01,311 --> 02:29:02,930
I had him on my podcast a couple of times.

5347
02:29:02,931 --> 02:29:03,471
He's great.

5348
02:29:03,471 --> 02:29:04,300
But they,

5349
02:29:04,300 --> 02:29:06,810
the real first comedy
shows in New York were,

5350
02:29:06,811 --> 02:29:07,500
um,

5351
02:29:07,500 --> 02:29:08,333
uh,

5352
02:29:08,690 --> 02:29:09,620
the Comedians,

5353
02:29:09,980 --> 02:29:10,461
drunks,

5354
02:29:10,461 --> 02:29:10,791
thieves,

5355
02:29:10,791 --> 02:29:11,361
scoundrels,

5356
02:29:11,361 --> 02:29:12,860
and the history of American comedy.

5357
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:13,850
Um,

5358
02:29:13,850 --> 02:29:16,880
did you find anything about the oldest
or the first standup comedy club?

5359
02:29:18,750 --> 02:29:21,420
Arguably in the United Kingdom in 1979,

5360
02:29:21,421 --> 02:29:22,320
it was the comedy store.

5361
02:29:22,321 --> 02:29:26,250
And before that there were just performing
English motherfucker got ahold of

5362
02:29:26,251 --> 02:29:27,084
Wikipedia.

5363
02:29:28,170 --> 02:29:30,570
That's just started in United Kingdom
and the United States history,

5364
02:29:30,571 --> 02:29:32,970
it goes back into the 19th
century and Vaudeville places.

5365
02:29:32,971 --> 02:29:36,300
And so it just depends on when
somebody first turned their venue.

5366
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:39,780
But what I'm saying is who called who was,

5367
02:29:39,781 --> 02:29:41,940
who had the very serious comedy club?

5368
02:29:42,030 --> 02:29:42,251
Yeah,

5369
02:29:42,251 --> 02:29:42,570
the,

5370
02:29:42,570 --> 02:29:44,490
the Hungary I San Francisco.

5371
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:45,060
Yeah.

5372
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:45,661
So the hungry,

5373
02:29:45,661 --> 02:29:47,640
I was a 100% comedy club.

5374
02:29:47,820 --> 02:29:48,240
Yeah.

5375
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:49,230
And then the bitter end,

5376
02:29:49,231 --> 02:29:53,280
which was music and comedy
interesting in New York.

5377
02:29:53,850 --> 02:29:54,720
So those are the ones in,

5378
02:29:54,721 --> 02:29:55,554
what year is that?

5379
02:29:56,390 --> 02:29:59,760
Let's just says in the 50s into the 60s
it doesn't have this particular year.

5380
02:29:59,761 --> 02:30:00,594
Wow.

5381
02:30:00,990 --> 02:30:02,100
Mort Saul,

5382
02:30:03,330 --> 02:30:06,450
I think Mort Saul still around Google that

5383
02:30:06,620 --> 02:30:07,453
I think he is.

5384
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:08,900
I think he's still doing standup.

5385
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:09,760
I think Dick [inaudible],

5386
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:10,690
Dick Gregory's around.

5387
02:30:10,691 --> 02:30:10,990
See,

5388
02:30:10,990 --> 02:30:12,170
I think Dick Gregory died.

5389
02:30:12,410 --> 02:30:12,531
Oh,

5390
02:30:12,531 --> 02:30:13,090
he did?

5391
02:30:13,090 --> 02:30:13,923
True.

5392
02:30:13,990 --> 02:30:17,180
Find out that first cause I'm a dick,

5393
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:18,250
I say died and he didn't.

5394
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:19,113
Yeah.

5395
02:30:19,540 --> 02:30:20,373
Um,

5396
02:30:20,650 --> 02:30:20,861
yeah.

5397
02:30:20,861 --> 02:30:21,694
Dick Gregory.

5398
02:30:22,150 --> 02:30:22,983
Yeah.

5399
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:24,813
Yeah,

5400
02:30:25,150 --> 02:30:25,710
he died.

5401
02:30:25,710 --> 02:30:28,260
But I think Lenny Bruce might've
started at the hungry eye as well.

5402
02:30:28,261 --> 02:30:29,760
I think he started in San Francisco.

5403
02:30:29,930 --> 02:30:30,763
I think you're right.

5404
02:30:30,980 --> 02:30:31,813
Yeah.

5405
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:32,871
Yeah.

5406
02:30:32,871 --> 02:30:33,660
That was a,

5407
02:30:33,660 --> 02:30:34,760
the beatniks right?

5408
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:35,660
Yeah.

5409
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:36,860
Led into the,

5410
02:30:36,890 --> 02:30:37,760
is he still around?

5411
02:30:38,090 --> 02:30:42,800
Goddamn you Mort Saul still rocking
1991 years old motherfucker.

5412
02:30:42,860 --> 02:30:43,760
Wow.

5413
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:44,990
Outlived them all.

5414
02:30:45,020 --> 02:30:45,853
Good for him.

5415
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:46,760
Um,

5416
02:30:46,760 --> 02:30:47,001
yeah,

5417
02:30:47,001 --> 02:30:48,710
all these guys were the originators.

5418
02:30:48,770 --> 02:30:49,250
I mean,

5419
02:30:49,250 --> 02:30:50,360
without them.

5420
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:51,051
These are,

5421
02:30:51,051 --> 02:30:54,200
this is the original roots of
the tree of standup comedy.

5422
02:30:54,660 --> 02:30:55,880
100% right.

5423
02:30:55,970 --> 02:30:56,803
Yeah.

5424
02:30:59,180 --> 02:31:00,810
We do know James Googling shit

5425
02:31:02,330 --> 02:31:04,270
going back.

5426
02:31:05,030 --> 02:31:07,250
It's a crazy history.

5427
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:12,700
You really stop and think about the year
it starts in the 60s and that before

5428
02:31:13,191 --> 02:31:15,470
that it didn't exist like that.

5429
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:17,120
Like it was kind of a
thing that people did.

5430
02:31:17,121 --> 02:31:18,080
There was court jesters,

5431
02:31:18,081 --> 02:31:19,130
there was funny people,

5432
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:22,650
there was comedy in
various plays and musicals.

5433
02:31:22,651 --> 02:31:24,120
There was comp comedic elements.

5434
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:25,320
But this cabaret,

5435
02:31:25,410 --> 02:31:26,243
yeah.

5436
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:28,650
And there was MCS people would mc things.

5437
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:33,860
But in terms of like someone
going specifically to see
someone say things in a

5438
02:31:34,261 --> 02:31:34,891
funny way,

5439
02:31:34,891 --> 02:31:36,360
just talking in front of a microphone.

5440
02:31:36,660 --> 02:31:38,640
That is really recent.

5441
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:39,410
Yeah.

5442
02:31:39,410 --> 02:31:40,243
That's,

5443
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:43,080
now imagine if we were
born a hundred years ago.

5444
02:31:43,081 --> 02:31:44,400
What the fuck would we do?

5445
02:31:46,410 --> 02:31:46,651
Well,

5446
02:31:46,651 --> 02:31:47,280
we might,

5447
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,450
we might have done,

5448
02:31:48,451 --> 02:31:49,080
um,

5449
02:31:49,080 --> 02:31:49,913
Vaudeville,

5450
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:52,920
hang out with all those Vaudeville people.

5451
02:31:52,970 --> 02:31:55,560
I'd feel people where
you go from town to town,

5452
02:31:55,700 --> 02:31:56,250
your beer,

5453
02:31:56,250 --> 02:31:58,020
your suitcase has no wheels on it.

5454
02:31:58,300 --> 02:31:58,801
The login,

5455
02:31:58,801 --> 02:31:59,970
that shit on a train.

5456
02:32:00,050 --> 02:32:00,883
Oh,

5457
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:01,801
fun though.

5458
02:32:01,801 --> 02:32:02,550
Few Young.

5459
02:32:02,550 --> 02:32:03,383
Yeah.

5460
02:32:03,460 --> 02:32:06,570
For young it's probably fun because if
you think you're a big deal when you go

5461
02:32:06,571 --> 02:32:09,450
to a town now go to fucking Columbus,

5462
02:32:09,451 --> 02:32:13,320
Ohio in 1919 and perform,

5463
02:32:13,350 --> 02:32:15,030
you would be like a god to them.

5464
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:16,571
Yeah.

5465
02:32:16,571 --> 02:32:17,990
But you would also be like a carnie.

5466
02:32:18,370 --> 02:32:19,080
Yeah.

5467
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:20,670
Traveling from town to town.

5468
02:32:20,730 --> 02:32:23,220
Probably fucking real
loose with your morals.

5469
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,640
Yeah.

5470
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:24,473
Right.

5471
02:32:25,770 --> 02:32:28,290
Spreading God knows
what around the Midwest,

5472
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:31,710
all kinds of STDs and yeah.

5473
02:32:31,740 --> 02:32:34,770
Ious and babies constantly.

5474
02:32:34,771 --> 02:32:36,600
Nobody pulled out to use the wrapper.

5475
02:32:36,810 --> 02:32:38,100
1910s.

5476
02:32:38,370 --> 02:32:38,671
Right.

5477
02:32:38,671 --> 02:32:39,930
And they're also like,

5478
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:41,670
they're living a savage life.

5479
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:43,710
Like to expect them to find a nice gown,

5480
02:32:43,711 --> 02:32:44,940
Kansas and settle down.

5481
02:32:44,970 --> 02:32:45,720
That's right.

5482
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:46,320
They're just,

5483
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:49,620
they're working the tilt the world and
they've got a prop it up with logs cause

5484
02:32:49,621 --> 02:32:53,030
the left side doesn't have
a leg that thing spins.

5485
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:54,240
So you got to keep an eye on it.

5486
02:32:54,241 --> 02:32:56,130
You don't want to launch
anybody to the parking lot.

5487
02:32:56,990 --> 02:32:57,541
And if you do,

5488
02:32:57,541 --> 02:32:59,380
you just pack up and
move to the next town.

5489
02:32:59,410 --> 02:33:02,430
They just get the fuck out of here is
just no way to track on the Internet.

5490
02:33:03,750 --> 02:33:03,991
Yeah.

5491
02:33:03,991 --> 02:33:04,651
They say you know,

5492
02:33:04,651 --> 02:33:05,760
a lot of those early,

5493
02:33:05,761 --> 02:33:06,360
um,

5494
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:10,950
it was very Jewish because Jews were
having a hard time getting hired.

5495
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:13,080
And so that was one of the
few places they could work.

5496
02:33:13,081 --> 02:33:16,620
And that's why they say comedy
was a very Jewish thing.

5497
02:33:16,860 --> 02:33:17,551
Oh,

5498
02:33:17,551 --> 02:33:20,730
interest leading into the
Borscht belt and all that.

5499
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:22,080
Stan and all of this,

5500
02:33:22,081 --> 02:33:22,920
but we just came out.

5501
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:27,980
It's basically about this Lauren Harlow
hardy were Vaudeville tour and comedians

5502
02:33:28,831 --> 02:33:29,700
in 1920s.

5503
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:30,870
When did this come out?

5504
02:33:30,900 --> 02:33:31,710
Just came out.

5505
02:33:31,710 --> 02:33:32,730
It's in the theaters right now.

5506
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:33,570
No Shit.

5507
02:33:33,570 --> 02:33:33,770
I have.

5508
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:34,441
It has to be good.

5509
02:33:34,441 --> 02:33:35,190
But yeah,

5510
02:33:35,190 --> 02:33:38,010
about two weeks ago and Stan
and all these stand for,

5511
02:33:38,011 --> 02:33:39,330
forget the Laurel and hardy,

5512
02:33:39,390 --> 02:33:39,750
right?

5513
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:40,210
Yep.

5514
02:33:40,210 --> 02:33:40,311
Yep.

5515
02:33:40,311 --> 02:33:40,490
Yep.

5516
02:33:40,490 --> 02:33:42,060
It's a John C.

5517
02:33:42,060 --> 02:33:44,120
Reilly and Steve Coogan.

5518
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:45,450
Wow.

5519
02:33:45,510 --> 02:33:46,710
Guys are both amazing.

5520
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:47,653
Yeah.

5521
02:33:47,750 --> 02:33:48,930
Jonsi Raleigh's excellent.

5522
02:33:50,940 --> 02:33:52,080
I don't know who Steve Coogan is.

5523
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:53,513
WHO's Steve Coogan?

5524
02:33:53,770 --> 02:33:54,890
I said British standup,

5525
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:55,793
I think,

5526
02:33:56,780 --> 02:33:57,121
but uh,

5527
02:33:57,121 --> 02:33:57,811
that's cool.

5528
02:33:57,811 --> 02:33:59,250
I'm glad someone okay.

5529
02:33:59,430 --> 02:33:59,551
Oh,

5530
02:33:59,551 --> 02:34:00,780
I've seen that guy and stuff before.

5531
02:34:02,010 --> 02:34:03,060
I'm glad someone's doing that.

5532
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:06,420
Charlie Chapman was
supposedly a bad motherfucker.

5533
02:34:06,450 --> 02:34:07,283
Yeah.

5534
02:34:07,410 --> 02:34:10,170
He would go up to the
Hearst castle and fuck,

5535
02:34:10,171 --> 02:34:11,004
uh,

5536
02:34:11,090 --> 02:34:11,760
Eh,

5537
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:14,340
hearse wife in the castle.

5538
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:15,870
You ever go up to that castle?

5539
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:16,141
Yeah.

5540
02:34:16,141 --> 02:34:16,831
When I was a little kid.

5541
02:34:16,831 --> 02:34:18,010
It's amazing.

5542
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:18,911
And a,

5543
02:34:18,911 --> 02:34:19,131
yeah.

5544
02:34:19,131 --> 02:34:20,110
A chaplain would go up.

5545
02:34:20,111 --> 02:34:21,250
He was fucking everybody.

5546
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:22,180
Everybody's wife.

5547
02:34:22,210 --> 02:34:22,580
Yeah.

5548
02:34:22,580 --> 02:34:22,900
Cheese.

5549
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:24,160
He got off on wives.

5550
02:34:24,400 --> 02:34:24,821
Really?

5551
02:34:24,821 --> 02:34:25,121
Yeah.

5552
02:34:25,121 --> 02:34:25,990
That was a thing.

5553
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:27,400
So dangerous.

5554
02:34:29,410 --> 02:34:32,290
Imagine the only happy if you're
banging someone else's woman.

5555
02:34:33,130 --> 02:34:33,670
Wow.

5556
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:34,503
That's crazy.

5557
02:34:34,510 --> 02:34:35,343
I guess there's no,

5558
02:34:35,350 --> 02:34:36,310
there's no commitment.

5559
02:34:37,110 --> 02:34:37,943
Maybe that,

5560
02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:39,190
and if she gets pregnant,

5561
02:34:39,850 --> 02:34:43,210
he'll claim it and he'll claim the baby
that's them there at the Hearst castle.

5562
02:34:43,360 --> 02:34:44,530
Wow.

5563
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:46,270
Whoa.

5564
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:48,220
That scene with the cigarette.

5565
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:48,790
Yeah.

5566
02:34:48,790 --> 02:34:49,960
That's so weird.

5567
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:52,510
1930s banging her in the 60s

5568
02:34:53,130 --> 02:34:55,650
Hurst would have hundreds
of guests every weekend.

5569
02:34:55,651 --> 02:35:00,000
They had rooms for hundreds of
people and they would have hunts.

5570
02:35:00,030 --> 02:35:03,100
They would fucking hunt
during the day or you know,

5571
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:06,210
they play tennis and then everybody
would meet for high balls at like five

5572
02:35:06,211 --> 02:35:09,200
o'clock in one room and giant fireplaces.

5573
02:35:09,210 --> 02:35:12,270
And they've set dinners
with fucking servants.

5574
02:35:12,271 --> 02:35:14,400
And if you've got an invite to that,

5575
02:35:14,430 --> 02:35:17,070
he went for you go for like three weeks.

5576
02:35:17,150 --> 02:35:17,660
What?

5577
02:35:17,660 --> 02:35:18,291
Yeah,

5578
02:35:18,291 --> 02:35:20,210
you can look at that dining hall.

5579
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:21,260
You know what that looks like?

5580
02:35:21,580 --> 02:35:24,740
It looks like the haunted
dining hall in the Disney Rod.

5581
02:35:24,830 --> 02:35:25,790
The haunted mansion.

5582
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:26,731
I don't know.

5583
02:35:26,731 --> 02:35:27,201
Pass the,

5584
02:35:27,201 --> 02:35:28,034
you ever seen that?

5585
02:35:28,850 --> 02:35:29,690
Do you know what I'm talking about?

5586
02:35:29,691 --> 02:35:30,800
Got inspired from something.

5587
02:35:30,950 --> 02:35:32,940
I guarantee that's what
they got inspired by it.

5588
02:35:32,941 --> 02:35:34,400
It looks so much like that.

5589
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:38,500
So look at that image right
now and now Google the uh,

5590
02:35:38,600 --> 02:35:40,990
dining room at the haunted mansion,

5591
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:44,100
Disneyland and all seen
where you fly by and you're,

5592
02:35:44,110 --> 02:35:46,910
you're on the little train and you
pass by and all the ghosts are dancing

5593
02:35:46,911 --> 02:35:47,150
around.

5594
02:35:47,150 --> 02:35:47,401
Shit.

5595
02:35:47,401 --> 02:35:48,020
It's cool.

5596
02:35:48,020 --> 02:35:48,853
It looks just like that.

5597
02:35:49,330 --> 02:35:49,870
Um,

5598
02:35:49,870 --> 02:35:50,770
and then it was a zoo.

5599
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:52,750
All the grounds where
a zoo at Hearst castle,

5600
02:35:52,751 --> 02:35:55,420
there was fucking giraffes
running around zebras.

5601
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:57,010
He's like El Chapo.

5602
02:35:57,370 --> 02:35:59,290
He couldn't get rid of his money.

5603
02:35:59,470 --> 02:36:00,970
He has so much fucking money.

5604
02:36:01,160 --> 02:36:02,870
That's a shit image of it.

5605
02:36:02,930 --> 02:36:03,890
They don't have a good image of it.

5606
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:05,393
Oh,

5607
02:36:05,460 --> 02:36:06,293
all right.

5608
02:36:07,510 --> 02:36:08,343
Um,

5609
02:36:10,030 --> 02:36:10,960
how's that possible?

5610
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:12,830
That really supposed to
take pictures in there.

5611
02:36:12,860 --> 02:36:13,460
You,

5612
02:36:13,460 --> 02:36:14,410
that's a good point.

5613
02:36:14,610 --> 02:36:15,443
Yeah.

5614
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:16,031
Wow.

5615
02:36:16,031 --> 02:36:16,481
So everybody,

5616
02:36:16,481 --> 02:36:17,620
but everybody does.

5617
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:19,900
People are always taking pictures of shit.

5618
02:36:20,530 --> 02:36:21,940
You'd take pictures of your kids in there

5619
02:36:23,470 --> 02:36:24,010
anyway.

5620
02:36:24,010 --> 02:36:25,090
It looks real similar to that.

5621
02:36:25,300 --> 02:36:25,901
But yeah,

5622
02:36:25,901 --> 02:36:28,030
that guy had way too much money.

5623
02:36:28,150 --> 02:36:29,710
He brought over wild boars.

5624
02:36:29,711 --> 02:36:32,320
He's the reason why California
has a wild pig problem.

5625
02:36:32,350 --> 02:36:33,070
Oh Shit.

5626
02:36:33,070 --> 02:36:33,730
Yes.

5627
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:34,630
Wow.

5628
02:36:34,660 --> 02:36:36,880
Him that Fuck God damn.

5629
02:36:36,881 --> 02:36:37,714
Yeah.

5630
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:39,130
Wild boars and they didn't,

5631
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:39,910
they'd go hunt them.

5632
02:36:39,910 --> 02:36:40,743
Yeah,

5633
02:36:41,110 --> 02:36:41,943
he brought them here.

5634
02:36:42,070 --> 02:36:42,610
Wow.

5635
02:36:42,610 --> 02:36:43,780
That's why there's a whole like,

5636
02:36:43,810 --> 02:36:45,040
it's not down here.

5637
02:36:45,390 --> 02:36:46,900
So he's not in southern California.

5638
02:36:47,080 --> 02:36:47,913
They're all up there.

5639
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:48,470
Yeah,

5640
02:36:48,470 --> 02:36:48,640
they're,

5641
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:50,320
they're slowly making their way down here.

5642
02:36:50,890 --> 02:36:52,360
But the ones that are down here,

5643
02:36:52,361 --> 02:36:56,080
the closest they are is to
hone ranch to hone ranches,

5644
02:36:56,081 --> 02:36:56,251
uh,

5645
02:36:56,251 --> 02:36:57,610
about an hour and a half from here.

5646
02:36:57,910 --> 02:36:58,430
And uh,

5647
02:36:58,430 --> 02:36:59,263
they have wild pig.

5648
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:02,930
Is it that hard to just get a bunch of
guys with AK 47 [inaudible] and hunt him

5649
02:37:02,931 --> 02:37:03,764
down.

5650
02:37:03,830 --> 02:37:04,770
Stop that hard.

5651
02:37:04,771 --> 02:37:06,210
But you can't do that in California,

5652
02:37:06,690 --> 02:37:07,231
California.

5653
02:37:07,231 --> 02:37:11,070
You can get depredation permits and
they have gotten depredation permits and

5654
02:37:11,071 --> 02:37:14,550
they hunt them at night with night vision
because sometimes the pigs will start

5655
02:37:14,551 --> 02:37:15,950
making their way into agriculture

5656
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,160
or they start making their way into the,

5657
02:37:18,170 --> 02:37:22,190
like Dell lay down some fresh sod and
put some grass down and these pigs will

5658
02:37:22,191 --> 02:37:25,580
destroy thousands of dollars
in landscaping damage.

5659
02:37:25,581 --> 02:37:26,240
So yeah,

5660
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:28,040
when they prove that that's happening,

5661
02:37:28,041 --> 02:37:31,730
then they get a special permit and
then they can just start whacking.

5662
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:32,330
Yeah.

5663
02:37:32,330 --> 02:37:35,600
And then they just take out like
everything at night and they do it with,

5664
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:36,530
you know,

5665
02:37:36,530 --> 02:37:37,760
sniper rifles and shit.

5666
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:39,980
But then when I'm,

5667
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:43,820
a normal person wants to like say
if you wanted to kill a wild pig,

5668
02:37:44,550 --> 02:37:46,730
you can get as many
licenses as you'd like.

5669
02:37:46,970 --> 02:37:48,410
You can get five licenses,

5670
02:37:48,411 --> 02:37:51,410
you can get six so you can go
out and shoot six pigs in a day.

5671
02:37:51,411 --> 02:37:52,640
It's totally legal,

5672
02:37:52,700 --> 02:37:55,840
so long as you pay for each
individual tag because the,

5673
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:57,530
the understanding is that it,

5674
02:37:57,531 --> 02:37:58,910
at least in most places,

5675
02:37:58,911 --> 02:38:01,730
California's the only place that treats
it like game and most places you don't

5676
02:38:01,731 --> 02:38:03,200
even have to have tags for them.

5677
02:38:03,590 --> 02:38:06,800
Most places they're encouraging you to
shoot him and that'll probably be the

5678
02:38:06,801 --> 02:38:08,360
case in California eventually.

5679
02:38:08,510 --> 02:38:09,980
Like it isn't like Texas,

5680
02:38:09,981 --> 02:38:10,940
France for instance.

5681
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:11,300
Right.

5682
02:38:11,300 --> 02:38:14,330
Texas has a real pig problem
if they have a giant,

5683
02:38:14,510 --> 02:38:15,380
oh shit,

5684
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:17,540
there's millions and millions
and millions of pigs.

5685
02:38:17,630 --> 02:38:17,841
Oh,

5686
02:38:17,841 --> 02:38:20,720
I remember that from the Friday night
late show at the Improv and Houston.

5687
02:38:24,570 --> 02:38:26,090
You said that with,

5688
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:29,960
you really had me believing
that you didn't believe it
and you're setting up the

5689
02:38:29,961 --> 02:38:30,860
joke the whole time.

5690
02:38:30,890 --> 02:38:31,520
It's nice.

5691
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:33,350
I think it's like that
with alligators in Florida.

5692
02:38:33,740 --> 02:38:34,310
Yeah.

5693
02:38:34,310 --> 02:38:34,941
When I was a kid,

5694
02:38:34,941 --> 02:38:36,860
they were an endangered species.

5695
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:40,160
They would ask us to please not feed
the marshmallows because I lived in

5696
02:38:40,161 --> 02:38:40,994
Gainesville.

5697
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:41,391
All right.

5698
02:38:41,391 --> 02:38:42,710
By this place called Lake Alice.

5699
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:43,070
Yeah,

5700
02:38:43,070 --> 02:38:43,520
Lake Alice.

5701
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:46,520
At alligators fucking 11 years old.

5702
02:38:46,521 --> 02:38:46,611
I was,

5703
02:38:46,611 --> 02:38:48,310
I was in an alligator's was crazy.

5704
02:38:48,311 --> 02:38:48,760
Yeah,

5705
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:49,970
it was a goddamn dinosaur.

5706
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:53,690
But there was a small population of
them cause they had been whacked into

5707
02:38:53,691 --> 02:38:56,030
oblivion before and people are
making suitcases out of them.

5708
02:38:56,330 --> 02:38:59,810
And then they made it illegal to hunt
them and they made him a protected

5709
02:38:59,811 --> 02:39:00,231
species.

5710
02:39:00,231 --> 02:39:01,610
But then they fucked up.

5711
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:05,240
They overprotected and those God
damn super lizards are everywhere.

5712
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:06,990
Fucking everywhere.

5713
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:12,300
My mom belongs to a golf course down in
Florida where she lives and there's this

5714
02:39:12,301 --> 02:39:15,840
alligator's apparently like
this fucking 14 foot alligator.

5715
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:16,763
And uh,

5716
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:19,920
that people were playing golf and there
was a deer and everybody's on the,

5717
02:39:19,930 --> 02:39:21,180
everybody's standing there going like,

5718
02:39:21,330 --> 02:39:22,060
it's a deer.

5719
02:39:22,060 --> 02:39:22,893
It's a deer.

5720
02:39:23,010 --> 02:39:23,401
Look at that.

5721
02:39:23,401 --> 02:39:23,830
Beautiful.

5722
02:39:23,830 --> 02:39:25,290
They're fucking alligator,

5723
02:39:25,291 --> 02:39:25,801
comes out,

5724
02:39:25,801 --> 02:39:26,640
grabs it,

5725
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:28,230
pulls it into the water,

5726
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:29,760
does that spin move?

5727
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:31,590
Takes it to the bottom.

5728
02:39:31,591 --> 02:39:32,670
Fucking done.

5729
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:35,220
So everyone's talking about it.

5730
02:39:35,221 --> 02:39:36,180
What do we do about it?

5731
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:39,120
So about three weeks later,

5732
02:39:39,150 --> 02:39:43,530
my mom is out on the course and her
ball is right next to the lake where the

5733
02:39:43,531 --> 02:39:48,531
alligator is and she forgets and she goes
over and her ball is right on the edge

5734
02:39:49,081 --> 02:39:53,250
and she's standing there and she was
standing on some fucking like dead,

5735
02:39:53,550 --> 02:39:58,550
some dead grass and it gave out and she
fell in the fucking lake up to her neck.

5736
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:06,080
And then she remembered and she fucking
started scrambling up the mud and

5737
02:40:07,020 --> 02:40:09,090
grabbing if the reeds to get out of there.

5738
02:40:09,091 --> 02:40:11,850
And her and the people that
who she was with had left,

5739
02:40:12,510 --> 02:40:13,980
she was by herself for

5740
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:18,060
some reason and she fucking got out
of there and got in the cart and,

5741
02:40:18,170 --> 02:40:19,500
and then she just started laughing.

5742
02:40:19,830 --> 02:40:20,663
Oh my God.

5743
02:40:22,120 --> 02:40:23,310
You believe that shit.

5744
02:40:23,430 --> 02:40:24,390
My little mother,

5745
02:40:24,391 --> 02:40:26,130
my little five foot two mother,

5746
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:31,160
oh my God would have been a
tasty meal happened so quick.

5747
02:40:33,210 --> 02:40:35,040
Better than a dear old lady.

5748
02:40:35,041 --> 02:40:35,311
Nice.

5749
02:40:35,311 --> 02:40:35,731
Soft.

5750
02:40:35,731 --> 02:40:36,630
All Lady.

5751
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:37,590
Way more tender.

5752
02:40:37,890 --> 02:40:38,723
Yeah.

5753
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:39,990
Corn Fed.

5754
02:40:41,580 --> 02:40:42,391
My mom's corn fed.

5755
02:40:42,391 --> 02:40:43,224
I never told you that.

5756
02:40:43,420 --> 02:40:43,660
Yeah.

5757
02:40:43,660 --> 02:40:44,190
Yeah.

5758
02:40:44,190 --> 02:40:45,840
I thought she was organic now.

5759
02:40:45,841 --> 02:40:46,110
No,

5760
02:40:46,110 --> 02:40:47,160
we let her free range.

5761
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:48,113
Sometimes

5762
02:40:49,750 --> 02:40:51,610
there's a great story about a car chase.

5763
02:40:51,820 --> 02:40:56,470
The cops were chasing this too was
stolen car and the guy jumps off a bridge

5764
02:40:56,530 --> 02:40:59,200
into the water and immediately
gets eaten by alligators.

5765
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:00,600
Wow.

5766
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:03,010
He's like a little overpass over river,

5767
02:41:03,130 --> 02:41:05,320
which is hops out of the fucking car,

5768
02:41:05,321 --> 02:41:07,720
jumps into the river and smash.

5769
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:10,300
He lands right in front of an alligator.

5770
02:41:10,480 --> 02:41:13,240
No Sheldon Jackson in front of the cops.

5771
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:14,880
Wow.

5772
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:16,993
What do you do

5773
02:41:17,060 --> 02:41:17,691
of your cop?

5774
02:41:17,691 --> 02:41:18,950
Do you shoot at the alligator?

5775
02:41:18,980 --> 02:41:20,900
Do you try to kill the
alligator was killing the guy.

5776
02:41:20,930 --> 02:41:21,620
Good point.

5777
02:41:21,620 --> 02:41:21,861
I mean,

5778
02:41:21,861 --> 02:41:25,010
that's a reckless thing to be doing when
there's a lot of thrashing around you

5779
02:41:25,011 --> 02:41:26,630
just going to empty your clip.

5780
02:41:26,720 --> 02:41:27,001
Pat,

5781
02:41:27,001 --> 02:41:27,231
Pat,

5782
02:41:27,231 --> 02:41:28,064
pat,

5783
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:28,410
you know,

5784
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:28,611
I mean,

5785
02:41:28,611 --> 02:41:31,780
how much distance is there between
the bridge and the water would right

5786
02:41:32,340 --> 02:41:32,971
do well,

5787
02:41:32,971 --> 02:41:34,200
you know the guy's going to die.

5788
02:41:34,201 --> 02:41:35,034
So I think it's,

5789
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:37,200
I think it's a safe bet to take some shots

5790
02:41:37,290 --> 02:41:37,770
anyway.

5791
02:41:37,770 --> 02:41:41,130
I think it's a not safe bet to take
some shots because if you're a cop would

5792
02:41:41,131 --> 02:41:42,540
have you hit the guy and they said,

5793
02:41:42,570 --> 02:41:42,691
oh,

5794
02:41:42,691 --> 02:41:46,380
you shot and trying to cover
up by fucking alligators.

5795
02:41:46,381 --> 02:41:47,210
Eat them.

5796
02:41:47,210 --> 02:41:48,043
It's true.

5797
02:41:48,130 --> 02:41:49,310
You got to let the alligator eat them.

5798
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:54,110
Now go save your job here about the
guy who was the guy flying a plane from

5799
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:56,220
Florida to Cuba or,

5800
02:41:56,430 --> 02:41:57,620
or Cuba to Florida,

5801
02:41:57,710 --> 02:42:02,710
and the plain fucking went down and he
survived the crash and then got eaten by

5802
02:42:04,791 --> 02:42:05,624
sharks.

5803
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:12,160
That's so fun.

5804
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:16,100
Is that that 20 minute period
where you're floating in the water,

5805
02:42:16,101 --> 02:42:18,230
but you're thankful and
you're almost giddy?

5806
02:42:18,440 --> 02:42:19,250
I did it.

5807
02:42:19,250 --> 02:42:20,540
I fucking survived.

5808
02:42:20,570 --> 02:42:21,403
Oh my God.

5809
02:42:21,860 --> 02:42:22,550
Yeah.

5810
02:42:22,550 --> 02:42:23,383
Bad Day.

5811
02:42:23,510 --> 02:42:23,661
Well,

5812
02:42:23,661 --> 02:42:26,600
you know that story about the World War
Two boat that sank and the guys were

5813
02:42:26,601 --> 02:42:29,720
floating around at sea for several days
and most of them got eaten by sharks.

5814
02:42:29,810 --> 02:42:30,350
Oof.

5815
02:42:30,350 --> 02:42:33,080
That's the store that they talk
about in the beginning of jaws.

5816
02:42:33,550 --> 02:42:34,383
Yeah.

5817
02:42:34,840 --> 02:42:36,230
Remember where the captain,

5818
02:42:36,730 --> 02:42:38,640
the captains at the fucking scars,

5819
02:42:38,641 --> 02:42:40,320
and he starts talking about his,

5820
02:42:40,321 --> 02:42:40,531
uh,

5821
02:42:40,531 --> 02:42:41,490
his time on the boat.

5822
02:42:41,910 --> 02:42:42,743
Do you remember that scene?

5823
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:43,531
Scheider no,

5824
02:42:43,531 --> 02:42:44,251
not Roy Scheider.

5825
02:42:44,251 --> 02:42:45,480
The guy was talking to Roy Scheider.

5826
02:42:45,620 --> 02:42:46,453
Okay.

5827
02:42:46,610 --> 02:42:47,370
Who's that guy?

5828
02:42:47,370 --> 02:42:48,330
What's that guy's name again?

5829
02:42:48,810 --> 02:42:50,850
Old Time Act to the guy
was fucking amazing.

5830
02:42:52,010 --> 02:42:54,000
Spool up jaws to quick.

5831
02:42:54,001 --> 02:42:54,834
Richard Dreyfus.

5832
02:42:54,930 --> 02:42:55,251
No,

5833
02:42:55,251 --> 02:42:55,440
no,

5834
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:55,591
no,

5835
02:42:55,591 --> 02:42:55,880
no,

5836
02:42:55,880 --> 02:42:56,070
no,

5837
02:42:56,070 --> 02:42:56,131
no,

5838
02:42:56,131 --> 02:42:56,310
no.

5839
02:42:56,310 --> 02:42:57,780
Richard Dreyfus was the scientist.

5840
02:42:58,050 --> 02:42:59,580
Roy Scheider was the sheriff.

5841
02:42:59,581 --> 02:43:01,170
Richard Dreyfus was the scientist.

5842
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:01,891
And then there's,

5843
02:43:01,891 --> 02:43:02,280
uh,

5844
02:43:02,280 --> 02:43:03,180
an older gentleman.

5845
02:43:04,110 --> 02:43:05,580
Oh yeah.

5846
02:43:05,581 --> 02:43:06,410
Right.

5847
02:43:06,410 --> 02:43:07,480
He steals that fucking,

5848
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:08,633
yeah,

5849
02:43:08,730 --> 02:43:09,990
he steals up movie.

5850
02:43:10,140 --> 02:43:10,973
Where is he?

5851
02:43:10,990 --> 02:43:11,823
Right here.

5852
02:43:11,950 --> 02:43:12,100
He

5853
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:13,510
steals that fucking movie.

5854
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:17,470
He steals how fucking
movie you believe him.

5855
02:43:17,620 --> 02:43:17,831
Wait,

5856
02:43:17,831 --> 02:43:18,970
so what was the opening scene?

5857
02:43:19,890 --> 02:43:21,030
Not the opening scene,

5858
02:43:21,060 --> 02:43:23,370
but he describes what it was like.

5859
02:43:23,640 --> 02:43:23,791
No,

5860
02:43:23,791 --> 02:43:25,080
that's a different shark attack.

5861
02:43:25,660 --> 02:43:26,700
So typed in World War II.

5862
02:43:26,710 --> 02:43:27,541
Show the naval ship.

5863
02:43:27,541 --> 02:43:27,691
Yeah,

5864
02:43:27,691 --> 02:43:28,051
that's it.

5865
02:43:28,051 --> 02:43:28,411
That's it.

5866
02:43:28,411 --> 02:43:28,980
I'm sorry.

5867
02:43:28,980 --> 02:43:29,551
I was thinking,

5868
02:43:29,551 --> 02:43:29,850
um,

5869
02:43:29,850 --> 02:43:31,350
when it says worst
shark attack in history,

5870
02:43:31,351 --> 02:43:34,770
I was thinking it was that story about
New Jersey where the bull sharks killed

5871
02:43:34,771 --> 02:43:35,604
people.

5872
02:43:36,060 --> 02:43:37,770
Scroll back up so I can
see what it says here.

5873
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:42,870
1945 US naval ship was sunk
by a Japanese submarine.

5874
02:43:42,871 --> 02:43:45,450
The ship's sinking was just the
beginning of the sailors nightmare.

5875
02:43:45,451 --> 02:43:45,631
Yeah.

5876
02:43:45,631 --> 02:43:46,410
That's the boat.

5877
02:43:46,410 --> 02:43:47,243
That's the story.

5878
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:48,270
How many people died?

5879
02:43:48,330 --> 02:43:48,571
Hello?

5880
02:43:48,571 --> 02:43:49,500
Shit load.

5881
02:43:50,070 --> 02:43:50,903
Let's see,

5882
02:43:50,980 --> 02:43:55,980
that's 200 and oh don't most 300 people
died of the 1,196 men aboard 900 made it

5883
02:43:59,940 --> 02:44:01,290
into the water alive.

5884
02:44:01,320 --> 02:44:02,153
Oh,

5885
02:44:02,270 --> 02:44:03,210
there are a deal.

5886
02:44:03,960 --> 02:44:04,620
So that's,

5887
02:44:04,620 --> 02:44:07,170
that's how many survived the crash.

5888
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:10,260
So there's 900 of them that are alive now.

5889
02:44:10,261 --> 02:44:11,880
How many of them make it to the end

5890
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:17,000
out of 900 scroll and Scroll
and Scroll and Scroll up.

5891
02:44:17,190 --> 02:44:18,200
Data's pass.

5892
02:44:18,710 --> 02:44:18,891
Yeah,

5893
02:44:18,891 --> 02:44:19,311
this is,

5894
02:44:19,311 --> 02:44:21,680
they're just giving you the full line of
the story that not giving you just the

5895
02:44:21,681 --> 02:44:22,640
actual facts.

5896
02:44:23,350 --> 02:44:26,360
317 317 remained.

5897
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:27,313
So,

5898
02:44:28,060 --> 02:44:28,570
okay,

5899
02:44:28,570 --> 02:44:30,850
so almost 600 people got to eat

5900
02:44:31,250 --> 02:44:34,880
estimates of the number who die from
shark attacks range from a few dozen to

5901
02:44:34,881 --> 02:44:36,440
almost 150

5902
02:44:36,510 --> 02:44:38,220
so the other people die from other things.

5903
02:44:38,221 --> 02:44:39,270
Starvation probably.

5904
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:40,040
Oh,

5905
02:44:40,040 --> 02:44:41,760
heat stroke being in the water,

5906
02:44:42,030 --> 02:44:42,863
it could be a lot.

5907
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:44,850
And so I bet when those guys died,

5908
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:46,800
then the sharks ate them
and it got even worse.

5909
02:44:47,010 --> 02:44:47,940
Fuck man.

5910
02:44:48,150 --> 02:44:48,983
Wow,

5911
02:44:49,050 --> 02:44:50,160
that's fucking crazy.

5912
02:44:50,161 --> 02:44:52,860
Just imagine 150 people eaten by sharks,

5913
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:57,060
the amount of blood in
the water fucking Christ

5914
02:44:59,270 --> 02:44:59,900
did.

5915
02:44:59,900 --> 02:45:00,720
You know?

5916
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:05,610
But when you're around any kind of
thing that can eat you and kill you,

5917
02:45:05,730 --> 02:45:07,830
it puts it all into
perspective that you're not,

5918
02:45:07,980 --> 02:45:09,270
you're not around that enough.

5919
02:45:09,630 --> 02:45:10,500
And it's not,

5920
02:45:10,650 --> 02:45:12,420
it's not like you should
be around it all the time,

5921
02:45:12,421 --> 02:45:13,830
but you should know it's a real thing.

5922
02:45:14,070 --> 02:45:14,970
And when you're around it,

5923
02:45:14,971 --> 02:45:15,450
you go like,

5924
02:45:15,450 --> 02:45:16,283
oh,

5925
02:45:16,710 --> 02:45:17,640
oh sharks just,

5926
02:45:17,670 --> 02:45:18,720
we'll just eat you.

5927
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:19,490
Oh,

5928
02:45:19,490 --> 02:45:20,670
a bear will just eat you.

5929
02:45:20,970 --> 02:45:21,570
Oh,

5930
02:45:21,570 --> 02:45:22,201
how bout in line?

5931
02:45:22,201 --> 02:45:23,034
We'll just eat you.

5932
02:45:23,310 --> 02:45:24,143
Oh,

5933
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:26,700
like these people that got
killed this year was a,

5934
02:45:26,701 --> 02:45:27,840
or 2018 at least,

5935
02:45:27,841 --> 02:45:28,674
was very rare.

5936
02:45:28,710 --> 02:45:30,420
And that two people were documented,

5937
02:45:30,421 --> 02:45:32,490
killed by mountain lions
in the Pacific northwest.

5938
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:33,690
One guy in Portland,

5939
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:34,621
outside of Portland,

5940
02:45:34,621 --> 02:45:35,790
and one guy outside of Seattle.

5941
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:38,010
It's pretty rare that
mountain lions do that.

5942
02:45:38,550 --> 02:45:39,840
But Oh,

5943
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:41,430
mountain lions would just eat you.

5944
02:45:41,910 --> 02:45:42,600
Oh,

5945
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:43,420
that can happen too.

5946
02:45:43,420 --> 02:45:45,630
Like we think we're so safe

5947
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:46,690
and I think it,

5948
02:45:46,690 --> 02:45:47,251
I think you're ready.

5949
02:45:47,251 --> 02:45:48,220
We'll keep you in the moment.

5950
02:45:48,221 --> 02:45:50,430
I think we should release like grizzly.

5951
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:51,040
Yes,

5952
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:54,410
in cities just because like
you might be worried about,

5953
02:45:54,430 --> 02:45:54,540
oh,

5954
02:45:54,540 --> 02:45:56,590
am I the fucking stock market's down,

5955
02:45:56,591 --> 02:45:58,000
or I think my wife's cheating.

5956
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:00,700
And you're right back in the,

5957
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:01,230
yeah,

5958
02:46:01,230 --> 02:46:02,063
you're in the moment,

5959
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:04,500
but then you're going to have to allow
people to be armed to protect themselves.

5960
02:46:04,501 --> 02:46:05,760
Guys going to have open carry,

5961
02:46:06,300 --> 02:46:09,260
fucking ar slung around their shoulders
looking out for bears everywhere.

5962
02:46:09,560 --> 02:46:10,341
Taking your kid to school,

5963
02:46:10,341 --> 02:46:11,300
you'd better bring the rifle.

5964
02:46:12,890 --> 02:46:14,300
She's only two blocks away,

5965
02:46:14,750 --> 02:46:15,080
bro.

5966
02:46:15,080 --> 02:46:15,870
Bringing the rifle.

5967
02:46:15,870 --> 02:46:17,360
I saw bear here a couple of days ago,

5968
02:46:17,390 --> 02:46:17,870
right?

5969
02:46:17,870 --> 02:46:21,410
Imagine you walk outside your house and
you hear a branch snap and you turn and

5970
02:46:21,411 --> 02:46:25,370
you see a 900 pound wild dog like thing,

5971
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:26,750
and that's not it.

5972
02:46:26,750 --> 02:46:27,570
That's not one shy.

5973
02:46:27,570 --> 02:46:29,690
That's gotta be a pretty good
gun to take that thing down.

5974
02:46:30,050 --> 02:46:32,150
You're not going to take it out
with like a nine millimeter.

5975
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:32,900
Yeah.

5976
02:46:32,900 --> 02:46:34,040
It's just going to eat your bullets.

5977
02:46:34,050 --> 02:46:34,820
Right?

5978
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:35,810
It's gonna kill you anyway.

5979
02:46:35,930 --> 02:46:37,010
Fuck yeah.

5980
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:38,340
Okay.

5981
02:46:38,340 --> 02:46:39,173
You'd have to,

5982
02:46:39,210 --> 02:46:42,960
you'd have to have a perfect shot right
in the perfect part of its brain to shut

5983
02:46:42,961 --> 02:46:45,600
it off quick to prevent
you from getting mauled.

5984
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:48,380
The amount of strength that they have to,

5985
02:46:48,381 --> 02:46:50,150
you'd be like a water balloon.

5986
02:46:50,500 --> 02:46:52,220
I feel like tearing open a bag.

5987
02:46:52,250 --> 02:46:54,410
Like a Ziploc bag full of Jello.

5988
02:46:54,440 --> 02:46:55,273
Yeah.

5989
02:46:55,310 --> 02:46:56,570
They just rip you apart.

5990
02:46:56,830 --> 02:46:58,610
He had gone back to that movie revenant.

5991
02:46:58,790 --> 02:47:01,730
That fucking bear attack was insane.

5992
02:47:01,830 --> 02:47:04,190
My bear tags nothing compared
to what really happens.

5993
02:47:04,620 --> 02:47:07,220
Like if he really got bit
by a bear be like that,

5994
02:47:07,221 --> 02:47:09,500
like he probably would be destroyed.

5995
02:47:09,950 --> 02:47:12,080
Like I think the guy that was the,

5996
02:47:12,170 --> 02:47:14,300
that we're really happened
to them in real life.

5997
02:47:14,301 --> 02:47:16,700
It's kind of based really
loosely on a story.

5998
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:20,060
I think he got kind of like a
little malt and that was enough.

5999
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:20,420
Yeah.

6000
02:47:20,420 --> 02:47:24,080
A little malt leave you like that would
that bear was throwing him around for

6001
02:47:24,081 --> 02:47:24,330
like,

6002
02:47:24,330 --> 02:47:25,160
yeah,

6003
02:47:25,160 --> 02:47:26,090
that bear would have killed you.

6004
02:47:26,120 --> 02:47:26,660
Yeah.

6005
02:47:26,660 --> 02:47:28,130
You'd have no bones left.

6006
02:47:28,300 --> 02:47:28,570
Right.

6007
02:47:28,570 --> 02:47:31,070
Snapped everything into a fine powder.

6008
02:47:31,700 --> 02:47:33,440
Just crush you and then eat you.

6009
02:47:33,441 --> 02:47:33,710
Right.

6010
02:47:33,710 --> 02:47:34,191
I'm fuck,

6011
02:47:34,191 --> 02:47:34,401
yeah.

6012
02:47:34,401 --> 02:47:35,180
Why not eat you?

6013
02:47:35,180 --> 02:47:36,500
Especially when she starts stinking.

6014
02:47:36,710 --> 02:47:37,820
They like to bury things,

6015
02:47:38,150 --> 02:47:39,080
let them rot for awhile.

6016
02:47:40,580 --> 02:47:41,413
They do.

6017
02:47:41,420 --> 02:47:46,420
My friend Adam and he shot a moose in
Canada and a bear's claimed it and he went

6018
02:47:46,971 --> 02:47:48,020
back and there's a video of it.

6019
02:47:48,021 --> 02:47:49,520
It's so spooky.

6020
02:47:49,610 --> 02:47:50,460
Whoa.

6021
02:47:50,480 --> 02:47:51,590
Says buried.

6022
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:53,900
It's a giant big ass moose.

6023
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:54,861
By the time they got,

6024
02:47:54,861 --> 02:47:55,041
you know,

6025
02:47:55,041 --> 02:47:56,510
they shoot it and then it goes,

6026
02:47:56,570 --> 02:47:58,340
it runs away and then
you have to track it.

6027
02:47:58,341 --> 02:47:59,150
You have to let it,

6028
02:47:59,150 --> 02:47:59,983
let it die.

6029
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:00,801
It takes a little while.

6030
02:48:00,801 --> 02:48:03,980
So the smart thing to do is
to sit out for a couple hours.

6031
02:48:04,310 --> 02:48:05,630
It'll be dead for sure.

6032
02:48:05,900 --> 02:48:10,160
But what you don't want to do
is spook it while it's injured.

6033
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:10,401
If,

6034
02:48:10,401 --> 02:48:11,630
if it's not a perfect hit,

6035
02:48:11,690 --> 02:48:12,590
if it runs away,

6036
02:48:12,950 --> 02:48:14,480
because then it's gonna just keep running.

6037
02:48:14,481 --> 02:48:16,130
You can run for a long time on adrenaline.

6038
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:16,941
So the,

6039
02:48:16,941 --> 02:48:17,151
the,

6040
02:48:17,151 --> 02:48:19,790
the correct move is if you
don't see an animal die,

6041
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:20,591
you don't see,

6042
02:48:20,591 --> 02:48:21,530
you see it run into the woods.

6043
02:48:21,740 --> 02:48:25,220
You wait and you wait just
as a precautionary mother.

6044
02:48:25,370 --> 02:48:25,660
Well,

6045
02:48:25,660 --> 02:48:25,830
the,

6046
02:48:25,830 --> 02:48:29,030
the animal died in seconds and
a bear claimed it immediately.

6047
02:48:29,390 --> 02:48:31,160
It died probably right in front of them.

6048
02:48:31,190 --> 02:48:32,180
What state was this?

6049
02:48:32,210 --> 02:48:33,260
This was in Alaska.

6050
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:36,020
So the bear is there.

6051
02:48:36,080 --> 02:48:37,490
The Moose dies right in front of them.

6052
02:48:37,491 --> 02:48:37,760
It's like,

6053
02:48:37,760 --> 02:48:38,593
oh look at that.

6054
02:48:38,810 --> 02:48:39,643
That's mine.

6055
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:40,610
Yeah.

6056
02:48:40,610 --> 02:48:43,010
It starts eating it and
he starts covering it up.

6057
02:48:43,370 --> 02:48:44,870
So eat some of it covers it up.

6058
02:48:44,871 --> 02:48:49,130
They come tracking and an hour later
or so it's already covered in dirt.

6059
02:48:49,550 --> 02:48:50,330
Wow.

6060
02:48:50,330 --> 02:48:50,750
I'm like,

6061
02:48:50,750 --> 02:48:51,740
oh no,

6062
02:48:51,770 --> 02:48:53,600
that's crazy.

6063
02:48:53,660 --> 02:48:54,920
Oh yeah.

6064
02:48:54,980 --> 02:48:56,300
Holy Shit.

6065
02:48:56,680 --> 02:48:57,020
Yeah.

6066
02:48:57,020 --> 02:48:58,370
Fuck No.

6067
02:48:58,371 --> 02:48:59,130
I don't know.

6068
02:48:59,130 --> 02:49:02,540
Think about what would it take to
take fucking frozen ground myself.

6069
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:06,770
They might have shot it and taken some
of the meat and we're going back to pack

6070
02:49:06,771 --> 02:49:07,470
it out.

6071
02:49:07,470 --> 02:49:09,900
Cause sometimes when you hunt
you'll hunt with one person,

6072
02:49:10,110 --> 02:49:10,391
but when,

6073
02:49:10,391 --> 02:49:12,240
then you go back to pack out a big animal,

6074
02:49:12,241 --> 02:49:14,070
you bring like five or
six guys to help you.

6075
02:49:14,430 --> 02:49:15,600
But this is the video of it.

6076
02:49:15,840 --> 02:49:17,040
They'll get this to give me some volume.

6077
02:49:18,970 --> 02:49:20,270
Oh Moose is very,

6078
02:49:25,610 --> 02:49:27,140
whoa,

6079
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:28,593
okay.

6080
02:49:29,990 --> 02:49:30,980
Yeah I don't like this.

6081
02:49:36,770 --> 02:49:38,060
So everything is like,

6082
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:38,421
you know,

6083
02:49:38,421 --> 02:49:41,390
five and a half feet
high grass or you know,

6084
02:49:41,391 --> 02:49:44,600
you see how tall is that grass
for four and a half feet at least.

6085
02:49:44,670 --> 02:49:44,860
Yeah.

6086
02:49:44,860 --> 02:49:46,580
So bears could be in that shit.

6087
02:49:47,250 --> 02:49:48,590
They could be hunkered down in that shit.

6088
02:49:48,770 --> 02:49:52,490
So I'm seeing the skull on the
ground and the skull skinned out.

6089
02:49:52,520 --> 02:49:55,560
So what that means to me is that he
had already started butchering the,

6090
02:49:55,580 --> 02:49:57,680
the Moose and probably went back to it.

6091
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:02,480
So that's kind of correct that whether
that was right about that or not,

6092
02:50:02,930 --> 02:50:04,070
but so this is what happened.

6093
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:04,850
Um,

6094
02:50:04,850 --> 02:50:07,550
they can only take some of the meat
because they were terrified the bear is

6095
02:50:07,551 --> 02:50:10,940
going to come back and I don't even think
they had a gun on them and you know,

6096
02:50:10,941 --> 02:50:12,080
they're just scanning the area,

6097
02:50:13,130 --> 02:50:13,681
see how the,

6098
02:50:13,681 --> 02:50:13,951
the,

6099
02:50:13,951 --> 02:50:17,270
the moots the head is
already off of the antlers,

6100
02:50:18,100 --> 02:50:18,680
you know?

6101
02:50:18,680 --> 02:50:20,090
And so this is the next video.

6102
02:50:22,480 --> 02:50:23,141
That's scary shit,

6103
02:50:23,141 --> 02:50:23,580
man.

6104
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:24,810
So they didn't even see the bear.

6105
02:50:24,830 --> 02:50:25,840
They just know it was a bear.

6106
02:50:25,900 --> 02:50:26,680
Exactly.

6107
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:27,513
Yeah.

6108
02:50:28,450 --> 02:50:33,040
Think about the strength to take
frozen earth like that and dig it out.

6109
02:50:33,260 --> 02:50:34,093
Yeah.

6110
02:50:34,730 --> 02:50:35,810
What's the type of bear,

6111
02:50:36,170 --> 02:50:36,411
you know,

6112
02:50:36,411 --> 02:50:37,790
if you run into a black bear,

6113
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,010
you're more likely to
be thought of as food.

6114
02:50:40,100 --> 02:50:40,933
It's kind of interesting,

6115
02:50:41,300 --> 02:50:42,091
like you're more like,

6116
02:50:42,091 --> 02:50:46,190
like predation on humans is
more common with black bears.

6117
02:50:46,220 --> 02:50:47,810
They just decide to try to eat you.

6118
02:50:48,380 --> 02:50:49,250
But uh,

6119
02:50:49,310 --> 02:50:50,390
with grizzlies,

6120
02:50:51,380 --> 02:50:52,410
grizzlies are rare.

6121
02:50:52,430 --> 02:50:54,500
It's rare that a grizzly decides to eat.

6122
02:50:54,501 --> 02:50:56,570
You decides to chase you down and eat you.

6123
02:50:56,571 --> 02:51:01,571
It's more common that you fuck up and
run into a female or you try to steal his

6124
02:51:01,851 --> 02:51:02,720
food like that.

6125
02:51:02,750 --> 02:51:05,330
Like they had to get the fuck out of
there because if he just decided to run at

6126
02:51:05,331 --> 02:51:05,630
them,

6127
02:51:05,630 --> 02:51:07,250
they got a real giant problem.

6128
02:51:07,251 --> 02:51:08,570
Most of the time of bear won't though.

6129
02:51:08,571 --> 02:51:09,231
They're cautious.

6130
02:51:09,231 --> 02:51:09,621
They'll stay,

6131
02:51:09,621 --> 02:51:11,600
they'll hang back cause they
figured what are you going to do?

6132
02:51:11,601 --> 02:51:12,710
You're gonna eat that whole Moose.

6133
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:13,731
You're going to leave me some.

6134
02:51:13,731 --> 02:51:14,564
I ate a bunch.

6135
02:51:14,690 --> 02:51:15,570
I'm going to wait a little while,

6136
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:16,401
see what the fuck you're doing.

6137
02:51:16,401 --> 02:51:17,450
He's probably full anyway,

6138
02:51:17,900 --> 02:51:18,980
but they had to get out of there.

6139
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:21,560
They only took her a little bit of the
meat and they took off like this is too

6140
02:51:21,561 --> 02:51:22,210
dangerous.

6141
02:51:22,210 --> 02:51:23,043
Wow.

6142
02:51:25,370 --> 02:51:26,350
They used to be everywhere,

6143
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:27,750
used to be everywhere in California.

6144
02:51:27,751 --> 02:51:28,920
That's why it's on our flag.

6145
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:30,600
We killed them all,

6146
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:31,500
not we.

6147
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:32,610
You and I were in Boston.

6148
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:32,881
Yeah.

6149
02:51:32,881 --> 02:51:34,260
We didn't kill anybody to kill anybody,

6150
02:51:34,290 --> 02:51:36,840
but they killed all the
grizzly bears in California,

6151
02:51:37,410 --> 02:51:38,880
but it's still on under state flag.

6152
02:51:39,220 --> 02:51:40,790
The state flag hasn't
a fucking grizzly bear,

6153
02:51:40,791 --> 02:51:42,330
but in California it
doesn't have any grizzlies.

6154
02:51:42,390 --> 02:51:43,110
Right.

6155
02:51:43,110 --> 02:51:43,770
It's weird.

6156
02:51:43,770 --> 02:51:43,951
Yeah.

6157
02:51:43,951 --> 02:51:45,690
I was in Alaska once and they were,

6158
02:51:45,720 --> 02:51:47,370
they were like raccoons.

6159
02:51:47,400 --> 02:51:50,100
They were behind restaurants
going through dumpsters,

6160
02:51:50,570 --> 02:51:51,540
grizzly walking around,

6161
02:51:51,541 --> 02:51:53,240
or brown bears or black bears.

6162
02:51:53,400 --> 02:51:54,360
I think they were.

6163
02:51:54,361 --> 02:51:54,750
I don't want,

6164
02:51:54,750 --> 02:51:55,160
other than that,

6165
02:51:55,160 --> 02:51:55,550
both,

6166
02:51:55,550 --> 02:51:56,420
they're both up there.

6167
02:51:56,510 --> 02:51:57,620
Black bears become more,

6168
02:51:57,700 --> 02:52:01,010
will they all become a problem if they
start getting around garbage cause then

6169
02:52:01,011 --> 02:52:01,580
they're smart.

6170
02:52:01,580 --> 02:52:02,540
They know where the garbage is.

6171
02:52:02,760 --> 02:52:03,593
Just keep returning.

6172
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:05,020
Right.

6173
02:52:05,020 --> 02:52:06,310
There's a place called Lovech,

6174
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:06,761
the vet,

6175
02:52:06,761 --> 02:52:07,530
California.

6176
02:52:07,530 --> 02:52:11,110
It's off the five and it's named that
way for the last guy to die in a bear

6177
02:52:11,111 --> 02:52:12,160
attack in California.

6178
02:52:12,250 --> 02:52:12,401
Oh,

6179
02:52:12,401 --> 02:52:12,970
really?

6180
02:52:12,970 --> 02:52:13,803
Yeah.

6181
02:52:13,810 --> 02:52:14,171
They're like,

6182
02:52:14,171 --> 02:52:16,780
enough he fuck enough.

6183
02:52:16,990 --> 02:52:20,140
Apparently they wound up digging this guy
up afterwards to find out the story is

6184
02:52:20,141 --> 02:52:21,520
true and he was just in pieces.

6185
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:24,393
Shit.

6186
02:52:25,350 --> 02:52:25,600
Alright,

6187
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:28,160
so coastal bear to bear,

6188
02:52:28,420 --> 02:52:29,320
bear attack,

6189
02:52:29,350 --> 02:52:34,350
shark attack or dying in a cryogenics
tank dying the crow would be way less

6190
02:52:35,381 --> 02:52:36,100
painful.

6191
02:52:36,100 --> 02:52:36,970
You would just freeze.

6192
02:52:37,060 --> 02:52:37,900
That's the way to go.

6193
02:52:38,050 --> 02:52:39,520
I don't know if that's
the way to go though,

6194
02:52:39,820 --> 02:52:41,140
because then you're
not going to get eaten.

6195
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:43,810
Like shouldn't you return to nature?

6196
02:52:43,840 --> 02:52:44,673
Yeah.

6197
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:48,340
I mean you really should be eating and I
would rather beat and by one of my con,

6198
02:52:48,341 --> 02:52:49,480
which is a ground animal,

6199
02:52:49,690 --> 02:52:51,160
those fucking cons in the water.

6200
02:52:51,240 --> 02:52:53,950
I get eaten by those heartless assholes
and don't even take care of their

6201
02:52:53,951 --> 02:52:54,430
babies.

6202
02:52:54,430 --> 02:52:55,040
Yeah.

6203
02:52:55,040 --> 02:52:55,361
You know,

6204
02:52:55,361 --> 02:52:56,980
a bear at least takes care of their young,

6205
02:52:57,290 --> 02:52:57,760
I mean they're,

6206
02:52:57,760 --> 02:52:58,300
they're,

6207
02:52:58,300 --> 02:52:59,133
they're shit eds.

6208
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:01,810
They eat their babies
too and especially males.

6209
02:53:01,870 --> 02:53:03,520
Males killed babies left and right.

6210
02:53:03,521 --> 02:53:05,620
They actually actively go
after them and kill them.

6211
02:53:05,740 --> 02:53:06,640
But sort of sharks,

6212
02:53:06,940 --> 02:53:07,300
sharks,

6213
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:09,460
sharks have inter wound competition.

6214
02:53:09,970 --> 02:53:11,950
They eat each other inside the womb.

6215
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:12,940
Oh no shit.

6216
02:53:13,420 --> 02:53:14,560
Wow.

6217
02:53:14,590 --> 02:53:15,880
You ever see like a,

6218
02:53:15,940 --> 02:53:17,890
an Mri of sharks in the womb?

6219
02:53:17,950 --> 02:53:20,410
Now it's a monster movie.

6220
02:53:20,830 --> 02:53:21,940
That's insane.

6221
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:22,833
Is that Real,

6222
02:53:24,130 --> 02:53:24,790
those images?

6223
02:53:24,790 --> 02:53:25,623
That's a good question.

6224
02:53:25,630 --> 02:53:28,270
I've seen those elements that I feel
like it might've been from a movie,

6225
02:53:28,271 --> 02:53:29,140
but I'm looking at now,

6226
02:53:29,320 --> 02:53:30,153
let's see.

6227
02:53:30,250 --> 02:53:31,083
I think it's real.

6228
02:53:31,090 --> 02:53:34,000
I think the reason why I thought it was
fake and then I found out it was real.

6229
02:53:34,001 --> 02:53:36,850
It's one of those either I thought it
was real and I found out it was fake or I

6230
02:53:36,851 --> 02:53:38,230
thought it was fake and
I found out it's real.

6231
02:53:38,530 --> 02:53:39,363
But the image is,

6232
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:40,091
if it's real,

6233
02:53:40,091 --> 02:53:41,200
it's fucking amazing.

6234
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:42,880
It's these little monsters inside,

6235
02:53:42,881 --> 02:53:43,570
uh,

6236
02:53:43,570 --> 02:53:44,980
inside a womb and then
you've got to think,

6237
02:53:45,670 --> 02:53:46,300
you know,

6238
02:53:46,300 --> 02:53:47,140
I guess no one had it.

6239
02:53:47,141 --> 02:53:47,800
Fuck it.

6240
02:53:47,800 --> 02:53:49,450
Cause they just lay the
eggs out in the men just,

6241
02:53:49,451 --> 02:53:50,320
just on the eggs.

6242
02:53:50,860 --> 02:53:51,280
Really?

6243
02:53:51,280 --> 02:53:51,581
Yeah.

6244
02:53:51,581 --> 02:53:52,270
That's how it works.

6245
02:53:52,270 --> 02:53:54,370
They don't fuck a terrible life.

6246
02:53:54,450 --> 02:53:55,300
Wow.

6247
02:53:55,320 --> 02:53:55,900
Yeah.

6248
02:53:55,900 --> 02:53:57,500
The women lay the eggs on the floor.

6249
02:53:57,501 --> 02:53:58,180
I could salmon.

6250
02:53:58,180 --> 02:53:58,871
That's what happens.

6251
02:53:58,871 --> 02:53:59,860
That happens with trout.

6252
02:54:00,460 --> 02:54:03,480
They lay the eggs out in the men
come by and shoot loads all over him.

6253
02:54:04,930 --> 02:54:07,120
And then the things pop up and
no one takes care of anybody.

6254
02:54:07,540 --> 02:54:08,373
Wow.

6255
02:54:08,710 --> 02:54:10,950
All those kids that
grow up without parents,

6256
02:54:10,970 --> 02:54:12,250
parents don't give a fuck about them.

6257
02:54:12,270 --> 02:54:13,103
The parents will eat them.

6258
02:54:13,420 --> 02:54:14,000
Yep.

6259
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:15,430
Happens all the time with a little fish.

6260
02:54:15,640 --> 02:54:17,020
No bigger fishes.

6261
02:54:17,021 --> 02:54:17,441
Hunger this,

6262
02:54:17,441 --> 02:54:17,950
eat that.

6263
02:54:17,950 --> 02:54:19,210
They don't even know if there was parking.

6264
02:54:19,250 --> 02:54:19,601
I'm hitting it.

6265
02:54:19,601 --> 02:54:20,434
I'm hungry.

6266
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:21,461
They just have,

6267
02:54:21,461 --> 02:54:25,780
they have a system of
maintaining a population and
when there's not enough food,

6268
02:54:25,990 --> 02:54:26,740
don't know.

6269
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:27,880
Some of you guys got to go,

6270
02:54:28,090 --> 02:54:28,901
I don't remember this.

6271
02:54:28,901 --> 02:54:29,840
And Finding Nemo was,

6272
02:54:29,900 --> 02:54:30,733
it wasn't in there.

6273
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:31,900
He fucking left it out.

6274
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:32,740
They didn't even eat.

6275
02:54:32,740 --> 02:54:33,573
Yeah.

6276
02:54:33,790 --> 02:54:34,960
All those bare movies.

6277
02:54:34,990 --> 02:54:36,360
The movies about bears from Disney,

6278
02:54:36,380 --> 02:54:37,000
they don't eat.

6279
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:37,300
Yeah.

6280
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:40,300
How come they're not chasing down
Moose and he didn't asshole first.

6281
02:54:40,301 --> 02:54:41,134
Hey

6282
02:54:42,410 --> 02:54:45,430
Taryn Bambi apart eaten
her face while back.

6283
02:54:45,431 --> 02:54:47,830
Legs are kicking and the
bears was holding him down.

6284
02:54:47,831 --> 02:54:48,011
Neat.

6285
02:54:48,011 --> 02:54:49,520
And like a grape eight.

6286
02:54:49,550 --> 02:54:50,410
That ass.

6287
02:54:50,820 --> 02:54:51,310
Yeah,

6288
02:54:51,310 --> 02:54:52,720
they go asshole first all the time.

6289
02:54:53,830 --> 02:54:54,663
Yeah.

6290
02:54:54,820 --> 02:54:55,630
It's um,

6291
02:54:55,630 --> 02:54:59,560
it's very inconvenient to show that
in the lion king to show how the law,

6292
02:54:59,590 --> 02:55:01,000
how do these lines were there?

6293
02:55:01,030 --> 02:55:01,820
Where's their food?

6294
02:55:01,820 --> 02:55:02,653
And they never eat.

6295
02:55:02,710 --> 02:55:03,560
Everything's a battle.

6296
02:55:03,720 --> 02:55:04,070
There were going

6297
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:06,470
to war with people trying to
rein retain their kingdom.

6298
02:55:06,570 --> 02:55:07,403
Right.

6299
02:55:07,910 --> 02:55:08,840
Where's the snack?

6300
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:09,680
Where's all the food?

6301
02:55:09,680 --> 02:55:10,430
Yeah.

6302
02:55:10,430 --> 02:55:10,910
How come?

6303
02:55:10,910 --> 02:55:12,200
How come I don't see that.

6304
02:55:12,650 --> 02:55:13,760
You're fucking with kids.

6305
02:55:13,761 --> 02:55:15,080
You're giving kids bad information.

6306
02:55:15,110 --> 02:55:19,400
That will be a great movie to do a feature
late length animated movie where you

6307
02:55:19,401 --> 02:55:21,020
show how it really works.

6308
02:55:21,050 --> 02:55:21,651
Oh my God.

6309
02:55:21,651 --> 02:55:22,240
The killing.

6310
02:55:22,240 --> 02:55:22,790
Awful.

6311
02:55:22,790 --> 02:55:23,280
Yeah.

6312
02:55:23,280 --> 02:55:24,113
Be Awful.

6313
02:55:25,310 --> 02:55:25,910
Yeah.

6314
02:55:25,910 --> 02:55:26,743
Cats.

6315
02:55:26,750 --> 02:55:29,450
Cats are the population
control of the world.

6316
02:55:30,080 --> 02:55:35,080
Those motherfuckers faster than everybody
can only eat meat and all they do is

6317
02:55:36,411 --> 02:55:38,870
just run around and try
to catch people slipping,

6318
02:55:39,650 --> 02:55:41,030
try to catch animals slipping,

6319
02:55:41,150 --> 02:55:41,760
tried to catch it,

6320
02:55:41,760 --> 02:55:42,890
and they're just,

6321
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:44,090
they're just Darwinism.

6322
02:55:44,120 --> 02:55:44,400
Yeah.

6323
02:55:44,400 --> 02:55:45,650
They'll eat bugs in lion king.

6324
02:55:45,770 --> 02:55:46,461
Come on.

6325
02:55:46,461 --> 02:55:47,294
Yeah,

6326
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:48,373
come on.

6327
02:55:48,380 --> 02:55:49,700
That's a bug that he just ate.

6328
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:49,941
Yeah.

6329
02:55:49,941 --> 02:55:50,271
It was like,

6330
02:55:50,271 --> 02:55:50,710
uh,

6331
02:55:50,710 --> 02:55:53,720
he met Tomato Puma and he showed them
how to get grubs or something like that.

6332
02:55:53,770 --> 02:55:55,430
And that's what ends up on me.

6333
02:55:55,450 --> 02:55:55,871
Fuck.

6334
02:55:55,871 --> 02:55:58,420
Kind of propaganda horse shit is this,

6335
02:55:58,421 --> 02:55:59,970
that God that's anti American.

6336
02:56:00,030 --> 02:56:02,810
What is the way his dad dies isn't
a stampede of like Willdabeast,

6337
02:56:02,930 --> 02:56:04,350
which he probably was attack.

6338
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:06,900
I just don't remember them showing
that and that movie at all.

6339
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:12,140
That's how they really see the problem
is kids grow up and they see this stuff

6340
02:56:12,170 --> 02:56:13,910
and the soft headed amongst them.

6341
02:56:14,380 --> 02:56:16,550
Well then think that animals
are really like that,

6342
02:56:16,820 --> 02:56:19,460
so they'll venture out into the
forest to try to make friends.

6343
02:56:19,910 --> 02:56:21,800
You just have to be open spiritually.

6344
02:56:22,040 --> 02:56:22,460
Yeah.

6345
02:56:22,460 --> 02:56:24,050
Just go to the lion's den.

6346
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:24,530
Yeah.

6347
02:56:24,530 --> 02:56:27,350
Open yourself up spiritually
and let the forest,

6348
02:56:27,351 --> 02:56:28,184
no,

6349
02:56:28,820 --> 02:56:29,531
I talked to a lady once,

6350
02:56:29,531 --> 02:56:32,840
she was a yoga lady and she was
talking about Colorado and she's like,

6351
02:56:32,841 --> 02:56:33,740
when I walk into the woods,

6352
02:56:33,741 --> 02:56:35,390
I just walk out there and say,

6353
02:56:35,870 --> 02:56:36,350
uh,

6354
02:56:36,350 --> 02:56:37,760
I'm walking out here with love.

6355
02:56:37,790 --> 02:56:38,810
Please do not harm me.

6356
02:56:39,290 --> 02:56:39,531
Like,

6357
02:56:39,531 --> 02:56:40,040
yeah,

6358
02:56:40,040 --> 02:56:41,000
that's not going to work.

6359
02:56:41,750 --> 02:56:43,910
They'd like to see you're having
your period get back in the car.

6360
02:56:43,940 --> 02:56:44,151
Well,

6361
02:56:44,151 --> 02:56:44,721
not only that,

6362
02:56:44,721 --> 02:56:45,554
they don't,

6363
02:56:45,620 --> 02:56:47,210
it's not a morality thing.

6364
02:56:47,240 --> 02:56:48,800
It's not a good or bad thing.

6365
02:56:48,800 --> 02:56:50,840
It's like something's going to get eaten.

6366
02:56:50,990 --> 02:56:52,970
If you're out there and
you're the slow thing,

6367
02:56:53,150 --> 02:56:54,500
you're going to get eaten.

6368
02:56:54,620 --> 02:56:55,500
No offense,

6369
02:56:57,020 --> 02:56:57,980
no one's mad at you.

6370
02:56:58,310 --> 02:57:00,740
It's just Darwinism that we calf.

6371
02:57:00,770 --> 02:57:00,891
Yeah.

6372
02:57:00,891 --> 02:57:01,724
This is not a,

6373
02:57:01,950 --> 02:57:06,950
this is not a discerning organism that's
got moral value that it places on,

6374
02:57:08,120 --> 02:57:08,600
you know,

6375
02:57:08,600 --> 02:57:08,711
uh,

6376
02:57:08,711 --> 02:57:10,850
attacking thugs only or,

6377
02:57:10,851 --> 02:57:12,710
and not going after yoga instructors.

6378
02:57:13,810 --> 02:57:15,050
No slow shit that I can eat.

6379
02:57:15,080 --> 02:57:15,620
Yup.

6380
02:57:15,620 --> 02:57:16,280
There's,

6381
02:57:16,280 --> 02:57:17,300
they have no language.

6382
02:57:17,330 --> 02:57:17,770
They're just,

6383
02:57:17,770 --> 02:57:22,770
they're just an organism looking to
survive complex set of reinforcements and

6384
02:57:23,300 --> 02:57:28,160
reward systems that are set up for it
to be an incredibly efficient predator.

6385
02:57:29,860 --> 02:57:30,693
Fuck.

6386
02:57:30,810 --> 02:57:31,270
That's really,

6387
02:57:31,270 --> 02:57:36,270
see male lions the size of that
fucking hall dude is the biggest jaws.

6388
02:57:37,180 --> 02:57:38,270
Do our full,

6389
02:57:39,090 --> 02:57:39,510
yeah.

6390
02:57:39,510 --> 02:57:40,231
So the shark thing,

6391
02:57:40,231 --> 02:57:44,670
I found articles saying what you
were saying could not find a video.

6392
02:57:44,910 --> 02:57:48,510
And I do believe when we found that
before it was fake and I'm trying to find

6393
02:57:48,511 --> 02:57:49,410
Google even like fake,

6394
02:57:49,440 --> 02:57:50,330
oh the sharping up.

6395
02:57:50,360 --> 02:57:51,470
The sharks in the body.

6396
02:57:51,590 --> 02:57:53,330
Just Google Mri image.

6397
02:57:53,490 --> 02:57:55,590
I found something to that
kind of contradicts it though.

6398
02:57:55,591 --> 02:58:00,591
This is a dead shark that they performed
a c section on and there was 98 live

6399
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:03,410
pups and silent.

6400
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:03,841
Yeah,

6401
02:58:03,841 --> 02:58:04,321
that's true.

6402
02:58:04,321 --> 02:58:06,380
But that doesn't mean that
it happens every time.

6403
02:58:06,381 --> 02:58:06,631
I know.

6404
02:58:06,631 --> 02:58:06,841
I know.

6405
02:58:06,841 --> 02:58:07,141
I know.

6406
02:58:07,141 --> 02:58:10,920
What I had read was that it happens often.

6407
02:58:11,190 --> 02:58:13,290
This is the only thing I can
find of a shark pregnancy.

6408
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:16,700
That's 98 look at all
those sharks has nuts,

6409
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:18,600
and so he's just throwing
them in the water.

6410
02:58:18,750 --> 02:58:20,280
He's pulling them out and saving them.

6411
02:58:20,790 --> 02:58:21,660
That is nuts,

6412
02:58:21,661 --> 02:58:21,960
man.

6413
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:24,510
Look at all those little
monsters just swarming around.

6414
02:58:24,960 --> 02:58:25,440
Do you know that?

6415
02:58:25,440 --> 02:58:25,891
Fuck.

6416
02:58:25,891 --> 02:58:26,820
That's crazy.

6417
02:58:26,990 --> 02:58:28,530
Do you know that millions,

6418
02:58:28,830 --> 02:58:31,470
literally millions of sharks are
hunted and killed every year.

6419
02:58:31,890 --> 02:58:32,431
That's crazy.

6420
02:58:32,431 --> 02:58:34,520
Off the soup that she mostly,

6421
02:58:34,720 --> 02:58:35,553
yeah.

6422
02:58:35,910 --> 02:58:39,330
You know that's changed people's attitudes
on shark fishing because people used

6423
02:58:39,331 --> 02:58:41,760
to catch shark and used to get
it at restaurants all the time.

6424
02:58:42,150 --> 02:58:42,631
I don't remember.

6425
02:58:42,631 --> 02:58:44,760
You remember on the east
coast he'd get Maaco Shark.

6426
02:58:44,761 --> 02:58:45,990
You thought you were fucking player,

6427
02:58:46,280 --> 02:58:46,620
right?

6428
02:58:46,620 --> 02:58:46,921
Pimp.

6429
02:58:46,921 --> 02:58:49,050
I'm getting some Sharay little lemon.

6430
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:49,710
Some butter.

6431
02:58:49,710 --> 02:58:50,543
Yeah.

6432
02:58:50,610 --> 02:58:50,791
Right.

6433
02:58:50,791 --> 02:58:52,650
It was a common thing
they'd serve in restaurants.

6434
02:58:53,190 --> 02:58:57,960
How many sharks are fence
research indicates that about
a hundred million sharks

6435
02:58:57,961 --> 02:58:59,160
are killed each year.

6436
02:59:00,150 --> 02:59:00,690
Wow.

6437
02:59:00,690 --> 02:59:02,920
Roughly 11,000 sharks and hour.

6438
02:59:03,780 --> 02:59:04,613
That is incredible.

6439
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:06,180
This is by finning.

6440
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:07,680
That's incredible.

6441
02:59:09,450 --> 02:59:12,450
It's likely that many sharks are
caught without being reported.

6442
02:59:12,700 --> 02:59:12,850
Oh,

6443
02:59:12,850 --> 02:59:13,683
so the,

6444
02:59:14,220 --> 02:59:14,760
okay,

6445
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:17,760
so this is just what the reporting my God,

6446
02:59:20,040 --> 02:59:23,280
so this is like the first time I can
remember in history that people are

6447
02:59:23,281 --> 02:59:26,100
concerned with people fishing for sharks.

6448
02:59:26,280 --> 02:59:29,610
Because we talked about this was
the the governor in New York.

6449
02:59:29,640 --> 02:59:30,120
Who Was it?

6450
02:59:30,120 --> 02:59:34,800
Who was the cat that got in trouble for
legally catching a shark and cooking it

6451
02:59:34,801 --> 02:59:35,340
and eating it?

6452
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:38,070
I want to say it was the governor
and governor of New York,

6453
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:39,473
but Cuomo,

6454
02:59:40,040 --> 02:59:40,873
I don't know,

6455
02:59:40,970 --> 02:59:41,370
something.

6456
02:59:41,370 --> 02:59:42,360
Maybe the government son,

6457
02:59:42,780 --> 02:59:43,613
whatever the fuck it is,

6458
02:59:44,300 --> 02:59:44,680
Jamie,

6459
02:59:44,680 --> 02:59:45,420
you'll find it.

6460
02:59:45,420 --> 02:59:47,130
Andrew Coma tweeted a picture of herself.

6461
02:59:47,400 --> 02:59:47,730
Yeah.

6462
02:59:47,730 --> 02:59:49,290
After he caught a shark
or something like that.

6463
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:49,621
Yeah,

6464
02:59:49,621 --> 02:59:51,960
so this was all normal when we were kids.

6465
02:59:51,980 --> 02:59:52,120
Yeah.

6466
02:59:52,120 --> 02:59:52,921
This was normal as fuck.

6467
02:59:52,921 --> 02:59:55,650
Like that might as well
be a Marlin or a halibut.

6468
02:59:55,820 --> 02:59:56,940
It's just he got a shock like,

6469
02:59:56,941 --> 02:59:57,774
oh cool.

6470
02:59:57,870 --> 02:59:58,591
What's it taste like?

6471
02:59:58,591 --> 02:59:58,711
Oh,

6472
02:59:58,711 --> 02:59:59,190
it's good.

6473
02:59:59,190 --> 02:59:59,580
It's good.

6474
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:00,420
You Cook it with lemon,

6475
03:00:00,421 --> 03:00:01,200
like swordfish,

6476
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:02,970
very similar to something
I remember eating shark.

6477
03:00:03,020 --> 03:00:03,311
Yeah.

6478
03:00:03,311 --> 03:00:04,080
It's a little tough.

6479
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:06,570
I 100 Florida ft four
pound thresher shark,

6480
03:00:06,840 --> 03:00:07,890
so that's um,

6481
03:00:08,370 --> 03:00:08,581
you know,

6482
03:00:08,581 --> 03:00:10,740
Maaco particularly delicious.

6483
03:00:10,830 --> 03:00:12,510
It really does taste a lot like swordfish,

6484
03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:18,080
but in our lifetime it's now become taboo
because people have this rough idea of

6485
03:00:18,121 --> 03:00:22,110
what a shark is and the sharks are being
targeted and sharks are being murdered

6486
03:00:22,111 --> 03:00:24,840
and there's a small amount of sharks left.

6487
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:28,380
I don't know if that's accurate because
I think this is just in one part of the

6488
03:00:28,381 --> 03:00:29,010
world,

6489
03:00:29,010 --> 03:00:30,450
they're killing off all these sharks.

6490
03:00:30,900 --> 03:00:34,590
It's like if you say that there's
no more grizzly bears left.

6491
03:00:34,591 --> 03:00:35,970
Well if you're talking about California,

6492
03:00:35,971 --> 03:00:36,804
you're right,

6493
03:00:37,050 --> 03:00:39,630
but if you're talking
about British Columbia,

6494
03:00:39,750 --> 03:00:40,680
you're wrong.

6495
03:00:40,770 --> 03:00:45,270
There is a fuck load of 'em up there
and they're scary and they're big.

6496
03:00:45,930 --> 03:00:50,730
They're big and they're fast and they
need to eat every day and they berries,

6497
03:00:50,790 --> 03:00:51,930
if they find berries,

6498
03:00:51,931 --> 03:00:54,450
they'll eat some berries
or the asshole too.

6499
03:00:57,680 --> 03:00:58,650
I'd present.

6500
03:00:59,140 --> 03:00:59,501
Would you,

6501
03:00:59,501 --> 03:00:59,980
would you say

6502
03:00:59,980 --> 03:01:00,550
this is it,

6503
03:01:00,550 --> 03:01:01,181
this is happening,

6504
03:01:01,181 --> 03:01:01,420
is it,

6505
03:01:01,420 --> 03:01:02,121
let's do it right.

6506
03:01:02,121 --> 03:01:02,954
Is that,

6507
03:01:03,760 --> 03:01:05,890
I was in Alaska once and I was in,

6508
03:01:05,891 --> 03:01:06,724
uh,

6509
03:01:07,150 --> 03:01:07,990
I forget what town,

6510
03:01:07,991 --> 03:01:08,770
but there was a,

6511
03:01:08,770 --> 03:01:11,410
an island called Bair Island and I rented,

6512
03:01:11,411 --> 03:01:12,244
this guy had a,

6513
03:01:12,460 --> 03:01:14,230
had a 1948,

6514
03:01:14,231 --> 03:01:17,050
I think it was called us Stenson.

6515
03:01:17,051 --> 03:01:19,960
There's some kind of plane prop plane.

6516
03:01:20,260 --> 03:01:24,100
And I paid him a hundred bucks to take
me over bear island in this fucking

6517
03:01:24,101 --> 03:01:25,120
shitty little plane.

6518
03:01:25,510 --> 03:01:30,150
And we went out there and it took him
like 30 minutes to get the plane started

6519
03:01:30,190 --> 03:01:31,023
and that was like,

6520
03:01:31,090 --> 03:01:32,560
I should get the fuck outta here.

6521
03:01:32,980 --> 03:01:33,670
And so,

6522
03:01:33,670 --> 03:01:35,710
so we go up and a,

6523
03:01:35,711 --> 03:01:40,711
and the thing is getting
tossed around by wind and uh,

6524
03:01:41,140 --> 03:01:45,490
and we go out and we go over bear island
and he's showing me fucking bear all

6525
03:01:45,491 --> 03:01:45,641
over.

6526
03:01:45,641 --> 03:01:49,210
They would be like the
highest concentration of bear
and to anywhere in Alaska.

6527
03:01:50,830 --> 03:01:51,940
Jesus Christ,

6528
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:54,640
those bears are giant tumor.

6529
03:01:54,670 --> 03:01:55,060
Yeah.

6530
03:01:55,060 --> 03:01:55,580
Those,

6531
03:01:55,580 --> 03:01:56,650
the coastal bears,

6532
03:01:56,680 --> 03:01:58,000
they're all eating seafood.

6533
03:01:58,001 --> 03:02:01,480
They're eating like fish and
salmon and they just get enormous.

6534
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:01,960
Yeah.

6535
03:02:01,960 --> 03:02:02,920
There so big.

6536
03:02:03,550 --> 03:02:06,700
There's so much bigger than bears that
are inland like hundreds of pounds.

6537
03:02:06,730 --> 03:02:08,090
But what are the inland bears eat?

6538
03:02:08,500 --> 03:02:09,880
Wherever the fuck they get ahold of.

6539
03:02:10,140 --> 03:02:11,650
I'll eat salmon if they find salmon.

6540
03:02:11,651 --> 03:02:12,640
If there's the salmon river,

6541
03:02:12,650 --> 03:02:13,271
they'll eat fish.

6542
03:02:13,271 --> 03:02:14,680
They'll eat berries.

6543
03:02:15,500 --> 03:02:15,720
Oh,

6544
03:02:15,720 --> 03:02:18,010
he calves eat a lot of calves.

6545
03:02:18,550 --> 03:02:23,110
Did a lot of a calf's of
a elk and Moose and deer.

6546
03:02:23,111 --> 03:02:25,600
Fauns the small things
that can't get away.

6547
03:02:25,601 --> 03:02:26,560
They eat everything they can.

6548
03:02:27,100 --> 03:02:27,933
They're so big.

6549
03:02:28,780 --> 03:02:29,613
Yes.

6550
03:02:29,790 --> 03:02:30,550
It's just the two of you.

6551
03:02:30,550 --> 03:02:34,240
Imagine how much food you would have
to eat if you weighed 800 pounds.

6552
03:02:34,840 --> 03:02:35,920
How much food would you have to eat?

6553
03:02:35,980 --> 03:02:36,430
Everything.

6554
03:02:36,430 --> 03:02:36,611
Well,

6555
03:02:36,611 --> 03:02:37,480
four times.

6556
03:02:37,481 --> 03:02:38,231
As much as you eat.

6557
03:02:38,231 --> 03:02:38,600
Now

6558
03:02:38,600 --> 03:02:39,510
look at that fucking creep.

6559
03:02:39,511 --> 03:02:40,344
Yeah,

6560
03:02:40,790 --> 03:02:43,010
look at that fucking long nailed creep.

6561
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:43,851
That's a monster,

6562
03:02:43,851 --> 03:02:44,450
man.

6563
03:02:44,450 --> 03:02:45,030
Yeah.

6564
03:02:45,030 --> 03:02:46,340
Well we think it's Yogi.

6565
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:46,611
Oh,

6566
03:02:46,611 --> 03:02:46,991
it's you.

6567
03:02:46,991 --> 03:02:47,900
You look,

6568
03:02:47,901 --> 03:02:48,740
he's so cute.

6569
03:02:48,770 --> 03:02:50,180
He will eat your kid in front of you.

6570
03:02:50,290 --> 03:02:50,900
Yeah,

6571
03:02:50,900 --> 03:02:52,010
and that's what they have to do.

6572
03:02:52,100 --> 03:02:52,341
I mean,

6573
03:02:52,341 --> 03:02:52,641
they're,

6574
03:02:52,641 --> 03:02:53,570
they're predators.

6575
03:02:53,690 --> 03:02:54,460
They're out there.

6576
03:02:54,460 --> 03:02:54,710
They're,

6577
03:02:54,710 --> 03:02:55,760
they're omnivores.

6578
03:02:55,850 --> 03:02:56,091
I mean,

6579
03:02:56,091 --> 03:02:59,540
they do occasionally eat
whatever the fuck they want.

6580
03:02:59,541 --> 03:03:00,800
They'll eat roots and berries.

6581
03:03:00,801 --> 03:03:02,240
They'll eat everything else too,

6582
03:03:02,241 --> 03:03:04,520
but they'll definitely you and love it.

6583
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:05,210
Yeah.

6584
03:03:05,210 --> 03:03:06,050
Have a good old time.

6585
03:03:07,650 --> 03:03:07,831
Yeah.

6586
03:03:07,831 --> 03:03:09,630
That's salmon's a perfect food for them.

6587
03:03:09,631 --> 03:03:10,560
It's all fat.

6588
03:03:10,660 --> 03:03:10,880
Yeah.

6589
03:03:10,880 --> 03:03:11,910
You just store it up.

6590
03:03:12,030 --> 03:03:12,690
Yup.

6591
03:03:12,690 --> 03:03:15,930
It's almost like it's designed for
them too because the salmon die.

6592
03:03:16,290 --> 03:03:18,450
They literally die on the river.

6593
03:03:19,080 --> 03:03:20,220
Like you don't even have to catch him.

6594
03:03:20,650 --> 03:03:20,790
Oh,

6595
03:03:20,790 --> 03:03:21,623
I didn't know that.

6596
03:03:22,170 --> 03:03:24,060
Every year when they have to die,

6597
03:03:24,061 --> 03:03:25,820
they go back up to where the corn,

6598
03:03:25,860 --> 03:03:26,190
right?

6599
03:03:26,190 --> 03:03:26,970
Yes.

6600
03:03:26,970 --> 03:03:27,690
Yes.

6601
03:03:27,690 --> 03:03:32,690
They say that once the salmon make the
trek from the ocean to the fresh water,

6602
03:03:32,840 --> 03:03:35,280
they're already on a path to die.

6603
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:37,560
Their clock is already gone over.

6604
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:40,440
It's already flipped
over into no return land.

6605
03:03:40,441 --> 03:03:43,920
You couldn't take them out of there and
bring them to like some salmon pawn.

6606
03:03:43,921 --> 03:03:44,760
They live forever.

6607
03:03:45,140 --> 03:03:45,973
It doesn't work that way.

6608
03:03:46,240 --> 03:03:47,220
There they,

6609
03:03:47,520 --> 03:03:48,353
they breed,

6610
03:03:48,570 --> 03:03:49,560
they make the track,

6611
03:03:49,770 --> 03:03:53,430
they breed and when they get
to the spot where you know,

6612
03:03:53,431 --> 03:03:53,731
when there,

6613
03:03:53,731 --> 03:03:54,690
where the end of their life,

6614
03:03:54,691 --> 03:03:54,951
their,

6615
03:03:54,951 --> 03:03:56,640
their body starts changing color,

6616
03:03:56,880 --> 03:03:58,100
they getting mushy,

6617
03:03:58,540 --> 03:04:02,240
they live rotten and they just fucking
wind up like pooling up on the ground.

6618
03:04:02,420 --> 03:04:05,780
And then the bears move in and
they eat hundreds of rotten ones.

6619
03:04:06,020 --> 03:04:06,201
See,

6620
03:04:06,201 --> 03:04:06,830
this is,

6621
03:04:06,830 --> 03:04:10,640
this is while the salmon are
in the run and these bears are,

6622
03:04:10,670 --> 03:04:12,080
they're fighting over territory.

6623
03:04:12,110 --> 03:04:13,540
Look at the size of these motherfuckers.

6624
03:04:13,550 --> 03:04:14,390
Jesus Christ.

6625
03:04:14,391 --> 03:04:14,840
Dude,

6626
03:04:14,840 --> 03:04:16,400
they're fighting over who gets to salmon.

6627
03:04:16,460 --> 03:04:16,940
Yeah.

6628
03:04:16,940 --> 03:04:19,340
But these are salmon that are
still pretty fresh and healthy.

6629
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:20,030
They're,

6630
03:04:20,030 --> 03:04:20,780
they're swimming around,

6631
03:04:20,780 --> 03:04:21,613
they look good.

6632
03:04:21,830 --> 03:04:25,370
And so they catch them like that was a
perfectly healthy salmon and he catches

6633
03:04:25,371 --> 03:04:29,780
it right in the middle of it or
tried Huggies all slow mo and shit.

6634
03:04:29,870 --> 03:04:30,650
Here he goes.

6635
03:04:30,650 --> 03:04:32,120
They try and they catch some of them.

6636
03:04:33,840 --> 03:04:34,490
Oh,

6637
03:04:34,490 --> 03:04:35,323
come on bitch.

6638
03:04:36,020 --> 03:04:36,853
Hey,

6639
03:04:37,630 --> 03:04:38,463
get that.

6640
03:04:38,500 --> 03:04:42,640
Imagine just standing in freezing cold
water waiting to catch something with

6641
03:04:42,641 --> 03:04:43,474
your mouth.

6642
03:04:43,630 --> 03:04:45,160
It's delicious.

6643
03:04:45,310 --> 03:04:45,521
Right.

6644
03:04:45,521 --> 03:04:46,900
But they figured it out and it works.

6645
03:04:46,930 --> 03:04:47,260
Yep.

6646
03:04:47,260 --> 03:04:47,930
Look at the cubs.

6647
03:04:47,930 --> 03:04:49,480
Like come on mom to fuck.

6648
03:04:50,170 --> 03:04:52,390
So mom's probably going
to give him some of that.

6649
03:04:52,990 --> 03:04:53,321
Yeah,

6650
03:04:53,321 --> 03:04:57,070
see she breaks off pieces of it and so
they just keep doing that back and forth.

6651
03:04:57,100 --> 03:04:58,180
And they'll do that all day.

6652
03:04:58,390 --> 03:05:01,590
But then once the salmon
are done with their run,

6653
03:05:01,600 --> 03:05:02,710
then they just die.

6654
03:05:02,920 --> 03:05:07,510
And coincidentally when they're dying
is probably right when the bears are

6655
03:05:07,511 --> 03:05:09,930
trying to fatten up and
get ready for hibernation.

6656
03:05:09,950 --> 03:05:10,270
Yeah.

6657
03:05:10,270 --> 03:05:14,820
So it all like sort of happens together
and they're all in the right place at

6658
03:05:14,821 --> 03:05:15,654
the right time.

6659
03:05:16,300 --> 03:05:19,150
See if you can find bears
eating rotten salmon.

6660
03:05:19,480 --> 03:05:23,380
Cause like sometimes they'll pull up
and these these rivers and these like

6661
03:05:23,410 --> 03:05:28,410
little ponds and shit and you just see
all these bears is chew on these rotting

6662
03:05:28,511 --> 03:05:29,210
carcasses.

6663
03:05:29,210 --> 03:05:30,043
Yeah.

6664
03:05:30,140 --> 03:05:30,351
Yeah.

6665
03:05:30,351 --> 03:05:33,860
Those salmon are endangered
now we eat so much more fish.

6666
03:05:33,880 --> 03:05:34,000
Yeah.

6667
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:34,940
I remember when I was a kid,

6668
03:05:34,941 --> 03:05:37,220
I'd have fish once every three weeks.

6669
03:05:37,610 --> 03:05:38,040
Now you,

6670
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:39,290
I mean maybe it's because we're in la,

6671
03:05:39,291 --> 03:05:41,330
but I have fished a few times a week.

6672
03:05:41,360 --> 03:05:43,010
Do you have some fucking Sushi?

6673
03:05:43,011 --> 03:05:46,460
One day wife will cook
some salmon on another day.

6674
03:05:46,990 --> 03:05:48,710
Go get one of those pokie bowls.

6675
03:05:49,690 --> 03:05:51,070
We're constantly eating salmon.

6676
03:05:51,370 --> 03:05:52,360
It's a lot of food.

6677
03:05:52,590 --> 03:05:55,420
Think about all those little
organisms that have to fuck,

6678
03:05:55,600 --> 03:05:56,291
well not really.

6679
03:05:56,291 --> 03:05:57,370
Shoot loads on eggs.

6680
03:05:57,400 --> 03:05:57,700
Yeah.

6681
03:05:57,700 --> 03:06:02,050
Make new organisms and then all the
people with nets scooping them up.

6682
03:06:02,140 --> 03:06:06,310
Do you see us a tuna got sold in
Japan for the highest amount ever.

6683
03:06:06,670 --> 03:06:08,590
$3 million for tuna?

6684
03:06:08,980 --> 03:06:09,850
Shit.

6685
03:06:10,950 --> 03:06:11,800
I had no idea.

6686
03:06:11,870 --> 03:06:12,940
And did you have any idea?

6687
03:06:12,980 --> 03:06:14,170
But a tuner could be 3 million.

6688
03:06:14,171 --> 03:06:14,480
Yeah,

6689
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:19,250
I know that they wait on the dock and
the in Japan and whoever is like certain

6690
03:06:19,251 --> 03:06:22,880
chefs have more cache and they're
able to come in first and pick the,

6691
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:23,870
the tuna.

6692
03:06:23,870 --> 03:06:24,703
But then they,

6693
03:06:24,770 --> 03:06:26,330
but then they auctioned them off and yeah,

6694
03:06:26,331 --> 03:06:27,710
they go for crazy money.

6695
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:28,900
That's so crazy.

6696
03:06:29,590 --> 03:06:31,510
That's a giant fucking fish though.

6697
03:06:31,511 --> 03:06:33,040
Isn't it like 600 pounds or something?

6698
03:06:33,041 --> 03:06:36,160
How much it at least 278 kilograms.

6699
03:06:36,190 --> 03:06:39,440
What's that in English 2.2 close to six.

6700
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:40,300
Yeah.

6701
03:06:40,300 --> 03:06:41,133
Look at that thing.

6702
03:06:41,140 --> 03:06:41,973
God Damn,

6703
03:06:42,220 --> 03:06:42,761
that's a hard,

6704
03:06:42,761 --> 03:06:43,600
that is to bring in.

6705
03:06:44,290 --> 03:06:45,123
Yeah.

6706
03:06:45,490 --> 03:06:46,870
I caught a yell tail and Hawaii.

6707
03:06:46,871 --> 03:06:49,450
That was like 11 pounds a battle.

6708
03:06:49,730 --> 03:06:50,740
What a battle.

6709
03:06:51,070 --> 03:06:51,550
Yeah.

6710
03:06:51,550 --> 03:06:52,900
613 pounds.

6711
03:06:52,930 --> 03:06:53,763
Wow.

6712
03:06:54,760 --> 03:06:54,851
Yeah,

6713
03:06:54,851 --> 03:06:56,010
we caught up quite a few of them.

6714
03:06:56,270 --> 03:07:00,090
You know what's interesting to catching
ones they're calling Hamachi cause they

6715
03:07:00,091 --> 03:07:04,710
were actually from a Hamachi farm that
was on the big island that broke during

6716
03:07:04,711 --> 03:07:05,520
the storm.

6717
03:07:05,520 --> 03:07:06,630
And when they had that storm,

6718
03:07:06,631 --> 03:07:07,650
there are a couple of years back.

6719
03:07:07,740 --> 03:07:09,030
Giant fucking hurricane.

6720
03:07:09,031 --> 03:07:09,864
They did a why?

6721
03:07:10,050 --> 03:07:11,780
Well it destroyed this uh,

6722
03:07:11,810 --> 03:07:15,600
this containment area that they had
where they were farm raising Hamachi for

6723
03:07:15,601 --> 03:07:16,620
like Sushi and shit.

6724
03:07:16,950 --> 03:07:20,450
So now this type of yellow
tails everywhere in the,

6725
03:07:20,451 --> 03:07:21,120
in the ocean.

6726
03:07:21,120 --> 03:07:21,750
Oh Wow.

6727
03:07:21,750 --> 03:07:22,200
Yeah.

6728
03:07:22,200 --> 03:07:23,790
We caught a caught quite a few of them.

6729
03:07:23,820 --> 03:07:24,450
Did you eat them?

6730
03:07:24,450 --> 03:07:24,631
Yeah,

6731
03:07:24,631 --> 03:07:25,464
they're great.

6732
03:07:25,590 --> 03:07:26,670
So you caught it there,

6733
03:07:26,671 --> 03:07:28,850
you brought it back to the hotel
and then they fried it down.

6734
03:07:29,010 --> 03:07:29,581
Pick it for you.

6735
03:07:29,581 --> 03:07:30,330
Yeah.

6736
03:07:30,330 --> 03:07:30,870
Yeah.

6737
03:07:30,870 --> 03:07:31,710
Oh it's amazing.

6738
03:07:31,830 --> 03:07:32,371
So good.

6739
03:07:32,371 --> 03:07:33,450
They made Sushi for us.

6740
03:07:33,451 --> 03:07:34,284
They made 'em.

6741
03:07:34,440 --> 03:07:35,910
They made a Sashimi,

6742
03:07:35,911 --> 03:07:36,850
they made some Che,

6743
03:07:36,900 --> 03:07:38,160
they baked it,

6744
03:07:38,610 --> 03:07:40,080
they cooked it a couple of different ways.

6745
03:07:40,320 --> 03:07:41,153
But you know,

6746
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:42,870
they're so powerful.

6747
03:07:42,970 --> 03:07:46,590
A 10 pound one nine pound
one or s is so powerful.

6748
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:48,240
You can't believe how strong they are.

6749
03:07:48,630 --> 03:07:48,991
Like you're,

6750
03:07:48,991 --> 03:07:50,070
you're wrestling with them.

6751
03:07:50,071 --> 03:07:51,270
We can try and get him into the bullying.

6752
03:07:53,190 --> 03:07:54,690
So imagine that thing.

6753
03:07:54,691 --> 03:07:58,500
600 pounds and Holy Shit.

6754
03:07:58,501 --> 03:07:59,990
That's about the whole family fishing.

6755
03:07:59,991 --> 03:08:00,190
No,

6756
03:08:00,190 --> 03:08:01,023
just my youngest,

6757
03:08:01,050 --> 03:08:02,160
youngest daughter loves it.

6758
03:08:02,330 --> 03:08:03,000
She loves it.

6759
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:03,451
Loves it.

6760
03:08:03,451 --> 03:08:04,284
She loves fishing.

6761
03:08:04,630 --> 03:08:05,400
Yeah.

6762
03:08:05,400 --> 03:08:06,910
We put a video up of,

6763
03:08:06,930 --> 03:08:07,500
um,

6764
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:09,120
the dolphins that were with us.

6765
03:08:09,210 --> 03:08:09,870
I saw that.

6766
03:08:09,870 --> 03:08:10,310
It's crazy.

6767
03:08:10,310 --> 03:08:11,070
It was amazing.

6768
03:08:11,070 --> 03:08:13,290
They just never seen that many
dolphins swim with a boat.

6769
03:08:14,650 --> 03:08:15,480
It was incredible.

6770
03:08:15,480 --> 03:08:16,313
They just all,

6771
03:08:16,350 --> 03:08:17,700
we just hit the right spot.

6772
03:08:17,730 --> 03:08:18,030
Yeah.

6773
03:08:18,030 --> 03:08:20,340
And then they all decided
to swim with the boat.

6774
03:08:20,341 --> 03:08:21,190
They just get in the,

6775
03:08:21,250 --> 03:08:24,570
in front of the boat as the boat's pushing
the water and they started a surf it,

6776
03:08:25,140 --> 03:08:26,040
that's amazing.

6777
03:08:26,070 --> 03:08:26,821
So crazy.

6778
03:08:26,821 --> 03:08:28,050
You worry about you're going to hit them.

6779
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:30,450
You worry that they're going to
the right people running the boat.

6780
03:08:30,451 --> 03:08:31,051
They don't worry about it.

6781
03:08:31,051 --> 03:08:32,670
All the dolphins know
exactly what they're doing.

6782
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:34,200
They're smart as shit.

6783
03:08:34,230 --> 03:08:34,860
Yeah.

6784
03:08:34,860 --> 03:08:35,850
It's weird to watch,

6785
03:08:35,851 --> 03:08:36,330
man.

6786
03:08:36,330 --> 03:08:38,730
It's weird to watch them all coordinate
together and then they were done.

6787
03:08:38,731 --> 03:08:39,860
They were done like by,

6788
03:08:40,620 --> 03:08:41,340
they take off.

6789
03:08:41,340 --> 03:08:42,060
Wow.

6790
03:08:42,060 --> 03:08:42,241
Yeah.

6791
03:08:42,241 --> 03:08:43,770
My daughter's surfs and they come out.

6792
03:08:43,800 --> 03:08:44,970
They play around a little bit.

6793
03:08:45,270 --> 03:08:47,220
Sometimes they ride the
waves when she surfing.

6794
03:08:47,670 --> 03:08:49,530
That's one of the dark sides of fishing,

6795
03:08:49,531 --> 03:08:50,364
right?

6796
03:08:50,490 --> 03:08:52,160
Commercial fishing is a,

6797
03:08:52,230 --> 03:08:56,190
what happens in Japan when they take
those dolphins and they look at them as

6798
03:08:56,310 --> 03:08:57,143
competition,

6799
03:08:57,660 --> 03:08:58,770
they're going to kill their tuna.

6800
03:08:58,771 --> 03:08:59,490
So they,

6801
03:08:59,490 --> 03:09:00,030
you know,

6802
03:09:00,030 --> 03:09:01,170
they've been doing that forever.

6803
03:09:01,171 --> 03:09:03,840
The large scale slaughter of them,

6804
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:05,040
it's scary shit.

6805
03:09:05,460 --> 03:09:06,293
They just shoot him.

6806
03:09:06,480 --> 03:09:07,290
They caught them.

6807
03:09:07,290 --> 03:09:07,710
They bring him.

6808
03:09:07,710 --> 03:09:08,760
You've ever seen the documentary,

6809
03:09:08,761 --> 03:09:09,594
the cove?

6810
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:10,501
Oh No,

6811
03:09:10,501 --> 03:09:11,460
I heard about that.

6812
03:09:11,820 --> 03:09:13,050
All full.

6813
03:09:13,120 --> 03:09:15,250
It's all full there.

6814
03:09:15,300 --> 03:09:15,560
It's,

6815
03:09:15,560 --> 03:09:19,170
it's like they're
slaughtering water people.

6816
03:09:20,100 --> 03:09:20,790
That's what it's like.

6817
03:09:20,790 --> 03:09:21,623
Yeah.

6818
03:09:21,670 --> 03:09:23,400
This is what a dolphin is,

6819
03:09:23,460 --> 03:09:24,990
is some strange,

6820
03:09:24,991 --> 03:09:27,900
super intelligent creature that
we don't totally understand.

6821
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:29,490
And they can talk,

6822
03:09:29,730 --> 03:09:31,740
they can talk to each other and
we don't know what they're saying,

6823
03:09:31,890 --> 03:09:32,910
but they know what they're saying.

6824
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:35,790
And we could train them.

6825
03:09:35,820 --> 03:09:36,690
You could ride them,

6826
03:09:36,720 --> 03:09:37,500
you can do it,

6827
03:09:37,500 --> 03:09:38,730
flips for fish,

6828
03:09:38,760 --> 03:09:39,510
all this kind of stuff.

6829
03:09:39,510 --> 03:09:40,380
That's all true.

6830
03:09:40,410 --> 03:09:41,243
That's all true.

6831
03:09:41,370 --> 03:09:43,710
But what's also true is
they have a giant brain,

6832
03:09:43,940 --> 03:09:45,450
and if they have a huge brain,

6833
03:09:45,570 --> 03:09:48,030
Devin cerebral cortex is
40% larger than a person.

6834
03:09:48,600 --> 03:09:49,330
No Shit.

6835
03:09:49,330 --> 03:09:49,800
Yeah.

6836
03:09:49,800 --> 03:09:50,550
Wow.

6837
03:09:50,550 --> 03:09:50,970
They just,

6838
03:09:50,970 --> 03:09:52,950
it's designed for you,

6839
03:09:53,080 --> 03:09:53,291
the,

6840
03:09:53,291 --> 03:09:54,250
the movement of his body.

6841
03:09:54,251 --> 03:09:54,850
Cause it's a lot,

6842
03:09:54,850 --> 03:09:55,420
lot,

6843
03:09:55,420 --> 03:09:56,560
lot larger body,

6844
03:09:57,250 --> 03:10:02,250
but they think it's also got some sort
of probably not totally understood are

6845
03:10:03,401 --> 03:10:04,720
measured cognitive ability.

6846
03:10:05,260 --> 03:10:06,940
They don't know like how
smart they really are.

6847
03:10:06,970 --> 03:10:07,803
It's been,

6848
03:10:07,960 --> 03:10:08,261
you know,

6849
03:10:08,261 --> 03:10:09,400
when we're talking about Timothy Leary,

6850
03:10:09,401 --> 03:10:11,230
he used to pal around with John Lilly.

6851
03:10:11,380 --> 03:10:15,460
John Lilly's the guy who invented
the isolation tank and he's also a,

6852
03:10:15,461 --> 03:10:17,740
he was a pioneer and
interspecies communication.

6853
03:10:17,790 --> 03:10:20,560
You'd give dolphins acid and he would uh,

6854
03:10:21,460 --> 03:10:25,580
he was set the float tank up next to the
dolphin tank and take acid and getting

6855
03:10:25,610 --> 03:10:26,443
there with them.

6856
03:10:26,830 --> 03:10:27,131
Yeah,

6857
03:10:27,131 --> 03:10:27,730
he was,

6858
03:10:27,730 --> 03:10:27,911
yeah.

6859
03:10:27,911 --> 03:10:30,940
He was trying to figure out a
way to get dolphins to speak.

6860
03:10:31,210 --> 03:10:32,770
He would get them to like make a noise.

6861
03:10:32,771 --> 03:10:34,750
It sounds like how long,

6862
03:10:35,170 --> 03:10:35,441
you know,

6863
03:10:35,441 --> 03:10:35,951
but they could,

6864
03:10:35,951 --> 03:10:37,810
they don't have the vocal cords.

6865
03:10:37,870 --> 03:10:40,300
They can't make the sounds that we expect,

6866
03:10:40,900 --> 03:10:42,670
but there sounds we don't understand.

6867
03:10:42,690 --> 03:10:43,060
Right.

6868
03:10:43,060 --> 03:10:44,770
Which is weird cause they
know what you're saying.

6869
03:10:44,800 --> 03:10:45,161
If you say,

6870
03:10:45,161 --> 03:10:45,551
okay,

6871
03:10:45,551 --> 03:10:46,390
we're going to jump now.

6872
03:10:46,391 --> 03:10:46,930
We've got a job,

6873
03:10:46,930 --> 03:10:47,860
we're going to give you a fish.

6874
03:10:48,070 --> 03:10:48,640
They know it.

6875
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:49,473
They know what you're saying.

6876
03:10:49,660 --> 03:10:50,620
We have no idea what they're saying.

6877
03:10:50,700 --> 03:10:51,533
Yeah.

6878
03:10:52,890 --> 03:10:53,161
Yeah.

6879
03:10:53,161 --> 03:10:53,761
It's weird when you,

6880
03:10:53,761 --> 03:10:53,961
what?

6881
03:10:53,961 --> 03:10:56,820
What is the cutoff for
killing an intelligent animal?

6882
03:10:56,880 --> 03:10:57,031
Right.

6883
03:10:57,031 --> 03:10:57,271
You know,

6884
03:10:57,271 --> 03:10:58,710
like you can't kill dogs.

6885
03:10:58,711 --> 03:10:59,544
Cats.

6886
03:11:00,690 --> 03:11:02,430
Dogs aren't nearly as smart as dolphins,

6887
03:11:02,460 --> 03:11:03,120
right?

6888
03:11:03,120 --> 03:11:03,953
Yeah.

6889
03:11:03,960 --> 03:11:05,820
But you can kill dogs in some spots.

6890
03:11:05,821 --> 03:11:06,654
It's cultural.

6891
03:11:06,750 --> 03:11:07,290
Yeah.

6892
03:11:07,290 --> 03:11:09,180
Because pigs are probably
the smartest dogs.

6893
03:11:09,660 --> 03:11:09,901
Oh yeah.

6894
03:11:09,901 --> 03:11:10,411
We all exist.

6895
03:11:10,411 --> 03:11:11,244
Really smart.

6896
03:11:11,820 --> 03:11:12,001
I mean,

6897
03:11:12,001 --> 03:11:12,834
that's a,

6898
03:11:13,590 --> 03:11:14,423
that's a tricky one.

6899
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:15,810
All those,

6900
03:11:15,810 --> 03:11:16,643
you know,

6901
03:11:17,940 --> 03:11:20,400
that is one of our criteria.

6902
03:11:20,490 --> 03:11:22,680
Like even a lot of vegetarians,

6903
03:11:22,920 --> 03:11:24,480
we'll still step on roaches.

6904
03:11:25,020 --> 03:11:25,710
Yeah.

6905
03:11:25,710 --> 03:11:26,280
You know,

6906
03:11:26,280 --> 03:11:30,030
our criteria is how smart is the thing.

6907
03:11:30,510 --> 03:11:31,830
How close is it to us?

6908
03:11:31,920 --> 03:11:33,120
The further it's away from us,

6909
03:11:33,121 --> 03:11:34,080
the easy we could just like,

6910
03:11:34,410 --> 03:11:35,850
nobody gives a fuck about oysters.

6911
03:11:36,750 --> 03:11:37,100
Yeah.

6912
03:11:37,100 --> 03:11:37,620
No.

6913
03:11:37,620 --> 03:11:38,970
Saben an oyster gets got.

6914
03:11:39,460 --> 03:11:40,290
I don't care.

6915
03:11:40,290 --> 03:11:41,041
I don't care at all.

6916
03:11:41,041 --> 03:11:41,910
I don't feel a thing.

6917
03:11:42,230 --> 03:11:45,000
Someone shucks annoy oyster and opens
up and scooped it out and swallow.

6918
03:11:45,001 --> 03:11:45,271
And I'm like,

6919
03:11:45,271 --> 03:11:45,631
how's it?

6920
03:11:45,631 --> 03:11:46,464
Good.

6921
03:11:46,680 --> 03:11:47,010
Yeah.

6922
03:11:47,010 --> 03:11:47,460
I'm not like,

6923
03:11:47,460 --> 03:11:47,940
Aww,

6924
03:11:47,940 --> 03:11:48,773
poor little piggy.

6925
03:11:49,170 --> 03:11:51,420
But the poor little piggy that's real.

6926
03:11:51,650 --> 03:11:52,060
That thing.

6927
03:11:52,060 --> 03:11:52,710
Smart.

6928
03:11:52,710 --> 03:11:53,191
Oh,

6929
03:11:53,191 --> 03:11:53,821
let's say so.

6930
03:11:53,821 --> 03:11:54,301
Scared.

6931
03:11:54,301 --> 03:11:55,110
So terrified.

6932
03:11:55,110 --> 03:11:55,943
Yeah.

6933
03:11:56,330 --> 03:11:56,700
But it,

6934
03:11:56,700 --> 03:11:57,600
all those things are dumb.

6935
03:11:57,660 --> 03:11:59,520
What about lobsters
getting thrown in the pot?

6936
03:11:59,521 --> 03:12:00,354
Can you do that?

6937
03:12:00,360 --> 03:12:01,230
I can't do that.

6938
03:12:01,650 --> 03:12:02,041
Oh yeah,

6939
03:12:02,041 --> 03:12:02,341
I could do.

6940
03:12:02,341 --> 03:12:07,341
It freaks me out that they're like moving
around and alive and then you throw

6941
03:12:07,441 --> 03:12:09,990
them in and don't they
scream they're bugs.

6942
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:10,231
Yeah.

6943
03:12:10,231 --> 03:12:10,680
They scream.

6944
03:12:10,680 --> 03:12:13,600
They sing first and
then this little screen,

6945
03:12:13,680 --> 03:12:14,513
they don't know.

6946
03:12:16,170 --> 03:12:17,780
It's not like the frog in Carnegie Hall.

6947
03:12:17,910 --> 03:12:18,790
They could make noise.

6948
03:12:18,950 --> 03:12:20,130
I'll leave the big noise.

6949
03:12:20,490 --> 03:12:21,330
Their lobsters.

6950
03:12:21,660 --> 03:12:22,493
Ah,

6951
03:12:22,710 --> 03:12:22,891
yeah.

6952
03:12:22,891 --> 03:12:23,880
But they tasted fuck.

6953
03:12:24,480 --> 03:12:25,650
I'll eat tons of them.

6954
03:12:25,700 --> 03:12:26,060
Ooh.

6955
03:12:26,060 --> 03:12:27,960
When I used to work in Boston at the,

6956
03:12:27,961 --> 03:12:28,794
uh,

6957
03:12:29,100 --> 03:12:30,090
the copy Marriott,

6958
03:12:30,091 --> 03:12:32,160
that was my day job
for a while in college.

6959
03:12:32,220 --> 03:12:33,810
And then when I first
started doing standup,

6960
03:12:34,650 --> 03:12:38,370
and we used to go down and it was
the biggest banquet hall in Boston.

6961
03:12:38,371 --> 03:12:39,690
So we used to get all these conventions,

6962
03:12:39,691 --> 03:12:43,800
all these fucking hayseed farmers would
come from the Midwest and they'd stay in

6963
03:12:43,801 --> 03:12:45,960
the hotel and they could
order any kind of dinner.

6964
03:12:45,960 --> 03:12:47,160
They want it for their banquet.

6965
03:12:47,400 --> 03:12:49,080
But they always wanted the pilgrim,

6966
03:12:49,310 --> 03:12:54,310
the pilgrim banquet and used to have to
fucking dress up as pilgrims who would

6967
03:12:54,561 --> 03:12:55,550
serve lobster.

6968
03:12:55,551 --> 03:12:56,720
It didn't even make any sense.

6969
03:12:57,240 --> 03:12:57,580
Thanks.

6970
03:12:57,580 --> 03:12:58,220
So,

6971
03:12:58,220 --> 03:12:59,180
so they would make,

6972
03:12:59,181 --> 03:13:04,181
and the thing about banquet cooking is
you cook 10% more than the amount of

6973
03:13:04,371 --> 03:13:06,260
people you're feeding just in case,

6974
03:13:06,620 --> 03:13:08,300
which meant there was like,

6975
03:13:08,360 --> 03:13:08,721
you know,

6976
03:13:08,721 --> 03:13:13,370
30 30 college kids all
waiting tables and uh,

6977
03:13:13,390 --> 03:13:15,260
and so after we fed them,

6978
03:13:15,261 --> 03:13:19,370
they would usually have like
a presentation or whatever
comedian or a speaker.

6979
03:13:19,520 --> 03:13:23,060
So we would leave the room for like an
hour and a half and we would just fucking

6980
03:13:23,061 --> 03:13:28,061
go to town on like a hundred lobsters
could eat like three lobsters if you

6981
03:13:28,730 --> 03:13:29,300
wanted.

6982
03:13:29,300 --> 03:13:30,051
And then our friends,

6983
03:13:30,051 --> 03:13:31,080
we're all working the bars.

6984
03:13:31,100 --> 03:13:33,950
They were all the bartenders
so we'd be doing shots,

6985
03:13:34,670 --> 03:13:38,300
drinking beer and so is the
upside was you live like a king.

6986
03:13:38,301 --> 03:13:41,240
The downside was you were
dressed like a fucking asshole.

6987
03:13:45,740 --> 03:13:46,940
I remember clam bakes.

6988
03:13:46,941 --> 03:13:48,050
People would do them on the ball.

6989
03:13:48,051 --> 03:13:48,501
Yeah,

6990
03:13:48,501 --> 03:13:49,700
those were good.

6991
03:13:49,701 --> 03:13:50,300
Yeah.

6992
03:13:50,300 --> 03:13:54,210
I like a clam bake where you would burry
it and put seaweed over the top and yet

6993
03:13:54,710 --> 03:13:57,230
wet seaweed and it would
just steam everything.

6994
03:13:57,260 --> 03:13:58,250
I've never done it.

6995
03:13:58,580 --> 03:14:00,620
I've only eaten it at a restaurant.

6996
03:14:00,621 --> 03:14:02,690
When you order a clam bake
and they give you some,

6997
03:14:02,691 --> 03:14:03,920
I've never done the beach thing.

6998
03:14:03,950 --> 03:14:05,780
I did it with Kevin Flynn and Nantucket.

6999
03:14:05,781 --> 03:14:06,201
God Damn,

7000
03:14:06,201 --> 03:14:06,980
it looks attractive.

7001
03:14:06,980 --> 03:14:07,460
Yeah,

7002
03:14:07,460 --> 03:14:08,030
that's very true.

7003
03:14:08,030 --> 03:14:08,720
Great.

7004
03:14:08,720 --> 03:14:09,411
Very earthy.

7005
03:14:09,411 --> 03:14:10,880
Right at the fucking corn in there.

7006
03:14:10,881 --> 03:14:11,331
Everything.

7007
03:14:11,331 --> 03:14:14,540
Potatoes to something about
a bonfire on the beach,

7008
03:14:14,840 --> 03:14:15,470
right?

7009
03:14:15,470 --> 03:14:18,470
It's like extra special like here it is.

7010
03:14:18,620 --> 03:14:19,550
That's it right there.

7011
03:14:19,850 --> 03:14:21,260
How to make a steam pit.

7012
03:14:22,510 --> 03:14:24,740
Make a nice fuck and steam pit.

7013
03:14:24,741 --> 03:14:25,131
Look at that.

7014
03:14:25,131 --> 03:14:26,270
We've got a lobsters.

7015
03:14:26,300 --> 03:14:28,310
We got con con.

7016
03:14:28,340 --> 03:14:29,840
We got clams.

7017
03:14:30,320 --> 03:14:30,651
Yeah.

7018
03:14:30,651 --> 03:14:33,530
It would be lobsters and corn and clams.

7019
03:14:33,890 --> 03:14:34,723
Potatoes,

7020
03:14:34,850 --> 03:14:39,850
potatoes and it would all be buried in
like a burlap sack under the ground.

7021
03:14:40,010 --> 03:14:40,843
Yup.

7022
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:42,050
Muscles too.

7023
03:14:42,230 --> 03:14:43,051
God Damn it.

7024
03:14:43,051 --> 03:14:43,940
That locks kid.

7025
03:14:44,540 --> 03:14:45,920
Ah.

7026
03:14:45,980 --> 03:14:47,300
People say they don't like lobster.

7027
03:14:47,301 --> 03:14:48,800
I just do not understand that.

7028
03:14:48,950 --> 03:14:49,241
You don't what?

7029
03:14:49,241 --> 03:14:50,074
It's like lobster.

7030
03:14:50,120 --> 03:14:52,850
Eddie Bravo won't eat fish hate fish.

7031
03:14:52,980 --> 03:14:53,510
Big Fan.

7032
03:14:53,510 --> 03:14:54,740
You son of a bitch.

7033
03:14:55,480 --> 03:14:57,170
Some lobster and crab.

7034
03:14:57,171 --> 03:14:58,490
Nice Alaskan crab.

7035
03:14:59,150 --> 03:15:00,030
Look at that with the little,

7036
03:15:00,031 --> 03:15:00,950
with the green stuff.

7037
03:15:00,980 --> 03:15:02,480
What does that minced onions or something,

7038
03:15:02,481 --> 03:15:03,020
what does that look like?

7039
03:15:03,020 --> 03:15:04,040
Crow Crow.

7040
03:15:04,041 --> 03:15:04,910
I think what's,

7041
03:15:04,911 --> 03:15:05,744
no,

7042
03:15:06,560 --> 03:15:07,393
no,

7043
03:15:07,490 --> 03:15:08,001
that's not,

7044
03:15:08,001 --> 03:15:08,451
that is,

7045
03:15:08,451 --> 03:15:09,201
that's like a spice,

7046
03:15:09,201 --> 03:15:10,034
right?

7047
03:15:11,150 --> 03:15:12,200
Cause it's on the corn to,

7048
03:15:12,210 --> 03:15:13,043
Oh yeah.

7049
03:15:13,070 --> 03:15:14,180
I think that's like a,

7050
03:15:14,480 --> 03:15:15,020
what is that?

7051
03:15:15,020 --> 03:15:16,280
Like a salary or something like that.

7052
03:15:16,281 --> 03:15:16,850
Parsley.

7053
03:15:16,850 --> 03:15:18,080
Chopped Parsley or some shit.

7054
03:15:18,640 --> 03:15:19,110
Just making it.

7055
03:15:19,110 --> 03:15:19,340
Oh,

7056
03:15:19,340 --> 03:15:20,540
and then the exit of the rail.

7057
03:15:20,541 --> 03:15:21,470
That's at the time.

7058
03:15:21,800 --> 03:15:22,820
That shit's nasty.

7059
03:15:22,940 --> 03:15:23,690
I like it.

7060
03:15:23,690 --> 03:15:25,220
You eat the rallied everything.

7061
03:15:25,520 --> 03:15:26,353
No Shit.

7062
03:15:26,520 --> 03:15:30,830
Chew the inner Cartlidge up
and I suck the meat out of it.

7063
03:15:31,970 --> 03:15:33,350
I feel like if that thing is going to die,

7064
03:15:33,351 --> 03:15:34,820
I'm going to eat as much of it as I can.

7065
03:15:34,880 --> 03:15:36,440
I bite into the,

7066
03:15:36,830 --> 03:15:40,610
you know how you take the back and is
that meat underneath with all the crazy

7067
03:15:40,611 --> 03:15:41,630
gills and all that shit.

7068
03:15:41,631 --> 03:15:43,070
I just chew into that stuff.

7069
03:15:43,280 --> 03:15:45,170
Really it chew it up,

7070
03:15:45,300 --> 03:15:45,771
chew it up.

7071
03:15:45,771 --> 03:15:46,820
Good junk.

7072
03:15:46,821 --> 03:15:48,170
All that shit and butter.

7073
03:15:48,990 --> 03:15:49,890
That's what I'm talking about,

7074
03:15:50,970 --> 03:15:51,150
Dan.

7075
03:15:51,150 --> 03:15:52,980
I did throw move on one
of those waitresses.

7076
03:15:52,981 --> 03:15:54,000
I'm dressed as a pilgrim.

7077
03:15:54,380 --> 03:15:58,050
I'm drunk and on some
girl from Boston College.

7078
03:15:58,260 --> 03:16:00,840
Did you know the lobsters were
like poor people food in New York?

7079
03:16:01,020 --> 03:16:03,060
They would just go out to the East
River and pull them out of the water.

7080
03:16:03,061 --> 03:16:03,420
Yeah.

7081
03:16:03,420 --> 03:16:05,370
Serve him as bar food for people.

7082
03:16:05,371 --> 03:16:05,940
Food.

7083
03:16:05,940 --> 03:16:07,710
Do you know an Ireland during the famine?

7084
03:16:07,740 --> 03:16:10,470
They were pulling fucking lobster
out of the ocean would need it.

7085
03:16:10,650 --> 03:16:12,090
They considered it like rats.

7086
03:16:12,180 --> 03:16:12,900
Oh my God.

7087
03:16:12,900 --> 03:16:13,411
They sit.

7088
03:16:13,411 --> 03:16:14,161
They fucking need.

7089
03:16:14,161 --> 03:16:16,200
The British would just ship it off.

7090
03:16:16,270 --> 03:16:17,101
That's so crazy.

7091
03:16:17,101 --> 03:16:17,291
Yeah.

7092
03:16:17,291 --> 03:16:18,240
I did not figure it out.

7093
03:16:19,320 --> 03:16:20,153
They're drunk.

7094
03:16:20,250 --> 03:16:21,660
One person just boiled it up,

7095
03:16:21,690 --> 03:16:22,261
made some butter.

7096
03:16:22,261 --> 03:16:23,700
Just shut the fuck up and try this.

7097
03:16:23,750 --> 03:16:24,050
Right.

7098
03:16:24,050 --> 03:16:24,883
People are like,

7099
03:16:25,260 --> 03:16:26,093
what

7100
03:16:26,400 --> 03:16:26,990
I've been avoiding.

7101
03:16:26,990 --> 03:16:27,823
Yes.

7102
03:16:27,870 --> 03:16:28,201
What does,

7103
03:16:28,201 --> 03:16:28,950
I've been thinking,

7104
03:16:28,950 --> 03:16:30,210
what the fuck have they been doing?

7105
03:16:30,211 --> 03:16:30,511
A lot.

7106
03:16:30,511 --> 03:16:32,000
It's the whole family is starving.

7107
03:16:32,001 --> 03:16:33,120
It's God damn delicious.

7108
03:16:33,121 --> 03:16:34,200
We've been eating potatoes.

7109
03:16:34,460 --> 03:16:35,220
We'd have been Indian.

7110
03:16:35,220 --> 03:16:39,240
This fucking lobster is
fucking lucky charms.

7111
03:16:40,090 --> 03:16:40,530
Ah,

7112
03:16:40,530 --> 03:16:40,711
dude.

7113
03:16:40,711 --> 03:16:41,610
It's almost four o'clock.

7114
03:16:42,490 --> 03:16:42,930
No,

7115
03:16:42,930 --> 03:16:43,980
I've been rambling forever.

7116
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:44,380
Yeah,

7117
03:16:44,380 --> 03:16:45,840
it's damn time warp in this building.

7118
03:16:46,410 --> 03:16:47,070
How long was,

7119
03:16:47,070 --> 03:16:47,460
how long?

7120
03:16:47,460 --> 03:16:48,640
We've been doing this for 17,

7121
03:16:48,810 --> 03:16:49,950
three hours and 17 minutes.

7122
03:16:49,970 --> 03:16:50,670
Damn.

7123
03:16:50,670 --> 03:16:53,220
Plus Vat for about a
half hour before that.

7124
03:16:53,250 --> 03:16:54,300
Can I plug some dates?

7125
03:16:54,330 --> 03:16:57,750
Please do ladies and
gentlemen live comedy comedy.

7126
03:16:57,751 --> 03:16:58,800
I'm going to be in Cleveland.

7127
03:16:58,801 --> 03:16:59,730
One of my favorite clubs.

7128
03:16:59,750 --> 03:17:01,110
Hilarides love that pledge.

7129
03:17:01,140 --> 03:17:02,910
January 17th through 19th.

7130
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:03,900
That's a great spot.

7131
03:17:04,410 --> 03:17:04,561
Yeah.

7132
03:17:04,561 --> 03:17:05,760
I love that play in Boston.

7133
03:17:05,761 --> 03:17:06,481
I'll be in Boston.

7134
03:17:06,481 --> 03:17:06,810
Jen,

7135
03:17:06,810 --> 03:17:07,591
Laugh Boston.

7136
03:17:07,591 --> 03:17:09,720
January 31st last time I was in Cleveland.

7137
03:17:09,721 --> 03:17:11,460
You were in Cleveland
and I did it with you.

7138
03:17:11,490 --> 03:17:11,941
That's right.

7139
03:17:11,941 --> 03:17:12,774
You stopped buying it.

7140
03:17:12,890 --> 03:17:14,190
The surprise guest spot.

7141
03:17:14,220 --> 03:17:15,053
That was fun.

7142
03:17:15,060 --> 03:17:15,840
That was fun.

7143
03:17:15,840 --> 03:17:16,620
Uh,

7144
03:17:16,620 --> 03:17:17,341
grand rapids,

7145
03:17:17,341 --> 03:17:18,091
Michigan,

7146
03:17:18,091 --> 03:17:18,330
uh,

7147
03:17:18,330 --> 03:17:21,680
in February and then a bunch of other
dates coming in and best buddies.

7148
03:17:21,700 --> 03:17:22,441
I'm doing a benefit.

7149
03:17:22,441 --> 03:17:25,080
January 27th at the comedy store.

7150
03:17:25,081 --> 03:17:25,740
You around,

7151
03:17:25,740 --> 03:17:27,810
Bill Burr is going to be on the show.

7152
03:17:27,890 --> 03:17:28,501
Hang on a second.

7153
03:17:28,501 --> 03:17:29,610
I think you did it last year.

7154
03:17:29,640 --> 03:17:30,900
It's benefiting,

7155
03:17:30,901 --> 03:17:31,350
uh,

7156
03:17:31,350 --> 03:17:32,170
are definitely grouped.

7157
03:17:32,170 --> 03:17:34,290
It helps intellectually disabled people.

7158
03:17:34,380 --> 03:17:36,930
The 27th is a Sunday night.

7159
03:17:36,931 --> 03:17:37,540
Yeah,

7160
03:17:37,540 --> 03:17:38,780
I man Greg.

7161
03:17:38,781 --> 03:17:39,251
Got It.

7162
03:17:39,251 --> 03:17:40,840
Joe Rogan's in come see it.

7163
03:17:40,841 --> 03:17:41,091
And you,

7164
03:17:41,091 --> 03:17:41,900
man.

7165
03:17:41,900 --> 03:17:45,110
I've also got a new podcast with
Alison Rosen called childish,

7166
03:17:45,111 --> 03:17:47,730
where we talk about raising
kids together like her.

7167
03:17:48,080 --> 03:17:48,861
Isn't she great?

7168
03:17:48,861 --> 03:17:49,550
She's very cool.

7169
03:17:49,550 --> 03:17:49,940
Yeah,

7170
03:17:49,940 --> 03:17:50,840
I did her.

7171
03:17:50,841 --> 03:17:51,674
Um,

7172
03:17:52,150 --> 03:17:56,080
I've had her on and I did her
when she was on Adam Carolla.

7173
03:17:56,081 --> 03:17:57,830
I did the show with her dumb together.

7174
03:17:57,831 --> 03:17:58,664
I like her a lot.

7175
03:17:58,670 --> 03:18:00,320
I think I did it a couple
times with her and Adam.

7176
03:18:00,580 --> 03:18:00,860
Yeah.

7177
03:18:00,860 --> 03:18:04,670
We do each other's podcasts
constantly and we just realized like,

7178
03:18:04,820 --> 03:18:06,710
she was my best chemistry.

7179
03:18:06,711 --> 03:18:08,090
So we just started a podcast.

7180
03:18:08,120 --> 03:18:08,361
Yeah.

7181
03:18:08,361 --> 03:18:08,691
She's,

7182
03:18:08,691 --> 03:18:09,140
uh,

7183
03:18:09,140 --> 03:18:10,040
she's kind,

7184
03:18:10,041 --> 03:18:11,090
she's super smart.

7185
03:18:11,300 --> 03:18:11,931
She's cool.

7186
03:18:11,931 --> 03:18:12,880
She's reasonable.

7187
03:18:12,881 --> 03:18:13,521
What she likes,

7188
03:18:13,521 --> 03:18:14,031
thinks about.

7189
03:18:14,031 --> 03:18:15,440
You can tell she's thinking about things,

7190
03:18:15,500 --> 03:18:15,880
right?

7191
03:18:15,880 --> 03:18:16,160
Yeah.

7192
03:18:16,160 --> 03:18:16,460
Yeah.

7193
03:18:16,460 --> 03:18:17,293
That's awesome man.

7194
03:18:17,300 --> 03:18:18,050
I'm glad you're doing that.

7195
03:18:18,050 --> 03:18:18,380
Yeah.

7196
03:18:18,380 --> 03:18:19,370
And what is it called again?

7197
03:18:19,430 --> 03:18:20,300
Childish.

7198
03:18:20,450 --> 03:18:24,350
She's got a baby and another one on the
way and it's kind of me trying to teach

7199
03:18:24,351 --> 03:18:26,600
her how to parent and she's not buying it.

7200
03:18:28,550 --> 03:18:29,420
How many do we,

7201
03:18:29,770 --> 03:18:30,680
we just did one a week.

7202
03:18:30,681 --> 03:18:32,690
I think we've done like seven so far.

7203
03:18:32,810 --> 03:18:33,230
Nice.

7204
03:18:33,230 --> 03:18:34,011
And you still do your own,

7205
03:18:34,011 --> 03:18:34,280
right?

7206
03:18:34,280 --> 03:18:34,780
Yup.

7207
03:18:34,780 --> 03:18:35,613
Uh,

7208
03:18:36,380 --> 03:18:37,213
what's it called?

7209
03:18:39,560 --> 03:18:40,690
How many hours we've been talking.

7210
03:18:41,630 --> 03:18:43,460
We were burnt out.

7211
03:18:43,880 --> 03:18:44,510
Um,

7212
03:18:44,510 --> 03:18:45,500
