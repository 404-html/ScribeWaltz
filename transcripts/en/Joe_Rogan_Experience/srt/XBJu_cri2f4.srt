1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,290
That's it.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,123
Wow.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,660
To count from young Jamie.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,910
That's what the buttons
and hit the other one.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:13,710
Sorry.

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,230
Greg re,

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,570
how are you fella?

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,470
Joe Rogan always a
pleasure to be back in the,

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,950
what I love is that you kept this studio
the same as the old one because the

10
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,120
vibe was perfect.

11
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,930
I tried to recreate it felt
like as long as we had the desk,

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,860
we have the heart,

13
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,900
we have the heart of the studio.

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,090
The rest of it's just stuff and Jamie,

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,280
the heart Jamie fucking guy.

16
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,350
There's something about,

17
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:39,140
uh,

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,531
I,

19
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:39,790
I've,

20
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,450
I really think

21
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,640
that when you use a desk for a long time,

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,170
there's something about desks.

23
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,100
Like if you found out like

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,520
hunters Thompson desks was for sale.

25
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:50,940
Yeah.

26
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,301
You'd be like,

27
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,410
Holy Shit,

28
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,310
I want to get my hands on that thing.

29
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,250
Like that's got some ooze.

30
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:56,740
Right.

31
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,040
You know,

32
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,380
he wrote on this,

33
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,580
Holy Shit.

34
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,271
Yeah.

35
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:04,260
Nice old one of those old like
railway station roll top desks.

36
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:04,981
Oh,

37
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,814
those are the best

38
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,990
I can to protect my shit while I'm out.

39
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:10,861
So nobody reads.

40
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,610
My chairman of my all time favorite

41
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,430
photos of him was him typing in big Sur,

42
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,960
like sitting on like this,

43
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,330
this outside table typing.

44
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,090
I think he's on the edge of a
cliff or something like that.

45
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:25,751
In the background.

46
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:26,650
You see the water,

47
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,350
you know that photo Jamie?

48
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,461
Yeah,

49
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:31,480
that's it right there.

50
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,261
Oh look at that.

51
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,094
And with the pipe,

52
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,240
that is one of the most iconic
writing photos of all time.

53
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,280
A hunters Thompson with hair
with a typewriter in front
of the water at big Sur

54
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,790
and probably like 1960 something.

55
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,710
And you know his schedule it.

56
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:48,760
Did you ever read his schedule?

57
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,900
His daily schedule?

58
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,090
Not only did I read it,

59
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,921
he lived,

60
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:56,920
I read it on air and I might've
read it on air with you.

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,630
I think you did a self portrait.

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,200
Hello?

63
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,300
He took the picture himself.

64
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,280
I said,

65
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,393
oh,

66
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,983
so this was,

67
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,610
I mean it's what it's listed as.

68
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,350
This is in big Sur.

69
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,390
That was when he was in the
early stages of his eruption.

70
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,210
That was like right around when
he was writing hell's angels.

71
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:18,730
Probably one 61.

72
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,613
Yeah.

73
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,420
That motherfucker was unique.

74
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,050
Yeah.

75
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,370
Did you ever see his documentary?

76
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,830
Now there's a couple of really good ones,

77
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,431
but,

78
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:27,880
um,

79
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,161
the,

80
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:30,040
the one that was the mainstream one.

81
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,293
What was that?

82
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:31,871
Yeah,

83
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:32,590
I've gotten so,

84
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,000
yeah,

85
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,870
it was called Gonzo and then there was,

86
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:35,590
um,

87
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,050
there was another one
that was made by BBC.

88
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:39,070
That's really good too,

89
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,500
but yeah,

90
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:44,140
if you could get a hold of
fucking Hemingway's desk.

91
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,353
Wow.

92
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:46,990
Yeah.

93
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,141
Let me,

94
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:47,974
let me maybe like,

95
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,683
worth too much.

96
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,490
Like you wouldn't want to write on it.

97
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,411
Yeah,

98
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,070
that's true.

99
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,260
Yeah.

100
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,240
It's Hemingway's desk,

101
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,860
like I can't write on this fucking thing.

102
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,110
Yeah.

103
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,440
It was hundreds desks I'd
tell I totally right on it.

104
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:58,681
Well,

105
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:00,310
first scrape the excess coke

106
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,390
off the top.

107
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,080
Just lick it,

108
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,913
lick it off.

109
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,860
Wipe did.

110
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,550
As in from the underside of the table.

111
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,060
I'll get the badge sauce off the sides.

112
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,490
What about his typewriter?

113
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,540
How much you think it's typewriter?

114
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,370
Yeah.

115
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,940
Hemingway's house and
hangouts preserved in Havana.

116
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,710
Wow.

117
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,950
So the preserved where he lived,

118
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,160
I wonder if that's
where he killed himself.

119
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,990
I think he was in Cuba
when he killed himself.

120
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,663
Wow.

121
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,751
Yeah,

122
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,140
man,

123
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,973
his um,

124
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,180
his style of writing and like that
whole bravado that went with him though,

125
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,710
he was a different cat.

126
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:42,791
It was like,

127
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,320
uh,

128
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,153
uh,

129
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,320
you thought of him as like
an aggressive male writer.

130
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,070
Like that's an odd thing.

131
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:51,904
Like Hemingway,

132
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,870
you know,

133
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,400
he was a aggressive,

134
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,180
yeah.

135
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,180
It wasn't even Stephen King for all those
most horrific depictions of violence

136
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,030
and Gore and terror in his books.

137
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,310
He's not thought of is like I said,

138
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,680
posing physical thing.

139
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,310
Well Hemingway was in the war.

140
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,790
Yeah.

141
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,530
You know.

142
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,340
Yeah.

143
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,590
He is elderly age.

144
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,850
He was a,

145
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,530
he used to go skiing in the winter in a,

146
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,660
I think it was Switzerland
and they would all,

147
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:22,841
uh,

148
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:24,250
there was no chairlifts back then.

149
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:27,420
So you would fucking grab your 50 pounds,

150
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:31,790
skis and walk up the side
of the Alps Jesus crew,

151
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,750
like a half a day to
take one fucking around.

152
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,310
And he would do that every day.

153
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,660
Don must be amazing for you.

154
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,560
Yeah.

155
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,393
God Damn.

156
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,420
The kind of exercise like
carrying skis up hill in the snow.

157
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,893
Yeah.

158
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,250
That's incredible exercise.

159
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,980
Like I bet there were jacked.

160
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,200
I put those skiers from the olden days.

161
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,680
Yeah.

162
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,060
They had to be like crazy athletes.

163
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,890
Yeah.

164
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,750
And the skis were long back then.

165
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,940
They were like twice as
long as they are now.

166
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,980
When did anybody figure out a ski lift?

167
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,463
I don't know,

168
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,220
but I mean Hemingway
would've been skiing in what?

169
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,860
The 1930s and 27

170
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,270
damn dude.

171
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,020
Yeah.

172
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,750
The Walk Up Hill and ski down.

173
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,950
You gotta be dedicated.

174
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,620
How good are you ever going to get?

175
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
I mean normally you do in a day,

176
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:27,801
maybe you do a dozen runs going up a
couple miles and this one you do one run.

177
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,083
That's it.

178
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,471
Yeah.

179
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:31,730
You gotta be dedicated.

180
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,380
Try getting a,

181
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,720
like a lazy person to do that.

182
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:36,860
Lazy People Ski,

183
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,331
you know what I mean?

184
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:41,810
Because you just kind of get into
it and you can get la Di da Di da.

185
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,150
You don't have to like get crazy.

186
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,750
Right.

187
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,700
You could just see like I'm not good.

188
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,320
So I ski like a Lazy Person.

189
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:48,740
Yeah.

190
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,460
I just like go,

191
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,270
don't fall,

192
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,020
don't fall.

193
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,853
Don't fall.

194
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,723
Don't fall.

195
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,580
That's literally me skiing
because I've had knee surgery.

196
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,290
Three is crazy.

197
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,990
It's crazy how quickly you
can fuck up your body skiing.

198
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:03,830
I am so,

199
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,300
I've skied my whole life.

200
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,640
I've never had an injury and I ski hard.

201
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,770
I hit every fucking jump I can find

202
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,350
be the only one that I know
that like my friend Matt,

203
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,860
he broke his ankle or he broke his ankle
and it happened in the course of like a

204
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,680
just a year.

205
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,990
Yeah.

206
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,550
Two friends at school.

207
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,770
Parents at school blew out their acs.

208
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,940
Oh yeah.

209
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,340
You don't want to do that
when you're 43 you don't.

210
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,641
Right.

211
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:31,820
That's the thing is you get to a certain
age and you the risk reward because

212
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:36,140
injuries takes so much longer to heal
and you have so much less time to live.

213
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,011
You just,

214
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:39,140
the math doesn't work anymore to ski.

215
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,470
You've got to protect
your knees if you can.

216
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,100
Yeah.

217
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,880
Your knees are so God damn important.

218
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,710
Whenever people have like hurt
knees and they keep working out,

219
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,670
I always cringe.

220
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,931
I'm like,

221
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,141
yeah,

222
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:52,430
I'm not going to get it fixed.

223
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,170
I'm just going to rehab it and like,

224
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:55,190
what are we talking about?

225
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:55,940
Rehabbing,

226
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,390
you know,

227
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,771
rehabbing.

228
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:59,090
You just going to ignore the
fact that you don't have an ACL.

229
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,630
Yeah.

230
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,620
Like rehabbing.

231
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,230
Yeah.

232
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,930
It wasn't going to fix,

233
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,763
he's not going to feed,

234
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,440
you don't have the stability in your knee.

235
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:08,090
So there's a lot of guys who blow it out
and they keep exercising and they just

236
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:09,820
show the inside of their knee apart.

237
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,683
Yeah,

238
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,150
yeah,

239
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,331
yeah.

240
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,490
I got something going on in my,

241
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,900
the inside of my left knee
for two fucking months.

242
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,520
If I try to squat down,

243
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,271
it kills.

244
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:21,590
There's like a tended on the
inside of the knee and uh,

245
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,190
so I'm,

246
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,890
I'm going to start some physical therapy
this week to try to figure it out cause

247
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:25,251
I can't,

248
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,820
I have an exercise and fucking two
months just because of this one thing.

249
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,450
Well,

250
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,283
what am I going to do?

251
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,940
I do more cardio.

252
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,430
I don't really know

253
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,150
lift that much.

254
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,980
Have you ever thought about getting like
PRP or Regena keen or anything into it?

255
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,461
Oh,

256
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:39,300
now what's that?

257
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,410
Well,

258
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,020
PRP is platelet rich plasma.

259
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,260
And what they do is they take your blood
and there's some sort of a process they

260
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:48,420
do and they separate it.

261
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,370
And then they take this platelet rich
plasma and inject it into the wounded area

262
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:54,570
and accelerates healing.

263
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,020
Yeah.

264
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,640
A lot of people have really
good results with that.

265
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,480
Yeah.

266
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,410
And then there's this stuff called Regena
keen that's like platelet rich plasma,

267
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:06,411
but it's apparently the next step up in
what they do is they heat your blood and

268
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:07,290
by heating it,

269
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,250
it produces some.

270
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,511
For sure.

271
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:10,201
If you're a doctor,

272
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:13,560
I'm so sorry that I'm butchering
this if you're a scientist,

273
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,980
but I think it produces some sort of
a anti-inflammatory serum because your

274
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,930
blood is reacting to the heat.

275
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,351
Right.

276
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:24,180
Here's the explains.

277
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,610
I've had this done and
it was really effective.

278
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,473
Really?

279
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:27,830
Yeah.

280
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,220
Serum removed from the layer and cultured
with glass beads so that a white,

281
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:32,461
black,

282
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:35,340
white blood cells per two s I r a p,

283
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:37,530
which is a natural anti inflammatory

284
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,180
glass beads going into your knee.

285
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,690
I don't understand what that's saying.

286
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,310
It says serum was removed from this
layer and cultured with glass beads.

287
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,340
So that's removed after
the platelet rich plasma.

288
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:51,140
So they make platelet rich plasma,

289
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,150
they get the serum and then they,

290
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,590
and then they culture it.

291
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,980
So that the white blood cells produced
this natural antiinflammatory.

292
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,400
So they trick the white blood cells,

293
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,720
I guess maybe,

294
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:01,920
for lack of a better word.

295
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,031
Anyway,

296
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:03,864
so this shit,

297
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,970
it's really good for,

298
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,370
uh,

299
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,160
accelerating your recovery
process for an injury.

300
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:12,900
Like a lot of people like
do it like while they,

301
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:13,980
if they get surgery,

302
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,750
they get surgery and then they
have some of this done to,

303
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,950
it accelerates the healing.

304
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,760
Right.

305
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,840
Especially as you get older,

306
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,680
it just provides you with any,

307
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:22,800
it's actually natural to,

308
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:23,640
you don't have to worry about it,

309
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:28,641
but it provides you with this just an
extra boost of healing for weird neck

310
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,990
injuries and back injuries.

311
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:31,940
People like it for,

312
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,520
it's really good.

313
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,140
Really good for lower back injuries.

314
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,910
Have it is inflammation,

315
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:36,744
you know?

316
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,450
And so then they,

317
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:37,811
did they,

318
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,501
is it local?

319
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,270
They shoot the blend into the area?

320
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,840
Yeah,

321
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,560
it's hard.

322
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,130
Yeah,

323
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:42,760
it's freaky.

324
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,550
They put this little needle in you and
then they screw the blood cap in there

325
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:45,851
and it's a,

326
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,470
it's like now it's yellow.

327
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,680
It's like this yellow senior and they
squirted into your back and you're like,

328
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:51,220
Whoa,

329
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,530
damn weird.

330
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,321
Yeah.

331
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:54,154
It's weird.

332
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,440
I think they would do my
cock thicken it up for you,

333
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,190
but I want your blood in my car,

334
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,610
dude.

335
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,750
I don't know if that's legal.

336
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,150
You can sell all kinds of things.

337
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:07,331
Right,

338
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:09,010
but you can't sell
somebody your own blood.

339
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,030
Is that right?

340
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,930
I don't think so.

341
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,670
Do you think he could sell your own blood?

342
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,620
I mean,

343
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,170
if you want to walk a blood bank,

344
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,620
right?

345
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:15,791
Sure.

346
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:16,930
There's a website you could probably do.

347
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,433
You think so?

348
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:18,791
Oh,

349
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,624
like a dark web.

350
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,910
And that whole myth about
selling people's kids.

351
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:22,200
Yeah,

352
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,461
sure.

353
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:24,440
William Shatner would be
dealing it if he could.

354
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:24,981
No,

355
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:25,130
no.

356
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,220
If you could just like,

357
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:27,930
if someone was selling blood,

358
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,860
like some,

359
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,280
you know,

360
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,270
there's a lot of those,

361
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,900
uh,

362
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,610
young enterprising young gals on the
internet that smelled like dirty socks.

363
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,320
Oh yeah.

364
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,770
They'll,

365
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,603
they'll,

366
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,760
they sell toenail clippers and share it.

367
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,670
I'm not kidding.

368
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,343
I'm not kidding.

369
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:44,963
Yeah.

370
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,500
Nothing.

371
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,700
Nothing goes to waste.

372
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,150
No,

373
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,900
nothing goes full.

374
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,640
Blood for sale is illegal.

375
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:51,361
Red Market.

376
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:51,901
What is this,

377
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,200
Jamie?

378
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,291
Oh,

379
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,124
this is like,

380
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,443
this is a,

381
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,250
they're doing it like medically though.

382
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,283
In an alleyway.

383
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,231
Yeah.

384
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,340
But that's how they do it there,

385
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,751
man.

386
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:01,584
That's crazy.

387
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,230
Is there still a ban on a

388
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,430
Haitian people and gay
people giving blood?

389
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,120
That's a very good
question because they've,

390
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,770
they've gotten so close to stopping HIV,

391
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,560
they can get it like not
it correct me if I'm wrong,

392
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,570
they can get it like to you
to the point where you're,

393
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,980
you can't even detect it.

394
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,873
Oh yeah.

395
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,103
Which is incredible.

396
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,600
Yeah.

397
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,980
And then now in the third world,

398
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:27,401
because my,

399
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:27,760
uh,

400
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,780
my friend Peter Current,

401
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,740
he lives in a symbolic way and uh,

402
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,330
now Mozambique and he used to work for
the health department in La County.

403
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:40,330
He was the guy that was in
charge of AIDS prevention.

404
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,720
And so he got a job working over in
Africa and he said that you can now cure,

405
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,341
not cure,

406
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:53,341
but stabilize somebody with HIV
with a pill that's like $60 a month

407
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,180
or something like that.

408
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,840
Wow.

409
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,141
Yeah.

410
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:58,420
They've got the price
way down in Africa now.

411
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,650
That's incredible.

412
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,880
Why is there's so many
cases of HIV in Africa?

413
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,893
MMM.

414
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,660
Well,

415
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,800
I think when nutrition is poor but
then there's more cutting and bleeding

416
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,300
because I had heard that a lot of
what you see in terms of like a,

417
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,910
if they're talking about aids in Africa,

418
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,580
that you,

419
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,270
it's very easy to put aids,

420
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,970
like put like that category aids,

421
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:27,780
um,

422
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,960
that sometimes it's just people with
damaged immune systems from a host of

423
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:35,100
different diseases that it's sometimes
the people aren't getting tested.

424
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,650
I was wondered like how many of
those people are tested for HIV?

425
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,071
Right,

426
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:38,450
right.

427
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,283
What is,

428
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,161
but the,

429
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:43,920
the fact that a guy like magic Johnson
has had it since you remember when you

430
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:46,440
heard Magic Johnson had I was in a panic.

431
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,770
Yeah.

432
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,360
I felt like it was a Zombie movie.

433
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,470
Like it's happened.

434
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,480
It started and then people
are just going to get it.

435
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:52,620
We're all gonna die of AIDS.

436
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,800
Everybody what our generation
when you and I were like 21.

437
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,000
That's what everybody thought.

438
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,860
Everyone's going to die
from AIDS right now.

439
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,930
Magic Johnson's looks great.

440
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,171
Yeah.

441
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:01,970
He's still alive.

442
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,700
Yeah.

443
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,080
I think of how many people have died.

444
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,870
We didn't have HIV and we're
worried about this one thing.

445
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,310
I remember he wanted to play in the all
star game and all the players were like,

446
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:11,821
Nah,

447
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:12,654
I'm good.

448
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,560
It's going to be a slam dunk contest.

449
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,453
But

450
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,630
Jesus Christ.

451
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,480
But what did,

452
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,720
what did fucking Damon Wayans you
used to have a bit about Dennis Rodman

453
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:30,740
did.

454
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,070
It's about Dennis Rodman spitting in
Magic Johnson's mouth to accelerate his

455
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:35,904
symptoms.

456
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,810
He's like,

457
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,910
if he wanted to try to
get hardcore with them,

458
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,600
I hope Damon's,

459
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,270
I'm a huge Damon Wayans fan,

460
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,120
so I hope I'm not butchering his bid.

461
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,870
Yeah,

462
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,850
but I think that was one.

463
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,440
I know that was his line.

464
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,760
I'll spit your mouth and
accelerate your symptom.

465
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,420
Dude.

466
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,740
I'm Damon Wayans.

467
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:03,360
My opinion is like one of
the most ignored greats.

468
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,650
I agree 100%.

469
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,750
I used to open for him sometimes and uh,

470
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,761
twice.

471
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:10,860
I remember him coming
in on a Thursday night.

472
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,390
It was Thursday to Sunday.

473
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:13,770
Faneuil hall comedy connection.

474
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,780
Thursday night he comes
in fucking yellow pads.

475
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,490
He goes up and just regurgitates
a new hour and gets okay,

476
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:25,020
laugh for a new hour.

477
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,040
Friday night,

478
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,140
he comes back tighter,

479
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,910
tighter Sunday night.

480
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,540
It's like he would fucking
destroy with a new hour.

481
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,170
It was crazy.

482
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,270
He's really good,

483
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:36,600
man.

484
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:36,990
Yeah.

485
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,650
He would go,

486
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,650
he would just go up at the comedy store
and literally let whatever thought came

487
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:48,000
into his head and he would take long
sets and he would take that stuff and he

488
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:51,030
would turn that stuff
into killer closing bits.

489
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:51,500
Yeah.

490
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,070
But for whatever

491
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,371
reason,

492
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:54,770
I think he just got
into doing sitcoms more.

493
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,340
Right.

494
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,173
It was like,

495
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,260
fuck it.

496
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,620
Yeah.

497
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,453
You know?

498
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,661
Yeah.

499
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:00,494
He's uh,

500
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,421
he's can,

501
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:02,450
that's an interesting family,

502
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:02,690
man.

503
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:02,781
They,

504
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:03,021
you know,

505
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:04,970
they grew up in the projects in Manhattan.

506
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,660
Dude.

507
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,950
Talent in that family.

508
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:07,400
Yeah.

509
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,233
Keenan,

510
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,883
Damon,

511
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,110
Marlin,

512
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,730
Sean.

513
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,740
When Jesus Christ.

514
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,603
Yeah.

515
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,900
That's a lot of camps.

516
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,020
And isn't Damon's son
doing stand up to now?

517
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:18,680
Yeah.

518
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,780
Dude at Daymond Junior.

519
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:21,200
Right.

520
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,340
What a crazy family.

521
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,770
I now that's a crate.

522
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,980
You better be in show business
and that family or you're doomed.

523
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,473
Yeah.

524
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,920
Let me think about that.

525
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:31,754
It's like,

526
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,240
right.

527
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,550
Like if you want to
compete with your brothers,

528
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,070
Keenan and every weigh ins,

529
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,011
Damon Wayans,

530
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:37,641
Kim Wayins,

531
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:38,181
Sean wins.

532
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:38,871
Marlon Wayans,

533
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,280
Damien Dante wanes.

534
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,780
Damien Wayne's junior.

535
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,843
That's all of them.

536
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,210
Yeah.

537
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,320
All of them in showbizness.

538
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,483
It's amazing.

539
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,063
Yep.

540
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,761
Good luck.

541
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:50,800
And to teen in the,

542
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:54,030
had a fucking great talk show how the VA,

543
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,280
he was really good as a talk show host.

544
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,550
Yeah.

545
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,900
He was so talented.

546
00:15:58,901 --> 00:15:59,810
Fucking family man.

547
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,930
But for whatever reason,

548
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:03,610
Matt Damon did this one,

549
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,670
a HBO special and I think he
called it his last stand and uh,

550
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,810
it was really good,

551
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:11,051
man.

552
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:12,310
It was really good.

553
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:12,851
And the end of it,

554
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:14,860
he just throws the
microphone down and says,

555
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:14,990
look,

556
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,430
this is the last time I'm doing stand up.

557
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,200
Oh no shit.

558
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,950
Yeah.

559
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,420
Wow.

560
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,290
Just like it decided he
was going to do movies.

561
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,053
That's it.

562
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,740
Last stand with a question mark.

563
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,933
Yeah,

564
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,650
he got um,

565
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,553
you know,

566
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,730
he just got into other stuff,

567
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:31,481
but I'm telling you,

568
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:32,314
man,

569
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,130
when he was like,

570
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,700
go up and above go that photo though.

571
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:37,690
The one like that was the stage,

572
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,400
the baret wearing stage.

573
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,220
Yeah.

574
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,590
Dude,

575
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:40,781
he,

576
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:41,650
I'm telling you,

577
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,390
people forgot.

578
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,650
He's one of the best,

579
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,060
one of the best ever do.

580
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:49,660
He would murder that
one particular special.

581
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:51,070
It's just murderous.

582
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,990
He had a lot of great sets.

583
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,853
Yup.

584
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,790
On television,

585
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,940
but just like real original too.

586
00:16:57,941 --> 00:16:58,780
Like one of those guys,

587
00:16:58,781 --> 00:16:59,890
we'd watch them and you go,

588
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:00,521
God damn.

589
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,354
Why didn't I think

590
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,580
well and his voices were so fucking good.

591
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:03,791
You know?

592
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,120
A lot of times people do their
girlfriend voice and it's just,

593
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,500
it just sucks.

594
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,810
It just sounds like the
guy raising his voice.

595
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:14,080
There's no like female
intonation to it or anything.

596
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,380
And his kids voices and
his wife or girlfriend.

597
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:18,640
Very just fucking amazing.

598
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,483
Yeah.

599
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:21,851
Oh,

600
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:23,560
and then of course it's
like Richard Pryor.

601
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,491
Richard Pryor.

602
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:25,090
So good.

603
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,550
I mean you had so many
characters in living color.

604
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,900
How about handyman?

605
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,870
You could never do that.

606
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,763
Yeah,

607
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,170
that's right.

608
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,320
You could never do that
to a homeless guy too.

609
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:40,750
That's another show in living color
is another show that people forget.

610
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,280
They forget how good it was.

611
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,520
Yeah,

612
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,051
there he is.

613
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:44,740
There's handyman.

614
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,380
They don't even show
reruns of that show too.

615
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:48,940
That show reruns a handyman.

616
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,770
I remember what it was on TV,

617
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,310
man.

618
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,050
No one could stop saying,

619
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:58,381
homie,

620
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,214
don't play that.

621
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,570
Everybody would say that.

622
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,441
Everybody was like,

623
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:01,741
Homie,

624
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:02,610
don't play that.

625
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,320
Like every kid would say that because
homey the clown homie don't play that.

626
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,183
People Forget.

627
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,250
People fucking forgot
about homey the clown.

628
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,680
They should come back.

629
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,860
Netflix please throw some money
at getting it back on the air.

630
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:21,600
They just tried to do it
and it all fell apart.

631
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,440
What happened?

632
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,750
I know they had big money and uh,

633
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,090
I don't know if it was going
to be the original cast.

634
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:28,920
I might've been part of the original cast.

635
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,461
I bet.

636
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:30,670
What happened was Jennifer Lopez,

637
00:18:30,671 --> 00:18:31,680
do you want to be a fly girl?

638
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:31,951
Yeah.

639
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:32,460
Right.

640
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:32,911
She's like,

641
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:33,744
no,

642
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,790
she should jump on that shit.

643
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,270
That would be cool if she jumped
back in was a fly girl again.

644
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,530
I mean how much time would it take?

645
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,270
How much time she's there.

646
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:42,881
She's there.

647
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:44,370
I mean she probably
could dance in her sleep.

648
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:44,970
Yup.

649
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,803
Yup.

650
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,973
Damn.

651
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,510
I would love that to be a fire girl.

652
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,080
You have it.

653
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,360
I don't know who else was a flag
around any other famous ones.

654
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,160
That show was so good.

655
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,690
I remember watching it.

656
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,550
I was playing pool in Yonkers,

657
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:00,384
New York,

658
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,730
and I looked up at this,

659
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:05,730
this TV set and it was
a Jim Carrey doing the,

660
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,863
the,

661
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,950
the fire Marshall.

662
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:09,190
The fire Marshall Bill.

663
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:09,440
Yeah.

664
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,691
I was like,

665
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,220
what the fuck is going on?

666
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:11,440
Yeah.

667
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,050
This guy's got a burnt up face.

668
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,343
That's

669
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,590
Rosie Perez was the choreograph
choreographer for the first four seasons.

670
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,210
Wow.

671
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:20,981
You know Rosie Perez,

672
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:22,710
a giant boxing fan.

673
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,700
Oh yeah.

674
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,660
Giant boxing,

675
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,170
Huh?

676
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,770
Yeah.

677
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,431
Like people,

678
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,290
like she's like a boxing expert,

679
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,340
not like an expert.

680
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:30,240
Like she could train fighters,

681
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:33,720
but like people asked her
questions about boxing.

682
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,130
She's a real enthusiast.

683
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:36,570
That's a better term instead of an expert.

684
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:36,781
I mean,

685
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:37,680
maybe she is an expert,

686
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:38,514
I don't know.

687
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,011
But,

688
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,450
uh,

689
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,440
she is always around box.

690
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,031
I think it's so,

691
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:46,210
because you always think of her as
having that cute voice and you know,

692
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:49,760
and all those comedies and to see
her at like boxing matches a really,

693
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:50,300
really into it.

694
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,000
So,

695
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,833
yeah.

696
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,423
Cool.

697
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,050
Um,

698
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,871
and Jim Carrey,

699
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:55,111
I mean,

700
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,070
Jesus Christ,

701
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:56,310
he would,

702
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,971
he would do the,

703
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:57,570
uh,

704
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,400
the a convenience store,

705
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,840
a security guy,

706
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,660
and he was just so big and so big.

707
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,950
So different than like,

708
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:07,740
I mean you have to go back to Jerry Lewis
to think about somebody doing physical

709
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:09,000
comedy that well,

710
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,211
yeah,

711
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:09,810
he was,

712
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,830
he was a 10,

713
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,100
like is his energy and everything was
like the fucking ace Ventura movie.

714
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,040
Yeah.

715
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,080
Like that move was just all performance.

716
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:19,231
Yeah.

717
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:20,140
Like what does this one,

718
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,380
what is this Vera de Milo to
that fucking show was so good.

719
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:25,980
Yeah.

720
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,880
People forgot.

721
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,743
Yeah.

722
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,201
Yeah.

723
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:28,981
There's fire Marshall,

724
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:29,161
Bill.

725
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,060
So I was in,

726
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,520
I was in this pool hall and I looked up,

727
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:32,821
I'm like,

728
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:34,470
what the fuck is that?

729
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,130
And they're like,

730
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,660
that's fire Marshall Bill.

731
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,180
That's,

732
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,011
that's what it is.

733
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:38,731
He came in like that.

734
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:38,971
I was like,

735
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,200
that is the creepy shit I've ever seen.

736
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,500
I can't believe they have
a character like this.

737
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,780
It was so over the top.

738
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,070
Do you think Jim Carrey or maybe,

739
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,600
uh,

740
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,540
the one of the Wayne's brothers has bought
up the rights for reruns because they

741
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,740
don't want that

742
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,073
black.

743
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,970
Yeah,

744
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,540
no,

745
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,590
it's a different era.

746
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,600
You have to accept as a different era.

747
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,513
You just,

748
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,503
people were different.

749
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:03,960
Look,

750
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,370
people are changing and it's a really
interesting obvious sign that things that

751
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:09,630
were super acceptable.

752
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:11,760
And when was this in living color?

753
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,100
I want to say it was like 92,

754
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:15,090
90 to 94.

755
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,230
90 and 94.

756
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:16,680
Yeah.

757
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,680
So that the way you could do certain
bits and what you'd get away with and put

758
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,851
on television,

759
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:24,684
it was just different.

760
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,240
So I think that's one of the,

761
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,300
like probably one of the least understood
things that's happening with us with

762
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:34,380
social media is,

763
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,770
is the rapid evolution
of what's acceptable,

764
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:38,970
not acceptable anymore.

765
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,600
And it's changing very
quickly in terms of subjects,

766
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,270
in terms of the way you approach things,

767
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:49,350
in terms of like obvious
bigotry or obvious bias.

768
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,300
It's like it's all
getting very highlighted.

769
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:52,411
Well the,

770
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:57,411
I think the big question is whether or
not you see an artist as somebody who's

771
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,620
taking their inner vision.

772
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,620
And putting it out and you
go for the ride or you don't,

773
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,150
or is it,

774
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,980
are we supposed to be representing society
in our standup or is it all supposed

775
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:09,910
to be fair,

776
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,860
balanced representations of
different ethnic groups and genders,

777
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,550
you know,

778
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:15,821
and,

779
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:16,654
and it's like,

780
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,060
when did it all have to
become a morality tale?

781
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,690
When did every depiction of
every race have to be fair?

782
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,833
You know,

783
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,870
can't you have an asshole who's black?

784
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:31,000
Can't you have a killer who's gay
without it becoming a depiction of that

785
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:31,834
entire,

786
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,703
you know,

787
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,603
subgroup?

788
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,261
Yeah.

789
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:35,094
It's like,

790
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:35,920
if,

791
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,510
what are our real problem is
that prejudice does exist.

792
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,800
So when it does exist,

793
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:43,020
you kind of look for it
and things and you say,

794
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:43,650
hey,

795
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,780
this has the characteristics of prejudice.

796
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,980
I see this here.

797
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:48,120
I see what you're doing here.

798
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,680
That I think this is prejudice.

799
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,161
We say,

800
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:50,311
no,

801
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:50,371
no,

802
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:50,581
no.

803
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:52,710
This is making fun of Puerto Rican men.

804
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,360
This is not prejudice.

805
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:54,720
Yeah.

806
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,270
This is,

807
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,070
uh,

808
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,990
an account of real occurrences
that I've turned into humor.

809
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,400
Yeah.

810
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,620
The,

811
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,890
the flamboyant masculinity
of Puerto Rican men.

812
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,110
I mean like in New York,

813
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,630
like that's if you,

814
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:13,980
if you thought of a type
of a Latino sort of,

815
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:14,370
uh,

816
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,870
the bravado,

817
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,321
you know,

818
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:17,370
the music,

819
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:18,031
the food,

820
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:19,260
everything spicy.

821
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,330
Like if you can't make fun of that.

822
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:21,511
Yeah.

823
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:21,990
Yeah.

824
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,560
Come on.

825
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,080
I Know Collin Quinn does a
whole thing about how racist,

826
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:25,380
right?

827
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,330
Puerto Ricans who never inside or outside,

828
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:28,164
they're always both.

829
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:32,130
There's always a window open to people
on the inside and outside of dogging.

830
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,080
The car door is always open.

831
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,130
They're half in the car.

832
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:36,150
They're half right.

833
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:37,350
This isn't racist.

834
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,670
This is observation.

835
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,070
Can I take an option rate?

836
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,790
Can I tell you that yesterday,

837
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:42,720
about twice a week,

838
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:46,220
I go to this Japanese market in Mar
Vista and they've got all different

839
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,761
kinds of,

840
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:47,420
uh,

841
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,721
you know,

842
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:52,721
you can get Sushi tempura whatever
the parking lot for this place,

843
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:58,541
because 80% of the people that are
Asian film it and put it on a fucking

844
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,601
television channel.

845
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:00,320
It is,

846
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,550
it is just people.

847
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,540
Why don't you produce it?

848
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,000
I could announce it like I was Adj Foy.

849
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,810
You're an Emmy award winning writer.

850
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,580
You could actually do something like that.

851
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,050
You're like a legit writer,

852
00:24:11,051 --> 00:24:12,310
you could totally produce that.

853
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,950
Can you imagine announced it like Nascar?

854
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,090
It's just people like not getting how
to get out of a parking spot with us

855
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:24,091
taking like eight k turns and people on
the wrong side of the street and backing

856
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:27,100
up without looking over the shoulders
and they're all Asian and it's fucking

857
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:27,910
hilarious.

858
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,600
I didn't,

859
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,830
I didn't tell them to do it.

860
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,690
I didn't say it was wrong,

861
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,280
but it's happening.

862
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,863
Yeah.

863
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,540
Dave explained it,

864
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,290
um,

865
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,210
why it's a stereotype,

866
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,150
but why also why Asian people would,

867
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:42,780
um,

868
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,720
be more likely to walk straight.

869
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,890
And you know,

870
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,521
like if you,

871
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:50,670
if you go to China or if
you go to any of those,

872
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:50,850
uh,

873
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,680
Asian company,

874
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:51,930
uh,

875
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,770
Asian countries,

876
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,900
when people walk straight at each other,

877
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,570
they all kind of have this
way of touching and they just,

878
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,590
there's so many people,

879
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:00,270
they're just grinding past each other,

880
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:00,630
right?

881
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,950
So,

882
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,080
yeah.

883
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,411
Yeah.

884
00:25:01,411 --> 00:25:04,020
So when you're in China in particular,

885
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,590
people are like indifferent
to bumping into you.

886
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,180
It doesn't bother them at all.

887
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,350
They just bump into you.

888
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,851
Like,

889
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:12,540
if you're in the aisle of a plane,

890
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,830
they just bump into you.

891
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,310
Yeah.

892
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,851
Like they'll do it.

893
00:25:14,851 --> 00:25:16,550
The little kids just
walk right through it.

894
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,070
Right.

895
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,491
It's just,

896
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:18,271
that's how they did.

897
00:25:18,271 --> 00:25:19,104
It's not rude.

898
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,730
Just like how's culturally different?

899
00:25:20,731 --> 00:25:20,761
Yeah.

900
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:21,750
Cause it's more crowded.

901
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,370
Why can't you comment on that?

902
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,780
Or couldn't you comment on that?

903
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:25,614
If that's a real thing,

904
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,610
because that is a real thing.

905
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:27,450
They do do that.

906
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:27,930
Yeah.

907
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,610
They also do a lot of great stuff.

908
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:29,761
I mean,

909
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:30,780
it's not like you're not,

910
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,050
it's a negative judgment on the
entire race because they have this one

911
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:34,884
characteristic.

912
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,920
But to ignore that one
characteristic seems crazy.

913
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:38,881
It's like,

914
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:41,190
why can't I talk about something like,

915
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:41,760
I'm not,

916
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,170
it's not mean I'm not a bad person to
talk about a real thing that you see.

917
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:47,010
And I see.

918
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,873
Yeah.

919
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:48,600
I get,

920
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,300
I get booed on stage sometimes.

921
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,400
Now that never used to happen for what?

922
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:54,234
What'd he say?

923
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,890
I did a joke.

924
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,060
We don't have to say the joke,

925
00:25:57,061 --> 00:25:58,280
but just say it.

926
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,660
I don't care because I
don't think it's offensive,

927
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,111
but there's,

928
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:03,510
but this person did and it was uh,

929
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,140
you know,

930
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,010
I go,

931
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,671
oh it's girl,

932
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:06,960
it's girl scout cookie season.

933
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:10,230
Those little horrors are out there
popping up their tables wherever you are

934
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:11,550
selling those stale,

935
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,320
shitty,

936
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,153
overpriced.

937
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,570
But you buy them cause
it makes you feel good.

938
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:16,650
Like you're a good person,

939
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,280
you know,

940
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,250
and then you walk through the parking lot
and some black kid comes up with a box

941
00:26:20,251 --> 00:26:21,270
of snickers gone,

942
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,070
hey we use support my basketball team.

943
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:25,590
And you're like that's a fucking scamps

944
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,270
guy goes Ooh,

945
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,070
they're not all skin.

946
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,220
I'm like,

947
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,440
that's not what we're saying.

948
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,313
Stupid.

949
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,243
Yeah.

950
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,780
You're doing a character.

951
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,780
I'm commenting on a very real thing.

952
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:44,220
My entire life I have
bought girl scout and I have

953
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,000
not always bought that fucking
snickers bar in the subway or the,

954
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,170
sometimes I do.

955
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,481
Yeah,

956
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:52,970
the girl scout cookies.

957
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,320
It's universally accepted.

958
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,850
Yeah.

959
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,683
Right.

960
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,360
But they only have like the ones
that are like are the ones that,

961
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,020
it's like a coconut one with someone.

962
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,010
I like chocolate on it on that one.

963
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,260
This one's pretty good Karma.

964
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,800
Allen's pretty as a legit,

965
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,970
but they've got one called

966
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,100
the muff,

967
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,110
but then there's also like there's steps
away from girl scout cookies where,

968
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:16,231
well,

969
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:17,490
you don't have to participate.

970
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,980
Like when kids come over
with chocolate or candy.

971
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,830
Yeah,

972
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,230
thanks.

973
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,590
Yeah,

974
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,960
good.

975
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,711
I don't eat that stuff,

976
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:24,420
which you kind of have to
buy girl scout cookies.

977
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:25,430
You want to support the girls camp,

978
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,760
but you know it's such a scam.

979
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:28,770
All that money goes to the manufacturer.

980
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:32,370
Apparently the girl scouts make
like 20% of the the cookie money.

981
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:32,821
Really?

982
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:33,001
Yeah.

983
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:33,834
They're getting fucked.

984
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,453
Girls Scouts again,

985
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,390
core.

986
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,470
Someone came in,

987
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,180
some ruthless man.

988
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:40,650
Probably the MOA.

989
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,360
Moa is,

990
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,860
that's exactly what it is.

991
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:44,790
Those are the shit.

992
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,450
Yeah.

993
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,230
With milk.

994
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,760
With a cold glass of milk.

995
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,840
Duncombe Yup.

996
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,590
Fuck yeah.

997
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,410
It almost tastes like a neat look at that.

998
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,900
Then look at it.

999
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,801
It's chocolate.

1000
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:56,321
Eat Coconut.

1001
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:57,180
He goodness.

1002
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,510
Why do they have to be so bad for you?

1003
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,823
When I was,

1004
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,410
when I was working on a TV show,

1005
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,520
one of the producers had a daughter who
was in the girl scouts and I guess you

1006
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,380
win contest if you sell over.

1007
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,480
He saw the most cookie boxes.

1008
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:18,000
So when the audience would stream out
after the show is a daily Shell and the

1009
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:23,001
audience was stream out and the girl had
a table set up to sell our cookies and

1010
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:28,071
she was selling a hundred boxes a
day and for every day she was there,

1011
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,110
fucking won that contest dam

1012
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,240
and they would have the audience,

1013
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:38,460
a warm up guy like plug
it during the shell,

1014
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:39,241
like after the shit,

1015
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:41,400
like a comedian selling
his cds after the show,

1016
00:28:41,401 --> 00:28:45,180
he could buy some girl scout cookies
on the way out and all these,

1017
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,920
all these fat people from the Midwest,

1018
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:48,570
they're like Kooky,

1019
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,420
like Marie Callender's died.

1020
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,750
Just have pie.

1021
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,340
Just Pie chess pie.

1022
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,013
Yup.

1023
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,370
Not even good pie.

1024
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,941
It's good,

1025
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:01,890
but it's not great
considering it's all they do.

1026
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,120
I should have eaten there.

1027
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,410
I don't think I've ever eaten there.

1028
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,290
Maybe one.

1029
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,290
Hmm.

1030
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,310
I don't think I had their pie.

1031
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,840
That seems a weird thing.

1032
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,370
Like come selling pies.

1033
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:11,840
Yeah.

1034
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,100
Be like,

1035
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,933
good luck.

1036
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,253
You're going to go broke.

1037
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,920
But they're everywhere.

1038
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:20,910
We know you have an element.

1039
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,170
We know you have flour branch out a little
bit like who the fuck gets famous as

1040
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:26,130
selling pies?

1041
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,860
Like how genius is that company?

1042
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,220
Admins member Edmonds
intimates but then they,

1043
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:32,730
they,

1044
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,481
they broke out.

1045
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,070
They started doing cakes and cookies too,

1046
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:35,490
but they all,

1047
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,200
they did just pies for a long time.

1048
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,591
Dude.

1049
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:39,420
They used to have this,

1050
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,780
this,

1051
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,850
God dammit this pastry.

1052
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,010
I'm trying to think of
what the hell it was,

1053
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,210
but it had like,

1054
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,750
like hard sugar on the outside of it and
then it had some sort of creamy sweet

1055
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:54,370
stuff on the inside of it.

1056
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,810
Holy Shit.

1057
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:56,370
Was it good?

1058
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,203
Yeah.

1059
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,120
God Damn.

1060
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,080
We lived off that shit.

1061
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:00,130
We ain't meds every night.

1062
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,964
They had like,

1063
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,450
they had one that had like a chocolate
filling in it and it was powdered outsize

1064
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:07,620
filled mine.

1065
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,790
They went out of business
and then they say,

1066
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,290
oh that was the cheese one.

1067
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,580
That was a good one too.

1068
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:14,170
I remember that cheese filled crumb.

1069
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,340
Those,

1070
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,710
they had some ridiculously delicious shit.

1071
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:18,310
Yeah.

1072
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,330
What are the other big ones?

1073
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,291
You know,

1074
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,200
I decided to fight in a
tournament once because a,

1075
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:26,170
I had a crazy sugar
high from Dunkin donuts.

1076
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,860
I'd hurt myself or hurt,

1077
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,520
um,

1078
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,950
something in my crotch and I
couldn't work out for like a week.

1079
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,460
Pulled some sort of a muscle and there
was a big tournament that was coming up.

1080
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:37,930
And uh,

1081
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,300
my,

1082
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,500
uh,

1083
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,031
all the,

1084
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:40,060
the guys that are competed with,

1085
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:40,811
we're going to this tournament.

1086
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:43,210
It was like I had just
fought like a week before.

1087
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:43,451
I was like,

1088
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:44,410
I don't think I can do it.

1089
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:44,680
I'm like,

1090
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,760
this doesn't feel right.

1091
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,260
I'm just gonna take the whole week off.

1092
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,270
So I decided I'm just going to take off,

1093
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:50,170
let this thing heal.

1094
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:50,951
And so,

1095
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:51,190
uh,

1096
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:56,050
delivering my newspapers and
I go to Dunkin donuts and
I got this powdered lemon

1097
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:57,400
filled donut.

1098
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,260
I got one of those and I got a,

1099
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:00,950
a Boston cream donut,

1100
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,443
one of those.

1101
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,010
And I got a,

1102
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,820
I ate like three donuts
cause I'd be exhausted,

1103
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,810
tired,

1104
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,800
drinking coffee,

1105
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,750
delivering fucking
newspapers for three hours.

1106
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,700
And I was so jacked on sugar
and coffee that I said,

1107
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,271
fuck it.

1108
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:17,104
I want to fight.

1109
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,250
And so I drove,

1110
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,370
I drove into town like right
before everybody was leaving.

1111
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:23,681
They were like,

1112
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,430
why are you here?

1113
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:24,781
I said,

1114
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:25,840
if I'm going to fight anyway,

1115
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:26,674
man,

1116
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,050
like Beavis and Butthead,

1117
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,980
I won.

1118
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,873
I won the tournament.

1119
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,550
Giant tournament for me it was big.

1120
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,170
It was the American open.

1121
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,004
It was like a big,

1122
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,053
it's a big deal.

1123
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:37,840
Wow.

1124
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,620
Yeah,

1125
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,460
it wasn't going to do it.

1126
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,670
I got jacked up on sugar
and made a rash decision.

1127
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,840
I can see you winning
the first match but then,

1128
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,410
but then,

1129
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,630
then you crash.

1130
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,130
No,

1131
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,010
you got to keep fighting.

1132
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,120
No it didn't.

1133
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,650
It worked out somehow or another,

1134
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:52,330
I guess I ate when I got there too,

1135
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,820
but also the week off
I had never done that.

1136
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:55,780
Like taking a week off.

1137
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,810
Sometimes when you do
something like that where you,

1138
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:00,970
if you exercise too much,

1139
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,800
you really always in a state of recovery
and your body doesn't get a chance to

1140
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,600
like fully charged back up again.

1141
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,430
So at the time I was probably 19
and I was going hard like every day,

1142
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,191
every day that I could.

1143
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,870
So I'd never really taken a week off.

1144
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,790
So taking a week off and just be like,

1145
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,240
wow,

1146
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,800
this is,

1147
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,760
I did take a week off when
I started getting laid.

1148
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,330
Yeah.

1149
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,700
That is one thing that happened
the first time he got late.

1150
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,180
Yeah.

1151
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,590
When I first started getting laid,

1152
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,250
I took a long time off and get yelled at.

1153
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,213
Yeah.

1154
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,280
Like I yelled and I
wasn't doing any training.

1155
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,020
I came back all tanned and shit.

1156
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,070
All he did was fuck a workout at

1157
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,581
that age.

1158
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,414
That's a workout.

1159
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,600
You know?

1160
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,330
Th those weren't 20 minutes sessions.

1161
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,980
It's weird how your,

1162
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:49,250
your body changes from no,

1163
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,430
no urge to fuck to like
fucking is your whole life.

1164
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,350
Like when you're 18 years old,

1165
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,420
it's your whole life.

1166
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,840
Like you found the craziest drug ever.

1167
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,170
Yeah.

1168
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,010
And like two years ago,

1169
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:02,910
it wasn't in your life.

1170
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,850
Then all of a sudden it's in your life
and then all of a sudden you're having

1171
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:06,740
sex and you're like,

1172
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,360
I can't believe that.

1173
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:08,830
Yeah.

1174
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,000
And you can't believe that,

1175
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:14,140
that women are letting you do it because
for years they were stopping you and

1176
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:15,520
now they're initiating.

1177
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,310
Yes.

1178
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,710
Can't leave.

1179
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,221
They want it.

1180
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:18,510
You actually want me to fuck you.

1181
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:18,870
Yeah.

1182
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,740
This is what you like.

1183
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:20,940
Yeah.

1184
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,720
Okay.

1185
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,080
Yeah.

1186
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,980
It feels wrong.

1187
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,190
But if you insist it feels
wrong that you like it.

1188
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,760
This is a weird mentality that we
think it's wrong that they like,

1189
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,010
is that a Christian thing?

1190
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,040
So crazy.

1191
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,010
I think it has to do with,

1192
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,690
um,

1193
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:38,270
initially if you read sex at dawn a,

1194
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,550
he's got a really
interesting series of uh,

1195
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,470
thoughts on the origins of
sexual behavior and why,

1196
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,310
why we all sort of have
adopted this one thing now.

1197
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,480
What do you think?

1198
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,313
Let me ask you,

1199
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,650
I think it's Christian.

1200
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:54,670
I know it is for me.

1201
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,181
You know,

1202
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:55,661
I got a lot of,

1203
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:55,840
hey,

1204
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,620
I got a lot of shame

1205
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,453
about all that stuff.

1206
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,710
I think it has to do with
people getting pregnant too.

1207
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,993
Yeah.

1208
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,590
I think it had to do with,

1209
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:07,850
it was too easy for a girl to get pregnant
and if a girl got pregnant back when

1210
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:10,820
people were fucking just barely
making it out of the caves.

1211
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,960
Right.

1212
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,430
It was either really good cause he had
food or it was a real burden because you

1213
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,660
had to take care of this baby now,

1214
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,071
now you're,

1215
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:19,760
you're not going to be
gathering food for us.

1216
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:20,270
Right.

1217
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,070
I think there was a lot of that going on.

1218
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:25,610
So if you were going to be with a person
and you've decided to make babies,

1219
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,900
you got to be sure that this person
is going to be there and take care of

1220
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,890
everything and you're,

1221
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:31,820
you're all set up.

1222
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:32,390
Yeah.

1223
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,030
So you can't just be banging a bunch of
guys on the side and having kids with

1224
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:35,361
everybody.

1225
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:36,470
Then who's going to raise your kids?

1226
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,333
Right.

1227
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,100
This guy's going to come over and talk
to his kid and he's gonna come over and

1228
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:40,934
talk to his kid.

1229
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,530
Yeah.

1230
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,340
That'd becomes a problem.

1231
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:43,970
Right.

1232
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:44,980
I think that's,

1233
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,070
and the amazing thing is that
having kids back then for guys,

1234
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:51,490
the reason why guys stuck around was,

1235
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:51,791
you know,

1236
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:54,460
we have 401k is an IRA accounts back then.

1237
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:55,294
It's like when you,

1238
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,920
when you couldn't gather anymore,

1239
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,870
you are at the mercy of charity.

1240
00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:00,130
And so if you had a lot of kids,

1241
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,740
you had a chance of being able to
actually live into your old age.

1242
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,440
Yeah,

1243
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,630
yeah.

1244
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,500
They would take care of you.

1245
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,833
Yeah.

1246
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,800
It's also interesting too,

1247
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:12,801
because there was so much infant mortality
back then that there was a a lot of

1248
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:16,560
places where there's real good
evidence that they had fertility cults,

1249
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,390
like they were trying to figure out
ways to get pregnant more and easier,

1250
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,920
and they're just trying
to have a bunch of kids.

1251
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:23,041
Yeah.

1252
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:23,980
Because kids were,

1253
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:24,900
you know,

1254
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,100
kids tied a lot.

1255
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:26,410
Yeah.

1256
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,120
Then yeah,

1257
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,840
that died from injury and sickness and
a lot of people died from sickness,

1258
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:31,081
you know,

1259
00:35:31,081 --> 00:35:32,190
no vaccines.

1260
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,700
Right.

1261
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,960
When you just at the mercy,

1262
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,810
and then also it's the
beginning of agriculture.

1263
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,500
All these diseases are emerging that we
don't have immune systems for it because

1264
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:41,334
they're being,

1265
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,600
they're being jumped
from like they're there,

1266
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,540
they're jumping from pigs to people.

1267
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,120
They're jumping from
chickens and birds to people.

1268
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:51,480
That's where the source of most of
these pandemic diseases come from.

1269
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,280
It comes from large scale agriculture,

1270
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,300
those funky pigs all tucked
together in these little cages.

1271
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:58,500
That doesn't come for free.

1272
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,530
Like there's some demons are
being brewed in that mix.

1273
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,461
Yeah.

1274
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:02,901
Like this,

1275
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:03,360
this,

1276
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,050
what was this?

1277
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,490
What was the source of,

1278
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:06,324
um,

1279
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,710
the Spanish flu,

1280
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,860
which I think was the most
deadly epidemic in u s history.

1281
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:14,931
Oh,

1282
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:15,451
is that right?

1283
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:18,600
It was international to
was international for sure.

1284
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:22,970
I think for sure it was the most
deadly epidemic in the u s yeah,

1285
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,840
but I think he came,

1286
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,550
I don't think it came from Spain.

1287
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,820
I think I want to say it came from
somewhere around Virginia does.

1288
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,943
Is that bullshit?

1289
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,853
This is going to take time.

1290
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,843
New Jersey.

1291
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,060
I feel like it came from
some sort of farm situation.

1292
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,520
I don't know why.

1293
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,353
I

1294
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:42,931
feel like,

1295
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,170
I'm guessing no surprises.

1296
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,820
Not more of that now because you see some
of these like pig farms and they have

1297
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:48,654
links.

1298
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,640
There are lakes of waste.

1299
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,960
Have you seen the drone footage?

1300
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,920
Is that what we're talking about?

1301
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,091
Oh my God.

1302
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:55,350
Some guy fluid,

1303
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:55,590
you know,

1304
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,150
cause they have these ag gag laws,

1305
00:36:57,151 --> 00:37:00,330
which apparently one of
them just got shot down a,

1306
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,710
somebody sent me an email

1307
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:07,020
that when maybe it was Idaho or Iowa,

1308
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:07,681
one of those places.

1309
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:08,000
One was,

1310
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,780
I states that uh,

1311
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,800
the,

1312
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,633
uh,

1313
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,160
ag gag laws got shut down to ag.

1314
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:15,060
Gag laws are safe.

1315
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:19,200
You are working in a slaughterhouse
and you saw horrific conditions.

1316
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,670
You got your cell phone out,

1317
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,510
you filmed it,

1318
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,890
you could get prosecuted,

1319
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,270
you would go to jail,

1320
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,720
you could be sued because
if physically walking,

1321
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,500
all of those documentaries that came out,

1322
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,180
well it's,

1323
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,460
they,

1324
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,880
I think those ag gag laws existed as soon
as they figured out that people could

1325
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:33,714
film thing.

1326
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,231
You know,

1327
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:36,900
because a few people released
videos of her and it looked,

1328
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,540
those ag gag laws kept,

1329
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,440
you know,

1330
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,560
kept people from talking
about a lot of creepy shit.

1331
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,760
Like this video,

1332
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,050
if you see this video,

1333
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:50,310
this guy decided since no one's going
to give him access to film the place

1334
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,173
openly,

1335
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,710
she's going to fly over it.

1336
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:55,740
So he flew over with a
drone Spanish flu thing.

1337
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,401
Okay.

1338
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,031
For many years,

1339
00:37:57,031 --> 00:38:00,930
medical historians and epidemiologists
hypothesize that the outbreak could have

1340
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:04,920
started in a British
army base in ed place,

1341
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,830
France or at Fort Riley in Kansas,

1342
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,480
where the first American cases of the
new strain of flu were recorded in March

1343
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:15,030
of 1918 more recently,

1344
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:18,630
experts have experts have
proposed a third hypothesis.

1345
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:23,631
The Spanish flu originated somewhere in
northern China in late 1917 and swiftly

1346
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:28,230
move to eastern Europe within
140,000 Chinese laborers.

1347
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,030
And,

1348
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,340
uh,

1349
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,270
the French and British
governments recruited to
perform manual labor to free up

1350
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:35,710
the troops for war time duty.

1351
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,400
Wow.

1352
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,581
Yeah.

1353
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,110
I think more people died of that.

1354
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:39,790
Then they die then died in world war one,

1355
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,240
the fifth.

1356
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,650
So 50 million people

1357
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,350
were killed because of this damn,

1358
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,320
whoa.

1359
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,790
Just think about courses.

1360
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,010
A 50 million people.

1361
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,140
Well claiming.

1362
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,130
Look at this.

1363
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:52,670
It says,

1364
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:57,670
claiming more lives in a single year than
either the first world war or the four

1365
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:00,020
year long black death,

1366
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:04,640
bubonic plague outbreak that swept
Europe and Asia in the Middle Ages.

1367
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,790
And this is one that for whatever reason,

1368
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,230
people talk about the plague.

1369
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,990
They talk about the bubonic plague.

1370
00:39:11,991 --> 00:39:12,111
Look,

1371
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:12,590
everyone's story,

1372
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,090
but no one talks about the Spanish flu.

1373
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,590
Like that's a rare,

1374
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,280
it's not,

1375
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,600
it doesn't get brought up that often.

1376
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:18,650
If you see this number,

1377
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,060
this number of people die.

1378
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:23,810
50 million people in a year in a year.

1379
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:24,644
Man.

1380
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,250
People talk about how bad it is right now,

1381
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,084
but that's not what they're saying.

1382
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,900
They're saying it killed more lives in a
single year than either the first world

1383
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:34,600
war or the four year long black death.

1384
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,040
Yeah,

1385
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,620
I may have killed and he may have kept
one third of the population was sick with

1386
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:38,741
it.

1387
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:39,820
At least they didn't all die.

1388
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,650
God Damn.

1389
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,573
I mean,

1390
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,800
people think that the
world is in such bad shape.

1391
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,110
We don't have plagues.

1392
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,250
You know,

1393
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,040
there is a,

1394
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,311
the,

1395
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:54,311
the poverty rate for the average poverty
rate in the world has gone up for like

1396
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:56,380
the last 10 years.

1397
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,660
There's less poverty,

1398
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:58,061
there's less.

1399
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,070
Starvation is more education.

1400
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:00,791
You know,

1401
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:01,624
there's a lot of,

1402
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,700
there's a lot of good shit going on too,

1403
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:04,690
but just think about that.

1404
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,050
We haven't had a world war in what,

1405
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:09,190
70 years?

1406
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,183
Yeah.

1407
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,020
Yeah.

1408
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,460
It's been,

1409
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,070
it's been,

1410
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,400
wow.

1411
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,061
Not to say it,

1412
00:40:14,061 --> 00:40:15,800
not to diminish the wars
that are happening now,

1413
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:17,960
but something that really affected,

1414
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:18,680
you know,

1415
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,790
the entire population.

1416
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:22,730
I always feel like even since high
school it's always been like around the

1417
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:23,360
corner.

1418
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,193
Yeah.

1419
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,550
And when we're in high school,

1420
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:27,920
was the big fears that we're going
to go to war with the Russians.

1421
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,500
Do you remember going into the coat
room and putting your head between your

1422
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:30,980
knees?

1423
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,850
Did you have to do that?

1424
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,800
I don't think we did that
and we used to do this.

1425
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,130
We did the debt get under the desk drill,

1426
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,600
which is hilarious.

1427
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,800
Get Out of the desk.

1428
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,120
So stupid like Mitch,

1429
00:40:42,121 --> 00:40:43,390
this is a nuclear war.

1430
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,570
Do these to tell you you're going
to get on your desk like hey,

1431
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,880
as if they had some way
to alleviate our stress.

1432
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,661
Yeah.

1433
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:51,750
I know attending could get under the desk.

1434
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:52,810
Can want to give you an answer.

1435
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,913
Yeah.

1436
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,121
Yeah.

1437
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,380
Nobody knew what the fuck to do,

1438
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,510
so they just made up some nonsense.

1439
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,310
Let's get under your desk,

1440
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,383
duck,

1441
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,670
duck and cover nuclear war.

1442
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,400
That linoleum is going to save your life.

1443
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:06,850
Yeah.

1444
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:07,331
Look at this.

1445
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,081
This is the drill.

1446
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:09,910
All these little kids
underneath the tables.

1447
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,120
What a fucked up thing
to put in a kid's head,

1448
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:13,840
man.

1449
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,740
Just stop and think about how close we
were to doing something so stupid that

1450
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,420
this could have become a reality.

1451
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,340
And how now think about how this is a
reality in certain parts of the world.

1452
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,203
Like in,

1453
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,091
in our place,

1454
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:28,924
it's not,

1455
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,490
but in other places it is.

1456
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,473
Yeah.

1457
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,403
And that's,

1458
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,440
that's their life.

1459
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,653
I mean,

1460
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,730
especially when it comes to
things like drone warfare,

1461
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,650
that freaks me out.

1462
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,151
I know.

1463
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:42,980
It's very effective at shooting terrorist.

1464
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:43,251
I know.

1465
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:43,581
It is.

1466
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:43,821
I know.

1467
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:44,391
It's excellent.

1468
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:46,910
It's also super effective
at killing civilians.

1469
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,680
Super effective.

1470
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:49,961
Yeah.

1471
00:41:49,961 --> 00:41:51,250
And there's something about,

1472
00:41:51,251 --> 00:41:54,670
when you think about how we're being
perceived and the rest of the world,

1473
00:41:54,671 --> 00:41:59,560
there's something about not even being
present for the accidental killings that

1474
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:00,490
makes it just,

1475
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,043
you know,

1476
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,840
twice as bad.

1477
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,410
It just seems weird and apparently
gives him pretty severe PTSD.

1478
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,220
Yeah.

1479
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:08,640
Um,

1480
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,051
you know,

1481
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:09,331
I'm,

1482
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:12,300
I'm laughing because I'm like thinking
like that's so crazy that they don't even

1483
00:42:12,301 --> 00:42:14,820
have to be there and they're getting PTSD.

1484
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:18,080
Like just the fact that
they're doing it from a remote.

1485
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,400
Yeah.

1486
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,700
I heard that pilots
are freaking out there.

1487
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,593
Some of them.

1488
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,480
Yeah.

1489
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:22,720
I'm,

1490
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,400
by the way,

1491
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,860
this is just what I'm reading
might not even be true now.

1492
00:42:25,861 --> 00:42:27,210
I read that sensationalized,

1493
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,180
but I would imagine that would
kind of fuck with your head.

1494
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,370
Okay.

1495
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:31,791
Yeah.

1496
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:33,350
The first couple of times it'd be fun.

1497
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,920
It'd be like a video game and then you,

1498
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,270
and then we'd start to
sink in when you heard,

1499
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:39,590
when you heard the reports later.

1500
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:40,431
Yeah.

1501
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:41,264
You'd have to,

1502
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,310
so detach yourself from it that it would
be like this growing thing in the back

1503
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:47,144
of your mind.

1504
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,740
Yeah.

1505
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,990
He was just launching missiles
into apartment buildings

1506
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,190
and they're telling you it's okay.

1507
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,630
Everybody says it's okay.

1508
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,190
Yeah.

1509
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,160
This is what you're supposed to do.

1510
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:58,850
Um,

1511
00:42:58,850 --> 00:42:59,960
when I talked to,

1512
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:00,740
uh,

1513
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,870
this gentleman that I
know that was in the CIA,

1514
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,840
he said that all those
decisions are done by lawyers.

1515
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,490
How really?

1516
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:07,970
Yeah.

1517
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,350
Whether or not they do it or not do it.

1518
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:09,531
He goes,

1519
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:10,071
at the end of the day,

1520
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:15,071
lawyers are deciding whether or
not it's likely to be successful.

1521
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:16,700
What's the legal ramifications?

1522
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:17,534
He goes,

1523
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,860
when you're talking
about that kind of stuff,

1524
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:19,131
he was like,

1525
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:19,880
seriously,

1526
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,890
it's a lot of us decided by lawyers.

1527
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,370
I'm like,

1528
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:22,970
whoa.

1529
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:23,060
Yeah.

1530
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,880
Because they want to not have,

1531
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,520
if you show her operated the,

1532
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,810
the siting and

1533
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:27,860
yeah.

1534
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,161
Yeah.

1535
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:30,260
And they want to make sure that
all the ducks are in order.

1536
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,123
Yeah.

1537
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:31,731
Which I mean,

1538
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:33,290
is that better or was at worse?

1539
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,531
I mean,

1540
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:35,960
is it better to just leave
it to the generals to design,

1541
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,191
you know,

1542
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:41,600
you get this cartoonish impression of
what that would be like some general,

1543
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:43,220
like the fucking guy from Avatar.

1544
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,430
Yeah.

1545
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:45,100
Go down there.

1546
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,180
Who are going to fuck everybody.

1547
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,720
That's what everybody's worried about.

1548
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:48,130
Right.

1549
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:48,963
The character,

1550
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:49,760
the,

1551
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,730
the cartoonish out of control.

1552
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,260
Murderous soldier,

1553
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,153
right?

1554
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:56,361
Yeah.

1555
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:57,560
What was the Kubrick movie?

1556
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,011
Oh,

1557
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,060
a full metal jacket.

1558
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,690
Now the one with the,

1559
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:02,524
uh,

1560
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:05,230
Peter Sally's was in it
and it was about how I,

1561
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,230
how I something the new

1562
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:07,830
clear balm.

1563
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:08,490
Oh,

1564
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:09,420
yes.

1565
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,363
Doctor.

1566
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,503
Yeah.

1567
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,590
Like the general on that.

1568
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:12,741
Yeah.

1569
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:13,180
Yes.

1570
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:13,511
Yeah.

1571
00:44:13,511 --> 00:44:14,830
They're always like cartoonish.

1572
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,560
Yeah man.

1573
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,610
You better hope guys like
that are on your side.

1574
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:19,891
Dr. Strange off.

1575
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:21,010
That was a great movie man.

1576
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,870
It was so weird to watch it today.

1577
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:23,380
Yeah,

1578
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,580
I watched it a few years back.

1579
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:25,443
Did you really?

1580
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:25,751
Yeah,

1581
00:44:25,751 --> 00:44:28,060
like maybe four or five years
back and washed it and I was like,

1582
00:44:28,061 --> 00:44:28,601
wow.

1583
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:33,601
It's so wild to watch these
little captured moments in
time where you could see

1584
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:35,820
like people were different than,

1585
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,570
yeah,

1586
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,800
like old movies.

1587
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,390
When you watch old movies,

1588
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,500
you know what the biggest indication
that something's different is?

1589
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,150
Women didn't work out that.

1590
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:46,320
Yeah,

1591
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,550
they weren't like fit.

1592
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,710
Like we are used to seeing
a lot of actresses that are
on TV and then in movies

1593
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,920
date they all do like
crossfit or something.

1594
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:56,970
They're all working out.

1595
00:44:56,971 --> 00:45:01,920
They're all taking gymnastics or something
or they're doing spin classes and and

1596
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:04,620
they have trainers and doing
these box jumps and shit.

1597
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,690
Like girls are built now.

1598
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,710
It's a different thing.

1599
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:12,020
If you go look at like King Kong look
like Fay Wray and King Kong soft.

1600
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:12,770
They just,

1601
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:13,340
yes.

1602
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,060
They're not even picking
up their groceries.

1603
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:16,990
They're built different.

1604
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:17,681
Yeah.

1605
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:18,580
And they don't last.

1606
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,900
If they didn't do manual labor,

1607
00:45:19,901 --> 00:45:20,734
they don't last.

1608
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:23,980
Some of them do when they do,

1609
00:45:23,981 --> 00:45:24,641
it's a shock.

1610
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:25,570
Like Raquel Welch,

1611
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,840
like deep into her sixties
like Janice is still hot.

1612
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,610
So feel around right to the end.

1613
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,210
Jesus.

1614
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:31,680
Yeah.

1615
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,570
It's a few of them that
were so potent that they're,

1616
00:45:34,571 --> 00:45:36,310
they're spell lasted there.

1617
00:45:36,311 --> 00:45:41,311
Their entire existence is just started
this Jane Fonda workout stuff back in the

1618
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,640
day with the doggy thing.

1619
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,361
What was that like?

1620
00:45:43,361 --> 00:45:46,400
1970s to me.

1621
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,333
Damn,

1622
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,990
that was crazy.

1623
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,810
That was so fucking big.

1624
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,720
It was the first time women
were marketed to for exercise.

1625
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,583
I think so.

1626
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,490
I think so.

1627
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:05,490
I think before that women may be competed
in athletic events like [inaudible]

1628
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:07,240
and shit like that when they were young.

1629
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,000
But then when they probably got
families or moved on to jobs,

1630
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:10,930
they probably stopped.

1631
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,660
What does this one go?

1632
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,900
A robot championship.

1633
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,390
Oh my God.

1634
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,640
Look at this as a choreographed dance.

1635
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,830
This is so strange.

1636
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:21,660
Oh,

1637
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,151
that's right.

1638
00:46:22,151 --> 00:46:23,410
Do you remember aerobics?

1639
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,960
I'm going to take an aerobics class.

1640
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,291
Yeah,

1641
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,124
you remember that.

1642
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,021
I'll be kind of,

1643
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:30,270
that was people would just dance
around and you would do stuff,

1644
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:31,110
feel the pop,

1645
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,320
pop,

1646
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,990
pop and two and three and go,

1647
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,540
they turn everybody gay
for about five years.

1648
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:38,080
But it,

1649
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:38,913
all these guys,

1650
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:39,963
look at these guys,

1651
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,820
these guys are straight as fuck and
they don't even know they're doing gay

1652
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:43,654
stuff.

1653
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:44,351
You know?

1654
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:44,771
It's like,

1655
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:46,600
it's like when before,

1656
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,610
but he knew that Rob Halford
from Judas priest is,

1657
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:51,444
it is gay.

1658
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:56,240
He used to make everybody dress up like
him because everybody like kids that

1659
00:46:56,241 --> 00:46:58,790
were straight kids that we're
huge fans of Judas priest.

1660
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:03,910
They would wear the cap and
the jet wearing gay aesthetic
like gay biker looking

1661
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:05,250
right.

1662
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,083
Tough guys.

1663
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,930
Everybody got into it because
they loved him because Judas,

1664
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:11,430
it needed it so bad ass.

1665
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:16,230
And he's such a fucking awesome front
man that like he had straight guys

1666
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:17,820
dressing up like a gay bike.

1667
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:19,230
That's fucking hilarious.

1668
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:21,050
And then he comes out and they're all so,

1669
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:21,421
they're like,

1670
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,870
what is so confused?

1671
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,480
But he did it in a concert.

1672
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,770
Does 100,000 no,

1673
00:47:25,771 --> 00:47:26,790
I'm just saying what if he did?

1674
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,860
And they looked down and
there were actual wearing

1675
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,560
is what I like in my men.

1676
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,950
I had him on a show I did once.

1677
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:37,291
It was a,

1678
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,530
it was like to this um,

1679
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:41,140
thing for VH one called the list.

1680
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:41,591
Oh yeah,

1681
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:42,130
I did that.

1682
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:42,521
You did it.

1683
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:43,354
You did hosted it too.

1684
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:43,721
Yeah.

1685
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:44,320
Here he is.

1686
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:44,770
Look at that.

1687
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,180
I mean look at the outfit Bro.

1688
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:47,020
Seriously.

1689
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:47,480
Wow.

1690
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,750
The leather paper boy hat on.

1691
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:55,170
Or it's more like a soldier's hat and
he's got leather vest on with no shirt

1692
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:56,141
underneath.

1693
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:58,330
Leather gloves at spikes all SNM shit.

1694
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,141
Tight,

1695
00:47:59,141 --> 00:47:59,411
tight,

1696
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:00,370
tight leather pants.

1697
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:01,204
It's hilarious.

1698
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:04,510
Freddie Mercury.

1699
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,243
Yeah man.

1700
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,080
Um,

1701
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:08,913
what was my point?

1702
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:10,511
What we're,

1703
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:10,930
we're,

1704
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,270
we're talking about something right
before we were talking about that.

1705
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:13,661
Oh,

1706
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:13,841
the,

1707
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:14,061
the,

1708
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:14,894
the aerobics.

1709
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,061
They aerobics guys.

1710
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:16,181
Like,

1711
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:16,600
come on man.

1712
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,550
They had dude's wearing singles.

1713
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,413
Look at this.

1714
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,500
Look at this outfit.

1715
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:21,280
This,

1716
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,430
that's like a singlet from
wrestling but with long pants.

1717
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:24,850
Yeah.

1718
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:28,240
This is bananas that they
got man addressed like this.

1719
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,500
Look at what they're wearing.

1720
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,760
You see their nipples,

1721
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,620
like their nipples are popped out.

1722
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,500
They're all super gate out.

1723
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,000
Pick up the those three quarter
length Reebok high tops.

1724
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:40,661
Exactly.

1725
00:48:40,661 --> 00:48:42,460
What the Velcro you had to get the velcro.

1726
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,810
That's the newest technology.

1727
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,000
Yeah.

1728
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,571
So look,

1729
00:48:46,571 --> 00:48:48,580
every girl is dressed like,

1730
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:49,503
you know,

1731
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,090
I guess they look more like why
they have two different outfits.

1732
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:54,220
The girls have some of
them expose the mid drift,

1733
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,160
like the dirty girls that they are.

1734
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,340
And the other ones that
we're a a one piece,

1735
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,580
oh Alan Thicke was
hosting this motherfucker.

1736
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:04,760
Oh Shit.

1737
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,710
Course he was,

1738
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,311
oh shit.

1739
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:06,671
Look at him.

1740
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:07,390
Look at that hair.

1741
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,440
It's wonderful.

1742
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:10,630
Look at his jacket.

1743
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,970
Solve Miami vice doubt.

1744
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,211
Yeah.

1745
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,740
He's got shoulder pads.

1746
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,130
You got up,

1747
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,990
you got to get rid of the shoulder pads
back then you could have shoulder pads.

1748
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,200
And I remember having shoulder
pads and my first jacket.

1749
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,010
It's nice.

1750
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,843
It makes you look better.

1751
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,290
It isn't like a stuffed bra for a girl.

1752
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,180
It is.

1753
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:30,410
Yeah.

1754
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:31,270
It's the same thing.

1755
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:31,720
Yeah.

1756
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,320
Yeah.

1757
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,610
But how weird that people,

1758
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,930
so do you remember people
actually dressing like that
and in a class situation?

1759
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,460
Did they go to classes,

1760
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,220
dress like that grade school?

1761
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:43,300
We had uniforms and stuff.

1762
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:43,711
So no,

1763
00:49:43,711 --> 00:49:47,320
I see if I never took it aerobics class.

1764
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,170
But see if you could find video
footage of an aerobics class.

1765
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,910
If all the guys that dress like that,

1766
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,260
those dudes got punked.

1767
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:53,980
Yeah.

1768
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,870
Somebody talked him into
dressing like a dancer.

1769
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:56,470
Yeah.

1770
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,303
Yeah.

1771
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,740
And they're not showing
the kids this video.

1772
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,020
Why not?

1773
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,030
So he used to be stupid.

1774
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,690
So what if you're stupid
once you're stupid forever.

1775
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,560
Is that real?

1776
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,600
Come on.

1777
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,610
Your kids love seeing
you looking stupid tip.

1778
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,360
And you should tell him I had a mullet.

1779
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,343
They laugh.

1780
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,750
One thing that I always do when I told
my kids would do something wrong if

1781
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,700
they've done something wrong,

1782
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,020
I say I did worse,

1783
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:20,800
way worse.

1784
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,530
I did exactly what you
did and I lied about it.

1785
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,400
I always lied.

1786
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,260
My parents asked me if
I did anything wrong,

1787
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,153
always lied.

1788
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:28,100
And I'm like,

1789
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,870
I know if he did something
or you didn't do it,

1790
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:30,704
I'm not mad at you.

1791
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,070
I'm just trying to make you
not do it in the future.

1792
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:35,960
Cause I want you to learn why it's bad.

1793
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:37,980
And so I would always tell that's good.

1794
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,200
The number one thing I always do.

1795
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:39,860
Right.

1796
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,090
And I get mad sometimes.

1797
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,040
I mean it's just there's,

1798
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:42,561
there's no way.

1799
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:43,580
You can't sometimes,

1800
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,960
especially as they get older,

1801
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,590
they get upset about things and
you got who you got to calm down.

1802
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:52,910
You gotta like figure out how to calm
down and stop screaming at each other.

1803
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,890
Sisters scream at each other,

1804
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,180
you took my thing,

1805
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,073
that's fine.

1806
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,550
You gave it to me.

1807
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:58,940
No,

1808
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,350
but I can take it back and like

1809
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,550
it's amazing the pitch they can get.

1810
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,100
Cause usually when people get
that hostile to each other,

1811
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:06,580
you,

1812
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:06,911
you,

1813
00:51:06,911 --> 00:51:08,440
you're worried there's going
to be a physical fight.

1814
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,600
But sisters can take it two,

1815
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:11,411
three times.

1816
00:51:11,411 --> 00:51:12,244
That level,

1817
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,870
it makes you so uncomfortable,

1818
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,490
but then they'll cuddle with each other.

1819
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,833
Yeah.

1820
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,800
That's funny.

1821
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,410
That's suite two years.

1822
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:20,620
Yeah.

1823
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,050
It's interesting watching them evolve,

1824
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:28,320
like watching them learn new facts and
learn new things and wash their little

1825
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:30,010
brain filled with information.

1826
00:51:30,011 --> 00:51:32,470
Their vocabulary starts
growing and you're like,

1827
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:33,520
wow.

1828
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:33,870
Yeah.

1829
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:34,810
And you realize like,

1830
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,011
I mean,

1831
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:36,731
I've said this before,

1832
00:51:36,731 --> 00:51:38,140
but it bears repeating.

1833
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,990
We look at people in a static state.

1834
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:45,460
We're always looking at people like if
I see a guy and he's 40 years old and

1835
00:51:45,461 --> 00:51:46,294
he's an asshole,

1836
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:46,421
oh,

1837
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:48,250
that's that 40 year old asshole.

1838
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:49,241
That fucking guy.

1839
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:50,074
I know that guy.

1840
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,720
That guy is so annoying.

1841
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:54,730
But you don't think are that was a baby.

1842
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:55,360
Yeah.

1843
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,930
That was a baby with a bunch
of shitty data thrown out.

1844
00:51:58,931 --> 00:51:59,230
Um,

1845
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,300
a bunch of shitty interactions,

1846
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,650
bad genes,

1847
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:04,090
bad environment,

1848
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,340
maybe some alcoholism.

1849
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:06,570
Yeah.

1850
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:07,570
Maybe we give you some,

1851
00:52:07,571 --> 00:52:08,110
uh,

1852
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,320
throw it in all of it,

1853
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:09,801
right?

1854
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:11,120
The lady HD

1855
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,210
bad nutrition,

1856
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,020
throw it all in there,

1857
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:14,621
throw it all in there.

1858
00:52:14,621 --> 00:52:16,360
A bunch of bad breaks in life.

1859
00:52:16,361 --> 00:52:17,194
Throw it all in there,

1860
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:17,760
you know,

1861
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,470
and that happens to so many people.

1862
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,090
So you look at him and instead of,

1863
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:23,530
I always like,

1864
00:52:23,531 --> 00:52:24,670
look at what they are now.

1865
00:52:24,671 --> 00:52:24,930
Like,

1866
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:25,270
Oh,

1867
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,103
this guy,

1868
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,250
what they are,

1869
00:52:27,251 --> 00:52:27,851
all of them,

1870
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:30,700
including you and me is a baby.

1871
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,190
That became an older thing.

1872
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:33,971
You know,

1873
00:52:33,971 --> 00:52:38,971
and I've great deal of people whose
lives are chaotically fucked up.

1874
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:42,160
It's through no fault of their own.

1875
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,750
It's a great deal of him.

1876
00:52:43,751 --> 00:52:44,830
It's a large number.

1877
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,670
Right.

1878
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:46,503
You know,

1879
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:51,870
and as I've gotten older and tried
to be more compassionate and more,

1880
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,270
uh,

1881
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,101
more understanding,

1882
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:54,934
more patient,

1883
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:58,720
those are the things that I worked on
a lot and I still struggle with it.

1884
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,280
But um,

1885
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:01,210
it's,

1886
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,790
I don't think that's anything
you ever really totally get over,

1887
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:04,690
but you get better.

1888
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:05,050
You get,

1889
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,860
I've seen it a lot over the years here.

1890
00:53:08,861 --> 00:53:09,790
A lot more patient.

1891
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,900
Yeah.

1892
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,900
I think a lot of that has to do with
just getting better at being a person and

1893
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:17,290
then when you work on it.

1894
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:22,180
But I think also a lot of it has to
do with my change of my attitude about

1895
00:53:22,181 --> 00:53:24,050
people and that I,

1896
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,430
I started to of them as

1897
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:32,060
a product of a lot of different
interactions and that we,

1898
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:32,911
like,

1899
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:34,470
you hear the term white privilege,

1900
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,490
it's a fucked up term,

1901
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:35,910
right?

1902
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:36,743
It's weird.

1903
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,090
But you have to admit,

1904
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:44,750
if you're a person and nothing completely
catastrophic has happened to you and

1905
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:50,120
you became this 50 year
old successful comedian,

1906
00:53:50,121 --> 00:53:52,380
it's an Emmy award
winning writer and like,

1907
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,400
Yay,

1908
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,660
bad things happen to you.

1909
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:55,380
Right.

1910
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,650
But they could have
been fucking way worse.

1911
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,330
It could've been way worse.

1912
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:03,840
And for some people it
is fucking way worse.

1913
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:09,200
They just got a shit roll of the dice
from the jump and it's been bad experience

1914
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:15,441
after bad experience and fucking abuse
and violence in jail and the that you

1915
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:17,281
can't get out.

1916
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:18,031
There's no way out.

1917
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:19,110
You can't even read.

1918
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:19,570
She's like,

1919
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:22,860
you're frothing around at sea
trying to keep your head above water

1920
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:27,300
and you run into them when
they're 32 at a gas station.

1921
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,970
And it's as much,

1922
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,130
it's a,

1923
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:32,490
I mean,

1924
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:37,350
it's not saying it's not their fault
because whenever someone does anything to

1925
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:37,680
you,

1926
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,520
it's their fault.

1927
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:40,620
Like if someone commits violence on you,

1928
00:54:40,621 --> 00:54:41,700
they shouldn't have done that.

1929
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:42,380
It's their fault.

1930
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,213
That's agreed.

1931
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,970
But what were the underlying
factors that led this to happen?

1932
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,820
And for all this talk that
we do in this country about,

1933
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,211
uh,

1934
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:57,540
about violence and crime and the
problem of violence and crime,

1935
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,420
nobody ever looks at it in terms of like,

1936
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:05,160
how do you stop children from
being raised fucked up in violent?

1937
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,380
How do you stop them from being abused?

1938
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,420
How do you step in you that?

1939
00:55:09,421 --> 00:55:11,040
Because that's the root of all of it,

1940
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:11,441
right.

1941
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:15,280
And I think early childhood education
can make a big difference because if you

1942
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:18,160
have a kid growing up and
you know the dad took off,

1943
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:18,720
there's no,

1944
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,080
he's living on the streets.

1945
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,210
If you can create an environment for that
four year old to come in and have two

1946
00:55:25,211 --> 00:55:26,200
decent meals,

1947
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,460
a nap time,

1948
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,170
some structured play,

1949
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,740
it makes all the difference in the world
because that can become like the family

1950
00:55:32,741 --> 00:55:33,300
to them.

1951
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,501
Now,

1952
00:55:33,501 --> 00:55:34,350
let me ask you this,

1953
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,233
cause this is the,

1954
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,230
we're in the biggest crisis
in terms of immigration,

1955
00:55:40,231 --> 00:55:41,670
in terms of national discussion.

1956
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,090
The biggest discussion of it than I can
ever remember right now at this wall,

1957
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:48,900
shit where the government is completely
shut down and no one's budging on either

1958
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:51,390
side and all these government workers
are not getting paid in psalm because

1959
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:53,220
Trump wants $5 billion for this wall.

1960
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:55,973
I'm not.

1961
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:57,263
Let's just,

1962
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,790
in an ideal world,

1963
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,840
it would be ideal if the way the world
worked was the way America works,

1964
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,250
where you can just go wherever you want.

1965
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,380
That'd be the ideal world.

1966
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,760
If the whole world was America in the,

1967
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:12,630
in the sense of you can go to New Mexico,

1968
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,550
you didn't have to get paperwork signed,

1969
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:15,450
you don't have to,

1970
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:15,630
did,

1971
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:20,250
no has to tell you whether or not you're
allowed to go visit or not go visit.

1972
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,450
He just drive there.

1973
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,330
That's,

1974
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,890
that's a nice thing about America.

1975
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:25,150
It's almost like Europe,

1976
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,530
but you don't need a passport.

1977
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,161
Not In,

1978
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:27,791
it's like Europe.

1979
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:29,710
I know you guys have been around
longer and all that good stuff.

1980
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,671
That's not what I mean.

1981
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:32,650
I mean in terms of there's
a bunch of different fields.

1982
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,570
It's all speaking one language,

1983
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:38,800
but like there's a big difference between
visiting Montana and visiting Miami.

1984
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,371
You know,

1985
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:40,600
if you go to billings,

1986
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:44,260
Montana and hang out with the local
folk at a coffee shop and then you go to

1987
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:49,210
some fucking crazy after I already after
hours party in Miami and Miami beach at

1988
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:50,820
four in the morning and p did,

1989
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:52,630
he shows up and fucking,

1990
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,081
you know,

1991
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:56,440
and there's all these celebrities and
people are doing coke on the floor and

1992
00:56:56,441 --> 00:56:56,591
like,

1993
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:58,540
what the fuck is this?

1994
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:59,950
This is a different world.

1995
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,110
It's a different world and it's a
bunch of these different worlds.

1996
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:03,400
New York City's a different world.

1997
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:03,941
You know,

1998
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:05,080
La is a different world.

1999
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,910
You're allowed to go there.

2000
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,950
Wouldn't it be great if the
whole world was like that?

2001
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:12,460
You can just kind of go wherever you want
it to go and it would all sort itself

2002
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:12,790
out.

2003
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:16,360
The idea is you can't because it would
fuck up our quality of life and would

2004
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:17,380
make us less safe.

2005
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:19,780
And I get the argument,

2006
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:22,450
certainly you don't want to
bring in criminals and murderers.

2007
00:57:22,451 --> 00:57:25,600
You don't want drug dealers making their
way into this country and starting gang

2008
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:26,740
violence and all that stuff.

2009
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:27,071
Yes,

2010
00:57:27,071 --> 00:57:28,180
you're absolutely right.

2011
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:29,050
And to deny that,

2012
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:30,490
I think it's pretty fucking foolish.

2013
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:31,751
Yeah.

2014
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:34,420
I think it's a matter of
like there's a lot to it.

2015
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,560
It's a fluid.

2016
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:38,440
The border is always going to be
fluid and it needs to be fluid.

2017
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:38,651
You know,

2018
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:43,210
we need MD immigrant spirit of coming
in and a lot of them do start small

2019
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:44,200
businesses when you know,

2020
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:44,531
and again,

2021
00:57:44,531 --> 00:57:45,820
when they're brought in legally.

2022
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,153
Um,

2023
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,700
and so how do you,

2024
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,480
how do you create a flow of
people that is good for us.

2025
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:56,200
Cause they say most of the immigrants
that come here are the smartest,

2026
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:57,250
sharpest people,

2027
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,650
most driven and wherever they're from.

2028
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,870
So we're actually drawing a really good,

2029
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,440
you know,

2030
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:02,590
be,

2031
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:06,040
they talk so much about the criminals
but the truth is most of them that are

2032
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:09,760
coming over here are the ones that
probably have the most to offer to this

2033
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:10,290
country.

2034
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,780
Well exactly like our parents' generation.

2035
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,340
Like our grandparents,

2036
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:15,420
like my grandparents.

2037
00:58:15,421 --> 00:58:16,140
Like when did your,

2038
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,340
your grandparents come over here?

2039
00:58:17,341 --> 00:58:17,720
It was

2040
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,630
grandparents are 1910 my grandparents.

2041
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:20,900
Yeah,

2042
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,733
mine as well.

2043
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:26,150
My grandfather was one of 13 and 12 of
them came over here and they lived in a

2044
00:58:26,151 --> 00:58:27,860
two room fucking mud hut.

2045
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:31,040
Somehow they kept finding the money
to send one kid over at a time.

2046
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:35,000
Like usually when there
were about 15 crazy shit.

2047
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:35,710
Yeah.

2048
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,800
See that kind of shit is
what I'm talking about.

2049
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:40,180
Like those kind of people,

2050
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,970
shouldn't they be allowed to come here?

2051
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:43,170
That's,

2052
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,680
that's how this thing got started.

2053
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:45,410
The,

2054
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:49,960
the real problem is that there are
spots that suck as the real problem.

2055
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,510
It's like we were talking
about like white privilege.

2056
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,660
White privilege is not the problem.

2057
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:53,770
The problem is racism.

2058
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,980
Racism doesn't exist in
everyone's exactly the same.

2059
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,470
And then we're okay and then we don't
need to worry about white privilege.

2060
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:01,660
What the real problem
that you're not getting.

2061
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:05,830
You're not getting racist things
thrown at you the way black people are.

2062
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:06,011
Yeah,

2063
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:06,790
for sure.

2064
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:07,720
But that's not the problem.

2065
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,090
The problem is racist things
being thrown a black people.

2066
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,800
It's not that I don't get it right.

2067
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:16,210
It's say you get it right and it's like
it took to highlight the fact that it's

2068
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:17,290
not happening to me.

2069
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,540
I get what you're saying,

2070
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:20,970
but the real pro,

2071
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,620
I think it's a distraction that the
real problem is the racism itself.

2072
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:25,510
The real problem is the,

2073
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:30,850
when you see actual Nazis
in 2018 2019 actual ones,

2074
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,710
real ones like not,

2075
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:35,600
not just dressing up cause
they think it's a hoot.

2076
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,320
We,

2077
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,400
oh mom rebel.

2078
00:59:37,401 --> 00:59:38,790
I'm fucking road.

2079
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,030
I got a piece of tape under my nose.

2080
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:42,050
The Sec.

2081
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,090
There's a fucking people
that aren't really Nazis,

2082
00:59:44,091 --> 00:59:45,260
but they're dumb here.

2083
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:45,800
Right.

2084
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,230
But then you see a real
Nazi in 2019 you're like,

2085
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:48,501
okay,

2086
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,810
that's real racism.

2087
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,673
Yeah.

2088
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,880
Now when they go into a,

2089
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,680
I was in Portland and they said there's
regular clashes like once a month

2090
00:59:58,681 --> 01:00:02,670
there's a demonstration and it's either
the alt right having a demonstration and

2091
01:00:02,671 --> 01:00:03,290
then the a,

2092
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:03,841
what do they call him?

2093
01:00:03,841 --> 01:00:08,841
The something far Antifa Antifa show up
and they have regular fights and it's

2094
01:00:08,941 --> 01:00:09,900
fucking Nazis.

2095
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,430
Goddamn.

2096
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:14,460
Oregon's a fucked up state
because it was originally,

2097
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:16,440
there were no black
people allowed in Oregon.

2098
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,160
That's the,

2099
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:17,930
that's the,

2100
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:18,180
you know,

2101
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,110
cause now Portland is,

2102
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:20,310
is very progressive,

2103
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,150
super progressive harassment,

2104
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,580
but there's no black people there.

2105
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:24,770
So it seems you,

2106
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,910
he feels a little hollow
that when you're there.

2107
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:29,530
I just did New Year's Eve
shows there and they were,

2108
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:29,941
they were,

2109
01:00:29,941 --> 01:00:32,100
it was all white.

2110
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:33,780
It was all white.

2111
01:00:33,781 --> 01:00:34,614
It was weird.

2112
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:35,910
That is weird.

2113
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:36,091
There.

2114
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:36,420
Dot.

2115
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,320
If I was black,

2116
01:00:37,321 --> 01:00:38,880
I would go to Portland and a second,

2117
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:40,890
you'd have so many friends instantly.

2118
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,780
Everybody wants to high five.

2119
01:00:42,781 --> 01:00:44,700
You have you over for dinner.

2120
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:47,641
It's,

2121
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:48,470
um,

2122
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:48,840
yeah,

2123
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,580
the real problem for sure is any kind
of discrimination cause that that also

2124
01:00:53,581 --> 01:00:55,530
fucks with us too because if,

2125
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,210
if people were discriminating
against people,

2126
01:00:57,211 --> 01:00:59,680
we can't even make fun of them now we
have to leave him alone because it's

2127
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:00,570
punching down like,

2128
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,160
but it's right there.

2129
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,480
The best joke,

2130
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:06,150
I mean when you think
about it as a standup,

2131
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:07,600
what your topics are,

2132
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:08,830
race,

2133
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:09,910
racism,

2134
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:12,160
sexuality,

2135
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:13,083
politics,

2136
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,141
it cost.

2137
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:15,460
People don't see politics.

2138
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,050
I know.

2139
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:16,210
No,

2140
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,080
I would say that the,

2141
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:19,750
the average comic is
talking about two topics,

2142
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,420
racism and sexuality.

2143
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:27,680
You did a great job of co covering
politics without actually being political.

2144
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,550
You do a great job with that,

2145
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:32,510
especially that you're,

2146
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:33,750
you're Hillary Clinton bit.

2147
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:38,363
Yeah.

2148
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,240
I,

2149
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,870
I did this thing during the election
about her and I didn't mean it to knock

2150
01:01:42,871 --> 01:01:43,141
her,

2151
01:01:43,141 --> 01:01:45,660
but it really wasn't
about knocking anybody.

2152
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,300
It was about her having
a dry pussy and you know,

2153
01:01:48,301 --> 01:01:50,790
that's the kind of political
comedy you can expect from me.

2154
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:54,780
It was also about countdown
till Trump calls her a con.

2155
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,430
That was my favorite.

2156
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:05,340
It was my favorite line
about the election.

2157
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:05,891
Dude.

2158
01:02:05,891 --> 01:02:06,521
I did the,

2159
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:09,790
I did the jokes about her and then a true,

2160
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:12,190
Carrie was in the audience and
he came up to me after the show.

2161
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:16,700
He gave me an entire piece of paper
with more jokes on that treadmill.

2162
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,550
He had tears in his eyes.

2163
01:02:18,551 --> 01:02:20,010
Like that's the thing I've ever seen

2164
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,161
here.

2165
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:20,994
Take these.

2166
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,410
He loves filth.

2167
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,650
Drew Carey is one of the nicest guys ever.

2168
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:24,941
Yeah,

2169
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:25,570
he's great.

2170
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:26,860
I met him at the Improv and dude,

2171
01:02:26,861 --> 01:02:28,000
he talks to everybody.

2172
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,670
He was given young comics advice,

2173
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,050
telling him write a joke a day.

2174
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:32,950
Just one joke a day.

2175
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:33,460
Yeah.

2176
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,450
You get one joke a day.

2177
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:35,980
That's good advice for a week.

2178
01:02:35,981 --> 01:02:36,814
You've got seven jokes.

2179
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,020
Make yourself write a joke.

2180
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:38,470
Yeah,

2181
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:39,100
that's right.

2182
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:39,370
Honey.

2183
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:40,360
Write a joke yesterday.

2184
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:41,110
Nah,

2185
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,970
I wrote some shit that wasn't funny.

2186
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,160
That's root some shit.

2187
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:45,361
Yeah,

2188
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:45,850
we did.

2189
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:47,680
You and I did the store
together last night.

2190
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:47,951
Yeah.

2191
01:02:47,951 --> 01:02:49,300
And the last night I came home wrote.

2192
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,050
Yeah.

2193
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:50,321
Yeah.

2194
01:02:50,321 --> 01:02:50,801
I'm just,

2195
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:51,240
um,

2196
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:51,470
I,

2197
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:54,920
I've in this stage of a couple of these
bits and I'm working on right now where

2198
01:02:54,921 --> 01:02:55,270
the,

2199
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,103
they're just like,

2200
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,670
they're on Bambi legs.

2201
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,020
They'll go south on me,

2202
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,420
I'll lose the script.

2203
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,313
Yeah,

2204
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,153
it's um,

2205
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:07,510
it's interesting because when you go
from doing a special and then chuck and

2206
01:03:07,511 --> 01:03:09,190
everything out and starting from scratch,

2207
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,570
it's the most fun time.

2208
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,020
Yeah.

2209
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:11,630
Cause you're like a,

2210
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:11,861
you look,

2211
01:03:11,861 --> 01:03:12,880
you're a beginner again.

2212
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,640
You thinking about it all the time.

2213
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:15,050
Yeah.

2214
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:16,770
I'd like after dinner
I've got a half hour,

2215
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:18,620
I'm like I want to get back to that bit.

2216
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:19,643
Yeah.

2217
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:19,900
Yeah.

2218
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,600
You think that you're thinking
about it all the time.

2219
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,370
Like you're thinking
about bits all the time.

2220
01:03:24,371 --> 01:03:27,070
Whereas once you have an act
together and you could do,

2221
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:27,731
you do an hour,

2222
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:28,840
20 minutes easy,

2223
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,310
then you're not thinking
about it that much.

2224
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:31,630
You're thinking about when you do it,

2225
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:32,680
are you thinking about
it when you're right,

2226
01:03:32,681 --> 01:03:32,920
but you know,

2227
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,060
thinking about it all day?

2228
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:34,471
No,

2229
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:35,650
you're tweaking it in,

2230
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:36,451
in motion.

2231
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:38,820
Like when you're on stage
and you've got the hour down.

2232
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:39,970
That's when we,

2233
01:03:39,971 --> 01:03:42,930
you and I were talking about a comedian
you just told to take a little extra

2234
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:47,190
time before they did this special and
it really is and that extra few months

2235
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:52,140
that you find emphasizing
this syllable makes the joke,

2236
01:03:52,141 --> 01:03:54,390
get an applause break
instead of just laughs.

2237
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,570
It's also one of the most
interactive art forms ever.

2238
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:01,390
Whereas you need other people to do it.

2239
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,610
You need other people to watch.

2240
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,340
There's no way I can do that without you,

2241
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:07,780
without people listening,

2242
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:08,980
the watching,

2243
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:09,670
whatever it is.

2244
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:10,061
I can't,

2245
01:04:10,061 --> 01:04:10,894
you can't do it.

2246
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:14,080
You need them because
they help you make it.

2247
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,370
Their reactions to what you're saying
tightens up what you're saying right

2248
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:18,581
there.

2249
01:04:18,581 --> 01:04:22,810
Reactions to make you throw away certain
parts of just aren't working right,

2250
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:23,891
but you think it's funny.

2251
01:04:23,891 --> 01:04:26,470
They don't think it's funny like how
many times did they not think it's funny

2252
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:29,560
before you decided that part might not
be that good when he comes to me on this

2253
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:29,831
part,

2254
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:31,150
this part seems to have fruit to it.

2255
01:04:31,151 --> 01:04:31,720
This part.

2256
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,800
This is the part that kills,

2257
01:04:32,801 --> 01:04:34,330
I didn't even expect this part to work,

2258
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,690
but this partner and become a bigger
part of the bit than the first part and

2259
01:04:37,691 --> 01:04:39,130
then weird stuff starts branching off,

2260
01:04:39,131 --> 01:04:40,930
but I don't think branches
off in front of people.

2261
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,440
Yeah,

2262
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,273
it's weird.

2263
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:42,731
No,

2264
01:04:42,731 --> 01:04:44,380
it really is interesting.

2265
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:44,590
If,

2266
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:44,890
uh,

2267
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:47,260
if you could track a
comedian writing a bit,

2268
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:50,140
a good comic who really takes
on a premise like you do,

2269
01:04:50,141 --> 01:04:54,820
like take on a thought or a philosophy
and step it out as far as it can possibly

2270
01:04:54,821 --> 01:04:56,070
go and walk,

2271
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,480
track that person doing
that set for six months,

2272
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:03,280
it can morph to where this almost nothing
left from the original premise all the

2273
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:03,850
time.

2274
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:04,180
Yeah.

2275
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:04,421
Yeah.

2276
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:07,360
Sometimes I'll take an old joke
and I'll use it as a scaffolding.

2277
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,050
Like when I'm writing
again and I've got no luck,

2278
01:05:11,051 --> 01:05:14,210
I'm trapped and I'm like [inaudible]
no way to get from this bid to a note,

2279
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,280
but not going an old joke.

2280
01:05:15,281 --> 01:05:16,510
I'm a shovel old joke in there.

2281
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,760
And then from that,

2282
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:21,040
like the little bursts
that you get out of that,

2283
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:24,280
we'll carry on and make the
s the next premise better.

2284
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:27,700
It's got a little bit more momentum to
it and now you can explore it a little

2285
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:28,653
lightheaded,

2286
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,980
a little lighthearted,

2287
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,120
little little easier,

2288
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:33,010
less tense because the new stuff,

2289
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,061
think about it.

2290
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:38,680
That fucks me up the most is that I'm not
exactly sure what's the best way to do

2291
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:38,801
it.

2292
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:42,250
So I'm thinking about while I'm saying
it instead of just being in the moment,

2293
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:43,450
right until I,

2294
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:46,150
until you can just get it to the
point where you can be in the moment,

2295
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,110
it's just clunky,

2296
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,280
but because it's clunky,

2297
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:49,570
you're nervous and because you're nervous,

2298
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,550
you're thinking about it all the time.

2299
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,540
So it becomes like this obsession.

2300
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:55,840
So if I feel like more premises
start popping up that way,

2301
01:05:55,841 --> 01:05:56,321
it's weird.

2302
01:05:56,321 --> 01:06:01,321
It's like you have this hyper focus that's
way less comfortable than being like

2303
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:06,250
having an hour and 20 down ready to film.

2304
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,750
It's way less comfortable,

2305
01:06:07,751 --> 01:06:10,990
but it's probably more productive
in terms of like creatively

2306
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:11,781
of course.

2307
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:12,320
But I always,

2308
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,101
I always think of like,

2309
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:14,510
it's like learning a new language.

2310
01:06:14,511 --> 01:06:15,650
Every time I have a new bit,

2311
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:16,340
it's like,

2312
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:20,090
how do I translate this thought
in my head into like you said,

2313
01:06:20,091 --> 01:06:20,990
what's my approach?

2314
01:06:20,991 --> 01:06:23,840
What's my strategy to
get that idea across?

2315
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,840
And so you're thinking about
that and it slows down you.

2316
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,111
Yeah.

2317
01:06:27,111 --> 01:06:28,370
You're not in the moment as much.

2318
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,280
I think I'm going to start doing
some real late night sets too.

2319
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:32,540
That's a good idea.

2320
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:34,460
When you got to do tired people,

2321
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:34,780
right?

2322
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,350
Like 13 people in the room,

2323
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,730
you got to try those,

2324
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,790
those little spots out to do.

2325
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:44,030
You can get a little too used to do and
crowds and if you're a little too used

2326
01:06:44,031 --> 01:06:45,350
to and crowds,

2327
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:48,380
what happens is people want to laugh.

2328
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:49,850
They want to laugh.

2329
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:51,230
The dare to have a good time.

2330
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:53,300
When you get at one
o'clock in the morning,

2331
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:54,740
they've already laughed.

2332
01:06:55,100 --> 01:07:00,040
They've laughed and laughed and
laughed and they've laughed for hours.

2333
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:00,650
Some of them,

2334
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:04,050
some of them get there at
nine and they stay till two.

2335
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:04,500
Yeah.

2336
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,130
They just get up to pee or another drink,

2337
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:07,911
have another seat,

2338
01:07:07,911 --> 01:07:11,900
and you're watching a crazy lineup of
comedians you get on at one o'clock in the

2339
01:07:11,901 --> 01:07:12,260
morning.

2340
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,790
I'm like the dawn Barris hour,

2341
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,020
that fucking you're,

2342
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:19,520
you're getting in front of
people that have seen everything.

2343
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,880
So if you make them laugh like that,

2344
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:24,200
that's a legit bit.

2345
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:24,980
Yeah.

2346
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:28,850
If you can get through to these people
when they've probably heard everything,

2347
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:33,230
well then it gets you in your voice more
because when there's only 15 people out

2348
01:07:33,231 --> 01:07:37,370
there versus 300 couple hours earlier,

2349
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:42,110
at 300 you're performing something
out to the back of the room.

2350
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,260
They talk about playing
to the back of the room.

2351
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:45,110
In bigger rooms,

2352
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,910
you have to be more physical,

2353
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:48,980
you have to slow down and,

2354
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:50,270
and then when you have 15 people,

2355
01:07:50,271 --> 01:07:52,410
all of a sudden you're
in your human being,

2356
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:54,050
talking to human beings voice.

2357
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:58,400
And sometimes that's where you can find
really the flow of the joke a lot better

2358
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,300
because you're not,

2359
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,830
you're not pumping it up.

2360
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,030
You're just saying it.

2361
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:02,890
Mm.

2362
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:03,560
Yeah,

2363
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,393
I agree.

2364
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,730
But I think you have to do
those larger places too,

2365
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,280
just to know how to do them.

2366
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:12,780
Like there are different things.

2367
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,130
You can do a big theater,

2368
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,110
a big theater,

2369
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:19,160
you need to be comfortable with the fact
that there's x amount of thousands of

2370
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,860
people in that room and in,

2371
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,430
unless you do a bunch of those,

2372
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,930
like you and I have done
a few of them together.

2373
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:24,800
They're fun.

2374
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,160
Yeah.

2375
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,000
But you have a time.

2376
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:30,350
There's a timing thing that's different
so you have to like wait a little

2377
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:30,741
longer.

2378
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:31,350
You can't,

2379
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:34,370
can't beat your punchlines
like one after the other.

2380
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:37,520
Like you can in a club and
the club you could just keep,

2381
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:40,420
you can keep hammering because there's
only so many people in the room.

2382
01:08:40,421 --> 01:08:42,190
It won't overpower the sound system.

2383
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,170
And that's why for so long comedy central,

2384
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,280
the mandate was always,

2385
01:08:46,281 --> 01:08:48,560
they want the special
shot in a nice theater,

2386
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:49,370
like a,

2387
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:49,731
you know,

2388
01:08:49,731 --> 01:08:53,330
1500 2000 seat or where
they can get that big,

2389
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,050
the crane camera shooting down.

2390
01:08:56,051 --> 01:08:56,810
Yeah.

2391
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:58,010
And the truth is for most,

2392
01:08:58,011 --> 01:08:58,910
including myself,

2393
01:08:58,911 --> 01:09:00,260
I'm not a theater comic,

2394
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,081
I'm a club comic.

2395
01:09:01,081 --> 01:09:06,020
So all of a sudden I shoot my special
in a room that holds 1600 people and it

2396
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:06,680
was in,

2397
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,060
I don't look back at it and go,

2398
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,890
that's exactly how I want it to be.

2399
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:10,843
Sane.

2400
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:12,230
I was slower,

2401
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,031
I was project,

2402
01:09:13,031 --> 01:09:16,700
I was bigger and it's like I would have
rather done it in a like a nice little

2403
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:17,840
400 seat club

2404
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:18,501
also.

2405
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:21,290
You weren't doing a lot of those places
so we weren't comfortable with it.

2406
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,120
Like when you do those really big places,

2407
01:09:23,121 --> 01:09:24,290
once you get comfortable with it,

2408
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:25,580
you start treating it like your club.

2409
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,180
Yeah.

2410
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:30,260
Like one of my most comfortable sets was
one of the biggest places ever did the

2411
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:31,900
Scotia Bank arena in,

2412
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,710
in Toronto at the end of my tour,

2413
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,150
but is at the end of the tour.

2414
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:38,210
The very last spot before
the Netflix special came out.

2415
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,560
So I had,

2416
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:44,670
I had been doing stand up like real
regular in these big giant ass places for

2417
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:45,860
months.

2418
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:49,760
So when I got there it felt like the
store felt like doing the main room.

2419
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:51,080
It was just a bigger main room.

2420
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:51,740
Right.

2421
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:51,951
You know,

2422
01:09:51,951 --> 01:09:52,430
you just,

2423
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,240
it was just fun.

2424
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,110
Just have a good time.

2425
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:54,830
Yeah.

2426
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:58,820
It's just doing a lot of those you got
to do 'em but you really do have to do

2427
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:00,230
the little tiny shitty ones.

2428
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,090
You've got to do those 1:00 AM spots.

2429
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:03,950
You've got to do those belly rooms spots.

2430
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:04,430
Yeah.

2431
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,180
That's a big one.

2432
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,230
The peli rooms a big one.

2433
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,450
That's him right there.

2434
01:10:07,451 --> 01:10:07,961
It is.

2435
01:10:07,961 --> 01:10:10,330
If you are not connected to them,

2436
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:12,910
they do not laugh and a few are connected.

2437
01:10:12,911 --> 01:10:15,660
It's the greatest crowd
cause there's only what,

2438
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,710
60 people in there.

2439
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:17,780
Oh,

2440
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,613
something like that.

2441
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,460
I also like doing alternative room.

2442
01:10:20,461 --> 01:10:21,770
Sometimes I go to Largo.

2443
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:24,710
How do you go up there in front
of the cool kids and you know,

2444
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:26,480
have to be a little more PC and

2445
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:30,760
you should have a fake act
that you do only for Largo,

2446
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,350
like put together.

2447
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,990
Actually I did Largo with a Whitney a lot.

2448
01:10:34,991 --> 01:10:35,650
I like Largo,

2449
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:36,483
Florida just,

2450
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,080
and Hardwick was on that show too.

2451
01:10:38,081 --> 01:10:38,530
And um,

2452
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:39,100
someone else,

2453
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:39,933
maybe Adam Ray.

2454
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:40,930
Um,

2455
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:41,201
no.

2456
01:10:41,201 --> 01:10:43,610
Adam divine and uh,

2457
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,160
it was a fun time and it was really fun.

2458
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,500
Largo is a really
interesting old place too,

2459
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:48,550
but all those,

2460
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:53,140
those are all seen things like
I would love if somebody did,

2461
01:10:53,141 --> 01:10:56,350
they put an act together that's
only for like that crowd,

2462
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:59,890
but it's like just onion ask
enough that sneaks through,

2463
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,833
you know?

2464
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:02,470
Yeah,

2465
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:02,771
right.

2466
01:11:02,771 --> 01:11:07,771
Just a really like a guy who plays
like the strongest ally possible for

2467
01:11:09,611 --> 01:11:12,250
everything for Trans Rights,

2468
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,920
gay rights rights,

2469
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:14,370
women's

2470
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,203
rights.

2471
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:18,050
It's like the ultimate ally and

2472
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:20,730
everything.

2473
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:21,810
Birkenstock whatever.

2474
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:26,811
We can do whatever you do to make them
a character and then write really good

2475
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:28,284
jokes.

2476
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:28,710
Right.

2477
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:29,431
Really good.

2478
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:31,130
Jokes like that would be
an interesting project.

2479
01:11:31,131 --> 01:11:33,030
Almost like a Burra type project.

2480
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,510
Like create an all comic who's like,

2481
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,160
who's really calculated,

2482
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,170
who's really probably
just trying to get pussy.

2483
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:40,531
Right,

2484
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:40,770
but,

2485
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:41,420
but,

2486
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:43,710
but puts together the right words,

2487
01:11:43,711 --> 01:11:44,011
you know,

2488
01:11:44,011 --> 01:11:49,011
if you don't support intersectionality
then get the fuck out of my face

2489
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:55,220
and then he should try to get laid after
every show as part of the care course.

2490
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:55,441
Yeah.

2491
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:57,990
It'd be just super sleazy
with coke and needles.

2492
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:00,390
Fucking syringes evil today

2493
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,950
he's got shaky bottles of bills.

2494
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:08,550
It takes the pussy hat off his head
and starts fucking it backstage.

2495
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:11,130
He's good flashlight for a pussyhat.

2496
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:12,570
Oh my God.

2497
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:14,850
There'll be a hilarious character.

2498
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:15,890
Because the thing

2499
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:19,100
about people is who are you really?

2500
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:22,190
And when you're like,

2501
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,390
when you talking to people,

2502
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:24,620
do you know who you are?

2503
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,040
Do you,

2504
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,450
you sure you know who you are?

2505
01:12:26,451 --> 01:12:26,661
Like,

2506
01:12:26,661 --> 01:12:29,870
are you 100% certain and cool and calm?

2507
01:12:29,871 --> 01:12:30,950
I don't think most of us are.

2508
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:36,160
Like most of us are like constantly
evolving the way we behave in think,

2509
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,580
constantly thinking about it.

2510
01:12:37,581 --> 01:12:39,260
Maybe things went wrong last night.

2511
01:12:39,261 --> 01:12:40,130
I got to stop drinking.

2512
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,720
There's always like something like,

2513
01:12:41,721 --> 01:12:41,871
oh,

2514
01:12:41,871 --> 01:12:43,010
I gotta get my ass to the gym.

2515
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:43,731
There's always something.

2516
01:12:43,731 --> 01:12:45,650
There's always something you're
trying to improve and move around.

2517
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:49,610
So if you are a person who is,

2518
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:50,541
you know,

2519
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:54,140
if you don't know exactly
where you're coming from,

2520
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:56,120
but you want to sell that,

2521
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:57,200
you know where you're coming from.

2522
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,570
He wanted people to believe you
know where you're coming from,

2523
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,150
then you,

2524
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:05,150
then you get all this momentum behind you
and you almost can't get away from it.

2525
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:06,951
You know,

2526
01:13:06,951 --> 01:13:07,784
like you're,

2527
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,751
you're like,

2528
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:09,111
you're like,

2529
01:13:09,111 --> 01:13:11,420
you see this a lot with people
that are trying to be spiritual

2530
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:16,160
or they're always trying to sell you
on the idea that they're spiritual.

2531
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,210
They're always pushing.

2532
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,140
There's,

2533
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:18,801
this is me,

2534
01:13:18,801 --> 01:13:19,190
man,

2535
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:19,790
this is me.

2536
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:20,623
Are you sure?

2537
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:21,873
Are you sure?

2538
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,420
I can think who we are.

2539
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,470
All of us is,

2540
01:13:24,471 --> 01:13:29,270
a lot of it is like who we've encountered
and how we've interacted with those

2541
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,104
people.

2542
01:13:30,770 --> 01:13:31,041
Yeah.

2543
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:32,970
And then the uniform comes along with it.

2544
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,790
And the Diet,

2545
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:36,720
there's like a whole
follow this manual that,

2546
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:37,021
you know,

2547
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:38,040
they talk about hipsters,

2548
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:38,820
which,

2549
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:39,653
you know,

2550
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:43,710
it's a pretty wide umbrella about
what kind of hipsters there are.

2551
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:48,600
But just the idea of wearing a uniform
always kind of puts me off on people.

2552
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:49,590
Like you stopped,

2553
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:53,340
you stopped growing if you're going to
put on what all the other people that you

2554
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:54,480
want to be like are wearing.

2555
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:54,921
Yeah.

2556
01:13:54,921 --> 01:13:55,760
This is the thing,

2557
01:13:55,761 --> 01:14:00,761
it's like the opinions aren't necessarily
wrong because they're your opinions.

2558
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,440
But the thing of the,

2559
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,340
the thing of any kind of ideology,

2560
01:14:04,341 --> 01:14:09,110
whether it's a hipster all ideology
or if it's a fucking conservative,

2561
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:12,010
right wing farm worker ideology,

2562
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:13,810
like when people adopt those,

2563
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,490
it's very little deviation.

2564
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:18,550
And a lot of times they're not even really
thinking entirely about what they're

2565
01:14:18,551 --> 01:14:18,970
saying.

2566
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:19,361
They just,

2567
01:14:19,361 --> 01:14:24,220
they just know what is going to get the
right positive reaction from their clan.

2568
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:24,851
Yeah,

2569
01:14:24,851 --> 01:14:25,361
I feel bad.

2570
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:25,961
My Mom,

2571
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:26,650
who is,

2572
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:26,921
you know,

2573
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,440
we grew up a pretty
liberal family in New York.

2574
01:14:29,441 --> 01:14:33,280
My Dad was in radio and he talked politics
on the air and it was pretty far left

2575
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:34,930
reading that,

2576
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:35,171
you know,

2577
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:36,970
my mom worked at the New York Times,

2578
01:14:36,971 --> 01:14:38,320
he can't get any more liberal in that.

2579
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:38,990
And so it's,

2580
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:43,990
then she moved down to Florida where
everybody watches Fox News in her building

2581
01:14:44,951 --> 01:14:48,520
and they all sit around the pool and they
fucking berate her because they don't

2582
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:49,354
agree with them.

2583
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:50,141
And I just say,

2584
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:50,951
good for you mom.

2585
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:51,640
You haven't.

2586
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,170
Because a lot of people go
down there and they were,

2587
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,510
they changed their views
because they are so,

2588
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:56,141
you know,

2589
01:14:56,141 --> 01:14:58,280
intimidated by not fitting in with the,

2590
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:00,930
it's your social group
to different country.

2591
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:03,640
Florida's different kinds
of saying American Europe,

2592
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:05,583
right.

2593
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:07,380
You go to Florida does
a different country.

2594
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:08,111
It is,

2595
01:15:08,111 --> 01:15:08,560
and it's,

2596
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,350
it's two different countries
because if not three,

2597
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:13,360
because you've got the locals,

2598
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:18,010
which I'd put them against Mississippi
and Alabama for being deep south.

2599
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,590
And then you've got the retirement people,

2600
01:15:20,591 --> 01:15:22,180
which is old Jews from New York,

2601
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,940
and then you've got the
Latino Element of Florida.

2602
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:26,230
It's V it's three different,

2603
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,800
a lot of old Italians
from New York to Oh yeah,

2604
01:15:28,801 --> 01:15:29,221
that's right.

2605
01:15:29,221 --> 01:15:30,690
All those people just as said,

2606
01:15:30,691 --> 01:15:31,740
fuck this winter.

2607
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:32,280
Yeah.

2608
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:32,980
We get Natta.

2609
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:33,361
Yeah.

2610
01:15:33,361 --> 01:15:34,130
What are we doing?

2611
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,160
And get in the boat

2612
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:39,610
can sit down as hard as
your fucking ads cunt.

2613
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,540
Get some good Italian food in Florida.

2614
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,460
Oh yeah.

2615
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:44,300
Got some good food.

2616
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:44,841
But yeah,

2617
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:45,291
you're right.

2618
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,340
The upper part of it,

2619
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:46,941
especially,

2620
01:15:46,941 --> 01:15:48,600
that's like all that I,

2621
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,630
it might as well be any
other southern state.

2622
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,470
Right.

2623
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:53,570
And then at the bottom it's Cubans.

2624
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:53,850
Yeah,

2625
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:55,140
no running shit and Miami.

2626
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,870
Miami's just international.

2627
01:15:56,871 --> 01:15:58,520
Miami is like an international city.

2628
01:15:58,521 --> 01:16:00,890
It's like an international
city that's in America.

2629
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:01,641
That'd be that.

2630
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:03,500
It's so different than Seattle.

2631
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:06,380
Like in terms of feel and like
the way you're walking around,

2632
01:16:06,381 --> 01:16:11,381
everybody's like thin and in tight clothes
and partying and fucking dancing and

2633
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,580
music is coming out of cars like,

2634
01:16:13,581 --> 01:16:14,000
whoa.

2635
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,190
Hey spaces a lot.

2636
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:16,071
Yeah,

2637
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,170
it's alive and it's going
to be under water soon.

2638
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,650
When they get a suit,

2639
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:22,130
when the moon is in certain
positions in Florida,

2640
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:24,500
it doesn't even matter
what tide is the fucking,

2641
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:27,620
if there's a high tide and no storm,

2642
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,680
they still streets still flood in Miami.

2643
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:31,850
It's getting bad.

2644
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:32,990
Is that real?

2645
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:33,823
Yeah.

2646
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:35,500
Well,

2647
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,280
here's what they gotta do.

2648
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,380
They're gotta dig under the
city and then lift it up.

2649
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:38,570
Yeah,

2650
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:39,403
that's right.

2651
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,200
Go all the way under Elon Musk.

2652
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:46,150
Use that title machine thing and you want
to put some giant metal bars and just

2653
01:16:46,151 --> 01:16:47,290
jack it up to chick,

2654
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:47,531
chick,

2655
01:16:47,531 --> 01:16:47,830
chick,

2656
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:48,041
chick,

2657
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:48,874
chick.

2658
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:52,240
He got the Italian down there.

2659
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:53,200
They do construction,

2660
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,620
but what if they do a New Orleans
deal where they put up a levee?

2661
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:57,251
Yeah.

2662
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:58,390
That's what they're gonna need to do.

2663
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:59,410
Jesus Christ.

2664
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,750
I think the problem with that though,

2665
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:06,610
what I read was that there's something
about the porous nature of the soil in

2666
01:17:06,611 --> 01:17:08,830
Miami that the waters are
going to come to the ground.

2667
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,260
Yeah.

2668
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,630
The ground under the cities of
south Florida's larceny for the IRD,

2669
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:12,970
it's largely poorest live.

2670
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:13,873
Jamie's on the ball,

2671
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,800
largely porous limestone,

2672
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:18,740
which means water will
eventually rise up through it,

2673
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:20,443
so they're fucked.

2674
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,440
They're fucked no matter what.

2675
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:22,790
Even with a levy there fucked that.

2676
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:24,950
Water's just going to get
through the ground right up.

2677
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:28,610
You know how like you're on the beach
and you could dig a hole in the sand and

2678
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:29,600
eventually you hit water.

2679
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:30,453
Yeah.

2680
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:31,940
That always freaked me out.

2681
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,331
Yeah,

2682
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:33,050
I know.

2683
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:33,883
I now

2684
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,193
wait a minute.

2685
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,280
This water under here,

2686
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:38,150
how much water?

2687
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,590
My kid was sitting in one
of those holes and I'm like,

2688
01:17:40,591 --> 01:17:42,540
you're going to get
fucking sucked underground.

2689
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:42,761
Yeah.

2690
01:17:42,761 --> 01:17:43,594
I didn't like it.

2691
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:44,620
I didn't like it.

2692
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,453
Yeah.

2693
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:48,940
I was listening to a radio
lab podcast on quicksand.

2694
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:52,570
It was really cool podcasts
because it made me think I went,

2695
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:53,560
oh yeah.

2696
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,990
Nobody worries about quicksand anymore.

2697
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,810
Is that a real thing when we kids,

2698
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:58,271
dude?

2699
01:17:58,271 --> 01:17:58,491
Yeah.

2700
01:17:58,491 --> 01:17:58,610
Yeah.

2701
01:17:58,610 --> 01:17:59,620
Quicksand is a real thing.

2702
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:00,250
Yeah.

2703
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:00,910
It's a real thing.

2704
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:03,100
You can fall into this soupy,

2705
01:18:03,101 --> 01:18:04,510
watery sandy shit,

2706
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:06,670
and if you don't try to swim out of it,

2707
01:18:06,671 --> 01:18:07,780
you try to walk out of it.

2708
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:08,763
You could drown.

2709
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,100
Yeah.

2710
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:09,933
You could die in there.

2711
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,940
People have definitely died and you
might not even get out if you try to swim

2712
01:18:12,941 --> 01:18:13,360
out,

2713
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,560
but that's how you handle it.

2714
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:16,450
You handle it the same
way you handle water,

2715
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,700
and if you try walking through it,

2716
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:19,140
yeah,

2717
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:20,900
like people just get
sucked into the Merck.

2718
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:21,341
I mean,

2719
01:18:21,341 --> 01:18:21,461
if you,

2720
01:18:21,461 --> 01:18:21,940
if you,

2721
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:22,541
if you think about it,

2722
01:18:22,541 --> 01:18:25,990
there's like a certain amount of
density to what you need to stand on.

2723
01:18:25,991 --> 01:18:26,261
Right.

2724
01:18:26,261 --> 01:18:27,220
That's why mud,

2725
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,061
it's not hard.

2726
01:18:28,061 --> 01:18:28,830
You use,

2727
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:30,910
you just go in there and
you can get really stuck.

2728
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:31,570
Right.

2729
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:31,781
Well,

2730
01:18:31,781 --> 01:18:33,670
if it's more watery than that,

2731
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:34,750
then what happens?

2732
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:37,690
Well then you can't even stand then you

2733
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:40,210
people just panicked.

2734
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:41,140
Wow.

2735
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:41,910
Yeah.

2736
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:42,743
You've got to swim.

2737
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:43,593
Yeah.

2738
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,433
If you can,

2739
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,790
because there's all
this weight on you too.

2740
01:18:45,791 --> 01:18:47,530
You have to realize
that that stuff's dense.

2741
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:48,581
So it's watery,

2742
01:18:48,581 --> 01:18:51,430
but it's also heavy and then
your clothes are covered in it.

2743
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:51,850
Yeah.

2744
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,530
So your clothes become really heavy

2745
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:55,920
and so nobody can save you
because if they get close,

2746
01:18:55,921 --> 01:18:56,754
they're going to fall in.

2747
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,593
Yes.

2748
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,070
Yeah.

2749
01:18:58,070 --> 01:18:58,440
If,

2750
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:58,921
if they,

2751
01:18:58,921 --> 01:18:59,370
you know,

2752
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:00,660
if you're going to drag them down,

2753
01:19:00,661 --> 01:19:01,210
man,

2754
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:01,400
they,

2755
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,670
it's hard to swim with somebody.

2756
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:04,320
You know that as well as anybody.

2757
01:19:04,321 --> 01:19:05,190
You saved somebody.

2758
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:06,500
Yeah.

2759
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,450
I was in Costa Rica and uh,

2760
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,740
we were down at this Ga,

2761
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:10,371
this water,

2762
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:11,930
it was the biggest
waterfall I've ever seen.

2763
01:19:11,931 --> 01:19:15,590
It was like hundreds of feet high
and Atlanta did in this lagoon,

2764
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,840
this round lagoon and the water,

2765
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,790
they told you don't go near the water.

2766
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:22,730
And so there's these Japanese
girls sitting on the edge,

2767
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:27,500
they got their feet in and then one of
them like jumps in and the water fucking

2768
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:29,690
sucks her down immediately.

2769
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,200
And I dove owl,

2770
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:31,701
I have,

2771
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:35,270
I have a lifeguarding to Greg
from when I was stoned and 16.

2772
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:39,680
And so I dove into the water and I grabbed
her and luckily I was checking them

2773
01:19:39,681 --> 01:19:41,300
out because they were
these beautiful Japanese,

2774
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,250
so I had my eyes on them.

2775
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,091
And uh,

2776
01:19:44,091 --> 01:19:45,530
so I dive in and I grabbed,

2777
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,810
I grabbed her and I
pulled it to the surface.

2778
01:19:47,811 --> 01:19:50,420
I do the cross arm carry and
I've pulled our polar out.

2779
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:52,640
And you know what she did just turned,

2780
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:53,690
turned to her friends.

2781
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:54,950
They all like console there.

2782
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,120
Nobody said thank you,

2783
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:57,320
I fucking saved her life.

2784
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,040
So anyway.

2785
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:58,790
Wow.

2786
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:01,340
So there was these kids and if
ever you are jumping these lady,

2787
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:02,323
how rude,

2788
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,251
how bad?

2789
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:06,260
A little shoddy got tall Japanese,

2790
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:06,960
Japanese,

2791
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,060
I think she was Japanese.

2792
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:08,270
No,

2793
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:08,430
no,

2794
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,151
they were Japanese.

2795
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:09,670
Japanese,

2796
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:10,050
yeah.

2797
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,850
She probably thought you were a lifeguard.

2798
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:12,480
Yeah.

2799
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,530
Probably thought that's what happened.

2800
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:13,980
Yeah.

2801
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:14,431
And then I,

2802
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:16,950
and then I left and I'm
with my family and uh,

2803
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:18,090
they didn't see it happen,

2804
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,190
so I was so fucking bummed.

2805
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:22,110
Then we get to the parking lot and uh,

2806
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:26,400
there's this busload of kids from some
school and they had seen the whole thing

2807
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:28,340
and they started chanting hero

2808
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:29,293
to me.

2809
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:30,530
My kids.

2810
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:32,270
Do you fucking see what's
happening right now?

2811
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,430
That's gotta be a great feeling.

2812
01:20:37,431 --> 01:20:38,800
Even if they didn't say thank you,

2813
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:39,830
saved him.

2814
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,200
I like,

2815
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,031
it's what I do.

2816
01:20:41,031 --> 01:20:42,740
It's my job superhero.

2817
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,630
You ever save anybody's life?

2818
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:45,470
No,

2819
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:46,303
I don't think so.

2820
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:47,961
Not,

2821
01:20:47,961 --> 01:20:48,794
not directly.

2822
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:50,800
Maybe you did this podcast.

2823
01:20:50,801 --> 01:20:51,634
Probably did directly.

2824
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,390
I bet there's people that have been
suicidal that heard this and the cheer and

2825
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:55,040
the mob

2826
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,970
ruined a few people too.

2827
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:57,853
Let's be honest.

2828
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:03,493
I do,

2829
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:04,341
don't listen to me.

2830
01:21:04,341 --> 01:21:05,174
I'm a fucking idiot.

2831
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:06,710
What are you listening to me?

2832
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,780
Because when people say
I changed their life,

2833
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:12,231
I was like,

2834
01:21:12,231 --> 01:21:12,650
okay,

2835
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:14,780
if I accept it on the positive,

2836
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:16,370
then I have to accept
it on the negative too.

2837
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:16,950
That's right.

2838
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:17,121
No,

2839
01:21:17,121 --> 01:21:17,271
no.

2840
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:17,960
You did it.

2841
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:18,890
You did the whole thing.

2842
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:21,950
You might've heard I said
some shit that you enjoyed.

2843
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:22,700
Um,

2844
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,970
I'm very happy for that and I talked to
some people that brought you some great

2845
01:21:25,971 --> 01:21:26,511
information.

2846
01:21:26,511 --> 01:21:27,650
I'm very happy for that too.

2847
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:28,850
We're all in this together.

2848
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,950
I'm not saving anybody.

2849
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:30,620
Yeah,

2850
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,453
save yourself.

2851
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,140
Don't listen to me.

2852
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:33,650
Yeah,

2853
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:34,490
call a hotline.

2854
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,151
Don't listen.

2855
01:21:35,151 --> 01:21:35,330
Make,

2856
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:35,991
don't take yoga.

2857
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:36,650
Don't even do it.

2858
01:21:36,650 --> 01:21:37,061
Don't take it.

2859
01:21:37,061 --> 01:21:37,894
Go.

2860
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:38,840
Don't want us to me.

2861
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,180
I don't.

2862
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:39,411
Fuck.

2863
01:21:39,411 --> 01:21:40,970
I'm talking about don't pick up archery.

2864
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:41,780
What the fuck do you want to do?

2865
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:42,920
You want to shoot arrows at things?

2866
01:21:42,921 --> 01:21:43,150
Game.

2867
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:44,180
Fuck out your carbs.

2868
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,260
Eat some fucking carbs.

2869
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,280
Don't do Jujitsu.

2870
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,060
You're going to get hurt.

2871
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:47,893
You don't want to get hurt.

2872
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,210
Your 40 year old man,

2873
01:21:50,211 --> 01:21:51,860
we trying to choke people for stop it.

2874
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:52,993
Don't listen to me.

2875
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:53,270
Yeah,

2876
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:54,080
don't eat elk.

2877
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,100
Go Get a burger.

2878
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,230
But we had an actual American hamburger.

2879
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:58,280
Don't eat mushrooms.

2880
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:58,931
Get outta here.

2881
01:21:58,931 --> 01:22:00,140
Going to close your mind off.

2882
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,033
Break your head.

2883
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,001
They're going to break your head.

2884
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,830
What if you go crazy like
that guy from pink Floyd?

2885
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:06,200
What if you go crazy?

2886
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:07,640
What if you never come back?

2887
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:09,981
What did he get?

2888
01:22:09,981 --> 01:22:11,270
Antisemetic is a judo,

2889
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:17,060
but the thing is what if you do like for
sure some people have smoked too much

2890
01:22:17,061 --> 01:22:18,770
pot and blown a fucking gasket.

2891
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,140
Yeah,

2892
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,000
let's be honest.

2893
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:21,090
Right.

2894
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:21,890
It has to have happen.

2895
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:24,200
They say that actually they're finding,

2896
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:26,030
my wife just told me this yesterday,

2897
01:22:26,031 --> 01:22:30,410
she read this article about people with
schizophrenia are getting older and

2898
01:22:30,411 --> 01:22:33,790
they're smoking pot more
because it's legal and uh,

2899
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:38,830
they're finding people are coming in with
a schizophrenia episodes from smoking

2900
01:22:39,531 --> 01:22:40,320
too much pot

2901
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,530
that worst gets a phrenic already or
became schizophrenia from the pot.

2902
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:45,543
Not sure.

2903
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,900
I think when you,

2904
01:22:46,901 --> 01:22:48,550
especially when you get too high,

2905
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:50,800
it feels exactly like being crazy.

2906
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:51,610
Yeah.

2907
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:53,170
And I think when,

2908
01:22:53,171 --> 01:22:53,670
uh,

2909
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:58,420
there's been moments for sure that I
smoke too much pot and I freaked the fuck

2910
01:22:58,421 --> 01:22:59,110
out.

2911
01:22:59,110 --> 01:22:59,681
And uh,

2912
01:22:59,681 --> 01:23:01,480
when that happens,

2913
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,880
it almost always feels like,

2914
01:23:03,881 --> 01:23:04,151
wow,

2915
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:05,950
if I had to live like this,

2916
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,500
and it's one of the things that I
tried to take any consideration when I,

2917
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:12,250
when I think about people having
something wrong with the way their brain

2918
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:17,251
processes information or the way they
talk is like thinking about how you feel

2919
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:21,400
when you're on like a 200
milligram edible and you're like,

2920
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:21,791
oh my God,

2921
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:22,630
I just can't do this.

2922
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:23,411
This is just too much.

2923
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:27,700
Everything is anxiety and the freak
out and life and death and all of your

2924
01:23:27,701 --> 01:23:31,430
memories pouring back into your head
like a waterfall and you can't collect

2925
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:32,261
circles.

2926
01:23:32,261 --> 01:23:37,261
They're spinning plates and all
you want is for it to end please.

2927
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:38,940
And a lie down here.

2928
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,540
I hear when you take a shower,

2929
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:42,310
it helps you get in the shower.

2930
01:23:42,311 --> 01:23:47,311
You still freaked out if that was your
whole life and you got to think what is,

2931
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:48,430
uh,

2932
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:51,310
what's your state of consciousness
versus another person's?

2933
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:52,240
You have to guess.

2934
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:53,170
I don't,

2935
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:54,730
I've never been in your mind.

2936
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:56,290
I don't know how your mind works.

2937
01:23:56,291 --> 01:24:00,370
I have to guess that your
mind is some reasonable.

2938
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,820
It's got something like
the way my mind works,

2939
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:06,160
the way you look at life and
we talk about so many things.

2940
01:24:06,161 --> 01:24:07,510
We agree on so many things.

2941
01:24:07,511 --> 01:24:09,520
I've got to think you're
processing is very similar to mine,

2942
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,820
but there's gotta be people
out there where it's chaos,

2943
01:24:12,821 --> 01:24:14,830
where it's just like you would
the 200 milligram edible.

2944
01:24:14,831 --> 01:24:16,660
You just like fuck all day.

2945
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:17,201
It's just so like,

2946
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:17,500
what,

2947
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,550
who's who's doing that?

2948
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:19,121
You know,

2949
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:19,691
people do.

2950
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:22,750
Just people watching the man from the
is a building near us and just people

2951
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:23,584
watching me like,

2952
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:24,790
and they can't escape,

2953
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:26,020
can escape the Kennys can't,

2954
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:31,050
they're trapped in this is fucking
constant snow ball effect of anxiety and

2955
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,001
chaos.

2956
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:34,660
And,

2957
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:35,680
and you've got a wondered like,

2958
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:36,280
what,

2959
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,960
how much of that is brain chemistry?

2960
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:42,460
How much of that is brain chemistry
that's been adjusted by nature and by life

2961
01:24:42,461 --> 01:24:46,210
experiences and abuse and
all these different factors
that happen to people that

2962
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:48,730
make them lose their grip?

2963
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:49,703
All right.

2964
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:50,420
So yeah,

2965
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,310
I mean you see them on
the street and he just,

2966
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:52,460
he,

2967
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:52,761
you know,

2968
01:24:52,761 --> 01:24:54,950
there's a woman that is near my house.

2969
01:24:54,951 --> 01:24:59,951
She's at a bus stop and she's been at
this bus stop for three years and I have

2970
01:25:00,501 --> 01:25:00,981
never,

2971
01:25:00,981 --> 01:25:03,530
and I pass her two or three
times a day and I check,

2972
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:06,950
I'm kind of obsessed with checking
on her every time I drive by.

2973
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:08,293
And uh,

2974
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,770
she's never not been in
that bus stop sitting down.

2975
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:16,580
She's either reading or
just under a blanket.

2976
01:25:16,581 --> 01:25:17,660
She's chain smokes.

2977
01:25:17,661 --> 01:25:19,190
I don't know where she gets a cigarettes.

2978
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,240
She's got a cell phone.

2979
01:25:20,241 --> 01:25:21,680
Don't know how she charges it,

2980
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,080
but I guess she goes to the
bathroom at the gas station.

2981
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:24,740
Maybe.

2982
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,210
Maybe people give her money and she goes,

2983
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:27,290
doesn't beg,

2984
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:28,250
doesn't engage,

2985
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:29,120
just sits at this.

2986
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:30,080
And it's a,

2987
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:30,420
there's a,

2988
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:33,080
she's in front of a gas
station and a busy road.

2989
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:33,940
It's,

2990
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:36,500
it's the worst spot to say pouring rain.

2991
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:38,940
She's out there cold winter.

2992
01:25:38,941 --> 01:25:39,980
She's out there.

2993
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,240
It's crazy.

2994
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:42,283
Wow.

2995
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:43,650
Does the,

2996
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:44,483
um,

2997
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,820
bus stop have a cover?

2998
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:47,123
Yeah.

2999
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:48,120
But not,

3000
01:25:48,121 --> 01:25:48,601
not like,

3001
01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:49,150
uh,

3002
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:50,560
the sides are not there.

3003
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:52,320
So on driving rain,

3004
01:25:52,321 --> 01:25:52,561
it's,

3005
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:53,040
you know,

3006
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:53,581
so she's just,

3007
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:54,390
she's soaked.

3008
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,223
Yeah.

3009
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,680
And you see her talking to
herself a little bit and
you just think Jesus Christ.

3010
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:00,360
And so I looked her up online,

3011
01:26:00,361 --> 01:26:03,270
I researched her and it
turns out she's from Venice.

3012
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:06,050
She went to Venice high and she's got,

3013
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,470
she's got parents in the neighborhood
and they know she's there.

3014
01:26:09,471 --> 01:26:10,670
They can't get her to leave.

3015
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:14,800
Social workers come by and they
just realized she's happy there.

3016
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:15,071
You know,

3017
01:26:15,071 --> 01:26:15,681
we're not happy,

3018
01:26:15,681 --> 01:26:16,880
but she's safe there.

3019
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:21,170
Something about that spot maybe cause
it's like the busiest spot round.

3020
01:26:21,171 --> 01:26:22,430
It makes her feel safe.

3021
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,330
Wow.

3022
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:24,163
Yeah.

3023
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:27,290
Imagine that your kid,

3024
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,730
I know.

3025
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:30,443
Yeah.

3026
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:35,150
As you kid blows a gasket and you've
got to let go at a certain point.

3027
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,103
Fuck.

3028
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:39,690
You can't make them take their medication
after the age of 18 and for some

3029
01:26:39,691 --> 01:26:43,110
reason a lot of schizophrenia don't like
taking their medication because of the

3030
01:26:43,111 --> 01:26:44,010
way it makes them feel.

3031
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:45,840
God dammit man.

3032
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:48,370
What are the other options?

3033
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,260
Yeah,

3034
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:52,170
well I think lithium has the main drug
and then there's a couple other ones that

3035
01:26:52,171 --> 01:26:52,740
work.

3036
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:57,200
Is there any behavioral
therapy or physical therapy?

3037
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:57,601
Oh yeah,

3038
01:26:57,601 --> 01:26:58,380
definitely.

3039
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,100
Yeah.

3040
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,930
I think it's about replacing thoughts.

3041
01:27:00,931 --> 01:27:02,580
It's cognitive behavioral therapy.

3042
01:27:02,581 --> 01:27:03,031
They have to,

3043
01:27:03,031 --> 01:27:04,620
when they start thinking something,

3044
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:08,190
they have to replace it with another
thought and they have to train in that

3045
01:27:08,191 --> 01:27:09,790
until they can stop the,

3046
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:10,771
the voices.

3047
01:27:10,771 --> 01:27:11,150
But I,

3048
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:13,470
but I think it's mostly medication.

3049
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:14,543
Yeah.

3050
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:15,210
It's,

3051
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:18,910
I think we have an aversion
to treating the brain.

3052
01:27:18,911 --> 01:27:21,180
The say when we treat other
things that get broken.

3053
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:21,750
Yeah.

3054
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:22,580
Like a,

3055
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:22,900
you know,

3056
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:23,733
a few,

3057
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:24,860
okay,

3058
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:26,150
you have something wrong with your liver.

3059
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,380
They go,

3060
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:27,651
Oh,

3061
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:28,850
you've got liver disease.

3062
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:29,260
Well,

3063
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,040
we're going to give you
medication for the liver.

3064
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,420
Or there's something
wrong with your brain,

3065
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:33,254
like are you sure?

3066
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:35,180
You sure the sunrise brain,

3067
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:36,543
you know what's wrong,

3068
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:37,430
right?

3069
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,860
Like your brain's really not
producing enough chemicals.

3070
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:40,694
Is that it?

3071
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:42,980
Or is it just the way you look at things?

3072
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:44,240
They look at it as a weakness.

3073
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:44,660
Yeah.

3074
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:45,020
That's all.

3075
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:45,890
This is a weakness.

3076
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,753
Yeah.

3077
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:47,960
That's a weird thing.

3078
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:50,090
It's a weird thing
because sometimes it is,

3079
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:52,010
sometimes people are weak,

3080
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:54,290
but sometimes that's not it.

3081
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,910
Sometimes there's something wrong.

3082
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:56,360
Yeah.

3083
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,510
And so if you are a person who's got
something wrong and people were telling

3084
01:27:59,511 --> 01:27:59,601
you,

3085
01:27:59,601 --> 01:28:00,434
you just week,

3086
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:01,400
they're like,

3087
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:01,561
no,

3088
01:28:01,561 --> 01:28:01,601
no,

3089
01:28:01,601 --> 01:28:01,820
no.

3090
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,140
This is fucked up.

3091
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,430
Like this is this.

3092
01:28:04,431 --> 01:28:07,970
This is a terrible feeling and
this is everyday for me all day.

3093
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:08,360
Yeah.

3094
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,920
There's just something
wrong going on in there.

3095
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:14,030
Like it has to be that there's
variables to the way your brain works.

3096
01:28:14,031 --> 01:28:14,570
Just why.

3097
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:18,590
Like there's variables to the way your
eyes function or any other part of your

3098
01:28:18,591 --> 01:28:19,090
body.

3099
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:19,480
This is very,

3100
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:19,620
I mean,

3101
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:20,240
it just,

3102
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,320
it's not equal.

3103
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,880
Everybody doesn't get the same dose.

3104
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:23,251
Right.

3105
01:28:23,251 --> 01:28:23,461
I mean,

3106
01:28:23,461 --> 01:28:25,590
depression is something that,

3107
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:28,320
it's funny because I think I've asked
you and you don't have depression.

3108
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:29,010
And My,

3109
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:29,430
my,

3110
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,750
my buddy Mike Givens,

3111
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:34,770
he's my best friend and we connect
like you and me on everything.

3112
01:28:34,771 --> 01:28:37,620
But I have so much
fucking depression that I,

3113
01:28:37,621 --> 01:28:38,850
I deal with it every day.

3114
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:39,420
Yeah.

3115
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:39,751
You know,

3116
01:28:39,751 --> 01:28:40,291
and I can't,

3117
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:41,340
I have to meditate.

3118
01:28:41,341 --> 01:28:42,510
I got an exercise.

3119
01:28:42,511 --> 01:28:43,230
I,

3120
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:43,590
I'm,

3121
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:44,423
you know,

3122
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,940
medicate everything.

3123
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,071
Do you,

3124
01:28:48,071 --> 01:28:48,580
um,

3125
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:48,941
what the,

3126
01:28:48,941 --> 01:28:49,240
well,

3127
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,350
while you're injured right now,

3128
01:28:50,351 --> 01:28:51,161
you can't work out.

3129
01:28:51,161 --> 01:28:51,550
Right,

3130
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:51,940
right.

3131
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:54,090
And then does that affect you when you,

3132
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:55,053
the to help you?

3133
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:55,241
Yeah.

3134
01:28:55,241 --> 01:28:57,190
I've been in a Rut with not exercising.

3135
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:58,870
When you do exercise a lot,

3136
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,381
does it,

3137
01:28:59,381 --> 01:28:59,670
uh,

3138
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:01,800
alleviate your symptoms and your feel?

3139
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:02,190
Very

3140
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:02,521
much.

3141
01:29:02,521 --> 01:29:02,940
Really?

3142
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:03,630
Yeah.

3143
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:04,463
Yeah.

3144
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:05,640
I'm doing this thing now.

3145
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:09,450
I think Neil Brennan recommended
it and a magnet thing.

3146
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,020
Yeah.

3147
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:10,853
TMS,

3148
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,290
transcranial magnetic stimulation.

3149
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:13,500
Yeah.

3150
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,251
He said it was amazing.

3151
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:15,390
I've done it for 10 weeks.

3152
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:16,500
Every single day.

3153
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,220
Really?

3154
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:17,491
Yeah.

3155
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:18,420
Just did it this morning.

3156
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,680
Do you do it to yourself?

3157
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:20,041
No.

3158
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:20,910
You go in first,

3159
01:29:20,911 --> 01:29:23,100
you get an Mri and they
map out your brain.

3160
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:28,370
And the whole theory behind it is that
they can use magnetic stimulation to sort

3161
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:32,160
of like waking up one of the lobes
in your brain that's associated with

3162
01:29:32,161 --> 01:29:32,994
depression.

3163
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:37,260
And so you go in and first they map out
your brain and then you go in and for

3164
01:29:37,261 --> 01:29:38,250
like a half hour,

3165
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:42,870
they just pulse this magnetic
thing onto your head.

3166
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:43,711
It's like,

3167
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:46,080
I'll very low grade MRI almost.

3168
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:47,731
And uh,

3169
01:29:47,731 --> 01:29:50,970
I've had amazing results
and it lasts forever.

3170
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,241
You know,

3171
01:29:51,241 --> 01:29:53,040
you go through this cycle of it and then,

3172
01:29:53,041 --> 01:29:53,260
uh,

3173
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:53,790
he's,

3174
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,320
Neil said the same experience.

3175
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,130
That's crazy.

3176
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:56,550
Yeah.

3177
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:57,990
Highly won't last forever.

3178
01:29:58,130 --> 01:29:58,570
Yup.

3179
01:29:58,570 --> 01:30:00,900
Well they say some people
have to come in and,

3180
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:01,501
you know,

3181
01:30:01,501 --> 01:30:01,890
get a,

3182
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:02,723
get a tune up.

3183
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:04,860
But generally it's one time,

3184
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:06,000
um,

3185
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,350
there's a woman named cats and gone,

3186
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:07,531
oh,

3187
01:30:07,531 --> 01:30:10,950
she's one of the UFC top
bantamweights and she,

3188
01:30:10,951 --> 01:30:11,460
uh,

3189
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:15,450
fought UFC champion Amanda Nunez back
in the day and actually beat her before

3190
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:16,284
she won the title.

3191
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,420
But in that fight she got hurt real bad.

3192
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:22,590
And she talked about it on the podcast
that she developed a bunch of brain

3193
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:24,120
issues after that fight.

3194
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,600
Cause like her cortisol levels
were all fucked up at homeless.

3195
01:30:27,601 --> 01:30:28,500
We're all fucked up.

3196
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,210
She developed thyroid problem.

3197
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:31,223
She had hit in the head.

3198
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:32,543
She is,

3199
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:34,170
yeah.

3200
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:35,430
She couldn't keep weight off.

3201
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:36,930
Just trying to figure out what
the fuck is wrong with her.

3202
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:38,970
And one of the things
that helped her the best,

3203
01:30:38,971 --> 01:30:42,540
she talked about it really openly
and in depth on the podcast.

3204
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:44,820
But one of the things that helped
her the best was they have this,

3205
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:48,660
I think it's a different kind of
magnetic therapy then this one,

3206
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:50,120
cause I think this is only,

3207
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:55,370
the center only exists around San Diego
and a lot of military guys come back and

3208
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:56,340
use it.

3209
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:57,180
Football players,

3210
01:30:57,181 --> 01:31:00,270
people with head injuries and someone
recommended it to her and it helped her.

3211
01:31:00,271 --> 01:31:00,911
Tremendous.

3212
01:31:00,911 --> 01:31:01,470
Yeah.

3213
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:02,520
Really brought it back.

3214
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:03,241
Yeah.

3215
01:31:03,241 --> 01:31:05,640
There's some real breakthroughs
going on because um,

3216
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:06,181
you know,

3217
01:31:06,181 --> 01:31:07,150
people are and they,

3218
01:31:07,151 --> 01:31:07,530
they,

3219
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:07,771
you know,

3220
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:11,250
they still use like electric
shock therapy and it,

3221
01:31:11,251 --> 01:31:11,551
you know,

3222
01:31:11,551 --> 01:31:11,781
with,

3223
01:31:11,781 --> 01:31:14,220
with pretty good results
but a lot of side effects.

3224
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,830
Did you get hit in the head
a lot when you were a kid?

3225
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:18,503
Sometimes,

3226
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:20,370
but does.

3227
01:31:20,370 --> 01:31:22,960
Was there any like moments
where did get knocked down?

3228
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,240
I don't think I ever got knocked out.

3229
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:25,740
Did you ever get hit with a bat or,

3230
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:26,761
I played hockey,

3231
01:31:26,761 --> 01:31:28,320
so I used to check people a lot.

3232
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:29,310
Did you ever get down?

3233
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,140
Did you get really hurt doing that?

3234
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:32,870
Nah,

3235
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:33,960
never that my neck,

3236
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:35,910
my neck is still fucked
up to this day from a,

3237
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,810
from a check,

3238
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:38,100
a head check that I made.

3239
01:31:38,101 --> 01:31:40,950
But now I don't think I
ever had any concussions.

3240
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,710
My friend Mark [inaudible] sorry,

3241
01:31:43,711 --> 01:31:44,910
my mind runs in the family.

3242
01:31:44,911 --> 01:31:45,421
My Mom,

3243
01:31:45,421 --> 01:31:46,290
my dad's got it.

3244
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:46,471
It's,

3245
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:47,040
it's,

3246
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,750
it's very genetic depression.

3247
01:31:48,751 --> 01:31:48,930
No,

3248
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:49,590
I'm sure it is is,

3249
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:51,510
but I think it's accentuated by trauma.

3250
01:31:51,530 --> 01:31:52,050
Yeah.

3251
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:53,430
And that's why I was asking you because,

3252
01:31:53,431 --> 01:31:53,820
uh,

3253
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,320
even though you probably,

3254
01:31:55,321 --> 01:31:55,561
I mean,

3255
01:31:55,561 --> 01:31:56,970
I know you played a lot of hockey.

3256
01:31:57,410 --> 01:32:00,310
He knew that you probably don't think
about it like every time you collide and

3257
01:32:00,311 --> 01:32:01,510
even falling down,

3258
01:32:01,511 --> 01:32:02,470
slamming into the wall.

3259
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:03,560
Yeah.

3260
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,420
There's a lot of that.

3261
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,860
All that stuff rattles your brain.

3262
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:06,851
Believe it or not,

3263
01:32:06,851 --> 01:32:09,490
people get concussions from
getting hit in the chest sometimes.

3264
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,000
Really?

3265
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,360
Yeah.

3266
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,171
Here's cats and gone.

3267
01:32:11,171 --> 01:32:11,980
No,

3268
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:14,890
it says a EEG and vitals for my RM.

3269
01:32:14,891 --> 01:32:17,020
Damps treats FDA approved
to treat migraines.

3270
01:32:17,021 --> 01:32:18,880
Depression improves anxiety,

3271
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:19,571
PTSD,

3272
01:32:19,571 --> 01:32:20,111
Tbi,

3273
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:20,531
sleep,

3274
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:21,011
ADHD,

3275
01:32:21,011 --> 01:32:21,750
et Cetera,

3276
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:22,271
et cetera.

3277
01:32:22,271 --> 01:32:22,541
Now,

3278
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:25,090
accepting insurance and tri care mindset,

3279
01:32:25,091 --> 01:32:26,680
Rancho Bernardo,

3280
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:27,820
check them out.

3281
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:28,391
And this is a,

3282
01:32:28,391 --> 01:32:30,760
you can find this on cats
and Ganos Twitter page.

3283
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:33,430
She's got a picture of her with
this apparatus on her head,

3284
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,690
but I know it helped her.

3285
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:34,901
Yeah,

3286
01:32:34,901 --> 01:32:35,731
I've heard of Emj.

3287
01:32:35,731 --> 01:32:35,981
It's,

3288
01:32:35,981 --> 01:32:37,030
it's really effective.

3289
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,960
It helped her a lot.

3290
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:38,621
He helped it.

3291
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:39,070
Uh,

3292
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:39,401
you know,

3293
01:32:39,401 --> 01:32:43,700
she could talk about what sparring
was like before and afterwards.

3294
01:32:43,701 --> 01:32:44,540
So she just shared,

3295
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:45,790
her coordination was off.

3296
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:46,683
She was,

3297
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:49,540
that's one of the things that happens
to people when they get brain damage.

3298
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:51,270
If they get knocked out or you know,

3299
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,780
bad concussions is your,

3300
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:55,240
your system's not firing correctly.

3301
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:57,250
So you'll see their
body's not moving right.

3302
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,910
So it almost resets,

3303
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:00,090
resets to hard,

3304
01:33:00,091 --> 01:33:00,370
dry,

3305
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:01,203
damaged,

3306
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:02,120
damaged,

3307
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:02,330
right.

3308
01:33:02,330 --> 01:33:02,530
You know,

3309
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:04,810
the signals aren't getting
to the muscles correctly.

3310
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:05,743
So QC,

3311
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:09,790
one of the things that you see in older
boxers when they've taken too many

3312
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,210
horrible fights and they're,

3313
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:12,670
they're really starting to lose it,

3314
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:15,250
is there steps look shorter,

3315
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,750
their legs or look closer together.

3316
01:33:16,751 --> 01:33:17,040
They have it.

3317
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:17,290
Oh,

3318
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:18,970
they're having a harder time moving.

3319
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,100
They don't have the confidence to have
the balanced move around and their,

3320
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:23,450
their,

3321
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:23,950
their,

3322
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:26,330
their systems short circuiting.

3323
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:26,790
Yeah.

3324
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:27,070
You know,

3325
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:28,660
and you're seeing it
in their coordination.

3326
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,010
It's a weird thing to see too.

3327
01:33:30,011 --> 01:33:34,000
I've seen it in fighters where I remember
them in their prime and then I see

3328
01:33:34,001 --> 01:33:34,781
them now and I'm like,

3329
01:33:34,781 --> 01:33:35,614
Whoa,

3330
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:36,410
there's too,

3331
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:37,300
it's two possibilities.

3332
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:38,140
It could be an injury,

3333
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:39,370
they could be dealing with an injury,

3334
01:33:39,371 --> 01:33:41,250
but if you find that
there's no injury and like,

3335
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:42,760
oh this is not good.

3336
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:42,941
No,

3337
01:33:42,941 --> 01:33:46,040
just look at Ben Roethlisberger out
there and the pocket when he fell,

3338
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:47,230
he tries to run.

3339
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,120
It's like little steps,

3340
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:50,680
no movement in the shell days.

3341
01:33:50,681 --> 01:33:52,540
And that guy used to be fast back there,

3342
01:33:52,541 --> 01:33:53,830
but he's gotten hit a lot.

3343
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,480
Does no getting away from it,

3344
01:33:55,481 --> 01:33:56,230
man.

3345
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:56,951
It is what it is.

3346
01:33:56,951 --> 01:33:57,650
Yeah.

3347
01:33:57,650 --> 01:33:57,891
Have you,

3348
01:33:57,891 --> 01:33:59,320
had you ever been knocked out?

3349
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:00,250
Yeah.

3350
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:00,790
Yeah,

3351
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:01,810
not unconscious.

3352
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,760
I've got stopped and a kickboxing match.

3353
01:34:03,761 --> 01:34:07,720
I got hit with a big left hook boom
and my legs went out from under me.

3354
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,680
It was crazy.

3355
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:08,831
Well,

3356
01:34:08,831 --> 01:34:09,580
it didn't even hurt.

3357
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:10,530
It was like like,

3358
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:11,841
because you're,

3359
01:34:11,841 --> 01:34:16,180
you're full of adrenaline so you don't
feel it in terms of like a ouchy.

3360
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:18,160
It's not like [inaudible] but it's like,

3361
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,140
it wasn't like a painful thing.

3362
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:22,900
It was like being and then
my legs just stopped working.

3363
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:23,231
I was like,

3364
01:34:23,231 --> 01:34:24,100
Whoa,

3365
01:34:24,101 --> 01:34:24,940
what the fuck?

3366
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:28,600
That was the hardest I ever been hit
because it was just on the button.

3367
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:30,820
It was a perfect Isaac Duane.

3368
01:34:30,821 --> 01:34:31,091
I should,

3369
01:34:31,091 --> 01:34:32,770
as I was exhausted already,

3370
01:34:32,771 --> 01:34:33,080
it doesn't.

3371
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:38,080
The third fight of a day in a kickboxing
tournament and just crank and my legs

3372
01:34:39,131 --> 01:34:42,940
just went woopsies really lucky with all
the fighting you did that you never got

3373
01:34:42,941 --> 01:34:43,774
knocked out.

3374
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:44,680
Super Lucky.

3375
01:34:44,681 --> 01:34:48,310
But I definitely got hit in the head
a bunch and even though I didn't get

3376
01:34:48,311 --> 01:34:49,060
knocked out,

3377
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,290
there's a lot of sparring.

3378
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:52,600
There was a lot of getting
punched in the face.

3379
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:54,040
There was a lot of getting
kicked in the head,

3380
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:55,510
less kicked in the head,

3381
01:34:55,511 --> 01:34:56,081
believe it or not.

3382
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:56,891
Cause I was terrified.

3383
01:34:56,891 --> 01:34:58,010
I was always moving fast.

3384
01:34:58,340 --> 01:34:59,180
She wear helmets.

3385
01:34:59,240 --> 01:34:59,690
No,

3386
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:00,950
we wear these things.

3387
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:04,400
The first tournaments we used to wear
these things on the back of the head and

3388
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:04,491
that,

3389
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:08,810
that was so when you get knocked out
your fucking head doesn't bounce too hard

3390
01:35:08,811 --> 01:35:09,321
off the ground.

3391
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:11,360
I'm not bullshitting you pick one spot.

3392
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:13,430
There's a video of me
fighting with one of those on.

3393
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,710
It's a video of me on youtube.

3394
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:19,490
I've got this spot in the back
of my head that it looks like a,

3395
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,311
like a bald spot.

3396
01:35:20,311 --> 01:35:22,640
Like I would have if I had hair now,

3397
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:24,050
but it's a Yamaka.

3398
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:24,441
Yeah,

3399
01:35:24,441 --> 01:35:24,801
like a,

3400
01:35:24,801 --> 01:35:26,180
it's a red plastic thing.

3401
01:35:26,181 --> 01:35:27,650
It's hard to tell cause
it's a shitty video.

3402
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:31,940
But that red plastic thing was basically
like a spongy thing that these to use

3403
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:33,140
in taekwondo terms.

3404
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:37,490
Cause when it was first it was no padding
and then eventually they made people

3405
01:35:37,491 --> 01:35:40,480
start wearing these helmets and
they basically like these Cushnie,

3406
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:41,030
uh,

3407
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:42,740
helmets that go over the top of the head.

3408
01:35:42,741 --> 01:35:43,930
And you've got to strap
them out underneath.

3409
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,320
See how that guy's wearing it?

3410
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:46,693
The White Guy,

3411
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:49,730
the see the guy in the background or
the right side that's wearing the white

3412
01:35:49,731 --> 01:35:50,210
thing.

3413
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:51,140
That's the standard one.

3414
01:35:51,141 --> 01:35:51,680
What I'm wearing,

3415
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,030
just a pat on the back of my head.

3416
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:53,250
Right.

3417
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:55,850
See that there's like a red
thing in the back of my head.

3418
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:58,680
But that's in case I got Kod.

3419
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:00,770
Cause when we're fighting on a fucking,

3420
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:02,360
this is a basketball court.

3421
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,610
This is wood floor protection.

3422
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,440
That was me knocking that guy out.

3423
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:08,271
That was me.

3424
01:36:08,271 --> 01:36:11,210
This is me when I'm 19 so these,

3425
01:36:11,211 --> 01:36:12,770
this was where we fought all the time.

3426
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:14,270
We always fought on hardwood floors.

3427
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:17,150
One time I fought crazy
way crazier from this.

3428
01:36:17,151 --> 01:36:17,984
Ready for this?

3429
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,340
The Bay State Games.

3430
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:21,260
I find the bay state games.

3431
01:36:21,261 --> 01:36:24,560
We fought on a tarp that was
laid out over a cement floor.

3432
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:25,430
Wow.

3433
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:26,000
Yeah.

3434
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,830
And I knocked a guy out in his head,

3435
01:36:27,831 --> 01:36:29,000
bounced off the cement.

3436
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:30,180
Oh my God.

3437
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,850
Kicked this dude in the head and
his head bounced off somewhere.

3438
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,310
I'll never forget that sound.

3439
01:36:34,311 --> 01:36:34,790
Yes.

3440
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:37,700
So I was 19 I didn't
know what the fuck to do.

3441
01:36:37,701 --> 01:36:39,380
This is where the tournament was,

3442
01:36:39,381 --> 01:36:40,190
is okay.

3443
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:40,701
It's okay.

3444
01:36:40,701 --> 01:36:41,534
We're going to do this.

3445
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:42,620
We're going to fight here.

3446
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:43,940
Like if that was today,

3447
01:36:43,941 --> 01:36:44,420
I would like,

3448
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:46,910
are you guys out of your fucking mind?

3449
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:47,430
I would.

3450
01:36:47,430 --> 01:36:51,020
I would be screaming if I went with my
kid and he was supposed to fight in a

3451
01:36:51,021 --> 01:36:55,850
tournament and I got there and there was
a thin plastic tarp stretch out over a

3452
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:57,080
smooth concrete floor.

3453
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:57,651
I'm like,

3454
01:36:57,651 --> 01:36:59,300
what the fuck are you talking about?

3455
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:00,230
Are you crazy?

3456
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:00,710
Yeah.

3457
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:01,880
Like you need pads.

3458
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:04,010
You need people to make sure
they don't go out of bounds.

3459
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:06,740
Tarp laid down over concrete.

3460
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:07,380
Wow.

3461
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:08,213
He was so,

3462
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:09,470
so dangerous.

3463
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,450
So I definitely got my noggin.

3464
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:14,450
Rattled a gang at times.

3465
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:14,990
Yeah.

3466
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:15,920
I don't know how many times

3467
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:19,470
I said do a gymnastics for like six years.

3468
01:37:19,471 --> 01:37:22,030
Starting when I was like six I backflip.

3469
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:22,621
Oh yeah,

3470
01:37:22,621 --> 01:37:23,250
I could do,

3471
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:24,570
I used to do double backs.

3472
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:24,960
No,

3473
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:25,111
no,

3474
01:37:25,111 --> 01:37:25,471
I did.

3475
01:37:25,471 --> 01:37:25,731
I,

3476
01:37:25,731 --> 01:37:27,120
I trained for like six years.

3477
01:37:27,121 --> 01:37:27,901
Hard way.

3478
01:37:27,901 --> 01:37:28,860
How do I not know this?

3479
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:29,131
Yeah.

3480
01:37:29,131 --> 01:37:30,530
So I used to do a,

3481
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:30,751
yeah,

3482
01:37:30,751 --> 01:37:31,531
I could do round off,

3483
01:37:31,531 --> 01:37:33,150
back handspring into a double back.

3484
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:34,020
And you still do that?

3485
01:37:34,110 --> 01:37:34,943
I can,

3486
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:37,020
I haven't tried a single back in a while,

3487
01:37:37,021 --> 01:37:37,800
but I could do,

3488
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,960
I could do standing back
flips until a few years ago.

3489
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,220
Wow.

3490
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:41,610
Yeah,

3491
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:42,510
no shit.

3492
01:37:42,511 --> 01:37:43,344
Right.

3493
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:44,271
So I,

3494
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:45,740
so I just wanted to learn how to do that.

3495
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:46,530
I did a,

3496
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:50,420
I over rotated a flip one time and I
fucking slammed my head in the maths back

3497
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:50,870
then.

3498
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:52,820
When you see floor exercise today,

3499
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:54,530
it's not even the same sport.

3500
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,910
It's all springboard.

3501
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:56,341
Right.

3502
01:37:56,341 --> 01:37:58,020
With like two inches of padding.

3503
01:37:58,170 --> 01:37:58,321
Right.

3504
01:37:58,321 --> 01:37:58,951
When we did it,

3505
01:37:58,951 --> 01:38:00,720
it was those fucking rubber,

3506
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:01,411
you know,

3507
01:38:01,411 --> 01:38:04,980
half inch thick mats that you roll
out and the corners come popping up.

3508
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:06,330
That's what we used to do it.

3509
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,040
Oh yes,

3510
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:10,410
you were fucking twisting
your ankle all the time,

3511
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:11,340
landing on that shit.

3512
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:13,530
How bad you fuck your
head up when you landed.

3513
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:14,640
It was bad.

3514
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,250
My injuries or my ankle.

3515
01:38:16,251 --> 01:38:17,330
So I used to fuck up my yeah.

3516
01:38:17,331 --> 01:38:17,851
And then you know,

3517
01:38:17,851 --> 01:38:18,331
you can't,

3518
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:19,890
then you can't do anything
for a little while.

3519
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:20,930
So,

3520
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:21,360
well,

3521
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:25,140
the reason why I keep asking you about
head trauma is cause my friend Mark

3522
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:25,620
Gordon,

3523
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,960
he's an expert in traumatic brain injury.

3524
01:38:27,961 --> 01:38:31,200
He's an endocrinologist and he studies
a lot of soldiers and he's written a

3525
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:33,810
bunch of papers on soldiers,

3526
01:38:33,811 --> 01:38:34,830
former football players,

3527
01:38:34,831 --> 01:38:35,371
fighters.

3528
01:38:35,371 --> 01:38:39,570
He's worked with a bunch of people
that have had brain injuries and his

3529
01:38:39,571 --> 01:38:40,261
conclusion,

3530
01:38:40,261 --> 01:38:41,910
like in a lot of them that were suicidal,

3531
01:38:41,911 --> 01:38:43,440
a lot of them that are severely depressed.

3532
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:46,650
And his conclusion is
that for a lot of them,

3533
01:38:46,651 --> 01:38:50,490
what happened was damaged to the
pituitary gland that stopped them from

3534
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:52,050
producing hormones correctly.

3535
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:54,720
And it leads to severe lack of energy,

3536
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:55,554
depression.

3537
01:38:55,860 --> 01:39:00,600
And it's almost always correlated with
head trauma and oftentimes head trauma

3538
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:01,530
that people forgot about.

3539
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:03,060
Why didn't think of that big of a deal.

3540
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:07,530
But it could be literally
wiping out on a jet ski,

3541
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,470
slamming into the water and yeah,

3542
01:39:10,471 --> 01:39:12,690
and then you're fucked up for
years and you don't know why.

3543
01:39:12,691 --> 01:39:13,680
Skiing for sure,

3544
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:14,251
falling down,

3545
01:39:14,251 --> 01:39:16,200
hitting your head
snowboarding is really common.

3546
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:19,470
I've never snowboarded but apparently
when the s the board kicks up,

3547
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,570
your feet go up in the air and
the fucking head comes down.

3548
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:22,080
Yeah.

3549
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,250
That's how people get got

3550
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,100
well and you got to wear a helmet.

3551
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:25,490
Yeah.

3552
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:26,500
And a lot of kids don't.

3553
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:27,800
Yeah,

3554
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:30,410
I've heard of kids
getting fucked up so yeah.

3555
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:34,040
But so all those things
contribute to the foot.

3556
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,110
Your brain is super delicate,

3557
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:36,711
you know,

3558
01:39:36,711 --> 01:39:38,180
it's really complicated machinery.

3559
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:39,800
It's like when you drop your iPhone,

3560
01:39:39,801 --> 01:39:40,790
maybe you drop at once,

3561
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:42,620
how many times to drop your iPhone,

3562
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:43,790
you drop to three times to hey,

3563
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:44,001
hey,

3564
01:39:44,001 --> 01:39:44,420
hey,

3565
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:45,770
put a fucking case on that thing.

3566
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:46,663
Yeah.

3567
01:39:48,830 --> 01:39:50,450
I mean they do these drop tests,

3568
01:39:50,451 --> 01:39:50,960
right?

3569
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,050
They do drop tests where they drop it
over concrete and see how good it is.

3570
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:57,270
Your head is similar in that you,

3571
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:59,570
you can get away with
getting racked in the head.

3572
01:39:59,571 --> 01:40:02,950
But I was in Hawaii recently and I
dropped my phone the last time that,

3573
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:03,620
you know,

3574
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,610
you drop your phone and you know,

3575
01:40:04,611 --> 01:40:08,090
it's getting a little wonky and then
you drop it the last time and it's just

3576
01:40:08,091 --> 01:40:08,571
gone.

3577
01:40:08,571 --> 01:40:09,500
So it's gone.

3578
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,570
Ceville it was just calling people.

3579
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:12,140
I would,

3580
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:12,630
I was,

3581
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:13,280
yeah,

3582
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:14,150
I was showing a,

3583
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:14,780
so when I was,

3584
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:15,230
uh,

3585
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:16,820
had the phone open and I was like,

3586
01:40:16,821 --> 01:40:17,061
watch,

3587
01:40:17,061 --> 01:40:17,331
watch,

3588
01:40:17,331 --> 01:40:18,081
it's on the context.

3589
01:40:18,081 --> 01:40:20,630
So like it's just going to start calling
people and just started calling people

3590
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:24,200
and I'd hang up and they would just call
somebody else to hang up and it would

3591
01:40:24,201 --> 01:40:24,800
just cost,

3592
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,480
it was just falling apart.

3593
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:28,430
It wouldn't let me log in anymore.

3594
01:40:28,431 --> 01:40:29,091
Like it wasn't,

3595
01:40:29,091 --> 01:40:33,110
it wasn't sensing my fingers touching
the screen to put in the key code.

3596
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,460
Here's your shit all backed up.

3597
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:34,871
Yeah,

3598
01:40:34,871 --> 01:40:35,360
yeah,

3599
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:35,601
yeah.

3600
01:40:35,601 --> 01:40:36,231
It was all backed up,

3601
01:40:36,231 --> 01:40:36,621
but it was like,

3602
01:40:36,621 --> 01:40:37,420
God damn.

3603
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:37,900
Yeah.

3604
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:38,440
Goddammit.

3605
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,273
Yup.

3606
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:40,560
Yeah.

3607
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,640
I smashed my screen.

3608
01:40:41,641 --> 01:40:41,970
I didn't,

3609
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:42,803
I didn't give a fuck

3610
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:43,663
your heads like that.

3611
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:44,540
That's my point.

3612
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:44,760
Yeah.

3613
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,530
Heads like that.

3614
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:47,210
Like if I didn't get that one last drop,

3615
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:48,950
maybe a phone would've been all right.

3616
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:49,400
Yeah.

3617
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,510
They would have kept that phone today.

3618
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:51,221
You know what?

3619
01:40:51,221 --> 01:40:52,540
Maybe be able to look
through the new phones went,

3620
01:40:52,541 --> 01:40:53,170
I don't need that.

3621
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:54,520
It's basically the same phone,

3622
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:55,453
right?

3623
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:56,323
Nope.

3624
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:57,560
Draak smack.

3625
01:40:58,190 --> 01:41:00,020
I'm reading this book now about,

3626
01:41:00,021 --> 01:41:00,650
um,

3627
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:01,910
speaking of changing your brain,

3628
01:41:01,911 --> 01:41:02,840
it's called a,

3629
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:04,310
how to change your mind.

3630
01:41:04,590 --> 01:41:06,050
God is Michael Pollan.

3631
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:06,790
Yeah.

3632
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:07,130
Yeah.

3633
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:08,480
He's been on the podcast talking about,

3634
01:41:08,510 --> 01:41:08,601
oh,

3635
01:41:08,601 --> 01:41:09,231
no shit.

3636
01:41:09,231 --> 01:41:09,521
Yeah,

3637
01:41:09,521 --> 01:41:09,811
that's great.

3638
01:41:09,811 --> 01:41:10,430
Okay.

3639
01:41:10,430 --> 01:41:11,720
Did he talk about his new book,

3640
01:41:11,721 --> 01:41:12,261
about the,

3641
01:41:12,261 --> 01:41:13,080
um,

3642
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:13,330
it,

3643
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:13,611
it's,

3644
01:41:13,611 --> 01:41:14,990
it's basically about,

3645
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:16,363
uh,

3646
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:16,910
um,

3647
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:20,330
psychedelics and LSD and
mushrooms in particular,

3648
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,340
trace of the whole fucking history of it.

3649
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:26,780
I had no idea how much research was
done back in the fifties and sixties.

3650
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:27,351
I mean,

3651
01:41:27,351 --> 01:41:31,280
they had conclusive studies
that were showing with,

3652
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,133
um,

3653
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:33,740
alcoholism.

3654
01:41:33,860 --> 01:41:38,860
People were 70% of people that underwent
these treatments with psychedelics got

3655
01:41:39,471 --> 01:41:40,120
sober,

3656
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:40,730
you know,

3657
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:41,570
depression,

3658
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:42,673
cigarettes,

3659
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:43,790
cigarettes.

3660
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:44,811
I mean,

3661
01:41:44,811 --> 01:41:48,350
it's amazing and all that shit
just got fucking thrown away.

3662
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:53,340
Corrupt people kept that
information away from folks.

3663
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:55,290
The studies that Nixon funded,

3664
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,830
like Nixon funded a bunch of studies that
showed positive benefits of marijuana.

3665
01:41:59,310 --> 01:41:59,731
How is that?

3666
01:41:59,731 --> 01:42:00,030
Right.

3667
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:00,450
And they,

3668
01:42:00,450 --> 01:42:00,870
you know,

3669
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:01,920
the Nixon administration,

3670
01:42:01,921 --> 01:42:02,754
just fucking,

3671
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:06,260
can I get out of here with this
shit not releasing this one.

3672
01:42:06,350 --> 01:42:09,370
The other thing he mentioned
is that it got squashed by,

3673
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:13,420
by shrinks because they had
a vested interest in people
not going into the woods

3674
01:42:13,421 --> 01:42:16,150
for a weekend and coming back
without their depression.

3675
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:17,321
So yeah,

3676
01:42:17,321 --> 01:42:17,861
so they,

3677
01:42:17,861 --> 01:42:19,870
so they disqualified all the studies.

3678
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:20,561
Oh fuck.

3679
01:42:20,561 --> 01:42:21,130
Yeah.

3680
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:24,880
What psychiatrists were like horrified
that there was the these kind of results,

3681
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:25,021
we're,

3682
01:42:25,021 --> 01:42:25,854
we're coming back.

3683
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:27,350
Was it that for sure?

3684
01:42:27,351 --> 01:42:32,210
Or was it people who've
never taken psychedelics
horrified that people were out

3685
01:42:32,211 --> 01:42:33,710
there experimenting with
their consciousness?

3686
01:42:33,711 --> 01:42:37,000
Because I think a lot of
these psychiatrists are
probably really straight laced

3687
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:37,730
guys.

3688
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:38,870
And so in their mind,

3689
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:43,810
especially in the shadows of reefer
madness and all the propaganda that they'd

3690
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:47,660
heard in the 30s and forties and when
you look at those people and they're out

3691
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:51,050
there in the fucking desert or wherever
they're going dancing around and taking

3692
01:42:51,051 --> 01:42:52,130
mushrooms under the moonlight,

3693
01:42:52,131 --> 01:42:52,311
you like,

3694
01:42:52,311 --> 01:42:53,690
they're blowing their brains out here.

3695
01:42:53,691 --> 01:42:54,530
You got to stop this.

3696
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:57,080
If they're straight laced people
that have ever done psychedelics,

3697
01:42:57,530 --> 01:42:58,940
they might not be in cahoots.

3698
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:03,320
It might more likely be a bunch of people
to think it's a fucking terrible idea

3699
01:43:03,321 --> 01:43:04,220
to let people run around.

3700
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:05,000
Taken acid.

3701
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,210
Well there was just some of the
medical journals came out with,

3702
01:43:08,211 --> 01:43:13,070
with pieces saying that none of these
studies are valid because there wasn't a,

3703
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:17,030
I forget what it is about studies
that have to be consistent.

3704
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:18,140
Um,

3705
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:22,250
but the other thing is it was political
and you had Timothy leary who is,

3706
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:23,090
you know,

3707
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:27,590
the worst thing to happen to this kind
of testing because he was saying was it

3708
01:43:27,591 --> 01:43:27,911
dropped,

3709
01:43:27,911 --> 01:43:29,930
dropped down in turn on,

3710
01:43:29,931 --> 01:43:30,261
drop,

3711
01:43:30,261 --> 01:43:31,094
drop out.

3712
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:32,270
And that whole idea,

3713
01:43:32,271 --> 01:43:32,661
they said,

3714
01:43:32,661 --> 01:43:32,970
you know,

3715
01:43:32,970 --> 01:43:36,380
were people taking LSD are
not going to fight your wars.

3716
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:40,070
And so that became a
threat to the status quo.

3717
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:41,570
Wow.

3718
01:43:41,570 --> 01:43:43,250
And that's when the law
is starting to come out.

3719
01:43:44,910 --> 01:43:45,743
Huh.

3720
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:46,520
It's interesting

3721
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,770
cause he also got a lot of
people to get excited about it.

3722
01:43:48,771 --> 01:43:49,380
That's

3723
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:50,213
right.

3724
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:50,820
Yeah.

3725
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:51,653
But he got,

3726
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,700
he took it away from it being a,

3727
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:55,563
um,

3728
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:59,420
a medical process and he made it about,

3729
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:00,521
you know,

3730
01:44:00,521 --> 01:44:01,271
enlightenment,

3731
01:44:01,271 --> 01:44:02,940
but in a kind of fluffy spirit,

3732
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:03,793
joy away.

3733
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:04,061
Well,

3734
01:44:04,061 --> 01:44:05,380
he made it a big movement.

3735
01:44:05,410 --> 01:44:05,830
Right.

3736
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:08,770
I think you saw that he was probably
going to change the world with that

3737
01:44:08,771 --> 01:44:09,490
movement.

3738
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:09,731
Yeah,

3739
01:44:09,731 --> 01:44:12,760
he kinda did definitely had a big impact.

3740
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:13,121
You know,

3741
01:44:13,121 --> 01:44:14,500
all those people that took acid,

3742
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:19,770
like think about if you really stop and
think about apple and you really look at

3743
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,740
the fact that apple,

3744
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:26,270
Steve Jobs said that taken acid.

3745
01:44:26,271 --> 01:44:28,140
It was like one of the greatest
things that's ever happened to.

3746
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:28,750
Yeah.

3747
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:29,051
That was,

3748
01:44:29,051 --> 01:44:30,970
as it was famously talked about it.

3749
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:32,891
And who knows what a,

3750
01:44:32,891 --> 01:44:37,891
what an impact that had on him deciding
to start apple and what would an impact

3751
01:44:38,051 --> 01:44:40,240
apple has had in the technology world.

3752
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:40,710
Oh No.

3753
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:42,030
Pollen talks about it in the book.

3754
01:44:42,031 --> 01:44:45,810
He draws a straight line from people
starting to take all this stuff because it

3755
01:44:45,811 --> 01:44:47,760
was happening in Silicon Valley.

3756
01:44:48,090 --> 01:44:50,880
This whole psychedelic movement
was like right in that area.

3757
01:44:51,330 --> 01:44:52,310
And he says that it,

3758
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:52,681
you know,

3759
01:44:52,681 --> 01:44:53,040
Bill,

3760
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,810
Bill Gates apparently took it once,

3761
01:44:55,410 --> 01:44:58,170
but that all those guys were
coming in and they were,

3762
01:44:58,350 --> 01:44:58,621
you know,

3763
01:44:58,621 --> 01:44:58,821
they,

3764
01:44:58,821 --> 01:45:01,050
there were these people that would lead.

3765
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:03,270
There was a guy named,

3766
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,193
um,

3767
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:06,733
no Hubbard,

3768
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:08,670
well Ron doss has mentioned also,

3769
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:11,610
but there was a guy name
Hubbard who was really like,

3770
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:12,330
you know,

3771
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:14,430
a corporate version of LSD.

3772
01:45:14,431 --> 01:45:19,431
He was going to companies and he was
taking the CEO's of companies and taking

3773
01:45:19,741 --> 01:45:24,060
them in for these three
day drop acid experiences.

3774
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:25,403
Wow.

3775
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:28,070
Corporate acid.

3776
01:45:28,071 --> 01:45:28,221
Well,

3777
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:29,810
they're kind of doing that at burning man.

3778
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:30,831
Oh,

3779
01:45:30,831 --> 01:45:31,341
is that right?

3780
01:45:31,341 --> 01:45:32,174
Some corporations,

3781
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:32,930
I mean,

3782
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:33,740
not a lot,

3783
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:36,440
but there's some cool companies
and go to burning man.

3784
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:37,220
Yeah.

3785
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:38,053
You know,

3786
01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:41,560
what's this Alfred Matthew Hubbard,

3787
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:44,320
he's an early proponent of the drug LSD.

3788
01:45:44,321 --> 01:45:45,460
During the 1950s,

3789
01:45:45,461 --> 01:45:49,930
he is reputed to be the Johnny
Appleseed of Lsd and the first person to

3790
01:45:49,931 --> 01:45:54,931
emphasize led lsds potential as a
visionary or trends and dental truck.

3791
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:58,780
But this guy had on a fucking life,

3792
01:45:58,781 --> 01:46:00,610
somebody's got to do a
movie about his life.

3793
01:46:00,611 --> 01:46:00,831
He,

3794
01:46:00,831 --> 01:46:04,540
he was like working for the government.

3795
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:06,130
He was a double agent.

3796
01:46:06,131 --> 01:46:06,810
He was,

3797
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:07,420
uh,

3798
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:08,560
while he was dropping acid.

3799
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:09,543
He was,

3800
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:10,150
he,

3801
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:11,380
he started with nothing.

3802
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:11,891
No,

3803
01:46:11,891 --> 01:46:12,760
I think before,

3804
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:13,841
before,

3805
01:46:13,841 --> 01:46:14,680
during and after.

3806
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:19,710
He had like eight different careers
and he was like a spy and he bought it.

3807
01:46:20,501 --> 01:46:24,250
He started with nothing and ended up with
like a bunch of airplanes that he was

3808
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:25,420
leasing out,

3809
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:29,200
became a millionaire and then spent it
all trying to educate people on Lsd.

3810
01:46:29,201 --> 01:46:33,040
He was worth like tens of millions of
dollars and he ended up broke at the end.

3811
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:35,290
Wow.

3812
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:36,123
Yeah.

3813
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:37,143
Wow.

3814
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:39,790
All for the LSD,

3815
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:43,930
he believed in it so strongly that said
it was going to change the world and it

3816
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:44,764
would have,

3817
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:46,120
it may still now there's,

3818
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,390
now it's coming back back.

3819
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:48,480
Well,

3820
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,160
there was a hiccup or several

3821
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,170
generations had a pass before people
started understanding that there's,

3822
01:46:53,710 --> 01:46:54,060
there's,

3823
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:56,340
there's a risk to everything.

3824
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:58,380
There's a risk to sports.

3825
01:46:58,381 --> 01:47:02,430
There's a risk to every fucking thing
you do driving your cars are at risk.

3826
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:03,900
There's a risk with psychedelics,

3827
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:07,110
but there's also a reward and I
think if you're going to be honest,

3828
01:47:07,111 --> 01:47:08,250
do you have to look at both of them?

3829
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:09,840
You have to look at the potential risk.

3830
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:14,150
You have to look at the reward and they're
not looking at the reward to try to,

3831
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:17,640
there's too many people out there that
are trying to deny the reward and you got

3832
01:47:17,641 --> 01:47:18,474
to find out why.

3833
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:21,630
And in this day and age
it might be a conspiracy,

3834
01:47:21,631 --> 01:47:26,070
it might be some pharmaceutical industry
that doesn't want it to be legal

3835
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:27,810
because it would undermine their profits.

3836
01:47:27,811 --> 01:47:28,410
It might be,

3837
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:32,970
it might be some law enforcement unions
that think it's a bad idea to make less

3838
01:47:32,971 --> 01:47:33,960
things illegal.

3839
01:47:33,961 --> 01:47:34,794
It will take,

3840
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:35,730
you know,

3841
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:36,480
prisons.

3842
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:36,731
Yeah.

3843
01:47:36,731 --> 01:47:38,220
It will take people away,

3844
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:38,461
you know,

3845
01:47:38,461 --> 01:47:40,590
in terms of the amount of people
that they need for the job,

3846
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:41,580
you know,

3847
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:44,220
which I think that's another story.

3848
01:47:44,221 --> 01:47:46,530
But when you,

3849
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,393
you know,

3850
01:47:49,850 --> 01:47:52,790
and people look at that kind of
stuff and you look at like the,

3851
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:58,000
the underlying sort of patterns
that we follow in this country,

3852
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:00,321
you know,

3853
01:48:00,321 --> 01:48:01,370
the patterns that we like,

3854
01:48:01,371 --> 01:48:05,180
are you happy or not happy
with the way things go?

3855
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,500
The way things are run.

3856
01:48:07,450 --> 01:48:07,910
Okay.

3857
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:08,960
In what sense?

3858
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:11,330
Just in any sense in all of it,

3859
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:16,830
I trust that we do have
the best system out there.

3860
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:19,620
And we challenge it every day.

3861
01:48:19,621 --> 01:48:24,621
And I still think that we live in a place
where the tenants of our society are

3862
01:48:26,131 --> 01:48:28,530
in place for sure they
swing one way or the other,

3863
01:48:28,531 --> 01:48:31,380
but I still believe in democracy.

3864
01:48:31,381 --> 01:48:32,400
And um,

3865
01:48:32,401 --> 01:48:37,401
I think the internet as an as an overall
thing has been positive for people

3866
01:48:38,131 --> 01:48:39,900
getting their voices out and for,

3867
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:41,070
for information period

3868
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,173
being distributed.

3869
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:43,680
But the I,

3870
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:47,160
the idea that we're faced
with that in this day and age,

3871
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:50,610
there's grown adults telling other grown
adults what they can and can't put in

3872
01:48:50,611 --> 01:48:51,444
their body.

3873
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,840
Yeah.

3874
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,370
And then not being honest
about the benefits.

3875
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:53,730
Right.

3876
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:55,650
That's where it gets squirrely.

3877
01:48:55,651 --> 01:48:57,210
That's where the whole thing falls apart.

3878
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:58,410
Like you're just a guy.

3879
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:01,080
Like if you and I are the only two people
on the planet and he only came out,

3880
01:49:01,081 --> 01:49:02,400
I'm not going to let you take that acid.

3881
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:03,121
Like,

3882
01:49:03,121 --> 01:49:03,954
why?

3883
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:04,891
Well,

3884
01:49:04,891 --> 01:49:06,150
because it's illegal.

3885
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:06,451
Look,

3886
01:49:06,451 --> 01:49:07,284
I wrote it down.

3887
01:49:07,570 --> 01:49:08,610
Can you take the acid?

3888
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:08,840
Right.

3889
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:08,930
Well,

3890
01:49:08,930 --> 01:49:10,110
that would be preposterous.

3891
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:10,530
Yeah.

3892
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:11,311
But somehow or another,

3893
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:15,030
it works when there's a million
people that a person could tell.

3894
01:49:15,031 --> 01:49:15,390
You know,

3895
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:16,950
if you're a fucking grown adult,

3896
01:49:16,951 --> 01:49:20,610
you can't tell me what
I can take that stupid.

3897
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:21,473
Yeah.

3898
01:49:21,530 --> 01:49:21,800
If,

3899
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:26,490
if you can't prove beyond a shadow of
a doubt that what I'm going to take is

3900
01:49:26,491 --> 01:49:27,630
gonna fuck with you.

3901
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:29,010
If you can't prove that,

3902
01:49:29,011 --> 01:49:29,670
then stop.

3903
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:30,503
Yeah.

3904
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:30,991
Look,

3905
01:49:30,991 --> 01:49:32,160
if someone does something,

3906
01:49:32,161 --> 01:49:35,610
if takes something and does and they take
PCP and they run face first through a

3907
01:49:35,611 --> 01:49:37,890
fucking seven 11 window that's on them,

3908
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:39,150
it's on their actions.

3909
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:42,420
It doesn't mean you shouldn't be able
to try PCP and I don't think you should

3910
01:49:42,421 --> 01:49:43,254
try PCP.

3911
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:46,500
I think when enough enough people
smashed through windows and go crazy,

3912
01:49:46,501 --> 01:49:46,621
you go,

3913
01:49:46,621 --> 01:49:46,831
hey,

3914
01:49:46,831 --> 01:49:48,280
maybe that's a drug I
should fucking avoid.

3915
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:50,350
But that's how you find out about that.

3916
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:51,100
Yeah.

3917
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:55,240
You lit grown adults make
their own decisions and if
you're the one who's making

3918
01:49:55,241 --> 01:49:56,890
the decisions for all the grown adults,

3919
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:59,470
you better have some real fucking
logic to what you're saying.

3920
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:00,760
It turns out they don't

3921
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:04,710
and this is the same society that allows
the pharmaceuticals to peddle opiates

3922
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:08,700
to people for the last 30 years saying
that it was the greatest thing you could

3923
01:50:08,701 --> 01:50:09,400
do.

3924
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:10,150
Exactly.

3925
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:13,750
I think it's good that they make money
because they make medicine that helps a

3926
01:50:13,751 --> 01:50:14,584
lot of people.

3927
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,060
They're not all bad.

3928
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,890
I think in general,

3929
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:21,550
pharmaceuticals have helped
people in tremendous ways,

3930
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:25,030
but you can't deny that
if there's some way,

3931
01:50:25,031 --> 01:50:29,860
shape or form that people are
influencing other people having access to

3932
01:50:29,861 --> 01:50:33,130
beneficial things because it
would impact their profit line.

3933
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:34,810
That's,

3934
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:35,800
that's evil.

3935
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:36,880
That's evil.

3936
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,130
You have a lot of fucking money.

3937
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:43,390
If you really going out of your way
to hire lobbyists to make sure that

3938
01:50:43,391 --> 01:50:45,130
mushrooms don't get on the table,

3939
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:47,411
come on,

3940
01:50:47,411 --> 01:50:48,200
man.

3941
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:49,033
You're you are.

3942
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:50,980
You're a fucking real problem.

3943
01:50:50,981 --> 01:50:52,120
That's a real problem.

3944
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:53,740
If you look at Yin and Yang,

3945
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:54,371
this is,

3946
01:50:54,371 --> 01:50:59,371
this is the opposing forces that were
battling to try to get total complete

3947
01:50:59,741 --> 01:51:01,060
freedom of your consciousness.

3948
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:02,830
These are the opposing forces.

3949
01:51:02,831 --> 01:51:05,050
Their ignorance like these psychiatry,

3950
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,650
I guarantee you the psychiatrists were
worried about correlations between

3951
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:11,920
psychotic episodes and
psychedelic drug use.

3952
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:15,490
And they're worried about people
falling apart and they're right.

3953
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:16,210
They're right.

3954
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:17,370
This are the ones that wanted to get it.

3955
01:51:17,371 --> 01:51:17,951
Illegal debt.

3956
01:51:17,951 --> 01:51:18,784
Right.

3957
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:22,330
It's like working on backflips when
there's a fucking thin pad under you.

3958
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:22,631
Yeah.

3959
01:51:22,631 --> 01:51:23,620
You could fall in your head.

3960
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:24,513
You're right.

3961
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:24,941
And we say,

3962
01:51:24,941 --> 01:51:26,680
don't do gymnastics.

3963
01:51:26,770 --> 01:51:28,000
People fall in their head.

3964
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:30,160
One out of 10 falls on their head.

3965
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:32,530
You're not doing Jimmy not
falling on your fucking head.

3966
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:33,180
Right.

3967
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:34,013
This is the same thing.

3968
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:35,013
It's the same thing.

3969
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:38,950
So people worried about it that
don't really have experience in it.

3970
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:42,820
I guarantee you most of
those psychiatrists just
didn't have experience in it.

3971
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:44,770
Or we're super cautious folks is,

3972
01:51:44,771 --> 01:51:46,000
if they did have experienced with it,

3973
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:48,400
maybe they try a little mushroom
dose and they'd be like,

3974
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:49,234
wow,

3975
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:51,080
this is amazing.

3976
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:51,910
His screen.

3977
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:53,390
And also controlling,

3978
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:54,253
um,

3979
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:55,783
you know,

3980
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:56,780
set and setting.

3981
01:51:56,781 --> 01:51:57,950
They keep talking about,

3982
01:51:58,340 --> 01:51:58,701
you know,

3983
01:51:58,701 --> 01:52:00,330
and realizing that the,

3984
01:52:00,331 --> 01:52:01,130
the,

3985
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:01,963
you know,

3986
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:06,530
occurrence of a psychotic episode
is so much lower when it's,

3987
01:52:06,531 --> 01:52:06,820
you know,

3988
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:07,380
when you're,

3989
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:10,430
when it's being dispensed
the right way so much lower.

3990
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,340
You ever been led through it by somebody.

3991
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:16,040
Now when you did IOWASCA
was there like a guy,

3992
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:17,713
DMT,

3993
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:18,951
Aubrey,

3994
01:52:18,951 --> 01:52:20,400
my friend Aubrey acted as a,

3995
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:22,760
he signed to like set the setting,

3996
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:24,490
um,

3997
01:52:24,490 --> 01:52:25,580
in a way where it was,

3998
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:25,940
uh,

3999
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:26,773
you know,

4000
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:27,680
I would,

4001
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,240
I would say like spiritual,

4002
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:33,020
like not dot Riddick not over the top,

4003
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:37,220
but just announcing your intentions
that we're going into this,

4004
01:52:37,610 --> 01:52:38,480
we're going in this,

4005
01:52:38,810 --> 01:52:39,860
we're going to let go.

4006
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:44,210
We're going to give thanks to all,

4007
01:52:44,211 --> 01:52:45,044
all the spirits,

4008
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:46,550
us and all the energy around us.

4009
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,680
Just go into this with a good intention.

4010
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:49,520
Give,

4011
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,570
be grateful.

4012
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:51,970
Be uh,

4013
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:53,600
go into it with gratitude.

4014
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,690
And then the way it hits you,

4015
01:52:56,691 --> 01:52:57,620
it hits you like,

4016
01:52:58,970 --> 01:53:03,970
like a infinite cyte clone of geometric
patterns in impossible colors.

4017
01:53:05,150 --> 01:53:10,150
Just blasting in your brain
instantaneously and you'll
have like going into it

4018
01:53:10,731 --> 01:53:15,230
with the intention of letting go is
probably one of the best pieces of advice

4019
01:53:15,231 --> 01:53:18,200
you could give people
to avoid a freak out,

4020
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:18,980
right?

4021
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:19,813
Go with it.

4022
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:20,930
Let it go.

4023
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:21,920
Just let yourself go.

4024
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:25,670
And it's what's trying to do is your ego
is trying to wrestle with this grizzly

4025
01:53:25,671 --> 01:53:26,420
bear.

4026
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:30,110
This enormous short face bear
on steroids is trying to,

4027
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:33,590
your ego's trying to wrestle with
is impossible to resist force.

4028
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:36,230
And that's what leads to a
lot of people freaking out.

4029
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:37,280
So Iga,

4030
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,970
losing your ego is the
ultimate goal of it.

4031
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:42,463
Um,

4032
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:45,230
I don't think anybody ever
really loses their ego.

4033
01:53:45,770 --> 01:53:46,391
I think you,

4034
01:53:46,391 --> 01:53:47,480
you keep it in check.

4035
01:53:47,481 --> 01:53:48,710
You lose some of it.

4036
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:51,080
You keep some of it because that's,

4037
01:53:51,150 --> 01:53:52,760
it's part of your survival mechanism.

4038
01:53:52,761 --> 01:53:52,911
And there,

4039
01:53:52,911 --> 01:53:54,980
the real problem is like
having a healthy ego.

4040
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:55,970
You know,

4041
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:56,361
like,

4042
01:53:56,361 --> 01:53:57,194
uh,

4043
01:53:58,510 --> 01:54:00,870
like if your wife looks good and she's
looking at herself in the mirror,

4044
01:54:00,871 --> 01:54:00,931
I,

4045
01:54:00,931 --> 01:54:01,271
she was like,

4046
01:54:01,271 --> 01:54:01,810
I look good.

4047
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:02,860
You look fucking great.

4048
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:03,730
I do look good.

4049
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:04,731
Like she feels good.

4050
01:54:04,731 --> 01:54:05,291
It feels everybody.

4051
01:54:05,291 --> 01:54:06,124
That's ego,

4052
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:06,341
right?

4053
01:54:06,341 --> 01:54:07,090
You want to know you,

4054
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:07,840
you look good,

4055
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,160
but it's not a bad ego.

4056
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:10,160
It's fun.

4057
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:10,750
You know what I'm saying?

4058
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:11,583
Yeah.

4059
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:16,480
The real problem is when it gets
out of control and toxic than it,

4060
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:18,280
like other people see it,

4061
01:54:18,281 --> 01:54:19,200
they're like [inaudible],

4062
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:19,961
you know,

4063
01:54:19,961 --> 01:54:21,460
you see gross,

4064
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:24,460
just gross behavior,

4065
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:25,570
grow selfishness.

4066
01:54:25,571 --> 01:54:26,770
You see that and you go,

4067
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:27,041
oh,

4068
01:54:27,041 --> 01:54:28,720
that's the bad part of the ego.

4069
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:29,580
That's what I'm saying.

4070
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:30,413
Yeah.

4071
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:33,400
But the key is to know which is which,

4072
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:34,450
and that's hard.

4073
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:35,560
It's hard to know which is which.

4074
01:54:35,561 --> 01:54:38,680
Which one is the overwhelming
force inside your mind?

4075
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:42,790
Which one is the one that's controlling
your consciousness and your behavior in

4076
01:54:42,791 --> 01:54:43,280
which is,

4077
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:43,910
is it the good one,

4078
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:44,440
the bad one?

4079
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:47,820
Is it the fun healthy one
or is it the one that is a,

4080
01:54:47,821 --> 01:54:48,640
you know,

4081
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:50,950
completely obsessed with
yourself and only yourself?

4082
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:51,520
Yeah.

4083
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:53,530
You don't know until you
have these experiences.

4084
01:54:53,531 --> 01:54:54,364
And then the,

4085
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:55,150
the,

4086
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:57,260
the nature of them gets exposed.

4087
01:54:57,261 --> 01:55:00,290
It like takes him down to the
roots and you start thinking about,

4088
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:01,690
well where did all this come from?

4089
01:55:01,691 --> 01:55:02,440
Like is it,

4090
01:55:02,440 --> 01:55:02,951
where's all,

4091
01:55:02,951 --> 01:55:04,120
what's the source of all this?

4092
01:55:04,121 --> 01:55:04,330
Like,

4093
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:04,810
oh,

4094
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:06,160
there's a validation issue.

4095
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:07,060
There's a this issue,

4096
01:55:07,061 --> 01:55:07,960
there's a trust issue,

4097
01:55:07,961 --> 01:55:08,710
there's a,

4098
01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:09,110
you know,

4099
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:10,390
whatever the fuck it is.

4100
01:55:10,391 --> 01:55:15,391
It's swirling out of that
in this unnatural form to
create the negative behavior

4101
01:55:18,671 --> 01:55:22,750
that you are manifesting in your life.

4102
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:23,681
Like it,

4103
01:55:23,681 --> 01:55:25,000
all of it comes from something.

4104
01:55:25,001 --> 01:55:28,290
And one of the things about
psychedelic experiences is it shut it,

4105
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:32,080
like it shuts the ego off for a second
and lets you stand outside of and go look

4106
01:55:32,081 --> 01:55:34,420
with the things Dunia look at this thing.

4107
01:55:34,421 --> 01:55:34,660
Things,

4108
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:35,750
grubs and alia,

4109
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:36,593
it doesn't work.

4110
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:36,911
You know,

4111
01:55:36,911 --> 01:55:37,331
like here's,

4112
01:55:37,331 --> 01:55:38,500
here's a prep for example,

4113
01:55:38,501 --> 01:55:39,430
ego that doesn't work.

4114
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:40,633
Namedropping

4115
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:41,703
okay.

4116
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,380
Like if you're hanging out
with someone and he's like,

4117
01:55:43,381 --> 01:55:43,561
yeah,

4118
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:43,831
you know,

4119
01:55:43,831 --> 01:55:45,390
Sean Penn was over my house last night,

4120
01:55:45,391 --> 01:55:45,650
man.

4121
01:55:45,650 --> 01:55:45,810
Right.

4122
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:47,050
I'm fucking in Ealing

4123
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:47,941
No.

4124
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:51,330
You know what Jeremy Pivot was just
telling me about that last week.

4125
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:52,483
Name dropping,

4126
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,073
why that name

4127
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:58,890
but like it doesn't really work.

4128
01:55:58,940 --> 01:55:59,120
Yeah,

4129
01:55:59,120 --> 01:56:03,480
but everybody knows your name dropping
Steven Spielberg and are pretty tight.

4130
01:56:03,481 --> 01:56:04,020
Like,

4131
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:04,853
yeah.

4132
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:05,791
But it's one thing,

4133
01:56:05,791 --> 01:56:09,030
like if you told me you
went over Sean Penn's house,

4134
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:09,630
I'd be like,

4135
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:09,871
oh,

4136
01:56:09,871 --> 01:56:10,704
what's he like?

4137
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:13,080
Like then it wouldn't be name dropping.

4138
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:14,221
Like if you did it,

4139
01:56:14,221 --> 01:56:15,180
it wouldn't be namedropping dropping.

4140
01:56:15,181 --> 01:56:17,960
Like if you told me like I was
hanging out with Cha with Sean Penn,

4141
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:18,390
I'd be like,

4142
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,320
oh how weird.

4143
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:19,661
Well,

4144
01:56:19,661 --> 01:56:21,100
because it's the beginning of a story.

4145
01:56:21,130 --> 01:56:21,370
Yeah.

4146
01:56:21,370 --> 01:56:22,450
I'm not just going to let that,

4147
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,310
let that hang is a followup.

4148
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:24,511
Yeah,

4149
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:25,620
that's not your whole thing.

4150
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:26,340
Yeah.

4151
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:26,641
Right.

4152
01:56:26,641 --> 01:56:30,930
So like comedy is like
name dropping with stories,

4153
01:56:31,290 --> 01:56:32,390
good stories that go with it.

4154
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:33,321
But you know,

4155
01:56:33,321 --> 01:56:38,321
there are comedians that are really like
guileless about just bringing a name in

4156
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:43,690
or bringing up a project they worked on
and you look back at the joke and ego.

4157
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,900
Could it told that joke without telling
me that a Frank Sinatra was in the

4158
01:56:47,901 --> 01:56:48,830
audience that night?

4159
01:56:48,890 --> 01:56:49,723
Yes,

4160
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:50,623
exactly.

4161
01:56:50,830 --> 01:56:51,663
Yeah.

4162
01:56:51,890 --> 01:56:55,970
And I remember Anthony Clarke used to
do that when he was coming up in Boston.

4163
01:56:55,971 --> 01:56:56,840
He was the guy,

4164
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,070
he was the guy,

4165
01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:00,650
the young hot guy in Boston.

4166
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:01,503
Dude.

4167
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:02,870
And I mean that dude,

4168
01:57:02,871 --> 01:57:06,920
you put his name on a marquee and he was
fucking one year out of college and he

4169
01:57:06,921 --> 01:57:10,670
was this cute guy with a southern
accent and the baseball cap on.

4170
01:57:10,671 --> 01:57:15,560
And he was silly and he would fill
up a fucking room and he would just,

4171
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:20,360
and then he started to get some success
and it always found his way in his act.

4172
01:57:20,361 --> 01:57:21,110
He would talk about,

4173
01:57:21,110 --> 01:57:21,351
yeah,

4174
01:57:21,351 --> 01:57:21,771
you know,

4175
01:57:21,771 --> 01:57:22,400
uh,

4176
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:26,960
I was talking to this act or when I
was doing Chicago on Broadway and uh,

4177
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:27,261
no,

4178
01:57:27,261 --> 01:57:27,951
not Chicago.

4179
01:57:27,951 --> 01:57:28,051
What,

4180
01:57:28,051 --> 01:57:28,720
what did he do?

4181
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:29,450
Oklahoma,

4182
01:57:29,450 --> 01:57:34,450
he did Oklahoma on Broadway when
he was like 24 years old and,

4183
01:57:35,690 --> 01:57:36,411
and you know,

4184
01:57:36,411 --> 01:57:40,370
and then he just started and he got in
with that with the river Phoenix and he

4185
01:57:40,371 --> 01:57:44,060
did like three river Phoenix
movies and he was fucking good.

4186
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:49,620
And then somehow he got into the TV
route and didn't follow the film.

4187
01:57:49,730 --> 01:57:50,180
But he's,

4188
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:51,200
he's a good actor.

4189
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:51,851
Yeah,

4190
01:57:51,851 --> 01:57:56,820
I remember he had Boston common number
that Boston common and that didn't go.

4191
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:57,900
It went for a little while,

4192
01:57:57,901 --> 01:58:00,630
but it got canceled and it was
a show that was all his right.

4193
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:01,620
And then he went to do.

4194
01:58:01,621 --> 01:58:02,454
Yes dear.

4195
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:02,911
They did?

4196
01:58:02,911 --> 01:58:03,731
Yes dear for a long,

4197
01:58:03,731 --> 01:58:04,680
long time.

4198
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:05,140
No.

4199
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:06,570
Then he did one with Dan Akroyd.

4200
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:07,140
Oh he did?

4201
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:08,760
Where Dan Akroyd was a priest.

4202
01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:10,110
I maybe they were both priests.

4203
01:58:10,230 --> 01:58:10,570
Really?

4204
01:58:10,570 --> 01:58:11,403
Yeah.

4205
01:58:12,110 --> 01:58:17,100
That might've been af cause cause
a yes dear was on for a good seven,

4206
01:58:17,101 --> 01:58:17,760
eight years.

4207
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:18,330
Easily.

4208
01:58:18,330 --> 01:58:18,960
Forever.

4209
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:19,793
Yeah.

4210
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:22,410
Soloman Soloman.

4211
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:23,770
Soloman.

4212
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:24,570
Huh.

4213
01:58:24,570 --> 01:58:26,760
So that dude and his,

4214
01:58:26,761 --> 01:58:31,761
his quote per episode was very high from
the get go and he just kept buying real

4215
01:58:32,491 --> 01:58:33,324
estate.

4216
01:58:34,170 --> 01:58:34,591
Well done.

4217
01:58:34,591 --> 01:58:35,700
That's what he does know.

4218
01:58:35,701 --> 01:58:36,534
Right.

4219
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:37,450
I haven't,

4220
01:58:37,450 --> 01:58:38,640
I haven't talked to him in a while.

4221
01:58:38,890 --> 01:58:39,900
I think I heard his soul's rules.

4222
01:58:39,901 --> 01:58:40,500
Didn't know.

4223
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:41,333
Yeah.

4224
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,120
I was like Anthony,

4225
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:47,710
he was a murderer or back in Boston and
it used to see him at Faneuil hall and

4226
01:58:47,711 --> 01:58:49,030
you'd fill that fucking place.

4227
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:51,050
You know the comedy
connection when they moved,

4228
01:58:51,051 --> 01:58:51,701
when Bloomin' right.

4229
01:58:51,701 --> 01:58:54,670
Took over and they moved to the big room
and they moved out of that little tiny

4230
01:58:54,671 --> 01:58:56,440
room and put it in Faneuil hall.

4231
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:00,780
I remember walking through there one
day and Anthony Clark was murder and,

4232
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,990
and I was like,

4233
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:03,220
this is 90% women.

4234
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,513
It's so weird.

4235
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:04,710
Yeah.

4236
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:05,543
At least hat right.

4237
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:06,790
I saw women.

4238
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:07,350
Yeah.

4239
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:07,991
I'll come and see him.

4240
01:59:07,991 --> 01:59:08,950
Guys loved them too.

4241
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:09,813
Don't get me wrong.

4242
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:11,350
But women really loved him.

4243
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:12,610
Thought he was so cute,

4244
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:14,040
you know.

4245
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:17,550
Well they say that's the secret to
being a draw is appeal to women because

4246
01:59:17,551 --> 01:59:18,830
they're the ones that decide what to do,

4247
01:59:18,831 --> 01:59:19,100
right?

4248
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:19,820
Yes.

4249
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:20,600
Yeah.

4250
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:21,433
Right.

4251
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:24,260
Like there's not a whole lot of
chicks begging to go to [inaudible].

4252
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:27,741
Right.

4253
01:59:27,741 --> 01:59:28,574
And if they are,

4254
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:29,390
take them.

4255
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:29,751
That's it.

4256
01:59:29,751 --> 01:59:30,560
That's a good one.

4257
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,130
Yeah.

4258
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:32,720
They want to go see someone cute.

4259
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:36,380
I bet there's like probably
a disproportionate number
of chicks going to see

4260
01:59:36,381 --> 01:59:37,214
aqua man.

4261
01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:38,091
I bet.

4262
01:59:38,091 --> 01:59:38,571
If you allow,

4263
01:59:38,571 --> 01:59:38,901
yeah.

4264
01:59:38,901 --> 01:59:39,734
If you look,

4265
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:44,830
if you looked at the number of women
that want to go see a superhero movie and

4266
01:59:45,201 --> 01:59:45,321
uh,

4267
01:59:45,321 --> 01:59:47,480
the number of women that
want to go see aqua man.

4268
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,081
Yeah.

4269
01:59:48,081 --> 01:59:49,430
It's off the charts.

4270
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:50,630
Aqua man's favor.

4271
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:51,530
Someone should do a study.

4272
01:59:52,370 --> 01:59:53,240
That's a handsome man.

4273
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:53,571
Well,

4274
01:59:53,571 --> 01:59:54,404
he's his name.

4275
01:59:54,650 --> 01:59:55,483
Jason Momoa.

4276
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:57,440
He was bad ass game of Thrones.

4277
01:59:57,470 --> 02:00:00,410
He's a beast to super nice guy too.

4278
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:05,310
I met a guy in a whole foods and
nail sweetheart sorta telling you.

4279
02:00:05,311 --> 02:00:06,021
Oh sweetheart.

4280
02:00:06,021 --> 02:00:06,860
He is like,

4281
02:00:06,861 --> 02:00:07,694
you're so handsome.

4282
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:09,013
It's confusing.

4283
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:12,500
So tall and beautiful and
feeling women are feelings,

4284
02:00:12,501 --> 02:00:12,651
right?

4285
02:00:12,651 --> 02:00:12,771
Yeah.

4286
02:00:12,771 --> 02:00:13,604
Leave that guy.

4287
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:14,623
Yeah.

4288
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:15,973
Yeah.

4289
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:17,180
My wife said it best.

4290

She said he's everybody's type.

02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:20,181

4293

Yeah.

4298
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:30,350
Some girl just Jimmy Fallon.

4299
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:32,130
He's everybody's tight

4300
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,030
and he's a giant and
he's got awesome tattoos.

4301
02:00:38,031 --> 02:00:39,140
The fucking Nice Guy.

4302
02:00:39,141 --> 02:00:40,070
Fucking fuck.

4303
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:41,450
Are those his real tattoos?

4304
02:00:41,451 --> 02:00:42,180
I don't believe so.

4305
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:43,640
I think that's just for aqua man.

4306
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:45,020
That's just tattoos for aqua man.

4307
02:00:45,021 --> 02:00:45,170
What?

4308
02:00:45,170 --> 02:00:46,003
His real tattoos.

4309
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:47,390
He's got a gang of real tattoos.

4310
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:49,700
The forearm ones.

4311
02:00:49,701 --> 02:00:51,080
I think this is real tattoos.

4312
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:51,973
Yeah.

4313
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:55,610
Boy that takes some time and makeup
because if he's doing a role where they

4314
02:00:55,611 --> 02:00:56,444
don't want that,

4315
02:00:57,380 --> 02:00:59,630
that's a lot of time covering
that shit up every day.

4316
02:00:59,910 --> 02:01:01,710
I think they have to
cover up shit with him.

4317
02:01:01,770 --> 02:01:02,603
Yeah,

4318
02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:03,811

02:01:04,621 --> 02:01:07,830
Get on screen that all
those damp and panties.

4321
02:01:07,831 --> 02:01:08,930

02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:13,530

4323
02:01:13,531 --> 02:01:13,890

Whew.

4325
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:15,690
Yeah.

4326
02:01:15,690 --> 02:01:16,560
Girls are going to that movie.

4327
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,660
It's like a crane.

4328
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:20,790
It's like a porn theater in Times
Square in the 70s for women's.

4329
02:01:20,791 --> 02:01:22,110
Probably like slipping there.

4330
02:01:22,111 --> 02:01:22,944
Hands Down,

4331
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:26,610
moisture in the air and yourself
off all these little heaters.

4332
02:01:27,270 --> 02:01:28,710
When you're walking at catch cheaters,

4333
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:30,060
your feet are stuck on the floor.

4334
02:01:30,061 --> 02:01:31,530
You think it's the popcorn butter?

4335
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:32,100
Nope.

4336
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:32,933
Nope,

4337
02:01:33,390 --> 02:01:34,223
nope.

4338
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:35,160
Yeah.

4339
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:35,520
Um,

4340
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,780
how do we get on subject to him?

4341
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:38,641
Aqua man,

4342
02:01:38,641 --> 02:01:39,080
girls,

4343
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:41,930
any car that girls
deciding what to go see it,

4344
02:01:41,931 --> 02:01:42,290

4345
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:42,440
Yeah.

4346
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:43,191
Girls would be,

4347
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:43,671
they'd be like,

4348
02:01:43,671 --> 02:01:44,000

4349
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:44,900
let's go see aqua man.

4350
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,231
You'd be like,

4351
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:45,681
wait a minute though.

4352
02:01:45,681 --> 02:01:46,730
You hate superhero movies,

4353
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,350
whatever you want to go.

4354
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,333
Yeah.

4355
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:53,630
Like since she wants to stare
at chase him a mile off.

4356
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:55,133
You're right.

4357
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:58,010
Here's pretty beautiful.

4358
02:01:58,080 --> 02:01:58,913
We watched him on screen,

4359
02:01:58,940 --> 02:01:59,420
dammit.

4360
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:00,020
Yeah.

4361
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:00,800
Shit.

4362
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:01,633
I can't hate her.

4363
02:02:01,670 --> 02:02:03,590
He thinks some lemon
watch MMA for that reason.

4364
02:02:03,591 --> 02:02:04,424
I think some guys,

4365
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:05,930
fuck yeah.

4366
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:07,213
Fuck yeah.

4367
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:08,840
Not only cute but savages.

4368
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:09,703
Right.

4369
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:13,460
I mean the number of women with a

4370
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:19,610
sketchy childhoods that are attracted
to MMA fighters going be off the charts.

4371
02:02:19,611 --> 02:02:20,444
Yeah.

4372
02:02:20,570 --> 02:02:23,420
I want to say that in a very
polite way is pled as I could say.

4373
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:27,110
I think even regular women,

4374
02:02:27,111 --> 02:02:29,870
I think like lawyers like
buttoned down women see,

4375
02:02:29,871 --> 02:02:30,560
uh,

4376
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:30,710
uh,

4377
02:02:30,710 --> 02:02:32,270
cause there are ran neutered men all day.

4378
02:02:32,370 --> 02:02:32,550
Yeah.

4379
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:35,340
You're around a guy like you
know Luke Rockhold is no,

4380
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:40,680
it might be better looking at Jason Momoa
and he's a UFC middleweight champion.

4381
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:42,823
Beautiful.

4382
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:43,851
Six foot three,

4383
02:02:43,851 --> 02:02:44,511
six foot four,

4384
02:02:44,511 --> 02:02:45,231
somewhere in that range.

4385
02:02:45,231 --> 02:02:46,640
Plan features looks like a model.

4386
02:02:47,090 --> 02:02:47,541
Handsome was,

4387
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:48,321

4388
02:02:48,321 --> 02:02:49,154
I want to say to them,

4389
02:02:49,770 --> 02:02:50,360

4390
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:51,193
ass kicker.

4391
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:52,490
That's not the best picture of him,

4392
02:02:52,491 --> 02:02:52,641
Bro.

4393
02:02:52,641 --> 02:02:53,390
That's kind of gets,

4394
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:56,690
that's after I seen before the beast.

4395
02:02:57,380 --> 02:03:02,380
But point is there's Garol and t go

at that handsome bastard.

4397
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:06,150
Look at him.

4398
02:03:06,150 --> 02:03:06,330
He,

4399
02:03:06,330 --> 02:03:06,651

4401
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:09,470
That's the kind of build my wife likes.

4402
02:03:09,471 --> 02:03:13,220
She doesn't like it too big shakes
and like me and him slow down.

4403
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,360
You and him are the same.

4404
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:15,793

has to beat women away from them

4413
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:33,170

4414
02:03:33,171 --> 02:03:34,130
I'm busy.

4415
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:35,450
I am busy.

4416
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:36,381
Go to that picture up there.

4417
02:03:36,381 --> 02:03:37,250
We're just throwing a punch.

4418
02:03:38,570 --> 02:03:39,403
The one right there.

4419
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:40,130
Look at that.

4420
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:40,371
I mean,

4421
02:03:40,371 --> 02:03:40,630
you know what?

4422
02:03:40,630 --> 02:03:42,740
The girls would be begging
to have that inside of them.

4423
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:49,010
I was a woman if I was a heterosexual
woman and I saw that guy and he was like,

4424
02:03:49,011 --> 02:03:50,060

4425
02:03:50,061 --> 02:03:50,421

4426
02:03:50,421 --> 02:03:51,350

4427
02:03:51,351 --> 02:03:52,160
I'd like a drink.

4428
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:52,490
Yeah.

4429
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:53,810
God Damn you savage.

4430
02:03:53,811 --> 02:03:54,531
Let's do this.

4431
02:03:54,531 --> 02:03:56,420
He I want to drank and
we haven't had after you.

4432
02:03:56,421 --> 02:03:57,020
Fuck me.

4433
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:57,290
Yeah.

4434
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:58,101
I don't want to get too drunk.

4435
02:03:58,101 --> 02:03:59,120
I want to feel it still.

4436
02:03:59,780 --> 02:04:00,613
Woo.

4437
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:01,483
Yeah.

4438
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:03,760
And they go after it.

4439
02:04:03,761 --> 02:04:05,270
The I or some of the players?

4440
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:06,133
Some of the fighters.

4441
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:06,291
Oh,

4442
02:04:06,291 --> 02:04:07,350
I don't want to talk about that.

4443
02:04:08,090 --> 02:04:10,490
All right there you kiss and tell.

4444
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:13,880
But it's one other thing is
interesting is female fighters,

4445
02:04:14,030 --> 02:04:14,480
right?

4446
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:18,350
That I was reading a story
about a husband who's white,

4447
02:04:18,351 --> 02:04:19,071
who's a trainer,

4448
02:04:19,071 --> 02:04:19,401
I think,

4449
02:04:19,401 --> 02:04:23,030
and his wife was a boxer and I
was reading the story about him,

4450
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:25,130
like his experience,

4451
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:27,800
like bringing her to the ring,

4452
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:28,630
like getting her,

4453
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:33,010
his wife is in there and she's going to
knuckle up with some other chicken shit

4454
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,880
and maybe get really fucking hurt.

4455
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:35,510
Yeah.

4456
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,280
And to be there while
this is all happening.

4457
02:04:38,570 --> 02:04:39,200
Okay.

4458
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:40,130
That's a wild,

4459
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:41,330
that's a wild life.

4460
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:44,540
A female fighter is a wild creature.

4461
02:04:44,810 --> 02:04:46,220
You gotta think of male fighter.

4462
02:04:46,221 --> 02:04:48,230
It's like almost all boys,

4463
02:04:48,830 --> 02:04:53,830
somewhere in the back of their head have
this ridiculous fantasy of being able

4464
02:04:54,141 --> 02:04:55,220
to fuck everybody up.

4465
02:04:55,410 --> 02:04:56,870
Like come on bitch.

4466
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:57,351
You know,

4467
02:04:57,351 --> 02:05:00,590
fight a bunch of people like Goddamn
Chuck Norris movie and Karate Kick People.

4468
02:05:00,591 --> 02:05:01,424
That would be cool.

4469
02:05:01,670 --> 02:05:03,220
It's just the reality of
learning how to do that.

4470
02:05:03,221 --> 02:05:03,470
It's like,

4471
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:03,830
oh,

4472
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:04,670
I don't want to do that.

4473
02:05:04,671 --> 02:05:05,660
That's too much.

4474
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:08,060
It's too dangerous to scare fuck this,

4475
02:05:08,061 --> 02:05:09,170
and most people don't do it.

4476
02:05:09,890 --> 02:05:12,470
But for women to have that,

4477
02:05:12,471 --> 02:05:16,850
it's probably way more rare to have
this desire to secretly fuck people up.

4478
02:05:17,030 --> 02:05:18,140
Probably way more rare.

4479
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:22,130
Maybe like let's be
generous and say 20% of the,

4480
02:05:22,131 --> 02:05:26,840
the number that men would want to fuck
people are maybe 20% of that is like the

4481
02:05:26,841 --> 02:05:27,920
number that would be women.

4482
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:30,050
So then how many of
them go through with it?

4483
02:05:30,110 --> 02:05:30,530
Yeah.

4484
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:34,910
How many of them go through with it and
get to be like a cat Zingano or get to

4485
02:05:34,911 --> 02:05:37,280
be like an Amanda Nunez like Jesus Christ.

4486
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:39,200
If that number is so small,

4487
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:41,720
so small in terms of
like general population,

4488
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:44,330
those are some wild humans.

4489
02:05:44,331 --> 02:05:44,780
Yeah.

4490
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:48,560
If they get to that stage where they're
fighting in a fucking cage for a living,

4491
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:49,700
whoa.

4492
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:50,390
Yeah.

4493
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:51,530
Someone like Holly Holm,

4494
02:05:51,610 --> 02:05:54,290
like that is a crazy way to make a living.

4495
02:05:54,350 --> 02:05:55,183
Yeah.

4496
02:05:55,630 --> 02:05:55,931
Yeah.

4497
02:05:55,931 --> 02:05:57,500
Now you've got to think
if they make it that far,

4498
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:59,260
even more vicious than
men because they've,

4499
02:05:59,320 --> 02:05:59,800
they've,

4500
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:00,131
you know,

4501
02:06:00,131 --> 02:06:00,311
they,

4502
02:06:00,311 --> 02:06:02,710
there's such a social taboo for them.

4503
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:03,431
For men,

4504
02:06:03,431 --> 02:06:03,850
it's like,

4505
02:06:03,850 --> 02:06:03,971
oh,

4506
02:06:03,971 --> 02:06:04,781
that's bad ass.

4507
02:06:04,781 --> 02:06:05,620
You're an MMA fighter.

4508
02:06:05,621 --> 02:06:06,454
But for women,

4509
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:09,370
everybody just thinks it's weird and
they think there's something wrong with

4510
02:06:09,371 --> 02:06:09,610
you.

4511
02:06:09,610 --> 02:06:09,791
Well,

4512
02:06:09,791 --> 02:06:11,050
it's become more acceptable,

4513
02:06:11,051 --> 02:06:12,220
but it's still terrifying,

4514
02:06:12,250 --> 02:06:13,810
especially for men that don't train,

4515
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:17,470
like to wait for a man who doesn't
train and he's like around Misha Tate,

4516
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:19,870
she's really hot and she
had also fuck people.

4517
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:21,390
Like Ooh,

4518
02:06:21,560 --> 02:06:22,060
yeah,

4519
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:23,140
they get weirded out.

4520
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:27,310
Like imagine that girl could fuck you
up like she's hot and she could fuck you

4521
02:06:27,311 --> 02:06:28,144
up.

4522
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:29,623
That's not nice.

4523
02:06:29,810 --> 02:06:34,410
Some guys probably love that people
like that bondage with are tied up and

4524
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:34,880
right.

4525
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:35,690
Overpowered.

4526
02:06:35,690 --> 02:06:39,260
But what are the odds that a girl who
knows what the fuck people up is looking

4527
02:06:39,261 --> 02:06:39,411
for?

4528
02:06:39,411 --> 02:06:42,260
That kind of guy at almost zero.

4529
02:06:42,290 --> 02:06:42,741
Yeah,

4530
02:06:42,741 --> 02:06:43,490
that's true.

4531
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:44,080
Those girls will,

4532
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:44,960
it doesn't line up.

4533
02:06:44,961 --> 02:06:47,900
Luke Rockhold looked at and
get stuffed by another alpha.

4534
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:49,700
That would be a good porn movie,

4535
02:06:49,701 --> 02:06:50,534
right?

4536
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:54,690
Shit Day to do his bank.

4537
02:06:54,691 --> 02:06:55,910
It like Luke Rockhold,

4538
02:06:55,911 --> 02:07:00,380
you chew a lot of porn and bank it and
then have it released after he's retired

4539
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:01,243
from his career.

4540
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:01,670
Yeah.

4541
02:07:01,670 --> 02:07:01,950
You know,

4542
02:07:01,950 --> 02:07:03,290
cause right now it's just
going to get in the way.

4543
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:03,710
Yeah.

4544
02:07:03,710 --> 02:07:04,760
Excuse me to be a distraction.

4545
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:05,613
Right.

4546
02:07:05,870 --> 02:07:08,450
But he knows that's his 401k my porn.

4547
02:07:10,430 --> 02:07:11,263
Yeah.

4548
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:12,613
Um,

4549
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:14,701
yeah.

4550
02:07:14,701 --> 02:07:15,534
It's uh,

4551
02:07:15,630 --> 02:07:18,780
the numbers of a women
that become elite fighters.

4552
02:07:18,930 --> 02:07:21,150
I wonder what it is in
terms of like the amount,

4553
02:07:21,151 --> 02:07:25,050
the try it and then the amount
that become fully successful.

4554
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:27,610
I bet it's a tiny,

4555
02:07:27,611 --> 02:07:30,340
tiny percentage like to
get all the way through.

4556
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:31,713
Like how many,

4557
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:33,430
like how many men,

4558
02:07:33,431 --> 02:07:33,851
when you,

4559
02:07:33,851 --> 02:07:34,601
when you were growing up,

4560
02:07:34,601 --> 02:07:35,434
how many,

4561
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,010
uh,

4562
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:41,010
either wanted to learn how to box
or wrestle or do some kind of marsh.

4563
02:07:41,121 --> 02:07:42,160
A lot of wrestlers.

4564
02:07:42,161 --> 02:07:42,550
Yeah.

4565
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:43,220
Yeah.

4566
02:07:43,220 --> 02:07:44,590
I mean it was a school sport.

4567
02:07:45,090 --> 02:07:47,400
There was taekwondo and
there was wrestling.

4568
02:07:47,401 --> 02:07:49,140
Those are pretty much
the only forms that I,

4569
02:07:49,170 --> 02:07:49,711
that I saw.

4570
02:07:49,711 --> 02:07:51,150
We didn't have boxing in my town,

4571
02:07:51,320 --> 02:07:53,360
but a lot of kids you knew were into it,

4572
02:07:53,361 --> 02:07:53,570
right?

4573
02:07:53,570 --> 02:07:54,110
Oh yeah.

4574
02:07:54,110 --> 02:07:54,530
Yeah.

4575
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:55,363
How many girls?

4576
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:58,263
Okay.

4577
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:00,010
I can't think of any.

4578
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:01,233
Super rare,

4579
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:04,420
but the martial arts classes
did have a lot of girls.

4580
02:08:04,690 --> 02:08:05,650
It was kind of interesting.

4581
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:06,670
It was a good number.

4582
02:08:06,671 --> 02:08:07,630
It wasn't half,

4583
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:10,780
but it might've been 20% yeah.

4584
02:08:10,810 --> 02:08:14,050
It might be 20% women that were in those
classes cause they wanted to learn self

4585
02:08:14,051 --> 02:08:14,710
defense,

4586
02:08:14,710 --> 02:08:15,543
you know?

4587
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:16,610
Okay.

4588
02:08:16,610 --> 02:08:21,230
I put my daughter in taekwondo
just she wasn't that into it,

4589
02:08:21,231 --> 02:08:22,370
but I go just do a year.

4590
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:26,900
Just to give you some sense of
facing somebody if a fight happens.

4591
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:27,830
Yeah.

4592
02:08:27,830 --> 02:08:30,870
And some sense of what it's like to
struggle with someone physically there

4593
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:31,191
moving.

4594
02:08:31,191 --> 02:08:32,001
You got to move with them.

4595
02:08:32,001 --> 02:08:32,834
You got to,

4596
02:08:33,380 --> 02:08:34,760
the older you are,

4597
02:08:34,790 --> 02:08:35,860
when you start learning that,

4598
02:08:35,870 --> 02:08:38,210
the more difficult it is to
incorporate it into your,

4599
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:39,350
the way you think about things.

4600
02:08:39,380 --> 02:08:39,760
Right.

4601
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:40,581
I think when you're young,

4602
02:08:40,581 --> 02:08:42,770
if you have some experience
with martial arts,

4603
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:46,940
you'll be more calm and confident if
something happens when you get older.

4604
02:08:46,970 --> 02:08:47,300
Right.

4605
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:48,480
You're already your bodies.

4606
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:50,780
You develop knowing how to move that way.

4607
02:08:50,930 --> 02:08:51,440
Yeah.

4608
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:55,070
When you were already like kind of set
in your ways and you're injured and

4609
02:08:55,071 --> 02:08:57,440
you're old and then someone wants
to teach you a wheel kick like,

4610
02:08:57,470 --> 02:08:58,131
oh Christ.

4611
02:08:58,131 --> 02:08:58,850
Yeah.

4612
02:08:58,850 --> 02:09:00,560
Like there's no way my
body is going to do that.

4613
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:00,980
Right.

4614
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:02,090
My body has move like that.

4615
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:02,690
Yeah.

4616
02:09:02,690 --> 02:09:05,560
It's like you being able
to do backflips click.

4617
02:09:05,570 --> 02:09:06,770
You could still do a backflip,

4618
02:09:07,580 --> 02:09:09,830
your body learn how to do
that when you were young.

4619
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:10,240
Yup.

4620
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:12,220
It gets in there that programs in there

4621
02:09:12,430 --> 02:09:12,970
and there's a,

4622
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:17,110
there's a moment of faith when you do a
back flip where when you go up you have

4623
02:09:17,111 --> 02:09:21,250
to go up before you go back and that's
the first mistake and the constant

4624
02:09:21,251 --> 02:09:22,570
mistake is people,

4625
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:27,250
people go to do a backflip and they lunge
backwards and they land in their head,

4626
02:09:27,251 --> 02:09:30,910
but you really have to trust that
you have to shoot your hands up,

4627
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:31,900
not back,

4628
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:33,880
and then you pull it in,

4629
02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:35,860
go over damn scary.

4630
02:09:35,950 --> 02:09:37,280
And that's like that with the,

4631
02:09:37,340 --> 02:09:40,630
I'm sure with martial arts is this
moves it or does a moment of faith.

4632
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:42,930
When I don't train for a long time,

4633
02:09:42,931 --> 02:09:46,140
then I try to do a turning
side kick on the heavy bag.

4634
02:09:46,290 --> 02:09:47,160
There's like a moment like,

4635
02:09:47,161 --> 02:09:47,431
okay,

4636
02:09:47,431 --> 02:09:48,151
I'm going to hit this thing.

4637
02:09:48,151 --> 02:09:48,870
Right.

4638
02:09:48,870 --> 02:09:49,700
What am I doing here?

4639
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:50,200
I'm still rolling.

4640
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:50,550
Yes.

4641
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:50,941
Okay.

4642
02:09:50,941 --> 02:09:52,260
Ready and turn.

4643
02:09:52,570 --> 02:09:53,403
Let's drop something.

4644
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:53,880
Oh,

4645
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:56,490
I just dropped this big ass knife.

4646
02:09:56,550 --> 02:09:57,300
Shit.

4647
02:09:57,300 --> 02:09:58,560
That's not good to have
around right there.

4648
02:09:59,910 --> 02:10:03,210
What am I 12 keep this big
giant knife on the table.

4649
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:04,261
But yeah,

4650
02:10:04,261 --> 02:10:04,710
when I,

4651
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:06,030
when I do it today to this day,

4652
02:10:06,031 --> 02:10:06,261
okay.

4653
02:10:06,261 --> 02:10:08,520
I have to do it slow a couple
times and get the feel of it.

4654
02:10:08,521 --> 02:10:08,710
Yeah.

4655
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:10,830
I haven't trained in a while
and then all right then,

4656
02:10:10,860 --> 02:10:12,000
then it becomes a normal thing.

4657
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:12,860
Right.

4658
02:10:12,860 --> 02:10:13,291
But man,

4659
02:10:13,291 --> 02:10:14,940
it's hell on your fucking knees.

4660
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:16,800
I've got a new knee thing going on,

4661
02:10:17,070 --> 02:10:17,903
like the zoo.

4662
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:21,780
The third time I've had to get stem
cells injected into this meniscus tear.

4663
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:26,760
I couldn't really hear this little
tiny meniscus tear and it develops into

4664
02:10:26,761 --> 02:10:27,594
assist,

4665
02:10:28,250 --> 02:10:28,530
uh,

4666
02:10:28,530 --> 02:10:28,741
the,

4667
02:10:28,741 --> 02:10:29,311
the tear,

4668
02:10:29,311 --> 02:10:32,370
we've hit it with stem cells a few
times and it doesn't give me any pain

4669
02:10:32,371 --> 02:10:32,840
anymore.

4670
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:36,230
But assist keeps developing
in that area and it assists,

4671
02:10:36,231 --> 02:10:37,700
has to get punctured and drain.

4672
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:39,740
It's getting smaller and smaller.

4673
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:41,970
It happened three different times where I,

4674
02:10:41,971 --> 02:10:42,770
how to get it drained.

4675
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:47,750
And the last time was a few days ago
and it was the smallest it's ever been,

4676
02:10:47,751 --> 02:10:49,460
but still fucking annoying.

4677
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:50,870
But you're still running.

4678
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:52,033
Yup.

4679
02:10:52,110 --> 02:10:53,090
It doesn't hurt when you run.

4680
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:56,360
I'm taking time off right now and taking
a little bit of time off right now.

4681
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:58,380
I'm going to tell you a
couple of weeks off and a,

4682
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:01,220
I'm going to run at a slower pace,

4683
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:05,660
skip the dog some exercise and I'm going
to be more just more cautious about it.

4684
02:11:05,661 --> 02:11:06,680
Not going to push myself.

4685
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:11,180
I'm trying to figure out what it is I'm
doing that's causing this sis to recur.

4686
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:16,130
I think it's just overall
pounding of the hill running,

4687
02:11:16,131 --> 02:11:17,870
kicking the bag and all that shit.

4688
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:18,260
Yeah.

4689
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:19,041
I need to,

4690
02:11:19,041 --> 02:11:19,430
uh,

4691
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:23,390
let it fully set in before I
go back to doing that shit.

4692
02:11:23,391 --> 02:11:25,310
So I'm just doing a bunch of
other different stuff now.

4693
02:11:25,311 --> 02:11:27,440
A lot of yoga is the cryogenics help.

4694
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:28,471
Um,

4695
02:11:28,471 --> 02:11:29,540
it'll help someone,

4696
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:29,841
you know,

4697
02:11:29,841 --> 02:11:32,510
what would cryogenics is really
good for is first of all,

4698
02:11:32,511 --> 02:11:33,740
it's really good for your mood.

4699
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:34,401
Uh,

4700
02:11:34,401 --> 02:11:35,960
if you've never done it before,

4701
02:11:36,050 --> 02:11:37,940
the best kind are the kind where you're,

4702
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:39,350
you get your whole body in there,

4703
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:42,170
not just your neck down
the neck down is okay.

4704
02:11:42,350 --> 02:11:43,580
It's definitely better than nothing,

4705
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:48,910
but the real feeling is when your
head's under and your whole body is like

4706
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:53,930
immersed in this air that's
cooled by liquid nitrogen,

4707
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:56,300
it's fucking for raising dude.

4708
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:57,183
And you done it.

4709
02:11:57,290 --> 02:11:59,570
Now let's do it today.

4710
02:11:59,660 --> 02:11:59,871
Yeah,

4711
02:11:59,871 --> 02:12:00,260
I'll do it.

4712
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:00,800
We'll do it today.

4713
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:01,151
Okay.

4714
02:12:01,151 --> 02:12:01,984
We're can do it today.

4715
02:12:02,270 --> 02:12:03,050
You're going to love it.

4716
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:04,520
It's a freak out man.

4717
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:05,510
It's a freak out.

4718
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:06,591
How long did he stay in?

4719
02:12:06,591 --> 02:12:07,430
40 minutes.

4720
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:10,700
And then I sit down for 10 minutes
and then I do another three minutes.

4721
02:12:11,490 --> 02:12:12,020
Damn.

4722
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:12,560
Yeah.

4723
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:15,320
You feel amazing afterwards
and they'll fix my knee.

4724
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:16,110
Well,

4725
02:12:16,110 --> 02:12:16,943
won't fix it.

4726
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,290
It'll reduce inflammation now,

4727
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:20,030
but nor epinephrin
that's what it's called,

4728
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:20,300
right?

4729
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:21,290
Is that the word?

4730
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:23,173
Sure.

4731
02:12:23,820 --> 02:12:24,410
Um,

4732
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:28,070
that stuff gets radically
boosted in your brain.

4733
02:12:28,310 --> 02:12:30,080
It helps a lot of people with arthritis.

4734
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:31,430
A lot of people who have,

4735
02:12:31,431 --> 02:12:31,700
um,

4736
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:33,020
a lot of inflammation.

4737
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:34,580
It helps them is that
I say I said it right.

4738
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:35,600
Um,

4739
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:36,500
it ramps that shit up.

4740
02:12:36,501 --> 02:12:38,450
You feel so good when you
get out of there like woo.

4741
02:12:38,451 --> 02:12:41,360
It lasts a while to Ah,

4742
02:12:41,410 --> 02:12:42,710
you're just freezing to death.

4743
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:45,140
You are freezing to death.

4744
02:12:45,141 --> 02:12:47,810
You were on your way to death and
he step out of it and you're like,

4745
02:12:47,811 --> 02:12:48,680
wow.

4746
02:12:48,710 --> 02:12:49,071
And it just,

4747
02:12:49,071 --> 02:12:51,620
everything just feels woo la.

4748
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:52,761
Yeah.

4749
02:12:52,761 --> 02:12:53,780
It feels good man.

4750
02:12:53,781 --> 02:12:54,650
It feels good.

4751
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:55,520
Yeah,

4752
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:56,090
I saw him.

4753
02:12:56,090 --> 02:12:58,220
I fucking love swimming in cold water.

4754
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:01,460
It's amazing for you the the way
you feel when you get out too.

4755
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:02,780
But here's the thing.

4756
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:03,590
Um,

4757
02:13:03,590 --> 02:13:08,590
it's not the best thing to do if
you're trying to gain muscle weight.

4758
02:13:10,490 --> 02:13:12,980
You have to wait a while
after the exercise.

4759
02:13:12,981 --> 02:13:13,700
Like there's,

4760
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:14,610
apparently there's,

4761
02:13:14,630 --> 02:13:18,170
there's a bunch of different studies and
I know Andy Galpin has been involved in

4762
02:13:18,171 --> 02:13:19,490
a bunch of these studies and Rhonda,

4763
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:22,010
Patrick has discussed some
of this research as well.

4764
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:22,861
But what,

4765
02:13:22,861 --> 02:13:22,970
uh,

4766
02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:26,030
what happens is there's a window
of time after you lift weights.

4767
02:13:26,031 --> 02:13:26,161
We,

4768
02:13:26,161 --> 02:13:31,161
you should just leave your body alone and
not ice anything and that this is more

4769
02:13:32,371 --> 02:13:37,371
beneficial to gaining
strength and explosiveness
and mass and stuff like that.

4770
02:13:37,740 --> 02:13:39,990
But that after a window of time,

4771
02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:45,020
then it's beneficial to get into the fro
the ice bath or to do cryo or something

4772
02:13:46,231 --> 02:13:46,740
like that.

4773
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:48,990
But you want to give yourself your body,

4774
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:49,400
uh,

4775
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:53,670
a period of time to
physiologically adjust to the work.

4776
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:56,160
Like your body knows what's happened.

4777
02:13:56,550 --> 02:13:58,080
Oh Greg did dead lifts today.

4778
02:13:58,590 --> 02:13:59,190
Okay,

4779
02:13:59,190 --> 02:13:59,611
okay,

4780
02:13:59,611 --> 02:13:59,911
okay.

4781
02:13:59,911 --> 02:14:01,650
We got all the way to
get everything in place,

4782
02:14:01,651 --> 02:14:01,900
get it.

4783
02:14:01,900 --> 02:14:03,540
But if you freeze it right there,

4784
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:06,270
then it has an effect on the overall,

4785
02:14:06,410 --> 02:14:07,590
and I might be butchering this,

4786
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:11,430
but I think it has effect on the overall
amount of gains that you can make.

4787
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:12,293
Okay.

4788
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,800
Cause your body's not sending
the chemicals to the muscle.

4789
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:14,891
Well,

4790
02:14:14,891 --> 02:14:16,790
the way it would see if he could find out.

4791
02:14:16,791 --> 02:14:17,540
That's true.

4792
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:18,373
Um,

4793
02:14:18,410 --> 02:14:19,243
that's uh,

4794
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:20,780
figured out how to Google that one.

4795
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:22,040
How do you agree with that one?

4796
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:23,270
Yeah.

4797
02:14:23,270 --> 02:14:24,180
Post workout.

4798
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:24,970
Um,

4799
02:14:24,970 --> 02:14:28,790
cryo therapy and hypertrophy
cause that's what they're,

4800
02:14:29,570 --> 02:14:31,220
that's what they're trying to uh,

4801
02:14:31,550 --> 02:14:31,870
Dick,

4802
02:14:31,870 --> 02:14:34,700
they were trying to figure out whether
or not it's beneficial or not in that

4803
02:14:34,701 --> 02:14:35,534
case.

4804
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:40,880
So they think that it's really good for
the mood and it's really good for people

4805
02:14:40,881 --> 02:14:42,410
with joint issues.

4806
02:14:42,411 --> 02:14:44,330
A lot of the folks that go there,

4807
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:49,540
they have like a back surgery or back
issues and it gives them a lot of relief.

4808
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:51,020
And you can do it every day too,

4809
02:14:51,021 --> 02:14:52,130
cause it's only three minutes.

4810
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:54,560
The thing about something
like that as it's not,

4811
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:56,390
it's not like any other kind of therapy.

4812
02:14:56,391 --> 02:14:57,650
Like you can't do it any longer.

4813
02:14:57,680 --> 02:14:59,510
It's not like you're being a pussy
because you're only doing it for three

4814
02:14:59,511 --> 02:15:00,320
minutes.

4815
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:00,561
Bitch,

4816
02:15:00,561 --> 02:15:03,200
you can't even do three minutes the
first time you go in there at two minutes

4817
02:15:03,201 --> 02:15:03,411
you're like,

4818
02:15:03,411 --> 02:15:04,244
fuck this.

4819
02:15:04,390 --> 02:15:04,940
Yeah.

4820
02:15:04,940 --> 02:15:06,230
Oh my God.

4821
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:06,531
Yeah.

4822
02:15:06,531 --> 02:15:08,120
At two minutes you're
probably ready to bail.

4823
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:10,430
But then your body will get used to
it and then you can do three minutes.

4824
02:15:10,431 --> 02:15:12,230
But it's a,

4825
02:15:12,231 --> 02:15:13,280
it's very controversial,

4826
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:14,990
but especially because a woman died,

4827
02:15:15,620 --> 02:15:16,220
there was war.

4828
02:15:16,220 --> 02:15:16,701
Vegas.

4829
02:15:16,701 --> 02:15:17,031
Yeah.

4830
02:15:17,031 --> 02:15:20,200
A woman in Vegas was
operating it herself and uh,

4831
02:15:20,210 --> 02:15:25,210
apparently she was not in the right
height and the liquid nitrogen was getting

4832
02:15:26,901 --> 02:15:27,440
into her,

4833
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:28,011
her lungs.

4834
02:15:28,011 --> 02:15:31,280
She was breathing it in and she passed
out and she passed out and froze to

4835
02:15:31,281 --> 02:15:32,060
death.

4836
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:32,720
Wow.

4837
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:33,050
Yeah.

4838
02:15:33,050 --> 02:15:33,883
Terrifying.

4839
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:34,440
They,

4840
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:35,360
she had,

4841
02:15:35,450 --> 02:15:36,160
uh,

4842
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:36,500
again,

4843
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:40,240
I think the story was that she
had worked there and you know,

4844
02:15:40,250 --> 02:15:45,250
she was after hours just doing therapy
on herself and she fucking fell asleep in

4845
02:15:45,861 --> 02:15:46,694
there.

4846
02:15:47,210 --> 02:15:48,680
He should never do that by herself.

4847
02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:50,410
If you do it at a reputable place,

4848
02:15:50,411 --> 02:15:52,670
will always be someone standing
by watching while you're in.

4849
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:55,460
They stand outside the door
while you're inside of it.

4850
02:15:56,730 --> 02:15:57,563
Scary though,

4851
02:15:57,920 --> 02:15:59,330
because you realize when
you're in there you're like,

4852
02:15:59,331 --> 02:16:00,350
this is a,

4853
02:16:00,740 --> 02:16:03,920
this is something you can't
survive for that long.

4854
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:05,450
You can survive it for a few minutes,

4855
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:06,530
but you,

4856
02:16:06,530 --> 02:16:10,670
you're literally exposing yourself to
something that is 100% fatal if you stay

4857
02:16:10,671 --> 02:16:11,030
in it.

4858
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:11,863
Yeah.

4859
02:16:12,150 --> 02:16:12,241
No,

4860
02:16:12,241 --> 02:16:13,170
it's like cold water.

4861
02:16:13,650 --> 02:16:15,360
You don't have to be
in freezing cold water.

4862
02:16:15,361 --> 02:16:20,361
They say the amount of hours
you can survive in water
is like surprisingly warm.

4863
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:22,850
Yeah.

4864
02:16:22,850 --> 02:16:25,290
It fits like in the forties,

4865
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:27,810
you can die after a couple hours.

4866
02:16:27,830 --> 02:16:28,170
Yup.

4867
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:29,620
I'm throwing numbers out but

4868
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:30,930
no surprising.

4869
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:31,660
Yeah.

4870
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:35,180
The getting wet is one of
the most dangerous things
that can ever happen to you

4871
02:16:35,181 --> 02:16:36,740
if you were in the
winter in the mountains.

4872
02:16:36,741 --> 02:16:37,100
Yeah.

4873
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:38,290
It's one of the most dangerous things.

4874
02:16:38,291 --> 02:16:39,200
We fall into water.

4875
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:42,560
They actually have a rewarming
drills that they teach people,

4876
02:16:42,561 --> 02:16:46,520
particularly soldiers and a outdoorsman
that are interested in this shit.

4877
02:16:47,690 --> 02:16:49,030
My friend John Barklow,

4878
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:49,400
uh,

4879
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:50,690
he works for Sitka,

4880
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:54,110
that's a premier outdoor company.

4881
02:16:54,111 --> 02:16:54,944
They make um,

4882
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:55,910
uh,

4883
02:16:55,910 --> 02:16:59,870
hunting clothes and stuff like that and
they have a whole video on how to do a

4884
02:16:59,871 --> 02:17:00,950
rewarming drill.

4885
02:17:00,951 --> 02:17:01,761
And so what he does,

4886
02:17:01,761 --> 02:17:01,851
his,

4887
02:17:01,851 --> 02:17:06,650
him and his friend jump into a frozen
river and they'd go into a tent and heat

4888
02:17:06,651 --> 02:17:07,760
themselves back up again.

4889
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:10,820
Do you watched this?

4890
02:17:10,821 --> 02:17:11,061
And your,

4891
02:17:11,061 --> 02:17:13,340
your whole body just goes ah,

4892
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:16,580
cause you there in the winter
and the jump into a river,

4893
02:17:16,581 --> 02:17:20,600
they've got to move the ice around and
hop in this fucking frozen stream and

4894
02:17:20,601 --> 02:17:24,020
they go all the way under and then they
come out with their soap down and all

4895
02:17:24,021 --> 02:17:24,191
their,

4896
02:17:24,191 --> 02:17:27,860
they're soaked wool clothes and there's
soak synthetics and they get into a

4897
02:17:27,861 --> 02:17:28,221
tent,

4898
02:17:28,221 --> 02:17:28,680
the climate,

4899
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:31,880
their sleeping bags and they
try to heat themselves up.

4900
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:32,953
If you have,

4901
02:17:33,180 --> 02:17:35,210
if you have no access to,

4902
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:35,510
uh,

4903
02:17:35,510 --> 02:17:36,410
a building,

4904
02:17:36,411 --> 02:17:37,220
a house,

4905
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:38,060
no shower,

4906
02:17:38,061 --> 02:17:38,151
no,

4907
02:17:38,151 --> 02:17:38,360
no,

4908
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:39,051
you're fucked.

4909
02:17:39,051 --> 02:17:39,890
You're out in the woods.

4910
02:17:40,340 --> 02:17:42,890
There's very specific things that
you have to do in order to survive.

4911
02:17:43,430 --> 02:17:46,130
If you don't follow the right steps,

4912
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:47,990
you absolutely will die.

4913
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:49,520
Yeah.

4914
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:54,020
It's really common to kills more people
than probably anything in the woods

4915
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:55,650
freezing it.

4916
02:17:55,650 --> 02:17:55,861
Yeah.

4917
02:17:55,861 --> 02:18:00,861
That movie revenant freaked me out just
going into the woods up north for three

4918
02:18:01,831 --> 02:18:06,140
months to collect pelts and you're
walking through fucking streams and it's

4919
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:10,140
pouring rain and he got
no heat or no electricity.

4920
02:18:11,300 --> 02:18:12,440
Fuck that.

4921
02:18:13,010 --> 02:18:13,251
Yeah.

4922
02:18:13,251 --> 02:18:14,270
That's how people died.

4923
02:18:14,830 --> 02:18:16,280
A lot of people live that way too.

4924
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:17,990
A lot of people live
that way until they died.

4925
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:20,960
I mean that.

4926
02:18:21,140 --> 02:18:25,010
Do you think about those people that made
it across this country and the people

4927
02:18:25,011 --> 02:18:30,011
like Lewis and Clark and all of these
pioneers that just didn't even know what

4928
02:18:30,321 --> 02:18:34,190
the fuck was around the next corner and
they just walked on through with what

4929
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:36,320
they have like donkeys
with shit on their back.

4930
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:37,370
How much food do you have?

4931
02:18:37,390 --> 02:18:38,060
Yeah.

4932
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:39,320
Do you even know what
the fuck you're going?

4933
02:18:39,410 --> 02:18:39,550
Yeah,

4934
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:40,490
he hit an impasse.

4935
02:18:40,491 --> 02:18:40,661
You,

4936
02:18:40,661 --> 02:18:44,690
you hike for miles and then you come up
to a mountain and you got to double back

4937
02:18:44,691 --> 02:18:45,560
and go around

4938
02:18:45,690 --> 02:18:46,950
Jesus Christ.

4939
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:48,300
No Google Earth,

4940
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:50,153
no nothing.

4941
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:55,380
Shit maps dog shit maps written by people
you hope knew what the fuck they were

4942
02:18:55,381 --> 02:18:56,100
talking about.

4943
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:56,933
Right.

4944
02:18:57,270 --> 02:18:57,820
You know,

4945
02:18:57,820 --> 02:18:59,610
he'd get maps from native Americans,

4946
02:18:59,611 --> 02:19:00,990
get maps from a sailor,

4947
02:19:01,070 --> 02:19:02,010
try to figure it out,

4948
02:19:03,880 --> 02:19:07,630
and then you randomly go into the wrong
territory and a Indians want to kill

4949
02:19:07,631 --> 02:19:08,010
you.

4950
02:19:08,010 --> 02:19:08,281
You know,

4951
02:19:08,281 --> 02:19:09,210
there's an interesting,

4952
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:11,430
a film that's out on Netflix right now,

4953
02:19:11,431 --> 02:19:12,930
the ballot of Buster Scruggs,

4954
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:14,610
it's movie,

4955
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:15,870
and it's all about that.

4956
02:19:15,900 --> 02:19:16,920
It's all about the old west.

4957
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:18,420
It's really weird,

4958
02:19:18,421 --> 02:19:18,750
man.

4959
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:19,830
It's so weird.

4960
02:19:19,831 --> 02:19:21,300
They're the weirdest guys of all time.

4961
02:19:21,301 --> 02:19:21,820
It turns blue.

4962
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:23,770
The Kahn brothers big Lebowski.

4963
02:19:23,771 --> 02:19:25,050
You one of my all time favorites.

4964
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:26,700
They've just made so many cool,

4965
02:19:26,701 --> 02:19:27,534
weird,

4966
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:28,040
but this one's

4967
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,790
really weird.

4968
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:30,680
It's like a bunch of
non connected stories.

4969
02:19:30,681 --> 02:19:31,580
I thought they were connected,

4970
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:32,121
but they're not.

4971
02:19:32,121 --> 02:19:35,330
They just all taking place in the same
time period and it's called the old west

4972
02:19:35,430 --> 02:19:37,190
and the end pretty similar late.

4973
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:39,960
They're all fucking
dark and you got to go.

4974
02:19:39,961 --> 02:19:40,681
Go into it.

4975
02:19:40,681 --> 02:19:42,060
I would highly recommend it,

4976
02:19:42,061 --> 02:19:45,300
but go into it knowing it's
going to be fucking dark.

4977
02:19:45,301 --> 02:19:46,200
You've got to go there.

4978
02:19:46,650 --> 02:19:47,483
Just accept it.

4979
02:19:47,610 --> 02:19:50,600
But Tom waits his one is fucking amazing.

4980
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:51,570
Yeah,

4981
02:19:51,570 --> 02:19:51,901
Dude.

4982
02:19:51,901 --> 02:19:52,734
Amazing.

4983
02:19:53,010 --> 02:19:53,191
Yeah,

4984
02:19:53,191 --> 02:19:54,660
I thought it was Dick Nolton for a second.

4985
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:55,590
Oh yeah.

4986
02:19:55,590 --> 02:19:55,900
Was done.

4987
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:57,610
It's all right,

4988
02:19:58,140 --> 02:19:58,370
dude.

4989
02:19:58,370 --> 02:19:59,250
It's so good.

4990
02:20:00,050 --> 02:20:00,610
Yeah,

4991
02:20:00,610 --> 02:20:01,120
that one.

4992
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:02,020
That one was really good.

4993
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:03,700
The singer guy who was really good.

4994
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:05,260
I love that he,

4995
02:20:05,290 --> 02:20:05,411
well,

4996
02:20:05,411 --> 02:20:06,141
I don't want to spoil it.

4997
02:20:06,141 --> 02:20:06,690
I don't wanna spoil it,

4998
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:07,331
but now it's,

4999
02:20:07,331 --> 02:20:07,960
yeah,

5000
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:08,620
they're all,

5001
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:09,431
they're all great.

5002
02:20:09,431 --> 02:20:10,270
But at the end of it I was like,

5003
02:20:10,271 --> 02:20:11,590
what the fuck did I just watch?

5004
02:20:11,591 --> 02:20:12,424
Yeah.

5005
02:20:13,810 --> 02:20:16,450
Did you ever watched deadwood on Hbo?

5006
02:20:16,451 --> 02:20:17,101
I never did.

5007
02:20:17,101 --> 02:20:17,934
I never saw that

5008
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:18,640
it,

5009
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:22,760
the thing about deadwood is I watched
it once and they were swearing so much

5010
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:24,740
that my bullshit alarm went off.

5011
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:25,970
That's why I stopped watching.

5012
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:26,511
Yeah.

5013
02:20:26,511 --> 02:20:26,901
I was like,

5014
02:20:26,901 --> 02:20:28,770
I don't think people
talk like that back then.

5015
02:20:28,771 --> 02:20:29,150
Yeah,

5016
02:20:29,150 --> 02:20:32,840
because they didn't talk like that in
the 50s and the 60s see like the trend

5017
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:33,674
doesn't make sense.

5018
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:36,650
If people talked like
that in the wild west,

5019
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:38,300
then what?

5020
02:20:38,301 --> 02:20:39,440
Where did that go?

5021
02:20:39,470 --> 02:20:40,101
Where'd that go?

5022
02:20:40,101 --> 02:20:41,390
That all went into the ether.

5023
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:42,350
Like they had kids,

5024
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:43,640
they raised their children,

5025
02:20:43,641 --> 02:20:47,630
the children around this kind of language
and somehow or another it escaped and

5026
02:20:47,631 --> 02:20:48,740
it went away and it stopped.

5027
02:20:48,741 --> 02:20:49,760
That's not how the world works.

5028
02:20:49,761 --> 02:20:50,300
Right.

5029
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:51,290
The world doesn't work that way.

5030
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:52,760
The world works and the way that,

5031
02:20:52,761 --> 02:20:57,290
like you slowly introduced fucked up
words and then they become like the word

5032
02:20:57,291 --> 02:20:57,920
fuck.

5033
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:02,920
If you said the word fuck on television
in the 1950s you would get arrested,

5034
02:21:03,330 --> 02:21:03,910
right?

5035
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:04,510
Yeah.

5036
02:21:04,510 --> 02:21:06,590
How's that Pasta and on
stage you get arrested,

5037
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:07,490
Lenny Bruce,

5038
02:21:07,490 --> 02:21:08,323
George Carlin.

5039
02:21:08,740 --> 02:21:12,290
How was it possible that that is a hundred
years removed from people saying it

5040
02:21:12,350 --> 02:21:14,390
with abandoned constantly?

5041
02:21:14,870 --> 02:21:15,560
I don't believe it.

5042
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:16,370
Yeah,

5043
02:21:16,370 --> 02:21:21,050
like I think a better example of
what it was probably like his,

5044
02:21:21,051 --> 02:21:23,450
like gangs of New York and then
it's probably more accurate.

5045
02:21:23,451 --> 02:21:24,284
Yeah.

5046
02:21:24,310 --> 02:21:26,000
Like that was probably
what people were like.

5047
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:26,660
Right then.

5048
02:21:26,660 --> 02:21:26,990
Right.

5049
02:21:26,990 --> 02:21:28,340
There were probably brutal as fuck,

5050
02:21:28,490 --> 02:21:31,470
but I bet they didn't swear as
much as we like to think they did.

5051
02:21:32,470 --> 02:21:35,150
The dead wood thing was like
they were using it as a,

5052
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:40,070
I mean maybe I need to go back
and watch it before I talk shit.

5053
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:43,460
But it felt like they were using
it almost like to modernize it.

5054
02:21:44,270 --> 02:21:44,720
Yeah.

5055
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:45,110
Well,

5056
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:45,381
you know,

5057
02:21:45,381 --> 02:21:48,740
they were having these people talk
like scallywags would talk today.

5058
02:21:48,910 --> 02:21:49,743
Right.

5059
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:51,670
They also say cursing is cultural.

5060
02:21:51,671 --> 02:21:52,570
Like if you,

5061
02:21:52,571 --> 02:21:53,321
if you're in a,

5062
02:21:53,321 --> 02:21:54,154
uh,

5063
02:21:54,340 --> 02:21:54,551
you know,

5064
02:21:54,551 --> 02:21:59,551
they talk about how black people curse
versus how Protestants curse his coffee.

5065
02:22:00,820 --> 02:22:01,051
Yeah.

5066
02:22:01,051 --> 02:22:01,884
I'll have some more of that.

5067
02:22:02,290 --> 02:22:02,951
Did you have any,

5068
02:22:02,951 --> 02:22:04,150
we haven't even had a little bit,

5069
02:22:04,230 --> 02:22:06,230
just this article about it says that they,

5070
02:22:06,310 --> 02:22:10,120
they purposely changed the words because
to make it more contemporary because

5071
02:22:10,121 --> 02:22:13,510
people wouldn't have been
buying if they're saying
tarnation and Gold Darren and

5072
02:22:13,511 --> 02:22:14,170
shit like that.

5073
02:22:14,170 --> 02:22:14,590
Yeah,

5074
02:22:14,590 --> 02:22:14,861
yeah.

5075
02:22:14,861 --> 02:22:15,251
There you go.

5076
02:22:15,251 --> 02:22:16,300
What in Tarnation Glee.

5077
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:18,100
But imagine if they did that with vikings.

5078
02:22:19,540 --> 02:22:20,130
Okay.

5079
02:22:20,130 --> 02:22:20,760
You know,

5080
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:21,181
like Yo,

5081
02:22:21,181 --> 02:22:22,070
we pillage or what,

5082
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:23,760
where are we doing dog?

5083
02:22:24,540 --> 02:22:25,540
Fuck yeah.

5084
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:26,040
I want to be

5085
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,910
king of this bitch.

5086
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:31,020
Yo saw let's let loose on this shit.

5087
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:33,030
Let's let loose on these bitches.

5088
02:22:33,950 --> 02:22:34,560
Yeah,

5089
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:36,180
I mean maybe that's,

5090
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:37,440
that's real similar.

5091
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:38,761
Yeah,

5092
02:22:38,761 --> 02:22:39,061
I'd see.

5093
02:22:39,061 --> 02:22:39,690
That's why.

5094
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:39,901
Okay,

5095
02:22:39,901 --> 02:22:40,734
so I'm not wrong.

5096
02:22:41,810 --> 02:22:42,020
No,

5097
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:42,853
they did it on purpose.

5098
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:44,130
I bet they're bringing it back.

5099
02:22:44,131 --> 02:22:47,790
They're making a movie
or something or other.

5100
02:22:47,850 --> 02:22:51,270
I'd bring the series back cause it ended
in the middle of season two when that

5101
02:22:51,271 --> 02:22:52,090
writer's strike happened.

5102
02:22:52,090 --> 02:22:52,920
Right.

5103
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:55,770
I heard there's a dope viking
one that's on Netflix now.

5104
02:22:56,310 --> 02:22:57,390
I think it's a comedy,

5105
02:22:57,510 --> 02:22:57,870
is it?

5106
02:22:57,870 --> 02:22:58,520
Oh yeah.

5107
02:22:58,520 --> 02:23:01,380
Eight Norse Norse gods
or something like that.

5108
02:23:02,130 --> 02:23:02,281
Now.

5109
02:23:02,281 --> 02:23:02,671
That's not the,

5110
02:23:02,671 --> 02:23:05,130
I don't think that's the one
somebody else told me about one.

5111
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:06,210
I think I'll put it on my phone.

5112
02:23:06,990 --> 02:23:08,850
North Smith Norseman does that it,

5113
02:23:08,851 --> 02:23:09,684
that might be it.

5114
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:10,230
Is that,

5115
02:23:10,230 --> 02:23:11,070
is that a comedy?

5116
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:12,690
Yeah,

5117
02:23:12,690 --> 02:23:13,091
it's weird.

5118
02:23:13,091 --> 02:23:17,410
My kids fucking curse and I
never cursed around the house.

5119
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:18,760
My wife crystal little,

5120
02:23:18,910 --> 02:23:21,880
but now suddenly it's okay
and they're 15 and 18,

5121
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:26,080
but it's suddenly okay that were at dinner
and just fuck gets thrown around all

5122
02:23:26,081 --> 02:23:26,870
the time.

5123
02:23:26,870 --> 02:23:27,330
It's like,

5124
02:23:27,330 --> 02:23:27,761
when did they,

5125
02:23:27,761 --> 02:23:28,810
when did I okay that

5126
02:23:30,330 --> 02:23:33,670
this it Norseman just
got a comedic vibe to it.

5127
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:34,770
I don't know if it's like a full on.

5128
02:23:34,830 --> 02:23:35,370
Oh,

5129
02:23:35,370 --> 02:23:36,203
okay.

5130
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:39,810
I'm just going to skip the whole thing

5131
02:23:43,430 --> 02:23:44,000
just based off

5132
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:44,240
for that.

5133
02:23:44,240 --> 02:23:44,571
I saw it.

5134
02:23:44,571 --> 02:23:44,840
I was like,

5135
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:44,931
Hey,

5136
02:23:44,931 --> 02:23:46,400
it looks like some Monte Python.

5137
02:23:48,610 --> 02:23:48,760
Well,

5138
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:49,231
why not?

5139
02:23:49,231 --> 02:23:50,064
I heard it's good though,

5140
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:50,761
but I haven't,

5141
02:23:50,761 --> 02:23:51,070
I haven't,

5142
02:23:51,070 --> 02:23:51,870
this might be it.

5143
02:23:51,870 --> 02:23:52,703
Yeah.

5144
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:54,460
I was just too many new shells.

5145
02:23:54,580 --> 02:23:55,081
I can't keep it.

5146
02:23:55,081 --> 02:23:55,914
Yeah.

5147
02:23:55,930 --> 02:23:56,763
I can't keep up.

5148
02:23:57,220 --> 02:23:58,053
I know.

5149
02:24:00,230 --> 02:24:00,501
It's,

5150
02:24:00,501 --> 02:24:01,310
um,

5151
02:24:01,310 --> 02:24:02,030
it's like,

5152
02:24:02,030 --> 02:24:02,863
it's great.

5153
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:05,720
This such high quality
and things are so good,

5154
02:24:05,750 --> 02:24:08,930
but it's not great in
that you can't keep up.

5155
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:11,590
Have you started watching
the marvelous Mrs Maizel?

5156
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:11,881
Yeah,

5157
02:24:11,881 --> 02:24:15,960
I saw the first season and then maybe
one or two of the second season,

5158
02:24:15,961 --> 02:24:16,794
but it just,

5159
02:24:17,130 --> 02:24:17,941
I really liked it.

5160
02:24:17,941 --> 02:24:19,260
I think she's fucking great.

5161
02:24:19,290 --> 02:24:24,290
Obviously the cast Tony Shalhoub
but it just got so Jewish.

5162
02:24:24,620 --> 02:24:27,140
Don't say anything because
I'm just starting it.

5163
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:27,531
Okay.

5164
02:24:27,531 --> 02:24:28,240
This is what I did.

5165
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:28,911
I lucked up.

5166
02:24:28,911 --> 02:24:30,620
I fucked up and started with season two.

5167
02:24:30,830 --> 02:24:32,810
How you did started with episode one.

5168
02:24:32,811 --> 02:24:33,644
Season two,

5169
02:24:33,690 --> 02:24:34,640
got to episode three.

5170
02:24:34,641 --> 02:24:34,881
I was like,

5171
02:24:34,881 --> 02:24:35,714
what's wrong with those?

5172
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:37,910
That's hilarious.

5173
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:38,091
No,

5174
02:24:38,091 --> 02:24:38,661
I didn't even know.

5175
02:24:38,661 --> 02:24:39,494
Somebody had to tell me.

5176
02:24:39,850 --> 02:24:41,120
Somebody had to tell me at the store,

5177
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:41,901
I forget who told me.

5178
02:24:41,901 --> 02:24:42,734
But um,

5179
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:46,780
I went back and watched the
first episode of season one.

5180
02:24:46,781 --> 02:24:47,031
It was like,

5181
02:24:47,031 --> 02:24:47,451
Holy Shit,

5182
02:24:47,451 --> 02:24:48,284
this is even better.

5183
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:51,650
But I thought it was good watching
the first episode of season two,

5184
02:24:51,651 --> 02:24:54,000
not even knowing how she got there
because I knew it was about standup.

5185
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:54,920
I knew she was a comic,

5186
02:24:55,310 --> 02:24:57,320
but then going back and
watching it from season one,

5187
02:24:57,321 --> 02:24:57,680
I'm like,

5188
02:24:57,680 --> 02:24:58,670
oh,

5189
02:24:58,671 --> 02:24:59,110
okay.

5190
02:24:59,110 --> 02:24:59,321
Yeah.

5191
02:24:59,321 --> 02:25:00,160
I think there's a lot,

5192
02:25:00,190 --> 02:25:04,300
there's a lot of stuff about how they
ha and writing on a show that's similar

5193
02:25:04,301 --> 02:25:07,030
and that it's about a comedian
starting out on crashing.

5194
02:25:07,420 --> 02:25:07,900
It's,

5195
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:10,030
I think they really capture,

5196
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:11,230
um,

5197
02:25:11,230 --> 02:25:12,970
the process of somebody brand new,

5198
02:25:12,971 --> 02:25:14,680
finding their voice on stage.

5199
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:15,250
Yeah.

5200
02:25:15,250 --> 02:25:16,083
Yeah.

5201
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:17,380
And the manager's great.

5202
02:25:17,381 --> 02:25:18,790
The woman that plays her manager,

5203
02:25:18,970 --> 02:25:21,940
there's always somebody like that
that's in your corner that's helping you

5204
02:25:21,941 --> 02:25:23,020
develop yourself.

5205
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:24,633
Um,

5206
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:25,331
and she's,

5207
02:25:25,331 --> 02:25:26,770
she's natural on stage.

5208
02:25:26,771 --> 02:25:27,311
I buy it.

5209
02:25:27,311 --> 02:25:30,610
I buy her as a standup on stage
buyers being actually funny.

5210
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:31,470
Yeah.

5211
02:25:31,470 --> 02:25:33,370
And it's interesting seeing Lenny Bruce,

5212
02:25:33,430 --> 02:25:34,263
the guy who plays [inaudible].

5213
02:25:34,270 --> 02:25:35,080
Bruce is very good.

5214
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:35,610
Yeah.

5215
02:25:35,610 --> 02:25:36,443
Who is that guy?

5216
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:38,080
Who's the,

5217
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:38,913
who's her too?

5218
02:25:40,150 --> 02:25:45,150
Her name and spoil or you get to
see her breasts call's fantastic,

5219
02:25:45,881 --> 02:25:46,540
by the way,

5220
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:47,170
Lord.

5221
02:25:47,170 --> 02:25:47,830
Good Lord.

5222
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:48,670
Thank you Jesus.

5223
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:50,373
Okay.

5224
02:25:50,550 --> 02:25:51,810
I had to do a search.

5225
02:25:52,130 --> 02:25:53,040
Not that I want to sound like,

5226
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:53,911
but no,

5227
02:25:53,911 --> 02:25:55,200
I did a search on her news.

5228
02:25:55,230 --> 02:25:56,063
Just let it go.

5229
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:57,640
I did a thing on her nude and

5230
02:25:59,360 --> 02:25:59,760
proud,

5231
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:00,211
put it up.

5232
02:26:00,211 --> 02:26:02,010
So she won the gold one.

5233
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:02,993
Gold go for that.

5234
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:03,480
Yeah.

5235
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:04,313
Wow.

5236
02:26:04,590 --> 02:26:04,831
Yeah.

5237
02:26:04,831 --> 02:26:09,831
Rachel Brosnahan and I'm
Michael's Egan and agile nasal.

5238
02:26:10,261 --> 02:26:11,040
Great.

5239
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:11,670
And uh,

5240
02:26:11,670 --> 02:26:12,391
who is,

5241
02:26:12,391 --> 02:26:13,224
um,

5242
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:15,300
who's playing Lenny Bruce?

5243
02:26:16,940 --> 02:26:17,421
Is that the guy?

5244
02:26:17,421 --> 02:26:18,230
Luke Kirby.

5245
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:18,771
Luke Kirby.

5246
02:26:18,771 --> 02:26:19,604
Luke Kirby.

5247
02:26:20,210 --> 02:26:21,043
Outstanding.

5248
02:26:21,170 --> 02:26:21,951
He did a great job.

5249
02:26:21,951 --> 02:26:22,061
He,

5250
02:26:22,061 --> 02:26:23,480
he sounded like him.

5251
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:23,810
You know,

5252
02:26:23,810 --> 02:26:24,440
he sounds,

5253
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:26,870
without doing an obvious impression,

5254
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:29,870
it sounds like it's got the tone right.

5255
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,160
He's got the inflection,

5256
02:26:31,161 --> 02:26:31,850
right.

5257
02:26:31,850 --> 02:26:33,530
It's not overly stylized.

5258
02:26:33,590 --> 02:26:33,921
No,

5259
02:26:33,921 --> 02:26:34,191
no,

5260
02:26:34,191 --> 02:26:34,401
no.

5261
02:26:34,401 --> 02:26:35,750
It's saying that you believe it.

5262
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:36,830
He's,

5263
02:26:36,830 --> 02:26:37,190
he's,

5264
02:26:37,190 --> 02:26:41,120
he did a great job of like seeming like
a guy doing standup in front of a room.

5265
02:26:41,121 --> 02:26:43,790
People not like an actor
playing a stand up.

5266
02:26:44,150 --> 02:26:44,331
Well,

5267
02:26:44,331 --> 02:26:46,070
the woman that created the show,

5268
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:49,490
apparently her dad was a
standup and he knew Lenny Bruce,

5269
02:26:49,491 --> 02:26:53,480
which is why she put them in the series
because he's the only historical figure

5270
02:26:53,481 --> 02:26:54,150
and the shell.

5271
02:26:54,150 --> 02:26:54,740
Right,

5272
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:55,460
right.

5273
02:26:55,460 --> 02:26:55,581
Yeah.

5274
02:26:55,581 --> 02:26:56,630
Well it's also the show.

5275
02:26:57,050 --> 02:26:58,580
They take some liberties with a history.

5276
02:26:58,760 --> 02:26:59,511
Like there was,

5277
02:26:59,511 --> 02:27:01,730
I don't think there was
a comedy club back then.

5278
02:27:02,210 --> 02:27:03,440
You know this gas light,

5279
02:27:03,441 --> 02:27:04,020
they called it.

5280
02:27:04,020 --> 02:27:04,620
That's one.

5281
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:05,690
I don't think that was real.

5282
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:07,970
I don't think there really
was a comedy club back then.

5283
02:27:07,971 --> 02:27:12,800
I think back then people were just doing
poetry nights and there were doing,

5284
02:27:12,830 --> 02:27:13,100
you know,

5285
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:15,470
they'd be like a musician than a comedian.

5286
02:27:15,471 --> 02:27:16,670
Comedians would host things.

5287
02:27:16,671 --> 02:27:17,300
Right.

5288
02:27:17,300 --> 02:27:20,660
I don't think there was
necessarily a comedy club.

5289
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:20,940
Yeah,

5290
02:27:20,940 --> 02:27:22,040
I think that came later.

5291
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:22,611
Yeah.

5292
02:27:22,611 --> 02:27:26,090
It's like catch a rising star came
out of being a cabaret and you know,

5293
02:27:26,091 --> 02:27:29,690
people would sing there and then suddenly
people started doing stand up there

5294
02:27:29,691 --> 02:27:33,530
and the two existed together for
years before it became a comedy.

5295
02:27:33,531 --> 02:27:33,861
Can we,

5296
02:27:33,861 --> 02:27:36,200
should we should actually know this?

5297
02:27:36,201 --> 02:27:37,040
Why do we not know?

5298
02:27:37,041 --> 02:27:38,750
What was the very first comedy club?

5299
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:40,071
Well,

5300
02:27:40,071 --> 02:27:40,904
it was a catch.

5301
02:27:41,060 --> 02:27:43,520
There was the hungry eye in San Francisco.

5302
02:27:43,550 --> 02:27:44,840
Was that the first might,

5303
02:27:44,841 --> 02:27:46,100
and this is the 60s though.

5304
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:46,770
Is that when it's done?

5305
02:27:46,770 --> 02:27:47,480
Yeah,

5306
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:49,580
that was the 60s because the ice house,

5307
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:50,660
um,

5308
02:27:50,660 --> 02:27:54,560
is the oldest running
comedy club in the world.

5309
02:27:54,740 --> 02:27:55,760
The Ice House was the oldest.

5310
02:27:55,761 --> 02:27:58,160
All the other old ones are
gone except the ice house.

5311
02:27:59,150 --> 02:28:01,490
And the comedy and Magic
Club was right on its heels.

5312
02:28:01,730 --> 02:28:02,160
Right.

5313
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:02,480
That's,

5314
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:03,440
that's probably second.

5315
02:28:04,190 --> 02:28:05,630
But what was the,

5316
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:10,150
well that place is called The gas light
and I think there was a gas light back

5317
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:10,341
then.

5318
02:28:10,341 --> 02:28:11,660
It was a comedy club though.

5319
02:28:12,170 --> 02:28:12,830
I don't think they,

5320
02:28:12,830 --> 02:28:13,760
the way they did it,

5321
02:28:13,761 --> 02:28:14,780
which was great,

5322
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:15,441
and again,

5323
02:28:15,441 --> 02:28:16,274
I don't want to give,

5324
02:28:16,370 --> 02:28:17,260
give too much of it away,

5325
02:28:17,270 --> 02:28:19,640
but the way they did it where
like people were getting bumped,

5326
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:21,020
like she got bumped.

5327
02:28:21,410 --> 02:28:21,621
It's like,

5328
02:28:21,621 --> 02:28:26,600
I don't think that that was what guys did
where they ran around doing 15 minutes

5329
02:28:26,601 --> 02:28:29,150
and go from one club to another the
way in New York comics do it now.

5330
02:28:29,210 --> 02:28:29,511
Right.

5331
02:28:29,511 --> 02:28:30,560
I don't think that's real.

5332
02:28:30,580 --> 02:28:31,413
Yeah,

5333
02:28:31,580 --> 02:28:33,320
but that's a nit picky thing.

5334
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:34,450
That's,

5335
02:28:34,450 --> 02:28:35,283
it's more,

5336
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:36,463
you know,

5337
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:39,530
it's more indicative I think
of how people do it today.

5338
02:28:40,710 --> 02:28:41,210
You'd like,

5339
02:28:41,210 --> 02:28:41,960
do you think they were,

5340
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:42,231
I mean,

5341
02:28:42,231 --> 02:28:43,064
who the fuck knows?

5342
02:28:43,090 --> 02:28:46,280
Maybe they had a drop in back then
and maybe they did have nights,

5343
02:28:46,310 --> 02:28:48,410
like several nights where
they had just comedy.

5344
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:49,220
Yeah.

5345
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:52,910
This is booked by a cliff or
off about the history of comedy.

5346
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:53,570
You ever read that?

5347
02:28:53,570 --> 02:28:54,150
No,

5348
02:28:54,150 --> 02:28:55,080
he just called me,

5349
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:57,031
I don't know,

5350
02:28:57,031 --> 02:28:58,500
but it's cliff a.

5351
02:28:58,501 --> 02:29:00,450
N.

5352
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:00,450
E.

5353
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:00,450
S.

5354
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:00,450
T.

5355
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:00,450
E.

5356
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:00,450
R.

5357
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:00,450
O.

5358
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:00,900
V.

5359
02:29:00,900 --> 02:29:01,321
And A.

5360
02:29:01,321 --> 02:29:02,940
I had him on my podcast a couple of times.

5361
02:29:02,941 --> 02:29:03,451
He's great.

5362
02:29:03,451 --> 02:29:07,350
But the real first comedy
shows in New York were um,

5363
02:29:07,730 --> 02:29:08,563
uh,

5364
02:29:08,710 --> 02:29:09,610
the Comedians,

5365
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:10,451
drunks,

5366
02:29:10,451 --> 02:29:10,781
thieves,

5367
02:29:10,781 --> 02:29:12,850
scoundrels in the history
of American comedy.

5368
02:29:13,210 --> 02:29:13,840
Um,

5369
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:16,900
did you find anything about the oldest
or the first standup comedy club?

5370
02:29:18,750 --> 02:29:19,511
Arguably,

5371
02:29:19,511 --> 02:29:22,320
it was in the United Kingdom in
1979 it was the comedy store.

5372
02:29:22,321 --> 02:29:26,250
And before that they were just performing
English motherfucker got ahold of

5373
02:29:26,251 --> 02:29:27,084
Wikipedia.

5374
02:29:28,170 --> 02:29:30,570
That's just started in United Kingdom
and the United States history,

5375
02:29:30,571 --> 02:29:32,970
it goes back into the 19th
century and Vaudeville places.

5376
02:29:32,971 --> 02:29:36,300
And so it just depends on when
somebody first turned their venue.

5377
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:38,770
What I'm saying is who called,

5378
02:29:38,771 --> 02:29:39,760
who was,

5379
02:29:39,790 --> 02:29:41,950
who had the very serious comedy club.

5380
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:42,251
Yeah,

5381
02:29:42,251 --> 02:29:42,550
the,

5382
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:44,500
the hungry I San Francisco.

5383
02:29:44,710 --> 02:29:45,070
Yeah.

5384
02:29:45,070 --> 02:29:45,671
So the hungry,

5385
02:29:45,671 --> 02:29:47,650
I was a 100% comedy club.

5386
02:29:47,830 --> 02:29:48,250
Yeah.

5387
02:29:48,250 --> 02:29:49,240
And then the bitter end,

5388
02:29:49,241 --> 02:29:50,950
which was music and comedy.

5389
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:51,790
Hmm.

5390
02:29:51,790 --> 02:29:52,390
Interesting.

5391
02:29:52,390 --> 02:29:53,260
In New York.

5392
02:29:53,830 --> 02:29:55,430
So those are the ones and what years that,

5393
02:29:56,120 --> 02:29:58,450
let's just says in the 50s into the 60s.

5394
02:29:58,451 --> 02:29:59,740
It doesn't have this particular year.

5395
02:29:59,741 --> 02:30:00,574
Wow.

5396
02:30:00,970 --> 02:30:02,110
Mort Saul,

5397
02:30:03,340 --> 02:30:07,420
I think Mort Saul still around
Google that I think he is.

5398
02:30:07,510 --> 02:30:08,890
I think he's still doing stand up.

5399
02:30:08,980 --> 02:30:09,730
I think Dick Dick,

5400
02:30:09,730 --> 02:30:10,710
Dick Gregory's around.

5401
02:30:10,970 --> 02:30:12,190
I think Dick Gregory died.

5402
02:30:12,400 --> 02:30:12,851
Oh he did?

5403
02:30:12,851 --> 02:30:13,684
Is that true?

5404
02:30:13,990 --> 02:30:17,180
Find out that first cause I'm a dick.

5405
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:17,870
I say died.

5406
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:18,280
He didn't.

5407
02:30:18,280 --> 02:30:19,113
Yeah.

5408
02:30:19,570 --> 02:30:20,403
Um,

5409
02:30:20,650 --> 02:30:20,861
yeah.

5410
02:30:20,861 --> 02:30:21,610
Dick Gregory.

5411
02:30:21,610 --> 02:30:22,280
Yeah,

5412
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:23,113
yeah,

5413
02:30:24,010 --> 02:30:24,843
yeah.

5414
02:30:25,150 --> 02:30:25,690
He died.

5415
02:30:25,690 --> 02:30:28,270
But I think Lenny Bruce might've
started at the hungry eye as well.

5416
02:30:28,271 --> 02:30:29,800
I think he started in San Francisco.

5417
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:30,753
I think you're right.

5418
02:30:30,970 --> 02:30:31,803
Yeah.

5419
02:30:32,620 --> 02:30:32,861
Yeah.

5420
02:30:32,861 --> 02:30:33,641
That was a,

5421
02:30:33,641 --> 02:30:34,750
the beatniks right?

5422
02:30:35,310 --> 02:30:35,650
Yeah.

5423
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:36,880
Led into the,

5424
02:30:36,910 --> 02:30:37,780
is he still around?

5425
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:42,820
Goddamn you Mort Saul Still Rockin
1991 years old motherfucker.

5426
02:30:42,850 --> 02:30:43,750
Wow.

5427
02:30:44,140 --> 02:30:44,980
Outlived them all.

5428
02:30:45,010 --> 02:30:45,843
Good for him.

5429
02:30:46,110 --> 02:30:46,750
Um,

5430
02:30:46,750 --> 02:30:46,991
yeah,

5431
02:30:46,991 --> 02:30:48,700
all these guys were the originators.

5432
02:30:48,790 --> 02:30:49,240
I mean,

5433
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:50,350
without them.

5434
02:30:50,740 --> 02:30:51,041
These are,

5435
02:30:51,041 --> 02:30:54,190
this is the original roots of
the tree of standup comedy.

5436
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:55,870
100% right?

5437
02:30:55,960 --> 02:30:56,793
Yeah.

5438
02:30:59,170 --> 02:31:00,380
We do know James,

5439
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:01,213
Google and shit.

5440
02:31:03,230 --> 02:31:04,130
I just go back and look,

5441
02:31:05,050 --> 02:31:07,240
it's a crazy history.

5442
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:08,171
You really stop.

5443
02:31:08,171 --> 02:31:09,380
And think about the,

5444
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:14,500
the year it starts in the 60s and that
before that it didn't exist like that.

5445
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:17,110
Like it was kind of a
thing that people did.

5446
02:31:17,111 --> 02:31:18,100
There was court jesters,

5447
02:31:18,101 --> 02:31:19,120
there was funny people,

5448
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:20,310
there was comedy

5449
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:22,650
in various plays and musicals.

5450
02:31:22,651 --> 02:31:24,090
There was comp comedic elements.

5451
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:25,320
But this cabaret.

5452
02:31:25,410 --> 02:31:26,243
Yeah.

5453
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:28,680
And there was MCS people would mc things.

5454
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:33,860
But in terms of like someone
going specifically to see
someone say things in a

5455
02:31:34,261 --> 02:31:34,891
funny way,

5456
02:31:34,891 --> 02:31:36,360
just talking in front of a microphone.

5457
02:31:36,690 --> 02:31:38,640
That is really recent.

5458
02:31:38,820 --> 02:31:39,520
Yeah.

5459
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,353
That's,

5460
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:43,080
imagine if we were born
a hundred years ago,

5461
02:31:43,081 --> 02:31:44,400
what the fuck would we do?

5462
02:31:46,410 --> 02:31:46,651
Well,

5463
02:31:46,651 --> 02:31:47,280
we might,

5464
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,450
we might have done,

5465
02:31:48,451 --> 02:31:49,080
um,

5466
02:31:49,080 --> 02:31:49,913
Vaudeville

5467
02:31:51,330 --> 02:31:52,900
hang out with all those Vaudeville people.

5468
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:52,971
Oh,

5469
02:31:52,971 --> 02:31:55,590
I'd feel people where
you go from town to town,

5470
02:31:55,670 --> 02:31:56,240
your beer,

5471
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:58,020
your suitcase has no wheels on it.

5472
02:31:58,300 --> 02:31:58,801
The login,

5473
02:31:58,801 --> 02:31:59,970
that shit on a train.

5474
02:32:00,060 --> 02:32:00,893
Oh,

5475
02:32:01,290 --> 02:32:01,800
fun though.

5476
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:02,520
Few Young.

5477
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:03,353
Yeah.

5478
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:03,951
If you're young,

5479
02:32:03,951 --> 02:32:07,080
it's probably fun because if you think
you're a big deal when you go to a town

5480
02:32:07,081 --> 02:32:07,860
now,

5481
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:09,450
go to fucking Columbus,

5482
02:32:09,451 --> 02:32:12,330
Ohio in 1919 and,

5483
02:32:12,331 --> 02:32:13,320
and perform,

5484
02:32:13,350 --> 02:32:15,030
you would be like a god to them.

5485
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:16,290
Yeah.

5486
02:32:16,290 --> 02:32:19,020
But you'd also be like a Carnie yeah.

5487
02:32:19,050 --> 02:32:20,670
Traveling from town to town,

5488
02:32:20,730 --> 02:32:23,220
probably fucking real
loose with your morals.

5489
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:23,641
Yeah.

5490
02:32:23,641 --> 02:32:24,474
Right.

5491
02:32:25,770 --> 02:32:28,290
Spreading God knows
what around the Midwest,

5492
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:31,710
all kinds of STDs and yeah,

5493
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:34,770
I owe use and babies constantly.

5494
02:32:34,771 --> 02:32:38,130
Nobody pulled out to use
the wrapper and that 1910s.

5495
02:32:38,370 --> 02:32:38,671
Right.

5496
02:32:38,671 --> 02:32:39,930
And they're also like,

5497
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:41,670
they're living a savage life.

5498
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:43,710
Like to expect them to find a nice gown,

5499
02:32:43,711 --> 02:32:44,940
Kansas and settle down.

5500
02:32:44,970 --> 02:32:45,720
That's right.

5501
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:48,990
They're just their work in the tilt the
world and they've got to prop it up with

5502
02:32:48,991 --> 02:32:53,020
logs cause the left side doesn't
have a leg and that thing spins.

5503
02:32:53,030 --> 02:32:54,240
So you got to keep an eye on it.

5504
02:32:54,241 --> 02:32:57,540
You don't want to launch anybody
to the parking lot and if you do,

5505
02:32:57,541 --> 02:32:59,380
you just pack up and
move to the next town.

5506
02:32:59,410 --> 02:33:02,430
They just get the fuck out of here is
just no way to track on the Internet.

5507
02:33:03,750 --> 02:33:03,991
Yeah.

5508
02:33:03,991 --> 02:33:04,411
They say,

5509
02:33:04,411 --> 02:33:04,651
you know,

5510
02:33:04,651 --> 02:33:05,760
a lot of those early,

5511
02:33:05,761 --> 02:33:06,330
um,

5512
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:10,950
it was very Jewish because Jews were
having a hard time getting hired.

5513
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:13,080
And so that was one of the
few places they could work.

5514
02:33:13,081 --> 02:33:16,620
And that's why they say comedy
was a very Jewish thing.

5515
02:33:16,860 --> 02:33:17,551
Oh,

5516
02:33:17,551 --> 02:33:20,730
interest leading into the
Borscht belt and all that.

5517
02:33:20,910 --> 02:33:21,910
Stan and Ollie,

5518
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:22,920
this movie just came out.

5519
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:27,980
It's basically about this Lauren Harlot
hardy were Vaudeville tour in Comedians

5520
02:33:28,831 --> 02:33:29,700
in 1920s.

5521
02:33:29,790 --> 02:33:30,870
When did this come out?

5522
02:33:30,900 --> 02:33:31,681
Just came out.

5523
02:33:31,681 --> 02:33:32,730
It's in the theaters right now.

5524
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:33,031
No,

5525
02:33:33,031 --> 02:33:33,570
Shit.

5526
02:33:33,570 --> 02:33:34,470
I'm supposed to be good.

5527
02:33:34,471 --> 02:33:35,220
But yeah,

5528
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:36,053
about two weeks ago.

5529
02:33:36,090 --> 02:33:38,010
And Stan and all these stand for,

5530
02:33:38,011 --> 02:33:39,330
forget the Laurel and hardy,

5531
02:33:39,390 --> 02:33:39,750
right?

5532
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:40,250
Yep,

5533
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:40,371
Yep.

5534
02:33:40,371 --> 02:33:40,561
Yep.

5535
02:33:40,561 --> 02:33:42,060
It's a John C.

5536
02:33:42,060 --> 02:33:44,080
Reilly and Steve Coogan.

5537
02:33:44,110 --> 02:33:45,450
Wow.

5538
02:33:45,470 --> 02:33:46,710
You guys are both amazing.

5539
02:33:47,660 --> 02:33:48,930
Jonsi Raleigh's excellent.

5540
02:33:50,940 --> 02:33:52,080
I don't know who Steve Coogan is.

5541
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:52,811
Who?

5542
02:33:52,811 --> 02:33:53,644
Steve Coogan.

5543
02:33:53,770 --> 02:33:55,530
I said British standup I think,

5544
02:33:56,790 --> 02:33:57,121
but uh,

5545
02:33:57,121 --> 02:33:57,811
that's cool.

5546
02:33:57,811 --> 02:33:59,250
I'm glad someone okay.

5547
02:33:59,430 --> 02:33:59,551
Oh,

5548
02:33:59,551 --> 02:34:00,780
I've seen that guy and stuff before.

5549
02:34:02,010 --> 02:34:03,060
I'm glad someone's doing that.

5550
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:06,420
Charlie Chapman was
supposedly a bad motherfucker.

5551
02:34:06,450 --> 02:34:07,283
Yeah.

5552
02:34:07,410 --> 02:34:10,170
He would go up to the
Hearst castle and fuck,

5553
02:34:10,171 --> 02:34:11,004
uh,

5554
02:34:11,140 --> 02:34:11,760
Eh,

5555
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:14,340
hearse wife in the castle.

5556
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:15,870
You ever go up to that castle?

5557
02:34:15,890 --> 02:34:16,141
Yeah,

5558
02:34:16,141 --> 02:34:16,861
when I was a little kid.

5559
02:34:16,861 --> 02:34:18,010
It's amazing.

5560
02:34:18,490 --> 02:34:18,911
And a,

5561
02:34:18,911 --> 02:34:19,131
yeah,

5562
02:34:19,131 --> 02:34:20,110
a chaplain would go up.

5563
02:34:20,111 --> 02:34:21,250
He was fucking everybody.

5564
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:22,180
Everybody's wife.

5565
02:34:22,210 --> 02:34:22,900
Yeah,

5566
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:24,160
he got off on wives.

5567
02:34:24,400 --> 02:34:24,821
Really?

5568
02:34:24,821 --> 02:34:25,121
Yeah.

5569
02:34:25,121 --> 02:34:26,020
That was the thing.

5570
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:26,560
Yeah.

5571
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:27,393
So dangerous.

5572
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:32,280
Imagine the only happy if you're
banging someone else's woman.

5573
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:33,690
Wow,

5574
02:34:33,690 --> 02:34:34,500
that's crazy.

5575
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:35,333
I guess there's no,

5576
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:36,300
there's no commitment.

5577
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:37,953
Maybe that,

5578
02:34:38,170 --> 02:34:39,340
and if she gets pregnant it's,

5579
02:34:39,341 --> 02:34:39,850
you know,

5580
02:34:39,850 --> 02:34:43,090
he'll claim it and he'll claim the baby
that's them there at the Hearst castle.

5581
02:34:43,350 --> 02:34:44,520
Wow.

5582
02:34:45,180 --> 02:34:46,290
Whoa.

5583
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:48,210
That's him with a cigarette.

5584
02:34:48,810 --> 02:34:49,980
That's so weird.

5585
02:34:50,450 --> 02:34:55,450
Thirties the in the 60s hurst would
have hundreds of guests every weekend.

5586
02:34:55,651 --> 02:35:00,000
They had rooms for hundreds of
people and they would have hunts.

5587
02:35:00,030 --> 02:35:02,890
They would fucking hunt
during the day who are,

5588
02:35:02,910 --> 02:35:03,120
you know,

5589
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:06,210
they play tennis and then everybody
would meet for high balls at like five

5590
02:35:06,211 --> 02:35:09,180
o'clock in one room and giant fireplaces.

5591
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:12,270
And they've set dinners
with fucking servants.

5592
02:35:12,271 --> 02:35:14,400
And if you've got an invite to that,

5593
02:35:14,430 --> 02:35:17,070
he went for you go for like three weeks.

5594
02:35:17,150 --> 02:35:17,660
What?

5595
02:35:17,660 --> 02:35:18,291
Yeah.

5596
02:35:18,291 --> 02:35:20,210
You can look at that dining hall.

5597
02:35:20,240 --> 02:35:21,260
You know what that looks like?

5598
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:24,740
It looks like the haunted
dining hall in the Disney Rod.

5599
02:35:24,860 --> 02:35:25,790
The haunted mansion.

5600
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:26,711
I don't know.

5601
02:35:26,711 --> 02:35:27,200
Pass the,

5602
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:28,033
you ever seen that?

5603
02:35:28,810 --> 02:35:29,690
Do you know what I'm talking about?

5604
02:35:29,691 --> 02:35:30,800
Got Inspired from something,

5605
02:35:30,950 --> 02:35:32,870
I guarantee that's what
they got inspired by.

5606
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:34,400
It looks so much like that.

5607
02:35:34,520 --> 02:35:38,330
So look at that image right
now and now Google the,

5608
02:35:38,331 --> 02:35:38,600
uh,

5609
02:35:38,600 --> 02:35:40,980
dining room at the haunted mansion,

5610
02:35:41,010 --> 02:35:44,120
Disneyland and all seen
when you fly by and you're,

5611
02:35:44,121 --> 02:35:46,910
you're on the little train and you
pass by and all the ghosts are dancing

5612
02:35:46,911 --> 02:35:47,150
around.

5613
02:35:47,150 --> 02:35:47,401
Shit.

5614
02:35:47,401 --> 02:35:48,020
It's cool.

5615
02:35:48,020 --> 02:35:48,853
It looks just like that.

5616
02:35:49,330 --> 02:35:49,870
Um,

5617
02:35:49,870 --> 02:35:50,770
and then it was a zoo.

5618
02:35:50,771 --> 02:35:52,750
All the grounds were a
zoo at Hearst castle.

5619
02:35:52,751 --> 02:35:55,420
There was fucking giraffes
running around zebras.

5620
02:35:55,810 --> 02:35:57,010
He's like El Chapo.

5621
02:35:57,370 --> 02:35:59,290
He couldn't get rid of his money.

5622
02:35:59,440 --> 02:36:01,000
He had so much fucking money.

5623
02:36:01,160 --> 02:36:02,880
That's a shit image of it.

5624
02:36:02,930 --> 02:36:03,890
They don't have a good image of it.

5625
02:36:04,580 --> 02:36:05,413
Oh,

5626
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:06,273
all right.

5627
02:36:07,510 --> 02:36:08,343
Um,

5628
02:36:09,990 --> 02:36:10,940
how is that possible?

5629
02:36:11,550 --> 02:36:12,830
Not really supposed to
take pictures in there.

5630
02:36:12,860 --> 02:36:13,490
Yeah,

5631
02:36:13,490 --> 02:36:14,430
that's a good point.

5632
02:36:15,690 --> 02:36:16,051
Wow.

5633
02:36:16,051 --> 02:36:16,471
So everybody,

5634
02:36:16,471 --> 02:36:17,610
but everybody does.

5635
02:36:18,330 --> 02:36:19,890
People are always taking pictures of shit.

5636
02:36:20,490 --> 02:36:22,030
You take pictures of your kids in there.

5637
02:36:23,490 --> 02:36:24,030
Anyway,

5638
02:36:24,030 --> 02:36:25,080
it looks real similar to that.

5639
02:36:25,290 --> 02:36:25,891
But yeah,

5640
02:36:25,891 --> 02:36:28,020
that guy had way too much money.

5641
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:29,700
He brought over wild boars.

5642
02:36:29,701 --> 02:36:32,310
He's the reason why California
has a wild pig problem.

5643
02:36:32,360 --> 02:36:33,060
Oh Shit.

5644
02:36:33,060 --> 02:36:33,720
Yes.

5645
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:34,620
Wow.

5646
02:36:34,650 --> 02:36:36,870
Him that Fuck God damn.

5647
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:37,733
Yeah.

5648
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:38,760
Wild Boars.

5649
02:36:38,761 --> 02:36:39,170
And they didn't,

5650
02:36:39,170 --> 02:36:39,900
they'd go hunt them.

5651
02:36:39,900 --> 02:36:40,733
Yeah,

5652
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:41,933
he brought them here.

5653
02:36:42,090 --> 02:36:42,630
Wow.

5654
02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:43,500
That's why there's a whole,

5655
02:36:43,501 --> 02:36:43,830
like,

5656
02:36:43,830 --> 02:36:45,060
it's not down here.

5657
02:36:45,390 --> 02:36:46,890
So he's not in southern California.

5658
02:36:47,100 --> 02:36:47,933
They're all up there.

5659
02:36:48,010 --> 02:36:48,510
Yeah.

5660
02:36:48,510 --> 02:36:48,661
They're,

5661
02:36:48,661 --> 02:36:50,310
they're slowly making their way down here.

5662
02:36:50,880 --> 02:36:52,350
But the ones that are down here,

5663
02:36:52,351 --> 02:36:56,070
the closest they are is to
hone ranch to hone ranches,

5664
02:36:56,071 --> 02:36:56,251
uh,

5665
02:36:56,251 --> 02:36:57,600
about an hour and a half from here.

5666
02:36:57,930 --> 02:36:59,190
And they have wild pig.

5667
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:02,930
Is it that hard to just get a bunch of
guys with AK 47 [inaudible] and hunt him

5668
02:37:02,931 --> 02:37:03,764
down?

5669
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:04,780
Stop that hard.

5670
02:37:04,781 --> 02:37:06,220
But you can't do that in California,

5671
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:07,241
California.

5672
02:37:07,241 --> 02:37:11,080
You can get depredation permits and
they have gotten depredation permits and

5673
02:37:11,081 --> 02:37:14,530
they hunt them at night with night vision
because sometimes the pigs will start

5674
02:37:14,531 --> 02:37:15,950
making their way into agriculture

5675
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:18,170
or they start making their way into the,

5676
02:37:18,171 --> 02:37:22,190
like they'll lay down some fresh sod and
put some grass down and these pigs will

5677
02:37:22,191 --> 02:37:25,580
destroy thousands of dollars
in landscaping damage.

5678
02:37:25,581 --> 02:37:26,240
So yeah,

5679
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:28,040
when they prove that that's happening,

5680
02:37:28,041 --> 02:37:31,730
then they get a special permit and
then they could just start whacking.

5681
02:37:31,910 --> 02:37:32,330
Yeah.

5682
02:37:32,330 --> 02:37:35,600
And then they just take out like
everything at night and they do it with,

5683
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:36,530
you know,

5684
02:37:36,530 --> 02:37:37,760
sniper rifles and shit.

5685
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:43,060
But then when I'm a normal person wants
to like say if you wanted to kill a wild

5686
02:37:43,461 --> 02:37:44,294
pig,

5687
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:46,730
you can get as many licenses as you like.

5688
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:48,410
You can get five licenses,

5689
02:37:48,411 --> 02:37:51,410
you can get six so you can go
out and shoot six pigs in a day.

5690
02:37:51,411 --> 02:37:52,640
It's totally legal,

5691
02:37:52,700 --> 02:37:55,850
so long as you pay for each
individual tag because the,

5692
02:37:56,130 --> 02:37:57,530
the understanding is that it,

5693
02:37:57,531 --> 02:37:58,910
at least in most places,

5694
02:37:58,911 --> 02:38:00,650
California is the only place
that treats it like game.

5695
02:38:00,890 --> 02:38:04,020
And most places you don't even have
to have tags for them most place.

5696
02:38:04,021 --> 02:38:05,570
They're encouraging you to shoot him.

5697
02:38:05,690 --> 02:38:08,360
And that'll probably be the
case in California eventually.

5698
02:38:08,510 --> 02:38:09,980
Like it isn't like Texas,

5699
02:38:09,981 --> 02:38:10,940
France for instance.

5700
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:11,300
Right.

5701
02:38:11,300 --> 02:38:13,250
Texas has a real pig problem.

5702
02:38:13,350 --> 02:38:14,520
They have a giant problem.

5703
02:38:14,530 --> 02:38:15,380
Oh Shit,

5704
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:17,430
there's millions and millions
and millions of pigs.

5705
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:17,841
Oh,

5706
02:38:17,841 --> 02:38:20,670
I remember that from the Friday night
late show at the Improv and Houston

5707
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:23,130
that while I'm asking about,

5708
02:38:24,550 --> 02:38:26,070
you said that with,

5709
02:38:26,130 --> 02:38:28,560
you really had me believing
that you didn't believe it.

5710
02:38:29,220 --> 02:38:30,810
And you're setting up
the joke the whole time.

5711
02:38:31,050 --> 02:38:31,510
Nice.

5712
02:38:31,510 --> 02:38:33,340
I think it's like that
with alligators in Florida.

5713
02:38:33,710 --> 02:38:34,310
Yeah.

5714
02:38:34,310 --> 02:38:34,941
When I was a kid,

5715
02:38:34,941 --> 02:38:35,400
they were,

5716
02:38:35,400 --> 02:38:35,750
uh,

5717
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:36,860
an endangered species.

5718
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:40,160
They would ask us to please not feed
them marshmallows cause I lived in

5719
02:38:40,161 --> 02:38:41,390
Gainesville all right.

5720
02:38:41,391 --> 02:38:42,710
By this place called Lake Alice.

5721
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:43,100
Yeah.

5722
02:38:43,100 --> 02:38:46,520
Lake at alligators fucking 11 years old.

5723
02:38:46,521 --> 02:38:46,631
I was,

5724
02:38:46,631 --> 02:38:48,290
I was in an alligator's was crazy.

5725
02:38:48,291 --> 02:38:48,730
Yeah,

5726
02:38:48,730 --> 02:38:49,970
it was a goddamn dinosaur.

5727
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:53,720
But there was a small population of
them cause they had been whacked into

5728
02:38:53,721 --> 02:38:56,030
oblivion before and people are
making suitcases out of them.

5729
02:38:56,330 --> 02:38:59,810
And then they made it illegal to hunt
them and they made him a protected

5730
02:38:59,811 --> 02:39:00,231
species,

5731
02:39:00,231 --> 02:39:01,610
but then they fucked up.

5732
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:05,240
They overprotected and those God
damn super lizards are everywhere.

5733
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:06,990
Fucking everywhere.

5734
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:12,300
My mom belongs to a golf course down in
Florida where she lives and there's this

5735
02:39:12,301 --> 02:39:15,840
alligator's apparently like
this fucking 14 foot alligator.

5736
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:16,763
And uh,

5737
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:19,920
the people were playing golf and there
was a deer and everybody's on the,

5738
02:39:19,930 --> 02:39:21,180
everybody's standing there going like,

5739
02:39:21,330 --> 02:39:22,060
it's a deer.

5740
02:39:22,060 --> 02:39:22,893
It's a deer.

5741
02:39:23,010 --> 02:39:23,401
Look at that.

5742
02:39:23,401 --> 02:39:23,761
Beautiful.

5743
02:39:23,761 --> 02:39:25,290
They're fucking alligator,

5744
02:39:25,291 --> 02:39:25,801
comes out,

5745
02:39:25,801 --> 02:39:26,640
grabs it,

5746
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:28,230
pulls it into the water,

5747
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:29,760
does that spin move,

5748
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:31,590
takes it to the bottom.

5749
02:39:31,591 --> 02:39:32,670
Fucking done.

5750
02:39:33,180 --> 02:39:35,220
So everyone's talking about it.

5751
02:39:35,221 --> 02:39:36,180
What do we do about it?

5752
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:39,120
So about three weeks later,

5753
02:39:39,150 --> 02:39:43,530
my mom is out on the course and her
ball is right next to the lake where the

5754
02:39:43,531 --> 02:39:48,531
alligator is and she forgets and she goes
over and her ball is right on the edge

5755
02:39:49,081 --> 02:39:53,250
and she's standing there and she was
standing on some fucking like dead,

5756
02:39:53,550 --> 02:39:58,550
some dead grass and it gave out and she
fell in the fucking lake up to her neck.

5757
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:06,080
And then she remembered and she fucking
started scrambling up the mud and

5758
02:40:07,020 --> 02:40:09,090
grabbing if the reeds to get out of there.

5759
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:11,850
And her and the people that
who she was with had left,

5760
02:40:12,510 --> 02:40:13,980
she was by herself for

5761
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:18,060
some reason and she fucking got out
of there and got in the cart and,

5762
02:40:18,170 --> 02:40:19,500
and then she just started laughing.

5763
02:40:19,830 --> 02:40:20,663
Oh my God.

5764
02:40:22,120 --> 02:40:23,310
You believe that shit.

5765
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:24,390
My little mother,

5766
02:40:24,391 --> 02:40:26,130
my little five foot two mother,

5767
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:31,160
oh my God would have been a
tasty meal happen so quick.

5768
02:40:33,210 --> 02:40:35,070
Better than a dear old lady.

5769
02:40:35,071 --> 02:40:35,311
Nice,

5770
02:40:35,311 --> 02:40:35,731
soft,

5771
02:40:35,731 --> 02:40:36,630
all lady.

5772
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:37,590
Way more tender.

5773
02:40:37,890 --> 02:40:38,723
Yeah.

5774
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:39,990
Corn Fed.

5775
02:40:41,580 --> 02:40:42,391
My mom's corn fed.

5776
02:40:42,391 --> 02:40:43,224
I never told you that.

5777
02:40:43,410 --> 02:40:43,670
Yeah.

5778
02:40:43,670 --> 02:40:44,190
Yeah.

5779
02:40:44,190 --> 02:40:45,840
I thought she was organic now.

5780
02:40:45,841 --> 02:40:47,970
Now we let her free range sometimes.

5781
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:51,630
Great story about a car chase.

5782
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:56,790
The cops are chasing this too with Solon
car and the guy jumps off a bridge into

5783
02:40:56,791 --> 02:40:59,220
the water and immediately
gets eaten by alligators.

5784
02:40:59,550 --> 02:41:00,630
Wow.

5785
02:41:00,870 --> 02:41:03,000
He's like a little overpass over river,

5786
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:05,310
which is hops out of the fucking car.

5787
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:07,710
Jumps into the river and smash.

5788
02:41:08,070 --> 02:41:10,290
He lands right in front of an alligator.

5789
02:41:10,470 --> 02:41:10,921
No,

5790
02:41:10,921 --> 02:41:13,230
she'll get Jackson in front of the cops.

5791
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:14,930
Wow.

5792
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:16,993
What do you do

5793
02:41:17,060 --> 02:41:17,691
of your cop?

5794
02:41:17,691 --> 02:41:18,291
Do you shoot it?

5795
02:41:18,291 --> 02:41:18,980
The alligator?

5796
02:41:18,980 --> 02:41:20,900
Do you try to kill the
alligator was calling the guy.

5797
02:41:20,930 --> 02:41:21,620
Good point.

5798
02:41:21,620 --> 02:41:21,861
I mean,

5799
02:41:21,861 --> 02:41:24,950
that's a reckless thing to be doing
when there's a lot of thrashing around.

5800
02:41:24,951 --> 02:41:26,630
You just let it get to empty your clip.

5801
02:41:26,720 --> 02:41:27,560
Pap Pap pap,

5802
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:28,410
you know,

5803
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:28,611
I mean,

5804
02:41:28,611 --> 02:41:31,490
how much distance is there between
the bridge and the water would,

5805
02:41:31,790 --> 02:41:32,623
what can the cop did it?

5806
02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:32,951
Well,

5807
02:41:32,951 --> 02:41:34,180
you know the guy's going to die.

5808
02:41:34,181 --> 02:41:35,014
So I think it's a,

5809
02:41:35,110 --> 02:41:37,690
I think it's a safe bet
to take some shots anyway.

5810
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:41,000
I think it's a not safe bet to take
some shots because if you're a cop,

5811
02:41:41,001 --> 02:41:42,530
what have you hit the guy and they said,

5812
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:42,711
oh,

5813
02:41:42,711 --> 02:41:46,370
you shot and trying to cover
up by fucking alligators.

5814
02:41:46,371 --> 02:41:47,204
Eat them.

5815
02:41:47,220 --> 02:41:48,053
It's true.

5816
02:41:48,130 --> 02:41:49,290
You got to let the alligator eat them.

5817
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:53,640
Now you got to save your job here about
the guy who was the guy flying a plane

5818
02:41:53,641 --> 02:41:56,420
from a Florida to Cuba or,

5819
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:57,600
or Cuba to Florida,

5820
02:41:57,720 --> 02:42:02,720
and the plain fucking went down and he
survived the crash and then got eaten by

5821
02:42:04,801 --> 02:42:05,634
sharks.

5822
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:15,750
That's so fucked up and said that 20
minute period where you're floating in the

5823
02:42:15,751 --> 02:42:16,111
water,

5824
02:42:16,111 --> 02:42:18,240
but you're thankful and
you're almost giddy.

5825
02:42:18,450 --> 02:42:19,260
I did it.

5826
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:20,550
I fucking survived.

5827
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:21,413
Oh my God.

5828
02:42:21,870 --> 02:42:22,560
Yeah.

5829
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:23,393
Bad Day.

5830
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:23,661
Well,

5831
02:42:23,661 --> 02:42:26,600
you know that story about the World
War II boat that sank and the guys were

5832
02:42:26,601 --> 02:42:29,720
floating around at sea for several days
and most of them got eaten by sharks.

5833
02:42:29,780 --> 02:42:30,350
Oh,

5834
02:42:30,350 --> 02:42:33,080
that's the story that they talk
about in the beginning of jaws.

5835
02:42:33,560 --> 02:42:34,393
Yeah.

5836
02:42:34,830 --> 02:42:36,240
Remember where the captain,

5837
02:42:36,700 --> 02:42:40,320
the captains at the fucking scars
and he starts talking about his,

5838
02:42:40,321 --> 02:42:40,531
uh,

5839
02:42:40,531 --> 02:42:41,490
his time on the boat.

5840
02:42:41,910 --> 02:42:42,770
Do you remember that scenery?

5841
02:42:42,810 --> 02:42:43,531
Scheider no,

5842
02:42:43,531 --> 02:42:44,251
not Roy Scheider.

5843
02:42:44,251 --> 02:42:45,480
The guy was talking to Roy Scheider.

5844
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:46,373
Okay.

5845
02:42:46,620 --> 02:42:47,370
Who's that guy?

5846
02:42:47,370 --> 02:42:48,330
What's that guy's name again?

5847
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:49,680
Old Time actor.

5848
02:42:49,681 --> 02:42:50,850
The guy was fucking amazing.

5849
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:53,070
Spool up jaws.

5850
02:42:53,150 --> 02:42:53,990
I know you said it too quick.

5851
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:54,833
Richard Dreyfus.

5852
02:42:54,930 --> 02:42:55,261
No,

5853
02:42:55,261 --> 02:42:55,441
no,

5854
02:42:55,441 --> 02:42:55,591
no,

5855
02:42:55,591 --> 02:42:55,860
no,

5856
02:42:55,860 --> 02:42:56,070
no,

5857
02:42:56,070 --> 02:42:56,131
no,

5858
02:42:56,131 --> 02:42:56,310
no.

5859
02:42:56,310 --> 02:42:57,780
Richard Dreyfus was the scientist.

5860
02:42:58,050 --> 02:42:59,580
Roy Scheider was the sheriff.

5861
02:42:59,581 --> 02:43:01,170
Richard Dreyfus was the scientist.

5862
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:02,220
And then there's uh,

5863
02:43:02,280 --> 02:43:03,180
an older gentleman.

5864
02:43:03,960 --> 02:43:05,570
Oh yeah.

5865
02:43:05,571 --> 02:43:06,330
Right.

5866
02:43:06,330 --> 02:43:07,500
He steals that fucking,

5867
02:43:07,790 --> 02:43:08,623
yeah,

5868
02:43:08,720 --> 02:43:09,980
he steals up movie.

5869
02:43:10,190 --> 02:43:10,990
Where is he?

5870
02:43:10,990 --> 02:43:11,823
Right here.

5871
02:43:11,950 --> 02:43:12,100
He

5872
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:13,510
steals that fucking movie.

5873
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:17,470
He steals how fucking
movie you believe him.

5874
02:43:17,620 --> 02:43:17,831
Wait,

5875
02:43:17,831 --> 02:43:18,970
so what was the opening scene?

5876
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:21,040
Not the opening scene,

5877
02:43:21,070 --> 02:43:23,380
but he describes what it was like.

5878
02:43:23,620 --> 02:43:23,771
No,

5879
02:43:23,771 --> 02:43:25,090
that's a different shark attack.

5880
02:43:25,690 --> 02:43:26,680
So typed in World War II.

5881
02:43:26,720 --> 02:43:27,551
Show the naval ship.

5882
02:43:27,551 --> 02:43:27,701
Yeah,

5883
02:43:27,701 --> 02:43:28,061
that's it.

5884
02:43:28,061 --> 02:43:28,421
That's it.

5885
02:43:28,421 --> 02:43:28,960
I'm sorry.

5886
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:31,330
I was thinking when I said the
worst shark attack in history,

5887
02:43:31,331 --> 02:43:34,750
I was thinking it was that story about
New Jersey with a bull sharks killed

5888
02:43:34,751 --> 02:43:35,584
people.

5889
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:37,750
Scroll back up so I can
see what it says here.

5890
02:43:39,490 --> 02:43:42,850
1945 US naval ship was sunk
by a Japanese submarine.

5891
02:43:42,851 --> 02:43:45,460
The ship's sinking was just the
beginning of the sailors nightmare.

5892
02:43:45,461 --> 02:43:45,611
Yeah,

5893
02:43:45,611 --> 02:43:46,420
that's the boat.

5894
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:47,253
That's the story.

5895
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:48,250
How many people died?

5896
02:43:48,340 --> 02:43:48,581
Hello?

5897
02:43:48,581 --> 02:43:49,510
Shit load.

5898
02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:50,913
Let's see.

5899
02:43:52,230 --> 02:43:52,890
Nope,

5900
02:43:52,890 --> 02:43:53,140
don't.

5901
02:43:53,140 --> 02:43:58,140
Most 300 people died of the 1,196 men
aboard 900 made it into the water alive.

5902
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:02,133
Oh,

5903
02:44:02,230 --> 02:44:03,220
there are a deal.

5904
02:44:03,650 --> 02:44:03,970
Right?

5905
02:44:03,970 --> 02:44:04,601
So that's,

5906
02:44:04,601 --> 02:44:07,180
that's how many survived the crash.

5907
02:44:07,210 --> 02:44:10,270
So there's 900 of them that are alive now.

5908
02:44:10,271 --> 02:44:11,860
How many of them make it to the end

5909
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:17,000
out of 900 scroll and Scroll
and Scroll and Scroll it.

5910
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:18,140
Days Pass.

5911
02:44:18,710 --> 02:44:18,891
Yeah.

5912
02:44:18,891 --> 02:44:19,310
This is,

5913
02:44:19,310 --> 02:44:21,340
they're just giving you the full
line of the story than I giving you.

5914
02:44:21,350 --> 02:44:22,640
Just the actual facts.

5915
02:44:23,350 --> 02:44:26,360
317 317 remained.

5916
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:27,313
So,

5917
02:44:28,070 --> 02:44:28,570
okay,

5918
02:44:28,570 --> 02:44:30,850
so almost 600 people got to eat

5919
02:44:31,250 --> 02:44:34,880
estimates of the number who die from
shark attacks range from a few dozen to

5920
02:44:34,881 --> 02:44:36,440
almost 150

5921
02:44:36,510 --> 02:44:39,240
so the other people die
from other things probably.

5922
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:40,040
Oh,

5923
02:44:40,040 --> 02:44:41,760
heat stroke being in the water.

5924
02:44:42,030 --> 02:44:42,863
It could be a lot.

5925
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:44,850
And so I bet when those guys died,

5926
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:46,800
then the sharks ate them
and it got even worse.

5927
02:44:46,890 --> 02:44:47,940
Fuck man.

5928
02:44:48,060 --> 02:44:48,893
Wow,

5929
02:44:49,050 --> 02:44:50,160
that's fucking crazy.

5930
02:44:50,161 --> 02:44:52,860
Just imagine 150 people eaten by sharks,

5931
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:55,440
the amount of blood in the water,

5932
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:57,060
fucking Christ,

5933
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:00,673
you know?

5934
02:45:00,720 --> 02:45:05,610
But when you're around any kind of
thing that can eat you and kill you,

5935
02:45:05,730 --> 02:45:07,830
it puts it all into
perspective that you're not,

5936
02:45:07,980 --> 02:45:09,270
you're not around that enough.

5937
02:45:09,790 --> 02:45:10,623
And it's not,

5938
02:45:10,650 --> 02:45:12,420
it's not like you should
be around it all the time,

5939
02:45:12,421 --> 02:45:13,830
but you should know it's a real thing.

5940
02:45:14,070 --> 02:45:15,000
And when you're around it,

5941
02:45:15,001 --> 02:45:15,480
you go like,

5942
02:45:15,480 --> 02:45:16,313
oh,

5943
02:45:16,710 --> 02:45:17,640
oh sharks just,

5944
02:45:17,670 --> 02:45:18,421
we'll just eat.

5945
02:45:18,421 --> 02:45:20,670
You owe a bear will just eat you.

5946
02:45:20,970 --> 02:45:21,590
Oh,

5947
02:45:21,590 --> 02:45:22,920
a mountain lion will just eat you.

5948
02:45:23,310 --> 02:45:24,143
Oh.

5949
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:26,700
Like these people that got
killed this year was a,

5950
02:45:26,701 --> 02:45:27,840
or 2018 at least,

5951
02:45:27,841 --> 02:45:28,674
was very rare.

5952
02:45:28,710 --> 02:45:30,420
And that two people were documented,

5953
02:45:30,421 --> 02:45:32,490
killed by mountain lions
and the Pacific northwest.

5954
02:45:32,700 --> 02:45:34,590
One guy in Portland outside of Portland,

5955
02:45:34,591 --> 02:45:35,790
and one guy outside of Seattle.

5956
02:45:36,110 --> 02:45:38,010
It's pretty rare that
mountain lions do that.

5957
02:45:38,550 --> 02:45:39,840
But Oh,

5958
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:41,430
mountain lions would just eat you.

5959
02:45:41,910 --> 02:45:42,600
Oh,

5960
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:43,321
that can happen too.

5961
02:45:43,321 --> 02:45:45,630
Like we think we're so safe

5962
02:45:46,030 --> 02:45:46,690
and I think it,

5963
02:45:46,690 --> 02:45:47,161
I think you're right.

5964
02:45:47,161 --> 02:45:48,220
It will keep you in the moment.

5965
02:45:48,221 --> 02:45:50,440
I think we should release like grizzly.

5966
02:45:50,550 --> 02:45:51,040
Yes.

5967
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:54,410
In cities just because like
you might be worried about,

5968
02:45:54,430 --> 02:45:54,541
oh,

5969
02:45:54,541 --> 02:45:54,761
am my,

5970
02:45:54,761 --> 02:45:56,590
the fucking stock market's down,

5971
02:45:56,591 --> 02:45:58,000
or I think my wife's cheating.

5972
02:45:59,440 --> 02:46:00,710
And you're right back in the,

5973
02:46:00,990 --> 02:46:01,231
yeah,

5974
02:46:01,231 --> 02:46:02,064
you're in the moment.

5975
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:04,500
But then you're going to have to allow
people to be armed to protect themselves.

5976
02:46:04,501 --> 02:46:05,760
Guys going to have open carry,

5977
02:46:06,300 --> 02:46:09,250
fucking ar slung around their shoulders
looking out for bears everywhere.

5978
02:46:09,560 --> 02:46:10,341
Taking your kid to school,

5979
02:46:10,341 --> 02:46:11,300
you better bring the rifle.

5980
02:46:12,890 --> 02:46:14,300
She's only two blocks away.

5981
02:46:14,320 --> 02:46:14,750
Yeah,

5982
02:46:14,750 --> 02:46:15,080
Bro.

5983
02:46:15,080 --> 02:46:15,850
Bringing the rifle.

5984
02:46:15,850 --> 02:46:17,360
I saw bear here a couple of days ago,

5985
02:46:17,400 --> 02:46:17,870
right?

5986
02:46:17,870 --> 02:46:21,410
Imagine you walk outside your house and
you hear a branch snap and you turn and

5987
02:46:21,411 --> 02:46:25,370
you see a 900 pound wild dog like thing.

5988
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:26,730
And that's not,

5989
02:46:26,730 --> 02:46:27,580
that's not one shot.

5990
02:46:27,581 --> 02:46:29,690
That's gotta be a pretty good
gun to take that thing down.

5991
02:46:30,030 --> 02:46:32,150
You're not going to take it out
with like a nine millimeter.

5992
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:32,900
Yeah.

5993
02:46:32,900 --> 02:46:34,040
It's just going to eat your bullets.

5994
02:46:34,041 --> 02:46:34,760
Right.

5995
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:35,810
It's going to kill you anyway.

5996
02:46:35,930 --> 02:46:37,010
Fuck yeah.

5997
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:38,340
Okay.

5998
02:46:38,340 --> 02:46:39,173
You'd have to,

5999
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:42,960
you'd have to have a perfect shot right
in the perfect part of its brain to shut

6000
02:46:42,961 --> 02:46:45,600
it off quick to prevent
you from getting mauled.

6001
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:47,130
Yeah.

6002
02:46:47,130 --> 02:46:48,390
The amount of strength that they have to,

6003
02:46:48,391 --> 02:46:52,200
you'd be like a water balloon
if you like tearing open a bag,

6004
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:54,390
like a Ziploc bag full of Jello.

6005
02:46:54,450 --> 02:46:55,283
Yeah.

6006
02:46:55,320 --> 02:46:56,550
They just rip you apart.

6007
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:58,620
He had gone back to that movie revenant.

6008
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:01,710
That fucking bear attack was insane.

6009
02:47:01,810 --> 02:47:04,200
The bear attacks nothing
compared to what really happens.

6010
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:06,690
Like if he really got bit by a bear,

6011
02:47:06,691 --> 02:47:07,231
but like that,

6012
02:47:07,231 --> 02:47:09,510
like he probably would be destroyed.

6013
02:47:09,960 --> 02:47:12,090
Like I think the guy that was the,

6014
02:47:12,180 --> 02:47:14,310
that we're really happened
to them in real life.

6015
02:47:14,311 --> 02:47:16,710
It's kind of base really
loosely on a story.

6016
02:47:17,010 --> 02:47:20,040
I think he got kind of like a
little malt and that was enough.

6017
02:47:20,130 --> 02:47:20,400
Yeah.

6018
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:22,740
A little malt leave you like that would,

6019
02:47:22,741 --> 02:47:24,270
that bear was throwing
him around for like,

6020
02:47:24,390 --> 02:47:25,140
yeah,

6021
02:47:25,140 --> 02:47:26,070
that bear would have killed you.

6022
02:47:26,100 --> 02:47:26,670
Yeah.

6023
02:47:26,670 --> 02:47:28,140
You'd have no bones left.

6024
02:47:28,310 --> 02:47:28,570
Right.

6025
02:47:28,570 --> 02:47:31,080
Snapped everything into a fine powder.

6026
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:33,420
Just crush you and then eat you.

6027
02:47:33,421 --> 02:47:33,720
Right.

6028
02:47:33,720 --> 02:47:34,381
I'm fuck yeah,

6029
02:47:34,381 --> 02:47:35,160
why not eat you?

6030
02:47:35,160 --> 02:47:36,510
Especially when she starts stinking.

6031
02:47:36,720 --> 02:47:37,830
They like to burry things.

6032
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:39,110
Let them rot for a while.

6033
02:47:40,590 --> 02:47:41,423
They do.

6034
02:47:41,430 --> 02:47:46,430
My friend Adam and he shot a moose in
Canada and a bear's claimed it and he went

6035
02:47:46,981 --> 02:47:48,030
back and there's a video of it.

6036
02:47:48,031 --> 02:47:49,530
It's so spooky.

6037
02:47:49,590 --> 02:47:50,470
Whoa.

6038
02:47:50,490 --> 02:47:51,580
Says buried.

6039
02:47:52,050 --> 02:47:53,910
It's a giant big ass moose.

6040
02:47:54,060 --> 02:47:54,841
By the time they got,

6041
02:47:54,841 --> 02:47:55,021
you know,

6042
02:47:55,021 --> 02:47:56,520
they shoot it and then it goes,

6043
02:47:56,580 --> 02:47:58,350
it runs away and then
you have to track it.

6044
02:47:58,351 --> 02:47:59,940
You have to let it let it die.

6045
02:48:00,030 --> 02:48:00,811
It takes a little while.

6046
02:48:00,811 --> 02:48:03,990
So the smart thing to do is
to sit out for a couple hours.

6047
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:05,640
It'll be dead for sure.

6048
02:48:05,910 --> 02:48:10,140
But what you don't want to do
is spook it while it's injured.

6049
02:48:10,170 --> 02:48:10,391
If,

6050
02:48:10,391 --> 02:48:11,640
if it's not a perfect hit,

6051
02:48:11,670 --> 02:48:14,490
if it runs away because then
it's going to just keep running.

6052
02:48:14,491 --> 02:48:16,110
You can run for a long time on adrenaline.

6053
02:48:16,410 --> 02:48:16,911
So the,

6054
02:48:16,911 --> 02:48:17,141
the,

6055
02:48:17,141 --> 02:48:19,800
the correct move is if you
don't see an animal die,

6056
02:48:19,980 --> 02:48:20,590
you don't see,

6057
02:48:20,590 --> 02:48:21,540
you see it run into the woods.

6058
02:48:21,720 --> 02:48:25,200
You wait and you wait just
as a precautionary measure.

6059
02:48:25,350 --> 02:48:25,650
Well,

6060
02:48:25,650 --> 02:48:25,841
the,

6061
02:48:25,841 --> 02:48:29,040
the animal died in seconds and
a bear claim did immediately.

6062
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:31,140
It died probably right in front of them.

6063
02:48:31,170 --> 02:48:32,160
What state was this?

6064
02:48:32,220 --> 02:48:33,270
This was in Alaska.

6065
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:36,030
So the bear is just there.

6066
02:48:36,060 --> 02:48:37,500
The Moose dies right in front of him.

6067
02:48:37,501 --> 02:48:37,770
He's like,

6068
02:48:37,770 --> 02:48:38,603
oh look at that.

6069
02:48:38,790 --> 02:48:39,623
That's mine.

6070
02:48:40,230 --> 02:48:40,590
Yeah.

6071
02:48:40,590 --> 02:48:43,020
It starts eating it and
he starts covering it up.

6072
02:48:43,380 --> 02:48:44,880
So eat some of it covers it up.

6073
02:48:44,881 --> 02:48:47,640
They come tracking in a hour later or so.

6074
02:48:47,830 --> 02:48:49,140
It's already covered in dark.

6075
02:48:49,560 --> 02:48:50,310
Wow.

6076
02:48:50,310 --> 02:48:50,760
I'm like,

6077
02:48:50,760 --> 02:48:51,750
oh no,

6078
02:48:51,780 --> 02:48:53,610
that's crazy.

6079
02:48:53,670 --> 02:48:54,930
Oh yeah.

6080
02:48:54,960 --> 02:48:56,310
Holy Shit.

6081
02:48:56,700 --> 02:48:57,000
Yeah.

6082
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:58,350
Fuck No.

6083
02:48:58,351 --> 02:48:59,130
I don't know.

6084
02:48:59,130 --> 02:49:02,550
Think about what would it take to
take fucking frozen ground myself.

6085
02:49:02,580 --> 02:49:06,780
They might've shot it and taken some of
the meat and we're going back to pack

6086
02:49:06,781 --> 02:49:07,470
it.

6087
02:49:07,470 --> 02:49:09,900
Cause sometimes when you hunt
you'll hunt with one person,

6088
02:49:10,110 --> 02:49:10,381
but when,

6089
02:49:10,381 --> 02:49:12,210
then you go back to pack out a big animal,

6090
02:49:12,211 --> 02:49:14,040
you bring like five or
six guys to help you.

6091
02:49:14,430 --> 02:49:15,600
But this is the video of it.

6092
02:49:15,860 --> 02:49:17,070
Look at this to give me some volume.

6093
02:49:18,970 --> 02:49:20,140
Oh Moose is very

6094
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:23,123
under the area.

6095
02:49:25,610 --> 02:49:27,140
Whoa.

6096
02:49:27,750 --> 02:49:28,583
Okay.

6097
02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:30,210
Yeah,

6098
02:49:30,210 --> 02:49:31,043
I don't like this.

6099
02:49:36,770 --> 02:49:38,060
So everything is like,

6100
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:38,420
you know,

6101
02:49:38,420 --> 02:49:41,390
five and a half feet
high grass or you know,

6102
02:49:41,391 --> 02:49:41,651
you see,

6103
02:49:41,651 --> 02:49:44,600
I mean how tall is that grass for
four and a half feet at least.

6104
02:49:44,670 --> 02:49:44,860
Yeah.

6105
02:49:44,860 --> 02:49:46,580
So bears could be in that shit.

6106
02:49:47,250 --> 02:49:48,590
They could be hunkered down in that shit.

6107
02:49:48,770 --> 02:49:52,500
So I'm seeing the skull on the
ground and the skull skinned out.

6108
02:49:52,520 --> 02:49:55,580
So what that means to me is that he
had already started butchering the,

6109
02:49:55,581 --> 02:49:57,680
the Moose and probably went back to it.

6110
02:49:58,970 --> 02:50:02,480
So that's kind of correct that whether
it was right about that or not,

6111
02:50:02,930 --> 02:50:04,070
but so this is what happened.

6112
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:04,850
Um,

6113
02:50:04,850 --> 02:50:07,540
they can only take some of the meat
because they were terrified the bear is

6114
02:50:07,550 --> 02:50:08,061
going to come back.

6115
02:50:08,061 --> 02:50:10,930
And I don't even think they
had a gun on them and you know,

6116
02:50:10,940 --> 02:50:12,080
they're just scan in the area,

6117
02:50:13,130 --> 02:50:13,731
see how the,

6118
02:50:13,731 --> 02:50:13,971
the,

6119
02:50:13,971 --> 02:50:17,240
the moots the head is
already off of the antlers,

6120
02:50:18,180 --> 02:50:18,680
you know?

6121
02:50:18,680 --> 02:50:20,090
And so this is the next video.

6122
02:50:22,480 --> 02:50:23,440
That's scary shit man.

6123
02:50:23,570 --> 02:50:24,820
So they didn't even see the bear.

6124
02:50:24,830 --> 02:50:25,840
They just know it was a bear.

6125
02:50:25,900 --> 02:50:26,650
Exactly.

6126
02:50:26,650 --> 02:50:27,483
Yeah.

6127
02:50:28,450 --> 02:50:33,040
Think about the strength to take
frozen earth like that and dig it out.

6128
02:50:33,260 --> 02:50:34,093
Yeah.

6129
02:50:34,730 --> 02:50:35,810
What's the type of bear?

6130
02:50:36,170 --> 02:50:36,411
You know,

6131
02:50:36,411 --> 02:50:37,790
if you run into a black bear,

6132
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,010
you're more likely to
be thought of as food.

6133
02:50:40,100 --> 02:50:40,933
It's kind of interesting.

6134
02:50:41,300 --> 02:50:42,121
Like you're more like,

6135
02:50:42,121 --> 02:50:46,190
like predation on humans is
more common with black bears.

6136
02:50:46,220 --> 02:50:47,810
They just decided to try to eat you.

6137
02:50:48,380 --> 02:50:49,250
But uh,

6138
02:50:49,310 --> 02:50:50,390
with grizzlies,

6139
02:50:51,380 --> 02:50:52,400
grizzlies are rare.

6140
02:50:52,430 --> 02:50:54,500
It's rare that a grizzly decides to eat.

6141
02:50:54,501 --> 02:50:56,570
You decides to chase you down and eat you.

6142
02:50:56,571 --> 02:51:01,571
It's more common that you fuck up and
run into a female or you tried to steal

6143
02:51:01,731 --> 02:51:02,720
his food like that.

6144
02:51:02,750 --> 02:51:05,330
Like they had to get the fuck out of
there because if he just decided to run at

6145
02:51:05,331 --> 02:51:05,630
them,

6146
02:51:05,630 --> 02:51:07,250
they got a real giant problem.

6147
02:51:07,251 --> 02:51:08,570
Most of the time of bear won't though.

6148
02:51:08,571 --> 02:51:09,231
They're cautious.

6149
02:51:09,231 --> 02:51:09,621
They'll stay,

6150
02:51:09,621 --> 02:51:11,180
they'll hang back because they figured,

6151
02:51:11,181 --> 02:51:11,601
what are you going to do?

6152
02:51:11,601 --> 02:51:12,710
Are you gonna eat that whole Moose?

6153
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:13,731
You're going to leave me some.

6154
02:51:13,731 --> 02:51:14,564
I ate a bunch.

6155
02:51:14,690 --> 02:51:15,570
I'm going to wait a little while,

6156
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:16,401
see what the fuck you're doing.

6157
02:51:16,401 --> 02:51:17,450
He's probably full anyway,

6158
02:51:17,890 --> 02:51:18,980
but they had to get out of there.

6159
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:21,560
They only took her a little bit of the
meat and they took off like this is too

6160
02:51:21,561 --> 02:51:22,230
dangerous.

6161
02:51:22,230 --> 02:51:23,063
Wow.

6162
02:51:25,370 --> 02:51:26,360
They used to be everywhere,

6163
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:27,750
used to be everywhere in California.

6164
02:51:27,751 --> 02:51:28,920
That's why it's on our flag.

6165
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:30,630
We killed them all.

6166
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:31,500
Not We.

6167
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:32,610
You and I were in Boston.

6168
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:32,881
Yeah.

6169
02:51:32,881 --> 02:51:34,260
We didn't kill anybody to kill anybody,

6170
02:51:34,290 --> 02:51:36,840
but they killed all the
grizzly bears in California,

6171
02:51:37,410 --> 02:51:38,880
but it's still an under state flag.

6172
02:51:39,240 --> 02:51:40,770
The state flag has a fucking grizzly bear,

6173
02:51:40,771 --> 02:51:42,300
but in California it
doesn't have any grizzlies.

6174
02:51:42,400 --> 02:51:43,120
Right.

6175
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:43,750
It's weird.

6176
02:51:43,750 --> 02:51:43,951
Yeah.

6177
02:51:43,951 --> 02:51:45,700
I was in Alaska once and they were,

6178
02:51:45,730 --> 02:51:47,350
they were like raccoons.

6179
02:51:47,380 --> 02:51:50,110
They were behind restaurants
going through dumpsters,

6180
02:51:50,540 --> 02:51:53,200
grizzly bears or brown
bears or black parents.

6181
02:51:53,380 --> 02:51:54,340
I think they were,

6182
02:51:54,341 --> 02:51:56,140
I don't want both the bolt up.

6183
02:51:56,141 --> 02:51:57,610
Their blackberries become more,

6184
02:51:57,670 --> 02:51:58,400
will they all be calling become a

6185
02:51:58,400 --> 02:52:01,550
problem if they start getting around
garbage cause then they're smart.

6186
02:52:01,580 --> 02:52:02,540
They know where the garbage is.

6187
02:52:02,560 --> 02:52:02,770
Yeah.

6188
02:52:02,770 --> 02:52:03,603
Just keep returning.

6189
02:52:04,340 --> 02:52:05,020
Right.

6190
02:52:05,020 --> 02:52:06,300
There's a place called Lovech,

6191
02:52:06,350 --> 02:52:06,761
the vet,

6192
02:52:06,761 --> 02:52:07,520
California.

6193
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:11,140
It's off the five and it's named that
way for the last guy to die in a bear

6194
02:52:11,141 --> 02:52:12,160
attack in California.

6195
02:52:12,250 --> 02:52:12,940
Oh really?

6196
02:52:12,940 --> 02:52:13,773
Yeah.

6197
02:52:13,810 --> 02:52:16,780
They'll like enough he fuck enough.

6198
02:52:16,990 --> 02:52:20,140
Apparently they wound up digging this guy
up afterwards to find out the story is

6199
02:52:20,141 --> 02:52:21,520
true and he was just in pieces.

6200
02:52:23,360 --> 02:52:24,193
Shit.

6201
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:25,600
All right,

6202
02:52:25,601 --> 02:52:30,601
so coastal bear to bear
attack shark attack or dying
in a cryogenics tank dying,

6203
02:52:34,031 --> 02:52:35,980
the crowd would be way less painful.

6204
02:52:36,100 --> 02:52:36,970
You would just freeze.

6205
02:52:37,060 --> 02:52:37,900
That's the way to go.

6206
02:52:38,050 --> 02:52:39,520
I don't know if that's
the way to go though,

6207
02:52:39,820 --> 02:52:41,140
because then you're
not going to get eaten.

6208
02:52:41,750 --> 02:52:43,810
Like shouldn't you return to nature?

6209
02:52:43,840 --> 02:52:44,673
Yeah.

6210
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:48,340
I mean you really should be eating and
I'd rather be eaten by one of my con,

6211
02:52:48,341 --> 02:52:49,480
which is a ground animal.

6212
02:52:49,690 --> 02:52:51,160
Those fucking cons in the water.

6213
02:52:51,250 --> 02:52:53,950
I can eat and buy those heartless
assholes and don't even take care of their

6214
02:52:53,951 --> 02:52:54,430
babies.

6215
02:52:54,430 --> 02:52:55,090
Yeah.

6216
02:52:55,090 --> 02:52:55,391
You know,

6217
02:52:55,391 --> 02:52:56,980
a bear at least takes care of their young,

6218
02:52:57,170 --> 02:52:57,930
I mean they're,

6219
02:52:57,930 --> 02:52:58,360
they're,

6220
02:52:58,360 --> 02:52:59,140
they're shit eds.

6221
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:00,310
They eat their babies too.

6222
02:53:00,700 --> 02:53:01,810
And especially males.

6223
02:53:01,870 --> 02:53:03,490
Males kill babies left and right.

6224
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:05,620
They actually actively go
after them and kill them.

6225
02:53:05,740 --> 02:53:06,640
But sort of sharks,

6226
02:53:06,940 --> 02:53:07,300
sharks,

6227
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:09,460
sharks have inter wound competition.

6228
02:53:09,770 --> 02:53:10,071
They've,

6229
02:53:10,071 --> 02:53:11,950
they eat each other inside the womb.

6230
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:13,060
Oh no shit.

6231
02:53:13,420 --> 02:53:14,560
Wow.

6232
02:53:14,590 --> 02:53:15,880
You ever see like a,

6233
02:53:15,940 --> 02:53:17,890
an Mri of sharks in the womb?

6234
02:53:17,950 --> 02:53:20,410
Now it's a monster movie.

6235
02:53:20,830 --> 02:53:21,940
That's insane.

6236
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:22,833
Is that Real,

6237
02:53:24,130 --> 02:53:24,761
those images?

6238
02:53:24,761 --> 02:53:25,600
That's a good question.

6239
02:53:25,630 --> 02:53:28,270
I've seen those elements that I feel
like it might've been from a movie,

6240
02:53:28,271 --> 02:53:29,170
but I'm looking at now.

6241
02:53:29,320 --> 02:53:30,153
Let's see.

6242
02:53:30,250 --> 02:53:31,083
I think it's real.

6243
02:53:31,090 --> 02:53:34,030
I think the reason why I thought it was
fake and then I found out it was real.

6244
02:53:34,031 --> 02:53:36,850
It's one of those either I thought it
was real and I found out it was fake or I

6245
02:53:36,851 --> 02:53:38,230
thought it was fake and
I found out it's real.

6246
02:53:38,530 --> 02:53:39,363
But the image is,

6247
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:40,091
if it's real,

6248
02:53:40,091 --> 02:53:41,200
it's fucking amazing.

6249
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:42,880
It's these little monsters inside,

6250
02:53:42,881 --> 02:53:43,570
uh,

6251
02:53:43,570 --> 02:53:44,980
inside a womb and then
you've got to think,

6252
02:53:45,670 --> 02:53:46,300
you know,

6253
02:53:46,300 --> 02:53:47,140
I guess no one had it.

6254
02:53:47,141 --> 02:53:47,800
Fuck it.

6255
02:53:47,800 --> 02:53:49,240
Cause they just lay the
eggs out in the men.

6256
02:53:49,241 --> 02:53:50,320
Just Jews on the eggs.

6257
02:53:50,830 --> 02:53:51,280
Really?

6258
02:53:51,280 --> 02:53:51,581
Yeah.

6259
02:53:51,581 --> 02:53:52,270
That's how it works.

6260
02:53:52,270 --> 02:53:54,370
They don't fuck have a terrible life.

6261
02:53:55,180 --> 02:53:55,900
Yeah.

6262
02:53:55,900 --> 02:53:57,490
The women lay the eggs on the floor.

6263
02:53:57,491 --> 02:53:58,180
I could salmon.

6264
02:53:58,180 --> 02:53:58,871
That's what happens.

6265
02:53:58,871 --> 02:53:59,860
That happens with trout.

6266
02:54:00,460 --> 02:54:03,460
They lay the eggs out in the men
come by and shoot loads all over him.

6267
02:54:03,510 --> 02:54:04,343
Yeah.

6268
02:54:04,930 --> 02:54:07,120
And then the things pop up and
no one takes care of anybody.

6269
02:54:07,540 --> 02:54:08,373
Wow.

6270
02:54:08,710 --> 02:54:10,960
All those kids that
grow up without parents.

6271
02:54:10,961 --> 02:54:12,270
Parents don't give a fuck about them.

6272
02:54:12,280 --> 02:54:13,113
The parents will eat him.

6273
02:54:13,420 --> 02:54:14,000
Yep.

6274
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:15,430
Happens all the time with a little fish.

6275
02:54:15,640 --> 02:54:17,020
No bigger fishes.

6276
02:54:17,021 --> 02:54:17,854
Hunger this eat that.

6277
02:54:17,950 --> 02:54:19,600
They don't even know if there
was parking and I'm hitting it,

6278
02:54:19,601 --> 02:54:20,434
I'm hungry.

6279
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:21,460
They just have,

6280
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:25,780
they have a system of
maintaining a population and
when there's not enough food,

6281
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:26,740
you know,

6282
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:27,880
some of you guys got to go,

6283
02:54:28,210 --> 02:54:28,901
I don't remember this.

6284
02:54:28,901 --> 02:54:29,930
And Finding Nemo was there.

6285
02:54:29,931 --> 02:54:30,760
It wasn't in there.

6286
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:31,900
He fucking left it out.

6287
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:32,740
They didn't even eat.

6288
02:54:32,740 --> 02:54:33,573
Yeah.

6289
02:54:33,790 --> 02:54:34,960
All those bare movies.

6290
02:54:35,020 --> 02:54:36,370
The movies about bears from Disney,

6291
02:54:36,380 --> 02:54:37,000
they don't eat.

6292
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:37,300
Yeah.

6293
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:40,300
How come they're not chasing down
Moose and he didn't asshole first.

6294
02:54:40,301 --> 02:54:41,134
Hey

6295
02:54:42,450 --> 02:54:45,430
Taryn Bambi apart eaten
her face while back.

6296
02:54:45,431 --> 02:54:47,830
Legs are kicking and the
bears was holding him down.

6297
02:54:47,831 --> 02:54:48,020
Neat.

6298
02:54:48,020 --> 02:54:50,410
And like a grape eaten that ass.

6299
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:51,310
Yeah,

6300
02:54:51,310 --> 02:54:52,740
they go asshole first all the time.

6301
02:54:53,830 --> 02:54:54,663
Yeah.

6302
02:54:54,820 --> 02:54:55,151
It's,

6303
02:54:55,151 --> 02:54:55,630
um,

6304
02:54:55,630 --> 02:54:59,560
it's very inconvenient to show that
in the lion king to show how the law,

6305
02:54:59,590 --> 02:55:01,000
how do these lines were there?

6306
02:55:01,030 --> 02:55:01,830
Where's their food?

6307
02:55:01,830 --> 02:55:02,663
And they never eat.

6308
02:55:02,740 --> 02:55:03,590
Everything's a battle.

6309
02:55:03,740 --> 02:55:04,070
They're all going

6310
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:06,500
to war with people trying to
rein retain their kingdom.

6311
02:55:06,580 --> 02:55:07,413
Right?

6312
02:55:07,910 --> 02:55:08,840
Where's the snack?

6313
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:09,680
Where's all the food?

6314
02:55:09,680 --> 02:55:10,430
Yeah.

6315
02:55:10,430 --> 02:55:10,910
How come I,

6316
02:55:10,910 --> 02:55:13,760
how am I don't see that
you're fucking with kids.

6317
02:55:13,761 --> 02:55:15,080
You given kids bad information.

6318
02:55:15,110 --> 02:55:16,790
That will be a great movie to do.

6319
02:55:16,791 --> 02:55:21,020
A feature Leech length animated movie
where you show how it really works.

6320
02:55:21,050 --> 02:55:21,650
Oh my God.

6321
02:55:21,650 --> 02:55:22,221
The killing.

6322
02:55:22,221 --> 02:55:22,790
Awful.

6323
02:55:22,790 --> 02:55:23,250
Yeah.

6324
02:55:23,250 --> 02:55:24,083
Be Awful.

6325
02:55:25,340 --> 02:55:25,910
Yeah.

6326
02:55:25,910 --> 02:55:26,743
Cats,

6327
02:55:26,750 --> 02:55:29,450
cats are the population
control of the world.

6328
02:55:30,080 --> 02:55:35,080
Those motherfuckers faster than everybody
can only eat meat and all they do is

6329
02:55:36,411 --> 02:55:38,870
just run around and try
to catch people slipping,

6330
02:55:39,650 --> 02:55:41,030
try to catch animals slipping.

6331
02:55:41,070 --> 02:55:41,230
Right.

6332
02:55:41,230 --> 02:55:41,781
Tried to catch it.

6333
02:55:41,781 --> 02:55:42,890
And they're just,

6334
02:55:43,070 --> 02:55:44,090
they're just Darwinism.

6335
02:55:44,120 --> 02:55:44,390
Yeah.

6336
02:55:44,390 --> 02:55:45,650
They'll eat bugs and lion king.

6337
02:55:45,770 --> 02:55:46,461
Come on.

6338
02:55:46,461 --> 02:55:47,294
Yeah,

6339
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:48,373
come on.

6340
02:55:48,380 --> 02:55:49,700
That's a bug that he just ate.

6341
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:49,951
Yeah.

6342
02:55:49,951 --> 02:55:50,271
It was like,

6343
02:55:50,271 --> 02:55:50,700
uh,

6344
02:55:50,700 --> 02:55:53,740
they met Tomato Puma and he showed them
how to get grubs or something like that.

6345
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:58,760
And that's what ends up fuck kind of
propaganda horse shit is this that God

6346
02:55:58,890 --> 02:56:00,000
that's anti American.

6347
02:56:00,030 --> 02:56:02,880
What is the way his dad dies isn't
a stampede of like Willdabeast,

6348
02:56:02,930 --> 02:56:04,350
which he probably was attack.

6349
02:56:04,550 --> 02:56:06,900
I just don't remember them showing
that and that movie at all.

6350
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:08,080
That's how they,

6351
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:08,800
yeah.

6352
02:56:08,800 --> 02:56:13,240
See the problem is kids grow up and
they see this stuff and the soft headed

6353
02:56:13,241 --> 02:56:14,074
amongst them.

6354
02:56:14,410 --> 02:56:16,540
Well then think that animals
are really like that,

6355
02:56:16,810 --> 02:56:19,480
so they'll venture out into the
forest to try to make friends.

6356
02:56:19,900 --> 02:56:21,820
You just have to be open spiritually.

6357
02:56:22,060 --> 02:56:22,480
Yeah.

6358
02:56:22,480 --> 02:56:24,040
Just go to the lion's den.

6359
02:56:24,150 --> 02:56:24,520
Yeah.

6360
02:56:24,520 --> 02:56:27,340
Open yourself up spiritually
and let the forest,

6361
02:56:27,341 --> 02:56:28,174
no,

6362
02:56:28,810 --> 02:56:29,531
I talked to a lady once,

6363
02:56:29,531 --> 02:56:32,860
she was a yoga lady and she was
talking about Colorado and she's like,

6364
02:56:32,861 --> 02:56:33,730
when I walk into the woods,

6365
02:56:33,731 --> 02:56:35,380
I just walk out there and say,

6366
02:56:35,800 --> 02:56:36,340
uh,

6367
02:56:36,340 --> 02:56:37,780
I'm walking out here with love.

6368
02:56:37,781 --> 02:56:38,800
Please do not harm me.

6369
02:56:39,310 --> 02:56:39,521
Like,

6370
02:56:39,521 --> 02:56:40,030
yeah,

6371
02:56:40,030 --> 02:56:40,990
that's not going to work.

6372
02:56:41,730 --> 02:56:43,900
They'd like to see or having
your period get back in the car.

6373
02:56:43,960 --> 02:56:44,141
Well,

6374
02:56:44,141 --> 02:56:44,711
not only that,

6375
02:56:44,711 --> 02:56:45,544
they don't,

6376
02:56:45,610 --> 02:56:47,200
it's not a mortality thing.

6377
02:56:47,230 --> 02:56:48,790
It's not a good or bad thing.

6378
02:56:48,820 --> 02:56:50,830
It's like something's going to get eaten.

6379
02:56:50,980 --> 02:56:52,960
If you're out there and
you're the slow thing,

6380
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:54,520
you're going to get eaten.

6381
02:56:54,610 --> 02:56:55,510
No offense,

6382
02:56:55,720 --> 02:56:56,553
this is not,

6383
02:56:57,010 --> 02:56:57,970
no one's mad at you.

6384
02:56:58,510 --> 02:57:00,730
It's just Darwinism that we calf.

6385
02:57:00,760 --> 02:57:00,880
Yeah.

6386
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:01,713
This is not a,

6387
02:57:01,940 --> 02:57:06,940
this is not a discerning organism that's
got moral value that it places on,

6388
02:57:08,110 --> 02:57:08,580
you know,

6389
02:57:08,580 --> 02:57:08,710
uh,

6390
02:57:08,710 --> 02:57:10,840
attacking thugs only or,

6391
02:57:10,841 --> 02:57:12,700
and not going after yoga instructors.

6392
02:57:12,970 --> 02:57:13,803
Hmm.

6393
02:57:13,810 --> 02:57:15,040
No slow shit that I can eat.

6394
02:57:15,070 --> 02:57:15,610
Yup.

6395
02:57:15,610 --> 02:57:16,270
There's,

6396
02:57:16,270 --> 02:57:17,320
they have no language.

6397
02:57:17,350 --> 02:57:17,740
They're just,

6398
02:57:17,740 --> 02:57:22,740
they're just an organism looking to
survive complex set of reinforcements and

6399
02:57:23,321 --> 02:57:28,180
reward systems that are set up for it
to be an incredibly efficient predator.

6400
02:57:29,860 --> 02:57:34,860
Fuck male lines the size
of that fucking hall dude.

6401
02:57:35,140 --> 02:57:38,260
Just the biggest jaws do our full,

6402
02:57:39,090 --> 02:57:39,510
yeah.

6403
02:57:39,510 --> 02:57:40,231
So the shark thing,

6404
02:57:40,231 --> 02:57:44,670
I found articles saying where you
were saying could not find a video.

6405
02:57:44,910 --> 02:57:48,510
And I do believe when we found that
before it was fake and I'm trying to find

6406
02:57:48,511 --> 02:57:50,330
Google even like fake sharping up

6407
02:57:50,390 --> 02:57:51,470
the sharks in the body.

6408
02:57:51,590 --> 02:57:53,330
Just Google Mri image.

6409
02:57:53,490 --> 02:57:55,590
I found something to that
kind of contradicts it though.

6410
02:57:55,591 --> 02:58:00,591
This is a dead shark that they performed
a c section on and there was 98 live

6411
02:58:02,310 --> 02:58:03,410
pups and silent.

6412
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:03,841
Yeah,

6413
02:58:03,841 --> 02:58:04,321
that's true.

6414
02:58:04,321 --> 02:58:06,360
But that doesn't mean that
it happens every time.

6415
02:58:06,361 --> 02:58:06,631
I know.

6416
02:58:06,631 --> 02:58:06,841
I know.

6417
02:58:06,841 --> 02:58:07,141
I know.

6418
02:58:07,141 --> 02:58:10,920
What I had read was that it happens often.

6419
02:58:11,190 --> 02:58:13,290
This is the only thing I
can find a shark pregnancy.

6420
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:18,030
That's 98 look at all those sharks has
nuts and so he's just throwing them in

6421
02:58:18,031 --> 02:58:18,750
the water.

6422
02:58:18,750 --> 02:58:20,280
He's pulling them out and saving them.

6423
02:58:20,790 --> 02:58:21,660
That is nuts,

6424
02:58:21,661 --> 02:58:21,960
man.

6425
02:58:21,960 --> 02:58:24,510
Look at all those little
monsters just swarming around.

6426
02:58:24,950 --> 02:58:25,890
Do you know what the fuck?

6427
02:58:25,891 --> 02:58:26,820
That's crazy.

6428
02:58:26,960 --> 02:58:28,530
Do you know that millions,

6429
02:58:28,830 --> 02:58:31,470
literally millions of sharks are
hunted and killed every year.

6430
02:58:31,890 --> 02:58:32,431
That's crazy.

6431
02:58:32,431 --> 02:58:34,530
All for the soup that she mostly,

6432
02:58:34,720 --> 02:58:35,553
yeah.

6433
02:58:36,030 --> 02:58:39,330
You know that's changed people's attitudes
on shark fishing because people used

6434
02:58:39,331 --> 02:58:41,760
to catch shark and used to get
it at restaurants all the time.

6435
02:58:42,150 --> 02:58:42,631
I don't remember.

6436
02:58:42,631 --> 02:58:44,760
You remember on the east
coast he'd get Maaco Shark.

6437
02:58:44,761 --> 02:58:45,990
You thought you were fucking player.

6438
02:58:46,620 --> 02:58:46,921
Pimp.

6439
02:58:46,921 --> 02:58:49,080
I'm getting some short little lemon.

6440
02:58:49,081 --> 02:58:49,710
Some butter.

6441
02:58:49,710 --> 02:58:50,543
Yeah.

6442
02:58:50,610 --> 02:58:50,791
Right.

6443
02:58:50,791 --> 02:58:52,650
It was a common thing
they'd serve in restaurants.

6444
02:58:53,190 --> 02:58:57,960
How many sharks are fence
research indicates that about
a hundred million sharks

6445
02:58:57,961 --> 02:58:59,160
are killed each year.

6446
02:59:00,150 --> 02:59:00,690
Wow.

6447
02:59:00,690 --> 02:59:02,910
Roughly 11,000 sharks and hour.

6448
02:59:03,780 --> 02:59:04,613
That is incredible.

6449
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:06,180
This is by finning.

6450
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:07,680
That's incredible.

6451
02:59:09,450 --> 02:59:12,450
It's likely that many sharks are
caught without being reported.

6452
02:59:12,730 --> 02:59:12,860
Oh,

6453
02:59:12,860 --> 02:59:13,693
so the,

6454
02:59:14,220 --> 02:59:14,760
okay,

6455
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:17,760
so this is just what the reporting my God,

6456
02:59:19,050 --> 02:59:19,340
people.

6457
02:59:19,340 --> 02:59:20,010
Heck,

6458
02:59:20,010 --> 02:59:23,280
so this is like the first time I can
remember in history that people are

6459
02:59:23,281 --> 02:59:26,100
concerned with people fishing for sharks.

6460
02:59:26,280 --> 02:59:29,640
Because we talked about this was
the the governor in New York.

6461
02:59:29,641 --> 02:59:30,120
Who Was it?

6462
02:59:30,120 --> 02:59:34,800
Who was the cat that got in trouble for
legally catching a shark and cooking it

6463
02:59:34,801 --> 02:59:35,340
and eating it?

6464
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:38,070
I want to say it was the governor
and governor of New York,

6465
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:39,473
but Cuomo,

6466
02:59:40,050 --> 02:59:40,830
I don't know,

6467
02:59:40,830 --> 02:59:41,370
something.

6468
02:59:41,370 --> 02:59:42,360
Maybe the government son,

6469
02:59:42,780 --> 02:59:43,613
whatever the fuck it is.

6470
02:59:44,370 --> 02:59:45,203
Jamie find it.

6471
02:59:45,420 --> 02:59:47,130
Andrew Coma tweeted a picture of herself.

6472
02:59:47,400 --> 02:59:47,730
Yeah.

6473
02:59:47,730 --> 02:59:49,290
After he caught a shark
or something like that.

6474
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:49,591
Yeah,

6475
02:59:49,591 --> 02:59:51,960
so this was all normal when we were kids.

6476
02:59:52,130 --> 02:59:52,891
This was normal as fuck.

6477
02:59:52,891 --> 02:59:53,191
Like that.

6478
02:59:53,191 --> 02:59:55,650
Might as well be a Marlin or a halibut.

6479
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:56,821
Just he got a shock,

6480
02:59:56,821 --> 02:59:56,941
like,

6481
02:59:56,941 --> 02:59:57,181
oh,

6482
02:59:57,181 --> 02:59:57,870
cool.

6483
02:59:57,870 --> 02:59:58,591
What's it taste like?

6484
02:59:58,591 --> 02:59:58,711
Oh,

6485
02:59:58,711 --> 02:59:59,190
it's good.

6486
02:59:59,190 --> 02:59:59,580
It's good.

6487
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:00,420
You Cook it with lemon,

6488
03:00:00,421 --> 03:00:02,850
like swordfish shark.

6489
03:00:02,950 --> 03:00:03,310
Yeah.

6490
03:00:03,310 --> 03:00:04,080
It's a little tough.

6491
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:06,570
I 100 Florida ft four
pound thresher shark,

6492
03:00:06,840 --> 03:00:07,890
so that's um,

6493
03:00:08,370 --> 03:00:08,581
you know,

6494
03:00:08,581 --> 03:00:10,740
Maaco particularly delicious.

6495
03:00:10,830 --> 03:00:12,460
It really does taste a lot like swordfish,

6496
03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:14,580
but in our lifetime,

6497
03:00:14,581 --> 03:00:19,260
it's now become taboo because people have
this rough idea of what a shark is and

6498
03:00:19,261 --> 03:00:23,790
the sharks are being targeted and sharks
are being murdered and there's a small

6499
03:00:23,791 --> 03:00:24,840
amount of sharks left.

6500
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:28,350
I don't know if that's accurate because
I think this is just in one part of the

6501
03:00:28,351 --> 03:00:29,010
world,

6502
03:00:29,010 --> 03:00:30,450
they're killing off all these sharks.

6503
03:00:30,900 --> 03:00:34,590
It's like if you say that there's
no more grizzly bears left,

6504
03:00:34,591 --> 03:00:34,741
well,

6505
03:00:34,741 --> 03:00:35,970
if you're talking about California,

6506
03:00:35,971 --> 03:00:36,804
you're right.

6507
03:00:37,050 --> 03:00:39,600
But if you're talking
about British Columbia,

6508
03:00:39,780 --> 03:00:40,650
you're wrong.

6509
03:00:40,770 --> 03:00:45,270
There is a fuck load of 'em up there
and they're scary and they're big.

6510
03:00:45,930 --> 03:00:49,350
They're big and they're fast
and they need to eat every day.

6511
03:00:49,530 --> 03:00:50,730
And they berries,

6512
03:00:50,790 --> 03:00:51,930
if they find berries,

6513
03:00:51,931 --> 03:00:54,450
they'll eat some berries or
the eat your asshole too.

6514
03:00:57,680 --> 03:00:58,650
I'd present.

6515
03:00:59,140 --> 03:00:59,501
Would you,

6516
03:00:59,501 --> 03:00:59,980
would you say

6517
03:00:59,980 --> 03:01:00,550
this is it,

6518
03:01:00,550 --> 03:01:01,181
this is happening.

6519
03:01:01,181 --> 03:01:01,421
Is it,

6520
03:01:01,421 --> 03:01:02,340
let's do it right that,

6521
03:01:02,870 --> 03:01:03,703
yeah.

6522
03:01:03,760 --> 03:01:05,890
I was in Alaska once and I was in,

6523
03:01:05,891 --> 03:01:06,724
uh,

6524
03:01:07,150 --> 03:01:07,990
I forget what town,

6525
03:01:07,991 --> 03:01:08,761
but there was a,

6526
03:01:08,761 --> 03:01:10,390
an island called Bair island.

6527
03:01:10,840 --> 03:01:11,770
And I rented this guy,

6528
03:01:11,771 --> 03:01:12,450
had a,

6529
03:01:12,450 --> 03:01:14,230
had a 1948,

6530
03:01:14,231 --> 03:01:19,231
I think it was called us Stenson
or some kind of plane prop plane.

6531
03:01:20,260 --> 03:01:24,100
And I paid him a hundred bucks to take
me over bear island in this fucking

6532
03:01:24,101 --> 03:01:25,120
shitty little plane.

6533
03:01:25,510 --> 03:01:30,200
And we went out there and it took them
like 30 minutes to get the plane started.

6534
03:01:30,210 --> 03:01:31,043
And that was like,

6535
03:01:31,090 --> 03:01:32,560
I should get the fuck outta here.

6536
03:01:32,980 --> 03:01:33,670
And so,

6537
03:01:33,670 --> 03:01:35,690
so we go up and a,

6538
03:01:35,710 --> 03:01:40,710
and the thing is getting
tossed around by wind and uh,

6539
03:01:41,140 --> 03:01:45,490
and we go out and we go over bear island
and he's showing me fucking bear all

6540
03:01:45,491 --> 03:01:45,651
over.

6541
03:01:45,651 --> 03:01:49,210
It was like the highest concentration
of bear and to anywhere in Alaska.

6542
03:01:50,830 --> 03:01:51,940
Jesus Christ.

6543
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:54,350
Those bears are giant too,

6544
03:01:54,351 --> 03:01:54,640
man.

6545
03:01:54,640 --> 03:01:55,060
Yeah.

6546
03:01:55,060 --> 03:01:55,590
Those,

6547
03:01:55,590 --> 03:01:56,650
the coastal bears,

6548
03:01:56,680 --> 03:01:58,000
they're all eating seafood.

6549
03:01:58,001 --> 03:02:01,480
They're eating like fish and
salmon and they just get enormous.

6550
03:02:01,510 --> 03:02:01,960
Yeah,

6551
03:02:01,960 --> 03:02:02,920
there's so big,

6552
03:02:03,550 --> 03:02:06,700
there's so much bigger than bears that
are inland like hundreds of pounds.

6553
03:02:06,720 --> 03:02:08,080
But what are the inland bears eat?

6554
03:02:08,470 --> 03:02:10,840
Wherever the fuck they got
ahold of my elite salmon.

6555
03:02:10,841 --> 03:02:11,651
If they find salmon,

6556
03:02:11,651 --> 03:02:12,640
if there's a salmon river,

6557
03:02:12,641 --> 03:02:13,271
they'll eat fish,

6558
03:02:13,271 --> 03:02:14,680
they'll eat berries,

6559
03:02:15,700 --> 03:02:18,010
he calves eat a lot of calves,

6560
03:02:18,550 --> 03:02:23,110
did a lot of a calf's of
a elk and Moose and deer.

6561
03:02:23,111 --> 03:02:25,600
Fauns the small things
that can't get away.

6562
03:02:25,601 --> 03:02:26,560
They eat everything they can.

6563
03:02:27,100 --> 03:02:27,933
They're so big.

6564
03:02:28,750 --> 03:02:29,583
Yes.

6565
03:02:29,770 --> 03:02:30,270
It's just the,

6566
03:02:30,270 --> 03:02:34,240
to imagine how much food you would
have to eat if you weighed 800 pounds.

6567
03:02:34,840 --> 03:02:36,450
How much food would you
have to eat every day?

6568
03:02:36,470 --> 03:02:36,590
Well,

6569
03:02:36,590 --> 03:02:38,230
four times as much as you eat.

6570
03:02:38,231 --> 03:02:39,490
Now we did that fucking creep.

6571
03:02:39,520 --> 03:02:40,353
Yeah.

6572
03:02:40,780 --> 03:02:43,030
Look at that fucking long nailed creep.

6573
03:02:43,060 --> 03:02:43,871
That's a monster,

6574
03:02:43,871 --> 03:02:44,430
man.

6575
03:02:44,430 --> 03:02:45,000
Yeah.

6576
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:45,160
We,

6577
03:02:45,160 --> 03:02:46,360
but we think it's Yogi.

6578
03:02:46,420 --> 03:02:47,920
Oh look,

6579
03:02:47,921 --> 03:02:48,760
he's so cute.

6580
03:02:48,790 --> 03:02:50,170
He will eat your kid in front of you.

6581
03:02:50,290 --> 03:02:50,890
Yeah.

6582
03:02:50,890 --> 03:02:52,000
And that's what they have to do.

6583
03:02:52,120 --> 03:02:52,361
I mean,

6584
03:02:52,361 --> 03:02:52,631
they're,

6585
03:02:52,631 --> 03:02:53,590
they're predators.

6586
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:54,450
They're out there.

6587
03:02:54,450 --> 03:02:54,680
They're,

6588
03:02:54,680 --> 03:02:55,750
they're omnivores.

6589
03:02:55,840 --> 03:02:56,111
I mean,

6590
03:02:56,111 --> 03:02:59,530
they do occasionally eat
whatever the fuck they want.

6591
03:02:59,531 --> 03:03:00,790
They'll eat roots and berries.

6592
03:03:00,791 --> 03:03:02,230
They'll eat everything else too,

6593
03:03:02,231 --> 03:03:03,520
but they'll definitely you.

6594
03:03:03,570 --> 03:03:03,910
Yeah.

6595
03:03:03,910 --> 03:03:04,630
And love it.

6596
03:03:04,630 --> 03:03:05,200
Yeah.

6597
03:03:05,200 --> 03:03:06,070
Have a good old time.

6598
03:03:07,650 --> 03:03:07,831
Yeah.

6599
03:03:07,831 --> 03:03:09,630
That salmon's a perfect food for them.

6600
03:03:09,631 --> 03:03:10,560
It's all fat.

6601
03:03:10,820 --> 03:03:11,910
You just store it up.

6602
03:03:12,030 --> 03:03:12,690
Yup.

6603
03:03:12,690 --> 03:03:15,930
It's almost like it's designed for
them too because the salmon die.

6604
03:03:16,290 --> 03:03:18,450
They literally die on the river.

6605
03:03:19,080 --> 03:03:20,250
Like you don't even have to catch him.

6606
03:03:20,660 --> 03:03:20,790
Oh,

6607
03:03:20,790 --> 03:03:21,623
I didn't know that.

6608
03:03:22,170 --> 03:03:24,060
Every year when they have to die,

6609
03:03:24,061 --> 03:03:25,890
they go back up to where they were born,

6610
03:03:25,891 --> 03:03:26,190
right?

6611
03:03:26,190 --> 03:03:26,970
Yes.

6612
03:03:26,970 --> 03:03:27,690
Yes.

6613
03:03:27,690 --> 03:03:32,650
They say that once the salmon make the
trek from the ocean to the fresh water,

6614
03:03:32,840 --> 03:03:35,280
they're already on a path to die.

6615
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:37,560
Their clock is already gone over.

6616
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:40,440
It's already flipped
over into no return land.

6617
03:03:40,441 --> 03:03:43,920
You couldn't take them out of there and
bring them to like some salmon pawn.

6618
03:03:43,921 --> 03:03:44,760
They live forever.

6619
03:03:45,150 --> 03:03:45,983
It doesn't work that way.

6620
03:03:46,240 --> 03:03:47,480
There they brew,

6621
03:03:47,530 --> 03:03:48,363
they breed,

6622
03:03:48,570 --> 03:03:49,560
they make the track,

6623
03:03:49,770 --> 03:03:54,210
they breed and when they get to the spot
where you know when there were the end

6624
03:03:54,211 --> 03:03:54,691
of their life,

6625
03:03:54,691 --> 03:03:54,931
their,

6626
03:03:54,931 --> 03:03:56,640
their body starts changing color.

6627
03:03:56,880 --> 03:03:58,100
They getting mushy,

6628
03:03:58,520 --> 03:04:02,630
they live rotten and they just fucking
wind up like pooling up on the ground and

6629
03:04:02,631 --> 03:04:05,780
then the bears move in and they
eat hundreds of rotten ones.

6630
03:04:06,020 --> 03:04:06,800
See this is,

6631
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:10,640
this is while the salmon are
in the run and these bears are,

6632
03:04:10,670 --> 03:04:12,080
they're fighting over territory.

6633
03:04:12,110 --> 03:04:13,530
Look at the size of these motherfuckers.

6634
03:04:13,550 --> 03:04:14,390
Jesus Christ.

6635
03:04:14,391 --> 03:04:14,840
Dude,

6636
03:04:14,840 --> 03:04:16,400
they're fighting over who gets to salmon.

6637
03:04:16,520 --> 03:04:16,940
Yeah,

6638
03:04:16,940 --> 03:04:19,340
but these are salmon that are
still pretty fresh and healthy.

6639
03:04:19,640 --> 03:04:20,030
They're,

6640
03:04:20,030 --> 03:04:20,760
they're swimming around,

6641
03:04:20,760 --> 03:04:21,593
they look good.

6642
03:04:21,830 --> 03:04:25,370
And so they catch them like that was a
perfectly healthy salmon and he catches

6643
03:04:25,371 --> 03:04:29,780
it right in the middle of it or
tried Huggies all slow mo and shit.

6644
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:30,650
Here he goes.

6645
03:04:30,650 --> 03:04:32,120
They try and they catch some of them.

6646
03:04:33,830 --> 03:04:35,060
Oh come on bitch.

6647
03:04:35,960 --> 03:04:36,793
Hey,

6648
03:04:37,630 --> 03:04:38,463
get that.

6649
03:04:38,500 --> 03:04:42,640
Imagine just standing in freezing cold
water waiting to catch something with

6650
03:04:42,641 --> 03:04:43,474
your mouth.

6651
03:04:43,630 --> 03:04:45,160
It's delicious.

6652
03:04:45,310 --> 03:04:45,521
Right.

6653
03:04:45,521 --> 03:04:46,900
But they figured it out and it works.

6654
03:04:46,930 --> 03:04:47,260
Yep.

6655
03:04:47,260 --> 03:04:47,940
Look at the cubs.

6656
03:04:47,940 --> 03:04:49,480
Like come on mom to fuck.

6657
03:04:50,170 --> 03:04:52,390
So mom's probably going
to give him some of that.

6658
03:04:52,990 --> 03:04:53,321
Yeah,

6659
03:04:53,321 --> 03:04:57,070
see she breaks off pieces of it and so
they just keep doing that back and forth

6660
03:04:57,100 --> 03:04:58,180
and they'll do that all day.

6661
03:04:58,390 --> 03:05:01,600
But then once the salmon
are done with their run,

6662
03:05:01,601 --> 03:05:02,710
then they just die.

6663
03:05:02,920 --> 03:05:07,510
And coincidentally when they're dying
is probably right when the bears are

6664
03:05:07,511 --> 03:05:09,950
trying to fatten up and
get ready for hibernation.

6665
03:05:09,960 --> 03:05:10,270
Yeah.

6666
03:05:10,270 --> 03:05:14,810
So it all like sort of happens together
and they're all in the right place at

6667
03:05:14,811 --> 03:05:15,620
the right time.

6668
03:05:15,620 --> 03:05:16,300
Right.

6669
03:05:16,300 --> 03:05:19,150
See if you can find bears
eating rotten salmon.

6670
03:05:19,480 --> 03:05:23,380
Cause like sometimes they'll pull up
and these these rivers and these like

6671
03:05:23,410 --> 03:05:28,410
little ponds and shit and you just see
all these bears is chew on these rotten

6672
03:05:28,511 --> 03:05:29,210
carcasses.

6673
03:05:29,210 --> 03:05:30,043
Yeah.

6674
03:05:30,110 --> 03:05:30,351
Yeah.

6675
03:05:30,351 --> 03:05:33,860
Those salmon are endangered
now we eat so much more fish.

6676
03:05:33,970 --> 03:05:34,940
I remember when I was a kid,

6677
03:05:34,941 --> 03:05:37,220
I'd have fish once every three weeks.

6678
03:05:37,610 --> 03:05:38,040
Now you,

6679
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:39,290
I mean maybe it's because we're in la,

6680
03:05:39,291 --> 03:05:41,330
but I have fish a few times a week.

6681
03:05:41,360 --> 03:05:43,010
Do you have some fucking Sushi?

6682
03:05:43,011 --> 03:05:46,460
One day wife will cook
some salmon on another day.

6683
03:05:46,980 --> 03:05:48,710
Go get one of those pokie bowls.

6684
03:05:49,690 --> 03:05:51,070
We're constantly eating salmon.

6685
03:05:51,370 --> 03:05:52,360
It's a lot of food.

6686
03:05:52,580 --> 03:05:55,390
Think about all those little
organisms that have to fuck.

6687
03:05:55,600 --> 03:05:56,291
Well not really.

6688
03:05:56,291 --> 03:05:57,370
Shoot loads on eggs.

6689
03:05:57,400 --> 03:05:57,700
Yeah.

6690
03:05:57,700 --> 03:06:02,050
Make new organisms and then all the
people with nets scooping them up.

6691
03:06:02,140 --> 03:06:02,710
Do you see us?

6692
03:06:02,710 --> 03:06:06,310
A tuna got sold in Japan
for the highest amount ever.

6693
03:06:06,670 --> 03:06:08,590
$3 million for tuna.

6694
03:06:08,980 --> 03:06:09,850
Shit.

6695
03:06:10,600 --> 03:06:11,800
I had no idea.

6696
03:06:12,050 --> 03:06:12,940
Did you have any idea?

6697
03:06:12,970 --> 03:06:14,170
But a tuna can be 3 million.

6698
03:06:14,171 --> 03:06:14,480
Yeah,

6699
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:19,250
I know that they wait on the dock and
the in Japan and whoever is like certain

6700
03:06:19,251 --> 03:06:22,870
chefs have more cache and they're
able to come in first and pick the,

6701
03:06:23,030 --> 03:06:23,863
the tuna,

6702
03:06:23,870 --> 03:06:24,703
but then they,

6703
03:06:24,770 --> 03:06:26,330
but then they auction them off and yeah,

6704
03:06:26,331 --> 03:06:27,740
they go for crazy money.

6705
03:06:28,080 --> 03:06:28,913
That's so crazy.

6706
03:06:29,580 --> 03:06:31,500
That's a giant fucking fish though.

6707
03:06:31,501 --> 03:06:33,030
Isn't it like 600 pounds or something?

6708
03:06:33,031 --> 03:06:33,511
How much does it cost?

6709
03:06:33,511 --> 03:06:33,930
Yeah.

6710
03:06:33,930 --> 03:06:36,150
Least 278 kilograms.

6711
03:06:36,180 --> 03:06:39,450
What's that in English
two point to close to six.

6712
03:06:39,750 --> 03:06:40,320
Yeah.

6713
03:06:40,320 --> 03:06:41,153
Look at that thing.

6714
03:06:41,160 --> 03:06:41,993
God Damn.

6715
03:06:42,210 --> 03:06:42,751
That's a hard,

6716
03:06:42,751 --> 03:06:43,590
that is to bring in.

6717
03:06:44,280 --> 03:06:45,113
Yeah.

6718
03:06:45,480 --> 03:06:46,860
I caught a yellow tail and Hawaii.

6719
03:06:46,861 --> 03:06:48,240
That was like 11 pounds.

6720
03:06:48,680 --> 03:06:49,513
How battle?

6721
03:06:49,830 --> 03:06:50,730
What a battle?

6722
03:06:51,090 --> 03:06:51,540
Yeah.

6723
03:06:51,540 --> 03:06:52,890
613 pounds.

6724
03:06:52,950 --> 03:06:53,783
Wow.

6725
03:06:54,750 --> 03:06:54,871
Yeah.

6726
03:06:54,871 --> 03:06:56,010
We up quite a few of them.

6727
03:06:56,270 --> 03:06:57,001
You know what's interesting?

6728
03:06:57,001 --> 03:06:57,990
They're catching ones.

6729
03:06:58,080 --> 03:07:03,080
They're calling Hamachi cause they were
actually from a Hamachi farm that was on

6730
03:07:03,241 --> 03:07:06,630
the big island that broke during
the storm and weather that storm.

6731
03:07:06,631 --> 03:07:07,650
There are a couple of years back.

6732
03:07:07,740 --> 03:07:09,030
Giant fucking hurricane.

6733
03:07:09,031 --> 03:07:09,864
They did a why?

6734
03:07:10,050 --> 03:07:11,760
Well it destroyed this uh,

6735
03:07:11,810 --> 03:07:15,600
this containment area that they had
where they were farm raising Hamachi for

6736
03:07:15,601 --> 03:07:16,620
like Sushi and shit.

6737
03:07:16,950 --> 03:07:20,440
So now this type of yellow
tails everywhere in the,

6738
03:07:20,441 --> 03:07:21,120
in the ocean.

6739
03:07:21,120 --> 03:07:21,750
Oh Wow.

6740
03:07:21,750 --> 03:07:22,200
Yeah.

6741
03:07:22,200 --> 03:07:23,050
We caught a quite,

6742
03:07:23,100 --> 03:07:23,820
quite a few of them.

6743
03:07:23,820 --> 03:07:24,450
Did you eat them?

6744
03:07:24,450 --> 03:07:24,631
Yeah,

6745
03:07:24,631 --> 03:07:25,464
they're great.

6746
03:07:25,590 --> 03:07:26,670
So you caught it there,

6747
03:07:26,671 --> 03:07:29,580
you brought it back to the hotel
and then they fry cook it for you.

6748
03:07:29,581 --> 03:07:30,330
Yeah,

6749
03:07:30,330 --> 03:07:30,870
yeah.

6750
03:07:30,870 --> 03:07:31,710
Oh it's amazing.

6751
03:07:31,830 --> 03:07:32,371
So good.

6752
03:07:32,371 --> 03:07:33,450
They made Sushi for us.

6753
03:07:33,451 --> 03:07:34,290
They made 'em.

6754
03:07:34,440 --> 03:07:35,910
They made a sashimi.

6755
03:07:35,911 --> 03:07:36,900
They made Sovich a,

6756
03:07:36,901 --> 03:07:38,160
they baked it.

6757
03:07:38,610 --> 03:07:40,080
They cooked it a couple of different ways,

6758
03:07:40,320 --> 03:07:41,153
but you know,

6759
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:42,870
they're so powerful.

6760
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:46,590
A 10 pound one nine pound
one or is so powerful.

6761
03:07:46,610 --> 03:07:48,260
You can't believe how strong they are.

6762
03:07:48,660 --> 03:07:48,991
Like you're,

6763
03:07:48,991 --> 03:07:50,070
you're wrestling with them.

6764
03:07:50,071 --> 03:07:51,290
We can try and get them into the bullying.

6765
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:58,160
So imagine that thing
600 pounds and Holy Shit.

6766
03:07:58,501 --> 03:07:59,990
That's like the whole family fishing.

6767
03:07:59,991 --> 03:08:00,421
You just,

6768
03:08:00,421 --> 03:08:01,050
my youngest,

6769
03:08:01,050 --> 03:08:02,940
youngest daughter loves
it and she loves it.

6770
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:03,451
Loves it.

6771
03:08:03,451 --> 03:08:04,284
She loves fishing.

6772
03:08:04,630 --> 03:08:05,370
Yeah.

6773
03:08:05,370 --> 03:08:06,300
We put a video up,

6774
03:08:06,320 --> 03:08:06,570
uh,

6775
03:08:06,570 --> 03:08:06,931
of,

6776
03:08:06,931 --> 03:08:07,500
um,

6777
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:09,120
the dolphins that were with us.

6778
03:08:09,210 --> 03:08:09,870
I saw that.

6779
03:08:09,870 --> 03:08:10,310
It's crazy.

6780
03:08:10,310 --> 03:08:11,070
It was amazing.

6781
03:08:11,070 --> 03:08:13,730
They just never seen that many
dolphins swim with a boat either.

6782
03:08:14,620 --> 03:08:15,453
It was incredible.

6783
03:08:15,480 --> 03:08:16,313
They just all,

6784
03:08:16,350 --> 03:08:17,700
we just hit the right spot.

6785
03:08:17,730 --> 03:08:18,060
Yeah.

6786
03:08:18,060 --> 03:08:20,340
And then they all decided
to swim with the boat.

6787
03:08:20,341 --> 03:08:21,174
They just get in,

6788
03:08:21,230 --> 03:08:24,390
in front of the boat as the boat's
pushing the water and they started a surf.

6789
03:08:24,391 --> 03:08:25,140
It,

6790
03:08:25,140 --> 03:08:26,040
that's amazing.

6791
03:08:26,070 --> 03:08:26,821
So crazy.

6792
03:08:26,821 --> 03:08:28,050
You worry about you're going to hit him.

6793
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:28,860
You worry that they're going to,

6794
03:08:28,860 --> 03:08:30,450
but the right people running the boat,

6795
03:08:30,451 --> 03:08:31,051
they don't worry about it.

6796
03:08:31,051 --> 03:08:32,670
All the dolphins know
exactly what they're doing.

6797
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:34,200
They're smart as shit.

6798
03:08:34,230 --> 03:08:34,860
Yeah.

6799
03:08:34,860 --> 03:08:35,850
It's weird to watch,

6800
03:08:35,851 --> 03:08:36,330
man.

6801
03:08:36,330 --> 03:08:38,730
It's weird to watch them all coordinate
together and then they were done.

6802
03:08:38,731 --> 03:08:39,850
They were done like by,

6803
03:08:40,680 --> 03:08:41,340
they take off.

6804
03:08:41,340 --> 03:08:42,060
Wow.

6805
03:08:42,060 --> 03:08:42,241
Yeah.

6806
03:08:42,241 --> 03:08:43,770
My daughter's surfs and they come out,

6807
03:08:43,800 --> 03:08:45,000
they play around a little bit.

6808
03:08:45,270 --> 03:08:47,220
Sometimes they ride the
waves when she surfing.

6809
03:08:47,670 --> 03:08:49,530
That's one of the dark sides of fishing,

6810
03:08:49,531 --> 03:08:50,364
right?

6811
03:08:50,490 --> 03:08:55,110
Commercial fishing is what happens in
Japan when they take those dolphins and

6812
03:08:55,111 --> 03:08:57,120
they look at them as competition,

6813
03:08:57,660 --> 03:08:59,160
they're going to kill their tuna so they,

6814
03:08:59,450 --> 03:09:00,030
you know,

6815
03:09:00,030 --> 03:09:01,170
they've been doing that forever.

6816
03:09:01,171 --> 03:09:03,840
The large scale slaughter of them,

6817
03:09:03,990 --> 03:09:05,040
it's scary shit.

6818
03:09:05,460 --> 03:09:06,293
They just shoot him.

6819
03:09:06,480 --> 03:09:07,290
They'd cut them,

6820
03:09:07,290 --> 03:09:07,710
they bring up.

6821
03:09:07,710 --> 03:09:08,790
You've ever seen the documentary,

6822
03:09:08,791 --> 03:09:09,624
the cove?

6823
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:10,351
Oh,

6824
03:09:10,351 --> 03:09:11,480
now I heard about that.

6825
03:09:11,790 --> 03:09:13,030
All full.

6826
03:09:13,370 --> 03:09:15,260
All full there.

6827
03:09:15,310 --> 03:09:15,720
It's,

6828
03:09:15,720 --> 03:09:19,170
it's like they're
slaughtering water people.

6829
03:09:20,100 --> 03:09:20,790
That's what it's like.

6830
03:09:20,790 --> 03:09:21,623
Yeah.

6831
03:09:21,730 --> 03:09:23,400
There's what a dolphin is,

6832
03:09:23,460 --> 03:09:24,990
is some strange,

6833
03:09:24,991 --> 03:09:29,490
super intelligent creature that we don't
totally understand and they can talk,

6834
03:09:29,730 --> 03:09:31,740
they can talk to each other and
we don't know what they're saying,

6835
03:09:31,890 --> 03:09:32,910
but they know what they're saying.

6836
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:35,790
And we could train them.

6837
03:09:35,820 --> 03:09:36,690
You could ride them,

6838
03:09:36,720 --> 03:09:37,491
you can do it,

6839
03:09:37,491 --> 03:09:38,730
flips for fish,

6840
03:09:38,760 --> 03:09:39,510
all this kind of stuff.

6841
03:09:39,510 --> 03:09:40,380
That's all true.

6842
03:09:40,410 --> 03:09:41,243
That's all true.

6843
03:09:41,370 --> 03:09:43,710
But what's also true is
they have a giant brain,

6844
03:09:43,950 --> 03:09:45,450
and if they have a huge brain,

6845
03:09:45,590 --> 03:09:45,801
Devin,

6846
03:09:45,801 --> 03:09:48,030
cerebral cortex is 40%
larger than a person.

6847
03:09:48,600 --> 03:09:49,370
No Shit.

6848
03:09:49,370 --> 03:09:49,800
Yeah.

6849
03:09:49,800 --> 03:09:50,550
Wow.

6850
03:09:50,550 --> 03:09:50,970
They just,

6851
03:09:50,970 --> 03:09:52,950
it's designed for you,

6852
03:09:53,080 --> 03:09:53,281
the,

6853
03:09:53,281 --> 03:09:54,250
the movement of his body.

6854
03:09:54,251 --> 03:09:54,850
Cause it's a lot,

6855
03:09:54,850 --> 03:09:55,420
lot,

6856
03:09:55,420 --> 03:09:56,560
lot larger body,

6857
03:09:57,250 --> 03:10:02,250
but they think it's also got some sort
of probably not totally understood are

6858
03:10:03,401 --> 03:10:04,720
measured cognitive ability.

6859
03:10:05,260 --> 03:10:06,940
They don't know like how
smart they really are.

6860
03:10:06,970 --> 03:10:07,803
It's been,

6861
03:10:07,960 --> 03:10:08,261
you know,

6862
03:10:08,261 --> 03:10:09,430
when we're talking about Timothy Leary,

6863
03:10:09,431 --> 03:10:11,200
he used to pal around with John Lilly.

6864
03:10:11,380 --> 03:10:15,460
John Lilly's the guy who invented
the isolation tank and he's also a,

6865
03:10:15,461 --> 03:10:17,740
he was a pioneer and
interspecies communication.

6866
03:10:17,770 --> 03:10:20,570
You'd give dolphins acid and he would uh,

6867
03:10:21,460 --> 03:10:25,630
he was set the float tank up next to the
dolphin tank and take acid and get in

6868
03:10:25,631 --> 03:10:26,464
there with them.

6869
03:10:26,830 --> 03:10:27,131
Yeah,

6870
03:10:27,131 --> 03:10:27,730
he was,

6871
03:10:27,730 --> 03:10:27,881
yeah.

6872
03:10:27,881 --> 03:10:30,940
He was trying to figure out a
way to get dolphins to speak.

6873
03:10:31,210 --> 03:10:32,770
He would get them to like make a noise.

6874
03:10:32,771 --> 03:10:35,440
It sounds like [inaudible] you know,

6875
03:10:35,441 --> 03:10:35,951
but they could,

6876
03:10:35,951 --> 03:10:37,810
they don't have the vocal cords.

6877
03:10:37,860 --> 03:10:40,300
They can't make the sounds that we expect,

6878
03:10:40,900 --> 03:10:42,670
but there sounds we don't understand.

6879
03:10:42,700 --> 03:10:43,060
Right.

6880
03:10:43,060 --> 03:10:44,770
Which is weird cause they
know what you're saying.

6881
03:10:44,800 --> 03:10:45,161
If you say,

6882
03:10:45,161 --> 03:10:45,551
okay,

6883
03:10:45,551 --> 03:10:46,390
we're going to jump now,

6884
03:10:46,391 --> 03:10:46,920
we're going to jump,

6885
03:10:46,920 --> 03:10:47,860
we're going to give you a fish.

6886
03:10:48,070 --> 03:10:48,640
They know it.

6887
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:49,473
They know what you're saying.

6888
03:10:49,660 --> 03:10:50,680
We have no idea what they're saying.

6889
03:10:52,900 --> 03:10:53,171
Yeah.

6890
03:10:53,171 --> 03:10:53,741
It's weird when you,

6891
03:10:53,741 --> 03:10:53,981
what?

6892
03:10:53,981 --> 03:10:56,830
What is the cutoff for
killing an intelligent animal?

6893
03:10:56,860 --> 03:10:57,041
Right.

6894
03:10:57,041 --> 03:10:57,251
You know,

6895
03:10:57,251 --> 03:10:59,140
like you can't kill dogs cat.

6896
03:10:59,160 --> 03:10:59,993
It's,

6897
03:11:00,660 --> 03:11:02,430
dogs aren't nearly as smart as dolphins,

6898
03:11:02,460 --> 03:11:03,120
right?

6899
03:11:03,120 --> 03:11:03,953
Yeah.

6900
03:11:03,960 --> 03:11:05,820
But you can kill dogs in some spots.

6901
03:11:05,821 --> 03:11:06,654
It's cultural.

6902
03:11:06,750 --> 03:11:07,290
Yeah.

6903
03:11:07,290 --> 03:11:09,180
Because pigs are probably
the smartest dogs.

6904
03:11:09,660 --> 03:11:09,901
Oh yeah.

6905
03:11:09,901 --> 03:11:10,411
We all exist.

6906
03:11:10,411 --> 03:11:11,244
Really smart.

6907
03:11:11,800 --> 03:11:12,001
I mean,

6908
03:11:12,001 --> 03:11:12,834
that's a,

6909
03:11:13,590 --> 03:11:14,423
that's a tricky one.

6910
03:11:14,970 --> 03:11:15,803
All those,

6911
03:11:15,810 --> 03:11:16,643
you know,

6912
03:11:17,940 --> 03:11:20,400
that is one of our criteria.

6913
03:11:20,490 --> 03:11:22,680
Like even a lot of vegetarians,

6914
03:11:22,920 --> 03:11:24,480
we'll still step on roaches.

6915
03:11:25,020 --> 03:11:25,740
Yeah.

6916
03:11:25,740 --> 03:11:26,280
You know,

6917
03:11:26,280 --> 03:11:30,030
our criteria is how smart is the thing.

6918
03:11:30,510 --> 03:11:31,830
How close is it to us?

6919
03:11:31,920 --> 03:11:33,090
The further it's away from us,

6920
03:11:33,091 --> 03:11:34,080
the easy we could just like,

6921
03:11:34,440 --> 03:11:35,850
nobody gives a fuck about oysters.

6922
03:11:36,740 --> 03:11:37,050
Yeah.

6923
03:11:37,050 --> 03:11:37,490
You know,

6924
03:11:37,490 --> 03:11:37,790
sad.

6925
03:11:37,790 --> 03:11:38,970
Saben an oyster gets got.

6926
03:11:39,470 --> 03:11:40,290
I don't care.

6927
03:11:40,290 --> 03:11:41,041
I don't care at all.

6928
03:11:41,041 --> 03:11:41,910
I don't feel a thing.

6929
03:11:42,130 --> 03:11:45,000
And someone's shucks annoy Sir and
opens up and scooped it out and swallow.

6930
03:11:45,001 --> 03:11:45,271
And I'm like,

6931
03:11:45,271 --> 03:11:45,631
how's it?

6932
03:11:45,631 --> 03:11:46,464
Good.

6933
03:11:46,680 --> 03:11:47,030
Yeah.

6934
03:11:47,030 --> 03:11:47,231
I don't know.

6935
03:11:47,231 --> 03:11:47,430
Like,

6936
03:11:47,430 --> 03:11:47,940
Aww,

6937
03:11:47,940 --> 03:11:48,773
poor little piggy,

6938
03:11:49,170 --> 03:11:50,190
but the poor little piggy.

6939
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:51,470
That's real.

6940
03:11:51,470 --> 03:11:52,061
It's a that thing.

6941
03:11:52,061 --> 03:11:52,710
Smart.

6942
03:11:52,710 --> 03:11:53,190
Oh,

6943
03:11:53,190 --> 03:11:54,300
let's say so scared.

6944
03:11:54,301 --> 03:11:55,134
So terrified.

6945
03:11:55,410 --> 03:11:56,243
Yeah.

6946
03:11:56,680 --> 03:11:57,570
Balance things are dumb.

6947
03:11:57,670 --> 03:11:59,530
What about lobsters
getting thrown in the pot?

6948
03:11:59,531 --> 03:12:00,340
Can you do that?

6949
03:12:00,340 --> 03:12:01,240
I can't do that.

6950
03:12:01,630 --> 03:12:02,021
Oh yeah,

6951
03:12:02,021 --> 03:12:02,351
I could do.

6952
03:12:02,351 --> 03:12:04,180
It freaks me out.

6953
03:12:04,210 --> 03:12:04,451
Really?

6954
03:12:04,451 --> 03:12:08,530
That they're like moving around and alive
and then you throw them in and don't

6955
03:12:08,531 --> 03:12:09,364
they scream

6956
03:12:09,380 --> 03:12:10,070
they're bugs.

6957
03:12:10,070 --> 03:12:10,221
Yeah.

6958
03:12:10,221 --> 03:12:10,670
They scream.

6959
03:12:10,670 --> 03:12:11,600
They sing first.

6960
03:12:12,910 --> 03:12:13,190
Oh,

6961
03:12:13,190 --> 03:12:14,023
scream.

6962
03:12:14,170 --> 03:12:15,003
No.

6963
03:12:16,140 --> 03:12:17,720
It's not like the frog in Carnegie Hall.

6964
03:12:17,721 --> 03:12:18,790
I don't think they could make noise.

6965
03:12:19,260 --> 03:12:20,110
They make noise.

6966
03:12:20,500 --> 03:12:21,340
Their lobsters.

6967
03:12:21,670 --> 03:12:22,503
Ah,

6968
03:12:22,690 --> 03:12:22,901
yeah.

6969
03:12:22,901 --> 03:12:23,970
But they taste fuck.

6970
03:12:24,460 --> 03:12:25,660
I'll eat tons of them.

6971
03:12:26,130 --> 03:12:27,940
When I used to work in Boston at the,

6972
03:12:27,941 --> 03:12:28,774
uh,

6973
03:12:29,110 --> 03:12:30,060
the copy Marriott,

6974
03:12:30,070 --> 03:12:32,170
that was my day job
for a while in college.

6975
03:12:32,200 --> 03:12:33,790
And then when I first
started doing standup,

6976
03:12:34,630 --> 03:12:38,350
and we used to go down and it was
the biggest banquet hall in Boston.

6977
03:12:38,351 --> 03:12:39,700
So we used to get all these conventions,

6978
03:12:39,701 --> 03:12:43,810
all these fucking hayseed farmers would
come from the Midwest and they'd stay in

6979
03:12:43,811 --> 03:12:45,970
the hotel and they could
order any kind of dinner.

6980
03:12:45,971 --> 03:12:47,170
They want it for their banquet,

6981
03:12:47,410 --> 03:12:49,090
but they always wanted the pilgrim,

6982
03:12:49,360 --> 03:12:51,980
the pilgrim banquet and
used to have to fucking

6983
03:12:51,980 --> 03:12:55,550
dress up as pilgrims
who would serve lobster.

6984
03:12:55,551 --> 03:12:56,720
It didn't even make any sense.

6985
03:12:57,160 --> 03:12:57,730
Different things.

6986
03:12:57,730 --> 03:12:59,180
So so they would make,

6987
03:12:59,181 --> 03:13:04,181
and the thing about banquet cooking is
you cook 10% more than the amount of

6988
03:13:04,371 --> 03:13:06,260
people you're feeding just in case,

6989
03:13:06,620 --> 03:13:08,720
which meant there was like you know,

6990
03:13:08,721 --> 03:13:13,370
30 30 college kids all
waiting tables and a,

6991
03:13:13,371 --> 03:13:18,050
and so after we fed them
they would usually have like
a presentation or whatever

6992
03:13:18,051 --> 03:13:19,370
comedian or a speaker.

6993
03:13:19,550 --> 03:13:23,030
So we would leave the room for like an
hour and a half and we would just fucking

6994
03:13:23,031 --> 03:13:28,031
go to town on like a hundred lobsters
could eat like three lobsters if you

6995
03:13:28,750 --> 03:13:29,300
wanted.

6996
03:13:29,300 --> 03:13:30,051
And then our friends,

6997
03:13:30,051 --> 03:13:31,090
we're all working the bars.

6998
03:13:31,100 --> 03:13:33,890
They were all the bartenders
so we'd be doing shots,

6999
03:13:34,670 --> 03:13:38,300
drinking beer and so is the
upside was you live like a king.

7000
03:13:38,301 --> 03:13:41,240
The downside was you were
dressed like a fucking asshole.

7001
03:13:45,710 --> 03:13:46,940
I remember clam bakes.

7002
03:13:46,941 --> 03:13:48,050
People would do them on the ball.

7003
03:13:48,051 --> 03:13:48,500
Yeah,

7004
03:13:48,500 --> 03:13:49,700
those were good.

7005
03:13:49,701 --> 03:13:50,320
Yeah.

7006
03:13:50,320 --> 03:13:53,830
I like a clam bake where you would burry
it and put seaweed over the top and

7007
03:13:53,840 --> 03:13:54,673
shit.

7008
03:13:54,710 --> 03:13:56,990
Wet Seaweed and it would
just steam everything.

7009
03:13:57,210 --> 03:13:58,230
I've never done it.

7010
03:13:58,590 --> 03:14:00,630
I've only eaten it at a restaurant.

7011
03:14:00,631 --> 03:14:01,700
When you order a clam bake.

7012
03:14:01,730 --> 03:14:01,960
Yeah.

7013
03:14:01,960 --> 03:14:02,701
And they give you some,

7014
03:14:02,701 --> 03:14:03,930
I've never done the beach thing.

7015
03:14:03,960 --> 03:14:05,790
I did it with Kevin Flynn and Nantucket.

7016
03:14:05,791 --> 03:14:06,210
Goddamn,

7017
03:14:06,210 --> 03:14:06,960
it looks attractive.

7018
03:14:06,960 --> 03:14:07,470
Yeah,

7019
03:14:07,470 --> 03:14:08,020
that's very true.

7020
03:14:08,020 --> 03:14:08,740
Great.

7021
03:14:08,740 --> 03:14:09,391
Very earthy.

7022
03:14:09,391 --> 03:14:10,890
Right at the fucking corn in there.

7023
03:14:10,891 --> 03:14:11,341
Everything.

7024
03:14:11,341 --> 03:14:14,550
Potatoes to something about
a bonfire on the beach.

7025
03:14:14,850 --> 03:14:15,450
Right?

7026
03:14:15,450 --> 03:14:16,530
It's like extra special.

7027
03:14:16,531 --> 03:14:17,180
Yeah.

7028
03:14:17,180 --> 03:14:18,480
Like here it is.

7029
03:14:18,630 --> 03:14:19,560
That's it right there.

7030
03:14:19,860 --> 03:14:21,270
How to make a steam pit.

7031
03:14:22,890 --> 03:14:24,710
Make a nice fucking steam pit.

7032
03:14:24,720 --> 03:14:25,141
Look at that.

7033
03:14:25,141 --> 03:14:26,280
We've got the lobsters,

7034
03:14:26,310 --> 03:14:28,210
we got con con,

7035
03:14:28,320 --> 03:14:29,850
we got clams.

7036
03:14:30,300 --> 03:14:30,631
Yeah.

7037
03:14:30,631 --> 03:14:33,540
It would be lobsters and corn and clams,

7038
03:14:33,900 --> 03:14:34,733
potatoes,

7039
03:14:34,830 --> 03:14:39,830
potatoes and it would all be buried in
like a burlap sack under the ground.

7040
03:14:39,970 --> 03:14:40,803
Yup.

7041
03:14:41,010 --> 03:14:42,060
Muscles too.

7042
03:14:42,210 --> 03:14:43,050
God Damn it.

7043
03:14:43,051 --> 03:14:43,950
That looks good.

7044
03:14:44,550 --> 03:14:45,930
Ah.

7045
03:14:45,990 --> 03:14:47,310
People say they don't like lobster.

7046
03:14:47,311 --> 03:14:48,810
I just do not understand that.

7047
03:14:48,960 --> 03:14:49,230
You don't,

7048
03:14:49,230 --> 03:14:50,063
it's like lobster.

7049
03:14:50,130 --> 03:14:52,860
Eddie Bravo won't eat fish hate fish.

7050
03:14:52,970 --> 03:14:53,520
Big Fan.

7051
03:14:53,520 --> 03:14:54,750
You son of a bitch.

7052
03:14:55,500 --> 03:14:57,180
So lobster and crab.

7053
03:14:57,181 --> 03:14:58,500
Nice Alaskan crab.

7054
03:14:59,160 --> 03:15:00,030
Look at that with the little,

7055
03:15:00,031 --> 03:15:00,930
with the green stuff.

7056
03:15:00,960 --> 03:15:02,490
What does that minced onions or something,

7057
03:15:02,491 --> 03:15:04,050
what does that like crawl crow?

7058
03:15:04,051 --> 03:15:04,920
I think what's,

7059
03:15:04,921 --> 03:15:05,161
no,

7060
03:15:05,161 --> 03:15:06,330
what's the stuff on the,

7061
03:15:06,570 --> 03:15:07,403
no,

7062
03:15:07,500 --> 03:15:08,011
that's not,

7063
03:15:08,011 --> 03:15:08,431
that is,

7064
03:15:08,431 --> 03:15:09,181
that's like a spice,

7065
03:15:09,181 --> 03:15:10,014
right?

7066
03:15:11,160 --> 03:15:12,320
Cause it's on the corn today.

7067
03:15:12,410 --> 03:15:13,080
Yeah.

7068
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:14,160
I think that's like a,

7069
03:15:14,500 --> 03:15:15,030
what is that?

7070
03:15:15,030 --> 03:15:16,270
Like a salary or something like that.

7071
03:15:16,290 --> 03:15:16,860
Parsley,

7072
03:15:16,860 --> 03:15:18,050
chopped parsley or some shit.

7073
03:15:18,600 --> 03:15:20,550
Just make it real and
then the exit of the rail,

7074
03:15:20,551 --> 03:15:21,480
that's at the time.

7075
03:15:21,780 --> 03:15:22,830
That shit's nasty.

7076
03:15:22,950 --> 03:15:23,700
I like it.

7077
03:15:23,700 --> 03:15:25,230
You eat the rallied everything.

7078
03:15:25,530 --> 03:15:26,363
No Shit.

7079
03:15:26,400 --> 03:15:30,810
I chew the inner Cartlidge up
and I suck the meat out of it.

7080
03:15:31,980 --> 03:15:33,360
I feel like if that thing is going to die,

7081
03:15:33,361 --> 03:15:34,830
I'm going to eat as much of it as I can.

7082
03:15:34,890 --> 03:15:36,450
I bite into the,

7083
03:15:36,810 --> 03:15:40,620
you know how you take the back and is
that meat underneath with all the crazy

7084
03:15:40,621 --> 03:15:41,640
gills and all that shit.

7085
03:15:41,641 --> 03:15:43,080
I just chew into that stuff.

7086
03:15:44,020 --> 03:15:44,440
Yeah.

7087
03:15:44,440 --> 03:15:45,260
Chew it up,

7088
03:15:45,260 --> 03:15:45,781
chew it up.

7089
03:15:45,781 --> 03:15:46,830
Good junk.

7090
03:15:46,831 --> 03:15:48,180
All that shit and butter.

7091
03:15:48,990 --> 03:15:49,890
That's what I'm talking about.

7092
03:15:50,990 --> 03:15:52,980
And I did throw move on
one of those waitresses.

7093
03:15:52,981 --> 03:15:54,000
I'm dressed as a pilgrim.

7094
03:15:54,390 --> 03:15:58,050
I'm drunk and on some
girl from Boston College.

7095
03:15:58,260 --> 03:16:00,840
Did you know that lobsters were
like poor people food in New York?

7096
03:16:01,020 --> 03:16:03,060
They would just go out to the East
River and pull them out of the water.

7097
03:16:03,061 --> 03:16:03,450
Yeah.

7098
03:16:03,450 --> 03:16:05,370
Serve him his bar food for people.

7099
03:16:05,371 --> 03:16:05,940
Food.

7100
03:16:05,940 --> 03:16:07,710
Do you know an Ireland during the famine?

7101
03:16:07,740 --> 03:16:10,470
They were pulling fucking lobster
out of the ocean would need it.

7102
03:16:10,650 --> 03:16:12,120
They considered it like rats.

7103
03:16:12,180 --> 03:16:12,900
Oh my God.

7104
03:16:12,900 --> 03:16:13,410
They sit.

7105
03:16:13,410 --> 03:16:14,161
They fucking need.

7106
03:16:14,161 --> 03:16:16,200
The British would just ship it off.

7107
03:16:16,260 --> 03:16:17,100
That's so crazy.

7108
03:16:17,101 --> 03:16:17,281
Yeah.

7109
03:16:17,281 --> 03:16:18,240
I did not figure it out.

7110
03:16:19,320 --> 03:16:20,153
They're drunk.

7111
03:16:20,250 --> 03:16:21,660
One person just boiled it up,

7112
03:16:21,690 --> 03:16:22,261
made some butter.

7113
03:16:22,261 --> 03:16:23,700
Just shut the fuck up and try this.

7114
03:16:24,030 --> 03:16:24,863
They'd be like,

7115
03:16:25,260 --> 03:16:26,093
what

7116
03:16:26,400 --> 03:16:27,001
I've been avoiding?

7117
03:16:27,001 --> 03:16:27,834
Yes.

7118
03:16:27,870 --> 03:16:28,920
What does I've been thinking,

7119
03:16:28,950 --> 03:16:30,210
what the fuck have I been doing?

7120
03:16:30,211 --> 03:16:30,590
A lot.

7121
03:16:30,590 --> 03:16:31,990
The whole family is starving.

7122
03:16:31,991 --> 03:16:32,621
It's got dumped.

7123
03:16:32,621 --> 03:16:33,121
Delicious.

7124
03:16:33,121 --> 03:16:34,200
We've been eating potatoes.

7125
03:16:34,480 --> 03:16:35,230
We have been Indian.

7126
03:16:35,230 --> 03:16:36,240
This fucking lobster.

7127
03:16:36,810 --> 03:16:39,240
What we mean is fucking lucky charms.

7128
03:16:39,940 --> 03:16:40,530
Ah,

7129
03:16:40,530 --> 03:16:40,711
dude.

7130
03:16:40,711 --> 03:16:41,610
It's almost four o'clock.

7131
03:16:42,530 --> 03:16:42,920
No,

7132
03:16:42,920 --> 03:16:43,980
I've been rambling forever.

7133
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:44,360
Yeah.

7134
03:16:44,360 --> 03:16:45,840
It's God damn time warp in this building.

7135
03:16:46,240 --> 03:16:47,073
How long,

7136
03:16:47,080 --> 03:16:47,490
how long?

7137
03:16:47,490 --> 03:16:48,550
We've been doing this for 17,

7138
03:16:48,810 --> 03:16:49,950
three hours and 17 minutes.

7139
03:16:49,980 --> 03:16:50,670
Damn.

7140
03:16:50,670 --> 03:16:53,090
Plus Vat for about a
half hour before that.

7141
03:16:53,250 --> 03:16:54,300
Can I plug some dates?

7142
03:16:54,330 --> 03:16:57,740
Please do ladies and
gentlemen live comedy comedy.

7143
03:16:57,750 --> 03:16:58,800
I'm going to be in Cleveland.

7144
03:16:58,801 --> 03:16:59,730
One of my favorite clubs.

7145
03:16:59,740 --> 03:17:01,110
Hilarides love that pledge.

7146
03:17:01,140 --> 03:17:02,910
January 17th or 19th.

7147
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:03,900
That's a great spot.

7148
03:17:04,400 --> 03:17:04,560
Yeah.

7149
03:17:04,560 --> 03:17:05,760
I love that play in Boston.

7150
03:17:05,761 --> 03:17:06,481
I'll be in Boston.

7151
03:17:06,481 --> 03:17:06,810
Jen,

7152
03:17:06,810 --> 03:17:07,561
Laugh Boston.

7153
03:17:07,561 --> 03:17:09,720
January 31st last time I was in Cleveland.

7154
03:17:09,721 --> 03:17:11,460
You were in Cleveland
and I did it with you.

7155
03:17:11,490 --> 03:17:11,941
That's right.

7156
03:17:11,941 --> 03:17:14,190
You stopped buying this
surprise guest spot.

7157
03:17:14,220 --> 03:17:15,053
That was fun.

7158
03:17:15,090 --> 03:17:15,840
That was fun.

7159
03:17:15,840 --> 03:17:16,620
Uh,

7160
03:17:16,620 --> 03:17:17,341
grand rapids,

7161
03:17:17,341 --> 03:17:18,081
Michigan,

7162
03:17:18,081 --> 03:17:18,340
uh,

7163
03:17:18,340 --> 03:17:21,680
in February and then a bunch of other
dates coming up and best buddies.

7164
03:17:21,700 --> 03:17:22,441
I'm doing a benefit.

7165
03:17:22,441 --> 03:17:25,080
January 27th at the comedy store.

7166
03:17:25,081 --> 03:17:26,550
You around bill burr.

7167
03:17:26,790 --> 03:17:27,840
He's going to be on the show.

7168
03:17:27,890 --> 03:17:28,501
Hang on a second.

7169
03:17:28,501 --> 03:17:29,610
I think you did it last year.

7170
03:17:29,640 --> 03:17:30,870
It's benefiting.

7171
03:17:30,920 --> 03:17:31,420
Uh,

7172
03:17:31,420 --> 03:17:34,290
definitely a group that helps
intellectually disabled people.

7173
03:17:34,380 --> 03:17:36,930
The 27th is a Sunday night.

7174
03:17:36,931 --> 03:17:37,540
Yeah.

7175
03:17:37,540 --> 03:17:38,380
Hi Man.

7176
03:17:38,381 --> 03:17:39,240
Greg got it.

7177
03:17:39,250 --> 03:17:40,270
Joe Rogan's in.

7178
03:17:40,271 --> 03:17:41,104
Come see it.

7179
03:17:41,900 --> 03:17:45,110
I've also got a new podcast with
Alison Rosen called childish,

7180
03:17:45,111 --> 03:17:47,450
where we talk about raising kids together.

7181
03:17:48,080 --> 03:17:48,861
Isn't she great?

7182
03:17:48,861 --> 03:17:49,550
She's very cool.

7183
03:17:49,550 --> 03:17:49,940
Yeah,

7184
03:17:49,940 --> 03:17:50,840
I did her.

7185
03:17:50,841 --> 03:17:51,674
Um,

7186
03:17:52,130 --> 03:17:56,060
I've had her on and I did her
when she was on Adam Kroll.

7187
03:17:56,061 --> 03:17:56,894
I did the show with her,

7188
03:17:57,280 --> 03:17:57,831
dumped together.

7189
03:17:57,831 --> 03:17:58,664
I like her a lot.

7190
03:17:58,670 --> 03:18:00,350
I think I did it a couple
times with her and Adam.

7191
03:18:00,520 --> 03:18:00,980
Yeah.

7192
03:18:00,980 --> 03:18:01,510
I like her a lot.

7193
03:18:01,510 --> 03:18:04,670
Used to each other's podcasts
constantly and we just realized like,

7194
03:18:04,790 --> 03:18:06,710
she was my best chemistry.

7195
03:18:06,711 --> 03:18:08,090
So we just started a podcast.

7196
03:18:08,120 --> 03:18:08,361
Yeah.

7197
03:18:08,361 --> 03:18:09,140
She's uh,

7198
03:18:09,140 --> 03:18:10,040
she's kind,

7199
03:18:10,041 --> 03:18:11,090
she's super smart.

7200
03:18:11,300 --> 03:18:11,931
She's cool.

7201
03:18:11,931 --> 03:18:12,840
She's reasonable.

7202
03:18:12,850 --> 03:18:13,521
Like she likes,

7203
03:18:13,521 --> 03:18:15,440
thinks about you can tell
she's thinking about things,

7204
03:18:15,500 --> 03:18:15,880
right?

7205
03:18:15,880 --> 03:18:16,190
Yeah.

7206
03:18:16,190 --> 03:18:16,460
Yeah.

7207
03:18:16,460 --> 03:18:17,293
That's awesome man.

7208
03:18:17,300 --> 03:18:18,050
I'm glad you're doing that.

7209
03:18:18,050 --> 03:18:18,380
Yeah.

7210
03:18:18,380 --> 03:18:19,370
And what is it called again?

7211
03:18:19,430 --> 03:18:20,300
Childish.

7212
03:18:20,450 --> 03:18:24,350
She's got a baby and another one on the
way and it's kind of me trying to teach

7213
03:18:24,351 --> 03:18:26,600
her how to parent and she's not buying it.

7214
03:18:28,550 --> 03:18:29,450
How many do we,

7215
03:18:29,780 --> 03:18:30,680
we just do one a week.

7216
03:18:30,681 --> 03:18:32,690
I think we've done like seven so far.

7217
03:18:32,810 --> 03:18:33,230
Nice.

7218
03:18:33,230 --> 03:18:34,011
And you still do your own,

7219
03:18:34,011 --> 03:18:34,280

7220
03:18:34,280 --> 03:18:34,760
Yup.

7221
03:18:34,760 --> 03:18:35,593
Uh,

7222
03:18:36,380 --> 03:18:37,213

7223
03:18:39,560 --> 03:18:40,670
How many hours we've been talking.

7224
03:18:41,800 --> 03:18:42,633
Shit,

7225
03:18:42,770 --> 03:18:43,603

7226
03:18:43,880 --> 03:18:44,510
