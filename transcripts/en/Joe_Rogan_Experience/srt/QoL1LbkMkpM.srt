1
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,730
Did your own experience podcast is
brought to you by the flashlight.

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,590
A lot of people like
what the fuck is that?

3
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:19,960
You leave your use Treemont and
then it just comes onto that.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,810
The fuck did I do man,

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,000
the Joe Rogan experience is brought to
you by the fleshlight and if you go to

6
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:32,530
Joe rogan.net and click on the link for
the flashlight and during the code name

7
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:37,360
Rogan save yourself a lot of money.
We found out 15% to be exact.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,500
We found out that um,
the,

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,700
the Joe Rogan experience listeners who
call into the fleshlight are much more

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,450
likely to buy them, the people that, uh,

11
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:51,340
the click on the website and
much more likely to buy them.

12
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:55,540
Then the average list with many, many,
many times, which is kind of crazy,

13
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,890
but maybe sad. Maybe we're all a bunch
of fucking twisted perverts. Yeah. Your,

14
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:04,760
your listeners are listeners
are all per for sure. Um,

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,400
if you go to, uh, Joe rogan.net,

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,760
there's also a link for Alpha
brain. What's Alpha brain?
Joe, do you have any? Yeah,

17
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:17,500
I do. I just need more. I,
I've now become your gel.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,020
Like the last, uh, since he
gave me that last bottle,

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,160
I think glass battery morning,
the, all the issues that, uh,

20
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,160
people started having about sensitivity.
We've eradicated them.

21
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,470
I was one of this batch. Yeah, but it
still has the same kick to it. It's, I'm,

22
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:31,941
you'd go to,

23
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:35,350
I have to go to onnit.com for all the
information because I'm not a fucking

24
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:38,950
scientist and I'm a little stoned.
But on it is o,

25
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:42,310
n n I t and what Alpha brain is,
is a nootropic.

26
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,430
It is a cognitive enhancing supplement.
You know,

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,930
it's a very slippery slope when you
start advertising shit. You know,

28
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:52,660
when you start selling things and people
know that the words that are coming out

29
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:56,440
of your mouth are designed to make money
and so they just assume that you will

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,190
be full of shit.

31
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,030
Like I can't tell you how many fucking
assholes I've had to deal with online

32
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,700
that say those are fucking placebo.

33
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:06,340
You're ripping people off for placebo.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,970
It is absolutely not a placebo.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There's no way nootropics would get
to this point through the scientific

36
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,850
community, scientific community
to the scientific community,

37
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:23,530
so the supplement community,
there's, there's no way
it's, these are not placebos.

38
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,900
They use them on Alzheimer's patients.

39
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:30,901
There's considerable amount of both
anecdotal evidence research and more

40
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,240
research is being done and
particularly by us. We've got,

41
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,370
we're running it right now. We're
running some double blind placebo study.

42
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:42,520
It takes months to do these things and
I don't want to talk too much about it

43
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:47,260
until after it's over, but if the results
are bad, I'll tell you, do not worry.

44
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,760
The results are good. I will tell you,
don't worry. I believe in supplements.

45
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,480
I've always used them.
I take every day I take fish oil,

46
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:59,770
I take key laded minerals.
I take multivitamins when I don't.

47
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:03,460
I don't feel as good. I don't have
as much energy when my diet sucks,

48
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:06,160
I don't feel as good either. When I'm
not eating healthy, I don't feel as good.

49
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,030
I believe it's very important
to take care of this body,

50
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:11,320
to take care of this vehicle.

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,910
It doesn't mean you know that you have
to fucking be a Vegan and you can't ever

52
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:19,510
have cheat days and eat ice cream.
That's bullshit.

53
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,380
I just think the majority of the food that
goes into your body should be healthy.

54
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,820
The majority. If you want to have a
burger, want to have a fucking burger man,

55
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:28,840
what are you going to live forever?

56
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,700
But the majority of your food should
be healthy. And on top of that,

57
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,760
I am a big fan of supplementation is
the thing that I was talking about.

58
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,780
Sledging is this some new
compound that's supposed to also,

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,250
it's not some new one. I just took it
today for the very first time. So, uh,

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,310
I'll tell you, I'll tell you what it
does. If it makes me feel any different.

61
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:54,130
I just took it like an hour ago.
So I'm not even sure when it kicks in.

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,470
There should be those,

63
00:03:55,471 --> 00:04:00,430
somebody that regulates all of these two
to make sure that you should be able to

64
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:04,930
take what you're taking. And Alpha
brain, you know, like that kind of shit.

65
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,300
Vitamins.
You don't have to worry about that shit.

66
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:12,280
But what you can worry about is when you
get into like compounded drugs and an

67
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,080
Ssri or eyes like, you know, the,

68
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:18,130
the issue that a lot of people
have had with taking a new mood,

69
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,690
which is another supplement we have, which
is a five HTP supplement and five HTP.

70
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,080
There are issues that people have
that are taking antidepressants.

71
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,970
So if you're taking an antidepressant,

72
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:32,650
essentially it's giving you a bunch of
dopamine, a bunch of serotonin rather.

73
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,240
And uh, it's a, it's giving it to you,
like the, the antidepressants are,

74
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,360
you're getting it from the antidepressants
and you're also getting it from the

75
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:44,800
five HTP, which is really basically
a natural antidepressant mean.

76
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,470
The word antidepressant mean
what is really going on? Well,

77
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:50,320
what's really going on is, and when
you're depressed, your serotonin is down.

78
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,310
It doesn't necessarily mean
that your life is any different,

79
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,030
but now all of a sudden you're enjoying
it. And there's a big debate on that.

80
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:58,720
You know,

81
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,350
there's a big debate on whether that's
smart and whether or not a lot of people

82
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:05,620
are taking antidepressants and fucking
with their brain chemistry when what is

83
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,470
really going on?
Is there an a shit stage of their life?

84
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,210
And if they can learn by
these bad feelings and learn
by the lessons they could

85
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:16,930
possibly move to a better
place in life where you know,

86
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:18,970
you eliminate all these things
that are making you feel bad,

87
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:22,540
improve upon all these areas that you
have real problems with and then you won't

88
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,080
have these bad feelings all the time.
You won't be quote unquote depressed.

89
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,530
But I know people that have
had fucked up lives, man,

90
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,490
that have used antidepressants and gotten
themselves back on track and then wean

91
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:35,560
themselves off of it and
are really happy today.

92
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,810
I have a friend that for you know,
he was,

93
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,190
he was on the verge of committing suicide.
He said he was super, super depressed,

94
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,720
terrible life, terrible childhood, you
know, very abusive childhood. But when,

95
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,720
when he got an antidepressants,
he got his shit together.

96
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,230
And then once he got his shit together,
he met his wife. He fell in love,

97
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,570
he started a business,
became very successful at this business,

98
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,810
then slowly weaned himself
off the antidepressants
and now he's very happy and

99
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:04,100
he's convinced that his state
of mind was directly related.

100
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:07,310
His depression was directly
related to how shit his life was,

101
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,650
but antidepressants saved his life. You
know, if everybody's story was like that,

102
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:15,710
I wouldn't even be remotely skeptical,
you know, I would say, hey, you know,

103
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:16,880
obviously this is a great thing,

104
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:21,881
but human beings were some slothy
fucking fuck Slovenly cunts.

105
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,690
And if we find just any excuse to take a
pill, oh, I need a Xanax, I can't deal.

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,180
I can't deal. There's a lot of
that going on and wasn't trim,

107
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:34,580
smile and help me out. I'm typing.
So fairly new trim spa. Um, anyway,

108
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:39,160
I have a pot of term spot. I should kill
you. No, that's not phen. Phen right now.

109
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,560
It's not like rip fuel,
rip fuel will kill.

110
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,880
I used to do Rick fuel in high school.
You won't kill everybody.

111
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:50,000
It only kills pussies, but
it will kill you. I'm crazy.

112
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:53,480
I don't know why he used to do that.
Then I think it was like kick it. Yeah,

113
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,810
speed is speed. It's like,
just like caffeine is speed.

114
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,220
I remember thinking is speed.
What is speed?

115
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:03,740
Speed's a nickname for things that
are accelerants things a fucking fire,

116
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:07,100
your heart rate through the roof.
That shit's terrible to do Jujitsu on.

117
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,460
I did Jujitsu on it once. I almost had
a heart attack because it was like,

118
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:12,200
it was like being on crank like you have,

119
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,740
your heart is already pounding too
hard and Jujitsu is all about like

120
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:17,060
maintaining your heart rate.

121
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,650
Like it's all about like keeping a
pace going and uh, you know, and,

122
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:23,450
and not wearing out.
Like if you just try to sprint real quick,

123
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:25,370
then you're going to get tired and
then the guy's gonna choke you.

124
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,970
Like it's all about like, and then
the rip fuels the worst for that shit.

125
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,560
It's terrible for your cardio.
You're like, I remember
the bottle, I see the logo.

126
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,390
It's not illegal. Right. They
got rid of it. Right. It,

127
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,870
they might've changed the formula because
I feel like I've seen it recently.

128
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,030
My point about all this Alpha brain,

129
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:44,750
all this supplement stuff is anything
that I'm telling you about is something

130
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:48,590
that I use and I believe in.
That's it. I don't need to do this.

131
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,880
I don't need to sell these things.

132
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:53,090
I'm selling these things cause they're
legit because I support them because I

133
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:55,750
use them, I get the benefits
from them, I believe in them,

134
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,580
and then after all that
we make money from them.

135
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,920
We make it as fair as possible.
I'm trying to rip off no one.

136
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:06,260
I want everyone to feel like
they had a good interaction.

137
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:10,160
So the way it works is when you
buy your first order of 30 pills,

138
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,340
if you don't like it,
you get 100% of your money back.

139
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:16,010
You don't have to send the pills back.
You don't have to send the bottle back.

140
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,710
You don't have to do shit. You just
say, this sucks. Give me my money back.

141
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,300
That's how much we believe that you will
like it and you'll want to keep using

142
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:26,210
it.
There's nothing better in this life.

143
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Then doing your best to improve your
quality of thinking and the quality of

144
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,960
thinking that you have.
When you've done your best and you're,

145
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,400
you're taking care of your body and
you improve your quality of thinking,

146
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,720
you make better choices.

147
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:41,330
When you make better choices and
you think about things better,

148
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,980
your life becomes better.

149
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,310
I think there's no more important thing
in this life than maintaining a quality

150
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:53,240
of thinking. And that's what
I use Alpha brain for. And uh,

151
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,440
that's why I endorse it. That's, I take
three of these bitches before every fox.

152
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,420
I mean, yeah, I can forward
it gave me a jerk. Yeah.

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,450
Well, the last one, I
used to take three cars,

154
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,220
but then I started getting that a slight
headache for was like I had a shaky

155
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:15,390
hand when I was playing pool.
Yeah. I just think, uh, you know,

156
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:18,540
if you were playing football or something
crazy, I think four would be great. Um,

157
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,870
but what,
you know,

158
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,530
the thing that I've been getting
into lately is the shroom tech. This,

159
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,630
the quarter steps mushrooms,
uh,

160
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,870
supplement dude is 100% legit.

161
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:31,710
I had way more energy than I deserved.
Last night I was the last guy on the mat.

162
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,190
I'm never the last guy in the map,
but I took five of those fucking things.

163
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,690
It says take four, but I took five. She's
five right before class. It was awesome.

164
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,660
We're going to over desk.
It's just mushrooms.

165
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,740
It's just mushrooms and B12 and be 12 you
don't overdose on, you piss it all out,

166
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:51,570
but man, it's amazing how you can
affect your energy levels by nutrients.

167
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,000
Really amazing. You know? I, like I said,

168
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,820
I've eaten like shit for a few
days and especially as I got older,

169
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,500
I really feel it much more now than when
I was 20 when I was 20 I felt like I

170
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:04,290
need to eat a cheeseburger and then go
work out and it wouldn't even hardly

171
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,160
bother me that much,

172
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,930
but now it's just every little thing
has to be in order for my body to feel

173
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:12,690
smell.
Anyway,

174
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,690
go to [inaudible] dot com
check out all that shit,

175
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,480
check out all the different
supplements that are available.

176
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,690
I stand by and we got credibles
kettle bells around their coming out.

177
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,990
That'll be coming out very
soon. I definitely, yeah,

178
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,030
I think they're already
on the up on the website.

179
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,820
We're just trying to figure out
the pricing and the shipping.

180
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:32,680
It's very fucking expensive
to ship cannon balls. Yeah,

181
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,060
it was really canon balls with
handles its way it should or whatever.

182
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:36,661
It makes it heavy.

183
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:39,660
Should be something that you could
just buy at a grocery store. Yeah,

184
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:43,500
but no one's going to do that. I wouldn't.
What if it was something like, oh yeah,

185
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:45,300
it's just a bunch of pepper.

186
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,570
The lightest kettle bell
pepper.

187
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,550
That's the most ridiculous
shit I've ever heard.

188
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,920
They have some that you fill
up with water, but again,

189
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,660
you can't make it heavy
enough. You know, if I,

190
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,460
when a 50 pound Kettlebell to train with,

191
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,000
I have a bowling ball bag that I bring
on the road with me or if I want to bring

192
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:05,010
them on the road because all
I have to do is bring one.

193
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:09,240
I don't need a gym anywhere.
If I bring one 50 pound kettle bell,

194
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,350
I got one workout that I do
with a 35 pound kettle bell.

195
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:13,740
It's fucking awesome man.

196
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,970
It's a brutal workout and it's
a 35 pound kettle bell. Yeah,

197
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:20,220
I need to get him my waist seam at
target and I always went to buy one.

198
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,940
I just been using my Pekinese instead.
Did you know you needed to do for real,

199
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,000
you need to just take up
something like spinning.

200
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,750
I don't have time to do any.
You got make my time.

201
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,260
There's people that work full time
jobs and train for the Olympics. Man.

202
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,530
You've got the time too busy son.
Get realistic.

203
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,820
If you really wanted to do something, you
would join a gym, join a gym membership,

204
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,420
join,
join a gym and go to like some classes.

205
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,720
Go to like a hardcore class where you,
you enjoy it.

206
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,630
Somebody else is making me
do it and then it's over.

207
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:54,070
You're doing it with everybody else
in the class. It's a really easy

208
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,930
way to get a good workout in.
Yeah.

209
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,520
I know a friend that's going to yoga
class some wing until she graduates.

210
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:03,060
So I can be your first person cause lunch.

211
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,100
Just go to yoga because I don't want
to do it in front of other people.

212
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,310
I want my own private yoga instructor
in my bedroom or something. You should,

213
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:14,010
you should go to yoga class
and meets. That's embarrassing.
Yoga bitches, Sun Yoga.

214
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,240
People are embarrassing so far.

215
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:19,410
If all the time is I too many
uncomfortable moments and yoga. Well,

216
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:21,760
it's really uncomfortable was when he
talked to them and they bring up like

217
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:26,140
crystals and energy and that's, that's
where Yoga crosses the line, right?

218
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,480
It crosses,
crosses the line into fuckery.

219
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:33,160
When you start worshiping rocks and the
energy that come off these rocks and you

220
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:36,940
start, you know, sacred this and sacred
that, unless you're fucking around,

221
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,890
you say sacred.
You know,

222
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:42,100
you have to be fucking around or talking
about like war or something like that.

223
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,170
That's it. That's the end
of the commercial. Um, go
to Joe Rogan. Dot. Neck.

224
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,080
Use the code name, Rogan. Click on the
link for Alpha brain. Use the code name.

225
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:54,580
Rogan. Save yourself 10% off.
All right. You dirty bitches,

226
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,200
great Joe Rogan Experience

227
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,400
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

228
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,830
Hopefully internets. I
got to wear this, uh,

229
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,350
this tee shirt that I got
from these kids in Canada.

230
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,780
Blue Gorilla Glue radio. It's
out in the hallway. Cool.

231
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,680
I'll go get it. But I just did
this show in Edmonton, man,

232
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,910
these fucking shows.
It's all,

233
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,520
there's many times where we're doing
these shows and hanging out after these

234
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:32,340
shows where I'm like,
well,

235
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,900
this feels like it's some sort
of a weird dream or something.

236
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,370
This doesn't seem realistic. It doesn't
seem like that, you know, there's,

237
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,570
it's when you're just sitting
around and it's just you and me,

238
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:44,980
and this is how this all started.

239
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,600
So you and me and a laptop just sitting
around and then you think of the fucking

240
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:53,620
numbers of people now that,
that tune into this thing.

241
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,540
It's very surreal because to us,
we're still in the same spot.

242
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,350
We're still doing the same thing.

243
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,350
We're still sitting in my fucking hoarders
office boxes is turning into hoarders

244
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,800
office.
Don is ridiculous.

245
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,110
I've got to throw an
almost everything out.

246
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,240
It's like a lot of it is like gifts
though from people that uh, yeah.

247
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,700
You have a lot of cool Schwag here man.

248
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:18,580
Yeah and a lot of apple
products that are unopened.

249
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,250
Just the thing over there,
you got to,

250
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,590
it was a bag over there with an apple,
something that's stuff in there.

251
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,120
It's funny here on my hard drive crashed
so I had to get a new hard drive. Yeah,

252
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,880
sorry. I had to get a new
Imac. My Shit's been acting.

253
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:37,130
All my max have been acting really fucked
up lately and there's two things that

254
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,150
that that that are really what?
It's a government man.

255
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,250
Well one is iPhone has a problem
that no one has been talking about.

256
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,910
I haven't seen where the text messages
are disappearing right in front of your

257
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:49,810
eyes.
Like go sit there,

258
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,050
open it up and suddenly at the
text messages just disappears.

259
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,450
I told you,
you sent me a photo and the photo vanish.

260
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,620
I looked down and I saw the preview of
the photo and then I went back to my

261
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:03,500
thing I did was in the middle of playing
pool, so I didn't look at it right then.

262
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,570
When I went back to look at
it later, it was gone. Yeah,

263
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,530
that Shit's been happening to me more
and more and I don't hear anybody else

264
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:13,190
talking about government. The government
stealing our texts or text messages.

265
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,040
Yeah, they're going to find out
how fucking boring we really are.

266
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,210
Talk a lot of shit. Talk a little shit
on the podcast. Occasionally smoked pot.

267
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,790
Ooh,
dangerous.

268
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,410
And the second thing is the flash on
safari and chrome and everything has been

269
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:30,830
really horrible lately to the point
where it's been freezing up my computer

270
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:33,590
until I moved the cursor
down to the toolbar.

271
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,080
And then for some reason I
don't have to click on anything.

272
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,200
I just moved the cursor down to
the bottom and unfreeze everything.

273
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,790
And it's really weird.

274
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,820
I don't you think that's a memory issue
is that no, it's the government, Joe,

275
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,300
the government governments in flash
governments in flash from Flash,

276
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,830
they could learn a lot from flash.
Right.

277
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:55,890
Because I guess a lot of those probably
pornos that are online or flash or

278
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:58,220
aren't they? Yeah. A lot
of them are still flash,

279
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,530
but a lot of them have been
switching over to html five,

280
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:01,850
which seems to be a decent,

281
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,660
that's so you can watch them on iPads
once they realized that people were going

282
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:10,570
to iPods. Right. It's amazing. They should
figure that out by now. Right? Yeah.

283
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,530
It's amazing how,

284
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,620
how porn just evaporated before our
eyes as far as like as an industry.

285
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,320
My next door neighbor's a up porn guy
was my next door neighbor years ago down

286
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,670
the street and uh,

287
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,690
I think they just repossessed his
house or something like that. It's um,

288
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,520
these guys like, we're like high
on the hog. I mean these guys,

289
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,510
I know dudes who were in the porn business
who are making millions and millions

290
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,200
of dollars. I mean they had incredible
cars. They had these beautiful houses.

291
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,590
These guys are making fuckloads
of money selling DVDs.

292
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,570
Well the Internet just took the wheels
out from under them like completely and

293
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:51,980
that's an industry that's like,

294
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,600
nobody talks about that because the,

295
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,610
there's some hidden sort of a moral
like judgment that you pass on porn till

296
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:05,570
it's like fuck them.
They didn't deserve it.

297
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,330
They didn't deserve the money they were
making. You know, they deserved it.

298
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:11,450
They got it on the back of
exploited women and they, you know,

299
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:14,990
blah blah blah blah blah.
For whatever reason we make a distinction.

300
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,180
It's legal and it's a business,

301
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,920
but it doesn't need to be
bailed out as much as cars do.

302
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,180
Car companies like we can't lose Chevy.
But if we lost vivid pictures,

303
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:27,014
who gives a fuck?

304
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:32,140
But then the hypocritical aspect of it
is fucking this is $1 billion industry is

305
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:38,810
everybody's using it. Like to pretend
that everybody's not using it is insanity.

306
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,570
Like the amount of people that are
online that are looking at porn,

307
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,370
it's something crazy. It's something
like porn is 40% of everything online.

308
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,790
Something nutty like that. I
forgot, pulled that right of my ass.

309
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,100
I think I might have read that, but I
can't keep track of all these numbers.

310
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,160
You stop and think about that number.

311
00:17:56,161 --> 00:18:00,180
That's a lot of God damn people
and everyone's pretend in this.

312
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:03,020
This industry doesn't need to
be saved. You know, they, they,

313
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,780
they couldn't get any respect if they
wanted to try to get a bail out for the

314
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,720
government because the economy
went south from, they'd be like,

315
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,050
what the fuck are you talking about?
What are you gonna do man?

316
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,330
What are you gonna do with newborn?
What are you going to get by?

317
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,870
I think it's like everything that
like look at like, you know, you have,

318
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:22,760
porn is now not making money because now
the access to being able to do porn is

319
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:23,690
so much easier.

320
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,350
Radio station DJ's aren't making as much
money and they're failing because now

321
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:31,370
podcasting has been able to tick to read
and easily you can do it at your own

322
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:34,760
house now and have your own radio
show and that's just like TV.

323
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:38,150
That's like every single thing ever now
because everything's now more diluted.

324
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:41,450
You're more, it's more accurate
to what you want to see.

325
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,380
Like I want to see a band that's a two
people are dead in the drummer still

326
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:48,830
alive. You know it's probably out there
on the Internet if that's your fetish,

327
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:50,990
if that's your thing,
that's your music choice.

328
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,560
Where before it was kind of like
whatever you were pumped or whatever was

329
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:59,561
available at the CD shop or and whatever
you were sold on the local radio

330
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:00,320
station.

331
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,040
So money is just more scattered out and
like porn is easier now because like me,

332
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:08,300
I can now watch some girl that's a
waitress and fucking Indiana, you know,

333
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:12,020
put a Dildo in her ass for free.
You know, I'm going to watch that.

334
00:19:12,021 --> 00:19:13,250
I'm going to have to spend my fucking,

335
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:17,480
I've never spent money on porn in my
life now I'm fucking spending $20 a month

336
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,800
sending it to her.

337
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:22,460
And that's what a lot of these porn
websites used to charge $20 a month.

338
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,260
So you are your go to Web Cam Sites on
the web cam sites. These are real people.

339
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,790
These are real fucking blue collar.
Even in your jerky jerking off,

340
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,630
like you're like Middle America. If you
don't have to be like I'm not hot. Right.

341
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:38,920
You're like, I'm like, uh, I
like normal fucking girl. Yeah.

342
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,590
Hot Normal girl. Yeah, six.

343
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:46,200
But she's got a nice smile once in
a while I'll click on the Africa,

344
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,950
the checkbox on the very bottom
cause that you could, uh, you know,

345
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,350
a lot of these websites you can choose
what's countries you want to see.

346
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,820
And so I just see a bunch of African
women sitting around and going, hey,

347
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,110
by the Lesbian Africans that
women I've noticed. Wow.

348
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:04,370
They just probably get tired of dudes
raping them. They just go those bow wow.

349
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,400
African, what do they jerking
off with gourds or anything
crazy like, no, they're,

350
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:13,410
they're pretty basic and it's funny like
the vibrators into different countries,

351
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:18,860
how they look like the ones that they
were using really did seem like antiques,

352
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,770
you know, like wooden or, or you know,

353
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:25,370
something like that where like then you
go to like click on Asia and all those

354
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,500
girls that they're either Vietnam,
Vietnam,

355
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:29,570
where they're using bamboo
sticks and stuff like that.

356
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:33,920
Or they're actually like Japanese where
they have these high tech vibrators like,

357
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:37,790
like once you've never seen before and
it looked like fucking dolphins with hats

358
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:38,550
on.

359
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,383
Wow.

360
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,770
How many different web cam
shows have you watched know?

361
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,560
Oh, I do it every night. It's my
new Twitter man. I go to it time.

362
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:48,580
I want to masturbate now.

363
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,450
I go to my free cams and
I have no connection with
these guys. It's my favorite,

364
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,820
my free cams.
I fucking love it.

365
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,260
I saw about five different people on how
does it go? If you go to my free cams,

366
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,360
it's, well one, it's the worst
designed website ever and, and I,

367
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,530
I don't know who owns it and
if they ever listened to this,

368
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:09,070
really spend the money on your website.
That shit so fucking crazy.

369
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,660
But you just get this
checkerboard of cameras and it's,

370
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,820
you just scroll down, you choose
what options you want, you choose,

371
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,970
click on one of them and
then it's usually free.

372
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,790
And what you do is just hang out in
this chat. I'm looking at it now.

373
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:26,170
It's just a bunch of photos of girls.
Those are sticking out.

374
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:29,720
These can't all be real
girls. Yup. Yup. Oh No.

375
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,850
Go to a home or what's online right now?

376
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,940
What's online right now?
Okay.

377
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,430
Yeah. These are girls that are
online models online. Yeah.

378
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,740
These are girls are online. And
then when you go to them, yeah,

379
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:48,280
you go to them and when you log in then
they showed a little previews of them.

380
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:50,350
And so every time you log in you
just see a bunch of previous,

381
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,880
oh this girl's just playing
with her titties. Titties. Wow.

382
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,350
This is bizarre.
Bizarre.

383
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,610
And the thing is is you'd never have
to spend money there, you know, ever.

384
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:04,570
But this is so strange.
What am I awesome?

385
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:07,570
One of my favorite things to do is, what
you do is you put 20 bucks in at a time,

386
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:09,190
you get kind of like points,
you know?

387
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,660
And so my favorite thing to do is you
can also spy on like private shows like

388
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:17,320
these girls are doing with other
people. You know, it costs more,

389
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,330
but you kind of jump in real
quick and you're just like,

390
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:23,020
what's going on in this creepy room?
Like, what's this guy making this girl?

391
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:26,620
Do you know what I mean?
How can you spy on private rooms?

392
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,550
It will say that the show is private
and then underneath it it says spy on

393
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:34,900
private show. So you could just
sit there and it's ridiculous.

394
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,690
That's not private then. Yeah.
But if you knew that going in,

395
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,630
you know you're like all right,
whatever it, cause it's a lot of money.

396
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:43,870
Like I'll do it like 10 seconds time like
right when I know I'm about to come or

397
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,970
I'll find a private show real quick. I'm
like okay. And it's a little bit hotter,

398
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:53,200
you know? But I don't understand
how they can sell it as private.

399
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,020
You could be a hundred percent private,
like mid private.

400
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,070
And so the mid privates are what most
people do because if it's 100% private

401
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:05,060
costs more for the person to do.
The private chef,

402
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,320
people want to get really freaky.

403
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,270
There'll be a hundred percent hundred
percent private or he'd just go on,

404
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,190
got to do,
take advantage of your area.

405
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:18,160
He should probably doesn't get
off to a couple of those girls.

406
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,380
Just cause you don't see it every day.
It's like,

407
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:23,140
well we're looking at a girl's ankle
and the 17 hundreds you don't see it.

408
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:29,250
There's like old ladies or there's like
black really old black fat ladies that

409
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:32,110
kind of turns me on once in a while.
It's because you don't see that.

410
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:36,940
You don't masturbate to that everyday.
Some of these bitches just,

411
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,050
they just sit there and do it enough.
It was big giant guitars.

412
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,050
But that's what's cool is when you find,
when you create account,

413
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,430
you could see it refreshes
all these avatars

414
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,870
and you can see who's doing what.

415
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,220
Like oh I'm clicking on the growth of
Delta owner. She muted everybody. Yeah.

416
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,640
How dare she? Uh, yeah cause you have,

417
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,000
that's where you have to create count
cause he can't chat until you actually put

418
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,870
it.
I'm not doing any chat.

419
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,460
When you chat,
what do you talk to these girls about it?

420
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,260
I usually just say off guard,

421
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,800
I want to take you to off garden
and things like that. Yeah.

422
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,680
And it makes them laugh
every time. They're like, you
want to take me? No, I love,

423
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:12,360
I have guard anything.

424
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,500
I would love the other or one of these
days you're going to be doing this to a

425
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:18,650
girl who knows the show. Oh, it's
already happened, dude. Dude,

426
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:21,560
you tell her who you are because I've
talked about this website before.

427
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:24,530
I'll say like all of garden and people
would like desk God for life bitches and

428
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:28,100
stuff like that. Shit. That's a lot of
our listeners are already on this shit.

429
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,750
These girls that are really hot. Yeah.
I can't believe this. This is so crazy.

430
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:38,020
It's like peering into this world of hot
girls that are taking off their clothes

431
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:41,540
and then just sitting around here.
The window's really small though.

432
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,410
Does it expand it? There's this five
dots on the right side of the Webcam.

433
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,670
Oh Dude. You just dragged that shit. Do
whatever you want to do some screen caps.

434
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,540
No, nevermind. Wow.
Screencast. Oh, that's right.

435
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,740
Because then they know. Then they will
fix it all. Sweetie, why are you smoking?

436
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,020
That bums me out. A lot of marijuana use
marijuana use doesn't bum me out man.

437
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:05,660
But when I see a chick with a cigarette,
I want to suite,

438
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,290
there's this black or I wish I could
remember her name on it and she never

439
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,210
really shows her face too much.

440
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,680
But she has a hot body and she
always has this huge fucking Dildo,

441
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,820
just suction cup onto the coffee table
and the camera's always just her.

442
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:23,350
But just teasing it like, like she's
just going to take the whole thing. Oh.

443
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,543
But she talks,

444
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,800
oh my God,
I'm such a bad little girl.

445
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,950
Do you know how they have those uh,
previews?

446
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:37,790
Like if you click on some porn sites,
they have like a preview.

447
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,420
You will have to watch their camp,

448
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,590
a commercial for their camp site before
they show you the actual porn. Yeah,

449
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,350
they had, you know, you don't,
you get different ones every time.

450
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,450
I Dunno who is editing these fucking
things, but one of 'em was this chick.

451
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:55,100
She was, she was at least like, I
would say 35 40 pounds overweight.

452
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,470
She was black as coal and the bottom
or feet or in front of the camera.

453
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,930
So I was like a bomber feet,
which are really pink.

454
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,280
It was like an odd pink and her feet
are like bucking in front of the camera

455
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:11,000
while she is fucking the
shit out of her black,

456
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,370
black pussy.
With this deal though,

457
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:18,200
it could not have been a least sexual
thing. It was like, it was, it was like,

458
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,990
like grunting and shit. It was, I mean,

459
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,170
I guess it was sexual if that's what
you're into, but for me it was like,

460
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:27,650
what the fuck? Like I, I
would put my boner away.

461
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,600
You may be washed out for a minute. It's
like, what are you trying to do? Who's,

462
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,170
who's looking at dangling? Yeah, she'll
fuck me. There's certain girls we go,

463
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:37,790
she'll fuck you. You know, you look,

464
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,060
you look at the guys they fuck on film
and the things that people do to them and

465
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,240
you know, girls that like drink a
of calm or guys pull their eyes,

466
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,710
lids open and shoot loads in their
eyes. That girl, fuck yeah, let go.

467
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,600
That poor kid, that poor kid doesn't
know what the fuck she's doing.

468
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,950
She's a little fuck Zombie on my free
cams. It's tried to search for this name,

469
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,790
apple bottom teen. That's the
black chick. And if she's online,

470
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:04,020
just turn up your speakers and
fucking sit back and enjoy life.

471
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,930
I can't watch this and do
a show at the same time.

472
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,070
We want to blanket for
your bone or did here.

473
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,750
That's just be sitting here watching
street of your jacket makes me my boner

474
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,290
beggar. Hey, I've been sitting on and
it's warm in my field, but it would

475
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,400
so is the uh,
what is the profit?

476
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,950
How do they make profit from this site?

477
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,150
The girls get a fraction of whatever
money is donated to them and I,

478
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,260
I don't think it's very good.

479
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,360
I'm sure there's other
websites that are a lot better.

480
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:39,570
Like my free camps that does not pay the
girls as good as the lot of the other

481
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:44,390
websites. Oh really? Wow. His name
is fuck me hard. Really? Yeah.

482
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,310
If you find apple bottom team,
dude, you're going to love it.

483
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,480
Some bitches just leave their camera on
and leave the room. That shit is rude.

484
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,400
This approach. There's a lot of that to
fuck me hard. How dare you? Fuck me. Hard.

485
00:27:56,401 --> 00:28:00,750
69 she just seen her fucking
computer desk. How dare you?

486
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,630
They just get lazy.
It's probably,

487
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:06,270
they probably lived their whole
day in front of the Webcam,

488
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,520
just trying to collect money. Yup. Wow.

489
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,710
What a weird way for
chicks to get attention.

490
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,090
And some of them really fucking love it.
I bet they loved that.

491
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,570
Every time they log on, there's thousands
of guys waiting to beat off to them.

492
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,780
You know?
That's like a gotta be kind of a trip.

493
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,640
And I bet if a lot of chicks have shit
jobs and they start doing this and raking

494
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:29,180
in the cash saying,
you know how I mean,

495
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,580
just like doing podcasting from
your house, how easy is it to,

496
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,400
you can just now have a job that you
can do from your house and that's what

497
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:36,270
these girls are doing.
They're like,

498
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:40,770
why do I want to be a waitress at Chili's
when I could fuck make twice as much a

499
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:44,670
home? Just fucking shut in my bottle.
Yeah. He's a what? A crazy roll. The dice.

500
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:49,080
It is for a girl to be born hot. Such a
powerful fucking roll that dice. Yeah,

501
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,530
because it's really all you need
for a lot of these girls. I mean,

502
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,180
all they need is the,

503
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:59,210
just to have the right bone structure
and the right dimensions and the right

504
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,290
look and boom. Everybody didn't mean
it's just like hitting the lottery.

505
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,260
I guess.
It's sort of his for a dude to,

506
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,000
but dude's still got to go out
and fucking make something happen.

507
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:16,320
You can't be a loser and look like that.
There's no losers that look like,

508
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,830
what's her name? Christy
Canyon. Remember that porn star?

509
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,210
There's no losers still look like
that even though she was a porn star.

510
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,510
You know what I'm saying? Right.
Well, she was so hot. She was,

511
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:30,850
the best example I can put up was what's,
um,

512
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,040
the fuck is her name?
That, oh, Cindy Crawford.

513
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,130
It's impossible to be a loser.
If you look like Cindy Crawford,

514
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,060
you really can't be a loser. She's
just too hot. You know what I mean? And

515
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,430
be like,

516
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:47,320
you could be a guy and you could be like
the male equivalent to Cindy Crawford,

517
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,880
like bone structure Wise Hanson was,

518
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:54,150
and still wind up fucking broken
alone easily. You know, you,

519
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,990
you're not going to be a loser if you
look that good. She's just too hot.

520
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,430
This is it. Like values. It's
so much somehow or another,

521
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,440
some wealthy man will find his way
into her life and marry her away.

522
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,630
But for a dude she does. You
know, it's not worth as much.

523
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,730
It's not,

524
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,910
it's not as much of a roll of the dice
for a guy to be born good looking for,

525
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,670
for a girl, if that's all you're
trying to get done in this life.

526
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:22,180
Not saying that that's all. Every
woman was trying to get done, ladies.

527
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,130
It's all get crazy. Don't, don't get
angry at me. That's not what I'm saying.

528
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,620
Like that's all you're capable of.
That's not what I'm saying,

529
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,880
but I'm saying it's a fucking big
deal. It's a big deal. It'd be hot.

530
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,770
Yeah. But you know, a lot of these girls
and these rooms are not even hot at all,

531
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,120
but that's even makes it hotter because
this girl looks like somebody that would

532
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:46,950
never do this and she's doing it.
That's high. I love this shit, man.

533
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,090
I ain't never been more addicted
to porn that ever in my life.

534
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,180
When I was 18. How long did this
start off? When did this start out?

535
00:30:54,181 --> 00:30:55,410
But I don't know man.

536
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,940
I think I've always like Anthony from opn.
Anthony.

537
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,190
Uh, there used to be this website that I
used to be addicted to that he's always

538
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:08,940
talking about, I forget the name of it
was a Webcam website. Cal Talk. How talk.

539
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,600
I used to pay for a membership for pow
talk and one of the best things is while

540
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:16,530
the show's going on, used to go on
these girls that were fans of opiate,

541
00:31:16,531 --> 00:31:19,950
Anthony would just be sitting there for
shoving vibrators on in there and all of

542
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:22,980
us would be watching,
even while they're doing a radio show,

543
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,390
everyone would be watching that shit off.

544
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,040
Didn't you show me that once
at the Tattoo place? Yeah.

545
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:31,620
You were showing me we were at
the tattoo place. Yeah. Yeah.

546
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,010
And you were a broadcaster when you're
getting your tattoo. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,680
And Pal. Talk, talk, and then you're
showing me, look at this girl,

548
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:38,550
what the fuck is she doing?

549
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,890
Just regular girls finger banging
themselves, fingered the girl,

550
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,110
had two fingers in her butt hole and like,
Whoa,

551
00:31:49,111 --> 00:31:53,720
Jesus. That was one of our
first broadcast, you know,

552
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,700
doing that and doing green rooms,
but that,

553
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,980
I remember sitting there just with
my laptop just pointing at you.

554
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,030
How many texts a day do you get to say
desk squad, bitches, twitters, Twitter.

555
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:03,864
So yeah.

556
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,780
Yeah. Twitter is Facebook messages. Yeah.

557
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,980
It's funny how that all came out of some
fucking silly meeting at the opiate.

558
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:17,300
Anthony show a dumb thing to
name yourselves death squad,

559
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,930
but because somebody else named us, we're
allowed, we're allowed to keep it. Have

560
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,980
you heard the band death squad? I think
those are bad bands called Jessica.

561
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:29,780
Really? Yeah, there's, there's,
there's a song called red band,

562
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:33,670
which is actually pretty good
at listening to ban the ban.

563
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,820
I think it's that.

564
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,270
It's either the artist is named red band
or the song is called red bands from a

565
00:32:38,271 --> 00:32:39,104
diner or

566
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:45,620
uh, like a year ago, two
years ago, something like,
hmm, wonder if he is a fan.

567
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,360
I don't know. Podcast fan
maybe likes, yeah. I don't
know. It's weird. Do you ever,

568
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:54,820
do you ever, uh, do you ever want to
sing again because you had that hit song

569
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:01,550
and I think somebody should dubstep
that song. I really did have a song.

570
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,110
It was only a hit in one town though.
Tempe, Phoenix and Tempe and Phoenix,

571
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:09,540
Arizona. For whatever reason,
there was these guys, uh,

572
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:14,210
Tim and Mark Shit. Why is it always
like so hard to remember? Oh,

573
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:18,740
that's what else? Pretty short term.
Supposed to take four a day. There.

574
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,890
They were great guys. Um, and they, uh,

575
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,330
had a radio station down there and they
played it and there were like one of the

576
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:27,680
few people that ever played it.

577
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,520
And for whatever reason
it took off in one town.

578
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,550
Like I sold way more records in
Phoenix than I did anywhere else.

579
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:39,770
It became one of the reasons why I
filmed my 2005 special in Phoenix. She's,

580
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,770
I just had a bigger draw there than almost
anywhere. It was real weird, you know,

581
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,270
and p and when I started doing
standup, people were like, do the song,

582
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:50,330
like I can't fucking sing. Like I only,
I only did that song because it was like,

583
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,410
you know,
it was broken up into like choruses.

584
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:56,150
We could splice it all together.

585
00:33:56,151 --> 00:34:00,030
It was all done like
in a computer with um,

586
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,390
what is it called, what's
pro tools, you know,

587
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:05,690
how they do it and move everything
around. So it was like, you know,

588
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:07,040
if I just did it by myself,

589
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:10,970
then I'd have to practice and actually
like start singing it and like I just

590
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:15,410
want to do it for fun. And the idea
was Warner brothers executive idea,

591
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,560
his idea was if I came
up with like a song,

592
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,860
then they could play something
on the radio to help sell the CD.

593
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,830
So song was about Voodoo Pussy.
The song was called Voodoo poo nanny.

594
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,110
And you could probably find it on,

595
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,940
it's probably not even an iTunes because
I don't think that CD is on iTunes.

596
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:33,720
I'm going to get it put on iTunes.

597
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,740
My first CD from 1999 Warner brothers
was bought out by Disney in the middle of

598
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,960
my, um, my time there. What about her
records? I wonder whether the records,

599
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,950
I think it was Disney, but they went
like super family values and my,

600
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,930
my CD was dirty as fuck.

601
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,470
My CD started out with two guys fucking
each other in the basement of one of the

602
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:56,390
most amazing,
I'm sure everyone's heard it,

603
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:58,610
but it was one of the
most amazing skits ever.

604
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,930
It's one of my favorite things I've
ever done because I knew that, uh,

605
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,610
I could never do it anywhere else.
I was like,

606
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,000
I want to write something that's
so fucked up and it can't be,

607
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,420
it can't be on stage. I can't do
it on stage cause I'd act it out.

608
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:14,780
It wouldn't be as funny. You want to do
it visually? No, I don't want to see,

609
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,490
I don't want to actually see it.
I just,

610
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,670
it's better to actually just hear this
and what it is is two guys who were gay,

611
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:24,890
but they try to pretend
that they're not gay.

612
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:28,010
They just really like lifted weights
and it always winds up them fucking each

613
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:31,610
other and always like,
you got a fucking great ass.

614
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:36,470
It's wound and muscular.
Really? Eh, dude, I bet.

615
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:41,640
I don't even think I could get my cock in
your ass. Oh, cool man. And it became, uh,

616
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,150
you know, just this thing and you
know, me and Brian Cowen did it.

617
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:51,180
Brian counts the other voice in
it and I'm the fuck is her name.

618
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:56,610
Goddammit. Kelly. Kirsten. Yes.
Kelly. Kirsten for real. I know. Yeah,

619
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,970
but you had to say that name all the
time. Chuck, Here's together Carson.

620
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:03,600
But you'd say it as Joey and I was like
an olive garden between me and Jodie is.

621
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,740
Yeah, Kelly. Uh, Kelly played my
mom or mom, my, and Brian's mom.

622
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,100
She's so funny. And, uh,

623
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,350
Ginger Lynn introduced to
[inaudible] on the, uh,

624
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,110
on the CD and I got to do a
thing with her the other day.

625
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,740
I did Dave's old porn with her.
Dave's old porn is,

626
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:26,190
first of all it's David tell
was so fucking funny man.

627
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,600
He's just one of those guys. It's like,
and he works hard man in between takes,

628
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,560
they got notes,

629
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:35,310
notebooks and shit and they're going
over scenes and what's a good scene and

630
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:40,200
what about this and then and, and you
know, and then you sit there and you,

631
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,310
you watch these porns and then you
do like mystery science theater.

632
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,970
I remember that show. You've seen Dave's
old porn for those who haven't seen it,

633
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,560
you're sitting on a couch with Dave and
you're just kind of clowning on porn and

634
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,140
you realize the difference between
porn then and now. So much more hair,

635
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,090
so much more here. So much more hand.
And it was like, they were like,

636
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,210
they were like all sexy.
The real boob look back then,

637
00:37:06,211 --> 00:37:10,950
it was one of my favorite things because
they all had really nice big natural

638
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,350
boob, kind of natural boom. They all
kind of like hung a little, oh yeah,

639
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,110
they did that. It was nice. Like
Ginger Lynn had small boobs,

640
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,780
but they were really nice. They
weren't small. They were like,

641
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,960
I would say ginger's mom, like
medium and small, but yeah,

642
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,920
and it seems like bigger areolas were
more popular back then or lately.

643
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:32,370
Maybe girls area let's have been shrinking
for some reason. Maybe it's nature.

644
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,820
Cell phones could be
radiation that kills the bees.

645
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:41,880
It's true. It's just strange watching
like we were talking about, uh,

646
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:46,881
whether or not society has changed or
whether or not people have just more

647
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,230
access to it now.
We see it more because of Twitter,

648
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:50,550
but people always been fucked up.

649
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,510
And I say that porn is probably the best
evidence that society has gotten more

650
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:59,511
fucked up because there was like
very little dark porn back then.

651
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,690
There wasn't even, there wasn't
even any slapping, you know,

652
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,040
there's no dick slapping and there was no,

653
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,060
no pulling in the hair and shooting
loads up their nose and stuff like that.

654
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,310
Like they're doing,
they do Mike mean anger shit now you know,

655
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,740
and there's,

656
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:19,770
there's something hot about slobber all
over your face and streaked Mascara and

657
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,440
asa, Asa, Akira man, I heard
latest DVD is one of my favorites.

658
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:28,560
I forget the guy. I think his name
is Rocco or something like that.

659
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,190
Fucking just fucking man,
like dragging her by the hair.

660
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:37,690
She's just gagging and he's just
fucking, oh, and Nacho. Nacho. Nacho.

661
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:42,520
That dude's awesome.
I don't think I have any,

662
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,450
I don't give a shit about porn guys
much like I don't ever look out for one,

663
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:51,360
but that every time I see him
in a movie, he's cool. He's,

664
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:54,850
he's a, he's a cool ass. Be Very
violent with the girls. Great.

665
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,210
I'm dragging around with their hair.
It doesn't seem to be a nice thing to do.

666
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,950
Somebody that you want to fuck. Do you
think some girls like that? I didn't.

667
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:05,980
I never thought so, but yeah. Wow.
They definitely did it. Oh No.

668
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,820
Girls like being choked.
Yeah. Veronica slap me.

669
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,280
I slapper. Yeah. She always like slap me
in the face. I'm like, no, don't say that.

670
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:20,220
Because then you put it on line. You're
fucking, she does punish videos. Yeah,

671
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,870
that's dark dude.
I would be like,

672
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,620
I don't want to connect me beating
the fuck out of you with something.

673
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,480
The sexual. That just seems like a bad
idea. I had a girl that wanted to rape me.

674
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,190
She wanted me to rape her.
Whether

675
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,880
she would tell me she
would want to wait me too,

676
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:39,730
but she would actually tell me
that she wants me to rainbow. Yeah,

677
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:41,110
she wants to fight me off.
I'm like,

678
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,320
that's not something you want
to connect with sexuality with.

679
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,850
My sister always wanted me to do that.
Why Jesus Brian,

680
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,760
don't you think that would that be awful
mean taboo subject because rape itself

681
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,140
obviously is a deplorable act,

682
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,550
but the fact remains that there are girls
that get turned on by that deplorable

683
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:07,240
act.

684
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,170
There's girls that have these fantasies
of getting like finding themselves in

685
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:14,890
the wrong place and the wrong
time and a fucking pack.

686
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:19,420
A wild thugs come out with 14 inch Cox
and just forced her to suck their dicks

687
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:21,010
while one guy bangs or from behind.

688
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,670
There's girls who have fantasies
like they're really scared,

689
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,120
but that would really be excited and they
probably fingered themselves thinking

690
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,440
about that.
And you know,

691
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:32,680
they don't ever risked their actual
physical wellbeing in life by putting

692
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,660
themselves in a situation
where that could happen.

693
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,050
But the fact is they
could do that at any time.

694
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,640
Girls can just drive around to a group
of guys at any time and get out and go,

695
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,790
hey boys, what's going on? Is that
talking about this and the guys,

696
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:51,190
come on over here. You want to
suck my cock? Yeah, I'd love to.

697
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:55,250
It's not hard for a girl to find a
cocktail she shouldn't talk about.

698
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,090
Cause once they figured that shit out,
what do mean anyone's? I figure it out.

699
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,510
They're just going to wander around you.
You don't think they know it already.

700
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,960
Please do. Girls know it already. You
don't think they know the routine?

701
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:09,400
They know it. Of course. Massive
knowledge of their power. Women,

702
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:12,850
women have power like a superhero,
a hot girl,

703
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:17,260
hot girl in a bikini or a hot girl and
a mini skirt walking through a mall.

704
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,800
Every guy stops. And you
just immediately go, oh,

705
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:23,500
there is one there because why?

706
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,340
Because you know that if you are alone
naked with her and she was blowing you,

707
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,710
it would be out standing.

708
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,140
It'd be such a great feeling
to have that face suck

709
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,810
in your costs. 75% chance, right?
75% chance that that or that,

710
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:43,430
that girl does not have to give a good
blow job. No, that's not true at all.

711
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,660
I think more girls suck.

712
00:41:45,661 --> 00:41:48,810
I blow jobs that are good at
it by a large one mark mark,

713
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,150
you do in the wrong girl son. It's
very rare that you find a bad blow job.

714
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,510
It's hard to find a bad blow
job if a girl was enthusiastic.

715
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,230
If a girl's enthusiastic, just like
if you're enthusiastic about her,

716
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:03,020
if you're both turned on,
she's going to give you good head,

717
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,270
like you're going to eat her pussy. Good.
Like when you eat a girl's pussy. Dot.

718
00:42:06,271 --> 00:42:10,700
Are you trying to like, you want her to
feel as good as you can make her feet,

719
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:12,230
right?
What is the a hundred percent goal?

720
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,100
That's a woman's goal too and she's
blowing you. You just know. But I think I,

721
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,550
maybe I'm more sensitive
to teeth or something.

722
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,500
Maybe just getting some lazy bitches
that are chewing on your dick

723
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:29,240
suck. Have you ever had a
girl data byte it? Yeah. No,

724
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,890
not like mad at me or anything. No.
No. I always feel like, you know,

725
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:35,360
like especially back in the day
when you did a lot drugs and stuff,

726
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,260
I was thought this girl's or we're just
going to snap out of it and what they're

727
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:43,490
doing and just start by Mescalin
flashback and chomp down on your ball bag.

728
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,780
Ah, some guy a recently got
bid on the balls by, uh,

729
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,020
I think it was a cop got bid on
the balls by a, by a convict.

730
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,680
God wouldn't let go of his balls
either as biting him through the pants.

731
00:42:57,681 --> 00:43:02,320
Like they had the guy like nice
job. Yeah. Think of that shit.

732
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,230
That shit's happening,
man. Ouchy bath salts.

733
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,750
We're all going to be
bitten the ball soon. Yeah.

734
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,300
Does other people that have done
bath salts and say it's no big deal.

735
00:43:11,301 --> 00:43:14,690
I have a feeling that bath salts
or a bunch of different fucking,

736
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,250
or it's just how your body reacts to pass.
So it's just like any other drug,

737
00:43:18,251 --> 00:43:19,320
you know?
It's just like fucking,

738
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,840
you have somebody that's borderline
skitzo and they fucking smoke weed.

739
00:43:22,841 --> 00:43:24,700
That person becomes fucking psychotic.

740
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,180
Hmm. That's a real good point.
It's so true. People don't know.

741
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,200
You know when people say, hey man, should
I do mushrooms? It's, I don't know you.

742
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,290
What the fuck are you crazy?
I would never tell anybody to do anything.

743
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:39,230
Although I tell everybody they
should do mushrooms drink.

744
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,730
But what I say everybody,
I don't mean everybody.

745
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,250
I just mean everybody's not fucked up.
Right.

746
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:49,090
If you're barely holding onto reality,
I don't recommend psychedelic drugs.

747
00:43:49,091 --> 00:43:53,050
I don't recommend alcohol for sure.
I don't recommend anything.

748
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:56,890
But get your shit together. You know,
go to a doctor, find out what's wrong,

749
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,500
you know, whatever. Whatever you
got to do, get your shit together.

750
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:01,510
That's more important than psychedelics

751
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:06,490
did. That fucking cat helicopter shit
that everyone's been fucking flooding the

752
00:44:06,491 --> 00:44:09,940
tweets with. And if you haven't heard
about explain it to all the folks at home.

753
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:14,110
Somebody's cat died.
And to remember him,

754
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,180
he liked to make helicopters
or something like that.

755
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,140
And so he turned his cat into
a whole copter. He stuffed
it and it made like his,

756
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,020
Paul's like spread out kind of like,

757
00:44:23,021 --> 00:44:27,100
you know that's like doing a snowman in
the snow and each one of them had like a

758
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:31,260
helicopter fan on it. And then so he
sits there and flies is dead cat around.

759
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:36,430
And at first I watched it and I was
horrified and then I was like this is the

760
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:39,570
coolest thing in the whole entire road.
I hope this catches on.

761
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:43,230
Cause I could just imagine a bunch of
cats, helicopters flying in the sky.

762
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:46,590
And that would be cool if it became
popular cause then I'll kite is going to

763
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:50,280
attack. But if there was cats
everywhere in the sky at all times,

764
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:53,310
it could be going down sunset and
there's everyone had their old dead cats.

765
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,420
Like that'd be cool. That'd be tons of
cats everywhere. This really is crazy.

766
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,550
But then I was thinking,
what if it crashes?

767
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,120
And then it's like fucking knows falls
off because it hits concrete or something.

768
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:06,900
That would be disturbing now I now I think
it's creepy. Well you just got a knee,

769
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:10,500
put a helmet on him.
You see his little fucking cat face.

770
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:11,910
That's the funniest face ever.

771
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,870
A large plexiglass dome over his head.

772
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:18,210
Like he's a space cat or even better.

773
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,360
No, I'm in a space suit is his
head. It's actually pretty cool.

774
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,080
Or actually get the clear film
companies that did the IPAD,

775
00:45:27,081 --> 00:45:29,510
like clear films to
make like a clear armor,

776
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,230
like have an arm or for your cat where
it's just like some kind of crystallized

777
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:33,860
shit.

778
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,840
That's awesome.
That is awesome.

779
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:41,350
Did you hear that there's another drone
attack that killed some top al Qaeda

780
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:42,010
Guy?

781
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:46,510
Yeah. Wasn't that Persian? Is it
purple or was it a Siamese cat?

782
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,830
Can you imagine if the army starts really
using cat cat weapon? That's awesome.

783
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,060
Can you imagine if like there was a
country where like they used flying pigs

784
00:45:58,061 --> 00:46:02,610
because like Muslims would be terrified
of house Higgs flying through the air

785
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:04,680
and cows. If you go to
war with India, India,

786
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:10,860
yeah, they, they killed some dude
in Pakistan. That's what it is.

787
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,830
That's kind of fucked up man.
That we're not really in Pakistan,

788
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,800
but Pakistan is the place where we
try out all of our newest shit. Right?

789
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:19,890
Cause we can get away with it.

790
00:46:19,891 --> 00:46:23,700
We must have some sort of a weird deal
with the government or the government

791
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:28,320
won't say anything. We're, we're sending
spaceships into their air. I mean,

792
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:31,320
we're sending like some science fiction
things that were controlling from

793
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:34,510
halfway around the world with
a remote control and they're,

794
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,630
they're launching missiles.
I mean,

795
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:40,440
it's really crazy that they're
allowed to do that. I, you know, look,

796
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:44,850
I'm 100% in support and get rid of bad
guys and taking all the terrorists out

797
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:47,490
and all that happy horse shit.
The legit terrorists.

798
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,030
But this is a crazy little
precedent to set the year,

799
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:55,140
allowing space ships to fly
around in launch missiles.

800
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:58,890
Hell fire, bunker buster fucking
missiles at these people.

801
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,880
That's what they're called.
Hell fire. They'll dig.

802
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,920
They're allowed to spray rockets from
the sky and blow you out of the room out

803
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:10,950
of the road. You just wandering along.
You don't even know they're there.

804
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:15,000
They're like a mile away in a rocket
comes in fucking you would disappear.

805
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,600
That's amazing.
Yeah.

806
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:19,770
It's amazing that that's how we're
doing more right now in Pakistan.

807
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:23,550
That's the peak of the technological war
right now is going on right there and

808
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:28,290
very few people are even aware of it.
You know, you just hear drone attack.

809
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:33,190
That's what you hear, you know on on
the, on the radio or drone attack on CNN,

810
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:36,160
but you don't really stop and think
about what the fuck that means.

811
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,400
There's a remote controlled flying object
that launches missiles at people and

812
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:46,660
they're watching a camera through it
halfway around the world pressing buttons

813
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:50,290
and launching these things. It's
incredible. The technology is just,

814
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:54,760
it's amazing what they can do now. It
doesn't. That one that crashed and I ran,

815
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,210
it wasn't, there was another moment
where life feels like a fake movie.

816
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,300
Where would they,
they'd fucking captured our shit.

817
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:04,540
And Obama goes to the news and talks
about it. Well we've asked for it back.

818
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,190
That's what he said. We've
asked for it back. Hey,

819
00:48:09,191 --> 00:48:12,130
you know the thing that we were flying
around and we might have just shot

820
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:16,420
rockets at you from the sky? Yeah.
Can you give that to us? Cause so a,

821
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:21,070
we could do that again. It's weird
like what they asked for it back.

822
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,810
Could you imagine if I ran,

823
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:25,570
had some shit flying around over
here and taking pictures of us.

824
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,500
Something that's got the capability
of shooting missiles. That's crazy.

825
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,980
But it didn't have any missiles on it
though, right? No, that one didn't.

826
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,800
I could say that.
One of my random,

827
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,120
just how far they can
go when I have a bet.

828
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,390
Some of them are solar powered,
right?

829
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:45,070
Probably they must have at least something
solar. Have you seen that Fisker?

830
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:49,990
The new solar powered automobile?
It's a, it's, it's not solar powered.

831
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,700
Only partially solar powered. The, I'm
like stereo and things along those lines.

832
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,110
The roof is a series of solar
panels. Yes. I have seen that.

833
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,280
It's fucking beautiful.
Car Mat. Take a look up.

834
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:08,100
It's like they finally got it right
because these a shitty ass fucking Prius's

835
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:10,720
and these disgusting things.
Oh, by the way, number nine,

836
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:12,400
ninth person I've ever seen.

837
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:15,730
Throw a fucking cigarette out
the the window of their Prius.

838
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,340
You twats I'm watching all you hypocrite.
Cons.

839
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,500
It's just such a,
I know some people do it for economy.

840
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:25,030
I understand that it's not just,

841
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:28,250
but I like to think that they're green
and they're just hypocrites. Yeah. I mean,

842
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,020
I would buy wine.

843
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,620
It would just be because I don't feel
like spending $90 every time I filled my

844
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:37,480
tank up. Yeah. Well this is, um,
this is a beautiful fucking car, man.

845
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:41,460
This Fisker look at this thing, man.
Take a peek at that. Look at that shit.

846
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,400
It's amazing. Let's say recalls.
Yup. They recalled, recalled,

847
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,650
they already recalled them.
There was a fire prone hose clamp.

848
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:55,780
This was, uh, this was a while
ago. Oh no, it wasn't. It's today.

849
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:01,360
That's crazy. Recall realized
partly cloudy day stranded,

850
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,930
but of the January 5th is June 5th earth.
Yeah.

851
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,440
It's a fucking beautiful car though.
It's theirs so slow though.

852
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,030
I'm just so used to the the,
the pap of a car that's quick,

853
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:18,520
you know. No, no, no. I don't drive like
an Asshole, but I do love the engineering,

854
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,780
the responsiveness of like a
well engineered car. Pirate dice.

855
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:26,250
Was that a comedy store last night
and he can't, he's going pirate now.

856
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,330
He's got guys clay, where's a pirate
patch to get discounts at stores.

857
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:34,340
He is what the people say.
He says because he says he's handicapped.

858
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,120
He's I vet or,

859
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,430
and if they don't have a vet that then
he goes a senior discount is what he's

860
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:43,130
been telling people something.
I think that's what he's saying.

861
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,220
Or no handicap discount
and that seems hilarious.

862
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:51,230
Was his idea only take 10 shirts
and then lift the building begin.

863
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,480
But he had his car there. He had a, uh,
what's the charge or not to charge her,

864
00:50:56,481 --> 00:51:00,860
but what's challenger Challenger?
I think it was a Buick or a dodge.

865
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:04,800
Dodge Buick hit me. His
car was amazing, man.

866
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:07,740
It made me want to get well yeah,
those are sick. How much are those?

867
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:13,550
I think fully loaded. They're like 40
grand. Oh Wow. And they're beautiful.

868
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:17,600
That shape is just so iconic. The
challenge or shape, it's just like,

869
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,880
you know what it's like.
It's like my old Barracuda,

870
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,710
but it's not going to leave you stranded
every couple days. Those old cars,

871
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:27,110
man,
they look so bad ass,

872
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:30,990
but there does the design
involved in them. Like there's,

873
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:35,870
it's so crude like drum brakes.
There's so crude.

874
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,490
Like he hit the brakes,
like barely stopped.

875
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:45,200
The car takes forever.
Now they have cars like the new Porsche,

876
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,920
the nine nine one which is the,

877
00:51:46,921 --> 00:51:51,410
the new nine 11 the new Porsche nine
11 that just came out can stop from,

878
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,570
I think it's 60 miles an hour to a hundred
to zero in less than a hundred feet.

879
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,840
That's like crazy.
They do it 96 feet.

880
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,970
The new corvette can do that too now.

881
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:08,020
Less than a hundred feet from sixties
the old days that she would take you a

882
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,950
mile, it was 60 miles out,
not a mile, but you locked up.

883
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,350
It takes a long ass time to stop the car.

884
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:19,880
Now it's antilock brakes and
traction control and all the,

885
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:24,110
the new shit that you can do now,
the old cars or retarded,

886
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:28,280
they're just useless to have unless you're
just a hobbyist who love the idea of

887
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:31,850
like this old mechanical thing that
you were switching the gears and all.

888
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:33,530
There's a lot of people
that really do enjoy that.

889
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:38,830
But what the challenge has done is they've
gotten like most of that old look and

890
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:42,860
put it into a new car. You
know, they figured out,

891
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:46,790
they figured out how to keep that shape.
It's not a good shape for handling.

892
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:50,720
It's terrible. Like the design is
not, it's not smart. And that's what,

893
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:52,220
it's like a big heavy car too.

894
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:55,040
So like they're not that good
around corners and shit like that.

895
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:59,720
Not like a corvette or not current.
It's designed to do that. But you know,

896
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,800
what do you do for regular
driving? They're great. Gabri
Aubrey has one of those.

897
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,030
Yeah,
so it was Tom Green.

898
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,570
I was either thinking about selling my
car because my car gets horrible gas

899
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:11,150
mileage and getting something like
that cause I'm about to pay off my car.

900
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:14,510
Finally and I'm like, Oh, I finally
on this piece of shit, it's not pizza.

901
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:15,860
It's a great car,
but uh,

902
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:20,060
and get something like that or
just get a really shitty small car,

903
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:23,120
like something like one of those little
baby fiats or whether it's, you know,

904
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:27,150
like the teeny little cheap cars.
Dude, you wanted to get a Mustang. Um,

905
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,880
if you want to trade your forward in
because maybe Ford would give you a good

906
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:33,090
deal. I never thought about
[inaudible] 49 Ford. Yeah, the Mustang.

907
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:37,980
The boss 302 is not expensive.
It's not expensive at all.

908
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,250
Yeah. The new, the new
Mustang boss three Oh two,

909
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:45,660
I think is like 35,000
bucks and they fucking fly.

910
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,140
And the new Mustang Gt,
just the GT,

911
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:52,590
the GT is a fucking really good car man.

912
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,490
The GT is,
um,

913
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:01,370
400 plus horsepower just for the
Mustang Gt. And it's, you know,

914
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:06,150
it's a little bit crude and it's a
design. It has a live axle, which is,

915
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,790
it means the backend sort of
bumps around a little bit,

916
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:12,420
but it's a really fun car to drive.
Well, why would they do that?

917
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:16,770
Why would they do what? Live action.
It helps. It helps drag racing.

918
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,340
It helps keep the power down. They,
they, I mean, it's not that bad.

919
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:25,410
You know what it is, is it's an older
way of designing suspensions, but they,

920
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:29,340
uh, they made the best out of it.
It handles well, you know, I mean,

921
00:54:29,341 --> 00:54:33,780
it doesn't handle as good as a card
with independent rear suspension,

922
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,530
but mean the Mustang, uh, three
Oh two, the boss three two,

923
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:42,240
it lapse a race tracks faster than
that already are eight. You know,

924
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:46,770
that Audi, a space looking car that a
Everlast house. You know, that thing,

925
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,330
this, uh, this bus, um,

926
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,310
the Laguna Seca boss
Mustang can lap, um, uh,

927
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:58,190
race tracks quicker than that, which is
pretty amazing. Yeah. And it's, uh, it's,

928
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,520
they only have, uh, I think it's
only 400 and something horsepower.

929
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:06,450
Yeah. But it's a, uh, it's a dope car.

930
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,130
It's like one of the best
bargain cars. I think it's, um,

931
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:16,160
you know, if you like, if you wanted to
get a bargain for like performance, it's,

932
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,490
you can only go American.

933
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,980
There's no real bargains in as far as
like foreign cars for performance. Yeah.

934
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:27,150
Like American cars. Like these are not bad
in a hundred days on days. What the, um,

935
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:31,110
the little sports car thing, the APP, but
you don't get that kind of performance.

936
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:35,340
You don't get 400 plus horsepower like
you getting the Mustang, you know, that's,

937
00:55:35,341 --> 00:55:38,770
uh, that's just not going
to get that. This is not,

938
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:41,730
you're not gonna get that kind
of, that kind of oomph. You know?

939
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:46,620
It's like if you want a fast
car that's a foreign car,

940
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:49,920
there's a few Japanese cars are pretty
quick, you know, like the three,

941
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:53,910
seven disease pretty quick, but they
can't fuck with like this most dying.

942
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,860
But then you've got to get to like
big money, like, like the Nissan Gtr,

943
00:55:58,861 --> 00:56:00,870
which is like $100,000,

944
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,280
then then shit gets crazy because
then the Japanese have one of the best

945
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:08,730
production cars, one of the fastest,
best handling cars in the world.

946
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,133
But you have to,

947
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:14,490
you have to get right to there before
you get that kind of performance to

948
00:56:14,491 --> 00:56:18,330
universal studios for my first time the
other day. And did you really? Yeah.

949
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,100
And uh, it's funny because I
went on the first one I went on,

950
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:24,250
it was the terminator two ride,
which uh, you know, it's been

951
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:28,300
a while since that movie
came out. Right. And I never,

952
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,550
I almost freaked out because
they make you get in this,

953
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:32,620
have you been on that right before?
No.

954
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,620
They make you get in this huge room
and like I have no idea what if this is

955
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:37,950
going.
Yeah,

956
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:41,950
I did go in that and then you're sitting
there with all these people like,

957
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,200
and then the door's shut and
you're just like, all right,

958
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,800
this is where the gas comes out and we
all get murdered or something, you know,

959
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,850
like we couldn't leave.

960
00:56:48,851 --> 00:56:52,840
And it's something that was just as bad
actor acting job where like this lady

961
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:55,630
comes out and Ugh, hi,
welcome to whatever, you know,

962
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:58,120
we are here in the future anyways,

963
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,380
all her ship or computers behind her,
since the ride is so old,

964
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,810
like we used to look like it
was supposed to be the future,

965
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,320
but now it looks really sad and
depressing like a garage sale,

966
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,360
like monitoring and you know what I mean?

967
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,250
And it's totally outdated and you don't,
and then she was like,

968
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:16,950
before we go into the next room, I want
you to look at this. And they like,

969
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,260
it's a video that I'm guessing when
the movie came out, which was what,

970
00:57:20,261 --> 00:57:22,310
93 or something something.
Yeah,

971
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:25,480
that and that all these things
seemed really futuristic,

972
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:30,250
but now half the shit that they showed
you could do on your iPhone and it was so

973
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:30,581
weird.

974
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:34,360
Like imagine in the future
your grandmother is far
away and you want to talk to

975
00:57:34,361 --> 00:57:37,990
her. How about talking to her on your
wall? You know, and you're like, yeah,

976
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:41,530
I could do that in my phone now.
You know, everything. It was like,

977
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:46,650
imagine like being able to like control
like a doctor couldn't sit somewhere

978
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:50,650
else and control an operation far away.
You can do that now.

979
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:53,740
You know doctors are doing
that now and it's weird.

980
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:58,480
Like all this shit was so perfect.
Do Doctors do remote control operations?

981
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,690
Yeah, I think uh, I think it's
at the very beginning stages.

982
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:05,230
But there has been a successful operations
where they've done that from remote

983
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,670
relic locations and stuff like that
using advanced computers and robots.

984
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,220
And that scares the shit out of me.
That's scary.

985
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:16,810
So I want to open you up and
remote control operating on.

986
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:21,610
So then I was really scared though because
I was like really figuring out how,

987
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,240
you know, shitty this ride was,
I'm like damn this, you know,

988
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:26,260
why does it universal have this?

989
00:58:26,261 --> 00:58:30,010
But then you go into the next room and
you watch this really old three d movie

990
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:33,520
in a three d was really
good, you know, for his age.

991
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:38,350
And then there's this one point where
there's lots of live actors mixed in like,

992
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,060
like in the theater.
So like,

993
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,040
like this guy will come out like
a motorcycle and then like, uh,

994
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,190
he had like a shotgun and he'll shoot
somebody like a real, like, like,

995
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,720
like back like holy shit that you could
hear it, it sounded like a gunshot and,

996
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,640
and then you will like disappear off
the stage and it looks like it goes back

997
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:57,850
into the three d movie, Shit like
that. So it was kind of interesting.

998
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,750
And then they have two more,
three d screens that go around you.

999
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,330
And this is an old right? So
everyone's probably like, yeah dude,

1000
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,230
welcome to 93 but the three d
was coming out at all sides.

1001
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,880
It was really awesome.

1002
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:13,630
And I guess there's a new transformers
ride there that just takes that to the

1003
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:17,880
whole next level. And so I, I'm there
a Spiderman one that did that too.

1004
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:20,920
I don't know. It was down in Orlando,
I think that's in Orlando. I don't.

1005
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,010
And then there

1006
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,920
was the Simpsons ride where you,

1007
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,650
it was a virtual roller
coaster where you know,

1008
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,920
it's one of the things where the whole
thing moves but you go into this like

1009
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:35,420
fucking dome where the whole dome
is a movie and it's really trippy.

1010
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:39,380
If I want to do shrimps and did that
cause I think I'll die and go to heaven

1011
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:41,630
because it,
you go into this huge room,

1012
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:45,320
you're like holy shit that and then
you feel like you're going through this

1013
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:47,480
roller coaster.
There's parts where that Maggie,

1014
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:52,610
a huge Maggie would like try to grab your
roller coaster and the spray like baby

1015
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:54,050
powder smell.

1016
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:58,160
So you start smelling baby powder
and you're like it's fucking bad ass.

1017
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:01,470
What I always scary like for
a like a little kid cause I'd

1018
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:03,950
fuck,

1019
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:07,370
you know I was scared but I was thinking
of other things cause I was like holy

1020
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:11,200
Shit. Is this one of those elevator drop
rides where you drop? Because I thought,

1021
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,010
I thought I was going to freak out.

1022
01:00:13,011 --> 01:00:15,210
This is weird how they
can pull that effect off.

1023
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:18,500
We're just showing you a screen and
then moving things around works.

1024
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:22,070
And I wasn't even stoned. If I was
stoned, I would fucking be you.

1025
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,970
We should go sometime, man. I've got a
season pass now. It's, it's only $20 more.

1026
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:29,360
What was the big one that they had?
They had the one famous one.

1027
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:33,830
There was a Jurassic Park. They
have Jurassic Park I think. Wait,

1028
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:37,970
did they have drastic no,
I parked at Jurassic Park.
Yes. They must have had you.

1029
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,880
Yeah. I feel like there's a
drastic park ride. Um, no,

1030
01:00:40,881 --> 01:00:44,180
but they have it a water waterworld one's
still there, which was fucking creepy.

1031
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:49,010
Who wants to see a at universal the,
that is the Jurassic Park one.

1032
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:52,310
There's a water scene in it.
You're in like a log? No,

1033
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:56,530
the movie water road movie.
Waterworld yeah,

1034
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:59,600
the fuck I was still there.
You know they have a King Kong one.

1035
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:03,770
That's the one in the jaws one is the
one that you can cause pretty new. Uh Oh.

1036
01:01:03,771 --> 01:01:07,790
Is it within the last couple
of years they redid it. Yeah.

1037
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:11,380
It's the new King Kong from like
four years ago or five years ago.

1038
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:14,150
I didn't go to it and I only
went to those two because it was,

1039
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:15,470
I went on a Sunday.

1040
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:18,620
How many king kongs or they've
been there was the original one,

1041
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,850
which is fucking awesome to watch today.
You ever watched it today?

1042
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:27,110
The original one? Yeah, the one
in 1984 was my favorite one.

1043
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:31,490
I think it was 1984. That was my favorite
one. That's the Dino de la Renta Swan.

1044
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,400
Jessica Lange. Yeah. I like
that one. Back in the day.

1045
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:39,140
I haven't seen him since that was trip
and Jessica Lange played, uh, uh, abroad.

1046
01:01:39,141 --> 01:01:43,220
That was just ditzy enough to fall in
love with a fucking giant gorilla. Right.

1047
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,120
You know,
she was just ditzy enough where,

1048
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:50,390
where you could buy it
and believe it this a,

1049
01:01:50,391 --> 01:01:53,930
the latest one was fucking incredible man.
The latest one,

1050
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,040
when you go back and you see like the,
the newest King Kong,

1051
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,350
compare it to the oldest King
Kong, the oldest one is like, wow,

1052
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,990
what a window into a different
world like you ever see. Um,

1053
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,330
is it called metropolis? That
old, really old Scifi movie.

1054
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,160
Wow. It's incredible what they
thought the future was style. Yeah.

1055
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,370
Maybe it was so amazing.
Well, even like the old alien,

1056
01:02:16,371 --> 01:02:18,860
like I'm fucking slick prometheus's
coming out this weekend.

1057
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,690
But if you watch the original alien,

1058
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:23,720
you know when they were
on that spaceship one,

1059
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:26,810
a bunch of wack ass fucking
fake equipment they had,

1060
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:30,690
everything was all lights and shit and,
and the monitors,

1061
01:02:30,691 --> 01:02:35,280
these shitty little green tint monitors
because essentially this is before the

1062
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,720
user interface,

1063
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:41,310
the graphic user interface that
would we think of as computers today.

1064
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:45,090
Everybody thinks of them a Mac
or a PC and clicking on things.

1065
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,630
There was no clicking on anything back
then when people don't understand is the

1066
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:53,100
first computers. When when the movie
alien came out, they were like,

1067
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:55,740
it was all just like
green print on a screen.

1068
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:00,510
You weren't downloading anything bitch,
you know, it was like 1979 or something.

1069
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:02,040
Right.
There was no downloading.

1070
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,790
There were just these weird things
that sat around and laboratories.

1071
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,400
So they never predicted,
you know,

1072
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:11,970
like not even remotely what
the future was going to hold.

1073
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
They didn't see that even they
didn't see anything common.

1074
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,620
They didn't even see a little,

1075
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:20,340
it's kind of fucking crazy when you stop
and think about what a big difference

1076
01:03:20,341 --> 01:03:22,800
the graphic unit user interfaces played,

1077
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:26,960
the ability to click on things and
just when you look at a smartphone,

1078
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,000
like I was looking at
that big giant ass note.

1079
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:35,490
I've got a note anyway. New iPhone. Yeah.
I don't think seem to need a new iPhone.

1080
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,400
No,
it's like it's pretty much the same,

1081
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:43,620
but the whole thing's almost all screen
real. Yeah. But it is not bigger.

1082
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,070
Um, no, but the screen is like,
if you look at your iPhone now,

1083
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:48,930
it doesn't take a path even,
you know like what,

1084
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:53,430
75% of the fund now it's most of the
phones all like from wall to wall up and

1085
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:55,520
down. That's going to mean I don't, no,

1086
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:59,820
I mean the note is cool because
it's a small tablet and I think,

1087
01:03:59,821 --> 01:04:02,630
I'm pretty sure my money's is all on that.

1088
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,320
Apple is releasing a smaller version of
the IPAD that will kind of compete with

1089
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:11,100
the note cause they're going to use it
also as a remote control for their new TV.

1090
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:15,630
That will come out soon.
But so that that will take over that.

1091
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:19,050
But I don't think the note as it phone is,
I think it's the dumbest thing ever.

1092
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:22,180
Like I saw this person use it and have
you ever seen them like hold it up to

1093
01:04:22,181 --> 01:04:24,700
their head. It looks like they're
going to break their hand,

1094
01:04:24,701 --> 01:04:28,990
can watch the tumors grow in their
brain as they're holding it up to them.

1095
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:34,290
The fucking thing is enormous but a, it
looks beautiful though, man. It's fucking,

1096
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,110
I got this new iPad but a little bit the
latest one with the Verizon service on

1097
01:04:40,111 --> 01:04:44,970
it. That makes a huge difference cause
it's my first iPad with the service on it.

1098
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:49,971
But the hot spot feature is faster than
my high speed business class Internet at

1099
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:53,460
that squad.
That's incredible.

1100
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:56,700
But you only get to use a little bit
of it before they fuck you in the end.

1101
01:04:56,701 --> 01:05:00,460
You know what, you would think that.
But I used it pretty hardcore and you,

1102
01:05:00,461 --> 01:05:03,000
you don't really know unless
you're downloading movies.

1103
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,210
One movie and I got an email for one,
that's the one thing.

1104
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,300
Everything else that's ridiculous.

1105
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:12,810
If you have an iPad and you download
one movie and they're like, oh,

1106
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:15,480
you're fucked. Like what do you mean
I'm fucked? That's the whole thing.

1107
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,490
Because if everyone downloaded
one movie all this time,

1108
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,870
then there would be there. There's not
that much internet. They need us fix that.

1109
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:27,100
It's ridiculous. That's you use
when you use mobile internet,

1110
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:29,530
it's offensive how much it costs.

1111
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:33,250
You just need to expand Wifi so it hits
everybody. So we have wifi everywhere,

1112
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,130
not cell phone. Then everywhere,
every B's going to be dead.

1113
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:41,050
We can put fucking hot spots on all the
helicopter cats. You know, an Aspen,

1114
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:41,370
uh,

1115
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:45,700
it's a free Wifi for the whole city and
we'll just sit out there in the middle

1116
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:46,630
of nowhere and just fucking,

1117
01:05:46,631 --> 01:05:51,340
I bet this website's probably blocked
Joe rogan.net blog that I think they did

1118
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,200
block.
They've tried that in a lot of cities.

1119
01:05:53,201 --> 01:05:54,310
There's a lot of cities that do that.

1120
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:57,520
I was happy when I couldn't get to
my website from Dubai. I was like,

1121
01:05:57,521 --> 01:06:02,080
look at that bitch to teen choice
and dangerous for your Wifi.

1122
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:07,000
Yeah, there's um, there's
a good argument for that,

1123
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:09,580
but we don't know what the fuck is
happening with all these different wire

1124
01:06:09,581 --> 01:06:12,940
signals in the air. People didn't
say nothing. We're adapting to them,

1125
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,030
but there's something going on man.

1126
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,690
You're shrinking when you can send yeah,
no era hills.

1127
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:25,470
When you can send images and ones and
Zeros and you send them through the air

1128
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:30,900
and there's something else that picks
him up, receives them. That is a, that's,

1129
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,110
that's a crazy thing.

1130
01:06:32,111 --> 01:06:36,520
You're sending a signal and where
the signal is just in the air,

1131
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,480
it makes no sense. Is that
hitting me? Is it all over me?

1132
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,300
When someone's like Wifi
like crazy near you,

1133
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:48,310
are you getting pelted but like random
information as it makes its way from,

1134
01:06:48,461 --> 01:06:51,610
you know, from the Internet somehow
or another into their computer.

1135
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,280
Where's it going from? What's
the, is it passing through your,

1136
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,690
your dimension at all?

1137
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,560
I mean that is like some inter
dimensional fucking transportation of,

1138
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:01,970
I mean the physical object of a,

1139
01:07:01,971 --> 01:07:06,430
a piece of paper that you print and you
turn into a photograph that you just got

1140
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:07,264
from the Internet.

1141
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:12,510
I mean that is a way where something
physical just gets created and it wasn't

1142
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:17,140
there before it sent to you
and print it up like that is,

1143
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:18,880
that's a crazy thing,
man.

1144
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:21,820
It's really crazy that we can just do
that and we just don't even think about

1145
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:25,880
the fact there's television signals and
radio signals and internet signals and

1146
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:28,360
cell phone signals and all these
different signals going around.

1147
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:32,080
I don't know if they're affecting
us. I have no idea. It might.

1148
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:36,180
It might be that we would all feel a
little bit better if we didn't have them.

1149
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:37,660
It would be interesting.
Too Bad.

1150
01:07:37,661 --> 01:07:42,610
There's not really any place in their
world that you can probably not have.

1151
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,980
You have to go to complete zero signals.

1152
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,790
You'd have to go to somewhere that
really sucks like Alaska and Arctic or

1153
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:53,220
Antarctic. I mean, Alaska has cell
phones now I'm in an a and r get ups,

1154
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:55,360
but they would still probably
have some kind of signal.

1155
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:59,680
I would bet up there like at least
satellite or something. Maybe. Maybe.

1156
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:03,570
But satellite doesn't work everywhere.
It depends on where the satellites, uh,

1157
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:08,350
where you can receive it. Like I don't
think you can get XM radio in Hawaii.

1158
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:11,020
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure I um,

1159
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:14,170
I rented a car there once and I was
trying to listen to opie and Anthony,

1160
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:16,160
you know,
I went to the Cadillac and I was like

1161
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,740
looking for the satellite button.

1162
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,140
I pressed the satellite but it was nothing
going on. And I was like, you know,

1163
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:24,170
I don't think this shit works here.
I forgot to look it up though,

1164
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:28,700
but I don't think it does, but I'm not
sure. But you could always get it online,

1165
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:31,130
right. Which is what everybody's
going to do eventually anyway.

1166
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:33,070
You're going to have your peoples,
Gee,

1167
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:37,820
they're going to be selling phone or
rather radios that come with your car that

1168
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:41,900
connect to the internet, allow you to
download podcasts. If you have a Ford,

1169
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:45,590
you already have stitcher,
there's the new Fords,

1170
01:08:45,591 --> 01:08:50,540
have the stitcher APP Builtin
fucking mad man. I want that so bad.

1171
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:51,770
It's not.
That's the thing I hate.

1172
01:08:51,771 --> 01:08:56,600
I hope if if anyone that designs for these
Fords and these awesome new cars with

1173
01:08:56,601 --> 01:09:00,650
these new stairs, they have these apps
like stitcher, it's called sync for Ford.

1174
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:04,970
I have that, but there's no way to
upgrade it so I can get that shit.

1175
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:07,880
And when that's not fair, that's
what you mean. You go and you get it.

1176
01:09:07,881 --> 01:09:10,650
If you buy a new car, you
have to, they have the,

1177
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:14,830
it's been releasing her hardware and
series. So like you have like, you know,

1178
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,810
sink version one, two,
three and you can't like,

1179
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:21,050
it's not like an iPhone where like
you just old grade, you can upgrade.

1180
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:23,990
He can't do that. It really
makes me mad cause I, I can't,

1181
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:28,700
what am I going to tear out the
computer and you're in your car.

1182
01:09:28,701 --> 01:09:32,980
It should be interchangeable
and upgradable and pull
out and put a new one and

1183
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,550
they're just being cheap and they're not.

1184
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:38,480
They're telling nurse software developers
to move on to the next stuff and just

1185
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:42,410
abandoning. That's almost a leak should
be illegal because this car is that,

1186
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:45,170
my car is like a 2008
right now and it should,

1187
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:48,640
I haven't been able to update it
in three years, you know? So yeah,

1188
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:51,590
that is kind of fucked.
It's like a planned obsolescence mean.

1189
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,730
It really is the fact that it's,
the computer itself is an upgradable,

1190
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,760
how long do you expect people to
compete, you know, to keep that car?

1191
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:02,000
Because when you really think about
like all the, the different law,

1192
01:10:02,001 --> 01:10:03,770
was it Moore's law for computers?

1193
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:07,610
We stop and think about how quickly
computers become obsolete. Yeah.

1194
01:10:07,611 --> 01:10:11,420
Like metal having a classic corvette and
it had a black and white television in

1195
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:15,260
it. Yeah. Come on. What
the fuck? Well those,

1196
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:18,710
those knuckleheads though that like
those really classic cars that people,

1197
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:21,260
they want like classic hubcaps.
They want everything.

1198
01:10:21,261 --> 01:10:23,840
They want to time travel so they can
go back in high school and fucked her.

1199
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:27,380
Their 15 year old girlfriend. Oh, I see
him all the time and live in Burbank.

1200
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:30,110
That's like that big boy there every week.

1201
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:33,710
Fucking Leno or driving around in a
fucking fire truck waving at, you're like,

1202
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,800
nope, it's fucking Burbank's
the creepiest place effort.

1203
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,760
How weird is it j waves at everybody.
He's the nicest guy. Nicest guy ever.

1204
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:44,390
I seen him all the time. I'm like
walking the streets and waves of people.

1205
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:50,000
There was shitting all over him on the
radio today on Stern. Him and Joan Rivers.

1206
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,210
Oh yeah. I haven't heard the rest
of event generally was pretty funny.

1207
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:56,310
She's ruthless and she's
still fucking sling and he,

1208
01:10:56,570 --> 01:11:00,320
Joan Rivers is still going to war
with chicks. It's Hilarious, man.

1209
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:02,320
She's still struggling,
still fighting.

1210
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:06,380
She's like 79 something years old and
she still does stand up. You know,

1211
01:11:06,381 --> 01:11:08,470
she's still obsessed with work.
And have you ever met,

1212
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,350
have you ever met Jenny Mccarthy?
No. Yeah, I met her once. I met her.

1213
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:17,190
She was really nice and I stopped
doing a joke. What was it?

1214
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,340
I had a joke about,
uh,

1215
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:21,990
that I heard that Jenny McCarthy was going
to get her breast implants taken out.

1216
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:26,430
I said it's like tiger was chopping his
fucking arms off 10. That's not bad.

1217
01:11:26,431 --> 01:11:27,210
I would say,
I think you'll,

1218
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:30,150
why don't you put them back in
and make them big and no talking.

1219
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:35,490
She was on Howard Stern yesterday
and I had forgot about her, you know,

1220
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:38,070
cause he married Jim Carrey and you just
kind of like, right, she's dead to me.

1221
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:40,560
She married Jim Carey dated.

1222
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:45,330
Oh maybe I thought would make they married
but now they're separated and she was

1223
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:48,630
on Howard stern just talking about
how much, I mean she's a dirty girl.

1224
01:11:48,631 --> 01:11:50,400
And she was talking about
how much he masturbates,

1225
01:11:50,401 --> 01:11:53,670
how much she needs caulk that shit.
And then you go online, you're like,

1226
01:11:53,671 --> 01:11:56,400
what's she look like now? And you go to
our Twitter and you're like, Holy Shit,

1227
01:11:56,401 --> 01:11:58,020
she's still fucking hot as hell.

1228
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:02,490
And she's a Nympho and she lives in the
valley somewhere. So what are you saying,

1229
01:12:02,491 --> 01:12:05,280
dude? I need to find out what
she does. She wants a podcast.

1230
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:10,440
You could get with that. She
didn't McCarthy. You think
you could pull that off?

1231
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,650
I don't think so, but, but you never know.

1232
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:16,650
I don't think you could pull out half the
girls you've pulled off already. Right?

1233
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:21,900
True. Yeah. So why not her? Why not
just make a complete fantasy land?

1234
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,360
I want to just go full on Coen brothers
movie. Well, my mission was Lindsay Lohan.

1235
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:30,880
I thought that would be a bigger niche.
That's harder. I think it's please.

1236
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:34,630
I know guys are fucked her. I don't know
anybody's Fuck Jenny McCarthy. True.

1237
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:38,390
Jim Carey. I don't know
that guy. Do you know? No,

1238
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,520
I thought maybe you knew him from the
comedy store to know. I've never met him.

1239
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,670
He kind of stopped doing
standup along time ago.

1240
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:46,800
Some of those guys that's interesting.
Stand up,

1241
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:48,930
gets him to the dance and then
once they get to the dance,

1242
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:53,700
then they just become an actor. A
lot of dudes do that. What was, uh,

1243
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:54,570
did you,

1244
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:58,200
you ever do comedy store shit with Mark
Marin where you there at that same time

1245
01:12:58,201 --> 01:13:01,320
period as him or while he was there a long

1246
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,560
time ago. He was really young
and he was there with Kinison.

1247
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:06,820
Here's the door at Tennyson was alive.
Yeah.

1248
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,610
By the time I got into standup Kinison
only out a couple of years of life left.

1249
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,100
He died when I lived in New York.

1250
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,360
So I think it was probably 90,

1251
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:22,680
I want to say 92 that Kennison
died somewhere along those lines.

1252
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:25,230
So I still hadn't made
my way out to Elliot.

1253
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,620
And Marin got in deep with,
uh,

1254
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:31,060
with Kennesaw and when he was a kid,
you know,

1255
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:35,670
he was hanging around with them and
you know, he got, uh, got to see the,

1256
01:13:35,671 --> 01:13:39,570
the crazy dark coke years.
He got to see the chaos and all that shit.

1257
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,020
That story about, um, uh,

1258
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:46,560
about Kinison fathering Carla Bows,
wife's child.

1259
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:50,280
It's just so fucked up. So fucked up, man.

1260
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:52,830
He thought that it was his
daughter for the longest time.

1261
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,250
And then a DNA test reveals
it was Sam kinisons kid.

1262
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,640
He just think of his wife just laying
there and letting fat Sam climb on top of

1263
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:03,990
her and shoot his loads
inside of her and go,

1264
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:07,650
what kind of a fucking
friendship that they have?

1265
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:12,930
What kind of a world where they eliminated
what kind of decadence and depravity,

1266
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,790
what kind of Hollywood chaos was going on?

1267
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:21,130
Kennison was just banging his friend's
best friend opening act wife on the side

1268
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:23,050
and shooting loads into her.

1269
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,473
Well,

1270
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:29,560
it amazes me that dude was
got a lot of fucking pussy,

1271
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:32,500
like he was on the Howard stern calling
and hit like four girls in his bed.

1272
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:36,110
And you're amazed with that, but yeah.
You're not amazed when you get posted. No,

1273
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,790
I mean, well one at a time. I don't know.

1274
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:45,040
Sam Kinison was a big guy and I don't
know, I would not very attractive really.

1275
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:50,500
Like I never thought Kinison was, I guess
he was bigger than I thought he was.

1276
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:53,950
You know, back in the day I'll
never thought, oh, you mean big,

1277
01:14:53,951 --> 01:14:58,720
like physically or you mean no notoriety,
notoriety. It was huge. Yeah. See,

1278
01:14:58,721 --> 01:15:01,260
I didn't see that because I
was an end of the comedy scene.

1279
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,810
I only knew what I saw on TV and I always
thought the big guys were like Robin

1280
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:09,790
Williams and they were all big.
Kinison was huge. Dude. Kinison. Uh,

1281
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,550
I found out about Kennison and 86,

1282
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:16,140
and all my friends knew about kids and
everybody knew Kennison when I went to

1283
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:20,760
see a Kennison live, I brought a bunch
of my friends. Everybody was fucking,

1284
01:15:20,761 --> 01:15:25,740
it's to see Kennison live.
We suck. Tennyson live saw.

1285
01:15:25,741 --> 01:15:30,150
I saw Carlin live before ever did
stand up. I got to see Carlin live.

1286
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:35,040
I live. I said, I got to see Carlin
bomb. Really? Oh Hey. He ain't shit.

1287
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:39,730
It did not work out. It was
not, it wasn't good. He was,

1288
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:44,750
he got to this weird stage in his
life in like the late eighties.

1289
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,740
This was before I had done comedy and I
was with maybe I'd done like an open mic

1290
01:15:49,741 --> 01:15:54,220
night, maybe one or something like
that. But it was, uh, me and uh,

1291
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:59,240
my roommates and we were out in
New Hampshire and we saw him at,

1292
01:16:00,001 --> 01:16:04,350
there's a casino up there and they have a,
they do shows there.

1293
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:07,680
And that was the place where everybody
would go up from Boston during the summer.

1294
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:11,640
We'd all go up to, uh, to this
casino was at Hampton beach.

1295
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:17,280
I think that's it. I don't
remember. Anyway. Um, we were, uh,

1296
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:20,970
we were all there and George Carlin had
this weird thing that he was doing where

1297
01:16:20,971 --> 01:16:21,804
he would,

1298
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:26,220
he just have like a notepad
and it was just reading off,

1299
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,410
fuck this and fuck that.

1300
01:16:28,411 --> 01:16:32,850
It was like his whole and fuck Israel and
fuck this and fuck like the whole, uh,

1301
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:37,110
the whole bit was like, it wasn't
really working, you know, it was weird.

1302
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,940
It was like there was all this energy
and there was all this, you know,

1303
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:43,710
push into it. And it was fascinating
for me to watch because it was like,

1304
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:45,240
this is George Carlin.

1305
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:49,740
I mean George Carlin is a
like an all time great comic,

1306
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:54,420
but this at this point, his life,
it wasn't working out that night.

1307
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:57,180
I don't know what it was,
but my friend looked over me.

1308
01:16:57,181 --> 01:17:00,810
It was just kind of fucking
sucks. And I was like, wow,

1309
01:17:00,811 --> 01:17:02,700
I couldn't even say anything
cause I had dragged them there.

1310
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,750
They weren't Comedians,
you know,

1311
01:17:03,751 --> 01:17:08,190
I dragged them to go see George Carlin
and he was eating it. It was weird.

1312
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,950
And I,
you know,

1313
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:14,360
I stopped listening to him for like a year
or two and then I bought, he had like,

1314
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:19,220
um, x warning, a explicit lyrics
I think was one of the cds,

1315
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:23,510
which was great. And I was like, he got
it back. It was almost like, you know,

1316
01:17:23,511 --> 01:17:28,070
he just had a bad, see, he did so
much stand up. Everyone has a bad set.

1317
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:32,030
It wasn't just a bad set, it
was a bad, it was a bad set,

1318
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:36,230
like not that night, but set out the
way it was written. It was just, he,

1319
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,050
he went through a period of like,

1320
01:17:39,051 --> 01:17:43,040
I don't know how many decades or
he made a new hour every year.

1321
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,840
So because of that he
was so fucking prolific.

1322
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:51,440
He would essentially like
write a whole new monologue,

1323
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:53,900
a long monologue every year.

1324
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:58,220
And to do that and still have
something to say after all those years,

1325
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:01,160
you're going to hit some stumbling
blocks along the way. I mean,

1326
01:18:01,161 --> 01:18:04,880
you're going to hit some, you're going
to have some awkward moments. You know,

1327
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:05,960
like if you,
uh,

1328
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:09,950
if you go to see like Louis C k this is
very possible that Louise work on new

1329
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:13,400
shit right now. You know what I
mean? Like he's always got new shit.

1330
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:18,650
If you do that, it's so hard to
maintain the quality. It's so hard,

1331
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:23,390
you know, to every year a new
hour. What the fuck man? God Damn,

1332
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:28,900
you wonder how many you would have to
start doing things like specifically to

1333
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:29,700
write material

1334
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:33,520
kind a universal studios. Yeah,
exactly. Yeah, go to, you know,

1335
01:18:33,521 --> 01:18:36,750
you're going to go try to do it once a
week now just do stupid shit like that

1336
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:41,280
just to get material. It's kind of
cool cause it makes you do more things.

1337
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:44,470
It's a two edge sword because
you still enjoy it. You know?

1338
01:18:44,471 --> 01:18:46,630
It's like you're going to
do some cool shit. Like,

1339
01:18:46,631 --> 01:18:48,940
well what have you done that day?
You didn't like it

1340
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:53,570
done. Ah, fuck. What was
that recently? Uh, there was
something recently that I did.

1341
01:18:53,571 --> 01:18:57,110
I did. Oh well no, that was still
fine. What did that Black Strip club.

1342
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,900
But no,
I can't think of,

1343
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,700
there was something I did
recently that was really boring.

1344
01:19:01,701 --> 01:19:03,830
I can't even think of what it was.
But I remember thinking like,

1345
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:07,020
well that was kind, oh, doing uh,

1346
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:11,990
mushrooms and a shitty hotel
in Venice. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1347
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,400
That was horrible. That's not a good move.
I still got kind of material from it.

1348
01:19:16,401 --> 01:19:20,240
You kind of, I guess, what kind
of material did you go? Oh,

1349
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:24,380
it's just like on stuff. I haven't really
tried out too much, but, uh, you know,

1350
01:19:24,381 --> 01:19:27,820
like, you know, you can have bad
tell. Like, you can tell you kneel,

1351
01:19:27,821 --> 01:19:31,230
you're in a bad area where everywhere
you look there's evidence, you know,

1352
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:33,380
stuff like that, you
know, they're just like,

1353
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:37,010
all these tags I've kind of built
up and trying to make him do sets.

1354
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:40,610
But I don't know, things like
that. I, I've been doing more now,

1355
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,670
I've never done that. But usually once
a week I tried to do something crazy.

1356
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,900
Like I wanna go to magic castle. I wanted,
like, I've never been, I've never been,

1357
01:19:47,901 --> 01:19:50,090
but I want to go there and just get drunk.

1358
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:53,930
My friend Zack go to Jujitsu
was a magician. Oh really? Yeah.

1359
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:55,760
He's always inviting me to go there.
But you know what?

1360
01:19:55,761 --> 01:19:57,800
You have to wear like a
jacket and a tie and I know,

1361
01:19:57,890 --> 01:20:00,560
and there's always least rapey
actors there that you, that you're,

1362
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:03,170
I heard every time he'd go, there's
somebody weird there. You're like,

1363
01:20:03,171 --> 01:20:07,680
why is that person here? Like some guy
from the eighties? No, not even that.

1364
01:20:07,681 --> 01:20:12,060
Like shit, what's his name? I think, uh,
I, I don't want to say it, but I don't,

1365
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,670
I don't know who, what is the name is, but
it's somebody you're like, wow. Really?

1366
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:15,990
Like pat that guys here,

1367
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:21,470
I saw the Stephen Baldwin is suing
Kevin Costner for Kevin Costner has a,

1368
01:20:23,181 --> 01:20:23,580
um,

1369
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:28,470
apparently he owns a piece of some
company that makes them machine that takes

1370
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:32,210
oil out of water, which is
pretty surreal. It doesn't,

1371
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:37,340
doesn't make sound spill or that last big
spill he donated or something to that.

1372
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:38,513
Pretty crazy.

1373
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,940
When you stop and think that somehow or
another Kevin Costner is a part of this.

1374
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:44,690
I don't know how he got to be a part.
I don't know what the story behind that.

1375
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,320
A real bro I might've been.

1376
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,710
I bet they paid him a fuck
load of money for water world.

1377
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,480
I mean waterworld it wasn't like,

1378
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:56,020
it was one of the biggest budget movies
of all time at that time and it made the

1379
01:20:56,050 --> 01:21:00,060
last the most, I guess. I
don't know if it lost the most,

1380
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:04,350
but it lost a shitload. She looked that
shit up, find out if it done. But um,

1381
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:08,070
I remember when it came out there was
like, God, what a fucking crazy idea.

1382
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:11,710
This movie sucks. I never watched
the whole thing. What the fuck?

1383
01:21:11,711 --> 01:21:15,570
Don't they can film a whole movie on the
water that's so hard to do just to get

1384
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:19,050
your shit out there, get your goddamn
equipment out there on the water.

1385
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:21,060
Everything's getting wet and fucked up.

1386
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:25,500
Dropping your camera in the water
all the time. It's so stupid.

1387
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:28,200
And the premise sucks
anyway. What's the, oh,

1388
01:21:28,201 --> 01:21:32,340
everything's water now because we
go just in the future, you know,

1389
01:21:32,341 --> 01:21:34,530
like we're like earthquakes,

1390
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,540
everything fell into the
ocean or something like that.

1391
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:41,340
That would be way more sharks. If that
was the case, there'd be way more sharks.

1392
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:42,481
There would be,

1393
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:47,481
everybody would be Jackin like sharks
and all sorts of things be grabbing

1394
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:48,210
people,

1395
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:53,210
pulling them under starfish
and shit octopus's to pursue,

1396
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,060
grabbing them,
dragging them underwater.

1397
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:58,770
There'll be a lot of that
because people would,

1398
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,080
we'd be like a little bobbers everywhere.

1399
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,330
Kevin Costner was on
the set of that movie.

1400
01:22:03,331 --> 01:22:07,680
Hundred and 57 days working
six days a week for a movie.

1401
01:22:07,681 --> 01:22:12,630
That's a long ass for a movie that's
sucked a big fat bag of Dicks or we got

1402
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:16,530
widely considered to be one of the
biggest box office bonds of all times.

1403
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:21,531
Although it grows 255 million
from $175 million budget.

1404
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:26,100
This does not factor in marketing and
distribution charges or percentage of the

1405
01:22:26,101 --> 01:22:27,630
gross that theater's keep,

1406
01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:32,631
which is up to 45% the film came to be
nicknamed Kevin's gate after Heaven's

1407
01:22:33,691 --> 01:22:38,580
gate and fish tar after
Ishtar to make bombs. Yeah.

1408
01:22:38,581 --> 01:22:41,880
Ishtar was a huge, never saw that
either. Did you ever watch that? Yeah,

1409
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:45,570
I think I watched part of it when
I was a kid, but I don't remember.

1410
01:22:45,571 --> 01:22:50,220
It was Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman
and I don't even know what the fuck it

1411
01:22:50,221 --> 01:22:53,550
was about. And what was the other
one that they showed was a big bomb.

1412
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:56,310
The other one I didn't even,
I never even heard of,

1413
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:59,870
but it was called heavens gate.
Yeah,

1414
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:05,140
I think that was a Warren Beatty
movie too. What's that? No, no,

1415
01:23:05,141 --> 01:23:06,820
that's Chris Christopherson.

1416
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:11,820
Christopher Walken and John hurt
and actually got a 6.5 on imdv.

1417
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:17,510
Huh. But just Bob, that's a
pretty cool cover. A poster.

1418
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:19,730
Never saw it.
Never saw the Ishtar.

1419
01:23:19,731 --> 01:23:22,610
I remember [inaudible] was a
bomb and it was not just a bomb,

1420
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:27,790
but everybody talked about what a calm it
was. So it became a massive bomb. Like,

1421
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,220
oh my God, have you seen Ishtar what a
piece of shit like didn't even see it.

1422
01:23:31,221 --> 01:23:33,890
And they were just saying it was a piece
of shit. Yeah. I mean, even as a kid,

1423
01:23:33,891 --> 01:23:37,880
I used this term as a reference. It's
something cheap or Shitty, like, you know,

1424
01:23:37,881 --> 01:23:41,450
like I would say things where
that's like Ishtar. Oh really? Yeah.

1425
01:23:41,451 --> 01:23:45,470
Like that was meanwhile I was like super
expensive probably because they had to

1426
01:23:45,471 --> 01:23:48,780
pay Dustin Hoffman and Warren
Bay, right? Yeah. Yeah. What,

1427
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:54,070
how much Kevin Costume made for 157
days on a piece of shit movie. Right.

1428
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:57,770
We had some guys from a fear factor stunt
guys that worked on that and they were

1429
01:23:57,771 --> 01:24:02,240
saying it was, well, it sounds like,
yeah, it sounds pretty ridiculous.

1430
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,160
Just the idea behind it,
man.

1431
01:24:04,161 --> 01:24:07,340
You gonna make a fucking movie where
everything's floating. Stop it.

1432
01:24:07,341 --> 01:24:11,790
You silly bitch. Like, well, the
best one though wasn't even that.

1433
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:15,380
The best one was the post man.
Did you ever see that? No.

1434
01:24:15,381 --> 01:24:19,220
I never watched horses. Right.
It was, I came on horses.

1435
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,430
It was in the future after
the shit hits the fan.

1436
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:26,270
Kevin Costner is a fucking hero
because he delivers letters to people.

1437
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:30,860
He's the postmaster. Oh
my God. Dude, it's so bad.

1438
01:24:30,861 --> 01:24:34,100
You can't believe it's real
and the acting is so bad.

1439
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:39,310
The acting is like ABC after
school special acting like
there's no way it seems

1440
01:24:41,511 --> 01:24:45,380
real. It's like shut up
mom, get out of my room.

1441
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:49,820
Like it just does not seem,
there's nothing realistic
about it at all. And the,

1442
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,590
the premise is dawn shit.

1443
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:56,800
Yeah. And did you, did you see
her about fucking Thq and ea?

1444
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:00,280
Yeah. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah.
The UFC is going to make um,

1445
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:05,380
their new video game with
ea and apparently teach cube
bought it or ea bought it

1446
01:25:05,381 --> 01:25:10,150
from Thq. You know, I feel bad at Thq
shut down a shut down the developer that,

1447
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:12,910
you know that did it shut
down their office yesterday,

1448
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:17,620
he three just closed down and they didn't
have a booth at this year's e three

1449
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:18,670
because I was originally,

1450
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:22,270
cause I'm going to eat three Tamara and
I wanted to talk to them about UFC and

1451
01:25:22,271 --> 01:25:23,740
all that crap like that.
And they were like,

1452
01:25:23,741 --> 01:25:26,710
and we don't have a booth where
meeting at a hotel and I'm like, Whoa,

1453
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:29,170
what's going down? But then, uh, yeah,

1454
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:33,460
I think THQ did a really good job with
that game and Thq I thought, you know,

1455
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:37,960
with saints row, I mean they've been
saint's row just released a map pack.

1456
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:41,380
Then Brian Keeley who does
podcasts with me, uh, she,

1457
01:25:41,381 --> 01:25:44,540
she's in the new map packs
so they actually combining
video games with penthouse

1458
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,800
now, which I thought was
cool. That's smart. Yeah.

1459
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:50,040
But um, I think they're, they're
losing a lot of money, man.

1460
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:53,280
The UFC game was the only game
apparently that was making good money.

1461
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:55,060
Now are you going to be,
do you know yet?

1462
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,700
Are you going to be doing the
EA Games of this yet? Right?

1463
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:02,260
Are you sure? I'll probably do it. Yeah.
Yeah. It's, it's a pain in the deck,

1464
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:04,100
but a,
it's worth it

1465
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,190
in the long run. It's the, you know,
the, the, the finished product.

1466
01:26:07,191 --> 01:26:11,450
They're very thorough. Yeah. Like
we do, we did so much commentary.

1467
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:14,480
You don't get too much repeat like words,

1468
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:19,580
like there's all sorts of
different versions of, you
know, things that you do and,

1469
01:26:19,581 --> 01:26:22,550
and like transitions
like Armbar to knee bar,

1470
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,810
transitioning from the
triangle to the arm bar,

1471
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:28,370
like all that different kinds of stuff.
Like we've voiced them all individually,

1472
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:32,330
you know, so it's, there's,
there's so many moves you can do.

1473
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:35,930
It's like really kind of crazy
that you look at that, that thing,

1474
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,260
that remote control and you're supposed
to be able to figure that out like down

1475
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:44,090
here and up there and laughed and
push this and push that. It's, it's a,

1476
01:26:44,091 --> 01:26:45,260
it's a fucking,

1477
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:49,730
it's not that you got to like take a
lot of time to figure out all the moves

1478
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:53,540
that you're your, your guys capable
of doing because there's so much shit.

1479
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:57,190
There's so many different submissions
and punches and kicks and,

1480
01:26:57,430 --> 01:27:02,240
and to know what button is doing what
at the exact same moment as fucking hard

1481
01:27:02,241 --> 01:27:03,950
man.
There's a lot involved.

1482
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:05,880
Or now that it's with ea,

1483
01:27:05,881 --> 01:27:09,660
you need to hold out for
more money because they are
the big pimps of the video

1484
01:27:09,661 --> 01:27:11,000
game industry.
Do you know what I'm saying?

1485
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,450
They hear exactly what my
fucking plans are. No. Yeah.

1486
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:18,150
But no they,
that's cool though.

1487
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:22,140
Cause ea does make the best sports games
and a lot of people get yeah it gets a

1488
01:27:22,141 --> 01:27:24,300
lot of shit for being like the monopoly,

1489
01:27:24,301 --> 01:27:29,070
like buying out and killing all the small
companies and shit like that. But EA,

1490
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:34,220
they do make some fucking kick ass games
like the tiger woods golf fucking mad

1491
01:27:34,221 --> 01:27:37,110
and football. Right. You
know, I mean they, they uh,

1492
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:39,450
they own some of the biggest franchises.

1493
01:27:39,451 --> 01:27:44,190
So I think it's better way better for for
UFC video game in the future. I think.

1494
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:47,020
Well Dana is very excited about
and when he told me about it,

1495
01:27:47,021 --> 01:27:49,330
he was saying that these guys are the
best and they're going to make the best

1496
01:27:49,331 --> 01:27:49,780
game.

1497
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:53,350
It's funny cause ea had recently said
that we're going to have a new MMA game.

1498
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:56,750
Right. And you know, no one knew that
it was going to be the UFC. Yeah.

1499
01:27:56,770 --> 01:28:00,350
But everybody was like, oh it's
probably going to be EA MMA to right.

1500
01:28:00,370 --> 01:28:04,540
The second version of it cause they had
an EA MMA game with like fade or Anna and

1501
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:05,350
right.

1502
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:08,280
I wonder if they're going to use that
engine or if they're going to buy out that

1503
01:28:08,281 --> 01:28:11,420
THQ engine or started creating a new
engine. Cause that'll be interesting. Yes,

1504
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:15,820
that's a good point. It might just
be a restrict MMA game. I wonder.

1505
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:19,210
MMA looked looked decent,
but man,

1506
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:22,570
a lot of the fucking fighters did
not look like the real fighter.

1507
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:25,510
Yeah. I think they rushed that game.
They were like, oh shit, we can't,

1508
01:28:25,511 --> 01:28:29,270
we gotta we gotta release
the game now. You know, like
I think they saw what, when,

1509
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:31,330
when UFC all the heat from UFC,

1510
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:34,130
those guys fucking work.

1511
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:38,010
That's the one thing that it really puts
in perspective when you hang out with

1512
01:28:38,011 --> 01:28:40,640
the garlic cliffy be you
go to the epic game studio.

1513
01:28:40,641 --> 01:28:45,020
You know like when we went down there or
if you go to Thq and you see like the,

1514
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:47,420
the hours that we put in the video game,
pretty minuscule.

1515
01:28:47,421 --> 01:28:51,000
I mean I could complain it like six
hours of sitting there going, yeah.

1516
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:53,990
But the reality is that's not the,
that's not a hard job,

1517
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:58,910
but these fucking guys are
working long hours every day.

1518
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:01,530
And then when things don't go well,
they just get laid off.

1519
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,480
Are we back? Jesus Christ,
Ladies and gentlemen,

1520
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:11,250
the technology here is
just ridiculous. We, um,

1521
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:15,570
had a, an issue here at
the Rogan compound with a,

1522
01:29:15,571 --> 01:29:19,360
at one point in time the uh,
um,

1523
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:23,040
router tip fucking up and I would
have to reboot it twice a day.

1524
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:27,690
So today we replaced everything and yet
the same thing happened really twice a

1525
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:29,190
day. Yeah, sometimes.

1526
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:32,340
Sometimes I would do it would
have to reboot it twice a
day and that sucks. Well,

1527
01:29:32,341 --> 01:29:36,900
the router was shitting out, so I
replaced the router today and it shut up.

1528
01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:40,650
You mean the Cape, the router
they give you, you had replaced,

1529
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:46,550
my house has a system and there's a
ethernet jacks all throughout the house so

1530
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:50,610
you can get online anywhere. And then, you
know, that was when I bought this house,

1531
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:54,570
wireless wasn't that big.
And then now we set about wired,

1532
01:29:54,571 --> 01:29:59,070
but so there's in the garage,
it's like a big box that has all this,

1533
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:04,410
these wires going into it and this giant
big ass router that runs everything.

1534
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:08,970
It's unnecessarily complicated,
but that's the way you want to have it.

1535
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,210
If you, uh, have a house
that has, you know,

1536
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,800
if you want Ethernet ports in your house,
you kind of have to have it. They all,

1537
01:30:15,801 --> 01:30:20,070
all the wires have to go to a sum. And
why don't you just do wireless? You can,

1538
01:30:20,071 --> 01:30:21,840
but it wasn't,
won't work for the whole house.

1539
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:25,650
You can get those little repeaters
everywhere throughout your house. Yeah.

1540
01:30:25,651 --> 01:30:28,320
I've never tried that.
We have different stations.

1541
01:30:28,321 --> 01:30:30,630
We have stations throughout the house.

1542
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,880
I want to make sure that
it's a strong signal to,

1543
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:37,020
there's nothing more annoying than a
flitting wired, fleeting wireless signal.

1544
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:37,854
You have to fucking,

1545
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,990
you've got to sit on the corner of
the couch if you want to get it. Like,

1546
01:30:39,991 --> 01:30:44,070
why the fuck out of here? You
should just have like, you know,

1547
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:46,170
like Time Warner on
one side of your house.

1548
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:49,030
You verse on the other side of your
house and have like all of them. So like,

1549
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:50,460
whenever one's down in back,
all right,

1550
01:30:50,461 --> 01:30:53,280
let's just go into this side of
the house and use something else.

1551
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:56,460
Or You could test them all out at the
same time. See which one's the best. Yeah,

1552
01:30:56,461 --> 01:30:57,610
that sounds like a huge band.

1553
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:02,550
That sounds like something you would do
if you had to buy way too much free time.

1554
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:05,490
I would do that.
That I finally get Verizon out here.

1555
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:08,760
I'd give Verizon Internet out here to
fight us or whatever it's called. No,

1556
01:31:08,761 --> 01:31:11,850
I mean, on your phone.
Oh, right. Works. They,

1557
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,980
Verizon updated it for
the longest time out here.

1558
01:31:13,981 --> 01:31:17,310
I couldn't answer a phone call
and Verizon, but now I can't,

1559
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:19,950
especially if I'm outside from outside,
I'll get confident.

1560
01:31:19,951 --> 01:31:23,950
I'll answer the fucking phone. I'm like,
I don't give a fuck. It can do stuff.

1561
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:27,360
Has two bars right now. That's
just, yeah, it's good for texting,

1562
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:32,310
but it's for phones. It's a pretty
ridiculous, have you heard this thing?

1563
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:36,690
I mean it's on infowars.com I think so.

1564
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:41,010
It might not be real, but, um, not
that info wars is all horse shit,

1565
01:31:41,011 --> 01:31:43,470
but they get a little crazy sometimes.
It's a,

1566
01:31:43,471 --> 01:31:48,471
it says 5 million farmers are suing
Monsanto for seven point $7 billion.

1567
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:54,450
Hmm.
That's a pretty incredible five bill.

1568
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:58,710
5 million farmers.
Seven point $7 billion,

1569
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:02,610
which is like what they make in
a month probably. Right. But uh,

1570
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:07,420
that's a lot of fucking people.
It's chicken scratch. Yeah.

1571
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:12,340
They say that a farmer commit
suicide because of, uh,

1572
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:16,570
because of, uh, Monsanto
on some fucking ridiculous,

1573
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:19,960
ridiculous rate.

1574
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,710
I'm trying to find it here in the
articles because there was something crazy

1575
01:32:23,711 --> 01:32:26,170
like every 30 seconds a
farmer commit suicide.

1576
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:31,590
17,683 Indian farmers just
in 2009 committed suicide.

1577
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:38,530
Whoa. That's just ridiculous.
So they're all suing.

1578
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:39,630
Okay.

1579
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:44,190
For as much as 6.2 billion euro,
seven point $7 billion.

1580
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:49,230
I don't even think this is an
America. I was just going on. Wow.

1581
01:32:49,470 --> 01:32:52,680
Oh, suicide. Every 30 minutes.
Wow. That is what it is. Oh,

1582
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:58,380
it's probably really hard to find red
chickens, not chickens. It's the seeds,

1583
01:32:58,381 --> 01:33:02,040
man. It's not the, it's they're
trying to patent animals,

1584
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:05,400
but right now it's mostly mostly seeds,

1585
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,030
but they're selling they their
terminator seeds, you know, they're,

1586
01:33:09,031 --> 01:33:12,450
they're only good for a certain amount
and then they don't make seeds that work.

1587
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:15,930
It's really kind of crazy that anybody's
ever let them make these fucking

1588
01:33:15,931 --> 01:33:20,070
horrible distorted versions
of life in the first place.

1589
01:33:20,071 --> 01:33:24,710
Who fucking creeps. Did you hear this
thing about a Pentagon suspects? Uh, uh,

1590
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,500
they, they, some people, uh,
in the Pentagon apparently, uh,

1591
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:31,110
downloaded porn run two,

1592
01:33:31,111 --> 01:33:36,111
three go some people in the Pentagon
that were working there download kitty

1593
01:33:37,621 --> 01:33:42,330
porn. It's for research bro. Yeah. And uh,

1594
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:43,680
the, there's some, you know,

1595
01:33:43,681 --> 01:33:47,340
investigation but they won't turn over
the records because they say it's a,

1596
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,750
it would compromise national security.
So they can't, the Pentagon is allowed,

1597
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:55,380
the only people in the world apparently
that are allowed to watch kitty porn

1598
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:58,920
cause they can download it and look,
we know what we're doing. Trust us.

1599
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:03,060
This is all about the United States
government and keeping the beach and the

1600
01:34:03,061 --> 01:34:04,680
security of our fire nation.

1601
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:09,510
You imagine watching kids get fucked by
adults as a part of the security of your

1602
01:34:09,511 --> 01:34:12,540
fine nation and you, you
can't, you can't tell.

1603
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:16,560
Why can't you say it's a
part of a research project
where this guy downloaded it

1604
01:34:16,561 --> 01:34:19,260
or that you know what they're doing.
I bet.

1605
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:20,390
Okay.

1606
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:25,310
I bet they have some sick fuck, that's
a child molester. And they were like,

1607
01:34:25,311 --> 01:34:25,731
you know,
they,

1608
01:34:25,731 --> 01:34:30,680
they'll give them a little child porn
if he gives more information. Yeah.

1609
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:31,940
You know,

1610
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:36,940
I wonder if child porn is
going down lately because
of the other trends in child

1611
01:34:37,731 --> 01:34:42,560
porn. Well, yeah. I mean, you
know, like the, nowadays that
disk, I mean, the old thing.

1612
01:34:42,561 --> 01:34:45,770
What was school girls? Japanese
schoolgirl. Okay. Wait a minute.

1613
01:34:45,771 --> 01:34:49,730
This is way crazier than I thought.
The Pentagon checked on. Wow.

1614
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,290
The Pentagon employee is suspected
of viewing child pornography.

1615
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,860
Fuck what? Okay. This is crazy.

1616
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:03,260
In 2006 the immigration and
Customs Enforcement Agency,

1617
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:06,170
which conducts Internet
pornography investigations,

1618
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:11,440
produced a list of 5,200 Pentagon
employees suspected of viewing child

1619
01:35:12,651 --> 01:35:17,420
pornography.
5,200 employees.

1620
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:19,323
Wow.

1621
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:23,250
I Dunno. That's incredible. I wouldn't
even thought they were that match. Wait,

1622
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,840
what? What? What website is this? What?
This website that I'm reading right here.

1623
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:31,580
boston.com
this is not a conspiracy website at all.

1624
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:33,860
This is a real real website,
right?

1625
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:39,470
The suspected of viewing child pornography
and asked the Pentagon to review it,

1626
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:44,620
but the Pentagon checked only two thirds
of the names unearthing roughly 300

1627
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:49,550
defense and intelligence employees who
allegedly had viewed child pornography on

1628
01:35:49,551 --> 01:35:51,620
their work or home computers. Iris. Right.

1629
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:56,800
The defense investigators failed to check
an additional 1700 names on the list.

1630
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:02,070
Defense officials have
revealed in correspondence
with Senator Charles Grassley,

1631
01:36:02,071 --> 01:36:03,050
a Republican of Iowa,

1632
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:07,250
probably they found out that their systems
were hacked and all these employees

1633
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:11,120
didn't look at child porn.
And then halfway through
searching all of it, but like,

1634
01:36:11,121 --> 01:36:15,080
no, we just got hacked. They
could be, they could, you know,

1635
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:18,630
not want to bring that up.
Right. You don't want to
admit exhibit hacked. Exactly.

1636
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,670
Very possible.

1637
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:25,620
And it was probably some like
famous goats eat 22 year old pick.

1638
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:28,880
You know, it was probably something
stupid like that. That is kind of crazy.

1639
01:36:28,881 --> 01:36:33,760
Number. Yeah, that seems like, boy, I
doubt. I mean, how many employees is or,

1640
01:36:33,761 --> 01:36:35,810
but I mean 5,000 seems pretty big.
It's fun.

1641
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:37,310
Now how many employees
are at the Pentagon?

1642
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:40,940
That's a really good point.

1643
01:36:40,941 --> 01:36:42,890
That probably these knuckleheads
I didn't even think of.

1644
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:47,580
Yeah.
Well

1645
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:51,420
we have a show tomorrow.

1646
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:54,570
Oh yeah, we know. Showed him off the Ice
House and Friday at the Hearst house.

1647
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:59,220
Both in the little room. So don't
sleep. It'll sell out quick.

1648
01:36:59,221 --> 01:37:02,190
It's something like 85 seats.
Um,

1649
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:07,680
depending on how many people
come on bitch. To what,

1650
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:12,600
how many employees? 24,000.
24,000 so that's a, what is it?

1651
01:37:12,601 --> 01:37:14,880
10% how many of you did,
what did we say?

1652
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:19,170
So that's saying one fifth of the
employees are addicted to child points.

1653
01:37:19,171 --> 01:37:22,800
So that's, yeah, that's, that's stupid.
That's have a 2,400 you're right,

1654
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:26,160
it was 5,000 bosses.
They don't want to talk to Burbank.

1655
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:30,340
That's pretty ridiculous. I wonder
if that is the truth. I'm one,

1656
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:33,330
I wonder if you nailed it. Absolutely.
What is, and that's why they did Pentagon.

1657
01:37:33,331 --> 01:37:35,880
Didn't say anything about it.
They just realized that they got hacked.

1658
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:40,940
Or imagine if the government is just
infiltrated by kid fuckers and it's just

1659
01:37:41,251 --> 01:37:45,270
like,
just like the Vatican kid fuckers Galore.

1660
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:49,110
If you had to imagine how many people in
the Vatican got busted for kid fucking,

1661
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,670
how much, how many of them value?
Let's, okay, look on Vatican child porn.

1662
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:58,680
I mean, it's gotta be
something. There's some scandal.

1663
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,500
You can write Vatican child porn and
you know, you're going to get us up.

1664
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,510
There you go. Vatican, uh,

1665
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:07,950
fucking the Canadian bishop
convicted for child pornography.

1666
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:11,460
Boom. How easy. So simple.

1667
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:16,680
Isn't that amazing that you know that
you could look that up. That's so weird.

1668
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:20,250
You can just look up Vatican
child porn and there's something,

1669
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:25,200
some Canadian bishop, he, they uh, they,
they got rid of him. They booted him out.

1670
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:29,670
So it wasn't that, you know,
the Vatican had child porn.

1671
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:34,620
It was that they got rid of
a guy who had child porn.

1672
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:39,180
But then there was the whole issue
of the guy who was the actual, uh,

1673
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:44,670
pope himself, Ratzinger, Ratzinger, Pope
Benedict, whatever the fuck are you.

1674
01:38:44,671 --> 01:38:45,300
I was when,

1675
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:49,380
when he was a bishop or whatever silly
name they like to give themselves

1676
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,430
whatever the hell he was.

1677
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:55,610
He was in charge of following up on cases
of child molestation and it's clear,

1678
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:01,080
clear evidence that he,
he's tried to,

1679
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:06,170
he tried to divert the investigation and
like really slacked off on it and then

1680
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:12,480
got rid of the guy like a aided
and getting rid of the guy who uh,

1681
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:15,210
they were going after. They had all
sorts of little things they would do.

1682
01:39:15,211 --> 01:39:16,020
Like they would,

1683
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:18,900
a guy would get busted bang and kids
and they would just move them to another

1684
01:39:18,901 --> 01:39:20,220
place.
Like that's,

1685
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:23,640
that's been the standard protocol of the
Catholic Church for the longest time.

1686
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:26,820
Whenever someone,
a car no gets caught and gets in trouble,

1687
01:39:26,821 --> 01:39:30,390
they just move them to some other place.
It's really bizarre man.

1688
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:32,760
It makes you really wonder
what it's all about.

1689
01:39:32,761 --> 01:39:37,500
It makes you really wonder if at the the
top branch of the Catholic Church when

1690
01:39:37,501 --> 01:39:41,160
they're all alone,
like are they just all kid fuckers?

1691
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:45,100
They all bring like a bag in
there all around in big circle.

1692
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:48,610
Ne Empty the bag of their child.
It's like it comes out like,

1693
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:52,230
would it be something really fucked up?
Like they kidnap one shout a month.

1694
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:55,080
What did you hear about the
child that was missing from the,

1695
01:39:55,590 --> 01:40:00,590
I'll pull up child a whole and then
now you are in the Pentagon list wasn't

1696
01:40:04,711 --> 01:40:09,450
there was a, there was a, okay, here's a
child sex investigation. Yeah. This is it.

1697
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,490
There was a story where I'm,

1698
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:16,520
a former bishop said that a girl
who turned up missing missing was,

1699
01:40:16,891 --> 01:40:17,724
um,

1700
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:22,770
was taken by the Vatican and they used
her as a sex slave and killed her.

1701
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:26,960
Oh my God. Yeah. It's
so fucking crazy. Yeah.

1702
01:40:26,961 --> 01:40:30,900
Friday of fucking
strange man. Crazy. Yeah.

1703
01:40:32,530 --> 01:40:34,230
Wow.
This is so,

1704
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:38,160
whenever they look at these things and
these probes and they find out how many

1705
01:40:38,161 --> 01:40:40,620
different reverends were fucked up.

1706
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:45,620
The church previously insisted the
crimes of the late Reverend Massey,

1707
01:40:45,931 --> 01:40:50,130
l m a C I e l were his alone.

1708
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:54,160
He was a long held up as a model
by Pope John Paul the second,

1709
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:56,050
despite credible accusations,

1710
01:40:56,200 --> 01:41:01,200
later proven that he raped and molested
his seminarians lesion of Christ had

1711
01:41:02,021 --> 01:41:05,290
over 900 priest while Jesus Christ,
this guy,

1712
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:10,570
I don't even want to hear this,
he died in 2008 a year later,

1713
01:41:10,571 --> 01:41:15,100
the Orthodox order confessed that he
had fathered three children with two

1714
01:41:15,101 --> 01:41:19,300
different women and that he had abused
as seminarians. Just so there's,

1715
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:23,560
there's an arrogance and a lot of these
dudes have when they become priests that

1716
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:25,930
they feel like they're,
everybody kisses their ass.

1717
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:29,020
Have you ever been to a church? You ever
been to like Catholic Church, Catholic?

1718
01:41:29,021 --> 01:41:31,570
Well, I mean I've been to him but I
didn't go to one. You know what I mean?

1719
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:35,610
Catholic churches is very creepy
and it's very, um, it's very strict,

1720
01:41:35,611 --> 01:41:37,960
like very strict.
Like if you giggle and a Catholic church,

1721
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:40,420
they'll smack you and your fuck.
Yeah, they don't want that noise.

1722
01:41:40,450 --> 01:41:43,590
They don't want kids to be
kids in Catholic church. Gary,

1723
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:44,680
like you go to Baptist church,

1724
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:47,680
baptist churches and everybody's
laughing and giggling.

1725
01:41:47,681 --> 01:41:51,340
A little babies are crying. They'll smack
a baby in a Catholic church. Nobody.

1726
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:55,840
Nobody wants little kids crying out in
a Catholic church there, there, there,

1727
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:00,850
it's like a harsh environment. And the
priests are con yes, father, father,

1728
01:42:00,851 --> 01:42:02,170
everyone's talking to them father,

1729
01:42:02,171 --> 01:42:04,870
and everyone's like real nervous
to be around them. So they,

1730
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:07,930
especially the old ones,
they have this arrogance about them,

1731
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,160
which is really strange.
Like you,

1732
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:13,720
you're just some creepy old
queer and a fucking weird outfit.

1733
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:17,890
He can't come out of the closet and you're
spouting off nonsense and everybody's

1734
01:42:17,891 --> 01:42:18,531
kissing your ass.

1735
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:22,660
So you've gotten confused and you really
do believe that you're above everyone

1736
01:42:22,661 --> 01:42:25,930
else. Like they have a weird
fucking sense of entitlement.

1737
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:30,430
And it's very strange talking to a lot
of priests. Obviously. Not all of them,

1738
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:31,323
a lot of priests,

1739
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:36,250
but the one who gave the eulogy for
my grandmother's funeral is a perfect

1740
01:42:36,251 --> 01:42:40,480
example that he was, first of all, you
had gin blossoms all over his face.

1741
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:43,210
This poor fuck. You know when they
get those broken blood vessels,

1742
01:42:43,211 --> 01:42:47,200
when they get hammered all the
time. I mean, it's a shit life, man.

1743
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:50,650
This fucking dude, his whole,
he was an obvious drunk.

1744
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:55,510
And then so it was the one who married
my sister. Same thing, gin blossoms,

1745
01:42:55,511 --> 01:43:00,430
all risk crushers. What is
bird have those bridges.

1746
01:43:00,770 --> 01:43:05,500
And to have those outlets for like
old dudes are like on death's door.

1747
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:07,510
Um, but anyway, um,

1748
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:11,230
my grandmother's name was Josephine
and as they're doing the eulogy,

1749
01:43:11,231 --> 01:43:12,580
he keeps calling her Geraldine.

1750
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:16,090
He calls her Geraldine like three
times and someone steps up and goes,

1751
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:20,380
it's Josephine, her name was
Josephine. And so he just,

1752
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:23,500
without missing a beat,
Josephine,

1753
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:27,800
and he doesn't say my apologies.
I mean this is a bunch of people who are,

1754
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:32,680
are sad because you know,
their mom has died and these fucks,

1755
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,220
you know, this guy's given that he's
just completely phone in this end.

1756
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:39,400
So when he's saying Geraldine, Geraldine,
they correct them instead of saying,

1757
01:43:39,401 --> 01:43:43,570
I'm sorry, you know, I made a
mistake. Uh, her name was Josephine,

1758
01:43:43,571 --> 01:43:48,520
not Geraldine's. My apologies. Instead
of that, he just changed it. Geraldine,

1759
01:43:48,521 --> 01:43:52,400
we hear on a,
Geraldine died,

1760
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:54,620
not Geraldine at Josephine
Josephine who died.

1761
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:59,210
It's just like phoning him down saying
the way he just said like the words and

1762
01:43:59,211 --> 01:43:59,871
the order.

1763
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:04,220
No emotion behind it and know enough
and goodnight everybody take it easy.

1764
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:08,390
I'm going to go drink no pussy,
no fun,

1765
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:13,790
no riverboat gambling.
Just little children's mouth suppression.

1766
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:16,850
I wonder how many of them are gay and
how many of them were just miserable.

1767
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,380
How many of you want to fuck kids?

1768
01:44:18,381 --> 01:44:20,210
How many of them want to just
shoot themselves in the head?

1769
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:23,330
What are the actual numbers and
I'm sure a few of them are happy.

1770
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:24,560
Don't get crazy Twitter.

1771
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:29,900
That's the thing that people get fucking
most angry at me about is a shitting on

1772
01:44:29,901 --> 01:44:30,710
religion,

1773
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:33,770
which I think it's so hilarious cause
I'm only shitting on specific acts that

1774
01:44:33,771 --> 01:44:36,080
you could, you could attribute
them to religion, but this is,

1775
01:44:36,081 --> 01:44:38,030
these are human beings
that are fucking kids.

1776
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:42,360
Call it religion and crawling up. That
religion also makes me like, I see,

1777
01:44:42,361 --> 01:44:45,720
I don't see religion as bad
because I grew up Lutheran,

1778
01:44:45,721 --> 01:44:50,040
which is like I guess you know we had a
Starbucks and stuff and our church or in

1779
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:54,300
a Starbucks. Starbucks. And your church
with a coffee place like a Starbucks.

1780
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:58,440
Really? Yeah. I mean it was you know a
lot different than like a social thing.

1781
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:01,470
Happy. Yeah, it was good. It was
positive. It was like it was,

1782
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:05,730
it was more relaxing and shit like that
so none of that shit in the Catholic

1783
01:45:05,731 --> 01:45:09,720
church and I wasn't too too intense.
Catholic church is all about guilt.

1784
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:14,850
If you look at like if you think about
the the churches that are involved with

1785
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:19,770
the most fucked up accusations, the
Catholic churches at the top of that list,

1786
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:25,020
the top and they're also
the most suppressive, the
most suppressive, the most.

1787
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:30,260
They just fill your head with guilt
and anxiety and suffering and the feel

1788
01:45:31,311 --> 01:45:32,580
you're the, the, the,

1789
01:45:32,581 --> 01:45:36,540
the feeling rather that you are a failure
and that you are inadequate and that

1790
01:45:36,541 --> 01:45:41,250
you will never measure up and you're a
sinner in the eyes of God and then have

1791
01:45:41,251 --> 01:45:44,280
any of that. It was God, it
was horrible. First grade.

1792
01:45:44,281 --> 01:45:47,910
I did a full year of Catholic school and
we went to church when I was like six

1793
01:45:47,911 --> 01:45:51,120
or seven and when we went to church like
on a regular basis all the time and it

1794
01:45:51,121 --> 01:45:54,720
was all leashes. It was
disgusting. It was just,

1795
01:45:54,721 --> 01:45:56,340
it was all like terror.

1796
01:45:56,520 --> 01:46:00,120
All I could think of is every day
before school I'd be like, fuck,

1797
01:46:00,121 --> 01:46:02,340
I can't believe I have
to go to this place.

1798
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:07,400
Just as torturous place to drop off
your children where they just gland onto

1799
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:10,770
your fucking neck and suck
off all your happiness.

1800
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:12,360
Just suck it out of you like a van

1801
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:16,080
prior man. Really Weird. I remember,

1802
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,810
I really clearly remember being in

1803
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:22,990
the middle of class while the teacher
was doing something crazy and they were

1804
01:46:22,991 --> 01:46:26,260
talking about something crazy.
I was like, you guys are knots.

1805
01:46:26,261 --> 01:46:27,940
Like how are you even saying this?

1806
01:46:27,941 --> 01:46:31,930
Like listen to what's coming out of
your mouth. This is complete nonsense.

1807
01:46:32,290 --> 01:46:35,950
Like what the fuck are we doing here?
That's kind of weird.

1808
01:46:35,951 --> 01:46:39,400
You almost got some kind of weird,
I don't know,

1809
01:46:39,401 --> 01:46:44,401
like some kind of like not
being molested as a child.

1810
01:46:44,591 --> 01:46:48,550
You were exposed to something that's
probably a positive and offer your,

1811
01:46:48,551 --> 01:46:49,980
your as an adult mental

1812
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,940
molestation and a huge percentage of
Catholics go through that shit. I mean,

1813
01:46:53,941 --> 01:46:56,460
I've talked to kids who went to Catholic
school. It didn't have a bad time,

1814
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:57,450
but most of them,

1815
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:02,510
a good percentage of them had a gruesome
experience with the sole sapping.

1816
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:08,370
It just sucked the life out of you.
And that's why the Catholics are so crazy.

1817
01:47:08,371 --> 01:47:10,770
They bounce back and he
can't suppress people.

1818
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:13,680
And then we've talked about this before,
the Catholic school girls,

1819
01:47:13,681 --> 01:47:15,990
girls that like Jenny McCarthy,
perfect example,

1820
01:47:15,991 --> 01:47:17,070
you're talking about a horny she was,

1821
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,320
she went to an all girls
Catholic school man.

1822
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:24,360
All Girls Catholic schools
produce the best slots. Really?

1823
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:29,280
Oh yeah. They're all fucking locked
away. They have to sprint for Dick.

1824
01:47:29,281 --> 01:47:30,630
As soon as the light turns green,

1825
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:34,200
they don't get to see Dick all day at
school and flirt around with them and make

1826
01:47:34,201 --> 01:47:37,020
friends with them and pass
notes in class. No, all day.

1827
01:47:37,021 --> 01:47:39,990
It's just boiling pot of Pussy.
This,

1828
01:47:39,991 --> 01:47:44,991
this big boiling mass of
estrogen and female hormones.

1829
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:49,650
And then the light turns green and they
run out the door and just dive on a cock

1830
01:47:49,651 --> 01:47:51,630
like a patriotic soldier on a grenade.

1831
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:55,890
They can't wait to get some dick in them.

1832
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:58,200
This poor fucking girl
that I did in high school,

1833
01:47:58,201 --> 01:48:03,201
her and her sister were both the biggest
pigs and they both went to Catholic

1834
01:48:03,931 --> 01:48:07,320
school and then there was another one
who was like a prude who went to public

1835
01:48:07,321 --> 01:48:12,060
school. It was really weird. It was
like for some reason, one of them,

1836
01:48:12,090 --> 01:48:16,650
they started her off in public school and
they just kept her in, but our sister,

1837
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:20,190
they, they had a little money. Her
sister was a couple of years younger,

1838
01:48:20,191 --> 01:48:22,470
so they said, well, we're going to
put, we're doing a little better now.

1839
01:48:22,471 --> 01:48:25,860
We're going to try to put her through
Catholic school and that girl was the girl

1840
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:28,860
I dated and all my God,
she was a freak.

1841
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:34,020
She was a fucking freak.
She would fuck anybody.

1842
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:38,730
Anybody who tried to fuck her, she would
fuck them. She was, this pitch was crazy,

1843
01:48:38,731 --> 01:48:41,370
man. I told you that.
She was a girl where my,

1844
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:45,570
my friend was fingering her in front of
my house when I got up in the morning to

1845
01:48:45,571 --> 01:48:49,320
deliver newspapers. They
were still up from, you know,

1846
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:51,770
the night before partying and
they're parked in front of my,

1847
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:54,990
my fucking house and I
slammed my hand on the hood.

1848
01:48:55,150 --> 01:48:58,320
I don't remember what I said something
half witty, but I was like, Jesus Christ,

1849
01:48:58,710 --> 01:48:59,430
my,
uh,

1850
01:48:59,430 --> 01:49:04,230
all my expectations for relationships
were shattered by my first two girlfriends

1851
01:49:04,231 --> 01:49:09,231
right away because one of them was a
complete slut that could not just leave a

1852
01:49:09,841 --> 01:49:13,770
dick alone.
A Dick was like a kitten with a ball yard.

1853
01:49:13,771 --> 01:49:16,830
You can't roll a ball yard in front
of a kid and they just fucking pause,

1854
01:49:16,831 --> 01:49:19,770
go up and they dive on that shit.
That's how she was with Cox.

1855
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:23,850
And then the other one was
like really manipulative. The
other one, like, you know,

1856
01:49:23,851 --> 01:49:26,580
you drive an hour and a half to see her
and she's like, I'm not in the mood.

1857
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,140
You know,
she was like really creepy.

1858
01:49:28,141 --> 01:49:32,700
Like she wanted to be the one who
always decided what was on TV and always

1859
01:49:32,701 --> 01:49:36,660
decided what music we're listening
to too. Yeah, it was, it was,

1860
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,490
it was a weird selfish thing.

1861
01:49:38,491 --> 01:49:43,290
She grew up an only child and her mom was
kind of a con and so it was a, wasn't,

1862
01:49:43,291 --> 01:49:44,124
it wasn't happy.

1863
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:47,440
Her mom was like a big woman and
she had a bad opinion of it was.

1864
01:49:47,441 --> 01:49:51,280
So it was a lot of weirdness in
that house. So I got to see both.

1865
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:55,390
I got to see Conti but pretty and nice.
You know,

1866
01:49:55,570 --> 01:49:59,500
most of the time just country behavior
occasionally and then super whore. Yeah.

1867
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:03,370
And so I was like, Jesus
Christ, relationships are
disastrous. Like right away,

1868
01:50:03,371 --> 01:50:06,190
like the first couple of years of
relationships. To me it was like,

1869
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:09,670
what's the point in this? Not that I
was in a fucking prize back then either.

1870
01:50:09,671 --> 01:50:12,730
I mean I was completely crazy,
but just,

1871
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:17,110
it's funny how you can have a couple of
crazy relationships while you're young

1872
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:20,800
and it completely shapes you. You know,
you just, that's where you get your x.

1873
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:24,220
That's where you form your opinions
of what relationships are like.

1874
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:28,480
Like I've had some relationships as an
older man, you know, when, uh, you know,

1875
01:50:28,481 --> 01:50:33,400
it was, uh, like when I got to be like,
you know, my late twenties and 30,

1876
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:37,330
well like, they're really
nice people. Like, you know,
you enjoyed being around him.

1877
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:41,980
I didn't even think that was possible when
I lived in Boston. I thought, you know,

1878
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:44,040
based on my own personal
experience and it was like,

1879
01:50:44,041 --> 01:50:46,870
this is just some shit you got
to do to get some pussy and then,

1880
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:51,280
then run away from them as quick as you
can, go find your friends. You know?

1881
01:50:51,281 --> 01:50:54,790
That was, that was my, uh,
my, uh, my, my take on it.

1882
01:50:55,780 --> 01:50:59,170
Plus if you're trying to do
anything else while you're a kid,

1883
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:02,290
you don't really have the time
for a real relationship. You know,

1884
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:05,200
if you're going to high school and
you're trying to pursue something,

1885
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:08,780
like if you're pursuing a sport
or trying to be in a band or any,

1886
01:51:08,781 --> 01:51:09,640
anything you're trying to do,

1887
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:13,570
where you're throwing all of your
possible energy at that your,

1888
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:16,930
your amount of time that you have for
relationships is, it's pretty cool.

1889
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:20,940
I feel that way right now. Most, you
know, like I was watching that old movie,

1890
01:51:20,941 --> 01:51:25,140
Howard Stern Private Parts and he and
that movie was taught how to part with his

1891
01:51:25,141 --> 01:51:28,980
old wife Beth, where Beth was like,
that sounds old wife. His new wife,

1892
01:51:28,981 --> 01:51:32,460
his path or what's his old,
the girl that he dated before?

1893
01:51:32,461 --> 01:51:35,760
I don't remember Alison. Alison.
Alison was like, you know,

1894
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:38,180
there was a creepy that I
know that, yeah, we can go is,

1895
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:40,860
but Alison was like saying like,
you had never had a time,

1896
01:51:40,861 --> 01:51:45,060
you only have time for your radio show and
Blah, blah blah, and everything's know.

1897
01:51:45,170 --> 01:51:47,130
And I'm thinking like, Shit,
you know, that's the St well,

1898
01:51:47,131 --> 01:51:51,210
how I feel right now because I'm putting
everything in one basket with doing

1899
01:51:51,211 --> 01:51:53,970
podcasting and all that crap.
Why do you do that? Listen man,

1900
01:51:53,971 --> 01:51:55,880
you're doing really well now.
And you,

1901
01:51:55,890 --> 01:51:58,980
you went on the road with Joey Diaz and
did stand up and had a great fucking

1902
01:51:58,981 --> 01:52:02,140
like a little baby. It's like a little
baby. It's like a little, you know,

1903
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:06,900
little little project that I'm watching
grow and blossom. And especially,

1904
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:10,440
it's interesting when I have people
like take over and then like it,

1905
01:52:10,441 --> 01:52:13,740
like I come in in the room
and I'm like, you know, I'm
like, Oh shit, look, you know,

1906
01:52:13,741 --> 01:52:16,030
the camera's not even on that
person that he ended up per se.

1907
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:20,330
It's shit like that where it's like people
you haven't taken over are stolen. No,

1908
01:52:20,331 --> 01:52:23,730
no, no, no. These are the friends that are
just helping me out. But, but, but that,

1909
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:27,930
but that's what, that's a good example
of like where I'm like, you know,

1910
01:52:27,931 --> 01:52:31,640
I feel like I have to have some kind
of quality control and you know,

1911
01:52:31,650 --> 01:52:34,470
cause that's like a little baby
that I created. You know, it's like,

1912
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:35,693
I totally understand.

1913
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:38,580
No, I totally understand where
you're coming from. I just think, um,

1914
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:43,440
you could get there easier for you
with less of them. You know, I have,

1915
01:52:43,441 --> 01:52:46,130
I've been cutting a lot. Good, good.

1916
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:47,121
But on the other hand,

1917
01:52:47,121 --> 01:52:49,910
we've been doing three Joe Rogan
podcasts and to ice house shows now.

1918
01:52:49,911 --> 01:52:53,960
So it's like I'm even working harder now.
We're, we're killing it though. It's too,

1919
01:52:53,961 --> 01:52:54,680
it's too,

1920
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,710
I feel too much of an obligation to
all those people that we're meeting.

1921
01:52:57,950 --> 01:53:02,950
Cause it sounds goofy and it's really
hard to talk about without sounding like

1922
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:06,320
you're crazy or you're an EGOMANIAC.

1923
01:53:06,890 --> 01:53:11,890
But I feel like this is
something bigger than all of us.

1924
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:16,610
I feel like we're the ones
who are responsible for
broadcasting it and we're the

1925
01:53:16,611 --> 01:53:20,390
ones who are the, you know,
were the voices on the podcast.

1926
01:53:20,630 --> 01:53:24,260
But this podcast is resonating
with so many fucking people.

1927
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:28,040
It's so many people come to the
shows and it's not just, hey,

1928
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:31,220
we really liked the show.
It's you changed my life.

1929
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:32,840
It's this show changed my life.

1930
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:35,870
This guy came up to me the other day in
Edmonton and he was telling me how he's

1931
01:53:35,871 --> 01:53:37,880
much nicer to people now.
And he just,

1932
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,590
he takes the time to tip more and be
nicer and it's changed his whole way of

1933
01:53:42,591 --> 01:53:46,340
life. He says, my life,
I'm more successful now.
He goes, I feel better now.

1934
01:53:46,341 --> 01:53:47,870
I'm happier now.
He goes,

1935
01:53:47,871 --> 01:53:51,980
I would never thought that being nicer
people like on purpose and then tipping,

1936
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,920
like being nice and generous
would make me feel so much better.

1937
01:53:55,550 --> 01:53:58,880
It's been a lot of that and sue people
that you really did save my life.

1938
01:53:58,881 --> 01:54:01,010
Like I kind of point in my life
where I wanted to kill myself.

1939
01:54:01,011 --> 01:54:04,540
And you guys really have like shook
me out of that. Yeah. Look, I,

1940
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:08,660
I've had moments in my life when I haven't
been happy when I felt like shit and

1941
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:11,720
then I have now or I could not be happier.

1942
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:16,820
And when I look at my life, what, what
has changed physically in my body?

1943
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:21,150
Well actually I've gotten
older. So thinking about my
past and my, you know, my,

1944
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:24,170
my history of martial arts and all that,
my bubbe, my body should be a mess.

1945
01:54:24,171 --> 01:54:27,710
So it should be in pain all the time. I
should be, you know, you know what I mean?

1946
01:54:27,711 --> 01:54:32,150
Like I shouldn't feel better and more
happy and vibrant today than before.

1947
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:33,470
So why do, why? Well,

1948
01:54:33,471 --> 01:54:36,200
one of the reasons why is because I
don't have any negative shit in my life

1949
01:54:36,201 --> 01:54:39,740
anymore. I don't have any bad people
in my life. I don't have a bad job.

1950
01:54:39,741 --> 01:54:42,890
I don't have any negative thing I'm
going to anything's, I'm trying to avoid.

1951
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:47,720
And when you don't have anything you're
trying to avoid, you have happiness.

1952
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:51,350
And it takes a while for
people to recognize that your,

1953
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:54,470
there's a direct correlation between
your state of mind and your state of

1954
01:54:54,471 --> 01:54:58,820
existence. And if you get both of them
in line, you get both of them in line.

1955
01:54:58,821 --> 01:55:03,050
You can have a good fucking life. You
don't have to be rich. Rich is bullshit.

1956
01:55:03,051 --> 01:55:04,970
That's not what's important.
You know what you have to do.

1957
01:55:04,971 --> 01:55:06,710
You have to have enough money
so you don't have to worry.

1958
01:55:07,550 --> 01:55:10,580
Have enough money so that you can feed
yourself so that you can take care of

1959
01:55:10,581 --> 01:55:14,430
your, your family. That's what you need.
When you get crazy and you want, you know,

1960
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:18,800
stacks of money and big,
that's just another form of obsession.

1961
01:55:18,801 --> 01:55:21,620
You might as well just be jerking off
until you put blisters on your deck.

1962
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:27,080
The keyed, all this shit is balance.
You know, the key to the whole thing.

1963
01:55:27,081 --> 01:55:29,780
It's balanced and it's a
constant struggle. If I've,

1964
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:33,980
if I slip for a couple of
weeks, if I don't go in the
tank for a couple of weeks,

1965
01:55:33,981 --> 01:55:37,940
if I don't write for a couple of weeks,
if I can go a week without working out,

1966
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:42,970
anytime I do anything where I throw off
the balance and I don't do the work that

1967
01:55:43,411 --> 01:55:44,160
I'm supposed to put

1968
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:48,360
in, I feel the difference.
I feel, I feel less, less,

1969
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:53,010
uh, less capable when I sit down
and write again. I feel less,

1970
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:57,750
less vibrant. Uh, when I train, I
don't feel as good when I go on stage,

1971
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,560
but that's not my fucking, very
rarely, like, I don't know,

1972
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:04,830
hardly ever take a week off of standup
anymore. It's like I can't even,

1973
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:08,940
even one week I have to go up and,
and, and, and, and, and kill it.

1974
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:13,020
I have to go up and throw
my new shit out there.

1975
01:56:13,021 --> 01:56:17,010
I have to go up and record it and go back
and listen to it. If I don't do that,

1976
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,710
I feel like I'm wasting something.
I feel like,

1977
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:25,040
I feel like I have been gifted with an
incredible opportunity and incredible

1978
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:29,040
moment in time and incredible,
just very,

1979
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:33,540
just an incredibly fortunate
and fortuitous roll the
dice and I feel like it's

1980
01:56:33,541 --> 01:56:38,100
an insult to the gods if you enjoy,
you know, you, you enjoy that,

1981
01:56:38,101 --> 01:56:41,760
but then you neglect it and you let it
rot away when you got it right there.

1982
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:45,270
You know what I'm saying? It's like
when I get on stage now when I'm,

1983
01:56:45,271 --> 01:56:48,330
when I'm at my best and you know,

1984
01:56:48,331 --> 01:56:51,960
and I'm killing and people came to see
the show and they'd come out to the show

1985
01:56:51,961 --> 01:56:54,570
and they say, oh my God, my stomach hurt.

1986
01:56:54,571 --> 01:56:56,880
And it was the funniest shit
I was so thank you so much.

1987
01:56:56,881 --> 01:57:00,000
We had the greatest time. You know
what? One of the things I'm thinking,

1988
01:57:00,001 --> 01:57:03,170
thank God they had a great time.
That's good. Boy, I'm so happy to,

1989
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:06,180
the next thing I'm thinking
is I got to keep doing this.

1990
01:57:06,410 --> 01:57:10,020
Like I have an obligation like,
cause I this it's not,

1991
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:14,010
it takes a long time to reach a
state of proficiency at something.

1992
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:17,400
It takes an even longer
time to develop an audience.

1993
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:22,200
It takes an even longer time to actually
get a message out there that might

1994
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:26,280
change the way people think.
And when you combine all of them together,

1995
01:57:26,490 --> 01:57:29,540
that's what I, when I say that I think
it's bigger than all of us. I do,

1996
01:57:29,541 --> 01:57:33,930
I feel like I, I, it's uh, it's something
that started and I got to keep going.

1997
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:36,600
There's no way. You know, like
people's don't ever stop the podcast.

1998
01:57:36,650 --> 01:57:39,450
Like I don't think I can,
I don't think it's legal.

1999
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:42,660
I don't think the laws of the
universe wouldn't allow it. You know,

2000
01:57:42,810 --> 01:57:45,990
it sounds pretentious, but
for real. But that's just,

2001
01:57:45,991 --> 01:57:49,440
that's the hundred percent honest way
how I feel about the whole situation.

2002
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:51,230
I feel like we just,
we,

2003
01:57:51,310 --> 01:57:55,530
we lit a spark and we started something
and now we're like the keepers of the

2004
01:57:55,531 --> 01:57:58,050
flame and everybody adds
to this fucking thing.

2005
01:57:58,051 --> 01:58:02,850
It's like people are constantly tweeting
things and sending things and offering

2006
01:58:02,851 --> 01:58:05,040
suggestions and,
and you know,

2007
01:58:05,041 --> 01:58:09,060
coming to shows and being enthusiastic
and in pumping like you remember when you

2008
01:58:09,061 --> 01:58:12,830
came to Atlanta? When I, when I filmed
my a special Atlanta. How, what,

2009
01:58:12,831 --> 01:58:15,480
what the fuck was that like wandering
around with all these people?

2010
01:58:15,481 --> 01:58:20,160
Thousands and thousands of people.
Everybody's friendly, everybody's happy.

2011
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:26,010
There's a very specific vibe to all
these shows and something that me and Ari

2012
01:58:26,011 --> 01:58:28,350
were talking about when we were
up in Canada. He goes, wow,

2013
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:31,230
the crowd up there was great.
And almost like they were awesome man.

2014
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:34,980
But when was the last time we had a
shit crowd does not happening anymore.

2015
01:58:35,010 --> 01:58:39,300
It's like you're getting the same
type of people everywhere you go.

2016
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:42,520
Do you ever worry about uh,
getting a Dui?

2017
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:46,350
Uh, sure. Because that's why I
don't drink. No, I know. But, uh,

2018
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:48,640
just for the point that like you can't,

2019
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:51,870
is that true that you cannot go
to Canada after you have a Dui?

2020
01:58:52,450 --> 01:58:56,110
Can you imagine that though? Like for
you? Yeah, that would be like, hey,

2021
01:58:56,350 --> 01:58:58,200
no more fucking, you know, that just,

2022
01:58:58,610 --> 01:59:02,530
you just got a huge job cut or salary cut.
That would suck.

2023
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,350
You would have to hire a lawyer to try
to get you in and then you'd have to

2024
01:59:05,351 --> 01:59:06,820
probably make some restitution,

2025
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:10,690
but they just don't want any douche
bags up there. That's insane. Yeah,

2026
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:14,560
it's insane. But I understand
that Canada is so fucking Nice.

2027
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:16,820
People are so nice up there.
They're,

2028
01:59:16,821 --> 01:59:21,400
they're insanely inflammatory
with their niceness.

2029
01:59:21,430 --> 01:59:24,880
It's like, it's like Jesus, you've
read what do you real slow down,

2030
01:59:24,910 --> 01:59:29,170
turn this down and what's
going on. You don't, you don't
even realize it. You know,

2031
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:31,970
when, when you're, when you're around, uh,

2032
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:35,230
like especially big city Americans,
you know,

2033
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:38,350
it's so rare that you
find like really outgoing,

2034
01:59:38,351 --> 01:59:41,550
friendly people and then you
go to somewhere like Calgary
or something like that.

2035
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:46,600
Everyone's friendly. You go to Vancouver
and everyone's friendly, you know? I mean,

2036
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:48,730
a friend of mine was talking
about that in a bar that he were,

2037
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:53,610
they were doing standup in Vancouver
and they were at a bar and a girls will

2038
01:59:53,611 --> 01:59:56,020
like, hey, where are you from? And
they're like, why you talking to us?

2039
01:59:56,021 --> 01:59:58,660
What's going on? What are you doing?
He goes, we thought it was a trick.

2040
01:59:58,661 --> 01:59:59,920
Like there were hookers or something.

2041
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:03,910
Like girls are just saying hi coming up
and saying hi girls in America don't do

2042
02:00:03,911 --> 02:00:06,730
that. That's rare as fuck.
They're nicer up there, man.

2043
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:11,680
They don't have that conquer mentality.
They don't have this, uh, America.

2044
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:17,200
You know that, that when
you're from the best, you know,

2045
02:00:17,201 --> 02:00:19,840
and you can talk all the shit
you want about other empires,

2046
02:00:19,841 --> 02:00:21,520
but they can all suck America's Dick.

2047
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:25,810
There's never been anything like America
as far as the, you know, we're lucky,

2048
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:28,390
you know, as far as, I mean, I guess
you want to look at it that way,

2049
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:32,920
that we were born here in this,
this crazy machine.

2050
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:37,900
But if you look at like empires, like
the Roman Empire, the Persian empire,

2051
02:00:37,901 --> 02:00:40,450
any empires that like
tried to conquer the world,

2052
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:45,480
nobody did nothing like what we're doing
and we're denying that we're an empire.

2053
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:49,690
We're like right in the middle of it
military presence in over a hundred

2054
02:00:49,691 --> 02:00:53,770
different countries and we're like, you
know, we're just just trying to be nice.

2055
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,660
You know when you have that kind of a
country and it's just so much military

2056
02:00:58,661 --> 02:01:03,550
power and the whole world kind of like
think about how many assholes just act

2057
02:01:03,551 --> 02:01:05,650
like Douche bags because their team wins.

2058
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:09,070
You know like when the Lakers win the
championships and dudes are driving,

2059
02:01:09,071 --> 02:01:13,540
I was treated well number one pitch
pitch and you don't even know the Lakers

2060
02:01:13,541 --> 02:01:14,231
were playing.
You're like,

2061
02:01:14,231 --> 02:01:16,960
what the fuck is going on with these
periods are number one for what?

2062
02:01:16,961 --> 02:01:21,640
What happened while there they choose
the Lakers there. They live in La.

2063
02:01:21,641 --> 02:01:25,510
So there are a number one now.
That's what a lot of people are about.

2064
02:01:25,511 --> 02:01:27,310
America being a military power.

2065
02:01:27,311 --> 02:01:30,130
There's a lot of fuck heads in
this country that are like, they,

2066
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:34,780
they act like extra cocky because
we're this giant military powers.

2067
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:38,560
If they have anything to do with it,
you know, wouldn't know but won't bitch.

2068
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:40,040
We got the bombs

2069
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:44,180
bitch some backdraft last night.
Remember that? No, he didn't.

2070
02:01:44,580 --> 02:01:45,570
The Kurt Russell.
Yeah.

2071
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:50,000
And you remember like how paranoid you
were to open your front door for like two

2072
02:01:50,001 --> 02:01:53,840
weeks. The whole movie was
about fucking backdraft.

2073
02:01:53,841 --> 02:01:54,800
I remember just sitting there like,

2074
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:58,370
like touching my door real quick and like
spitting on it and made a movie about

2075
02:01:58,371 --> 02:02:02,310
fire.
Gone through doorways really fast.

2076
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:04,400
Who gives a shit about backdraft
now is what I'm saying.

2077
02:02:04,401 --> 02:02:07,970
It's like I'd never think about backdraft
but yeah. When does that come up?

2078
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:11,720
When was your last backdraft
fire? Scariest. Fucked all man.

2079
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:15,740
It's weird that we got this thing that
we control and we don't even think about

2080
02:02:15,741 --> 02:02:18,680
it. It's just, you know, light
it with you. You know, you
can buy it anywhere you go.

2081
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:22,550
Think about how irresponsible people are
and then thinking about the fact that

2082
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:26,540
we got fire in our pocket. We have
fire in your pockets. It's amazing.

2083
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:31,250
There's not way more fires then there are.
Look at this fire.

2084
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:35,360
We're just sitting around here talking.
I got a fire. That's crazy. Yeah.

2085
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:40,460
We're so stupid that could burn a whole
city down. I think I'm fucking stupid.

2086
02:02:40,461 --> 02:02:42,500
We are. And the fact that you
could go to a corner drug store,

2087
02:02:42,501 --> 02:02:45,560
give me 10 of those and just kid
10 of them go to the liquor store.

2088
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:49,100
Give me some lighter fluid. Yeah. And you
can just light shit on fire everywhere.

2089
02:02:49,101 --> 02:02:54,101
It's amazing when you really think about
the potential for damage with all the

2090
02:02:54,471 --> 02:02:57,600
shit that we have, how little things
actually get damaged. And now,

2091
02:02:57,610 --> 02:03:02,330
especially with fire. Yeah. Have
you ever been in a big fire?

2092
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:07,850
Um, were you around when the
uh, the big, uh, brush fires?

2093
02:03:07,870 --> 02:03:09,020
Yeah. Did you see any of that? Yeah,

2094
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:11,900
I've been here and like when I lived in
Calabasas, when I first moved out here,

2095
02:03:11,901 --> 02:03:14,300
there was no,
that's writers and members get evacuated.

2096
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:16,340
I remember we were on the road,

2097
02:03:16,550 --> 02:03:20,210
I think that real men of comedy tour or
something like that. Yeah. Fire was there.

2098
02:03:20,211 --> 02:03:24,770
And my ex fiance at the time had to
pack up our whole entire apartment and

2099
02:03:24,771 --> 02:03:28,250
because she got it back. Yeah, that's
right. And that's right. So bad.

2100
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:31,640
It's like she's just like, where do I
go? I'm like, I have no idea at all.

2101
02:03:31,641 --> 02:03:35,030
It's scary as fuck man. When when we, we,

2102
02:03:35,031 --> 02:03:38,690
I've been evacuated twice and
where I used to live in Colorado,

2103
02:03:38,691 --> 02:03:41,780
that burnt down to, and not the
house, but that area burnt down too.

2104
02:03:41,781 --> 02:03:45,140
They lost like something like
hundreds and hundreds of houses.

2105
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:49,490
It was some insane amount of
acreage to got burnt down.

2106
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:53,360
The reality is once those motherfuckers
get started, especially out here,

2107
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:57,750
it's so dry fires start like
right now it starts right now,

2108
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,860
June 1st is the time where we
have to have brush clearance.

2109
02:04:00,890 --> 02:04:04,700
So you're supposed to clear out all the
dead shit and the brush and you know,

2110
02:04:04,701 --> 02:04:05,900
people get fined for that.

2111
02:04:05,901 --> 02:04:10,190
It's a big deal because some asshole
doesn't take care of his lawn, you know,

2112
02:04:10,191 --> 02:04:10,490
and you,

2113
02:04:10,490 --> 02:04:14,390
you let the brush pile up and all of
a sudden you've got a really dangerous

2114
02:04:14,391 --> 02:04:16,910
situation.
If anything flies and lands on it.

2115
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:21,560
That's what fucks them up is these fires.
They start in the embers,

2116
02:04:21,561 --> 02:04:25,790
float through the air and then the embers
will land on some dry grass and poof,

2117
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:30,230
there's a new fire and
that's the epicenter of a
new fire and it just fucking,

2118
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:34,100
the wind takes that bitch and carries
those flames and that lights a tree on

2119
02:04:34,101 --> 02:04:37,950
fire and the embers from that fly up
and they catches some other area. Yeah.

2120
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:42,000
That's a fucking pain in the ass man.
It's hard.

2121
02:04:42,001 --> 02:04:44,790
They got a circle of drop
water on him and shit.

2122
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:48,160
Have you ever seen them scoop down
and get the water? Yeah, because uh,

2123
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:51,600
when there was fires in Burbank is,
I also experienced when in Burbank,

2124
02:04:51,601 --> 02:04:55,230
there was a fire at the Hollywood
mountain two years ago or a year ago and I

2125
02:04:55,231 --> 02:04:58,390
guess there's a big water scoop for
helicopters on the top of the mountain.

2126
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:01,530
They just sat there and watched
him scoop out of like a big pool,

2127
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:04,200
like a swimming pool. Most.
When I first came here,

2128
02:05:04,201 --> 02:05:08,610
there was a big fire in the Hollywood
hills, so it fucking really nice area.

2129
02:05:08,630 --> 02:05:11,760
The Hollywood hills. And we were
watching it from the Virgin Mega store.

2130
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:15,360
There was that little area out
front with like Wolfgang Puck's.

2131
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:17,340
I don't know if it still is there,
but it used to be there.

2132
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:22,620
We were sitting there watching these
helicopters drop fire on this building and

2133
02:05:22,621 --> 02:05:25,440
I just kept thinking like what
a strange world we live in,

2134
02:05:25,441 --> 02:05:29,640
where we take something like fire for
granted and here it is just eating its way

2135
02:05:29,641 --> 02:05:30,474
through the earth,

2136
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:33,900
this energy source and everybody's
freaking out and drop and things on it and

2137
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:37,710
try to stop it and really inadequate,
really ineffective.

2138
02:05:37,711 --> 02:05:41,190
Like it takes a long time to put
out a fucking fire. They're trying,

2139
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:44,480
but they have these giant fucking planes.
They have to go down,

2140
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:47,140
scoop up the water,
fly over and poop.

2141
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:51,210
It's like they shoot a little tiny water
load on the fire and then right back to

2142
02:05:51,211 --> 02:05:51,391
it.

2143
02:05:51,391 --> 02:05:56,250
It takes a long fucking time to actually
put the fire out and most likely some

2144
02:05:56,251 --> 02:05:58,770
houses are going to get jacked and
there's nothing they could do about it.

2145
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:02,580
And all those houses inside
of them have electricity.

2146
02:06:02,790 --> 02:06:06,420
This other crazy power thing that we
totally take for granted is fucking

2147
02:06:06,421 --> 02:06:11,421
pulsating energy through the wires of
the House that powers your Internet and

2148
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:13,330
that was your fucking lights and,

2149
02:06:14,070 --> 02:06:19,070
and our life would suck tremendous cock
if we didn't have it or it might be

2150
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:24,300
completely amazing. I would be amazing
cause it'd be really cool. It'd be fresh.

2151
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:28,080
More people would have sex.
I'm hard to get healthy meat.

2152
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:31,080
You have to kill things that day.
It's annoying as fuck.

2153
02:06:31,710 --> 02:06:34,980
Imagine you have to kill
fish and animals that day.

2154
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:37,680
That's the only way your whole life
would be about hunting and gathering.

2155
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:42,270
Once you cut out the electricity,
it's really difficult to
store things. You know?

2156
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:43,240
It's hard.
You can,

2157
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:46,230
you got to go with cattle and then
you've got to make sure if you kill it,

2158
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:49,530
you eat all of it. So you have to
calculate how many people are here,

2159
02:06:49,531 --> 02:06:51,990
who's working and going to make
sure everybody's doing their part.

2160
02:06:51,990 --> 02:06:55,050
To get a piece of this animal,
I'm going to kill another one tomorrow.

2161
02:06:55,410 --> 02:06:59,130
And how long have you lived
in a place like California?

2162
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:03,510
And it was the summertime. How long
does an animal last once you kill it?

2163
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:08,590
I'd probably give it 24 hours.
Really think 24 hours. Yeah,

2164
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:12,960
I think it would be rotten. It's
fucking 24 hours, man. Maybe not.

2165
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:15,540
But in this heat when it's
like 90 degrees outside,

2166
02:07:15,541 --> 02:07:17,490
I gotta think that animal's
going to be a mass.

2167
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:21,630
Well if you wrap it up and come
or a leaf or something like that,

2168
02:07:22,730 --> 02:07:26,390
that's come the new preservative
that you're using. Well I tried it.

2169
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:30,750
I tried Kumon didn't work so I as well.
Let's just try comment. Sounds like it.

2170
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:35,040
It's cool. And even a
preservative. No, it's a spice
that choked. Didn't make sense.

2171
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:36,040
I

2172
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,270
don't fuck are you saying
so tomorrow night we are um,

2173
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:44,800
live at the ice house
and a eight 30 and uh,

2174
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:49,500
who's on the line? I'm so far. Uh,
we got Brody Stevens, franchisers,

2175
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:53,710
Tony Hinchcliffe,
Randy leaky fucking funny man.

2176
02:07:53,711 --> 02:07:58,090
That kid has got some great jokes. He's
really good. He's a really good IA writer.

2177
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:03,170
He made me laugh. Jeffrey Ross hired
him for a reason. How dare you.

2178
02:08:03,660 --> 02:08:08,350
Dare you. Try to pretend he wrote those
jokes. Yeah, guys, when they're writing,

2179
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:12,550
when they're doing like, um, roast and
shit like that. And that's when, you know,

2180
02:08:12,551 --> 02:08:16,450
there's a lot of comics that make a good
living just doing writing and punch up

2181
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:19,870
or stuff like that. You know what's weird
is that I, I don't even realize this,

2182
02:08:19,871 --> 02:08:21,220
but like two of my good friends,

2183
02:08:21,221 --> 02:08:24,860
Pete and Tony who both help us out on
almost every ice house chronicles there

2184
02:08:24,861 --> 02:08:28,360
are both from Ohio and they're like,
that's weird that I'm almost,

2185
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:32,030
I feel like I'm getting, you're
pushing the boredom. Yeah.

2186
02:08:32,050 --> 02:08:34,990
Because of the cause of Ohio,
but kind of grew up the same.

2187
02:08:34,991 --> 02:08:38,600
You all have stunted emotional
development. It's amazing. You'll,

2188
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:42,090
you'll get all be children
forever together. Yeah.

2189
02:08:43,270 --> 02:08:47,020
It is a weird thing how you, you,
you sort of like where you grew up,

2190
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:51,070
that's like sorta like hanging out
with Boston people you hang out with,

2191
02:08:51,071 --> 02:08:52,650
you know,
all these Boston comics.

2192
02:08:52,710 --> 02:08:55,330
Speaking of which Bill Burns
doing the podcast next Thursday.

2193
02:08:55,870 --> 02:08:59,330
So make sure you get up on
your RSS feed knowledge and

2194
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:05,200
love Melbourne. I love bill bird too.
I wonder if he's still mad at stitcher.

2195
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:08,170
I doubt it if they all given up on that.

2196
02:09:08,171 --> 02:09:11,230
I think they've all come back to stitch
sugar cause are a lot of them have been

2197
02:09:11,231 --> 02:09:15,280
coming back to stitcher because
they're realizing it's Corolla. Yeah.

2198
02:09:15,281 --> 02:09:18,580
He's always been on stitcher. He's
been a stitcher Darlin for of our time.

2199
02:09:18,610 --> 02:09:22,840
But he does his commercials like he does
him live and he does them in the moment.

2200
02:09:22,841 --> 02:09:23,441
Like he,

2201
02:09:23,441 --> 02:09:27,370
he'll like break for commercial in the
middle of his podcast and it's several

2202
02:09:27,371 --> 02:09:31,120
points. Yeah. Radio. He does a
radio format that notice total hop.

2203
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:36,280
So he doesn't have to like, they don't
need to like splice in ads on him.

2204
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:38,890
You know his ass get out
there no matter what.

2205
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:42,340
If stitch or takes the feed and sends it,
his ads get out there.

2206
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:46,840
So it's not like I'm serious.
For example, we're our, our,

2207
02:09:47,290 --> 02:09:50,860
our show when it goes to serious,
they cut out the flashlight. Weird.

2208
02:09:50,861 --> 02:09:54,250
Every time I hear that it's
so weird. Strange. I'll get,

2209
02:09:54,251 --> 02:09:56,770
cause I always have it on either, you
know, stern it opening Anthea channel.

2210
02:09:56,771 --> 02:09:59,650
I'll turn on my car and just hear myself
talking about it confuses the fuck out

2211
02:09:59,651 --> 02:10:01,510
and me like, whoa. Yeah.

2212
02:10:01,511 --> 02:10:04,360
It's weird when you don't expect
to hear yourself and hear yourself.

2213
02:10:04,361 --> 02:10:07,100
That's really weird. I'm like, that
sounds like me. Wait, that is my,

2214
02:10:08,420 --> 02:10:10,990
do you sound like an idiot?
Do you listen to yourself and get mad?

2215
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:14,260
Fuck saying probably old ones.
I did

2216
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:19,360
because that's changed about you.
How have you gotten better at podcasting?

2217
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:24,140
Because I, I'm not trying to just be
as goofy and stupid as possible anyway,

2218
02:10:24,150 --> 02:10:27,580
you do that as a almost like a girl,

2219
02:10:27,850 --> 02:10:31,450
you know that's at a party and no one's
paying attention to her so you'll do

2220
02:10:31,451 --> 02:10:33,350
something nutty because I like,

2221
02:10:33,351 --> 02:10:37,180
I act like I was acting like how
I act like you know, drunk. We,

2222
02:10:37,181 --> 02:10:39,610
I'm hanging out with my friends
instead of just saying like, oh,

2223
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:43,280
people are listening to me actually
talked. You know what I mean? Right.

2224
02:10:43,730 --> 02:10:45,010
Well then you had to hear though.

2225
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:48,090
Here's something weird that happened to
me last night. I wanted to talk about it.

2226
02:10:48,100 --> 02:10:49,070
It's kind of the same way.

2227
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:54,740
I had this weird thing happened to me the
last two days where I have been giggly

2228
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:59,860
and silly and fucking really high
energy and like really happy,

2229
02:11:00,411 --> 02:11:02,360
like giggly,
happy.

2230
02:11:02,450 --> 02:11:04,970
Like I was running around poking
people with straws last night,

2231
02:11:04,971 --> 02:11:06,240
like a little kid and then,

2232
02:11:06,570 --> 02:11:08,750
and then it just went away and then
come back to normal. And I was like,

2233
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:10,370
what was that all about?

2234
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:14,800
They get almost felt like there was some
kind of government up in me for now.

2235
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:19,190
You want to remote control. It was
fear way to tune into your frequency.

2236
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:22,390
It was weird though cause it was like,
have I been going through like a uh,

2237
02:11:22,650 --> 02:11:26,360
a long time, that pressure and that was
just like a bump out of it, you know,

2238
02:11:26,361 --> 02:11:30,860
or something like that. Or have I been
like, you know, lacking something in my,

2239
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:32,930
in my head or diet or something like that.

2240
02:11:32,931 --> 02:11:37,100
And I just had whatever had like a
normalcy for awhile because I felt like,

2241
02:11:37,101 --> 02:11:41,300
I was like, wow, if I felt like this every
day I would fucking love life. You know,

2242
02:11:41,301 --> 02:11:44,420
like crazy. He should on
every day. Yeah, I guess so,

2243
02:11:44,421 --> 02:11:47,540
but like how do you even explain that?
Like you can't like rewind, like, Hey,

2244
02:11:47,541 --> 02:11:51,020
can you look at my database files? You
know, and tell me what was going on there.

2245
02:11:52,040 --> 02:11:54,260
Yeah. It could have been a lot
of different things all at once,

2246
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:58,760
but it was unnecessary and came out of
nowhere. I mean, it's probably good.

2247
02:11:58,990 --> 02:12:02,000
Oh yeah, it was great. But I
don't feel I got right now.

2248
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:06,440
But you,
she can't always feel like that was like,

2249
02:12:06,441 --> 02:12:09,560
you want the good feelings to
just come to you instead of you.

2250
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:12,860
Her felt that in how long it, like it
was one of those things. It's like,

2251
02:12:12,861 --> 02:12:14,210
holy shit man,
this is crazy.

2252
02:12:14,211 --> 02:12:16,790
I feel like fucking like I'm on
ecstasy right now for no reason.

2253
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:20,750
You haven't felt like that in a while.
I mean, it was weird. It was just like,

2254
02:12:20,751 --> 02:12:24,410
it happened last night and I was just
like silly and giggly for no reason.

2255
02:12:24,411 --> 02:12:28,640
Like I was sober and I was just
running around being crazy.

2256
02:12:29,330 --> 02:12:34,100
Huh? It was great. So while I'm
setting up this new studio by the,

2257
02:12:34,101 --> 02:12:38,660
by, we're working on everything right
now. So I'm started pricing out, you know,

2258
02:12:38,930 --> 02:12:42,050
equipment and getting
everything ready in place.

2259
02:12:42,051 --> 02:12:44,120
I was going to have a raw cement floor,

2260
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:48,820
but I realize that sound wise going
to be good. So I'm going to go with,

2261
02:12:49,090 --> 02:12:51,500
go with rubber rubber,
rubber floor. You know,

2262
02:12:51,501 --> 02:12:55,100
like when you have like an a gym
locker room or I shouldn't be fun.

2263
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:59,850
It'd be comfortable, be great
for sound. Maybe like the chores,

2264
02:13:00,110 --> 02:13:03,770
that shit in my garage, my gym
that I drop weights on. Right.

2265
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:06,650
That might not be a bad idea.
That way if we drop some phones and Shit,

2266
02:13:06,651 --> 02:13:11,150
they won't get broken. Right. I was
actually thinking of going with um, uh,

2267
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:15,410
office carpeting, but that rubber floor
might be better recycle tire floor.

2268
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:19,670
Although it's a, it's a con to
clean. Yeah. It's not fun to clean,

2269
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:22,310
so don't be jizzing on
my fucking rubber floor.

2270
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:27,680
What about like a floor that
they use in like, uh, like a gym,

2271
02:13:27,830 --> 02:13:32,220
like racquetball. Racquetball
is hard. Hardwood floors

2272
02:13:33,110 --> 02:13:36,580
and that's a real echoey room. Aramco
ballroom when you want a soft things.

2273
02:13:36,581 --> 02:13:41,400
So with the carpet absorbs and do you
want to put stuff on the walls like a

2274
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:46,140
Corolla joint. He's got
um, like these big cloth,

2275
02:13:46,170 --> 02:13:46,560
uh,

2276
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:51,420
ace broadcasting banners that are
framed and they absorb, you know,

2277
02:13:51,421 --> 02:13:52,770
they're,
they're framed and it's,

2278
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:57,880
it's like screen printed are silk screened
onto the cloth and then it's framed.

2279
02:13:58,550 --> 02:14:03,510
So it's his banner, several different
places and that absorbs the sound.

2280
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:08,130
But it might actually be cool just
to have, um, just, uh, I liked those,

2281
02:14:08,131 --> 02:14:12,150
those soundproof little cone things,
you know what I'm saying? Like that uh,

2282
02:14:12,850 --> 02:14:16,560
goes panels with like individual little
cones and I'm like hundreds of cones.

2283
02:14:16,561 --> 02:14:20,780
Yeah. Egg Cartons. Exactly. Put
that shit on the wall. But um,

2284
02:14:20,810 --> 02:14:21,840
I'm trying to find,

2285
02:14:21,841 --> 02:14:24,540
and this is where people out in
the Twitter verse can help me.

2286
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:28,380
I'm trying to find what's the best
office chairs. These are kind of cool.

2287
02:14:28,410 --> 02:14:29,760
I like these.
These are all right,

2288
02:14:29,850 --> 02:14:32,410
but when I sit back on him
some to get this net ones now,

2289
02:14:32,411 --> 02:14:33,540
if you want to get the best ones,

2290
02:14:33,541 --> 02:14:36,810
sell those the best fucking thousand
dollar net ones. While men mailer.

2291
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:40,620
How dare they the fuck. How did
they hack the, the mainframe?

2292
02:14:40,860 --> 02:14:45,720
I had to turn it back on because our,
our phone went off and went off. No,

2293
02:14:45,721 --> 02:14:48,240
I got rid of that feature.
Hold on. It's a good future.

2294
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:54,090
Um,
this is super old school podcast.

2295
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:59,000
If had Internet connection problems.
We've had old phone calls. Yeah.

2296
02:14:59,010 --> 02:15:03,460
This is as old schools. We can guys
need to talk about trailer vixen. Oh,

2297
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:08,160
Gary, you can't, you let
it go son. And you should,

2298
02:15:08,190 --> 02:15:12,360
the way you should look at
that relationship is that
there's no way you should

2299
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:14,580
be able to fuck girls like that in
real life. I have no problems with her.

2300
02:15:14,581 --> 02:15:19,080
She's fine. Okay, good. Beautiful.
So whatever craziness you gotta say,

2301
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:23,700
you gotta say to yourself, why? Of course
there was craziness. She was fucking me.

2302
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:27,810
How could she not be crazy?
You've got to look at it that way.

2303
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:32,460
Make girls go crazy. Yeah. You
sent her crazy and she wasn't,

2304
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:34,340
she has to be crazy to be
fucking you in the first,

2305
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:37,840
but she should be fucking some
giant supermodel dude. Right? Crazy.

2306
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:42,330
I don't do websites that good.
Is that what it is? How dare you?

2307
02:15:42,331 --> 02:15:45,720
You're going inside inside knowledge
for folks at home. This is again,

2308
02:15:45,721 --> 02:15:48,290
just like the old pot attending.

2309
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:52,920
The one's listening as a fucking million.
Oh Brian,

2310
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:57,680
we got to get those O'Brian tee shirts
made. We keep promising those. Yes. Um,

2311
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:02,220
but so anybody who has any um,
insight is to like, what's the best,

2312
02:16:02,221 --> 02:16:04,500
most comfortable chairs within reason?

2313
02:16:05,550 --> 02:16:08,430
I guess probably those gravity
chairs from relaxed to back.

2314
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:12,690
Those would be kind of dope.
All massage chairs from Spencer gifts,

2315
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:16,290
but they make too much noise.
You'd be in the middle of the podcast,

2316
02:16:16,291 --> 02:16:20,910
the Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Yeah.
They probably make them say no,

2317
02:16:20,970 --> 02:16:23,520
they're not quiet. I mean
they're, they're fairly quiet.

2318
02:16:23,521 --> 02:16:26,940
I think it does water massagers where
you like lay in and your head sticks out.

2319
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:30,070
Fuck. Those things are ridiculous.
You have to have like an engine

2320
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:32,170
that pushes all that water around,
doesn't it like a pump?

2321
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:35,440
I don't know if it ever got one of
those. It must be, must be loud as fuck.

2322
02:16:35,441 --> 02:16:37,360
How could it not be?
It's a mechanical thing,

2323
02:16:37,361 --> 02:16:39,970
something spinning around and
a lot of movement, you know,

2324
02:16:39,971 --> 02:16:44,080
you're forcing all that water
through, but I think, um, they, uh,

2325
02:16:44,081 --> 02:16:47,230
they have some other chairs that are
like these gravity chairs and lean back,

2326
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:51,740
I think to like more than a
thousand bucks each. There's, um,

2327
02:16:51,790 --> 02:16:55,840
there's gotta be something that's like
a decent chair that's like comfortable.

2328
02:16:55,960 --> 02:16:58,270
I don't know if office
chairs are the way to go.

2329
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:03,260
I love these shows are really good.
It seems like office chairs. Oh,

2330
02:17:03,261 --> 02:17:06,670
for the most support. Right.
I think obviously there's
other way to go. I never,

2331
02:17:06,671 --> 02:17:09,220
I mean, couches and other
kinds of chairs are always,

2332
02:17:09,221 --> 02:17:13,390
seemed like I've tried almost everything.
You know, we started off with couch.

2333
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:17,520
Yeah. I think we started off with
the couch that was super whack. Uh,

2334
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:20,410
then we had some other couch.
Seems like it would work,

2335
02:17:20,680 --> 02:17:23,790
but then it's annoying to sit on the
couch. What would be the best that,

2336
02:17:23,791 --> 02:17:27,490
I mean the ultimate, what's the
house? We all had lazy boys.

2337
02:17:28,060 --> 02:17:31,700
That is the ultimate. Right. Do you,
have you been to a lazy boy? I store it.

2338
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:34,370
They've done a lot of
good shit with lazy boy.

2339
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:38,190
Would that really be the best
we can all have lazy boy.

2340
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:40,990
I have a laptop right on our lab.
Fucking on the side.

2341
02:17:40,991 --> 02:17:43,570
We have our fucking little
places for our drinks.

2342
02:17:43,571 --> 02:17:46,810
You know you could easily
do that. If we're going to
do it might as well be most.

2343
02:17:46,811 --> 02:17:48,610
How much does the lazy boy cost?
It's much.

2344
02:17:48,790 --> 02:17:52,600
Let's find out the lazy boys start
off probably around 300 bucks even.

2345
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:55,780
But I mean getting us some
pimp. Lazy boy, Dude, lazy boy.

2346
02:17:55,781 --> 02:17:59,710
It makes them good couches and
everything now. Lazy Boy Rico. Wow.

2347
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:04,740
$2,584 boy store to look at that shit.

2348
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:11,100
No, no, not that. That's old school.
Lazy boy. Good to, I think it's lazy.

2349
02:18:11,101 --> 02:18:14,260
Lazy boy.
I'm there@lazyboy.com.

2350
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:18,520
It's la-z-boy.com.

2351
02:18:19,440 --> 02:18:23,110
If you just got a regular laser boy,
it takes you to that one and um,

2352
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:26,110
check out these chairs.
Recliners is what you want to check sites.

2353
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:27,700
There's sites getting crushed.

2354
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:33,250
Wonder if it's us two people at once.
Was too much to people,

2355
02:18:33,730 --> 02:18:36,400
to people and everybody else
online. It was like, yeah,

2356
02:18:36,401 --> 02:18:39,430
let me open up a separate window
here and see what they got.

2357
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:43,530
So these lay reclined all
these reclined, right? Yeah.

2358
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:48,790
Lazy boy recliner. Okay. How much
is this bitch right here? Let's see.

2359
02:18:49,510 --> 02:18:52,700
This is in cloth. Should it be
cloth or leather? Leather boots.

2360
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:55,910
Leather boo fuck cows,
right? Fuck. By the way,

2361
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:59,890
all you silly bitches on my website
forum that really think that, um,

2362
02:18:59,950 --> 02:19:04,660
when I say fuck all the animals that
are really want all the animals to die,

2363
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:08,920
I'm talking Shit folks. Did you ever
talk shit? They have this website.

2364
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:11,830
This website sucks up back x.

2365
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:16,630
So they met four modems that
this website is fucking terrible.

2366
02:19:17,230 --> 02:19:20,830
It's terrible. They show their stupid
things and it's like add to my favorites.

2367
02:19:20,831 --> 02:19:25,210
It doesn't tell you about them. That's
it's show me your chairs. Your fuck ass.

2368
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:30,200
That's a sucky website. Lazy
boy. Your website blows, Dude.

2369
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:33,380
Get off your ass and get a new website.
Fix It on.

2370
02:19:33,381 --> 02:19:35,690
The other guys are lazy.
They're

2371
02:19:38,150 --> 02:19:40,010
just too comfortable to do anything.

2372
02:19:40,011 --> 02:19:43,670
You want to be the official chair of
desk squad West, you'll fuck heads.

2373
02:19:43,671 --> 02:19:47,450
You have to come up with
something better than that.

2374
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:51,350
Well they have some good
products. They look good. Yeah,

2375
02:19:51,540 --> 02:19:54,200
but the websites suck so hard.
It's hard to look at them.

2376
02:19:54,250 --> 02:19:57,710
If Lazy Boys Listening to people
listening to the podcast or doing that.

2377
02:19:57,730 --> 02:20:00,350
I'm dude, he ha, I mean 3000 people or so.

2378
02:20:00,351 --> 02:20:04,010
Just go right to lazy boy.com
at the same time. It probably is

2379
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:10,720
a a I'm retyping pimp lazy boy.

2380
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:16,600
Oh you know there's one I want ostrich
skin cause ostriches a conc fuck conti

2381
02:20:17,060 --> 02:20:21,290
birds. Whoa. These are dope
dude. My pimped out low. Okay.

2382
02:20:21,291 --> 02:20:23,750
I just found it looking at the
sun. Look at this. Look at this.

2383
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:25,760
If we all got those,

2384
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:29,310
you could have like a little fucking
hoes so you could smoke weed. You know,

2385
02:20:29,780 --> 02:20:34,640
decided that laser we Aalto
lazy boy double recliner review.

2386
02:20:34,730 --> 02:20:35,563
Ooh,

2387
02:20:37,670 --> 02:20:39,770
that might not be a bad idea.

2388
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:44,090
And maybe have the table where it comes
like we can just like pull the table out

2389
02:20:44,210 --> 02:20:44,701
or something like,

2390
02:20:44,701 --> 02:20:49,701
so kind of like a 1200 bucks for the
regular ones and then 1900 bucks for the

2391
02:20:50,631 --> 02:20:55,631
ones that are in leather and that
thing looks pretty fucking sporty dude.

2392
02:20:56,390 --> 02:21:00,320
Lazy Boys. And maybe how would that
really be? Would that be annoying? No.

2393
02:21:00,321 --> 02:21:05,120
After like a couple of hours would it,
would it get annoying laying down?

2394
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:07,910
I be awesome. You think so? Yeah. Dude.

2395
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:09,680
Lazy boys are just like
this when you lay back,

2396
02:21:09,681 --> 02:21:13,160
but just imagine more comfortable.
You have your feet up like a gentlemen.

2397
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:16,940
You think that that would be a good
thing for podcast seats though?

2398
02:21:16,941 --> 02:21:20,510
It would suck if I got five lazy
boys and then we decided to blows.

2399
02:21:21,050 --> 02:21:23,180
Well we can and you
can't do just have one.

2400
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:26,360
If it was just like me with a lazy boy
and everybody else would regular chair

2401
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:28,160
fucking Dick,

2402
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:33,590
invite me over your place and sit me
in a fucking staples $50 office chair.

2403
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:36,200
Like you got some lazy boys suck.

2404
02:21:36,201 --> 02:21:40,880
We just moved the death squad east or
whatever. It's called, well, this one,

2405
02:21:42,470 --> 02:21:46,870
this one. Yeah, it does squad
east. It's east. This one is, um,

2406
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:49,700
450 bucks.
That's not bad.

2407
02:21:49,730 --> 02:21:53,020
That's a cloth one was like sides to it.
It looks pretty good.

2408
02:21:53,030 --> 02:21:56,090
I think the only thing that we might
run into is like people falling asleep.

2409
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:59,660
If it gets boring, those bitches that
could write, especially with stoners,

2410
02:22:00,310 --> 02:22:03,860
that could be the issue. Yeah, I do. But
I mean just if you, if you had to ask,

2411
02:22:03,861 --> 02:22:06,230
would I rather sit down for three hours,
uh,

2412
02:22:06,370 --> 02:22:10,610
with your feet up and comfortable
or bouncing on his office chair?

2413
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:14,660
You know, you want a true,
I mean if we wanted to beds,

2414
02:22:14,661 --> 02:22:18,110
we could get single beds each have a
single bed. We'd just all lay there.

2415
02:22:18,650 --> 02:22:22,590
That's the move. Bitch. We should stay.

2416
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:24,980
I'll have her own little blankets
would bring her own Kayla.

2417
02:22:25,700 --> 02:22:28,050
It'd be like nap time,
wherever. Little blankets

2418
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:33,200
and each person can have their
own quotes that, you know,

2419
02:22:33,210 --> 02:22:37,290
fans make and we could have like the red
band quilt have conversations like at

2420
02:22:37,291 --> 02:22:40,110
camp you're lying in bed
and the lights go out. Hey,

2421
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:41,760
you guys really think ghosts are real.

2422
02:22:42,290 --> 02:22:45,210
Well we get the one where we
each have our own fucking number.

2423
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:47,100
What's it tempurpedic
where we have around the,

2424
02:22:47,101 --> 02:22:50,600
although they know the blow one of
air one. Whenever the fuck are they,

2425
02:22:50,601 --> 02:22:55,250
what's their fucking the one where the
the one we were back goes up. Yeah. Those,

2426
02:22:55,251 --> 02:22:57,930
those, the Tempur-Pedic's are the
ones that foam the memory foam.

2427
02:22:57,960 --> 02:23:01,530
That's the good stuff though.
The ones that the blow the air in it.

2428
02:23:01,531 --> 02:23:05,070
Like you can get it harder or softer.
And what your number is those,

2429
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:06,920
I had one of those socks.

2430
02:23:07,070 --> 02:23:10,830
Just get one of the like the hospital bed
ones where we can put it up and we can

2431
02:23:10,831 --> 02:23:12,480
all like we're in a hospital room.

2432
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:16,890
Teeth out would be the commitment if we
all had like hospital beds and we had

2433
02:23:16,891 --> 02:23:20,810
like oxygen just going pumped into us.
Why we're all laying there talking. Yeah.

2434
02:23:21,870 --> 02:23:26,640
The um, this website is going to
keep me from buying a lazy boy.

2435
02:23:27,430 --> 02:23:30,030
No, you need to go to
a lazy boy, uh, store.

2436
02:23:30,031 --> 02:23:33,810
I think there's one here in thousand
oaks or something like that that it maybe

2437
02:23:33,811 --> 02:23:37,980
we get some sort of a deal with lazy boy.
If you're listing goes boy, contact us.

2438
02:23:37,981 --> 02:23:39,930
We'll talk about, we'll,
we'll get you back into that.

2439
02:23:39,931 --> 02:23:41,700
Fucking will blow you back up.
We'll get you in.

2440
02:23:41,970 --> 02:23:45,900
We'll get a real website designer
to call you. Call at you.

2441
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:50,100
This sack of shit you got going on
here where you don't even you guys,

2442
02:23:50,130 --> 02:23:52,740
you silly bitches.
You don't even have prices.

2443
02:23:53,210 --> 02:23:57,270
Like there's no prices on your website.
Right? What kind of nonsense is that?

2444
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:00,300
Store locator,
store locator,

2445
02:24:00,390 --> 02:24:04,320
but there's a website and you
can't buy shit from your website.

2446
02:24:04,710 --> 02:24:06,900
That's ridiculous. Oh, it's
probably because of shipping.

2447
02:24:07,050 --> 02:24:09,810
That's 2000 that's so 2003 yeah.

2448
02:24:09,811 --> 02:24:11,790
Well you can't even ship kettlebells
without being a headache.

2449
02:24:11,820 --> 02:24:14,110
Imagine having shipping,
big old lazy boys. Well,

2450
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:17,700
we can ship kettlebells without being a
headache. It's just a pain in the ass.

2451
02:24:17,850 --> 02:24:22,410
But there's other, there's
countries because a lot of money,

2452
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:27,780
but there's a, this is rather
than that ship, big stuff
like that. Crates, comedies.

2453
02:24:27,850 --> 02:24:32,520
I like restoration hardware. You know they
sent couches in the mail all the time.

2454
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:36,620
Not in the drop ship river.
I wonder if Amazon has lazy boards.

2455
02:24:36,621 --> 02:24:40,770
They have everything now. Him
Aren't. Yup, they do. What?

2456
02:24:41,190 --> 02:24:45,420
From a different seller. Let's see
how much shipping is for lazy boy.

2457
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:51,330
Whoa. Okay. I found it,
dude. You go to Amazon.

2458
02:24:51,331 --> 02:24:56,040
Look at this sweat. This right here. This
professional high back leather, lazy boy.

2459
02:24:56,610 --> 02:25:01,510
Look at this. This, this. This is
what we need, dude. There's no,

2460
02:25:01,511 --> 02:25:04,890
there's no foot leg support. That's
that. That's the thing. We get those.

2461
02:25:04,891 --> 02:25:08,340
We get separate legs. Supports
Fan. That's not the same.

2462
02:25:08,470 --> 02:25:10,800
I know you get a nice ass fat.

2463
02:25:10,801 --> 02:25:13,230
Lazy boy feels like you're just
one has a leg sport. Look at that.

2464
02:25:15,090 --> 02:25:17,220
That's fine. That's not the
same thing I'm talking about.

2465
02:25:17,221 --> 02:25:18,360
The one where you're like,
you know,

2466
02:25:18,440 --> 02:25:21,600
think comes out of the bottom of the
chair and you're like pretty much laying

2467
02:25:21,601 --> 02:25:23,590
down. Yeah. It's just a bomb.

2468
02:25:24,580 --> 02:25:29,200
Yeah. Basically recliner is
what it's called. Yeah, that's,

2469
02:25:29,230 --> 02:25:32,590
he really do have to get a recliner,
Huh? Yeah. Yeah. You can't fuck around.

2470
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:35,230
This is pretty sick though.
This lazy boy chair,

2471
02:25:35,710 --> 02:25:39,040
the presidential hi back swivel chair.

2472
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:42,640
That looks pretty fucking sporty.
Like that looks cool too.

2473
02:25:42,670 --> 02:25:46,030
That will the be like a cool chair to
have in their styles of bucks, man.

2474
02:25:46,090 --> 02:25:50,050
You look at the look, this one's
not a lazy boy, but if you look,

2475
02:25:50,051 --> 02:25:53,710
go look at this one. It's called the
Wickenburg bonded leather rocker,

2476
02:25:53,950 --> 02:25:58,950
recliner and Brown where it's just
a big old puffy lazy boy chair.

2477
02:25:59,021 --> 02:26:01,000
That looks fucking comfortable.
It's fun.

2478
02:26:01,001 --> 02:26:05,210
It looks like something that you sit
in before you suck cock bill. Man.

2479
02:26:06,210 --> 02:26:10,810
I don't even know what that means. I like
which one is that? That's that. Oh look,

2480
02:26:10,811 --> 02:26:14,230
this one coaster few coaster furniture.

2481
02:26:14,231 --> 02:26:18,850
Try Tom Burgundy top grain leather
recliner. That, that right there man. Oh,

2482
02:26:18,851 --> 02:26:20,020
it's only got three stars though.

2483
02:26:20,770 --> 02:26:25,450
This recliner comes with
the aids climate in China.

2484
02:26:26,630 --> 02:26:30,160
Um, if you, if you had
lazy boy recliners though,

2485
02:26:30,161 --> 02:26:34,600
do you think that it would change the
overall tone of a podcast and make people

2486
02:26:34,601 --> 02:26:38,770
like to like comfortable mythology
chick, man, we keep the receipt.

2487
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:43,930
Joey Diaz a fall asleep man. Well,
let Joey Diaz put his feet up. Dog.

2488
02:26:44,530 --> 02:26:48,460
You blame on one fucking Penn and
teller thing it. Fuck Penn and teller.

2489
02:26:49,810 --> 02:26:52,150
Remember how angry he got when
we played Penn Jillette's ramp?

2490
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:55,030
What are you wasting my time
man for like he was angry.

2491
02:26:55,140 --> 02:26:59,620
Why are you letting somebody talk
besides me? I'm the fat guy around here.

2492
02:27:01,990 --> 02:27:06,310
Um, I can't find a, there's
some pretty good ones.

2493
02:27:06,460 --> 02:27:08,860
It seems like that might be an option,

2494
02:27:08,861 --> 02:27:11,950
but we have to find a place where
we can sit in one of these things.

2495
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:15,760
That's funny. It was one place
that that chair I looked at,

2496
02:27:15,761 --> 02:27:20,170
it was 900 bucks and this place, the
same chair, lazy boy, Presidential Chair,

2497
02:27:20,590 --> 02:27:25,140
1500 bucks, bedding,
pillows, bed and Belgians.

2498
02:27:25,150 --> 02:27:27,460
That's got a huge fucking
bad wall-to-wall wall.

2499
02:27:27,461 --> 02:27:30,940
We all laid down like hippies and we all
have our own little beanbag pillows and

2500
02:27:30,941 --> 02:27:35,500
stuff and we act can bring blankets.
I think that's the move like rave style.

2501
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:36,940
I think this is the move.

2502
02:27:36,941 --> 02:27:41,941
I think there's a high back presidential
office chair is the move that looks so

2503
02:27:42,971 --> 02:27:46,630
suck. 12 person hot tub.
But this looks so sick.

2504
02:27:46,660 --> 02:27:49,390
This presidential chair looks
so dope that would like,

2505
02:27:49,670 --> 02:27:53,770
and it looks comfortable and a
whole like studio filled with them.

2506
02:27:53,771 --> 02:27:55,420
I think that's the perfect compromise.

2507
02:27:55,421 --> 02:27:58,630
Like that doesn't look comfortable with
it. I'm just kidding. Super uncomfortable.

2508
02:27:58,990 --> 02:28:02,860
It was like one of those
stiff chairs where you have
to climb back. Yeah. You can.

2509
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:06,430
Yeah. It reclines it's leans
back. No, that just rocks back.

2510
02:28:06,431 --> 02:28:10,460
That whole thing is connected or,
yeah. Yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. Oh,

2511
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:14,620
I see what you're saying. Yeah. It doesn't
fold at the, uh, at the joint. Yeah. Yeah.

2512
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:19,400
You lean back. Lean back.
I don't know, Dude. I'm,

2513
02:28:19,450 --> 02:28:22,010
I'm partial to this. I need to
try this out somewhere. I think

2514
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:22,880
we just need a silver,

2515
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:27,940
one of the silver bullet trailers and
we pimp that motherfucker fucking studio

2516
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:31,670
anywhere the fuck we want. Well,
we could have a mobile studio.

2517
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:35,750
It's not a bad idea to also have, but
I want to just have one of that. Well,

2518
02:28:35,751 --> 02:28:38,930
because it's not enough space. No. Have
you seen the big ones? They're huge.

2519
02:28:39,020 --> 02:28:41,990
The silver. What are they just
one that the airstream trailer.

2520
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:47,620
look@itasgoodanairstream.com this shit
could completely give up the idea of a

2521
02:28:48,771 --> 02:28:51,590
studio and just get a trailer.
Look at these fucking trailers.

2522
02:28:51,591 --> 02:28:56,591
These things are fucking amazing and you
can have this anywhere you want to go.

2523
02:28:57,260 --> 02:29:01,010
Like if you want to go to fucking
San Diego, if you want to fucking,

2524
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:05,180
I do like the idea of having
something you could bring with you,

2525
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:09,500
like something that you could tow with
you, but really if we're going to do that,

2526
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:11,300
why would we get a studio?

2527
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:16,160
We could get a studio bus if the right
way to do it is to have like one of those

2528
02:29:16,880 --> 02:29:18,950
mobile home things,
not a mobile home.

2529
02:29:18,951 --> 02:29:23,630
One of those calls RVs or people travel
across the country and those big trucks

2530
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:26,330
like that motherfucker. That's pretty
dope, but it doesn't have a car park.

2531
02:29:26,530 --> 02:29:29,960
You know what I'm saying? That's why
we get x suite card at add to it. Yeah.

2532
02:29:29,961 --> 02:29:34,790
I guess we get a fucking, how big is
inside of that dude? It's humongous.

2533
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:38,670
They have all different sizes. They have
sizes that you could people, I mean,

2534
02:29:38,770 --> 02:29:42,860
people live in these things, right? But
how much does one of those costs look,

2535
02:29:42,861 --> 02:29:46,430
they look at these floor plans.
Well these are pretty fucking huge dude.

2536
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:48,800
The dope move would be dude,

2537
02:29:48,860 --> 02:29:52,250
to get one of these as a travel
thing and then we go on a tour.

2538
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:57,320
We go like we start in Seattle
and we'd go down Seattle,

2539
02:29:57,321 --> 02:30:02,180
San Francisco or Seattle, Portland Klein.
You could fucking pimp this bitch out.

2540
02:30:02,181 --> 02:30:05,180
Like look at this shit. You can
pimp this to be our podcast studio.

2541
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:08,940
The whole student. If we gutted this whole
thing out, we've got it all soundproof.

2542
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:11,930
Got It. High Tech. I know. I know
companies that actually do that.

2543
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,600
You imagine though, if you've got a
car accident while you're podcasting,

2544
02:30:14,601 --> 02:30:17,780
how bad that would suck and who's going
to drive? All our friends are assholes,

2545
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:22,490
dude. We get your fucking driver dude.
And then music guided by it. All the CDS.

2546
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:27,360
You get that guy. That guy might
not be a bad idea. I mean, and I,

2547
02:30:27,560 --> 02:30:29,680
and we can just go anywhere.
So fuck like,

2548
02:30:29,690 --> 02:30:32,780
oh well you have a show
at the Hollywood Improv,

2549
02:30:32,781 --> 02:30:36,530
you fucking park this thing right in
front. That would be pretty dope. Yeah.

2550
02:30:36,531 --> 02:30:39,650
You grab people. I mean that's like
having a studio anywhere you go,

2551
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:41,270
but these things that they're towed,

2552
02:30:41,271 --> 02:30:44,150
what you really want is one with a
steering wheel. It drives, right?

2553
02:30:44,151 --> 02:30:47,540
You just got torn coach. The thing
about this though is when your tea,

2554
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:50,180
if you get towed,
if you have one of those that gets towed,

2555
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:54,320
then you don't even talk to the guy that
was driving. He's just taking you there.

2556
02:30:54,321 --> 02:30:56,810
You're completely closed
off in a whole nother area,

2557
02:30:57,170 --> 02:31:00,800
so you don't have to hear him on the
phone and have to hear him yelling in

2558
02:31:00,801 --> 02:31:04,480
Russian. The ads, what I'm
talking about, big ass one,

2559
02:31:05,810 --> 02:31:09,740
we're looking at one that
says the Mercedes Benz one.
Which one was that called?

2560
02:31:09,770 --> 02:31:14,120
That's called a avenue or interstate
touring coach. Buy airstream.

2561
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:16,340
And they also have one
called the interstate,

2562
02:31:16,370 --> 02:31:21,210
which looks like air streams on
the same server. Your here. Huge.

2563
02:31:21,960 --> 02:31:26,640
Yeah, and I mean, this shit's
like a fucking house. I need it.

2564
02:31:27,030 --> 02:31:30,660
Maybe I should just buy
one or one of these things.

2565
02:31:31,170 --> 02:31:35,550
There's a smaller one you could live in.
Dude. Leave that. That's a van. Basically.

2566
02:31:35,551 --> 02:31:39,180
You'd be like, you'd be
the creepy van guy. Yeah.

2567
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:41,250
That's not bad day
because I'm only at home.

2568
02:31:41,580 --> 02:31:45,030
I just need to put my animals somewhere.
Maybe get one of this. You know what?

2569
02:31:45,031 --> 02:31:49,740
I live in a van. Why not give up on life?

2570
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:54,030
I'm never home just to sleep.
Well,

2571
02:31:54,031 --> 02:31:56,970
you should get a secure
department somewhere. Yeah,

2572
02:31:56,971 --> 02:32:00,660
I'm safe place where I just have too
many animals for that shit. Oh yeah.

2573
02:32:00,661 --> 02:32:04,860
You can't get apartments beyond hog.
If anyone in la once a fucking cat.

2574
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:06,290
I got one free give away.

2575
02:32:06,300 --> 02:32:09,710
Your Dad was one cat that I need to
get away with the old one, right? Yeah.

2576
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:13,440
The old ones. That's rude. It's just, it
just doesn't want to be around anybody.

2577
02:32:13,490 --> 02:32:17,820
We bought a dog and another cat involved.
It hates those mixed up the the cat.

2578
02:32:17,850 --> 02:32:18,700
The cat's life.

2579
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:22,770
What did the other two are fucking like
buddy cop movie and they're cool. Yeah,

2580
02:32:22,771 --> 02:32:24,900
they're cooled again. They love
each other and this one's just like,

2581
02:32:24,901 --> 02:32:28,530
I hate you guys. Get those
old cats. They don't like new.

2582
02:32:28,531 --> 02:32:33,380
Just want to make it a helicopter
and be done with it. Why One cat?

2583
02:32:33,880 --> 02:32:38,520
I have one cat that's 15 and one cat.
That's too, I love both of them though.

2584
02:32:38,550 --> 02:32:41,310
You have good cats?
Yeah. Nice capitol. Cool.

2585
02:32:41,370 --> 02:32:45,450
But the the two year old's Fox with a
15 year old relentlessly. She's always,

2586
02:32:46,100 --> 02:32:49,620
you need to out for that cat.
The small dog.

2587
02:32:49,621 --> 02:32:54,550
We'll take care of buddy buddy
when he can. His cat. By the way,

2588
02:32:54,551 --> 02:32:57,510
I don't ever bring your fucking dog over
here because my whole family would go

2589
02:32:57,511 --> 02:33:02,130
crazy for it. All the girls, oh my God,
I'm going to bring it over next time.

2590
02:33:02,131 --> 02:33:05,310
I'm going to get a nice haircut. Get
some Bose, bring it over. He did.

2591
02:33:05,311 --> 02:33:09,150
It would be gone if you want to get
rid of it. Oh sure. There we go.

2592
02:33:09,690 --> 02:33:11,340
I could probably take
it if you really want.

2593
02:33:11,700 --> 02:33:15,480
The girls would go nuts cause your
dog is so friendly and she's so small.

2594
02:33:16,290 --> 02:33:19,080
My daughters will go crazy. How
old is your dog? A year and a half.

2595
02:33:19,350 --> 02:33:21,860
But it's got herpes from the
ex girlfriend, right? No, no.

2596
02:33:21,870 --> 02:33:24,060
I sucked all the herpes
or right out on that dog

2597
02:33:26,150 --> 02:33:27,080
fucking shows.

2598
02:33:27,450 --> 02:33:32,210
Cleaned the bullet out of
that deteriorated drastically
since we came back.

2599
02:33:32,220 --> 02:33:35,790
Cubic Karen, I'm sorry about
the, the shit going down earlier.

2600
02:33:35,791 --> 02:33:40,110
Ladies and gentlemen, we're really going
to have to fix our issues here. But um,

2601
02:33:40,650 --> 02:33:43,650
death squad west should
be up and cracking.

2602
02:33:44,700 --> 02:33:48,450
I'm trying to get it
done. Um, we're in June.

2603
02:33:48,480 --> 02:33:51,740
I want to get it done before July.
Uh,

2604
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:54,750
we're trying to figure out whether or
not we're going to do a big Vegas show at

2605
02:33:54,751 --> 02:33:58,890
the Mandalay Bay in July. If we do
do it, it will be full desk squad,

2606
02:33:58,950 --> 02:34:03,360
Ari and Joe, we hopefully, um,
and Brian will come down to,

2607
02:34:03,361 --> 02:34:07,680
and maybe even Doug Benson because a. Dot.
I think Doug's playing poker down Dan.

2608
02:34:07,681 --> 02:34:07,891
So he,

2609
02:34:07,891 --> 02:34:12,840
cause he just asked for tickets the
other day and I'm supposed to come down.

2610
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:18,100
I'm doing Doug's a podcast in Vegas. I
think that's the weekend. Yeah. Yeah,

2611
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:20,560
he did that. And let's stay for an
extra day to do Doug's all right.

2612
02:34:20,561 --> 02:34:25,350
We might do that. I can't stay an extra
day, but uh, we'll get things cracking.

2613
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:26,680
All right,
let's get the fuck out of here.

2614
02:34:26,681 --> 02:34:30,940
Let's wrap this bitch up tomorrow
night. Uh, the Ice House comedy club,

2615
02:34:30,941 --> 02:34:33,970
the second stage and
which is only 85 seats,

2616
02:34:34,300 --> 02:34:37,780
if you never been there for those
shows, it's the most intimate. And uh,

2617
02:34:37,810 --> 02:34:41,020
I got some new shit I'm trying to work
out on and I'm going to do some question

2618
02:34:41,021 --> 02:34:45,280
and answer to it just in a, in an effort
to try to come up with some new shit.

2619
02:34:45,790 --> 02:34:49,760
It's a, this is the period of time
for me where it's the most, uh,

2620
02:34:49,810 --> 02:34:54,670
nerve wracking and chaotic cause I'm just
fucking around and writing a lot. But,

2621
02:34:54,671 --> 02:34:57,610
uh, but it's really fun and one of
the funnest things about it is, uh,

2622
02:34:57,640 --> 02:35:00,820
doing these ice house shows
because the crowds are so cool.

2623
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:05,020
It's like it's the perfect environment
to fuck around and practice and try to

2624
02:35:05,021 --> 02:35:09,520
stretch out and come up with new stuff
and everybody's really enjoying them.

2625
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:11,290
We're going to do them on a regular basis,
folks,

2626
02:35:11,291 --> 02:35:15,600
most likely Wednesday of every week
and a lot of them are Friday. Um,

2627
02:35:15,670 --> 02:35:17,230
I'm not going to be at
all the Friday ones,

2628
02:35:17,231 --> 02:35:21,490
but I'm going to be at most of the
Wednesday ones and uh, that's all right.

2629
02:35:21,491 --> 02:35:24,280
We're rolling bitches.
We got more common. Uh,

2630
02:35:25,090 --> 02:35:29,050
tomorrow we are, we're off cause
you got something going on.

2631
02:35:29,051 --> 02:35:29,920
I'm going to eat three,

2632
02:35:29,921 --> 02:35:33,850
but then we have the icehouse chronicles
that tomorrow it starts at the podcast

2633
02:35:33,851 --> 02:35:38,160
was starting at eight. The show's at eight
30 ice house comedy.com. Thursday, um,

2634
02:35:39,250 --> 02:35:43,390
is not John Anthony West. John
Anthony West has been moved to Friday.

2635
02:35:43,410 --> 02:35:46,780
Thursday is now your Riaa Faber.
So Thursday you're,

2636
02:35:46,781 --> 02:35:50,580
Ryan has a really short schedule and he's
in town and he's going to do it live.

2637
02:35:50,590 --> 02:35:52,450
John Anthony West is going
to do it through Skype.

2638
02:35:52,451 --> 02:35:56,500
It's going to be our first Skype podcast.
So video, just audio, video and audio.

2639
02:35:56,501 --> 02:35:58,830
So he's going to show us
pictures and tell us things.

2640
02:35:58,831 --> 02:36:01,420
So it'll be a little weird for
the folks that are just listening,

2641
02:36:01,421 --> 02:36:04,810
but we'll explain it as best we can. And
if you don't know John Anthony West is,

2642
02:36:04,811 --> 02:36:08,020
he's one of my personal heroes.
He's an egyptologist, a fascinating,

2643
02:36:08,021 --> 02:36:13,021
brilliant guy who is the producer of
a video series called magical Egypt,

2644
02:36:13,331 --> 02:36:18,331
which is one of the most comprehensive
video series on ancient Egypt.

2645
02:36:18,701 --> 02:36:23,701
And especially like the hidden
symbolism involved in hieroglyphs and,

2646
02:36:24,181 --> 02:36:28,600
and the, the, the construction
of their, their, uh, their,
their pyramids and their,

2647
02:36:28,601 --> 02:36:32,080
their temples and all their different
thing. I mean, really amazing, amazing.

2648
02:36:32,081 --> 02:36:32,760
Stopped.
I,

2649
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:37,690
I can't stress enough how pumped I
am to talk to this guy cause he's,

2650
02:36:37,691 --> 02:36:41,590
uh, just, uh, an incredible source of
information when it comes to Egypt.

2651
02:36:41,590 --> 02:36:45,490
The guy's been involved in studying it
his entire life and he's got just some

2652
02:36:45,491 --> 02:36:48,020
brilliant work out there. I can't
wait to talk to that dude. Uh,

2653
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:50,980
so that's Uriah Faber on Thursday.

2654
02:36:51,100 --> 02:36:56,100
John Anthony West is going to be on
Friday and I think we got someone on

2655
02:36:56,771 --> 02:37:01,120
Saturday, dude. Saturday. Yeah. I think
some something's going on at Saturday.

2656
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:03,130
May or may not be happening on Saturday.

2657
02:37:03,131 --> 02:37:04,660
Like someone who couldn't
do it any other day.

2658
02:37:05,140 --> 02:37:06,500
I'll let you know soon as
we'd get out of his pocket.

2659
02:37:06,501 --> 02:37:08,800
So I'm not sure what the
fuck I'm talking about here.

2660
02:37:08,801 --> 02:37:12,550
I don't even know what I'm saying. That's
scheduling stuff. I'm not sure about.

2661
02:37:12,551 --> 02:37:14,620
This might be ruined in me.

2662
02:37:15,170 --> 02:37:18,920
Selegiline and Alpha brain together
are battling for dominance. Right. Um,

time. Uh, like I said before,

2666
02:37:28,071 --> 02:37:31,790
I appreciate the fuck out of
it and there's not a moment
where I'm taking any of

2667
02:37:31,791 --> 02:37:35,600
this for granted and, uh, uh, we're
gonna keep this pitch rolling.

2678
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:17,210
If you're wondering if you're somewhere
in the future and you have just stumbled

2679
02:38:17,211 --> 02:38:20,690
upon this podcast,
it is June 5th,

2680
02:38:20,690 --> 02:38:23,390
2012 would have been better if
I said 2000 without slurring.

2681
02:38:24,150 --> 02:38:28,700
2012 all right, that's it,
right? Death Squad shirt.

2682
02:38:28,790 --> 02:38:29,960
Go buy a death squad shirt.

2683
02:38:29,990 --> 02:38:33,560
Go to desk squad.tv and we've got
a Mike Maxwell desk squad shirt,

2684
02:38:33,561 --> 02:38:35,600
a new one that's coming out.
It's fucking dope.

2685
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:39,590
It's a chimp with a gas mask on
it. It says death, Death Squad,

2686
02:38:39,591 --> 02:38:43,940
department of Health and
welfare. Love it. Excellent.

2687
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:47,450
We're also going to have those t
shirts that Maxwell made, or excuse me,

2688
02:38:47,451 --> 02:38:50,300
those posters at Maxwell
made for Chicago and Atlanta.

2689
02:38:50,540 --> 02:38:52,640
We're going to turn those into tee
shirts because so many people have been

2690
02:38:52,641 --> 02:38:54,020
requesting them and the,

2691
02:38:54,030 --> 02:38:56,810
they're really cool posters and
it's available on Mike Maxwell,

2692
02:38:56,811 --> 02:39:01,520
art.com Mike will also be there
tomorrow night. He's coming down to a,

2693
02:39:01,530 --> 02:39:04,610
to the ice house. So that's
it. You've freaks. We love you.

2694
02:39:05,420 --> 02:39:09,860
We're all in this together. All
of us. As unlikely as it seems,

2695
02:39:09,890 --> 02:39:10,970
although it makes no sense,

2696
02:39:11,210 --> 02:39:13,940
we are all part of something
much greater than ourselves.

2697
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:19,010
One big giant fucking soup
of things spinning around.

2698
02:39:22,900 --> 02:39:22,950
Okay.
