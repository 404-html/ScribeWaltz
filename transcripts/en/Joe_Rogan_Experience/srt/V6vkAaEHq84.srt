1
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,691
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:09,210
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the flashlight.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,860
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link that says fleshlight and during

4
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:18,390
the code name Brogan, you get 15%
off. All right, and would that said,

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,800
toggle up bitches,

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,480
the Joe Rogan experience.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,410
[inaudible]

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,060
Brian thinks it's funny to keep
playing that black guy's voice.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,670
They totally forgot it. Fake
Black Guy's voice. It's much more,

10
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:47,760
much more offensive. Um,
before we get started,

11
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,380
I think I have to say
more about the flashlight.

12
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,000
Don't think that's a 15 second ad.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,340
Awesome. I shoot loads into
it. I recommend you do the
same. Can I help in on this?

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,910
Yes. Kevin Pereira wants to shoot loads
into a flashlight. We're going to,

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,210
I want to believe in a world
where I can, but as I said, I,

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,900
I get a wave of guilt and sin and filth
that washes over me every time I climax.

17
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,490
And I can't imagine saving that into a,

18
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,490
a fleshy device that it didn't have
to dishwasher. It feels better,

19
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,830
but it's more embarrassing. Yeah. And
Kevin's brought wine, but I'll do it.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,590
Gentleman were sophisticates here.
Here's me mate. Cheers. This is,

21
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:23,480
I mean we have wine. Coconut water. Yeah,

22
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:27,830
we got coffee and were stoned and
you know, I don't, um, there's a,

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,530
there's a thing I have, I don't have
a lot of obsessive compulsive shit,

24
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,830
but one thing I have is if you make
an a toast, you got to click glasses.

25
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,080
Whatever buddy. Yes. Yeah. What is this
like sort of half ass gesture. It's,

26
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:41,930
some people don't want to lean across
the table. Listen, you lazy bitch. Okay.

27
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,400
Are we all in this together?
What?

28
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:46,140
We've got clink glasses and you
have to tap it on the ground on,

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,040
on the table first before you drink it. Oh
really? Yeah. You do. What's that about?

30
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,120
I, I know tag back thing. You just
have to do it. I've never done that.

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,780
Does that signify I'm done my glasses
in my whole life. I've done them wrong.

32
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,760
You've been sending
mixed messages to people.

33
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,170
You could be getting in
fights and not know it.

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,810
This is like a Jujitsu technique where
you realize you couldn't finish it.

35
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:05,270
What all you had to do was just one
little thing. One little thing different.

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,990
I didn't click like, goddammit
gentleman, here's the mulligans chairs.

37
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,680
Mulligans I don't even know what that
means. What does a gap is a do over, over.

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,260
I never played golf. Got Tap Joe.
You've just didn't tap. Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,850
I never, I never, he
tap, tap and pitch it.

40
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,100
Shut myself.

41
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,380
Out of all the Douchey tee shirts I've
ever seen related to mixed martial arts,

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
one of them was tap or
snap. Oh, so up to you.

43
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,760
And then may fashion has got to evolve,
man.

44
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:38,150
How many wolves and skeletons and
chains can you wear around your neck?

45
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,330
Ag Your Four. You're asking to get
in a fight. I got this new company.

46
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:45,290
It's about the brick off called break
my dick off and your ass fight gear.

47
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,820
This is, this is the
Vulcan. The logo's a dragon.

48
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:54,200
Fucking a pit bull in the
ass. Covered in glitter, bro.

49
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,630
I need to get you and Dana
white in on this. You know,

50
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,890
you got to do it then new tank top I
two knuckles deep. Oh, it's so cool.

51
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,050
The moment you go two knuckles
deep, man, you're going to tap.

52
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,210
It's a new technique or the guys have to,
yeah,

53
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,640
CPR has been training really mad. I did
not know that he can get three knuckles.

54
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,790
Wow, that's incredible. But then again,
belladonnas only a hundred pounds.

55
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,050
She can get a baseball bat.
That is true. God bless her.

56
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,870
What the fuck is that all about?
That should be an Olympic sport gaping.

57
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,110
It should absolutely be a sport
spitting in the gaping hole,

58
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,460
like a basketball type thing for
accuracy. Right. It's hard to do,

59
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:29,170
especially when you have a chest
cold cause it sticks to everything.

60
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,470
None of this existed when I was a child.
Now it did just,

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,320
I don't think people knew about it.
Do you think you did,

62
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,660
do you think there's a lot of assholes
judging, spitting and assholes?

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,620
If we had flip cams back in the 18
hundreds you'd see Victoria and gaping

64
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,450
Victorian era. Some of it,
it's so bad like that, that
God, that Max Hardcore Guy,

65
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,140
that guts,
he went to jail for it.

66
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,480
I mean you got to do something really
fucking creepy for them to be wanting to

67
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:57,100
lock you up in jail in 2011 or 10 weather.
Well maybe it was even nine for porn.

68
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,630
Yeah, but this fucking guy, man,

69
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:02,410
he was opening girl's ass holes
up and in the like with like,

70
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,100
like speculums is that what it's called?
Whatever it medical instrument,

71
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,180
a little thing that you stretch it,

72
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:11,650
a vice grip then peeing in there and then
making girls drinking out with a straw

73
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,050
alleged the leaky basement.
They were talking about this.

74
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:17,320
A sal was talking about this on the stern
show. Um, I don't know if it's true,

75
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:20,980
but if it is true, I don't doubt it.
I've seen a lot of shit. Let's see.

76
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:24,220
I was seeing shit back in the bulletin
board dial up days when I was like nine,

77
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:28,480
10 years old, which explains a lot. I've
been to sensitize the Russian soldier,

78
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,090
putting his foot on a head and
cutting a neck open and going, oh,

79
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,100
it would be steamy because
it was cold outside.

80
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,360
Like that analysis of fucked up shit at
the age of nine or 10 so I believe it

81
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:37,931
was all out there.

82
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:42,370
But what I don't get are how girls are
making money off of non porn because guys

83
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:44,080
are sexually objectified by it.

84
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:47,980
Like the the crushers that will crush a
cell phone with a, with a heel or a pump,

85
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:51,370
a gas pedal on a car. There's a lot of
fucked up. There's don't they can get,

86
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,310
I mean we've,
we do it,

87
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,660
what the fuck segment on our
show where it's like girls that,

88
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,510
that that getting pools wearing Jean
jackets and they make like $30 a month off

89
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,080
subscriptions subscriptions. Cause
some dude's like, oh look at that.

90
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:05,680
Then I'm getting wet. Oh Mommy spanked
me. Whoa. Now I gotta clean my flashlight.

91
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,050
I lived the minion. Have you ever
seen the menu and it's like a website,

92
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,030
we've talked about this
before where this crazy ugly,

93
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:13,470
nasty fat guy just fucks these
hot porn stars. But no once,

94
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,770
I mean I could see where it's
like kind of cool that of others.

95
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,610
One Who wants to subscribe to that guy.
That was always the charm of Ron, Jeremy.

96
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:25,330
Right, right. I kind of beginning
it was a girl beginning.

97
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:29,770
It was sort of a normal looking guy
but then it became hideous. Took time.

98
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:33,970
But clearly he's in the hideous realm.
I mean everyone goes bad eventually.

99
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,210
He's fucking hideous and, and
that's, that's part of the charm.

100
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,780
There's something about the Internet
man and technology in general though his

101
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:45,781
accelerated porn to just an accelerated
depravity and and and just decadence and

102
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:50,560
to just like really fucking intense
levels that have never existed before.

103
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:53,380
I mean at first it was seen as this
bastion of hope that was going to elevate

104
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:56,830
discussion and bring intellectuals
together and further everything. And it,

105
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,280
it has done that to an extent,

106
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,820
but it's really just created
hardcore porn like really hard.

107
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,650
I think the thing is I think it's going
to change young people for good or bad

108
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:07,640
and probably both.

109
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,510
But I think once you're old
and you already have like
a pattern set in your head,

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,950
it's way easier to just jerk off to have
more and more fucked up shit than it is

111
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,370
to like look at the latest findings
on, you know, hyper Novas or you know,

112
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,220
look deep into the, the real possibilities
created by the large Hadron collider.

113
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:28,460
Like that's too much, man. Fuck that
pink cloud. That's where I'm going.

114
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,640
Exactly what I want to watch some guys
shit and some chick's mouth because I

115
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,510
can't, you know, I mean there's guys
that like, they're so angry at women,

116
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:39,850
they want to shit in their mouth
like a good, she fucking like,

117
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,450
could she have done just like
just exist and be unattainable.

118
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,510
That's what it is, mom.
And she's right to dude.

119
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,760
So there's a lot of weak bitches
out there. That's what it is.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,950
There's a lot of dudes,
mom issues or not.

121
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:55,700
You've got to fucking look at the whole
world around you make an assessment,

122
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,730
look what goes on your instincts,
what is positive, what is negative,

123
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,960
what does admirable, what
makes you jealous? Go towards
that. And I always say,

124
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,350
I aspire to be the man that you pretend
to be when you're trying to get laid.

125
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,290
Okay. Aspire to be that guy for real.
Actually become that guy. You know,

126
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,770
just you don't have to use your
mom issues and all that stuff.

127
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,420
Get your shit together bitch.

128
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,730
So that's why I got an m three cause I
want to be the guy that doesn't need a

129
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,770
personality is what I'm talking about.
I want to be the guy or you moist yet.

130
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,420
Plus they're the shit and they're,
they handle awesome. Such good cars.

131
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,330
I love cars, man. I'm a, I'm a,

132
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,890
I'm so fascinated by the engineering that
I couldn't possibly be responsible for

133
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:33,590
myself. I look at something like a
co m three or something like that.

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,310
I think about all the fucking shit that's
involved, all the different settings,

135
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:40,160
the m setting and all a sudden that
suspension changes. You feel it,

136
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:42,770
the macro for your car and all of a
sudden it's like the car is, it's sucking.

137
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:47,270
You buy the asshole and just holding
you back. Just to the engineering.

138
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,420
I believe that there's 30 German
engineers that shed a single tear.

139
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,440
Whenever I put the top down,

140
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,590
like I believe they're so proud of their
work and the time and all the effort

141
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:56,540
that went into making a
piece of plastic fold.

142
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,230
I believe that they're crying about
us. That's not plastic. The Tufts,

143
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:03,770
one of the coolest things about the top
of the empty and three convertible m

144
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:06,390
three converted. We're on it
because it's all one piece. And Mel,

145
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:07,280
that's like the coolest thing.

146
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,200
And they figured out how to
do recently I could transform.

147
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,420
It goes into like three little sections.
You have two sections in the window.

148
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,840
It's dope. Watch. When he does
it, it's, it's amazing. Like,

149
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,680
it's like an orchestration
of, of, you know,

150
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,840
mechanical engineering break easily isn't
there? Like, you know, like, oh you,

151
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:25,730
you know, no more shit. You know, the more
moving parts. Yeah. But that's, that's,

152
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:27,670
that's my life. That's
everybody's life now, right?

153
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,230
We get more shit so that it can break so
that we can get pissed that it's shit.

154
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:33,440
And it's amazing how reliable
those things are. You know,

155
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:37,040
they're the most unreliable car ever had
was a Porsche. I had a nine 11 turbo.

156
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,280
They're broke down five times.
It was ridiculous. But BMWs,

157
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:43,010
I've never had a problem. Japanese
cars, I've never had a problem.

158
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:46,700
It's amazing how many miles you
can put on a car these days.

159
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,713
And there's no problem.

160
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,260
Like back when you had like a 1970
barracuda or something like that, Yo,

161
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,900
hundred thousand miles,
the things done. All right,

162
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,670
you get your bearings blown and
fucking transmission's gone.

163
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,900
Missing gears and the engine
smells like shit. I mean,

164
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:03,570
you have to rebuild everything.
Those things just didn't last.

165
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,890
Remember the super as we had with the legs
that popped up, one of years break? No,

166
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,770
I didn't have to always be there.
I had the one with the fixed,

167
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,530
I had a 92 or 93 Toyota supra.
Oh,

168
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,020
when they went to that space shape,

169
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:19,950
that was the first really cool car that
I got. That was my news radio money.

170
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,203
But uh,

171
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,340
it's just something about just the
engineering of these fucking cars that's

172
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:29,250
accelerated as well. Like
the empathy, like the m,

173
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,740
this m three that I
have is 420 horsepower.

174
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,940
Well the nine 11 terrible that I had was
like somewhere around the same like 420

175
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:39,510
horsepower, but it was all turbo charged
and it was like Algebra down. Yeah.

176
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,280
And it's a different sort of a feeling.

177
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,220
Well this car is that with a full v
eight with an 84,000 Rpm, you know,

178
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,300
rev limit.
I mean it's fucking incredible.

179
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:53,130
Is it 84,000 or 84008000400
but when it hits 8,400 men,

180
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:55,440
that whale,
it's like a formula one race car.

181
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,870
It sounds obvious in launch control yet.
No,

182
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,160
that sounds like it's going
to kill the transmission. Nah.

183
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,560
Well if you warm your engine up,

184
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,800
you have to drive for x amount of
miles at certain speeds and whatnot.

185
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,420
You can drop it into first
shut off traction control. Uh,

186
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:10,500
and if you hold the one of the shifter
paddles in or you put it in neutral slam

187
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,900
on the gas while holding
a shifter paddles,

188
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,470
like the checkered flag will
appear on the dash and controls.

189
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,610
There's total Easter eggs in the software.

190
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,040
And then you can use
like your cruise control,

191
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,860
actual controls to boost up the RPM.
So when you let go,

192
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,210
it engages that clutch when you're already
at seven thousand eight thousand rpm

193
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,190
screams and you'll break your neck.
That's bad ass.

194
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,870
What you find out about that Internet.
So it's pretty, it's pretty common. It's,

195
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,743
it's,
it's coming back.

196
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,890
The Nissan's actually did it for
their GTR and when people used it,

197
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,750
it violated the warranty. They say
they say BMW, if you do it over twice,

198
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:45,650
apparently accounts, how many times you
do it, it violates your warranty too. Wow,

199
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,930
that's funny. That's
ridiculous. Make a better thing.

200
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,290
Don't give me something that breaks
stupid. But the uh, let me, someone was,

201
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,760
could particularly ridiculous
cause it's a God damn race car.

202
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,160
I mean what Nissan was bragging
about what they're Zeros,

203
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,050
the zero to 60 time was ridiculously
low. And the handling. The car's insane.

204
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,910
It's a fucking amazing car. I drove it,
but there's something about it. It's like,

205
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:09,060
yeah, it's really fast
and yeah, but it's ugly.

206
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,980
It's like it's goofy
looking and it's like,

207
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,240
it's got some sort of a techno Godzilla
thing going on that I'm not really into

208
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,980
it. So like it stands out too much. But
for all the, like if a Ferrari stands out,

209
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,860
you know it stands out but it stands out.
It's like it's beautiful.

210
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,620
That car stands out like what's going on?
Car stand out.

211
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:28,840
Cause he looked like babies, sneakers on
wheels. It's not a good standard. Yeah,

212
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,760
it's an odd stand out. Like I don't
particularly, I tried to like it.

213
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:36,010
I like looked around it and stare at it.
I tried to like it but it's,

214
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,110
the engineering though is stunning.
What about electric cars?

215
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:42,540
Like the Tesla and all that?
They're not ready. You know,

216
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,950
I'm interested in them eventually,

217
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:46,650
but I'm not interested in something that
you have to charge for 18 hours after

218
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:50,880
you drive 250 that's, that's stupid.
The Mississippi in the gallons though.

219
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:53,920
I get 15 gallons of gas
it per the big truck.

220
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,620
I know that shit. Aye. Aye.
Aye. Yeah, it's disgusting.

221
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,890
Well it makes you mad when it starts
hitting four 30 and four I mean what does

222
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:04,240
it now for 20 for regular in the premiums,
like five thing for 50 at Chevron.

223
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,190
But my point was about the BMW is that
what's really shocking is how much better

224
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:12,760
engineered they are just over a few
years ago. Like compared to my supra,

225
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,070
like the super was a
really good handling car.

226
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:19,070
It was like it was but this m it's like
glued to the fucking ground. I love it.

227
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,700
It's just like it's on track first
nice car that I've ever had in my life.

228
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:24,440
Then it's like you turn the wheel
and the car just goes. Yeah,

229
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,900
it doesn't ask questions.

230
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:30,670
It's so connected to the road like it's
so it's so like, um, what's the word?

231
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:33,790
I mean precise, you know like
the way it handles and moves.

232
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,840
The Germans are known for their
precision and shit in the mouth videos.

233
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,090
Then I'll fill out of that too.
What's up with that?

234
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:43,420
Why are the Germans into those a
scat videos, Germans and Japanese,

235
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,090
you can't point fingers now with the
Internet. Everybody's into everything.

236
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,590
They're just willing to go. It wasn't at
the root. I mean behind every stereotype.

237
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,210
They just had an awesome word for
it. Is that what it shy? Shy Porn.

238
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,510
Wow. I'd like to yell that I sure as
Shit. That's what it is. Shidler his shit.

239
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,160
I had a good word.

240
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,280
I don't know if schizoid itself is or if
that's just an exclamation of make when

241
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:07,020
you're actually crapping
on someone, but wow. Yeah.

242
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,360
Enough that they had to
fucking label it so often.

243
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,910
Like there's one porn when it got
shit in his mouth. Oh, no, no, no, no.

244
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,050
We have a whole category of that.

245
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,590
What a guy shits on someone's
mouth and there's a category.

246
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,100
That's why people are in tune.
But where else do you put it on the shelf?

247
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,250
At the adult video store, you know?
Yeah. There is no more of those.

248
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,980
They still exist. Do they
exist? I went to, I went to
a sex shop the other day. Uh,

249
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,910
just the Loobren standard run of the mill,
uh,

250
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,320
and feel like we're going
to be hearing music.

251
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,770
Where's this going to Albertsons
thinking were there special you now?

252
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,150
But this guy comes up to the counter and
he buys a card. He's like, he's like,

253
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:43,800
I'd like a $5 in the booth and,
and like a dude went,

254
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,010
got a plastic card and they had a whole
video adult video arcade back there and

255
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:50,680
I saw at least 10 different people come
in and the short time that I was there

256
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,180
to buy video cards to go in
the back and beat off. Wow.

257
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,390
Maybe there was something way cooler.

258
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,390
Maybe there was the glory hole action
or maybe it was a unicorn ride.

259
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,680
I don't know what was
happening back there.

260
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,040
Like maybe there was some crazy
shit going on. My friend Johnny,

261
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,510
God rest his soul. He used
to go to New York. He was a,

262
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,680
he's an addict and used to smoke
crack and go to those peep shows.

263
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,950
That was his thing.
When he would smoke crack,

264
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,270
you would want to go hide and go to peep
shows. He shows in those places all day.

265
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,910
Just give the girl money. It would
tell me these horror stories of what?

266
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:20,410
What kind of women are on the other side,
like showing you their asshole.

267
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,890
Do you think like girls that are like
in the glass boxes like behind like you

268
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:24,520
know like what's that?

269
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,420
That that that hotel where they have a
girl in the glass box behind the checkout

270
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,770
that's on sunset. Have you ever seen that?
Yes. I know he talking about standard.

271
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,430
Is it the Santander?
Do you think like that?

272
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:37,960
That that's like the upgraded version of
the peep show girl was like, oh my God.

273
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:38,210
They'd like,

274
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,870
like they fight with each other back in
the box of the standard this weekend.

275
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,580
It's no people that don't
know what we're talking about.

276
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,620
When you go to the standard,
as you go into the lobby,

277
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,270
the standard hotel in Hollywood
has the desk where the,

278
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:50,320
they check you in and above the desk.
There's like a fish tank,

279
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,070
like a big fish tank with a woman in it
and she's hot and she's in her underwear

280
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:58,940
and she's reading a book or she's
checking her email. It's weird. Yeah,

281
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,680
and she's not supposed
to interact with you.

282
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:05,720
They don't look at you and smile and wave
cause that would be so anti la in la.

283
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,750
No one pays attention to you.

284
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,770
It's not like she's there to greet you
like in Vegas and they're going to hire a

285
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:12,980
hot chick. They'd hire you. Hello.
Welcome the casino. Nice to meet you.

286
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,630
Do you need help with your bags in la?

287
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:17,390
She's in her underwear reading their
email and you're like looking at her.

288
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,360
I was with Doug Benson in Vegas and
they had one of those same things,

289
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:23,000
but the girls like worlds so
excited to see Doug Benson.

290
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:26,180
They got out of character and got out
of the glass box to take a photo with

291
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,200
awful Doug Benson.
Did that end with Benson in the box,

292
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,830
shaken it for people
who are making out with,

293
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,570
I'd love that.

294
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,720
I'm so jealous and envious of
people that can perform while stone.

295
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,420
Loosen your stone right now. Stop
lying. Allegedly. Stop lying.

296
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,000
Stop lying to America. You know, you said
something in your, in your, your Twitter,

297
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,970
when you were tweeting about coming
here that you were worried about ruining

298
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:52,010
your career. I thought that
was hilarious. Not worried.

299
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:55,580
I was excited by the possibility
ruining not my current,

300
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,970
like I could pretty much caught
doing whatever I need to on g four.

301
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,320
I mean the audience gets it, you
know, they're all young dudes too.

302
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,850
But if I am on the precipice of either
homelessness or potentially legitimizing

303
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:11,180
myself and you know, this is, this
might be a nudge in one direction.

304
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,180
You think so man, I think it's a
nudge towards the right direction.

305
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,670
I have always said that if I can't
say or do something that I want to do,

306
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,070
I'm in the wrong business or I'm
doing the wrong show. Well you can do,

307
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:26,360
you can back yourself into a corner
and not even realize it's happening.

308
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:26,691
You know,

309
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:29,810
you get on a certain show and that
certain show wants a certain standard of

310
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:33,260
behavior. I mean there's a reason why
Charlie Sheen is bouncing back like this.

311
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,210
He's like a girl that's been molested, you
know, girls been molested, they wait. No,

312
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:39,200
it's not that he's a victim.

313
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:42,200
It's like when you do something that
you don't want to do and you have to

314
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,080
pretend to be someone you're not,
there's like,

315
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,470
then when you get pushed in one way
there's inelasticity to life and it makes

316
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,180
you bounce in the other way.
And it's like, you know,

317
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,330
like we were talking to Dana d Armand
and she was talking about our family was

318
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,550
like, you know, hey smoke pot, do
whatever you want but don't drink.

319
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,120
So I fucking drank. You know, there's
a, you push someone in one direction,

320
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,550
you're too controlling and one
direction they rebel, you know,

321
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:06,160
there's not a great, a great and,
and you know, like I said, if, if,

322
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:09,860
if I can't say or do like I'd absolutely
lost and an endorsement deals,

323
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,600
I've lost all sorts of stuff from,

324
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,130
I'm not going to say that
I'm not going to do that.

325
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,710
And while it may have cost me short term,
I think long term it's the way to go.

326
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:20,270
So if we're talking about chais are
porn and BMWs, so be it, cheers,

327
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,320
it just a matter of time before there
is no more sensors and standards and all

328
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,070
that nonsense.

329
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,600
Like the Internet is pretty much kind of
squashed a good huge chunk of that shit.

330
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,390
You know, you agree you can put
your content out fast. Yeah,

331
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:35,850
I worry about that ending at some
point to me to do, especially as this,

332
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,060
the notion of Ip TV, Internet, TV,

333
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:39,720
and we'll get to the Google
thing probably at some point.

334
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,000
But that notion that the distribution
method or the way you're getting the

335
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:45,890
content is going to matter in five years.
It's not.

336
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,440
So when people turn on the TV and
they're watching the internet,

337
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,400
there's to be calls for regulations

338
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,020
and clamp downs just the way there is.

339
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,420
And you'll still be able to self
distribute always that will,

340
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,740
that avenue will be there to an extent.
There's no regulation on cable. Cable is,

341
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,630
it's not regulated by the FCC. Yeah. Yeah.
But then if you don't use advertisers,

342
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:05,850
I mean isn't that what motivates it?
It's very difficult.

343
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,960
It's going to be very difficult
to rationalize, imposing
some sort of standards.

344
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:12,990
What, how something really
fucked up happening and
that's what you really have to

345
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,950
worry about it. And this is fucking
tinfoil hat conspiracy theory 101 okay.

346
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,630
It sounds absolutely ridiculous,

347
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:22,090
but if you were the government and
you realize that, hey look what,

348
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,370
what of all these rebellions all across
the world have in common while they have

349
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:26,761
in common,

350
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:29,640
these people organize on the Internet
in a way that was never possible before.

351
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,280
Hmm, okay. How do we stop
that from happening? Well,

352
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:36,300
we have to figure out a way that the
internet is evil and so then the internet

353
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:39,900
gets used for something or blamed for
something and there's some sort of a

354
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:43,230
terrorist attack that was
coordinated by the Internet. Okay.

355
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:45,720
There is a way around this and
you can still enjoy your internet.

356
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,840
[inaudible] I mean there's,
there's not,

357
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,920
there's been legislation proposed
the Internet kill switch,

358
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,830
which people were talking about like mad
and it was actually right before Egypt

359
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,550
happened. And then it's, they actually
discussed it right as Egypt was happening.

360
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:59,700
Yeah. That main revolt, that notion
that up. It's for your safety, security.

361
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:00,534
There's something going on.

362
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,110
This switches now flipped and there goes
your Internet where we have no idea how

363
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:09,111
much of crises and political
overthrowing of governors,

364
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,153
you know,

365
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,190
fucking warlords and and mayors and we
have no idea how much of this shit is

366
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:19,420
engineered,
how much of foreign dictators they're,

367
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,860
they're getting overthrown is engineered
and engineered by the CIA general.

368
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,910
Wesley Clark was talking about this.
There's a video that I was watching,

369
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:30,840
I put it on my Twitter a couple of days
ago, but he was talking in 2007 okay.

370
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:35,841
In detail about the plans that are
in place to overthrow dictatorships

371
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:39,450
throughout the world, including
Libya. Gaddafi was, yeah,

372
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,990
they were supporting Gadhafi up until
that bitter end and then they said, okay,

373
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:46,200
now we're going to on the rentals so that
they could eventually become al Qaeda

374
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:47,760
and hate us as well.
Once they get into power.

375
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,500
The whole thing is completely ridiculous.

376
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,920
It's our relation to our
reputation squandered. It's God.

377
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:53,754
Wasn't there a point in time?

378
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,600
I remember being younger and being told
USA number one and believing that, okay,

379
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:59,730
that's what the world thought.
They all expired. But now,

380
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,770
now we're a bunch of scared old men,

381
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,590
a bunch of scared old men that want
to keep everybody down. I mean,

382
00:20:04,591 --> 00:20:06,080
that's what it seems like. I mean, this,

383
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,810
this whole country seems like a
bunch of meddling fucks, you know?

384
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:11,820
And when it comes to the rest
of the world, if I didn't know,

385
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,730
if I wasn't American and I
didn't know that, you know,

386
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,520
most of us here are as much victims
as the people around the world.

387
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,590
It's just not happening to us physically.
But we're,

388
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,490
we're just as taken apart by this machine
and pushed into a direction outside of

389
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:25,770
our control.
It's not like we want this to happen.

390
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,780
The disparity between rich
and poor in this country.

391
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:31,260
It's far greater than the disparity
of rich and poor and many miss Middle

392
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,990
Eastern place. Wow. Yeah, man, listen,
we can't get started on that again.

393
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:38,870
I'll go on an inside job. You know rampage
about the, the financial institutions.

394
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,910
It's about fucking into socks.
Let's talk about anything.

395
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,050
We watched a inside job the other day,
Steven, have you seen it? You've seen it.

396
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,850
It's mine. So brutal. Do you, what we've,

397
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:52,510
what we've done financially is the
same thing we're doing, you know,

398
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:55,990
with with other parts of the world as
far as like with resources and you know,

399
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:58,150
invading countries and dominating things.

400
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:03,040
What we're doing things with no regard
whatsoever to the consequences and no

401
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,610
regard whatsoever for in how we're,

402
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,290
we are viewed and that's the
thing about this inside job.

403
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,540
All these guys didn't have any problem
walking with hundreds of millions of

404
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,670
dollars and looking absolutely
ridiculous looking horrible.

405
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,530
If they can get away with it,
they're going to do it.

406
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:21,730
And it's exactly the same shit that's
happening thing with America and all these

407
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:23,200
other worlds and other parts of the world.

408
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,010
What's going on in Iraq would no one
is mentioning the fact that literally a

409
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,120
million people are dead over there.

410
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,440
A fucking million people died in Iraq
and we know for a fact there was no real

411
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,900
mass weapons of mass destruction.
We know for a fact they, well,

412
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,080
I mean just the fact that everybody's
like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

413
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,900
Keep going forward. Like we're
not addressing that because Joe,

414
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,180
we have to focus on the important things.

415
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,790
Killing funding for
planned parenthood and,

416
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,900
and early education because we have
to do some serious cuts. We have to,

417
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,250
we can only drop so many
billion dollar bond, isn't it?

418
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,760
The government like shut down right now.
Is there no government?

419
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,420
Is this a part of Armageddon? Is this
just one more thing? Like those dolphins,

420
00:21:58,421 --> 00:22:01,570
Dolphins died all in 2012 I thought
like the Mayans just got lazy and they

421
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,370
didn't want to count anymore.
They're like, fuck it. All right.

422
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:04,650
Much more complicated than that.

423
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,330
It's way more complicated based
on that procession of the equinox.

424
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:11,310
It's based on a 26,000 year cycle, but
you know, it doesn't mean that the,

425
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,190
it's the end of the world.

426
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,170
That's the crazy thing is that nowhere
in the Mayan calendars does it say,

427
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,060
then it sends the end of the low
long count. It's, it's a new era.

428
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,290
That doesn't mean anything. It could just
mean that, you know, generally speaking,

429
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,730
humanity like develops in cycles,
you know, that's what the uh,

430
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,750
the Hindus believe to the Uga is the
whole idea of the Yugas that there are

431
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:33,340
cycles of humanity and then we eventually,
just by virtue of our design,

432
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,110
we get to a point of laziness and sloth
once we have it all down, you know,

433
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,220
like we do today.
Right.

434
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,290
And then eventually it would spiral out
of control and then be the dark ages

435
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,490
again. Well, I,

436
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:46,240
they were heading towards the dark ages
or like trans is one of the two or both.

437
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,150
Right. Fucking you,
you hoarding, you know,

438
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:53,890
all the automation and the inside some
gigantic electric city where everyone's

439
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:58,420
in some hive mind state just called
this guy on barbarians outside the gate.

440
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,170
I mean you, even if you connect to
the hive mind, I mean if they're,

441
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,570
if that does happen, it's, transhumanism
actually does manifest itself.

442
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,740
We're still going to have people
that are living in Guam, right.

443
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:09,940
How are we going to get them
and put chips in them? Nope.

444
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,240
But they're going to be used to mind
than is necessary to make the chips.

445
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:14,410
That's how some of them,

446
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:17,050
but in the Pacific islands is going to
go and kidnap him and we're going to

447
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,390
enslave them.
Is it going to be some Terminator Shit?

448
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,441
Who's going to be some people?

449
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,500
I think there's still going to be live
in old school no matter what you do.

450
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,400
I met some of those guys.

451
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:28,430
I met a group of ex Vietnam vets in the
Emerald Triangle that are living in his

452
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:31,980
box canyon, uh, northern California.
It says, oh, that's a where the county,

453
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,140
it's where they grow the dog.
So what happened?

454
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,460
So I'm up there and I'm
chatting with this guy,

455
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:38,530
be e Smith who's an ex Vietnam vet.
Uh,

456
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,190
he was the first guy busted
by the feds after, uh,

457
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,040
after it was like legal statewise and
he's growing in a box canyon like 17 other

458
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,800
ex Vietnam vets. There's not, it's
only one road in one road out.

459
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:50,630
It takes like two hours to drive it.

460
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,750
And they all live there in a community
growing acres and acres of weed.

461
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,440
And are they doing it legit or they're
doing it like on the sneak tip did it's

462
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:57,980
weight.

463
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,030
I've interviewed so many people about
this and even the most legit guys have

464
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:05,720
some shady shit going on. It still
seems like no matter what loopholes,

465
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:09,650
they try to pretend they're exploiting
or we take donations and we're a

466
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,220
caregiver dude.

467
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,450
You have some shady shit your past and
you have two sets of books like every

468
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:17,950
other dispensary operator out there.
So don't, don't preach thou thank you.

469
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,750
Fucking up the cause here. These
guys under the bus. Here's the thing.

470
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,160
No one going to the camping trips with
these dudes. I, I love the cause, but I,

471
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:29,270
I do not like people. There's nothing
wrong with wanting to get fucking baked.

472
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,270
There's nothing wrong with weed. What is
wrong? Or people that are cooperating,

473
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:35,570
the medicinal marijuana movement
and claiming that they're just,

474
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:38,660
they're just stoners that are trying to
make money or like getting loaded and

475
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:41,450
they're pretending it's their medicine.
And I'm like, you know, there's no,

476
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:45,750
that's me. Yeah. Are you, are you
claiming it's medicine? I need it. Right.

477
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,840
Why can't you just like to get high? I do
that. I'll do that. Do what it's about.

478
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:52,010
I'm seeing all I agree with you.
I know what you're saying.

479
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,230
I'm going to these conventions and seeing
these guys that have like new, like,

480
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,730
oh yeah, sativa, Ben Wa balls. No, it's
the coolest medication you'll ever get.

481
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,800
It's like you're just found
out a new way to get ripped.

482
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:05,720
Ron High for your asshole.
Don't pretend that a sativa Ben Wa balls.

483
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,940
It's just something you just made up,
but I'm sure it exists. He awesome.

484
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,800
If it was real, if a.com is
available, let's go down here.

485
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,320
This is belladonnas new video.
It's a Tiva Ben Wa balls.

486
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,320
The way to Keester everything
from champagne ecstasy to,

487
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:21,520
I'm sure there's a video online of
a young lady, I think it's hurting.

488
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:25,670
Youtube name is neuro soup,
and she took DMT up her ass.

489
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,430
DMT Up. Your ass absorbs directly
into the bloodstream like,

490
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,350
like DMT needed to get any harder. If
you could do that, if you use snort it.

491
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,350
You know what? I think that the
Internet is going to happen.

492
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:38,360
Like how the government's going to get
involved and stiff with the doing the

493
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:39,194
kill switch.

494
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,720
I almost think that they're going to
do what like web hosts have been doing

495
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:43,250
lately, which is, yeah,

496
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,740
it used to be the old days web
hosts were like unlimited bandwidth,

497
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,710
unlimited this blah blah, blah. At 20
bucks a month. Neutrality. Yeah. Yeah.

498
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,340
And I think the government's just going
to release, Hey, we have internet too.

499
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,120
You don't have to sign up for this
Internet two, but if you want to,

500
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,220
it's like a thousand times faster.

501
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,630
And the only stipulation is because
now web hosts are doing the same thing.

502
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:05,390
It's like, hey, if you switch
to cloud based servers,

503
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,600
you still get everything else,
but now you have to pay for rent.

504
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,260
But the way they're going to
do that is they're going to,

505
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,580
they're going to turn the internet,

506
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,150
you know now into that with net
neutrality or the lack thereof.

507
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,210
So it's going to be, you pay for
the Internet, you get premium,

508
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:20,780
super fast bandwidth access to the
stuff we want you to have access to.

509
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:25,070
How important is the message to people
that we need to keep the Internet free?

510
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,850
It does.

511
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,310
Most people is one of them to be one of
the most important debates of our time.

512
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,870
And the fact that they were
like, I thought Google was
going to be good on this.

513
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,700
I really thought they were going
to be the good guy in the fight.

514
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:38,450
And the deal that they did with Verizon
and the FCC is insane. It basically says,

515
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:42,800
listen, your traditional broadband, not
gonna fuck with it bro. Net neutrality.

516
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,220
You are good. Yeah. That wireless

517
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,040
spectrum space, we can
totally clamp that down. Well,

518
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,650
how many people believe wires
are in our future? None.

519
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,650
It's all going high speed wireless and
that's the way it's going to be delivered.

520
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,780
And they're pretending
like, you know, they're,

521
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,190
they're going to totally
clamped down on that.

522
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:59,430
So you're going to pay for your Internet.
It'll probably be provided wirelessly.

523
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,740
And then if you want access
to really good stuff,

524
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,890
so in a t and t and p a t and
t and being for life, right?

525
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,760
Well,
why concern is censorship.

526
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,120
My concern isn't just over control of
bandwidth and stuff like that. My console,

527
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:14,730
but control the bandwidth is, it is
you're right, you know, you know? Yeah.

528
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,700
The ability to disseminate information
as quickly as possible is one of the most

529
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:18,960
important parts about it.
You know,

530
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,420
I think that eventually we're going to
have to figure out how much control we're

531
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,070
going to allow the government to
have over us because you know,

532
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,010
people as a group collectively,

533
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,720
you have to realize that there has
never been one thing in human history

534
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,100
responsible for more access to information
than the Internet and it's because of

535
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:39,210
the free nature of it.

536
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,960
The fruit that you could put up a website
right now and just put up the craziest

537
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,650
fucking shit you want and people will
go to it and then it gets, oh hey,

538
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:48,870
check this out and virally.
It spreads.

539
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,200
There's never been anything like
that ever in life except rumors.

540
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,660
Rumors were the only things
that have been spread.

541
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:57,000
Liz took years to go from
one place to the other.

542
00:27:57,001 --> 00:28:00,510
Now it's instantly the Richard Gere
durable and the but rumor. Right.

543
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,900
That shit was spread over the
whole country. You know, they took,

544
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:08,250
it took a long ass time
for that to happen. No Pun
intended. Yeah, no pun intended.

545
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,660
But what he's talking about. But that's
the only thing that, you know, the,

546
00:28:10,661 --> 00:28:14,550
the Internet, anything is just like the
Richard Gere dribble up the bud story.

547
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:18,540
Any literally anything can
be any new item that happens,

548
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,240
like literally gets to your Twitter.
Like almost instantly,

549
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,070
like my Twitter is responsible for like
80% of the shit I read online is like

550
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,200
someone tweets me stuff,
you know, like, dude,

551
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:30,450
you gotta check this out and it's
now and I just retweet it back.

552
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:33,660
It's like people are tweeting
me the most fascinating shit.

553
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,750
If I lived 30 years ago,
this would never happened.

554
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:40,350
You would have to live in a university
town and you'd have to either teach or

555
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,200
you'd have to be around students all the
time or you'd have to be in some sort

556
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:47,220
of a really challenging job where the
other people that are around you were like

557
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:50,410
really creative and constantly
reviewing information. Right.

558
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,750
In order to get this kind of a kind
of a richness in like what comes in,

559
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,000
you know,
we were so lucky man.

560
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,010
And yet I'd save what 7% of Internet
users take advantage of that. You know?

561
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,980
And that's, that's the hardest part
and now it's being, it's so convoluted.

562
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:07,800
You have no idea where that information
is coming from. Is it remotely reliable?

563
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,710
Internet is just a, it's a,
it's a, it's also a clusterfuck.

564
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,380
It is tricky because there was
one thing that I read yesterday,

565
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:14,370
it was a really fucking for,

566
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,400
there's a couple that I've read
but there's one about this.

567
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,800
This is the FBI freedom
of Information Act.

568
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,940
Oh that website we can go and see all the
articles that up there at printed this

569
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:28,050
one cause it's ridiculous. Is the
guy named Guy Hotel, h o, t, t,

570
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,370
e l I believe is his name.
And Yeah.

571
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,460
And he put out some fucking freedom of
information act thing about Ufo shows,

572
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:41,680
man.
But listen what it says,

573
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,270
an investigator for the air force stated
that three so-called flying saucers had

574
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,910
been recovered,
had been recovered in New Mexico.

575
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,660
They were described as being circular in
shape with race enters approximately 50

576
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:56,440
feet in diameter. Each one was occupied
by three bodies of human shape,

577
00:29:56,441 --> 00:30:00,970
but only three feet tall, dressed in
metallic cloth or a very fine texture.

578
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,800
Each body was bandaged. Uh, in a
major, it's, it's hard to read the,

579
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,080
of blogging to the blackout suits
used by speed flyers and test pilots.

580
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,300
This is, uh, some pretty crazy shit.
I don't know if this is a hoax.

581
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:19,030
I don't know if this is horse shit.
What year was this?

582
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,160
It happened in 1949.
1950 Roswell at the talking about,

583
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:28,150
or yeah. Yeah. A bunch
of midgets out made.

584
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,670
Just try and take over the world,
crashing their shit.

585
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,690
I just don't know if this is for shit,
but it is on the FBI fucking page.

586
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,010
It's on the FBI. Um, it's, it's the, the,

587
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,410
the page on this guy.
I mean,

588
00:30:40,411 --> 00:30:43,750
all it's saying is that investigator
said that someone said something that

589
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,280
really says, I imagine that if there was,
if that was any more concrete of proof,

590
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,010
it wouldn't be out there. So that's
one of my favorite stories, man.

591
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,330
The Roswell stories.

592
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:56,740
One of my favorite stories because
it's pretty universal that everyone saw

593
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:58,240
something and it just,

594
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:03,241
so many people like General Phillip Corso
and these or as admiral and whenever

595
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:07,630
the fuck isn't title is, but um, all these
people that were in the military that,

596
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,010
that saw things and testified after the
fact and their stories are so similar,

597
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,150
you know, and you know, after
like 10, 20, 30 years go by,

598
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,720
who the fuck knows what you're really
remembering right now? Who the fuck knows?

599
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:22,480
I mean there's, you pick up a piece from
someone else's story and yeah, I mean,

600
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:25,060
you talked to Oj Simpson right now,
that guy do it.

601
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,050
He might have some crazy fucking story
in his head where he really didn't do it.

602
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:32,020
I mean, who knows? But um,
this New Mexico thing, to me,

603
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:36,370
it's fascinating because they printed in
the paper that we've recovered a crash

604
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:40,000
flying desk, you know, that the air
force had communicated to the newspaper.

605
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:41,350
We have recovered a UFO.

606
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:43,930
Like it doesn't mean it wasn't
some sort of a Russian thing.

607
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:47,350
It doesn't mean it wasn't one of their
own things because it also doesn't mean

608
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:50,470
it wasn't a fucking flying saucer
or there, you know, who would,

609
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,850
who was saying all this like maybe the
reporter just like asked some dummy that

610
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:59,500
was like, yeah, I saw an alien. Um, I
could tell you because I have it in the,

611
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,570
in the hallway.

612
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,050
I have the actual thing frame for
article because it's fascinating. But no,

613
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:05,884
it was,
uh,

614
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,970
it was a high level guy and then the next
day he had to come out and do a press

615
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:14,830
release and they brought like pieces of
a balloon of weather balloon wreckage

616
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,970
and they were saying, oh, this,
it was just this stuff up.

617
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,200
I used to do a joke about it, you
know, they said, what about the aliens?

618
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,380
All those were Mexicans. There were up in
a balloon. They were drinking something,

619
00:32:23,381 --> 00:32:26,740
shenanigans took place. Apparently there's
mistook the balloon for Upenn, Yada,

620
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,550
nothing to worry about it by the way.
We've just invented transistors,

621
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:34,510
but very little research.
I've never heard that.

622
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,320
It's an old one. Yeah.
Yeah. That was my, um,

623
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,880
the crashed Ufo that they've recovered
now. The Roswell thing is that that was,

624
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,150
yeah, that's an 99. That's a
go along with my settee. One,

625
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,420
the said he wanted to live like,

626
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,370
takes like 3 million years for a signal
radio signal reach outside the galaxy.

627
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,950
So you send out hello? Is anyone out there
3 billion years later? What? Oh yeah,

628
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:58,611
man,
that's been a while.

629
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:02,270
I do the Seti search at home where
your computer would help analyze data.

630
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,610
They got back to try to thought
about doing it, but I'm like,

631
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:08,180
you're just going to hog up my
fucking computer. Shit ever.

632
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:12,800
I do listen. If they want to talk to
us, they can talk to a stupid, you know,

633
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:15,840
I mean that's dumb. You know,
the idea that, you know,

634
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:19,910
we need to sit around monitoring
some fucking radio spectrum.

635
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,360
I think that if anything is going to be
able to communicate with us from that

636
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:26,450
far away, they're going to
be so fucking far advanced.

637
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,160
All you'd have to do is be in a different
environment where you don't have the

638
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:34,400
threat of asteroidal impact.
That's it. That's the big one,

639
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,640
asteroid impact and a stable
planet, a planet that, you know,

640
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,740
it doesn't have all the crazy
shit going on at this point.

641
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:42,860
It does with super volcanoes and shifting
of the polar ice caps and stuff like

642
00:33:42,861 --> 00:33:45,230
that now, which you know, we know happen.

643
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,380
I do get the notion of of listening
though for the same way that we might be

644
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:51,230
broadcasting something out. Like if
you're going to roll your dice, yes,

645
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,041
they're probably busy,

646
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:54,110
millions of light years ahead of
us in advanced and intelligent,

647
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:55,840
but at least common denominator.

648
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,540
Maybe there's another human being species
out there that is still broadcasting.

649
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,020
I love Lucy episodes and Olympic
opening and you can listen for that.

650
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:04,850
I get that notion. Yeah,
I get the notion too,

651
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:07,010
but I feel like if you're going to
get to us, they're going to get to us.

652
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,390
It just seems like I w I
loved the uh, woman who, uh,

653
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,500
the Jodi foster movie contact with
based on fascinating that woman,

654
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,850
the woman is really doing that.

655
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,450
She was really out there in the middle
of the fucking desert that don't we need

656
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:23,210
an alien attack, like nothing.
Nothing too drastic to happen,

657
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:25,130
but just a common enemy to unite us all.

658
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:28,720
So we'll realize that we are human beings.
We can all band together.

659
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,750
Then we could really research them.

660
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:32,990
Cool space travel shit and telephone
orders or whatever else we need.

661
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,260
The most trippy thing would be if we
realize that aliens came from not another

662
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:39,050
planet, but another
dimension, oh, from here,

663
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:42,230
but in another dimension that they were
dimensional travelers. And you know,

664
00:34:42,231 --> 00:34:44,870
the concept of dimensions is
pretty fucking squirrely to people.

665
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,530
But I always try to explain it
as if it's a radio, think of it,

666
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:53,120
life life has a radio and we are
currently tuned in to 97.1 it doesn't mean

667
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:56,570
there's not a one on 1.1 right down
the dial. That's just as vibrant.

668
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:59,870
We just haven't tuned into it.
We're just not picking up that frequency.

669
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,950
That's very possible,

670
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:03,620
isn't that what they were trying to
achieve with the Hadron collider is

671
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,080
obviously studying black holes
and whatnot. But the, the,

672
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:08,360
the notion that they could
control that explosion,

673
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,710
like if they built one in space,

674
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:12,290
they could control the explosion in that
explosion would actually be a portal or

675
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,940
a wormhole. Wow. I don't know
about that. I know that the,

676
00:35:14,941 --> 00:35:16,770
the black hole thing was sort of the,

677
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,420
that's sort of residual effect of trying
to create the Higgs Boson particle.

678
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,890
And if what that is,

679
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:25,490
is a particle theoretical particle that
only existed in milliseconds after the

680
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:29,010
Big Bang, which is also theoretical.
Right. You know, so they're,

681
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:34,090
what they're basically doing is seeing
what happens in the extreme conditions of

682
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:37,460
the universe and trying to
recreate it. You know, it's a,

683
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:40,290
it's a trippy thing
because, you know, the, the,

684
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,630
the idea is that they're
not going to stop with this.

685
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,950
The idea is whatever findings they learned
from the large Hadron collider will

686
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:49,920
be applied to the next, to
the next giant device. I mean,

687
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:53,990
when they first came up with a atomic
bombs, you know, that was, that was the,

688
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:54,990
the peak of science.

689
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,040
And since then it's accelerated and
gotten bigger and crazier and there's some

690
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,410
shit I'm sure that they're working on
right now that we can't even wrap our

691
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:02,970
heads around. Like when you, when you,

692
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,010
when you hear about quantum computing
or you're a computer guy, you're,

693
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,600
you're a geek squad, you're
a geek web number. Yeah,

694
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,070
you're a bad mother
fucking fix your modem.

695
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:14,390
When you hear about quantum computing,
I have tried to,

696
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,020
I've read many papers on quantum
computing. Can I take a deep breath?

697
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:21,550
And I read them again and I take a deep
breath and I read them again and I try

698
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:24,480
to wrap my fucking brain around
exactly what they're saying.

699
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:27,210
But it's so squirrelly. It's like, Whoa,

700
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:32,110
this is getting awful lot like magic.
You know, this is the APP and it's,

701
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,730
I mean that's, but it's not magic.
That's exactly notion that they're,

702
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,900
but they're also going
to control at biology,

703
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:40,330
they're going to wrangle cells to do
calculations instead of silicon reading,

704
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,560
artificial leaves.
If you seen that this is the latest thing,

705
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:47,580
they've created an artificial leaf
that actually has actual artificial

706
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:52,470
photosynthesis. Wow. That's
amazing. Future of power. And
it's too, yeah, the future.

707
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:54,960
I love that. I love that. You
know, I thought disasters and drip,

708
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:56,340
not to bring this to a much lighter note,

709
00:36:56,341 --> 00:37:00,300
but I thought disasters in Japan would
lead to a finely intelligent adult

710
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,050
conversation.

711
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,930
Although I hate the term adult
conversation about energy in this country.

712
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:06,810
I thought maybe we'd get us to solar
and looking into photosynthesis and all

713
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:08,840
this stuff, and you know
what? It's done. It's done.

714
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,100
Started a scare fucking scare tsunami.
You know,

715
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,360
this whole country is
terrified in Orange County.

716
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:17,330
There's a fault line and there's
a new global higher boom.

717
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,173
We're doing what happens.

718
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,660
That's what everybody should find about
scared by nuclear energy. That's great.

719
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:25,380
But channel that paranoia into creating
positive technologies instead of relying

720
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:29,400
on coal and deep sea drilling, see
that would require enlightenment. Ah,

721
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:33,660
and we are children. Human beings are
as childish as we are allowed to be.

722
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,620
You know? And I, I see that every
day. I see that in having kids.

723
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,530
I see that in just in human
being and lazy behavior.

724
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:43,980
People are as childish and
indulgent as they have to be.

725
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,760
And that's why we're so fascinated when
we hear about some Amazon tribe that

726
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:52,500
goes out and gets their own fucking
water with hollowed out coconuts and you

727
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:55,740
know, they fucking shoot monkeys would
spear guns and that's what they eat.

728
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:59,250
You know, like you, you read about
that and you go, Whoa, how resourceful.

729
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:00,930
Like what a grind they're putting.

730
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,810
Like there's no room for
laziness and that culture,

731
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:06,740
like these motherfuckers are out there
doing it because we know what the

732
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:11,520
possible with human beings, but we
also know how we are inclined to sloth.

733
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:16,150
You know, it's like, it's so easy
for people to just be like, Ooh, Ooh,

734
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,640
Ooh boots. Fug It's, you know,
it's so easy. It's so easy
to think like, I'm sorry,

735
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:22,160
it's just,
I have listened.

736
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,200
I was watching a video of a guy squat
on a mason jar and it popped in his ass.

737
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:29,070
Uh, what were you saying about what we
say? That's the most disturbing thing.

738
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:30,960
I think I've ever seen that one guy.
One Jar.

739
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,990
Love it right up there with Mr
Hands. It's right up there. Um,

740
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,460
have we touched on, uh, well you,

741
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:41,590
you mentioned something earlier that I
wanted to get back to about what would we

742
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:45,030
as a society, society is sick bay, except
from our government in terms of control,

743
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,210
revolt and all this stuff.

744
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,370
And I'm still amazed every damn flight
I take when I look at the TSA procedures

745
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:55,300
and I see people just standing in those
x ray boxes and just filling their

746
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:58,410
bodies with gamma rays to
prove that they're not a
terrorist. What do you do? Do,

747
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:03,190
do opt out? Not opt out. Really? Yeah. You
got a patent down there, man. Absolutely.

748
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,760
Wow. There was just a study recently
that they have to retest a whole bunch of

749
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,490
machines because it was
like 47% was the number,

750
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,060
more radiation was coming out per
machine than what they estimated.

751
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,740
I don't need some dude getting a fucking
image of myself on some box that he

752
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:20,340
could send around. I don't know.
You know, and I don't think that,

753
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,120
I would never lie. I, I, if I
were, if I were hung any better,

754
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:31,000
I would be in jail because I would
show it off every five seconds. And I

755
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,250
constantly, constantly depressed at
the sad state of affairs down there

756
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,900
dozer guy with a micro penis that I got
in an argument with about male feminism.

757
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,800
Yeah. And a long story. But the
point is that, you know, it's,

758
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:48,030
it's become like a point of debate where
like some guys have been upset at me.

759
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:50,430
Like what is your,
your issue with male feminism?

760
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,400
My issue is the same thing as women
that are masculine Isms, you know,

761
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:58,260
or masculine aesthetic, you know,
any women who is only in demand,

762
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,770
like men power and man power globally or
even into it to the point where you're

763
00:40:01,771 --> 00:40:02,604
promoting it.

764
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:06,210
Just promote equality amongst human beings
as far as the way we treat each other.

765
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,750
But there's something creepy
about mayor fee, male feminists.

766
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,490
And that's why I wanted
you to pull up that video.

767
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:13,560
Brian and I tweeted this yesterday,

768
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,940
it's by these guys that called
themselves the conscious men. Okay.

769
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,040
And it is like an apology
and a like a a manifesto.

770
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:27,300
I'll read the description on
behalf of men or apology to women,

771
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,970
apology to women and on behalf of men
to women because they are conscious and

772
00:40:32,971 --> 00:40:35,390
they were trying to get in touch
with their femininity. They are.

773
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,460
I've never seen a bigger group of w w
look like date rapists and creeps and and

774
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:46,860
just uh, knowing fucking weak ass bitches.
Have you been to comicon? No, I haven't.

775
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,460
Okay. Is it different? Is it worse?
Watch this though. You must do this.

776
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:53,760
You have to see this for, for,
for folks listening, listening,

777
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,360
don't listen to me no matter what I
say. Listen, even if you agree with me,

778
00:40:57,361 --> 00:40:58,470
I'm an idiot.
Listen,

779
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,890
listen to this band before you.

780
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:04,840
Today as men committed to becoming more
conscious in every way we feel deep

781
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:08,530
love, great respect, and are
growing. By the way, the man talking,

782
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,420
his name is gay Hendricks.

783
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,520
We also feel deep sorrow about the
destructive actions of the unconscious

784
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:17,500
masculine in the past and present.

785
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,600
We want to apologize and make amends for
those actions today so that we can move

786
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:25,900
forward together into a
new era of the pink spoon.

787
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:30,370
What does he know what that is?
That's a fountain. Like they're calm.

788
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:31,204
They're enlightened skill.

789
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:36,310
Why listen to the music and then
she to me in you in all of life,

790
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,540
I know that we all have access to
the full spectrum of these energies.

791
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,020
If you see this guy, you
realize how fucking creepy
the sound's going. Awareness.

792
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:49,790
There's gotta be a vital for
skittles, hold humanities. I admit it.

793
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:52,190
I can only think about Kevin
ribbon and living in [inaudible].

794
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,780
I can work with a mass with the music
I'd play. When you look at these,

795
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,131
look at these.

796
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:01,850
I know that in order to truly honor
you as a multidimensional a woman,

797
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,230
I must add fully present and and
the gifts. I bought drugs from him.

798
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,750
Absolutely.
I look at this guy,

799
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:13,030
rapist and your train each other in a
conscious way. Clearly leaders' eyes.

800
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,070
He's got an ankle bracelet specs and by
worshiping at affinity expressed with

801
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:21,200
the masculine and the feminine energies,
that Guy's full of shit.

802
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,560
That guy's just looking for blessing.

803
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,800
Look at his little smile at the end
has often been unconscious. I feel so.

804
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,810
These all look like people that
went to a camp to pray the gay away.

805
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:39,170
This guy's reformed. He's totally
into pussy now. Yeah, from wicker man.

806
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,300
It's a woman burning at the stake.
It's like women burning. Get the cross.

807
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,900
Here's what you don't understand that
Bernie, the crossing was explained,

808
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,420
relegated you to subservient chores,

809
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:55,630
force you to hide your faces and even
cut off your organs of sexual pleasure.

810
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,720
That I
get a little extreme that I'm aware of.

811
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:03,310
The forces at the unconscious,
masculine psyche, pouty of

812
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,320
masculine psyche.

813
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:09,830
Many of the men who have appraised this
guy's mastering my psyche and its mouth

814
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:11,570
for a lot among the living.

815
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,730
Many men may not be able to apologize
because they remain shock called and a

816
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:19,700
prison of anger. Fear.
You're a shitty poet, dude.

817
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:24,020
Be Half of my gender to you.
Don't you say shit.

818
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,200
When we were angry,
scared,

819
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:32,720
and when the grip of destructive forces
in our psyche and I choose to no longer

820
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:33,940
contribute to those forces,

821
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,000
I just noticed room smells
like it's wooden paneled
and the tears in the biology

822
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,950
smells like faggotry Snodgrass,
Star Poker player guy.

823
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,510
Is this the most ridiculous shit ever?

824
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,830
Thousand Years I've been mainly founded
by this guy who propagated by men.

825
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:54,080
We've often activism Brody Stevens and
God and the spiritual life and all.

826
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:58,170
We have visits with an invite and you
guys got to emit an invite to a Trump

827
00:43:58,171 --> 00:44:01,400
circle is this big contest they need.
Just got done selling meth,

828
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,470
inclusive spirituality

829
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,910
to honoring the stayed
away from the devil.

830
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:12,930
Hardly I honor your deep
connection to the earth.

831
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:16,880
Oh, how's man? Right, so I had an Innie
now was that the point? All of these guys,

832
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:18,350
it just crawled back into my stomach.

833
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,850
All you guys are willing to
roofie you domination who stay.

834
00:44:21,851 --> 00:44:26,851
Can we believe that expansion to protect
us from encroachment and in the process

835
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:30,020
we violated the sanctity of
yours. Okay. Start with it's math.

836
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,183
I can't even watch it.

837
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,740
I understand that they have good
intentions and I'm sure they're not really

838
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:36,690
rapists,
but you've got to understand folks,

839
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,710
you all what we would classify as weak
ass bitches and that's why you're feeling

840
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:45,090
this way and that's why you're feeling
like you need to go out and save the

841
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:48,070
world and make these women look.
Women are going to be fine. Yeah.

842
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,210
Would be nice to women. Absolutely.
Other than making youtube,

843
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,160
they're trying to look cool.
They're trying to,

844
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,610
they're trying to get really
broken women to like them.

845
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,910
You know the kind of women that look,
they can't attract them.

846
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:02,610
They're not interesting. They're probably
not successful than not intelligent.

847
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,270
They're not swole,
they're not sexually attractive.

848
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,050
They probably have nothing going on.
No.

849
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,100
Puts them in a diaper
in a cage and whip them.

850
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,080
I don't even think that
that would be too exciting.

851
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,180
They have less than that and they,
I think to have that,

852
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:16,740
I think that pay for that.
We're not the nose.

853
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,720
I think you just fucking
speculating at this point,

854
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,900
aren't we all but the world here,
right? Let's speculate away.

855
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,480
But what they are is weak ass
bitches and we don't need that. Well,

856
00:45:24,481 --> 00:45:28,830
the those men need is stakes and
squats and bootcamp and, and, and,

857
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,670
and someone who gets them
a fucking interest, get
whatever the fuck it is, man.

858
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:36,480
So let's make an apology video on behalf
of men for them. And it should be,

859
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,800
that's what it should be. We should
dear we gas of the world, dear women,

860
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:43,080
dear women who have been,
you know,

861
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:47,220
compromised by these knuckleheads to
try to pretend that men aren't men and

862
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:50,550
women aren't women and there's some
sort of a hybrid that you can be, well,

863
00:45:50,551 --> 00:45:54,630
you can appeal to the women and embrace
your feminine energy. Dear rude,

864
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,220
I'm sorry you've had a crate and barrel
magazine Humping Douche bag to walk over

865
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,830
your whole life. But I promise
I will waltz into your bedroom,

866
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,740
choke you during climax and
probably spent in your mouth.

867
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,660
If you can't gorilla fucker check,

868
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,660
you better know some poetry
and that's the reality.

869
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:12,010
You better know how to write
some shit down and make it rom.

870
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,130
You better know what kind
of flowers she likes.

871
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:17,480
You better be good at massages
and if you're lucky, Shelia,

872
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,750
and should probably barely be wet sand.

873
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,670
She's not really into
dude cook our salmon,

874
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,550
but her trainer might fuck the shit
out of her. I'll tell you that.

875
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,500
Her training my fucker in a parking lot,
man,

876
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:32,110
he might just whip out his fucking hog
and a parking lot. You never know, man.

877
00:46:32,111 --> 00:46:35,490
Right on the polities. Machino why?
Here's why. You're ready. You're ready?

878
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,130
We're animals. Okay? We're not
perfect. Yeah, we're evolving. Yeah,

879
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,540
it's the ideal is great. Be Be, be
nice to people. That's all good.

880
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,030
But here's what you also have to do.
You gotta be a fucking man.

881
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,650
If you want women to like you,
you gotta be a man.

882
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,520
That's why you don't like dykes. Why do
you not like tags? Because they're weird.

883
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:53,400
It's not like this is not being there,
not being a woman. It's not. It's not.

884
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,770
Even though she's a woman.
What's not sexy about it? Well,

885
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,380
there's some weird thing there. She's
acting like a man. Well, guess what?

886
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:01,800
Fuck head women think the same way
about men who act like women. All right?

887
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,040
Men want women. Women want men.
It's really that God damn simple.

888
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,400
You can't be some fucking hybrid
to fill in the gaps and, and take,

889
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,620
you can't actually do whatever
the fuck you want to do. I mean,

890
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:12,020
who am I to tell you?
But you know,

891
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,650
you're just going to get you
to set up all to where you can.

892
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,260
You can actually create the gap for
yourself. You want to live in chastity?

893
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:18,630
Bono can do it. She's a
man now. I just got to,

894
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,970
I thought it was the girlfriend telling
me to shut the fuck up and she said

895
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:25,370
right on. And I was like, okay, cool. She
sends you a text. She texts him and shit.

896
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:30,190
Oh No, I love that. How long you been
dating a girl? Uh, I officially about

897
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,020
two years now. [inaudible]
your pimp music. So did you
never dated a living man?

898
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,010
Mom, you were dating the
whole time. Then another girl,

899
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,100
what'd you call the Mun Dickson.
His mouth.

900
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,830
Were you when that apology video?
I think a lot of things.

901
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,580
I think a lot of the Internet always,

902
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:49,270
I was kind of jealous of you
or never dated. Never dated,

903
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:50,470
never messed around everyday.

904
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:55,350
That's a distinctly different things
that I think I have pretty lucky to do.

905
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,170
You can't, you cannot mix,
you cannot mix those cards.

906
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,260
You got to treat them like
they're your sisters man.

907
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:04,270
I'd never had a sister and I swear to
God by the end of that run I was like,

908
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:07,210
I know exactly what it's like to have
a sister. Absolutely felt that way.

909
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,200
What does she smell like?
Vaginas and flowers,

910
00:48:12,201 --> 00:48:15,070
dreams wishes burnt salmon,

911
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,220
salmon.

912
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,180
But you've been really successful over
at GE four they eat that whole network.

913
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,040
Pretty much centers
around a couple of people.

914
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:28,420
You and extended play people or
whatever it's called nowadays.

915
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:31,480
But uh,
how did you even fall into that?

916
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:34,600
Because I mean when I first moved
to California, I had no friends,

917
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,680
zero friends and it was when the screen
savers just moved to La and pretty much

918
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:40,450
I had nothing to do at no friends.

919
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:43,000
So I would just go to live
tapings all the time just for fun.

920
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,450
Cause that was a cool show.
Yeah.

921
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:50,460
So I got to hang out with like the Kevin
Rose and Yoshi and all of them and I,

922
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,250
it was the only thing I did.
And how did you,

923
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:55,990
you were kind of looked at as the bad guy,

924
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:58,750
I guess if you have a tech
TV side of things. We were,

925
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,100
I was somehow lumped into the evil empire
that came and absorbed this network

926
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:06,340
and explained to everybody who doesn't
know the history. All right. Uh,

927
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,460
so there was a network called tech
TV based out of San Francisco,

928
00:49:09,461 --> 00:49:13,750
which I was a huge fan of super.
Nowadays screensavers call for help.

929
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,290
And what was the dude with the white
hair that would review Game Leo? No,

930
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:20,320
you're talking to Adam Sessler.
Yeah,

931
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:23,080
he's still on g four is
annex PLO game show Megan.

932
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:26,770
But there was this weird
sort of buy out of TV.

933
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:29,120
It wasn't like some hostile
takeover or anything like that. And,

934
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,490
and unfortunately I think that at
the time the merger was mismanaged,

935
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:34,121
it was sort of like,

936
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:38,800
well I think network interests were buying
distribution and not buying content.

937
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:41,170
And that was the problem. And so
it was just sort of like, okay,

938
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:42,130
we have all this distribution now,

939
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:44,530
let's just merge these networks and
we'll figure it out and let it fly.

940
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:47,800
And so unfortunately I got stuck in a
situation where they were transitioning a

941
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:51,850
show that I loved the screensavers and
to this other show without thinking that

942
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:55,540
the audience might not like that you turn
on the dial one day and it's the same

943
00:49:55,541 --> 00:50:00,280
time, the same kind of program, but it's
a different name with, with some of the,

944
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,290
some of the nerdiest stuff
stripped out and all that stuff.

945
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,450
And so it got a lot of bad blood,

946
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:06,940
which unfortunately still exists
today on the Internet. Like I get it.

947
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:10,120
I always tell people when I meet them
that were tech TV fans that go like

948
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,150
screensavers, I go, listen dude,
I love that show too. You know,

949
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,240
and I hope that people realize
now it is a different show.

950
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,810
And unfortunately the transition was
rough and awkward and I still take lumps

951
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:22,900
for it all the time when I go out and
be upset about the most, like you said,

952
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,920
the geekier elements were to walk away.
They took away everybody, all the,

953
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,090
the people that we like.
One of the coolest thing is,

954
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:32,590
is that before it all happened, the
screensavers, he used to have webcams,

955
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,620
they just put all webcams in and the
day it happened, Alex put on this image,

956
00:50:36,621 --> 00:50:40,230
which is, uh, Alex say goodbye
everyone. Yeah. And, and it,

957
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,310
it pretty much everyone on the
Internet found out about it first.

958
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:48,350
What's crazy is though I had the same
hat as him and the same shirt as him.

959
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,310
So I put,

960
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:55,690
I put tss is canceled under it and I had
the same outfit and same hat on there

961
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:57,500
and that got around the Internet.

962
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:01,160
So everyone thought at
first the screensaver was
canceled and stuff like that.

963
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:05,530
And just do that as a scam, a
troll as a troll and then, and then

964
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:07,500
you don't know how fucked up this guy is.
Let me,

965
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:10,040
let me show you one of the things
that he did. You fortunate he owned,

966
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,060
he owned Pepsi spice.com. Okay.
When Pepsi Spice came out,

967
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:17,720
Pepsi spice was like this innovative new
beverage. It's Pepsi, but it's spicy.

968
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,630
Well this asshole found out that Pepsi
spice hadn't gotten a their own domain.

969
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,660
They didn't secure the domain.

970
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:28,810
So Brian starts a daily blog on Pepsi
spice about going on Pepsi's Bisoli Diet

971
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,740
and he, he, he starts only
allowed to drink Pepsi.

972
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,890
Deteriorate your body straight.
Fucking horrible. Tell
people what, is it still up?

973
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,780
Uh, no, I took it down
cause I was, Pepsi is there,

974
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:45,400
they're going to sue me or something
like that. But, but it lasted that,

975
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:49,540
I said in 30 days only going to have
Pepsi spice. So it started off where,

976
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:52,060
you know, the first couple of days I'm
like, I'm really hungry, but you know,

977
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,510
whatever.
Then I started getting like open sores.

978
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,770
I was fucking pissed and blood
and then it got too bad where I'm,

979
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,400
my Dick is falling off. I was losing like
10 pounds a day or something like that.

980
00:52:03,401 --> 00:52:07,970
This is like 2000 right? Yeah. This was,
this was a while ago. A long time ago.

981
00:52:07,971 --> 00:52:10,820
It was probably like 2004 or something
like that. Was it 2004 were you here?

982
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:14,350
I was here when it had nothing to
do except go to the screensavers.

983
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,870
I'll get her. But, but what's crazy
is that I even had radio interviews,

984
00:52:19,871 --> 00:52:23,590
they interviewed me on radio stations
because they thought it was real and then

985
00:52:23,591 --> 00:52:25,870
it started, Pepsi started getting
contact and he's saying, you know,

986
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:27,130
they're threatening me.
So I had to kind of,

987
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,500
I made my character
die and I took it down.

988
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,050
But you could find this
stolen Google cache and stuff.

989
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,900
But you know what the other thing does
that work? What does Google cache work?

990
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:39,520
Google cache is kind of like what's, you
know, RSS feeds. They grab your website,

991
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,040
RSS feed,
they go out and they crawl your site.

992
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,030
You put it out there and not say crawl
your page is looking for key words and

993
00:52:46,031 --> 00:52:48,130
images of whatever their caching,
all that shit.

994
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,120
They're saving the whole Internet
saved kind of to an extent. Yeah.

995
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:56,020
They really kind of do a lot of
broken images though, but sure. Yeah,

996
00:52:56,021 --> 00:52:57,730
definitely on the
Internet way back machine,

997
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,110
the Internet archive wayback machine is
so fun. You can go ahead and go work.

998
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:06,040
It saves kind of thing based off
the cash at safe snapshots of sites.

999
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,120
There's broken images and whatnot,

1000
00:53:07,121 --> 00:53:09,100
but you can go back and look
at Yahoo back in the day.

1001
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,050
If you went home website
and go back and look at it,

1002
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,500
they can still do your website
98 that was my first website.

1003
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,540
Thank God youtube wasn't yet.
You're almost 10 years old.

1004
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,480
You're old websites on there. Yeah, me
too. Oh, you're what sites on there,

1005
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,370
but this is a question
I wanted to ask you,

1006
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:24,570
cause you used to work with
Laura Foi or yeah, it was.

1007
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:27,300
I was for slash Laura Foy,

1008
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,730
who's a really hot blonde chick that
used to be on a really cool show with uh,

1009
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:36,780
Scott Rubin and Tina Woods. It's
called g four tv.com. Anyways,

1010
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:39,000
she forgot one day.
That's her webcam.

1011
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,500
Then it's like right
when they put on webcams.

1012
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,370
So I caught her all these times just
sucking her thumb and she didn't know the

1013
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:48,870
Webcam was on. Is this something they
see like openly did around the office?

1014
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:53,740
Because I even got photos of her when
she found out that the Webcam was used to

1015
00:53:53,741 --> 00:53:56,040
do,
do what you're supposed to do.

1016
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:59,010
Dude is not let that out and find her,

1017
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:04,020
but a honey on your dick or do you
remember what I don't think. I don't.

1018
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:04,481
I think fully,

1019
00:54:04,481 --> 00:54:08,270
I would rather have the thumb sucking
photos online then suck honey off a member

1020
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,230
personally. No, no. That
might be really into that.

1021
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,030
I'd be willing to put money on
it. You're so wrong. A guarantee.

1022
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,880
You can test the in front
of a Webcam. Come on, dude.

1023
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:21,690
She's hoping the FBI's tuning into that,
sending that message.

1024
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:25,740
We referred her fucking thumb. You're
sucking a cock. Okay. If you're not three,

1025
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:26,723
he's talking to cock.

1026
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,300
Remember when cats Swartz put out a
bunch of photos and then somebody learned

1027
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:34,680
about the thumbnail being saved in
Photoshop. Now what are you talking about?

1028
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:39,570
Who's cats for cans? Sports used to
be also on the screen savers. Playboy.

1029
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,410
I personally signed pink slips or some
shit that was due to that right there.

1030
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,190
I didn't see that. She used to also
someone's little sends to their faults.

1031
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,350
You are reacting to all the fun,
the vial from the Internet.

1032
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,210
I'm actually pretty good friends with,

1033
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:58,590
I'm friends with cat and her baby's daddy
and everything that baby's daddy works

1034
00:54:58,591 --> 00:55:00,990
for South Park and that's how she,
that girl that was on,

1035
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,040
she did playboy or something? No,
no, no. This is what she did. She,

1036
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:07,200
she released some photos of herself,

1037
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:11,370
like model photos and there were not,
not not new photos taken.

1038
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,700
But what happens is like
when you put in Photoshop,

1039
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:17,730
it saves like a thumbnail of the photo,
like inside,

1040
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,250
like the information of the data
insight, the photo, like the,

1041
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,830
like each photo has data in it.

1042
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:26,320
Like a lot of times it has gps
information or it has camera.

1043
00:55:26,321 --> 00:55:29,280
It was taken on with the settings where
there's extra data in addition to just

1044
00:55:29,281 --> 00:55:32,370
the image. So they, she cropped it
before she put it on the Internet.

1045
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,160
But what it's saved the
original as a thumbnail.

1046
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,780
So when she released all these photos,

1047
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:38,670
people found out that they
opened it up in Photoshop.

1048
00:55:38,671 --> 00:55:42,990
The preview showed the full original
photo of her naked and so there was all

1049
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:45,930
these photos of cat naked,
which was awesome for it.

1050
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:48,780
Kind of like Paris Hilton to her career,
but they were not,

1051
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:51,630
some of them were not the most flattering.
Explain this to me again.

1052
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,440
What happens is the original
images were like Photoshop.

1053
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,130
Photoshop had a feature where you could
like publish a web gallery, you know,

1054
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,980
publish it directly to the web. I think
that's the, it's been a long while,

1055
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:03,000
but I think that's how the story went.

1056
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,660
So it actually published layers that
were shut off and she had cropped one and

1057
00:56:06,661 --> 00:56:06,871
again,

1058
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:09,840
like the thumbnail was sort of saved of
the full image even though she cropped

1059
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:12,600
it within the program.
So how would they access it?

1060
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,320
They opened it up in Photoshop to look
at it in the information transferred over

1061
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:18,380
in Photoshop so you can see the preview.
I said.

1062
00:56:18,381 --> 00:56:20,340
Then she just pretty much
leaked all these naked justice,

1063
00:56:20,341 --> 00:56:23,040
sue the fuck out of Photoshop for her own

1064
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:28,130
benefit. It benefited. There was us,

1065
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:30,580
there was a program that would look at
people's photo bucket accounts back in

1066
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:34,240
the day and then PR procedurally changed
the file names looking for files that

1067
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:39,241
were sort of hidden or not publicized
and so many girls had private photos that

1068
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:42,400
they were storing are sending to their
right as long distance boyfriend exposed

1069
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,040
by crawling that there were so many
cool things back in the day when the

1070
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:45,910
Internet was still like,

1071
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,520
people are still figuring out
the barrier to entry was high,

1072
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,150
the Internet was fucking dope. Like I'll
never forget the bulletin board Danes,

1073
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:55,930
we had to like know how to do a dial out
telex program and call some shady dudes

1074
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:59,770
computer in a basement who was hosting
porn and where's games and all that stuff

1075
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:02,980
we were talking about, which are well
and good, but this is way better today.

1076
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:03,970
That's all nine science.

1077
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:08,680
It's very nostalgic to go back to
those bulletin board days on a 1440

1078
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:13,700
[inaudible] be and I would hear those
noises and immediately get erect.

1079
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,120
Yeah, I knew that porn was
coming, right. We do do,

1080
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:18,760
remember we were talking about wet
tricks that we are both Dreamcast fans,

1081
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:22,350
but I remember going on like AOL message
boards and stuff and getting all like

1082
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:26,950
every single video game possible burnt
onto a disk and that was IRC for that.

1083
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,470
What's the best for dream cast
if we're going to IRC rooms,

1084
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,670
that's where the real creepy shit.

1085
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:34,510
I used to be a big quick player so I
used to get on the IRC or were you in the

1086
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:38,260
room and they released Q test one
will know that was a quick one.

1087
00:57:38,261 --> 00:57:41,200
I wasn't a big one too.
Yeah,

1088
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:44,760
and I followed it through quick three
and into quick fourth quick fours.

1089
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,330
One to really have to stop. Now it's
like quake arena on a web browser. Yeah,

1090
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,540
quick arenas is shit. All of it. It's
fucking fun as hell man. But it's all,

1091
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:53,680
it's just super time consuming.

1092
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:56,800
We've talked about it a hundred times on
this podcast, the drinking game. Quick,

1093
00:57:56,801 --> 00:58:00,430
quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
Ha Ha. Blacking out drunk now

1094
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:06,880
the next thing you know, so Google TV
did. Tell me about yes, please get in on,

1095
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:10,060
explain me this amazing.
We were in the kitchen.

1096
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:12,810
You pop this up and I made you stop
talking to them like this is too good.

1097
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,250
Threatened me with a butter
knife. I'm like, I have to stop.

1098
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:17,710
We need to talk about this on a podcast.
Uh,

1099
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,760
Google is gonna try to own the living
room and it's going to be them apple,

1100
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:22,780
potentially Comcast,

1101
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:25,600
Time Warner and a few others that are
really going to be making the play for

1102
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:29,830
being the gateway to media and Google is,
Google is crushing it right now.

1103
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,090
Basically Google TV,
you can buy,

1104
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:35,020
I have the Logitech revue box
and it has an HD my pass through.

1105
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,600
What does that mean? That means if you
have a cable box or a satellite box,

1106
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,390
you connect that instead of going
directly to the TV or receiver,

1107
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,290
you plugged that into the
Logitech tech box, right.

1108
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:45,070
Then that goes to your TV and
what that does, what that does,

1109
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:46,540
which no other box really does,

1110
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:49,750
is it gives you ability to layer
information on top of your TV.

1111
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:50,621
All these other boxes.

1112
00:58:50,621 --> 00:58:53,500
You've got to switch to another input
and you lose the TV side of things and

1113
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:55,960
it's a different experience. Then
you go back to your TV. This one,

1114
00:58:55,961 --> 00:58:58,930
at any given time, you have
an argument about, oh, what
was that actor in that one?

1115
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,270
Boom.
You hit the search button on your iPhone,

1116
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,550
your android phone or the keyboard,
type it in,

1117
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,550
there's indb up and running while your
stuff's in a picture. In picture window,

1118
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,400
you want access to podcast and video cast.
You hit the home button,

1119
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,000
go to their spotlight.
Uh,

1120
00:59:11,001 --> 00:59:14,140
there's actually a website that's doing
an app where you watch models go down a

1121
00:59:14,141 --> 00:59:16,840
runway and it tells you about like the
fashion they're wearing and if you want,

1122
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:20,200
you click press okay and it pulls up the
website while the video is still going.

1123
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:22,070
You can order it right from wow on

1124
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,180
your team, on your TV and it's got a full
wet. The box is a little underpowered.

1125
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,900
It's like a little net book in there.
It's a little underpowered.

1126
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:31,010
But this as a step one is fucking,
is there a one that's coming out soon?

1127
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:34,040
That's the better one, or is there
a better Google TV than the other?

1128
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,180
Like there's this stolen one the best.

1129
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:37,700
I think the logic is a little better than
the Sony because of the remotes in the

1130
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:38,810
end, the apps themselves, right,

1131
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:43,010
but as long as content providers don't
completely fuck this platform over which

1132
00:59:43,011 --> 00:59:45,590
they're trying to do left and right,
because they're also scared,

1133
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:49,310
it will be amazing. How are they trying
to fuck over by blocking their content?

1134
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,130
Who's some basically doing this? I don't
know if I can name names, name names.

1135
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,210
Let's start a fucking revolution. I'll
tell you what. I'll tell you what.

1136
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:58,910
I wanted to watch a south park episode
the other day and I went and pulled up

1137
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,880
south park's website and now again,
if I had my laptop,

1138
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,060
I can pull it up right there and watch
the full high def south park episode,

1139
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:06,500
sit through commercials or whatever.
The right there.

1140
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:09,200
When I tried to pull it up on my
TV, it popped up and said, oh,

1141
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,590
you're trying to access this
from a Google TV device. Sorry,

1142
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,530
is that Comcast your block right
now? No, that's it was south park.

1143
01:00:15,531 --> 01:00:17,600
So I think that's Viacom.
I think I'm safe to make fun of them,

1144
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:22,420
but it also did that on blocks. So does
Hulu, which is fucking frustrating. Oh,

1145
01:00:22,421 --> 01:00:26,240
that's suing because the same ads that
they're their, their, their worry is that,

1146
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,010
you know,
the Google experience is too good.

1147
01:00:28,011 --> 01:00:30,680
You're sitting on your couch and this
content that's for free on the Internet,

1148
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:33,110
it's easily accessible. And I go, well,

1149
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,440
it's the same ads and the same content
that I'd have if I turned over here.

1150
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:39,500
If you had a Mac mini hooked up your TV
and use my laptop or using my whatever,

1151
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:42,920
someone over there is not getting it, you
know, I'm willing to sit through the ad.

1152
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:44,750
I'm willing to to make
it worth your while.

1153
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,270
It's like when I try to go watch a movie
these days, I don't know if you've like,

1154
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,600
I tried to legally acquire content
now actually tried it the other day.

1155
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:53,300
I wanted to watch Jurassic Park,
so I checked my Xbox,

1156
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:57,050
I checked my video on demand, I checked
the Sony Network, I check Netflix,

1157
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:00,770
I checked Amazon. I went through service
after service and finally said, fuck it.

1158
01:01:00,771 --> 01:01:03,530
I went and looked at bit torrent.
There was the high def rip,

1159
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,240
there was the Blue Ray
repp with all the extras.

1160
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:07,400
I clicked and an hour later
I'm watching it on my TV.

1161
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,400
I tried to give somebody
money for that movie.

1162
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,550
He's never [inaudible] was
unable to happen to me.

1163
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,810
It's basically the old guard that hasn't
really accepted the new technology,

1164
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,060
this new thing, and they're scared of it
and we drastic park. That's ridiculous.

1165
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,410
Well,
I mean that's why I'm like drastic part.

1166
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:25,310
That should be on Netflix streaming.
That shouldn't. Yeah, exactly.

1167
01:01:25,311 --> 01:01:28,250
I mean that should be everywhere. It's
incredible. When you get Google TV, man,

1168
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,260
it will. It will sound right
to you. It's that good.

1169
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,130
It's really that good and
it's very frustrating that
people are blocking content

1170
01:01:34,131 --> 01:01:36,050
though. It's super frustrating. Let
me look. There's ways around it,

1171
01:01:36,051 --> 01:01:40,350
but is there a reason? Do they
have a legitimate argument? Well,

1172
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:45,650
Zero Bill Burr RSS Feed interactions.
No, there's nothing that makes sense.

1173
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:50,000
Just like that argument. Um, the,
the, they're worried that again,

1174
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:52,550
the experience is too good.
We can't just give that content away.

1175
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,860
How can we charge extra for that content?

1176
01:01:54,861 --> 01:01:56,450
Like Hulu says they're
working with Google,

1177
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,480
they're going to try to charge for Hulu
plus on the Google TV or something like

1178
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:03,590
that. That's fun. It's nickel and diming
left. So you'd have to pay for Google TV.

1179
01:02:03,591 --> 01:02:05,570
Do you have a,
is it a subscription based service?

1180
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:09,920
Now see that's the beauty of Google TV
is free itself is terrifying and it's a

1181
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:10,754
great overlay.

1182
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,210
We really found out the good
that artificial intelligence
actually does exist.

1183
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:17,930
And what it is is Google and the Google
figured out a way to fucking program the

1184
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:21,300
universe and own everything.
I mean, it's so weird.

1185
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:26,580
I use a government at chrome browser.
I use Gmail. I mean, come on man.

1186
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:29,880
It's going to be apple and Google
and that's going to be the big,

1187
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:32,130
the big fight for all of your data
and all your media access and all your

1188
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:35,160
management. Maybe Google, Amazon. But
fuck, it's going to be right in there.

1189
01:02:35,161 --> 01:02:39,420
Did you see the onion bit about Facebook
being created by the CIA as a data

1190
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:43,060
mining tool? No. Fucking brilliant. That's
fun and it basically said that, you know,

1191
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,050
Facebook was launched as a secret program
and it took off wildly successful.

1192
01:02:46,051 --> 01:02:49,800
They never imagined that citizens would
give up all their photos, their likes,

1193
01:02:49,801 --> 01:02:53,640
their dislikes, their check ins,
check outs. It's like, imagine,

1194
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:56,910
forget Google, that's the
data set. That scariest shit.

1195
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:00,420
Google long longitude or whatever
where it just tracks you all day.

1196
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:03,920
That's even worse.
We were talking about lobby view,

1197
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,860
longitude and what that is.
What does that,

1198
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,600
that's where your phone pretty much tells
you, tells you friends where you are,

1199
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:11,940
exactly where you are.
You could track your girlfriend exactly.

1200
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:16,860
Driving down the street and it's just
sending it to Google. That's a great idea.

1201
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:19,590
Right? It's weird. It's
weird how it's just creepy.

1202
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,870
If it leads to better ads in my email,
cool.

1203
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:25,890
But it's just amazing how fucking
ambitious Google is. They're so ambitious.

1204
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:30,150
I mean the do this and the browser
and cars that drive themselves,

1205
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,210
aren't they working on an operating
system that they already had the chromium?

1206
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,930
It's based on chrome and honeycomb for
tablets, which is going to be awesome.

1207
01:03:36,931 --> 01:03:39,810
Like it says, their operating
system is available right now.

1208
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:43,510
You can download chromium for certain
net books. You cannot get right,

1209
01:03:43,511 --> 01:03:45,930
and have you tried it? Yeah, it's
not. It's not where it needs to be.

1210
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,080
Now the idea is that in the future,
cloud computing is going to lead to,

1211
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:52,350
I mean we're going to laugh at the fact
that this has a processor that has a

1212
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:56,130
processor. That computer behind
you has ram and chips in it.

1213
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:58,680
We're going to laugh at that. What a
waste of resources. It's going to be.

1214
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,400
Your phone's going to be
streaming basically. Yeah.
Basically all you need is,

1215
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:07,080
is whatever technology needs to happen
to stream a high def signal at 60 or 30

1216
01:04:07,081 --> 01:04:08,970
to 60 frames a second to
whatever device there is.

1217
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,060
So the idea is that in the future you'll
have just have a screen or you'll walk

1218
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:15,030
into a hotel, you'll sit at a
terminal, you'll punch in your info,

1219
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:17,670
or it'll scan your retina
or your peanut cup,

1220
01:04:17,671 --> 01:04:20,640
however they'll do it and all of a
sudden your desktop appears like that.

1221
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:23,040
All of your shit's on it. You
leave, you pick up your phone,

1222
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:26,880
your desktop appears on it. Like that's,
that's the future of cloud computing.

1223
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:30,120
Everything's going to be stored and
processed in servers that we don't see

1224
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:33,380
because it will be beamed quick enough
and it already exists today and phantoms

1225
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:35,120
going to bring it to fandom.

1226
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,890
That was a vapor ware console.
But like if you look at online,

1227
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,790
which is a gaming service,
it's not quite there yet,

1228
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:45,480
but the idea is that you buy one box.
Did you guys just get the fuck out? Shit.

1229
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:47,840
Yeah, did right. Phantom was a check.

1230
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,970
Phantom was supposed to be a console that
would sit in your living room and pool

1231
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:52,470
games out of the cloud essentially,

1232
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,340
and you'd never have to
buy a disk or whatever.

1233
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,800
You can play from the comfort of a couch
and it's like streaming video games and

1234
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:02,040
it was fast enough supposedly to be able
to play where there's no drop and frame

1235
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:05,100
rate or you could actually, you
know, and that was all bullshit.

1236
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,480
That was all a money laundering scheme.

1237
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:10,260
So subdued could crash Ferrari's
canyon or whatever. Yeah,

1238
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:13,920
there's a company called on
live that is one of many.

1239
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:15,250
There's another APP called [inaudible].

1240
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,160
We used it the other day and it's
like it's got its hiccups, but imagine

1241
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,970
when you log in a service
you'd see thousands of
windows streaming call of duty

1242
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:25,810
in streaming a gears of war and all this
stuff and you can go and click on it

1243
01:05:25,811 --> 01:05:29,530
and those are actually people playing
live and you're spectating all their games

1244
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:31,930
and they're all streaming in real time.
And then if you want to play the game,

1245
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:33,190
they're playing,
you press a button,

1246
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,580
it pulls you out of it and launches you
right into that game that exists today.

1247
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:39,760
Now it's not a five out of five just yet.
What is it now for three?

1248
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:44,320
Probably a three, two or three things is
what we gave him. The promise is there.

1249
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,420
So that's what Google's
trying to do with chromium.

1250
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:49,060
They're trying to make this operating
system where you don't store shit locally.

1251
01:05:49,061 --> 01:05:53,500
It's all Google docs and Google paint and
Google image video editor and all that

1252
01:05:53,501 --> 01:05:57,310
shit. It's all going to live in the cloud
and you'll be sure that it's so creepy.

1253
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,960
They're right.
They're absolutely right on that one.

1254
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:02,680
You know like Microsoft always creeped
me out to Bill Gates always creeped me

1255
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:04,600
out like any,
anyone who's dad ambitious,

1256
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:09,460
the trying that hard like come on
man, what's going on? Does that,

1257
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:12,910
why does that creep you out? I don't know.
Cause they have so much this assembly,

1258
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:15,830
different products that are so successful.
You're very ambitious. You're no,

1259
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,450
not in that way. I don't want to control
anybody else's information. You know

1260
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:22,730
the thing that always bugs me,
like here's a perfect example. Uh,

1261
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:26,010
like the iPad or the
iPhone eight what I made,

1262
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:29,910
I made a video a long time ago where it
pretty much broke down in the one of the

1263
01:06:29,911 --> 01:06:34,000
two I iPhones. And you guys actually
played it out on your show where it,

1264
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:35,160
remember when I had the,

1265
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:39,120
I'm an old iPhone and I'm an old cell
phone from three years ago and it was like

1266
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:43,680
I have a cute, yeah. Yeah. It was a pretty
big video and stuff like that, but it's,

1267
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,730
it was based on basic things like the
iPad where the first iPad didn't have a

1268
01:06:47,731 --> 01:06:49,830
camera. The second one has a
camera and stuff like that.

1269
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:53,400
There's so many things like do you think
that apple is actually doing that on

1270
01:06:53,401 --> 01:06:55,440
purpose? Is that a part
of their mark? Totally.

1271
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,440
I mean they'll do the research search

1272
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,650
and do enough focus groups to find out
what features they have to include to

1273
01:07:00,651 --> 01:07:05,220
make it amazing, palatable, magical,
revolutionary, whatever and undergo.

1274
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,190
Okay. The next version
we'll have all these things.

1275
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:09,980
Just like when this launched without
picture messaging and all sorts of stuff,

1276
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,100
like they know what the consumer
is willing to put up with,

1277
01:07:13,101 --> 01:07:17,480
especially those early adopters. Picture
thing was bullshit typing in the code.

1278
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,430
That was the most ridiculous thing ever.

1279
01:07:19,431 --> 01:07:21,800
And then you'd get like you
go to at and t wireless dot,

1280
01:07:21,801 --> 01:07:25,100
whatever and put in this login and this
past and it was a tiny ass little image

1281
01:07:25,101 --> 01:07:27,110
too. It wasn't the full
image. It was ridiculous.

1282
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,750
It's ridiculous to me and
not to get on a nerdy rant,

1283
01:07:29,751 --> 01:07:33,400
but that's all I really have to offer
this world is the fucking fact that if,

1284
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:37,300
let's say I have Verizon and I'm paying
40 bucks a month for their data plan and

1285
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,180
18 know better and then if I want to
tether that phone to my laptop to use this

1286
01:07:41,181 --> 01:07:43,490
as a modem,
I got to pay an extra fee,

1287
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:47,180
but it's still eats away at the
bandwidth that I'm paying 40 bucks for.

1288
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:51,710
Is that because the FCC and senators
don't realize that it's all the same

1289
01:07:51,711 --> 01:07:54,320
bandwidth and no,
I think it's Verizon making money.

1290
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,730
It's kind of Shitty with your fucking
that changed at and t does the same.

1291
01:07:58,731 --> 01:07:59,900
They charge you extra to tether,

1292
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:03,810
but it's the same bandwidth that I'm
paying monthly for the group to use that

1293
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,510
their data serves is not very good.

1294
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:10,130
I had an 18 team phone of iPhone and
then I got a Verizon iPhone recently and

1295
01:08:10,131 --> 01:08:13,670
one thing I notice is that I'll have a
full three g signal and Verizon and then

1296
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:14,990
I'll start downloading something,

1297
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,490
an app or something and it'll kick off
three g a t t to eight is better than

1298
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,240
than Verizon. Have you seen their
LTE network longterm evolution? No.

1299
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:27,360
That shit is fast, faster.
That's where is it? Is it habit?

1300
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,650
Verizon's is out team. What? I mean
where can you get it everywhere?

1301
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,300
I don't know about here. You can
get in Los Angeles, it's a pretty,

1302
01:08:33,301 --> 01:08:38,270
it's pretty common. Spotty spots by the
end of HTCs. Thunderbolts has that right?

1303
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,390
That looks pretty bad.
That's bad. I mean like we,

1304
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:42,710
we were a star even in our little studio,
which is like,

1305
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,640
it's Kryptonite to all signals.
It's a little shoe box right in there.

1306
01:08:46,641 --> 01:08:50,600
The Lte was as fast as the cable
modem was. So the idea is again,

1307
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:52,460
the whole net neutrality
thing that I'm worried about,

1308
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:57,410
like you'll goodbye or like a Verizon
wireless LTE router for your home and

1309
01:08:57,411 --> 01:09:00,170
you'll wirelessly pulled down your
bandwidth and share it with everybody else

1310
01:09:00,171 --> 01:09:02,180
cause it's that fast now wireless.
Wow.

1311
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:04,400
That's a lot of things that
have to change his cell phone.

1312
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:08,100
So like I had a palm pre plus I
got stuck with, with the Verizon.

1313
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:12,260
I wanted out so bad and it's going
to cost me now $350 to cancel.

1314
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,650
And I've had it for a year and a half,
almost a year. And I just want to cancel.

1315
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,400
I just, yeah, that phone seem real
promising before it actually came out.

1316
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:21,400
And then I was like, well it's kind of
Shitty and Wong get dropped it a dude.

1317
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:25,850
I got a um, uh, a new droid droid
to global because I want to,

1318
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,410
I love Verizon service.

1319
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:31,160
I had a blackberry before and I
wanted to get a Verizon service,

1320
01:09:31,161 --> 01:09:33,890
but I wanted it to be global. So I
said, oh well here's the solution.

1321
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:35,750
All these people love the droid.
I mean,

1322
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:38,480
I heard Howard stern talking about
how he loves his joy. I got it.

1323
01:09:38,481 --> 01:09:42,740
It's like a drunk, retarded
iPhone. It's like stupid.

1324
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:45,260
And like the,
the first time I used it,

1325
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:48,290
I go to slide the screen to open it
up and it's like, shake, stutter,

1326
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:51,500
shake starter, shake, stutter. I'm
like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Really?

1327
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:54,620
This was the students. It doesn't even
know how to harness how much power it has.

1328
01:09:54,621 --> 01:09:56,330
That's the thing.
It's scared by its own ability.

1329
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,690
Played with it for 20 minutes and the
battery was half drained and I was like,

1330
01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:02,570
you gotta be fucking kidding
me. I mean, that's ridiculous.

1331
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,900
Like I can't even fuck around and
just play with it. I went online,

1332
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:07,960
I checked what it looks
like on one websites.

1333
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,880
I checked my email 20 minutes
and it was half dead. I was like,

1334
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:13,180
that's just preposterous.
And people are like, oh no,

1335
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:15,950
you go to goodwill or mobile application,

1336
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:19,030
command power command and shut off
this and do this. It's like, oh,

1337
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,220
I don't want to hack my devices anymore.
I just want them to work.

1338
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,120
And that's the fundamental,

1339
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:27,600
there's so many people that have this
thing about the fucking jail breaking and

1340
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:28,460
that's too complicated.

1341
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,670
There's so many people though that
have this anti-apple sentiment.

1342
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,630
You know there's a real,

1343
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:36,860
like these threads come up on a message
board all the time and it's so dumb.

1344
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:41,960
It's the dumbest conversation ever.
Everyone was a merger of rugs. That's the,

1345
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:45,800
that's the number one argument match
very of what was fucking fuck and I could

1346
01:10:45,801 --> 01:10:48,660
use a merch. I don't know how
to use a real computer, but if,

1347
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:52,280
if you want to bypass the line at the
genius bar, you can by swallowing. Really.

1348
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:56,140
It's a weird, it's a little bit, what
about girls? It's apple care girls.

1349
01:10:56,150 --> 01:11:00,210
The genius aren't as I swallow them to
swell, whatever they've got, whatever.

1350
01:11:00,211 --> 01:11:04,970
He got the biggest shoot,
hardcore Unix guy,

1351
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:07,100
command lines only switched to windows.

1352
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:10,370
I was a network administrator back in
the day when I switched to Mac. I'm like,

1353
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:13,530
listen, shit works and if I really
want to drill down, get deep,

1354
01:11:13,531 --> 01:11:16,020
I can pop open a terminal window
and do whatever I need to do.

1355
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:20,070
The people that are that are anti Mac,
just like the Mac people are anti PC.

1356
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,880
It's all fucking students.
A team like this way,

1357
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:24,930
so it's a dumb team thing
and the Max or the liberals,

1358
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:28,470
the Max or the week pussies
and then you know from Max,

1359
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:30,030
the pcs are all Sarah Pailin.

1360
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:33,970
Same thing with consoles like playstation
or it's like fuck you ThreeSixty

1361
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,410
fanboy through Xbox owners like
playstations for Douche bags.

1362
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:38,970
It's like no one wants to be wrong.

1363
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:42,150
No one wants to admit that they might've
bought the console that has a problem

1364
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:43,800
or spent money on the
game that had a problem.

1365
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:45,150
You want to be right and it's like,
you know what?

1366
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,830
You're not going to be right all the time.
It's with everything.

1367
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:48,840
Protestants versus the Catholics.

1368
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:54,360
That whole Mac versus PC thing.
It's just such a strange one though to me.

1369
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,800
I wonder how many people,

1370
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:59,520
like whether they're politicians or
people trying to appeal to a certain class

1371
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:04,290
of society will choose a PC
over a Mac to let you know,

1372
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,780
hey, I'm a part of the proletariat.
Like Obama saying, Hey,

1373
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:09,810
I got to my pad when he made a big
deal out of it and like I use an Ipad,

1374
01:12:09,811 --> 01:12:12,680
I'm the president of United
States. Must be right. Yes.

1375
01:12:12,681 --> 01:12:14,880
Sending messages is they
higher end president?

1376
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:17,910
This is a more connected
and multitouch sensitive.

1377
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:22,130
It was the first president to bring a
laptop to the White House. To you serious?

1378
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,870
Yeah. Well I remember he wouldn't
give up his blackberry at the time,

1379
01:12:24,871 --> 01:12:27,920
which I thought was cool because
it wasn't secure. You know,

1380
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:30,270
one thing I wish the iPad I was,
I can't believe it doesn't have,

1381
01:12:30,271 --> 01:12:34,020
is multiple users. I hate it when people
want it. Like borrow my iPad. I'm like,

1382
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:39,000
okay, I'm logged into Facebook, Twitter,
email, everything. I mean girls, girls,

1383
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:42,120
why does it that, that seems like a
basic thing that I should have by now.

1384
01:12:42,121 --> 01:12:45,600
This is what you say. Listen, bitch,
get shown. That's what you gotta say.

1385
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:50,220
You gotta fucker correctly. Okay. Liberal,
panting and sweating. And she goes, can I,

1386
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,590
can I use your iPad? You don't
listen bitch. No, I love you.

1387
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:57,510
Get your own fucking iPad. And she'll
giggle and she'll drop it. Why?

1388
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:01,450
Cause you fucked her correctly
Brian. Okay. Is that there
in lies the issue? Yes.

1389
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:05,160
Or get another iPad. You can
have mine. You'd give it to her.

1390
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:05,821
Tell her she can use it.

1391
01:13:05,821 --> 01:13:08,280
As long as you're looking over a shoulder
because she's in like a downward dog

1392
01:13:08,281 --> 01:13:11,590
position and you're behind her, then you
can play all the fucking dungeon. Ray,

1393
01:13:11,591 --> 01:13:12,120
do you want,

1394
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,480
did you learn to play the drums using
rock band or have you always been a

1395
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:17,750
drummer? I self taught and
been drumming for awhile.

1396
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,450
Have you been in a band before? Several.
Several shitty bands, jazz bands,

1397
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:26,070
hardcore rap, jazz bands, everything.
Really. What kind of jazz? You name it.

1398
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:31,100
I mean we did take five bands have the
biggest percentage of Douche bags in them

1399
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:35,340
up. Music. I mean they all do it.
Just a course on getting douche bag.

1400
01:13:35,341 --> 01:13:39,750
You are Christian rock jars.
Claire fuckers shooting rock rules.

1401
01:13:39,751 --> 01:13:42,780
Do they all have douchebags in him?

1402
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:45,930
But I mean I think that's the number
one issue though with bands, right?

1403
01:13:45,931 --> 01:13:48,090
I mean Eddie Bravo has been
in bands his whole life.

1404
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:52,710
He said the number one issue has always
been dealing with like trying to like

1405
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,720
manage all the egos and the band.
It's like hurting cats and that's,

1406
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:59,910
that's what kills so many bands are not
chats. Cats running around like mad,

1407
01:13:59,911 --> 01:14:03,110
like the herd cats. That's
perfect. Uh, and, and I,

1408
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:06,030
I've seen that with many bands that
I've been in, but it's, it's just,

1409
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,940
and it's fucking hard to
make music these days.

1410
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:11,260
It's as easy as it gets with
distribution and the tools to make it,

1411
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:13,510
it's still really fucking hard
to make a music these days.

1412
01:14:13,511 --> 01:14:15,730
Has that always been your dream
to be in a band or what was,

1413
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,100
you would put it all in a second.
Yeah.

1414
01:14:17,101 --> 01:14:20,740
I'd quit everything in a second to go
make music for, for living of life.

1415
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:26,050
Theoretically, yes. But
obviously I haven't done that
yet. So what we'll do, I'm 28.

1416
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:29,520
Oh, you're still okay now still. And
I got no tread on my tires. No, dude,

1417
01:14:29,521 --> 01:14:33,880
you're young. If you were 38, I would go,
Ooh. Yeah. Good luck. [inaudible] music.

1418
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:37,930
You know what? I don't, I fancy
myself a nonjudgmental person,

1419
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,000
but I fucking judge
people when they look me,

1420
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:41,830
look at me and tell me that
they don't appreciate music.

1421
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:45,980
And I met a surprising number of them
recently too. They don't appreciate it.

1422
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:50,390
I know a lot of people who would say,
you get music playing, give me one.

1423
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:56,400
I don't want to hear your songs.
You want me suck your Dick. Would

1424
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:59,950
I Haley listened to your music?

1425
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:03,000
That's the kind of hook or
Kevin gets to really whiny.

1426
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,360
It doesn't like the house music.

1427
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:09,361
I laugh Hugh grant's I poker that
I became famous for a little bit.

1428
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:13,810
Yeah, got that blow job.
So what, like explain,

1429
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,810
I've met people that will say they're
not into music and I don't get that

1430
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:19,810
because to me it's a universal language.
Just as much math.

1431
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:22,690
But I think even more so than math,
it's, it's inherent. You know,

1432
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,760
there should be a love or a sense
or an understanding of rhythm.

1433
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:26,230
There's something special about it.

1434
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:28,690
There's something unique about it
that we're not really addressing.

1435
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:33,070
It changes the way your
physical body feels. It makes
you more excited. You know,

1436
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:35,860
it does things to you, inspires
you, it makes you feel good,

1437
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:38,170
it brings you back to
moments of your childhood.

1438
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:42,410
It's one of the most incredible works
of art forms of art that we have at a

1439
01:15:42,411 --> 01:15:46,090
great [inaudible]. So weird the
science behind some of it. Like with,

1440
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,220
I wanted to know why house music,

1441
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,460
it was something that persistent thump
got me up and made me want to move and it

1442
01:15:51,461 --> 01:15:52,840
seems to move some people and whatnot.

1443
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,960
And it's like lower end frequencies
are triggered to primal portions of our

1444
01:15:55,961 --> 01:15:58,000
brain that we're sensitive to hearing,
uh,

1445
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:01,870
approaching animals and elephant herds
and all that stuff. So it triggers that,

1446
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:05,200
oh, I better wake up, be alert, got to
get going. And so that persistent thump,

1447
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,960
what drives you and keeps you going.
There's so much craziness going on.

1448
01:16:07,961 --> 01:16:11,410
So tribal music, like literally
like fires up shit in your brain.

1449
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:15,360
So you should wake up in the morning
bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

1450
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:19,180
I play stampeding elephants when
I wake up. That's all I listen to.

1451
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:22,240
You need to get on a podcast with
Eddie Bravo. We need to have you.

1452
01:16:22,241 --> 01:16:25,210
And him together cause he's got some
crazy theories about music and the,

1453
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:29,170
Oh here's the 12 notes and
the 12 astrological signs.

1454
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,480
There's isn't there a 13 astrological sign

1455
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:36,370
and it's shifted people. They were like,
oh my horoscopes had been wrong. I'm like,

1456
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:39,700
yeah, let me do that real quick on
that yet. But I like being a Leo.

1457
01:16:39,701 --> 01:16:41,920
I don't want to be a whatever.
I forget what I'm now.

1458
01:16:41,921 --> 01:16:45,280
If with the new method are you
really something different? Yeah,

1459
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:48,850
it changed a lot of people. You were a
Leo before? Of course. You're a Leo too.

1460
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,010
We're both Leah.
What is your date?

1461
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,760
August 4th and your August
11th you're not a real Leo.

1462
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:58,690
I like to think Miss Cleo cut you off.
I'm still Leo. They cut. I cut you off.

1463
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,030
Let me say August 10th nope.

1464
01:17:01,031 --> 01:17:04,900
Your cutoffs on two September 16th you
were August 9th is that what you said?

1465
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:08,000
August 4th August 4th it's over
bitch. I know. What do I know?

1466
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,070
Like something gain and
her cancer. Oh, do you guys

1467
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,250
subscribe to this perfect cancer?
Oh, I don't know. Not really.

1468
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:18,260
I think Miss Cleo got a panel together
in her ivory tower and said, listen,

1469
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:21,530
astrology kind of moves in the Google
searches. Let's create a new sign.

1470
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:24,640
The crafty one though.
Oh,

1471
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:29,740
I use C h. U s. How's that spot?

1472
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:34,220
What do you say that, how do you pronounce
that? Oh, perfect. That's the new one.

1473
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:37,160
That's November 29th to
December 17th. So if you, uh,

1474
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,030
you have that crafty new Zodiac sign,
I dunno,

1475
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:45,470
you know how the moon affects,
uh, like the ocean, right?

1476
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:48,500
Like you know, the different tides,
the tides and everything like that.

1477
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:52,970
Have you ever thought that maybe the
moon changes us because we're like, what,

1478
01:17:52,971 --> 01:17:55,910
99% water?
[inaudible] fuck with us too.

1479
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:59,060
We would have some own tied and shit
going on in her. Everything does.

1480
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:03,020
But is that a yearly thing? Is
there the mute moon cycle? Yeah,

1481
01:18:03,021 --> 01:18:04,800
the moon cycles year. That's
what seasons is, right?

1482
01:18:04,801 --> 01:18:07,490
Real problem is it would
have to be a real radical,

1483
01:18:07,491 --> 01:18:09,320
drastic change for them to measure it.

1484
01:18:09,321 --> 01:18:12,080
Like it might just because it changes
the way you feel is statistically,

1485
01:18:12,081 --> 01:18:15,050
it might not show a significant
jump as far as like, you know,

1486
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:19,550
like disease or heart attacks or,
or assaults or anything crazy.

1487
01:18:19,551 --> 01:18:23,360
Cause I don't think there's ever been
anything statistically connected to lunar

1488
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:26,720
activity.
But when you hear something like lunatic,

1489
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,330
you hear like the Nate expression,
Luna Tech,

1490
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:33,740
and then it's connected to the full
moons and lunar lunar that is the moon.

1491
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:36,740
I mean that is ancient. There's
something to it, there's something to it.

1492
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:41,000
And it might be as simple as when the
moon is out, people start freaking,

1493
01:18:41,001 --> 01:18:43,660
because you could see at night, you can
see at night. That's how it's a full moon.

1494
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,310
Right. I can see who I'm mugging
is that, that's all that's good.

1495
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,270
Singalong raised the assholes. Yeah,
I could. Yeah, it could be that easy.

1496
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,970
It really could. I mean that's
a, that's a big difference.

1497
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:55,340
Or you grow up in imagery of,
Oh, full moon and you here,

1498
01:18:55,341 --> 01:18:57,500
that's when the craziest come out with
a little towel and you go, all right,

1499
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:58,311
now's my time.
Well,

1500
01:18:58,311 --> 01:19:01,220
that's one of the things I was rolling
soft shirts and go punch some ladies,

1501
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:06,350
dear woman looking no explode,
this dear woman thing.

1502
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:09,620
One of the things that Piss me off is the
women, they're not crosses, excuse me,

1503
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,950
burning a women at the stake, which
is burning witches. The state,

1504
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:14,910
they've connected that to Ergon.

1505
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:19,550
They've connected that to a fungus that
grew on wheat because they had a late

1506
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:24,290
frost and that it fucked up their
crops and the wheat was frozen.

1507
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:27,830
And then when you have wheat that
uh, you know, like if you're like,

1508
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:31,290
if food you like freeze food and then
thought out in the freezer, it again, you,

1509
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:35,600
it's really dangerous. Yeah. Degree
and all this other shit and fungus.

1510
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:38,960
And one of the, one of the
things that they've shown in, um,

1511
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:42,800
in grain samples from that era,
from that time,

1512
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:46,760
the Salem witch trials was that these,
these fucking people are high on Lsd.

1513
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,740
I didn't even know it. They were
eating Ergo they were eating this,

1514
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:52,050
this bread that has this fungus on it,
right.

1515
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,710
And it has a massive psychological effect.
So,

1516
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:56,740
of course they thought there
was rich craft the courses.

1517
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,630
They thought they were there were
under spell. You know, there were,

1518
01:19:59,631 --> 01:20:03,890
there were so confused. They were highest
fuck on Lsd. Probably massive, crazy,

1519
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:08,310
almost psychotic docents. Well, in
daily doses, on doses, upon doses

1520
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:11,370
of that. I mean that's not like that.
That shit. I mean the half life is there,

1521
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:14,070
but it will compound in your system.
And by the way,

1522
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:19,071
there's modern versions of what the CIA
did in France where they dosed up an

1523
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:23,790
entire town. They put it in their
bread and they monitor these people.

1524
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:28,050
And do people die? They committed suicide.
They jumped off buildings. I mean,

1525
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:29,940
people lost their fucking minds.
People never,

1526
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:32,550
some people never came back and
they did this across the board.

1527
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:35,160
They do this to children.
They did it to old people.

1528
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:40,220
So we know that you can cause mass chaos
in hysteria by just dosing everybody up

1529
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:45,090
with acid. And you know,
back then you didn't pass on
bread. There was no like, um,

1530
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,830
you know, gluten bread because you know,

1531
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,230
you might not get anything south.
Beaching I'm sorry, a purge.

1532
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:56,670
I do hate you go crazy when you hear
people cleansing. I'm coming to cleanse.

1533
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,310
It's not for me. I'm not shy. And
cayenne pepper and lemon juice.

1534
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,490
That's all I got right now.
And I go to bootcamp and then hate myself,

1535
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:05,010
but by a person throw up into it.
It's a cleansing.

1536
01:21:05,011 --> 01:21:07,620
Just everybody wants to fix
what they've already fucked up.

1537
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:10,020
I did that shit for seven days
where he'd just drink lemon water,

1538
01:21:10,021 --> 01:21:13,050
charcoal and you can't eat anything.
It's charcoal.

1539
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:18,060
Charcoal. The things you have to do,
you have to like before you do anything,

1540
01:21:18,061 --> 01:21:20,520
you have to buy all this
fucking shit from GNC.

1541
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:24,630
And one of the things was charcoal,
milk thistle. I like all this bullshit.

1542
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,060
I don't know why. I guess I was
show you didn't say you don't die.

1543
01:21:27,061 --> 01:21:30,060
And I think the charcoal,
maybe a absorbs shit.

1544
01:21:30,061 --> 01:21:33,600
Something that you do that for poison.
Poison. Yeah, that absorbs stuff.

1545
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:36,570
I remember that for dogs.
When dogs eat something poison,

1546
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:39,240
we're gonna make them eat a fucking
per cat. Whenever I'm at the grill,

1547
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:42,060
I crack a little one and just pop
it just in case like five HTP.

1548
01:21:42,061 --> 01:21:44,120
You want to have any assistants
that are really good for you, Brian,

1549
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,780
it's didn't seem good for you.
What happened to your,

1550
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:52,470
what did you do with this cleanse?
It pretty much made you lose weight.

1551
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:56,370
Did you lose weight? I want to fucking
throwing up your eating. Charcoals no, no,

1552
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,320
you're just not eating
anything except live in water.

1553
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:01,410
It was like 12 and we're making dinner.

1554
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,130
What people don't understand is that
completely fucks with your metabolism,

1555
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,980
but when you do something like that and
you lose weight where you're just not

1556
01:22:07,981 --> 01:22:12,120
eating anything, right, your metabolism
gets jacked and then when you eat things,

1557
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:14,630
it's harder to bring them on.
Your body don't have as much energy.

1558
01:22:14,631 --> 01:22:17,220
You're going to have it anymore. So it
doors at all. It just locks it all up.

1559
01:22:17,221 --> 01:22:20,280
Super lethargic too. But the
beautiful thing about that diet is,

1560
01:22:20,281 --> 01:22:24,090
is that if you reintroduce food
into your system after 12 days,

1561
01:22:24,091 --> 01:22:28,200
you can find out our, Geez, a lot
more accurately than if say, you know,

1562
01:22:28,201 --> 01:22:32,210
you just try it. Don't be afraid
or rice or something like a you,

1563
01:22:32,211 --> 01:22:33,810
you first started by people do it.

1564
01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:37,580
It's not like I'm not doing it to find
out if you have an issue with people kind

1565
01:22:37,581 --> 01:22:41,150
of, it does reset your system. It
resets everything for you. So then you,

1566
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:43,800
you're slowly introducing
food back into your diet.

1567
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:48,660
I think you start off with rice and
you immediately could tell if anything

1568
01:22:48,661 --> 01:22:52,020
affects you with this rice. And then
you bring in like, you know, whatever.

1569
01:22:52,021 --> 01:22:53,370
And it's kind of cool for that way.

1570
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:58,110
You analyze your diets and then you'd
apologize on behalf of all men on Youtube.

1571
01:22:58,111 --> 01:23:01,200
That's the next step.
I apologize.

1572
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:06,250
And he immediately gave half of
all men fall. Selfish behavior.

1573
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:10,270
Please take me into your bosoms.

1574
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:14,830
It's just so ridiculous. What
about cons, buddy? What about cons?

1575
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:18,550
Cause they're out there. Okay. And I hope
you'd get one and I hope she wrecks it.

1576
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:22,930
She wrecks the whole thing.
Joe, we shouldn't give it
naturally and I worship you.

1577
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:28,090
Oh wonderful. Magical woman.
Sounds like Superman's dad.

1578
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:32,840
Another guy that came to kill superman
Zod doesn't really sound like that.

1579
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,120
The unit brow guy.

1580
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:39,000
Wonderful women who want to massage
your calves with Goat's milk and

1581
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:45,150
yogurt. I want to massage
your buttocks, goats, yogurt.

1582
01:23:45,151 --> 01:23:46,750
So I want to weep on your vagina

1583
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:54,430
of such a magical boobies. I didn't
want to fuck you tonight, sweetheart.

1584
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:57,850
I just want to look at it. These guys are
at it and read. Read it. Russian poetry.

1585
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,840
These guys, by the way, have a whole
bunch of other videos where, how did,

1586
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:06,430
how to men find real feminism inside
them and Feminine Energy Inside Them?

1587
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,050
It's like it's so, it's edit. Nami.

1588
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,430
Just get to a Goddamn power
lifting gym son quickly.

1589
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:15,910
I think that's what missing from their
life is crossfit. Creotine squats,

1590
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,560
dead lifts,
someone's squash.

1591
01:24:17,561 --> 01:24:20,560
Someone needs to fucking tackle you
at some point in your life, okay?

1592
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,990
If you don't know how easy it
is to get knocked off your feet,

1593
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:25,930
you need to know that shit, bitch.
You need to work on your base. Okay?

1594
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:30,240
I need to work on your sprawl.
Get your shit together. All
right? That was fucking,

1595
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:34,660

were broken. Bitches. Stop it dude.

1596
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,460
God Damn, stop it. I've got no ground
techniques is what you need to play.

1597
01:24:37,461 --> 01:24:40,060
The frisbee kettle bells. I got
them. I'm going to make a video.

1598
01:24:40,061 --> 01:24:42,220
I'm gonna show you guys how
not to be little queens.

1599
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:45,520
I'm serious apology video on behalf
of those notes. That's a good idea.

1600
01:24:45,521 --> 01:24:47,470
We're going to do that. We're going to
do that after we're done here today,

1601
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:51,520
Reverend Carr and Jen's.
Yeah, we'll do that. That'll
be our next video blog. Yeah.

1602
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,020
We've got to get a shout out by
the way, to Cory loss. Chuck,

1603
01:24:54,021 --> 01:24:58,690
who did these two videos of Bobby Lee
from what? One of the past episodes I,

1604
01:24:58,691 --> 01:25:00,760
it's on Joe Rogan's website.
Joe rogan.net.

1605
01:25:00,761 --> 01:25:04,990
He fucking took like this audio of Bobby
telling these two stories and it's,

1606
01:25:04,991 --> 01:25:08,350
by the way,
it's podcasts 76 and fucking hilarious.

1607
01:25:08,351 --> 01:25:11,860
He did a really good job on
two brilliant stuff in the,

1608
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:15,490
I forgot how funny those stories were
and one of them is Bobby getting in

1609
01:25:15,491 --> 01:25:18,790
trouble. The very first day this girl
showed up at work, you farted in her face.

1610
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:22,870
She's sitting there reading or Sco eating
a yogurt and he walks up and sticks

1611
01:25:22,871 --> 01:25:26,830
his ass on her nose and farts
right on her face and she's crying.

1612
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,200
And One guy attacks him
and she wants to go.

1613
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:33,280
She was going to sue him and he had to
buy her a gift certificate for Burke

1614
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,690
Williams to get massages and shit.

1615
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:38,740
I love by the sinus obviously is awesome
and it's a story is just brilliant.

1616
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:43,720
It's so God damn funny and this guy
put it to animation. It's so good, man.

1617
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:47,710
He did an awesome job. So Cory, thank
you very much man. Check this out.

1618
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:49,390
Thank you very much dude.
Those are awesome.

1619
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:52,510
And anybody else who wants to do one of
those two? We fucking get on that shit.

1620
01:25:52,511 --> 01:25:55,820
I know there's a lot of really talented
people out there and that's what Carina,

1621
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,680
I met Brian off the Internet. Yeah,
Brian and I met him. Yeah, craigslist.

1622
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:03,850
I'm trying to stick with it.
My religion we get in the family.

1623
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:07,330
I can't believe j date even exists like,

1624
01:26:07,331 --> 01:26:10,730
like what Jewish girl guide is going to
pay for that. Oh No, they will man. They,

1625
01:26:10,731 --> 01:26:14,360
they only want Jews. I have friends
that are Jews at only want juice.

1626
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,820
Anything other than a
Jew. They, they learned,

1627
01:26:16,821 --> 01:26:19,070
I mean whatever the programming
that they got when they were young,

1628
01:26:19,071 --> 01:26:21,380
let's shit worked and they only want Jews.

1629
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,910
There's also like a gay gangster dating
website that's hot, provide alcohol. I've,

1630
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,560
you'd have to Google it.
He needed to go,

1631
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:29,600
I'm going to pretend like I don't
have that one off the top of my head,

1632
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:32,630
but there is a site just for
that, which is great. Yeah.

1633
01:26:32,631 --> 01:26:35,740
He used to work at gateway computers and
the day that Joe like called me up as

1634
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:35,961
like,
hey,

1635
01:26:35,961 --> 01:26:38,870
you want to move to California and did
videos for a living and all this shit.

1636
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:41,870
I was like, okay. And so I go
to my boss and I'm like, hey,

1637
01:26:41,871 --> 01:26:44,540
giving them a two week notice. He goes,
actually I need to talk to gateways,

1638
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:46,970
closing all their stores.
And I'm like, oh. He's like,

1639
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:50,720
you're going to have a two months
severance pay. I'm like, so yeah.

1640
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:57,050
He was putting up these funny videos on
my message board and this is fuck man.

1641
01:26:57,051 --> 01:27:01,190
It was like, was it 2003 youtube? I was
just really good at canal compression.

1642
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:04,460
That's all it took back in the day,
man. I made shit videos on the Internet,

1643
01:27:04,461 --> 01:27:05,001
but I knew how to,

1644
01:27:05,001 --> 01:27:07,700
I had access to servers from my
Internet provider that I started,

1645
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:10,160
so we just dreamed all sorts
of Shit on real player.

1646
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:13,520
Brian comes off very strange on the,

1647
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:15,780
on the podcast sometimes and
some people complain about him,

1648
01:27:15,781 --> 01:27:20,480
but that's the reason for that is
he's just very weirdly creative.

1649
01:27:20,481 --> 01:27:24,740
He's a very odd guy and these
videos were fucking hilarious.

1650
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,650
We have to put them somewhere.
Some of them up somewhere,

1651
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:31,370
like all the one that you did, were
you, there was a, there was a guy who,

1652
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:34,130
this was after he already moved here who
was giving him a hard time because this

1653
01:27:34,131 --> 01:27:36,290
guy was kind of jealous that
he got this job working for me.

1654
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:40,230
So Brian made this video goofing on
him that uh, yeah, it was like, yeah,

1655
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:40,990
he had a bay.

1656
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:43,910
He just recently had a baby who was
married to this girl that looked like from

1657
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:46,220
the girl from Harry art
looked like Harry Potter.

1658
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,190
And so I just made this pretty much
this like what? Two minute video?

1659
01:27:49,191 --> 01:27:53,030
A minute and a half video that that just
was like, oh, you want to fight here?

1660
01:27:53,031 --> 01:27:53,421
Here's a,

1661
01:27:53,421 --> 01:27:56,690
I was good at flash animation at the
time because when flash first came out,

1662
01:27:56,691 --> 01:28:01,500
when it was like shock wave instead
of a shockwave is what it was called a

1663
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:06,440
Macromedia shocker radio. Yeah. Yeah.
They, they loved my videos. I did.

1664
01:28:06,441 --> 01:28:11,441
So the some person from Adobe used to
send me flash flash 1.0 2.0 like this

1665
01:28:11,781 --> 01:28:15,470
really expensive software. No one had
access to this cause it was too expensive.

1666
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,270
So I used to learn that
shit back in the day.

1667
01:28:17,271 --> 01:28:20,630
So I don't make all these flash
videos now. I can't even touch flash.

1668
01:28:20,631 --> 01:28:23,160
It's so fucking impossible.
Since Adobe vote,

1669
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:28,970
I just want to gay demon.com is that the,

1670
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:30,590
Whoa,
this is,

1671
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:38,160
I'm looking for, you're gay. You're
telling me about your gay dating site.

1672
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:39,870
So I go to gay demon.

1673
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,720
It's so ridiculous.

1674
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:50,780
It's so preposterous and ridiculous.
Have you seen Choa sneaky.

1675
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:53,080
Let's say scribe to these people.
What we're looking at. Okay,

1676
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:55,070
this is cause this is,

1677
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:58,430
most people are going to hear this on
audio and they're going to be on there in

1678
01:28:58,431 --> 01:29:02,080
their car on their way to the gym or
you know, on the fucking treadmill.

1679
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:06,360
I tell her, imagine that picture gay
demon.com does the angel and the devil,

1680
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:08,610
the classic Angel and the Devil,
like from animal house,

1681
01:29:08,611 --> 01:29:13,611
one on each shoulder while the angel is
on one side and he's this buff gay guy

1682
01:29:14,161 --> 01:29:18,350
and he's got a guy sucking his dick and
then below him there's a guy stuck in

1683
01:29:18,351 --> 01:29:22,890
that guy's Dick and eating that guy's ass.
And they're the same guys doing both.

1684
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,300
No, no, no other guys. And they're like,

1685
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:28,170
this is a stack of guys like one of
those cheerleader pyramids and it's all

1686
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:32,760
dudes, human centipede sucking guys and
fucking guys in the ass on both sides.

1687
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:36,720
So the devil's getting his dick sucked
and the angels getting his Dick Sucked

1688
01:29:36,721 --> 01:29:38,250
and they're like looking at
each other like, Hey, what's up?

1689
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:41,640
We're going to arctic SAR by. Look,
it was healthy. It wasn't so bad.

1690
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:46,480
It sooner. The fire having a
[inaudible] seems to be no difference.

1691
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:49,970
They both dragons, Google dragons,
fucking cars. That's a great Wednesday.

1692
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:53,560
I'll fucking cards all like
anime of giant dragons.

1693
01:29:53,561 --> 01:29:56,530
Fucking cars in the tail height.
That's awesome. Gas tanks.

1694
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:59,050
I hung out with the Asian
from a human centipede.

1695
01:29:59,051 --> 01:30:03,160
He had a party and I was invited to this.
It was the craziest thing ever.

1696
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:03,881
You go to his house,

1697
01:30:03,881 --> 01:30:07,630
he had to like all these like statues of
the human centipede all over his house.

1698
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,850
It was creepy.
I wanted it to film the whole thing.

1699
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:12,500
But when you went to the guy
who created the no, no, no,

1700
01:30:12,530 --> 01:30:16,270
the Japanese or the Asian guy that
had sent a pita from Insinda peed.

1701
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:19,350
So he has us all over his house.
So he's proud. He had a partner,

1702
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,950
he had a party at his house.

1703
01:30:20,951 --> 01:30:24,070
He just happened to have all these cool
statues all out through his house of the

1704
01:30:24,071 --> 01:30:28,270
human centipede. Know there were
promotion promotional or whatever.

1705
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,140
Plaster molds of himself
and a couple buddies. Yeah.

1706
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:34,380
But interesting enough and I was trying
to dig and I think he's in the sequel

1707
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:35,590
somehow.
So

1708
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,190
I want to hear something funny.

1709
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:41,720
There's something someone wrote on our
are on Twitter about this conversation.

1710
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,490
He wrote consumerism with all these
exclamation points. It's ugly.

1711
01:30:46,491 --> 01:30:51,080
Talk about deeper shit. You horse.
Oh, that's what you know. Listen,

1712
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,330
you dumb. Fuck. Okay.

1713
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:57,230
When we're talking about fantastic
technology and the creation,

1714
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:00,860
like human innovation,
the creation of a an m three or a,

1715
01:31:00,861 --> 01:31:02,480
an apple laptop or anything,

1716
01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:06,530
we're talking about spectacular new
things that are in our world right now.

1717
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:11,060
It's not just about consumerism and
getting wrapped up in this whole, hey,

1718
01:31:11,061 --> 01:31:13,610
I'm not into money,
man.

1719
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:18,060
I'm not in the consumer is a man.
Like, just shut the fuck up. Okay,

1720
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,530
how did he send that tweet?
How does your phone,

1721
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,920
what does your computer's
stupid live in a house,

1722
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:29,420
dump content by a fucking smoke
signals for, he's a piece of shit.

1723
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:33,560
I just want to address this whole retarded
mentality to criticize other people's

1724
01:31:33,561 --> 01:31:34,394
interests,

1725
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:38,060
especially other people's interests when
it comes to things that you can attain.

1726
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:42,350
So all of a sudden these things that
you can attain become evil things or bad

1727
01:31:42,351 --> 01:31:45,530
things or negative things.
We all have fucking transportation,

1728
01:31:45,531 --> 01:31:48,590
whether it's helped bus or whether
you drive your own fucking car.

1729
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:50,630
We all have transportation. Okay. No one,

1730
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:54,710
unless you are living in a solar powered
house and you write a fucking horse

1731
01:31:54,711 --> 01:31:57,030
everywhere. Okay. Everyone's
contributing. Noni,

1732
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,650
that's listening to this
broadcast right now. Exactly.

1733
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:00,990
Doesn't have access to something.

1734
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,150
You've got its carbon footprint a
mother fucker. All right, and this,

1735
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:08,740
this idea that somehow or another like
looking into this technology and objects

1736
01:32:08,741 --> 01:32:09,340
and things,

1737
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:13,810
it's not being obsessed with create or
acquiring diamonds and walking around and

1738
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,230
covered in jewels. That's not
what we're doing. What we're,

1739
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:19,480
what we're doing is looking at the
incredible shit that human beings are

1740
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:23,410
creating and how nuts this
is and how different this
is and just a few years ago,

1741
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:27,430
that's it. All right. You stupid
fucks. Just [inaudible]. It makes me,

1742
01:32:27,431 --> 01:32:28,810
it's not trolled man.
It's a,

1743
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:33,370
it's a mentality that comes up over and
over and over again and it's mostly a

1744
01:32:33,371 --> 01:32:35,140
justification of failure.

1745
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:39,340
It's a justification of either the
lack of ambition or their lack of

1746
01:32:39,341 --> 01:32:44,110
participating in some sort
of, uh, you know, um, uh,
materialism, quest, you know,

1747
01:32:44,111 --> 01:32:47,080
they know they're not in the game at all.
So they criticized the game. You know,

1748
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:50,050
I left. Fuck. It's like when I
see there's a guy in the Hamptons,

1749
01:32:50,051 --> 01:32:53,620
it's got some hundred and $80 million
house. It's the most expensive house ever,

1750
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,950
and it's gigantic. You know,
when I say I don't say full dog,

1751
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,460
good fucking capitalist, I go, wow, that's
incredible. Like that guy went for it,

1752
01:33:00,461 --> 01:33:02,470
you know? That's what I think. I
mean, it's not, here's the thing,

1753
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,080
maybe that guy doesn't subscribe
to the game. Maybe he is capable,

1754
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:10,060
but he's on Twitter or criticizing
you. So now and again, and let's see,

1755
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:12,640
you said the carrier pigeon to
deliver that fucking message.

1756
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,170
He's playing the game somehow.
Exactly.

1757
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:16,990
Just not be for you to use in a fucking
computer. You know, look, we're,

1758
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:20,800
we're all a part of this weird thing
called capitalism or this weird thing,

1759
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:24,190
which capitalism is just
sort of an operating system
that runs society. I mean,

1760
01:33:24,191 --> 01:33:25,930
that's really what it is.
Yeah.

1761
01:33:25,931 --> 01:33:29,350
And I make like apple better and
you might like windows better.

1762
01:33:29,351 --> 01:33:32,470
They're all operating systems in
the same damn icon. I don't know.

1763
01:33:32,471 --> 01:33:33,970
I don't believe that,
you know,

1764
01:33:33,971 --> 01:33:36,250
capitalism is perfect by any
stretch of the imagination.

1765
01:33:36,251 --> 01:33:37,840
Nor do I believe is communism works.

1766
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:41,080
I think socialism is a ridiculous idea
because it goes completely against human

1767
01:33:41,081 --> 01:33:43,300
nature. And when you start, you know,

1768
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:46,990
criticizing people for things that
they've acquired, you're dumb. All right.

1769
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:51,310
There's things out there that are amazing.
A big screen television is amazing.

1770
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:54,710
Brian's got three d TV in his
bedroom. That shit's amazing. Oh,

1771
01:33:54,711 --> 01:33:55,570
that was a miss purchase.

1772
01:33:55,950 --> 01:34:00,930
No, no, no, no, no. Here's
what my, roll my sleeves up.

1773
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,800
Step back. Here's my conversation. I
went to best buy to get a TV. Yeah.

1774
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:07,990
I found the TV I wanted. Yeah.
It also had three D hot. No, no.

1775
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:12,760
Just a normal TV and I was going to get
it. Then I, uh, checked on my Amazon.

1776
01:34:12,761 --> 01:34:14,050
I'm like,
how much does this TV?

1777
01:34:14,051 --> 01:34:16,480
And they didn't like the TV on
there was like pretty much the same.

1778
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,870
But then they were like, they had the
three d version for $100 more. I'm like,

1779
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,270
fuck that. I'm going to get the three
d version for a hundred dollars mark.

1780
01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:25,030
So I ordered it on Amazon, got
the TV right. Then you won't ever.

1781
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:28,510
Then you get to spend an extra hundred
and $50 per pair of goggles and then you

1782
01:34:28,511 --> 01:34:31,300
get to spend an extra hundred bucks a
month or whatever for the specialist that

1783
01:34:31,301 --> 01:34:32,850
can deliver that. Amazon had this, uh,

1784
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:35,200
how to deal if you bought it was for
Christmas or something like that.

1785
01:34:35,201 --> 01:34:35,951
If you bought their TV,

1786
01:34:35,951 --> 01:34:38,590
you get free 3-d everything and
you've got the three d glasses,

1787
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:39,371
you got two pairs,

1788
01:34:39,371 --> 01:34:42,800
you've got some and you lose your three
d friends cause no one fucking cares.

1789
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,300
Oh I'm sorry Bob.
I didn't charge.

1790
01:34:46,301 --> 01:34:50,350
Or Oakley's a migraine you have to charge.

1791
01:34:51,450 --> 01:34:54,580
Well I would not recommend a
three d TVs what I'm saying,

1792
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:59,090
but if it's $100 more or something small,
then yes. Because here's the cool thing.

1793
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:02,210
It's not, people don't know. It makes
everything three d if you want it to,

1794
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,970
but it doesn't do it well. It doesn't
do it well on everything I watch.

1795
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:07,610
I got to tell you dude, we were
at the, I've never seen one.

1796
01:35:07,611 --> 01:35:11,870
I haven't seen his but I have seen one
in person at the mall or a best buy we

1797
01:35:11,871 --> 01:35:13,940
went to see and they had
monsters and aliens playing.

1798
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:17,300
I think it might be worth
it just to watch that movie.

1799
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:20,540
[inaudible] it's the only movie. Like
when HD first came out people were like,

1800
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:21,350
dude you got to get HD.

1801
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:26,180
Why you could watch flamingos fuck and
the sunrise and high def and that's all

1802
01:35:26,181 --> 01:35:27,410
there was for it.
Which I get,

1803
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:30,590
you know your eyes widen cause you like
watching flamingos fuck but after three

1804
01:35:30,591 --> 01:35:31,850
months that's all there was.

1805
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:34,970
You play call of duty and three d I
have played three games. Yeah it's cool.

1806
01:35:34,971 --> 01:35:37,490
The onscreen display is a little
further out in front of your face.

1807
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,690
You still colored glasses. You still
got a fucking headache. Still a sham.

1808
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:45,320
I play call of duty for some
people it does for me at first,

1809
01:35:45,321 --> 01:35:49,710
the first 10 minutes you have and you
rewire your brain to go cross eyed when

1810
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,740
I'm getting a headache and
now you're totally good.

1811
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:56,390
I think it's more crazy as this new
Nintendo three ds where I'm watching kids

1812
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:59,870
holding up their three ds right to
their face with this three d shit.

1813
01:35:59,871 --> 01:36:03,260
And they've already admitted it in Japan
that or doctor drew admitted that that

1814
01:36:03,261 --> 01:36:07,040
could cause your eyes to bleed and like
people are already getting fucked up

1815
01:36:07,041 --> 01:36:09,500
from it. And you know how kids
are with their fucking game boys,

1816
01:36:09,501 --> 01:36:11,420
they're going to put it in
there for hours on end smash.

1817
01:36:11,421 --> 01:36:13,820
Who knows what this is going to
do that they're fucking eyes, man.

1818
01:36:13,821 --> 01:36:18,380
You're going to get Bluetooth or some
fucking shit at the airport dude. But no,

1819
01:36:18,381 --> 01:36:21,870
no, I don't recommend three d tee
ball blended reality though. That's,

1820
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:25,010
that's the shit you'll be able
to in the very near future.

1821
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,620
You know Google goggles. Have you heard
of Google goggles? Yeah. No. Amazing.

1822
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:30,770
So you point it Google goggles
at a restaurant or a landmark.

1823
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,740
And it analyzes what you're looking at
and it spits you out a search result

1824
01:36:33,741 --> 01:36:34,251
based off that.

1825
01:36:34,251 --> 01:36:36,160
So you pointed at the Golden Gate
Bridge boom in the history of that.

1826
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:37,820
So extrapolate from that.

1827
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:41,480
It's crazy right now for augmented
reality in the translation.

1828
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:45,590
This can take a photo of a building and
tells you what the building is. Oh yeah.

1829
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:48,350
You could create a message board
off of just that photo. It could,

1830
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,840
it could translate texts in real time.
You can have a check in,

1831
01:36:50,841 --> 01:36:54,470
you could have a menu pop out of a coaster
that's going to make contact lens at

1832
01:36:54,471 --> 01:36:59,310
one point. Well that's,
yeah, but so, so that,

1833
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:00,230
that is step one.

1834
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:03,560
So step two is they have these augmented
reality markers that you can throw down

1835
01:37:03,561 --> 01:37:06,080
and look at with a Webcam or
with a cell phone application.

1836
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,430
And it'll make like on the three Ds,

1837
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:10,460
it makes like a dragon appear and you
can walk around and look at it in three d

1838
01:37:10,461 --> 01:37:12,110
and Sharon Rose at it.
That's cool.

1839
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:15,200
Now the next phase of that is doing
that without markers. So imagine this,

1840
01:37:15,201 --> 01:37:17,570
and I know some people that are working
on this right now and I'm trying to get

1841
01:37:17,571 --> 01:37:19,730
in the space.
You launch the APP on your cell phone.

1842
01:37:19,731 --> 01:37:22,400
You look around and analyzes
in real time in the cloud.

1843
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:23,900
It looks at this table and goes,
all right,

1844
01:37:23,901 --> 01:37:27,320
there's a coconut water nutritional info.
Do you want to purchase by now?

1845
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:30,440
There's a wine bottle. Oh, I know what
vintage that is from the fucking thing.

1846
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:33,050
You can look at the microphone and tap
it. There's information on it. Wow.

1847
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:37,310
Everything that the, the barrier between
Internet and real life is visual,

1848
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:39,290
legally dissipated.
That's the next step.

1849
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:41,150
But it's all going to have
real time tracking too.

1850
01:37:41,151 --> 01:37:44,270
So imagine hiking up to a
point at a mountain looking
over a city and tapping it

1851
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:45,470
and having information on that city.

1852
01:37:45,471 --> 01:37:48,320
Come out having a communal game pop
out of it. All that shit's happening.

1853
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:52,100
It's incredible. That's
going to be awesome. And it's
happening now, so fuck you.

1854
01:37:52,101 --> 01:37:55,980
Anti consumerism. Twitter,
Dick. Yeah. Fuck that guy to
apologize. Women on Youtube

1855
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:00,580
urban either we're gonna talk
about mushrooms. I'm sorry. Yeah.

1856
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:03,990
I thought that was just a mushroom
trip tonight. Well, we could, we could.

1857
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:07,780
I got a date tonight. You got going on
with the misses. Where are you guys going?

1858
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,580
Red lobster, Cheddar bay
biscuits. It's only Friday night.

1859
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:14,370
I'm going to go red lobster.
Where does,

1860
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:17,100
where do you go on a Friday night
with a message? Go out to eat.

1861
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:20,850
Check out a movie. I heard
that then movie. I'm source
code's good Bernard source.

1862
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:24,470
Go get your highness is great
screening.

1863
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:29,560
What the fuck? Really? No kidding.
I was like, well I mean I like,

1864
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:33,540
I do like Russell brand.
Why he entertains me.

1865
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:36,780
You have to be in the mood for his
quote unquote brand of entertainment,

1866
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:41,310
but same character. I liked
it so I watched him do
stand up. Oh wash, no sound,

1867
01:38:41,311 --> 01:38:42,390
but I was like,
whoa.

1868
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:45,380
I like him whenever he's a guest on talk
shows like I'd love to interview him.

1869
01:38:45,381 --> 01:38:47,500
He seems, he seems pretty
interesting. He's a fascinating guy.

1870
01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:49,560
Who was your favorite person to interview?
Like,

1871
01:38:49,561 --> 01:38:52,440
who's the one person that you
think about all the time that like,

1872
01:38:52,441 --> 01:38:56,430
I can't believe in a shower in the
shower. Do, do. Uh, I like James Cameron,

1873
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,400
James Cameron. I had a
last chance, James Cameron,

1874
01:38:59,401 --> 01:39:01,440
you know a lot of people accuse
him of being an arrogant,

1875
01:39:01,441 --> 01:39:03,510
but you know what I think did
in order to get that much done,

1876
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:06,510
as much as he said we gotta be ahead
of being obsessed worker. What he did,

1877
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:07,980
I mean,
look at what he's done,

1878
01:39:07,981 --> 01:39:11,760
but he was doing now it was advertised
was filling in all under water. Right.

1879
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:12,960
He's doing the whole fucking,

1880
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:17,130
and you didn't know that Avatar to
filming underwater with technology that he

1881
01:39:17,131 --> 01:39:21,110
created in order to fucking yeah, two or
titanic to film underwater and 20 bucks.

1882
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:24,120
I got to hold the three d camera that
they used on Avatar and I held it for

1883
01:39:24,121 --> 01:39:27,270
about three minutes and wanted to
give out like my shoulder. It's like,

1884
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:29,220
it's crazy heavy and I'm like,
you held this thing James,

1885
01:39:29,221 --> 01:39:31,830
like you're rich and powerful enough to
hire 40 people to hold the camera for

1886
01:39:31,831 --> 01:39:33,540
you is like, nope. Held
it on every single shot,

1887
01:39:33,570 --> 01:39:36,420
rammed down ramps and did all that
shit like he's, he's Gung Ho series,

1888
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:39,960
but mother for all the shit that they
give James Cameron for being arrogant or

1889
01:39:39,961 --> 01:39:43,560
tough to work with or whatever. He came
on the show, had a smile, shook my hand,

1890
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:46,260
was super nerdy about everything and we
even had them coming out with a folding

1891
01:39:46,261 --> 01:39:48,410
chair and smashing through a
brick wall and hitting it's,

1892
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:52,140
he was super game to have a good time
and he cut his head on one of the foam

1893
01:39:52,141 --> 01:39:54,960
rocks that fell the second time you
came on the show with this big wall.

1894
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,040
He burst through it like Koolaid, you
know like, Oh yeah, it picks up a chair.

1895
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:00,030
He's going to hit a dummy with it
and I see like this little spot,

1896
01:40:00,031 --> 01:40:03,240
a crimson on his forehead and our shows
live. We've got a ten second delay.

1897
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:06,090
So I'm sitting there interviewing
him and I'm just seeing,

1898
01:40:06,091 --> 01:40:07,200
thank God it's away from the camera,

1899
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:10,590
but I'm watching blood slowly trickle
out of his 40 Jesus call I'm thinking

1900
01:40:10,591 --> 01:40:13,740
about is the publicist and the
studio and everybody else going like,

1901
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:16,380
did you cut James Cameron?
I would have brought it up right away.

1902
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:22,230
That would be glued. I hate to say
this, but I think we cut your head.

1903
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:26,700
We cut you the fuck he's not
in pain. I'm so well look,

1904
01:40:26,701 --> 01:40:29,520
I'm so used trauma and
would get away with it.

1905
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:31,930
What kind of a con,

1906
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:35,610
if you were the type of guy that kills
people because a foam rock fell on your

1907
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:38,880
head. Oh yeah, you would. You'd have
a fucking trail of bodies behind you.

1908
01:40:38,881 --> 01:40:43,740
Like Gingiss con that ass, you're
really, you're really, you're crazy.

1909
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:46,800
It's not gonna. It's not gonna kill
you. You totally insecure about this.

1910
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:50,640
You don't have to be more relaxed
about James Cameron told an awesome

1911
01:40:50,641 --> 01:40:52,530
opportunity there all that you caught him.

1912
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:55,870
I still get him a great interview and I
had photoshops and me fucking the Navi.

1913
01:40:55,871 --> 01:40:58,480
So I was on, I really like, he was like,

1914
01:40:58,481 --> 01:41:01,090
the aliens have to seem
fuckable already said,

1915
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:04,240
oh that was his big thing for Pandora.
He's like, I want you to picture aliens.

1916
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:06,130
Someone you want to fuck.
And he talked about it and it's like,

1917
01:41:06,131 --> 01:41:09,310
I didn't want to fuck that girl. When
he got down with her, I was like, okay,

1918
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:11,690
I could see it. I could see,
I could see her being attract.

1919
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:14,620
Especially if like you're big and
blue to you're like, yeah, fuck it.

1920
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:17,260
I'm going to make three
animals with their braid.

1921
01:41:17,261 --> 01:41:19,630
Why didn't you jack is Braden
to wear something like that.

1922
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:24,430
You should work fine with your
hatch. Madison slash. Fiction.

1923
01:41:24,431 --> 01:41:28,060
That'll hit the net very soon.
Yeah, that James Cameron,

1924
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:31,480
that guy's doing some crazy shit right
now and that was some amazing stuff.

1925
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:31,801
Bummed.

1926
01:41:31,801 --> 01:41:34,630
I never got to interview Mitch Hedberg
Super bummed about that and the super

1927
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:38,580
bummed it never got to interview Leslie
Nielsen Cause He's shaped, shaped my,

1928
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:42,660
I just watched creep show the other day
and I forgot Leslie Nielsen was in an

1929
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:46,450
Ted Danson, which was crazy.
But that, that Ted lesson,

1930
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,190
Nielsen growing up was one of my faves.

1931
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:53,250
I saw a naked gunky recently and it
was so weird seeing Oj Simpson a cause.

1932
01:41:53,651 --> 01:41:57,790
Your, forget how I, as a kid growing
up, I loved Oj Simpson. But it did,

1933
01:41:58,390 --> 01:41:59,650
especially from that role.

1934
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:04,690
That was one of the weirdest moments in
human history when this, this loved man,

1935
01:42:04,691 --> 01:42:07,180
this guy who's like,
he played the game so well.

1936
01:42:07,181 --> 01:42:09,400
It was so charming and only
even dated white women.

1937
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:11,440
So people didn't even
think of them as black.

1938
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:15,120
It's like here's this trauma handsome
black man who spoke so well. Right.

1939
01:42:15,121 --> 01:42:19,670
And then all of a sudden he's gotten
people's fucking heads was allegedly some,

1940
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:22,540
I'm going read the Chris. I was in like
sixth grade or seventh grade I think,

1941
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:25,390
and I had the Chris Darden book on
that trailer. I was fascinated by it.

1942
01:42:25,391 --> 01:42:27,580
I was like, this is some crazy
shit that's gone. I got up early.

1943
01:42:27,581 --> 01:42:30,640
Me and my girlfriend, we were a,
I was living in North Hollywood,

1944
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:32,200
my girlfriend bridge at the time.

1945
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:36,340
We got up early and we sat in front of
the fucking TV and watched the verdict

1946
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:40,300
and we both went, oh, were both like,

1947
01:42:40,301 --> 01:42:43,600
what is going on?
Like how is this real?

1948
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:47,950
How am I watching this guy get off and
he's clap and art from, it was a racist.

1949
01:42:47,950 --> 01:42:51,640
That's why. Well in the glove didn't
fit. It was a little bit of both.

1950
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:55,920
And it was also the weird thing where
black people wanted someone to win on.

1951
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:57,610
There's wanting him to get it.
Yeah. They wanted him to win.

1952
01:42:57,611 --> 01:42:58,620
And I was the Rodney King

1953
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:03,490
Rodney king thing fucked everybody out
when he wants to go and get beat fucking

1954
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:08,491
half census with sticks without all these
youtube and cell phone videos of like,

1955
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:11,770
my brother's a cop. By the way, you
should beat that guy. Have Sense?

1956
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:15,700
They should just fucking shot him. Like
that guy was crazy. Messed up, asshole.

1957
01:43:15,701 --> 01:43:18,850
He was, he was high on PCP beating the
fuck out of cop. He was fighting them.

1958
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:21,730
They had to hit them with sticks. Yeah,
they definitely got out of line. Yeah,

1959
01:43:21,731 --> 01:43:23,180
they definitely get a little crazy,
but,

1960
01:43:23,290 --> 01:43:26,390
but the notion that now you
can't fucking love cops truly do.

1961
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:26,981
And my brother's one,

1962
01:43:26,981 --> 01:43:29,290
and he's one of the good ones and I
respect the shit out of what he does

1963
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:31,630
everyday. I have sir, I read
teleprompter, I read words,

1964
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:35,390
he puts a fucking shit in
a line and a lot of cops.

1965
01:43:35,391 --> 01:43:36,820
So with that stuff for cops,

1966
01:43:36,821 --> 01:43:39,750
that notion of not being able to film
them when they're performing their duties,

1967
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:40,960
it's ridiculous.

1968
01:43:40,961 --> 01:43:43,210
And the fact that people are getting
their cell phones taken away and getting

1969
01:43:43,211 --> 01:43:45,070
arrested,
they're not even part of what's going on.

1970
01:43:45,071 --> 01:43:48,250
Getting arrested for invasion of privacy.
That's fucked. Yeah. There's law.

1971
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:52,010
There's actually laws against videotaping
cops while they're doing their job,

1972
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,100
but just ridiculous. Did you see that
guy in Seattle that punched that chick?

1973
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:55,963
You ever see that?

1974
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:59,780
There's a bunch of black women and he's
a little white guy and he's arresting

1975
01:43:59,781 --> 01:44:00,380
one and this,

1976
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:05,180
this other black woman comes along and
she's like pulling the girl away and she

1977
01:44:05,181 --> 01:44:05,960
pulls him away.

1978
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:09,920
She grabbed a hold of him and he turns
on blasts or right in the face and then

1979
01:44:09,921 --> 01:44:14,900
you know, all the people were filming
like, Oh shit, no he did and no, Hey Dan,

1980
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:17,740
like wow, like this is like
this. What is this is chaos.

1981
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,870
The story that the eight year old boy
that got pepper sprayed pepper spray it at

1982
01:44:20,871 --> 01:44:23,860
school and you're like, that's fucking
excessive force. Excessive force.

1983
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:28,010
Tom's braid cop pepper sprayed him and
the mom is suing the cops in the school

1984
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:31,370
district and everybody over
night, the headline of that,
you go, that's fucked up.

1985
01:44:31,371 --> 01:44:35,000
Who? Pepper sprays and boy it turns out
he like held up a pencil in the class,

1986
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:36,170
threatened everybody said,
quote,

1987
01:44:36,171 --> 01:44:38,960
I'm going to kill all of you
mother fuckers that cops came up,

1988
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:40,550
they were threatening to cops
and doing everything. I'm like,

1989
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:42,080
you're fucking kid was out of hand.

1990
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:45,080
If I said I'm gonna kill
all you motherfuckers at
a school and threatened to

1991
01:44:45,081 --> 01:44:48,240
stab people, I deserve a
little pepper sprays up. Yeah.

1992
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:51,530
I mean it was eight years old though. He
was like eight or nine years old. Yeah.

1993
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:54,150
You're like, Shit, the fuck I'm
coming to give me that pencil.

1994
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:57,750
That's a trouble kid. You should arrest
his parents. That's what I'm saying. Yeah.

1995
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:01,010
You got a kid that's that angry and then
the ones that kill everybody in class,

1996
01:45:01,011 --> 01:45:04,250
you need to find out what the fuck they
did to him. Yeah, absolutely. Sure.

1997
01:45:04,251 --> 01:45:06,890
That mom was a star on 16 and pregnant.
Oh,

1998
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:10,160
that's just lately on TMZ.

1999
01:45:10,161 --> 01:45:13,720
It seems like every day there's a new
fight or a new person, but it seems like,

2000
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:16,970
just like we were talking about with porn,
the porn is getting accelerating,

2001
01:45:16,971 --> 01:45:18,200
getting more and more fucked up.

2002
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:20,330
Reality television is getting
more and more fucked up too,

2003
01:45:20,331 --> 01:45:23,270
to the point where how many people were
getting pregnant trying to be on that

2004
01:45:23,271 --> 01:45:26,300
show to be on the show. It
glorifies it. It says, well, I'm 16.

2005
01:45:26,301 --> 01:45:28,340
I live in the middle of nowhere
and I have nothing going for me.

2006
01:45:28,341 --> 01:45:31,000
I know what I'm doing and have a child
that will love me and an MTV is going to

2007
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:34,010
give me a salary to put every
moment of this on the air.

2008
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,400
It's so scary and sketch my moments and
put my life to a soundtrack that they

2009
01:45:37,401 --> 01:45:39,650
can sell on iTunes and I watch it.

2010
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:42,410
We live in is try watching shit
on event show Macy's. Amazing.

2011
01:45:42,411 --> 01:45:44,810
Do you really watch Blake Bentley's great
man? My girlfriend makes me watch it.

2012
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:48,880
Really? I totally do. Wow. Without,
without arguing. I watched, uh,

2013
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:51,830
for the first time dancing with the stars.
What the Fuck's wrong with you?

2014
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:54,710
You know, did you see Kirstie
Alley get dropped? No.

2015
01:45:54,711 --> 01:45:57,580
I heard about I should Google that and
I heard that the guy was trying to like

2016
01:45:57,590 --> 01:46:02,300
make excuses by my, my
knee gave out. It's normal.

2017
01:46:02,301 --> 01:46:03,940
It happens. Uh, Dan has
nothing to do with it.

2018
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:07,820
When you're dragging a 400 pound woman
across the fucking floor has nothing to

2019
01:46:07,821 --> 01:46:09,980
do with the fact that she's a monster,

2020
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:13,760
that she has eaten herself
in horrific proportions.

2021
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:15,800
She's a monster.
She,

2022
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,540
she took what was a hot shape
and for whatever. What is it?

2023
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:25,160
Is it self loathing? Is it
indulgence? Is it gluttony?

2024
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:27,280
She's just eating herself
into a road block.

2025
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:31,370
You have to fucking work at getting
that big man a Shitty, yeah.

2026
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:34,460
Especially a woman who's like
constantly talking about losing weight.

2027
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:37,370
I mean her whole thing is like
losing that actress thing too.

2028
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:39,770
So that was her whole shtick.
I loved,

2029
01:46:39,771 --> 01:46:43,220
there's a kid on youtube who was a
testing fruit gushers. Have you seen that?

2030
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:44,360
He has like a snack review.

2031
01:46:44,361 --> 01:46:48,140
He's like 12 and he's already way too
big for his age and he does like a,

2032
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:51,330
he reviews fin mitts gushers and eats
them and it looks into his Webcam and

2033
01:46:51,331 --> 01:46:54,300
tells you, yeah, that's a must buy
lunch. Again, I keep exploring.

2034
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:55,140
You got to look at,

2035
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:59,100
it's the fruit gushers must buy and is
this young kid on its Webcam and I'm like,

2036
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:03,960
what are the four man? That's hilarious.
Where are the fucking parents?

2037
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:07,200
Kirstie alley just never got over Diane,
I think. Is that what it is? Yeah.

2038
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:10,930
Yeah man. Shit happens dude. It's a,

2039
01:47:10,931 --> 01:47:15,000
it's a problem when you're on a reality
or a big hit sitcom or you ever have a

2040
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:17,460
weight issue being in front of camera,
like being on camera,

2041
01:47:17,461 --> 01:47:19,920
did it ever get to you and like you have
to look a certain way or feel a certain

2042
01:47:19,921 --> 01:47:23,910
way to be tall? I'm fatter now than
I've ever been in my life. For sure.

2043
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:26,520
I could see my face and
I could see it in my gut.

2044
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:29,910
I can wait be which I can
pinch a fat around me.

2045
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:32,370
It's really because I'm traveling
a lot and it hurt my back.

2046
01:47:32,910 --> 01:47:36,150
Popped what's called a rivet
head or rib head is a, um,

2047
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:39,240
it's what connects like it's
some shit in your back. Anyway,

2048
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,530
point is when I did it,

2049
01:47:40,531 --> 01:47:43,500
I couldn't do Jujitsu for like two months
and I didn't lift heavy for two months

2050
01:47:43,501 --> 01:47:46,080
either.
All I did was just hit the bag and a,

2051
01:47:46,081 --> 01:47:47,790
I didn't even do that
all that consistently.

2052
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:51,650
So I tried to let myself heal up and in
the process I ate just like I always do.

2053
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:53,710
Isn't that the bitch of it? Like you, you,

2054
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:57,360
you take your eyes off the prize
one second and it's gone. It's gone.

2055
01:47:57,361 --> 01:47:59,910
And muscle memory is bullshit. But
fortunately for me, no, it's not.

2056
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,133
Looks totally real.

2057
01:48:01,290 --> 01:48:04,050
Not when you're in that two
weeks recovering from an
injury or something else.

2058
01:48:04,051 --> 01:48:07,980
Like that's, there's nothing
worse. Injuries are brutal,
but it's part of the game.

2059
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,140
Held back is fucked up and I'm still
training through it like an asshole.

2060
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:13,050
Really need to go get it looked at. What's
wrong with your back? Great question.

2061
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:15,780
Yeah. When you say training,
like what are you doing? Uh,

2062
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:18,750
started recently getting into
weightlifting. Yeah. Yeah.
Just heavy weight lifting.

2063
01:48:18,751 --> 01:48:21,200
I've never been in shape my entire
life. Yeah. I didn't want it.

2064
01:48:21,201 --> 01:48:25,250
It was that kettle bells.
Now just traditional teach
you the ways of Kettlebells,

2065
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:28,110
son. But I uh, teach you the
ways of men. I did one of those,

2066
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:31,500
those 23 and me test where you spit into
a vial and they analyze your DNA and

2067
01:48:31,501 --> 01:48:33,350
tell you what your predispositions
are. Right. You know,

2068
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:38,450
and it was like Morbid obesity was
99.9% repeating and that was like a,

2069
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:42,510
Oh, it's a genetic issue. Well,
I mean I'm predisposed to it.

2070
01:48:42,511 --> 01:48:45,620
Obviously we disposed off morbid obesity,
but look at your lean.

2071
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,850
I'm kind of the only one in
my family that is though.

2072
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:50,040
And I kind of developed it
neuroses about it at one point.

2073
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:53,280
I've always worked out so much, I never
had to worry about my weight on TV.

2074
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,120
But you know that that idea that
putting it puts 10 pounds on you,

2075
01:48:57,121 --> 01:48:58,530
that's complete total horse shit.

2076
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,350
That's just fat girls who don't know
what they really look like and they see

2077
01:49:01,351 --> 01:49:02,740
themselves on camera.
Have you ever,

2078
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:06,970
have you ever downsized standard def
stream stretched out on an HDTV? Yeah,

2079
01:49:06,971 --> 01:49:10,100
we'll put down, I will fuck
you up. W up real fast.

2080
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:14,040
Like a heart video but in reverse,
remember those videos, heart,

2081
01:49:14,041 --> 01:49:16,020
remember this is the first time
they experiment. They were like,

2082
01:49:16,021 --> 01:49:19,110
how do we get this fat bitch
to look how we got a fucking,

2083
01:49:19,290 --> 01:49:22,260
we got to distort her frame and make it
look like we're looking at her through

2084
01:49:22,261 --> 01:49:24,330
like Alice in wonderland
seeing eyeglasses.

2085
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:28,410
I saw a demo of software now for actually
you don't need tracking markers or any

2086
01:49:28,411 --> 01:49:29,310
green screen bullshit,

2087
01:49:29,311 --> 01:49:32,040
but you film an actor doing their
performance like you normally would and it

2088
01:49:32,041 --> 01:49:35,670
kind of does an Xbox connect
style analysis of their
frame and builds a skeleton

2089
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:38,380
and it does pixel detection to
see where they're, you know,

2090
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:41,540
I called it renaissance fair arms
where the turtle like hangs it,

2091
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,550
sees what their rent,
rent,

2092
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:46,920
bear arms ends right where the scenery
begins and you can real time dynamically

2093
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:48,520
slide how fat, thin, tall,

2094
01:49:48,521 --> 01:49:53,140
or short a person is and it will render
the video after seem bulky or to make

2095
01:49:53,141 --> 01:49:56,530
them seem thinners. There's demos
of it on Youtube, right? 300 shit.

2096
01:49:56,531 --> 01:49:59,680
What they did with 300 I mean a lot of
people, they showed the 300 workout.

2097
01:49:59,681 --> 01:50:02,530
This is what they did to getting
such amazing shape. No, they didn't.

2098
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:05,530
Do you know what kind of a fucking diet
you'd have to be on and how long you

2099
01:50:05,531 --> 01:50:09,490
would have to be on it and how consistent
you would have to be in the best shape

2100
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:10,570
of your life.

2101
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:15,570
It would take years and years of hard
training to reach like how Gerald wasn't

2102
01:50:15,941 --> 01:50:18,280
named Gerald Butler, Butler, Gerard
Butler, which if you see him now,

2103
01:50:18,281 --> 01:50:21,400
he did like SNL recently and
stuff like that. Dopey and soft.

2104
01:50:21,401 --> 01:50:23,110
It's totally show my girlfriend that.
I was like,

2105
01:50:23,111 --> 01:50:25,930
that's what that ends up
like a spartan looks like.

2106
01:50:25,931 --> 01:50:27,640
He actually got in shape for that,

2107
01:50:27,641 --> 01:50:31,150
moving on to shore and they added all
that other CGI shit to him to make them

2108
01:50:31,151 --> 01:50:35,790
look better than it really did, but shit,
she, that guy, I'm not into him, man.

2109
01:50:35,791 --> 01:50:38,710
I would about Spartacus loved him in
that movie. I haven't seen it yet.

2110
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:42,040
I loved him in that movie and then
everything I've seen in him since then.

2111
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:44,470
I'm like, God man, why are
you annoying me? You know,

2112
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:47,080
how come I'm not always doing rom coms
now and Shit? Although he did do that.

2113
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:49,670
What does that, what's Romcom
romantic comedies? Oh my God. You'll

2114
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:58,010
knock out if you have not got a ruling.
But I've never even heard of that though.

2115
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:01,000
Right.
I'm fucking industry.

2116
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:05,230
That's why I know he's
never seen a Katherine Heigl
movie and rubbed her vagina

2117
01:51:05,231 --> 01:51:08,020
and a theater. Oh, miss an
owl. She's another one. Man.

2118
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:10,660
I liked her in the first movie I saw her.
And what was that?

2119
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:15,080
What was her big movie? The fucking
movie with Seth Rogen. Oh, she was,

2120
01:51:15,610 --> 01:51:19,330
oh, that was a, I liked her. Maybe I liked
her because she was fucking a fat guy.

2121
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:22,750
I was like, oh, that's really sweet.
She fucked that guy. And then,

2122
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:25,960
and then he never really got his shit
together and did read the baby books and

2123
01:51:26,110 --> 01:51:27,130
she's Kinda hot and cool.

2124
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:30,810
And then at the end that one night stand
slash pregnancy totally worked out.

2125
01:51:30,811 --> 01:51:33,910
So Hey, knocked up. Beautiful. That's
how it works. You know that, um,

2126
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:38,170
that other one that she did recently
with Josh Duhamel, that was his name is,

2127
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:41,350
I don't, I'm not going to feel deeply
guy from Vegas. The guy from vague,

2128
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:43,900
it's very nice guy. I did an
episode of Vegas. He's cool as fuck.

2129
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:47,230
He's the one who's married to Fergie
from the black eyed peas. Okay. Anyway,

2130
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:50,260
he did some movie with her and it
looks so, I didn't even watch it.

2131
01:51:50,261 --> 01:51:55,240
I just watched it on TV, on the movie,
on the screen of an, on a plane. Uh,

2132
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:59,470
Washington a plane while I was writing
and I would look up and get angry or get

2133
01:51:59,471 --> 01:52:03,550
angry to help my writing on her
listening to fucking Hendrix.

2134
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:07,880
I would look up at this stupid Shit and
all these slack jawed business faced

2135
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:12,550
douchebags watching this
stupid ass fucking movie
when you know what's going to

2136
01:52:12,551 --> 01:52:15,250
happen. Like this is not a God
damn shocker in this movie.

2137
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:19,840
It was no devil wears Prada.
I always accidentally watched the,

2138
01:52:19,841 --> 01:52:23,680
that the porn version of that movie.
I'm always with a girl and they're like,

2139
01:52:23,681 --> 01:52:27,310
oh my God, Devil's Wear Prada. And then
we turned on its devil's word, Nada,

2140
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:31,620
and it's like come on like every day and
it's always the same. What, what chance

2141
01:52:33,810 --> 01:52:36,130
always watching that pilot
that I had an awe man.

2142
01:52:36,131 --> 01:52:37,450
I was so close to doing one of those.

2143
01:52:37,451 --> 01:52:40,690
I had an offer to be in one that was
like a born yet it was like soft core,

2144
01:52:40,691 --> 01:52:43,090
Cinemax, whatever. And I'm
going to play like Brad,

2145
01:52:43,091 --> 01:52:46,100
like the camera guy who gets to capitated
in an attic after getting blown.

2146
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:51,110
And I so wanted to do it and just did
not pan out girl that I dated a long time

2147
01:52:51,111 --> 01:52:54,440
ago. I saw her once in one of
those. Oh so I was on another date.

2148
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:58,110
I was at this chick's house.
I'm flipping through the channels and uh,

2149
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:00,260
all of a sudden at a nowhere I could grow.

2150
01:53:00,261 --> 01:53:04,520
I did like a year before that was
on this fucking softcore porn movie.

2151
01:53:04,521 --> 01:53:09,170
It was like so cheesy and so
bad. It was so stupid. It was a,

2152
01:53:09,171 --> 01:53:11,300
but it was weird.
What was the setting?

2153
01:53:11,301 --> 01:53:15,500
Was it a tennis instructor was earlier
when you were talking were we're going

2154
01:53:15,501 --> 01:53:16,970
way back more than 10 years ago.

2155
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:22,130
It was probably like 96 or something
to finish. I just moved to La,

2156
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,800
so like, I didn't know it was
too, it was a much bigger,

2157
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:27,020
much bigger shock to me because like,

2158
01:53:27,021 --> 01:53:29,060
just knowing someone and
seeing them on television,

2159
01:53:29,061 --> 01:53:32,820
like being around famous people
when you first moved to hog,

2160
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:35,240
it's the weirdest thing. Like you
don't even expect them to be real.

2161
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:37,250
You think they're like Holograms,
you know?

2162
01:53:37,251 --> 01:53:38,660
And then when you meet
someone in real life,

2163
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:40,610
then all of a sudden they're
on television. You know?

2164
01:53:40,611 --> 01:53:44,060
It's like still fucking
weirds me out, man. It's, I'm
now, I'm getting used to it.

2165
01:53:44,061 --> 01:53:46,280
I'm pretty used to it now. But back
then it was really, and it wasn't,

2166
01:53:46,281 --> 01:53:49,670
it was a girl you dated and all sudden
you're seeing her in some fucking stupid

2167
01:53:49,671 --> 01:53:52,130
movie where she's making out
with some guy. She was, um,

2168
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:56,940
a girl that was in a show
called the hardball with me. No,

2169
01:53:57,290 --> 01:54:00,590
that's it. I just saw a preview
for hard ball the other day.

2170
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:05,060
It's not just confused. Two stories,
two stories. It does another one.

2171
01:54:05,090 --> 01:54:08,430
This is not the girl from hardball. It
was not a girl that I didn't, I'm like,

2172
01:54:08,431 --> 01:54:10,790
I didn't date that girl. I didn't
date that girl. It's a different girl.

2173
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:14,120
But that was another girl that I also
saw around the same time also in a soft

2174
01:54:14,121 --> 01:54:14,900
car.

2175
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:17,710
I'm still waiting to come across like
on a huge is or a red tube or something

2176
01:54:17,711 --> 01:54:20,810
like that. I'm waiting to come
across and fucking high school.

2177
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:22,900
I know you have never had that happen.

2178
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:25,100
I know me too playing the
numbers game and believe me,

2179
01:54:25,101 --> 01:54:28,680
I watch it enough to try to get through
that every day and I've still not found

2180
01:54:28,681 --> 01:54:30,390
it. Imagine if you didn't
notice and you were like Ha.

2181
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:32,510
Cause like sometimes like
you know when if someone,

2182
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:36,830
especially as time goes on like 10 years
ago, you forget, people forget people,

2183
01:54:36,831 --> 01:54:37,610
you forget,

2184
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:41,150
you forget everything and then you're
beaten off and then like halfway in the

2185
01:54:41,151 --> 01:54:46,100
middle of the vase and you're
like, I fucked her. Oh my God.

2186
01:54:46,101 --> 01:54:49,640
Why did she let me do that to her
back then? I had a lab. Yeah. Yeah,

2187
01:54:49,641 --> 01:54:53,510
your asshole sore. No wonder
it's sore now. I know why.

2188
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:57,890
I'm just happy that that when I used to
feel like there's been a couple times

2189
01:54:57,891 --> 01:55:02,891
where I fucked on camera before it was
back when like webcams first came out do

2190
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,470
do do and I'm just happy that that
didn't that so it got on the Internet.

2191
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:08,780
You fucked on the Internet.
What he's saying twice.

2192
01:55:08,781 --> 01:55:11,840
I thought that fucking what about that
thing man that can go back in time and

2193
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:14,660
our time. Any a card that
imagine if it could go wow,

2194
01:55:14,661 --> 01:55:15,980
that's not outside the
realm of possibility.

2195
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,220
I was drunk and I'm like I know agile.
Watch this.

2196
01:55:19,221 --> 01:55:22,820
You imagine if streaming was all recorded
somewhere because it's really just one

2197
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:25,610
zero is going through a fucking computer.
If they figured out how to,

2198
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:30,880
how to go back in time and like reprocess
your FBI white shades that are taking

2199
01:55:32,421 --> 01:55:35,420
all the copies of ones and Zeros that
are spitting through the Internet right

2200
01:55:35,421 --> 01:55:38,720
now. So right now the centers at at t and
t and little garden and all that shit,

2201
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:41,170
they had machines that are mirroring
all that damn machines that are,

2202
01:55:41,190 --> 01:55:44,160
I bet this is true. This is not
conspiracy theory. Would you think?

2203
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,110
Would you think? Absolutely.
You're documented proof.

2204
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:49,230
Would you think like 15 years ago
they were doing that too though?

2205
01:55:49,290 --> 01:55:50,760
Like I not to that level,

2206
01:55:50,761 --> 01:55:53,660
but where do you think that there's
going to be technology to go back and

2207
01:55:53,661 --> 01:55:58,430
somehow you know, get that
somehow? That could be me.

2208
01:55:58,720 --> 01:55:59,790
I mean I don't,
I don't believe,

2209
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:03,120
I believe from here on out whatever
here is not this year or not today,

2210
01:56:03,121 --> 01:56:06,540
but there has been up there. There was
a turning point from that point on.

2211
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:09,690
All of those ones and Zeros exist
somewhere. They absolutely do. Yeah.

2212
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:14,280
Well the really crazy idea is that at one
point in time there's going to be some

2213
01:56:14,281 --> 01:56:19,281
sort of a computer that's so fucking
powerful and that computing power and,

2214
01:56:19,321 --> 01:56:22,290
and what, what's capable,
what they're capable of,

2215
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:25,170
of extrapolating from any
given circumstance. Is it?

2216
01:56:25,171 --> 01:56:28,560
Well they are going to be able to
do is see the world in every aspect,

2217
01:56:28,561 --> 01:56:29,071
like every,

2218
01:56:29,071 --> 01:56:33,810
every single thing about the world
today and literally put into a computer,

2219
01:56:33,811 --> 01:56:35,280
how did this get into place?

2220
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:38,130
How did this get into place
in relationship with that
and go back in time and

2221
01:56:38,131 --> 01:56:43,131
literally be able to recreate the entire
model of life on this planet and life

2222
01:56:44,011 --> 01:56:44,671
in the universe.

2223
01:56:44,671 --> 01:56:47,760
Everything from the very beginning to
them until they get back to Jesus creating

2224
01:56:47,761 --> 01:56:52,350
it. Ah, which was only ironically a
few thousand years ago. It's that easy.

2225
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:54,690
They don't have to go back very far.
Six grand. But here's the thing,

2226
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:57,870
they've already figured out how to record
memories, right? They can, they can.

2227
01:56:57,900 --> 01:56:58,290
They can.

2228
01:56:58,290 --> 01:57:02,160
They believe they can put people's heads
and devices and record those electrical

2229
01:57:02,161 --> 01:57:04,710
impulses and see where they're going off
in the brains and then glean the ones

2230
01:57:04,711 --> 01:57:07,020
in zero data from that.
Right. So I did not know this.

2231
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:10,170
How can you transfer it from you to man?
Well that's,

2232
01:57:10,171 --> 01:57:12,600
that's where they're still working on.
They don't, they know how to record it.

2233
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:15,240
They can gather that data.
It's putting that data back into somebody.

2234
01:57:15,241 --> 01:57:18,270
That's the issue. So imagine in near
future where you put on a cap or you know,

2235
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:20,190
you have your Johnny mnemonic
neural implant and you go,

2236
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:21,660
I want to go skydiving today.

2237
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:25,320
Doubleclick and you pay four 99 for that
adventure and it plays back somebody's

2238
01:57:25,321 --> 01:57:28,740
memory that was recorded of
them free falling. Maybe again,

2239
01:57:29,190 --> 01:57:33,330
I don't remember what the want Julia,
yes. Uh, that was all about that.

2240
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:38,280
Whether you put in memories,
a strange, strange something.

2241
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:43,320
Okay. Yeah. It's like a no, like, yeah, I
talked to him. I remember Johnny Mnemonic,

2242
01:57:43,321 --> 01:57:46,050
which was a great shot
of someone on Twitter.

2243
01:57:46,051 --> 01:57:48,810
I'm sure knows what the fuck this is.
Come on. You use the word, the whole,

2244
01:57:48,811 --> 01:57:51,000
the whole idea that movie
was that that's what you do.

2245
01:57:51,001 --> 01:57:53,740
You would like putting memories
in your head and stuff like that.

2246
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:56,150
They can already record them.
Now the issue is playback.

2247
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:00,180
So once they have that down, imagine an
APP store for experiences. Well, you know,

2248
01:58:00,181 --> 01:58:03,420
I thought about that the other day when
I was looking at my iPhone. Strange days,

2249
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:06,400
knuckles, powerful. Um,

2250
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:09,450
I was looking at my iPhone and it was
something that my daughter did that was

2251
01:58:09,451 --> 01:58:12,540
hilarious. And I was watching it. I
was like, okay, this is, this happened,

2252
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:15,390
you know what happened five minutes ago.
Now I'm watching on this video.

2253
01:58:15,391 --> 01:58:19,410
It's so simple and so easy. Like this
is seriously like a time capture.

2254
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:24,240
Like it's some, some, it's a very
remedial rudimentary form of time capture.

2255
01:58:24,241 --> 01:58:25,860
So imagine all the senses we have,
right?

2256
01:58:25,861 --> 01:58:28,770
All the stuff that we can perceive that
this thing just captures a two d image

2257
01:58:28,771 --> 01:58:32,580
of, right? So imagine infrared
with sonar, with feeling scent,

2258
01:58:32,610 --> 01:58:36,180
with feeling potentially, right? So
it's gonna you're gonna capture scenes,

2259
01:58:36,181 --> 01:58:38,490
but you're gonna capture every aspect
of a scene so that when you want to play

2260
01:58:38,491 --> 01:58:41,010
it back, it'll be just like
you're living in that moment.

2261
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:44,720
It will happen to all those senses. You've
done the isolation tank. I have. Yeah.

2262
01:58:44,750 --> 01:58:46,060
You've done it at the same place,

2263
01:58:46,061 --> 01:58:50,680
the float lab and Venice and cause
we were talking about crash the mad

2264
01:58:50,681 --> 01:58:54,430
scientists down there that creates
these fucking things. But, um, you know,

2265
01:58:54,431 --> 01:58:57,730
he's working on that whole screen set
up, you know about all that, right? Yeah.

2266
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:00,340
What do you think about all that now?
It's flat concept. I agree with it.

2267
01:59:00,341 --> 01:59:02,680
And in theory,
because for those who don't know,

2268
01:59:02,681 --> 01:59:04,300
the idea is that you're
floating in an isolation tank,

2269
01:59:04,301 --> 01:59:05,710
so you're isolated from lights sound,

2270
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:08,440
you don't know where your skin ends and
where the warm body temperature water

2271
01:59:08,441 --> 01:59:11,830
begins. And because of that, your body
and your senses are zeroed out, right?

2272
01:59:11,831 --> 01:59:14,020
So you're,
you're completely open to everything.

2273
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,420
And the idea is that there's gonna be
an LCD screen in front of you that's

2274
01:59:16,421 --> 01:59:21,370
projecting the perfect golf
swing or projecting how to
fuck like Rocco or how to

2275
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:25,690
drive a race car. Like Andretti went,
what? Aco, dude, you went nine go thread.

2276
01:59:25,790 --> 01:59:28,240
It's classic. That's a classic.
It's not even dirty anymore,

2277
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:31,780
but he's still a classic. He kept that
when you need it to. The point is,

2278
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:35,350
his notion is that you'll be able to watch
that in a depth tank and because your

2279
01:59:35,351 --> 01:59:38,470
brain is so in tune and open to all these
memories, it's going to flood right in.

2280
01:59:38,471 --> 01:59:42,100
The problem is that that's not a
pure input method to the brain.

2281
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:44,890
You're going to be aware in that moment
that you're watching an LCD screen,

2282
01:59:44,891 --> 01:59:46,480
there's going to be light
beaming into your eyes.

2283
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:50,610
You will defeat the whole purpose of
sensory deprivation. Yes and no. Um,

2284
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:51,760
but it also,

2285
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:56,320
instead of just sensory deprivation and
minimize the sensory input and it allows

2286
01:59:56,321 --> 01:59:59,470
you to have more mental resources
to concentrate on the video.

2287
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:02,320
That is true now that I'll give. So
if you want to watch a, you know,

2288
02:00:02,330 --> 02:00:05,110
a documentaries. Yeah. If
you want to watch those,

2289
02:00:05,111 --> 02:00:07,870
if you want to numb your senses and just
be focused into one thing, that's fine,

2290
02:00:07,930 --> 02:00:10,510
but I don't believe it's going to
somehow be programmed your brain.

2291
02:00:10,511 --> 02:00:12,190
That's how it was pitched
to me that it will,

2292
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:13,660
that it will change your brain to do that.

2293
02:00:13,661 --> 02:00:15,610
It might make you more aware
of something that's true.

2294
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:19,330
I think it allows my brain to use
more resources. I don't know Brian.

2295
02:00:19,331 --> 02:00:21,820
I mean I'm not necessarily willing to,
I mean look,

2296
02:00:21,821 --> 02:00:25,840
I'm a huge proponent of nothing of the
sensory deprivation tank in and of itself

2297
02:00:25,841 --> 02:00:29,380
being emptiness and nothing, nothing
there. I don't want any input at all.

2298
02:00:29,381 --> 02:00:31,060
I want to know hearing,
no seeing, no touching.

2299
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:34,960
I want to like untethered my
body from my mind visually,

2300
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:38,800
physically in every single way and that's,
you know, that's what I'm all about,

2301
02:00:38,830 --> 02:00:41,800
the isolation tank experience, but
I'm willing to listen. You know,

2302
02:00:41,801 --> 02:00:43,670
I'm willing to like,
it might be maybe,

2303
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:46,240
maybe a little dry here so it just
doesn't sound, it doesn't, you know,

2304
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:49,390
I'm not fully on board for that vision.
I'm done. I'd be game to try it.

2305
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:52,030
I guess just to wrap that thing in
tin foil because there's still three g

2306
02:00:52,031 --> 02:00:54,860
signals and Wifi hitting your
body in there. You've got it.

2307
02:00:55,060 --> 02:00:58,900
I'm not down with this little screen
where I'm down with doing it in some sort

2308
02:00:58,901 --> 02:01:02,980
of a large circular thing where it's much,
much larger.

2309
02:01:02,981 --> 02:01:05,350
When I'm thinking of is
you're in the center,

2310
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:10,500
almost like a in like a giant circular
pod and above you there's a screen sort

2311
02:01:12,341 --> 02:01:17,341
of like an imax screen and that is
the input and it's large and circular.

2312
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:21,250
And when like say if you're, you know,
you have some sort of video on space,

2313
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:23,910
it literally will become the whole sky,
you know,

2314
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:26,680
that I think is possible and
that's a very fascinating time.

2315
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:30,070
I'm waiting for someone to
create technology that beams
the image into your eye

2316
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:32,560
because that's the only way you're
going to really be able to fully flood

2317
02:01:32,561 --> 02:01:35,140
someone's periphery, right. Is to
beam it in there. So imagine like,

2318
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:37,810
so you don't see your own nose, you
don't see anything. Right? So imagine,

2319
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:40,220
imagine a projector that's in that can,

2320
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:42,830
they can quickly and dynamically
response to your eyes.

2321
02:01:42,831 --> 02:01:45,500
Maybe moving around are shifting,
but that's adjusting focal levels,

2322
02:01:45,501 --> 02:01:49,100
meaning in the J and image B into your
eye, giving you that shutter effect.

2323
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:52,850
You'll be able to completely zone out
on something and your periphery would be

2324
02:01:52,851 --> 02:01:56,450
flooded [inaudible] on the
ground floor of that one. Yeah.

2325
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:00,230
You don't want to be fucking blind.
That's why he's on the Nintendo three Ds.

2326
02:02:00,231 --> 02:02:03,350
You don't want the first one to
like see what happens in six months.

2327
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:07,320
The first dudes who tried Wifi or
the first dudes who tried microwaves,

2328
02:02:07,810 --> 02:02:10,990
I was just trying to make it yourself.
Very stake. Now I have a vagina. Oh,

2329
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:13,320
that's weird. Lasik, lasik surgery.

2330
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:15,650
First guys to get in there and
get their eyeballs cut open.

2331
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:20,380
I don't get it to me for that. That
doesn't always work. I mean it's,

2332
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:23,340
they're pretty God damn good now and
now they do it and like it's a couple of

2333
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:26,270
seconds and you get a video of it.
You get like a souvenir photo. Like,

2334
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:30,470
like it's splash mountain. Here's where
we laser dry ball. We corrected the Lens.

2335
02:02:30,890 --> 02:02:33,360
I mean how many, how did they
figure that out man? Who,

2336
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:36,260
how many people did they have to practice
on before they get that technique down?

2337
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:39,410
So they use cadaver eyeball. How these
probably don't sigh balls and shit.

2338
02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:43,340
What's the, yeah. What's the closest
to human eyeballs and an animal?

2339
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:48,020
I think pig is what if you could
transfer a pig eyes to people? Well,

2340
02:02:48,021 --> 02:02:49,790
they've already got now,
like again,

2341
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:51,690
it hearkens back to
transhumanism where they can,

2342
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:56,900
they can let blind people see rough shapes
and and hard edges with the light you

2343
02:02:56,901 --> 02:02:57,860
go five years from now,

2344
02:02:57,861 --> 02:03:00,290
they're going to have the same site
that we do to go 10 years from now.

2345
02:03:00,291 --> 02:03:03,110
They're going to have infrared
heat, vision, all that stuff.

2346
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:05,120
It's a matter of time because
then it's just a lens.

2347
02:03:05,121 --> 02:03:06,580
As long as they can beam
it right in your brain.

2348
02:03:06,590 --> 02:03:09,650
That's when you contemplate
like where this is all headed.

2349
02:03:09,651 --> 02:03:11,690
When you look at this whole
transhumanism thing, you say,

2350
02:03:11,691 --> 02:03:14,930
well what happens if everybody
lives forever? What happens
if there is no death?

2351
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:16,850
I mean, what happens and what
about the resources? Man,

2352
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:20,210
we are already running already at Max.
You know we're already are. We though,

2353
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:23,090
are we really at match? We're not really.
We kind of exaggerate that, right?

2354
02:03:23,410 --> 02:03:26,360
Well everyone, we say we're at Max
based off future projections. You know,

2355
02:03:26,361 --> 02:03:27,920
we're not at Max like tomorrow.
We're fucked.

2356
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:32,690
We know at the current rate with babies
being born and ozone depleted and and

2357
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:34,370
you know so much oil in the ground,

2358
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:38,060
we know that in 15 2025
years we might be fuck.

2359
02:03:38,061 --> 02:03:39,860
So that's why we need to
invest in [inaudible].

2360
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:45,110
I mean how much of our energy is projected
in use towards making food and how

2361
02:03:45,111 --> 02:03:46,310
much of it is towards,
you know,

2362
02:03:46,490 --> 02:03:50,450
fucking war and politics and nonsense and
how the ways we manufacture food right

2363
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:52,010
now are making us sicker and there's,

2364
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:56,000
there's a whole thing there but regarding
like trans humanism in 1520 years from

2365
02:03:56,001 --> 02:03:59,780
now, we're going to be alive for debates
that would be previously unheard of.

2366
02:04:00,050 --> 02:04:03,110
Should someone with a cybernetic implants
be allowed to run in the Olympics or

2367
02:04:03,111 --> 02:04:06,380
run for office or should your kid go to
the same elementary school when he's got

2368
02:04:06,381 --> 02:04:09,560
infrared vision and that helps him
with kickball like that. We don't know.

2369
02:04:09,561 --> 02:04:12,390
I have these conversations with
people when it comes to the UFC. When,

2370
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:15,470
when they started talking to him,
how do you feel about banned substances?

2371
02:04:15,471 --> 02:04:17,090
Because so many people
keep getting posted.

2372
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:22,130
Tiago Silva just got busted for turning
in non human urine because apparently he,

2373
02:04:22,210 --> 02:04:23,043
uh,

2374
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:27,650
he's not a human or it took some something
for his back because he hurt his back,

2375
02:04:27,651 --> 02:04:32,210
but he looked fucking swole in his last
fight and it was super aggressive to

2376
02:04:32,410 --> 02:04:34,490
moles and one podcast dog.

2377
02:04:34,491 --> 02:04:38,090
There's 40 crazy new clothing
line that's going to be swole

2378
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:42,330
in the abs on the outside of the Cock
Eagle. It's just from gay demon.com.

2379
02:04:42,331 --> 02:04:46,260
What I do is I just take the best gay
cock picture. That's what you need.

2380
02:04:46,261 --> 02:04:49,910
A rich deep v Neck with like a silhouette
giant caught coming out of the waste.

2381
02:04:49,911 --> 02:04:51,330
But like I've been thinking about,
I need that too.

2382
02:04:51,331 --> 02:04:53,580
And I'm so glad so many confirmed.
You're just gesture to it.

2383
02:04:53,581 --> 02:04:56,070
That's what the fuck was I saying
before we got on this? I don't know,

2384
02:04:56,071 --> 02:04:59,820
but I got into my bladder. I'll go
ahead. What were we just saying?

2385
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:04,440
Uh, gay demons. Oh,

2386
02:05:04,441 --> 02:05:09,000
banned substances. Sorry, what?
Dragons fucking cars. Yeah.

2387
02:05:09,001 --> 02:05:13,860
It didn't pull up, man. Oh, here it
goes. One of the m banned substances.

2388
02:05:13,861 --> 02:05:16,890
Anyway. What I was saying is that
what people have to realize is,

2389
02:05:16,891 --> 02:05:20,190
look at this dragon fucking a Barracuda.
That's the first one I've tuned into.

2390
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:22,270
That's pretty sweet.
Dragons.

2391
02:05:22,290 --> 02:05:26,040
Fucking cars.com look at that pink cock
or going into that muscle is so weird.

2392
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:29,250
That is weird. That's really
fucking weird. Well, whoever
put those two together,

2393
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:31,960
I don't know. People are
strange man, but this, um,

2394
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:34,260
what I was saying about substances is,

2395
02:05:34,261 --> 02:05:36,580
what we're dealing with now
is fairly simple. We're,

2396
02:05:36,581 --> 02:05:39,510
we're dealing with people putting
chemicals in their bodies. We're,

2397
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:41,790
we're dealing with people
like, dude, you take steroids.

2398
02:05:41,791 --> 02:05:43,320
Did you take growth hormone?
Did you take,

2399
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:46,320
they can't even test for growth hormone
yet. They can test for testosterone.

2400
02:05:46,321 --> 02:05:49,860
They can test for a bunch of different
types of steroids that all work. I mean,

2401
02:05:49,861 --> 02:05:52,800
there's a reason why Barry bonds
got better as he got older. I mean,

2402
02:05:52,801 --> 02:05:56,520
there's a reason why Roger Clemens got
better, stayed good as he got older.

2403
02:05:56,521 --> 02:05:59,340
There's a reason why there's a lot of
these athletes that are well into their

2404
02:05:59,341 --> 02:06:00,750
forties that are competing and it's,
it's,

2405
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:04,920
it's chemicals and what they're basically
doing is a form of a low level form of

2406
02:06:04,921 --> 02:06:08,010
genetic engineering. And what they're
supposed to tell you is that, well,

2407
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:09,870
I mean it,
depending on what you're looking at,

2408
02:06:09,871 --> 02:06:11,970
whether you're looking at
old people who are doing it,

2409
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,440
hormone replacement therapy,

2410
02:06:13,441 --> 02:06:15,600
a lot of people have different
takes on that and they say,

2411
02:06:15,601 --> 02:06:18,810
well that's okay because what they're
doing is just allowing their body to

2412
02:06:18,811 --> 02:06:22,320
operate as if a young body did and
allows them to continue to compete.

2413
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:23,940
That way you get to see,
you know,

2414
02:06:23,941 --> 02:06:26,520
guys play baseball well into
their forties and do well,

2415
02:06:26,790 --> 02:06:28,890
but then you get guys who are like,
okay,

2416
02:06:28,891 --> 02:06:33,540
well this guy has taken EPO and he's
got twice as much red blood cells as the

2417
02:06:33,541 --> 02:06:36,210
average person and he has incredible
endurance because of that.

2418
02:06:36,390 --> 02:06:39,510
And then this guy is taking, you
know, Anna Var and he's, you know,

2419
02:06:39,511 --> 02:06:44,010
got a amazing muscle density and he's
a fucking animal. The, they're getting,

2420
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:47,400
they're getting to superhuman levels and
it's there right now they're doing it

2421
02:06:47,401 --> 02:06:50,160
through, through, through chemicals and
they're injecting themselves with things.

2422
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:53,760
But eventually it's going to be
much more complicated than that.

2423
02:06:53,761 --> 02:06:56,700
It's going to be genetic engineering
would eventually it's going to do is

2424
02:06:56,701 --> 02:07:00,750
they're going to be able to genetically
manipulate the code of a human being and

2425
02:07:00,751 --> 02:07:03,450
they're going to be able to create
human beings that are super humans.

2426
02:07:03,570 --> 02:07:07,270
So we have to figure out man what
w w w when it comes to, you know,

2427
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:11,560
performance enhancing drugs and,
and trying to level the playing field.

2428
02:07:11,561 --> 02:07:14,040
So they saying, you know, as
far as like steroids in sports,

2429
02:07:14,310 --> 02:07:18,150
we have to realize is that this is just
the beginning. It's going to get way, way,

2430
02:07:18,151 --> 02:07:19,260
way more complex.

2431
02:07:19,410 --> 02:07:22,320
They're working on Myostatin inhibitors
where they've used these in mice and the

2432
02:07:22,321 --> 02:07:25,890
mice live longer and they jump fucking
three feet in the air and they look like

2433
02:07:25,891 --> 02:07:26,724
superman.

2434
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:30,330
I mean this is going to happen and people
are going to start taking this stuff

2435
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:32,760
and athletes are going to start taking
it because regular people are gonna start

2436
02:07:32,761 --> 02:07:34,380
taking it too because he like,
fuck,

2437
02:07:34,381 --> 02:07:36,910
I want to live three as long I wanna
be able to jump over buildings.

2438
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:40,090
And if someone came along and they
have a pill and they say, Hey Brian,

2439
02:07:40,091 --> 02:07:42,280
would you like to take this
super athlete pill? There's no,

2440
02:07:42,430 --> 02:07:45,280
you actually live longer. You're
going to be healthier because of it.

2441
02:07:45,281 --> 02:07:48,730
There's no repercussions physically
and it's, you know, 100 bucks,

2442
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:52,480
250 bucks and just changes you forever.
Well fuck you. Of course you take it.

2443
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:56,050
We would kind of first, I let other
people take them at first at first,

2444
02:07:56,051 --> 02:07:58,340
but there would be a day
where we'd do the podcast.

2445
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:01,690
Athletes are on the forefront of that and
trying to tweak and hack their bodies.

2446
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:05,260
Yes. Slowly disseminate
down to the general public
where every day you're grade

2447
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:07,990
schoolers taken a pill cause it's gonna
make them better at tetherball. Exactly.

2448
02:08:07,991 --> 02:08:10,150
And you're gonna be able to genetically
engineer your child from birth

2449
02:08:10,151 --> 02:08:14,740
eventually. Got to be able to say, I want
a six foot six you know, super athletic,

2450
02:08:14,741 --> 02:08:19,060
Super Mesomorph son with the
incredible Iq. Talk about class wars.

2451
02:08:19,061 --> 02:08:21,340
That is when it's really,
the shit is going to hit the fan.

2452
02:08:21,341 --> 02:08:22,810
When it's like talking about
the haves and haves nots,

2453
02:08:22,811 --> 02:08:24,840
you're kids have everything.
They're born with supervision,

2454
02:08:24,841 --> 02:08:28,240
Superspeed and super metabolism. That's
a very good, I keep up with that.

2455
02:08:28,241 --> 02:08:29,140
That's a very good point.

2456
02:08:29,230 --> 02:08:32,710
But people have to understand that the
inequality and then in the inequity of

2457
02:08:32,711 --> 02:08:34,900
the world is what fuels
innovation and when it,

2458
02:08:34,901 --> 02:08:39,901
what fuels people competing and
competition and it fuels like change.

2459
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:45,250
It fuels growth and evolution
and in all forms of art,

2460
02:08:45,310 --> 02:08:50,170
in all forms of technology and all forms
of anything where people are comparing

2461
02:08:50,171 --> 02:08:54,420
their work to other people's
work and trying to compete.
It's important. I mean I,

2462
02:08:54,421 --> 02:08:57,220
I don't think it needs to be complete
and total inequality where you know,

2463
02:08:57,221 --> 02:09:00,960
some people are dying of starvation and
other people are eating diamonds there.

2464
02:09:00,990 --> 02:09:02,650
There's a balance to be achieved there,

2465
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:07,270
but you have to realize that
in competition is growth
and that's how all this,

2466
02:09:07,530 --> 02:09:10,120
that's the motivation,
the energy behind all this.

2467
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:13,330
I just imagined Kanye west starting a
new trend of, yeah, I mean pure diamonds.

2468
02:09:13,390 --> 02:09:16,570
I just mixing that my fucking smoothies
from Jamba juice that's done. Ah, fuck.

2469
02:09:17,170 --> 02:09:20,710
That's what I'm drinking. Yeah.
He wouldn't be far behind that.

2470
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:23,140
Did you hear about this?
The kids that are dying off of uh,

2471
02:09:23,160 --> 02:09:27,310
taking bath salts and plant food? Yeah,
Ecstasy. It's called like diamond dust.

2472
02:09:27,850 --> 02:09:29,020
We've talked about that and it's,

2473
02:09:29,021 --> 02:09:31,690
it's sort of what they calling
it bath salts to sell it.

2474
02:09:31,810 --> 02:09:35,290
We were totally confused when we first
did it. We thought that bath salts,

2475
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:37,560
it was actual bath salts and
someone figured out that you get,

2476
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:39,970
but if they're just labeled it that way,

2477
02:09:39,971 --> 02:09:43,270
and apparently the chemical structure
of it is not technically illegal because

2478
02:09:43,271 --> 02:09:46,390
it's like a cousin of something that's
illegal. It's off. It's called Methadone,

2479
02:09:46,450 --> 02:09:50,170
I believe, but through put
meth in it. Even if it's a Ph,

2480
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:51,700
don't put meth in the name of something.

2481
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:54,110
If you want somebody who can really try
it and you were making them to get into

2482
02:09:54,111 --> 02:09:55,030
it,
they're making them illegal.

2483
02:09:55,031 --> 02:09:57,540
And one of the ways they're making
them illegal is there's a like a,

2484
02:09:57,541 --> 02:10:01,680
a law that allows you to make things
illegal that our next door neighbor's

2485
02:10:01,681 --> 02:10:04,270
cousin's to, to things
that are illegal. You know,

2486
02:10:04,271 --> 02:10:08,280
they use that with dimethyltryptamine
in five methoxy dimethyltryptamine you

2487
02:10:08,281 --> 02:10:12,550
know, five methoxy DMT and,
and dimethyltryptamine. It
was the big one that was,

2488
02:10:12,551 --> 02:10:15,820
they used in the 60s and that was the,
the army research lab used to fucking,

2489
02:10:15,821 --> 02:10:18,370
they had buckets of this
shit and scientists were
getting ahold of it and that's

2490
02:10:18,371 --> 02:10:20,470
how a mechanic got ahold of it and a
lot of other people got ahold of it.

2491
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:24,900
Well when they lock that shit down in
1970 they didn't know about five methoxy

2492
02:10:24,910 --> 02:10:29,170
dimethyltryptamine, which is actually
more potent gram for gram than regular.

2493
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:33,070
And you could buy it online, man, I
bought the shit from American chemical,

2494
02:10:33,470 --> 02:10:35,180
I ordered it online like really many,

2495
02:10:35,181 --> 02:10:39,080
many years ago as a powder or a powder
in the leg, a little vitamin bottle.

2496
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:40,010
It's ridiculous.

2497
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:42,980
There is enough and that saying to get
barbecue for the rest of your life,

2498
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:44,450
you can cook your brain.
How do you,

2499
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:47,690
how do you regulate and make something
illegal that your body naturally produces

2500
02:10:47,691 --> 02:10:50,720
and secretes? Well, you know
that's, that's a good point.

2501
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:53,900
But your body also naturally
secretes testosterone.

2502
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:56,990
And there's the question like we
should test roster and be available for

2503
02:10:56,991 --> 02:10:59,330
everyone could be like Sativex for weed.
They're like,

2504
02:10:59,331 --> 02:11:01,400
well you've heard of Sativex,
right?

2505
02:11:01,401 --> 02:11:04,630
What does that pharmaceutical form of
Sativa and they've done trials with it and

2506
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:07,490
the UK and they find that, oh,
these medicinal marijuana. Yeah,

2507
02:11:07,491 --> 02:11:09,160
we can regulate it and
put it in pill form.

2508
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:12,260
We'll call it Sativex and we'll get
the same effects as smoking a bowl,

2509
02:11:12,270 --> 02:11:16,640
a sativa weed. They've managed to
just isolate work. Yeah, it does.

2510
02:11:16,641 --> 02:11:18,230
It's synthetic THC,

2511
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:22,100
but they're managed to make a
naturally produced product illegal.

2512
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:25,110
And in sell you the pill form of it,
which is created in a lab. Right?

2513
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:27,170
How long was four months?
Santo starts, you know,

2514
02:11:27,230 --> 02:11:30,650
genetically engineering marijuana
and making, you know, it's strains,

2515
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:34,490
bacteria resistant this the,
and then throwing Johnny appleseeds out.

2516
02:11:34,491 --> 02:11:37,710
So everybody's going at so they could
sue you later. So yeah. How crazy.

2517
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:41,840
Right there. They're patenting
nature. That's really bizarre. I mean,

2518
02:11:41,841 --> 02:11:45,530
they're trying to patent pig parts and
pigs and and human. Oregon's, I mean,

2519
02:11:45,531 --> 02:11:48,290
that's an Ext. It's, they'll
find a way to slightly tweak,

2520
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:51,410
modify and impatent patent the
human genome. Sure. Exactly.

2521
02:11:51,411 --> 02:11:54,500
The own a certain level of person
and this type of person, you know,

2522
02:11:54,501 --> 02:11:57,590
they can call them like artificial
people or if you want a designer baby,

2523
02:11:57,591 --> 02:11:59,990
that's fine, but if he's going to
have blue eyes and be over six feet,

2524
02:12:00,050 --> 02:12:02,690
you all Monsanto a check every month,
that's going to happen.

2525
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:05,720
That is going to happen. Right? You're
going to have to pay some sort of a,

2526
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:09,930
some sort of a royal subscription fee
subscription fee for the perfect child.

2527
02:12:09,950 --> 02:12:13,370
Yeah. Apple's going to do it too.
Where is it all end? You know,

2528
02:12:13,371 --> 02:12:16,520
I mean there's the mechanical view.
There's a Kurt's we'll do you think so?

2529
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:17,510
I hope not.
Do you,

2530
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:22,540
are you familiar at all with any of
these people like the Graham Hancock's or

2531
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:27,200
John Anthony West to the world, these
people that believe that there was, um, a,

2532
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:29,690
a distant civilization
that was super advanced,

2533
02:12:29,691 --> 02:12:31,460
that somehow or another
everything fucked up.

2534
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:34,340
Whether it was because of natural
disasters or whether it was because of

2535
02:12:34,341 --> 02:12:38,610
something manmade and that were
literally another generation like are we,

2536
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:41,270
we have rebuilt from 6,000 plus years,
right?

2537
02:12:41,271 --> 02:12:45,150
Like they sent DNA or sent embryos or
whatever and shotgun blast them out of

2538
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:49,220
space. Oh, I've heard that.
Yeah. That's another theory.
That's pants barrier. I mean,

2539
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:51,740
well, no, you're, I think you're
talking about something definitely.

2540
02:12:51,741 --> 02:12:53,750
I'm talking about stuff
that came in on asteroids,

2541
02:12:54,110 --> 02:12:55,940
but what I'm talking about buy this,
buy this.

2542
02:12:55,941 --> 02:12:59,750
I'm John Anthony West and Robert Schoch
and all these other w what they're

2543
02:12:59,751 --> 02:13:04,100
subscribing to Graham Hancock is another
one is that civilization at one point

2544
02:13:04,101 --> 02:13:08,390
in time, whether it's
10,500, 12,000, 500 BC,

2545
02:13:08,391 --> 02:13:12,400
somewhere else was like very advanced
just like we are today. And Mayans,

2546
02:13:12,410 --> 02:13:16,160
they figured it out and then they somehow
fucked it up and we have survived out

2547
02:13:16,161 --> 02:13:20,300
of that. They're pretty sure that
the pyramids were built at 2,500 BC,

2548
02:13:20,540 --> 02:13:24,750
but there's also some other shows around
the pure about that's confusing though

2549
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:25,790
because there's some stuff,

2550
02:13:25,791 --> 02:13:29,360
there's like certain styles of building
and then some of them they've found that

2551
02:13:29,361 --> 02:13:31,010
are like deep,
deep underground.

2552
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:34,290
They've had like dig out and they were
covered in sand like the, you know, the,

2553
02:13:34,291 --> 02:13:34,771
the Sphinx,

2554
02:13:34,771 --> 02:13:38,800
when they initially found it was covered
in sand and even back in the like

2555
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:43,560
hieroglyph days, this finks was covered in
sand. Like one of the, it was Tut, Moses,

2556
02:13:43,561 --> 02:13:47,640
the third, I think it was, had to uncover
it. Like that's part of the hieroglyphs.

2557
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:51,990
I think what they're trying to say is
that at one point in time we had achieved

2558
02:13:52,230 --> 02:13:53,040
great heights.

2559
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:56,790
Whether or not exactly parallel with
the way we live today with technology.

2560
02:13:56,791 --> 02:13:58,340
I mean it might've been
something different, right?

2561
02:13:58,340 --> 02:14:01,140
Might have been harnessing the power of
the sun with mirrors and limestone in a

2562
02:14:01,141 --> 02:14:04,770
way that created a new glass
as opposed to reaction.

2563
02:14:04,830 --> 02:14:08,400
Or it might have also been
a psychedelically based
society where we were,

2564
02:14:08,401 --> 02:14:08,610
you know,

2565
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:13,440
much more into shamonic rituals and
communicating with the spirit world or

2566
02:14:13,441 --> 02:14:16,170
whatever the fuck that is.
It could have been a lot of that too,

2567
02:14:16,171 --> 02:14:18,780
but I think it's very possible.
It's very,

2568
02:14:18,781 --> 02:14:23,420
very ancestors could have been candy
flippers. Yes, yes. Well that's, well,

2569
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:26,910
there's a lot of evidence to that. There's
a lot of evidence to believe the Soma,

2570
02:14:26,911 --> 02:14:29,760
you know, and you go to the, the vedic
texts and you know, they, I mean,

2571
02:14:29,761 --> 02:14:32,540
they all talk about
different psychedelic bruise.

2572
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:35,310
It's pretty clear they're talking about
something that you take, you know,

2573
02:14:35,311 --> 02:14:37,920
and look, that stuff existed
forever. We know that.

2574
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:41,640
We also know that ancient cultures have
been worshiping cows since the beginning

2575
02:14:41,641 --> 02:14:45,360
of time and not even eating them
even when they're fucking starving.

2576
02:14:45,580 --> 02:14:49,740
And that to me, reeks of some, some
deity me. Why is it a deity? Oh.

2577
02:14:49,741 --> 02:14:51,510
Because we use their milk and you know,
they,

2578
02:14:51,530 --> 02:14:53,280
they plow the fields where it's bullshit.

2579
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:57,090
You're getting cow shit and there's
mushrooms that grow cow shed and your trip

2580
02:14:57,091 --> 02:14:59,100
and your fucking balls off.
That's what's really going on.

2581
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:00,480
You're worshiping these cows.

2582
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:03,870
The worship that they have is not
indicative of anything other than the

2583
02:15:03,871 --> 02:15:08,040
consumption of psychedelics.
It's like this weird love for this cow.

2584
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:12,660
Like to me that's, that allows you to
unlock things and you for that to happen.

2585
02:15:12,661 --> 02:15:12,961
To me,

2586
02:15:12,961 --> 02:15:17,961
that seems people like naturally identify
with their own type and are as cruel

2587
02:15:18,211 --> 02:15:21,180
to animals as they need to be.
And when you're starving,

2588
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:24,720
you need to be cruel to animals. But yet
they don't. And there's this like this,

2589
02:15:24,730 --> 02:15:29,070
this disconnect from their actual physical
needs and this is love that worships

2590
02:15:29,071 --> 02:15:31,680
on this, this, this, you
know, deifying this animal.

2591
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:34,980
And we also know that there were
big on fucking psychedelics.

2592
02:15:34,981 --> 02:15:38,020
We know that their past has a lots of
references and the ancient texts to

2593
02:15:38,021 --> 02:15:41,700
psychedelics and psychedelic mushrooms
grow better on cow shit than anywhere in

2594
02:15:41,701 --> 02:15:46,410
the world. That's the best place for that
way. Where's that? Oh right. The island.

2595
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:48,900
Really, you find them up there and
you're going to take the road to Hana.

2596
02:15:48,901 --> 02:15:51,250
And when you're there, like the hot
of mountain resort, big old hill,

2597
02:15:51,251 --> 02:15:54,300
you just climate at about six in the
morning. It's everywhere. We can go that,

2598
02:15:54,350 --> 02:15:57,360
you know, the entire Pacific
northwest of the United States,

2599
02:15:57,510 --> 02:16:02,070
the entire Pacific northwest
literally is like a mind of spores.

2600
02:16:02,310 --> 02:16:06,690
It's like one gigantic organism
life form like a base of spores.

2601
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:10,140
They're fucking everywhere up there.
Psychedelic mushrooms,

2602
02:16:10,141 --> 02:16:12,400
like there's people that go up
there and find them and grow them,

2603
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:14,240
but it's all connected with it.

2604
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:18,480
I mean literally if you believe that that
psychedelic mushrooms are some sort of

2605
02:16:18,481 --> 02:16:21,240
a life form from somewhere else,
which a lot of people believe,

2606
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:26,040
they believe that GE much like they
believe that. Um, you know, the,

2607
02:16:26,041 --> 02:16:28,230
the pants barrier theory that we were
talking about earlier that, you know,

2608
02:16:28,231 --> 02:16:31,720
amino acids and all sorts of water and
different things came from asteroids hit

2609
02:16:31,721 --> 02:16:35,160
earth and that started in seated life.
They believe that somehow or another,

2610
02:16:35,180 --> 02:16:38,030
these spores came from other planets.
You know,

2611
02:16:38,110 --> 02:16:42,220
cause spores can survive in a vacuum and
spores can survive the deep radiation

2612
02:16:42,221 --> 02:16:45,390
of space and right into
fact that this is like some,

2613
02:16:45,650 --> 02:16:49,900
some thing that permeates one entire
part of the country. You know,

2614
02:16:49,901 --> 02:16:53,890
I remember watching or reading something
about it, about, you know like if you,

2615
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:58,700
if you like connected at all together
like you know, the, the, the,

2616
02:16:58,701 --> 02:17:01,540
the how far and how wide it is,
you know,

2617
02:17:01,541 --> 02:17:04,990
and these mushrooms growing in
the same space, in the same area.

2618
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:08,440
That wouldn't be c words come out
of somebody's mouth once. Really,

2619
02:17:08,490 --> 02:17:12,820
that was the fucking trip of my life. What
do they look like? English words. Yeah,

2620
02:17:12,821 --> 02:17:13,481
I was,
it was,

2621
02:17:13,481 --> 02:17:16,360
it was at a moment and I could hear
conversations in the other room.

2622
02:17:16,361 --> 02:17:17,051
I couldn't hear them,

2623
02:17:17,051 --> 02:17:20,590
but I could literally see words and it's
like three d text form floating over

2624
02:17:20,591 --> 02:17:23,740
the partitions in this guy's loft in
downtown La. And I was like, what?

2625
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:26,980
And I looked at them like, and I started
recalling to my friend who was there,

2626
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:29,560
granted this is all, we're
all fucked up, but I'm like,

2627
02:17:29,590 --> 02:17:32,290
they're talking about such and such
in there. Well how do you hear that?

2628
02:17:32,291 --> 02:17:35,080
The music so loud, I can see it and
went in there and was literally,

2629
02:17:35,081 --> 02:17:36,010
as people were talking to me,

2630
02:17:36,011 --> 02:17:39,370
I was watching their mouths open
and the words that they were saying,

2631
02:17:39,371 --> 02:17:42,550
we're physically coming out as text.
Their mouths were warping around it.

2632
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:45,790
And so I must have looked like a tweaker
and a half watching these words go by.

2633
02:17:45,791 --> 02:17:48,520
Cause I was trying to read it like
a ticker as they were talking.

2634
02:17:48,521 --> 02:17:51,010
So the outside world,
I was scratching and going like this.

2635
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:54,010
They probably thought they'd fucked me up.
Did you ask them if you were right?

2636
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:56,380
I was absolutely right.
We talk about it to this day,

2637
02:17:56,381 --> 02:17:59,190
like I saw words coming out of
people's mouths was reading.

2638
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:02,740
Maybe I was hearing it and it was like
some you're, it was just cool. Yeah,

2639
02:18:02,741 --> 02:18:05,410
like a synesthesia and my brain was going,
this is what they're saying.

2640
02:18:05,530 --> 02:18:08,500
I don't know. But you checked with
them on what they were saying? Yeah.

2641
02:18:08,850 --> 02:18:11,410
What we want. Let's just
mushrooms. How much?

2642
02:18:11,650 --> 02:18:15,520
Not that much lightweight
to couple stands. Couple of
caps. Really peanut butter.

2643
02:18:15,550 --> 02:18:17,320
See,
see what's Weird Kevin,

2644
02:18:17,321 --> 02:18:20,440
is that a lot of people especially
that I've met through Joe there,

2645
02:18:20,450 --> 02:18:24,170
their firm believers of like you can just
got to eat a shitload of mushrooms and

2646
02:18:24,171 --> 02:18:26,290
about,
I've never done this my whole life.

2647
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:30,080
It's always been like half an eighth
maybe. I just took it out of it.

2648
02:18:30,081 --> 02:18:31,270
It sounds like that.
Yeah.

2649
02:18:31,271 --> 02:18:35,610
I just took like a half of a half of
the eighth recently and had probably the

2650
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:39,740
most hardcore visuals I've ever had in
my life growing mushrooms. I when I like,

2651
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:42,700
I have friends that smoke Salvia and
they'll see like visual distortions in the

2652
02:18:42,701 --> 02:18:44,610
room. Like they'll look up in the
ceiling, will rip apart and they'll say,

2653
02:18:44,650 --> 02:18:47,440
there's like snow will come in. I'm
like, that's cool. That sounds fun.

2654
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:50,890
When I smoke it, I go to another
fucking dimension to another dimension.

2655
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:53,530
Do it right. The first time
I did it. Oh yeah. Yeah.

2656
02:18:53,531 --> 02:18:56,470
I only did it once and I didn't do it
right and I just did what they did.

2657
02:18:56,471 --> 02:18:57,910
I was like an out of body experience.

2658
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:00,020
But you know when you guys
are talking about you,

2659
02:19:00,060 --> 02:19:03,820
you absolutely can get a brilliant and
beautiful experience from just a little

2660
02:19:03,821 --> 02:19:07,060
bit of mushrooms. There's no doubt
about it, but it's not the same.

2661
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:10,430
How do you know that? How do you know
that? Because I've done them both.

2662
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,730
Because you've done a little and
you've done a lot. Yeah, but you could,

2663
02:19:13,731 --> 02:19:15,650
if there's a, there's a point.
It's all about the mushrooms

2664
02:19:16,210 --> 02:19:17,380
leasing. How do you know that, dude,

2665
02:19:17,381 --> 02:19:19,660
this is like documented
throughout human history.

2666
02:19:19,661 --> 02:19:23,230
People have been doing it the shamonic
way where they take this large dose and

2667
02:19:23,231 --> 02:19:26,440
silent darkness and they do it and they
have a different experience than when

2668
02:19:26,441 --> 02:19:28,640
you take smaller and they
know what they're doing.

2669
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:31,880
Know physiologically the different
effects that it has on the human body.

2670
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:35,960
But I've had the most I've ever had
was probably maybe a quarter mushrooms

2671
02:19:35,961 --> 02:19:38,060
before. And what do you, are you
not listening to what you're saying?

2672
02:19:38,170 --> 02:19:39,740
Because if you're saying
the most I've ever had,

2673
02:19:39,830 --> 02:19:43,130
then you don't have experience about
taking five grams or six grams.

2674
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:45,260
I know you don't have that extra,
but I'm saying in a different way.

2675
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:49,790
I've had a quarter before and yes,
I've had a crazy ass showroom experience.

2676
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:53,900
I had half of an eight the other day
and it blew that shit out of the water

2677
02:19:53,901 --> 02:19:57,070
times up million. Then it was just
different mushrooms. It was good.

2678
02:19:57,180 --> 02:20:00,170
It could be that.
It also could be where you are physically.

2679
02:20:00,410 --> 02:20:02,750
It could be what you had in your
stomach. It could be, you know,

2680
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:03,860
there's a lot of different things,

2681
02:20:03,861 --> 02:20:06,590
but that's doesn't mean anything
because you haven't had the full blown

2682
02:20:06,591 --> 02:20:09,890
experience of the big dose to
compare it to even do anything.

2683
02:20:09,891 --> 02:20:11,440
When it gets to a certain point.
I was gonna say,

2684
02:20:12,530 --> 02:20:15,360
I don't know what's beyond that because
I would have pissed myself and has

2685
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:17,510
silver, one of the best thing
go any further than that.

2686
02:20:17,511 --> 02:20:20,720
Physically Mckenna did a lecture wants
and he was talking about a friend of his

2687
02:20:20,721 --> 02:20:23,420
that chose to remain anonymous,

2688
02:20:23,421 --> 02:20:27,740
but he was like this like
crazy psychedelic guy who
every time he did mushrooms,

2689
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:32,950
his goal was to try to tolerate more and
he would go to like 10 grams and have

2690
02:20:33,171 --> 02:20:34,950
these like the God knows you will.

2691
02:20:34,970 --> 02:20:38,030
What you do is you literally
completely dissolve.

2692
02:20:38,031 --> 02:20:43,010
You see sue exist and you make contact
with whatever the fuck it is that you're

2693
02:20:43,011 --> 02:20:46,730
making contact. It seems like at
first it seems like another life form.

2694
02:20:46,731 --> 02:20:49,460
It seems like some sort of a thing
that's communicating with you and then

2695
02:20:49,461 --> 02:20:52,790
somewhere along the line it
becomes like another world.

2696
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:54,890
It becomes like this,

2697
02:20:54,891 --> 02:20:59,891
this goes away and you go into this next
sort of dimension that's incredible.

2698
02:21:00,171 --> 02:21:03,320
It's so religious and beautiful.
And, and when I say religious,

2699
02:21:03,321 --> 02:21:07,940
it's like iconic imagery and but almost
indescribable because they're morphing

2700
02:21:07,941 --> 02:21:08,990
and changing around you.

2701
02:21:08,991 --> 02:21:13,991
But it's all like love and
wisdom and warm as powerful.

2702
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:18,530
It was what? It's not poisoned. The
LD 50 rate is ridiculously high.

2703
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:23,060
You have to eat like shitloads of
mushrooms to die. It's not poison. Yes,

2704
02:21:23,061 --> 02:21:26,300
but probably not. I mean, mushrooms
is a mushroom. It's a, it's, it's a,

2705
02:21:26,301 --> 02:21:29,740
it is a poison to your body. No one's
not mushrooms, not poisoned. Brian.

2706
02:21:29,741 --> 02:21:33,200
It's like salt is poison.
It's salt poison. Well, if
you need to have kind of salt,

2707
02:21:33,201 --> 02:21:37,160
you fucking die. It's not, salt is not a
poison. Strychnine is a fucking poison.

2708
02:21:37,161 --> 02:21:38,480
What psychedelic drugs are,

2709
02:21:38,481 --> 02:21:42,350
is there something that allows your body
to tune into whatever the fuck it is to

2710
02:21:42,351 --> 02:21:45,310
change the, the, the chemical
composition of your brain to,

2711
02:21:45,311 --> 02:21:49,940
to fuck with your neurochemistry to the
point where some would define that as a

2712
02:21:49,941 --> 02:21:51,530
poison.
They would say you're poisoning your body,

2713
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:55,190
but there's no negative health
react, but you don't, but it's not,

2714
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:57,440
it doesn't wreck your bites.
Shocking.

2715
02:21:57,990 --> 02:22:02,200
Worn out mushrooms and silicide
been to depressive oppressiveness,

2716
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:05,650
bipolarism manic manic states.
Now I'm not saying all,

2717
02:22:05,660 --> 02:22:09,650
but that's not exactly, it could have
easily, which is why they're doing,

2718
02:22:09,651 --> 02:22:12,950
which is like a hardcore drugs.
Salvia killed some kid,

2719
02:22:12,951 --> 02:22:17,360
but he was having issues and of
course, yeah. What I'm saying is,

2720
02:22:17,390 --> 02:22:18,440
you know I,

2721
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:22,010
I'm absolutely with you that small doses
can give you beautiful experiences,

2722
02:22:22,011 --> 02:22:24,500
but it's a different thing
than the high dose is.

2723
02:22:24,501 --> 02:22:28,650
The high doses are ego obliterating. I'll
never achieve that. You know, you scared.

2724
02:22:28,710 --> 02:22:30,490
Oh yeah. [inaudible] homie
from that last time, man,

2725
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:34,380
I know I had a flight the next day and
I ended up at lax swiping my credit card

2726
02:22:34,381 --> 02:22:36,480
from terminal to terminal in the machines.

2727
02:22:36,481 --> 02:22:39,510
Hoping one would recognize my itinerary
and spit it out. It was like, oh,

2728
02:22:39,511 --> 02:22:41,880
this was really unprofessional.
I probably shouldn't eat.

2729
02:22:41,881 --> 02:22:44,250
And all those mushrooms the night
before a flight to New York and a shoot.

2730
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:45,480
But you figured out how to get there.

2731
02:22:45,481 --> 02:22:47,970
How could you not figure out how to look
at your phone and your email that tells

2732
02:22:47,971 --> 02:22:52,110
you what the one of those things.
Good Shit.

2733
02:22:52,210 --> 02:22:54,450
I had a really strong DMT trip,

2734
02:22:54,451 --> 02:22:59,100
which is the last one that I had and
I haven't done anything like that in a

2735
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:00,330
couple of years because it was,

2736
02:23:00,331 --> 02:23:04,410
it was so powerful that for
like a couple weeks afterwards,

2737
02:23:04,650 --> 02:23:09,480
nothing seemed normal. I mean, everything
worked. I could read, I could watch TV,

2738
02:23:09,481 --> 02:23:11,340
I could have conversations,
I could talk to people.

2739
02:23:11,341 --> 02:23:13,950
No one would know that behind the surface.
I was like,

2740
02:23:14,220 --> 02:23:18,030
I don't believe in the world anymore.
I don't trust in this dimension.

2741
02:23:18,180 --> 02:23:20,880
You're waiting for Morpheus to load a
patch to fly a helicopter and your brain

2742
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:23,640
to believe you. Now you're
in the matrix. It was so,

2743
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:27,950
it was so humbling and so crazy
and moving and people go, oh,

2744
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:30,960
it's just fucking drugs, man.
Just doing drugs and you get you.

2745
02:23:30,961 --> 02:23:33,840
Your head's getting all fucked up. It's
all you're doing is you're doing drugs.

2746
02:23:33,850 --> 02:23:37,050
Yeah, maybe. Maybe, maybe
not, but you don't know.

2747
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:41,070
We're not really sure what's going on,
but I guarantee you that changed my life.

2748
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:44,640
Right? I can guarantee you that whatever
that is, if it's just drugs, you know,

2749
02:23:44,641 --> 02:23:45,181
that just,

2750
02:23:45,181 --> 02:23:49,590
just drugs changed me as a human being
and made me reevaluate everything you

2751
02:23:49,591 --> 02:23:52,980
know and is still to this day like Honda.
I think it's, well, it's just religion.

2752
02:23:53,140 --> 02:23:54,090
That's just something you believe in.

2753
02:23:54,091 --> 02:23:57,060
That changes every facet of your life
that has given you visions and made you

2754
02:23:57,061 --> 02:23:59,580
appreciate things in a new way.
That's all it is, is just the deal.

2755
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:03,240
It's the real religion. The real religion
is a psychedelic experience. I mean,

2756
02:24:03,241 --> 02:24:06,930
there's a John Marco Allegro book
or prescribed to him, but his, uh,

2757
02:24:06,931 --> 02:24:08,640
John Marco leg rope book,
who is the,

2758
02:24:08,641 --> 02:24:10,950
one of the scholars that
reviewed the Dead Sea Scrolls,

2759
02:24:10,951 --> 02:24:12,930
he decipher the Dead Sea
Scrolls for 14 years,

2760
02:24:12,931 --> 02:24:16,260
worked on it and at the end of 14
years he said that the entire Christian

2761
02:24:16,261 --> 02:24:17,790
religion was a huge misunderstanding.

2762
02:24:17,970 --> 02:24:20,790
And what it really was about was the
consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and

2763
02:24:20,791 --> 02:24:23,670
fertility cults. And he
wraps, wraps it all up.

2764
02:24:23,770 --> 02:24:28,710
It's almost impossible to follow, you
know, like to follow the, you know,

2765
02:24:29,090 --> 02:24:32,370
the origins of the words and it's like,
it's really trippy shit.

2766
02:24:32,371 --> 02:24:35,910
But the fact that this guy has got
it locked down to this one mushroom,

2767
02:24:35,911 --> 02:24:39,180
this psychedelic mushroom has taken
throughout Europe, you know, constantly.

2768
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:39,571
You know,

2769
02:24:39,571 --> 02:24:43,020
we know that the vikings took mushrooms
and they would go on Berserkers,

2770
02:24:43,021 --> 02:24:43,920
you know, they would call it, they would,

2771
02:24:43,950 --> 02:24:47,340
they would get fucked up on mushrooms
and then go attack villages. You know,

2772
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:49,800
I mean, that's how they
wrote. Yeah, man, they would,

2773
02:24:49,830 --> 02:24:51,720
they would get high on mushrooms.
I still maintain,

2774
02:24:51,721 --> 02:24:54,130
I found my spirituality on
Salvia. Yeah. I'd smoked,

2775
02:24:54,190 --> 02:24:57,000
start with small doses and then I've done
about six times and I don't want to do

2776
02:24:57,001 --> 02:25:00,060
it again because the last time I did
it was so fucking powerful and magical.

2777
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:01,500
It's similar to your DMT experience,

2778
02:25:01,710 --> 02:25:05,380
but I tell me a super potent
flew out of my brain, you know,

2779
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:09,810
and just went kind of Canda tonic and uh,
I saw parallel universes,

2780
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:13,200
parallel dimensions spiraling
out of the corner of my eye.

2781
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:15,150
Like I was just sort of floating in this,
in this abyss.

2782
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:18,060
And I saw it and was rotating. It was
making a noise. It had gravity to it.

2783
02:25:18,210 --> 02:25:20,550
And it was almost like I
could see wedges of reality.

2784
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:23,530
If I couldn't look directly at it, it
would blind me. But out of my peripheral,

2785
02:25:23,531 --> 02:25:24,400
I can see these wedges

2786
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:27,730
of reality going by. And I was like, what
is that? What is that? And something said,

2787
02:25:27,731 --> 02:25:30,580
just fucking go for it. And so I,
I remember reaching out my hand,

2788
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:33,860
what it felt like my hand at the time,
and it's slowed this fear down and,

2789
02:25:33,861 --> 02:25:36,220
and it sucked me into one of
those wedges and I was feeling,

2790
02:25:36,221 --> 02:25:39,760
I felt like I was a kid running around
and what felt like a Russian stadium for

2791
02:25:39,761 --> 02:25:41,770
whatever reason,
holding a flag and there was confetti.

2792
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:44,320
And as with a bunch of other kids, it
was a halftime celebration or some shit.

2793
02:25:44,470 --> 02:25:47,860
And I was like, Yay. Oh, we, it felt
it as real as any other experience.

2794
02:25:47,861 --> 02:25:50,530
I've had my life and a shotgun out of
it and that it was rotating it and went,

2795
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:52,150
oh,
what can I do that again?

2796
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:54,970
And I reached down and slowed it down and
I went in and then I was driving a car.

2797
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,760
It was like another reality that I could
have been living and it was just all

2798
02:25:58,761 --> 02:26:01,690
dimensions and you can't tell me, you
can tell me. It was drugs, drugs, drugs.

2799
02:26:01,691 --> 02:26:03,700
Cause it totally was to some extent,

2800
02:26:03,910 --> 02:26:06,820
but you can't tell me it wasn't as real
as any other experience that I had.

2801
02:26:06,821 --> 02:26:09,580
And when I came to on the
couch I just went, Holy Shit,

2802
02:26:09,700 --> 02:26:12,120
you're fucking freaking me out man.

2803
02:26:12,130 --> 02:26:16,930
Did you record all these Salvia
user? Uh, well, yes. Yes I did.

2804
02:26:16,931 --> 02:26:18,940
Actually.
I have my buddy who was writing it down.

2805
02:26:19,320 --> 02:26:20,170
I had one,
uh,

2806
02:26:20,250 --> 02:26:24,370
in the tank where a eaten some pot
and when you eat a lot of pause,

2807
02:26:24,371 --> 02:26:27,090
especially if you eat the really strong
shit and you can have some incredible

2808
02:26:27,091 --> 02:26:27,924
visuals,
man,

2809
02:26:28,110 --> 02:26:31,320
have you ever eaten in on a plane then
close your eyes and see like cartoons and

2810
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:36,360
like Lou drive the palm springs not too
long ago on some edibles I had a very

2811
02:26:37,561 --> 02:26:40,200
similar vision.
Whatever it is,

2812
02:26:40,290 --> 02:26:44,550
hallucination is what you parallel
dimensions and you what? Mine with mine,

2813
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:45,001
they were,

2814
02:26:45,001 --> 02:26:48,890
I was in the center of what it started
out with me would it started out with is

2815
02:26:48,891 --> 02:26:51,810
like I would the tank, I mean how
many times you done the tank? Uh,

2816
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:56,000
only like three or four. When with,
I've never done at high. She was like,

2817
02:26:56,220 --> 02:26:58,110
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Son

2818
02:26:58,310 --> 02:27:01,010
met some dude named crash on the
boardwalk who was trying to tell me about

2819
02:27:01,011 --> 02:27:03,350
vibrating my spirit and, and
he's like, yeah, hop in my tank.

2820
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:05,960
Yeah, he's crazy. But he's right.
He's right about a lot of shit,

2821
02:27:06,090 --> 02:27:09,420
but don't begrudge me smoking pot
before I hop into crashes. Time machine

2822
02:27:11,650 --> 02:27:14,420
played too many point and click adventure
games to know that that could happen.

2823
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:20,740
It started out, it started
out just getting to the
center, relaxing, letting go,

2824
02:27:20,830 --> 02:27:21,880
and then once I let go,

2825
02:27:21,881 --> 02:27:25,110
then it always feels like once I get
to a certain point of relaxation and I

2826
02:27:25,210 --> 02:27:29,170
completely calmed my mind,
then it starts to take me away.

2827
02:27:29,171 --> 02:27:31,330
Almost like as if I feel
like I'm in a river,

2828
02:27:31,570 --> 02:27:35,170
I feel like I'm a wash and of visible.

2829
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:38,370
Well as I was doing this I,

2830
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:43,440
I came to a point where I recognized my
space and then the space of the planet

2831
02:27:44,621 --> 02:27:47,980
and then the planet in this space of the
galaxy and the galaxy and the space of

2832
02:27:47,981 --> 02:27:50,710
the universe.
And then the whole universe became like,

2833
02:27:50,711 --> 02:27:53,680
there's a bubble that was trapped inside,

2834
02:27:53,681 --> 02:27:57,370
some gigantic infinite like ball of yarn.

2835
02:27:57,670 --> 02:28:02,670
And each thread of this ball of yarn
was like one universe after another

2836
02:28:03,011 --> 02:28:03,521
universe.

2837
02:28:03,521 --> 02:28:08,470
And they were all together swirling
in this moving ball of yarn,

2838
02:28:08,620 --> 02:28:11,050
of universes,
connected like circles,

2839
02:28:11,051 --> 02:28:14,380
connected even with a tube like the
connected them all together and it was all

2840
02:28:14,381 --> 02:28:15,550
luminescent and it was all,

2841
02:28:15,730 --> 02:28:18,190
I was trying to take in all the
information that was going on,

2842
02:28:18,191 --> 02:28:21,890
all of these different various worlds,
but it was all different and all the same.

2843
02:28:21,890 --> 02:28:22,010
And

2844
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:24,260
it was all happening simultaneously.

2845
02:28:24,470 --> 02:28:29,150
And as I was trying to figure out like
how big this is, this ball of yarn is,

2846
02:28:29,530 --> 02:28:32,450
it got literally too big for me to wrap
my head around and I had snapped out of

2847
02:28:32,451 --> 02:28:35,630
it, right? And then I lost it in the tank.
A couple of hours. Several hours. Yeah.

2848
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:39,740
The deeper I get is that the longer
I'm in there, the more I can relax.

2849
02:28:39,741 --> 02:28:42,530
And it's almost like you achieve
like different wave lengths,

2850
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:45,430
different mine frequencies,
you know, like you know,

2851
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:48,500
I mean I know that you do in
meditation and extreme meditation,

2852
02:28:48,501 --> 02:28:52,880
like they've taken monks and they've done
studies and so jealous and envious of

2853
02:28:52,881 --> 02:28:54,140
that shit of monks.

2854
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:57,350
Well just the people that
can deep meditate and get
to that place versus needing

2855
02:28:57,351 --> 02:28:59,690
to take Salvia or needing to some DMT.
I got this,

2856
02:28:59,780 --> 02:29:03,430
I'm not capable of shutting it all off.
Like deep meditation.

2857
02:29:03,450 --> 02:29:04,940
Like yeah,

2858
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:07,880
if I did it every day and that was my
only existence that sure that it's fine,

2859
02:29:07,881 --> 02:29:11,420
but I've got a mortgage. Yeah Dude, we
gotta I gotta cheat to get to space.

2860
02:29:11,421 --> 02:29:14,780
You don't want to get laid and you
want to watch TV. Fuck all that monk.

2861
02:29:14,781 --> 02:29:18,170
She Netflix and cartoons. I'll, I'll
find the universe by smoking it.

2862
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:19,640
You can get it there though.

2863
02:29:19,641 --> 02:29:23,300
You can look like a conversation with
my ego on Salvia and that was trip.

2864
02:29:23,330 --> 02:29:26,390
I felt it inside the visualizer
and my Xbox three 60 of all places.

2865
02:29:26,630 --> 02:29:30,690
That son of a bitch, I'll put
that on it. And what at the time

2866
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:33,450
you use the vision cam so when you move
around it would make the visuals on the

2867
02:29:33,451 --> 02:29:37,890
screen go nuts. Jeff Mintzer is a
genius. He wrote the three g o get.

2868
02:29:37,891 --> 02:29:40,140
Do you remember the three dio at all?
You said about the freedom of the console.

2869
02:29:40,150 --> 02:29:40,983
Yeah.
Yeah.

2870
02:29:41,010 --> 02:29:44,700
He used to come with a trippy game where
you could control this kaleidoscope and

2871
02:29:44,701 --> 02:29:46,340
when I used to be a kid do 11 that said,

2872
02:29:46,350 --> 02:29:48,810
that was like the first
level gets here you go. Well,

2873
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:52,740
I took a rip and handed the ball
to a friend and was like, Oh shit.

2874
02:29:52,741 --> 02:29:55,830
And there it went and I
started dissolving. That's
similar like single molecule.

2875
02:29:55,860 --> 02:29:58,470
Oh and the thing of my couch now and
my couch has made of molecules. Cool.

2876
02:29:58,471 --> 02:30:01,310
Get out of that projected fourth
and was like, oh, the Xbox.

2877
02:30:01,311 --> 02:30:03,180
It's pretty sweet right now.
Why don't I just fly into that?

2878
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:06,000
And I did and there was this pulsating
ball after I went through all these like

2879
02:30:06,001 --> 02:30:08,610
little wormholes and tunnel and it was
pulsating to the beat of the music that

2880
02:30:08,611 --> 02:30:11,270
was happening. And I knew that I could
go further, but I was like, what? What's,

2881
02:30:11,310 --> 02:30:14,010
what's going on here? And he's like,
oh, I'm every issue you have right now.

2882
02:30:14,011 --> 02:30:14,844
And you know exactly

2883
02:30:14,910 --> 02:30:19,290
when I was like, oh, what's, and my
x-box visualizer, what's going on Bro?

2884
02:30:19,530 --> 02:30:21,420
And he's like, you know, you know
what? You need to get an order.

2885
02:30:21,480 --> 02:30:23,670
You know you need to fucking fix your
shit. I was like, yeah, I know, I know.

2886
02:30:23,671 --> 02:30:25,950
He's like so relaxed and
fix it. It all, all right.

2887
02:30:25,951 --> 02:30:28,230
We had a convert whole
conversation and I was like, cool,

2888
02:30:28,231 --> 02:30:30,360
can I go swim around the visuals
now? He's like, party on Bro.

2889
02:30:30,361 --> 02:30:33,120
Like totally gave me the permission
to go flying around. And it,

2890
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:36,960
that's one of the most amazing and
an underappreciated aspects of any

2891
02:30:36,961 --> 02:30:40,620
psychedelic experience is the work that
you do on your own personality and your

2892
02:30:40,621 --> 02:30:41,350
mind.
And,

2893
02:30:41,350 --> 02:30:44,460
and uncovering all the bullshit that's
fucking league match why people have,

2894
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:47,670
not everybody, but that's what like
some of my friends have had bad trips.

2895
02:30:47,860 --> 02:30:48,661
It's obviously,
oh,

2896
02:30:48,661 --> 02:30:51,090
I reached a point where I felt like I
was going to die and I felt like no,

2897
02:30:51,091 --> 02:30:53,700
you were getting deconstructed as a human
being and you weren't ready to come to

2898
02:30:53,701 --> 02:30:55,830
grips with the fact that there
might be something bigger than you,

2899
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:58,530
that there might be something real
that you are not to experience.

2900
02:30:58,530 --> 02:31:02,050
And you couldn't let that go. Yeah,
absolutely. Issue. Well, paranoia. I mean,

2901
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:06,600
we had this conversation many times and
someone recently brought this up on, uh,

2902
02:31:06,840 --> 02:31:09,240
on the message board. They were talking
about the people that get paranoid,

2903
02:31:09,290 --> 02:31:10,920
that people that aren't
dealing with their life,

2904
02:31:11,130 --> 02:31:12,950
they've got some shit that they
don't like about themselves.

2905
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:14,280
They feel fucking creepy.

2906
02:31:14,460 --> 02:31:17,460
And that's the reason why they freak
out every time they get high. Right?

2907
02:31:17,461 --> 02:31:19,830
It's like the marijuana,
it does not allow you have secrets.

2908
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:23,430
The marijuana turn some
lights on the corner in the
attic of your house and goes,

2909
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:26,070
Hey, what's going on? It's all
this shit over here. What do you,

2910
02:31:26,071 --> 02:31:26,850
what are you hiding over here?

2911
02:31:26,850 --> 02:31:28,920
Was it my kiddie porn or out
through your mouth and your eyes.

2912
02:31:28,921 --> 02:31:33,570
And then I had my internal
monologue switched with my
external monologue once on

2913
02:31:33,571 --> 02:31:36,540
uh, on, on, on mushrooms. And I
remember like looking at him like,

2914
02:31:36,541 --> 02:31:38,880
why the fuck are you looking at me
right now? Like, what are you doing?

2915
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,400
Is that a red watch? Why the fuck are
you staring at me like that right now?

2916
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:44,550
And I was saying it all out loud. It was
completely switched about 30 minutes.

2917
02:31:44,551 --> 02:31:47,400
People were chatting with my internal
monologue and it was everything I wanted

2918
02:31:47,401 --> 02:31:49,770
to externalize with swallet
inside. It was like, fuck I,

2919
02:31:49,790 --> 02:31:51,990
thankfully I'm a decent enough person to,

2920
02:31:51,991 --> 02:31:54,780
I didn't admit to the bodies in the
basement, but like I could have been bad.

2921
02:31:54,810 --> 02:31:57,800
Do you believe? Do you think
that psychedelics, are you,

2922
02:31:57,870 --> 02:32:01,170
have you ever even considered that
their agents of human evolution and that

2923
02:32:01,171 --> 02:32:05,010
they're here to rocket rocket
you forward and rocket us four.

2924
02:32:05,011 --> 02:32:07,710
And the reason why we're
not monkeys, I mean, I, I,

2925
02:32:08,910 --> 02:32:10,350
I believe in a mixture
of all those things,

2926
02:32:10,351 --> 02:32:13,760
but I certainly can understand an animal
taking something and thinking about a

2927
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:16,590
rock in a different way and going, that
could be a spear to kill an animal. Right.

2928
02:32:16,690 --> 02:32:17,040
You know,

2929
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:20,430
like why the fuck not if I can see other
planets and have a chat with my Xbox

2930
02:32:20,431 --> 02:32:21,090
visuals.

2931
02:32:21,090 --> 02:32:23,970
Why couldn't a gorilla and a forest
have realized a better way to keep warm?

2932
02:32:24,020 --> 02:32:27,770
Yeah. Psychedelic mushrooms have been
around the current state for thousands and

2933
02:32:27,770 --> 02:32:28,561
thousands and thousands of years long.

2934
02:32:28,561 --> 02:32:33,240
Predating what we know of
as human civilization. We
know monkeys weed, anything.

2935
02:32:33,241 --> 02:32:35,890
They'll try shit out, you know, they
try anything out. Don't pee in their,

2936
02:32:35,891 --> 02:32:38,190
on mounds and a tree. It's a greatest
video ever. It is pretty good.

2937
02:32:38,191 --> 02:32:38,890
They'll do whatever they want,

2938
02:32:38,890 --> 02:32:43,080
almost as good as the one where he
flashlights the frog, all that. Plus Frog.

2939
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:45,200
I love it. She'll just, he goes,

2940
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:49,050
he goes through like the gorilla suit tra
like he tries different positions with.

2941
02:32:49,060 --> 02:32:50,910
It's like, I'm gonna sit on
my back. That's not enough.

2942
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:54,090
I'm going to tea bag them for a while.
Like he really puts that frog. It's crazy.

2943
02:32:54,140 --> 02:32:57,630
And it's amazing that people are sitting
there watching too and they're laughing

2944
02:32:57,631 --> 02:32:58,840
and fill me and joking around.

2945
02:32:58,860 --> 02:33:01,950
Families are there and shit and
this chimp is just fuck mouth.

2946
02:33:01,951 --> 02:33:02,870
Fucking the shit out of this.

2947
02:33:03,780 --> 02:33:06,810
Meanwhile Hydrawise from real sex and
you turn your eyes towards all the

2948
02:33:06,811 --> 02:33:09,870
slaughter and murder on TV.
You know,

2949
02:33:09,871 --> 02:33:12,210
we talked about this before but I'll
just bring it up one more time before we

2950
02:33:12,211 --> 02:33:12,720
get out of here.

2951
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:17,720
There's a website that had this horrific
video of a drug killing in Mexico and

2952
02:33:18,961 --> 02:33:20,880
this guy had been chopped
up into all sorts of pieces.

2953
02:33:20,890 --> 02:33:24,240
They showed everything in graphic detail
except they cut his hands off and in

2954
02:33:24,241 --> 02:33:27,720
one of the hands was his dick and balls
and his dick and balls. They it out. It

2955
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:32,790
got to pixelate that we can't let the
kids know what else. They're ridiculous.

2956
02:33:32,820 --> 02:33:34,530
Weird world.
Do you think,

2957
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:36,690
I mean you hear about the protests
going on right now in Mexico.

2958
02:33:36,691 --> 02:33:39,240
Do you think that's about to boil over
really, really fast? What is going on?

2959
02:33:39,241 --> 02:33:41,970
What are the thousands of people in the
streets about the drug cartels and the

2960
02:33:41,971 --> 02:33:45,130
violence on the same day that they
discovered mass graves and they discovered

2961
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:46,320
another massacre? Yeah. Yeah.

2962
02:33:46,350 --> 02:33:49,800
This is the same place where there's 72
people recently. This was over 50 people.

2963
02:33:49,830 --> 02:33:53,190
It's terrifying, man. That's
really close to all of us.

2964
02:33:53,191 --> 02:33:56,440
It's all happening right now.
We got to go to Libya. Yeah,

2965
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:57,810
we got to go to Afghanistan.

2966
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:00,770
Keep that war on drugs popping along
so that we finance all that shit.

2967
02:34:02,130 --> 02:34:05,490
It's all fucking crazy,
Kevin. It's all crazy.

2968
02:34:05,491 --> 02:34:09,980
