1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,090
Is that the noise?
The noise.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,000
Jamie's got a much more
subtle than Brian's fucking
monkey noises. Hey everybody.

3
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,460
What the fuck's going on?
How are you living? Huh?

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,760
This episode of the podcast is
brought to you by blue apron.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,500
Blue Apron is been responsible for at
least three meals that I have every week

6
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:23,510
now.
And uh,

7
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:27,480
other folks in my house he did to blue
apron is this new deal and this is what

8
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,170
they do.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,170
They send you all the ingredients in
the exact portions for excellent meals

10
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:38,190
along with detailed instructions,
recipe instructions with photographs.

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,660
So it's like totally
idiot proof. Um, I've,

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,480
I've cooked a bunch of
different stuff now. Um,

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,060
I've made these awesome chicken
skewers the other day and these,

14
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:51,540
I'm stuffed peppers and they
were like a spicy pepper too.

15
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,050
It's like this bell pepper,
but it was kind of spicy but really good,

16
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:57,750
like interesting Mexican
ingredients in it. So what I'm,

17
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:02,090
what I'm getting at is they're not,
it's not bland food. It's healthy. The,

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,700
they range between 500 and
700 calories per serving.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,060
But you would not guess that you would
think that it'd probably be more than

20
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:09,360
that.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,360
They're really well designed and
they're done by excellent chefs and uh,

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:14,761
you know,

23
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:19,761
really nutritionally sound too
very healthy and shipping is free.

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,110
And I, I'm a big fan of this.

44
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,300
We're also brought to you by me undies,
me undies. Now I'm a guy that he usually,

45
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,520
I usually get an underwear
but just buy underwear.

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,530
Like I would buy them online in like bulk.

47
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,620
I'd buy like 24 packs on your were from
like amazon.com or something like that.

48
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:04,920
And they're always cheap underwear.
But um,

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,500
me and he started sending me these
underwear that they make a couple of weeks

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,440
ago and they're way better.
They just feel better.

51
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,980
They're like looser and more comfortable.
I don't like shopping.

52
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:19,300
I don't like to go places and spend,
I don't have any fucking time, man.

53
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,730
I don't have the time to go and
pick out underwear. So I would,

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,520
if I was shopping and I was
passing the underwear thing,

55
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,250
I would just reach and grab
one and throw it in there.

56
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,750
I wouldn't think at all about it.

57
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,050
But with me undies you can get really
good underwear delivered to you.

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,920
Now this is where it's fucked up.

59
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,880
A recent survey showed that men kept her
underwear for an average of seven years

60
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,890
thinking,
I mean I dunno about you,

61
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,160
but when I'm alone I do not
hold back on any farts. Okay?

62
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm not scared of my own farts.
I cut them loose.

63
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,450
So seven years of filter and farts.

64
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,020
I just do not trust any washing machine
to to like really do a good job enough

65
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:03,490
to, I comfortably set my balls after
seven years and that kind of a filter.

66
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,900
So get rid of your fucking underwear
and get some real underwear.

67
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:08,734
That's my point.

68
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,860
Go to me undies.com they have excellent
underwear that feels great and they even

69
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:16,420
pull moisture away from your body,

70
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,860
so keeps your balls nice
and smooth and cool.

71
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,700
Me undies has the most comfortable
underwear you have ever tried.

72
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,550
They fit perfectly. They don't
ride up on you. And again,

73
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:31,480
they literally pull moisture away from
your skin. So you're cool all day long.

74
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,540
Now that I've worn these underwear,
I just got a new box.

75
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,060
Then they just send them straight to a,
now that I've warned them,

76

is pretty done. Haven't done.

87
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,250
I haven't really made this happen.
I've been neglecting,

88
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
not that it'll buy new underwear,

89
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,830
but I haven't had a
technological jump and underwear

90
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,453
for so long.

91
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,780
Yeah, I haven't either. You know,

92
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:31,960
one of the things I learned from you
from hanging out with you is the power of

93
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,600
wool and, um, I've been
trying to frame, yeah,

94
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,150
you're trying to find good wool
socks. Like athletic socks. Yeah.

95
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,243
Do they have them?

96
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,860
They do the Rehab Merino blend.
You may get like a thinner Merino blend.

97
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,090
They have like athletic socks, like, I
don't know. I don't know if it's that,

98
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,980
I don't know if they qualify him as
athletic. I like, I've never seen one.

99
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:53,950
It's meant for like going to the gym.
They're always kind of meant for like,

100
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:54,970
they'll call them light hiking.

101
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,940
Oh No.

102
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,630
That's why I need some light wool because
it seems like that's what you should

103
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:04,100
have. Right. So, I mean, that's all I
wear now. It's the best first fruit.

104
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,060
I'm still stuck in the ice age or the,
what do you call it, with stone ages?

105
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,670
Underwear. Anondi's man. But first light,

hot and humid. That's what I'm saying.

112

we're brought to you by tig. Uh,

119
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,321
They don't have any of that.

120
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:08,090
With Ting with ting does is they decided
to rent time on the sprint backbone.

121
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:09,560
So you using sprint service.

But they do it their way and their way
is definitely going to save you money.

00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:16,220
98% of people would save money with Ting.

124
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,260
I use Ting Ting is the official
cell phone of this podcast.

125
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,790
I just got my newest one recently
and it is, uh, I fucking love it.

126
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,160
It's the Samsung Galaxy s four.

127
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,670
It's a little smaller than the one
you got this one right here? Yep.

128
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,500
What do you have to note? Yeah, my and my
new me undies looked good on there, man.

129
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,680
The note is pretty dope. But
what I like about this, it
has a Builtin, um, built in,

130
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,970
um, a heart monitor right
there. It's a pulse detector.

131
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,360
Finds out what your heart rate is like.
Don't just put your finger on it,

132
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,320
put your finger on there and it has
apps that go along with it and it's also

133
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,010
waterproof.

134
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,070
That's one of the reasons why I got or
water resistant and should say they don't

135
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,310
see this little tab.
There's tabs shuts down and boom.

136
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,720
And that's just sent to me by tank.

137
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:03,290
This is the official cell phone of
the Joe Rogan experience podcast. Um,

138
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,880
what they do is they charge,

139
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,210
this is one of the reasons why you saved
money is a lot of companies like if you,

140
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:11,300
um, if you've got a plan like
get a hundred minutes a month,

141
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,930
if you use 80 of those minutes, you don't
get any credit for those 20 minutes.

142
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,070
If you use 120 minutes, they charge
you extra. You get like an overage fee.

143
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,040
Tang has none of that.
You only use what you pay for.

144
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,450
And 98% of people would save money
with Ting. That's a real figure.

145
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,740
I have had no one who's used ting that
has not told me it's a way better service

146
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:33,890
as far as like saving money.
And again, you're using sprint,

147
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,890
so it's not like some rinky dink cell
phone service where you're not going to

148
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,670
get good coverage.

149
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:42,670
$21 is the average monthly bill
per device for 10 customers.

150
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,530
And they have, if you go to the shop, uh,

151
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:50,420
at a rogan.ting.com there are all sorts
of different cell phones to choose from,

152
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:51,530
from the really cheap,

153
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,740
you can get like a wonky ass little tiny
smart phone like to HTC evo four g 49

154
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:02,610
bucks. You can even get a flip phone.
They still sell flip phones, Samsung, uh,

155
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,610
m 472 bucks,
little flip phone.

156
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,150
Or you can get us an apple iPhone
and they have the full range.

157
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:11,790
You can get like an iPhone four
if you're not, if you're like,

158
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,640
I want an iPhone but I don't need the
latest shit, just give me something cheap.

159
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,020
You get that for 95 bucks.

160
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,770
Or you can go all the way up and get
like the latest and greatest like the

161
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:23,820
Samsung Galaxy s four or s five,
the sound,

162
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,300
the galaxy note, which
is, um, the note three,

163
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,010
they have that for sale as well.

164
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,380
They have all the latest and
greatest android devices.

165
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:35,620
So go to rogan.ting.com and you'll
save 25 bucks off of those. All right,

166
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,750
we're done with commercials. Steven
now is here, ladies and gentlemen,

167
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,900
we're going to get down to business.
We're going to talk, not even business.

168
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,960
Well like bullshit
experience.

169
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,690
Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

170
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,090
Brian Cowen was going to try to make
it here today. Oh really? But he um,

171
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,190
he had some podcasts.
He's scheduling advance.

172
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,500
I tried to get him to cancel
but he couldn't lease your bed.

173
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,140
But he's very excited to come in those
till Laska and that should be a nice

174
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:04,890
silly trip

175
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,640
man. I'm, I'm looking, I'm excited
about that trip. It really is.

176
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,900
When you get up into that,

177
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,280
when I say that when you
get up into the Alpine zone,

178
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,320
like the above timberline in southeast
Alaska, it really like, you know,

179
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,120
it's cooler looking than like
the walk forest, you know?

180
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,020
I mean it's just as amazing because you
have this like you go from old growth

181
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:29,700
stuff where you could, like the
three of us could all stand around,

182
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,410
joined hand to hand and you couldn't
reach around these trees, you know? Wow.

183
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,180
And you climb a little
higher and it's like boom.

184
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,170
It's just like wide open and there's,
there's really nothing like it.

185
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,280
I mean, you can't, you just can't
fathom the beauty of it, you know? Well,

186
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,330
I've seen it on your show

187
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,310
where you went hunting blacktail deer,

188
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,240
right when you land on a float plane and
then you go up into the, uh, into the,

189
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,090
the upper regions.
That was where the fog rolled in.

190
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:56,800
And you had that nice deer in your scope.

191
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,640
No wait. You know, that that time when
I was up there, there was a wind storm.

192
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,490
The wind was so bad, it made the front
page news and town and I'm 70. They, they,

193
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,470
they kept saying like 70 some mile an
hour winds blew down a bunch of phone

194
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:11,300
poles the next day, uh, uh,

195
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,900
a pilot came up to kind of fly over to
see if we were still alive and everything.

196
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:17,360
You know, he just kind of
cruise around a check. It was,

197
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,510
that's the thing is the weather.
So when we go on this trip,

198
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,830
we could either just get,

199
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,580
we can either have the worst time or
the best time depending, you know,

200
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,750
I mean just depending on the weather,

201
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,780
it can be so just uncomfortable and
miserable or it can be just beautiful.

202
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,820
And there's places back in there. You
know, principals island is huge. It's the,

203
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,190
I think by some definitions,
either the second or

204
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,700
third or fourth biggest island we have.

205
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,680
What's interesting about it that island
is, it has, you know, half the, sir,

206
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,400
I think it's half the surface area
as Hawaii, the big island in Hawaii,

207
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,810
but has like three times the
coastline. Whoa. Just, you know,

208
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,180
it's just a crazy like
fjords and inlets and bays.

209
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,560
But there are places in
this island that you,

210
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,210
you can't really, there's no road
system in la, in La and a lot of it,

211
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,400
and there's places you can't fly to
because there's no lakes to land and it's

212
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:14,740
really hard to walk there.
So sometimes you're looking at,

213
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,420
there's mountains there and you're
like, I guarantee that no one, you know,

214
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,120
you can't guarantee it. But I mean
like for a hundred years it's probably,

215
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:24,730
no one has stepped foot on that
thing because you really had,

216
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,480
we'd have to get to one place and you'd
have to get a boat and carry it through

217
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,790
and go across to another
place and then climb up. Well,

218
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,070
it'd be mostly just climate.
Like you just, when you,

219
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,040
if you fly over some of those mountain
tops and you look around, there's,

220
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:40,920
this is no way. I just know that no one's
been there unless you could land up,

221
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,490
lets you can land up there on a lake,
you know,

222
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,410
we'll land not will land in a spot.

223
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,910
And I want to just walk from there and
I think we will walk up into stuff that,

224
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,350
that people haven't walked there.
I mean,

225
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:55,270
there's always some crazy
thing he didn't know about,

226
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:58,120
but we're going to walk into some stuff
where people just have not walked. Well,

227
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,040
you know,
you can stand around places there and say,

228
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,660
I like,
you know,

229
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,220
I feel very certain that I'm
like definitely the first
guy to ever have his feet

230
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,550
sitting right here. I can't discount
something that happened, you know,

231
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:16,510
hundreds and hundreds of years ago.
But there's just some wild stuff in there.

232
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,340
Wow. It's, it's uh, you know, right
now I've got mixed feelings about too,

233
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,540
but they just, the forest service up there
just announced they're going to be, uh,

234
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,860
open up cut up there.
6,000 acres of old growth for clear cuts.

235
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:33,310
Yeah. Wow. That's kind of fucked
up dude. I understand every single,

236
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,310
I understand every single
argument for and against.

237
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,240
I understand every single argument.
What's for, what's the good aspect of it?

238
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,590
The economics.
I mean,

239
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,020
that's like you used to have a thriving
logging industry based around Tongass,

240
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,330
you know, Tongass national forest.
So it just atrophied. Right?

241
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,600
So it's a job creation
thing, you know? I mean that,

242
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:57,340
that's the for the forage is just people
that live there have an access to like

243
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,240
a good paying job.

244
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,690
The downside is we have just a
minuscule fraction of old growth left,

245
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,620
you know? Yeah. Just, I don't see
why anybody would allow that. I mean,

246
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:10,180
I understand the economic thing,

247
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,670
but I always feel like there's
gotta be another way to make money.

248
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,850
What's weird too is Tom has just said
recently that over the next decade they're

249
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:23,341
looking to phase out old growth
logging at the same time that they are

250
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,650
announcing and pushing forward with plans
to do a big 6,000 acre clear cut sort

251
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,980
of sort of acknowledging on one hand they
they want to get out of it or need to

252
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:35,470
get out of it or can see into the
future that need to get out of it.

253
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,620
And An air hammer being like,
but we'll have one last Hoo Rah,

254
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,170
I got one last party.
And you're dealing with,

255
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,130
how old do you think these trees are?
I mean these, you know, there's the,

256
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,650
I can't speak specifically
to that particular area,

257
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:50,260
but I mean there's like Doug
firs that are much older than,

258
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,430
than the birth of this nation
out and cedars. I mean, you know,

259
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,560
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
years old. That's huge. Giant trees.

260
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,970
Chop them down and make what?
It's sad man. But you know paper,

261
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,870
like everything gets so weirdly, we've
talked about this before on the show,

262
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,800
how things get so convoluted, like one
of the big, just to bring it back to us,

263
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:11,690
going on a hunt for CYCA black tail deer,

264
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,830
like they'll sick a black tail deer
when we're going to look for him,

265
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,810
we're going to be looking for him up in
the Alpine, which they'll be leaving.

266
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:23,630
So there'll be leaving around
the time we're going there.

267
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,420
That stuff's still has snow.
Like we're,

268
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:29,450
we're going to be looking for deer
will still have snow in June. Okay.

269
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,560
Then it melts off and there's long days
and it turns like beautiful and it gets

270
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:34,760
very vibrant and green.

271
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:38,330
There's all kinds of succulents and
deer come up out of the timber to feed

272
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:40,940
around in there and then
in October it snows.

273
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,430
So you have like a couple snow free
months in October it snows and those deer

274
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,323
all split.

275
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,070
Traditionally what those deer want to
do is they want to go down and spend the

276
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:54,071
winter down in old growth because the
old growth canopy allows for a kind of a,

277
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,250
you know, a snow free sheltered
understory where they're, you know,

278
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,780
down on the down in the ground and they'll
hang out in that old growth timber.

279
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,900
So an argument against the cut
would be that we need it for deer.

280
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,880
And a further argument would be the
reason we need to protect deer habitat is

281
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,490
because we needed to protect
the wolves out there.

282
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,520
And some people right now are trying to
make a push to say that the wolves in

283
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:26,120
the Alexander Archipelago of which Prince
of Wales island is a part that those

284
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:31,121
wolves are genetically extinct and they
therefore deserve a level of protection,

285
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:35,210
like their own level of protection that
they would get endangered species act

286
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:38,420
protection out on these islands
when other people are arguing.

287
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,210
It's just the same wolf man.
I mean it's like you got wolves all over.

288
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,020
It doesn't like that population
doesn't deserve any specific thing.

289
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,890
So it winds up being that people who
might be pushing against the timber sale

290
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,240
might wind up also be angling
for protecting wolves out
there from hunting and

291
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,130
trapping. And then you're
left to be like, well,

292
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:59,690
I'm not really comfortable
with the timber sale,

293
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:04,691
but I'm not really comfortable with you
using biological lumping and splitting

294
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:07,670
in order to like close down
certain sorts of hunting season.

295
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:11,600
So it winds up being that all your
friends aren't necessarily, you know,

296
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,740
like the enemies of your enemies
aren't necessarily your friends. Wow,

297
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,190
wow. Wow. So anyways, we're
going into that area and

298
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,300
hunt some black tail deer and there's
a health is a good healthy population.

299
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,560
You know, it's still good. Even a non
resident, you're allowed two bucks.

300
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,490
And do they um, do they have
bear up there? Is it black pair?

301
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,830
You have to think about the bears.

302
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,160
You'll see some bear droppings or
bear scat or bear shit here and there.

303
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,870
But those bears out there,

304
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:46,871
so tuned in on the salmon runs that
they really don't spend a lot of time.

305
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,070
Um,
I think some move,

306
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,340
but they really don't spend a lot of time
feeding in those areas because they're

307
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,730
down 2000 feet. Timberline
is like 1800, 2000 feet.

308
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,500
They're down 2000 feet lower in
the river, miles feed, non salmon.

309
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,280
And we, and we'd like to have, you know,

310
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,100
that image of the bear grabbing a salmon
out and he's all silver and shiny and

311
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:12,750
healthy and floppy, but long after the
runs are kind of done, they're down.

312
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:16,530
They're just, they're down. They're just
feeding and rotten fish laying around.

313
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,120
I've watched,
I've watched wolves,

314
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:23,070
they're eating dead saying I watch five
wools one time eating dead salmon that

315
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:26,970
were the consistency of pudding.
Whoa. Just mopping it up.

316
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,920
They must have unbelievable stomach
fat, man. You can't even imagine. So,

317
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,330
um, there's not a lot of bears up
there. You know, there's a lot of,

318
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,410
you see some barriers around,

319
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:39,810
but I think that so many of the
bears are focused on that stuff.

320
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,980
One thing you find some people say,
and in those islands in southeast Alaska,

321
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:44,700
dude,
they're like,

322
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,600
they tend to be either a black bear
island or a grizzly island and it just,

323
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,120
and it changes. So you'd be on one island
and it's black bears, another island,

324
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:52,741
islands,
grizzlies.

325
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:55,980
And it's sort of this weird phenomenon
that they don't readily mix.

326
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,360
You get an interior areas on the mainland
where you have grizzlies and black

327
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:01,470
bears coexist.

328
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Oftentimes the grizzlies will dominate
the salmon streams and you'll have more

329
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,240
black bears up high.

330
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,960
So you could be standing on a mountain
a couple thousand feet above sea level,

331
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,590
and it's just black bears everywhere on
top of the mountain feed on blueberries.

332
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,010
And you're looking down
at Primo salmon streams,

333
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,330
but just big brown bears being grizzlies
down there and they kind of hoard the

334
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:28,260
spot and the blackberries
don't get in there. They just
can't. They, they, you know,

335
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,060
they're kind of enemies. Yeah, they'll eat
them too. Right. They'll eat grizzlies.

336
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,660
Yeah. The, uh, the place that I was
up in Alberta, we went bear hunting.

337
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,340
They take a carcasses after they
cut the back straps off in the Hams,

338
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,320
they'll take like the
body cavity and they,

339
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:46,290
they leave it in certain areas where
they know grizzlies are to keep the

340
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,360
grizzlies coming over there. Right? Yeah.

341
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:52,410
Cause they don't want the grizzlies
coming to the, um, the other, uh, Bates,

342
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:54,480
the baits they have out for the
black pair of no one can do,

343
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:57,120
they have to abandon that bill
because it's just too sketchy.

344
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,480
They have some photos from
track camera trap photos,

345
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,810
these fucking enormous grizzlies wandering
standing up on black bears. Yeah.

346
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,170
I got a buddy who saw one time,
he witnessed a grizzly kill,

347
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:12,810
a black bear disemboweled it and eat
its liver. Whoa. Yeah. And there's a,

348
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,780
there's a very well regarded
hunting guide in Alaska,

349
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,600
is written some good hunting books
about Alaska named Tony Ross.

350
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:21,660
And I was reading his book on
Hunting Kodiak or he's got,

351
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:25,290
he's got a book on Hunting Brown bears
and grizzlies in Alaska and live his

352
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,720
experiences around Kodiak
and the Alaska peninsula.

353
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,850
And he was saying he's never seen.

354
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,850
And just the backup for
a minute on Kodiak a sig,

355
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,210
like if you map out a bear's diet,
okay.

356
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,620
A bear bore bear male,
Brown bear Grizzly,

357
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:43,650
you know brown bear on Kodiak.
If you met Bob as annual die,

358
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,700
what he's tuned into in the
spring are brown bear cubs.

359
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,500
Yeah, he's like males, right?

360
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,840
He's like wakes up and he's hunting
brown bear cubs and as a sick fuck

361
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,020
significant part of his diet.

362
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,690
But what Tony Ross has said and
all of his years of guiding,

363
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,260
he's never seen where when you
kill a big mature Bor brown bear,

364
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,700
he's never seen where another brown bear
will come and scavenge that carcass.

365
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,890
Wow. They'll skate. They even with the
things skinned out and butchered. Right.

366
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,490
They recognize through smell or whatever.
They will not mess with that thing.

367
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,170
That's what he says. Black
and his guys seen. Oh yeah.
And this guy has seen a lot,

368
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,740
but he was saying nothing will touch
those big boars. The body on him too.

369
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,980
Scared of. I just, I don't
know, even with some the bottom,

370
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:32,440
the smell or something and they just
know that they don't want anything to do

371
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:32,680
with it.

372
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,440
Wow.
When we were in a Alberta,

373
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:39,520
one of the guys shot a bear late at
night and they didn't want to retrieve it

374
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:42,130
because there was too many bears in
the area. It was just getting sketchy.

375
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,780
They shot the bear like right at the
moment where it's getting dark out and the

376
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:49,570
bear ran off and they just said,
we'll come back in the morning.

377
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:53,560
So they came back in the morning and a
big bore was eating the other black bear.

378
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,030
Oh really? So they had, they were
taking selfies like smiling while there,

379
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:00,220
there was a bear behind them eating a bear

380
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,860
carcass.

381
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,820
They have new buddy of where he got one
and trail he shot one was Bo and track

382
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:09,230
that the morning and had it was just gone,
had been consumed.

383
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,430
So crazy. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's
the wild man. When we were up there,

384
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:18,870
one of the bears, one of the Boers
had a attacked, a sow killed.

385
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:23,490
It's cub and left half the cubs body and
then the south came back and finished

386
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:26,130
it off. She ate her own basically. Yeah.

387
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,830
She ate her own baby in front of them
while they were in the, in the stand.

388
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,150
I've heard competing theories about that,

389
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,780
that on one hand the board just is
doing it because he wants to eat,

390
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,520
but there seems to be this upside where
there's an additional upside besides

391
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:41,354
chloric intake.

392
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,220
Did a boar will kill a south cubs
and she'll come back into estrus?

393
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,360
Yeah, so when a sound like a,
a sound's to, she'll have her,

394
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,750
her cubs in the den in February and
March. Okay. There's little hairless.

395
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,360
It's Joanie,
you know,

396
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,110
she had them prior to seize the hairless
little things and she'll take care of

397
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:06,590
them. She'll emerge from her
dad, but he's a little fur balls.

398
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,580
She'll stay with them all summer long.
She'll den with them again.

399
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,310
She'll come out again and usually at some
point that summer she might get rid of

400
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:21,311
him and so she's going to be off like
she won't cycle again potentially for two

401
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:26,480
years. So if a bar has in
his area, he hangs out,

402
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:29,150
he's got a half dozen females.

403
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,650
Apparently it's worth the risk to him
that he might be, I'm talking in a,

404
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:34,730
in a genetic sense,

405
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,880
it's worth the risk to him that he
might be killing his own offspring,

406
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,770
which probably has no
idea whether it is or not,

407
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,800
kill his own offstring
offspring in order to,

408
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,950
to have that female go back into
estrus and then breed her. Wow. Nature,

409
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,440
whatever kind of calculation.
He's probably not, I mean,

410
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,540
obviously he's not making
that calculation. He's
probably just going like,

411
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,280
I'm hungry, but an added benefit
of it is apparently he get,

412
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,800
he might double back around and you know,

413
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,460
and get her again and make love to
the woman who's children he consumed.

414
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,261
Well,

415
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:14,000
dolphins actually have a strategy against
that because one of the things that a

416
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:17,840
lot of people are not aware we think of
dolphins is being really sweet and kind

417
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:21,800
and they're nice to people. But
dolphins, they eat their own babies. No,

418
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,340
I didn't know that. Well, they don't eat
their own babies, but they dolphin babies.

419
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,330
And what a male dolphin finds a female
that he has never had sex with and she

420
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:29,961
has babies.

421
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:33,800
They'll oftentimes kill the babies and
they'll kill the babies to force a woman

422
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,820
to back to breeding again because
she'll go on a seven year cycle.

423
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,230
So when a female dolphin has a baby,
she will not breed again for seven years.

424
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,460
While that baby is being raised and and
growing legs, they put a huge investment.

425
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:52,040
The strategy for female dolphins is
they are sluts and they fuck as many

426
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:55,730
dolphins as they can so that when the
mail comes around and he sees her with the

427
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:58,270
babies, like that might be
my fucking kid. All right,

428
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,820
I'm not going to kill that kid because
that's what keeps them from killing the,

429
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:06,020
the, the feed those babies. It's really
why, because they're thinking, I mean,

430
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:08,510
they're really intelligent animals.
They have a cerebral cortex.

431
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:11,510
It's 40% larger than a human beings.
And in a matter of fact,

432
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,770
anybody who's listening to this checkout
radio lab radio lab has an amazing

433
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:18,860
podcast. The one that's on
this week, it's called hello,

434
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,110
and it's all about John Lilly.

435
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,620
And John Lily's work with
interspecies communication with,

436
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,620
you know who John Lilly was? He was
a no, no, I don't know that name.

437
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,400
Maniac crazy man.
And uh,

438
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,410
these other scientists that worked
with him actually wound up taking his

439
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:36,980
research and bringing it to some
new place because Lilly, uh,

440
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:38,990
he was also the inventor
of the isolation tank.

441
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,860
He created a sensory deprivation tank
because he was, he was a pioneer.

442
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:46,870
You're a fan of huge fan Lilly.
Uh,

443
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,950
we would take acid and set up a tank next
to the dolphins and he would take acid

444
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:56,960
going into the isolation tank and
try to communicate with the dolphins.

445
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,710
So while the dolphins were like
make all these weird noises,

446
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,850
he would like try to decipher those
while he was on acid in his tank.

447
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,190
And he eventually went off the deep end
with like really getting like heavily,

448
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:14,870
heavily into ketamine and all these
weird tranquilizers and drugs and became

449
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:18,130
actually addicted to ketamine.
And that's when he lost all his funding.

450
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,420
Nobody wanted to have anything to do
with it when it came to this dolphin

451
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:22,280
research anymore cause they
knew that he was doing that.

452
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:26,150
And one of the women that he had
hired to um, live with a dolphin,

453
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,330
they had like an apartment set
up. Oh, where it was underwater.

454
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,090
It was essentially to her it
was like waist high and water.

455
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,040
And she had a dolphin that she lived
with for like six months in this and she

456
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:41,510
wound up like jerking the dolphin off
because the dolphin would like humper leg

457
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:44,820
all the time. It'd be really distracting.
Cause was a young dolphin. So she's like,

458
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,900
let me just take care of that for you.

459
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:50,160
And she would just jerk this dolphin off
and then you know, to her it was like,

460
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,440
look, he's got an issue and
it's getting in the way of work,

461
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:55,680
so I'll just take care of
that. But everybody else was
like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

462
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:59,430
You're doing scientific research
by jerking off dolphins. Like yeah,

463
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,330
I could see that. Yeah. She might
need a cop minutes to explain herself.

464
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,540
But the,

465
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,560
the podcasts or sort of focuses on
dolphin communication and they're there,

466
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,350
the difficulty that they have.

467
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:16,110
Like they know that the dolphins
want to communicate with them,

468
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:18,960
but they have that blow hole and
that's how they make their noise.

469
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,140
So it's really hard for them to make
noises that mimic human noises cause they

470
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:28,710
don't really have the ability to
make ms and teas and all these dishes

471
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,713
completely different.

472
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,790
So in the,

473
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,970
in the podcasts you hear her talking to
the Dolphin and the dolphin trying to

474
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:40,900
imitate what she saying. It's
crazy. Right? It's amazing.

475
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,450
You get into it. Like when you
get into animal communication,

476
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,730
so much of it becomes

477
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,740
semantical or an argument of
semantics where he'd say like, we're,

478
00:27:50,741 --> 00:27:54,970
we're the only thing with
language. And people be like,
well, you know, actually x,

479
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:56,350
Y and Z has something.
Okay,

480
00:27:56,351 --> 00:28:00,220
well I mean we're the only thing with
complex language, any big, well, you know,

481
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,170
some animals are actually able to convey,
you know,

482
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,250
fairly complex things like
that. There's, you know, a,

483
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,430
a Predator above us and like,

484
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,010
well what I mean is they don't
have syntax. Right. You know,

485
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:15,520
and you kind of like wine up right now.
It's like the verdict's still out man.

486
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,580
There's some like animals do convey some
complicated stuff and bace brothers or

487
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,690
cologists you know like phd scientists
and they kind of hate the conversation,

488
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:29,100
you know, because they really
resist, not resistant to,

489
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,340
but they have a hard time with trying
to use our terminology and use our

490
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:37,870
language to describe what animals are
up to. Right. You know, like to say for,

491
00:28:37,871 --> 00:28:42,040
for you to say that the dolphin eats
the bay or doesn't want to eat the baby

492
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,700
because it might be his baby.

493
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Someone might argue that that animal
probably has no comprehension of that or

494
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:56,371
even that they are not able to
equate sex with reproduction.

495
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,893
Hmm.

496
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,720
They're so intelligent though. I don't
know how they wouldn't be able to equate.

497
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,140
I don't,
I don't either.

498
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,290
I don't think this all the time because
I really should have said killed.

499
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
They killed him. I don't, I
don't think they eat them.

500
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,600
They might say they really ran,
but they killed him. They bite him.

501
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,720
You know, I struggled this
stuff all the time because,

502
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,520
you know, as a hunter I'm always
weighing out like, well what is it like,

503
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:25,970
what are the things that we're after and
what are their capabilities? You know,

504
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,040
I don't want to fall into
some trap or I just act like,

505
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,460
oh that just like corn with
legs, you know. So I do,

506
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:36,350
I am curious all the time about the
capabilities of animals and I tend to be

507
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:37,820
open to the idea that there's,

508
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,360
there's like different sets of experiences
that different animals have. You know,

509
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,010
there's some have more, perhaps more
of an awareness than others. Yeah.

510
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,730
You know, there's like a,
there's a hierarchy if you will.

511
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,790
And I think that the consensus is
that dolphins are pretty high on that

512
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:55,624
hierarchy.

513
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,110
Yeah. Dolphins and Orcas, of course,
orchids are very high up on that. They,

514
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:02,300
and they eat dolphins.
That's what's really fucked up.

515
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,030
You know, I've been going through
some of my kid, man. He um,

516
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,680
we just moved to the Pacific northwest
and so I keep talking to them.

517
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:12,050
I kid about, everything's got a killer
whale on it, you know, like, like stores,

518
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:16,330
grocery stores, whatever. It just
like a common motif. And I'm like,

519
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,990
I would tell him that's a killer whale.
It's a killer whale.

520
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,200
And I know the lot of people like
to call them or it goes, you know,

521
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,120
in is some Greek word I think just
means Sateesh and just means whale.

522
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,560
It's a pretty generic term.

523
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:32,030
And some people say that killer whale
killer whales used to be called whale

524
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:35,750
killers and whale killer became killer
whale. So I'm always telling my kid,

525
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:36,584
all that's killer whale.

526
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,210
And one day my kid comes home and he
just madder than hell because he learned

527
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:44,780
that it's not a killer whale. It's ORC.
You know? And I'm like, listen man,

528
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:46,390
I know what I like.

529
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,880
I know what the person who told
you that is trying to tell you.

530
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,630
And I already know that,
but I told you killer whale,

531
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:57,620
not because I wasn't aware because I
was trying to circumvent, you know,

532
00:30:57,621 --> 00:30:58,454
I was trying to do,

533
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,260
to come back around against what you
would inevitably learn about it's PC name.

534
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,560
Uh, I say, you know, you
were planning in advance.

535
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,960
It wasn't that I didn't know.
I was just trying to fill you up with,

536
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:13,790
just to open you to the idea that,

537
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:17,480
that there's the animals get new
names all the time and it's just a PC.

538
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,320
It's like a, it's like a, um, what do
you call it? Like a marketing term? Yeah.

539
00:31:21,321 --> 00:31:24,950
Cause as a marketing term
scholar mean it's not a whale.

540
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,460
It's a tooth whale is it? But
a dolphins. A tooth. We'll too,

541
00:31:28,461 --> 00:31:31,580
because I thought,
pardon me?

542
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:35,030
I thought you were saying that someone
wasn't a mammal or something. Oh No, it's,

543
00:31:35,031 --> 00:31:37,580
it's a, it's a cousin of a dolphin.
Right? You know, I don't know,

544
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:40,730
like taxonomically where's it
at? I'd be, I'd be curious.

545
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,260
I'm pretty sure it's a no.

546
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:46,150
Yeah, because I'm pretty sure there's
a word crazy video of one keel.

547
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,600
They're killing a whale while it's alive.
These killer whales are behind.

548
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,220
That's how most killing happens.
Yeah. But I mean, it's, it's,

549
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,360
I should say they're eating
it while it's alive. Oh.

550
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,360
Fighting chunks of its face off.

551
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,230
And it's just so hard to watch because
we think of these whales as being these

552
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:02,160
beautiful creatures.

553
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:07,161
And we think of why we have this weird
idea of killer whales as being like these

554
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:09,360
really noble creatures.
You know?

555
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,540
Cause I always think of killer whales
as being like the friend of man.

556
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:15,110
And that's why when one
does freak out at seaworld,

557
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:19,200
it makes seaworld looks so horrible
because in the wild there's almost no

558
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:22,230
evidence whatsoever that whales have
ever killed anybody. But he's probably,

559
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,520
after awhile I was like, what
am I supposed to kill them?
Yeah, yeah. Exact killer.

560
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:30,570
Exactly. Whale. And the instincts that
they have, you know, I was, the way,

561
00:32:30,571 --> 00:32:31,261
I always equated,

562
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:34,740
one of the things I have a problem with
zoos in general is that they don't allow

563
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:38,430
animals to do their natural thing.
I really think that would zoos should be,

564
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,220
is get all motherfuckers together.

565
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:42,530
You should have a giant piece of
land of you gonna fence it in,

566
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,260
let them in there and let them run wild.

567
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,790
And if people really want to see animals,

568
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,240
what they should see is Jaguars
killing monkeys. And the whole goal,

569
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,740
the whole gamut and it sounds fucked up.
But that's really what the wild is.

570
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:58,160
Cause what we're doing by taking these
animals and putting them in these weird

571
00:32:58,161 --> 00:33:03,140
cages is we're creating these closed
in ecosystems where these animals never

572
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:07,070
have to compete there. Food is given to
them and we're ruining their genetics.

573
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,410
I mean those animals that are in zoos,

574
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,760
they're completely incapable of ever being
reintroduced into the wild unless you

575
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:14,594
take them.

576
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,690
And it would have to be some
really exhausting effort
to try to reintroduce them

577
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:23,360
to the idea of hunting their own food
or cat a gathering their own food.

578
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,640
But those fucking dummies
that you have in the zoo,

579
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,770
you've created these welfare monkeys,
these monkeys that just,

580
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,580
I shouldn't say welfare should say
like their pets. They're like dogs.

581
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,460
It's like expecting your dog to figure
out how to go hunting when he's just

582
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:40,550
sitting there wagging his tail,
waiting for you to open up a can of alto.

583
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,840
They don't know any better,

584
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,890
but what zoos using their defense and
you know some people we've kind of gotten

585
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:50,020
away from, a lot of people have
gotten away from aesthetically,

586
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:52,030
so like the bear in the
cage kind of display,

587
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,500
but what zoos are eyes able to use in
their defense is that with cases like the

588
00:33:56,501 --> 00:34:00,730
panda, Florida Panther, oh did
they have a genetic reserve? Right.

589
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,290
So maybe they're not,

590
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,930
maybe they're not insuring behavior.

591
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,700
They're not like protecting behavior,

592
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:12,400
but they're at least protecting
like the genetic reserve. Yeah.

593
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,290
Shit hit the fan for some species
you have that. And there's many,

594
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:21,040
many examples of things that you know
of wild populations that had been

595
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:25,960
supplemented through the zoo stuff.
But I know what you're saying.

596
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,650
Like I don't like I,
when I take my kid to a zoo,

597
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,280
I remember we were sitting
there looking at this like,

598
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,680
I mean just the pathetic example of a,
of a grizzly bear.

599
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,220
I remember just kind of wanting to look
at my son and be like, listen dude,

600
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,790
you're getting the wrong idea. These
things are bad ass normally, you know,

601
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,260
it's just kind of sad.

602
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,910
Have you seen that show,
the hunt that I told you about?

603
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,270
No. No, I didn't see it, but I remember
you talking about it pretty interesting.

604
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:53,510
I don't think I write about it after you
showed it after you told me about it,

605
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,380
because the guy from Metallica was
narrating it and then he got, he,

606
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,780
their band got punished
and weren't allowed to

607
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,650
play at a music festival. They were
trying to ban them. I don't take it.

608
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,170
What the fuck is this? Because he
narrated a show. James Hetfield. Yeah,

609
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:12,910
he's a good narrator. It's interesting.
And he's a hunter. He hunts a lot and uh,

610
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,720
there's a photo of him with his
fucking giant pair. Holy Shit. I mean,

611
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:19,180
it's a perspective shot, you know,
they always put the bear. Yeah,

612
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:22,400
we getting way back. But, but
this fucking bear is huge. I mean,

613
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:24,220
it's like a nine foot bear.
It's enormous.

614
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,630
Is it just the shoulders on this fucking
thing and the head on this thing,

615
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:32,500
it's just this and he's standing in front
of people like, Oh my God, disgusting.

616
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Evil. But they don't understand
is if you truly love bears,

617
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,010
you got to kill that bear
because if you don't kill

618
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,210
that bear that bear,

619
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:43,410
those big giant bears are responsible
for decimating the population of cubs.

620
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,100
That's what they do.
And if you don't trim the big ones,

621
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,350
if you don't kill some of the big ones,
there's a photo of him with the bear.

622
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,480
I mean data is a fucking big, where
was that? Was that Cody? Kodiak?

623
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:58,470
Kodiak, yeah. He shot went up there
while he was doing that show. Apparently.

624
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,860
I mean they are enormous and you might
see like someone might see that you

625
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:08,760
killed a big male bear and,
and be upset by it,

626
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,870
but you're really not
impacting the bear population.

627
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:13,830
You know,

628
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:18,270
you're impacting that individual bear
but you're not having any kind of real

629
00:36:18,271 --> 00:36:22,960
longterm deleterious effect on the bears
of the island, which are very, you know,

630
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,670
it's a very stable, well-regulated
population of bears out there.

631
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,250
I put it in for that tag.
I think as a non guided nonresident.

632
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,930
So like if you're wanting to go with the
guide, you can go to Kodiak and haunt,

633
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,180
you know,
you just go book a trip and go.

634
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,100
So you just have to pay them and they
have a certain amount of tax. They it's,

635
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,510
I don't know what it is,
you might pay 25 30 grand for the hunt.

636
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,990
It's interesting watching it but non
guided non resident that's always put in

637
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:49,420
for it. There's a very limited number
of tags for non guided nonresident,

638
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,440
which mean that I would have
to go in lieu of a guide.

639
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:57,930
I get her like, because my
brother is a resident of Alaska,

640
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,920
I don't need to use a guide when hunting
animals that you normally need the

641
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,530
guide to hunt.
So I can go with him and hunt there.

642
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:08,790
And so every other year they do a thing
where you can apply for the spring hunt.

643
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,260
I always put in for that hunt and then
when you're talking about that show,

644
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,450
I was bummed because I was like,

645
00:37:15,451 --> 00:37:19,230
now the odds of drawing that
tag are probably gonna for
a long time. Go Way, way,

646
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:22,380
way down because it's probably gonna be
a ton of dudes putting in for the permit

647
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:24,030
now. Yeah, it could be wrong.

648
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,210
Probably like it's going to increase
interest and now I'm like trying to think

649
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:32,190
of a new place to start putting in. I've
never killed a grizzly bear. I want to,

650
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:34,020
I really wanted to one time.
Well,

651
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:37,440
you also have a weird thing where you
want a grizzly bear to scratch your chest

652
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:38,340
and leave scars.

653
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,770
Why would you say it meant a lot
more than me when I was single?

654
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,140
That just seems like one of
the worst requests. However,

655
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,480
like a fucking giant bay. I mean, what
did, what is a full grown grizzly way?

656
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,760
What's the way? I mean, there's a magical
number that gets thrown around a lot.

657
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,680
It's like when people were on, when
people want to say that a bear was huge,

658
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,280
they say it was a thousand pounds.
Right?

659
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,880
But those I guess are like,

660
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,230
if you put a lot of thousand pound bears
on a scale there, 800 pounds. Okay,

661
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,750
there's 750 pounds, a hundred
pounds. You know, again at Tony,

662
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,710
Russ got it that wrote those
books I was talking about has a,

663
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,950
he's at an immense amount of experience
and he kind of has a passage in there

664
00:38:22,951 --> 00:38:26,640
where he talks about like the thousand
pound bear and there just aren't a lot of

665
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:30,870
them out there is as much as you read
people getting like 10 foot thousand pound

666
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:31,840
bears, you, you,

667
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,320
you and I laughed about this before
because everyone that sees a mountain lion

668
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:36,154
in the wild

669
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,750
always says, um, big fucking
bore, you know, 200 pound boar.

670
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:42,341
And I remember like,

671
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:45,820
I laugh because you saw a lion and you
said it look like a small one. I was like,

672
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:49,030
you're the first guy I've ever met
the sauce, small y. I see two of them.

673
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:52,900
They were both around the same weight.
The first one I saw was like a dog size.

674
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:57,280
It's like 60, 70 pounds. And the second
one, it was a much quicker view of them.

675
00:38:57,281 --> 00:39:00,400
But again, I thought it was a
coyote until I saw its tail.

676
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,150
And then I noticed it had this big
bouncy tale. It was in Santa Barbara.

677
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,660
I was in Monosito driving through a
residential neighborhood and were like,

678
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,530
my wife said it was so afraid.
She goes, coyote and I go,
Oh Shit, look at its tail.

679
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,760
And we're like, that's a
mountain lion. It was like,

680
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:16,060
so it was like in that time
we saw it in the headlights,

681
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,710
couldn't have been more than 70 pounds.

682
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:21,360
You're discerning individual did
not have seen a 200 pound towns,

683
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,440
so there's the thousand pound bear,
but that that bear,

684
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:26,600
we're just looking at it as it is a huge
variable. I don't know what he, well,

685
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,640
did you see that video that's been
going around lately of a bear that was

686
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:34,300
walking around on two legs and
people were saying, is this big foot?

687
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,410
Is this what people are seeing?

688
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,790
Because it's absolutely a black bear
and this bear just for whatever reason

689
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:43,630
that's a size to get around. He walked
like a long distance on two legs.

690
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,780
It gets a crazy video.
Pull that video up Jamie,

691
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,920
because it's the one in the
neighborhood, right? Yeah. Yeah.

692
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:53,080
It's like walking in this like suburban
neighborhood and his fucking bear.

693
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:57,500
He's on two legs, like a dude in a
bear outfit like Yogi. Really? Yeah,

694
00:39:57,501 --> 00:40:00,370
and I mean he walks 30 40 yards like this.

695
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,610
So if you were in the woods and you
saw this bear doing that, he'd be like,

696
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,410
I saw a fucking Sasquatch. I know what
I saw. Especially if it was like dusk.

697
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,020
You know, look at this bear. Look at
him. You got to be kidding me. No,

698
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:13,000
check them out man.
Pull it.

699
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,970
Pull it from the beginning so we
could see the whole thing. ABC News.

700
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:22,750
Look at this. Oh yeah man. I mean
if you didn't know any better,

701
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:24,880
especially if it's thick
woods and you saw that thing,

702
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,440
you would fucking swear that that's the,
the shots you're looking at,

703
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:34,360
right there are often about, as long
as you see a bear. Yeah, look at him.

704
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,850
Look at that. Look at that.
That is fucking crazy.

705
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,950
That's pretty wild that you
like to get around like that.

706
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,640
You would assume that that is a monkey.
That's an ape.

707
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,240
That's a fucking bear.
No.

708
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,900
Does he have a normal gait when
he does get down on all fours?

709
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,310
He screwed up some who's
running? Oh, he was,

710
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,630
you saw him run on all four paws
or injured. Oh, his paws injured.

711
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:00,880
Or you might've got trap.
No, no, no, not both.

712
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,730
Pause. Just like, right Paul.
It looks like he's right.

713
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:07,300
Pause one states in New Jersey.
Yeah.

714
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,120
I mean if he got caught in a trap is
because someone illegally set, mm.

715
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,380
I don't think that's the car.
I mean you can't trap bears in New Jersey,

716
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:18,970
but just the fact that a bear has that
ability, I can trap it all in New Jersey.

717
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,500
I don't know if there's some fur trapping
there, but I don't know to what extent,

718
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:24,650
but there's no bear trapping there.

719
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,250
It isn't impossible that he got caught
in another animal's trap and that's how

720
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,170
he's still alive because he only ever law.

721
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,310
There's no trap that would
be used for bearing animals

722
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,160
now that would cripple that thing
to the point where he would do that.

723
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,760
If he got caught and a
foothold trap or leg old trap,

724
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:45,050
he would pop his foot out of there.
Really? I mean, I can't, like,

725
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,840
I can't rule out everything.
If that's what happened to that bear.

726
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,070
And I have no reason to think
that it is. Um, if that,

727
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,260
if like if someone came down and said,

728
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,820
absolutely that's what happened
to that bear, I'd be like,

729
00:41:55,821 --> 00:42:00,260
then someone was doing like an illegal
trapping active because that's not

730
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,480
something that would happen.
Is it much more likely she,

731
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,980
cause we were looking at a resident
like clap do it on something,

732
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,100
but I could put my ice to
do this when I used to trap,

733
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:09,800
I used to do this all time is you know,

734
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,630
I can snap my hand in most traps really
now cause the tramp has more of a

735
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:16,340
function of,
I mean this is going to get all,

736
00:42:16,341 --> 00:42:18,470
you're going to probably hear
from all kinds of your listeners,

737
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:22,790
but it has a holding function.
So it starves to death.

738
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:28,130
No, not, not if you're, no, because
you have to check your traps.

739
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,610
Oh, so you go there and it's still
alive. Then you have to kill it. Yeah.

740
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,370
So when I suffered trip,
I would check my traps every 24 hours,

741
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,710
usually in the morning,
you know. But anyways,

742
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:41,711
what the trap large serves to do is
hold something and the way when you rig

743
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:46,190
them, if you do things right, okay,

744
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,520
you ring them with a lot of swivels and
things and so what you're trying to do

745
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:54,521
is really limit any kind
of damage to the animal.

746
00:42:55,161 --> 00:42:56,630
And this isn't altruistic.

747
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:00,500
The reason you want to limit damage to
the animal is the animals less likely to

748
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:03,950
fight the trap. Okay. If
you have a trap that causes,

749
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,570
that causes nerve damage,
bone damage, numbing,

750
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,410
okay.

751
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,160
It's all the more chances that that thing
is going to be working harder to get

752
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:16,940
away and to thinking is that in the ideal
case, you're just trying to hold it.

753
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:21,990
We're the foothold trap. So in what you're
thinking does everybody, they, yeah,

754
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,970
people want to say chew, but what they
will do, and I've, you know, I have,

755
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,300
I've seen it happen, particularly
the Muskrat's which have
very, very thin bones.

756
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:33,680
There's one only has one. Paul wonder
what happened to him? Where's that?

757
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:37,370
I have no idea. I just typed in
bear trap. That's hog service.

758
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,650
What do you think happened there?
Well that's,

759
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,960
that's too high on his leg
to be a trap. Yeah. So you,

760
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:46,220
maybe that's a shot,
a gunshot or something like that.

761
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:48,260
Then he could have gotten shot.
He could've got shot.

762
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:52,700
He could've got hit by a car. He
could've got gotten. I mean, you know,

763
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:57,590
I mean things we meet such
weird ends and injuries.

764
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,190
I've seen bears it, I'm fairly
convinced on Prince of Wales Island,

765
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,240
I've seen bears that I'm fairly convinced
had been shot just because of the sort

766
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:07,670
of like where on the shoulder
it happened, you know? Right.

767
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:10,160
Like it looked like someone look like,
I just be like,

768
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:12,740
I could picture how that would happen.
I can't say that that didn't happen there,

769
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:15,800
but I wouldn't, that's not a trap thing.
What I asked you with muskrats anyways,

770
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,090
most guys have very,
very,

771
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:21,890
very thin bones and you'll see where
you'd get must grass. It would,

772
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,040
in trapper parlance,
they'll say it would ring out.

773
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,870
So we'll just twist and get away, you
know. Oh, okay. So it just keeps spinning.

774
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:31,860
And so people say like a chew out,

775
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,130
but it's weird because people
who people defending trapping,

776
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:40,090
we'll like to clarify this. Not
actually chew off. It's a ring on,

777
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,240
but they're still cutting
their own arm off. Yeah,

778
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,760
I spinning around until the tissue.
I never saw it. I saw it on,

779
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,980
um, Muskrat's I never
saw it on larger animals.

780
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,680
I know, I'm not saying that it
doesn't happen, but again, like,

781
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:03,740
like everything, there's a, there's a
sort of, there's good practices. Okay.

782
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,180
I don't travel anymore so I'm not,
I don't have like, uh, when I,

783
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,270
when I tell you what I'm telling you,

784
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:12,740
I'm just telling you this from being a
guy who likes to be clear about factual

785
00:45:12,741 --> 00:45:16,010
matters. I'm not, I don't have like
a real dog in the race on this,

786
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,250
so to speak right now.
But when,

787
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,390
if you follow good practices on trapping,
okay.

788
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,680
You, it's in your best interest to not
have these sorts of things happen that you

789
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:33,480
would set in away that you don't
have incidental catches for bycatch.

790
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,860
Right. You check your traps on
a very tight schedule. You know,

791
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,320
you read them in such a way
that you don't cause damage,

792
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,180
that if you did get something
else into your trap,

793
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:47,100
you would be able to release that thing
unharmed. But there are people who,

794
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,840
for lack of caring and there are people
who just for lack of technical expertise,

795
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,060
screw these things up.
You know,

796
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,440
and oftentimes you could get violations
like what would be like a trapping based

797
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:02,970
violation from someone who wouldn't self
identify as a fur trapper but who just

798
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:07,971
got mad about some bear or
whatever getting into his
dumpster and then he takes

799
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:11,370
matters into his own hands completely
outside of the law and decides to like fix

800
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:15,530
that bear and an expert lease at
a trap for it. You know, delve,

801
00:46:15,531 --> 00:46:17,650
there are bear traps right though.
Chaps,

802
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,930
you seen those movies at catch the bad guy
in his leg and he's screaming, ah, Yup.

803
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,550
Those are real. Those are, I mean there,

804
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,850
there used to be a lot of
black bear trapping, you know,

805
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,500
people use trap blackberries all the time.

806
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,960
There used to be some
grizzly trapping at a time.

807
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:35,920
People would trap them to sell for, they
trap them to get them for, you know,

808
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,440
scientific purposes.
They,

809
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,480
they'd trap them to just catch them for
pets they trap and to mitigate livestock

810
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:45,870
risk. You know, there's a lot
of traveling going on right now.

811
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,810
Bear trapping. Um, [inaudible]
isn't a thing that goes out.

812
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,810
There's not like there's a bear
trap went there. Yeah. Yeah.

813
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,530
And what's funny now is that there
used to be a lot of bear traps,

814
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:01,220
antique bear chaps on the market,
but people still manufacturer.

815
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,133
What would,

816
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:07,970
what would be a bear trap in order to
sell it as a like as a piece of memory?

817
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,780
Like a false memorabilia. Oh,
like a Flint lock gun. Exactly.

818
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,610
So there's a lot of guys that make re
like reproductions of old bear traps.

819
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:17,900
There's no like,

820
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,570
no one's like intending that they're
going to go set it for a bear.

821
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,580
But people want to have like a lodge.
You know,

822
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:25,250
you've got like your cabin and you wanna
have a big bear trap hanging up in it,

823
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,760
right? So there's a lot of bear traps and
you'll see where a doodle think he has

824
00:47:28,761 --> 00:47:29,990
something,
you know

825
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,560
when he's trying to sell it for 1000
bucks and you look at and be like,

826
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,240
you could go buy those all day long
for $150. It just like, it's not old.

827
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:41,020
There's a comedy club in town called the
Improv and the front of the Comedy Club

828
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:43,690
at one time they've abandoned it,

829
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:46,000
but it was a barbecue place
and the barbecue place,

830
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:50,770
they tried to make it like with old
tools and the wall like an old saw,

831
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,350
like you know those
wooden handle on each side

832
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,880
and you could look at it and you're like,
I know that shit. It's two years old.

833
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,550
Like I'm looking at,
it's all rusty and everything,

834
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:02,350
but I know this is not a fucking antique.

835
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:06,450
They had a one of those sickles that you
know, like the, the death dealer that uh,

836
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,200
w, what do they call it?
The depth grim reaper.

837
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:11,290
Grim reaper is always supposed to
have that was on the wall to it.

838
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,980
Trying to make it like some
farm. Oh yeah. Old timey.

839
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,400
Old timey wood walls, like
a stain, you know, like uh,

840
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,670
like they made it look like it's old
and weathered, you know the wood,

841
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,580
which summit mean? This is actually
from 100 year old farm house.

842
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:28,620
The wood that we have here. This is
reclaimed oak. This is nice. Yeah.

843
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:34,110
I specifically went out of the way to get
old would cause I felt like it be kind

844
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:35,350
of cool,
you know,

845
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:39,700
because it's probably some weird
energy in some old farm would.

846
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,250
And this is like real old thick wood.
Oh yeah. No, I like it. I have the,

847
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:49,030
me and my old man cut down. He's dead
now. But when I was in high school,

848
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:52,600
he was building a pole
barn and we cut down oak

849
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,130
on this piece of property we owned
across the road from our house.

850
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,300
It's the little corner lot.
And we cut down to,

851
00:48:59,301 --> 00:49:03,310
oh he built the barn and
I took that. Oh, the logs.

852
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:06,910
And I took them down and put them on
a flatbed trailer and had a milled in

853
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:11,170
lumber. Oh Wow. And it took
all that lumber and years
later he's been dead since.

854
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:13,930
I think 2002 2003 I still
haven't finished this,

855
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,800
but then I laminated all those pieces
together and to like what looks like

856
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,200
chunks of Bowling Lane.
Ah,

857
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:23,860
I'm still trying to make a damn desk
out of these things. Oh Wow. It's like,

858
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,170
and I'm actively engaged right now.

859
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:30,970
I'm trying to move one of these slabs
from miles city out to Washington now so I

860
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:35,260
can continue my now 12 year long project
or trying to turn me in the old man's

861
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:38,080
tree. So anyways, I'm, I'm a
sentimentalist when it comes to wood,

862
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:40,960
just like yourself. Oh, that's cool. So
you're going to make it like writing desk,

863
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,520
like where you do your writing?
I think so.

864
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:46,420
I think I'm gonna make a ramp around
us. Gal. That's a great idea. Yeah.

865
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,120
But all the pieces I have together on
his biggest, his desk or sitting at,

866
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,980
but it's still a nice big chunk.

867
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:55,900
I have a desk that I bought in 1993 it's
a writing desk and it's got two levels,

868
00:49:55,901 --> 00:49:59,850
like one level. It's a very,
it's old, it's oak, you know,

869
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,370
but it's like there was a place called
the writer's store and it was a store in

870
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:07,150
Hollywood that was just all writing stuff
needs to have like script programs for

871
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,360
old school Max.
Like you know the oldest computing muses,

872
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,020
1994 that I got this fucking thing and
I've written everything I've ever written

873
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:17,680
on this one desk still. No. Yeah, I won't.
I will ever get rid of it. My wife's like,

874
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,870
let's get rid of this piece of shit.
I'm like, get the fuck Outta here.

875
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:24,200
This does desk going nowhere. It's solid
as a rock. It's all oak, but it's just,

876
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,070
there's stains on it. She said it's
disgusting. Got like coffee. Yeah,

877
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,280
yeah, yeah, yeah. This shit's perfect.
Like as long as it's in my office,

878
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,580
you fucking leave it. He has got the
Patina of your a sweat and labor.

879
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:38,900
Everything good I've ever
written is all from that desk.

880
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:42,140
This is one desk I've had and
I'm never getting rid of it.

881
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:47,330
I've just got this one oak desk that I've
had from the beginning of my time here

882
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:50,030
in La and I'll never get rid of that.
Fuck. So when you say that you've written,

883
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:55,160
do you sit down and write? Yes.
Stand up. Well, I sit down and write,

884
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,500
this is what I do.
Most of the time I write,

885
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:02,360
like I used to keep an active
blog on my website, but um,

886
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,740
when I started writing a book,

887
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,170
I got a book deal a few years
back and I started writing a book.

888
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:09,440
I stopped writing the blog and then when,
uh,

889
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,020
the publishers were
just fucking trying to,

890
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,750
they were essentially trying to
get me to write it, like, stand up.

891
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,090
I remember you talking about, yeah.
So I gave them their money back.

892
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:19,880
What'd you fell like? Doesn't work
for a book. Well, I don't like it.

893
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,880
Like I've read,
I've read like George Carlin's book,

894
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:25,700
which is essentially just his stand up in,
in book form.

895
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:29,390
And Jerry Seinfeld did a similar thing.
I don't like that. I, if I'm gonna,

896
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,780
if I want George Carlin's writing
like that, I want to see it.

897
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,330
I want to see George Carlin do is to,
I don't want to read it.

898
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:39,770
And then there's some benefit I guess
and breeding it. There's some, it's good,

899
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:43,700
it's better than nothing, but it's
not as good as when I, when I write,

900
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:46,760
I'm writing stuff because I know
people are going to read it, you know?

901
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:50,180
So the descriptive, a very different, the
way it's spaced out is very different.

902
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:53,780
The way I set things up
is different. And so, um,

903
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:58,810
what I do now is I write as if I was
going to write a book or a blog entry and

904
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:04,280
then I go over it and then I extract
ideas that come out of that because I feel

905
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:07,550
like I do both.
Like I'll write down specifically,

906
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:12,020
I'll try to write as a joke, like thinking
I'm standing on stage and you know,

907
00:52:12,021 --> 00:52:15,920
set up punchline or beginning
premise and then add in the jokes.

908
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,150
But more often I just write
like I'll write about something.

909
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:23,420
And then along the way, usually
I'm baked. So it's, I get silly,

910
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,450
like as I'm writing,

911
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:28,160
like these new ideas will come in and
I'll just deal with characters and stuff.

912
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,730
No, no, no. Just writing as you were told
that sometimes you write as you talking.

913
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:35,330
Yeah, I right. Not even as me talking,

914
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:40,180
I just write like I'll
write like, uh, like,

915
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,370
uh, pick a subject like, um,

916
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,650
whatever amphetamines,
pissed speed, you know,

917
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:52,970
Adderall and I'll start writing about
Adderall. And then along the way,

918
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,103
you know,

919
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:58,040
I'll have like a really funny thing
will come up in the writing or like,

920
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:01,280
like I'm laughing as I'm writing it
because it just came out of nowhere.

921
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,100
Did you feel like you're a really
good writer, Matt, by the way?

922
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:09,050
I really loved mediator, so
really good book. Oh, thanks
man. It's a, and it was, uh,

923
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:13,820
I mean, I knew you're a smart dude and
you're, you're obviously very articulate,

924
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:17,750
but the writing was very, it's very
descriptive. It's very interesting.

925
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:22,180
It's very fun to follow. And when you, um,

926
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,910
when you write stuff like that,
don't you feel like sometimes,

927
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,170
like as you're writing,

928
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,890
like it's almost like it's not even you
that's writing like these ideas just

929
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:33,390
sorta like pop into your head,

930
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:35,430
like out of nowhere and then
you're putting them down?

931
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:38,790
No. Um, um, for me,

932
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:44,180
I'm so aware of the process that
there's no surprising thing to me.

933
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:47,430
One of my mentors and what,

934
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:52,431
like what I regard as one of the best
American nonfiction writers out there

935
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:57,300
alive now as a, as a writer named
Ian Frazier. And what's his work?

936
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:02,040
He's got several books. One of the
books I hold, it was just like,

937
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:03,420
you're one of the,
in my opinion,

938
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:06,990
one of the finest books ever written as
his book. Great Plains, great plains,

939
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:12,030
which is about the great plains. Um,
but he's, he's a stylist, you know,

940
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,560
he's also a, he was a humor writer for
the New Yorker for a long time. It was,

941
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:21,510
I had great fortune to, you know,
he, he know if he would use his term,

942
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,600
I think he'd like
mentored me in somewhere.

943
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,610
I read his stuff and had the opportunity
to hang out with him a handful of times.

944
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:31,110
And then he was saying that when he was
growing up and you wanted to be a writer,

945
00:54:31,111 --> 00:54:35,460
he pictured the writers would be that
you're sitting at a desk kind of chuckling

946
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,410
to yourself as you, you know,
have all these fantastic ideas.

947
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,060
But when I write,

948
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:47,061
I get so few words written every day
and every sentence that I write takes,

949
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:51,750
I have to write it and rewrite it and
rewrite it so many times that there's

950
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:56,610
never a thing where I feel like, um,
there's never a thing where I feel like,

951
00:54:56,611 --> 00:55:01,260
holy smokes, I nailed it
because it's, it's, so,

952
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,650
I almost look at it like if
you're building a house, you know,

953
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,800
maybe when you get all done with the
house, you can stand outside and be like,

954
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:10,560
wow, there it is. I did it
right. But there's never,

955
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,600
there's never a shocking moment because
every nail and every board, you know,

956
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,590
there's never a chance for where
something jumps ahead radically,

957
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:22,920
really quickly in a way they
can start with you. Now,

958
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,500
the other night I wrote my brother's
getting married this weekend.

959
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:30,420
My older brother and I sat down
to to make some notes about,

960
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,480
um, I'm gonna, you know,

961
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:37,080
my best man speech right after
I wrote my best man's speech.

962
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,420
It's funny because this just happened to
me last night after I did my best man's

963
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:46,080
speech. I felt like, why can't I
feel like I had it where I got,

964
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:48,900
I was like talking about some funny
stuff in my head and kind of writing down

965
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:51,990
notes and I thought of some way to
actually like you're supposed to doing the

966
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:54,480
best man speech is you're supposed
to make it like hit right?

967
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,620
Like hit the right note.

968
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,010
It's funny and your dog and on them
and then all of a sudden you turn it,

969
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,920
you know, and it's sweet and nice. Okay.

970
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:06,810
And I found that turn to make
it sweet and nice and it's so,

971
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:09,750
and it just struck me as being like
perfect, you know? And I was like,

972
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:13,140
why can't the regular writing? I do
feel that way. That's interesting.

973
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:17,490
Where I'm like, Huh. You know, and I kind
of want to like pump my fist in the air.

974
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,420
Whether people that, you know, that our
writers have those moments with those,

975
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:24,190
those uh, those moments that I'm talking
about where things just pop to you.

976
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,850
I feel like they do. I, I, you know,

977
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:31,180
one of the things that I follow on
Twitter is this thing I'm John Winokur and

978
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:32,560
it's just,
I don't know how he does it,

979
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:36,220
but six or seven times a day he's got
quotes from great writers about writing.

980
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:41,920
How do you spell his name? J. O.
H. N. W. I. N. O man. John Winokur.

981
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,770
It's like writers on writing.

982
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:51,750
And I learned more about writing and
writers from reading this thing cause it's

983
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,040
like really cool writers talking
about the writing process.

984
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:58,690
I'm sure he's probably hit one just
within minutes. Oh, at advice to writers,

985
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:03,070
advice to writers had you, uh, like here
right now. Just it, it minutes ago. Um,

986
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,900
or a couple of hours ago when I write,

987
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:09,400
I don't think of the audience after the
fact. I think, well I hope they like it.

988
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:13,870
So that's like, oh, writer
talking about writing. Right.

989
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,690
And this Twitter feed hits
these quotes all day long.

990
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:18,250
So I learned more about writers,

991
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:19,840
even though I went to writing
school and everything,

992
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:23,410
I learned more about writers
following that guy's Twitter account.

993
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:27,340
And I do get that some writers are
blown away and have fun writing.

994
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,170
To me it's agonizing.
I can't stand it.

995
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:34,500
That's a weird thing about doing
TV is I love having written,

996
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,560
you know, when I write a book, I'm so,

997
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,760
it's just like a deep,
deep satisfaction. Okay.

998
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,790
I love having done it when I die,
if they will,

999
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:50,800
if they chisel writer into my tombstone,
you know, I, I'd be very happy. Right.

1000
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,210
But I hate the act of writing.
Make a TV is so fun.

1001
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,950
Just in the moment. It's very fun. I
love going out and doing it, you know?

1002
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,470
But when it's said and done,
I don't get that,

1003
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:06,070
that feeling like I slayed the dragon.

1004
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:10,720
Like I would get from writing a book.
I know exactly what you're talking about.

1005
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,960
You know, you're, when you're
doing a television show also,

1006
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:15,820
it's very different than most TV.

1007
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:19,390
And that you're out there doing
something you enjoy anyway. Exactly.

1008
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:23,740
And there's a lot of people coming in on
it. So writing is like me. I mean sure.

1009
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:27,370
You know you have it. I don't mean to in
any way discount the role of an editor.

1010
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,430
And I don't know if you do
something similar with your standup,

1011
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,050
you show other comedians and stuff,
but you have like a role of an editor.

1012
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:35,350
So I don't want to act like, oh, it's
just all out of your head. You know,

1013
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:39,550
my agent I work closely with, he
influences things. I do my header,

1014
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,760
but, and yet it's kind of,
it's your thing, right?

1015
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:46,480
TV's a whole bunch of people so you could
go out and have a great thing and then

1016
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,970
you turn it in and the,
and the editor nails it.

1017
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,950
So I can't go like I made this amazing
TV show because it's like there's the guy

1018
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,250
that produced it, the guys that
shot the guys edited it, right.

1019
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:58,150
All that kind of stuff.

1020
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:00,640
And so you're a sense of ownership
becomes a little bit different.

1021
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:05,320
You're like a stake holder and not
like the dude that owns the thing.

1022
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,430
Yeah. There's so much going on. There's
music, there's the way it's edited.

1023
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,750
Oh extremely.

1024
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,760
It really has a massive impact on how
it comes off as a, as a piece. Yeah.

1025
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:19,810
I think like as a host, you know, as
a host and as a person who has like a,

1026
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:24,590
a lot of sway in the kinds of things we
go do, I still feel like I'm, you know,

1027
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:29,240
I'm kicking in 10 or 20% and 80 90% is,

1028
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,140
you know, a handful of other
people who are throwing in on it.

1029
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,500
Nobody works harder than
people who work on your show.

1030
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:41,770
Like those kinds of dudes like Doty
and Mo and all those guys who have to

1031
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:46,120
fucking sleep in tents and in the back
of that fucking van where the lamas

1032
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:50,240
pissed and
I really kind of love it.

1033
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:53,690
I love those guys was fine. We just
had this guy, we wound up liking him.

1034
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:59,540
We had a camera guy to come out with us
for the first time and then he was just

1035
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:02,250
getting beat up. I mean, it'd
be he admitted it, you know,

1036
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,080
and it kind of became the joke where he's
saying the Dougherty, he's like, man,

1037
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:11,081
you guys gotta do a better job
of explaining what this is.

1038
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,160
And Dan's like, I feel like I said,
it's like rigorous hiking, you know?

1039
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,980
And he's like, yeah, but
like that's not this.

1040
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:22,340
I thought like walking on a trail
or something, you know, it's like,

1041
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:26,090
but there's no language to explain it.
I don't know why those guys,

1042
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,790
well I do know why I think
one could look and be like,

1043
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:33,791
I don't understand why those guys would
subject themselves to that right level

1044
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:35,330
of treatment.

1045
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:39,020
Because I've had the opportunity to
work very briefly in what would be like

1046
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:42,560
network television, mainstream
television. And I'm telling you what,

1047
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,920
that's not typical.
What you do,

1048
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:50,390
what those guys do and the
hours they do it is not typical.

1049
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,710
Not at all.
No.

1050
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,640
I was shocked here like one time some
guy was coming out with us and I knew it

1051
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:56,840
was gonna be trouble because
he's come out of this.

1052
01:00:56,841 --> 01:01:00,460
He's asking about what the hours are. And
I'm like, I don't know. I think, you know,

1053
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:01,850
we usually we'll sleep at night

1054
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,200
24 hours a day or that hours.
It's like,

1055
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:09,680
what do you mean when you're sleeping
on the ground in Montana and it's zero

1056
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:12,410
degrees outside and you're
fucking huddled up in your tent,

1057
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,940
you're kind of working,

1058
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:17,780
still owe it because you would never be
there unless they were paying you to be

1059
01:01:17,781 --> 01:01:20,690
there. Like even though
you're off, we'd still,

1060
01:01:20,691 --> 01:01:24,590
you're subjecting yourself to sleeping
on the ground in Montana in a tent and

1061
01:01:24,591 --> 01:01:26,780
you're freezing your dick off.
You know,

1062
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:30,680
like you have to like flex and squeeze
under your sleeping bag to degenerate

1063
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:34,060
some warm before he can pass out.
You're kind of working. Yeah. Like that.

1064
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:38,300
Like Dougherty Yanis Mo. I, they just,

1065
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:40,030
okay.

1066
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,420
Uh, they just, they like to be in some
way tortured a little bit, I think.

1067
01:01:43,421 --> 01:01:47,770
And they also just like to be working, you
know, I don't, I don't think that they,

1068
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:51,520
but the other thing is, I don't
think they really, they're at work,

1069
01:01:51,521 --> 01:01:53,650
but I don't know how much they
think about being at work.

1070
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:59,360
I see what you're saying. I think they
just think of it as like existing, whoa,

1071
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,490
Jimmy. I don't think they go
like, oh no, I'm going to work.

1072
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,070
I think that they think of their
lives more. Their lives don't seem to,

1073
01:02:05,071 --> 01:02:07,620
I don't think they think of their
lives and having like, it's like, no,

1074
01:02:07,621 --> 01:02:09,690
I'm at work now. I'm at home
now, I'm at work now I'm at home.

1075
01:02:09,691 --> 01:02:13,610
I think like at home they're thinking
about work stuff and uh, okay.

1076
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,560
Do you know what I mean? I feel like more
there that they don't look at it like,

1077
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:20,220
you know, punching the old clock is
my guess. They of, well it was funny

1078
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,730
cause Mo and I had a conversation once
about another show that he was working on

1079
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:26,640
and one of the guys that was
on the other show and uh,

1080
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:31,320
he was taking great pride in
describing what a coward this guy was.

1081
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:35,190
And it was, it was not even great pride,
but he was enjoying it. He's like,

1082
01:02:35,191 --> 01:02:39,990
he's yellow. He was talking
about it, but it was like,

1083
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,740
here's a guy that's been working on
your show for several seasons and he's

1084
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:48,510
fucking undergone some
horrendous locations and
climbing to the top of fucking

1085
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:52,110
mountains while carrying a 50 pound
camera and the whole deal. I mean,

1086
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:55,800
these fucking cameras are no joke.
And hiking, just carrying a gun,

1087
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:59,910
hiking is difficult because all it's
sliding of the ground underneath you and

1088
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:02,690
you're constantly going up,
up, up, and you're, you know,

1089
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:06,210
essentially like you're doing like
little mini squats all day long and it's

1090
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:07,050
exhausting.

1091
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:11,100
And these guys are doing it with one
arm holding a fucking camera backwards,

1092
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:14,370
backwards. Like a little joke about
ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, you know,

1093
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:19,280
like she did everything Fred
Astaire did backwards. Right, right,

1094
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,080
right. Yeah. Most too
good though, man. Like,

1095
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,920
like we can't like most too
good, you know, he's like, oh,

1096
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:28,520
he's off doing other stuff.
You know, it was like a chain.

1097
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:32,500
It was like a treat to have him,
but he's always trying to win,

1098
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,860
but he's just in such demand,
you know what I mean? He's been,

1099
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:37,020
he's nominated for all these
enemies all the time. Yeah.

1100
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,380
He won an Emmy nominated
for an Emmy this year. Well,

1101
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:42,930
your show stands out at all.
I mean there's,

1102
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,600
there's hunting shows and then
there's your show. And the,

1103
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:49,200
the only show that I've seen
recently that does that as well.

1104
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:53,430
Have you seen uncharted, the Jim
Shockey show? No, but I know a lot of,

1105
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:57,610
I know his stuff. I haven't seen
that, but I know that, that,

1106
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,870
that show is a highly respected show.
It's really good.

1107
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,510
Her daughter was telling me,
he said, it's phenomenal.

1108
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:07,590
I watched it the other day for the first
time and he was often Pakistan and it

1109
01:04:07,591 --> 01:04:10,170
was really intense because one of the
guys that goes with them all the time,

1110
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,330
his wife didn't want him go to Pakistan.
I mean,

1111
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:16,110
she was like really scared and she was
like, you know, it's so dangerous there.

1112
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:20,610
Please don't go. He's got a wife and
kids. And so he stayed back and you know,

1113
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:24,360
Jim Shockey went by himself and they
followed the guy who stayed back going on

1114
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,610
this trip, um, to hunt deer.

1115
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:31,020
And when he went on this trip at
home in Texas to hunt deer, you know,

1116
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:36,021
he was talking about his dad and like
he the real scene crying and it was,

1117
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:42,390
it was really intense. It was very, very,
very intense. But in a way that you,

1118
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:44,880
you know, like a lot of those
shows are so fucking bad.

1119
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:49,500
Long before I got involved
in TV and outdoor TV,

1120
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:53,070
it was like a thing you would
always hear is friends of mine,

1121
01:04:53,071 --> 01:04:58,071
guys I respected would kind of be sort
of dismissing outdoor television as a

1122
01:04:58,831 --> 01:05:02,500
genre. But the thing was I was
like, but Shockey's legit or,

1123
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:06,540
or something or some such thing. I mean
he's been around for so long. Yeah.

1124
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,140
But he's a,

1125
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:10,480
he's a highly respect to figure it was
this annual thing called shot show and,

1126
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:13,760
and I see him, you can't miss them.
I mean the guy is huge and you know,

1127
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:16,850
he's Kinda like the last great
white hunter, you know, you know,

1128
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,490
cowboy hat all the time. I see
him and I want you to, you know,

1129
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:21,730
I always think I'm going to go up and
say something to them. I never had it.

1130
01:05:21,731 --> 01:05:26,080
Never had. Oh, I wouldn't, I would force
myself to not ever want to meet that guy.

1131
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,860
And there's, there's an
amazing thing. So, uh,

1132
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,300
I mean there's just some good
clips and stuff he's done and he's,

1133
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:35,600
he's an articulate guy and goes to
some cool places and he's, you know,

1134
01:05:35,601 --> 01:05:37,870
is you can tell his heart's in
the right place, man. I like,

1135
01:05:37,871 --> 01:05:42,490
I think he has an honest, you know,
he has an honest affection for,

1136
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:46,300
for wildlife and wild
places. For sure. For sure.

1137
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:48,850
You also enjoys the
roughing and aspect of it.

1138
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:54,240
Like he enjoys going to these ridiculous
remote locations and hunting these very

1139
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,220
odd animals is very exotic animals.

1140
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,980
He did something when they
flew into Russia and they,

1141
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:04,600
they took these fucking weird
SUV things. He's off. I mean,

1142
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:08,620
I shouldn't even say SUV,
these weird all terrain vehicles.

1143
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,750
It looked like these
military vehicles deep, deep,

1144
01:06:10,751 --> 01:06:14,980
deep in the mountains like 12 hour drive
and just see how he's been some wild

1145
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:19,180
places to get some fucking weird
ram, you know, it was just,

1146
01:06:19,181 --> 01:06:22,390
it was really intense.
It was unexpected.

1147
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,600
I just was flipping through the channels
and it came on and I'd seen his other

1148
01:06:25,601 --> 01:06:30,190
show before. So this uncharted thing,
I'd seen all these ads for it, but man,

1149
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:33,160
they were in Pakistan and they were,
they had armed guards with him every way.

1150
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:35,920
They went guys with Ak 47
[inaudible] and it was like,

1151
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:39,520
it was pretty intense because it's a
fucking dangerous, dangerous place.

1152
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:43,230
And he's out there wearing the
traditional Muslim garb he wears like the,

1153
01:06:43,231 --> 01:06:46,390
the clothes that those people
where you don't want to stand out,

1154
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,330
you don't want to stand
out as being a western guy.

1155
01:06:48,331 --> 01:06:50,050
He's like the Green Berets man.
Yeah.

1156
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:55,270
So he's wearing their outfits as he's
hunting. It's really intense and you know,

1157
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:57,190
they're off in the fucking middle of,

1158
01:06:57,191 --> 01:07:01,000
I mean deep in the middle of nowhere
hunting some ram. That's great. I'm glad.

1159
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:02,890
I'm glad you like that show
cause it's good to hear, uh,

1160
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,160
you know something out there that
caught your eye. It's really well done.

1161
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:09,010
It's really well done. But this is
like that show your show and then like,

1162
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:10,010
you know,
the rest of them are,

1163
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,350
there's some of them look like they're
made with like a home movie camera and

1164
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:18,100
it's like a guy who has never even
thought about making a show. Sometimes.

1165
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:19,300
That's true man.
There's a guy,

1166
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:23,150
there's a guy I was talking to who
makes the hunch show and one day we're

1167
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:26,560
talking and I was shocked
to hear that he's a,

1168
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:31,330
he's a registered nurse as a full
time job at a hospital. Whoa. And He,

1169
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:35,230
you know, he makes a hunting show. He
just burns it up man. And he's like, wow,

1170
01:07:35,231 --> 01:07:37,250
he's just something he wants to
do and he's just get double times.

1171
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:41,350
Just finds a way to make it happen.
It's fucking hard. Some of them too,

1172
01:07:41,351 --> 01:07:45,310
it's like there's some of them
that are the same show always,

1173
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,740
which is so bizarre. Yeah.
We, that's the thing,

1174
01:07:47,741 --> 01:07:50,230
we have a conversation about his is,
um,

1175
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:54,430
I wanted to go back and
in film next spring.

1176
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:59,170
Um, I have, uh, a black bear
permit for this regulatory year,

1177
01:07:59,171 --> 01:08:02,700
which extends in the next spring for
Prince of Wales. I wanted to go back and,

1178
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:07,630
and Doherty was saying it's like anything
that, you know, we did a show out there,

1179
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,550
interrupt the mountain story.

1180
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:14,110
We did a show out on Prince Wales last
spring and went and found a lot of bears

1181
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,100
and um, I, in the end I

1182
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,061
could have shot a bear.

1183
01:08:17,061 --> 01:08:21,890
I didn't because I just have this
strange feeling and sometimes not strange

1184
01:08:21,891 --> 01:08:24,300
sometimes doesn't want to watch
bears rather than shoot at them.

1185
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,960
So we did a show about that and

1186
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:28,720
okay.

1187
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,670
I wanted to go back this
spring and dirty was like,

1188
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:33,760
I just feel like anything we could have
done out there, we've done, you know,

1189
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,410
and then one and I'm
like, yeah, that's right.

1190
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:39,100
We probably shouldn't go and do a show
an episode in the same place doing the

1191
01:08:39,101 --> 01:08:43,270
same thing but then are having like
Bahamas cause some shows. All it is,

1192
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:48,520
they don't do anything but hunt there
like some lease they have for whitetail

1193
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:52,090
deer every single time. Yeah. Yeah.

1194
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:57,340
Show is looking at camera photos
from camera traps and them, you know,

1195
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,570
talking about the different stands that
they have set up and then them up in the

1196
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:04,440
stand with a bow and arrow waiting
for a fucking deer to come by. I mean,

1197
01:09:04,441 --> 01:09:08,490
that is every goddamn show. It's always
whitetail. It's always in a tree stand.

1198
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:12,150
It's always in the same sort of farmland
on the edges of these cornfields.

1199
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,280
And it's the same show
every God damn week.

1200
01:09:14,281 --> 01:09:18,570
And I guess people just like watching
people hunt deer. Do you enjoy it?

1201
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:22,710
I watch, I watch him, you know, every now
and then I like, you know, thinking like,

1202
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,640
Ooh, I wish I saw that deer and I was that
close. I'll shoot the shit out of that.

1203
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:30,540
Yeah. Like you'd learn a bunch
of stuff eventually watching
it. Yeah, he definitely

1204
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:31,041
learn stuff.

1205
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:34,700
You learn stuff about wind and placement
and the trails they walk and their

1206
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:36,770
behavior, like how they, you know,

1207
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,740
how they can kind of anticipate where
they're coming through and how to,

1208
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:44,420
how to pay attention to their trails. And
one of them, uh, well it was interesting.

1209
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,320
Uh, it was, uh,

1210
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:49,830
how to recognize the difference between
the doe trails and the buck trails.

1211
01:09:49,831 --> 01:09:50,720
So the doe trails,

1212
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:54,350
we're going straight across this like
this a riverbed area where there's a lot

1213
01:09:54,351 --> 01:09:58,850
of mud and you could see like these dose
that like large populations of animals

1214
01:09:58,851 --> 01:10:01,700
going this way and he's like, you see
these animals that are criss crossing?

1215
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:05,730
Those are, those are bucks catching the
scent and catching the sene of these.

1216
01:10:05,731 --> 01:10:05,850
Yeah.

1217
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:10,210
Does that, I hadn't heard that. Oh really?
Oh, that's interesting. That was subtle.

1218
01:10:10,211 --> 01:10:12,780
No, I don't know a ton about what
I mean. I grew up on white tails.

1219
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:14,020
We grew up hunting white tails,

1220
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:18,760
not probably using our heads as
much as we might have, you know.

1221
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:24,660
Well, the one, yeah, we got, we got deer.
Yeah. Yeah. The time we went. Right.

1222
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:28,570
Doug's farm in Wisconsin, man, my
fucking deer. They're everywhere.

1223
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:31,790
Yeah. It's crazy. And they're, you're
not playing. This is the distinction.

1224
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:33,300
Hours make in hunting is

1225
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:35,360
okay.

1226
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,360
I tried to find those places where you're
mostly thinking about animals and not

1227
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:43,740
so much thinking about hunters.
Well you

1228
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,290
just on that, on your show
too though, the difference,

1229
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:50,340
like the one time that you went and you
were elk hunting in Montana and you know,

1230
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:53,850
you were on your way after an elk and
you see another fucking hunter that's

1231
01:10:53,851 --> 01:10:54,684
doing the same thing,

1232
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:56,220
multiple everywhere.
Yeah.

1233
01:10:56,430 --> 01:11:00,300
So you spend most of your time wondering
about what other guys are doing and

1234
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:04,200
then trying to capitalize on that or
trying to anticipate the response of

1235
01:11:04,201 --> 01:11:06,540
animals to that pressure.
You know,

1236
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:11,670
I so much rather just be like in a one
on one thing next week we're going off to

1237
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,220
hunt Moose up in the Brooks

1238
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,740
range now and it's one of the,
you know, absolutely the most,

1239
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:20,580
one of the most remote places,
the most remote place in North America.

1240
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:24,840
And I'm up there. It's like
there's really no, you don't, I,

1241
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:28,260
you don't have to factor in
effects of other individuals.

1242
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:32,940
You're just thinking about the animals,
which is fun and it's very rewarding,

1243
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:35,100
but it's just not what
most people are up against.

1244
01:11:35,101 --> 01:11:39,600
Like when I was a kid and we're hunting
white tails, we really planned on,

1245
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:44,700
um, people, you know, it was very
important about where all their guys were,

1246
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:48,600
what other guys hunting
schedules was like, you know, um,

1247
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:51,270
there's certain guys we knew that,
you know,

1248
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:53,700
there's a guy we knew that
would always say like,

1249
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:58,680
if I see your guys' truck coming
down the driveway to the farm,

1250
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:03,060
I always go over to such and such place
because I know that the way you guys

1251
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:07,170
move into your blinds, your likely to
bump a deer down such and such fence line.

1252
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,400
So this guy's thinking about deer shirt.

1253
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:13,530
He's thinking about it through the
context of, of human activities.

1254
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,110
So dear being scared by you.
And he's like,

1255
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:18,090
you guys got that blind down in that area.

1256
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:20,880
And I know every time you go in there you
don't realize it because you're a dumb

1257
01:12:20,881 --> 01:12:21,780
ass.
But when you go in there,

1258
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:23,700
you're bumping deer and they're
going down that fence line.

1259
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:26,760
So if I see your truck coming
on and run over there, wow.

1260
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:30,960
Which is a kind of thing.
And like elk when I lived in Montana,

1261
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,370
we would like,

1262
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:37,490
our opening day plan was
generally find out where elk are,

1263
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:41,340
where they've been for a couple of weeks
and so that people will know they're

1264
01:12:41,341 --> 01:12:42,174
there.

1265
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:47,280
How are they going to leave that area
within three minutes of legal shooting

1266
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:51,540
light on opening day and what saddle are
they going to use in a pass out of that

1267
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:56,541
valley and you would pretty much plan
that would be your thing is I know where

1268
01:12:57,391 --> 01:12:57,960
they're at.

1269
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,350
I know that they're going to get bumped
probably before legal light and where

1270
01:13:01,351 --> 01:13:02,340
are they going to go after that?

1271
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:07,370
I got a friend who has for the last,
you know,

1272
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:11,340
20 years man killing elk by
he.

1273
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:16,140
He knows the spot to elk move into when
they get pressured and he knows it.

1274
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:19,320
Some people can find these elk with
spotting scopes and they'll find these elk

1275
01:13:19,321 --> 01:13:21,880
on his mountain side.
He knows that you,

1276
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:24,630
there's no way to approach these elk on
his mountain south without spooking him.

1277
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,230
When he sees the elk have
moved into this area,

1278
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:33,620
he'll watch him with a spot and scope
waiting to see someone else try to climb

1279
01:13:33,961 --> 01:13:38,940
up and put a move on. These elk when
they start climbing up act when he goes,

1280
01:13:38,941 --> 01:13:41,190
that guy sees him, he's going to
go and try to put a move on him.

1281
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:46,200
He'll go down an ambush, those elk
three miles away from there. Wow.

1282
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:49,830
And he waits till someone sees him cause
he knows what we're going to go cause

1283
01:13:49,831 --> 01:13:53,580
he knows the path they always take with
me and he calls it the laundry chute

1284
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,790
cause he said they come spilling through
there like laundry, laundry chute.

1285
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:59,370
He's been doing it for 20 years.
Wow.

1286
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:03,410
I really enjoyed that episode that
you did this year in Kentucky. Yeah.

1287
01:14:03,411 --> 01:14:06,870
That you went elk hunting in Kentucky
because the situation is very,

1288
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,950
it's very unique in that they've
reintroduced successfully
reintroduce elk into

1289
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,800
Kentucky and

1290
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,100
instead of like what you're looking at
a western hunt where you look at these

1291
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:18,820
great wide open spaces and timber and
you could see them in the distance.

1292
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:21,040
Instead,
you're looking at an incredibly dense,

1293
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:26,041
like southeast sort of kind of
forests where these elk are like,

1294
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:31,420
you were like kind of creeping up on him
and it was hard for the camera guy to

1295
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:34,960
get a good view of some of
these Alpha at the Lq shot.

1296
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,940
Like there's so many God damn trees there.

1297
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,290
Oh yeah.
You're just seeing little portions of,

1298
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:41,800
it was funny because when that
show in the beginning of that show,

1299
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,110
we're standing there and uh,
you know,

1300
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:49,000
predawn darkness and there's
like the eastern forest,

1301
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:53,620
they're sort of like the cacophony of
noise and an eastern forest that you lack

1302
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:59,020
in the west, it's lugs and towing. The
bio diversity is so much higher, you know,

1303
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:03,220
not a large mammals, but the biodiversity
of just stuff that Zach has a moisture,

1304
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,870
I don't know, quality is
soil moisture probe. Yeah,

1305
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:11,680
I would guess moisture as a huge part
of it and probably the for fertility,

1306
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,240
the landscape, like, like the,

1307
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:18,340
you know how nutrient rich the soil is
at some base level probably is what's at

1308
01:15:18,341 --> 01:15:23,110
play. Climate northwest doesn't have
those sounds and it's very moist.

1309
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,940
Yeah, you're right. That's
why I was confusing.

1310
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,480
I know guys that would be able
to answer that. I, I dunno. I,

1311
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:31,360
I know that for instance,
I keep coming back around,

1312
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:34,000
you can tell I'm so excited about
our hunt on principles. Alex had all,

1313
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:37,140
my brother who is an ecologist up there,
um,

1314
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:41,950
that that elevation band were
Prince of Wales Island. Is,

1315
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,280
is sort of the,
the richest marine environment

1316
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:48,730
of anywhere. Really. Yeah. So that,

1317
01:15:48,731 --> 01:15:53,220
that like latitude band is an extremely
rich marine environment there as far as

1318
01:15:53,221 --> 01:15:55,730
the fishing there must be
incredible. Yeah. And just,
I mean it's just everything.

1319
01:15:55,731 --> 01:15:59,090
It's like, it's just a buzz
with life. Are we going to,

1320
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:03,410
we're going to fish there were there
were there too? No, no, no. If we get,

1321
01:16:03,411 --> 01:16:07,250
maybe there's a possibility, but probably
not. So it gets a little bit late.

1322
01:16:07,251 --> 01:16:11,750
Like fishing peaks like July, August
is phenomenal. It just kind of halibut.

1323
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:13,730
Yeah.
But they held,

1324
01:16:13,731 --> 01:16:16,730
it's so much better in July and August
and we were just up there for my

1325
01:16:16,731 --> 01:16:19,610
brother's Bachelor party and did
phenomenally well. Unhealed. But yeah,

1326
01:16:19,611 --> 01:16:22,870
Doug was sending me pictures. We
got some doozies norm some, yeah,

1327
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:27,290
some nice tables.
So in the beginning,

1328
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:30,820
that episode just kind of
standing there and um, and,

1329
01:16:30,821 --> 01:16:33,560
and to hear that noise of
the eastern forest, you know,

1330
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:36,890
and then to have it be that
you're looking for elk is so,

1331
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:40,700
it just feels weird for anyone to
live with that and hold up a clip,

1332
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,640
pull up a clip.
So people get here cause it's pretty cool.

1333
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,690
It's you in the forest like on
your show where you were, uh,

1334
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,120
you were explaining it
and talking about it.

1335
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:55,710
The smell,
smell,

1336
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:03,530
smell right now seems to
have like a warm to him.

1337
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:07,540
It's hard to explain, but you just kind
of guess that too. Like you'll smell it.

1338
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:13,680
Not word outcome words were
used,

1339
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,330
his power games,
bed bed,

1340
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:22,790
little bats all over here.
It just makes sense.

1341
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:32,300
Yeah, those things are cool. It's like
a ghost in the forest. He shows up.

1342
01:17:32,301 --> 01:17:35,660
There they are. Man, this is so
different. So what norm is too.

1343
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,820
So they'll say he's got wiped
out of that area by eight,

1344
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:42,210
1820. Um, and you're
like, Daniel Boone, uh,

1345
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,980
used to cross over to get down
into the Kentucky hunting grounds.

1346
01:17:47,981 --> 01:17:50,770
He would cross over to Cumberland gap,
which is very near there.

1347
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:56,320
And then he would go to, you know,
what we call the blue grass hills.

1348
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:00,910
And that was an more open environment and
had a lot of elk and people would hunt

1349
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:02,680
in Houston,
not the blue grass hills for elk,

1350
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:06,880
deer hunt for deer and a hundred for
black bear selling the meat and heights by

1351
01:18:06,881 --> 01:18:10,840
1820 or thereabouts, the
elk herd has gone. Okay.

1352
01:18:10,841 --> 01:18:15,750
The buffalo got shot out. Um, elk
got shot out, dear remained black,

1353
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:18,280
remained mountain lions were shot out,

1354
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:23,050
wolves are shot out and they were
gone for over a hundred years.

1355
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,090
And then when they did it,

1356
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:30,091
all that mountaintop coal
mining in Kentucky and after
the reclamation process,

1357
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:35,680
you know, they had chopped down in
the construction of these minds,

1358
01:18:35,681 --> 01:18:40,240
they destroyed a lot of, of
hardwood forests. Okay. Like
deciduous hardwood forest,

1359
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:43,930
Hickory Beach, oh work, all kinds of
stuff. But when they reclaimed the left,

1360
01:18:43,931 --> 01:18:48,610
all these flat mountain top areas that
they just did it. And, and, um, you know,

1361
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,730
grasses and other stabilizing vegetation,
not timber.

1362
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:57,360
And it created sort of this open
savanna like environment and

1363
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,980
people recognize it to be
a good place to put elk.

1364
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:07,030
And there wasn't a lot of resistance if
you went into an agricultural area and

1365
01:19:07,031 --> 01:19:08,800
decided, you know, we got a great idea,

1366
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:13,240
we're going to bring
in thousands of seven,

1367
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:16,540
800 pound herbivores and
cuddle loose out here.

1368
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:21,590
You would get a ton of resistance.
But the areas rural enough and,

1369
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,140
and the reclaim coal country,

1370
01:19:23,141 --> 01:19:27,610
that just wasn't a huge interest
in not putting them there.

1371
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:31,930
And so now they've got the biggest
elkert east of the Mississippi.

1372
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:35,350
There's 10,000 plus elk
run around and Kentucky,

1373
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:40,620
but even still al-kurd are
like 90% not recovered,

1374
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:43,990
you know, I mean, they were
everywhere. They were everywhere.

1375
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:48,130
And the weird thing about it
is we could have as many back,

1376
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:51,910
we could totally bring back
way more than we have now.

1377
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:55,240
But you have a handful of
interest that don't like that.

1378
01:19:55,241 --> 01:19:58,540
Auto insurers generally don't like it.
Agricultural interest don't like it,

1379
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:01,270
but it's one of those things that we
could fix like that. And the Buffalo,

1380
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:06,610
the only thing standing between us and
restoring buffalo to more of their native

1381
01:20:06,611 --> 01:20:11,010
range is popular conception,
perception of, you know, property,

1382
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,060
the perception of the issue.

1383
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,540
The only thing standing between Austin
reintroducing elk to more and more of

1384
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:19,530
their native range is just selling it
to the public. Other problems we have,

1385
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:23,570
you know, you look at something
like acidification of the
oceans, people are like,

1386
01:20:23,571 --> 01:20:27,240
she's, I have no idea. I Dunno
what I, there's no way, right?

1387
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:29,940
It's impossible to fix this.
It's too expensive. Whatever.

1388
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:31,980
We don't know the science,
we don't understand the science of it,

1389
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:35,520
but some stuff like when it comes
to bringing big animals back,

1390
01:20:35,521 --> 01:20:37,590
oftentimes it's just a matter
of do we want to or not?

1391
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,070
And in Kentucky there was enough people
that want it to where they made it

1392
01:20:41,071 --> 01:20:44,910
happen and now it's a thriving hurt.
They're even using that herd they had,

1393
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:45,870
they pulled animals.

1394
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:49,790
The Rocky Mountain Elk
Foundation spearheaded the
saying and provided much the

1395
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:51,240
money and labor for it.

1396
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:55,560
They pulled animals from Kimra for
[inaudible] 17 or 20 source sites,

1397
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:59,820
moved him into Kentucky. Now Kentucky's
a source site for other reintroduction.

1398
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:02,790
So they're pulling animals out of
Kentucky now and use them to, to,

1399
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:05,660
to reintroduce herds and all the
places where they were extubated.

1400
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:09,750
But what other places are they planning
it now? They've got some going into,

1401
01:21:09,751 --> 01:21:13,290
I know in Virginia to bring in some in,
um,

1402
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,350
I'm not sure if they brought
them in in North Carolina,

1403
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:18,330
but North Carolina had an aid of hurts.

1404
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:22,860
Was this an amazing animal?
So the meat is so incredibly healthy.

1405
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:25,050
It's really like a, a, a breast,

1406
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:29,580
a pound of chicken and a pound of elk.
The elk will have last cholesterol.

1407
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,250
It's healthier for you,
less fat, more protein.

1408
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:35,540
It's the best. It's the best meat
out there man. As far as eating,

1409
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:39,380
like the taste of visit is still make,
there's no bad elk.

1410
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:43,280
They're just good. Even the big
giant ones. There's this good man.

1411
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:46,850
My brother killed one one time. He
had a really hard, it was just tough.

1412
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,850
He had an age, but you just, you know,

1413
01:21:48,851 --> 01:21:53,610
you need like a nice facility to be able
to consistently age stuff cause the,

1414
01:21:53,611 --> 01:21:56,960
if the weather's against you, you can't
age. Like we're, you know, no one's got,

1415
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,110
most people don't have a walking
cooler where they can go hang 400,

1416
01:22:00,111 --> 01:22:04,190
500 pounds of meat. That is what an
elk. So if you get one in, it's hot.

1417
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:07,060
Oftentimes you've got to get it into a
freezer and it'll age a little bit in the

1418
01:22:07,061 --> 01:22:11,000
freezer. But anyways, he killed one
flavor was great, but it was just a tough,

1419
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,430
tough,
tough bowl to chew on.

1420
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:18,080
Just a big muscular animal and it's just
tough. And um, it was funny cause he uh,

1421
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:22,970
he started the, the only vegetable
he was interested in eating.

1422
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:25,640
I'm going to tell you this was
boiled cabbage because he's like,

1423
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:31,090
I only have so much muscle power and
my jaw and I can't waste any of my jaw

1424
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:36,600
muscle power on anything
but chewing my elk.

1425
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:40,820
So he would eat boiled cabbage and that,

1426
01:22:40,821 --> 01:22:44,310
and his elk until he got done
with it until he saw crowns.

1427
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:49,420
Let me tell you a funny start on this
guy to like his aversion to waste is a

1428
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:54,761
buddy of ours got married one time and
and his bride's neighbors were out of

1429
01:22:57,591 --> 01:23:01,790
town for during the wedding ceremonies.
The bride's neighbor says,

1430
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:02,960
well,

1431
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,150
I'll open my house up if you some out
of town guests who need a place to stay

1432
01:23:07,151 --> 01:23:08,380
because I'm on vacation anyways,

1433
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:13,800
so they give this house where it's just
like for the groomsmen to hang out.

1434
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,480
I mean, my brothers were in the, you know,

1435
01:23:16,481 --> 01:23:18,160
were the groomsmen and
some other guys and stuff.

1436
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:22,150
We get to stay in this house
during our stay. He has Okasan.

1437
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:27,360
My brother Matt has occasion to peak
in the guy's freezer and sees in his

1438
01:23:28,391 --> 01:23:31,090
freezer that he's got an elk
he killed four years ago.

1439
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:34,920
It's dated from four years ago and he,

1440
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,240
he has a moral crisis where he's like,

1441
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:43,140
is it worse to steal or is it worse to
allow such a beautiful animals flesh to

1442
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:51,001
go to waste when this guy inevitably will
declare this freezer burned and throw

1443
01:23:51,011 --> 01:23:54,700
it away. Like if he was going to eat it,
he would hate it. Right. Three years ago,

1444
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:55,660
three and a half years ago,

1445
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:01,320
so when we left he had a bunch of that
in his duffel bag and went home and ate

1446
01:24:01,331 --> 01:24:06,070
it because he couldn't stomach the
thought of that animal going to waste like

1447
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:09,520
his reverence for it is so
high that he can't have,

1448
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:13,060
he can't allow someone else to,
to trifle with it.

1449
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:16,750
How many years is an animal good in
a freezer? I'm telling you what man.

1450
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,490
It depends on the animal lean
stuff like elk if you trim away.

1451
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:26,530
Okay. Lean stuff like hooved animals
who have, who have game animals.

1452
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,550
If you trim away the fat, which we don't
call it that, we call tallow, it's waxy.

1453
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:35,551
If you trim that stuff away and you either
seal it with a vacuum sealer and then

1454
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:40,750
don't mess with the bag,

1455
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:43,750
like don't poke any holes in the bag so
that the seal stays good and treat it

1456
01:24:43,751 --> 01:24:48,751
very gently so that this deal stays so
the seal stays intact or you wrap it in

1457
01:24:49,781 --> 01:24:54,250
Saran wrap and then wrap
it in wax freezer paper.

1458
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:58,410
You could not. Pepsi challenge that
stuff. If it was a year old again,

1459
01:24:58,411 --> 01:25:02,680
stuff that was a month old. What about
two years? Three years I've done that too.

1460
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:07,450
Two is for me personally,
the longest out I've gone is to,

1461
01:25:07,451 --> 01:25:12,451
I've heard of people going more and at
two when you thought and you look at it,

1462
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:17,350
you can tell something happened to it
where you can trim it up and have it be

1463
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,230
and I've served at old stuff
like that to my wife. No time.

1464
01:25:20,231 --> 01:25:24,100
It happens to me is if I wind up having
something get kind of lost in my freezer.

1465
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,430
If you don't practice good freezer
management like I try to do,

1466
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,590
what would it be last
in, first out, right.

1467
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:33,040
But now and then just something happens
and you lose track of something and you

1468
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:34,060
find some old thing.

1469
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:39,570
I've served stuff to my wife that was two
years old and she didn't flag it while

1470
01:25:39,911 --> 01:25:43,600
eating it. He was like user
and as an experiment do it.

1471
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:46,750
Cause I mean she'll call me out,
right? She eats more wild game meat.

1472
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,020
Most people that, I mean it's, you
know, she's wild game meat every night.

1473
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:52,480
That's all you have in your home or
at home. Yeah, he does. He gave me,

1474
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:54,430
lately we've been eating
salmon and how that,

1475
01:25:54,431 --> 01:25:57,940
which you can't really complain about,
but you know, she's eating tons of it.

1476
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:02,170
She'd recently, um, I'm not allowed,

1477
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,130
I'm trying to get this overturned,

1478
01:26:04,131 --> 01:26:06,500
but right now there's a
moratorium on bear meat

1479
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:12,170
in your house because you've got tricky
knows. Yeah. I saw her, her and my kids.

1480
01:26:12,171 --> 01:26:16,010
She said that you will not serve
bear me to my kids. Oh Wow.

1481
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:20,540
Because of you getting, as I got the
word illness, if you under cook it,

1482
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:24,410
it's like 150 degrees. Right. You and know
what it is. And I tried to explain that.

1483
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:25,823
So

1484
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:28,463
w

1485
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:33,250
the, the spring we hunted black bears.
We have blackberries in the Alaska range.

1486
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:36,460
I took a guy hunting who you should
have on the show at some point.

1487
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,850
Is it a guy named Work Denver?
And he's a,

1488
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:40,983
okay.

1489
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:45,250
He, he's just leaving the service now.
He's a navy seal commander. And, um,

1490
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:49,160
he wrote a book called Damn few making
the modern seal warrior and you remember

1491
01:26:49,161 --> 01:26:52,370
a few years ago that movie act of Valor
came out and was all active duty seals.

1492
01:26:52,371 --> 01:26:56,720
He's one of the stars in that movie
and um, took 'em out, bear hunt.

1493
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:59,210
He grew up fishing and like to fish a lot,

1494
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,050
hadn't done any hunting but definitely
grew up in the outdoors. And then,

1495
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:07,220
you know, obviously over the last
13, 14 years they've been just,

1496
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,000
he's been just consumed by training and
being deployed again and again and again

1497
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,110
to Iraq and Afghanistan.

1498
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:18,290
So he hasn't like messed around outside
even those very important him growing up,

1499
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:20,540
he just, like I said, he's
leaving the service now.

1500
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:22,480
I took them out on a hunt and uh,

1501
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:26,330
we went to black bear hunting and Indiana.

1502
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:31,070
We got on this big black bear and called
in with a Predator call and he killed

1503
01:27:31,071 --> 01:27:33,710
the bear and we walked home.
It's a big bore, you know,

1504
01:27:33,711 --> 01:27:37,670
it's like a six and a half foot bore.
And I said, and we're cutting it up.

1505
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:41,210
And I'm saying to him on camera,
I'm like, I'm telling you what man,

1506
01:27:41,211 --> 01:27:43,550
if a bear is going to have trick
knows this is going to be him.

1507
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:49,040
And what I'm talking about
was Montana used to do free.

1508
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:54,140
Uh, they used to do free testing for
trick analysis so you could send in a,

1509
01:27:54,141 --> 01:27:59,141
they asked for specifically a golf ball
sized piece of the tongue and you could

1510
01:27:59,271 --> 01:28:03,470
send it in to the Msu and an Msu would
send you the results on your bare.

1511
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:08,860
The first bear ever sent in for testing
was from a 17 year old black bear.

1512
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:13,970
Whoa. And that bear meat came back
positive besides steaks and roasts.

1513
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:18,620
I had 83 pounds of ground meat off
that black bear. It was a big bear.

1514
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:23,480
So I said anything and it comes back
and it's positive and once it's positive

1515
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:26,770
you are excused from wanton waste laws.

1516
01:28:26,771 --> 01:28:31,190
So it's illegal to waste
game me. Okay. You,

1517
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:35,420
they spell out in great detail what
you're obligated to retain on an animal in

1518
01:28:35,421 --> 01:28:38,940
use. There's some areas in Alaska
for instance, where you know,

1519
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,180
if you kill a moose you have
to bring the liver home.

1520
01:28:41,181 --> 01:28:44,390
It's specified like legally you're
obligated to salvage, deliver.

1521
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:48,860
So they sent a thing saying we're not
going to give you a new bear tag but your

1522
01:28:48,861 --> 01:28:51,500
excuse and if you want to discard
the meat you can discard the meat.

1523
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:53,510
And I was like, there's no
way I'm gonna do that. Right.

1524
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:57,380
The only thing worse to me than getting
tricky analysis was it was thrown away

1525
01:28:57,381 --> 01:29:00,890
this bear meat.
So I just got to meet thermometer,

1526
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:05,310
a nice one and eight the
whole bear I went on,

1527
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:09,660
I never got another bear tested and
they told me, I read this thing,

1528
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:10,494
we're saying that these,

1529
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:14,010
they did this study Montana where these
two counties in northwest Montana,

1530
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:17,220
they have really high barrier populations
is Lincoln County in Sanders County.

1531
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:20,670
And they said the Dave never
tested a bear from those counties.

1532
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:23,880
That was over six years of age.
The didn't have trick analysis.

1533
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:27,150
So trigger Knowles is just something that
you're not born with it, right? You can,

1534
01:29:27,151 --> 01:29:32,151
you eat in fact did meet and you
can track the disease or you know,

1535
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:36,150
and then you wind up
having those little cysts,

1536
01:29:36,151 --> 01:29:39,330
the larva and your muscle tissue and it
just is pass along through consumption.

1537
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:43,980
It's the reason you're supposed
to cook pork to well done.

1538
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,760
And now it's not really that way anymore.

1539
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,370
We say I've gotten to the out of
domestic pork so much because when they,

1540
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:55,440
when they stopped feeding pigs, restaurant
slop, they really cut trick analysis.

1541
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:57,930
Alex, what they realize is when
they're feeding pigs restaurant slop,

1542
01:29:57,931 --> 01:30:02,220
you're inadvertently giving them rats and
mice that are sort of caught up in the

1543
01:30:02,221 --> 01:30:05,970
cycle of restaurant slop, right.
And Rats and mice are big carriers.

1544
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,510
So once they got rid of then once they
made it illegal and they had like only

1545
01:30:09,511 --> 01:30:13,620
that the USDA inspected pigs are
feeding on controlled sources,

1546
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:17,280
not stuff from, you know, garbage
pails. I used to wash dishes,

1547
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:20,640
had to summer camp when I was kid in
everyday a pig farmer came and got all the

1548
01:30:20,641 --> 01:30:23,610
food scraps and he fed him and
he was selling inspected pork.

1549
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:27,660
So you can't do that now. So now 97%
of the black bear cases, or sorry,

1550
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:32,490
90 some percent of the trick and notices
cases in the u s come from bear meat.

1551
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:37,790
I'm explaining all this to work and the
next day I'm explaining to him another

1552
01:30:41,821 --> 01:30:43,050
interesting thing about black for me,

1553
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:45,420
how there's a lot of variability
in black Burmese. Some are great,

1554
01:30:45,421 --> 01:30:48,810
some are not so great.
So I'm talking about when I kill a bear,

1555
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:52,230
I'm always really interested to get a
taste of it to see if we're dealing with,

1556
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:56,730
if we got gold or bronze,
right. And we started firing,

1557
01:30:56,731 --> 01:31:00,450
it's rain and we start a little
fire and ski rope. Just some pieces,

1558
01:31:00,451 --> 01:31:04,530
just the sample it and it's raining
and we're feeding it the firewood and

1559
01:31:04,531 --> 01:31:06,720
everything's wet and she's a pain
in the ass trying to get it cooked.

1560
01:31:06,721 --> 01:31:11,520
And eventually I kind of peel this
piece apart in my hands. I'm like,

1561
01:31:11,521 --> 01:31:16,170
yeah, you know, we're cool,
we're cool. So there's six of us,

1562
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,640
we eat it and I don't even think
in there or think about it. Right?

1563
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:25,000
So the next day we cooked some shanks,
but we cook the piss out of the shanks.

1564
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:28,320
Like we make awesome Buco brace shanks
and cook them for five or six hours.

1565
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:32,400
Right. We'd a whole bunch of that, eat
some grayling, eat some rainbow trout,

1566
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:33,630
go home.

1567
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:39,270
A month goes by and I get
the shits real bad. So,

1568
01:31:39,271 --> 01:31:40,980
and it's like a weird kind of the shits.

1569
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:45,480
So I send a text message to
the guys at work with St.

1570
01:31:45,481 --> 01:31:48,570
Does anybody have like a weird kind of
the shits because I'm worried that we got

1571
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,490
GRD or something or Crypto spiraea from,

1572
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,690
from water contamination and um,

1573
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:59,100
one of the guys rice bag and he says, no,
but man do I got, it's like some pieces,

1574
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:03,520
muscle aches, you know, now.
Yeah, we'll never mind that.
I'm worried about my shit.

1575
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:04,630
You know,
I'm not worried about your problem.

1576
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:09,460
So couple days later I remember I'm like
crossing a street and I'm like, God,

1577
01:32:09,461 --> 01:32:11,140
that's a weird feeling in my back.
You know?

1578
01:32:11,141 --> 01:32:12,820
And it just got worse and worse and worse,

1579
01:32:12,821 --> 01:32:14,590
and eventually texted
this guy and I'm like,

1580
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,800
what were you saying about muscle legs?
Dude,

1581
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:23,110
in a while four of us all had it.
And when we started putting it together,

1582
01:32:23,111 --> 01:32:25,870
I was like,
we all have the same weird thing.

1583
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:30,900
Intense muscle pain and our calves and
tense muscle pain in our next fevers and

1584
01:32:32,231 --> 01:32:34,060
we haven't seen each other for a month.

1585
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:38,350
And we all got sick on
July five so it was like,

1586
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:40,840
this isn't the common cold.

1587
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:44,410
So there's an incubation period a month.
What has you eat?

1588
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:50,010
The only thing that can liberate those
larva from their sis is stomach acid.

1589
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:52,630
So when you consume the meat,

1590
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:58,900
your stomach acid dissolves the
the thing and liberates the larva.

1591
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:02,800
And you've got boys and girls in
there and it takes them forever.

1592
01:33:02,801 --> 01:33:05,710
It takes them weeks, they build up their
numbers, you know they get kicking ass.

1593
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:10,330
Then they get into your bloodstream,
larva, do an antibiotic month into it.

1594
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:15,570
The larva start burrowing out of your
vascular system and getting into your

1595
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:20,180
muscle tissue when they start
setting up shop. Oh my God.

1596
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,380
So
the CDC gets involved in this.

1597
01:33:25,710 --> 01:33:26,543
Um,

1598
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:31,790
I was now in Kings County k and they
sent me a thing recently where no one in

1599
01:33:31,831 --> 01:33:36,120
King's county has had like
last year in the whole country.

1600
01:33:36,121 --> 01:33:38,820
It was like 11 or 12 cases. The
trick Nelson, the whole country,

1601
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:43,130
no one in King's county had it in four
or five years. The last guy that had, um,

1602
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:47,730
I think a guy and I think
a guy in 2007 or 2011,

1603
01:33:47,731 --> 01:33:50,400
I can't remember which,
where's kings county is Seattle area.

1604
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:54,540
He had it from making a
homemade mountain lion jerky,

1605
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:57,150
like the only guy.

1606
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:01,260
So they're all excited and they want me
to give him a piece of the meat and I

1607
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:02,340
give him a piece of that meat.

1608
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:06,120
They come to car and I like go down
and hand them a shank off this bear.

1609
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:09,960
I told her, I said, if you eat
that cookie, you know, and um,

1610
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:12,210
she tests it and they get
back to me while later.

1611
01:34:12,211 --> 01:34:15,690
Nothing had 868 larva program,

1612
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:17,520
which

1613
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,600
is something like 460,000 larva propound.
Oh my God.

1614
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:25,230
There's these blown up images
of it and it's just like,

1615
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:30,580
it's just larva. So the whole meat,
it's just, it's just an festival. Larva,

1616
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:33,900
Bam. Must be in misery. I
don't know what he's thinking,

1617
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:39,840
but I'm fine now.
So out of the four of us to get sick,

1618
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,880
I go down and they say like
in severe cases, you know,

1619
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:49,050
if it attacks your pulmonary system,
but if the larva tech your heart,

1620
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,380
there's, you'd take it, there's a
medication you take. Well, I said, well,

1621
01:34:52,381 --> 01:34:55,290
I'm just gonna take the medication, you
know? And they're like, well, you know,

1622
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,580
you might not need to. I said, well, I'll
take it. I go down on that medications,

1623
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,160
$2,400 even with health insurance,

1624
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:05,240
it's $1,100 to buy the medication.
So the other guys are like, well,

1625
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:06,560
I'll just wait and see
what happens to you.

1626
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:11,780
We all get better at the same time and
that medication only kills them in your

1627
01:35:11,781 --> 01:35:15,560
stomach. Right? So for six to 10 years,

1628
01:35:15,561 --> 01:35:17,000
depending on your source,

1629
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,580
if you were to eat me under cooked,
you would contract.

1630
01:35:22,581 --> 01:35:24,480
Trigonal says,
Whoa,

1631
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:27,920
I don't know if that means
I have 868 larva per gram.

1632
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:31,880
I just have a hard time fathoming that.
But we're all positive,

1633
01:35:31,881 --> 01:35:35,720
like we're positive carriers.
Wow.

1634
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:39,320
So you right now have those
things in your muscle tissue.

1635
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:42,500
That's my understanding, and I read
a lot about this as you can imagine.

1636
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:45,260
Like I was very curious about,
I didn't know.

1637
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:49,910
I always thought when you got tricking
analysis, you died kind of. I didn't know.

1638
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:51,200
I thought,
I don't know what I thought.

1639
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:56,440
I've been writing about this and
talking about this on TV for 10 years,

1640
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:59,960
telling people in by the way,
make sure to, but you know,

1641
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:04,130
they say familiarity breeds complacency.
You know I what? It was contempt.

1642
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:06,890
Is that what it is? Yeah. No.
Well then that's my new saying

1643
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,760
because I felt like,

1644
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:15,380
I don't know why I can sit here right now
and picture the piece of meat that I'm

1645
01:36:15,381 --> 01:36:19,640
sure it got me sick, so I don't
know what else. Thinking, man,

1646
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:22,610
my wife's like is so embarrassing.
She's like,

1647
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:25,010
you're supposed to be like the
mediator and you. I'm like, I'm like,

1648
01:36:25,011 --> 01:36:28,400
you know what though? And I was
embarrassed and it's embarrassing, right?

1649
01:36:28,401 --> 01:36:30,920
But at the same time, like, you know
what word while the mountain here's die,

1650
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:34,670
they die on the mountain, you
know? So it's not like, oh,

1651
01:36:34,671 --> 01:36:36,380
you should be the last guy
to die in the mountain.

1652
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:38,810
You claim to be this big mountain
here. And it's like, well,

1653
01:36:38,811 --> 01:36:41,070
you know what exposure, I don't
know. You know, living on it.

1654
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:44,270
That's just my way of hiding the
fact that I was like really stupid.

1655
01:36:44,271 --> 01:36:47,490
It was a stupid thing to do and I want to,
I remember Dodi saying,

1656
01:36:47,491 --> 01:36:49,850
are you sure you want people to know that
this happened to you because it isn't

1657
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:52,250
it kind of embarrassing to you. And I'm
like, yeah, it's embarrassing to me,

1658
01:36:52,251 --> 01:36:57,020
but I'm just going to talk
about it. Cookie bear me. So
she, yeah, my wife's like,

1659
01:36:57,021 --> 01:36:58,910
no way that we're just done
with the bear meat thing.

1660
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:02,150
And my brother and my brother's
wedding were at his rehearsal dinner.

1661
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:04,550
We're doing all wild game
for his rehearsal dinner.

1662
01:37:04,551 --> 01:37:09,551
So I had smoked up a ham off this bear
the longest serve it as rehearsal dinner.

1663
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:11,960
He says,

1664
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:16,960
don't tell anybody about the warm deal
because it'll turn them off to the whole

1665
01:37:17,451 --> 01:37:21,260
damn meal. And I said,
well, I gotta I feel now,

1666
01:37:21,261 --> 01:37:24,800
like I'll have to say this
has been cooked, but Fyi,

1667
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:30,490
I got trick gnosis from eating this bear
uncooked and he thinks that he's just

1668
01:37:31,161 --> 01:37:35,420
like, I'd rather you not serve
it, then serve it and bring it up.

1669
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:40,670
I think you should serve it in Indiana.
Decided not to serve it at his wedding.

1670
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:44,540
I would have eaten it as long as it's
cooked to 150 degrees, especially smoked.

1671
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:49,040
I know people aren't like that,
man. People aren't like that.

1672
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:52,280
I smoked at ham from that
pig that we shot and a,

1673
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:56,130
I cooked it to finish your in your,
your method with the brine.

1674
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,010
Oh my God. It was some of the
best tasting meat I've ever had.

1675
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,000
It was unbelievable. And that son of
a bitch, probably. Yes. I mean not,

1676
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:06,210
not probably, but was a very good chance
he's got it. They you meet. Yeah. Yeah.

1677
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:09,930
It was so tender and delicious, but
I've cooked a bunch of it. Just,

1678
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:11,520
just put it on the grill,

1679
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:15,450
just seasoned it and put it on the grill
and it's a amazing how tough it is.

1680
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,140
Yeah. It can be tall. Shoot
through that shit, but tastes good.

1681
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:20,610
Did you get a grinder? Yeah, I
got to grind, you know? Yeah.

1682
01:38:20,611 --> 01:38:24,240
I got a grinder for the venison
after Wisconsin Cowan and I,

1683
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:29,360
we made buckets of hamburger meat. That's
good. Oh, it's so you can grind. Yeah.

1684
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:31,070
That wild port to,
yeah.

1685
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:34,390
I'd be curious just to take a piece of
that wild pork and send it in and see if,

1686
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:37,090
if it has a,
it has trick analysis.

1687
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:41,230
Do you want me to, I'll send it in. I
Dunno. I mean, what is that? I don't know.

1688
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:43,800
What would you do with the
information if you knew? Uh,

1689
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:47,640
make sure I did what I'm already doing,
I guess. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, I,

1690
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:48,391
when I cooked it,

1691
01:38:48,391 --> 01:38:53,020
I cooked that the smoked ham I cooked
for like fucking 10 hours or something.

1692
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:56,010
Yeah. It took forever. And you get it
out to the right temperature. Yeah.

1693
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,030
Some people even,
yeah.

1694
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:01,520
Say like Harold Mcgee's
science and Laura, the kitchen,

1695
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,890
her science and Laura cooking,
whatever it is. It's a great,

1696
01:39:03,891 --> 01:39:07,970
it's like the science of food and food
cooking and ingredients is a phenomenal

1697
01:39:07,971 --> 01:39:12,180
reference book in there. He says,
it seems to be, I think the,

1698
01:39:12,230 --> 01:39:13,340
it was in his book,
he says,

1699
01:39:13,341 --> 01:39:16,250
it seems that there's evidence
to suggest that freezing.

1700
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:17,570
Okay.

1701
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:21,140
Kills it though. The USDA is
still sticks to that guideline of,

1702
01:39:21,141 --> 01:39:24,560
of cooking temperature,
but then like prolonged freezing kills it.

1703
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:29,330
But a couple of years ago a couple of
guys got trick and from Walrus meet in

1704
01:39:29,331 --> 01:39:33,770
Alaska. Fucking Wallrose. Yeah.
So Howard ass on bitch got it.

1705
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:38,060
But he's the Walrus at it and
they think that there might be,

1706
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:41,990
this worm is tricky.
Nela spiral us I think is his name.

1707
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:46,460
I got pictures of the thing on my phone,
what the world looks like. So, um,

1708
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:50,690
that there's, nor they think there's
might be some northern varieties

1709
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:52,310
okay.

1710
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:56,960
In walrus, in polar bear that
are less susceptible to freezing

1711
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:03,610
and that perhaps that freezing is not to
be relied on when killing these worms.

1712
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:08,250
That it's a different northern variety
that's just got more tolerance. Hey man,

1713
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:12,270
this is just something I read at fuck
is eating polar bear and Walrus. Wow.

1714
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:16,290
People like Walrus. There's the guy,
you know, it's funny, I've never had it,

1715
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:20,400
but I've been arranging to have
some because I drew um, uh,

1716
01:40:20,401 --> 01:40:25,110
Muskox tag for none of Eric Island
this winter. And when you hunt,

1717
01:40:25,111 --> 01:40:26,580
none of background,
if you draw that tag,

1718
01:40:26,581 --> 01:40:30,210
you have to hire what's
called a transporter because
the only place the land is

1719
01:40:30,211 --> 01:40:33,810
a Meeker rock on none of act
and it's a native village. Okay.

1720
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,000
So into it or ask them, oh, village.

1721
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:41,280
And these people like your
transporter can't do guide services.

1722
01:40:41,281 --> 01:40:45,090
Like he can't tell you where an animal is,
but he's like provides transportation.

1723
01:40:45,091 --> 01:40:49,530
So you rent snow machines
or Harvey getting around and
he'll give you a place to

1724
01:40:49,531 --> 01:40:51,930
stay when you're on the island.
It's called a transporter.

1725
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:55,630
The transporter that I'm
using is a walrus hunter.

1726
01:40:55,990 --> 01:41:00,010
So they're protected by the Marine
Mammal Protection Act. Okay.

1727
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,290
So like white guys don't go hunt Walrus,

1728
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:07,590
but natives who aren't administered by
the Marine Mammal Protection Act have

1729
01:41:09,251 --> 01:41:11,950
their own self governing body
called the walrus commission.

1730
01:41:11,951 --> 01:41:12,950
And I think the wall was commission.

1731
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:17,080
I came Emirates that meets and gnome or
Kotzebue and the walrus commission will

1732
01:41:17,081 --> 01:41:22,081
make decisions about what walrus harvest
different coastal villages are allowed

1733
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:24,670
to have an out there on none of act.

1734
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:30,180
Those hunters out there will periodically
go and hunt Walrus and the guy I'm

1735
01:41:30,761 --> 01:41:33,910
using as my transporter
goals on the walrus hunts.

1736
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:38,890
So I've been encouraging him to make
sure to have some that I'd cause I'd like

1737
01:41:38,891 --> 01:41:42,130
to eat it when I come out and I'd like
to do a thing about that and hang out

1738
01:41:42,131 --> 01:41:43,830
with this guy and eat.
We'll always meet and he's going to,

1739
01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:48,540
he says he's going to make sure to have
some on hand and our Wa walruses like

1740
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:49,960
when when you,
you were hunting walrus.

1741
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:53,630
Like you're allowed to eat the meat
but you're not allowed to hunt it. So,

1742
01:41:53,631 --> 01:41:57,670
but if someone can give it to you, could
you bring it back? I don't know about,

1743
01:41:57,700 --> 01:42:00,520
you can't bring the ivory bag.
I don't know about transporting the meat.

1744
01:42:00,521 --> 01:42:01,780
That's a good question.
But yeah,

1745
01:42:01,781 --> 01:42:04,420
I could go into his home and I
don't even know the extent of it,

1746
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,210
but I can go into his home
and he can serve me a meal.

1747
01:42:07,211 --> 01:42:10,180
Just like people might go up
to Nome or whatever and sample,

1748
01:42:10,181 --> 01:42:14,200
mock talk from a whale, you
know. Um, but no, I don't,

1749
01:42:14,230 --> 01:42:18,520
I know I'm fairly certain that
he could not give me the ivory,

1750
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:21,100
you know, cause there's
like the, the ivory ban,

1751
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:24,490
so I re has to have a cultural
marking on it. You know,

1752
01:42:24,491 --> 01:42:27,190
you're supposed to turn the artwork.
So a lot of times, you know,

1753
01:42:27,191 --> 01:42:32,170
like sea otters were nearly extra
paid in some places like regionally,

1754
01:42:32,171 --> 01:42:35,230
extra painted by the fur trade,
particularly when the Russians were,

1755
01:42:35,290 --> 01:42:40,060
had a strong presence in Alaska. And
now see otter numbers are, you know,

1756
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:41,590
really recovered in a lot of areas,

1757
01:42:41,591 --> 01:42:44,560
but still for natives that are
allowed to trap sea otters,

1758
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:47,530
they can't just sell the pelt as a pelt.

1759
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:51,520
They have to do something to
it to make it a cultural item,

1760
01:42:51,610 --> 01:42:53,710
at which point they can
exchange it for money.

1761
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:57,550
So if a native hunter kills a Walrus,

1762
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:02,930
he can do scrimshaw on
that Tusk, you know, and,

1763
01:43:02,931 --> 01:43:06,610
and that puts that Tusk and a different
legal framework than it would as raw,

1764
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:11,470
what they call raw ivory. Hmm. That's
fascinating. So I know, but yeah,

1765
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:14,210
he can serve me a piece of wall.
Where's meat? But I don't know.

1766
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:18,450
I don't know what laws govern me
walking away with some, I have no idea.

1767
01:43:18,470 --> 01:43:23,410
No seals. They eat seals as well.
They're allowed to hunt and eat seals.

1768
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:26,920
The, uh, the natives and the Inuits
again, it's again, it's self govern.

1769
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:32,100
I watched a Bordain show and he was with
this family and they were eating a seal

1770
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:35,860
and they butchered the whole thing.
Yeah. That was in northern Canada. Right.

1771
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:37,570
What's the,
what's there's like an autonomous,

1772
01:43:37,571 --> 01:43:41,110
it's sort of like on the autonomous zone
there. The name escapes me right now,

1773
01:43:41,111 --> 01:43:44,060
but yeah, I know what you're talking
about. And they're eating it raw. Yeah.

1774
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,540
That doesn't have chicken houses.
I have no idea.

1775
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:50,320
Or I don't know if people were surprised
to hear that Walrus has had trick

1776
01:43:50,321 --> 01:43:54,170
analysis. What does a walrus
eat? Well, they eat a lot of ELL,

1777
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:59,570
clams, crabs. He lost. I
just don't know enough.

1778
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:01,470
I don't know enough about how that thing,
God,

1779
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:05,240
I don't know enough about whether what
kind of sea animals have that stuff.

1780
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:08,120
I mean, was he in a chunk of polar
bear that you found frozen? None.

1781
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:13,100
I have no idea. I would love to know
when I had Lyme disease, I did tons of,

1782
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:16,820
I could've gotten an honorary phd in
Lyme disease after having Lyme disease,

1783
01:44:16,821 --> 01:44:18,680
and then when I got trick and Osis,

1784
01:44:18,681 --> 01:44:20,640
I started reading everything I
could find about triggering also,

1785
01:44:20,641 --> 01:44:23,900
but that just got better one day.
That's wild. So then I can read.

1786
01:44:23,901 --> 01:44:28,190
I quit reading about it just, you just
felt better. It's just a win away. Six,

1787
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:29,870
seven days.
One of the guys that had,

1788
01:44:29,871 --> 01:44:34,871
he was running 103.9 degree fever for
six days and they're checking them for

1789
01:44:35,031 --> 01:44:39,110
like den, gay fever, West Nile virus.
He had no idea to even bring this up.

1790
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:43,460
One of the dudes, girlfriends is
a doctor and she says, finally,

1791
01:44:43,461 --> 01:44:47,060
I think you boys got trick analysis.
I go into doc and I'm like,

1792
01:44:47,061 --> 01:44:49,760
here's what I think I got,
and they didn't know,

1793
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:52,190
didn't know what the hell
I was talking about. Well,

1794
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:55,070
you said 12 cases a year in the
entire country. They never see,

1795
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:57,480
and there's four of you.
I'm asking me how to spell it once.

1796
01:44:57,510 --> 01:45:01,180
I was talking about a venereal disease
called Sherman Triggerman Nights,

1797
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:06,560
but I eventually convinced a man,
just like when I had Lyme disease,

1798
01:45:06,561 --> 01:45:10,340
I walked around having to convince people
that I had that Lyme disease is really

1799
01:45:10,341 --> 01:45:14,270
common though I don't understand,
but it just depends on what that per,

1800
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:15,560
what that particular,

1801
01:45:15,561 --> 01:45:19,100
I'll use the term what that particular
health care provider has run into,

1802
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:22,460
and you go in and say like,
oh, I'm not feeling so hot.
You know, and this and that.

1803
01:45:22,461 --> 01:45:25,070
I think I got Lyme disease.
It's just like not,

1804
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:28,940
I think if you're in Hudson Valley
in New York, you're going to walk in,

1805
01:45:28,941 --> 01:45:30,560
they're going to be like, hell
yeah, you got Lyme disease.

1806
01:45:30,561 --> 01:45:33,350
But in some places they're going to be
like, Eh, I don't know what you got.

1807
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:35,440
Is it a weird,
when you talk to some dot,

1808
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:39,200
I mean there's doctors are dismissive of
things like real dismissive and then it

1809
01:45:39,201 --> 01:45:43,250
turns out that you were right.
That's got to be infuriating. So

1810
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:47,210
that's what I ran into and I,
and I've told the story a thousand times,

1811
01:45:47,211 --> 01:45:52,160
but when my boy, we got tricked, thank
God he didn't get trick and he got limes.

1812
01:45:52,161 --> 01:45:54,680
He's, he and I got Lyme disease at
the same time, fish and blue gills.

1813
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:57,200
And He,

1814
01:45:58,170 --> 01:46:01,220
I was at my mom's in Michigan,
my mom comes up,

1815
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:03,950
she was swimming with the boy and the
mom was on the same lake I grew up on and

1816
01:46:03,951 --> 01:46:07,010
she was swimming with the boy down
the lake and she comes up and says,

1817
01:46:07,011 --> 01:46:10,710
why is his belly button? I'll
read like this. I'm like,

1818
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:13,130
I can't tell what happened there.
And it turned into one of those bowls.

1819
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:17,240
I rashes my wife,
I send my wife a text image,

1820
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:22,160
the text message picture of this thing
and my wife right away. It's like,

1821
01:46:22,161 --> 01:46:24,010
I wonder if he's got limes. He's,
it looks like one of those bulls,

1822
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:25,850
bulls eye rashes.
They talk about Lyme disease.

1823
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:31,040
So she tells me send it to
his pediatrician because
I had him at my mom's,

1824
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:32,750
you know, she wasn't there. She's
like, send it to his pediatrician.

1825
01:46:32,751 --> 01:46:35,070
I sent this pediatrician and be like,
we're worried about what he's got line.

1826
01:46:35,071 --> 01:46:36,290
She's like, well, just keep an eye on it,

1827
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:39,740
but you don't keep an eye on those things
to those things just go away like they

1828
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:42,710
don't last forever. Right. So
all of a sudden then it's gone.

1829
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:48,070
But clearly he had it and so then we wind
up going down there because then gets

1830
01:46:49,281 --> 01:46:51,530
another one somewhere else and
we'd go down and we're like,

1831
01:46:51,531 --> 01:46:54,560
we're really concerned he's got Lyme
because he gets this bullseye rash and

1832
01:46:54,561 --> 01:46:56,480
you're like, well where is it? I'm
like, well, it's not there now,

1833
01:46:56,481 --> 01:47:00,490
but it was there and he keeps talking
about this, that and the earthing,

1834
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:01,790
different symptoms he's having.

1835
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:06,750
We take them in three times
each time bringing up,

1836
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:08,760
I fear that this is
what's going on with him.

1837
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:12,030
When we pull them out of the bathtub
for whatever reason and the hot water,

1838
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:15,990
he's got these damn circles all over
them, but they kind of go away. You know,

1839
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:20,050
eventually he's got bell's Palsy,
he'd take a sip of milk,

1840
01:47:20,051 --> 01:47:21,840
is milk route at the corner of his mouth,
you know,

1841
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:24,510
and we go in there like holy shit,

1842
01:47:24,511 --> 01:47:28,110
he's got Lyme disease now at this point
it's been going on for weeks. You know?

1843
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:30,720
And what's funny is this place,

1844
01:47:30,721 --> 01:47:34,590
his pediatrician has a newsletter
and they had a newsletter article.

1845
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:40,490
There was about Lyme hysteria about how
everyone is so hysterical about Lyme

1846
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:44,620
being like don't really need
to worry about it. You know,

1847
01:47:44,621 --> 01:47:48,880
everybody's getting hysterical about Lyme.
Like it's the new bogey man, you know?

1848
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,750
So in this altercation we have
with the pediatrician, I'm like,

1849
01:47:52,780 --> 01:47:57,780
I feel that your lime hysteria thinking
in your lime history article kind of

1850
01:47:57,821 --> 01:48:00,400
colored your impression of
what I'm telling you when I'm,

1851
01:48:00,401 --> 01:48:01,570
when we're coming in
and you're telling you,

1852
01:48:01,571 --> 01:48:04,630
and we had to self diagnose our child.
At which point they said,

1853
01:48:04,631 --> 01:48:08,020
I want to have someone else in the
room during this discussion. They,

1854
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:10,150
they said that have it goes,
we were pissed.

1855
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:13,660
Well you easily could have sued the shit
out of them if you were so inclined.

1856
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:17,350
I listen and I don't want her, I'm
thinking of that stuff. But I mean I,

1857
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:20,500
I was like, I entertained all kinds
of ideas if he didn't get better,

1858
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:25,510
but he responded so quickly to medication
the, uh, but it, it was unbelievable.

1859
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:28,660
And meanwhile I had all the same stuff
and I thought it was psychosomatic.

1860
01:48:28,661 --> 01:48:32,920
I wound up having to do the intravenous
stuff. You know, Doherty, he was real,

1861
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:34,810
he was in the hospital lime meningitis.

1862
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:38,210
Well when I ran into you when the
last time we went hunting together,

1863
01:48:38,211 --> 01:48:40,100
you were really skinny and I was like,
dude,

1864
01:48:40,101 --> 01:48:42,980
you look like you lost a lot of weight.
I lost a ton of weight during all that.

1865
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:45,050
You told me the whole story.
I was even trying to drink like,

1866
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:46,850
like milkshakes and stuff.

1867
01:48:46,851 --> 01:48:51,200
Like I was like not at GNC trying to
like do stuff and we or all those guys,

1868
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:53,810
the guys in wilderness
athletes sending me like home.

1869
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:58,070
I'm just trying to do anything I can
do to put on weight. Wow. There was a,

1870
01:48:58,071 --> 01:49:00,440
it knocked my dick in
the dirt bag, man. I bet.

1871
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:03,740
I've heard nothing but horror stories
about people getting Lyme disease.

1872
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:06,740
I'm nothing but horror stories. It's
just it. And then not only that,

1873
01:49:06,741 --> 01:49:09,090
your body doesn't really
ever get rid of it, right?

1874
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:13,660
No, it's unclear. You
know? And if you like the,

1875
01:49:13,661 --> 01:49:15,410
the medical,
the established.

1876
01:49:16,210 --> 01:49:16,750
Okay.

1877
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:19,660
Scholarly consensus online.
I think it's still this,

1878
01:49:19,661 --> 01:49:22,450
that there's no such thing as chronic
Lyme is what they'll say is what,

1879
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:25,470
when I say they, I mean like the, the
medical establishment will say that.

1880
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:27,010
Yeah.

1881
01:49:27,010 --> 01:49:28,990
That chronic Lyme doesn't exist,

1882
01:49:29,380 --> 01:49:33,100
that there's Lyme disease and when you go
through treatment, like what I did the,

1883
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:35,170
the 28 day intravenous deal,

1884
01:49:35,171 --> 01:49:37,750
they put a line that goes in your arm
up to your heart and you inject these

1885
01:49:37,751 --> 01:49:39,850
syringes in it.
Like when you get done with that,

1886
01:49:39,851 --> 01:49:42,370
you do not have those
bacteria in your body anymore.

1887
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:46,420
If you go to a Lyme specialist and you
tell live specials, I have chronic Lyme,

1888
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:52,210
I met one, I tried to get in to see one
of these live specialist and she said,

1889
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:55,450
category,
I don't see Lyme chronic Lyme patients.

1890
01:49:56,620 --> 01:50:01,390
I see a cute line patients
and I had already done one
round of antibiotics and I

1891
01:50:01,391 --> 01:50:03,760
got worse during the round
of oral and she's like, oh,

1892
01:50:03,761 --> 01:50:07,420
your chronic Lyme meaning like,
oh, it's all in your head. Why?

1893
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:09,700
So I go to another
infectious disease person.

1894
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:12,130
I was talking to them and they said,
well, it's like, it just seems kind of,

1895
01:50:12,131 --> 01:50:14,290
it's an urban chronic
lines and urban legend.

1896
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,220
My finding wound up in some way,

1897
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:20,260
bearing out what she said would
happen where I finished the stuff.

1898
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:24,280
I think I got done with it sometime in
September and by November my symptoms are

1899
01:50:24,281 --> 01:50:28,450
gone. That's me. My boy
got better. But I've met,

1900
01:50:28,451 --> 01:50:32,680
I've since then met all of the people
who are very credible individuals,

1901
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:33,060
you know,

1902
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:37,090
who are not hysterical people who've
been through various rounds of treatment

1903
01:50:37,091 --> 01:50:39,100
and they're not getting better.

1904
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:44,380
The are like the arthritic
stuff and limes. Such a weird
thing. Like with my kid,

1905
01:50:44,381 --> 01:50:47,740
you can't argue with bell's Palsy,
it's just right there.

1906
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,740
But other stuff like folks who don't
know what that means, if it's paralysis,

1907
01:50:50,890 --> 01:50:52,100
facial paralysis.
Yeah.

1908
01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:55,450
I mean he had like bad facial paralysis
so you can't argue with it. Right.

1909
01:50:55,451 --> 01:50:57,130
It's just like glaring.
And that's one of the key.

1910
01:50:57,131 --> 01:50:59,650
That's one of the bulls eye rash,
Bell's palsy.

1911
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:04,570
But there's all these other things
like a arthritic pain. Okay. Um,

1912
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:05,433
fatigue.

1913
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:08,890
They don't think a lot of people think
that all the time they were diagnosing.

1914
01:51:08,891 --> 01:51:13,270
Chronic fatigue syndrome was people
with limes, people, Lyme disease.

1915
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:16,890
My friend's dad got it from the,

1916
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:21,930
from getting vaccinated. They used to
have a vaccination against Lyme disease.

1917
01:51:22,140 --> 01:51:23,010
But the problem with it,

1918
01:51:23,011 --> 01:51:27,570
a small percentage of people that go
up vaccination would have some genetic

1919
01:51:27,571 --> 01:51:32,571
marker that would make them predisposed
to getting fucking Lyme disease from

1920
01:51:32,581 --> 01:51:35,370
this vaccine. He's guy was
terrified to getting Lyme disease,

1921
01:51:35,371 --> 01:51:39,660
gets a vaccination against Lyme disease,
got Lyme disease from the vaccination,

1922
01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:42,270
and then they stopped making
the Lyme disease vaccination.

1923
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:46,020
So this poor guy has fucking Lyme
disease and he's still fucked up.

1924
01:51:46,021 --> 01:51:48,900
He's an old guy. It's her
dad and he's, you know,

1925
01:51:48,901 --> 01:51:51,330
he's jacked from this fucking vaccination.

1926
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:55,100
I haven't checked this from multiple
sources. I just heard this or read this,

1927
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:59,560
that, um, couple of interesting
facts about Lyme is one,

1928
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:02,480
when my son and I both got it, I
remember being like, what are the odds?

1929
01:52:02,481 --> 01:52:05,870
Because you'd read that one or 2%
of ticks carry Lyme. So I'm like,

1930
01:52:05,871 --> 01:52:10,871
we would have had to have been covered
in hundreds of ticks for both of us to

1931
01:52:11,691 --> 01:52:12,600
have,
you know,

1932
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:16,310
statistically for both of us that have
gone without even seeing any ticks. Like,

1933
01:52:16,311 --> 01:52:19,550
how could this be? Now later read
the, in that area in New York,

1934
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:21,020
an area in Hudson valley,

1935
01:52:21,021 --> 01:52:26,021
they'd done some stuff for 60 or 70%
of the ticks have Lyme and they used to

1936
01:52:26,181 --> 01:52:30,890
chronicle 30,000 confirmed cases.
You know,

1937
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:31,753
every year,

1938
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:36,470
I think last summer they were
close to 300,000 this is blown up.

1939
01:52:36,471 --> 01:52:39,110
It is not so much that is
blowing up in new places.

1940
01:52:39,111 --> 01:52:42,920
It's just that is becoming like
much more common in other places.

1941
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:46,160
Isn't there a direct correlation
between overpopulation of deer

1942
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:47,420
and and these ticks?

1943
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:50,930
Some people say that because it's
like in that things lifespan,

1944
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:51,950
you know it gets on deer,

1945
01:52:51,951 --> 01:52:56,120
but I've heard all their things that even
just like rodents, you know, so like,

1946
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:59,030
like smaller furred animals.
I'm not really clear on that man.

1947
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:02,840
I don't really know. I know that
when you look at places that have it,

1948
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:04,700
you look at places that
have a lot of deer,

1949
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:07,550
but I don't know if if you
had a third as many deer,

1950
01:53:07,551 --> 01:53:11,180
if you'd have higher or lower or if you'd
have necessarily lower infection rates.

1951
01:53:11,181 --> 01:53:12,950
I can't answer that. But
Doug, Darren, who you know,

1952
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:16,440
I think last summer
twice he got put on the,

1953
01:53:16,441 --> 01:53:20,720
the immediate antibiotics because now
when you find one of those ticks buried in

1954
01:53:20,721 --> 01:53:24,410
yet, if you go into a doctor and if
you're not weird about medication,

1955
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:28,190
the doctors is going to give you
a super heavy dose of antibiotics.

1956
01:53:28,190 --> 01:53:32,000
It kills it before it gets a hold of you.
If you wait like I did,

1957
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:35,330
it gets into your nervous system.
So I even had,

1958
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:41,470
I even had for a day I had amnesia where
I'm sitting at my desk and I get up to

1959
01:53:44,091 --> 01:53:47,930
do something and I sit back down and
I didn't know who wrote what's on my

1960
01:53:47,931 --> 01:53:50,960
computer. Whoa. I started,

1961
01:53:51,110 --> 01:53:54,140
I knew I had to write about a subject
cause I knew that before the Amnesia

1962
01:53:54,141 --> 01:53:55,130
kicked,
I lost the whole day.

1963
01:53:55,131 --> 01:53:59,270
I lost like eight hours of time and I
knew that I was supposed to write about a

1964
01:53:59,271 --> 01:54:02,960
subject and here was a thing on
my computer about that subject.

1965
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:05,150
I started taking sentences.

1966
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:06,890
Okay.

1967
01:54:06,890 --> 01:54:09,020
And our first,
I took a big block,

1968
01:54:09,021 --> 01:54:14,021
like a paragraph of text and put it
into Google to try to find how I cut and

1969
01:54:15,621 --> 01:54:16,454
paste,

1970
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:21,730
how I managed to cut and paste an article
on the subject I was supposed to be

1971
01:54:22,131 --> 01:54:26,450
writing about into a word document,
but there's no match.

1972
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:31,930
Then I just started taking like little
blocks of words in quotes and there's no

1973
01:54:32,091 --> 01:54:34,880
match. I'm like, this is not from online.

1974
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:40,010
Then I start thinking that one of the guys
I work with, I thought this Guy Jared,

1975
01:54:40,011 --> 01:54:42,470
Andrew Candace who was near
there who works at CPC,

1976
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:45,650
I started thinking that he somehow
is playing some joke on you were.

1977
01:54:45,651 --> 01:54:49,370
He came and wrote about what I was
supposed to write about on my desk.

1978
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:50,390
I also have a book,

1979
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:54,980
one of my favorite books called hunt
high by Dunkin Gilchrist and on I had

1980
01:54:54,981 --> 01:54:59,630
written a Mark Boardman Vortex
optics. Okay. I look at the book.

1981
01:54:59,631 --> 01:55:02,870
I know the book.
I know who mark Bormann is,

1982
01:55:02,871 --> 01:55:07,190
but I can't imagine why Mark Boardman's
name would be on a sticky note on that

1983
01:55:07,191 --> 01:55:10,250
book and I look at my other hand.
On my hand,

1984
01:55:10,251 --> 01:55:14,420
I have l o p written an lop
is a term length of pull,

1985
01:55:14,421 --> 01:55:18,950
it's a firearm term and a guy wanted a
length of pull off a firearm and I row

1986
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:23,000
lop on my hand. I looked at my hand
like I didn't know who put that there,

1987
01:55:23,001 --> 01:55:25,040
how long it had been there,
what it meant.

1988
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:28,910
And I tried to go home and couldn't
get home. He couldn't figure it out.

1989
01:55:28,911 --> 01:55:32,600
I got on the wrong train, got off at the
wrong spot. We were living in Brooklyn,

1990
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:36,650
got off at the wrong spot,
came up, recognized a sport,

1991
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:40,770
recognize the like a sporting goods'
like a sports place called a camera.

1992
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:43,700
It doesn't matter what it's calling
a sporting his place and um,

1993
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,720
call my wife and told
her that's where I was.

1994
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:49,620
And then all of a sudden things started
making more and more and more and more

1995
01:55:49,621 --> 01:55:53,910
sense. Wow. Dude, it was wild,
man. I thought I was dying.

1996
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:55,380
I thought I was dying.

1997
01:55:56,490 --> 01:55:59,430
We did an episode of that.
Uh, Joe Rogan questions,

1998
01:55:59,431 --> 01:56:01,510
everything show on more jelly beans.

1999
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:05,600
More Jones is this disease
that most doctors dismissed.

2000
01:56:05,601 --> 01:56:09,870
They think that the people
that are saying they have this,

2001
01:56:09,871 --> 01:56:11,790
that there's something wrong
with them psychologically,

2002
01:56:11,791 --> 01:56:14,370
that they have some sort
of a psychosomatic issue.

2003
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:17,610
And that what they're really doing is
scratching themselves until they create

2004
01:56:17,611 --> 01:56:18,900
these abscesses.
And,

2005
01:56:19,170 --> 01:56:22,950
and then sometimes even putting things
in their skin and then claiming that

2006
01:56:22,951 --> 01:56:26,550
these things have been growing out of
their skin because they found like carpet

2007
01:56:26,551 --> 01:56:31,320
fibers and stuff in their skin that
these people sent in. Uh, but then, um,

2008
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:35,400
when we went to these conferences where
these people would meet that have this

2009
01:56:35,401 --> 01:56:36,234
more challenge issue,

2010
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:39,300
he realized you're also talking about
some seriously educated people and some of

2011
01:56:39,301 --> 01:56:40,230
them,
their doctors.

2012
01:56:40,231 --> 01:56:43,950
And one of the doctors that we talked
to said there's a direct correlation

2013
01:56:43,951 --> 01:56:46,890
between more gentleman's disease
in people who have Lyme disease.

2014
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:51,980
I was all right. And what he said is very
intelligent guys. What does an a nutter?

2015
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:57,140
And what he said is that he believes that
there was a neurotoxic effect that you

2016
01:56:58,231 --> 01:57:01,020
get from Lyme disease,
from some strains of Lyme disease.

2017
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:03,990
Cause the way he said was, if you
look at Lyme disease, he goes,

2018
01:57:03,991 --> 01:57:07,140
you're not looking at like if,
if a tick infects you,

2019
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:09,480
you're not looking at just Lyme disease.

2020
01:57:09,481 --> 01:57:12,480
But it's possible you might've
gotten 10 different. Oh yeah man,

2021
01:57:12,481 --> 01:57:14,190
I learned about a lot of that stuff.
Yeah.

2022
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:19,220
And that one of those 10 different things
is causing this neurotoxic effect that

2023
01:57:19,291 --> 01:57:21,330
literally is making you go crazy.

2024
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:24,810
So when these doctors are examining these
people and they said, oh they're crazy,

2025
01:57:24,811 --> 01:57:28,590
they think that carpet fibers are
growing out of their skin. No,

2026
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:33,620
they have Lyme disease and the Lyme
disease along with all this other shit is

2027
01:57:33,661 --> 01:57:35,280
causing this neurotoxic effect.

2028
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:38,670
And that is what's making them think that
there's something wrong with your skin.

2029
01:57:38,671 --> 01:57:41,130
So it's not that they're just crazy.

2030
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:43,770
I said they have a disease
as making them go crazy.

2031
01:57:43,771 --> 01:57:46,860
And that was pretty illuminating because
this guy was talking about like seeing

2032
01:57:46,861 --> 01:57:51,270
things like seeing like worms underneath
his skin or eyes when he's looking in

2033
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:55,500
the mirror. And he goes, and I knew it
wasn't there, but I'm seeing it anyway.

2034
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:58,020
And he goes,
I could feel it moving across my eye.

2035
01:57:58,140 --> 01:58:00,210
But then there was nothing there.
And he's like,

2036
01:58:00,211 --> 01:58:04,680
and it was pretty clear to me as a doctor
that there was something going on with

2037
01:58:04,681 --> 01:58:08,220
my mind. Nope. That had a direct
correlation between this disease.

2038
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:09,990
So all these people that
have this more jealous,

2039
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:11,880
they also have this Lyme disease.

2040
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:14,450
You know, I don't know if
Dan Dodi told her about this,

2041
01:58:14,451 --> 01:58:19,451
but he all of a sudden
has this excruciating neck
pain and he goes down to a

2042
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:22,890
emergency room.
This is the same time this is going on.

2043
01:58:22,891 --> 01:58:25,310
When he goes down an emergency
room, it's like, oh, he got like,

2044
01:58:25,311 --> 01:58:28,730
they give him some muscle relaxers or
something and he comes back home when it

2045
01:58:28,731 --> 01:58:29,900
gets worse than weirder.

2046
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:33,260
He goes down to another place
and they tell him the same thing.

2047
01:58:33,261 --> 01:58:37,580
He got pinched nerve and, and we're
text message and about, I was like, Hey,

2048
01:58:37,581 --> 01:58:41,920
what's going on? You know, high
feeling. And I remember that when I was

2049
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,350
finally talking to a law,
a person knew about Lyme.

2050
01:58:44,410 --> 01:58:48,370
They kept telling me to move my neck
and see if it hurt and I told Dorothy,

2051
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:49,830
I said, you know what?
When I was down there,

2052
01:58:49,831 --> 01:58:53,890
they kept asking me to move my head is my
neck feel weird, go down to that place.

2053
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,410
So he just leaves his one doctor,

2054
01:58:57,310 --> 01:59:02,310
takes a cab down to this place where I
had gone and they admit him and he had

2055
01:59:02,801 --> 01:59:05,320
meningitis, was spent out in the
hall, you know, four or five,

2056
01:59:05,321 --> 01:59:06,460
six days in the hospital,

2057
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:11,940
wound up with the picc line and meningitis
from Lyme and Zaydis whoa cause in in

2058
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:14,620
your like an infection
in your spinal fluid.

2059
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:17,710
I have a friend who died from that died
from meningitis. He went to the hospital,

2060
01:59:17,711 --> 01:59:21,130
went into the emergency room and he was a,
he was a comic and he was,

2061
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:24,520
he's one of these, he was real busy
and you're just like fuck this place.

2062
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,740
They're making me wait too long. I'm
leaving. And he got out of there,

2063
01:59:26,741 --> 01:59:30,520
got on a plane, flew to
Hawaii. When he got to Hawaii
he was dying. It's all right.

2064
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:32,950
By the time he got there. It
was too late. I was, yeah,

2065
01:59:32,951 --> 01:59:36,880
I was scared cause I remember but there's,
I guess there's different forms.

2066
01:59:36,881 --> 01:59:37,571
There's been anyways,
his,

2067
01:59:37,571 --> 01:59:41,790
they did a spinal tap and you know he
was all messed up and meningitis is

2068
01:59:41,810 --> 01:59:46,420
subscale. Sean, I've had some of the
weird, in the last three or four years

2069
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:51,100
I've had just some of the weirdest
like freaky health things,

2070
01:59:51,130 --> 01:59:54,820
but they're parasites. Mandy,
you've had giardia or something.

2071
01:59:54,821 --> 01:59:58,830
I got a colon infection from water and
that was from the other show, right?

2072
01:59:58,890 --> 02:00:03,100
That was from like wow. Within, no,
that was doing meat eater. So I had,

2073
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:06,760
I like, I got really bad poison
oak was on steroids for that,

2074
02:00:06,761 --> 02:00:11,761
but also got some kind of waterborne
parasite and then the steroids combat your

2075
02:00:12,851 --> 02:00:14,170
ability to fight infection.

2076
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:17,050
I want up in the hospital when
I'm like shit in my own couch.

2077
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:22,660
My wife's like, I was like, listen, you
know there's nothing now. She's like,

2078
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:25,870
I felt bad about like having you be there
when I was having babies. She's like,

2079
02:00:25,871 --> 02:00:29,890
you got, I got, you got dusted
off and you know your own coach.

2080
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:35,500
So I couldn't even tell when
it was happening, you know?

2081
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:39,010
Wow. I thought, oh man. Again, I
thought I was gonna die. So anyways,

2082
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:42,010
I just had like just the weirdest stuff.

2083
02:00:43,050 --> 02:00:44,920
[inaudible]
he's like,

2084
02:00:44,921 --> 02:00:49,540
you need to go to a shaman because he
thinks that there's some thing like I need

2085
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:50,374
to have like,

2086
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:55,120
like there's some sin I committed
against the universe or something and he

2087
02:00:55,121 --> 02:00:56,890
thinks I need to go to
a sham and to get right.

2088
02:00:56,891 --> 02:01:01,030
Doty did too much t he did too much DMT.
Trust me,

2089
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:05,320
you can do too much. You gotta you gotta
be careful with the fucking IOWASCA.

2090
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:10,810
That's hilarious. That whole Sharman
things she says is a real trip.

2091
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:12,040
You know,

2092
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:16,450
the whole going to the jungle and
taking that medication and having these

2093
02:01:16,451 --> 02:01:17,650
spiritual experiences,

2094
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:21,160
it'll get you convinced that everything's
all tied together and that somehow or

2095
02:01:21,161 --> 02:01:23,740
another you've committed some sort
of a sin against the university.

2096
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:26,860
I gotta I gotta let you talk to, I can't
even, I don't want to speak for the boy.

2097
02:01:26,861 --> 02:01:30,150
I'm already talked about them too much.
I think Jody. Yeah, no, we'll Doty.

2098
02:01:30,151 --> 02:01:30,761
And I had a long,

2099
02:01:30,761 --> 02:01:35,020
extensive conversation about his IOWASCA
experience and I've never done Iowasca

2100
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:38,620
but I've done DMT many times. I did it
again recently, did it last weekend.

2101
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:40,610
And the,
the DMT

2102
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:45,610
experiences essentially what Iowasca
is a orally active version of DMT.

2103
02:01:45,790 --> 02:01:49,430
Okay. Because the Amazon Shaman
and the people is derived,

2104
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:52,410
it's from two different plants.
Okay. Well what are those little,

2105
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:53,360
the first thing about this stuff,

2106
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:57,890
DMT is dimethyltryptamine and it exists
in thousands of different plants.

2107
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:00,140
And the reason why you don't get it,

2108
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:03,230
like you don't get high when you eat
it is cause your stomach produces mano

2109
02:02:03,231 --> 02:02:07,010
aiming oxidate. So Mano
Aiming Oxidase, um,

2110
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:10,660
what you need to do is take an inhibitor
so that you could get it in an orderly,

2111
02:02:10,690 --> 02:02:11,900
an orally active form.

2112
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:15,140
So most of the time when most people
get DMT with they're getting is the

2113
02:02:15,141 --> 02:02:19,370
synthesized version where
they've taking, um, a coach,

2114
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:21,500
you're a Veritas or all
these different plants.

2115
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:26,280
They've extracted it down to the
DMT and then you smoke it. Um,

2116
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:30,850
and what they do in the
Amazon, it's regulated in the
u s or not, it's illegal. Oh,

2117
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:34,730
schedule one. The issue was scheduled
with it being a drug though,

2118
02:02:34,731 --> 02:02:39,080
is that exists in so many different forms.
You would have to make grass illegal.

2119
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:42,260
I got like if you had flareups,
grass growing in your front lawn,

2120
02:02:42,410 --> 02:02:47,410
you essentially have a schedule run
drug growing on your lawn in massive

2121
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:51,200
quantities. So it can't be
enforced. It's a weird but,

2122
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:52,970
but if they find the powder,

2123
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:56,780
if they find it synthesized and turned
into a powder that you could smoke and

2124
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:59,630
freebase then it's illegal and
then it's a schedule one drug.

2125
02:02:59,631 --> 02:03:01,790
But it exists in your own
human neuro chemistry.

2126
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:06,390
It's like making saliva illegal with
you. Literally that ridiculous. Um,

2127
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:11,560
the Amazon Shaman have figured out a way
to take the vine of one plant and the

2128
02:03:12,051 --> 02:03:15,350
roots and the leaves of another
and they boil them together.

2129
02:03:15,351 --> 02:03:16,820
So essentially they use harming,

2130
02:03:16,821 --> 02:03:21,020
which is a natural Mao inhibitor and
they combine it with this plant and they

2131
02:03:21,021 --> 02:03:23,900
boil it into this potion
and that's what Iowasca is.

2132
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:27,380
So it's DMT and an Mao inhibitor
together and this elixir,

2133
02:03:27,381 --> 02:03:32,381
you drink it and you have see what's
close to this smoked DMT experience as you

2134
02:03:32,751 --> 02:03:37,310
can get a but not quite as
potent, but it's not, it's not,

2135
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:41,420
there's not a synthetic version
of IOWASCA. No, no, no. Well,

2136
02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:46,250
like it's all extracted from plants like
DMT has is not like they don't produce

2137
02:03:46,251 --> 02:03:49,820
it in land. Thank you can produce
it in a lab. I think you can,

2138
02:03:49,821 --> 02:03:54,080
but the precursors of it are very
tightly controlled by the DEA.

2139
02:03:54,081 --> 02:03:54,914
Like you can't,

2140
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:58,010
like if they found out that you were
buying a certain amount of this chemical

2141
02:03:58,011 --> 02:04:00,980
that you would use to make the synthetic
version of it, they would flag you.

2142
02:04:01,030 --> 02:04:05,510
Gotcha. But the plants are
legal, so you could go online.

2143
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:08,930
There was a guy that got arrested and
they took all of his money and locked him

2144
02:04:08,931 --> 02:04:10,460
up in jail because it was,

2145
02:04:10,670 --> 02:04:14,160
I think it was called happy frog
or something like that. One of the,

2146
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:16,430
the name of his company,
I don't remember the name of his company,

2147
02:04:16,431 --> 02:04:19,250
but he sold all these legal plants,

2148
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,800
but the plants were all totally legal,

2149
02:04:21,801 --> 02:04:25,560
but he sold them with the pretense that
you could take these plans and extract

2150
02:04:25,570 --> 02:04:27,320
DMT.
And then he was,

2151
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:30,740
he was arrested for that because he was
putting a and B together for you. Yeah,

2152
02:04:30,770 --> 02:04:34,700
he, well, he was allowing you to
find the source to do it yourself.

2153
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:38,670
But even though what he was selling
was legal, I think he got off,

2154
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:42,150
I'm kind of speaking out of school here
because it was a few years back and I

2155
02:04:42,151 --> 02:04:45,260
didn't totally paid too much
attention to it, but it,

2156
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:49,380
it is in so many different sources.
It is a hallucinogenic.

2157
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:51,420
Yes it will.

2158
02:04:51,421 --> 02:04:55,230
It's a human neurotransmitter
and an incredibly potent drug.

2159
02:04:55,231 --> 02:04:58,430
That's also the most transient
drug ever exist or, uh,

2160
02:04:58,470 --> 02:05:02,640
one of the most transient trucks
ever observed. So if you get,

2161
02:05:02,940 --> 02:05:06,240
like if say if you'd smoked DMT
like I did, like I said last week,

2162
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:11,400
your blasted to the center of the universe
for about 15 minutes and then you're

2163
02:05:11,401 --> 02:05:12,234
back to baseline.

2164
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:15,870
Like you're completely sober in 15 minutes
if your body knows exactly what to do

2165
02:05:15,871 --> 02:05:19,210
with it. Yeah, your body knows exactly
what to do with it because it's,

2166
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:22,480
it's such a normal part of
your chemistry that you're,

2167
02:05:22,530 --> 02:05:27,530
your body can bring it back to
baseline within minutes to weird.

2168
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:30,960
It's the weirdest shit ever.
And the weirdest aspect of is,

2169
02:05:30,961 --> 02:05:32,580
while you're blown out,

2170
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:36,840
like blown out in this
intense psychedelic state,

2171
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:40,570
you immediately think, I'm here all
the time. I've been here before. Oh,

2172
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:44,430
I know what this is. It does. It's
not unfamiliar. It's completely alien,

2173
02:05:44,431 --> 02:05:45,780
but yet familiar at the same time.

2174
02:05:46,230 --> 02:05:50,310
So Doty in all those Iowasca experiences
that he had when he was talking about

2175
02:05:50,311 --> 02:05:52,200
all these flashbacks
and all this craziness.

2176
02:05:52,770 --> 02:05:55,530
What happens is you open up this,

2177
02:05:55,680 --> 02:06:00,090
it's a weird effect where if you do DMT
and you have these powerful experiences,

2178
02:06:00,091 --> 02:06:05,091
you open up this door and I don't know
what the chemical effect of it is or what

2179
02:06:06,871 --> 02:06:07,860
the mechanism is,

2180
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:12,060
but something happens when you open up
that door where you can open up that door

2181
02:06:12,061 --> 02:06:13,680
again,
even in a dream.

2182
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:18,200
And so the speculation is that what,
what,

2183
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:21,990
what happens when people have
like near death experiences,

2184
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:24,090
when people have alien
abduction experiences,

2185
02:06:24,091 --> 02:06:26,460
when people have these crazy
things they say happened to them,

2186
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:31,050
most likely what it is is some sort
of a weird and dodginess dump of DMT.

2187
02:06:31,051 --> 02:06:31,710
Like you know,

2188
02:06:31,710 --> 02:06:34,410
something can happen to you when
you get this crazy adrenaline rush.

2189
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:38,400
They believe that it's possible that
something can happen to you and you get a

2190
02:06:38,401 --> 02:06:41,120
crazy DMT rush and that it's,
it's,

2191
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:43,650
it's very difficult to access,

2192
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:46,410
but that it's a function of
the brand is causing you to,

2193
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:49,410
for lack of a better word,
is causing you to trip. Yes.

2194
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:53,730
But you might perceive it as a memory.
You could perceive it at,

2195
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:58,760
well it feels as real if not more real
than reality itself cause it's intensely

2196
02:06:58,981 --> 02:07:03,600
colored and brightly lit and the,
there's no borders to things.

2197
02:07:03,601 --> 02:07:06,900
But yet there are, it's very,
very, very difficult to describe.

2198
02:07:06,901 --> 02:07:10,470
I'm doing a terrible job
describing it and all around you.

2199
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:15,240
It's alive with entities
and these entities are
communicating with you both with

2200
02:07:15,241 --> 02:07:19,790
sound and with visual cues. It's
a very, very, very weird trip. Uh,

2201
02:07:19,850 --> 02:07:24,810
you think in a negative way or if you try
to control it are like literally shake

2202
02:07:24,811 --> 02:07:27,060
their finger at,
you can go into an an an an an anonymous,

2203
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:32,010
but then if you get it right, it calms
down. Like it's, it's like a lesson.

2204
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:36,220
How to think. It's a very,
very bizarre, bizarre trip.

2205
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:39,250
The most bizarre at of all
the psychedelics, by far,

2206
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:43,870
the way I describe it is mushrooms
times a million plus aliens. Yeah,

2207
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:46,690
it's the Mandalah.
It's the center of the,

2208
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:49,480
of the Mandala of all this
is Mckenna described it,

2209
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:54,030
the Mandalah of all the different
psychedelic experiences,
the center of it, the,

2210
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:57,670
the literally the fucking 0.0.

2211
02:07:57,850 --> 02:08:01,540
The event horizon of that is
DMT. So do you feel like, uh,

2212
02:08:02,330 --> 02:08:04,150
to to,
to do it,

2213
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:08,090
do you feel like you're being
recreational or constructive construct?

2214
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:11,710
I try not to do anything recreationally.
I smoke a little weed recreationally,

2215
02:08:11,711 --> 02:08:16,380
have a drink recreationally.
But I think psychedelic experiences there,

2216
02:08:16,410 --> 02:08:20,860
so beneficial. I've gotten so much benefit
out of them that I don't, I don't like,

2217
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:22,210
I feel like it'd be,

2218
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:26,950
it'd be a waste to do you mean like
personally or as a performer? Personally.

2219
02:08:27,010 --> 02:08:31,180
Personally, yeah. Well, as a performer,
you know, eventually, personally,

2220
02:08:31,181 --> 02:08:34,460
first and as a performer I
benefit from the, you know,

2221
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:37,220
whatever I get out of it
personally because, I mean,

2222
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:39,730
it's all tied together with you,
but you know,

2223
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:41,870
you don't think of funny
jokes or something. No, they,

2224
02:08:41,970 --> 02:08:45,460
the people don't tell you funny jokes that
you can put into your eggs. Nope. Nope,

2225
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:50,170
nope. No. It's all about
correcting your, your bullshit.
It's almost like, all right,

2226
02:08:50,171 --> 02:08:51,280
you haven't been here awhile.
Come on.

2227
02:08:51,281 --> 02:08:54,090
And we've got to say it like go into the
dentist and you ever been to a dentist

2228
02:08:54,091 --> 02:08:54,911
in like two years.

2229
02:08:54,911 --> 02:08:58,610
You're one of those fucking guys sit
down and sit down and they find all kinds

2230
02:08:58,611 --> 02:09:01,540
of got going on here. Oh you got this? Why
are you thinking about this? That, that,

2231
02:09:01,541 --> 02:09:03,970
that, that the, the, the, the, the don't
think about that. That's just stupid.

2232
02:09:03,971 --> 02:09:07,810
You wasted your time thinking it's like
they sort of explained to you w w the

2233
02:09:07,811 --> 02:09:11,530
wasted paths that you're taking
with your thinking and your mind.

2234
02:09:11,531 --> 02:09:13,890
And then even with your actions.
So how long,

2235
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:18,700
how long do the 15 minutes feel
like why did several in a day,

2236
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:19,660
so I did a

2237
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:24,910
three or four 15 minute ones in a row.

2238
02:09:25,690 --> 02:09:29,920
So a, you know, like just blast
off, come back to baseline,

2239
02:09:30,130 --> 02:09:31,510
hit it again. Would you be like, man,

2240
02:09:31,511 --> 02:09:35,740
that was just 15 minutes or would it
feel like you were gone like days now it

2241
02:09:35,741 --> 02:09:40,510
doesn't feel like days. It,
it, it's, it feels like it's,

2242
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:44,560
when you're in the state itself,
it almost feels like time doesn't exist.

2243
02:09:44,561 --> 02:09:48,250
Like you're not seeing it unless
you think about it too much.

2244
02:09:48,251 --> 02:09:50,620
Like sometimes I'll think about like,
I don't want this to end so quick,

2245
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,300
and then they like Dah, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

2246
02:09:52,301 --> 02:09:55,360
Stop thinking all this stupid shit. Like
you're wasting your time. It's like,

2247
02:09:56,190 --> 02:09:59,070
imagine enjoying a great
movie and being like, man,

2248
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:00,340
this movie's going to end soon.

2249
02:10:01,450 --> 02:10:05,170
Movies only 10 minutes in and I know it's
only got an hour and 50 minutes to go.

2250
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:08,440
Shit, I wish it could go on
forever. That's a wasted thought.

2251
02:10:08,470 --> 02:10:12,160
Like why not just be in the moment
and enjoy it? So it's, you know,

2252
02:10:12,161 --> 02:10:17,161
that that expression be in the moment is
like so overdone and hippie and fucking

2253
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:21,400
yoga. Like so many people say things like
that. And it just makes you moan like,

2254
02:10:21,401 --> 02:10:23,080
oh,
he shut the fuck up because it's like,

2255
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:25,600
it's so cliched and
annoying when they say,

2256
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:27,580
I know you're saying there's wisdom in it.

2257
02:10:27,650 --> 02:10:32,650
And unfortunately there's just so many
of these fucking fake spiritual people

2258
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:38,870
that clog up all these words and they
ruined some of these definitions because

2259
02:10:39,050 --> 02:10:42,740
you know, oh, just be in the moment.
Find your center. Oh fuck you. Okay,

2260
02:10:42,741 --> 02:10:43,650
I'm not listening to your car.

2261
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:46,460
Like I used to take yoga from this
guy who was a total bullshit artist.

2262
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:49,340
He was a good yoga instructor,
but he was,

2263
02:10:49,790 --> 02:10:54,500
he was intoxicated by the fact that he
was teaching yoga and then all these

2264
02:10:54,501 --> 02:10:59,030
people came to him and his ego would feed
off of this is yoga class to the point

2265
02:10:59,031 --> 02:11:02,510
where he would say all these things and
you would see people roll their eyes.

2266
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:06,080
Like my wife used to hate
him because he was so cheesy.

2267
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:09,150
And then you'd like kind of hit on the
ladies that would be there and he want it

2268
02:11:09,151 --> 02:11:11,720
fucking some dude's wife.
And it was like a disaster.

2269
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:15,680
Left his wife and she left her husband
and now they're miserable together.

2270
02:11:15,681 --> 02:11:20,570
It's was like he was like a fake spiritual
guy. And these fake spiritual people,

2271
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:25,840
they have this way of ruining a
lot of like really wise notions.

2272
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:28,020
One of them,
yes,

2273
02:11:28,020 --> 02:11:29,850
because they use, they're using it. Yes.

2274
02:11:29,940 --> 02:11:31,590
Tool. Well, you know, it's like,

2275
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:36,540
or they're claiming to be enlightened
when really they're just a student on the

2276
02:11:36,541 --> 02:11:40,140
path and maybe they have some good
ideas along the way to enlightenment,

2277
02:11:40,290 --> 02:11:44,400
but they're not quite there.
You know, there's a lot of
that man. It's like a lot,

2278
02:11:44,450 --> 02:11:48,480
a lot of people searching like this
and these new age type people that are

2279
02:11:48,481 --> 02:11:52,530
searching for some sort of a meaning.
And if you find the wrong Sharman,

2280
02:11:52,531 --> 02:11:57,480
you find the wrong Yogi, find
the wrong guru. You could
go down a bad path. I mean,

2281
02:11:57,481 --> 02:12:02,440
the guy who was the head of Bikram Yoga
is got like all these rape allegations

2282
02:12:02,441 --> 02:12:05,850
of sexual assault allegations.
He drives a fucking Bentley everywhere.

2283
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:11,010
He's loaded, he's got fucking gold
crusted Rolexes. And he's like,

2284
02:12:11,011 --> 02:12:13,770
clearly not a spiritual enlightened guy,

2285
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:16,770
but he's the head of this
whole beek rum movement,

2286
02:12:16,771 --> 02:12:19,680
which is like filled with all
these pseudo spiritual people.

2287
02:12:20,180 --> 02:12:24,760
You know, I was sitting
there one day reading a book,

2288
02:12:25,060 --> 02:12:27,100
reading Al Sharpton's,
most recent books.

2289
02:12:27,510 --> 02:12:30,210
Finally she do the long
story and in Crayon, no,

2290
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:34,330
my agent and my literary agent,

2291
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:38,050
a representative Al Sharpton,
did a book with all sharp.

2292
02:12:38,110 --> 02:12:42,030
So I'm reading and Al Sharpton
Book and I'm sitting there in a,

2293
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:46,540
in a guy's coming down the road walking
a dog and he looks like he's like a

2294
02:12:46,541 --> 02:12:51,190
yachtsman who guy walking a dog is like
clearly a yachtsman like yes, his world.

2295
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:54,910
And he comes up and says to me,
you know,

2296
02:12:54,911 --> 02:12:59,911
you know I had a meeting with him one
time and he came up in a chauffeured car

2297
02:13:02,110 --> 02:13:07,110
and he had a Rolex watch on and he
proceeded to tell me how he lives on a

2298
02:13:07,511 --> 02:13:09,340
$23,000 a year salary.

2299
02:13:10,070 --> 02:13:13,510
It's like wow.
Hoses.

2300
02:13:13,750 --> 02:13:16,570
I don't know how old that story was.
I don't know how true to story was.

2301
02:13:16,630 --> 02:13:20,470
It was Kinda like he was sort of
like pointing out the, you know,

2302
02:13:21,050 --> 02:13:22,350
well there was a guy with a gun,
like a,

2303
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:25,880
like a like an apparent discrepancy
or there's a massive discrepancy.

2304
02:13:25,881 --> 02:13:28,850
There was a guy once it was on this radio
show that I was listening to that was,

2305
02:13:28,851 --> 02:13:32,700
I'm the head of a corporation that was
approached by Jesse Jackson because there

2306
02:13:32,701 --> 02:13:33,330
were some,

2307
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:38,040
something had gone on something where
they're racial insensitivity was,

2308
02:13:38,041 --> 02:13:42,810
you know, was there've been accused
of something that was racial,

2309
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:43,733
racially insensitive.

2310
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:49,010
So Jesse Jackson came on and essentially
the pitch was you are going to hire my

2311
02:13:49,591 --> 02:13:54,591
company to give seminars on racial
sensitivity and it's going to cost you a

2312
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:59,040
quarter million dollars a year and if
you do not, we are going to protest.

2313
02:13:59,041 --> 02:14:00,600
You were going to make it miserable.

2314
02:14:00,601 --> 02:14:05,601
We were going to cost you far more than
it would then you would spend to have my

2315
02:14:06,181 --> 02:14:10,230
company come in the Rainbow Coalition or
whatever the fuck. Isn't that extortion?

2316
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:13,620
It's illegal. It's not
illegal. It isn't. It isn't.

2317
02:14:13,621 --> 02:14:15,600
I mean it is illegal if
you call it extortion.

2318
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:20,750
But what he's essentially saying is
it's within your best interest to align

2319
02:14:20,851 --> 02:14:24,320
yourself with grace out of court
settlement. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

2320
02:14:24,570 --> 02:14:27,270
And out of court settlement that they
profit from it in an incredible way.

2321
02:14:27,271 --> 02:14:28,770
But he had like all these crazy demands,

2322
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:31,320
like he wanted to have
shrimp cocktail like a,

2323
02:14:31,530 --> 02:14:35,970
like Jesse Jackson had all these like
very specific demands as far as the kind

2324
02:14:35,971 --> 02:14:38,970
of food, the amount of food
that he was to be given, what,

2325
02:14:38,971 --> 02:14:40,560
what was supposed to go on.
You know,

2326
02:14:41,070 --> 02:14:43,830
what kind of car he's supposed
to be picked up in. And you know,

2327
02:14:43,831 --> 02:14:47,370
you look at Reverend Jesse Jackson though,
he's a religious man.

2328
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:50,820
Well where's he getting all this
fucking money? He is a wealthy,

2329
02:14:50,821 --> 02:14:55,620
wealthy guy and he's wealthy by
being what they call a race pimp.

2330
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:58,770
And that's how this guy was describing
it. He was like, he's a race pimp.

2331
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:02,700
Like this guy finds these scenarios
where something goes wrong,

2332
02:15:02,701 --> 02:15:06,270
moves in and then extract
money from the situation.

2333
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:09,820
I should send you my al Sharpton Boat.
I won't read it.

2334
02:15:09,930 --> 02:15:12,090
You won't read it because
it's a really good chapter.

2335
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:15,870
Is One really good chapter in
that book where he talks about,

2336
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:21,030
um, how people's positions on
things evolve over the years.

2337
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,380
And I thought that was good.

2338
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:27,380
Then there's a really horrible chapter
where he talks about how his role in

2339
02:15:27,481 --> 02:15:32,460
comforting Michael Jackson's family upon
Michael Jackson's death, or he, he's,

2340
02:15:32,461 --> 02:15:35,360
he's sort of presents himself
as the great hero. And

2341
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:42,420
I think I read, you know, my age was
like, you're the last guy in the world.

2342
02:15:42,421 --> 02:15:47,220
I would expect to read a, um, uh, Sharpton
book, but I tell him, I said, well,

2343
02:15:47,221 --> 02:15:48,960
here's the thing.
That's probably why I'm reading it,

2344
02:15:48,990 --> 02:15:50,950
because all my life I've
heard about this guy. I,

2345
02:15:51,210 --> 02:15:54,450
I really don't understand who
he is or what he does. Well,

2346
02:15:54,451 --> 02:15:56,130
he's just one of these names,
you know,

2347
02:15:56,131 --> 02:15:57,870
it's like almost like
he's always got a name,

2348
02:15:57,871 --> 02:16:01,800
like Peta people hear it
and they roll their eyes.

2349
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:06,390
Do you mean like, it's almost become like,
um, he'd cringe to hear someone say us,

2350
02:16:06,391 --> 02:16:10,020
but it's almost become like, like
he's almost the punchline. Yes.

2351
02:16:10,021 --> 02:16:13,410
He is a friend for so many
people. You know, if somebody
pundits and commentators,

2352
02:16:13,411 --> 02:16:18,150
you know, I realized that I was kind
of a victim of that or not victim mode.

2353
02:16:18,151 --> 02:16:21,000
I was like a doing that. Right. I
couldn't tell you what the guy did.

2354
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:23,730
I couldn't tell you what he stood for.
But you thought of them as a punchline.

2355
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:25,910
Yeah, I just knew that
of him, you know. Well,

2356
02:16:25,910 --> 02:16:30,360
you know the Tawana Brawley the, the
case that got him. Yeah, he wrote,

2357
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:32,600
he talks about that.
Yeah. It was hilarious.

2358
02:16:32,601 --> 02:16:36,520
I mean he represented a woman who made
up a fake allegation of being raped by

2359
02:16:36,521 --> 02:16:39,760
white people and then wrote things on
her body and it turns out none of it

2360
02:16:39,761 --> 02:16:43,690
happened and she just made it all
up and he was demanding, you know,

2361
02:16:43,691 --> 02:16:46,420
justice and all this crazy
shit. And he was, you know,

2362
02:16:46,421 --> 02:16:50,200
on every television show and
all throughout, you know, the,

2363
02:16:50,201 --> 02:16:52,960
the news cases and all
this different shit.

2364
02:16:52,961 --> 02:16:57,100
And it turned out that what he was
doing was just, it was based on,

2365
02:16:57,101 --> 02:17:01,240
nothing was based on all lies.
It was based the entire scenario.

2366
02:17:01,570 --> 02:17:06,200
Jay jetted him into the public
eye. It was a fake scene. Yeah.

2367
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:09,760
I can't tell you whether I read that
in this book or whether one of the many

2368
02:17:09,761 --> 02:17:12,940
people who saw me reading the book and
had to come and give me their 2 cents on

2369
02:17:12,941 --> 02:17:14,460
the subject told me,
well,

2370
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:19,120
it's amazing that the guy became famous
for demanding justice for something that

2371
02:17:19,121 --> 02:17:19,901
never took place,

2372
02:17:19,901 --> 02:17:24,820
but it's a perfect analogy where it's a
perfect representation of who he is and

2373
02:17:24,821 --> 02:17:29,821
also how bizarre our sensitivities
are to race that will,

2374
02:17:29,881 --> 02:17:34,510
this fucking clown is on Msnbc or CNBC
or whatever the fuck he is giving his

2375
02:17:34,511 --> 02:17:38,740
opinions, all these different things and
his opinions are brutally dumb. Like his,

2376
02:17:38,741 --> 02:17:40,800
his way of commuting.
When he asked to communicate,

2377
02:17:40,810 --> 02:17:44,620
we asked to debate people who are
intelligent or nuanced opinions on these

2378
02:17:44,621 --> 02:17:45,760
subjects like his,

2379
02:17:45,790 --> 02:17:50,790
he's clear and obvious bias and his is
cookie cutter idea of racism in America.

2380
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:55,630
Like racism is a real
issue without a doubt.

2381
02:17:55,870 --> 02:18:00,870
But having a guy like that represent the
black community almost fosters racism.

2382
02:18:01,930 --> 02:18:05,680
It's almost like if I was a racist and
I wanted to make sure that people had a

2383
02:18:05,681 --> 02:18:07,090
negative opinion of black people,

2384
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:11,230
I would take the most clownish cartoon
versions of black leaders and feature

2385
02:18:11,231 --> 02:18:16,231
them prominently on television or
reinforce these ideas of these cartoonish

2386
02:18:16,481 --> 02:18:19,360
figures being this is what
represents the black community.

2387
02:18:19,540 --> 02:18:22,900
Isn't the black community silly?
You know, and that's what happens.

2388
02:18:22,901 --> 02:18:25,810
Instead of getting a Neil degrasse Tyson,
a Cornell west,

2389
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:29,830
instead of getting these
super intelligent, very
articulate people with broad,

2390
02:18:30,070 --> 02:18:31,180
broad perspectives,

2391
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:35,200
you get this goofball with a
fucking conked hair and you know,

2392
02:18:35,201 --> 02:18:36,970
a stapled stomach and he's a,

2393
02:18:36,971 --> 02:18:41,971
he's a goofball and he's many thousand
dollars suits on television demanding,

2394
02:18:42,341 --> 02:18:46,320
you know, reparations for slavery.
It's like, come on man, like this is,

2395
02:18:46,321 --> 02:18:50,050
it's almost a set up.
It's almost like the engineer racism.

2396
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:54,820
Jesse Jackson barely can speak English.

2397
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,910
I mean he's obviously an educated guy.
You obviously is articulate,

2398
02:18:57,911 --> 02:19:01,660
but his w if you're a
professional speaker,

2399
02:19:01,661 --> 02:19:02,920
which essentially he is,

2400
02:19:03,520 --> 02:19:08,520
his ability to enunciate words
is so sloppy and so confusing.

2401
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:11,021
It's like,

2402
02:19:11,021 --> 02:19:15,130
do you know how you sound like you
almost sound like you're doing this on

2403
02:19:15,131 --> 02:19:19,170
purpose. You know, when does this, when
you would talk, cause this is like you,

2404
02:19:19,180 --> 02:19:20,380
you listen to him talk.

2405
02:19:20,381 --> 02:19:24,850
It's almost like he's too lazy to say
the words in a way that everyone can

2406
02:19:24,851 --> 02:19:28,070
understand though. There's like a, he
likes the cadence of it in some way.

2407
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:31,100
Yeah. They used to do this. Neil degrasse
Tyson never speak out or does he ever,

2408
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:33,440
have you ever heard him speak on race?
Talking about race?

2409
02:19:33,900 --> 02:19:34,920
I never have heard.

2410
02:19:34,921 --> 02:19:38,890
I'm sorry to hear him talk about what
he talks about professionally. Yeah.

2411
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:43,490
He's talked about some other science based
things. Not just a astrophysics. I've,

2412
02:19:43,491 --> 02:19:47,310
I've heard him speak on genetically
modified foods and some misconceptions.

2413
02:19:47,311 --> 02:19:48,840
Some people. Yeah. Yeah,

2414
02:19:48,870 --> 02:19:51,600
I've heard him speak on some other things
that people have some misconceptions

2415
02:19:51,601 --> 02:19:53,670
of, you know, just sort
of science based stuff.

2416
02:19:53,671 --> 02:19:57,930
But I haven't heard him speak on race.
He's an interesting guy. He's a fun dude

2417
02:19:58,380 --> 02:20:03,300
thing on the incomprehensible
universe. That series. Yeah,

2418
02:20:03,350 --> 02:20:06,140
it's an amazing story. I think it's
like, I think it says what it's called.

2419
02:20:06,420 --> 02:20:10,400
Have you seen the cosmos? The, the,
the new version of it? It's great.

2420
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:14,360
It's great because it also, he made it
very accessible, this version of the con,

2421
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:18,200
like the story of Giordano Bruno,
I think that's his name,

2422
02:20:18,201 --> 02:20:22,250
the guy who was burned at the stake for
suggesting that the universe is infinite

2423
02:20:22,610 --> 02:20:24,410
and that they were like,
why are you fucking crazy bitch?

2424
02:20:24,411 --> 02:20:27,320
We're going to light you on fire
unless you tell it the less you repent,

2425
02:20:27,740 --> 02:20:28,940
that there a brick wall,

2426
02:20:29,270 --> 02:20:32,620
a brick wall out there as a ceiling
out there and behind that is a door and

2427
02:20:32,621 --> 02:20:36,920
God's out there, you know, and he, he was
convinced that it, that wasn't the case,

2428
02:20:36,921 --> 02:20:40,940
but he did the whole Giordano Bruno thing.
He did it in animated form.

2429
02:20:40,970 --> 02:20:44,960
It made an animation of it, which is
fantastic. It also made an animation form,

2430
02:20:44,961 --> 02:20:49,961
which you'll be interested in showing how
wolves became dogs and over the course

2431
02:20:50,811 --> 02:20:55,811
of human civilization evolving how these
wolves who had become friendly with

2432
02:20:55,971 --> 02:21:00,230
people had eventually gotten to the
point where the people were feeding them.

2433
02:21:00,231 --> 02:21:04,370
And the wolf stayed close and then those
wolves had slowly but surely morphed

2434
02:21:04,371 --> 02:21:08,150
into dogs. That's on
cosmos. Yes. Yeah. Amazing.

2435
02:21:08,610 --> 02:21:11,700
There's so much wild stuff coming
out of, um, did you say you,

2436
02:21:11,750 --> 02:21:15,530
do you know about those Russians that
were taken fox taken Fox and this? Yes.

2437
02:21:15,550 --> 02:21:19,090
And selective breeding. I don't know.
Just how fast you can change stuff. Yeah.

2438
02:21:19,830 --> 02:21:23,820
Yeah. Amazing. You can.
Yeah. When you all you,

2439
02:21:23,821 --> 02:21:27,050
all you need to do is look at what
they've done with dogs. You know, the,

2440
02:21:27,150 --> 02:21:30,560
the time that human beings have been mean.

2441
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:35,520
What is the established timeline
for agricultural civilization is?

2442
02:21:35,521 --> 02:21:36,360
What is it?
10,000

2443
02:21:36,550 --> 02:21:39,600
yeah.
10 11,000 years anatomically modern here.

2444
02:21:39,610 --> 02:21:43,180
Like pick your number but 100,000.

2445
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:46,970
Yeah. So in that time,
which is a blink of the eye,

2446
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:52,040
you've made a fucking poodle out of a
wolf. Yeah, man. You've made a Chihuahua

2447
02:21:52,130 --> 02:21:54,470
one for one Americans for first pass.

2448
02:21:54,471 --> 02:21:57,410
And in North America they
weren't like breeds of dogs.

2449
02:21:57,950 --> 02:22:01,090
This is like the dog. They head.
That's crazy. You know, they weren't,

2450
02:22:01,170 --> 02:22:05,710
they didn't have like,
that's 40014001500 not at all.

2451
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:09,560
50 probably some,
I mean it's hotly debated number,

2452
02:22:09,561 --> 02:22:14,561
but sometime between like some for
our oldest sites are 14,000 years,

2453
02:22:15,650 --> 02:22:18,500
but people think there has bee sites we
haven't found or we'll never find that

2454
02:22:18,501 --> 02:22:20,180
are older,
maybe 20,000 years.

2455
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:25,470
But when like, like say when like
Daniel Boone came across America. Oh No,

2456
02:22:25,471 --> 02:22:26,370
they had breeds.

2457
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:27,420
They had breeds.
Oh yeah.

2458
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:31,830
When did they start having like when is
it a standalone? Do you have no idea?

2459
02:22:31,831 --> 02:22:32,760
It's so fascinating.

2460
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:34,890
There's probably like, I'm sure
there's great stuff written about it,

2461
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:36,660
but you know,
like they had,

2462
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:41,010
so when the first Americans
migrated in North America,

2463
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:45,930
they were traveling
with a domestic version,

2464
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:49,020
you know, something that had been
domesticated for quite some time,

2465
02:22:49,050 --> 02:22:52,110
a domestic version of the Eurasian Wolf.

2466
02:22:53,130 --> 02:22:57,300
And then they came down and here
you had a number of wild canines,

2467
02:22:57,840 --> 02:22:58,920
you know,
wools,

2468
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:04,220
which the animal they were traveling
with could breed with wolves.

2469
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:09,390
You now find that in certain cases, wolves
and coyotes, they don't, they don't,

2470
02:23:09,391 --> 02:23:13,530
I don't think they always
put off viable young,

2471
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:18,360
but they do think that there
are hybridization events
between wolves and coyotes.

2472
02:23:18,361 --> 02:23:20,910
So at some point these guys came
down with this Eurasia Wolf.

2473
02:23:20,930 --> 02:23:23,460
There was probably the, almost, certainly
there had been some in, you know,

2474
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:27,030
some inbreeding with wolves
and an out of that stock.

2475
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:28,520
Okay.

2476
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:30,710
Created Lord knows what all you know,

2477
02:23:30,740 --> 02:23:33,980
because by the time Lewis and Clark like
you know when Lewis and Clark were out

2478
02:23:33,981 --> 02:23:36,170
and they were eating dogs,
the plains tribes,

2479
02:23:36,650 --> 02:23:41,650
they had those dogs weren't showing like
there hadn't been dogs that came from

2480
02:23:42,321 --> 02:23:44,240
Europe,
from colonists,

2481
02:23:44,270 --> 02:23:48,320
hadn't put dog blood into the dog blood
and they came and they had a dog that

2482
02:23:48,321 --> 02:23:51,220
looked like, yeah,
other, what they call it.

2483
02:23:51,221 --> 02:23:53,880
Like it looked like what they
now call him Vietnamese Amit dog.

2484
02:23:53,890 --> 02:23:58,840
Like just like a Mutt dog.
Multi like with multiple colors on them.

2485
02:23:59,380 --> 02:24:00,120
There was a recent,
yeah

2486
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:05,120
thing where they've done a genetic study
on certain hybrids where they've found

2487
02:24:05,521 --> 02:24:10,170
a hybrid that's park, coyote, part wolf
and part domestic dog. Is there a, yeah,

2488
02:24:10,280 --> 02:24:12,030
is really recent.
Really rich

2489
02:24:12,450 --> 02:24:16,830
prize. Because one of the things
people look at is a, why are, you know,

2490
02:24:16,890 --> 02:24:20,820
coyotes in the east or just
different, the beggar, you know,

2491
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:22,410
they feel that there's,
that there,

2492
02:24:22,411 --> 02:24:25,380
that there was hybridization
events of wolves and coyotes.

2493
02:24:25,410 --> 02:24:27,360
They gave you kind of like a,
like a bigger cow.

2494
02:24:27,390 --> 02:24:30,170
The East and you have smaller
coyotes in the west. Yeah. This is a,

2495
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:31,740
from the Washington Post,

2496
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:33,210
uh,

2497
02:24:33,210 --> 02:24:37,920
Coyote Wolf Hybrids are prowling
Rock Creek Park and DC suburbs.

2498
02:24:38,190 --> 02:24:40,170
What the fuck, man?
Real. This is it. Yeah.

2499
02:24:40,171 --> 02:24:44,370
This is a coyote wolf hybrid
in the Washington DC suburbs

2500
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:48,550
and that nuts, Koi, Koi wolves.

2501
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:51,500
And they've, uh, they've recently, um,

2502
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:54,550
established that wolves
have returned to California,

2503
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,400
the first known wolf, uh, you know,

2504
02:24:57,401 --> 02:25:00,550
within x amount of coming
out of where fall. Find out

2505
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:06,060
is it like, uh, the red
wolves coming out of Arizona,

2506
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:06,903
New Mexico?

2507
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:09,240
I'll tell you right
now, because it's a, a,

2508
02:25:09,241 --> 02:25:13,700
a totally new thing that
they've proven it's from,

2509
02:25:14,540 --> 02:25:18,410
yeah. This, it's a, where
they've established it.

2510
02:25:19,850 --> 02:25:23,830
Um, the wolf's controversy,
we will return to California.

2511
02:25:23,831 --> 02:25:26,680
It's on Popular Science magazine.
Uh,

2512
02:25:26,710 --> 02:25:30,550
popular opinion is divided and how to
manage the gray wolf. So it's a gray wolf.

2513
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:32,561
2011,

2514
02:25:32,561 --> 02:25:36,500
a male gray wolf called oh are seven
left his pack and Oregon and traverse w

2515
02:25:36,550 --> 02:25:41,550
1200 miles to California with a sore
travel is an atypical for gray wolves.

2516
02:25:41,890 --> 02:25:44,650
That terrain or seven covered
set him apart from the pack.

2517
02:25:44,651 --> 02:25:49,480
He became the first confirmed wolf in
California in almost a century. Maybe kid.

2518
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:54,310
Yeah. And so had he been
collared and Oregon, he must've
been. It's good question.

2519
02:25:54,370 --> 02:25:57,340
It must've right if they've
figured out where he is.

2520
02:25:57,610 --> 02:26:00,430
You know, a guy in Missouri one time
killed one outside of his chicken coup,

2521
02:26:00,431 --> 02:26:04,090
we thought was a coyote. Nothing had come
from Michigan's upper peninsula. Well,

2522
02:26:04,091 --> 02:26:05,710
there was a guy who
crossed the Mississippi,

2523
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:10,810
they killed a mountain lion in Connecticut
that turned out to be from South

2524
02:26:10,810 --> 02:26:12,610
Dakota.
You're about that fucking thing.

2525
02:26:12,670 --> 02:26:13,740
I'm telling you.
I was like,

2526
02:26:14,140 --> 02:26:17,530
I don't mean to say like I was on
this story long ago, but you know,

2527
02:26:17,830 --> 02:26:19,210
my entire life,

2528
02:26:19,810 --> 02:26:23,380
this debate about where La Mountain lions,

2529
02:26:23,381 --> 02:26:27,970
it turned up in the east or werewolves
that turn up and we were places my entire

2530
02:26:27,971 --> 02:26:31,780
life has been this battle between people
who'd be like, oh, it's escape pets,

2531
02:26:31,900 --> 02:26:34,480
it's escape pets.
You know?

2532
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:40,530
And now it's becoming clear that in so
many of these cases it's not things just

2533
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:45,840
leave now and then and they have a very
clear sense of purpose and they travel

2534
02:26:47,921 --> 02:26:49,240
tremendous distances.

2535
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:52,980
Or seven, they actually got a trail
cam photo of this thing in California.

2536
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:56,710
Yeah. And it used to, every time someone
saw something like that, people be like,

2537
02:26:56,740 --> 02:27:01,120
oh, you didn't see it or you saw an
escape pet and you'd think that like every

2538
02:27:01,121 --> 02:27:05,240
household had a mountain lion pat to
account for all the lines of guys.

2539
02:27:05,241 --> 02:27:10,000
It'd be like, it was a damn lion. Like I
found where something had killed a deer.

2540
02:27:10,001 --> 02:27:12,890
I went back. The next thing,
there's a lion sitting there,
biggest and escape pet.

2541
02:27:13,930 --> 02:27:17,420
This is pretty proficient, you know, it's,

2542
02:27:17,650 --> 02:27:19,930
my whole life has been
going on and now finally,

2543
02:27:19,931 --> 02:27:21,310
I mean the guys that have
been pushing for this,

2544
02:27:21,311 --> 02:27:25,150
I've ever finally got to feel a lot
better when now that through tracking

2545
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:29,050
devices we're able to go like, yeah,
a wolf decided one day, you know,

2546
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:30,250
to leave there and go down.

2547
02:27:30,251 --> 02:27:33,220
There was a grizzly that one day decided
to Mosey out of the Rockies and made it

2548
02:27:33,340 --> 02:27:38,050
out into eastern Montana.
You know, there's an elk that
did, uh, many. Usually it's,

2549
02:27:38,051 --> 02:27:40,360
you know,
usually these wide range and predators.

2550
02:27:40,690 --> 02:27:43,480
They got wolverines that I was
just reading a thing about.

2551
02:27:44,110 --> 02:27:47,710
They had a wolverine a little, because
this winds up being an interesting,

2552
02:27:47,711 --> 02:27:51,050
they did a rate, they're doing a radio
collar studying Alaska about a road there.

2553
02:27:51,130 --> 02:27:55,030
They think about putting a road
in into the Juno area. Okay.

2554
02:27:55,480 --> 02:27:58,450
So they've been doing a study on
animal movements in that area to try to

2555
02:27:58,451 --> 02:28:03,130
anticipate how this road might impact
wildlife and and to just to see about

2556
02:28:03,131 --> 02:28:04,810
their migration patterns
and moving her parents.

2557
02:28:04,811 --> 02:28:06,280
They went in and collared
a bunch of stuff.

2558
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:11,640
They had a radio collared Moose fall
into a crevasse in a glacier and then a

2559
02:28:18,730 --> 02:28:23,730
radio collared bear tried to go in there
and get 'em out in Phelan and died.

2560
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:31,070
And I think that was then scavenged
by a radio collared Wolverine.

2561
02:28:33,740 --> 02:28:37,010
They also had a wolverine.
They had a wolverine collard there,

2562
02:28:37,070 --> 02:28:41,510
get caught by a trap or
250 miles away and BC. Wow.

2563
02:28:41,570 --> 02:28:46,130
250 miles it would walked.
Wolverines are really rare.

2564
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:48,510
Fine.
They're rare to find Tony.

2565
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:53,240
That is one of the last things of large,

2566
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:56,540
you know,
like North American fauna.

2567
02:28:57,320 --> 02:29:00,380
That's one of the last things I'm looking
for. You're looking for a wolverine.

2568
02:29:00,470 --> 02:29:03,440
I have not laid eyes on
one. My friends that, uh,

2569
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:06,770
beyond a saw one Caribou
hunting, uh, my brother Dan,

2570
02:29:06,771 --> 02:29:10,250
he was hunting spring bears one time
and saw wolverines digging through the

2571
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:14,210
debris field at the base of an avalanche
looking for critters that got swept up

2572
02:29:14,211 --> 02:29:15,044
in the avalanche.

2573
02:29:15,290 --> 02:29:17,540
Or I've got a handful of friends and
seen when I haven't seen one yet.

2574
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:22,760
Those just badgers and wolverines and
those types of animals are so bizarre.

2575
02:29:22,970 --> 02:29:25,790
Dude, I was driving, I was
driving down the hall road,

2576
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:30,700
the Trans Alaska pipeline road.
And you know,

2577
02:29:30,730 --> 02:29:33,650
you're up. Like if you go, if
you're on that road, like the pipe,

2578
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:36,410
the road that parallels the
Alaska pipeline, Dalton highway,

2579
02:29:37,010 --> 02:29:41,780
if you're on that road and you go west,
you're not going to,

2580
02:29:41,930 --> 02:29:44,060
you,
depending on your line of travel,

2581
02:29:44,061 --> 02:29:48,650
you won't hit another road til
year in Europe and in Russia.

2582
02:29:49,150 --> 02:29:51,110
And then you go the other direction.

2583
02:29:51,111 --> 02:29:52,910
You're going to get way into
Canada for you hit her though.

2584
02:29:52,911 --> 02:29:54,620
I mean you're in the middle of nowhere
and not in the middle of nowhere,

2585
02:29:54,621 --> 02:29:58,430
but it's very remote relative to
anything we can comprehend down here.

2586
02:29:59,060 --> 02:30:04,040
Driving on that road one
time. Um, all out steps,

2587
02:30:04,041 --> 02:30:05,940
the links.
Okay.

2588
02:30:06,670 --> 02:30:09,770
And it looks like it's like a
cat with a baby's face on it,

2589
02:30:09,771 --> 02:30:11,480
like a human babies face on it,
man.

2590
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:16,780
I'll steps the links and
like it's level to be,

2591
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:21,050
to have an animal look at you like
that and it just, with utter lack,

2592
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:25,520
lack of comprehension. Like,
I can't say this for sure,

2593
02:30:25,550 --> 02:30:29,240
but more than other animals. You feel
that he had never seen that before?

2594
02:30:29,810 --> 02:30:33,770
Never seen a person. It's just like
usually like you'll see an animal,

2595
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:37,460
he cuts out in the road, right. And he
sees a car and he gets that like, oh shit,

2596
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:39,710
no this ain't good.
You know,

2597
02:30:39,740 --> 02:30:44,540
based on whatever experiences he's had
or responses that he's witnessed from his

2598
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:49,570
mother. Okay. Or like some sort of
like they kind of get tense there.

2599
02:30:49,650 --> 02:30:53,580
They're gauging risk but just this thing
steps in the road and just looks kind

2600
02:30:53,581 --> 02:30:56,720
of like, Eh, like this look on his
face and I'm anthropomorphizing here,

2601
02:30:56,721 --> 02:30:57,920
but look on his face was like,
no,

2602
02:30:57,921 --> 02:31:02,921
what in the hell is that followed by
utter lack of interest and just left.

2603
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,370
He's like, he looked, I
don't know what that is.

2604
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:09,830
I can't see this bringing
anything good to me.

2605
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:12,530
And then wandered off and
it was one of the weird,

2606
02:31:12,531 --> 02:31:14,570
like that's the only one I've seen.
Look at that thing.

2607
02:31:14,750 --> 02:31:18,260
They don't even look real man. I'm
telling you what, they're freaky.

2608
02:31:18,290 --> 02:31:23,190
They are so tall.
Like how tall this thing is.

2609
02:31:23,191 --> 02:31:27,150
Like this high man, so like two feet
high just yet. Leggy though. Huge feat.

2610
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:30,180
Just a weird, you know, they're
like snowshoe hare specialist man.

2611
02:31:30,181 --> 02:31:33,830
They like to hunt snowshoe hares so it
has big feet so they can get through snow.

2612
02:31:34,300 --> 02:31:36,350
Quite a hunter gatherer.
Snowshoe Hare special.

2613
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:41,400
Well Cameron Hanes was telling me about
bears that come out of hibernation and

2614
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:46,090
as they come out of hibernation is the
same time where the Moose are stuck in

2615
02:31:46,091 --> 02:31:49,190
the snow and that it's
just start flying snow.

2616
02:31:49,210 --> 02:31:53,440
And so the Moose are like plotting and
these bears come out and they haven't

2617
02:31:53,441 --> 02:31:56,500
eaten anything in months because
they'd just been hibernating.

2618
02:31:56,560 --> 02:31:59,170
But they see these moves and
they can't help but kill them.

2619
02:31:59,440 --> 02:32:03,850
So they just go on these rampages killing
every moose they find and just leaving

2620
02:32:03,851 --> 02:32:06,490
their carcasses because they
can't really handle meat yet.

2621
02:32:06,750 --> 02:32:09,360
Yeah, no, I got it. They, but they,
they like to have the opportunity,

2622
02:32:09,370 --> 02:32:13,810
had their instincts. He's just cause one
day come when they do come out, you know,

2623
02:32:13,830 --> 02:32:16,530
they'll come out and eat grass
for a while, he vegetation,

2624
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:19,920
but they do spend a lot of
time, um, following that,

2625
02:32:19,950 --> 02:32:23,820
they spent a lot of time looking for,
you know, what we call winter kill, um,

2626
02:32:24,030 --> 02:32:29,030
just scavenging carcasses they can
find and then they hammer hammer fawns.

2627
02:32:30,601 --> 02:32:35,601
And that's something people use in that
realize about black bears is the high

2628
02:32:36,061 --> 02:32:40,530
rates of like fawn mortality get
from black bears on elk, moose,

2629
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:42,630
deer, you know, they don't like,

2630
02:32:42,631 --> 02:32:46,130
it doesn't seem like they really go after
the adults like healthy adults under

2631
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:47,280
normal circumstances,

2632
02:32:47,281 --> 02:32:51,600
but they really find out that blackberry
just turn up and hit calves and Fonz

2633
02:32:51,601 --> 02:32:54,180
and the way that no one ever thought
before they smelled that placenta.

2634
02:32:54,181 --> 02:32:57,780
It's like to have this idea of them
as being kind of like the kinder,

2635
02:32:57,781 --> 02:33:01,500
gentler bear, you know. But
there they'd know these spots,

2636
02:33:01,501 --> 02:33:06,501
they turn up in these spots before
things turn up there to drop Fonz,

2637
02:33:06,990 --> 02:33:07,770
you know,

2638
02:33:07,770 --> 02:33:11,580
the second mountain lion or third mountain
line I ever saw a saw cut and through

2639
02:33:11,940 --> 02:33:14,010
a bunch of elk calves and a calving area.

2640
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:17,700
And you can just imagine how much the
thing like that can clean house. Yeah.

2641
02:33:17,970 --> 02:33:21,900
God Damn. When we were a bear hunting,
I got to watch Barrett's fight.

2642
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:23,251
We watched a,

2643
02:33:23,251 --> 02:33:27,540
a fucking no holds barred brawl between
this female bear with her two cubs.

2644
02:33:27,560 --> 02:33:32,130
Oh really? Hale who had come into the
bait. They, she fucking went to war, man.

2645
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:36,880
The bears, the babies climbed
up the trees. They were
way the fuck up the trees.

2646
02:33:36,900 --> 02:33:40,050
Like to the point where we were worried,
one of them got real squirrely.

2647
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:43,140
He was like Kinda like
upside down on the tree.

2648
02:33:43,290 --> 02:33:45,930
Like he was way up there and
they're really young and uh,

2649
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,540
the adults can't climb
because they get too heavy.

2650
02:33:48,870 --> 02:33:52,410
And this big male had come
in and it was a big female.

2651
02:33:52,411 --> 02:33:56,160
And first the baby's ran up the
tree and the female took off.

2652
02:33:56,190 --> 02:33:59,760
She left and then she was, she just
thought about it. She so you know what?

2653
02:33:59,761 --> 02:34:02,520
Fuck that.
And she turned around and attacked him,

2654
02:34:03,030 --> 02:34:06,090
turned around and challenged him and
they both went up on their back legs and

2655
02:34:06,091 --> 02:34:07,230
they were just going at it just

2656
02:34:08,330 --> 02:34:09,163
wow.

2657
02:34:09,510 --> 02:34:12,540
And we were sitting there on the
ground because Cameron is fucking nuts.

2658
02:34:12,541 --> 02:34:15,990
He likes to hunt on the ground. He
looks at Boalt Hall, no Tree Stan.

2659
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:21,140
So we're just as like tree that's fallen
and we're set up behind this tree and

2660
02:34:21,251 --> 02:34:23,590
we're watching these
fucking, you know, six,

2661
02:34:23,591 --> 02:34:26,770
seven foot brown bears going
to war right in front of us.

2662
02:34:27,010 --> 02:34:29,200
I mean no more than 30 40 yards away.

2663
02:34:29,440 --> 02:34:31,900
Duke. Yeah. You gotta be wondering
like in the middle of this fight,

2664
02:34:31,901 --> 02:34:34,150
all sudden he comes rolling over
and here's your ass sitting there.

2665
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:38,620
I was knocked up, man. I had
an arrow knocked and you know,

2666
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:42,910
but like such a little kid, one of my
earliest memory is earliest memories,

2667
02:34:42,911 --> 02:34:45,490
but are being a little kid.
And my dad got a phone call one night,

2668
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:49,870
one of his hunting buddies had, was
sitting on a bear bait, what is bow?

2669
02:34:50,650 --> 02:34:55,650
And a sal came in with cubs and smelled
them and shooed her cubs up a tree.

2670
02:34:56,891 --> 02:35:01,891
But they went up past him in the tree
and then they started squealing and

2671
02:35:02,051 --> 02:35:05,410
balling up there and she came up
mauled his legs that he loved. Yeah,

2672
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:07,660
he went up in a hospital.
Fuck.

2673
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:12,220
So she was a small enough that she could
make it up the tray. She got, well,

2674
02:35:12,221 --> 02:35:15,720
she's opened up to get at his
boots. But I mean, hey, you know,

2675
02:35:15,790 --> 02:35:17,740
I mean most of though, I don't know. I,

2676
02:35:18,820 --> 02:35:22,780
I've heard that that some blackbirds
get too big to climb. I don't know.

2677
02:35:22,781 --> 02:35:26,290
I mean they can climb pretty good. I
mean, and I don't know to what extent,

2678
02:35:26,291 --> 02:35:28,270
but I mean your typical barriers,

2679
02:35:28,390 --> 02:35:31,750
you typical blackberry can get
itself up a tree. She went up a tree,

2680
02:35:31,751 --> 02:35:34,030
the one that we saw,
she went up a tree a little bit,

2681
02:35:34,031 --> 02:35:38,840
but only like maybe five or six feet were
her kids went like they were 50 feet.

2682
02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:41,290
I'm sure it depends a lot on this,
your conference with the tree and whatnot,

2683
02:35:41,291 --> 02:35:44,800
but for sure we have a grizzlies don't,
I mean they when you're young,

2684
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:46,750
but when they get older
they can't cut that tree.

2685
02:35:46,940 --> 02:35:49,790
Yeah, that's what they were saying they
were because they had tree stands there,

2686
02:35:49,820 --> 02:35:52,550
but he likes the Honda ground.
But he said, if you see a Grizzly,

2687
02:35:52,580 --> 02:35:57,140
then we go up the tree stand for sure.
Yeah, there's a bunch right there.

2688
02:35:57,170 --> 02:35:58,600
It was kind of like,
that looks cute,

2689
02:35:58,700 --> 02:36:02,510
but it was crazy to watch them Duke it
out like right there in front of us.

2690
02:36:02,540 --> 02:36:06,080
I mean it was white and went on for a
while and then he would come back and she

2691
02:36:06,081 --> 02:36:10,850
would chase him off again.
And then finally he gave up.
But then as it got darker,

2692
02:36:10,851 --> 02:36:14,510
she took off and then a bunch of
bears came in. When it's dark,

2693
02:36:14,570 --> 02:36:18,620
that's when it's really crazy.
Start calling. Alberta's
flooded with bears, man.

2694
02:36:18,950 --> 02:36:22,190
They said that there's between,
depending on who you ask,

2695
02:36:22,191 --> 02:36:24,320
between three and eight per acre,

2696
02:36:24,770 --> 02:36:29,770
and they're dealing with 8,000 acre
per square mile per square mile.

2697
02:36:30,170 --> 02:36:32,660
That's what I meant. And they're
dealing with 8,000 square miles.

2698
02:36:32,690 --> 02:36:37,280
So he said there's this bears everywhere.
And so the first time I got there,

2699
02:36:37,370 --> 02:36:40,580
you know, we, we sat down, we weighed him
like, where are all these fucking bears?

2700
02:36:40,610 --> 02:36:41,900
You know,
if there's so many bears,

2701
02:36:42,140 --> 02:36:45,830
like you think you would see one and
then when you see one and then you see

2702
02:36:45,831 --> 02:36:47,210
another and you don't hear him,

2703
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:51,020
that's what's crazy because the ground
is thick with leaves and pine needles and

2704
02:36:51,021 --> 02:36:53,950
stuff. So literally all sudden
his parents are very, like,

2705
02:36:53,970 --> 02:36:57,920
he's there looking at
you, you know, from 70,

2706
02:36:57,950 --> 02:37:00,800
80 feet away, you know, just,
you didn't even see him coming.

2707
02:37:01,210 --> 02:37:04,550
Suddenly appears because it's so dense.
So many trees up there.

2708
02:37:04,730 --> 02:37:09,410
I was calling turkeys one time
and had a bear come behind me.

2709
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:12,380
Um, you know like predators
when you're making,

2710
02:37:12,381 --> 02:37:15,950
when you're calling turkeys in the spring,
you're making head noises, track males,

2711
02:37:16,360 --> 02:37:19,880
um, check with toms, but
predators will come to that noise.

2712
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:23,300
And uh,

2713
02:37:23,870 --> 02:37:27,830
I had a bear come in behind me that I
never heard until I heard it breathe.

2714
02:37:30,890 --> 02:37:34,880
It sounded like a dude and you're on the
ground sitting right in underground and

2715
02:37:34,881 --> 02:37:37,760
I here,
I mean this thing was right.

2716
02:37:37,761 --> 02:37:41,810
I mean right there like breathe
or my shoulder. How many feet

2717
02:37:43,350 --> 02:37:45,880
from oh five, six feet. I'm just there.

2718
02:37:46,970 --> 02:37:50,780
When I turned I was scared but that
thing was more scared when I turn,

2719
02:37:50,930 --> 02:37:55,850
he like turned himself inside
out. Man Just took off. It
was amazing. It was funny.

2720
02:37:55,851 --> 02:37:58,430
We were talking about like bears climbing
trees, black bears and grizzly bears.

2721
02:37:58,990 --> 02:38:02,770
Um, I wrote about this at
some point, but we are,

2722
02:38:02,780 --> 02:38:05,600
my brother and I were laying on this
ridge one time hunting elk and like during

2723
02:38:05,601 --> 02:38:08,060
the mid day when it's warm,
like nothing happens, you know,

2724
02:38:08,061 --> 02:38:11,210
we'll just go sleep somewhere and wait
for the elk come back out cause they go

2725
02:38:11,211 --> 02:38:13,580
into black timber just to feed bed down.

2726
02:38:14,150 --> 02:38:16,760
So there's really no sense and there's
nothing you can do. You just sleep.

2727
02:38:17,550 --> 02:38:21,710
And at one point I wake up cause I hear
a noise and I wake up and was a black

2728
02:38:21,711 --> 02:38:26,150
bear standing there and he goes off down
this ridge line and I'm sorry it just

2729
02:38:26,151 --> 02:38:28,730
goes down off the ridge down
toward the valley floor.

2730
02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:32,390
That night we headed out to go hunt.
Uh,

2731
02:38:33,170 --> 02:38:36,020
we headed out to go hunt elk and we
happened to go in the direction that the

2732
02:38:36,021 --> 02:38:39,410
bird went and my brother's
still had a bear tag.

2733
02:38:39,420 --> 02:38:42,980
I had filled my bear but he still
had a bear tag. And as we're walking,

2734
02:38:43,850 --> 02:38:48,850
I hear the noise of its claws
on the bark like real loud,

2735
02:38:49,011 --> 02:38:50,560
you know like barks,
phone and scratch,

2736
02:38:50,561 --> 02:38:52,880
you know you manage like what a
cat would sound like or something.

2737
02:38:53,210 --> 02:38:56,690
Scratching up something.
I'm like that must be that black bear.

2738
02:38:57,710 --> 02:39:02,710
So we go hauling ass up to tree thinking
that will maybe get the bear up the

2739
02:39:03,321 --> 02:39:07,250
tree and bill check it out but run it.
There is not a black bear.

2740
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:12,410
It's a sow grizzly standing there and
she's got two cubs that are about four or

2741
02:39:12,411 --> 02:39:15,470
five feet up this tree and she's standing
there at the base of the tree and she

2742
02:39:15,471 --> 02:39:19,430
woofs that.
It was like a dog like oof barking,

2743
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:24,290
you know and those cubs come down the
tree and we're just standing right there

2744
02:39:24,291 --> 02:39:25,520
man.
It was like you can't,

2745
02:39:25,521 --> 02:39:29,090
you can never say it was close to getting
scratched unless you got scratched

2746
02:39:29,091 --> 02:39:30,620
cause you don't know what's
in the animal's head.

2747
02:39:30,830 --> 02:39:32,300
But like reviewing it in my head,

2748
02:39:32,301 --> 02:39:34,460
that was one that was like
a very sketchy moment,

2749
02:39:35,110 --> 02:39:36,800
you know as that bear kind of like,

2750
02:39:36,801 --> 02:39:38,150
cause it's like the last thing
you're supposed to do. Right.

2751
02:39:38,151 --> 02:39:42,320
It's like mess with their cubs and here
we are just running up on there and when

2752
02:39:42,321 --> 02:39:45,140
she got those cubs down the tree and they
started going up the hill away from us,

2753
02:39:45,590 --> 02:39:50,360
she was taking her paw and
moving the cubs with her.

2754
02:39:50,361 --> 02:39:54,980
Paul. Wow. Pushing them ahead of her. Wow.

2755
02:39:55,030 --> 02:39:57,200
It's the same way like you know when
you'd like trying to get your kids to go,

2756
02:39:57,201 --> 02:40:00,590
we want you, I saw your hand up guys.
I got your hand on their head or yeah.

2757
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:04,340
It's about trying to guide him. You know
why she's like giggling and giggling.

2758
02:40:04,520 --> 02:40:08,410
Wow. That was wild man. But she could
have spun around to scratch those things.

2759
02:40:08,580 --> 02:40:12,560
That's the big reason why a lot of
people are hikers get attacked. Right?

2760
02:40:12,561 --> 02:40:14,130
It's a female with their costs coming

2761
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:17,970
across something. Yeah.
Like this blew my mind.

2762
02:40:18,030 --> 02:40:22,260
I just read that not a single bow hunter
has been killed by a grizzly bear.

2763
02:40:23,060 --> 02:40:26,250
You know, while bow hunting, even though
boners get scratched up all the time,

2764
02:40:26,251 --> 02:40:28,360
like every year there's some
guy getting scratched up now,

2765
02:40:28,361 --> 02:40:32,250
the single bow hunters, men killed by a
grizzly bear and at least 20 years. Wow.

2766
02:40:32,510 --> 02:40:35,990
You know, last year there was like three
grizzly bear fatalities in Montana,

2767
02:40:36,010 --> 02:40:36,600
Wyoming.
Well,

2768
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:40,200
that was one of the things you saw on
that hunt show was how difficult it is to

2769
02:40:40,201 --> 02:40:43,380
bow hunt for grizzlies because they,
first of all,

2770
02:40:43,381 --> 02:40:47,220
the Kodiak island was very windy.
Like these guys were like,

2771
02:40:47,221 --> 02:40:52,100
they were taking shots in the air would
just take off and missed the [inaudible].

2772
02:40:52,340 --> 02:40:55,560
This is miserable and wet. You
got to get so close with, oh man.

2773
02:40:56,350 --> 02:41:00,210
It's one thing like being a stand
and waiting for a white tail to walk

2774
02:41:00,211 --> 02:41:00,721
underneath you,

2775
02:41:00,721 --> 02:41:05,721
but to creep up on a fucking giant
nine foot bear that's outside.

2776
02:41:06,550 --> 02:41:08,720
You got to get within 30
40 yards of this thing.

2777
02:41:08,750 --> 02:41:11,670
Don't get an accurate shot on it
and it's windy and everything there.

2778
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:13,230
But now in that show,

2779
02:41:13,380 --> 02:41:16,710
they're doing that. This happens
a lot, but I know that like

2780
02:41:17,160 --> 02:41:20,730
shows don't show it.

2781
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:26,330
And outdoor writers don't write
about it, but oftentimes, very often,

2782
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:28,600
I can't say it's the majority of time.

2783
02:41:28,601 --> 02:41:33,601
I was like a very common practice when
a guy's bow hunting brown bears is the

2784
02:41:34,100 --> 02:41:34,470
minute

2785
02:41:34,470 --> 02:41:37,770
that Arrow makes contact with that bear.

2786
02:41:38,520 --> 02:41:41,220
The guides lightened it up
with like a three 75 h and h.

2787
02:41:42,480 --> 02:41:45,600
So there's shooting with a gun right
after the minute that arrowhead. Yeah,

2788
02:41:45,630 --> 02:41:49,750
that's probably smart. I mean,
I saw that on a show. It was a,

2789
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:54,830
a bow hunting show with this guy shot
a fucking elephant with a bow and the

2790
02:41:54,841 --> 02:41:59,070
elephant turn and you're like, fuck you.
And elephants starts running it and boom,

2791
02:41:59,071 --> 02:42:03,210
they shot him in the head with a rifle
and like he's going to call that I hunted

2792
02:42:03,211 --> 02:42:05,280
an elephant with a bow.
Like the fuck you did.

2793
02:42:05,460 --> 02:42:10,460
All you did was pissing elephant off
and it charged you and these guides shot

2794
02:42:10,711 --> 02:42:12,750
the elephant in the head.
They killed the elephant.

2795
02:42:12,850 --> 02:42:16,060
Yeah, I'm not, I'm not diminishing
the balls it takes to get in there.

2796
02:42:16,210 --> 02:42:20,110
Like I watch the thing like, you know,
I watched thing where uh, Tom Miranda,

2797
02:42:20,111 --> 02:42:24,070
you know, kills like a big grizzly was Bo
and by no, I mean by any means. Like he,

2798
02:42:24,760 --> 02:42:28,900
it was like he got a great hit on
that bear that bear ran and fell over.

2799
02:42:28,901 --> 02:42:32,090
I'm not saying that's what I was saying.
You hear about it so off,

2800
02:42:32,091 --> 02:42:35,200
when you talk to guide so
often and even do with rifles,

2801
02:42:35,980 --> 02:42:39,250
even we've got hits it with a rifle.
He's going to start pumping. Led. Yeah.

2802
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:41,950
It's just so hard to anchor them in and
then they go on those orders and you

2803
02:42:41,951 --> 02:42:44,770
don't want to lose them.
So don't want to go in there after him.

2804
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:46,060
Take the initial shot,

2805
02:42:46,090 --> 02:42:49,670
they consider you shot that bear and
then everybody else in the guy, you know,

2806
02:42:49,671 --> 02:42:53,380
or whoever can can do a follower really
didn't like watching them shoot the

2807
02:42:53,381 --> 02:42:57,370
elephant. There's something to me about
shooting some animals where it's like,

2808
02:42:57,400 --> 02:42:59,440
I don't get it.
Like why would,

2809
02:42:59,441 --> 02:43:02,890
I don't know why you would travel all
the way to Africa to shoot an elephant

2810
02:43:02,891 --> 02:43:05,170
with a bow while these people behind you.

2811
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:09,170
Rifle it and you're calling that bow
hunting. I wouldn't shoot it. I don't,

2812
02:43:09,230 --> 02:43:12,160
I couldn't shoot an elephant
just because I like, I don't

2813
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:16,840
have, I didn't, I don't have
like a, a context with the
animal, a cultural context,

2814
02:43:16,841 --> 02:43:19,360
you know what I'm saying?
Like with North American animals,

2815
02:43:20,290 --> 02:43:23,410
I find that generally when I go hunting
and I'd like to have had an experience

2816
02:43:23,411 --> 02:43:26,680
with it and understand sort
of you don't understand it.

2817
02:43:27,130 --> 02:43:31,270
And it would be for African hunting
for me to like enjoy it on Africa.

2818
02:43:31,750 --> 02:43:36,750
I would probably want to go there just
to have a look around and be there and

2819
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:41,920
then maybe go again just for
me personally, then go again.

2820
02:43:41,921 --> 02:43:43,480
And I might enjoy hunting more.

2821
02:43:43,630 --> 02:43:47,670
Once I sort of felt like I
understood the animals, you know,

2822
02:43:47,700 --> 02:43:50,680
or I understood more about the
biology and the sort of like,

2823
02:43:50,681 --> 02:43:53,550
I just understood the area
better. It would make me feel
more like, like, uh, like,

2824
02:43:53,551 --> 02:43:56,320
uh,
like to what I want to have in a,

2825
02:43:56,410 --> 02:43:58,630
in a Predator prey relationship.

2826
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:02,120
We're going down to film this year.
Uh,

2827
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:06,820
we're going down to Bolivia and we'll
go out hunting with Amerindians or go

2828
02:44:06,821 --> 02:44:10,780
along on a hunt with Amerindians
and, um, you know, they,

2829
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:12,670
they go out and do meet hunts for Cathy.

2830
02:44:12,671 --> 02:44:15,550
Borrow Pako they both fish for fish a lot.

2831
02:44:15,850 --> 02:44:19,560
One of the things they like to hunt is he
liked to hunt spider monkeys, you know,

2832
02:44:19,930 --> 02:44:22,900
and I've always valid, I'll
never eat a monkey. You know, I,

2833
02:44:22,901 --> 02:44:24,730
I always say that I'll never read monkey,

2834
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:27,040
but now I'm going to be down
there and he's guys, you know,

2835
02:44:27,100 --> 02:44:30,460
presumably they're going to get a monkey
and they're going to cook it and you

2836
02:44:30,461 --> 02:44:34,420
gotta try it. I can't decide, man.
Yeah, I'm not in the eating primates.

2837
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:37,840
I just feel like,
you know,

2838
02:44:37,870 --> 02:44:39,850
I can't decide what I'll
do when I'm sitting there

2839
02:44:41,410 --> 02:44:45,120
dogs and didn't like it at all. Well,
you ate a coyote, which is crazy.

2840
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:48,430
Then they'd be like, that didn't
bother me. And like an emotional way.

2841
02:44:48,550 --> 02:44:50,950
But I'm saying I tripped out
emotionally about eating a dog,

2842
02:44:51,370 --> 02:44:56,370
so I can't imagine what I might suffer
to be chewing up a prime primate.

2843
02:44:59,900 --> 02:45:03,470
It's just like, I remember reading
one time and this kind of, I was this,

2844
02:45:03,471 --> 02:45:06,070
explain this to my brother the other day
when I was talking about this conundrum

2845
02:45:06,071 --> 02:45:06,904
I'm in,

2846
02:45:06,970 --> 02:45:10,750
where I was reading about a guy who was
the screen he was describing the hunt

2847
02:45:10,751 --> 02:45:14,950
from monkeys and a dude hit a,
and he was observing,

2848
02:45:14,951 --> 02:45:17,410
he was observing south,
you know,

2849
02:45:17,710 --> 02:45:20,200
South American tribal
hunters or Amerindians.

2850
02:45:20,210 --> 02:45:21,880
He's observing them hunting monkeys.

2851
02:45:22,180 --> 02:45:27,180
And the monkey got shot in the back
and a monkey with a dart and the monkey

2852
02:45:27,220 --> 02:45:31,360
reached around and
grabbed the dark. Whoa. So

2853
02:45:32,890 --> 02:45:36,760
they image it was just so burned my head.

2854
02:45:37,270 --> 02:45:39,610
But I think like, I don't know
what I'll do, man. I'll be curious.

2855
02:45:39,670 --> 02:45:42,640
I'd be curious if the guys I work with,
if they want to eat the monkey or not.

2856
02:45:43,030 --> 02:45:45,140
Yeah. But there's so many weird
things. He'd go like this.

2857
02:45:45,141 --> 02:45:49,540
So these guys are indigenous hunters.
They hunt, they make their own bowls,

2858
02:45:49,541 --> 02:45:50,860
they live in the jungle.
Like any kind of thing,

2859
02:45:51,160 --> 02:45:55,990
like if you went out and
surveyed a hundred Americans,
a hundred would say like,

2860
02:45:55,991 --> 02:46:00,370
by all means, if anyone can justify
hunting to be these boys, all right.

2861
02:46:01,170 --> 02:46:05,680
Um, they're going to be their hunting,
whether you're with them or not.

2862
02:46:06,040 --> 02:46:10,070
So it was kind of like, you look at,
well, monkeys dead now. Yeah. I guess

2863
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:10,903
I could see that.

2864
02:46:10,940 --> 02:46:14,180
What I couldn't see as going there
with a purpose to go shoot a monkey,

2865
02:46:14,480 --> 02:46:17,570
I guess if I was there experiencing
what it is like for them.

2866
02:46:17,930 --> 02:46:22,090
And also if they offered me a mom,
like it was part of like you're,

2867
02:46:22,150 --> 02:46:26,590
you're taking into their home and they're
cooking you a meal and they ask you,

2868
02:46:26,620 --> 02:46:29,710
you know, they serve you what
they eat, maybe then I would,

2869
02:46:30,250 --> 02:46:34,160
no, there's no way I shoot. There's no way
I'd shoot a monkey. Yeah. By saying that,

2870
02:46:34,220 --> 02:46:36,650
I don't think that one shouldn't
be allowed and whatever, you know,

2871
02:46:36,651 --> 02:46:40,960
it just depends on the, the consensus
of biologists and whatever area,

2872
02:46:40,970 --> 02:46:45,680
whether it can warn and or not. But no, I
wouldn't, it just like I couldn't, yeah,

2873
02:46:45,681 --> 02:46:50,300
I couldn't either. But I know that they
have issues with baboons and people.

2874
02:46:50,490 --> 02:46:53,480
Dude in Africa, I, it's just
like, I guess I can't get it.

2875
02:46:53,481 --> 02:46:56,930
But in Africa you get the
sense that people view

2876
02:46:58,560 --> 02:47:03,380
like baboons, almost like how you
might like a, I hate to say it,

2877
02:47:03,381 --> 02:47:06,200
almost like you'd might
look at like raccoons and
opossums that are getting into

2878
02:47:06,201 --> 02:47:07,700
your dumpster. Yes. But

2879
02:47:08,100 --> 02:47:12,060
they, they'll kill a baby. Oh,
kill a human that are stolen human.

2880
02:47:12,210 --> 02:47:15,720
The first thing about Cameron Hanes,
who just got back from Africa,

2881
02:47:15,721 --> 02:47:18,930
he shot a fucking baboo, went over there,
shut up abdomen with a bow and arrow.

2882
02:47:18,931 --> 02:47:21,540
And I'm like, why don't you shoot a
baboons? And he's like, they actually

2883
02:47:21,660 --> 02:47:23,700
courage you to shoot them
the baboons as possible.

2884
02:47:23,701 --> 02:47:25,830
Cause they're overpopulated
and they're really dangerous.

2885
02:47:25,831 --> 02:47:28,350
That's a friends of mine
told me, man, do, uh,

2886
02:47:28,380 --> 02:47:31,650
do the guys in Africa eat the baboons?
No, they don't need it. Baboons.

2887
02:47:31,651 --> 02:47:33,820
And they don't need to hygienists
and they don't like the high end.

2888
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:35,120
No,
they killed him.

2889
02:47:35,121 --> 02:47:37,310
They killed him whenever they can
because they're so overpopulated,

2890
02:47:37,311 --> 02:47:39,170
but they don't eat them.
But he ate a kudu.

2891
02:47:39,171 --> 02:47:41,960
He shot a kudu over there and eat
that and he said it was amazing.

2892
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:45,990
Yeah, said Kudu. Kudos. Like similar
I guess in a lot of ways to deer,

2893
02:47:45,991 --> 02:47:50,970
elk and a, the way it tastes. The word
overpopulated, just such a weird word.

2894
02:47:51,020 --> 02:47:52,090
It's such an abused works.

2895
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:55,800
Whenever I hear that always get be like
according to whose perspective because

2896
02:47:55,801 --> 02:47:58,680
again and again and we're telling
like deer overpopulated like, yeah,

2897
02:47:58,740 --> 02:48:03,150
I mean from the perspective of
some agricultural interests,

2898
02:48:03,360 --> 02:48:07,290
dear overpopulated from the
perspective of auto insurers, you know,

2899
02:48:07,291 --> 02:48:11,820
deer over populated from the perspective
of Lyme disease activists, you know,

2900
02:48:11,910 --> 02:48:15,330
deer over pilot, but from a perspective
of dude who likes to eat a lot of deer,

2901
02:48:15,690 --> 02:48:20,010
you might be like, now's the good old
days, man. It's like this is perfect.

2902
02:48:20,340 --> 02:48:21,990
If I lived in some areas,

2903
02:48:22,610 --> 02:48:25,670
Mary's a western Massachusetts
that are so flooded with Deere,

2904
02:48:25,850 --> 02:48:29,450
I would definitely have one of those
crazy bumpers on my truck. You know,

2905
02:48:29,451 --> 02:48:31,140
they have those crazy big steel.

2906
02:48:32,050 --> 02:48:35,990
Well they make them specifically for
deer to withstand a deer hit. Yeah.

2907
02:48:35,991 --> 02:48:39,710
There was one of them that they were
pulling up photos over the other day of 18

2908
02:48:39,711 --> 02:48:42,740
wheelers that they have these giant ones
they put over the front of their trucks

2909
02:48:42,741 --> 02:48:44,540
because deer,
you know,

2910
02:48:44,541 --> 02:48:47,690
are so common and in a lot of these areas
where they're transporting stuff and

2911
02:48:47,691 --> 02:48:51,200
they had one where this deer,
it just, it had hit it and the,

2912
02:48:51,201 --> 02:48:56,090
the guard did its job but the fucking
entire truck was just painted with blood,

2913
02:48:56,150 --> 02:48:59,090
you know, cause it was all 65 miles
an hour and you hit an animal.

2914
02:48:59,240 --> 02:49:00,230
It's basically a bag of them.

2915
02:49:00,490 --> 02:49:03,460
It vaporize,
vaporize them such a disturbing way.

2916
02:49:03,490 --> 02:49:05,710
I recently wrote a
thing about this on the,

2917
02:49:05,860 --> 02:49:10,860
on the mediator show website where I was
about these recent controversies where

2918
02:49:11,731 --> 02:49:14,260
someone will go and kill a African animal.
You know,

2919
02:49:14,310 --> 02:49:17,010
I can like a lot of those
pictures by the way,

2920
02:49:17,011 --> 02:49:20,610
tell people where they can
get that because I loved
your perspective on it and I

2921
02:49:20,611 --> 02:49:23,250
loved one of the things
you pointed out about,

2922
02:49:23,550 --> 02:49:25,650
you've seen all these things where
people are getting pissed off.

2923
02:49:25,651 --> 02:49:28,650
These pretty girls that are going over
there and shooting these animals and a

2924
02:49:28,651 --> 02:49:33,030
lot of it is sexism. Oh yeah man. It
pit for a girl to go to African hunt,

2925
02:49:33,031 --> 02:49:37,620
pisses off people way more than for a
dude to and also for a wealthy person hunt

2926
02:49:37,621 --> 02:49:40,830
in Africa pisses off way more people
than the middle class person hunting in

2927
02:49:40,831 --> 02:49:43,420
Africa, which is just
weird. Like you know it,

2928
02:49:43,421 --> 02:49:46,020
it's so beyond the
biology is just like weird

2929
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:52,620
sexual stuff. It's weird. Nv class envy,

2930
02:49:53,190 --> 02:49:56,640
however you want to think of like
whatever you want to determine about the

2931
02:49:56,641 --> 02:49:57,660
legitimacy of hunting.

2932
02:49:57,661 --> 02:50:02,070
And Africa's really have nothing to do
with the gender of the hunter. Yeah.

2933
02:50:02,430 --> 02:50:06,020
But this, this one point I tried to make
an it thing that I wrote. You could,

2934
02:50:06,021 --> 02:50:09,750
you could find if you just go on, you
could probably even type in like, uh,

2935
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:13,890
Steven Rinella African hunting
controversy or go to the,

2936
02:50:13,891 --> 02:50:16,570
to the meat eater.com you'll
find the article. But,

2937
02:50:16,640 --> 02:50:21,640
but a point I make is when people look
at someone posing with an African animal,

2938
02:50:22,800 --> 02:50:24,570
like a lion, they, they,

2939
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:27,870
I think people look at and they
feel like they see a dead movie star

2940
02:50:29,730 --> 02:50:34,730
because they don't know like all you
know of that animal is sort of wildlife

2941
02:50:35,611 --> 02:50:40,410
documentaries and then cartoon
versions and the Lion King. It's like,

2942
02:50:40,590 --> 02:50:42,060
you feel like you're looking at that.

2943
02:50:42,090 --> 02:50:47,090
But in America we drive down the road
and we see just like contorted pulverized

2944
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:54,150
deer carcasses. Yeah. You
can't escape it. Yes. Yeah.

2945
02:50:54,390 --> 02:50:57,530
And so I feel like it's never
going to be as offensive. You know,

2946
02:50:57,550 --> 02:51:01,230
w when someone sees a dead deer,
it's not as shocking to them is be like,

2947
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:05,020
it's the animal from the movies
and then killed it. You know,

2948
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:06,570
anthropomorphizing of an animal.

2949
02:51:06,571 --> 02:51:09,480
It's a real issue when it comes
really feels the people more like,

2950
02:51:09,510 --> 02:51:12,750
I remember a friend of mine who
worked in the environmental movement,

2951
02:51:12,751 --> 02:51:16,050
or I shouldn't say that, cause I,
she was a conservationist. Okay.

2952
02:51:16,060 --> 02:51:19,810
As you were in the conservation
movement and she complained about, um,

2953
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:26,590
half jokingly about charismatic megafauna
so that so much mental energy of

2954
02:51:28,071 --> 02:51:33,071
Americans gets tied up in the preservation
of charismatic megafauna and those

2955
02:51:34,761 --> 02:51:39,761
things become such
money sinks that we miss

2956
02:51:41,410 --> 02:51:45,880
opportunities to understand like this
vast suite of other creatures out there

2957
02:51:45,881 --> 02:51:49,330
that doesn't make it onto calendars.
And she was, if I remember,

2958
02:51:49,331 --> 02:51:53,200
I think she was speaking
of the amount of research,

2959
02:51:53,210 --> 02:51:57,610
dollar dollars and public interests
and things that go into wolves like

2960
02:51:57,611 --> 02:51:59,140
understanding wolves,
you know,

2961
02:51:59,470 --> 02:52:03,220
and there's all the other animals that
she calls like non charismatic megaphone,

2962
02:52:03,280 --> 02:52:07,390
you just can't get someone
to like care about them,

2963
02:52:07,930 --> 02:52:11,320
you know? And I think that's, that's
one as far as conservation goes,

2964
02:52:11,321 --> 02:52:15,430
I think that's one thing
that that conservation
organizations that are based off

2965
02:52:15,431 --> 02:52:20,230
of specific animals wise tie is that
they're looking at like apex or keystone

2966
02:52:21,130 --> 02:52:22,750
cornerstone species.

2967
02:52:22,751 --> 02:52:26,980
So like a group like the National Wild
Turkey Federation and the Rocky Mountain

2968
02:52:26,980 --> 02:52:29,860
Elk Foundation, they will point out,
they'll be like, yeah, this is about elk.

2969
02:52:29,920 --> 02:52:31,270
We have elk on our symbol.

2970
02:52:31,360 --> 02:52:33,910
You might think that we fetishize
l but I can tell you this,

2971
02:52:33,970 --> 02:52:37,000
what's good for elk is good
for everybody. Yeah. You know,

2972
02:52:37,300 --> 02:52:39,910
it's one of the most demanding,
like least tolerant things.

2973
02:52:39,911 --> 02:52:43,240
And so if you preserve
elk wintering habitat,

2974
02:52:43,690 --> 02:52:48,460
you're also at the same time preserving
the habitats and so many other species.

2975
02:52:48,640 --> 02:52:52,090
And you might not say the same thing
about if you went and preserve the habitat

2976
02:52:52,360 --> 02:52:56,210
of, you know, some animal,

2977
02:52:56,211 --> 02:52:58,000
the more restricted
home range or something,

2978
02:52:58,001 --> 02:53:02,260
it might not blossom outward to offer
protection for all these other things.

2979
02:53:02,830 --> 02:53:07,360
So that's one way in which
like the charismatic megafauna
thing winds up playing

2980
02:53:07,361 --> 02:53:10,450
out is people go like, yeah, but by
helping him, I'm helping everybody.

2981
02:53:10,660 --> 02:53:12,760
So I'd like to have
something for my calendar.

2982
02:53:12,850 --> 02:53:15,730
People have that aversion
to a trophy hunting.

2983
02:53:15,820 --> 02:53:19,000
That's one of the other things that
drives people nuts about Africa.

2984
02:53:19,210 --> 02:53:20,980
Is it people going over
there for blood loss,

2985
02:53:20,981 --> 02:53:22,420
they're going over there just to kill.

2986
02:53:22,570 --> 02:53:24,450
They want to stuff it
and put on their wall,

2987
02:53:24,451 --> 02:53:27,610
this beautiful animal that should just
be observed and appreciate it for what it

2988
02:53:27,611 --> 02:53:30,100
is. Yeah. I,

2989
02:53:31,390 --> 02:53:34,000
that's something that I struggle with
an earlier I made a turn about something

2990
02:53:34,001 --> 02:53:35,980
being like a, like,
like a semantics thing.

2991
02:53:35,981 --> 02:53:40,981
Because if you go in hunt and you keep
something like you have right here in

2992
02:53:43,001 --> 02:53:47,170
your studio, you have a uh, a deer antler,
you gotta like a deer skull, right?

2993
02:53:48,340 --> 02:53:50,440
By really any definition
you'd say like you'd be like,

2994
02:53:50,441 --> 02:53:51,820
well that's a hunting trophy,
you know?

2995
02:53:51,940 --> 02:53:54,370
Does that make you then a hunting
trip like a trophy hunter,

2996
02:53:54,550 --> 02:53:58,480
even though you ate the deer
to be a non trophy hunter,

2997
02:53:58,481 --> 02:54:01,450
would that mean that you should have
thrown that deer head in the garbage in

2998
02:54:01,451 --> 02:54:02,500
order to be more peer?

2999
02:54:02,530 --> 02:54:06,520
Or is it more peer that you'd have
that you'd maintain that emblem and pay

3000
02:54:06,521 --> 02:54:09,820
respect to the animal in
perpetuity by having its head here.

3001
02:54:10,240 --> 02:54:15,070
So it's like you kept a trophy,
you kept the meat and kept the trophy.

3002
02:54:15,280 --> 02:54:17,470
But when people hear trophy hunter,
I think what the,

3003
02:54:17,530 --> 02:54:21,100
what that means in our culture is that
someone that just hunts for that purpose,

3004
02:54:21,130 --> 02:54:22,540
like he just wants to go kill that thing.

3005
02:54:22,930 --> 02:54:25,300
And this comes from guys
never hunted in Africa,

3006
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:30,190
but so much of the controversy about
Africa is that people are going there and

3007
02:54:30,191 --> 02:54:34,150
killing animals just for the
head and bringing them home.

3008
02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:37,220
And that way you're probably
trivialized and you experience,

3009
02:54:37,221 --> 02:54:42,221
but you're also not really looking at the
broad picture of how game gets managed

3010
02:54:42,401 --> 02:54:46,870
there and the importance
that the commodification of
wildlife plays in Africa.

3011
02:54:47,140 --> 02:54:51,550
Where here we have public owned,
publicly owned wildlife, you know,

3012
02:54:52,120 --> 02:54:56,170
so and we have a really strident system
where stringent system where we can

3013
02:54:56,260 --> 02:54:57,610
protect legally protect stuff.

3014
02:54:57,790 --> 02:55:00,700
But in Africa there's a great
argument to be made for.

3015
02:55:00,701 --> 02:55:04,040
If it wasn't for the value of
those animals to Westerners,

3016
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:05,930
if it wasn't for the hunting industry,

3017
02:55:06,110 --> 02:55:10,070
those animals wouldn't be in
those places where they are. Yeah,

3018
02:55:10,071 --> 02:55:14,690
they have those animals that way too many
forces and factors that would lead to

3019
02:55:14,691 --> 02:55:19,691
those being like ravaged ecosystems
from hunting from people,

3020
02:55:20,460 --> 02:55:21,293
I mean hunting farm,

3021
02:55:21,350 --> 02:55:26,180
people who are starving or who are
wanting to graze livestock in those areas.

3022
02:55:26,360 --> 02:55:31,360
And the fact that you bring in a currency
and you monetize them enables people

3023
02:55:31,371 --> 02:55:34,940
to preserve these large tracks of
land and have animals on there.

3024
02:55:35,150 --> 02:55:39,350
So you can look at like,
what is Joe Blow's motivation?

3025
02:55:39,740 --> 02:55:41,480
Joe Blow's motivation might be,

3026
02:55:41,481 --> 02:55:46,481
he thinks it'd be sweet to have a zebra
hide on his floor and you can condemn

3027
02:55:47,001 --> 02:55:50,990
Joe blow for thinking that.
But you really, to be fair,

3028
02:55:51,020 --> 02:55:54,170
you have to look at the impact that,

3029
02:55:54,171 --> 02:55:58,760
that money that he spent to get it
has on the broader economy and on the

3030
02:55:58,761 --> 02:56:01,160
wildlife politics of that place.

3031
02:56:01,370 --> 02:56:05,300
So it's way more complicated than what
anyone individual's motivations were.

3032
02:56:06,110 --> 02:56:11,080
You know? And it's just, I
just caution people and I,

3033
02:56:11,081 --> 02:56:11,930
and I,
I'll tell you what,

3034
02:56:11,931 --> 02:56:16,400
I've had my share of looking at pictures
of guys hunting an African and being

3035
02:56:16,401 --> 02:56:16,791
like,
dude,

3036
02:56:16,791 --> 02:56:19,430
you just went out and paid someone and
he showed you that and you're like, well,

3037
02:56:19,431 --> 02:56:20,690
that's what one of those is in shot it.

3038
02:56:21,290 --> 02:56:23,660
I've felt that a thousand times
looking at those pictures.

3039
02:56:23,930 --> 02:56:26,990
But it's one of those things that the
more I've learned about it and spoke to

3040
02:56:26,991 --> 02:56:31,040
people who've gone there and,
and read about it,

3041
02:56:31,070 --> 02:56:33,260
the more I've come to
admit that you know what,

3042
02:56:33,261 --> 02:56:37,040
what's going on in Africa is vastly more
complicated than what you're going to

3043
02:56:37,041 --> 02:56:40,820
get from reading about
Internet controversies that
people posting pictures.

3044
02:56:41,060 --> 02:56:44,030
You really need to study up on that stuff
before you condemn it because I think

3045
02:56:44,031 --> 02:56:46,070
you'll be, you'll be kind of
shocked by some of the stuff

3046
02:56:46,550 --> 02:56:49,190
if anybody's interested in it further.
We're just about out of time.

3047
02:56:49,191 --> 02:56:53,030
But Louie thorough has a documentary
through, how do you say his stand through,

3048
02:56:53,320 --> 02:56:57,550
through Louis through has a documentary
about a African hunting camps were kind

3049
02:56:57,551 --> 02:57:01,070
of goes into great detail with these
guys that run these camps about how these

3050
02:57:01,071 --> 02:57:04,310
animals, they essentially
wouldn't be there if it wasn't,

3051
02:57:04,311 --> 02:57:08,360
they would be extinct and we were on, we
were at a time. Okay. Um, all right dude,

3052
02:57:08,650 --> 02:57:11,870
uh, your book, you've got the
buffalo books published. Oh No.

3053
02:57:11,871 --> 02:57:13,040
You know what my first book,

3054
02:57:13,380 --> 02:57:14,213
MMM.

3055
02:57:15,270 --> 02:57:18,580
Which never had a chance in the real
world scavengers guide to oat cuisine at

3056
02:57:18,581 --> 02:57:21,910
came out long time ago. But I
got the rights to it back. Right.

3057
02:57:21,940 --> 02:57:24,730
And I published it digitally
as a scavengers guide.

3058
02:57:25,660 --> 02:57:26,493
MMM.

3059
02:57:27,090 --> 02:57:28,020
I hope people go read it.

3060
02:57:28,021 --> 02:57:31,170
It never got red on it came out like not
like my other books did man. And I've,

3061
02:57:31,180 --> 02:57:32,630
and like I said, they just
gave me my rights, writes

3062
02:57:32,650 --> 02:57:34,870
back, how's it going to get
it? How can someone get it? Oh,

3063
02:57:34,871 --> 02:57:36,970
it's on every place you can
buy digital books. Okay.

3064
02:57:36,971 --> 02:57:40,000
We'll put it goes on everywhere. We'll
put a link up to it, uh, after the show.

3065
02:57:40,001 --> 02:57:43,480
And I also put a link up to the Daniel
Boone thing that you did the animated

3066
02:57:43,490 --> 02:57:48,220
thing. Great. Joe was just up
to the time flu. It's over.
