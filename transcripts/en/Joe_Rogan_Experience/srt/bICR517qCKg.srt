1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,040
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,450
Buddhism as a religion,

3
00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:06,790
I mean at least in terms of
how we understand religion.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,803
Is it tax free?

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:08,590
Uh,

6
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:09,580
is it tax free?

7
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,031
Yeah.

8
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:12,580
Do you have tax free exemption the
same way that other religions too?

9
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,080
We personally don't.

10
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,580
But you could,

11
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,503
you could do that.

12
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:16,800
Yeah.

13
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,580
You'll get a fucking chase down,

14
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:19,414
don't do it.

15
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,253
And

16
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,350
it gets really,

17
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,280
really hairy when you
don't want to pay taxes.

18
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:24,690
They go,

19
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,211
oh,

20
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:26,044
really?

21
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,590
Time to take a little closer look
at the Buddhist Geek Organization.

22
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:29,830
Yeah.

23
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,720
I see what you're doing
on Saturday nights there.

24
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,613
Infiltrate.

25
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,841
Yeah.

26
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:34,100
I think with anything like Buddhism,

27
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:34,940
I mean you inherit,

28
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,430
but choosing that
framework we inherit all,

29
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,503
we inherit it.

30
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,070
And so there's a lot about um,

31
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,750
religions and spirituality
in general that is not,

32
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,940
that I don't personally like,

33
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:47,774
you know,

34
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,733
so,

35
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,873
um,

36
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,850
I think that there is a,

37
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,800
there's a tendency to project,

38
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,180
I mean you brought in the word divinity,

39
00:00:56,181 --> 00:01:00,590
so I'll use it like to
project our divinity onto the
teachers are onto some sort

40
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:02,730
of system and um,

41
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,790
it can be disempowering
for a lot of people.

42
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,770
People can get trapped
and beliefs that you know,

43
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,690
have been carried forward for,

44
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,441
you know,

45
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:11,690
years and centuries that aren't,

46
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,400
isn't forwarding anymore.

47
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,290
Um,

48
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,870
and so that sense like by
choosing to go under Buddhism,

49
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:19,280
we're also choosing to,

50
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,121
you know,

51
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,880
work on how we can evolve,

52
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,990
how we think about it.

53
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,140
And one thing that I really like is the,

54
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,150
is the practices themselves,

55
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:29,900
um,

56
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,520
the mind training aspect of it.

57
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,940
That's what's been really beneficial
to me and that's one of the reasons why

58
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:38,270
I've chosen to continue
cause if its impact,

59
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,660
the mind training aspects of it.

60
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,883
Like what,

61
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:43,530
what,

62
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:43,781
what,

63
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:47,650
what do you think is like the tangible
benefits of this mind training aspect of

64
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,120
it that you personally experience?

65
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,230
Personally I can say
personally I feel much,

66
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:54,770
much more,

67
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,850
much more open.

68
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,860
I'm much more generous,

69
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,780
compassionate.

70
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,860
There is a lot more freedom I can get
stuck on the smaller sense of self.

71
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:04,580
Meaning,

72
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:04,941
you know,

73
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:09,710
I have these thoughts of unworthiness
or self contraction or hatred or any of

74
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:10,370
those,

75
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,820
you know,

76
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,820
w biological kind of urges and at the
same time they're so transient and they're

77
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:17,630
so not who I am.

78
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:18,860
And I see that very,

79
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,850
very clearly that it kind of
diminishes in just a second.

80
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,770
I'm on the good days.

81
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Sometimes it's more intense and I've
learned to really work with that and learn

82
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:34,871
how to see clearly what's happening so
that I have the freedom to really choose

83
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:40,130
how to live my life in
a much more full way.

84
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,860
That just the evidence
that the Internet is real.

85
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,910
That is one of the best evidence is that
there are people that are just so far

86
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:49,460
beyond how fucking smart
you think smart is.

87
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,750
It's like remember when you
were like five or six years old,

88
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,680
you had like a lot of times you had like
this one kid in the neighborhood that

89
00:02:57,681 --> 00:02:59,150
maybe it was like a little bit bigger,

90
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,260
a little bit stronger than the other
kids and when you would play with them on

91
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:02,801
the field,

92
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,090
like he'd get like bummed out.

93
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:09,091
Like you get knocked over and shit like
remember what you thought that was like

94
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:10,660
that was a strong little kid.

95
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,070
But if you were there right now,

96
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,461
you'd be like,

97
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:12,911
get out of here.

98
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:13,744
You little fuck,

99
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,240
fuck knocking in everybody,

100
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,633
you know.

101
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,083
You know what I mean?

102
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,621
I,

103
00:03:18,621 --> 00:03:20,800
it was more secured that he had
freckles or something like that.

104
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:20,980
Yeah.

105
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,281
He'd be like,

106
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,750
get out he fucking little Weirdo.

107
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,770
Don't be mean to me.

108
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,090
I'm a grown ass man.

109
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,000
But that's what I feel like,

110
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,000
like technologically and,

111
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:35,590
and just the mental capacity of a
super genius in comparison to me.

112
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,980
I feel like if I'm that little kid and
like if I tried to figure out how the

113
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:42,700
fuck they figured out the Internet,

114
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,300
I just be like,

115
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,100
oh my brain isn't worked out good.

116
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,660
I can't talk to you.

117
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,100
You're freaking me out man.

118
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:48,851
You know,

119
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:49,181
if you,

120
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:52,510
if you went into one of those dudes
offices and they have those crazy like

121
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,710
goodwill hunting shit on the wall and
he's doing those equations that fucking

122
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,000
nobody understands,

123
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,690
you know,

124
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,220
that they'll work on for years.

125
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,361
You know,

126
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:03,030
even the professor didn't like,

127
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,730
how did you,

128
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,080
what does fuck yeah.

129
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:07,210
I remember like in goodwill
hunting the fucking dumb,

130
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,100
the janitor fixes the problem.

131
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,100
Then leave it open to the
janitor can work on the problem.

132
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,323
Really?

133
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:13,750
Yeah.

134
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,860
What if he just erased it?

135
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,270
What if he's just crazy?

136
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,141
He's not.

137
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:18,370
Why you had channeled her bitch,

138
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,450
this is a stupid story.

139
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,550
Here's a super genius.

140
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,011
Janitor it.

141
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,340
Get the fuck Outta here.

142
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,370
Get the fuck Outta here.

143
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,330
You're smarter than anybody.

144
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,100
You can figure out these
equations and nobody else can.

145
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,330
And you're also beautiful.

146
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,360
What are the odds and charming.

147
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,810
It's just so wacky,

148
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,980
wacky.

149
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,730
So I see we could spend the whole thing
talking about this because it's so,

150
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:40,990
it's one of those things where like,

151
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,880
there's a bunch of people in on a joke,

152
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:43,750
you know,

153
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,141
and you're like,

154
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,520
just wanting someone to say,

155
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:45,911
okay,

156
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,744
we're just fucking,

157
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,850
and no one does.

158
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:49,684
You know what I mean?

159
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:49,961
Well,

160
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,130
those belief systems,

161
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:54,940
the thing about having
those belief systems is that
they're very empowering for

162
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,260
people who believe in him.

163
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,130
Like if you,

164
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,690
if you look at it and go,

165
00:04:58,691 --> 00:04:59,171
wait a minute,

166
00:04:59,171 --> 00:04:59,530
wait a minute.

167
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,490
Fucking planet.

168
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,820
Xenu really insane.

169
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,170
Like I'm reading about this after you
brought up Excalibur while you were

170
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:08,741
talking about it,

171
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,120
and I pulled up that website,

172
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,340
that mock Scientology,

173
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:12,430
z new.net.

174
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:12,671
Oh,

175
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:13,451
I've never been there.

176
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:13,720
But this,

177
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,160
oh my favorite site.

178
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:15,311
Right.

179
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,690
They have everything they have,

180
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,680
they have the entire Scientology like,

181
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,560
like Whoa,

182
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,390
everything about what they believe.

183
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,430
All of the operating manual.

184
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,300
I grabbed everything,

185
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,300
wiki leaks and wasn't looking at that is
operating the operating Payton's manual

186
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:31,210
like level three,

187
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:35,890
which is apparently where I guess Tom
Cruise is like four or five or six or

188
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:36,251
something.

189
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,490
But he was three a couple years.

190
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,130
Like they have different manuals,

191
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:39,431
you know,

192
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:42,070
so he was three a couple of years
ago and now he's four or five or six.

193
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:44,980
I don't know where he's at and I haven't
been keeping up with his level what

194
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:45,611
rank is at,

195
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,250
but I know he's ranked up
because they've like given him,

196
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,110
they made up some new ward for him.

197
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,570
Did you ever see that video that leaked?

198
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,261
Yeah,

199
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:54,730
he's like using all this
stuff that was like,

200
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,564
they made up this one,

201
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,010
they made up this thing they'd never had.

202
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,580
It was a guardian of the galaxy,

203
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,520
kind of like gave it
to him and he was like,

204
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,370
he's like saying all that
shit that made no sense.

205
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,930
And using all their words and stuff.

206
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,764
Yeah,

207
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,650
the Internet and people putting
music to it and she had gorgeous.

208
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,990
Yeah.

209
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,570
It's so good to work of art.

210
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,201
It is.

211
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:12,591
It is.

212
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:12,831
Man.

213
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,664
Doesn't mean almost.

214
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,020
It is almost like
something that you would,

215
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,520
you'd see from some artists who's
doing so I'm like fucking piece.

216
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:19,870
Yeah,

217
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,703
know where he's going.

218
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,740
Oh Man.

219
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,220
That'd be so brilliant if like he
just all of a sudden flipped and told

220
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:25,560
everybody.

221
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah,

222
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,080
I've been just listening.

223
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:30,470
It helps my acting if I can pretend
to really be into Scientology,

224
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,330
but this long it's like
the dumb and dumber me,

225
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:33,230
the new one coming out.

226
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,220
It'd be seen the before.

227
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,511
No,

228
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:34,661
no.

229
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:34,940
I have,

230
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,451
oh my God.

231
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:36,051
It's genius.

232
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:36,621
But there's like a,

233
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:39,410
there's like a whole thing where
Jim Carey Garinger is Carrie.

234
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,490
Carrie Carrie's character
is like in an insane asylum.

235
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,780
Go over this over that chick.

236
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:48,410
The Mary Samsonite has it gone from the
first one and then it turns out he was

237
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:53,000
like joking like for like 20
years and yet Lloyd Lloyd,

238
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:54,950
you mean to tell me that you've been,

239
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,660
you've been faking for 20 years,

240
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:57,590
all for a gag.

241
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,191
And he's like,

242
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,024
Yup.

243
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,193
It's like,

244
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,870
that would be amazing if he did that.

245
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,623
Okay.

246
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:11,920
Okay.
