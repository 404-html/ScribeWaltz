1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,920
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,410
But I also think like,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,150
especially with these videos
that have been coming up,

4
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:09,030
just women attacking and
like Anthony gets saying,

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,320
that woman said that he was going to,

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,170
that woman has got like if he called
the police was going to say that he was

7
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:13,500
raped,

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,610
she was raped or you know,

9
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:15,180
attacking her

10
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,441
or whatever.

11
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:15,961
That's what he said,

12
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:16,591
that she said that,

13
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:16,891
um,

14
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,180
when she was hitting him,

15
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,690
she was saying that she was going to
say that he sexually assaulted her.

16
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,370
Right.

17
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:22,871
And by the way,

18
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:23,850
it's the opiate Anthony thing.

19
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:24,320
That's right.

20
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,531
Yeah.

21
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:25,430
The opie and Anthony thing,

22
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:26,264
if you don't know,

23
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,780
um,

24
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,860
our friends open,

25
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,671
Anthony Anthony.

26
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:28,881
Cool.

27
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:33,881
Mia was in New York City and he was taking
photographs and they got a photograph

28
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,730
of a woman and this woman got very upset.

29
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,930
He took a photograph of her,

30
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,540
so some sort of an altercation took place.

31
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,141
Um,

32
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:44,630
some words were exchanged
and she started hitting him.

33
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,890
So she was hitting him.

34
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,510
And if you don't know Anthony,

35
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:50,420
you don't know that he's a
gun nut and like a legit gun,

36
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:54,050
not who actually has a license to
conceal carry in New York City,

37
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,720
which is incredibly difficult to obtain.

38
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,960
But here's one strike for,

39
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:00,740
uh,

40
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,560
people who want people to have guns.

41
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,690
Anthony never pulled out that gun,

42
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,190
never it'd be it.

43
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:09,170
He obviously felt threatened.

44
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,690
He was getting hit by this one woman who,

45
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,160
Anthony is a nice guy,

46
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,960
but he is,

47
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,380
you know,

48
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,880
51 years old,

49
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,780
loves his drinking and I don't
think he lifts weights that much.

50
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,700
It's not like he's just like big scary,

51
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,163
you know,

52
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,670
Quentin Jackson,

53
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,170
rampage Jackson looking dude,

54
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:27,621
you know,

55
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,020
he's a,

56
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,060
he's a thin guy.

57
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:29,870
He's not a,

58
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,870
not a physically imposing guy and this
chick is beaten on him and he's got a gun

59
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:35,744
on him.

60
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,470
I don't,

61
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,490
I wasn't there.

62
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:40,880
So obviously I don't know what
the tone of the situation was.

63
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:42,410
I don't know how it got started.

64
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:42,860
I don't know.

65
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,860
I've read very little about it other than
he went on this rampage calling her an

66
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:50,300
animal and a cunt and all this,

67
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,223
all these different,

68
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:51,950
but what's,

69
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,900
what's hilarious is everything that he
said and his Twitter rampage that they're

70
00:01:56,901 --> 00:02:01,901
firing him before he said on the
radio show and they hired him for

71
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,330
the radio show.

72
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:10,331
If you paid attention to what he said
over the years and why he's entertaining

73
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:11,630
and how he says it,

74
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,380
he gets crazy about racial situations.

75
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,370
He gets crazy about certain aspects of
the African American community and he's

76
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:20,540
done it forever.

77
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,020
And so these things that he said after
getting punched that they were surprising

78
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:30,830
to serious who had heard him say
these things and they gave him checks.

79
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,480
It's kind of hilarious.

80
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,860
And also like one of the things that
people are pointing out all over la all

81
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:37,221
over,

82
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:37,940
um,

83
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,940
the Twitter sphere is they're showing
all these lyrics to rap songs that Sirius

84
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:46,340
has aired since Anthony
got fired for tweeting.

85
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,740
And the lyrics are ridiculous.

86
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,460
I mean,

87
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,091
oh yeah,

88
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:50,391
dude,

89
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:51,470
it's hardcore rap.

90
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,620
They,

91
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,320
they air hardcore rap lyrics.

92
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,191
So they've got,

93
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:55,521
you know,

94
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:57,040
nigger this and shoot,

95
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,930
suck my dick and this bitch that
pitches and you know that the craziest,

96
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,880
most radical,

97
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,211
you know,

98
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,044
hip hop shit.

99
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,240
And yet Anthony gets in trouble for this
thing that he did where he went on his

100
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,480
Twitter rampage and said
a bunch of shit that he's,

101
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,800
I bet you could.

102
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,200
I bet if someone was a
real opie and Anthony Fan,

103
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,420
you could probably go back through all
the opiate Anthony shows and pieced

104
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:26,421
together him actually saying those
words that are in those tweets

105
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,551
that's serious,

106
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,990
makes money off of racist.

107
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,711
That's serious.

108
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:30,544
Makes money off of it.

109
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,001
Well,

110
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:31,751
you know what man,

111
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,584
here's the thing.

112
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,040
Um,

113
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,640
I think what happens is that
these companies get really
terrified of the Twitter

114
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,474
storm.

115
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:37,850
Yeah.

116
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,591
They get like,

117
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,700
you saw that with a,

118
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,181
well,

119
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:42,850
you see it all the time with
the sponsors for rush Limbaugh,

120
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,470
but you see it with,

121
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,270
or I believe conservative
radio in general.

122
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,104
You see it with,

123
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,770
uh,

124
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,970
like Donald Trump had a,

125
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,871
I forget what it was,

126
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,820
a tie collection or some shit at Macy's.

127
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,470
Then there are all
these people on Twitter,

128
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:54,880
like tweeting the Macy's account,

129
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:57,760
like don't support him because I
don't remember what the issue was,

130
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:58,210
but they,

131
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,320
once it gets going,

132
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,300
the company feels
overwhelmed and they're like,

133
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,830
we have to respond because a thousand
people just retweeted this thing and they,

134
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,760
I think they just feel like the best
route is the 48 laws of power thing where

135
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,520
you just put a head on
the chopping block and,

136
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,060
and think later.

137
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,241
Oh,

138
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,560
I see their point of view.

139
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,850
I do if you,

140
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,400
but I don't think they were fans
of the opie and Anthony Show.

141
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,260
That's what I thinks
part of what's going on.

142
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,490
I don't think they listened.

143
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,460
I think there weren't a
lot of people complaining.

144
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,820
It's just like the money coming in.

145
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,770
It's a great show.

146
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,510
It's the reason why we're doing this show.

147
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,390
The reason why we're doing these
shows because of opie and Anthony.

148
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:31,581
Oh,

149
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:32,414
a lot of ways.

150
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,360
There's a direct chain of influences.

151
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,051
Um,

152
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,610
one of them being Tom Green,

153
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,850
Tom Green had his own show in
his house way back in the day.

154
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,950
And I remember going
over there and be like,

155
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,300
this is the craziest shit ever.

156
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,830
He's got server room,

157
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:47,980
he's got a Goddamn server room with
cables all through his living room and he

158
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:50,470
turned his living room
into a television show.

159
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,000
He just did a little too early.

160
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,250
He had a great innovative idea.

161
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:55,150
He did it a little too early.

162
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,110
That influenced us.

163
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,280
Anthony Kumina influenced me greatly
when he did live at the compound.

164
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:00,940
He did,

165
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,020
he does this thing live at the compound
where he set up a studio in his house in

166
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:06,970
Long Island and in his,

167
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,751
in his basement,

168
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:11,140
he has a green screen and he'll
fucking sing while he's holding guns.

169
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,470
Dude,

170
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,520
he's singing songs.

171
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,130
He's singing karaoke while
he's holding assault rifles.

172
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,120
All right.

173
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,350
And that,

174
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,770
I don't know if they have a page,

175
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,370
but that shit is hilarious.

176
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,700
And I saw him doing that while he was
still on opiate Anthony who was doing it

177
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,380
just for fun and I was like,

178
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:26,951
oh my god,

179
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,600
this is genius.

180
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,990
He set up a green screen.

181
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,651
He set up an a,

182
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:34,130
a real like professional stage with a
green screen and behind the green screen

183
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,880
he would have like video of
Manhattan or he would have like,

184
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,560
like I was going to
totally steal that idea.

185
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,560
I might still put a green screen behind
me for a w if we do get that tri quarter

186
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,020
cried tri caster thing that we'll do it.

187
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,310
In respect to Anthony,

188
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,190
it's a big part of what they do
and the ethic of the Internet.

189
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:56,191
It seems to be like the social ethic
seems to be evolving way quicker,

190
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,080
way stronger than at anytime that I can
ever remember in in cultural history.

191
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,800
I never remember these like big movements
shifts and how people talked and

192
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:10,010
behaved in the words that were accepted
in the words that weren't accepted and

193
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:10,581
you know,

194
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:15,581
and just w w just these giant trends
that take place in just wash through

195
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,051
culture.

196
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:18,500
They didn't,

197
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,030
they didn't move this quick before.

198
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,970
It's because we practice like
a thought mass correction,

199
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,430
which I'm not entirely
convinced it's a good thing yet.

200
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,080
I still haven't really
decided if it's good or bad,

201
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:31,040
but if you look at that woman who took
the flight from London to South Africa

202
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,680
and tweeted out that
insensitive shit about like,

203
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,131
you know,

204
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:36,590
like I hope I don't get aids when
I land in Africa or something.

205
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,820
Uh,

206
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,720
she finished it though.

207
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:39,650
She said just kidding.

208
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:40,220
I'm white.

209
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,790
Oh yeah.

210
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,260
Yeah.

211
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,950
So is he even even worse?

212
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,270
So Buffy were better.

213
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,280
You mean that that's what made it funny.

214
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,170
Before her flight landed in South Africa,

215
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:51,260
I think she's already lost
her job and the global uproar.

216
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,470
So that person learned that
this is not socially acceptable.

217
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:55,400
And why did they learn that?

218
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,140
Because the Internet
gave them that lesson.

219
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:57,651
Well,

220
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,350
she should have been a comedian because
that would have been fucking hilarious.

221
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,041
You know,

222
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,880
if a really funny comedian said that like
a license last year said that when she

223
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,491
went to Africa,

224
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,231
Holy Shit,

225
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:07,064
that would be funny.

226
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,300
Is it the wrong thing to say?

227
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:08,900
Yes.

228
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,770
It most certainly.

229
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,190
Yeah.

230
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,200
But if you work in PR for some,

231
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,250
I think it was a,

232
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,270
I don't even want to say the company,

233
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:15,350
but just a big media company.

234
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,910
So you think she was
on pills or something?

235
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,020
Like why was she fucking say,

236
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,283
I mean,

237
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,381
what did what,

238
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:24,010
how could a person with in
corporate America thing,

239
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,490
it's okay to put some on your Twitter.

240
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,661
I have no idea.

241
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:26,990
Kidding.

242
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,351
I'm not,

243
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:28,184
I'm white.

244
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,443
Lol.

245
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,490
Hope we don't get aids.

246
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:32,691
Just kidding.

247
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:33,524
I'm white.

248
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,573
Wow.

249
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,511
Yeah,

250
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:36,500
that's crazy person.

251
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,503
It's funny though.

252
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,410
Still funny.

253
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,430
It's a horrible thing to say,

254
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,740
but the point is like crazy
people are being called out.

255
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:43,551
There's still crazy,

256
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:43,851
but yeah,

257
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:44,750
we can call them out.

258
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:45,730
So you're going to ruin a lot.

259
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,580
Good jokes.

260
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,290
You are a lot of jobs.

261
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
People are losing their jobs like
Anthony just for going off Twitter.

262
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,010
Well,

263
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,411
you know the,

264
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:53,690
the Anthony thing is,

265
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:54,260
um,

266
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,490
it's particularly weird because that's
sort of why he had been known for that.

267
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,190
Like you guys had a
show where it was like,

268
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,340
there were openly joking
about racism all the time.

269
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,310
Like the other day he had Amy
Schumer on one of the best of shows.

270
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,480
It was from years ago and they were
talking about interracial porn and Amy

271
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,650
Schumer was fucking hilarious.

272
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,900
But she was saying that she,

273
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,130
she was so funny.

274
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:16,400
Man,

275
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,080
it's really fun and she's so sharp.

276
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,460
Um,

277
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,280
she was saying that she's
never fucked a black guy,

278
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:26,360
but she likes watching
black on white porn and uh,

279
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,250
Anthony was talking about,

280
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,760
uh,

281
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,630
how sad it was and that uh,

282
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,221
his,

283
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:31,550
uh,

284
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,490
his racism won't let him watch it.

285
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,710
Like his racism won't let him watch,

286
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,220
uh,

287
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,930
a black guy fucking a white girl.

288
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,140
Wait.

289
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,440
There is a certain that is
pretty racist if you can't,

290
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:45,740
if you can't handle a black
man fucking a white person,

291
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,013
it's pretty,

292
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,651
he's joking.

293
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:49,790
He is a comedian.

294
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,890
I think a lot of people forget it.

295
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:53,810
It's a comedy show that he's one
of the funniest people I know.

296
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:55,260
That just doesn't go on stage.

297
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:55,930
It's a,

298
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,310
it's a,

299
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,560
yeah.

300
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,820
There's most certainly a comedian,

301
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,150
whether he goes on stage in front of
a live audience or whether he goes,

302
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,280
do you think his rampage was
meant to be funny though?

303
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,120
No.

304
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,901
That's the problem.

305
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:05,920
That's part of the problem.

306
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,640
That's not,

307
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,770
that's not done for entertainment
or for then you're not,

308
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,270
then your profession
doesn't really matter.

309
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,330
My issue with all these things,

310
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:13,870
um,

311
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,030
is that like many things in life,

312
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,110
they're not black and white.

313
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:17,921
You know,

314
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:18,850
this is not black and white.

315
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:19,960
I think Anthony is awesome.

316
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:20,794
I love that dude.

317
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,680
He's one of my favorite
people on radio ever.

318
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,843
He's great.

319
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,230
He's just funny as shit.

320
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,640
He's smart as fuck.

321
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,860
He knows a lot of things
about different things.

322
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:30,694
He's very,

323
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,680
he's very interesting the
way he looks at the world.

324
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,170
He says a lot of crazy
shit about black people.

325
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:35,711
He does.

326
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:36,820
He has for a long time.

327
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,160
I don't know his personal experiences.

328
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,050
I don't know what he's around,

329
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:45,340
where he's formulated these
ideas about certain black people.

330
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:47,080
But I also know that he
has a lot of black friends.

331
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,580
Patrice and him were close.

332
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,091
You know,

333
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:49,830
he's uh,

334
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,170
you know,

335
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,760
black comics that come
on the show all the time,

336
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:52,430
that a friendly with him.

337
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,740
He's not a mean person.

338
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:54,790
He's not a bad guy.

339
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,170
If you're a nice person,

340
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:57,190
he'll be nice to you too.

341
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,443
That said,

342
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,400
I don't know what the
fuck went down that night.

343
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,140
Who knows?

344
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,381
Yeah.

345
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:01,670
You know,

346
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,790
I mean he did get attacked,

347
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,630
which is just crazy,

348
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:06,000
but he's leading up to it.

349
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:09,900
He also used to always talk about
statistics about his city in New York and

350
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,501
stuff like that,

351
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,220
about how,

352
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,760
you know,

353
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,320
Eh,

354
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,620
the,

355
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:12,841
the,

356
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,670
the race issues with that.

357
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
And so I think that what he,

358
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,791
because he didn't,

359
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,541
when he went off,

360
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,260
he didn't really say all blacks are this,

361
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:22,591
you know,

362
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:27,591
he was kind of just talking about the
person that attacked and was a savage,

363
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:28,681
you know,

364
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:29,514
it was what he said.

365
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,570
He called her a continent,

366
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:32,200
an animal and all this different shit.

367
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,300
If it was a white chick and
he called her an animal,

368
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,090
he would have been fun.

369
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,361
Yeah.

370
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:37,190
And we would have called
her the same exact word.

371
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,300
It's,

372
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:38,571
look,

373
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,860
it's all very tricky.

374
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:40,071
You know,

375
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:41,450
when I always say about when,

376
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,140
whenever you see a situation
where two people get into a fight,

377
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,380
it's not always just one guy's fault.

378
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,150
Sometimes it's both guys fault.

379
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,250
Sometimes one a different person.

380
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,630
Like if you talk to this guy,

381
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:57,510
it would have never turned into a violent
altercation and maybe you would have

382
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:58,580
walked away shaking hands.

383
00:10:58,581 --> 00:10:59,200
Sorry man.

384
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,340
Ah,

385
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,173
no worries dude.

386
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,270
And another guy talking to the same guy.

387
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,590
It might lead to a bloody fist fight
and it's just a matter of how do you

388
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:07,730
communicate with people?

389
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,660
Who is this woman?

390
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:09,410
I've been,

391
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,630
I was in New York City with
this chick that I was dating.

392
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:15,260
We were walking down the street
and this girl was so nice.

393
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,310
She was so nice.

394
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:16,461
I mean,

395
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:16,731
she was,

396
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:17,090
no,

397
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,451
she wasn't,

398
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:19,430
she wouldn't be mean to anyone ever.

399
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,900
No mean faces.

400
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:22,070
She didn't have anything like that in her.

401
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:22,910
So,

402
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,181
um,

403
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,020
we're walking in,

404
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:29,021
this black couple is walking in the same
direction and the girl steps in between

405
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,670
her and I and pushes this
girl that I was with.

406
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,250
Just push her move,

407
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:35,084
bitch.

408
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,500
Just move bitch,

409
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:39,380
because you know we were walking this
way and they were walking towards us and

410
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:41,630
she's just decided that that was her spot.

411
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,110
So has she has elbow.

412
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:44,690
This girl said move bitch.

413
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,040
And she pushed it aside and I am
thinking we're about to go to war.

414
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,611
I'm like,

415
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:50,630
we're gonna about to go to war.

416
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:53,230
And I'm the knock out the girl first
because I don't want to have to deal with

417
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:53,411
her.

418
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:54,610
Why I'm hitting out of the guy.

419
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,061
I'm like,

420
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:55,930
this is about to be a fight.

421
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,070
And then the,

422
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,330
that chick just turned went white
bitches or something along the lines like

423
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:01,601
that,

424
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,580
some white and walked away and kept going.

425
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,410
Fortunately because it was like,

426
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,513
like an all,

427
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,750
all of a sudden I was like,

428
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:07,900
Damn.

429
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,180
I was like close to a
fist fight for no reason,

430
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,781
you know?

431
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:13,900
And it just happened to be that chick
was black and it just happened to be the

432
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,520
girl that I was with was white and blonde.

433
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,750
But that happens.

434
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,260
There's black assholes out there just
like there's white hassles out there.

435
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,940
There's Chinese assholes out there,

436
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,510
you know,

437
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,100
that doesn't make me racist.

438
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,080
That makes me scared of people that are
assholes and they come in all forms,

439
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,381
Bro.

440
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:29,601
I,

441
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:31,120
I grew up in a Boston neighborhood,

442
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,801
Jamaica.

443
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:33,720
There was Jamaica plain,

444
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,530
the place where I lived at
before I moved to Newton,

445
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:40,090
which was our cushy and Nice Jamaica
plain was Phil with his Irish savages.

446
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,160
They were dangerous fucking kids.

447
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,630
These dangerous Irish kids.

448
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:45,400
And if you ran into him like they,

449
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,200
it didn't matter what race they were,

450
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:47,501
it's like,

451
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:47,870
who's the,

452
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,760
who's the savage?

453
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,530
These guilds kids were savages.

454
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,250
Didn't matter if they
were white or Chinese.

455
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:52,540
You,

456
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,870
you walked down the wrong street in
Chinatown and you run into some crazy

457
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,460
Chinese gang that wants to fuck you up,

458
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,450
you're not happy.

459
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:58,931
I mean,

460
00:12:58,931 --> 00:12:59,171
it's not,

461
00:12:59,171 --> 00:12:59,441
it's not,

462
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:00,580
it's not better that way.

463
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:02,200
There's all sorts of races.

464
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,390
Every race contains savages.

465
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:05,920
Every race contains assholes,

466
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,641
you know.

467
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:09,370
And the problem is when
it's a black person,

468
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,020
it's getting attacked by white guy.

469
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:11,741
You know,

470
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:15,610
you gotta be real specific that it's
that person that's a piece of shit.

471
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,200
And if some other people jumped in,

472
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,150
it's them that are pieces of shit.

473
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:20,350
It's not the whole town.

474
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:21,580
It's not all black people.

475
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:22,180
It's not,

476
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,450
you know,

477
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,670
it's just there's a
certain type of person,

478
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,620
whether it's white or black or whatever.

479
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,000
That's a piece of shit,

480
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:28,841
you know,

481
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,060
and I don't know if it's this lady,

482
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,990
I don't know what,

483
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,510
who knows what happened
to her that that day,

484
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:34,991
you know,

485
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:35,980
who knows what happened to her,

486
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,540
who knows what's going on in her life.

487
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,370
And all of a sudden this
guy's taking pictures at her.

488
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:40,450
She wants to punch him in the face.

489
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,830
Do you remember what time it was?

490
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:42,020
I,

491
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,430
it was,

492
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,890
I forgot to look to see
actually what time it occurred,

493
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:48,760
but I think it was around two to
3:00 AM wearing the Twitter happens.

494
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,480
Uh,

495
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:49,840
but,

496
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,440
uh,

497
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,190
you know,

498
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,450
I understand he's,

499
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,370
if you looked at his photos on Instagram,

500
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,170
he was taking a lot of photos of the city,

501
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,970
a lot of photos of cops and
construction workers and,

502
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,923
and stuff like that.

503
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,990
I get having a great camera,

504
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,580
uh,

505
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:02,840
that,

506
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,670
that you're playing,

507
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,010
like New York's empty and you're downtown.

508
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,010
And you're taking photo and though
a woman's walking in the distance,

509
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:09,191
yeah,

510
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:09,761
you're taking her,

511
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:10,690
cause it's a photo.

512
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:10,930
It's,

513
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,890
it's cool.

514
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,461
But,

515
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:12,701
but,

516
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:13,360
but you know,

517
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,440
I don't know what happened here,

518
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:17,300
but what does seem to happen that he,

519
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,380
she did attack him and he didn't have
a police or a deal with the police.

520
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:22,601
No,

521
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:22,631
no,

522
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:22,780
he

523
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,390
doesn't call nine one one because you
figure like they wouldn't do anything

524
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:25,890
right.

525
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,690
You know,

526
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,523
maybe he's right,

527
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,760
but I don't think the right way to
handle it is going on Twitter and going

528
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:31,700
fucking crazy.

529
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:32,534
And I mean,

530
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,820
I think that that's something that someone
does when you just want to lash out.

531
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:37,481
And for him,

532
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,380
he likes to,

533
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:38,591
uh,

534
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,060
use social media to,

535
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:40,391
you know,

536
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:41,320
to get points across.

537
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:42,011
And that's a point though.

538
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:46,330
The black on white violence has been a
point of interest of his for a long time.

539
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,081
You know,

540
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:51,100
and there's a reality that exists just
like white on black violence exists,

541
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,180
just like all kinds of violence exists.

542
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,060
And Anthony is a guy who was
particularly concerned with that.

543
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,680
It's one of the reasons
why he carries a gun.

544
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,160
Right.

545
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,700
I mean he's a rare person that has a
concealed carry permit in New York City.

546
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,331
He's one of them.

547
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:03,050
It's pretty hard.

548
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,400
It's got a big ass fucking blue actually,

549
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,890
so let's check hitting him while he's
armed with a deadly weapon and then five

550
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:11,420
other people jump in apparently.

551
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:16,010
And the whole thing's chaos and I would
have loved to for it to be avoided,

552
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:21,011
but I think serious lost the potential
opportunity to engage in a discussion

553
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,450
about this,

554
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,460
about violence in New York City,

555
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,140
about violence in general,

556
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,920
the people interacting with each other
about interacting on social media,

557
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,330
interacting when you're hot with
fucking rage and you're just venting and

558
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:39,710
ranting and consequently continental and
what is your actual intent and and what

559
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:43,640
is my job as a representative
of your Sirius Xm?

560
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:47,480
Am I am allowed to be Anthony or do I
have to be an entity that only thinks like

561
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:51,680
Sirius XM wants me to think and only
tweets like Sirius XM wants me tweet.

562
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,180
When are you clocked off work?

563
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,350
Exactly know and when,

564
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:54,530
when,

565
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,363
when are you not,

566
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,350
I'm not supporting him right in this.

567
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:59,090
I'm saying this is,

568
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:04,450
this is a very tricky situation where the
company has to be real careful because

569
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,120
part of what you do is you
promote free speech and you,

570
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,640
you have a radio show and you have
this network that's uncensored.

571
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,580
There's net was,

572
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,050
it was the coolest thing about Sirius
was you could get Howard stern on it and

573
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:21,050
he could swear it was the
greatest thing of all time.

574
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,430
Like from now on,

575
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:27,290
he's unchained and Opie and Anthony
are unchained and comedy is unchained.

576
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,243
You can watch,

577
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,600
you can hear all my bits.

578
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,280
It's totally uncensored.

579
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,390
They have them on Sirius.

580
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,290
It's beautiful.

581
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,060
So if all of a sudden you decide that you
don't like what a guy says on Twitter,

582
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,700
so his opinions,

583
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:43,190
which are very similar that
he's voiced on the radio,

584
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,181
very similar,

585
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:45,110
if not identical,

586
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,310
will now be silenced.

587
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,690
It gets a little squirrely.

588
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,640
The whole thing is a backlash.

589
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,960
It's a backlash to the,

590
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,710
the racism and or implied
racism of his tweets.

591
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,220
You know,

592
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,053
look,

593
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,501
did I do,

594
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:01,640
I wish that he just went on the radio
and explained himself and more than 140

595
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:02,151
characters?

596
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:02,720
Yes.

597
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,110
Cause I bet he could vented the exact
same range the next day with no Twitter

598
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,580
thing and people would not have had a
problem with it if he said it with his

599
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:11,181
words,

600
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:12,530
if he explained what happened,

601
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,730
there's a real problem with fucking
getting out anything super important where

602
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:21,290
you don't want to have any mistakes
and how you're being perceived with 140

603
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,124
characters.

604
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:22,740
You know,

605
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,220
you're saying cut animal savage,

606
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:25,701
you don't,

607
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:26,390
you know,

608
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,410
he's not talking,

609
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,970
he's writing a bunch of shit down.

610
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,880
So you mad that he's
conveying those thoughts.

611
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,610
Do not think that he would have
those thoughts of this chick hit him.

612
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,110
Do you expect them to be,

613
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:36,920
you know,

614
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,510
Eh,

615
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,040
angelic and his approach to violence?

616
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:40,221
Like,

617
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:43,610
I don't know what you're looking for
here because if it's just that you think

618
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:44,840
that what he said is racist,

619
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,580
have you ever listened to that show?

620
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,560
Because if you listen to that show,

621
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,190
he says like that all the time.

622
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,470
I'll say if you have a job
as a show host or a pundit,

623
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,740
you really need to be allowed to say
what you want on your social media.

624
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,574
Even if it

625
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,210
kind of,

626
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:57,510
you know,

627
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,343
damages or,

628
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,271
but no,

629
00:17:59,271 --> 00:17:59,630
but,

630
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,463
but no,

631
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,221
because look,

632
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:04,310
if he said all Jews need to be thrown
into an oven and pissed on while they're

633
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:05,144
on fire.

634
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:05,870
No,

635
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,180
no,

636
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,710
that's right.

637
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,550
That's a little bit different.

638
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:07,691
So,

639
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:07,870
but,

640
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,680
but is it different because where does,

641
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,060
where does one draw the line?

642
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,650
What if he said that and he's only joking?

643
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,000
It turns out he's actually Jewish.

644
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,110
Is that okay?

645
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,060
I don't know nearly enough
about him or the show,

646
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,020
so I really don't know.

647
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,470
I think it's the same thing.

648
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,080
I think when,

649
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,830
when you say something absolutely,

650
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,480
totally awful like that,

651
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,040
like all Jews should be like,

652
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
you can't be associated with my company.

653
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,321
Right?

654
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:28,840
Like you can't,

655
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,660
it's not a serious person at that point.

656
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,730
That's a crazy person.

657
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,450
And it's a dangerous person too,

658
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:37,110
because who knows what percentage of the
population's listening that's unhinged.

659
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,000
It's been waiting for a
guy like you to come along.

660
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,490
But he didn't do that,

661
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,390
you know?

662
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,511
Well,

663
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:47,511
he did his respond to a person who
attacked him and then talk in very,

664
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:48,240
uh,

665
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,630
racial terms about the scenario.

666
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,530
And he has in the past on the
radio show about what it's like to,

667
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:55,850
uh,

668
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,800
worry about black
violence on white people.

669
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,160
Yeah.

670
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,401
And,

671
00:18:59,401 --> 00:18:59,731
and that's,

672
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:01,740
what is that like the young Turks,

673
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,280
uh,

674
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,061
thing you saw,

675
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,200
I don't know if you saw that or not,

676
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:04,850
but that was,

677
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,581
they called them a racist.

678
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:08,460
That was one of the worst
things I've ever seen.

679
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,323
I lost,

680
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,163
I'm sorry.

681
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,310
All respect for them just based off
of that one interview because it was

682
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,600
completely,

683
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,810
you can know that they
don't know the back story.

684
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,750
They don't know.

685
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,990
They don't listen to the show.

686
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,330
It's an interesting thing though,

687
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:21,721
isn't it?

688
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:22,051
When you're,

689
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:23,700
you're looking at
someone who doesn't know,

690
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:24,151
Anthony,

691
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:24,870
doesn't know the show,

692
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,310
doesn't know the backstory
and is responding to just
deciding everything right

693
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:29,731
there.

694
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:29,941
You know,

695
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:33,450
that he was perving and he's taking a
picture of this woman coming up the street

696
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,780
and not knowing about all those other
pictures that he had taken and that he is

697
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:37,740
an amateur photographer.

698
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,650
He loves taking pictures in a candid
photo of a woman walking down the street.

699
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,050
She's pretty and she had
long legs and just said,

700
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,250
nice body look good.

701
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:44,570
You know,

702
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,280
I've heard three in the
morning dressed up like street,

703
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,430
absolutely.

704
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,263
Street meat,

705
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,143
dairy,

706
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:49,610
but,

707
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,990
but they jumped on him
unfairly and that's like,

708
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,330
that was like Fox News.

709
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:53,841
It was like,

710
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:54,080
wait,

711
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,000
aren't you supposed to
be the opposite of this?

712
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,461
No,

713
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,840
I don't think it was like Fox News.

714
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:01,120
I think it was like they
perceived what his word.

715
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,130
I'm telling you there's a fucking real
problem with saying something like that

716
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:06,420
at 140 characters.

717
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,320
It's stupid.

718
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,410
Like I've said some dumb
shit on Twitter before.

719
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:15,120
I've had people write full blogs on like
one tweet that I had that it was like a

720
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:15,640
joke,

721
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,590
just a joke tweet.

722
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,143
I get that.

723
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,710
I get that.

724
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:20,820
You could decide that,

725
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,890
you know you have a green
light to write something.

726
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,390
It's 140 characters,

727
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,010
doesn't work.

728
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,840
It doesn't work for anything important.

729
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,700
If you really had a situation where you
thought your life was in danger or you

730
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,500
thought you were,

731
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,830
you know you're going to go unconscious
or you're gonna lose your eyesight,

732
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:39,510
like apparently had
like spots on his eyes,

733
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,490
wouldn't you want to hear that?

734
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,990
Like the full version of it?

735
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,020
I think if Anthony just would tell the
full version of it on the air and avoid

736
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:49,660
the tweets,

737
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,600
none of this would've happened so he
wouldn't be able to express himself the

738
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:53,560
exact same way.

739
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,040
That fucking cunt animal he have
been able to say whatever he wanted.

740
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,360
He would have been able to talk in
depth about black on white violence,

741
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,820
which I'm not saying
that's all that exists.

742
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,680
There's plenty of white on black violence.

743
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,514
There's plenty.

744
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,260
I'm saying that it exists.

745
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,360
I mean to pretend it doesn't exist,

746
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,590
it's pretty silly to me to pretend there's
not black people that will hit white

747
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:15,580
people and robbed them.

748
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,120
Just like to pretend it's not white people
who will hit black people and robbed

749
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:19,720
them.

750
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,770
Of course it exists.

751
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:21,130
Yeah.

752
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,120
Racism exists.

753
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:26,320
Violent racism from random
people on both sides can end,

754
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:27,250
does exist.

755
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,850
So is he right in saying that it exists
from them or what do you have to qualify

756
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:35,950
it first by saying that there's a lot of
piece of shit white people out there as

757
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:36,430
well.

758
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,263
I don't know.

759
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:37,901
You know,

760
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:38,321
I don't know,

761
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:40,960
but in my opinion with what
they're doing is silly.

762
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,020
This is a quote from Penn Jillette today.

763
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,590
Penn says this.

764
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:49,030
If I'm in a position where I cross
somebody who was carrying a gun and can,

765
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,950
can defend themselves and hurt me,

766
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:54,730
and their choice is to write angry stuff
on Twitter instead of fighting me back.

767
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,901
Wonderful.

768
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:56,620
Gandhi.

769
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,580
That's Gandy.

770
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:57,971
Yeah.

771
00:21:57,971 --> 00:21:58,804
I don't agree with that.

772
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,710
I think just cause you have a gun that
doesn't make you any more special,

773
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:03,191
and I'm like,

774
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:03,371
well,

775
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:04,390
I didn't use my gun.

776
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:04,751
It's like,

777
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:06,320
that shouldn't even be on
the table in the first place.

778
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,720
It certainly should be on the table.

779
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,010
If someone's trying to take your life.

780
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,890
What's the difference between someone
punishing you with her knuckles and

781
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:13,060
someone beating you to death?

782
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,110
How much,

783
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,030
however much of a background
do you have in violence?

784
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,400
Have you ever seen someone get
knocked unconscious in a street fight?

785
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,743
Uh,

786
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,501
actually yeah,

787
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:25,501
but on Youtube I've seen in real life
I've seen in real life a few times and

788
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,410
it's terrifying.

789
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,270
I saw in real life once in Hollywood,

790
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,090
there was a a moment in
front of the comedy store,

791
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:31,930
we're all hanging out.

792
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,960
It was after a show and this guy and
this other guy got in this argument and

793
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,730
there was traffic going by and they're
right in front of the House of Blues,

794
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:43,360
which is directly across the
street from the comedy store.

795
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,380
And in the middle of this argument there's
back and forth and it's a white guy

796
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:52,000
and a black guy and you see them start
to like swinging at each other and the

797
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:54,640
white guy goes into a full panic.

798
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,850
All I remember is this guy like standing
like wincing his eyes and flailing with

799
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:04,960
his hands like literally had it would
just in full panic and this black eyes,

800
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:10,290
I see him hit him and I see cars go
in front of it and I don't know what

801
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,080
happened.

802
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,441
I just,

803
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:12,280
I know that they're,

804
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,800
they're hitting each other because
the white guy was flailing,

805
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,240
but I don't see the connection.

806
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,790
And then the car goes back,

807
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,091
you know,

808
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:23,620
the car passes and the guys flat out
cold on the concrete just in serious

809
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:24,010
trouble.

810
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,880
He's in the street.

811
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,230
There's cars going by.

812
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,380
He's in a fight with a guy and he's
completely unconscious and everybody's

813
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:30,041
screaming.

814
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,340
There's cars honking this
guys out cold on the street.

815
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,230
That guy could die easy.

816
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,041
And again,

817
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,800
we tell you something that
a woman can do that too.

818
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:39,250
You just like a man can do that to you.

819
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,550
If you don't think that there's women
out there that can punch you in the face

820
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:44,860
and knock you unconscious because
you never been punched by a,

821
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,840
there's a lot of women that
can punch really fucking hard.

822
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:48,920
I,

823
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,570
you know this,

824
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,740
see these snacks,

825
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,590
that's my friend Miriam,

826
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:54,590
Miriam Nakamoto.

827
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,780
She's eight time World Moy Thai champion.

828
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,760
She beat a man and a kickboxing bout.

829
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,603
She's beautiful.

830
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,501
She's a nice person.

831
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:01,251
She makes snacks.

832
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:03,620
Now believe that chick
punches you in the face.

833
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:04,231
You're fucks.

834
00:24:04,231 --> 00:24:04,920
Ceville,

835
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,331
you know,

836
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:06,170
like for real,

837
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,480
like a regular guy who
doesn't know how to fight,

838
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,130
she'll beat the fucking breaks off you.

839
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,510
It's not not good.

840
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,280
So he doesn't know
anything about this girl.

841
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,000
If the girl starts teeing off on him
with left and rights and she's got like

842
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:18,020
precision punching,

843
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,123
guess what?

844
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,570
You're going to go unconscious.

845
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:20,990
Yeah.

846
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,510
So should you applaud him for
night pulling out his gun?

847
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,613
Yeah.

848
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:24,960
Yeah.

849
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,840
You shouldn't pull out
a gun in that situation.

850
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,540
And he did the right thing
so that I agree with them.

851
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:30,591
Yeah.

852
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:33,880
I just wouldn't go as far as
saying that he is a Gandhi.

853
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,723
Like that's I,

854
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,450
he's choking.

855
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:35,691
Yeah,

856
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:35,991
I know.

857
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:37,610
He's twice on it's written.

858
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,511
See when it's written,

859
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:39,261
you get all fucked up.

860
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:40,250
You get all fucked up.

861
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:42,140
Even you the regular person.

862
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,650
Yeah,

863
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,680
of course it's going to get closed.

864
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,830
It's impossible to tell sarcasm.

865
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:46,370
Like I,

866
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,770
I've thought that he was serious
because he's a pretty serious guy.

867
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:50,360
Guy Realized that.

868
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,150
He realized he does a
show in Vegas and shit,

869
00:24:52,151 --> 00:24:53,230
but he's very serious.

870
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,500
A lot of serious ideas.

871
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,363
He's serious.

872
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:55,791
I mean,

873
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,900
he's joking about that
by saying he's gone.

874
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,530
He's premise.

875
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,140
The series,

876
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,400
the premise is absolutely serious.

877
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:02,180
It's true.

878
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,120
Is there any way to see a security
video of how this went down?

879
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:05,983
Good question.

880
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,710
Good question.

881
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,720
Given how serious is a big company,

882
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,960
it's kind of a big implications to
drop one of your biggest host so well.

883
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,390
Their outrage was all over online.

884
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,020
You know what I mean?

885
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,190
People went crazy about it.

886
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,031
Here's going crazy.

887
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:18,260
There's petitions right now.

888
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:18,891
They're up to like,

889
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:23,270
I think last I saw it was 15,000 you know
there's the cancer once canceling it.

890
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:27,410
They have to be getting hurt by this
because honestly Howard stern and opie and

891
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:27,831
Anthony,

892
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:29,060
that's pretty much,

893
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,571
you know,

894
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:30,930
fueling that channel.

895
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,110
I,

896
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,420
I would imagine.

897
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,081
Do you know that?

898
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:35,120
For sure because I don't know
what they make their money off.

899
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:35,841
I have no idea.

900
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:36,800
I would just be guessing.

901
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,041
Well,

902
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:40,490
I would imagine that opie and
Anthony has definitely a huge pie.

903
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,660
What's a great Chai

904
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,100
there?

905
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,660
It's a great show and by the way,

906
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:47,470
if it was on the Internet it would still
be awesome if they just switched to the

907
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:47,890
Internet.

908
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,551
It'd be huge.

909
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:51,100
I mean it might be a great
opportunity for them if they meet,

910
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,200
they cancel Anthony if they fire Anthony,

911
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,010
just hope he's still under

912
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,840
contract mean how's that work there?

913
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,610
What Ob said today is that him and Jim
will be back on Monday next Monday.

914
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,870
Well I said they might have,

915
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,830
they might be making it the opn
Jim show just based on contracts,

916
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,300
but what's interesting is is leading up
to this is how much [inaudible] has been

917
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:11,620
talking about that he's done.

918
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,060
He's not going to sign a contract.

919
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:13,570
He does.

920
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,590
He wants to do a podcast.

921
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:19,591
He's done and this whole timing of this
is very interesting because sometimes

922
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:21,364
that's how the university,

923
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:21,940
yeah,

924
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,050
it's very interesting.

925
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,093
Very,

926
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,373
very interesting.

927
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:25,830
Yeah.

928
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,490
Wonder Man,

929
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,600
I hope they do a podcast.

930
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:27,811
Look,

931
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:28,710
the show's awesome.

932
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,281
It's funny.

933
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:30,460
Show to watch little Jimmy.

934
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:32,130
He's the funniest guy ever on radio.

935
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,100
Jim Norton is my favorite guy
ever of all time on radio.

936
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,210
No question about it.

937
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,980
Consistently comes with the funny,

938
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,080
he's hilarious and he's smart.

939
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,880
He's well thought out.

940
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,271
He's a,

941
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:43,110
he's an interesting,

942
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,101
he's honest.

943
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:45,060
I really love Joey.

944
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,070
I think he's a hilarious comedian too.

945
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,933
He's so fun.

946
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,470
Plus he makes me feel,

947
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:50,790
I don't feel like it's so much of a per,

948
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:51,624
after I hang out with him,

949
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,150
like I thought my act
at too many Dick Jokes.

950
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,100
Then I went to see him and
I even told them that I go,

951
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:56,340
dude,

952
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,670
I had the best time that you freed me
in a lot of ways because sometimes I go,

953
00:26:59,671 --> 00:26:59,851
man,

954
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,870
I got so many Dick Jokes.

955
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:01,920
Why keep writing Dick Jokes?

956
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,860
His whole act was dick
jokes from beginning to end.

957
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,880
And I loved it.

958
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,930
It was awesome.

959
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,380
I saw him at a cobb's Cobb's
comedy club in the Austin,

960
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,190
not cops.

961
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:12,720
Um,

962
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,553
um,

963
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,820
cap city kept city Comedy Club in Austin.

964
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,730
Anthony's starting as a
compound show this week though.

965
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:21,820
So that's going to be interesting because
I don't know how if he has a lawyer,

966
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:22,350
if he said he,

967
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,400
you know he was going to lawyer up if,

968
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,670
but what if he can talk about
and what he can't talk about.

969
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,860
You know it's going to be interesting.

970
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,360
Well I'm pretty sure he could probably
talk about the incident that he could

971
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:33,890
talk about.

972
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,630
No one can keep you from talking
about a person attacking you.

973
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,790
How could they keep you from doing that?

974
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,970
Any person that could keep you from
doing that is not a person want to be

975
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:42,600
associated with it.

976
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,500
They fire you for that.

977
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:44,334
Good.

978
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,760
Imagine someone keeping you from
talking about you being attacked,

979
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,650
like your own personal experience.

980
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,650
How he expresses himself
is entirely up to him.

981
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:58,130
I think we'll probably get a more balanced
view of it now than when it happened.

982
00:27:59,370 --> 00:27:59,701
You know?

983
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:02,870
I think he's probably going to
take into consideration all the,

984
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,480
the heat and the bullshit and the time
that's elapsed and the motions that have

985
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:08,520
relaxed and the tension that's relaxed,

986
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:13,170
the sting of the punches and he'll be
able to look at it and give you a funny

987
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,280
assessment of it.

988
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,770
But the,

989
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,110
the show would just be better
if they go on the Internet.

990
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,480
They can do whatever they
want a hundred times.

991
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:23,100
You don't need anybody anymore.

992
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,540
I can move.

993
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,373
You just don't it.

994
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:25,710
Yeah.

995
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,820
They can move anywhere they want.

996
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,320
You don't need anybody anymore.

997
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,630
It's,

998
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,463
it's silly.

999
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:34,730
It's like the amount of people that
don't have iPods or iPhones or can't get

1000
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:37,200
their phone to stream through their radio.

1001
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,200
It's common almost everybody
now it's really close,

1002
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:40,890
you know?

1003
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:41,191
I mean,

1004
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:42,480
especially if you're commuting,

1005
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:44,160
if you're getting on
subways and shit like that,

1006
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:48,630
and it's actually better than having
some sort of a satellite that sends it to

1007
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:50,580
you and you can get it whenever you want.

1008
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,600
You can pause it.

1009
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:52,890
You can listen whenever you want.

1010
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,660
It's just a better medium,

1011
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,381
you know?

1012
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:56,191
And that don't me wrong.

1013
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:59,520
I have three cars that have
a Sirius satellite radio.

1014
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:00,354
I love it.

1015
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,110
It's great.

1016
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,280
I love the fact that I
could flip through the,

1017
00:29:03,281 --> 00:29:04,800
the shit and listen to new music.

1018
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:05,850
I love that I can,

1019
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:06,330
uh,

1020
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,540
get on the classic Vinyl Station
and listened to all classic rock.

1021
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,740
Cause I'm old as fuck.

1022
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,001
I'm old as fuck.

1023
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:12,834
And I reminisce.

1024
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,340
I listen to some Bob Seger.

1025
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:16,741
I like it.

1026
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:17,521
I like serious.

1027
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:18,540
I'll keep it as a product.

1028
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,321
But man,

1029
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:20,460
you've got to realize what you're selling.

1030
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,950
[inaudible]

1031
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,120
okay.
