1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,230
Yes, sir. Cheers.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,480
Cheers.
And we're live and we're live so much.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,660
Talk about so much to talk about years.
It's been awhile. It's been awhile.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,180
And uh,
one of the reasons why you're here,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,920
it's because I was mostly of Jackson. I
mean, we should just get right into this.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,670
You can't do it or should we
let them at the Budweiser?

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,050
I haven't even eat breakfast. I
didn't eat breakfast. I'm like,

8
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,420
I'm going to drink beer with you.
I already know he's getting me beer.

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,620
And that way it can hit me a lot faster
and I'll loosen up my lips a lot sooner.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,100
We can do whatever you want. It's
up to you. You look in thick dude.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,110
How much do you weigh now, man? So I've
been, um, so here's a crazy story I go to,

12
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:50,880
I go to, um, the Pi to, Cause
Dana tells me I can't go to 55.

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,270
So I go to talk to tell you,
you can't go. Why? Look at,

14
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:58,200
he says I'm getting old and
older and just say, he said old,

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,880
I'm getting old and card, right.
So I said, I'm going to go to the,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,370
to the bi. You guys have this
amazing facility with the pis,

17
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:12,000
towns for a performance institute for
people on the UFC performances too.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,600
And uh, they have trainers and
Dietitian nutrition, right?

19
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:20,601
So I'm going there to meet with them to
get a guideline and some kind of plan

20
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:23,280
that we can attack so I can go
down. I look, I met with your guys,

21
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,610
they said it's okay while on their second
day into all this like crazy testing

22
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:29,521
you do,
right.

23
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:31,860
They have all kinds of tests that
they run where you get on these bikes.

24
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,540
And I mean like, fuck, I was the
Olympic training center testing.

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,650
Um, uh, I wanted to say
Joe Silva walked in,

26
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:44,340
but then that's not right because he's
not there anymore. So, uh, Maynard, no,

27
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,170
Sean Shelby comes in and says, [inaudible]
my prayer really wants to fight you.

28
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,470
You want to take this fight? And I was at,
uh, well, I thought it was going to 55.

29
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:55,440
And he said, yeah, he called you out and
really wants to fight you. And I was like,

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,590
well, fuck. Okay. I'll finance. Sure.
Done. That's fine. But next door,

31
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,550
can I go to Vinny via, you know, like God
damn. So how does Perry thing I'll start.

32
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:08,460
It was, um, Felder's
opponent got hurt. Um,

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,470
I called the fight gay. She goes,
because Vic got hurt. So I was like,

34
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:18,300
I'll go to 55 by [inaudible].
Um, crazy shit just happened.

35
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:21,630
And then the parry fight, they offered
me and I called Perry, said, hey man,

36
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,990
I know we're trying together, but this is
10 days notice. Let's do this. He's like,

37
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:28,200
fuck him. That'd be great. Let's do
this. So that's how that started.

38
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,720
And then I didn't get the fight.
That was the end of it for me.

39
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,420
I wanted to use to go back to one to 55
and then all of a sudden he's calling me

40
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,670
out and fell the winds of fighting.
Perry,

41
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,490
you were going to fight barrier where
you were at least thinking about it?

42
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,530
I was like in the mix.
Right. But I couldn't,

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,500
I didn't get cleared
because I had stitches.

44
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:48,490
Could I just fought a what? I
don't know 10 days before. So, um,

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,460
plus I was in the hospital
having my new son,

46
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:54,570
so it was kind of a weird time for
everything, but I was wild, wild,

47
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:57,930
wild shit and out now and now I'm fighting
Perry. You November 10th, then Denver.

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,060
Well,
what was,

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
what was gonna happen was Jackson and
Winkeljohn we're supposed to be here

50
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:10,060
today, right? Well you had,

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,340
I mean you've been with
them for how long man?

52
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,960
I want to say
before my WC days.

53
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,730
So I went on the more than 10
years. Yeah, easily. Yeah, easily.

54
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:25,710
More than 10 years.
I,

55
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:30,700
I don't think there's another athlete
there that's been the longer besides Diego

56
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,770
Sanchez who's been there
since the beginning,

57
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:37,570
but he left for a little while for
the while came back. Um, so me,

58
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:41,260
you know Holly, but she was
with wink before he merged. So,

59
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:45,040
but like with actually Jackson Jackson
and I'm like, they're like the one,

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,690
you know, everyone else kind of
either left the jam or retired.

61
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,170
So what the fuck happened?

62
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,470
Like how did they decide that they were
going to corner my Perry? Who by the way,

63
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:00,670
I like a lot. And I have nothing against
to say pair either. I don't this, this,

64
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,090
this has nothing to do with it. With Perry
has a fun dude. I like that guy a lot.

65
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,220
No problem with him on the boat.

66
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,370
Took them shooting with me and when he
was down there part or part of the action,

67
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,700
you know a Frank Lester who's helping him
with his pads, friend of mine, you know,

68
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:16,750
so he comes out shooting with me.
We go out in the boat and have fun and um,

69
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,160
so this has nothing to do with them.

70
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:23,161
I just asked when I went to go to 55 and
then Perry called me out and wants to

71
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:27,700
fight. Sure, no problem. But I went
to talk to Greg and we can say, Hey,

72
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,410
this guy is brand new to the gym,
right? He's only been here one camp,

73
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,980
couple of months.
I said,

74
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:37,120
I don't think that it's okay for
him to come in and call me out.

75
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:40,210
Like that's not, not not
right. So if he is doing that,

76
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,450
I don't think we should allow him to,
to train here for this fight.

77
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,720
If fucking Winkeljohn
tells me, yeah, you know,

78
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,910
I thought you called him out and Oh,

79
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,220
this is a shit ass and lies like to
your face. So to me he was like, yeah,

80
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:58,090
sure, no problem. I'll clear it up
and we won't have any issues. Um,

81
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,940
and then the next day he calls me on
the phone and says, you know what?

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,280
I thought about it.

83
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,630
If we don't have periods and I don't
get paid and I need to get paid for this

84
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:11,480
fight, and uh, uh, cause you just pay
Greg, I don't make any money to the gym,

85
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:12,430
so we're just gonna go with him.

86
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:15,300
And then basically tells me I'm
no longer welcome in the gym.

87
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,110
And he said the team had a meeting,
bullshit. The team didn't have a meeting.

88
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,150
I talked to everybody that there
was no meeting, there's no habit.

89
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:27,160
So to me it's like the loyalty of
week taking over this gym is just,

90
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,470
it's just shit, man. It turned
into like a puppy mill. It's all,

91
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:34,180
it's all about money now and not the old
Jackson. When, when I used to work out,

92
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:37,420
we're just getting into this I guess.
Huh? Alright. Start chugging, search,

93
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,254
hug and shit.

94
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,580
Back when I first moved down
here and I went to Greg's,

95
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,930
when the tap out guys picked me up
and introduced me and all that. Right.

96
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,300
But when you're on the tap
out show, I remember, Oh yeah.

97
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,210
That a reality show that will
mask called Greg and gotten me.

98
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,630
That's how I got involved
with them. Right. I,

99
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,720
I left Linda Garcia was fighting
Roger Ward two were my best friends,

100
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,780
Roger would call it. That was by damn
right. Mother fucking Mexican. God Damn,

101
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,160
I forgot about that fight.
Go to fight pass to bring that up.

102
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,470
Um, are still wild is due
to other men. So do I man.

103
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,660
And um, so he calls me like, come on,
I need you to come down for a week.

104
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:25,580
Come for one week.
Helped me get ready for Roger.

105
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,680
He took the fight on my three
weeks notice something outlandish.

106
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,300
You just like me and Leonard
Do. Right. So I go down there.

107
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,270
I literally never left.
When I went down,

108
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,510
first day I walked in
the Jacksons in Rashad,

109
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,790
Keith Saint-pierre, Joe
Daddy's Stevenson. Uh,

110
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,880
I mean the list goes on and on
and on. And I was like, wow,

111
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:50,480
this is what a real gym is like. This
is what, and they all accepted me.

112
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:52,940
It was like a duck. I was like
in the family, right? I call,

113
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,030
I owned a house in Denver. I called my
grandma. I said, I'm never coming home.

114
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,290
I'm staying here, sell the house.
Right. And I literally never went home.

115
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:04,130
She would just slowly come down to visit
me and bring me truckloads of shit.

116
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,870
Right? Literally, I
lived in a closet, man,

117
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,510
fuck it. A third as big as this room,
we had a bunk bed, me and Leonard and a,

118
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,790
if one person who was standing up,
the other person had to be in the bed.

119
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,210
That's how small this room was. Wow.
And I lived there for two years above,

120
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:24,020
above Jackson's. And we train every day
with him. And like I said, I never left.

121
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,190
And Greg asked me, he sat me
down after about, I don't know,

122
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,080
a couple of weeks of being there. He
said, man, I want you to be my 50 fiver.

123
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,350
And at that time he had the list of 55
hours were nuts that he had and I was

124
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,860
like, wow, fuck Greg Jackson,

125
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,460
who at the time was the man man,

126
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:44,450
right that the gym was
kind of 90% winning. Great.

127
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:48,890
And he just, he's such a
knowledgeable, awesome dude man.

128
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:53,660
And to see where the gym was
to where the gym is now is,

129
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,220
it's like heartbreaking
to me to be honest. And I,

130
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,980
and you want to talk about loyalty,

131
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:00,710
which is the biggest thing
in this conversation that
we're having right now is

132
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,000
how they pick someone over me
through being loyal. I stuck by Greg.

133
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,320
Even when the gym started going down,
when Winkeljohn merged over,

134
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,790
all of the big pros left. It turned
into like a puppy mill. You know,

135
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:17,930
it wasn't for, for back when Greg
had it and it was its own school.

136
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,830
You couldn't turn up to a pro class.
Like,

137
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,370
like some guy couldn't just come
here and knock on your door.

138
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,030
Like you say you get Weirdos hero time.

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,490
Next thing you know he has shin pads
on and sparring, there's litter,

140
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:29,810
be at the new gym,
bumps come in off the street,

141
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
I swear to God and we'll fight these and
we'll come in and put stuff on a fight.

142
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,580
That's a true story.
Random bums off the street and uh,

143
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,270
that would never happen back in the
day. So Greg doesn't run it anymore? No,

144
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,171
he has.
He's like,

145
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:45,700
so out of the loop Winkle John runs
the entire thing and that's what,

146
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:48,830
what is Greg doing? He kind of stepped
back for a couple of years, man.

147
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:53,390
Like kind of started doing other things
and just kind of got burned out I guess,

148
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,730
which is why I created the BMF ranch.

149
00:08:56,731 --> 00:09:00,020
I needed somewhere to go and
something to do. So I created my list,

150
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,720
which is wings argument with me right
now saying you built your own place,

151
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,910
you don't ever come here bubba. I
said, why don't I ever come here?

152
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:10,260
Because usually the people you let
in here is outlandish. Like anybody,

153
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,880
you pay $150 you can get on the
masters and spar with Holly Holmes.

154
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:17,040
You know what I mean? That's,
that's what it's come to down there.

155
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,580
And back in the day it was like
private and just us and good pros.

156
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:23,850
Everyone there for the same mission,
trying to, trying to get better, you know?

157
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,320
But I've talked to some
other people that are,

158
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:27,720
I don't want to name sure they've
said that when they go down,

159
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:31,770
their new guys will come in and is
literally a fight is a fight. It's a,

160
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:36,090
there's no, there's no, there's
no a, B, c class anymore.

161
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,780
It's like literally these guys come in,
they want to make a name on it.

162
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:41,580
He was sometimes when you're
towards the end of a fight camp,

163
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,060
you don't need those new guy. You don't
need that crazy sparring. Right. Right.

164
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:49,140
You need, you need the guys you trust and
not some random guy, I don't know. Right.

165
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,850
So it's just, it's Asinine
me, man. What, what?

166
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:55,210
They turn that place into that.

167
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,660
That still happens and I'm a man because
you're never going to find that in

168
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:00,460
boxing. And boxing. All
sparring is control, control,

169
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:03,750
bringing the sparring partners,
you know who you're working with.

170
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,780
So I mean we've talked
loyalty again to me with Greg,

171
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,230
his name is on that building. It's
not, it's Wink Jackson wink, right?

172
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,000
Jackson fucking wink your names first.
Even when it came time to,

173
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,390
to pick a decision and they said,
we want to go with Perry.

174
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,830
Why the fuck didn't you stand? Because
Greg still with me. He's like, yeah,

175
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:28,410
I'll just come to the ranch and
we'll sort this out. And I'm like,

176
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,940
what the fuck are you talking about?

177
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,610
You tell me I can't come
into the Jackson wink gym,

178
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,370
but you're going to backdoor and come
to my fucking house and we're going to

179
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:38,190
train to fight me while
Perry's there at the gym.

180
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,790
You see everything he does and then
you're going to come and you're going to

181
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,540
train me. Not to mention you're holding
classes there and he's watching me.

182
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,100
You might not be training him to beat me,

183
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:50,760
but there's a lot of people there that
have trained with me for fucking years.

184
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,760
So, to me, that was the
point. I was saying like, man,

185
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,250
can we just not have him
there for this camp? I mean,

186
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:01,110
there's a lot of secrets that I, that
like inner secrets that I have, like, Yo,

187
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm, I'm fucking scared to death to
fight. Like that's not to say he can,

188
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,160
they can tell him like, or they tell them,
you know, go get cowboy mad. You know,

189
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,920
he doesn't fight well when he's
pissed off. So fucking pissed him off,

190
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,590
poke out and poked the bear, piss
him off, get him out of his element,

191
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,920
give him the, you know, the
shit like this. Right. So,

192
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,780
and there's a lot of other things,
small,

193
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,590
dumb things that I do and tendencies
I've seen over over the year or 10. Yeah.

194
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,640
Right. Um, to me that's,
it's very intimate.

195
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,260
The relationship between a coach and
a fighter is, is very, very intense.

196
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,860
So for someone to violate that
in that way, and, you know,

197
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,980
I don't think there's anything wrong
with guys from a camp deciding to fight

198
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,690
each other and you've
got to work that out.

199
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:42,830
But for them to tell you
that you can't Carlos Condit,

200
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,970
I agree with you that we'll figure it out.
Right? Call us. You go that way. We'll,

201
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,070
right. These are your times. Your
hours affect each other. Right.

202
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:54,100
Friends trading partners who just came in,

203
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,790
I said I got nothing against Perry. He's,
he's looking for, he wants a home, right?

204
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:01,720
He's looking, he felt like Jackson does.
He's great. I like that. Go Up to him.

205
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,870
I mean, what is he going to do?
Right. And, and I just said, hey,

206
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,360
frank was going to go and train
with him wherever I heard stories.

207
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:13,660
He was looking to go to Vegas anyway.
I don't have any idea, man. I was just,

208
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,150
I was just like, man, can we
just not do it for this fight?

209
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:18,220
And then Winkeljohn
called me on the phone,

210
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:21,400
didn't you have the fucking balls or the
backbone to say it to my fucking face?

211
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:25,930
And I was right there with them,
called him on the phone. Like, Oh yeah,

212
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,860
we're actually going
to, oh, go with Perry.

213
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,700
You know he pays money. That's again,
it comes back to the money. I'm like,

214
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,830
so Perry pays him a percentage and you
don't pay Greg for my entire career I've

215
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:42,670
ever been there because I don't like
Winkeljohn style and like his way he holds

216
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:45,490
meds. I don't like the way he trains
people different about what he does.

217
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,740
It's the same thing for rep, for you. For
me, for John Sam, they're all the exalted.

218
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:55,540
It's the cookie cutter.
Everything's exactly the same
and it never changes. It's,

219
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,160
I don't understand how you can be a coach
of the one of the greatest at one time,

220
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:03,850
the greatest Jim's on the planet, you
know, and then don't ever revolve,

221
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:08,140
don't ever change and don't
run class and it, to me it's,

222
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,480
he just drove that place
into the ground, man. Turn,

223
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,790
literally turn it into a puppy mill.

224
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,990
It's only about making money
and for you guys at all,

225
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:18,340
I'm talking about a pug mill when someone
has a dog and they just fucking breed

226
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:20,800
it and sell puppies and breed it and
sell the puppies that that's what's

227
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:25,150
happening. The infrastructure of this
gym. Now let's talk about training there.

228
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,530
Let's talk about coaching,
right? Greg's supposed to be
the, the, the general right.

229
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm just a soldier. How come I have
to be now a general anesthesia?

230
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,030
It's fucking up in my,
in my career. I can't,

231
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,970
I need somebody to tell me what to do.
Tell me what not to do.

232
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,800
And I had to start my own school at
the ranch, bringing my own coaches.

233
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:48,130
But then now I'm making all the
executive decisions when we're training,

234
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:52,600
what we're training, what we're doing.
And I'm not, I'm no longer just a soldier.

235
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:57,020
I'm having to fucking run
this whole thing. Um, that's
not mapping for fighters.

236
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:58,780
The problem for me too,
I liked it.

237
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,500
I'm a fucking super alpha male and I like
to communicate with my coaches and get

238
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:05,150
everything done in the guys that have a
fucking stand and by me and I love him

239
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:08,920
to death, but I need someone to be like,
you know what? You crazy fucking bastard.

240
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,580
You're going too hard going to do office
taper off. It's pumped. The brakes. Oh,

241
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:16,120
let's pick it up. Right.
The fucking fun fuck off.

242
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,070
Part of your life is taking
over into your training.

243
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:20,890
Can we step it up a little bit?
Right. I need that. I need,

244
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,870
I need fucking direction.
I need today we're working on this,

245
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:25,070
not just me going in there saying,
ah,

246
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,780
let's fucking wrestling
today. Right? So, um,

247
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,710
you know what to do, but it's also nice
for someone else who knows what to do,

248
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:38,780
who's completely objective is. Then
on the outside, because there's been,

249
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,410
I'm in this so long,
there's bright,

250
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:45,340
like I could literally Joe never spar
from now til the Perry fight and probably

251
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:49,420
not even do one Jujitsu role. And I
would be okay to fight like mentally,

252
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,380
but that's probably not a fair idea.
Right? Like you at your optimum.

253
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:57,560
Exactly. Um, so it's just,

254
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:00,170
it's fucking Asinine to me
and the coaches down there.

255
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:03,560
So not only can somebody just ring
the doorbell and show up and train,

256
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,190
pay the money. You pay the $25 a
drop in, or you paid 159 a month.

257
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,110
Come to any class you want. But if you're
a coach, you can just coach the class.

258
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,350
It's that.
It's that Asinine.

259
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:18,470
Do I see a new striking
coach or new wrestling coach
or new Jujitsu guy in there

260
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,590
twice a week probably,
and they're coaching the class.

261
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,890
Our rest main wrestling
coach of Jackson wink,

262
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:29,891
the greatest school in the fucking
world is a reception to a chiropractic

263
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,980
upstairs.
He's great as credentials.

264
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:37,490
Whereas he was a junior
assistant coach at a college,

265
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,060
don't know the college name, who got
fired for selling the kid steroids.

266
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,410
That's our wrestling coach.

267
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,500
I had one of the greatest schools in
the world is a good coach and it was

268
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:47,360
terrible. He's fucking
God awful, terrible.

269
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,270
He watches videos on Youtube and tries
to teach people things that don't even

270
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,390
fucking work.
It's Asinine,

271
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,150
which is another thing that I had to
hire my own coach and bring them in.

272
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,400
You know, it's like, it's like, Whoa,
wait, what? And now they don't even drill.

273
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:04,070
They just go live and they want to
know why people get hurt every day.

274
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,830
It's like you can't just go in and
say, okay, and we're wrestling go.

275
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,270
So do you think that people just get burnt
out on doing things the right way and

276
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,950
they just, they just figure, look,

277
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,770
I'm just going to do this the way that
makes the most money? Well, I think,

278
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,180
and I wish I had,
I had the answer for that.

279
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,570
I do because I'm not in that position to,
I'm not running a gym and that's,

280
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:24,980
I've never done that
because I don't want it.

281
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,650
Me showing up to class every single
day would wear me the fuck out.

282
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,280
Where's everybody?
Everybody's got to.

283
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,380
But you should have an infrastructure
set in place that takes, especially if

284
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,220
you're the greatest at one
time, right? If you're winning,

285
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:41,630
percentages are in the eighties and
nineties and now they're in the 20s like I

286
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:44,840
don't, I have no clue what our, what our
rating record of the gym is. But it's,

287
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,610
it's nothing like it used to
be. Right. And it's fucking,

288
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,700
it's Asinine to me the way you were doing
as a, you have the BMF ranch, right?

289
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:55,580
To have everything set up.

290
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,490
You bring in all your sparring partners
and you would be doing all your training

291
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:00,340
out there.
And how would Greg interact?

292
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,340
We do their show up down at
Jackson's and spar cause they sell,

293
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,850
they're still bodies down there.
Right.

294
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,240
There's still guys would
show up now as far.

295
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,120
We'd bring all the guys in or
Greg would come up, you know,

296
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:11,870
three or four times a week to the ranch
and we do as far as your ranch from 50

297
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:13,790
miles bell. Okay. Good Hour.

298
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:18,620
A solid hour drive into the
vast Nolan's of New Mexico.

299
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,000
Do you like living out there? I do.
I love it. I was fucking love it.

300
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,840
So I sold my house. I moved
here, I fucking planted roots.

301
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,550
Now I could never ever sell my place.
I'm stuck in New Mexico.

302
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,110
I'm moving back to Colorado.
I'm a buyer.

303
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,720
You never saw it because I have to
sell it to like a crazy cold leaders.

304
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,750
If anybody out there listening
also operate a cold right
now I have the perfect

305
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,180
alchemy about, we've
got 40 acres, 40 acres,

306
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,580
plenty of rooms, buildings,
animals in your vicinity.

307
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,420
Um, oh yeah. This might be
where we start. There's,

308
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,250
there's about an hour driving and
running some elk antelope, um,

309
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,800
everywhere.
Which is crazy thing about analog.

310
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:04,920
Did you know they don't jump fences,
they won't jump fences, right?

311
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:07,890
You can just literally cornered
him into a, into a, into a nail.

312
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:11,190
Occasionally jump a fence. They've been
known to jump a fence occasionally.

313
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:15,990
It was very, very rare. You know,
they evolved before the ice age.

314
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,410
They evolve to get away from
Cheetahs. Howard, you're so smart.

315
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:21,780
That's what I want to know. I'm
not smart. I just remember, dude,

316
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:24,770
it's fucking insane. There was a, a,

317
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,600
a mass extinction of a giant land mammals.

318
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,800
It's somewhere around 12,000 years ago
in North America and before then there

319
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:34,320
was cheetahs.
There was actual North American cheetahs.

320
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,290
There was a north of back in lion
that's bigger than the African lion.

321
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,753
How about that shit.

322
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,870
Giant ass fucking line and that's
where these fucking things did you want

323
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,040
another chu?
I saw it last time

324
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,400
I brought me Kevin, if you got Rogan
to fucking take a chill, just take it.

325
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:57,930
I swallowed it. I didn't know what
I was doing like a man. All right.

326
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:59,540
Round two.
Here we go to,

327
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,360
it's a wintergreen
Copenhagen under your chin.

328
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,660
Under your lip change if you want
it take just a little one too.

329
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,940
They
take a big hub or liver.

330
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:28,110
So there's that. Um, there's
turkeys out there. Target,

331
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,460
right? I love Turkey. I'm a
bird hunting fanatic man. Man.

332
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,030
I love birds. How many acres you
got? 40 acres. Oh Wow. It's nice.

333
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,610
40 acres and mule

334
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,670
but bird's eye look a bird junkie.
How'd you find that spot?

335
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,370
Um, so when I moved out
there and after I was in, um,

336
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,370
the gym for like a year and a
half of Leonard, I was like, Bro,

337
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,280
you're like winning a bunch of UFC fights.
Now I'm in the WC.

338
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,340
Uh, we're starting to get a little bit of
money. Let's get a house together, right?

339
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:03,510
Let's find a house.

340
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,430
So I started looking kind of in the
remote areas around where I knew I could

341
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:11,220
commute in, but I wanted somewhere I
could ride my dirt bike, shoot guns,

342
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,900
just be cowboy. And, um,

343
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:18,450
we found that place and I call
my grandpa and I said, hey,

344
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,660
I think I found a house. And
he said, I'll be right there.

345
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,120
And he and my grandma drove and he
walked to the lady and he handed her an

346
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:30,030
envelope full of cash and he said,
well take it

347
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,880
just like that. Wow. Yeah.

348
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,050
It was probably 60 or 70,000 less than
they're asking, but he had real cash,

349
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,990
real cash and said,
we'll take it.

350
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,650
One grandson wants it and um,
we'll take it.

351
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,720
Wow. And I was like, oh, I
was just showing like, okay,

352
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,900
uh, thanks grandma. Right.

353
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:59,880
Like we just bought me a house and um,
he liked,

354
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:02,350
believes in me no matter what I
did. I used to be on, on magician.

355
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,030
I used to like love my magic,
right.

356
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:07,120
So He'd always behind me magic shit
and sit there and watch me do it.

357
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:10,690
And he was such a fucking cool
dude, man. He used to do magic.

358
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,830
[inaudible] did you ever do shows?
No, no, no. I mean I was like 12, 13.

359
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,440
I would do shows to my grandma,
Grandpa,

360
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:20,710
and my friends and I still have
like a toolbox full of magic stuff.

361
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:24,330
I should busted out and bring it out here
one time. And there's some cool, yeah,

362
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,830
I'm not like good, like
you wouldn't be like, Whoa,

363
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,130
Doug blue one. But there's some, some of
that slide of hand stuff. It's pretty fun.

364
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:35,080
And like the coin coin magic is good.

365
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:38,320
And how do you keep the shift from
going in your mouth? You just,

366
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,610
cause it doesn't for me,

367
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:42,100
it doesn't seem to want to stay put
where you keep drinking on top of it.

368
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,290
You've got to like very with
your tongue and then go over it.

369
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,650
Try fucking love it. So yeah. Um,

370
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,800
greatest dudes, man taught
me a lot, taught me a lot
about loyalty, respect man.

371
00:21:57,801 --> 00:22:02,140
And, and I called my grandma on
my way here today and I said,

372
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,900
I'm going to fucking set fire
to this bridge to Jackson's.

373
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,730
And she wrote me back and said,
what you need to like,

374
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,100
are you attacking them logically
or are you out of anger? Which,

375
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:19,240
which direction are we going here?
Powerful grandma right on the ball.

376
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,780
What's direction? How
are we going? And uh,

377
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,830
she said and start bidding
soon, Huh? Yeah, you definitely
got to spit. She said,

378
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:33,370
make sure you know always in life,

379
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:34,870
don't ever paint yourself into a corner.

380
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:37,150
Like these are major lessons you
always do and we don't burn bridges.

381
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:37,984
You can't cross.

382
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,810
But she told me today fucking and
let it go. Let them have it. They,

383
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,840
they, they want to step across the
line. They drew the line in the sand,

384
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,480
let them want to burn their own,
make them just feel so bad.

385
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:52,870
They want to burn their own fucking gym
to the route. And you know, it's like,

386
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,670
to me having the moment for Greg
to say, you know what, wink,

387
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,940
my name's on this fucking Jim Cowboy
has been with me from the star.

388
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,410
There's been times two or three camps
ago where I've trained Greg maybe one or

389
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:07,690
two times and I still write him a check.

390
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,910
I still write them a check and I
pay him because he got me into this

391
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:17,260
motherfucker and loyalty to me. Is that
the top, top of the line thing, right?

392
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,750
It's top of the line to me too.
That's why you're here. Right?

393
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,840
That's why they're not.
And you know,

394
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:26,080
and it's unfortunate because I would like
Greg a lot and I, and I was like, great.

395
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,900
I don't know much about Winkeljohn
other than his work. Right.

396
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:31,950
What does on with Holly and
a lot of other people and uh,

397
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,980
I was really torn up about this. That's
why I contacted you. Sure, sure. You know,

398
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,900
when you told me this is like a crazy
scenario all around for everybody across

399
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:43,720
the board, like, wait, what do you
like? What, what the fuck you mean,

400
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,370
what's happening here? You know, and

401
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,010
it's, it's, it's crazy. It's wild. I
appreciate you sticking by my side.

402
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,410
It was a, it was a situation where I
didn't know what to do. Yeah. You know?

403
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,600
I was like,
I can't just ignore it.

404
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,260
I would have to bring it up when they
were here and then I wouldn't get a full

405
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:08,200
representation of it. Sure. I mean, do
you feel like you had a full revenue,

406
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,630
you got to figure out how to
do this right? It's a skill.

407
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,600
You learn how to Tuck it in your,
yeah, that's all over the place.

408
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:21,860
It's in my mouth. My was in a little ball
right here. I don't know. Mine is not,

409
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,640
uh, is not controlled. I'm going
to wind up swollen this again.

410
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:27,230
So if your name's on the,
on the thing,

411
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:30,770
like right now you go
to put a spit it out.

412
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,030
Now you've got to open another beer and
wrench it and you got to give it a ranch.

413
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,660
I said Reggie, I opened bare
rent it out. Spit it out.

414
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:44,420
That way you don't get any more
swollen though. You're not sick again.

415
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,170
I wasn't sick last time. It was fine. It
was weird. I swallowed the whole thing.

416
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,740
Um, fuck yeah, I missed you man.

417
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,210
I missed Ya. It's been a
while. So much has happened.

418
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,950
I'm glad we got that kind of out of
the way. I'm sure I'll circle back on.

419
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:03,800
I drink a little bit more.
I'm sure it's too, it's um,

420
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,760
it's unfortunate and I know what it must
be like to try to keep the lights on in

421
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:11,750
a big gym and now they have dorms. It's
huge. Giant ass place. Huge overhead.

422
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:14,600
I'm sure all of these people
coming in, coming out, and then,

423
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:17,060
you know how fighters are not you,
but some fighters,

424
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:19,820
they don't give a fuck about loyalty.
They just care about themselves.

425
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:20,960
They're on their path.
It's a,

426
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:24,590
it's a very solitary single shelf
that you're very selfish sport.

427
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,780
You kind of have to be right.
Yeah.

428
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,380
And I think that's Kinda where
the team got was very selfish.

429
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:33,680
He has his own gym now. I
had to fucking hat too, man,

430
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:38,180
for the better of my family and me.
I had to keep evolving.

431
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:41,780
I couldn't spiral down this drain
with you guys. Right. You know,

432
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:43,670
now Michelle Waterson
just build a new gym.

433
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:46,850
She's doing the same thing in her
backyard. Love her to death, you know,

434
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,520
not doing it to her. And her husband
built a badass little jam. Oh Wow.

435
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,050
All sponsored by on it. Fucking
really bitching man. It's
cool. Yeah. Good for her.

436
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:59,920
Good. Yeah. Michelle Wu. Um, you know,
but if you look at the track records,

437
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:03,380
since [inaudible] has taken over
the gym, everyone's left. I mean,

438
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,470
it's like you don't see a
pattern here, wink. Like,

439
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:09,270
maybe you should change
something up or just not allow,

440
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:11,810
he's been fighting for a long time.

441
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,930
Shannon training for a long time.
I mean,

442
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:19,180
he was a bad ass kickboxer before he
ever got into training. And you know,

443
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,090
I think one of the things that happens
with people, they just get this holes,

444
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,990
selfishness of the sport.
It wears people down to a certain extent.

445
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,040
There's comradery,

446
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,730
but there's also selfishness and they're
all constantly going against each other.

447
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:36,590
Sure. And you know, having a gym like
that, the expenses, the overhead,

448
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,130
and then, you know, dealing
with people that are just
grabbing, grabbing, grabbing.

449
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:44,070
It's just, it's got to get overwhelming.
And you see a guy like Mike who, you

450
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,690
know is a potential big star. He's a
colorful kid. He's a knockout artist.

451
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,560
He fucking loves to fight. If
I was a coach, I'd be like,

452
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,790
this is the kind of guy I want in my gym.
He's a fucking animal. You know, it's, uh,

453
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,880
it's a show.

454
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:03,330
We're excited to fight him because this
is the one of those fights where we're

455
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,210
going to go in the middle of
the ring and we're going to,

456
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,060
we're going to fucking fight the old
school. Fucking yeah, let's fight.

457
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,190
So I'm fucking, I'm pumped on it. I
love the kid, you know, he's cool.

458
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:19,040
He's crazy. Him and I would get
along. Just going to do so. Uh,

459
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,870
I got nothing. Like I said, nothing
the ham or Frank Frank is Koetsu.

460
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,750
Well that's Perry's working with,
with frank,

461
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,670
the on striking coach who Frank Lester
Lester who was holding, holding the,

462
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,770
the infrastructure of the gym together.
Almost single handedly.

463
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:35,011
You know,

464
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:39,560
there's a couple of wrestling guys and
I'm his Brandon Gibson still random.

465
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,130
Brennan had a full time job. He just got
promoted again in his government job.

466
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:48,300
He was like a real government
job. Job, job, job on top
of being a super chocolate.

467
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:53,250
Yeah. How the fuck they do
that man, I have no idea.

468
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,090
He has like a nine to nine to six job,
maybe,

469
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:58,350
maybe seven to six job.

470
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,490
Really these every morning up early take
care of his family. He's a great dude.

471
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:05,250
I got nothing bad, nothing
but love for branding. Gibson,
man, nothing that really,

472
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,920
him and I just separated
only because I need to,

473
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,010
I just want a different angle of striking.
It wasn't,

474
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:14,370
it would mean we had nothing to do
with, he's a bad coach. I lost my fight.

475
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:18,390
I'm firing you. It's just fucking
just trying something new,

476
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,370
trying something new, that's all.
Uh, but yes, gives it to them,

477
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:25,350
but with Gibbs and kind of just
works, you know, with John Dodson,

478
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,180
with condit Kinda,
I mean,

479
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:31,470
he doesn't have the time to go in there
and just hold that gym together. So he,

480
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:34,440
um, he has a real job and he
just got another promotion.

481
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:37,410
So he's like the top of the,
he started off as a lifeguard,

482
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,560
worked his way all live in the city.
Now he's damn near governor.

483
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,000
I think that's next governor
is next for getting that hard.

484
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:48,830
I had Gary Johnson in here. I think
I can be governor of New Mexico. No,

485
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,730
no offense, Gary. Well, let's legalize
pot and a mushroom. Is it not legal there?

486
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,950
It's, it's recreation or I mean
it's um, medical diamonds. Yeah.

487
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,293
One of those places.

488
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,720
This is a lot of places
we got of AIDS like that.

489
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,610
That's how it used to be a lot of places.

490
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,840
But like Vegas used to be like that and
now big, this is Lucy goose open wide.

491
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,310
Vegas got full on dispensary's
man fucking Vegas Man.

492
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:18,270
Vegas is definitely a two night town
man. Yeah, it's rough on the liver.

493
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,540
It's rough on everything. It just takes
you, it takes you the fuck in man. Yeah.

494
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,730
I was just there last night.

495
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:26,480
I was out there for a big monster
conference and it's just like you,

496
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,930
you sit in your room,
you're like,

497
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:32,490
well I could just go down
and a gamble I guess.

498
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:35,370
And then you start gambling. Have you
ever played backer rod? I don't put shit.

499
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,720
I have never either. And I decided, we
tried backer rod like double oh seven.

500
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:42,190
I was like, we'll be like double o
seven. We'll go in there. I played with,

501
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,220
with one of the higher ups in monster
and he took us down and we played this

502
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:49,270
game and uh, fuck, we
want a shit load of money.

503
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,730
A shitload of money. There was like five
trek. Yeah. Yeah. I'll take some of that.

504
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:57,550
I'm really smoke much pot,
but I know just talking with you,

505
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,410
that stuff was that they grew up out
on the moon. I saw a video of him,

506
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,680
breakdancing, it, any breakdowns.
What I do, I used to, I
used to really break down.

507
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,380
So I had the Mazda conference.
We lose a Blackstone.

508
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:12,820
I met the monster conference and um,
monster now has a break dancing team.

509
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,160
Yes. Monster got me some bags.
Bags, man. A good dude, man.

510
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:19,950
He's a great dude. Yeah.
He uh, he takes care of,

511
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,370
he takes care a lot of people and the
infrastructure of monster. Great. Right.

512
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,900
Great instructor. Monster. Yeah. So
the ambassador Hauns takes care of it.

513
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:33,250
Take care of people. Right. So, uh,
I seen the are going to tell you,

514
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:37,210
I seen the moms, your babies laying
back there fucking, I just got them. Um,

515
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,280
Gustin Bolanos it was his idea. So the
more that you're gonna get crazy. Okay,

516
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:47,200
let's start talking about space soon.
Doing drugs.

517
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:51,340
A Joe, it's not nature
nature, man. I'm with Ya.

518
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,970
Um,
so the break dancers,

519
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,760
they start break dancing and then
halfway through their show they stop it.

520
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:03,460
Oh yeah. So they set up a battle
between me and this other guy. Right.

521
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,800
And he's had to go out here
and we have to break dance.

522
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,200
I used to break dance back in years ago,

523
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,730
but on a slippery floor with cowboy
boots and I did that properly stretch.

524
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,350
Yeah. That's good. Oh, so fun man. I

525
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,980
it boots Mazda shirt getting down, doing
a little breakdowns and it was so fun,

526
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:28,720
man.
Dude,

527
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:33,000
we have a bunch of guys from 10th planet
that started out as breakdancing. Uh,

528
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,210
Geo Martinez,

529
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,860
one handed push up with your foe,

530
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,740
one handed hand stand with your feet
up in the end, twist them around.

531
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,030
That's crazy control of your body.
It was, it's like yoga on steroids.

532
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,110
It's so hard.
It's so hard as it's even harder to do.

533
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:56,130
After 12 years of never even doing it
again and go with cowboy boots all go.

534
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,050
Here we go.
We had a bus of these guys come in and uh,

535
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,130
Eddie called me up and he gets crazy.
He goes by dancing like dancing.

536
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,300
Dancing is to think. It's the thing.
These guys are so fucking strong,

537
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:12,250
I can even control them.
Break Dancers, man.

538
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,350
These guys are like 140
pounds and they're like,

539
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:18,320
it's like holding onto a
live wire. Yeah, there's,

540
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,310
they're so strong.
And what does that guy's name?

541
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,910
Bboy pocket Kim is that his name is,
what is his name?

542
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,500
I put him on my Instagram way back in
the day. This is Korean kid. That is,

543
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,290
it doesn't even seem like a
human can do what he does.

544
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,870
That's how I felt yesterday when this
has been dancing. I was like, Hey,

545
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:39,190
spins all on one hand he's on one hand
hopping up and down in the air and spin

546
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:44,180
it around and you're like, pocket
Kim. Yeah. Watch this motherfucker.

547
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,970
This guy is such a beast.
It's crazy to walk.

548
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,080
There's a bunch of these guys now they're
con there's, there's a stance elements.

549
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,030
Yeah. What could this motherfucker
look at? This mother fucker.

550
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,520
I mean what the fuck is he doing?
It's called air tracks. Right?

551
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,240
Is Quick on air tracks and
he's laying right there.
That's that. It's crazy. Yeah.

552
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:08,241
It's like flaring in the air that
that is damn near impossible to do.

553
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,240
That guy is three cause
their trick of all freaks.

554
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,350
It's crazy what he could do and
there's a few of those guys.

555
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:18,350
If you go to that stance elements,
click on that stance elements. Jamie,

556
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,170
the these guys are,
there's,

557
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,010
I didn't know about this until a
Tim Ferriss put it on his Instagram.

558
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,880
He put pocket Kim on and then
I went and watched these guys.

559
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,010
These guys are doing just insane
physical acrobatics along with music,

560
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:38,720
but I feel like the kids now are doing
insane. Everything. Snowboarding, dirt,

561
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:43,670
biking Jitsu, everything. Everything is
on a whole nother level playing field,

562
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:46,820
right? Yeah. They're dead. MMA fighters.
These young guys that are coming in are,

563
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:51,340
are not just solely one one discipline.
Right. They have everything there.

564
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,400
MMA fighters.

565
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,970
You're seeing these new gut like Zup
beat is one of my favorite guys to watch

566
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:01,080
Zombie Magomed Sharapov say
that five times he's he,

567
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,300
he, it's like these new high level guys
are coming in and you look at it and be

568
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:07,760
like, oh, okay. We just
hit the new evolution.

569
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:09,830
There's a new evolution going on
with these young guys coming up.

570
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,660
It's fascinating. It will be, but that's
to be expected, right? With everything.

571
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:17,990
I guess especially with social media,
you get to see these guys,

572
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:21,320
like on Instagram you get to see the
moves at that guy's doing and all these

573
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:22,510
other break dancers get to see it.

574
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,730
They would have to see it live
rather seeing it in Korea,

575
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:26,660
they're seeing an in Japan,

576
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:29,430
they didn't have to travel and they're
seeing these moves and you slowed down.

577
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,060
We watch it and learn, learn. Right.

578
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,380
Crazy time and not only,
not only do we get to watch,

579
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:39,050
but we also get the shit
ass guide in his basement.

580
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:41,880
They get to talk shit about that.
You have is a little bit of that a lot.

581
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,700
There's a lot of it that can't
pay attention to that cow. I it,

582
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,260
it burns my soul too. Good to
pay attention to that. I hate,

583
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,200
I wish I was too good to say that,
but I get,

584
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,560
it's just like if I was coming here
and someone out in the parking lot said

585
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:57,140
something to me, I said, what the fuck?
Who the fuck you talking to you like that?

586
00:34:57,141 --> 00:35:00,950
You know, like we'd have a, it'd be a
moment there. Yeah. Oh yeah. For sure.

587
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,820
That's how I still feel today. But
um, well that's why your cowboy. Yeah.

588
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,630
That's why you are who you are. To
help you a little bit of this. Yes.

589
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:12,820
The new mood, new MOU that the super new,
super new, super new mood case of it.

590
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:15,470
A real new moon. That's it.
That's a gift from me to you.

591
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:18,530
I'm talking more about your, um, your,

592
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:23,180
your buddy Paul Paul Stamets. I'll
stand, miss enlight fuck. Okay, let's,

593
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:27,050
let's back this up. Let's back it all to
take this, take this train back. Yeah,

594
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,460
just a little bit. Okay.
So you speaking about DMT.

595
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,270
Okay. Let me look back up.
One more. One more beep.

596
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,730
I've never done any drugs in my entire
life. Did a lot of drugs are here already.

597
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:42,210
I know we're back up.
Remember, we're backed up.

598
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,300
I've never done any drug, ever. Never,
ever use this. Two years ago. Oh,

599
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:52,590
you did lose the one that's
the best legal. Oh, legal

600
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,610
law. Um, you're a product of drugs
and products of drugs. Cherry.

601
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,780
This is not a pharmacy. Fantastic
truck. It's made for great jokes.

602
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,440
Fun Times, right? How many fucking
people had because of Budweiser,

603
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,690
Budweiser. So good drug.

604
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,820
Well regulated. You know, you know what
one bottle does? That's why I like,

605
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,090
you know, one bottle does, makes you
want it to, right? But that's you.

606
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,110
That's on you man. One bottom. You
have some Goddamn self control.

607
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,210
One bottle. You know what a bottle of
Budweiser does. It's really clear true.

608
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,990
It's like you eat a fucking pot Brownie
who, it could be anything you know,

609
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,840
you could be, who knows the fuck
you're getting to get that limit.

610
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:41,100
And you tell everything is
3.2% poor people in Utah,
you know they're rebranding,

611
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,390
rebranding. I found out this last
night, they don't call Mormons anymore.

612
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,700
Erik Griffin was telling me,
calling the Mormon Mormon.

613
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:51,530
It's like calling a small person a
midget. Yup. What do you call it?

614
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,370
A latter day saints. Shout out to the
latter day saints. Magic underwear.

615
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:01,020
Magic underwear. So no drought. Okay.

616
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,280
No drugs talk.
You hear you're talking about DMG.

617
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:08,640
Everyone's on is DMT ride just sponsored
by this little company called on it,

618
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:12,810
which is now fucking huge company,
which I love by the way. The gut health.

619
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,510
Oh yeah. Probiotics mess. My favorite.

620
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,220
You eat Kimchi or anything like that?
Do you ever eat? No. You should.

621
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,430
You should get it. Get involved. Get
getting involved with some probiotics,

622
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,210
you know, um, uh, Kiefer's really
good. Kim. Choose really good.

623
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,000
Now your people are in Buckeye. You're
talking about your diet again. Ah Man.

624
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:32,160
It's good to, it's good.
People need to know like,

625
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,810
you gotta take care of your internal, you
know, you don't see that gut health man,

626
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:40,260
but it affects your depression,
your mood. The way your brain works,

627
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,750
where your immune system
functions got helps everything.

628
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:44,910
Those little Onnit packets
are key. Man, I don't,

629
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,490
I don't travel without those pitches.
I don't go a day without them.

630
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,830
I ate on my or new pack and
they got a new package for them.

631
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:52,140
Now they're not in the same
old box. More high tech. Cool.

632
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,310
They exist on the substrate that's in
those capsules. That's one of the ways,

633
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,390
the ways you don't have to refrigerate
it so good for travel because it's just,

634
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,940
I think you should have
a variety of probiotics,

635
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:05,580
but I think it's one of the most critical
things that people don't think about

636
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,590
anyway. Anyway, drugs, drugs,
drugs. Aubrey said, hey,

637
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,180
why don't you come out? We got a
little group, people doing some DMT.

638
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,190
Did he do the whole ceremony?
She loves music. Chanced.

639
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,420
Erica rose every the whole thing.
We smoked tobacco out by the fire.

640
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,940
I'm going play some of that acre.
Rose,

641
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,270
you're talking about talking about
what direction we wanted this to go.

642
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:33,390
You know what?
What we wanted the journey to consist of,

643
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,010
I call them my

644
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,730
best friends up. Take them with me
and we'd go out there and we fucking,

645
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,223
we do this,

646
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,460
we sit in this room and we go through
the chance in the ceremony and I'm scared

647
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,910
it because I've never done anything right.
Scared, scared, never done anything.

648
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,460
I wish that's it.

649
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,050
Waking,
waking up the spirits.

650
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,220
You just have that last year. It's on.
Oh Dude, this is just gonna make me trip.

651
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,440
So if I listened to this,
if I eat a pot Brownie,

652
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:12,300
listen to this and getting the tank,
I'll start trippin

653
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,030
all right.

654
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:21,360
It's because when you do DMT and you're,
you hear this stage dance for you, right?

655
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,630
So the, the experience,
you realize what this is.

656
00:39:24,631 --> 00:39:27,510
This is like a technology to maximize DMT.

657
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,630
And while while you're on this GMT,

658
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:35,790
this is playing in the background,
trying to drum and chance and yeah,

659
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:40,120
that's right. That's what's going
on. I was in a super smoothly,

660
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,240
my camera room I guess,
but it was

661
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,840
rather a nice,

662
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:46,850
okay.

663
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,760
He knows what the fuck is. Know what
the fuck he's doing. The real way.

664
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,340
You'd be a beautiful man,
really spiritual in the room.

665
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,010
He might be a beautiful man,
beautiful body,

666
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,830
and it looks like he's running a sex cult.

667
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,570
But what he really is doing is doing it
the right way to say it looks like the

668
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,650
gentleman Lee doing it the right way.

669
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:13,400
I can maybe sell the ranch to Aubrey
and sex called RB and I are partners.

670
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,410
We'll talk after this podcast.

671
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:18,880
So I just need to know what kind of
zone and you have and whether or not you

672
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:22,500
have water on the property. Go.
I have why you gotta well wow.

673
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:27,260
Two wells actually. So
what happened? All right,

674
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,220
so this music plan and they load the pie,

675
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,310
which to me looked like pink
cocaine, right? Like pink guts.

676
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,300
And they load it and
this pipe and he says,

677
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,790
just light it and you want to breathe
fresh air out of the corner of your mouth

678
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,350
as you're taking this harsh smoke.
It smells like burning plastic.

679
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,950
It's harsh. It's just hit it,
do you can't anymore. I'm like,

680
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:53,000
what the fuck does that mean? I try going
to hit this rubber, hit it, I hit it.

681
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:55,610
And then all of a sudden I say, oh,
you hit it until you can't anymore.

682
00:40:55,611 --> 00:40:59,900
And he starts getting wavy and then I
just the pipe balls out house and I fall

683
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:03,890
back. The entire world comes
back zooming in and be like

684
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,420
black and I shoot do this
fucking kaleidoscope of colors,

685
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,160
maybe 10 seconds and blow out the top
like superman out of the top of this tube

686
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:19,483
of colors,

687
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,660
it's total black darkness and I'm looking
at myself from my the third person.

688
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:30,220
I'm just hovering in midair and everywhere
that I've ever been injured or hurt

689
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,390
it glowing, bright like super white, like
the whitest white fire I've ever seen.

690
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:40,391
Like my head's on fire arms is this or
like something out of a fucking movie.

691
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:45,701
I'm just suspended in the air burning
and I keep asking myself questions

692
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,210
and then I don't know if it's me,
but I answered her back to myself.

693
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,463
Right.

694
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,420
I'm bugging the fuck up because you
could still hear this music going.

695
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,640
I can hear the people giggling next to me,

696
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,820
I can hear the next guy lighting the
lighter and he's now going and meanwhile

697
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:12,011
I'm is burning and I'm talking to myself
about whatever question I answered

698
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:18,950
right. And then all of a sudden, just as
fast as I came in, I kind of eyes woken.

699
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:22,370
I woke up and I still see the rest of
the guys in the room cause they like

700
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:25,700
systematically go around the
room and an order they're in,

701
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:27,350
they're in there and she hits.

702
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,830
Now the pipe comes around again
and now it's my turn again.

703
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,210
Now I'm really excited.

704
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,480
I almost wish halfway through the trip
you could fucking hit it again and go

705
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:39,070
back in. So I hate, and this
time I'm thinking, yeah,

706
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,560
I want to go back to that again.
I want to go back to where I just was.

707
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:46,440
So I fucking hate the pipe. Hit the
pipe, hit the pipe. Now I hit the pipe.

708
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:49,850
So God damn hard not hold my breath.
I fall over to the side,

709
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,470
I flied out ball to my left
side and I've tipped over. Well,

710
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,600
I sit back up because you're still there,
right?

711
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:59,660
You're not like in another dimension.
You're not out of your body experience.

712
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:05,050
So I sit back up for the entire trip
now is sideways and I'm looking at my,

713
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,410
this trip,

714
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:11,950
I'm looking at it crazy black rainbows
and I can explain what a fuck a black

715
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:13,190
rainbow looks like,

716
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:18,191
but they're waving with sparkles and black
into a keyhole that's turned sideways

717
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,040
and through a key hole,

718
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:24,590
a crazy light shapes and darts.

719
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:28,960
And every time I almost get to this key
hole, it just sucks back more something.

720
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,660
I've got to move that joy and
I crawled through it again.

721
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:37,661
I tried to get to the key hole and he
sucked back again and there was no words

722
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:38,541
spoken.

723
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:43,541
This one is me just trying to get to
this sideways keyhole and I just get my

724
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:49,901
hand to crawl through it and they would
fucking take off again and I woke up and

725
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,093
that was

726
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,150
who's my DMT experience. You've only
done it once? I'm only not at one time.

727
00:43:56,151 --> 00:44:00,080
I want to do it again. Yeah, you need
to do, yeah, just marijuana. Okay.

728
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:04,340
Done the Doug about marijuana
being a gateway drug. Um,

729
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,700
no.
DMT is a gateway drug for me.

730
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,760
What's the gateway drug to it allows you
to do other drugs and now I do a lot of

731
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:13,910
mushrooms.
Well,

732
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:18,560
it's one of those things where it lets
you know that all your ideas about what

733
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:20,510
drugs are, are out the window, right?

734
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,070
All your ideas are all your
ideas about what reality is,

735
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,970
are out the window because you didn't
think that this was a part of reality.

736
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,010
How could anybody ever think it before
you experienced it? But what I don't

737
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,010
get as things that shit shapes
and colors that I couldn't almost,

738
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:42,070
that you don't see today where I could
see him there and I could have exploded

739
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,860
like the shapes in the movements. It
was just so weird. Like you're right.

740
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:48,690
Like reality is like what the fuck?

741
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,460
How has that reality? And it seems
more vivid than reality, more

742
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,463
vivid.

743
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,460
But the chord that I'm going
to tell people are listening.

744
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:59,070
Like you can just open
your eyes, right? I mean,

745
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,710
you would be real hazy and kind of gone,
but I can hold my eyes.

746
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,330
I could see the candles
burning over there.

747
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:06,960
I could hear her lighters going and
then you're like, oh, I'm, I'm okay.

748
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,460
I'm not in another dimension. You're
going to get stuck in this crazy world.

749
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,460
And then how to close my eyes and
not go back into it. And Yeah.

750
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,570
I mean it's like the most of the realist
dream you've ever seen, right? Yeah.

751
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,430
There's another one called
five Meo DMT five methoxy DMT.

752
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,440
And it's a, is that the only room
tonight does a different way. The dial,

753
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:33,480
that one makes people really scared.

754
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,930
That's a different one because you see
you cease to exist on that one. Right.

755
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,050
It's more powerful, actually.
More, more potent. Yeah.

756
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:42,960
Which is crazy to think there's
something more potent and Dmt,

757
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:46,200
but it's more psychoactive in some ways.
And it's a,

758
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,720
it's one of those weird ones
that doesn't have visuals either,

759
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:52,230
but you just go to, you go to
everything, you go to heaven,

760
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,740
you become a part of it all.
It's crazy how clear.

761
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:57,810
Yeah.

762
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:01,080
And since you could make
of the uncensored, right?

763
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:04,770
Like I try to explain now on it, it
sounds weird, but when I was in it,

764
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,720
everything's so clear.
Yeah.

765
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,130
Well you realize how much of what's
holding you back in this life is like

766
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:14,540
insecurity and fear and, and, and it just,

767
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,020
it just not knowing, you know, and,

768
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:23,070
and confusion and all this and then it
just sort of like pours water on the

769
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:27,030
stuff that's dirty and clean out all the
bullshit out and goes no, it's all love,

770
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,070
happiness, friends, experiences,
live, camaraderie. Those
are the important things.

771
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,110
That's that you have a party,

772
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,100
you have a chance in this life to spread
more of that and help other people

773
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:41,430
spread more than keep this ball rolling.
And that could really change the world,

774
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:44,580
the change the world because the people
that you impact ripple out and they,

775
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:45,990
they impact other people.

776
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,380
Or You could just get caught up in
arguing with people online. You know,

777
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:50,214
you can get caught up,

778
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:54,540
get caught up in the water over the
dirt and just the chaos of it all.

779
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,570
It doesn't take much to get me caught up.
So what,

780
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,910
that's also why you're a great fighter.
You know, those things go hand in hand.

781
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:01,770
If you're a person just accepted bullshit.

782
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:04,380
Maybe you wouldn't be the guy that gets
up in the morning when you don't want to

783
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,620
give. You wouldn't be the guy that takes
those fights on short notice. He goes,

784
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:09,930
fuck it. Maybe you'd be the guy
that would be like, you know what?

785
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,320
This is not the right move for my
career. I have to sit back, have to,

786
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:17,160
you're not a, you're a, you're a wild
man. And that's why people love you.

787
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:21,360
But that's also, that needs to be
kind of, it seems to be appreciated,

788
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:22,560
but also managed,
right?

789
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,730
Like the chaos of your personality
and how you approach things. I mean,

790
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,450
you almost fucking died in the
caves, bro. This is what you do.

791
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,980
That's my other drug. Adrenaline.
Yeah. You got adrenaline. It,

792
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,870
uh, the things that people
were scared of, you flock to,

793
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,170
it's like you want to prove that
you're not scared of him. And I am.

794
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:49,060
I'm just as scared as you are. Sure. I
skydiving. I love it because it's like,

795
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:54,250
Ooh. Yeah. And we go, yeah, there's
no, there's no if, ands or buts.

796
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,770
And you jump out of a fucking plane.
I'm flying planes now.

797
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,310
Get my pilot's license. I'm putting, I've,

798
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,900
I started a little while back. I quit for
a while, but now I'm back. I'm all in.

799
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:07,540
I'm flying and I'm loving it,
man. I'm just telling you.

800
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,860
I watch that Leonard Skinner documentary
last night. Don't, don't fly.

801
00:48:10,861 --> 00:48:13,210
Shit he played. That's how
we lost lives. Skinner.

802
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,730
They didn't need it to get
their fucking plane fixed.

803
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,900
Trout fuck is true fucking pill heads,
man.

804
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,020
Two years I come back, I'll be
flying. I'll fly up. Fly out here.

805
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:31,600
Yeah man. So, so wild man.
So that's a bold movement. I
learned how to fly. I mean,

806
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:35,470
that's the ultimate right.
Drinking beer with you.

807
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:38,880
But it is easy to brother little campfire
where you fucking said we're slicing

808
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:41,800
dear. You should definitely
do that. One of these days.

809
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:45,760
You should come to us till the night
with us. Okay. You would love it, man.

810
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,580
It's the craziest hunting ever,
and it's like one of the most ethical,

811
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,430
you have to kill him. 30,000
deer on this one island. No,

812
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,600
20,000 deer and 3000 less touch that
little subject for a minute about,

813
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,030
we now have to kill these animals.
Why?

814
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:05,860
Because there's so many people that
are like, fuck you hunters. What? Why?

815
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,440
Why would you want to
take a life? Yeah. Well,

816
00:49:08,441 --> 00:49:12,160
the alumni is a different example because
it's an island to island filled with

817
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:14,500
deer and there's no wolves
and there's no mountain lions.

818
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,740
People have to eat them. They're fucking
everywhere. Yeah, because if they don't,

819
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:21,580
there's going to throw over
populated. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

820
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:24,490
But I mean, I think
the, the hunting thing,

821
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,090
the anti honey thing is probably real
similar to what we're talking about with

822
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:31,030
psychedelic drugs. It's people who
haven't experienced it. They don't,

823
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,650
they don't know what it really is and
they, a lot of them still, I mean,

824
00:49:35,651 --> 00:49:39,400
97% of the people in this country
eat meat. I'm one of them.

825
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,140
That's a crazy number.

826
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,750
When you think about how many
people get hated on for hunting.

827
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,680
That means for sure some of those
people that are hating also eat meat,

828
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,910
which is one of the most crazy
up ocracy he's ever crazy,

829
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,690
right? I mean when you
look at it like that. Yeah,

830
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,310
with the numbers because they are like,

831
00:49:57,311 --> 00:50:00,010
they as they're eating their
hamburger on the same breath,

832
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:04,810
there's telling you what a piece of shit
you are for killing ducks. Yeah. Yeah.

833
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,780
And it's disconnection. You think vegans,
if a mosquito lands on them, do they,

834
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,670
do they slap it and kill
it about that all the time?

835
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,750
Do they kill mice that are nibbling in
the corner of their house and making

836
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:19,510
noise or they can't sleep? They said
a mouse trap house. Good question.

837
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,380
Did they shoot the fly with the bad ass
new salt fucking shot call of this shit.

838
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:29,270
Me, I'm picking them bitches
off. I even met, I open the door,

839
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:32,640
I let him left him in from the horse.
Shit come on.

840
00:50:32,641 --> 00:50:37,290
And boy that got a little blue
black and doing hair flap.

841
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,410
So, uh, yeah, they, I mean,

842
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,140
just some of them does a mosquito
or a fly and not have a soul.

843
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:47,210
I went to an Osram once and uh, the
lady had a ant spray out. I was like,

844
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,000
what are you doing with that? She's like,
oh, we have an ant problem. Here I go,

845
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:54,440
you got an amp problem. Here
I go see killed with the
spray. That's fucking crazy.

846
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:59,270
This is ash. Rob is a Buddhist Ashram
and you are spraying ant spray.

847
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,840
You're poisoning deaths from the sky,
from the sky.

848
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,420
Fucking air warfare on these poor little
beings. Cause you don't like that.

849
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:11,930
They get too close to your
garbage. Hey, heavy. It's heavy.

850
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,050
It's crazy.
When you put in perspective like that,

851
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:18,230
they don't have an answer
doing wash yourself.

852
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,700
What about all those
microbiome on your body?

853
00:51:20,701 --> 00:51:23,600
You killing all that shit with soap.
What are you doing?

854
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,930
What are you doing every
time you wash your asshole?

855
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:31,390
It's a holocaust killing all this
life forms, right? Right. No,

856
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,750
no if, ands or buts. Every, I
mean it just about her of what La.

857
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:40,460
And the other problem is there's real
evidence that somehow or another plants

858
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:45,140
communicate with each other that they
have some sort of an, if not awareness,

859
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:49,610
they have some sort of a information
exchange between each other and they

860
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:53,060
changed their taste based on whether
or not other ones are getting eaten.

861
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,080
It activates certain responses in the
plants and then they become like really

862
00:51:57,081 --> 00:52:00,560
bitter and disgusting to animals so
that animals don't eat them. You know,

863
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:02,600
and they do this with like,
they can have a recording,

864
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:05,720
they can play recording of caterpillars
eating leaves next to a plant and it'll

865
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:08,690
change it's flavor profile and
excrete some sort of a chemical.

866
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:11,810
So the same discourages predation there.
There's some intelligence

867
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:18,010
evolving, right? Having to, it's
like, Ooh, Ooh, we're, we're, we're,

868
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,770
we're no longer going to exist
if this happens. We have to,

869
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:22,670
we have to evolve with the change,

870
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:27,671
which you talk about us becoming who
we are today from super primates to,

871
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,493
to write.

872
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,760
And I think now we're at cotton,

873
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:37,640
an error where the weak are
still allowed to coexist with us.

874
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,120
Yeah.
This a little bit of that.

875
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:48,440
But yeah, you laugh at that,
but it's true. Yeah, it's true.

876
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:53,790
And I just had a baby boy and I can't
wait to stand on the sidelines of the

877
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:56,690
soccer games and football games

878
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,670
and I can't wait to show up the fucking
track day and I'm bringing fucking

879
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:05,210
medals and trophies because my kid is
not getting the fucking participation

880
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:07,850
ribbon. He's here to win. Right.

881
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,340
When do we draw the line
back of of you don't just,

882
00:53:12,341 --> 00:53:17,180
just because you are weaker,
you get participation ribbon.

883
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:20,360
There's no more competition and
no understanding of psychology.

884
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:23,420
You can't protect people from
bad feelings like losing those.

885
00:53:23,421 --> 00:53:26,070
That's what propels you. That's what
makes you better. That's what we're,

886
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:29,280
that's what they're doing. So you're
telling you if my kids are awesome,

887
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,040
awesome football player and he's
on the team running touchdowns,

888
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,880
he has to sit the bench because
Tommy didn't get enough time to play.

889
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,070
And not only that,
Tommy,

890
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,880
you're his weak ass dad who fucking
secret emails the coach behind my back.

891
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,950
You know what I mean? Like
that shit to me. What the fuck?

892
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,930
So I can't,

893
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:53,990
I'm so excited to join this
new new journey of parenthood.

894
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:56,400
Parenthood. It's so
crazy, man. These kids,

895
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:59,760
and this is not all parents though,
you know,

896
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:02,970
some parents realize how stupid it is.
There's parents out there just like you.

897
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:07,700
Sure. Just like this is ridiculous.
This is a guy that's uh, his,

898
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:10,590
his daughter goes to school
with my daughter and uh,

899
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,160
I always gravitate towards him because
he's got a neck tattoo and immediately

900
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:15,720
I'm like,
anybody with a neck tattoo,

901
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:17,850
I'll relate to this because
that's a life decision

902
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,450
tat you mother fucker.

903
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:24,590
We gonna be all right because we're
where I don't have a neck tat,

904
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:26,970
but I know how you're
living so I'm with Ya.

905
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,340
And with these kids were playing
rough and he looked at me, he goes,

906
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:31,770
whatever happened to like getting hurt,

907
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,490
whatever happened to like falling down
and learn how, oh well it should do that.

908
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:37,950
That hurts. Yeah. Well know.
Learn how to fall better now.

909
00:54:37,951 --> 00:54:40,200
Learn how to not do that
anymore. Well, this,

910
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:43,550
this thing was going to make you slip
and scuff your needs. Okay? Yeah.

911
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,020
That's part of learning.
You can't nerf the world.

912
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,750
You can't nerf the fucking
world when you nerf the world.

913
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:52,230
And then you empower these people that
have lived in a nerve to environment,

914
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,070
that's a problem. They'd
have an experience, real
adversity. And they're mean.

915
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,910
One of the reasons why their
mean it's cause they're
scared. Yeah. A lot of these,

916
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,240
these people on social
media that are really mean,

917
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,230
they're the ones who are the most scared
and they're the ones who are the most

918
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,063
week for sure.

919
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,970
And the fact that they're so vulnerable
is what's leading them to lash out and

920
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:16,350
try to hurt other people because
they're so easy to hurt and damaged.

921
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:21,540
I mean that's, that's literally the,
the results of living in a nerfed world.

922
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,080
But these people that you say or so he,

923
00:55:24,081 --> 00:55:29,081
how was that satisfying them to
disable somebody that it's not,

924
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,580
they don't know what to do.
They're hurting and they just lash out of,

925
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:33,900
how are they writing an email?

926
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:37,350
Like I'm gonna get this motherfucker
sand and they're like, Ooh.

927
00:55:37,351 --> 00:55:42,150
And then they see this, what
that is gratifying for them.
They're like, not even,

928
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:45,360
it seems like it would be because
they're just, they're trying to hurt you.

929
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:49,350
They're trying to like get you, but then
eventually it comes back and gets them.

930
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:54,120
It's like they have to understand
Lebron James isn't doing that. No,

931
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,880
no. Winners are out there doing
that. This is loser behavior.

932
00:55:58,881 --> 00:56:02,850
Like you're lashing out at others
who are doing while you're not,

933
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:03,990
unless there's like,

934
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:07,230
if you have a legitimate problem
with someone talking about Lebron,

935
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:09,540
like in the NBA,

936
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:14,390
they don't just sit him down because
the other player 22 hasn't gotten enough

937
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:19,290
play time. No, no. The fuck I go ahead and
score again. Can we with you right here,

938
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,890
make some money, right? It's
good. It's good in the, we're
paying to watch on TV, but

939
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,790
when your kids in it, I don't get it
man, but I haven't experienced yet.

940
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:30,820
I've only had friends who
have fucking so excited to.

941
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:34,630
It's fascinating just to watch them
evolve, watched it a little minds grow,

942
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,760
watch talking to them.
You know,

943
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:39,660
just experiencing life through these
new eyes and seeing them learn.

944
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:42,580
It'll be a little fighter.
He's a rotten of a bitch.

945
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:47,170
He sleeps with his hands up and
this sleeps with his hands up,

946
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:51,320
both hands up. Oh, what are you
doing? And he was like, flex is out.

947
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:53,230
And he'll put them back and he
flexes his him out. And I'm like,

948
00:56:53,231 --> 00:56:57,850
what are you doing man? It's so cool.
It's this little jumper and he has to,

949
00:56:57,851 --> 00:57:01,930
he has blue frog and this red fish and I
don't know what this red fish did. Damn.

950
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,830
But that motherfucker would just
slide sideways and just look, stank.

951
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:08,920
I'm out for just sit there and stare
at him. 20 minutes, no movement,

952
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:13,250
no crime, just slouched over. And
he and he core parents of this red,

953
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:18,040
this red fish. And I'm like, what do,
what are you doing? And He, you know,

954
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:18,490
and I'll like,

955
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:22,480
and I'll spin and like play with them
and then he just finds him again,

956
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:25,410
just has a staring contest with
this fucking thing. Hilarious.

957
00:57:25,411 --> 00:57:28,060
His practice practicing practice
it. And Ah, I think that's,

958
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:32,740
it definitely carries on
through the child. It has to
write, has to, has to, I mean,

959
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:36,010
there's only, there's things that
people learn like, well, why kids?

960
00:57:36,011 --> 00:57:39,850
Scared of monsters. Well, you
don't have to be careful of
predators. Yeah. You know,

961
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,810
there's, there's lessons you learn,
you see things that are scary.

962
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,490
Like why do people have like
a fear of snakes? Oh yeah.

963
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:50,690
The barriers is the last one. Oh,
we've got a whole shelf. Perfect. Okay.

964
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:55,860
There's boy wants to go down. It's so
smooth. They do go down so smooth. Yeah.

965
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,680
I think for sure that some of your
personnel and it's going to be transferred

966
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:03,550
through your DNA. Do you have
life lessons? God, I can't
wait man. I'm so excited.

967
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,350
Yeah.
It's so cool to see.

968
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:10,410
See Him and how early are you gonna start
training them right away so it never

969
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:15,470
knows anything else. He, he,
not only Joe is he not gonna,

970
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:20,440
he's not gonna know anything else, but
we're dirt bike in work, wakeboarding,

971
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:24,820
word fucking scuba dive in.
We're every crazy thing I do.

972
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:28,280
He's going to do it and he shouldn't be
fucking launch and huge air and you got

973
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:31,090
to get around his other kids and he's just
kind of think that's just what you do.

974
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:35,110
Oh, you guys don't do that. Oh,

975
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:40,030
that's out of doing that for five years.
He won't know any different.

976
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,450
And um, yeah, I'll,

977
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:47,170
I'll definitely train him in wrestling
and Jujitsu and kickboxing. Absolutely.

978
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:52,300
Absolutely. And I'm going to be the dad
when he goes and eats a kid up at school.

979
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:56,350
I'm like, what? Danger you fucking animal.

980
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:59,950
How can aim is danger.
Your son's name is [inaudible].

981
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:03,850
My name is Donald [inaudible], so his
name's Dac. My initials and then son.

982
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:07,150
So he's my son.
Dangerous Serone DAX and dangerous.

983
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:11,590
Serone I'm gonna say Gauger
what are you doing it here?

984
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,990
You can't beat these kids up.
And as soon as we get in the hallway,

985
00:59:13,991 --> 00:59:18,630
fucking fist bump or whatever
you want, boy, let's go. Well,

986
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:22,220
you already have evidence now on
video. Got to go. You need to watch

987
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,080
this video now. I mean that's if,
if, if he's in there, you know,

988
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:31,460
defendant his or doing whatever he has to
do, I'm with him. Yeah. Get you some boy.

989
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,140
Well going to the world going to be
like just 10 years. Yeah. When he's,

990
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,310
think about how weird it
is from 10 years ago. How,

991
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,820
where's it going to a timber and my high
school we had beepers. That's right.

992
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:44,683
Beepers.

993
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:47,990
Remember when people had beepers that
also could send text messages and like

994
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:50,030
what the fuck you take it too far.
And I had a,

995
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,830
you can leave a voice message on mine.

996
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,160
You could talk about whether you
can call us and do it, but yeah,

997
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:59,660
I mean these kids, your kids are, have
no idea what it is to pass a note,

998
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:04,810
write or call. Um, uh,

999
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,730
Mr um, Mr Rogan, um, how was,

1000
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:14,390
I was just wondering if I could
talk with Sarah. Would that be cool?

1001
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,850
It's after nine o'clock. Idiot.
Click that after nine o'clock deal.

1002
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,980
Right. You have to know what
time you called. Texted them.

1003
01:00:23,981 --> 01:00:25,970
Bad precedent picture taken.

1004
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,410
But I think the picture taken is also
taken a lot away from life. Like even me,

1005
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:33,410
I get caught in and I'll go to lunch
with three of my friends and two minutes

1006
01:00:33,411 --> 01:00:37,640
into the lunch we're all Instagram
who's road and got on the show today.

1007
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:41,780
You know? I know it's,
it is a problem. You,

1008
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:44,030
you lose a lot of your life
to these fucking things.

1009
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,970
A lot of it and it sucks you in.

1010
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,680
But it's also so awesome because
so much is learned. Like you said,

1011
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:55,240
it needs to be managed and
you and like that's in rice.

1012
01:00:55,241 --> 01:00:56,810
People you want to talk about.

1013
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,880
We were just discussing the different
kinds of releases on the bow. Right?

1014
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,260
Well maybe I don't know about you. I
literally, two seconds after I leave you,

1015
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:10,850
I can youtube it and I can,
I can, you know it all, I
can know it all. It's crazy.

1016
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,860
I can have experts on
every single release,

1017
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:17,360
make Rolland judgment and decide what I
want to do. And that's crazy nowadays,

1018
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:18,230
you know,
and that's,

1019
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:23,470
the world is so much better in a
sense I think because you can do that.

1020
01:01:23,571 --> 01:01:27,140
But it takes away a lot of the
bullshit people used to have.

1021
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,010
Do you probably when you were in school
and the guy tells you, I'm this, this,

1022
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:35,750
this and this. Yeah. There's no
buddy goes other than Jimmy saying,

1023
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:40,460
Oh yeah, I was there. Yeah. Right.

1024
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,170
Yeah. He never knew. No. Now you
just go ahead like, wait, what?

1025
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:50,000
Nah, man. That uh, yeah,
that's, that's negative view.

1026
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,320
You are not a gold medalist and I write,
well,

1027
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,760
you still see some of those
guys are still floating around.

1028
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:59,750
This is a few of those guys are still
floating around that somehow or another

1029
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:01,970
made it through the net and then the dark,

1030
01:02:01,971 --> 01:02:04,250
they came in and the dark net
floating around right now,

1031
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:09,251
like kind of like skating on the
boundaries of incredulity was,

1032
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,900
yeah.
There's a lot of frauds out there.

1033
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:16,430
There's still still kind of
operating fake black belts.

1034
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:21,210
Fake gold medalists fake. Yeah. Why
would you want to be a vague black belt?

1035
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,690
They don't know any better. They just,
they just been lying there whole life.

1036
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,650
Mostly it's like the demons that you
experience when you do mushrooms.

1037
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,810
They got their own demons and you know,

1038
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:35,010
maybe it was childhood molestation does
people that lie that it's just nature.

1039
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,740
That's just what they do.
They're probably beaten as kids.

1040
01:02:37,741 --> 01:02:40,530
Their parents were shit.
Everybody lied to them.

1041
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,070
That lie that everybody that had
to be that person. Why does, why,

1042
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:48,030
why can't it be the rich kid that's born
in Beverly Hills that has everything

1043
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,740
and he lives, he's still
alive. He's still my kid.

1044
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,340
He'd be a p this big of a piece
of shit is that. It could be,

1045
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,670
but I bet a lot of those uh,
like real severe lighters,

1046
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:59,640
they come from abuse cause they
have to like create a false life.

1047
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,760
But you get a lot of abuse in rich
households too. Especially like,

1048
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,390
even though maybe the dad has to work 16
hours a day as a bank or something like

1049
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:09,390
that. He's never home. The mom's on
drugs. No one's taking care of the kids.

1050
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:12,120
They're hanging around with a bunch of
other lost kids and their school and

1051
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:16,920
they're all doing drugs
together and fucking off and
crime and all kinds of shit.

1052
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:17,700
Just to be,

1053
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:21,720
just to have an excitement in their life
because they're so bored and confused

1054
01:03:21,721 --> 01:03:24,790
and lost and lonely and they
start lying to a lot. I mean,

1055
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:28,590
all comes from the same place. Whether
it comes from a rich kid or a poor kid,

1056
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,740
it comes from your life being
fucked up and you, you're not,

1057
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:35,340
you're not liking who
you are to eat mushrooms.

1058
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,510
That'll help and deal with the demons
still with the demons and then go do

1059
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:42,480
something. Go do something so
that you know that you could,

1060
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:46,290
you could experience some nerves,
you know, and, and you could,

1061
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:50,190
you could rise to the occasion, you know
what I mean? And learn about yourself.

1062
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:53,970
That you could overcome that and you
could make mistakes and fail and then try

1063
01:03:53,971 --> 01:03:57,870
it again and succeed. And then what
the, the bad feelings that you get,

1064
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,620
like when you're worried about losing,
you know, and these, these, these fears,

1065
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:05,940
it's because winning is so high. Man.
I've seen you went so many times.

1066
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:07,980
I've called so many of
your fights and you know,

1067
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:10,380
I look right in your eyes whenever
you win. And there's just like,

1068
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,950
this dude's on fire right now. He
was just like, there is no other,

1069
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,600
I couldn't even explain to you
that feeling because no one can,

1070
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:23,160
nobody can sign up to
do it other than fuck,

1071
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:28,020
fuck yeah. Right. That's right. Yeah.
That's a feeling. You know what I mean?

1072
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:32,370
Like that's, but it's, fuck
yeah. At times, like a million.
Ooh. You know, you know,

1073
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:37,020
and, and God, it's, it's the highest
highs man. It's just insane how,

1074
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,570
how cool it feels.
Um,

1075
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,470
I've seen like with you
particularly like Kaos, right?

1076
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,130
Like there's something about
chaos when you just crack someone,

1077
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,840
then it's over and then you're, you're
walking around. I'm like, you'll,

1078
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:50,700
you'll like glowing. Well, I feel like

1079
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,920
I'm in my DMT. Yeah, you did it.

1080
01:04:55,921 --> 01:05:00,150
You went through all the fucking demons
and all the darkness and all the fear

1081
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:03,180
and all the insecurity,
and then he landed and then it's over.

1082
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,830
And then it's just as fast as it
started to tell her, that's crazy.

1083
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:13,430
That's over. And then it's like,
hey, four weeks from now, blah, blah,

1084
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:15,660
blah. Fell out. Yeah. What
are you going to do? Like,

1085
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:18,010
we're going to fucking do it
again and to start over. Yeah,

1086
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,090
we're going gonna start a lower and
if you realize that and like how,

1087
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:23,330
how long are you gonna fight
til I'm going to find out.

1088
01:05:23,331 --> 01:05:25,990
I don't love it anymore Joe.
I really am man. That's,

1089
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,240
I don't have an answer for anybody.

1090
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:32,130
Like to go to answer the day
that I wake up and I'm like Nah,

1091
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:38,500
what we need is medical science to catch
up where they get fixed everything 100%

1092
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:41,920
right? Like head injuries and
bone injuries, everything.

1093
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:45,790
Just put people in some sort of
microwave machine. Whether it is,

1094
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,330
I bring it back to 100% thank you sir.

1095
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:55,160
So then fighting becomes a matter of
temporary injury rather than permanent

1096
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:59,960
injury and then it's a whole and
then it's a whole nother ball of wax.

1097
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:03,710
It's a whole nother ball where
everyone's fighting 100% healthy. Yeah.

1098
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:07,400
And you also don't have to worry
about like your longterm health,

1099
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:09,660
which is like one of the big
problems with fighting. Yeah.

1100
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:11,370
You're like you want to
arm bar me and break it.

1101
01:06:11,371 --> 01:06:15,730
Break to just see the guy
who got his motherfucking
arm crack the last fight. Um,

1102
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,790
was it last Friday? Lincoln, Nebraska.
I didn't see it. Who got onboard?

1103
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,230
A guy from Colorado and I watched
the crown was such a shit,

1104
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:27,080
I don't know his name. He, um,

1105
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:32,820
the Brazilian guy took him down arm
barred and snapped it home. Not In snap.

1106
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:36,380
It popped it and pulled it all in, way
back and had it. Then he said, man,

1107
01:06:36,381 --> 01:06:39,170
I felt it pop, but I told myself winning
and losing this and he just kept,

1108
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:41,270
kept on all the moments like that,

1109
01:06:41,271 --> 01:06:45,820
that you could just say a fucking
break it because I'm going to use the

1110
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:50,720
microwave. Yeah. I'm going ride from
here, ambulance to the, to the microwave.

1111
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:55,880
10 minutes. I'm fucking
him. Me, that's possible.

1112
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:57,860
Someday maybe it's not in our lifetimes,

1113
01:06:57,861 --> 01:07:00,680
but it's possible someday and fighting
is going to be a different thing.

1114
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,620
Like that was what was
so impressive about John.

1115
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:08,000
When Victoria got his arm v toward Jesus,

1116
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:10,183
he uh,

1117
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,230
okay.

1118
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:15,490
Oh man, this is nasty. This is right. Rate
Tabs. The tabs right here. But before?

1119
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,480
Before, I don't know. I don't know
if they got out of the scene. Yeah.

1120
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,390
Before this. There he is. He has,

1121
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:26,280
he puts it behind his back
and he has it fucking boat.

1122
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:30,510
This guy used to train at Jackson's
to the Brazilian guy on the bottom.

1123
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,480
Hmm.
Yeah.

1124
01:07:33,481 --> 01:07:36,840
When John got tapped by v
toward that was so nasty.

1125
01:07:36,841 --> 01:07:41,400
I mean he was fully hyper extended and
it just didn't tie and his arm was fucked

1126
01:07:41,401 --> 01:07:45,180
up for a while afterward. Right. That's
why he had to host the ultimate fighter.

1127
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:50,910
Correct. He really couldn't train
properly with it. Yeah. That's, that's uh,

1128
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,120
it's going to be a different animal in
the future when people aren't worried as

1129
01:07:54,121 --> 01:07:56,670
much about permanent damage.
Right.

1130
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,390
I hope I need it because I
do a lot of permanent damage.

1131
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:06,330
Yeah.
The most damaged today's permanent damage.

1132
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:09,420
Wild excursions.
I go on.

1133
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:13,380
Tell me about the cave dive you want
to learn about cave diving. Kay.

1134
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,573
So

1135
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:21,680
first of all k dive in is the
last certification someone
we can get caving right

1136
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,560
in, in, in diving. Like you
started off to get your open water,

1137
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,060
then you move geared,
advanced open water,

1138
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,200
get your ear nitrox and you start,

1139
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:35,260
you start learning the rules of mother
nature because mother nature is never

1140
01:08:36,051 --> 01:08:38,360
going to take a loss.
She wins every time.

1141
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,930
The only bitch I know that wins
100% of the time, right? You cannot,

1142
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,380
you cannot fuck with her and
come out winning. So when she,

1143
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:48,260
when she wants to take you, she takes
you. So you learn about all these

1144
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:53,600
different rules of the water and of the
nitrogen levels that you're taking into

1145
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:58,460
your body. Um, and the cave
diving is about five years.

1146
01:08:58,461 --> 01:08:58,621
And I,

1147
01:08:58,621 --> 01:09:03,621
I got my certification in high
school and I am a super cave diver.

1148
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:07,850
Man. I love it. I love it. I love, I love
diving. I love everything about diving.

1149
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:12,800
I love ship diving. Um, so no days,
caves, you name it. I love it.

1150
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:17,030
So we were in Cozumel a
couple weeks ago and uh,

1151
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,210
one of my old,
you could almost call him instructor.

1152
01:09:20,211 --> 01:09:22,700
He's taught me a lot of what
I know about diving today.

1153
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:28,540
We a dove three or four days with some
buddies of mine that were down and goes,

1154
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:33,280
Mel just went through, some ships,
went through, some k are, uh, like, um,

1155
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:36,600
it's the coral reefs just playing around
down with them. And then we go and do a,

1156
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,860
a, a serious diabetes. He's
getting a little bit older.

1157
01:09:39,861 --> 01:09:44,270
His mind is still very, very,
very sharp. But his motor skills

1158
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:50,450
don't keep up with them much anymore.
Right. And in, in a cave diving, it, uh,

1159
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:52,970
it's very necessity that you need.

1160
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,210
So we jumped in this cave.

1161
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:59,090
It's rewind to 20 minutes.

1162
01:09:59,091 --> 01:10:03,140
I had just kissed my girl and
my new baby and she's, I don't,

1163
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,470
I don't really want you to
go like, right. I don't,

1164
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:11,900
he just, I don't want to say his
name, but the guy you're going with,

1165
01:10:11,901 --> 01:10:16,430
like I'm worried. I said,
what are you worried about?

1166
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:17,750
I said,
I'll come at home.

1167
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:23,780
This is what I come home every time
coming home. Fuck. I Dunno. I Dunno.

1168
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:29,460
So I pick up another, I order another
um, cylinder of air just for x.

1169
01:10:29,461 --> 01:10:34,240
Y I have to, originally I'm going
with order another cylinder air. Just,

1170
01:10:34,241 --> 01:10:37,190
I told her just for, just for,
just to fucking have it right.

1171
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,240
No one's ever died because they
have too much hair. He gave diving,

1172
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:44,860
you dive in third. So if we have
300 PSI would do a thousand Psi,

1173
01:10:44,861 --> 01:10:49,310
n would do a thousand psi out and we
have a thousand psi in case something

1174
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:53,570
fucking happens
also in cage dive and they have lines.

1175
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:57,050
You run these in a cave.
The law already had a line run.

1176
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,980
A bunch of guys like me, tech divers
have gone into caves, discovered them,

1177
01:11:00,981 --> 01:11:01,581
they mapped them,

1178
01:11:01,581 --> 01:11:05,840
they named them and they put put lines
so you can follow them in case something

1179
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:07,400
happens. Right. Get in and get out

1180
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,960
lines and lines and none of the lines
really connect to for like the main lines,

1181
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:15,780
we'll have like three
or four main lines down,

1182
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:18,090
big channels of the cave
because caves are huge. Right?

1183
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:21,870
From an intro to the main line. Usually
no one has a caveat. You have to,

1184
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:23,220
you have to make it to
what's called a jump.

1185
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:27,300
You have to make your own own line
because they just don't want someone

1186
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:30,480
listening on deer today to go
find a cave, jump in, swim down,

1187
01:11:30,481 --> 01:11:32,910
and be able to get in and out
and get lost in there. Now also,

1188
01:11:32,911 --> 01:11:35,280
we have a Thailand incident.
We're looking at one in the city people.

1189
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:41,010
So we make a jump tie off.
You put these direction arrows down.

1190
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:44,040
Um, they're called cookies, right?

1191
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,210
Pointing out towards the direction out
of the cave is that way if something

1192
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:51,930
happens, you come out, when you
make a jump, you take your light,

1193
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,740
you wrap it around your neck, and then
you have two hands that work on the line.

1194
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:01,290
The Guy I was with didn't
follow some of our rules.

1195
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:03,030
And in cave diving,

1196
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:07,680
it's kind of an unwritten fact
that you only worry about you.

1197
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:11,700
I'm coming home, right? I'm
fucking staying alive. So Joe,

1198
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:13,830
you mean and I were Dave diamond,
if something were to happen,

1199
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:15,870
I'm not going in there to get you.

1200
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,660
No reason for two of us die
and only ones in there can die.

1201
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,420
So he tries to tie off his buoyancy.

1202
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:27,810
Fucking he hits the roof of the cave,
kicks his feet,

1203
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,770
spins analysis on this line
that's supposed to be tied off,

1204
01:12:31,771 --> 01:12:35,310
which is our fucking lifeline
is now wrapped around him.

1205
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:41,310
So I swim over to them and I tried to
help him unhooked this line and he goes

1206
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:43,650
into panic and panic
kills everybody involved.

1207
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:47,520
Everybody involved dies with panic and
that's something that I can't express

1208
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:50,130
enough. So he started fucking
freaking out, hitting the roof,

1209
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:52,650
spinning silk fucking hour.
And I just back out,

1210
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,270
take about four or five
big strong steps back

1211
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,570
when I grab a hold of the main line.

1212
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:04,170
Now it's silting out now and
I see something silting out.

1213
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:06,310
There's all this like sediment,
the ends on the bottom of,

1214
01:13:06,311 --> 01:13:09,810
of these caves and you were
like a little tiny room.

1215
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:14,550
So if you kick your fin hard,
it kicks up like dark dust,

1216
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:19,320
mud, sediment, silt. You can't
fucking see anything blacks out.

1217
01:13:19,321 --> 01:13:20,670
So I back out of the silt.

1218
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:25,800
I grabbed the line and I see them in
their fucking freaking and panicking,

1219
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:30,060
spinning and rolling around, getting all
caught up in this line. And I'm like,

1220
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:33,570
fuck,
I just stay calm.

1221
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:38,610
This was the exit. I know where it is
cause I know where I am. There's the exit.

1222
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:42,420
He was making a jump to go down
another tunnel. There he is.

1223
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:47,250
Now what I just tell you about the
rule that someone comes home, right?

1224
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:52,260
I broke the rule and I went in to get him.
I said fuck it down.

1225
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,370
So I let go of the line

1226
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,860
and I go in to get him because his light
fucking is off now. And I'm thinking,

1227
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:03,400
God damn, he spun up in this line.
Is Lights off? Did he drop his ray?

1228
01:14:03,401 --> 01:14:05,430
You later? Is he had air? Is he okay?

1229
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:11,310
Sooner as I go into the sill,
fucking lose everything, man.

1230
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:15,640
Lose my way. Where I am, my up, my down.

1231
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,670
I don't know where I am.
A fucking panicky now I'm panicking.

1232
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:23,650
Fucking freaking out more than
any I've ever breathing hard bang.

1233
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,690
Hit My head on the fucking ceiling and I
just close my eyes. I'm like, God dammit.

1234
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,700
Calla, calm the fuck down. Calm the
fuck down. Calm the fuck down. Breathe.

1235
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,833
Yeah.

1236
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:37,340
Came. See my hands in front of me. I
have two watches on their glowing right.

1237
01:14:37,341 --> 01:14:40,580
Those are my does let me know my death,
my time, everything. Or I have to, to,

1238
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:45,510
to dive computers. I
check them. I look calm.

1239
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:49,940
I checked my light, I gotta turn my
light and burn. Burn my, uh, our, um,

1240
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,460
pressure gauges,
their glow in the dark rides.

1241
01:14:52,461 --> 01:14:57,380
I'm charged with my light and I look at
it. Okay. Air Check my second one. Okay.

1242
01:14:57,381 --> 01:15:00,560
Air. I know my third one's good because I
haven't even opened it yet. That's just,

1243
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:03,500
just in case I breed down,
I fucking think.

1244
01:15:03,501 --> 01:15:06,440
And I came to see my hands in front of
me and to this day I closed my eyes and

1245
01:15:06,441 --> 01:15:09,920
it gives you nightmares. Write him out.
Just thinking about it. Cloudy, dark,

1246
01:15:09,921 --> 01:15:12,050
can't see anything.
All I can see is the home of my light.

1247
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:17,090
So I turned my light off. Not trying to
think of like, all right, just, just,

1248
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:22,340
just calm, calm yourself, figure this
out. Where's, where's our partner?

1249
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,900
I started feeling around and he's nowhere
to be found, right? Nowhere to be found.

1250
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:29,031
So I'm now,

1251
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:34,031
I've calmed myself a little bit and I
start feeling the walls and I start moving

1252
01:15:34,491 --> 01:15:36,260
around.
I'm trying to think where am I?

1253
01:15:36,261 --> 01:15:38,270
But I don't know because we
haven't been down this channel yet,

1254
01:15:38,271 --> 01:15:42,560
so I don't visually haven't made
an imprint of, oh there's that.

1255
01:15:42,561 --> 01:15:45,860
There's this right.
Kind of like a mental imprint in my mind.

1256
01:15:45,861 --> 01:15:48,260
Cause that's what we're doing as
you coming in and landmarks. Right.

1257
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:51,800
I don't have any of those. I don't
have any feel, I don't have any touch.

1258
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,360
And I'm moving around,
moving around.

1259
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,160
What took accomplish reading of the
direction of the front when we tied off of

1260
01:15:58,161 --> 01:16:00,170
the, at the first jump, right?

1261
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:04,550
So I know 126 degrees is the way out,

1262
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:09,770
but in a cave they twist and they move
and they're up and they're big and

1263
01:16:09,771 --> 01:16:11,240
they're deep and they're low ride.
They,

1264
01:16:11,241 --> 01:16:13,730
there's no rhyme or reason
how the water made the cave.

1265
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:18,380
So it's kind of a
direction I can think of.

1266
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:20,630
The first thing that comes to my mind,
I start swinging that way now.

1267
01:16:20,631 --> 01:16:22,640
I hit a wall, boom, and I go down.

1268
01:16:22,641 --> 01:16:26,070
I hit a wall and I'm fucking in panic
mode again. I fucking swim him now.

1269
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:28,520
Just start swimming and
kicking a fucking going crazy.

1270
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:32,180
I make my way out of the silt and I
fucking turned on back on the main line,

1271
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:35,840
right?
I find the main line to the cave again,

1272
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:39,740
which is 800 yards to the front,
to the door

1273
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,190
and grab hold of the main line.
I fucking real it. Anyhow. Okay.

1274
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:51,450
Now the entire behind me
deeper into the cave is free.

1275
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:56,380
It's no problem. Silk Free.
I can see everything's good.

1276
01:16:57,670 --> 01:17:00,370
More I need to go is fucking
Celdt it out and blown.

1277
01:17:00,371 --> 01:17:04,120
Gone and completely fucking wash. I
can't, I couldn't see you sitting there,

1278
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:06,360
but I can see everything behind us.
Sure.

1279
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,320
We can't see you have the main line,

1280
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:13,850
but I don't have the jump line to get
the fuck out. So I started thinking,

1281
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:17,210
I was looking in the cave maps to try
and like before we went and just try to

1282
01:17:17,211 --> 01:17:20,810
get a visualize of, of, of the direction.
I'm trying to remember landmarks.

1283
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:26,120
I can't see anything. I can't feel it.
I'm like, fuck, there was a split up here.

1284
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:28,610
So I start, I, uh, go back into,

1285
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:34,150
back into the silt again
and I start feeling around
and I'm feeling and I find a

1286
01:17:35,331 --> 01:17:39,290
hole and I'm like, is that the right
way? Is that the one I want to go down?

1287
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:43,730
Where does that one go? Okay, maybe remind
me. And I remember, I remember that.

1288
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,410
That's not okay.
Let's go to this next one.

1289
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:49,130
I go into the next one and now this is,
this is where it's gotta be him going,

1290
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:53,080
but all of a sudden I'm
swimming against the current.

1291
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:56,840
And I remember when I came into this cave,
there's this very slow current,

1292
01:17:56,841 --> 01:18:00,290
which is why the entire case now
washed out from that point on, right?

1293
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,620
The current is taking out. So I'm like,
fuck, you're swimming against the current,

1294
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:04,610
so you're going the wrong way.

1295
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:09,480
I somehow work that into my
fucking panic mind. We're,

1296
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,030
we're swimming into the car,
we're swimming in the corner.

1297
01:18:11,031 --> 01:18:13,700
That's where we're going the wrong way.
So I fucking turned swim back.

1298
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,730
I'm back on the fucking main line again.
Right? A find the main lines clear.

1299
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,200
I out into the clear
main line. Fuck, fuck,

1300
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:25,700
fuck. I start like hi preventing and,
and panicking. And I'm thinking, man,

1301
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,970
are you fucking you piece of shit? This
is how he will die. What the fuck are you

1302
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:31,990
right now?

1303
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:36,770
And keep remind kissing my wife and kid
by kid saying I'm coming home today.

1304
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:39,080
I'm coming home.
I'm coming home.

1305
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:43,520
So I'd do it again and I fucking
venture into the fucking great unknown.

1306
01:18:43,521 --> 01:18:48,050
Fucking a bis. Total blackout,
another panic and other panic.

1307
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:48,980
Fucking freak out.

1308
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:54,070
Can't find a way he had chicken
losing air by the fucking second bro.

1309
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:56,150
Cause now I'm breathing hard on breeding.

1310
01:18:56,151 --> 01:19:00,680
Fucking irrational and I'm sucking
my tank's dry. Right. Mind you,

1311
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:04,820
I'm on air so I don't have, there's
no, there's no answer to this.

1312
01:19:04,821 --> 01:19:09,410
After I breathe my last breath,
keep checking anything.

1313
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:14,060
Keep keeping my time look in direction.
Time, time, air, time, fuck, slowdown,

1314
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:18,470
slowdown, slowdown, diamond pitch.
Fucking black. Can't see anything.

1315
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:22,100
Trying to figure out where I'm at. What
I'm thinking. What am I doing? Okay,

1316
01:19:22,101 --> 01:19:25,280
we're running out of air. How much time
do we have? Kalbi we're at 28 feet.

1317
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:26,600
I know we're at 28 feet.

1318
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:30,500
I could probably read on this for about
another hour on this tag. Another hours.

1319
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:34,670
We've got another hour. Okay. We've
been in here fucking 38 minutes already.

1320
01:19:34,671 --> 01:19:37,010
How are we going to do

1321
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,650
start trying to find my way out.
I can't. Trying to find a way out.

1322
01:19:42,651 --> 01:19:47,630
I can't now. I started
thinking, what am I going to do?

1323
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:52,220
I'm not going to drown Joe drownings
like my biggest fear of my life,

1324
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,220
so everything that that's called
a BC and we carried on her bag.

1325
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:57,500
It's a buoyancy control device.
That's how you,

1326
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,110
that's how you control your buoyancy
when you're scuba diving, right.

1327
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:05,030
It probably holds
20 big,

1328
01:20:05,031 --> 01:20:09,750
huge strong breasts, so I feel that
motherfucker up. This is my plane.

1329
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,280
MOFILM IBC BC up,

1330
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:16,680
which throws me to the top of the cave
bunk right now I'm only now I've got to

1331
01:20:16,681 --> 01:20:21,030
flip upside down and have like crawl on
the ceiling trying to figure out where

1332
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:23,730
the fuck I am, how I'm at. Now I've
got to get out of a cave upside down

1333
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:29,850
and I'm thinking, all right, we
switched to our last bit of air.

1334
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,910
How are we going to do this,
Calvin? What are we going to do?

1335
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:41,240
Filled RBC up when I run out of air,
I'm now thinking in my mind,

1336
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,730
how am I going to die, Joe, right?

1337
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:47,450
Tell my wife telling my kid I'm
not fucking. I'm coming home now.

1338
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:50,120
I got to fucking realize
how am I going to die?

1339
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:53,470
I have a notepad that you carry in
your pocket to draw and write on.

1340
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,540
I'm thinking, what? What? What
are you going to say? What's your,

1341
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:59,330
what's your letter going to be?
You're writing a fucking death later.

1342
01:20:59,331 --> 01:21:01,730
You're awake. You're a
fighter. We figured this out.

1343
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:05,000
They will fucking find a way to quit.
You fucking bitch.

1344
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:07,700
He's the conversation I'm having with
myself while I'm in fucking bleed.

1345
01:21:07,701 --> 01:21:11,030
Panic morning, complete darkness, thinking
that there's no, this is how people die.

1346
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,950
What the fuck are you doing?

1347
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,950
You're going to write a letter to
your fucking kid and tell her how you,

1348
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,620
how you fucked up. I'm sorry.
Daddy's not coming home.

1349
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:23,060
So I'm fucking thinking
I'm not going to drown.

1350
01:21:23,061 --> 01:21:24,560
I'm not going to breathe my last breath.

1351
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,530
So I'm going to breed this BC that
just fill up with air and I'm a fucking

1352
01:21:27,531 --> 01:21:31,250
breathe it until the oxygen
level no longer happens and
I just pass out. That's,

1353
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:34,160
that's my, that's what I've come
to realize how I'm going to die.

1354
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,410
I'm going to fucking just
slip away and pass out,

1355
01:21:36,411 --> 01:21:38,660
keep breathing the same air until

1356
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:43,820
I go away and I start thinking,
you fucking piece of shit.

1357
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,550
You're,
you're giving up.

1358
01:21:46,551 --> 01:21:50,120
I think you're having legitimate
conversations with myself while fucking

1359
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,250
complete panic. Like you're,
you're going to quit that.

1360
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:55,910
You're writing a letter and you're gonna
fucking breathe your last air until you

1361
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:59,210
pass out you fucking pussy. You're
a fighter. Figure the fuck out.

1362
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:04,820
So I'm upside down and crawling on the
ceiling. And I remember when I came in,

1363
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:09,710
we came in the big cave and as like a
huge fucking crack that runs along the top

1364
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,301
turn.

1365
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:13,790
Both my watch is off now at this point
because they're giving off light and I

1366
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:17,420
kill my light and I said that crack
gonna fucking lead to the surface.

1367
01:22:17,421 --> 01:22:21,530
That cracks going to fucking give us
something. So I just call start panicking.

1368
01:22:21,531 --> 01:22:25,190
Me Panicking Lenia again because I'm
panicking. I don't know what to do.

1369
01:22:25,370 --> 01:22:28,850
I'm sucking air and I'm fucking breathing
hard and I'm hyperventilating and

1370
01:22:28,851 --> 01:22:32,180
crying on the sitting, crying on the
ceiling looking for this fucking cracking.

1371
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:33,230
God Damn it.
I found it.

1372
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:37,870
I found the crack and I followed the crack
and the crack got bigger and all of a

1373
01:22:37,871 --> 01:22:42,110
sudden I see fucking glow like green glow,
crawl and crawl.

1374
01:22:42,111 --> 01:22:44,540
Cron find it, try to get
up. I take her too big.

1375
01:22:44,541 --> 01:22:47,930
I can't fucking get out of the little
hole. Can't get out of the hole.

1376
01:22:47,931 --> 01:22:52,550
I'm fucking big, big,
big, big fucking hitting,

1377
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:56,750
screaming, freaking out. Calm down. Kind
of like calm down. Kelly, this is the way,

1378
01:22:57,050 --> 01:23:00,620

Reel it in. We're here. We made it.

1379
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:06,190
Grab control,

1380
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:11,040

theK fucking I'm out made it.

1381
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:14,960
You're coming home.
You're talking about. Wow.

1382
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:22,660
That was the feeling.
Meanwhile, my guys out there,

1383
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,750
I can't be mad at him because he panicked.
He grabbed line,

1384
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:26,980
he fucking ran out the hole.

1385
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,850
He looks at me and he says,
um,

1386
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,113
okay,

1387
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:40,520
so we're not diving together ever
again, Ali. I said, no, that was it.

1388
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:47,270
That was it. And I texted my
girl, I love you baby. And uh,

1389
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,750
they was fucking scary moment,
but daddy's coming home.

1390
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,310
Okay.

1391
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:54,970
And it was fucking so crazy
because that was, I mean,

1392
01:23:54,971 --> 01:23:58,780
I've almost died numerous times,
but almost dying slowly,

1393
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:01,620
which puts it in perspective to me
like these guys on death row. What?

1394
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:06,640
I always thought like, yeah, fucking
killer murder or man, that's fuck him

1395
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:12,520
dude. Knowing the time and
how much time you have left,

1396
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:17,710
that's some scary shit, Joe. Knowing
that you have two hours left,

1397
01:24:17,711 --> 01:24:21,640
how much air do you have left?
At the end. Maybe another hour,

1398
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:23,200
probably an hour and some change.

1399
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:27,413
But

1400
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:30,480
could you imagine how I had to talk
to myself? How I was going to die?

1401
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:34,500
Like to me that fuck me up.
I fuck me up really bad.

1402
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:38,820
Like I probably had to go
do some mushrooms and asked
myself question questions

1403
01:24:38,821 --> 01:24:42,540
now because that fucked me up bad.
But the inner me, the fighter,

1404
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:44,550
the youth do new fare at the fuck out.

1405
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:50,100
But was I going to write a letter? I was
fucking damn close to write in a letter.

1406
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:56,280
It was crazy, man. It was wild.
Damn. Hold on. I explained that.

1407
01:24:56,281 --> 01:25:00,930
Good for everybody who explained it.
I'm like a mother. Yeah, I'm nervous.

1408
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,900
I'm like, I was there. Fuck Dude.

1409
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:09,600
That is crazy. Yeah, man. And um,

1410
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,930
I'm going to do it again now.
I'm not scared of it like that.

1411
01:25:12,931 --> 01:25:15,510
It's just needs to be done better.

1412
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:20,970
I'll run my own motherfucking line. Well,
it also shows you how important it is.

1413
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:25,830
Like what your wife was
saying. Yeah. Camp. She, you
know, she, she knew something.

1414
01:25:25,831 --> 01:25:30,270
She had a sense like right when people
fuck up a lot or when they're just that

1415
01:25:30,271 --> 01:25:32,490
person that just can't keep it together.

1416
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:35,940
You gotta be real careful
around those people. Yeah. Yeah.

1417
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,920
Fucking crazy shit man.

1418
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:43,680
I mean that's what people kill
those people in war. Yeah.
You know, they just like,

1419
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:46,980
look, we can't do this. Yeah, we can't.
Everybody killed. Yeah. Your, your,

1420
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:51,990
your panic is sure. Yeah, sure.
Yeah. You're not hanging in there.

1421
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:55,590
You, you become a detriment. Fuck Dude.

1422
01:25:55,591 --> 01:25:58,140
That is one of the craziest
stories I've ever heard in my life.

1423
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:02,360
But I'm glad I got to share it
with you fucking press. Let's move.

1424
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:03,920
I don't know how clean

1425
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:07,370
can know. Agree Grandpa, that one man.

1426
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:14,570
So as, um, as a tap out guys did for
me. I'm starting a new fight series,

1427
01:26:14,571 --> 01:26:15,710
cowboy fight series,
man,

1428
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:19,520
amateur and we're traveling all around
the country and we're going to be putting

1429
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:23,390
shows and I'm going to try and find these
new up and comer kids and bring them

1430
01:26:23,391 --> 01:26:27,200
the ranch. What are you doing it on?
I was talking with antler fight pass.

1431
01:26:27,201 --> 01:26:31,580
I think when we get on UFC
fight pass and um, yeah,

1432
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:34,100
we're going to have probably
eight undercard fights,

1433
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:36,170
probably two little guys in that area.

1434
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:40,400
And then we're going to a four man
tournament for designed weight class.

1435
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:42,140
We'll probably go,
I don't know,

1436
01:26:42,141 --> 01:26:46,700
maybe got a 70 or 85 maybe 55 first and
the winner of the four man tournament

1437
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:51,050
gets to come live with me.
Train get brought up.

1438
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:55,160
I know everybody, man. I can make a call
and get them on all the local promotions,

1439
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:58,730
you know what I mean? Get them, build
these guys up and try and give back man.

1440
01:26:58,731 --> 01:27:01,520
And do like with the cow with the
tableau guys did for me and just really,

1441
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:05,850
I don't know, show show.
Great idea. Do you,

1442
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:09,170
do you think you're going to transition
into promoting or managing or anything

1443
01:27:09,171 --> 01:27:13,340
or training when you're done? I
want to do any training. No. No,

1444
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,830
I don't think one of mine when
I around the corner in life,

1445
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:20,540
I ain't looking back Joe, if I, you know,
I finally made the corner I looking back,

1446
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:24,140
but I'll definitely help these dudes
out, man. I'll figure it out with him,

1447
01:27:24,141 --> 01:27:27,290
her or whatever it may be. You know,
I have no desire to train people.

1448
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,330
People tell me I can teach very well.
I just don't agree. I don't know.

1449
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:38,210
Maybe it'd be something that'd be more
interesting to you when you're not

1450
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:42,190
competing. Right, exactly. You know, but
I'm hoping I'm moving into the movies.

1451
01:27:42,191 --> 01:27:45,950
I want to be a movie star. Yeah. Well
that sounds like fun. I just, uh, yeah,

1452
01:27:45,951 --> 01:27:48,860
I just did equalizer to Denzel Washington
was a lot of fun out of small part.

1453
01:27:49,090 --> 01:27:53,570
I am with the Dash brand x guys and
doing a lot of stunts and having fun with

1454
01:27:53,571 --> 01:27:58,160
that and I'm done. Zelle is great.

1455
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:05,120
Yeah. Great Dude. Great
Dude. Never met him.

1456
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:10,550
Yeah, he, uh, it was cool. It was super
cool to me. Super Nice. Um, this fun.

1457
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:12,830
Someone welcome, you know,
I worked in Blue Jay Heran,

1458
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,130
you know Jay these in that too. Yeah,
he's in that too as a cool, he's,

1459
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:20,180

in and uh, Jay fights him in a car.

1460
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,160
It's pretty cool.
I'm trying to cells,

1461
01:28:22,161 --> 01:28:24,500
one of the greatest doctors and
several absolutely. I agree with you.

1462
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:28,190
I understand you can go over like some
of the greatest actors that's ever lived.

1463
01:28:28,191 --> 01:28:29,690
You've got to have him on that list.

1464
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:35,180
Like you got a chance to work with one
of the all time greats and he's so cool

1465
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:37,310
as a Cadillac got there and he's just,
you know,

1466
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:41,240
is it weird to be working with them?
It kind of was, but he was real.

1467
01:28:41,241 --> 01:28:44,810
I mean onset watching den Dell and then
Denzel on set is kind of different.

1468
01:28:44,811 --> 01:28:49,520
But he, um, you know, a
lot of the, there's Jay.

1469
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:54,590
Oh man, that's cool.
Right? Um, it was fun man.

1470
01:28:54,591 --> 01:28:56,230
It was, it was such a learning
experience. But anyway,

1471
01:28:56,250 --> 01:29:00,290
I was here last week and I met
with Pete Berg who is a director.

1472
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:01,620
He just did that mile 22

1473
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:07,620
and I just got on a new Mark
Wahlberg movie, So I, uh,
got a small thing on that,

1474
01:29:07,621 --> 01:29:11,600
but um, he asked me to do
the fight choreograph for the
whole movie, so. Wow. Yeah.

1475
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:15,750
Pumped on it, man. I'm excited
working, working, working
with the guys. Doing that.

1476
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:20,610
So it should be fun to enjoy it. Love
it. It's cool. It's just another avenue.

1477
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:24,930
Yeah, no, there's something fun to do
now. That'd be a good transition for you.

1478
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:29,610
You know, so that's Kinda my plan.
Um, but last night over again,

I'm going to be a new race
car driver or that happened.

1481
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:38,700
My Buddy Ricky Stenhouse junior,
he has a dirt track race team.

1482
01:29:38,701 --> 01:29:42,840
So January, January, it's

Chili Chili Bowl.
300 300 injuries.

1484
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,210
And you take over five days you raised
and you work your way up to enter the

1485
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:53,310
Saturday night, the Chili Bowl and
you, you, you get down there, there,

1486
01:29:53,311 --> 01:29:58,230
these are 400 horsepower cars,
you know, and error. Excuse me.

1487
01:29:58,231 --> 01:30:00,960
They weigh 400 pounds, man. I don't know
what it is. I don't, I can't doubt like,

1488
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:04,640
I don't know. I don't know anything about
way more than 400 pounds right there.

1489
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:07,800
400 horsepower. I, by the
way, 900 pounds. Really? Yeah.

1490
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:11,310

bowl for 400 horsepower.

1492
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:19,200

And they just shit and get

1493
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:27,660

1495
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:36,270
Wow. How Fun. That sounds
like a good time. And I said,

1496
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:40,320
so is there like a couple warmup days
or practice or, yeah, here it is.

1497

Things look at this.
Whoa.

1498
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:49,740
A dirt. Oh my God. That is insane. So
he's just going sideways everywhere.

1499
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:53,130
Not just drinking. The whole thing
is like halfway drifting. Right?

1500
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:58,450
It's just so all those people going
completely sideways around these corners.

1501
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:03,360
That's hilarious. So in January, I,
Tulsa, Oklahoma. That's going to be me.

1502
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:08,370
Wow. I can't wait. It's
gonna be so fun. Wow.

1503
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,400
Those are good times. And I said, hey man,

1504
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,660
I want to tell you just because of
my ego, right? That I'm a good racer,

1505
01:31:15,661 --> 01:31:19,380
but I don't really know if I am a
freshman race go carts. I have for you.

1506
01:31:19,381 --> 01:31:21,810
If you want to go down to the local
gold cart, chuck, we'll give it hell.

1507
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:27,130
But I've ever done that. Never have so
excited you got to practice. I said,

1508
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:31,650
I said like, is there some warmup or a
practice day? And they said, no, you just,

1509
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:36,210
you can get a five laps before the
race. And I said, that's not enough. No,

1510
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:39,940
no. You need a couple of hours,
hours, days, couple of weeks,

1511
01:31:39,941 --> 01:31:43,260
someone to show you like where,
where do you in the apex the term,

1512
01:31:43,261 --> 01:31:45,690
when do I jump on the gas?
So what,

1513
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:50,820
so fast forward to January, Calvin's
going to have five labs to fucking get it.

1514
01:31:50,821 --> 01:31:54,730
And then I'm on, is there a place you
can go practice? I guess you can. Yeah,

1515
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:57,960
I have to rent a track.
And I was at the monster thing last night,

1516
01:31:57,961 --> 01:32:00,130
so I was talking with all the,
all the right. And they're

1517
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,380
like, no, we don't practice. We just
race. I think we just graced your rates.

1518
01:32:03,381 --> 01:32:06,880
There's no practice. And I was like, Huh,

1519
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:09,970
you don't let you just race. Okay. Uh,

1520
01:32:09,971 --> 01:32:14,110
so can I pick up one of these car? Y'All
got a lot, like a loner I can get in.

1521
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:17,800
And they're like, yeah, we
got you. And you show up. So
Chili bowl has got to like,

1522
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:20,080
I guess there's 300
injuries is over five days.

1523
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:24,370
You just get after it is Christ.

1524
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:28,690
It was all excited. It seems like
that would be a skill though.

1525
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,030
Like going sideways in the dirt like that.

1526
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:34,690
You would have to learn how to scale that.
I don't have no,

1527
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:38,560
they're gonna let you race with
pros. Yeah, that seems silly.

1528
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:39,760
That seems like jumping into,

1529
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:44,980
seems like it's going to Jackson right
off the street slapping on some Shin

1530
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:50,470
Pads. It's exactly what the
fuck's happening. That is
so crazy. So yeah. Are you,

1531
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:54,220
are you mother buggers and dose all
Oklahoma and January charitable cow is

1532
01:32:54,221 --> 01:32:58,920
coming in hot hot sun energy on me.

1533
01:32:58,921 --> 01:33:00,670
I get to pick a number.
I don't know what number to pick.

1534
01:33:00,671 --> 01:33:03,850
You get to pick a number and then you'd
pick a s a letters behind the number.

1535
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:05,590
Wow.
I need to,

1536
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,920
I need a good number followed by BMF
cause I definitely need that. Right.

1537
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:12,040
What would be a good number for you?
I don't know.

1538
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:14,170
Would it be the year of
your first pro fight?

1539
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:15,560
Okay.

1540
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,130
Would it be the year your grandparents
bought you the ranch? Who,

1541
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,120
that's not a bad one. You
have to be weighed. What
year would that, what's here?

1542
01:33:23,121 --> 01:33:27,890
Is that I think 2011 11
BMF sounds pretty fun.

1543
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:32,750
Learn DNF it. That sounds pretty
good. 11 BMF, that sounds pretty good,

1544
01:33:33,290 --> 01:33:37,530
right? Yeah. Fuck yeah.
I'm gonna send you videos.

1545
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:40,340
You'll be able to play it and you're
like, man, that's not a bad one.

1546
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:46,490
Love and BMF is good. Liam.
11 BMF. Hence it's the ranch.

1547
01:33:46,491 --> 01:33:50,630
Why not have it the birth date
of the ranch? Yes. Accurate.

1548
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:54,870
You know, there it is. There it is.

1549
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:59,960
Probably 311 on this mother fucker.

1550
01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:04,250
I'm putting in the wall coming sideways
around that corner and very little

1551
01:34:04,251 --> 01:34:06,530
control over the bed.
Almost no control.

1552
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:10,040
And if you think you want to see me
down in the pits and come and take your

1553
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:13,340
helmet off and get crazy, she just
going down. What other shitty you doing?

1554
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:16,670
That's ridiculous. You probably shouldn't
be doing mounted, mounted, shooting.

1555
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:20,690
I'm out shooting on a horse on a horse.
Do you put earmuffs on the horse? Yes,

1556
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:24,560
of course. Really? Yeah. Stuff.
I'm down in her ears. Wow.

1557
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:30,020
What kind of rifle? Shooting Colt
45 oh my God. That's hilarious.

1558
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:34,220
Yeah.
So here's the rules.

1559
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,870
You can't have more ammunition
than targets are on,

1560
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,920
on the field, right? So
there's 10 targets targets.

1561
01:34:42,921 --> 01:34:45,440
So we load five shots in each six shooter.

1562
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,290
Wow.
Right?

1563
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:53,291
And you show your has to be a gun
exchange while riding full speed shooting

1564
01:34:54,111 --> 01:34:58,080
targets. So you, she one handed
while hold it on with the other hand.

1565
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,160
Yeah, no, no, no. I'm a right handed.

1566
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:03,350
So I run the range on my left
and I shoot with my right.

1567
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,390
So here it is right here.
This is it.

1568
01:35:05,391 --> 01:35:09,950
So on hand is where you'd chew on hand
offhand is when you put it over over your

1569
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:13,880
arm. So this is often cray, this some
cowboys and that's it right there.

1570
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:18,520
Oh look at this. You run around and
shoot balloon. That is hilarious. Right?

1571
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:23,530
These people in the stands,
it'll let you shoot the fucking

1572
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:29,990
talking about people. That
data pull is not live.

1573
01:35:29,991 --> 01:35:33,050
And you mentioned you're just
shooting black blanks. Oh yeah.

1574
01:35:33,051 --> 01:35:34,910
So just the gunpowder
is burning the balloons.

1575
01:35:34,911 --> 01:35:38,770
Isn't that crazy that just the blanks
can do that much goddamn lunch.

1576
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:43,970
There's a guy in Hollywood when I first
came here and like 94 who was on a set

1577
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:47,330
and he didn't know that and he thought
it'd be funny to put a blanket up to his

1578
01:35:47,331 --> 01:35:50,120
head and shoot himself the head.
Yes. Some people shoot themselves,

1579
01:35:50,121 --> 01:35:50,841
shoot the horse.

1580
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:52,910
I mean you shoot your horse doing and
he's probably not going to want to do it

1581
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:57,170
anymore. What the fuck? Yeah,
they think that it's just a noise.

1582
01:35:57,171 --> 01:36:02,000
It's not just the noise. So learning,
learning and getting your horse training,

1583
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:06,830
getting around gunfire and it's fun.
It's a good time.

1584
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,910
That's practicing for
some old school revivals.

1585
01:36:10,911 --> 01:36:13,900
It's called SAS single action
shooting society. And uh,

1586
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:18,240
once it was fights and during the
competitions and during the show is, it's,

1587
01:36:18,241 --> 01:36:20,130
it's like they,
they take it back and they,

1588
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:24,080
everyone dresses up and that's hilarious.
Those are still to this day,

1589
01:36:24,081 --> 01:36:26,170
my all time favorite movies,
like the unforgiven,

1590
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:29,870
C'mon westerns and some of the greatest
movies ever, ever. I'm with you.

1591
01:36:29,871 --> 01:36:31,940
I love him.
I love this stuff about them.

1592
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:35,660
It's like that's a short period
of of a United States history.

1593
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:39,290
But that's the period where people
were like, fuck it. Let's see,

1594
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:43,640
let's see what goes on over here. Let's
see the cross, this divide a weak guy.

1595
01:36:44,670 --> 01:36:47,770
Yeah, he mega diddy.
That's one area. If I, if,

1596
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:51,350
if there was a time machine that you
can go back and see what it was like,

1597
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:54,350
if you could only go once and
stay there and that was it.

1598
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:58,550
It was a one ticket ride. I ain't going,
no, no, it's the best time to live ever.

1599
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:02,700
They would all want to come here. Of
course. Fuck. Would I go back with no Dui,

1600
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:07,580
but you'd want to go to 3000
how do you know,

1601
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:10,820
hold on.
So now you say that,

1602
01:37:10,821 --> 01:37:14,910
but now how did the guy in six 80
know that 2018 and these guys? Well,

1603
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:19,970
they would have to know to know like
we know like if we went back to six 18

1604
01:37:19,971 --> 01:37:22,040
we're like listen,
what you'd go give them a little,

1605
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:23,660
here's this is a laptop you opened up.

1606
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:25,010
We have a thing called
Youtube and get on it.

1607
01:37:25,011 --> 01:37:27,980
And you just search and that's where
we live. So if you want to come there,

1608
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:31,400
I'll trade ya. That. They would,
they would trade in a heartbeat.

1609
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:34,340
But if you like wanted to go to the
future where everybody could read

1610
01:37:34,341 --> 01:37:38,690
everybody's minds and no one had Dixon
anymore because we all reproduced through

1611
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:41,240
[inaudible],
it'd be over

1612
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:45,890
orgasm button that's attached to this
helmet that you carry around with you

1613
01:37:45,891 --> 01:37:48,710
cause there's no more oxygen
on earth and everybody is

1614
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:55,230
free. The new gas.
That's way better. Yeah,

1615
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:58,680
I dunno man. I think right now it's
pretty fucking good. I'm happy with today.

1616
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:02,910
I like it. So No, no
era you'd go to eh? No.

1617
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:07,920
If I could come back, I'd go to like
1492 I think that'd be a good time.

1618
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:12,750
So it'd be like when they landed Columbus
and I'd be fucking wicked pirate.

1619
01:38:12,751 --> 01:38:15,660
I think I'd make a good pirate. You
definitely make, do a lot of homos though.

1620
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:20,530
Let's, no, no one mean they wasn't around
with that a lot. A lot of fires are gay.

1621
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:24,910
I would be on a boat.
The ungay firing, hiring,

1622
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:29,380
they're asleep. I mean, yeah, they'd
come me and I said, no, this is captain.

1623
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:32,830
Don't play it at homie.
You're iPad should be sleeping.

1624
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:40,000
Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. I would bring
the, I mean it makes sense, right?

1625
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:43,080
With the scarfs and the crazy earrings,
they're all gay.

1626
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:48,120
It makes sense in each other. That's
what they were doing, man. That's a fact.

1627
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:52,220
I'm not making that up. Fair enough.
Yeah. I think I'd go back to the gut.

1628
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,640
The Mongol days,
I looked to see gangs con.

1629
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:57,510
I like to see just what that would look
like when they would take over a city

1630
01:38:57,511 --> 01:39:01,200
and kill a million people and rape
and pillage like yeah, insane.

1631
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:04,350
They didn't have any respect for
anybody that didn't live in tents.

1632
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:07,470
That's how gangster those people,
they're like, you live in a house,

1633
01:39:07,471 --> 01:39:09,810
you fucking bitch. They didn't even
treat you like you're a person.

1634
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:13,470
I live in a tent with fire.
All they live felt tense everywhere.

1635
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:18,450
This took them everywhere. Nomadic
people. So that would be your one stop.

1636
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,120
I would like to see what that was
like. What did, what do you do?

1637
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:23,970
Go back and then if you
died you'd come back here.

1638
01:39:23,971 --> 01:39:28,610
So that'd be like if you weren't going
to be a place where I sword. Yeah. Yeah.

1639
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,630
There'll be a place where you can be
pretty assured that you're going to dog

1640
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:35,700
gang. Is Open arms welcoming you into
the clan? If I came back with it,

1641
01:39:35,701 --> 01:39:37,830
why don't you be? Yeah, what
would you be hot for? Sure.

1642
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:41,310
I got some shit to show for Zippo.

1643
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:46,430
I'd have to tell him about Dan Carlin's
wrath of the con audio series for them.

1644
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:48,210
You'd give a fuck so wrong.

1645
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,610
You give him a phone where there'd be
no satellite tower. So it would be,

1646
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:56,050
I would have to have some
recorded preloaded shit. Huh?

1647
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:58,110
Some videos and movies and stuff.
And what would you,

1648
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:03,120
where would you come in just in case
cause here or would you show up in like

1649
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:07,050
2018 thermal optical lens?

1650
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:11,370
Like you're like writing
riot police with low.

1651
01:40:11,371 --> 01:40:14,490
If I could bring anything I would
for sure be locked and loaded.

1652
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:18,810
I want guns strapped to my hips.
Knives fucking fully.

1653
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,630
If you show up with a gun to gang a con,

1654
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:25,530
you now become games con
she hit right in the Dick.

1655
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:30,510
All of a sudden you, he's not worth it
because you have fully automatic assault.

1656
01:40:30,511 --> 01:40:34,530
Write them on the roof.
Just started jacking that Predator style,

1657
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:37,200
the new sheriff in town,

1658
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:41,740
but for sure and then a movie like that.

1659
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:46,380
Wasn't that John Claude van Damme
time cop? Yeah, I remember that Shit.

1660
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:50,760
They went back in time and he
had a machine gun. Someone did.

1661
01:40:50,761 --> 01:40:53,950
They went back at Tom Fuck people
up and stole like civil war gold

1662
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:57,970
over that.
But just like the movies say,

1663
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:01,240
I think if you fucked that shit up,
you ruin everything you make it.

1664
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:04,840
You might be in there just mowing people
down with machine gun and then you

1665
01:41:04,841 --> 01:41:07,660
would just vanish. Be Gone.
Mom. What do you manage though?

1666
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:11,650
You'd have to write probably or
now that you're in this time,

1667
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:16,390
uh, do you, are you no
longer in our time? Yeah.

1668
01:41:16,391 --> 01:41:17,950
The timeline changes the,

1669
01:41:17,951 --> 01:41:21,270
because you're there now and you see
this guy's got fucking machine guns.

1670
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,410
Check this shit out.

1671
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:28,120
This is a pretty easy way to make
money of this word from booster.

1672
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:32,220
I'm from the future faggot there.

1673
01:41:34,290 --> 01:41:35,140
So that would be you.

1674
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:39,880
Meaning gang has gone and would you learn
a little bit of his language you think

1675
01:41:39,881 --> 01:41:41,990
or you just try and go in
there with your iPhone and

1676
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:49,180
the Internet? I think that the only way
you'd be able to communicate with them,

1677
01:41:49,181 --> 01:41:52,240
we would have to learn this language
for sure. That would be a little,

1678
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:53,620
how hard would it be to learn?

1679
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:56,680
Do they even know how to
say Mongo language anymore?

1680
01:41:57,250 --> 01:42:00,730
I don't think they even understand what
the, what the sounds were or think.

1681
01:42:00,731 --> 01:42:04,530
They're just guessing. I don't think they
eat on the side that go back grab one,

1682
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:07,720
bring him here. Yeah. You'd have
to have them to home teach you.

1683
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:11,470
I don't know if they know how
those people talk back then.

1684
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:17,110
I think there's some real
speculation because you'd be
so smart and know so much,

1685
01:42:17,111 --> 01:42:20,290
but you couldn't communicate.
Yeah, there's no like,

1686
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:24,160
it's not like going to Mexico now
where we kind of know a survey. So

1687
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:27,290
yeah,

1688
01:42:27,290 --> 01:42:32,020
we'll like to think that's what the
same with the Mayans and that was only a

1689
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:35,590
thousand years ago. We don't not, we
don't totally know how they were talking.

1690
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,510
There's a lot of the expectation,

1691
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:41,730
there's still translating a lot of those
ancient Mayan ruins and there's text

1692
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:45,900
and Ken Kuhn, that's where it like
to loom. Yeah. When I went into,

1693
01:42:45,980 --> 01:42:49,700
I went to Chichen it too, which
is three miles there once. Fuck.

1694
01:42:49,710 --> 01:42:53,170
Did you take the tour? Yeah, yeah.
We had a professor take us on a tour,

1695
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,970
so amazing ran.
They talk about

1696
01:42:56,770 --> 01:43:00,580
all the rituals and all the how they
drink out of the snow days and then they

1697
01:43:00,581 --> 01:43:05,530
tell me that how they'd cut their
testicles and I was like, wait, what?

1698
01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:09,880
And they're like, yeah, that's,
that's how the the the Sharman or the,

1699
01:43:09,881 --> 01:43:14,440
the grand master,
whatever the head religious guy,

1700
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:16,570
I don't know what I'm an
idiot when it comes to that.

1701
01:43:16,570 --> 01:43:19,660
But they knew through their very smart,
right.

1702
01:43:19,661 --> 01:43:22,300
They knew of astrology and he knew
when he clips it in what we're coming.

1703
01:43:22,301 --> 01:43:25,930
So he would wait for the
eclipse that come. Knowing,

1704
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:30,730
knowing that three minutes later and
it's going to just go ahead and pass.

1705
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:35,470
But all the people that were with him
had no idea. They didn't know, right?

1706
01:43:35,471 --> 01:43:37,870
They had no idea that
it was going to stop.

1707
01:43:37,871 --> 01:43:40,030
They thought they had
done something wrong.

1708
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:44,500
The gods are punished them with darkness.
So when the darkness comes, he like,

1709
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,490
cuts himself in, offers his
blood to the, to the Gods,

1710
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:53,240
moon, Sun comes back, all blood, Balboa,

1711
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:56,680
Balboa got some precious
blood, precious blood. And,

1712
01:43:56,920 --> 01:44:00,500
and at that moment I was like,
so wait a minute,

1713
01:44:00,501 --> 01:44:05,370
you were just tricking these people.
I've been tricked my whole life.

1714
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:09,750
I go to fucking church and I've
been tricked my entire life.

1715
01:44:09,751 --> 01:44:14,751
Like you just tell these people that
don't know enough and you knew the real,

1716
01:44:16,070 --> 01:44:19,710
but you told them it wasn't.
Wait a minute,

1717
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:25,240
what's going on here? Hmm.
I sat back and thought,

1718
01:44:25,241 --> 01:44:26,074
and I was like,

1719
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:29,860
so be it probably had to do what you gotta
do to control those people back then.

1720
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:34,750
It's Goddamn savages. Yeah. Show him. Show
him a little ball. So what about today?

1721
01:44:34,751 --> 01:44:38,360
We've got it. We got to playing
fucking games. Yeah. Condo balls,

1722
01:44:38,361 --> 01:44:41,880
balls look up control on the sun back
covered it with the moon bitch and

1723
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:46,180
everyone was like, oh my God, you brought
light back. Yeah. Otherwise no everything.

1724
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:50,020
And you have a machine gun.
You got a machine gun to pitch.

1725
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:52,660
But I only have three rounds.
So you couldn't,

1726
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:55,870
you couldn't get up there and
really you going to really,

1727
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:59,530
I mean unless you came armed up,
but how long would those bullets last?

1728
01:44:59,531 --> 01:45:01,650
Because there's no way you're
making a new bullet. Yeah,

1729
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:02,880
everybody has to see it too,

1730
01:45:02,881 --> 01:45:04,150
cause they're not going to
believe you don't have to shoot.

1731
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:09,150
Everybody wants you to feel me
being gone back to the Mayans.

1732
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:12,970
What are the guns I'm playing with today?
Look like? Yeah, no kidding, right?

1733
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:18,310
You fuck shit up.
Talk shut up for thousands of years.

1734
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:21,400
That's the thing about guns though.
They get a little better over time,

1735
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:25,570
but you didn't have a gun from 10 years
ago and it's state of the art, I believe.

1736
01:45:25,571 --> 01:45:27,100
I believe those guys 10 years ago,

1737
01:45:27,130 --> 01:45:31,300
hundred years ago are built
better than the shit ones today.

1738
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:35,290
Then the shit ones. Yeah, but they still
make real good guns today too. Sure.

1739
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,240
But that's the thing. The
thing is like, it's weird,

1740
01:45:37,241 --> 01:45:41,080
the technology of guns has sort of
in like, like you don't need it.

1741
01:45:41,081 --> 01:45:44,860
Like with Bose, one of the things
about compound bows is people,

1742
01:45:44,861 --> 01:45:48,910
a lot of people want to know the new
models every year because they get better.

1743
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:52,630
Sure. But they don't really,
guns don't get that much better.

1744
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:55,250
Like a gun from 10 years
ago is still a bad ass gun.

1745
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:57,660
Like I have a bunch of Henry Rifles,
right.

1746
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:00,550
The Henry rifle from nine from years,

1747
01:46:00,551 --> 01:46:03,580
it all American made from
years ago to the same gun.

1748
01:46:03,581 --> 01:46:08,350
They say now it's the same
gun. Yeah. Yeah. They nailed
it. Nailed. Got It. Got It.

1749
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:12,400
Yeah. But it's, yeah. So I
wonder how much innovation is,

1750
01:46:12,670 --> 01:46:16,420
how much room for it until
we started doing laser shit.
Like different, you know,

1751
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,730
I mean they got it. They
got to, they got to ramp.

1752
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:23,650
It always drives me crazy about lasers,
like a star wars type shit.

1753
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:26,500
How come I could see him?
How come I could see him?

1754
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,510
Because there's clearly fogging around.
You didn't see him moving too slow.

1755
01:46:30,530 --> 01:46:35,500
Delights air, they hit. The bullets
are so much faster than lasers.

1756
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:38,860
You see him to joke, joke, joke,
joke. Maybe it's that long of a shot.

1757
01:46:38,861 --> 01:46:43,090
Maybe their bullet is that
long. I think a late, oh,

1758
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:47,950
LIGO flying lightsaber. Yeah.
Oh, I never thought about that.

1759
01:46:47,951 --> 01:46:50,520
We're sending big laser beam.

1760
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:55,140
Right. Okay. Not other than that he hit
you, but it just keeps going. Right.

1761
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:57,880
I didn't think about it that way.
Like you're shooting like,

1762
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:01,660
like crossbow bolts of laser. Yes. Ooh.

1763
01:47:01,890 --> 01:47:06,450
Burning hot as a laser hot.
It's gotta be right as a cold.

1764
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:07,980
There are cold lasers.
I had,

1765
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:11,100
I had a bulging disc once
and I went to this therapist.

1766
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:15,270
They put cold laser on it.
I Dunno,

1767
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,210
but I liked this idea that she could
come back two more times this week and

1768
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:21,100
we'll get you in. They just
kept doing it wasn't, yeah,

1769
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:25,740
I don't think it really works,
but, but the cold bursts,

1770
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:31,020
I think the laser person, if it was like
that, like flying lightsabers. Holy Shit.

1771
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:35,210
Yeah, it's at the, I think the bolts were
just huge until you let off the trigger.

1772
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,083
Still too slow.

1773
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:39,990
See if you can find like a scene from
star wars one with the shooting at each

1774
01:47:39,991 --> 01:47:44,580
other. Those bitches, it's slower than an
arrow. Like they're not moving that fast.

1775
01:47:44,581 --> 01:47:48,870
Like if you try to watch an arrow coming
from a compound bow blogger to follow

1776
01:47:48,871 --> 01:47:53,250
so you couldn't catch it. Yeah,
no chance. No chance, no chance.

1777
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:58,280
No 280 feet a second, no cheese
and catching shit. But that,

1778
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:02,310
those, those bolts from those
laser guns look slower than that.

1779
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:05,370
And you're probably right. You wouldn't,
the new, the new laser, you wouldn't,

1780
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:07,490
there's no way you see it.
You wouldn't see shit.

1781
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:10,470
That's just the magical for a
movies and you see it coming.

1782
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,900
But it just makes me feel like they
think I'm an asshole. So when you,

1783
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:16,230
when you take this time travel,
so if you could go forward or back,

1784
01:48:16,231 --> 01:48:20,830
you would go back 100% I would
too. Yeah, I would too. Well,

1785
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:24,030
I'm a human. I don't think
there's a good future for humans.

1786
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:26,940
I think we're going to be
something different. So you
think if you shoot forward,

1787
01:48:26,941 --> 01:48:29,520
you might be the only one in there.
Yeah, there might be no more people.

1788
01:48:29,521 --> 01:48:33,330
Everybody's an engineer in a cage
getting probed. Oh, for sure.

1789
01:48:33,331 --> 01:48:35,790
They're going to test you.
I can't believe we found one of these.

1790
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:40,680
It's like a Tasmanian Tiger or something
like that. Like holy fuck. Lock it up.

1791
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:45,120
Look at
the video of the last Tasmanian Tiger.

1792
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:51,180
Jamie. See if you can find a video of
the last Tasmanian Tiger died in a zoo.

1793
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:55,230
I want to say in like 1930.
What's interesting is they
think they're still alive,

1794
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:59,910
but Australia is so big. Australia is as
big as the United States. There it is.

1795
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:04,920
That's a Tasmanian tiger.
That was the last bus drives.
It's a Marsupial Predator.

1796
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,530
It's the last um,

1797
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:12,210
like real mammal Predator or Marsupial
Predator that lived in Australia.

1798
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:16,920
That's what it was like. It
was like a crazy dog looking
thing. But they've found,

1799
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:18,960
look at that,
the mouth open picture of it.

1800
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:21,930
Look at that fucking mouth on that thing.
That is crazy.

1801
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:27,420
But there are people that
are real reasonable people
that believe that there's

1802
01:49:27,421 --> 01:49:29,260
still a few of those
that exist in the wild.

1803
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:32,700
It's been enough sightings of these
things that they think that, uh,

1804
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:35,100
what is the actual name of that thing?
It's got a crazy name.

1805
01:49:36,990 --> 01:49:41,910
Cicilline right. How does it spell t,

1806
01:49:41,911 --> 01:49:46,560
h y, c e. L. I. N. A.
Thylacine, whatever it is.

1807
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:50,770
That would be us being one of those
fucking cage is the last person just

1808
01:49:50,771 --> 01:49:54,870
wandering around, looking around
stupid. All the robots are all,

1809
01:49:54,871 --> 01:49:57,250
so if you could bring one person,
hmm,

1810
01:49:57,310 --> 01:49:59,920
would you bring a best friend or
would you bring a female counter?

1811
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:04,750
You've got to bring a check, bro. Goddie
right. You got it. Yeah. Yeah. You got it.

1812
01:50:05,710 --> 01:50:09,460
I'm with Ya. Because you wanna bring
your friend like drought. Look, I love,

1813
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,240
I love to hang out with you,
but you know,

1814
01:50:13,210 --> 01:50:18,210
I don't want to be the last guy in
a cane in China without some pussy.

1815
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:23,230
No, no, no. Yeah, that would be, yeah,

1816
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:26,380
but if I was a pirate then, you
know, I guess it wouldn't be okay.

1817
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:29,110
What was the gay cowboy movie? What
was that movie? Brokeback yeah,

1818
01:50:29,111 --> 01:50:33,590
we ain't going there. And how we ain't
going, man, we are not going there.

1819
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:38,590
A little too intense for this
fierce that shall not be conquered.

1820
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:46,990
No disrespect to the gay friends out
there listening. Cheers to you. Hey,

1821
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:49,800
cheers to you. Hmm. Mm.

1822
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,400
I would definitely go in the past just
to see what it was like an ancient Egypt

1823
01:50:54,401 --> 01:50:56,680
or ancient Rome. I mean, uh,

1824
01:50:56,710 --> 01:51:01,390
I just got back from Italy and we were,
uh, we checked out Pompei of course,

1825
01:51:01,391 --> 01:51:01,661
you know,

1826
01:51:01,661 --> 01:51:04,750
and you wandering around where all
these people died almost instantly from

1827
01:51:04,751 --> 01:51:07,300
volcanic ash 20 feet
high and you see other,

1828
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:10,120
you saw it right away and you can see the,

1829
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:14,800
there's one where they found recently
where a dude got hit in the head by a

1830
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:15,880
flying boulder.

1831
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:19,840
He just see his skeleton and a
giant rock where his head would be.

1832
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:24,470
It's a way to go. Yeah. I mean
I got nothing though. Boom.

1833
01:51:24,471 --> 01:51:28,090
Done blackness,
DMT world DMTs out where we go.

1834
01:51:28,091 --> 01:51:29,680
You think maybe there is,

1835
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:34,220
look at that and that's why you
seeing not kinda got him. Oh God.

1836
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,510
At that look at the article
cause it says Fuck Paul pay,

1837
01:51:38,670 --> 01:51:42,130
but fuck this man in particular, man. God

1838
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:47,040
was blowing from the mountain.
Yup.

1839
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:51,970
Big Chunks of rock that gets
spewed out of this volcano. Wow.

1840
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,580
Yeah. The whole thing's
crazy. Like when you're,

1841
01:51:54,581 --> 01:51:59,581
when you're wandering around Pompei and
just realize that each face forward you

1842
01:52:00,791 --> 01:52:05,440
got hit in a mug. Right? Like
he saw it. Ah, right. Yeah.

1843
01:52:05,470 --> 01:52:09,280
He got, yeah, it's true. I didn't even
write that. He didn't, he wasn't running.

1844
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:12,850
Oh look at that one man.
That was fucked.

1845
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:18,100
Is that just volcanic ash modification
just preserved with volcanic ash.

1846
01:52:18,101 --> 01:52:22,950
Look at its teeth. That is
sane and if spooky, I'm dead.

1847
01:52:22,990 --> 01:52:25,900
This, this guy is coming
on my next trip for sure.

1848
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:29,500
Show up.
Just show up.

1849
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,650
Fuck. That is the way
to go. Fall. Kainos men.

1850
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:42,130
I have a friend who goes to the big
island every year for Thanksgiving and I'm

1851
01:52:42,131 --> 01:52:45,920
like, you going back? He's
like, fuck yeah. I'm like,
you're crazy. You're going by.

1852
01:52:45,921 --> 01:52:47,270
That thing's on fire.

1853
01:52:47,370 --> 01:52:52,280
I would have it splits in half and
sprays out like it's, it's taken over.

1854
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:56,870
Then the gods we've made the gods mad.
Palae was pissed.

1855
01:52:57,850 --> 01:53:01,250
What? What area did you do? Do
you think you go to the wild west?

1856
01:53:01,251 --> 01:53:06,020
Where do you think you would go? Oh,
I was, I around it towards pirates,

1857
01:53:06,021 --> 01:53:10,220
but then you surely whip shot me
back. So yeah, we'd probably be,

1858
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:14,480
how about Lewis and Clark? If you could
go on a Lewis and Clark expedition,

1859
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:18,590
how wow would that be?
Make your way across the unknown.

1860
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:23,000
No one knew what the fuck. What
the fuck? Just taking a chance.

1861
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,260
Try to walk across the United
States. I mean that's, that's,

1862
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,630
that's almost as you're saying,
the same era.

1863
01:53:29,631 --> 01:53:31,520
I wanted to go and Columbus just
trying to like, you know what?

1864
01:53:31,521 --> 01:53:36,330
Let's just say Lacrosse is flat.
Earth. Yeah. Yeah. Now it wasn't flat.

1865
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:37,580
Now we're back to flat.

1866
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:42,850
Some people we discovered it wasn't flat
and now we're back to flat and I have

1867
01:53:42,851 --> 01:53:46,940
value and people want you to while
doing the pilot school that I'm in.

1868
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:52,040
Like you have to keep adjusting for
the curvature of the earth. No, no,

1869
01:53:52,041 --> 01:53:56,330
no. It's not real. It's not real. The
world's flat. It's flat. I like that TV.

1870
01:53:58,370 --> 01:54:00,380
It's just a lack of education.
It's,

1871
01:54:00,650 --> 01:54:03,890
it's an interesting thing too because
it shows you how distracted people are,

1872
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:06,350
but that they want to argue about
something that's already been figured out.

1873
01:54:06,351 --> 01:54:11,351
Videos and the literature that
people come up with for these insane,

1874
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:14,330
I can you Google earth
you want by the time,

1875
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:18,320
by the time it's done,
you're like,

1876
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:21,080
God damn.
It might be flat

1877
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:29,150
and they're going to put this in the
video. Cowboy realizes the earth is flat.

1878
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:32,920
He had a lot of good points there.
Yeah.

1879
01:54:32,930 --> 01:54:37,040
He's not sitting across from Neil degrasse
Tyson because if he was Neil degrasse

1880
01:54:37,041 --> 01:54:41,300
Tyson, but like hold on, hold on. That's
not how it works. Hold on. That's wrong.

1881
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:44,300
Hold on. This is why we know that's
incorrect. See, I don't have,

1882
01:54:44,301 --> 01:54:47,330
I don't have the knowledge
to be able to check,

1883
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:50,510
constantly readjust for
the curvature of the earth.

1884
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:54,890
I know that one fact and then and then
the rest of them they're like, and then,

1885
01:54:54,891 --> 01:54:59,680
and then I'm like the crazy
ones. The water. Yeah.

1886
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:04,610
Water. Water doesn't stay
on a curve. Yes. Does does.

1887
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:06,290
Yes it does. It does. Gravity.

1888
01:55:06,291 --> 01:55:10,250
It's called the oceans
and if gravity's not real,

1889
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:14,270
where the fuck do you think waves come
from bitch there and what did they say?

1890
01:55:14,271 --> 01:55:18,190
There's a glacier all
around. Holding? Yes. Yeah,

1891
01:55:18,210 --> 01:55:19,610
the 700 foot walls,

1892
01:55:19,630 --> 01:55:23,120
an ice wall around the outside edge and
then the government protects the ice

1893
01:55:23,121 --> 01:55:28,100
wall when you see it. Why? Why would
they? Why? Okay. This is just me.

1894
01:55:28,410 --> 01:55:31,070
I'm nobody.
I'm just Joe blow reading an article.

1895
01:55:31,071 --> 01:55:35,840
Why would NASA and the government's
been millions, billions. Trillions,

1896
01:55:35,841 --> 01:55:39,560
right? To protect the fact
that it's around earth.

1897
01:55:39,561 --> 01:55:42,650
When it's flat to me, I would say, oh,

1898
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:44,580
we live on a flat earth.

1899
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:48,350
This is where it gets even stupider
because how would it affect my day to day?

1900
01:55:48,430 --> 01:55:53,430
They're trying to protect us from the
truth or shield the truth from us that we

1901
01:55:53,461 --> 01:55:55,740
live in an incredible special environment.

1902
01:55:56,010 --> 01:55:58,800
We live in the firmament
that's protected by a dome.

1903
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:03,720
The creator is real and that all the
elite powers want to keep this information

1904
01:56:03,721 --> 01:56:08,220
from you. It's basically people that don't
have an education, that are failures,

1905
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:12,600
that use all their energy misplaced to
make these videos that don't make any

1906
01:56:12,601 --> 01:56:15,090
sense. They've figured
it out, they make sense.

1907
01:56:15,091 --> 01:56:18,470
They make sense to me on
the dummy that watch it.

1908
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:22,980
Like because anyone making a video
where no one's interrupting you,

1909
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:24,780
no one's telling you you're incorrect,

1910
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:28,740
you're allowed to just continue to watch
bullshit things over and over and over

1911
01:56:28,741 --> 01:56:29,610
again unchecked.

1912
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:33,270
And so if you listen to this and they
use big words and it sounds smooth,

1913
01:56:33,271 --> 01:56:37,290
they have for, they have, you know,
your drawing is behind them and charts.

1914
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:42,060
And I'm like, clearly that picture shows,
I definitely don't have degrees there.

1915
01:56:42,061 --> 01:56:45,120
Ain't nobody with a degree out there
that's telling you there's a nice wall.

1916
01:56:45,150 --> 01:56:47,880
I don't know man. You can get some
pretty shiny degrees lately. Well,

1917
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:51,510
there was an article recently about
schizophrenia and I think anybody that

1918
01:56:51,511 --> 01:56:54,030
thinks is really the ice
wall and they have a degree,

1919
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:55,380
they should probably go to a doctor.

1920
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:58,080
They're probably on some sort of
medication and something's wrong.

1921
01:56:58,110 --> 01:57:00,360
There's some sort of a de levels are off.

1922
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:03,510
There's really think there's
an ice wall around a plate.

1923
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:07,020
The earth shaped like a plate.
So are they just pumping?

1924
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:11,790
They're just pumping oxygen in or our
natural habitat creates it and they

1925
01:57:11,791 --> 01:57:15,780
believe that, uh, that's a good
question. They don't believe in gravity.

1926
01:57:15,810 --> 01:57:18,990
So I don't know what they believe in.
They think that I've ever,

1927
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:20,430
what happens when you're sending rockets?

1928
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:24,870
It hits the dose or I'll fake bro
rockets or fake satellites and fake,

1929
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:28,890
you know what else is fake dinosaurs?
They don't believe in dinosaurs.

1930
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:32,040
But you want to know, show
me Jamie. We just fake to,

1931
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:38,020
we just saw the mummy from
the fuck Kanick. Yeah, right.

1932
01:57:38,021 --> 01:57:42,510
And she fake. He's real. It might be
fake. Looked at a picture on Google.

1933
01:57:42,830 --> 01:57:45,560
We really [inaudible] he's real.

1934
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:48,510
The dude who got hit in the head
with a rock is real as real as fuck.

1935
01:57:48,511 --> 01:57:53,370
So the dinosaur that he got hit by a rock,
he's fake.

1936
01:57:53,371 --> 01:57:57,300
It could be, I wasn't there 65
million years ago is a long time.

1937
01:57:58,140 --> 01:58:00,900
Yeah.
Especially with the only 6,000 years old.

1938
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:04,500
They have one thing on their side and
this is the one thing that they are on

1939
01:58:04,501 --> 01:58:06,750
their side. This is one of the
reasons why they make this argument.

1940
01:58:06,751 --> 01:58:10,170
It's because when dinosaur
bones were first discovered,

1941
01:58:10,171 --> 01:58:11,100
when they were first discovered,

1942
01:58:11,101 --> 01:58:15,300
there was a whole race to find dinosaur
bones and there was a lot of fuckery.

1943
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:20,480
There was a bunch of people that were
faking things and piecing things together.

1944
01:58:20,481 --> 01:58:24,330
It didn't work and hiding bones
and saying they found them.

1945
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:27,120
They were just trying to
make a name for themselves,

1946
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:31,470
but that's just greedy human nature in
the face of an actual real discovery.

1947
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:35,220
That's very valuable.
That discovery was that they're dinosaurs,

1948
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:39,660
that there was a gigantic breed of lizards
that Rome has millions of years ago.

1949
01:58:39,970 --> 01:58:42,490
Yeah.
And so all that's just propaganda.

1950
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:46,990
So you're saying in in Colorado on
the side of the mountain by red rocks,

1951
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:50,770
they have a whole closed off section
where they're just doing masturbations.

1952
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:55,440
Yeah, Andy's a huge giant
feet print in that. Yeah.

1953
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:58,150
In the rock that you can go
up and touch a different,

1954
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:02,440
probably four or five different
species of Badass lizards.

1955
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:04,000
My friend John,
he's,

1956
01:59:04,001 --> 01:59:09,001
he knows a dude who owns a
ranch in Montana and they
found a t rex on this guy's

1957
01:59:09,491 --> 01:59:12,520
ranch. They pull the t rex
out of this guy's ranch.

1958
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:15,970
They found it in the ground and they
gave him a fuck load of money for it.

1959
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:18,730
I was like, if they find some
sort of discovery like that,

1960
01:59:18,731 --> 01:59:23,270
that's worth $1 million. Has to be.
Yeah. It has to put that's fake. No,

1961
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:24,730
it's real as fuck.
That's what I'm saying.

1962
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:29,760
They found this one thing that was
poking up and he brought in these geology

1963
01:59:29,810 --> 01:59:31,570
archaeologist. What? What would they be?

1964
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:36,460
All but it took you tell him you wouldn't
have a t rex to hang on and keep one,

1965
01:59:36,461 --> 01:59:39,640
two, one. Two is a person who
searches for dinosaur bones.

1966
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:42,190
Like you have a bear tooth hanging.
I have a fucking t.

1967
01:59:42,191 --> 01:59:45,980
Rex tooth is an archaeologist.
Right.

1968
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:50,410
I was thinking to archaeology being
human history. No archeology is what?

1969
01:59:50,411 --> 01:59:51,820
Your wife Paleontology.

1970
01:59:51,850 --> 01:59:53,770
That's what they do because
they're always digging up old shit.

1971
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:07,940
Oh, that's so true. So true.
True. They come at you, his ship

1972
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:14,770
get her a web.
Oh yeah.

1973
02:00:14,771 --> 02:00:16,390
Paleontologist.
Yeah.

1974
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:19,990
So they called it a paleontologist
paleontologist start cleaning off whatever

1975
02:00:19,991 --> 02:00:23,380
this was, and then he's
like, holy fuck. He's like,

1976
02:00:23,381 --> 02:00:28,360
this is a Goddamn t rex. Apparently.
It's like, Oh, a lot of it, you know,

1977
02:00:28,361 --> 02:00:30,430
sometimes it's like you only
found a couple of phones. Yeah,

1978
02:00:30,630 --> 02:00:34,870
they found a lot of shit.
So I would like to see that man,

1979
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:38,540
if I could go back when I'm drastic parks.
So now

1980
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:43,390
I'd like to see that too. Now we're
going all the way back. Yeah, that's,

1981
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:47,710
that's Colorado right there.
That is fucking insane. Insane.

1982
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:52,300
So what the fuck? That is insane. Yeah.

1983
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:55,010
Do you know how much time that
would take to, to falsify that?

1984
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:57,080
They going out with dessert.
Here's,

1985
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:00,220
so you've got to brainwash
five people and tell them more.

1986
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:05,560
Warren and do is wrangle chip this rock
out because we've got to fucking fake a

1987
02:01:05,981 --> 02:01:08,720
bunch of people. Have you seen this
in person? Yeah, I've been there.

1988
02:01:08,750 --> 02:01:12,360
Walked all that. You crawl over it? You
just like walk on, walk on, walk on it.

1989
02:01:12,580 --> 02:01:15,820
Well she a little gate right there
if you back out a little bit. Yeah,

1990
02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:20,800
a little gate, but that's just a
little gate. There it is right there.

1991
02:01:20,801 --> 02:01:23,410
The little girl.
That's crazy man.

1992
02:01:23,650 --> 02:01:28,330
I mean that's right there in Colorado.
Wow. Right by red rock. Yeah,

1993
02:01:28,331 --> 02:01:32,050
exactly. It's right there. It's hard
to book a Gig and red rocks, man.

1994
02:01:32,230 --> 02:01:37,230
They're booked up til like 2021 22
you can do a live show in red rock.

1995
02:01:38,231 --> 02:01:40,070
Fucking epic. I was
trying, but I can only get

1996
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,960
like Tuesday nights and Wednesday nights
up until I know what? Tuesday night,

1997
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:48,770
Tuesday night is better than
never. Never. No night. Yeah.

1998
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:52,510
Fucking so I'm going to
need a couple of tickets.

1999
02:01:56,400 --> 02:02:01,400
So the people don't believe the earth is
the believe the earth is flat and I'll

2000
02:02:01,641 --> 02:02:03,200
round.
They don't believe in dinosaurs.

2001
02:02:03,201 --> 02:02:05,970
They don't believe in nuclear weapons
either. Wow. That's the other one.

2002
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:08,300
Nuclear weapons are a hoax hoax.
Yeah.

2003
02:02:08,301 --> 02:02:10,490
Only a few people don't
believe Australia is a hoax.

2004
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:12,810
And a lot of people say that's
disinflation and discredit

2005
02:02:14,620 --> 02:02:17,100
plane fly upside down and shit.
And that's all upside down.

2006
02:02:17,101 --> 02:02:18,920
And that's where the
Australians coming from.

2007
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:22,950
Cause Kyle notes in Australia right
now. I could probably call him. Um,

2008
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:26,560
he's probably a government agent bro.
Shit,

2009
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:29,780
any phone call you make to him was
just going straight to the Illuminati.

2010
02:02:31,450 --> 02:02:35,330
Kyle. Yeah Bro. Yeah. You
gotta be real careful.

2011
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:39,470
What does he do? Is he
retired now? He's coming back.

2012
02:02:39,471 --> 02:02:42,330
He's trying to come back really well
the problem is he didn't fight. He,

2013
02:02:42,331 --> 02:02:46,070
his UFC career out, uh, when he retired.

2014
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:48,360
So we'll still have them under
contract under the contract.

2015
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:50,970
How many more fights don't,
didn't get into that.

2016
02:02:50,980 --> 02:02:52,520
So you wanted to retire
and fight somewhere else?

2017
02:02:52,730 --> 02:02:53,690
I think he just wanted to retire,

2018
02:02:53,691 --> 02:02:57,230
but now he's got the itch again cause
each comes, she's like, yeah, fuck it.

2019
02:02:57,231 --> 02:03:01,600
I'll come back to maybe
whatever. And they're like, no,

2020
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:06,410
you come back with us
or are you going to come back at all?

2021
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:10,790
Gotcha.
Contact legal agreements.

2022
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:15,830
Tricky world we live in and I figure if
he was a government agent he could just

2023
02:03:15,831 --> 02:03:17,120
sweep that under the rug.
Right.

2024
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:19,400
You have a tendency to
obvious as far as the cover,

2025
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:21,500
part of the cover is you get
a blocked in the contract.

2026
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,780
So he's becomes one of the regular
working man. He is a working man.

2027
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:27,470
I can say to you, damn standing dot
goddamn contract and you're like,

2028
02:03:27,471 --> 02:03:29,900
you're one of us Kyle.
Meanwhile he's wearing a wire.

2029
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:34,160
Damn Damn.

2030
02:03:34,161 --> 02:03:36,050
Yukon is the worth flat Kyle.

2031
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:41,330
It's definitely not to say water world.

2032
02:03:41,331 --> 02:03:42,410
Antidoping agency

2033
02:03:45,970 --> 02:03:50,480
wallet. Let's watch her.
The water's upside down.

2034
02:03:50,481 --> 02:03:54,860
My mom. Yeah. Yeah.

2035
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:59,450
There are a different breed of
human over there. They just,

2036
02:03:59,451 --> 02:04:03,540
they evolved for hunting because
they're prisoners. We just,

2037
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:07,650
what a great idea. Bring them to the
best place on earth and drop them.

2038
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:13,370
But the stupid, yes. Wait,

2039
02:04:14,130 --> 02:04:17,630
I don't have the, I'm not getting the
debt. Oh, you're just dropped me on.

2040
02:04:17,631 --> 02:04:20,870
It's super bad ass island.
That's bigger than the one you're on.

2041
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:25,520
Bigger than when you were on way better
weather. Way better weather. Gorgeous.

2042
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:28,730
And then they dropped all these
prisoners off and they started like crazy

2043
02:04:28,731 --> 02:04:33,360
hierarchy. And the ones that didn't really
make it just went into the bush. Yeah,

2044
02:04:33,660 --> 02:04:34,820
they're still there today.

2045
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:38,010
And then there's the aborigines who
were already there and then on top of

2046
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,210
that hot chicks,

2047
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:42,000
I don't know what they did to grow
them hot out there in Australia.

2048
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:45,380
Something about the,
the prisoner genes,

2049
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:47,730
the wild prisoner genetics,

2050
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:54,880
some about that wild
fucking criminal gene.

2051
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:59,640
While criminal dreams are are the,
are the crazy alpha male guys,

2052
02:05:00,130 --> 02:05:05,010
the guys that are there like
the weaker 2018 liberals

2053
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:10,470
are saying, whoa, no,
you can't do that. Yeah.

2054
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:13,440
Was a lot of that troll going on to the,
can't do that.

2055
02:05:13,441 --> 02:05:18,360
So you're going to Australia? Yeah.
Use the word faggot users faggot. Damn.

2056
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:21,000
That's one of the last words

2057
02:05:23,950 --> 02:05:26,970
I got in trouble with EOC for saying
faggot. I'm not allowed to say it anymore.

2058
02:05:26,990 --> 02:05:31,850
Well you already just did. I know you're
just making the noise. Yeah, this is,

2059
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:35,370
this is like a, this is like a
shell. We're in a bubble. Okay.

2060
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:39,870
So did they,
it's Vegas.

2061
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:43,830
I'm drinking all night and they had
me do this show at 8:00 AM on a Sunday

2062
02:05:43,831 --> 02:05:46,020
morning to reflect the fight.

2063
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:51,020
It was me and I'm a cm punk and I'm
reflecting the fight that DC had with

2064
02:05:52,740 --> 02:05:56,790
Anderson Silva, who I respect.
Appreciate. Great Dude.

2065
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:02,320
I didn't like the way DC fought that
fight. So when somebody asks you about it,

2066
02:06:02,330 --> 02:06:05,170
I said if anyone out there like a
fucking faggot and held him, you know,

2067
02:06:06,290 --> 02:06:10,920
he didn't fight to win. Right. Well
that was completely out of context.

2068
02:06:10,921 --> 02:06:14,880
I didn't mean that. Like, I didn't
mean like he was a homosexual.

2069
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:17,760
I just say faggot like,
like you're a bitch and you're a punctual.

2070
02:06:17,761 --> 02:06:19,020
I have to explain myself.

2071
02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:24,650
UFC makes me put on this a rainbow shirt
and tell them I have problem with jumbo

2072
02:06:26,281 --> 02:06:30,250
shirt. Rainbow. Oh, rainbow. They
made you put on a rainbow shirt. Oh,

2073
02:06:30,251 --> 02:06:33,540
share the PR team and, and,
and apologize. And you know,

2074
02:06:33,541 --> 02:06:37,060
because I have him as homophobic in
and of itself, I have all the, all the,

2075
02:06:37,061 --> 02:06:40,710
the gay activist rights coming after me.
Now they're wanting money.

2076
02:06:40,830 --> 02:06:44,790
How strange is that? They want money
from me because I offended on it.

2077
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:49,950
I should donate. I did have to
do any, I did donate. So anyways,

2078
02:06:49,951 --> 02:06:53,370
I tried to get on it and explain Muslim.
I said, man, I didn't call him a Faggot,

2079
02:06:53,371 --> 02:06:58,080
like a faggot. I called him a
faggot bitch. And that backfired.

2080
02:06:58,530 --> 02:07:01,980
Big Time. Yeah. And I, I
mean that's just how I talk.

2081
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:05,910
I if I called you a punk bitch Faggot,
that's just, that's just what I said.

2082
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:09,390
I don't mean it in any
other way other than that.

2083
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:13,710
But the thing is, here's the thing, right?

2084
02:07:13,890 --> 02:07:18,780
And I don't mean it homophobia.
Homophobia is bad. Right? But our words,

2085
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:22,830
our words bad.
Like what if you feel the same way?

2086
02:07:23,010 --> 02:07:27,180
Like is it a real issue is in I have to
pee so bad. Good, good. Pete. All right,

2087
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:33,240
you gotta pick your beer?
Yeah, I'm three and good luck.

2088
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:35,973
Okay.

2089
02:07:36,650 --> 02:07:40,940
I think all words are dependent
upon the context and your intent.

2090
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:45,590
Like what do you, what do you mean have
you say to someone like, come on bitch,

2091
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:50,330
like in there, your friend that
it's fun. But if you say to someone,

2092
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:52,940
come on bitch,
and then you hate them.

2093
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:56,780
Those exact same words or taking
on a totally different meaning.

2094
02:07:57,410 --> 02:08:02,150
And that's the same thing with every
word except the n word, the n word.

2095
02:08:02,270 --> 02:08:04,100
It's like it's so toxic.

2096
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:09,790
You can't even use it joking around and
you definitely can't use it the way you

2097
02:08:10,341 --> 02:08:13,340
could say almost any other word.

2098
02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:16,023
So like,

2099
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:16,840
yeah,

2100
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:19,720
well I had a bit that I was trying out
for a while but I had a abandoned it.

2101
02:08:20,050 --> 02:08:23,410
Where else like the n word is one word
that you can't even call yourself.

2102
02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:27,790
Like you, you can't even
say God, I'm such an n word

2103
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:34,390
because faithful get fucking mad at you.
You can't even say it. But if you're,

2104
02:08:34,391 --> 02:08:35,650
but here's the catch.

2105
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:39,880
If you're a black guy you could toss
that shit around like a beach ball at a

2106
02:08:39,881 --> 02:08:41,560
concert and it's fine.

2107
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:43,110
Okay.

2108
02:08:43,110 --> 02:08:45,680
If you're a black girl
you could use it as well.

2109
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:50,150
Although a little more sparingly please
grace.

2110
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:53,070
They can't use it the same amount.

2111
02:08:53,530 --> 02:08:58,420
Black girls like tend to use it just a
little bit more leniently but they could

2112
02:08:58,421 --> 02:08:59,530
do whatever they want with that word.

2113
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:03,880
It's one of the more fascinating words I
think in human history in terms of like

2114
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:08,860
its its impact. What it means
and how it can ruin your career.

2115
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:12,460
Like didn't that one congressman
have to resign because

2116
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:18,550
Sasha Baron Cohen had him
yelling out the n word. Right.

2117
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:20,350
What was he was just because of that,

2118
02:09:20,351 --> 02:09:23,560
but that probably it was on the list
of things. What was he, what did he do?

2119
02:09:23,561 --> 02:09:27,100
Was he a representative George and maybe
this bigger future. What is up open?

2120
02:09:27,101 --> 02:09:30,070
That commode you got in there I think
does everything does everything.

2121
02:09:30,410 --> 02:09:34,060
She taught water up your asshole.
Ooh Wee. It's warm when you sit down.

2122
02:09:34,650 --> 02:09:37,010
It was wonderful. He did. Yeah.

2123
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:39,820
You would fit in great with
the pirates if you said guys,

2124
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:44,170
just trying to complain,
Bro. Come try my commode out.

2125
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:47,560
It gives a little hotter shall walk.
You're not homophobic guy. No you're not.

2126
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:50,260
But it's, it's one of those
things where if you say it,

2127
02:09:50,290 --> 02:09:54,250
I guess if you're a gay person and you
hear someone say you'd be really upset,

2128
02:09:54,251 --> 02:09:57,100
like they are being homophobic.
The problem is like the, we had,

2129
02:09:57,101 --> 02:09:59,410
this bitch is not good enough.

2130
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:02,290
No certain situ and they're trying
to get that one to remember.

2131
02:10:02,410 --> 02:10:06,760
W W Kamau bell wouldn't say, he says
he doesn't say bitch anymore. I'm like,

2132
02:10:06,761 --> 02:10:10,720
all right dude, you're self
censoring or limiting language.

2133
02:10:11,290 --> 02:10:14,620
I did this podcast with wolf man serious,

2134
02:10:14,621 --> 02:10:18,810
and he tells me that he now
not a homophobic at all.

2135
02:10:18,820 --> 02:10:22,840
I just caught me off guard. I didn't
know, I didn't know how to take it.

2136
02:10:22,841 --> 02:10:26,530
When he told me that he
experiments,

2137
02:10:26,531 --> 02:10:31,420
he didn't kind of know if he like boys or
girls. And I was like, oh, Jason Ellis.

2138
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:35,080
Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah.
And I was like, what?

2139
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:40,130
You don't know what you like, here's
the guy had been to a couple parties,

2140
02:10:40,131 --> 02:10:40,964
you know?
And

2141
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:48,020
I just go both ways and we just have
groups of people and sometimes it'd be

2142
02:10:48,021 --> 02:10:50,300
groups of guys. And I was just
scratching my head and like,

2143
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:52,223
Huh,

2144
02:10:53,790 --> 02:10:57,230
ah, okay. I didn't know how to, I didn't
know how to, how to take that out. Right.

2145
02:10:57,450 --> 02:10:59,970
If you don't expect it. And
I've known him for years, years.

2146
02:10:59,971 --> 02:11:03,660
They dropped this ball on
me and I was like, man,

2147
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:08,490
uh, I don't, I didn't know how to take
it. It was just, it caught me off guard.

2148
02:11:08,491 --> 02:11:13,380
It was weird. He's like, what
do you think? You think? I
like girls, but I also like,

2149
02:11:13,710 --> 02:11:15,240
or I thought,
I liked guys

2150
02:11:18,530 --> 02:11:21,380
what I wanted to say. And what I say are
two different things. You know? It's like,

2151
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:24,830
what'd you want to say? I want him
to say, man, um, no offense, but man,

2152
02:11:24,831 --> 02:11:29,780
you put a dick in your mouth
and you are a Faggot, but this,

2153
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:31,460
so now you changed.
No,

2154
02:11:31,620 --> 02:11:36,620
I understand that you've wanted to say
that you wanted is that the inner me was

2155
02:11:37,131 --> 02:11:41,270
wanting to say and I just
looked at him like, fuck,

2156
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:45,290
I didn't what?
I was just so blown back by it.

2157
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:47,960
But why is that shocking if
people are definitely gay,

2158
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:52,670
it's not shocking because you
didn't expect, I didn't expect it,

2159
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:56,000
but it's not shocking that someone's gay.
It's like there's a lot of gay people,

2160
02:11:56,030 --> 02:11:59,000
right? Nothing wrong with it.
I don't care at all, nor do I,

2161
02:11:59,030 --> 02:12:01,850
but when you don't expect someone to
be gay and then you're like, whoa,

2162
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:04,430
because then you thought that he was like,

2163
02:12:04,431 --> 02:12:09,410
you look like you and I were just a
couple of straight guys hanging out for

2164
02:12:09,411 --> 02:12:14,150
meanwhile. He, meanwhile,
he was not. He is, uh,

2165
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:17,090
the one thing that is odd with me,

2166
02:12:17,091 --> 02:12:21,680
with people that say things like
that is that they go sometimes.

2167
02:12:22,190 --> 02:12:25,910
Sometimes I like guys and sometimes I
like girls. Like I couldn't imagine.

2168
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:29,720
What would that, that would be like
or you're not sure? You're not sure.

2169
02:12:29,730 --> 02:12:33,580
So me like, what do you mean you don't
talk straight sometimes you not like Joe,

2170
02:12:33,581 --> 02:12:37,100
no matter what. Every time I go
to basket robins, I get vanilla.

2171
02:12:38,370 --> 02:12:43,040
That's what I'm going to work with
strawberry, you know, like rocky road.

2172
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:48,050
Sometimes I'll, I'll, I'll dabble in
there, but if you brought me back vanilla,

2173
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:51,600
you know, I'm gonna like
that, you know? It's not like,
well, as long as I go there.

2174
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:56,780
Right. I mean, there's people that do
look, they're just wired different.

2175
02:12:56,781 --> 02:12:59,210
There's nothing wrong with it.
As long as he's not trying to fuck you,

2176
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:01,070
but why would that be a problem?

2177
02:13:01,070 --> 02:13:03,620
All of a sudden will be a problem
if you don't want to fuck him. True.

2178
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:07,910
[inaudible] it makes you realize what
it's like to be a girl in the most

2179
02:13:07,911 --> 02:13:09,620
insignificant ways.
Cause with the girls,

2180
02:13:09,650 --> 02:13:13,780
obviously most more dangerous because
guys are bigger than you and you're going

2181
02:13:13,790 --> 02:13:17,780
to actually hold you down and fuck you.
But when, when you're around gay guys,

2182
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:20,860
I used to work out at a gay gym
when I was doing news radio, right?

2183
02:13:20,861 --> 02:13:23,720
I worked at Gold's gym and
Cole and I used to describe it.

2184
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:27,510
I was a tasty little morsel
in a big gay stu just,

2185
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:30,860
it was the closest gym to the studio,
so great gem,

2186
02:13:31,020 --> 02:13:35,180
but it was filled with aggressive
gay guys that had like those.

2187
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,220
They had those scrunchy socks,
like fucking,

2188
02:13:38,221 --> 02:13:43,020
they were in a music video from the
1980s like their flashdance socks.

2189
02:13:43,530 --> 02:13:45,790
These guys like timberlands and style,

2190
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:50,840
like Super Tan and Roy it up and just
hit nine each other left and right.

2191
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:53,400
Leather vests on us.
I mean it was crazy.

2192
02:13:53,401 --> 02:13:56,730
It was such a crazy scene
and when you go there,

2193
02:13:56,760 --> 02:14:00,630
you realize that these guys are,
they're like leering at you.

2194
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:03,180
They're not looking at you like a guy
going, what's up man? How are you doing?

2195
02:14:03,690 --> 02:14:05,700
You know, use the triceps, you know? No,

2196
02:14:05,701 --> 02:14:09,720
it wasn't that they would be looking
at you if you walked into an all female

2197
02:14:09,721 --> 02:14:14,070
lesbian super smoke show Jim.

2198
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:17,430
That's how you'd be looking.
All of them. I go, Oh yeah,

2199
02:14:17,431 --> 02:14:22,431
but I cas have you want me to you all
all lesbian fee because all lesbian Jim,

2200
02:14:23,611 --> 02:14:27,150
they probably looked like Tom
Arnold and my fantasy that I'm in,

2201
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:31,830
they're hall like super high fitness
models. I get in there working out,

2202
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:35,160
hitting each other. If they were
legit lesbians, they'd be like,

2203
02:14:35,161 --> 02:14:37,650
what the fuck are you looking at?
That'd be the same.

2204
02:14:37,650 --> 02:14:39,420
Then you would be the perpetrator.

2205
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:41,520
It you'd be feeling like the
guys look at you and you're like,

2206
02:14:41,521 --> 02:14:46,000
what the fuck you looking at?
Yeah. I mean, the real thing is I,

2207
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:49,860
I feel like, uh, gay and straight people,

2208
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:53,580
everybody can get along fine as
long as everyone's on the same page.

2209
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:56,820
And as long as they're
not trying to fuck you,

2210
02:14:56,821 --> 02:14:59,610
if you don't want it and you're not
trying to fuck them if they don't want it.

2211
02:14:59,790 --> 02:15:03,450
Like if you're not trying to fuck these
lesbians cause you, you, you, you respect.

2212
02:15:03,451 --> 02:15:04,680
In fact,
they only like girls.

2213
02:15:04,681 --> 02:15:07,530
That's all great and the gay
guys aren't trying to fuck you,

2214
02:15:07,531 --> 02:15:12,400
but can we get tell by looking at someone,
can we get mad at the double standard?

2215
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:15,960
You're saying, Hey, these
gay guys, they say sometimes,

2216
02:15:16,130 --> 02:15:17,940
what about these girls that are like,
well,

2217
02:15:17,941 --> 02:15:21,860
I sometimes like girls and sometimes
I like guys and girls and then you're

2218
02:15:21,870 --> 02:15:24,440
listening. I'm like, yeah, that
sounds like a pretty good idea.

2219
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:27,300
It does sound a good idea and I think
we should shut the fuck up about that.

2220
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:30,750
Otherwise they're going to get insecure
or they've got to stop that practice,

2221
02:15:30,780 --> 02:15:35,100
let them keep going and have a good time.
But all of a sudden the guy's like, God,

2222
02:15:35,101 --> 02:15:37,520
that's not like girls. Hey Joe, you
want to come on the guide shipping?

2223
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:41,270
We're hypocrites. Hypocrites. Yeah.

2224
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:45,180
But there's something about
God for straight guys.

2225
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:49,620
The idea of a guy fucking you or making
you suck his dick is the most horrific

2226
02:15:49,621 --> 02:15:50,454
thing.

2227
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:55,560
It'd be relaxed to the cave
diving experience for me

2228
02:15:57,140 --> 02:16:00,340
that the nightmares would be,
but

2229
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:05,280
I have no zero ill will towards them.

2230
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:10,050
And I don't have any problem with them
in any way in society, in any way,

2231
02:16:10,051 --> 02:16:14,110
shape or form. I'm not even remotely
homophobic gay people. Sure.

2232
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:19,880
But there's a reality that gay dudes are
dudes and dudes are kind of gross and

2233
02:16:19,891 --> 02:16:21,390
they will try to fuck you.
You know?

2234
02:16:21,391 --> 02:16:24,840
And that's the one thing I had a
friend of mine who was a, he was a,

2235
02:16:24,841 --> 02:16:26,790
a wardrobe guy and he was a gay guy.

2236
02:16:26,910 --> 02:16:29,830
And he was always telling me about
these straight dudes that he would, uh,

2237
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:34,210
he would lord the man and turn them and
get them suck. His Dick was hilarious.

2238
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:37,660
He goes, tell stories about
that. About about college,

2239
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:40,570
how the gay guys would
fuck the football players.

2240
02:16:42,430 --> 02:16:46,630
And I'm like, wait, the big bad football
college guys who are getting what?

2241
02:16:47,370 --> 02:16:51,490
Yeah, he didn't. Same. Same thing you'd
say that's theirs. Theirs, they love it.

2242
02:16:51,491 --> 02:16:56,080
They love the term. Like just like a
guy would love to turn a lesbian club.

2243
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:59,140
That'd be a mission when it, yeah,
I used to have a joke about that,

2244
02:16:59,290 --> 02:17:03,370
that guys believe in gay guys.
Like I believe in gay guys,

2245
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:06,340
but I don't really believe in lesbians.

2246
02:17:06,550 --> 02:17:09,950
I think they think they're lesbians
cause that's just cause they ain't got to

2247
02:17:09,951 --> 02:17:13,800
hold it this way. They got me, I turn,

2248
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:17,380
every guy looks at a lesbian like,
hey, I know she thinks she's a lesbian.

2249
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:19,990
Let me fuck her a couple of times.
It'd be nice to her. We're like,

2250
02:17:19,991 --> 02:17:24,190
I can eat pussy way better than
another girl. I don't know Torrance.

2251
02:17:24,620 --> 02:17:27,210
She's no way.
And I brought the Dick but

2252
02:17:30,050 --> 02:17:32,710
not,
not only nice fuzzy

2253
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:38,300
and I brought the dam. The data. Yeah.

2254
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:41,920
So men don't necessarily
totally believe in lesbian.

2255
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:46,000
I don't. They 100% believe
in gay dudes. Then why?

2256
02:17:46,001 --> 02:17:50,470
Why don't butch girls act more like soup?
I mean they do.

2257
02:17:50,471 --> 02:17:52,210
They cut their hair and they were,
some of them do,

2258
02:17:52,330 --> 02:17:56,360
but the gay guys all got
the snap and depressed.

2259
02:17:59,020 --> 02:18:03,790
There's some fucking like
beefy bodybuilder gay dudes
that look like straight

2260
02:18:03,791 --> 02:18:08,210
guys. Yeah. You can't tell. Yeah. Do
they slap your ass in the gym? Take good.

2261
02:18:08,650 --> 02:18:12,490
Whoa. No, I want to get a beer after

2262
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:16,270
you stop right there.

2263
02:18:17,380 --> 02:18:19,630
It's like you should be a way to tell
like they have different markets,

2264
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:24,220
you know shit kinds of birds. Like
oh that's a female. It's a female.

2265
02:18:24,221 --> 02:18:27,160
Birds see those extra feathers.
But what if it's a transgender?

2266
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:31,210
Now what if it's wearing female feathers?

2267
02:18:31,211 --> 02:18:34,780
But who? That's an odd one, right?

2268
02:18:34,781 --> 02:18:37,780
Because that's one that like
we didn't have children.

2269
02:18:37,781 --> 02:18:42,760
So how do you feel about if you're
little girl has to go to the bathroom but

2270
02:18:42,761 --> 02:18:45,490
there's a guy girl in there?

2271
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:47,770
Well like what draws the line?

2272
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:51,520
I would hope that either way,

2273
02:18:51,521 --> 02:18:54,250
like if you are a son is
going to the bathroom,

2274
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:59,140
there's some pedophile child molester
that preys on boys and he asked me a guy

2275
02:18:59,141 --> 02:19:01,710
and he's in that bathroom.
It has nothing to do with your,

2276
02:19:01,730 --> 02:19:05,920
your sexual orientation has to do with
you being a Predator and a piece of shit.

2277
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:10,780
But that could happen for straight people
just as easily as it happened for gay

2278
02:19:10,781 --> 02:19:13,880
people. Diseases happen
for Trans People. It's,

2279
02:19:13,930 --> 02:19:17,860
it's someone who's willing to pray on
smaller people that are vulnerable.

2280
02:19:17,861 --> 02:19:19,730
I was just,
I wasn't even going to pedal.

2281
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:24,250
Like there's a lot of like trans people
that would be more than happy to be

2282
02:19:24,251 --> 02:19:28,490
really friendly to your daughter
and it would be an issue at all.

2283
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:33,020
She pulls out a wiener and peas and you're
doing a show and your daughter's like,

2284
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:37,540
and your daughter's like,
what the Hell, dad? Um,

2285
02:19:38,570 --> 02:19:43,220
right. But what if you had a girl who
became a transgender girl? She's big tits,

2286
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:46,010
but she wanted to keep her dick.
Yeah. And where, where she go.

2287
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:49,800
She's wearing a skirt, high
heels right now. Today. Where
should go? Which bathroom?

2288
02:19:49,801 --> 02:19:53,540
Shoes. I don't know. I want to
say, I want to say she's got,

2289
02:19:53,690 --> 02:19:57,950
she's got the equipment right. She's
got the equipment and full equipment.

2290
02:19:57,951 --> 02:20:02,660
Full equipment for, for the male female,

2291
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:07,190
but just tits, like his bro example,
go to bally Jay's Twitter page.

2292
02:20:07,340 --> 02:20:11,810
I'm just saying that, that, I think that
would worry. She feels like a woman.

2293
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:16,640
But she was born a man. Dick. Yeah, but
she has a dick, but she's as Co Bailey.

2294
02:20:16,650 --> 02:20:18,170
Jay's my favorite example.

2295
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:22,820
I hope she doesn't mind me using her
because she's a transgender girl.

2296
02:20:22,821 --> 02:20:27,740
That I like is as much a girl as you
could possibly get while still having a

2297
02:20:27,741 --> 02:20:32,190
dick. Like see, look at that set. Right.

2298
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:35,030
That confused the fuck out
of here. Right? Like, Hey,

2299
02:20:35,031 --> 02:20:39,510
what's going on here now go to the
media or media page. They kill her now.

2300
02:20:39,510 --> 02:20:43,430
She's alive. No. Did they,
do they like Jonah? I mean,

2301
02:20:43,470 --> 02:20:47,810
she says she pulls her out. This is
the thing. She's got a giant Dick.

2302
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:52,640
So she's got these big tests and
then hey, there you go. Oh Man. Yeah.

2303
02:20:52,641 --> 02:20:55,520
So where does she paying,
you know I'm,

2304
02:20:55,521 --> 02:20:57,520
I'm cool with her going to
the girls' room and what?

2305
02:20:58,900 --> 02:21:02,060
I mean just she's going to probably squat.

2306
02:21:02,170 --> 02:21:04,280
It's not like she's going to
stand there with their pants down.

2307
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:07,700
Just hosing the wall.
Letting everybody know you feel,

2308
02:21:07,701 --> 02:21:11,860
I mean if she went into the men's room,
that would cause more of a conflict. Yeah.

2309
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:14,750
Could you imagine,
could you imagine something like that?

2310
02:21:14,751 --> 02:21:18,830
Do you're saying let her
go into the female? Yeah.

2311
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:22,460
Not just for safety, but just like
who she identifies with. Look,

2312
02:21:22,461 --> 02:21:24,890
it's a weird thing, right?
Because the Trans Person Is,

2313
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:27,800
do you go into the family room?
Do you go into family bathroom in between?

2314
02:21:27,830 --> 02:21:30,230
That's probably the, that's
the safe bet. Ironic.

2315
02:21:30,250 --> 02:21:34,100
She's anti if she's not going to make
a family with what there's going on,

2316
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:38,180
that's so confusing. That is so how
does that kind of pregnant? Yeah.

2317
02:21:38,181 --> 02:21:41,070
I mean not yet,
but to maybe in our

2318
02:21:42,710 --> 02:21:45,780
machines you can also
change agenda Changer.

2319
02:21:46,730 --> 02:21:51,020
That would be a way where transgender
people would probably be the most happy,

2320
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:56,080
where they didn't have to like hormonally
become a woman and through surgery and

2321
02:21:57,081 --> 02:22:00,120
throw it, but instead they just
actually turn you into a woman. Bam.

2322
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:06,050
My time. You done. Oh, you want to be
a girl being and maybe go back. Well,

2323
02:22:06,051 --> 02:22:08,990
if that's the case, yeah,
you could go there and back.

2324
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:14,180
Where do I sign up and Zach, because I'm
going, I'm going to go check this out.

2325
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:17,210
See what it's like for a couple
of days a week. Go to Vegas,

2326
02:22:18,250 --> 02:22:21,920
let a couple of dudes banging. Yeah.
Now for dot. Now that's another one.

2327
02:22:21,921 --> 02:22:23,960
That's weird. Now. It's
weird. It's weird again,

2328
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:27,240
because you have that memory when you back

2329
02:22:30,730 --> 02:22:34,200
and tell my friends like, dude, I
want to bang. They got still out.

2330
02:22:37,030 --> 02:22:41,430
It's always in the back of
your throat. Yeah. So yeah.
Yeah. That would have to be a

2331
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:45,480
giant issue.

2332
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:51,330
So yeah.
You say you would try it,

2333
02:22:51,331 --> 02:22:53,820
but then you had to have the
memory of trying it. Yeah.

2334
02:22:53,821 --> 02:22:57,900
You'd have to in the middle, you could
maybe pass that you were a girl. Maybe,

2335
02:22:57,901 --> 02:23:02,280
but one of the guys trying to fuck,
you'd be like, Hey, no dude, no, no.

2336
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:03,300
But he's like,
but you're a girl.

2337
02:23:03,301 --> 02:23:06,030
Would you do a random or would you think
you'd do a friend of yours that you'd

2338
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:13,530
like? Would you give any Bravo,
Bravo. I heard some shit.

2339
02:23:14,090 --> 02:23:14,730
Let's go.

2340
02:23:14,730 --> 02:23:18,240
Not only would I do a rant about where
a mask like fucking eyes wide shut,

2341
02:23:18,900 --> 02:23:21,360
but that's the,
when you as a girl,

2342
02:23:21,361 --> 02:23:25,560
you wouldn't look like you
as a girl when you hotter,

2343
02:23:25,590 --> 02:23:29,670
hotter to give out of curly hair.
He had his god damn.

2344
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:35,290
Imagine if you zapped over to the
female and you were just precious,

2345
02:23:36,610 --> 02:23:41,520
are you? They're like,
oh, you problem a problem.

2346
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:42,623
A real problem.

2347
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:51,000
Yeah. Fuck yeah. So they made
you wear a rainbow shirt,

2348
02:23:52,890 --> 02:23:57,660
isn't it? They sold it to about how gay
people took over the rainbow. I'm like,

2349
02:23:57,661 --> 02:24:01,830
it's, there is a rainbow. It used to
be in leprechauns pots of gold. Nope,

2350
02:24:01,950 --> 02:24:05,670
not anymore. Not Anymore. They took
that shit over. They own, I don't,

2351
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:09,410
I don't fully understand. I'm sure
someone will comment on your youtube page,

2352
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:14,560
youtube page here and tell
you why that uh, why, why,

2353
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:18,990
why the rainbow? Well, it's just
beautiful. Everybody could fit along.

2354
02:24:19,450 --> 02:24:22,530
It's beautiful colors. They're
flamboyant. They're like a lot of colors.

2355
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:24,810
But all those colors together,
like Yay.

2356
02:24:24,811 --> 02:24:28,080
Everyone's getting along with
all the colors. Flamboyant. No.

2357
02:24:28,081 --> 02:24:32,190
Can you say all know this bears
right? There has to be. There's, yeah,

2358
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:37,200
because some of the guys still
like, yeah. Did you guys shit,

2359
02:24:37,470 --> 02:24:42,150
Shit. Fuck, fuck. Ah, fine.
Nothing wrong with that.

2360
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:45,900
But the words is what kills
him. F word. I don't say it.

2361
02:24:45,901 --> 02:24:50,010
Don't say Donald Serone please,
please make a donation here.

2362
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:52,650
It's one of those words
as growing up as kids,

2363
02:24:52,651 --> 02:24:56,070
it didn't really mean a gay person
like Louis Ck had a whole bit about it.

2364
02:24:56,290 --> 02:24:57,990
That didn't mean you didn't.

2365
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:01,360
But we're supposed to evolve our folks
at call you a fancy. I've done that.

2366
02:25:01,370 --> 02:25:05,790
I don't mean it like that as me. You
don't mean this is a gay person, bitch.

2367
02:25:05,791 --> 02:25:09,900
I don't mean you're a female dog. It's
just, it's just, it's the same word.

2368
02:25:10,390 --> 02:25:15,360
Bitch is like level one. But faggot
is like the gold level. It's like,

2369
02:25:15,361 --> 02:25:18,090
listen, we're not playing around
and playing. You said it, you

2370
02:25:20,550 --> 02:25:24,430
cut. If I add the gas,
didn't hear like you fucking

2371
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:29,120
cunt, Bro. That's, I went there,
I went to the, at def con five.

2372
02:25:29,940 --> 02:25:34,900
But if we're in London or in the no
man's Land Australia and they just say,

2373
02:25:34,930 --> 02:25:38,390
oh, you fucking cheeky. Cont
you know, they think it's cut.

2374
02:25:38,510 --> 02:25:40,540
It's the word they use.
Yeah.

2375
02:25:40,750 --> 02:25:44,970
So I guess because they use
it all. I mean, I don't know,

2376
02:25:44,990 --> 02:25:49,620
just words, the words. Yeah, words
are words, but it's, you know,

2377
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:54,580
if they're ineffective, you know, and also
would they hurt so bad? Yeah. Do you can,

2378
02:25:54,610 --> 02:25:58,510
you can kill. I mean, dude, you,
especially if there's some reality to it.

2379
02:25:58,540 --> 02:26:02,020
That's the thing. Like I promise today
we're going to get some good ones.

2380
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:04,210
There's going to be some,
yeah, but you can't read those.

2381
02:26:04,310 --> 02:26:07,870
I'm going to read them and I'm like,
how are you hard right next to him.

2382
02:26:07,890 --> 02:26:12,150
He was such a big, you're living your
life. Use this big character. Why?

2383
02:26:12,151 --> 02:26:15,210
Why paid God? I love you.
I love living a life.

2384
02:26:15,220 --> 02:26:18,640
I wish more people would get out
there and live life. Joe. Yeah, the,

2385
02:26:18,641 --> 02:26:20,770
I get so much shit for that.
Like I can't believe you're not training.

2386
02:26:20,771 --> 02:26:24,850
You're out living. And I said, man, look
at my life like I'm retired right now.

2387
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:27,700
Why do I want to do all this cool
shit when I'm 50 and I can't,

2388
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:32,350
I can do right now in my prime
will. Also, when people are young,

2389
02:26:32,351 --> 02:26:34,720
they do whatever they want to do.
I then,

2390
02:26:34,721 --> 02:26:37,300
it's like when you get old you're
supposed to become more serious. Sure.

2391
02:26:37,301 --> 02:26:41,770
I remember when you decided to try to be
more serious for a while and it fucked

2392
02:26:41,771 --> 02:26:46,090
you up. Fuck me up. It wasn't the way
you limited your expression. Yeah.

2393
02:26:46,390 --> 02:26:50,810
That's a good way to throw it in because
I think I love doing all this wild to

2394
02:26:50,811 --> 02:26:53,910
create living who you are is having fun.
Yeah.

2395
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:57,640
It's like the like if I die here and
you're like cowboy, change of plans.

2396
02:26:57,641 --> 02:26:59,740
We're not doing the podcast,
we're going skydive and I'd be like,

2397
02:27:00,650 --> 02:27:04,710
you are you speaking to my heart?
I'm going to do a podcast from skydiving.

2398
02:27:04,730 --> 02:27:07,930
Skydiving.
So tell me about John.

2399
02:27:14,170 --> 02:27:18,550
Why did they make you wear rainbow shirt?
Why a rainbow?

2400
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:22,300
30 seconds.
It'd be a very short podcast.

2401
02:27:24,970 --> 02:27:29,750
Well, the UFC has to do damage control
on savages, which is hilarious. Yes.

2402
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:33,460
I have a bunch of people like you and Mike
Perry and you know, fill in the blank.

2403
02:27:33,490 --> 02:27:36,540
All these savages running around saying
crazy shit. And you go, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,

2404
02:27:36,541 --> 02:27:40,480
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.
Do you ever go to a Derrick Lewis,

2405
02:27:40,481 --> 02:27:44,410
his Instagram page? I love it. I love it.

2406
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:49,540
Where does he get the videos? No Man. He's
got all of them. All of them. What is it?

2407
02:27:49,541 --> 02:27:53,690
Uh, is it, uh, the
beast? MMA? What is his,

2408
02:27:53,710 --> 02:27:58,570
a plugin. Yeah. Beast. UFC.
Derrick Lewis. Shout out to Jerry.

2409
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:01,070
Derrick Lewis is fighting volt con.
He's focused.

2410
02:28:01,180 --> 02:28:05,940
He's fighting that giant Russian dude.
Tell him, Derek, let's not do the same.

2411
02:28:05,970 --> 02:28:08,660
I know your bag was her phone or
her back was hurting. Last fight.

2412
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:11,800
That was the craziest Fred
I've ever seen in my life.

2413
02:28:11,830 --> 02:28:15,820
Let's throw more than five
punches this fight. But he's
like, he was waiting. Yeah.

2414
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:19,150
Alexander Volkov the beast.
UFC The beast. Got It. Yeah.

2415
02:28:19,151 --> 02:28:22,070
He's got the most hilarious
Instagram page and anytime does

2416
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:26,990
anything fucked up that it's on video.
It's on his, on his eye. He's on all day.

2417
02:28:27,230 --> 02:28:31,790
That is so bad. You see the guy
shit eat shit. Swatch and dark.

2418
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:36,200
It's just so crazy that he,
he puts all these in there.

2419
02:28:38,590 --> 02:28:41,180
Where do you, where do you hear
about accidents? All of them.

2420
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:44,360
There's one that he has like real recently
within the last couple of weeks of

2421
02:28:44,361 --> 02:28:46,400
this guy standing on
the side of the highway.

2422
02:28:46,401 --> 02:28:50,150
What is the girl with the boobs and
click on that. What's happening here?

2423
02:28:51,890 --> 02:28:55,220
There's somehow or another the nipples
aren't showing. That's amazing.

2424
02:28:55,221 --> 02:28:59,390
Maybe they're a little higher.
Incredible control. She goes, Hey don,

2425
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:02,350
those nipples are in the wrong place.
So nibbles or should be.

2426
02:29:02,390 --> 02:29:05,660
There should be some aerial hanging
out. Yeah, because you got no areola.

2427
02:29:05,990 --> 02:29:08,870
She's an alien.
That's barely a person.

2428
02:29:08,960 --> 02:29:12,770
Do you think aliens have beautiful
girls or are they beautiful alien?

2429
02:29:12,830 --> 02:29:15,080
I think they gave up on pussy.
This is what I think.

2430
02:29:15,320 --> 02:29:19,650
What does this guy get this guy for?
Stop it if you are,

2431
02:29:20,010 --> 02:29:22,220
if you think your life is bad,
these are Simon's brother.

2432
02:29:22,221 --> 02:29:27,120
One is gay and they just got one
ass. Oh my God. Are they really?

2433
02:29:27,220 --> 02:29:29,500
Oh God.
Did you hear it?

2434
02:29:29,501 --> 02:29:32,240
That you just said is that
really think your life is bad?

2435
02:29:32,900 --> 02:29:37,850
One is gay and one ass
kissing one of them.

2436
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:42,990
That's the, that's not real. That's
the general part. Yeah. Kissing.

2437
02:29:43,310 --> 02:29:47,550
I don't even want to know if he has one
ass part is what clears into the Ras to

2438
02:29:47,560 --> 02:29:50,960
scroll down. If you could
see the accident. If you
go, there's a highway video.

2439
02:29:50,990 --> 02:29:55,450
So this is the gentlemen from hours
basis. No, that's sign it. That's funny.

2440
02:29:55,451 --> 02:29:58,570
I haven't seen that one. I haven't seen
the jumping from outer space one. Um,

2441
02:29:58,580 --> 02:30:02,690
but there's one where a guy's standing
on the side of the highway right next to

2442
02:30:02,691 --> 02:30:07,691
a black SUV and someone plows into the
SUV at full blast and someone else flies

2443
02:30:08,871 --> 02:30:11,060
out of the back of the SUV,

2444
02:30:11,210 --> 02:30:14,990
flies into the air and lands in their
feet and starts walking. Come on.

2445
02:30:15,140 --> 02:30:19,400
It's fucking crazy. He posts
so many. This is crazy. I mean,

2446
02:30:19,401 --> 02:30:23,180
how far was it? No. Did they pull it?

2447
02:30:23,390 --> 02:30:26,150
Where's he at with the rattlesnake?
What's the date of that?

2448
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:31,160
What is the rattlesnake one happening?
Oh yeah. He probably got it pulled.

2449
02:30:31,450 --> 02:30:34,280
His shit gets pulled.
Does it get hold, I guess?

2450
02:30:34,890 --> 02:30:35,330
Yeah.

2451
02:30:35,330 --> 02:30:38,900
People find out about it,
but people sometimes outer space jump.

2452
02:30:38,901 --> 02:30:42,500
I haven't seen it. That ain't it. Whoa.

2453

watching all the crazy videos like, yeah,

2456
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:02,680

many now. It's like so much fucked up.

2457
02:31:02,681 --> 02:31:06,880
There is this one novices in the same
one. He's got so many of these, man.

2458
02:31:06,910 --> 02:31:11,310
Oh Jesus. Whoa. What is this?

2459
02:31:11,311 --> 02:31:16,140
A high speed chase. Oh, Jesus.
I'm going to wait for it.

2460
02:31:18,270 --> 02:31:23,260
Oh, I'm wait, I'm sorry. What if
Frank's on his videos? That loop. Oh,

2462
02:31:29,580 --> 02:31:33,390
Jesus.
That one wasn't as good.

2463
02:31:34,450 --> 02:31:38,490
Yeah. The one where the guy
flies out naked and starts
walking on the highway was

2464
02:31:38,491 --> 02:31:43,020
amazing. Maybe that's it. Hold on. Go
back right there. What does that one,

2465
02:31:43,021 --> 02:31:47,310
it looks like a bear standing up. Go
back. How would that one be? It is a cat.

2466
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:54,030
No, hold on. Go back to a record.
That's a cat. A Roomba. Oh, okay.

2467
02:31:55,730 --> 02:32:00,110
Magic being as smooth as this cat washes
the Roomba cubs. Drm touches them.

2468
02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:01,013
It's like

2469
02:32:05,970 --> 02:32:10,550
he's used to the room, but
that's all that is. Oh yeah.

2470
02:32:10,551 --> 02:32:15,310
That's what it is.
Bitchy turn.

2471
02:32:16,580 --> 02:32:20,940
She better get the buzzy for that
better. Right. Ready to fight. That's it.

2472
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:25,460
Looks like to care of the fight or
the cat fight. Jesus Cowboy 33 30.

2473
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:31,190
Was that me? Time flew by. God, we just
did three hours. Welcome mother fuckers.

2474
02:32:31,610 --> 02:32:33,420
That was awesome. Yeah. Hopefully they uh,

2475
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:37,670
hopefully people don't get mad at
you for you. Use of the f word.

2476
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:40,790
The equal use. Equal
shared. We shared that.

2477
02:32:41,010 --> 02:32:43,070
I use it only in referenced the time cop

2478
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:52,640
smells things. My word, the word limiting.

2479
02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:55,760
Limiting expression in strange ways today.
Yeah.

2480
02:32:56,900 --> 02:33:00,230
Half of it is as much about people getting
mad at you and wanting to be able to

2481
02:33:00,670 --> 02:33:05,670
censor you or to get control of you or
to be angry at you or to shut you down or

2482
02:33:06,561 --> 02:33:10,730
get you fired to get you to put that
rainbow shirt on. It's like half of it.

2483
02:33:13,480 --> 02:33:14,313
Well,

2484
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:18,230

you going to do? So in a way,
