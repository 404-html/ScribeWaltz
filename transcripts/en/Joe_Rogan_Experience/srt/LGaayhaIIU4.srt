1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
T two.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,860
Yeah,

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:05,970
we're live ladies and gentlemen.

4
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:06,691
Eddie Bravo.

5
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:10,080
Fresh out of fucking
surgeries here looking good.

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,460
Too gangster as fuck.

7
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:12,810
Very few people would do that.

8
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,644
I'd be in bed.

9
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,720
My feet up filled out of my mind.

10
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,930
Just spine surgeries.

11
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,280
Nothing.

12
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,491
Yeah,

13
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:18,330
no big deal.

14
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,111
Dude.

15
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:20,550
Got a disc replacement,

16
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,920
titanium disk.

17
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,310
The incredible Brian Count of course
is here popping wine as we speak.

18
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,230
That's not organic.

19
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:28,620
Okay.

20
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,490
It wasn't orchestrated,

21
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,020
although if it like Brian Cowen had a
character and his opening in a sitcom,

22
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:34,140
it's like a Kramer slide.

23
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,660
Then Brian would have
a nice bottle of wine.

24
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,810
He would pop it and then he would
explain the vineyard and Fros and grows.

25
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,383
This is about

26
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,690
telling me I had him because he's so good.

27
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,533
You know

28
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,340
Fenocchio he said my favorite,

29
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,660
my favorite Pelu one.

30
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,930
I know dod funding,

31
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:56,500
not to bring them.

32
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,650
I realized as I was
pulling into the driveway,

33
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,820
but Brendan motherfucking job is here
with a powerful young Chamie tee shirt

34
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:05,220
fresh out of the box and Jamie,

35
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,150
where does that motherfucker get?

36
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,150
A Y N g m like run DMC young and sure
that young jimmy.com hung Jamie Dotcom

37
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:13,494
bitches.

38
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,640
People are going to get mad at you.

39
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,960
He full sold out.

40
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,480
[inaudible] people want to vote.

41
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,270
He's sold out.

42
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,103
Don't change the seating,

43
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,473
Jamie.

44
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,001
Folks,

45
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:21,960
you don't have to buy it,

46
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,250
but it is a dope shirt.

47
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,933
What's wrong with you?

48
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,830
How could you not?

49
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,300
How could you not at the throw it on.

50
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,550
I had a nice stylish shirt.

51
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:28,831
I thought,

52
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:29,191
you know what?

53
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,024
I appreciate it.

54
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,613
Jellies.

55
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,250
It's,

56
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,180
he's got his own shirt on,

57
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:34,380
which is a strong move.

58
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,250
That's like a bold,

59
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,270
that's almost when a rapping,

60
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,500
but it's almost a wrap.

61
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,160
Yeah.

62
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,720
You gotta you gotta shirt with your
name up good and fit good and all that.

63
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,350
That is one thing a standup
comic cannot pull off.

64
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,510
You cannot walk around with
shirt with your own face on.

65
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,210
It literally cannot be done.

66
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,230
Now in Jujitsu,

67
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:52,400
it's,

68
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,810
it's,

69
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,650
it's a weird thing too because it's very,

70
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,420
like there was one shirt that was
like an Eddie Bravo scramble shirt.

71
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,740
I could never wear it.

72
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,970
I can't wear,

73
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,190
I can wear a 10th planet shit all day.

74
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:05,371
Yeah.

75
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,120
Yeah.

76
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,890
But something that says Eddie Bravo,

77
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:08,790
Jujitsu or some,

78
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,540
I don't know,

79
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,820
I'd like to get Jiu Jitsu
shirts made with my name.

80
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,620
Just says he used to be a blue belt of
definitely wore run jre shirts before,

81
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,660
but it was almost like nobody
knew what the fuck it meant.

82
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,560
You know,

83
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,970
it's also a Bray and it's not like,

84
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,880
you know like you don't say Joe Rogan,

85
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,760
but my all time that it feel like when
you get to a certain amount of fame and

86
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,810
then you'd like see anyone doing it,

87
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,720
do it.

88
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,090
Like I,

89
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,400
I wore a finding the kid's shirt for
some picture and Whitney Kelvin's let,

90
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,650
don't ever

91
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,530
post a picture of you
and your old shirt again.

92
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,393
Yeah.

93
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,250
You are the fighter and
the kid like he can't,

94
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,000
yeah,

95
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,450
it's,

96
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,110
it's weird.

97
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,800
You know,

98
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,790
we tend to promote it.

99
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,030
You can't be on America's got talent
and where in America's got talent tee

100
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:51,360
shirt.

101
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,900
You know what I'm saying?

102
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,201
I own,

103
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:53,190
America's has got talent,

104
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:54,841
if you will.

105
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,841
We're like the host of star search and
you had a stern shirts everywhere you go

106
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,960
to close those doors.

107
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,890
What did Johnny Depp,

108
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,930
what does giant dad wore a shirt that
said parts of China again are just Johnny.

109
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,080
That Kanye West.

110
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,870
Weird,

111
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,480
right?

112
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,691
Yeah,

113
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,280
but this is designed that's different.

114
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,630
If I design something cool,

115
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,410
I'd wear it.

116
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:14,980
Yeah,

117
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,291
dude,

118
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,330
his look,

119
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,240
I think Kanye West is quite
silly in a lot of ways,

120
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,410
but it's fucking sneakers.

121
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,230
Look,

122
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,061
they're bad ass.

123
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:22,960
He's a great designer.

124
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:24,310
He's got a good mind for things.

125
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,730
He sets the trends for fashion,

126
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:27,780
but he's an interesting
cat and a lot of ways.

127
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,900
He's got a lot of,

128
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:29,680
sure.

129
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,101
For sure.

130
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:31,750
But who the fuck is and you are too bitch.

131
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,590
Oh hell yeah.

132
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,423
I am as well.

133
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,570
Everybody is rooms crazy.

134
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,330
He's awesome.

135
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,400
He's also a prolific,

136
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,290
I bought all this music cause I was,

137
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,030
I told you I was hating
on him and I went home.

138
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,440
I had this hedge picking.

139
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,621
Yeah.

140
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,454
I listened to everything.

141
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,400
I literally bought all his
music and he's so prolific,

142
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,070
man.

143
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,903
I don't know.

144
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,640
He's a bad motherfucker for sure.

145
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,631
No doubt about it.

146
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:50,464
Kanye West,

147
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,321
but you know,

148
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:53,600
you know who fucking makes
me feel lazy as shit.

149
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,463
Is Kevin Hart,

150
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,660
Kim and the Rock,

151
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,800
the two of them together,

152
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,000
will they just take it down a notch?

153
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,590
Can I relax?

154
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,070
Well,

155
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,910
I'm on Instagram,

156
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,660
dude.

157
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,280
Kevin Hart's one in 10 days.

158
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,840
He sponsored by Nike Shoe.

159
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,251
Oh,

160
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:06,941
speaking of,

161
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:09,130
speaking of someone
who makes me feel lazy,

162
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,580
my friend Cameron Hanes is
in a 24 hour race right now.

163
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,270
He called,

164
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,950
he texted me seven hours in.

165
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:16,330
He had already ran 50 miles.

166
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:16,930
She said,

167
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,471
he said,

168
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:18,221
but he's hurting.

169
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:19,270
He's going to keep hammering.

170
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,410
So at that pace,

171
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:21,490
just stop and think about this.

172
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,840
He's not gonna be able
to keep up that pace.

173
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,860
Cause that paces is insane.

174
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,600
Seven hours for 50 miles.

175
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:28,180
It's a hundred miles in 14 hours.

176
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,290
Nobody does that.

177
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,030
It's usually like 24 hours.

178
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:31,331
Like the law.

179
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:36,070
He did 106 last time in
24 hours and he came in,

180
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:39,970
I wanna say like fifth place
and that's a crazy thing.

181
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,290
It was a woman in front of them.

182
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,720
There was a woman who was just a monster.

183
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,820
What's the east of a woman I can't read.

184
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,131
Yeah,

185
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:50,980
you're rolling camera
and 106 miles I believe.

186
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,570
And I think the guy who won,

187
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,040
I do not remember his name,

188
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:59,041
but I believe he was north
of one 13 [inaudible] 14
his build like was he skinny

189
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,270
or was he like a fucking well
cam was too big at the time.

190
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:09,271
Cam was up to like one 80 he lifts a lot
of weights and he's up to like one huge

191
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:12,730
for a long distance for a guy who
runs a hundred it's real crazy.

192
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,350
But he runs a half a marathon literally
every day cause he's preparing for the

193
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,030
big foot 200 in August.

194
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,390
So this hundred mile race that he's doing,

195
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:26,391
his 24 hour race is just to prepare
him for a 200 mile race in August.

196
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,860
Like dude fucking relapsed the on
this guy and he's got a full time job.

197
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,260
So Department of Water
and power in Oregon.

198
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,950
Fucking what are you trying to do?

199
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:41,310
The most successful bow hunter
in the world runs marathons.

200
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,010
Like,

201
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,843
what is he?

202
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,940
He beat Lance Armstrong and
the Boston marathon is true.

203
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,720
Yes.

204
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,710
Not on a bike though.

205
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,080
Waning.

206
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,760
What does he want the greatest
athletes of world's ever known,

207
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,121
but what?

208
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:52,511
What does he,

209
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,590
what does he do for maintenance?

210
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:54,490
How does he keep his body?

211
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,440
He's a savage.

212
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,850
It's hundred percent savage.

213
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,530
You guys are just,

214
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,880
all he does is eat elk,

215
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:01,881
elk,

216
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:02,571
and bear,

217
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,030
and he runs and he lifts and
he works an eight hour day job.

218
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,883
I'm tired.

219
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,783
I'm tired.

220
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,390
Just looking at his Facebook feed.

221
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,280
I am exhausted.

222
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,630
I got to start up in my,

223
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,880
my are trying to run it on the game.

224
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,440
Species exhausted.

225
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,460
Let's talk about the first fight.

226
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:16,761
This fight,

227
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:18,140
he's going to be fucking bad ass.

228
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,880
These chicks are down.

229
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,290
Valerie Laterno.

230
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,030
So this is a flyweight fight.

231
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,110
This is the first,

232
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:24,890
I think.

233
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,840
Is this the first UFC flyweight fight?

234
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,130
Is that,

235
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,000
is that what it is?

236
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,530
It's 25 what does sw a straw weight.

237
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,150
She's the number five
strawweight contender.

238
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:36,650
But this is not a strong way to fight.

239
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:37,790
This is a flyweight fight.

240
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,743
I think.

241
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:39,830
If I'm not,

242
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,240
I could totally be wrong.

243
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,160
The fucking nerds are
going crazy right now.

244
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,990
Let's check it you piece of shit

245
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,200
and fucking Poland.

246
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,693
I love you guys.

247
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,990
Relax.

248
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,823
Everybody relax.

249
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,670
Everybody calmed down that refugees shit.

250
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,980
[inaudible] that's a beautiful name.

251
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,453
I think she's cute.

252
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,591
Show us the card,

253
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,120
Jamie on the other screen
so we could see what,

254
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:08,390
uh,

255
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,250
what fights are so fun card for sure.

256
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:11,130
I think she's cute too.

257
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,130
Was the first one yet right?

258
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,973
And you think,

259
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,160
well,

260
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,670
I'm old.

261
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,181
I'm old.

262
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,590
So all any girl in her twenties,

263
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:16,281
he's adorable.

264
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:18,310
And you're like the creepy
guy from family like dot.

265
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:18,980
Merera I said,

266
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,370
he's like,

267
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,420
she could have a goat head.

268
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,600
She's in her twenties so it's a Calder
one and Latino and Latino just had a

269
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,630
fucking amazing fight where you honor
you and Jay check really five round war

270
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:31,464
and Australia.

271
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:36,550
She went to war dude for five rounds with
this beast of a Moyie Thai fighter and

272
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,790
she lost the fight,

273
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,820
but she more than held
her own the champion.

274
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:41,630
Wow.

275
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,920
Valerie Laterno.

276
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,840
She got down to one 25 which I think
is too much of a struggle for now.

277
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,601
Or excuse me.

278
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:47,811
Yes,

279
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:48,440
thank you.

280
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,890
And now she's at one 25 this is their
first fight at one 25 but I believe she's

281
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:55,640
fought at one 35 to say Yolanda is the
best pound for pound female fighter.

282
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,340
Oh yeah,

283
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,250
she's right.

284
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,921
He Dude,

285
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:58,400
she's,

286
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,270
she scares me.

287
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,460
Her striking is so clean,

288
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,100
but I got to say her fight with Claudia.

289
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:04,431
Good day.

290
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,151
It was super,

291
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,961
super close,

292
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:06,410
man.

293
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,400
It was real close.

294
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,060
Really close.

295
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,090
She dropped her though with a
big fucking uppercut a little,

296
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,170
little while ago though.

297
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,960
That little while the code should be,

298
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,133
I think so too.

299
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,430
The Claudia is a straight 200 dime piece.

300
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,241
I didn't realize it.

301
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,530
So I started watching
the ultimate fighter.

302
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:22,460
She's very pretty.

303
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,660
She react to,

304
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,720
she's so strong.

305
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,933
She's so strong.

306
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,210
Double digits.

307
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,011
Who's nasty man?

308
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:29,150
Her like top pressure.

309
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,840
She's very tough to escape
from really strong technical,

310
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:33,680
Jujitsu and her,

311
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,670
her kickboxing.

312
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,990
Not bad either,

313
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:36,351
man.

314
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,641
No,

315
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:36,831
she,

316
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:38,060
she's very all rounded.

317
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:39,140
Very well rounded.

318
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,310
If anyone's going to beat you on,

319
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,850
it's her.

320
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,020
If you watch the ultimate fighter,

321
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,180
I thought she came off
better than y'all on a shoot.

322
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:44,931
One more fans.

323
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:48,530
You know they had a full on fist fight
while taping that they were throwing head

324
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:49,880
kicks at each other and everything.

325
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,620
Who throws head kicks and look at this.

326
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,020
Meanwhile Calderwood he's about
to get caught in this valley with

327
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,851
the Toronto Armbar.

328
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:58,140
Her arms are in a good position.

329
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,510
Her left arm is not in a good position.

330
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,420
She didn't have good grades.

331
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:03,060
She just kind of holding
on that big right hand.

332
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,440
Calderwood's nasty man.

333
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:05,340
She fights hard,

334
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,750
real aggressive.

335
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,261
Oh,

336
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,220
Valerie goes for it again.

337
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:08,611
But this time,

338
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:11,930
not even close edge to care
to comment on the control,

339
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,783
the posture.

340
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,850
It's old school style.

341
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,470
You know,

342
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,160
doing Jujitsu against that fence.

343
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:17,491
It's a,

344
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,540
it's tough.

345
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,050
Squashed and Jujitsu practitioners
generally aren't used to that.

346
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,670
Yeah.

347
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,630
You're really kind of have to
fight or train with one of those,

348
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:28,010
Huh?

349
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,400
You got to learn how to use the fence
to your benefit and that takes a lot of

350
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,234
practice.

351
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,140
I'm not that good at that.

352
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,741
You know,

353
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,041
man,

354
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,680
I was really surprised when
we used to roll a legends.

355
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,990
How much it hurts the case for it.

356
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,140
Yeah.

357
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,430
The first thing that drives me,

358
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,731
no,

359
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,564
your head,

360
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,021
the word,

361
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:46,170
like when your head gets banged into
it and your head gets pushed into it,

362
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,570
fucking hurt doesn't give that
much and you need your fingers.

363
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:49,201
It doesn't feel good.

364
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,550
It's not fun if they rub up.

365
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:50,821
No,

366
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:53,520
I mean if you're going to do like
straight Jujitsu and you just want to do

367
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:55,560
Jujitsu and never get involved in MMA,

368
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,300
you really should have like a padded wall.

369
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,020
Hell yeah.

370
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,231
Fuck.

371
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,460
Because the cake,

372
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,420
but the cage looks good.

373
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:02,690
If someone's going to sign up walking,

374
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,660
do you want to be like Brennan jump?

375
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,301
Yeah,

376
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:06,511
Bro.

377
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,680
We got a cage full cage.

378
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:07,971
Okay.

379
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:11,430
To man train and replaced
with a full cage,

380
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:12,230
bro.

381
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,750
I used to,

382
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,790
I'm serious as a fucking total poser.

383
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,430
I used to like to walk into that cage.

384
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,220
Oh,

385
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:19,980
called the wind.

386
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,970
Oh No.

387
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,803
All over.

388
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,340
The maternal is hurting.

389
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:23,791
You know,

390
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,410
you're a bad bitch if you
got a shaved head turns.

391
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,600
She's scrambling.

392
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,710
They could easily stop that.

393
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,930
Oh my gosh.

394
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,070
Wow.

395
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,060
Thank God they didn't see,

396
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,691
wow,

397
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:34,170
they didn't,

398
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,910
she got that spinning elbow right in the
writing the old jaw and looking at the

399
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,630
whole card.

400
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,463
She got tagged again.

401
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,510
Valley of the turn.

402
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:42,420
It was so tough,

403
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:43,100
man.

404
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,933
Beaus

405
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,460
you know she has a good
striking background.

406
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:50,310
I think she's just used
to getting hit man,

407
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,900
but she's just tough to,

408
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,910
oh shit.

409
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,260
I'll do it with a big elbow.

410
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,501
Oh,

411
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:58,620
we should tell you guys one
13 if you want to sync up.

412
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:03,621
It's 1110 nine eight seven six five.

413
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,610
That's probably the best way to do it,

414
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:05,900
right?

415
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,733
For sure.

416
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,670
A first round.

417
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,600
Joanna Calderwood.

418
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,960
[inaudible] hard though,

419
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:13,201
man.

420
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,034
It is a very good car.

421
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,320
Did you see the Tam to
Mcroy fight earlier?

422
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,551
What happened?

423
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:22,050
Which was when I was talking to him to
see that Tim didn't got starched with one

424
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:23,130
straight left hand.

425
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,431
Damn.

426
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:23,821
I didn't see it.

427
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:26,430
I saw a homeboy or easy Joe Soto.

428
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,320
Damn Squirrel.

429
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,781
Oh Damn.

430
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:30,780
I see a little Damien
Maia and mad pressure too.

431
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,770
He was leaning that fight.

432
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,910
He was losing that fight,

433
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:36,390
but they weren't giving him enough credit
for the pressure that he was putting

434
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:36,871
on his cause.

435
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:37,591
He's getting tagged.

436
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,030
I think he's getting lit up.

437
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,470
I thought he was getting up getting hit.

438
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:42,990
I thought,

439
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,620
I thought the second round he won,

440
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,630
so we wanted,

441
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,510
the second record was this
guys look at this fight.

442
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,640
When Kenny was saying that he
was down two rounds to one,

443
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:51,000
I was like,

444
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,270
oh,

445
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,760
not see how it could have lost one one,

446
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,010
this

447
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,310
girl,

448
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,430
this girl was taking shot at one one and
then third was up in the air until we

449
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:57,821
took him down.

450
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,090
It was,

451
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,280
see,

452
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,840
what I was seeing though is
a lot of pressure control.

453
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,980
Soto Christian.

454
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,430
Chris was definitely hitting him,

455
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,490
but he didn't have them
hurt in any point though,

456
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,510
and soda was constantly doing this.

457
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,590
Constantly pressure.

458
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,960
Now what a fight.

459
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,500
Very good fight and then in
the third Sodo started tag him.

460
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,390
Soto started to really
put that pressure on them.

461
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:16,781
In public.

462
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,220
It's fucking hard as hell.

463
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,310
They want us to tell you to
back up while you're striking.

464
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,650
Backing up and striking is so much harder.

465
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,810
What do you mean backing on?

466
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,200
I ever move backwards.

467
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,160
I never moves backwards.

468
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:27,581
Your real life,

469
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,420
you run forward,

470
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:28,650
right?

471
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,880
So wanting to run backwards
all the time like that,

472
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,260
it's exhausting.

473
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,570
It's way harder to move backwards.

474
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,090
That's why Thompson so
special and who the ODA,

475
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,440
when the auto was at its best,

476
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,060
you couldn't even get near him.

477
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,740
But that's just a,

478
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:45,400
it's a thing that you could get good
at in Muhammad Ali's to run miles

479
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,150
backwards.

480
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,983
It's over years.

481
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,670
We've been doing it since.

482
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:48,901
He was like,

483
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,450
yeah,

484
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,170
you got to do it.

485
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:50,890
You got to do it.

486
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,340
It's like,

487
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,020
it's a really important part of footwork.

488
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,160
The backing up thing can't be exhausting
queue because the moving forward things

489
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,000
easy for everybody.

490
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,400
So if a guy has just
sort of walking you down,

491
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:01,234
you can't hurt him.

492
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,760
His walking forward is relaxed and easy.

493
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,230
Natural.

494
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,540
Yes.

495
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,040
Especially if he has good blocking,

496
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,890
but you're constantly
springing your body backwards.

497
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:09,970
Springy body backwards.

498
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,050
Different muscles for openings.

499
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:11,884
It's exhausting.

500
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,500
It takes like 30% more.

501
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:13,961
Watch this,

502
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:14,341
watch this,

503
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:14,521
this,

504
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:15,370
this is crazy.

505
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:15,991
Oh,

506
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:16,824
what's this?

507
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,380
Oh,

508
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,900
it's perfect.

509
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,153
Oh,

510
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,690
she's out.

511
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,650
She's hurting for sure.

512
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:24,550
She definitely wasn't out.

513
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,001
I'm a Joe.

514
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,740
Think about the guys and girl,

515
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:28,960
that group successful are some of the,

516
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,530
Oh,

517
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,191
for sure.

518
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:31,150
The worst to deal with.

519
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,470
They're hard because you can't mimic it.

520
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:32,651
Really.

521
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:36,010
That's one of the things interesting
about this fight tonight is that Rory

522
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:38,590
brought in one of the best
guys in the world at it.

523
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,510
He brought in Raymond Daniels,

524
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,291
Raymond Daniels,

525
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,150
that bad ass karate guy,

526
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,570
glory who throws those three 60 turning
side kicks and his dad's face with them.

527
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,020
He's wild.

528
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:51,820
Man is kicking is insane.

529
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,350
So Rory is going to be working with a
guy who can kick arguably as good as

530
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,730
Wonderboy or in the neighborhood.

531
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:58,580
At least God,

532
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,430
I would say better at his level,

533
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:01,390
especially professionally.

534
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:01,930
Um,

535
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,920
as a kickboxer kickbox it's,

536
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,600
it's good to make that argument.

537
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,300
Yeah.

538
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,180
Well the thing is Wonderboy has a
kickboxer was absolutely perfect.

539
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,951
57 no.

540
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:12,460
Yeah.

541
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,640
And Raymond's loss.

542
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:14,590
Some tough fights.

543
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,280
But did Raymond lose to guys
like val to lean and did,

544
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:18,371
did,

545
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:19,240
did he lose to those guys?

546
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:21,520
Cause they were just so
worldclass for competition.

547
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,020
Wonderboy,

548
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,260
I'd never faced something like that.

549
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,010
Is that the case?

550
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,880
Oh Damn.

551
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:28,540
She's tagging or the turnout was so tough
when talks about so much shit through

552
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,374
this awesome fight.

553
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,340
Such a good fight.

554
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,090
The watch the Turner,

555
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,550
she's just jacking off to this way.

556
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,851
This is a very good fight.

557
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:34,140
Damn.

558
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,170
It's a good fight and she's,

559
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,630
Oh get I'm caught host turtles.

560
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:40,510
Just throwing and and
connecting every time.

561
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,670
Will it turn out like
you see her striking?

562
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:43,630
It's real tactical.

563
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,590
Nice.

564
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,890
Right upper cut and you saw
that in the UN j check fight.

565
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:50,530
That's the only way you could survive
striking with you and Jay check.

566
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:51,560
But I do to say,

567
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:51,980
do you want to

568
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,150
broke her hand in that fight?

569
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,060
That's right.

570
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,670
Oh that's a big factor way.

571
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,210
Still throwing bombs.

572
00:14:59,211 --> 00:14:59,941
Hit the tone bum,

573
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,620
throw him bonds are broken when they
say she would don't the golden glory and

574
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:05,330
just do work against Duke.

575
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:05,541
Oh,

576
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,920
I could use just some monster.

577
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:07,820
I can imagine.

578
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,610
I could imagine thinking on
intimidating this being plus size,

579
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,780
you don't a golden glory.

580
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,420
Super impressed with her background.

581
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:15,141
Is She a striker?

582
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:16,460
First to striker?

583
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:18,050
She's an att girl.

584
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,280
Trains at American top team,

585
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,620
which she cannot wear shorts.

586
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,573
And then weird.

587
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,391
Even in boxing,

588
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,680
you'd have Cronk on your shorts.

589
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,280
They should have their
fucking gym on the shore.

590
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,280
She got out of your gym in the
short one on top of Reebok.

591
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:31,010
You should definitely have your
gym and your shorts and respect.

592
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,390
Right.

593
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,150
I agree.

594
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,260
Why don't Laura firefighters
practice running backwards?

595
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,490
It's because it takes too long.

596
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,323
It's hard.

597
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,880
Anytime I've ever heard of this.

598
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,271
Well Eddie,

599
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,070
you know how a lot of dudes
don't like to be on the bottom.

600
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,563
Same thing.

601
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:44,991
Yeah,

602
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:45,801
but things people don't,

603
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:46,160
they want it.

604
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,490
Don't,

605
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,820
don't want to do things that they
don't like to do in training.

606
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,790
And especially like running backwards.

607
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,570
It's not fun.

608
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,440
It's not fun.

609
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,600
It's also going to take a while
to get a good stretch out,

610
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,081
dude.

611
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:01,370
We now run backwards just for your cardio.

612
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,590
I realized real early,

613
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,151
uh,

614
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:05,300
in doing taekwondo,

615
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,610
how exhausting it is to
try to move backwards.

616
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,320
Cause I used to spar with this kid.

617
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:11,810
It was a really good boxer
and he used to beat my ass,

618
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,180
but I was always moving
backwards from him.

619
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,730
I was always moving backwards
and I would get exhausted.

620
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:17,001
I was like,

621
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,530
why am I getting so fucking tired?

622
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,730
And then after a while I realize
like it's gotta be connected,

623
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,170
not just to his pressure,

624
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:26,840
but also the fact that I'm
moving backwards so much.

625
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,310
It's not just a physical thing.

626
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,350
And then as I get better at boxing,

627
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:31,400
I definitely found it.

628
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:31,871
That was the kid.

629
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:32,990
He's like a lot more energy.

630
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:33,490
Like your shit.

631
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,690
Like when I move forward,

632
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,480
if I move forward near the counter
punch and you're going backwards,

633
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:42,170
you're taking way more steps than
I am deaf for doing way more work.

634
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,060
Definite of Muhammad Ali was doing it.

635
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
I think that everybody would do that,

636
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:45,660
right?

637
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,493
But,

638
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,383
and he used to run,

639
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,601
oh,

640
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:48,600
the running backwards thing.

641
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,420
Men turn.

642
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,570
So there's a lot of coaches,

643
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,040
a lot of coaches work on that stuff now.

644
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,300
They even do it on treadmills.

645
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,010
They do like sprints on
treadmills running backwards.

646
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,770
Also less,

647
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,420
uh,

648
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,580
wear and tear on your knees.

649
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,563
Is it really backwards?

650
00:16:59,710 --> 00:16:59,940
Well,

651
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,570
I guess you kind of have to
go on your balls of your foot.

652
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,560
Run it backwards.

653
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,080
Yeah.

654
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,060
Can you can't go heal.

655
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:07,010
You'll fucking go flipping backwards.

656
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,600
Football players practice running back.

657
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:08,901
Yeah,

658
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:09,670
definitely.

659
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,790
Cornerback certain positions.

660
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,624
Yeah.

661
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,600
I want to ask you,

662
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,570
you want to ask this
question before I forget it.

663
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,000
You trained at Jake Glaser's place,

664
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:17,600
Huh?

665
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:17,851
Dude,

666
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:19,700
that was watching Instagram of that today.

667
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:20,540
This is a joint.

668
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,910
Did Jay Glazer just set
that up all himself?

669
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,460
Uh,

670
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,040
I mean he's definitely the captain of
that ship to what a fucking huge move that

671
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:28,581
is for him.

672
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,620
That's a great fifth.

673
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:30,171
Spell it too.

674
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:31,100
Right off sunset there.

675
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,690
But Pink Taco reason I brought it up.

676
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:35,510
They had these football players
doing these exact same drills.

677
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:38,960
They were running forwards and backwards
and doing all this crazy sprinting shit

678
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,100
where it's all like,

679
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,341
you know,

680
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:40,480
the,

681
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:40,721
the,

682
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,980
the coach could tell you backwards.

683
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:43,600
Go forward,

684
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,330
back and they working on this stuff out.

685
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,270
I'm all reaction stuff.

686
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,491
Oh,

687
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:47,350
look at this.

688
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,410
This is heavy duty Shit.

689
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:49,950
Well,

690
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,070
you

691
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,570
guys obviously didn't
see that there's a trail,

692
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,404
almost,

693
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,810
almost all of their sports
practice going backwards.

694
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,830
Yeah.

695
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,090
Well now that I think of the quarter,

696
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:58,940
lots of a lot of fighters do.

697
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,140
Obviously Connor does.

698
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:02,470
Connor is really good at moving
backwards and moving forward,

699
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,200
but there's no doubt as we both nice
moving backwards costs more energy.

700
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:09,750
And Connor,

701
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,321
Connor Five,

702
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,430
that movement coach.

703
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:11,860
Huh?

704
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,693
Did he?

705
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,201
Yeah,

706
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:13,580
he was like,

707
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:13,950
ah,

708
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,000
looking back on it,

709
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,300
I think any of you born in the gym
instead of climbing fucking law

710
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,990
from what I heard that you know what?

711
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,870
I'm good on climbing trees and shit
cause you to defense the other guys,

712
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:28,980
the law guy or woman,

713
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:29,814
the core

714
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,070
Hula hoops and okay,

715
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,973
I disagree.

716
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,000
There's a lot of merit
in the movement movement.

717
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,720
I'm just saying the guy who was the
head of this movement movement was like,

718
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,673
I'm good.

719
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,000
I got some shit to folks site.

720
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:45,601
Here's why.

721
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:46,950
I think there's some merit to it.

722
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:47,971
Two reasons.

723
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:49,350
One break dancers.

724
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,530
One of the things in Jujitsu and
Eddie Bravo old test to this.

725
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,070
We had a bunch of breakdancers
start training and uh,

726
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,170
Eddie was like the first to comment on it.

727
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,490
Like how crazy strongly are and weird
way they can move their body so well

728
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,570
it wasn't just one or two of them.

729
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,240
They all got good and then I've
got a couple more sense there's,

730
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,140
they'd come in and they're
really good right away.

731
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,700
They well their motor skills
too with that movement.

732
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,240
So fucking strong.

733
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,410
So much shit from their bodies and
memorizing stuff been on my head and slow

734
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:26,544
motion dude.

735
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,280
For sure.

736
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,630
I do.

737
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,730
I do one hand,

738
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,770
one hand handstands.

739
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,190
Those guys were ridiculous like this.

740
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,063
You guys have met,

741
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,960
they're doing back flips.

742
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,070
They're doing one hand to hand sand.

743
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:39,330
They're jumping on one hand.

744
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:39,660
They do.

745
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,670
I mean have you ever seen his black belt?

746
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:42,570
Richard Martinez?

747
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,470
No.

748
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,780
Tell him and Geo Jail Martinez called
Richie Martinez brothers that been break

749
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,260
dancing their whole lot and tell him,

750
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,230
tell him Tom Eddy.

751
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,190
Ridiculous.

752
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,180
Cause I know as an instructor,

753
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:57,540
no instructor wants to
give black belts early.

754
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,070
Nobody does.

755
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,640
It isn't something that you wanted to
because that's a reflection on you.

756
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,210
Yes.

757
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,280
And if you give it too
early and they get crushed,

758
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,280
you look back,

759
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:06,571
you're like,

760
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:09,810
I'm not going to give you a black belt
until I could make sure that you don't

761
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:10,644
embarrass me.

762
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,580
I know what I mean.

763
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:11,830
Right.

764
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,050
So last thing we wanted to,

765
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,870
we're back on the fight here real quick
because there was a some sort of a

766
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:16,321
change.

767
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:17,370
We explain what happened.

768
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:17,611
Jimmy,

769
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:21,150
we had a change challenge from Fox sports
two to Fox sports one why we do the

770
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,350
Nascar race.

771
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:22,471
Oh,

772
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,020
it just took over and so fox
changed it and mid fight.

773
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,620
This is a bra like confusing.

774
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,513
What?

775
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,210
They changed your fire
Jetson that's hired.

776
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,820
Who the fuck changes a fight like
this and mid fight that just happened.

777
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,470
That is so crazy.

778
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,820
People are going to miss this.

779
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,060
They're going to not go to Fox sports
one and they're going to miss this.

780
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,170
They go to take a piss.

781
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:49,090
They come back or they're
talking like I was missed it.

782
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,391
I was like,

783
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:50,224
what the fuck?

784
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,770
Thank you Jamie for being so on.

785
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,430
You don't have a young
Jamie living with you.

786
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,790
Screw Jamie's something else.

787
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,360
Anyway,

788
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,631
anyway,

789
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,500
I got to step up my dance
case coaches or break dancing,

790
00:20:59,520 --> 00:20:59,710
but,

791
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,440
but to these guys it'll pour towel.

792
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,470
That guy that's soup.

793
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,100
Extreme movement of movement got extreme.

794
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,030
It would be what these guys are doing
to music and he's this super crazy,

795
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,040
like the ultimate uh,

796
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,580
uh,

797
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,420
that movement should,

798
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:14,430
that you could possibly do.

799
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,263
I wish I could break.

800
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,203
Oh,

801
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,050
hello.

802
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,900
Oh,

803
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,060
she kicked him right in the solar plexus.

804
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,400
Goddamn Latino's.

805
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,741
Tough.

806
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,550
So tough.

807
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,061
Oh my God.

808
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:25,541
It's cops.

809
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,141
Fire needs it.

810
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:27,430
She gets cracked with an elbow.

811
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:27,740
Gosh,

812
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,351
she's called it.

813
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:31,570
What is a beast but tells
the turnout Matt's fault are,

814
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,583
Oh my God.

815
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:33,700
Ooh.

816
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,660
Shovel Hook.

817
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,190
Oh,

818
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,553
cool.

819
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,880
Oh,

820
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,810
you're not allowed to
kick the what happened?

821
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,050
I guess you're not allowed
to kick there in the table.

822
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:50,950
You definitely know.

823
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:51,784
It's like the nuts

824
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,860
that can't be tried girl.

825
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,790
That can't be true.

826
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,490
Which can be kicked me there man.

827
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,403
It's

828
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,141
very good.

829
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:02,740
Fight a minute.

830
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,551
That's not true.

831
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:05,170
Is it spoke to him.

832
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,400
No hitting in the clan.

833
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:08,290
You fucks get kicked me.

834
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:08,471
Sure.

835
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:10,410
Taking that titty titties.

836
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,931
You can't do it.

837
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:11,270
Can't.

838
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,710
What happened?

839
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:11,840
What?

840
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,500
What happened?

841
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,110
You punted the,

842
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,420
those are really big,

843
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,973
really nice.

844
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,100
Blake and Brandon,

845
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,053
they showed the rape.

846
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,390
A girl kicked another go right in the
ground with they shut the written the show

847
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:26,200
with guys.

848
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,370
They do it in slow motion.

849
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:28,204
Super Slow Mo.

850
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,183
Oh

851
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,470
God damn it.

852
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,750
Oh my God.

853
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,100
That was a crazy ending.

854
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:42,010
Tell there was a beast that
wasn't a titty shows a body shot.

855
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:44,080
I think she broke her rib
with that one shot earlier.

856
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:46,640
I think I need the replay
or somewhere in that fund.

857
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,620
That was a beast of a fight.

858
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:51,723
Could Lord,

859
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,850
she went relentless elbow.

860
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,010
This is the day where people online go,

861
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:57,221
hey,

862
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:59,260
you fucks occasionally watched the fight.

863
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,160
This was crazy.

864
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,270
This is a crazy fight.

865
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,163
My Dad,

866
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,190
oh my God,

867
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,210
she's so tough.

868
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:05,044
That girl.

869
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,440
Let me see this fucking
spartan kicked to the tit.

870
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,920
This was tough.

871
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,470
Boom.

872
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,280
That's right.

873
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,580
That's right in the stomach.

874
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,000
That's the second time she did that too.

875
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,823
She comes,

876
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,810
she's going to stop this and
she comes erection to the thigh.

877
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:20,980
That's her opening move.

878
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,851
That's beautiful.

879
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:22,780
You see the first one?

880
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:23,231
Watch this,

881
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:24,730
boom out,

882
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,571
but check this out.

883
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,220
Run need of the thigh.

884
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,540
Why would she try spinning back jacked?

885
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,300
I mean,

886
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,580
you mean Valerie?

887
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,473
You can't use her.

888
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,580
She started drop to the ground.

889
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,400
Can't turn your back.

890
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,230
She got,

891
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,560
she got hurt with a bad shot to
the body earlier in that round.

892
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,030
I think she was really hurt.

893
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:43,780
Oh yeah.

894
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,010
I think she's so fucking tough.

895
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,070
I think she was really,

896
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,940
really her son.

897
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,440
She's weird.

898
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,371
She's tough.

899
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:49,941
My God,

900
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:50,381
she's tough.

901
00:23:50,381 --> 00:23:53,540
That is the first time I've ever seen
someone run at someone who is hurt and

902
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,450
open with a need of the thigh
and then a spinning back.

903
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:59,690
Fist girl's got a complete Moitai game,

904
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:00,230
man.

905
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,640
That's a complete game.

906
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,130
Like she's thinking and
all these different angles.

907
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:05,300
She doesn't have a gun fight.

908
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:05,500
Yeah,

909
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,370
she doesn't have like a limited approach,

910
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:07,851
bro.

911
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:08,960
Speaking of fun fights,

912
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,760
Anthony Rumble Johnson
out against what happen?

913
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,270
I don't fucking know.

914
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,030
Ruined my day.

915
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,220
What happened?

916
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:16,970
No idea.

917
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,600
Injury.

918
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,231
Do you know Jamie?

919
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:18,951
The injury for sure.

920
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,200
He pulled out a little far
out to pull out though.

921
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:21,740
Huh?

922
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,470
They can't break a leg or some
shit or something really wrong.

923
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,510
Pull out this early is nuts,

924
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:27,140
right?

925
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,771
God Damn.

926
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:28,431
I wanted to see that.

927
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:28,970
Fine.

928
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,740
It's my number one fight
this year from the day.

929
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:32,650
Make Gustafson versus Glover.

930
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,820
They just gave Gustin some bullshit.

931
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,930
Then I'm saying dog,

932
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,933
Bro.

933
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,530
Let's get it moving.

934
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,190
Let's chill.

935
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,023
Let's roll.

936
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,870
Let's get back to an Oh shit
fund out that bats is the sun.

937
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,600
That's an old weeding shit fight.

938
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,860
[inaudible]

939
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,851
very much in the game.

940
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:50,541
He's been real quiet.

941
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,530
I just announced the fight.

942
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,533
One of the best.

943
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,540
He's right up there.

944
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:53,751
Look,

945
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:55,490
you went five hard rounds of John Jones.

946
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:56,710
Five hard rounds of DC.

947
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,171
He's amazing.

948
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:58,210
He's seeing the world for sure.

949
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,450
He lost to rumble,

950
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:00,284
but guess what?

951
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,660
Everybody who rumbled hits
like that goes night night,

952
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:02,990
but do you,

953
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,090
did you see that they
played it over and over?

954
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,870
He did get headbutted two magazines.

955
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,733
What looks like it?

956
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,151
Yeah,

957
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:08,984
it looks like it.

958
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,913
It looks like it.

959
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,611
It's sorry.

960
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:11,211
It's hard to see.

961
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:13,310
Like I've looked at it and thought
that it didn't look like a head,

962
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,390
but then I've looked at it.

963
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:16,400
I said the punch land at first for sure,

964
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,860
but it looked like definitely collided.

965
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:18,630
Yes,

966
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,340
it's tough.

967
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,650
It's just weapon thing touches.

968
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,090
Anyone like that though I
think they fight 10 times.

969
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:24,560
You're going a different result each time.

970
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,900
Maybe that's a good
breakdown of it in slow mo,

971
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,450
but it was hard to see like if the
right hand landed first or the the head

972
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,323
Butler,

973
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,561
what did we think?

974
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:34,340
What did we do?

975
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,050
Headbutt and you didn't
and but the more replayed,

976
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,390
it almost starts siding with you.

977
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:38,630
I,

978
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,650
I always thought it was a headbutt.

979
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,960
I got so high once I watched
the big foot footage,

980
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:42,794
I thought it was real.

981
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,803
I was so hot.

982
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:45,891
I was like,

983
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,230
maybe I've been making
fun of me all the time.

984
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,880
So she just took some shots in my stomach,

985
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,850
but I am wow.

986
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,691
It cm punk,

987
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:57,650
the new a Tarzan.

988
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,550
See if he fails every water test.

989
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,460
Cm punk is a very
reasonable looking athlete.

990
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,941
You know what I mean?

991
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,740
Looking at the WWE guys kind of small,

992
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,221
not yeah.

993
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:10,391
Dot.

994
00:26:10,391 --> 00:26:10,791
I'm just saying,

995
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:12,480
not like good luck and yeah,

996
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,910
not a bad looking guy is handsome,

997
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:14,960
but what I'm saying his body.

998
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:15,260
Yeah.

999
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,640
It's like a guy works out a lot.

1000
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,920
He doesn't look like Battista.

1001
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,030
Exactly.

1002
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,350
Exact steroid guild.

1003
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:21,930
Who's the,

1004
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,270
who's the other Bobby Lashley.

1005
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,200
That's another one.

1006
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,990
Like Jesus Louise's how
he's fighting for the door.

1007
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:27,740
Those fighting,

1008
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,210
a lot of events were built or,

1009
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:29,850
oh,

1010
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,860
we'll leave that Friday.

1011
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:31,971
Oh,

1012
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:32,840
so you know what it was?

1013
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:32,991
No,

1014
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:33,141
no.

1015
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:35,120
It was face and then she pulled her,

1016
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:35,954
brought her,

1017
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,501
her boob,

1018
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:37,700
popped out of the Bra.

1019
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,241
Wow.

1020
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:39,074
Respect.

1021
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,470
Respect to call the Woodford.

1022
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:40,791
She's like,

1023
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:41,510
what happened?

1024
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,901
Look at this.

1025
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:42,734
And then that.

1026
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,230
But there was another one to
the stomach that was that,

1027
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,360
that she buckled.

1028
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,600
There was another shot and
to the stomach before that,

1029
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:52,421
that made her buckle.

1030
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:56,070
So there was more than one shot to the
stomach that had Valerie and trouble.

1031
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:59,110
I'm pretty sure me and her
have the exact same fade.

1032
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,653
Not Weird.

1033
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,470
Had the same year,

1034
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,303
same year above

1035
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,560
c getting good at this.

1036
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,290
Sometimes it's nothing.

1037
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,130
Sometimes better to say nothing.

1038
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,450
I'm a big fan.

1039
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,000
I think she's cute.

1040
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:21,991
She's gangsters.

1041
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:25,050
Fucked with a spinning
back fist off the cage.

1042
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,100
Back door.

1043
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,280
It would look unrealistic.

1044
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:29,671
I know,

1045
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:30,390
right?

1046
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,130
Her combinations were beautiful too.

1047
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:36,690
So technical needed the butt and then
she threw a right and a left elbow and

1048
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:40,140
then a spinning back to
stay close as a thigh.

1049
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,010
It was a knee to the thigh,

1050
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,570
so she tees off in her.

1051
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:44,730
This is the first one,

1052
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,061
right?

1053
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:46,290
This is the first knocked out.

1054
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,550
Now watch his shot to the bike.

1055
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,980
That's the one that's
the one turned around.

1056
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,260
Oh my goodness.

1057
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,510
Oh my goodness.

1058
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,560
That's fight club.

1059
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,790
What a combination.

1060
00:27:59,791 --> 00:27:59,911
Well,

1061
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,260
she just got hurt real bad there,

1062
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:01,530
man.

1063
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,400
She had people get hurt all the time.

1064
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:04,790
You never turn your back and run.

1065
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:05,821
Well listen man,

1066
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:06,840
I'm not forgiving it.

1067
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:07,231
I'm just saying,

1068
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:08,580
I think our guts were on fire,

1069
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,510
you know,

1070
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,410
drop to the ground.

1071
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,251
It's one of those things,

1072
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:11,521
man.

1073
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:14,070
It's like she's just
turning in that moment.

1074
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:17,140
She got hurt bad then fade or melodyne.

1075
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:17,300
No,

1076
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,100
fuck man.

1077
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,100
What the fuck happened?

1078
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,500
I don't auto caught him with a swift
left hook and he was on queer street bell

1079
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,090
on social in that fight.

1080
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,733
And what happened?

1081
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,510
I mean you're in Russia.

1082
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:31,341
Russian judges.

1083
00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:31,740
It was,

1084
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,390
I mean they would have
stopped it if it was here.

1085
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,120
Federal loses that fight was
kidding with the Bella Donna.

1086
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,080
But no,

1087
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,700
Maldonado was a good boxer man.

1088
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,900
He caught him with that right hand,

1089
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,410
caught him with a nice short right
hand and beat him up on the ground.

1090
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,350
He was out there,

1091
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,260
was out on the Ct.

1092
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,740
He looked bad and then he got up at one
point in time and Fabio hit him with a

1093
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:54,390
bomb and had his legs wobbling and he
did the chicken dance across the octagon

1094
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,460
and he still lost a decision.

1095
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,300
Yep.

1096
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:57,840
It's the rush.

1097
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,141
I mean,

1098
00:28:58,141 --> 00:28:59,970
but does the second two rounds?

1099
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:00,930
He didn't do a lot,

1100
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,310
but still that first rounds,

1101
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,660
ten eight if not,

1102
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:04,690
can I give a head for,

1103
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:08,460
it might be ten seven it might be
ten seven at least tense because he,

1104
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:09,350
he had him like,

1105
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:09,490
well,

1106
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,111
I don't know man.

1107
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:13,500
When did someone get a ten seven
that would be so close to a stop.

1108
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,150
If that's in the u s that fight stops.

1109
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,840
I think,

1110
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,160
well just say that,

1111
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:20,550
but then there's like Frankie
Edgar Gray Maynard [inaudible] God,

1112
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,750
he's the ref or whatever
the fuck did I say Tarzan?

1113
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,633
Tarzan.

1114
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,810
Tarzan trailer guys.

1115
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:25,190
This movie.

1116
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,023
So realistic.

1117
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,701
Yeah,

1118
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:30,360
because last guy who with a
white man like wait a minute,

1119
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:30,840
back up.

1120
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,040
Is that fucking Snoop Dogg?

1121
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:32,850
Nah Man.

1122
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,661
Samuel Jackson.

1123
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:34,494
Your highest fun.

1124
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,760
I looked at it the very
last second and I said,

1125
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,591
look at this.

1126
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:41,080
What is this?

1127
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,561
Oh my God,

1128
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,310
he's dead.

1129
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,040
He just jumped to the air and
he's going to collide with a,

1130
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:45,310
Oh,

1131
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,060
the chimp,

1132
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,560
right?

1133
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:46,901
I see.

1134
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:47,650
I can't watch it.

1135
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,610
Was that a chimp or a gorilla?

1136
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,800
Gorilla.

1137
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,580
Okay.

1138
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,413
He's dead.

1139
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,530
He's dead.

1140
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:53,950
That's like,

1141
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,630
why don't you just like
Headbutt an airplane?

1142
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,860
They just tackled a grill.

1143
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:57,041
Yeah,

1144
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:01,110
cause it's a 600 pound animal or to
send me the Jackson five or confused it.

1145
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,510
Very young sandwich.

1146
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,920
Fucking look at this
gorilla visitor graphic.

1147
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,630
He's going to go to war with this girl.

1148
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,021
Bitch.

1149
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:09,730
Know what real is going towards for him.

1150
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:09,911
Oh,

1151
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:10,744
for him?

1152
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,730
Why did they collide then?

1153
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,620
Different Grill?

1154
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,020
Uh,

1155
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,141
no,

1156
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:14,741
I think it's a,

1157
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:17,800
they're trying to stake their
territory for the hot grill.

1158
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,660
You know what man is,

1159
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:22,030
he picked the wrong primate
to have a war with her.

1160
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:23,170
Fucking scary man.

1161
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,531
Yeah.

1162
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,600
Those things are just way too big.

1163
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,980
Like the idea of an 800
pound human is terrifying,

1164
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,900
but an 800 pound gorilla.

1165
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,050
What's the like,

1166
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,060
is that like the biggest thing yet?

1167
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:34,781
We've gone over this.

1168
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:39,730
I think it was like 500 I think we
decided about five 606 six 30 that was the

1169
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:39,971
issue,

1170
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:40,091
right?

1171
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:41,340
There was quite a few different nations.

1172
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:45,480
Like one of them said 801 of them said
500 or a couple of big ones I think are

1173
00:30:45,481 --> 00:30:46,314
like that big

1174
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:48,971
fucking average.

1175
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:49,900
What's the outlier though?

1176
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,670
Like the mountain,

1177
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,990
but who was the mountain back,

1178
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,420
right?

1179
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,253
Yeah,

1180
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,660
the King Kong out there in this bitch.

1181
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,590
Do you watch game of Thrones?

1182
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,311
I don't.

1183
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:59,100
I'm 33 there's Dragon Mountain.

1184
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,110
You get to a certain age and
dragons no longer become fun

1185
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,120
and cool and I'm like,

1186
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,473
oh no,

1187
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,003
I never missed.

1188
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,060
I've never missed an episode.

1189
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,580
I never miss an episode bearish.

1190
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,433
My fine.

1191
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,311
It's awesome.

1192
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:18,730
Dare.

1193
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,900
I used to look forward to it.

1194
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:22,810
Like I shut everything
down and by the way,

1195
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,823
how many seasons?

1196
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,090
Don't even know.

1197
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,751
Six.

1198
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,620
I've seen every one of them.

1199
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:27,790
The mother of dragons,

1200
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,120
dude,

1201
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,520
it's called ABC shows and
I've seen every one of them.

1202
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:30,941
Dude,

1203
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:31,300
she can,

1204
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,040
she can step in a fire and be fine.

1205
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,750
425 six foot tall.

1206
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:34,960
Yeah,

1207
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,920
that's one.

1208
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:38,290
But if you go to another one
or like you go to Wikipedia

1209
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,700
mountain rose got up to
600 pounds for 25 what?

1210
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:43,690
I want you to Google please.

1211
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,370
What is the largest gorilla?

1212
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,690
Biggest Grill of all time?

1213
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,303
It's over six.

1214
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,480
What's the Brock Lesnar?

1215
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,030
Cause there's a mighty mouse.

1216
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,430
Johnson is a Brock Lesnar.

1217
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,960
Well this is tricky because
that can be a realist.

1218
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,410
Jamie was it said Jamie,

1219
00:31:59,230 --> 00:31:59,880
Jamie,

1220
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,611
600 pounds,

1221
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:01,000
man,

1222
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,720
I can't read him.

1223
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,020
That's him.

1224
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,040
He's out of shape though.

1225
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:03,521
Was it?

1226
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,310
Say Jamie doesn't say his weight.

1227
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,430
Bull Shit dear there.

1228
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,970
Biggest grill ever found in the world.

1229
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:10,381
I'll tell you what.

1230
00:32:10,381 --> 00:32:12,190
I'd rather fuck with that
grill in a crocodile.

1231
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,211
Yeah,

1232
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:13,421
dude,

1233
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:14,920
I am so not in the fucking [inaudible].

1234
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,250
I used to be into alligators.

1235
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,040
Not Anymore.

1236
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,680
What we were talking
about that that thing,

1237
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,501
shoulders,

1238
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:23,050
two year old kid that got sucked
into the water and Orlando.

1239
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,220
I blame the parents a little bit.

1240
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,320
It's Florida Sun.

1241
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:26,711
Yeah,

1242
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,450
just maybe they're not from Florida,

1243
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,140
Nebraska,

1244
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,973
Nebraska.

1245
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,313
Oh Man,

1246
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:32,771
look,

1247
00:32:32,771 --> 00:32:33,131
if you don't,

1248
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:34,820
if you're not around
those goddamn monsters,

1249
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,560
you don't know.

1250
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,280
Hey Disney,

1251
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,330
let's go ahead and put up some
crocodiles side and just be safe.

1252
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,550
If they had signs that
said don't know swimming,

1253
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:41,720
but they didn't have signs that said,

1254
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,500
beware of alligators.

1255
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:43,821
By the way,

1256
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:45,920
in one of my more retarded
moments on the show,

1257
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,120
we were trying to figure out a how a
crocodile is not the biggest lizard when

1258
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,520
there's so much bigger than
Komodo dragons were like,

1259
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:57,170
why is a Komodo dragon not
nearly as big as a crocodile,

1260
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:58,990
but they called the biggest
loser is crocodiles,

1261
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,050
arm reptiles,

1262
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,973
reptiles.

1263
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,550
Lizards,

1264
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,150
but lizard is a very specific testing.

1265
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,180
Elizabeth.

1266
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,630
It is a little bit,

1267
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,503
no,

1268
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,950
I definitely did when we were doing that.

1269
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,100
Those are on board.

1270
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,203
Raise a reptile.

1271
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,811
Oh listen,

1272
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:12,644
I definitely,

1273
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,200
definitely got cropped out.

1274
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,034
It's not a,

1275
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,610
I wouldn't even think that.

1276
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,001
Well,

1277
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:17,451
it lizards,

1278
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:18,284
definitely reptile.

1279
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:18,740
Oh,

1280
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,390
crocodile is not a lizard,

1281
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:21,470
which is the sales rep.

1282
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:22,220
Dot.

1283
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,940
That's what we're saying.

1284
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,691
Different species,

1285
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:24,410
different species.

1286
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:24,850
Yeah.

1287
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,010
So,

1288
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,960
but it's like one of
those things like monkeys,

1289
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:28,730
like saying monkeys or chimps.

1290
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,270
Yeah.

1291
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:29,780
What?

1292
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,830
I just got it wrong.

1293
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,290
You know,

1294
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:31,540
they're,

1295
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,500
they're obviously the same kind of thing,

1296
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,573
you know,

1297
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,781
classification.

1298
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:36,051
Right.

1299
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:38,210
So apes don't have tails,

1300
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,840
right.

1301
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,673
So you have,

1302
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,880
you have baboons,

1303
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,743
Gibbons.

1304
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,400
He's not real though.

1305
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:45,890
It's not even a real word that
the issue is like monkeys,

1306
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,790
not a scientific term
to chip it to Sydney.

1307
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,030
Simeon's there's all sorts
of different primates.

1308
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,780
Right.

1309
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,140
But,

1310
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,360
but the way it's described now,

1311
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:54,410
like the way it's being accepted,

1312
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:56,470
there was an article about it
mean maybe you could find it,

1313
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:57,020
Jamie,

1314
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,540
that all apes or monkeys,

1315
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:00,800
but not all monkeys or apes.

1316
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,480
All apes or monkeys.

1317
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:02,831
Not all.

1318
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:03,550
Not all marketers,

1319
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,720
so you could call it makes sense.

1320
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,930
This is in the classification.

1321
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,793
This is the way there.

1322
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,360
They were going off in this article.

1323
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,580
Like you could call a chimp or a person.

1324
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,660
You can call it a monkey,

1325
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,620
but you can never call like
one of those spider monkeys.

1326
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,250
You can never call that an eight test.

1327
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,750
Not An ape.

1328
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,420
I wonder.

1329
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:18,770
Yeah.

1330
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,640
What's an orangutan?

1331
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,713
That's an SNA.

1332
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,030
That's an a chimpanzee mountain gorilla.

1333
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,080
Orangutan Gibbon,

1334
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,960
which is smaller that it looked
just as small as a lot of monkeys.

1335
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,430
And then um,

1336
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,270
uh,

1337
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,190
the Banaba,

1338
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,450
the,

1339
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,680
these are all apes and I think
baboons are apes right there.

1340
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,580
They're a weird one though.

1341
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,610
It's got a monkey to fuck the dog.

1342
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,401
Oh yeah,

1343
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:38,711
it doesn't,

1344
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:39,500
it I boots.

1345
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:39,950
Yeah,

1346
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:40,340
dude,

1347
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,720
we shot something with a dog on,

1348
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,100
remember we shot that thing with a Batman.

1349
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,320
The guy was missing fingers
are bit his fingers off.

1350
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,750
What you've been trainer.

1351
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:46,971
Yeah,

1352
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:50,730
he's missed two fingers that ripped his
fingers off because I'm male basil's

1353
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:52,940
deep and Bam nailed that into him.

1354
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,290
Hey.

1355
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:54,740
He goes,

1356
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:54,951
hey,

1357
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:55,200
you know,

1358
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,461
he said,

1359
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:55,731
he goes,

1360
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:56,630
don't look him in the eye,

1361
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,543
don't.

1362
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,983
And he goes,

1363
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,950
who wants a picture on it?

1364
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,793
Not me.

1365
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,980
But then dudes were lining up
and when dudes would line up,

1366
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,200
I swear to God the bathroom
take pictures like this.

1367
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:11,510
I got her fucking strong on that bitch
grabber and just like hold on their TV.

1368
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:13,923
Yes.

1369
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,301
Yes.

1370
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:17,240
And I went home video of this.

1371
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,300
That's me dressed as a warm girlfriend.

1372
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,320
100.

1373
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,700
His Dick was out the entire time.

1374
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,740
That's me dressed as a
woman with my baboons.

1375
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,310
Shine Boehner the entire time

1376
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,910
I'm sending it to myself
before he forgets.

1377
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,313
And by the way,

1378
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,030
those things are,

1379
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:35,560
um,

1380
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,590
teeth like for all the
shit teeth like this.

1381
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,340
The males

1382
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,240
will test you.

1383
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,320
The males will,

1384
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,220
will kind of go,

1385
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:41,610
you're,

1386
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,750
you're being dominant right now.

1387
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:44,130
I'm going to have to sink my teeth into,

1388
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,050
did the guy say to you all the guys,

1389
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:46,291
he goes,

1390
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,620
do not look this thing in
the go find me on your phone.

1391
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,703
Yeah,

1392
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,050
you looked that thing.

1393
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,013
He's gonna rip you.

1394
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,170
Fuck those things.

1395
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,820
Those things scare the shit out of me.

1396
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,350
They're not good.

1397
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:57,890
You know what though?

1398
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,740
It's kind of small.

1399
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,270
I felt like I could fuck them up.

1400
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,680
I felt like I could fuck them up,

1401
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,161
dude.

1402
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,030
Fuck that.

1403
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,440
No,

1404
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:03,520
no,

1405
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,170
no.

1406
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,003
Well you could,

1407
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,750
but not her damage damage,

1408
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,080
but the biting.

1409
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,650
Hey Bro,

1410
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,070
that's not the one I saw her.

1411
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:13,920
Fuck.

1412
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,070
You're not gonna be
able to deal with that.

1413
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,780
No.

1414
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,411
Fuck No.

1415
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:16,980
Okay.

1416
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,290
That's a special top.

1417
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,330
Oh my God.

1418
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,760
Screened is everybody at home.

1419
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,594
Get to see this.

1420
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,620
This is not what we're looking at.

1421
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:22,901
Let's not.

1422
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:24,810
We have fun when that thing is sinking.

1423
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:25,670
It's fucking case.

1424
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:27,450
Going to bite your neck apart.

1425
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,070
It's going to raise your neck a post.

1426
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,890
I had some water down.

1427
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,200
Fucking he was on meth
or something real skinny.

1428
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,070
That's all done.

1429
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:39,350
I'll take a bite from a German shepherd
over that fucking thing I will do.

1430
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:43,080
There's some of the most ferocious
priming their asses all pink.

1431
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,430
That's what they show you bitches.

1432
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:45,390
What time would they fight?

1433
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,990
They fight the leopards.

1434
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,420
Anymore questions you fox?

1435
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:48,721
Not well.

1436
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:49,471
Not only that dude,

1437
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:50,730
they trained dogs.

1438
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,790
Baboons are strange as
they're very intelligent.

1439
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:57,020
Some weird way that train fucking
dog with your other phone.

1440
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,130
Would you rather fuck with
that thing or a chimpanzee?

1441
00:36:59,250 --> 00:36:59,761
Oh Man,

1442
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:00,591
I don't want to fuck with me.

1443
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:01,424
And he's conversations,

1444
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,893
conversations.

1445
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,910
Pry him over a chimp though.

1446
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,241
No,

1447
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:06,750
I don't know.

1448
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,381
You gotta go.

1449
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:08,214
It's gotta be,

1450
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,840
it's gotta be bigger.

1451
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:09,991
Well,

1452
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:12,460
he's probably pretty fucking
strong to in unload of those guys.

1453
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,670
Bring up the goddamn chimps.

1454
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,780
Chimps will change your whole life.

1455
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,040
Chips,

1456
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,950
potato chips will will free you
have your face and your genitals.

1457
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,101
Yeah,

1458
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:20,461
I think.

1459
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:21,294
Okay.

1460
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,531
I think,

1461
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,050
I think I could come
over this fucking thing.

1462
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:24,751
That's what I'm saying.

1463
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:29,730
And Joe monkeys back and you think you
could choke a monkey out of me back for

1464
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:30,061
sure.

1465
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:30,211
Well,

1466
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:30,961
they're too little.

1467
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:32,220
A monkey monkeys,

1468
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:33,054
a little

1469
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,440
paints that picture of guns take on them.

1470
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,420
He got a dick on him there though.

1471
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,630
He does have a tick on him.

1472
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,310
Jeez.

1473
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,910
Look at that.

1474
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,140
But it's not skip leg day.

1475
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,640
That's kind of a dog.

1476
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,210
It's kind of a dog thing,

1477
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:51,540
right?

1478
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:51,811
Yeah,

1479
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,091
it is.

1480
00:37:52,091 --> 00:37:52,590
It's weird.

1481
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,261
It's weird.

1482
00:37:53,261 --> 00:37:54,180
That's like all wet.

1483
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,970
It's like real sticky and
what's like a werewolf?

1484
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,930
Kind of tight tummy.

1485
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,763
Tight tummy though.

1486
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:58,590
Whoa.

1487
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:03,000
Do you think that that was like that
the werewolf came from like baboons,

1488
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:03,470
rob,

1489
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:03,961
one of those?

1490
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:05,370
It has to be fucking huge.

1491
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:07,290
Don't in order for someone
to think it was that big.

1492
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,980
Well just boom person.

1493
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,980
The biggest Babylon you get baboons that
are 115 hundred and I think Jamie was

1494
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:15,400
the biggest baboons we've ever seen.

1495
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:16,200
Let's take a guess.

1496
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,070
I'm going to go with Brian.

1497
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:18,630
I think that sounds right to me.

1498
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,560
The math,

1499
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,251
how many males?

1500
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:21,300
Hundred and 10 pounds.

1501
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,490
I'm going to go ahead and say there's
a big boy out there about 180 pounds.

1502
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,333
Just diesel.

1503
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,540
Diabetes.

1504
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:27,871
Yeah,

1505
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,250
me with 10 pounds of teeth.

1506
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,480
Apes get diabetes.

1507
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,343
They get diabetes.

1508
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:31,980
They have problems.

1509
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,670
Yes.

1510
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,330
Why did they eat at insulin resistance?

1511
00:38:34,331 --> 00:38:38,500
I see and cause then in Sue's I'm
always appalled and zoos I've read,

1512
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,990
they don't feed their
there apes very well.

1513
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,100
This kid is a sturdy,

1514
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,210
sturdy young man.

1515
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,050
He is friends with my
friends who own Joe beef,

1516
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,590
which is one of the best restaurants on
the planet earth and it's in Montreal,

1517
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:51,424
Canada,

1518
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,300
Quebec,

1519
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,133
Tristar,

1520
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,940
I'll bone merciay.

1521
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,040
He fought in Montreal when we were
there and then came to the restaurant

1522
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:00,520
afterwards.

1523
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,990
What a Nice Guy,

1524
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:02,290
right?

1525
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,110
Like a genuine sweetheart of a guy.

1526
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,340
Really Good Jujitsu,

1527
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:07,570
super fucking strong,

1528
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,930
but bodied,

1529
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,180
bought up speaking,

1530
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,890
speaking of chimps bodied,

1531
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:12,940
but a super,

1532
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:14,440
super friendly,

1533
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,940
not like if you wanted to ask for like
someone to represent MMA to someone who

1534
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:23,941
thinks that MMA fighters were all thugs
and assholes like this young man is so

1535
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:28,570
polite and well spoken and smart and
just such a good guy and a really good

1536
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:29,830
fighter to the really good,

1537
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,230
you know,

1538
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,520
good final blew my mind is I got a chance
to kind of hang out with Paul Felder a

1539
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:33,880
little bit.

1540
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,091
Oh,

1541
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:34,490
great.

1542
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,440
Great Guy.

1543
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,270
And a theater major in college.

1544
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,320
Thank you very much.

1545
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:39,101
Smart.

1546
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:39,934
Super Smart.

1547
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,230
Tough Shit.

1548
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,921
Oh my God.

1549
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,920
It's like he's all of
185 pounds right now.

1550
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:44,590
Dude.

1551
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,071
He looks,

1552
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:46,030
so I said to him,

1553
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:46,510
I go,

1554
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,660
he looks like he's made like his
bones are made us woody gather Jamie,

1555
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,171
what'd we got?

1556
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:51,880
Jamie Chakma shock my at the,

1557
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:55,690
it says it's the one of the heaviest
and at most weighs about 99 pounds.

1558
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,640
Get the thing of my fucking face.

1559
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:02,641
99 [inaudible] 99 pound male baboons name
here and a peep out and here in a peep

1560
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:04,354
out of you.

1561
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,720
And,

1562
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,030
and good luck keeping that mouth and that,

1563
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,450
that non neck away from your face.

1564
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:11,680
And you definitely don't want
any of that because believe me,

1565
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:15,460
I had a pit bull that was 90
pounds and he was a giant problem.

1566
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,540
This job he wanted to get at this dog.

1567
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,520
So he bent the bars on my house,

1568
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,930
the wrought iron bars.

1569
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:27,670
I had to get a bar welded across the
perimeter of my fence because he realized

1570
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,730
that if he slams his
fucking fire hydrant head

1571
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:33,760
in between the bars,

1572
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:37,330
he can get them like
that watch fucking head.

1573
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:37,840
Right?

1574
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,371
So with dog,

1575
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:39,250
like that's all head.

1576
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,420
So once they get their head through his

1577
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,130
and his body got through,

1578
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:48,220
he bent the fucking bars like the hook.

1579
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,270
So I had this,

1580
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,500
why did you ask that thing?

1581
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,780
He's my best friend.

1582
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,571
His name was frank.

1583
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:54,040
He was a great name.

1584
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:54,790
Frank Sinatra.

1585
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,510
Frankie.

1586
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,710
He was a beast.

1587
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,710
I had to have a bar installed all
around the perimeter of my yard and a,

1588
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,520
this Israeli guy comes over to install it.

1589
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:03,701
He goes,

1590
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:04,534
what happened here?

1591
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,740
I said,

1592
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,760
the dog did it.

1593
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,190
He goes,

1594
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,023
the dog.

1595
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:08,621
He goes,

1596
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:09,454
how do they do?

1597
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:09,911
I go,

1598
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:10,840
he did it with his head.

1599
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:11,491
It's like,

1600
00:41:11,491 --> 00:41:12,324
get the fuck out of here.

1601
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,900
He looks over the dog,

1602
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:14,650
loose over the pellet.

1603
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,091
What the fund?

1604
00:41:15,091 --> 00:41:15,940
The dog just sitting there.

1605
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,651
He would hunt.

1606
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:18,740
Lizards passed away.

1607
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,220
He would just hunting lizard
bees all God damn day on it.

1608
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,651
On the map.

1609
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:22,750
It was a beast is,

1610
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:23,050
look,

1611
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,610
I am not a fan of dog fighting.

1612
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,660
I think it's a terrible,

1613
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:26,500
horrible thing.

1614
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,010
But what they did is they
engineered a super dog.

1615
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,460
Yeah,

1616
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,300
and that's what those things are.

1617
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:32,620
They are not like regular dogs.

1618
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,813
Fuck.

1619
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,060
I got him from a breeder.

1620
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,460
We like him creatine all times.

1621
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:36,730
Shit.

1622
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:36,920
No,

1623
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,150
I didn't have to do anything with him,

1624
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:38,361
man.

1625
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:40,070
He was a super genetic freak.

1626
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,360
Those dogs are,

1627
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,120
those dogs are different than any income,

1628
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,293
any other dog,

1629
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,190
a manmade dog.

1630
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:50,810
They're so goddamn smart and loyal and
they're so loyal and they love you so

1631
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:51,450
much.

1632
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,283
The game

1633
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,200
and the game bred dogs,

1634
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:54,411
you know,

1635
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,750
animals fight out of fear
of dominance came bred.

1636
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:57,291
Dogs fight.

1637
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,520
Cause they literally enjoy it.

1638
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,800
They're covered in blood,

1639
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,870
ripping each other apart and
they're wagging their tails.

1640
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:03,260
Man,

1641
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,041
I had a runny nose,

1642
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:04,251
man.

1643
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:05,530
I love pit bulls to,

1644
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,200
I don't want one now that you,

1645
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:07,850
but we'll figure it.

1646
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:10,370
I've come home to dead
dogs before God damn.

1647
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,720
Well they fought to the death killing
things to female and female named squeaky

1648
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:15,031
Fromme.

1649
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:17,010
Remember what was the founder,

1650
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,360
Brian Brian's founder fee
table with jaws rescue dog.

1651
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,330
And she was so sweet and I call it
a squeaky Fromme cause she'd been,

1652
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,270
there's a la shelter
that does not kill dogs.

1653
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:27,021
They try not to.

1654
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:27,800
It's awesome.

1655
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,401
And so,

1656
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:28,820
uh,

1657
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,481
Brian told me,

1658
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:29,870
dude,

1659
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,710
you got to get this dog.

1660
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:31,281
You're retarded.

1661
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,114
I know you're retarded.

1662
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,360
Avatar to come get this dog
out of a story of a fuck.

1663
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:36,800
I'll be right over and do
the minute you saw her.

1664
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,000
I drove down there,

1665
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,230
went down to the shelter,

1666
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,921
Olivier,

1667
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:40,281
Obama,

1668
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:41,480
RCA with the takedown.

1669
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,290
Real close.

1670
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,130
Good defense.

1671
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,660
This is that.

1672
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,070
This is another rough,

1673
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,190
why the Dow?

1674
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:49,910
So anyway,

1675
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,660
I go there and she's,

1676
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,000
she's so sweet.

1677
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:57,590
She's such a sweet dog and she's literally
chewed most of her bottom teeth out

1678
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,860
because she was trying to get out of this
cage and had around him and she didn't

1679
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:03,320
have any or very little teeth
at the bottom of her mouth.

1680
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,161
So I go,

1681
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:04,791
fuck this.

1682
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,870
And stocks coming home with me.

1683
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:06,680
How old was she?

1684
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,090
She was about eight months old.

1685
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,230
She was a beautiful dog.

1686
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:10,280
We were like an alligator with,

1687
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:10,791
with legs.

1688
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:11,900
She was so sweet,

1689
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:12,620
man.

1690
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,880
She was such a sweet,

1691
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:14,571
sweet dog.

1692
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:16,460
Like she was so kind to people,

1693
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,520
but she killed two dogs.

1694
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,571
Kills,

1695
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:20,871
kills,

1696
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:21,441
happens.

1697
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:22,151
That kind of dog.

1698
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:24,770
You never hear about a
female killing a male dog.

1699
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:25,371
That never happens.

1700
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:28,850
But I can't go to the
dog pen and away with 17.

1701
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:29,010
Dot.

1702
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:29,631
Exactly.

1703
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:34,631
I love today and I went to one those
puppy mills with your kids at the mall.

1704
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:35,301
Yeah.

1705
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:36,440
We walked in and you buy one?

1706
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,423
No,

1707
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,000
no,

1708
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,630
you don't want to buy one.

1709
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,650
But it's disturbing,

1710
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:39,921
you know.

1711
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:40,431
And just like,

1712
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:40,610
uh,

1713
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,860
maybe like 20 yards away
from the puppy mill.

1714
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:47,861
They had a protest sign and a table set
up to not buy puppies from puppy mills.

1715
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,020
You know,

1716
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,140
this field was next to that.

1717
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:51,741
How does that help?

1718
00:43:51,741 --> 00:43:52,790
That gets confusing

1719
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,790
fucking to view things

1720
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:57,951
like that.

1721
00:43:57,951 --> 00:44:00,200
It's like fucking Baskin Robbins.

1722
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,150
There's a fucking bear table.

1723
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:03,320
Save the email.

1724
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,520
Say the way I was mended.

1725
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:05,870
Pretzels become so popular.

1726
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,320
I don't fucking like pretzels.

1727
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,130
Cinnabon.

1728
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,820
It's like if one type of food that you
can guaranteed always fine at the mall.

1729
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,600
Pretzels,

1730
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,440
Panda Express,

1731
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,250
Cinnabon,

1732
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,061
Mrs. Fields,

1733
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:18,410
he's buttery ass pretzels.

1734
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:18,561
Oh,

1735
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:21,080
they show Kido kids in that
fucking malty there right now.

1736
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,620
All this shit that people aren't
really that into Olivia eyeball.

1737
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,400
Merciay but,

1738
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,150
but you know what?

1739
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,410
Walk,

1740
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,110
kill zone.

1741
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,280
This is one thing though.

1742
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,200
People might ice back control.

1743
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,170
Um,

1744
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,010
but people might not

1745
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,461
be into it,

1746
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,250
but the smell is super powerful.

1747
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,673
I lost it.

1748
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,060
Oh God.

1749
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,840
Oh custom.

1750
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,230
Ah Fuck Man.

1751
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:46,680
My cousin,

1752
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,101
the round,

1753
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,090
he's trying to keep it together.

1754
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,730
This dude can ground and
Scott at the time though,

1755
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,290
it's got a little time here and it does.

1756
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,330
That was a good escape.

1757
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,263
Escape.

1758
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,760
He didn't have constructed that idea.

1759
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,370
He let him spin out.

1760
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,423
Wow.

1761
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:05,940
Nice.

1762
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,773
Get up.

1763
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,110
How often it commentators call the truck?

1764
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,820
I don't know.

1765
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,091
I don't,

1766
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:12,870
I don't think so.

1767
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,490
This one of those weird positions.

1768
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,540
Very few people.

1769
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,630
Uzi Play

1770
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,463
that game.

1771
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,080
Oh Shit.

1772
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,343
Oof.

1773
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,940
Okay.

1774
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:26,030
You had Alan Belcher
almost twist during Paris.

1775
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:29,000
That and then Korean Zombie.

1776
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,013
This dude is like,

1777
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:32,631
yeah,

1778
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:33,650
he's very thick.

1779
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,720
What way does the 70 [inaudible] wow.

1780
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:36,411
No lightweight.

1781
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:36,501
What?

1782
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:37,670
55 wow.

1783
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,290
That's a giant 50 fiber.

1784
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,491
That's ridiculous.

1785
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:41,480
He must be for one.

1786
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,053
But those two fights,

1787
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,670
those two fights weren't
battles in the trunk.

1788
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:48,603
Yeah.

1789
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,030
There was no truck battles it,

1790
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,700
they went straight to the twister.

1791
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,330
Yeah.

1792
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,250
Oh Shit.

1793
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,521
Don't,

1794
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:56,300
don't go straight back.

1795
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,490
Oh county with the series.

1796
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,090
Tom's good.

1797
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:00,430
Goudis at killer.

1798
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:03,260
Piss out.

1799
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:03,710
It's bad.

1800
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:04,543
Damn fight.

1801
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:05,270
Jesus.

1802
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:05,930
This is good.

1803
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,471
That's my boy.

1804
00:46:06,471 --> 00:46:07,304
Frank Grillo.

1805
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,323
Purge three.

1806
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,560
They're doing another PR.

1807
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,430
You love the purge.

1808
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,560
The purge grilled.

1809
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:16,100
Glenn Criticizes the
game of death or Thrones,

1810
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:16,820
whatever it is.

1811
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,250
Hi.

1812
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,040
Sure.

1813
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,873
Came

1814
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,080
a week.

1815
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,310
You would love the purge.

1816
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,380
Purge could Ratchye happen.

1817
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,560
There are no fucking dragon go piece.

1818
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,490
We can talk shit about you.

1819
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,540
My boy right there.

1820
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,080
Frank Grillo.

1821
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,550
Go see Frank Grillo in the purge.

1822
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:36,883
Oh my God.

1823
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,480
I'm not thrilled with this season at all.

1824
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,420
Man Thrones.

1825
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,171
Oh my God.

1826
00:46:42,171 --> 00:46:42,981
The setting it up,

1827
00:46:42,981 --> 00:46:43,814
dude.

1828
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:44,663
They said,

1829
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:45,340
listen to this,

1830
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,173
I'll call it.

1831
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,170
There's these long on it,

1832
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,560
but there's going to be some long periods
where they're setting up some chaos.

1833
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,720
It's like the red wedding when
they went through the red,

1834
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:55,970
where they set everything up and be like,

1835
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:58,190
where's this going to
the Jesus when an Ngo,

1836
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,380
like what and the rock.

1837
00:46:59,590 --> 00:46:59,900
Well,

1838
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,111
no,

1839
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:00,711
it's going down.

1840
00:47:00,711 --> 00:47:01,910
They only have two more episodes,

1841
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,753
right?

1842
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,530
Yes.

1843
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,281
Two more episodes.

1844
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:06,320
I liked it that the girl who,

1845
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,700
the girl who has no name.

1846
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:08,240
Yes,

1847
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,650
she's becoming a savior.

1848
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,700
She's gone through,

1849
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,560
she's gone through the fire,

1850
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,470
lit up,

1851
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,440
says she heals up from getting stabbed.

1852
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:15,540
Oh,

1853
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,340
me too.

1854
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,173
Me Too.

1855
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,230
I can't take that many shots at the
stock came out after my surgery.

1856
00:47:21,231 --> 00:47:21,681
I'm thinking,

1857
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:21,800
yeah,

1858
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,311
bullshit.

1859
00:47:22,311 --> 00:47:22,700
Listen.

1860
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,680
All I'm asking is just try a little magic.

1861
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,120
That's when you give her a little match.

1862
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:29,770
All got the actress had some fucking
magic dust and she had laying around.

1863
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:29,980
They

1864
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,000
took some huge,

1865
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,290
huge steps.

1866
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,090
John Snow coming back from the day.

1867
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,030
That's,

1868
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,530
that's,

1869
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,780
that's almost show suicide.

1870
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,790
They get away with it and here's why.

1871
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:43,060
There's a rumor that Jon snow might be,

1872
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:43,541
Hey,

1873
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:44,620
easy with the fucking,

1874
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:45,770
I want any spoilers.

1875
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,101
No,

1876
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:46,161
no,

1877
00:47:46,161 --> 00:47:46,330
no.

1878
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:46,811
I don't want to hear it.

1879
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:47,251
God Damn word.

1880
00:47:47,251 --> 00:47:48,220
You're saying no,

1881
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,341
no,

1882
00:47:48,341 --> 00:47:48,910
no.

1883
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:49,743
Don't you spoiled it.

1884
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,351
You're right.

1885
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:50,681
You're right.

1886
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:50,981
Yeah.

1887
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:51,410
You son of,

1888
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,030
I heard it.

1889
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:52,451
I heard it.

1890
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:53,284
I want to hear shit.

1891
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,281
That's what,

1892
00:47:54,281 --> 00:47:55,260
that's what tell you something.

1893
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:55,841
He's a good,

1894
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:58,120
a good example of why
spoiler alerts fucking suck.

1895
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,440
You know what I saw the other night,

1896
00:47:59,441 --> 00:47:59,920
man,

1897
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,270
10 Cloverfield lane.

1898
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:01,810
Good.

1899
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:02,521
I say tweet up.

1900
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:03,340
Shit.

1901
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,480
It's fucking crazy.

1902
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,473
Really?

1903
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,120
Fuck the reviewers.

1904
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,190
That movie was crazy.

1905
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,043
I want to see,

1906
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:10,210
because I saw it and loved it.

1907
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:10,960
I loved it.

1908
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,640
John Goodman's in that to John
Goodman is one of the best actors.

1909
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:15,260
Amazing.

1910
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,160
He's a boy.

1911
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,080
Crazy motherfucker.

1912
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,280
Think about him from the big Lebowski.

1913
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,410
Think about him from this movie.

1914
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:25,750
King rast to when he plays crazy.

1915
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:27,820
He plays crazy at a level where I go,

1916
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,830
this mother fucker knows what that means.

1917
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,500
Remember him and Barney,

1918
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:31,780
uh,

1919
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,450
what was the movie?

1920
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,550
The cones on the stones.

1921
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:37,150
So not party Barton Fink,

1922
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,580
Nice Barbie,

1923
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:40,780
but Barton Fink,

1924
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:43,910
he was an amazing party
ups crunk about that.

1925
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,190
I love that movie.

1926
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:47,440
Flintstone.

1927
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,840
Barney rubble areas.

1928
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,630
But he's,

1929
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,970
he's a bad motherfucker,

1930
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,251
dude.

1931
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:51,761
I'm telling you,

1932
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:53,320
he gets to this crazy place,

1933
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:55,510
this edge of reality that you go,

1934
00:48:55,511 --> 00:48:56,080
wow,

1935
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,291
damn,

1936
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:56,891
I want to watch it.

1937
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:57,191
To me,

1938
00:48:57,191 --> 00:48:57,790
he's so,

1939
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,440
he seems so crazy that you like,

1940
00:48:59,441 --> 00:48:59,950
man,

1941
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,740
you have to really be craziest.

1942
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,593
This crazy.

1943
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,520
This guy's ever,

1944
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,170
he's felt those thoughts in his head.

1945
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:05,920
Right?

1946
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,161
You know,

1947
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:07,630
that's the issue with that Brad Pitt,

1948
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:08,980
like he plays like bad guys,

1949
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:10,570
but I don't think he has
a bad thought in his head.

1950
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,770
John Goodman does.

1951
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,050
Johnny Johnny Depp too.

1952
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:16,540
Obviously we all,

1953
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:20,650
we should all hope that John Goodman
does very well in life and never fails.

1954
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:24,700
It never gets to the point because it's
going to be in a position where he's in

1955
00:49:24,701 --> 00:49:27,160
a position where he's got nothing to
lose and he decides he wants to kill you.

1956
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:27,700
That's right.

1957
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,670
Because here's a thing that that guy
knows about and he puts it in these

1958
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:32,800
characters that exists in his head.

1959
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:33,820
He has has to water it.

1960
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:34,780
He's got,

1961
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,570
he's got a spree spree shooter
just dying to get size.

1962
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:38,404
I'll just run.

1963
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,570
Unless he's got a gun.

1964
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,660
You gotta see this movie,

1965
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:44,130
man.

1966
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:44,621
He's still,

1967
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:45,640
I'm posting it now.

1968
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,550
I'm still marveling over Obama nfcs body.

1969
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,830
I wasn't that thrilled
about the ending though,

1970
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,221
man.

1971
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,000
That was what?

1972
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,750
Out of nowhere.

1973
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,880
Let's not say a word about it
because I don't want it yet.

1974
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,361
I'll thank you,

1975
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:55,600
sir.

1976
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,261
I'm all over that.

1977
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:57,800
I want to see the [inaudible]
worried about this.

1978
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,180
The other movies and Dale's Maxine,

1979
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,063
Maxine,

1980
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,990
Max Cina my tracing.

1981
00:50:02,991 --> 00:50:03,210
Right.

1982
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,210
That's great.

1983
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,420
I just saw Prometheans for the first time.

1984
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,150
The movie's fucking dealt.

1985
00:50:09,151 --> 00:50:09,581
It's been out for,

1986
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:10,414
so she

1987
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,560
left me feeling like,

1988
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:15,820
I don't know man.

1989
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:16,810
The movie was so good.

1990
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:17,830
Alien was so good.

1991
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:20,440
The first one with Ridley
Scott and Tim Work of art.

1992
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,393
Yes.

1993
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,030
Yeah,

1994
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:23,920
but aliens the best.

1995
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,180
One of the best movies of all time.

1996
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,201
But that's what I'm saying.

1997
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:27,410
Set a high standard.

1998
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:27,830
My man,

1999
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,470
I know Bush,

2000
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,161
I'd be entertained.

2001
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:30,170
It was so good.

2002
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,590
It was so good that like if you think of
this one as being like the prologue to

2003
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:34,100
aliens,

2004
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:34,933
is that what it is?

2005
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,331
What's it called?

2006
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:35,451
No,

2007
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:36,950
it was pre previewed it a prequel.

2008
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:37,520
The prequel.

2009
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:37,851
What was it?

2010
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:38,620
A prequel.

2011
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,660
They're making another one to call.

2012
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:41,510
Log is the right word.

2013
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,320
No problems.

2014
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,660
The end.

2015
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,020
Yeah.

2016
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,171
Yeah.

2017
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:49,160
Well what happened in that
Dan was Prometheans set
before the alien movie guys.

2018
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:49,581
It ended,

2019
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:50,420
it was before,

2020
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:50,770
right?

2021
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,290
Because the got an alien.

2022
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:52,761
Oh yeah.

2023
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:54,770
Cause the aliens was
still fucking remember,

2024
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,260
anytime we have those aliens,

2025
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,600
those were some of the scariest
monsters the world's ever known.

2026
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,090
God,

2027
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,310
because when you think about bugs,

2028
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:01,790
man,

2029
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:02,990
you think about like a wasp,

2030
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:06,220
like there was a fucking a yellow
jacket by my pool the other day.

2031
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,230
I outweigh that thing by 1000000%.

2032
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,431
He still terrified.

2033
00:51:10,431 --> 00:51:12,760
I was so scared.

2034
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,471
I was horrified.

2035
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:16,520
My kids are screaming,

2036
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,783
pull up,

2037
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,230
pull up the Japanese,

2038
00:51:21,231 --> 00:51:22,064
yellow wasp.

2039
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,950
Brian told me about some wasp Pepsi walls,

2040
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,833
but Pepsis

2041
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,200
melt your face off the hawk,

2042
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,073
the traditional hawk.

2043
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,830
It's to trench the heart.

2044
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,370
It's called the trash in
the Hawk because they,

2045
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:35,470
they kill any trash.

2046
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,650
If you get stung,

2047
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,693
it is the most,

2048
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,130
it's the most painful sting
in the animal kingdom.

2049
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,140
Oh,

2050
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,960
full down.

2051
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,141
Yeah.

2052
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,040
You're going to fall down.

2053
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,363
You'll fall down.

2054
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,200
You'll fall down that night.

2055
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,110
It's like getting shot with a 45 I heard
a Guy Tarantula Hawk [inaudible] going

2056
00:51:52,111 --> 00:51:56,360
to be and they go back to that form
there in La and they're in Los Angeles.

2057
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,571
Wait,

2058
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:56,781
wait,

2059
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:57,350
wait,

2060
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:57,710
wait,

2061
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:58,430
wait.

2062
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:58,780
Why?

2063
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,460
Aha.

2064
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,500
Brian talk about the guy died.

2065
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,850
They're indigenous to la.

2066
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:02,810
To Arizona.

2067
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,531
Yes sir.

2068
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:04,191
To Utah.

2069
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:07,460
They're all over the
Americas in the trenches here

2070
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:09,860
too.

2071
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,080
That killed the trench on
my yard once accidentally.

2072
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,290
I got out of my house
once is at nighttime.

2073
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:20,180
I was walking towards my car and I heard
a crunch and I looked down and I had a

2074
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:23,390
torrential this size of a
fucking blue crab under my foot.

2075
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,321
I was like,

2076
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:25,154
you gotta be

2077
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,790
okay.

2078
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:33,610
It was a huge tranche and
I'm barely exaggerate.

2079
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:35,030
They're everywhere.

2080
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,950
I'm barely exactly Laurie.

2081
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,833
A little bit

2082
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,510
bring up Japanese yellow wasp.

2083
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,430
I'm telling you dog,

2084
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:47,710
like some guy died from a
Pepsi was Pepsis Pepsi Cola,

2085
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,490
Pepsi.

2086
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:49,323
Oh Man.

2087
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,840
He's allowed to change it.

2088
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:51,261
Of course.

2089
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:51,830
Junk on it.

2090
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:52,630
Who Decides?

2091
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,463
Here's names.

2092
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:54,830
Here's the,

2093
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:55,860
here's the NAC patty.

2094
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,820
The fuck that's a Japanese yellow moss.

2095
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,560
We get the syringes off their APP.

2096
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,700
They'll melt your face.

2097
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:02,361
Chappy knees,

2098
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:02,661
yellow.

2099
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:03,380
What?

2100
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,030
The guy was doing a
weed whacker off walks.

2101
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,210
A guy was using a weed wacker.

2102
00:53:08,211 --> 00:53:08,890
They thought he,

2103
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:09,321
they were like,

2104
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:10,220
that guy's a threat.

2105
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,230
Six of them landed on his face,

2106
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:12,801
melted.

2107
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:13,940
His old face is fat.

2108
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:14,900
Jay and he died.

2109
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:15,531
He died.

2110
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:16,210
Melted.

2111
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,240
I went to heaven.

2112
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,350
What do you mean by melted?

2113
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:18,921
That melted.

2114
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:20,540
Apparently the look
what it does to your it.

2115
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:20,880
Each year.

2116
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,280
Flesh.

2117
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,113
They're going to have

2118
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,710
any more questions.

2119
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:25,531
Let's read this.

2120
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:26,250
The Asian Horn

2121
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,370
is nearly two inches long
with a three inch wingspan,

2122
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:32,190
slightly smaller than the European Hornet,

2123
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:35,550
but much more aggressive can
kill 40 bees in a minute.

2124
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,450
Oh my God.

2125
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,180
One Asian Hornet can
kill 40 bees in a minute.

2126
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:43,770
A handful can destroy a hive of
30,000 bees in a couple of hours.

2127
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,800
Any more questions by the way?

2128
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:47,580
Five,

2129
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,510
five Hundo.

2130
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:48,811
Hey,

2131
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:50,910
Thalie five Hondo to a nest.

2132
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:51,841
Fuck these things.

2133
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:53,380
They only live 55 days.

2134
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:57,030
Have you ever seen if you ever seen the
video of them going through a bee colony

2135
00:53:57,031 --> 00:53:58,140
and chopping off all their heads?

2136
00:53:58,141 --> 00:53:58,741
You know what's weird?

2137
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:00,270
I have to look at this.

2138
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,320
I'm going to say they scare up intruders
by sending a lone worker horn to warn

2139
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:04,740
them.

2140
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,610
If that fails,

2141
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,610
the workers attack on Mohs,

2142
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,400
which is French for as masking group.

2143
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,230
Do you know how bees figured
out how to kill them?

2144
00:54:13,231 --> 00:54:13,951
When one of those,

2145
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:14,220
uh,

2146
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,210
one of those workers gets into
their nest with bees will do.

2147
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,710
Because now they know
what's going to happen.

2148
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,990
They cover them and they overheat them.

2149
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:22,560
Yeah.

2150
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,080
They cover him and they beat their wings.

2151
00:54:25,081 --> 00:54:26,700
Smart little basket until they die.

2152
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:27,781
Oh fucker.

2153
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:28,614
They cook him.

2154
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:28,980
Yeah.

2155
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,270
Look at that poor person right there.

2156
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:31,380
You can stylize that.

2157
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:32,490
They have to do it.

2158
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:36,870
They realize that that's the only
way to them to stop the assault.

2159
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,171
God,

2160
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:37,411
look at her.

2161
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:38,244
Isn't that crazy?

2162
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:42,330
Like somehow they got that information
that one of these fuckers comes in here.

2163
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,240
You have to cover it and
heated up some iron man.

2164
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:45,890
Three Shit.

2165
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:46,140
Yeah,

2166
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,010
it's nuts man.

2167
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,060
Do you think that they fit?

2168
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:48,421
Whoa,

2169
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:49,680
I'll buy Marcy with the rear naked.

2170
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,990
Do you think they figured that out?

2171
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,933
Barely paid it.

2172
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,410
Whoa.

2173
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,520
Do you think or figure that out?

2174
00:54:56,521 --> 00:54:59,190
Because they just know that that's their
natural enemy and they just kill in

2175
00:54:59,191 --> 00:54:59,740
when they see him.

2176
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,690
And if there's not a bunch of them,

2177
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:02,490
they just do what they have
to do to try to kill it.

2178
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,440
Or do you think they need to?

2179
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:04,200
Yeah.

2180
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,070
Do you think they know well?

2181
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:07,380
Do you think they know that if
they don't kill it more coming?

2182
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,603
I would imagine.

2183
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,560
How the fuck did they
have to have learned?

2184
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,850
They learned that.

2185
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:12,360
Right?

2186
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:12,661
So,

2187
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:14,100
so when you kill crocodiles,

2188
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:15,030
if they want to clear an area,

2189
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,630
crocodiles,

2190
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,110
if you,

2191
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:16,943
this is really weird.

2192
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,760
If you kill a crocodile and you kill
every crocodile that comes in that area,

2193
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,850
after awhile crocodiles
will avoid that area.

2194
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:24,600
They,

2195
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,980
they will pass it down.

2196
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:28,650
They'll pass that information
down to their brethren.

2197
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:28,980
Yeah.

2198
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,590
We don't even know.

2199
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:30,423
They communicate.

2200
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,351
They communicate well.

2201
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:32,340
There's something going on.

2202
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:34,330
Genetically passed elephants.

2203
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,330
Elephants will remember watering holes
and droughts that they were exposed to

2204
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:41,490
his babies 60 years ago.

2205
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,150
So they'll,

2206
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:47,150
they'll lead the entire herd to a
watering hole some 20 miles away.

2207
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,083
That's insane.

2208
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,790
Did you guys hear?

2209
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:52,650
They're saying octopus of the smartest
animal now on earth more than us.

2210
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:53,770
Not.

2211
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:53,980
Hey,

2212
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,813
easy.

2213
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:56,160
I'll we're number one.

2214
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,540
But they still Octopi?

2215
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,200
No sharing the smarter than Dolphin.

2216
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:01,880
He got it.

2217
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,030
Why?

2218
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:02,930
If they're smarter than Donald,

2219
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,920
I'm really proud of we are.

2220
00:56:04,921 --> 00:56:05,520
They probably,

2221
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:05,611
well,

2222
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:08,760
I definitely saw the
[inaudible] see finding dory.

2223
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:09,750
Fuck no,

2224
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:10,740
I didn't see that.

2225
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,840
But I did say to dad about how,

2226
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,410
how powerful they are and how unusual
they are and that they're like,

2227
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:17,310
they're almost alien.

2228
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,910
They have more chromosomes in any
other animal that we've ever read.

2229
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,090
Hearts what a fight.

2230
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,050
And they can read the
attitude of personal,

2231
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,070
like what they're trying to do

2232
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,341
to him.

2233
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:26,380
I heard they also can regenerate limbs.

2234
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,251
They're smart.

2235
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:28,510
Their eyeballs are like ours.

2236
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,090
And the truth is,

2237
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,150
I know they can read faces
on the podcast before know?

2238
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,790
I'm just saying that the smartest animal.

2239
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,760
Oh Wow.

2240
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,020
She's getting strangle this human.

2241
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:41,741
Oh Dude.

2242
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:46,240
Like Nice segue to strong bomb RCA.

2243
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,500
He's also very skillful,

2244
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:48,400
super skill.

2245
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,530
He's got the fatty or the
other guy's very strong.

2246
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,180
Two biggest fears I've
ever seen in my life.

2247
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,530
I was watching a video of a guy,

2248
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,893
he's a human now.

2249
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,300
I was watching video of a guy draining
a cauliflower ear and I was oppressed up

2250
00:56:58,301 --> 00:57:01,620
until I saw the syringe that they
pull that Eddie Bravo's body.

2251
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:02,650
I'm like,

2252
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,483
okay,

2253
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,050
where'd they stick that?

2254
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,500
They went through my stomach,

2255
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,730
opened up my stomach,

2256
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,710
pulled my guts to the side,

2257
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,663
worked on my,

2258
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:12,911
no,

2259
00:57:12,911 --> 00:57:13,820
when they do drains you,

2260
00:57:13,821 --> 00:57:14,770
I mean when they drain you.

2261
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:15,610
Well,

2262
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,040
when they sewed me up a week later,

2263
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,020
it started swelling man,

2264
00:57:20,021 --> 00:57:20,651
and got really big.

2265
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:20,951
I thought,

2266
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:21,581
fuck man.

2267
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,450
Maybe there's a 10 on the
last day and look at the name.

2268
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,430
Maybe I had a hernia.

2269
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,060
What is it,

2270
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:25,893
black.

2271
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,190
You went into the doctor.

2272
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:27,461
I'm like,

2273
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:28,031
something's wrong.

2274
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:30,160
I got this massive swelling on the scar.

2275
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:31,010
The scar healed,

2276
00:57:31,011 --> 00:57:32,810
but under it it was massive swelling.

2277
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:34,001
That's fat.

2278
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:35,140
It's all Koch Institute.

2279
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,640
But that was all right,

2280
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:38,171
right in my,

2281
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:38,440
uh,

2282
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,350
right above my desk.

2283
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:40,330
Any serious question?

2284
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,490
You got any more painkillers or,

2285
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,290
I'm broke so many rules and
they're not even that good.

2286
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:48,640
Oh Shit.

2287
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,590
They didn't give you the right guy.

2288
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,030
They didn't give you the good shit.

2289
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,140
Norcos that's what's the norcos
that's like biking under some shit.

2290
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:57,763
That ox council.

2291
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,080
That's the goodest shit ever

2292
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:01,811
chop up.

2293
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,644
Y'All snort it.

2294
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:02,861
Did.

2295
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:03,970
A lot of people are texting me,

2296
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,510
dude.

2297
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,440
Be careful about those.

2298
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:06,320
Oxies dome.

2299
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,773
Horrible.

2300
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,500
Terrible for your bond.

2301
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,211
Worried about it.

2302
00:58:10,211 --> 00:58:11,080
Like fuck yeah.

2303
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,300
Brendan governor not going to get
most addictive thing in the world.

2304
00:58:13,301 --> 00:58:13,870
Yeah.

2305
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:14,450
Really?

2306
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:15,160
Yeah.

2307
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,650
I don't have a physically addictive body.

2308
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:18,940
I don't get addicted to shit.

2309
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:22,700
Cut down to Eddie was

2310
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,930
shooting his eyes,

2311
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,290
rolled back the oxy get you man.

2312
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,220
You think I'd be a raging alcoholic.

2313
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:33,640
I mean I've been,

2314
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,020
I've been drinking since I was yeah.

2315
00:58:36,021 --> 00:58:36,330
Yeah,

2316
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:37,520
that'd be good

2317
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:40,443
for science.

2318
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,761
I'm an alcoholic.

2319
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:43,420
If you've been drinking
every day since you're a kid,

2320
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:44,710
you didn't say every day.

2321
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,191
Well that's what,

2322
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:46,560
so you added every day and it made its

2323
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:49,510
way to do it for comedy.

2324
00:58:49,511 --> 00:58:50,344
It's the way to do it.

2325
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,880
I like to exaggerate.

2326
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:52,511
Yeah,

2327
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:53,290
no,

2328
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:54,100
it's um,

2329
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:54,821
it's definitely,

2330
00:58:54,821 --> 00:58:57,730
for some people it's obviously
like a biological thing.

2331
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:01,290
Like when you can't sleep at night because
you can't get comfortable because you

2332
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:02,590
got back surgery and you can't get,

2333
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:03,424
you can't get,

2334
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:04,480
it sucks.

2335
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,850
You want to take whatever
the fuck I was taking.

2336
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:07,690
Stars a death.

2337
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,100
That shit work better than anything.

2338
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,360
Joey,

2339
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,111
Joey came by,

2340
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:14,350
dropped me off a bag and
it doesn't kill the pain.

2341
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:16,060
I never thought we'd kill pain for me.

2342
00:59:16,061 --> 00:59:16,540
I've never,

2343
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:16,841
you know,

2344
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:19,480
people say that all the time for me and
like it doesn't kill painting makes me

2345
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:20,314
focus on the pain,

2346
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,700
but then holy shit,

2347
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:24,200
what happens is the pain still there,

2348
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,333
but you're so,

2349
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,040
you're so stoned that
you don't give a shit.

2350
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,150
You just want to nap.

2351
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:34,023
I'm like,

2352
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:34,790
that ain't shit.

2353
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:35,660
Then I started thinking,

2354
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,130
what the fuck am I complaining about?

2355
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:41,800
There's refugees that are sleeping on
cement and asphalt and fucking Ecuador and

2356
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,470
shift.

2357
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:43,140
You know what I mean?

2358
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:43,400
Yeah.

2359
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:43,671
I'm like,

2360
00:59:43,671 --> 00:59:46,700
all of a sudden I'm a king right here.

2361
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,380
Has Right out.

2362
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:48,681
Doesn't.

2363
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:50,510
We'd make you feel like really thankful.

2364
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,453
Yes.

2365
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,980
Weed makes me feel super thankful.

2366
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:55,341
Do you know what?

2367
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,350
I think they buy every show better.

2368
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:00,920
I can watch teen mom be blown away or not.

2369
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,750
I can't believe you smoked
weed down that's there.

2370
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,410
There's that night.

2371
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,243
There are two things.

2372
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,081
One is getting into,

2373
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:07,850
it was only allowed to
talk over each other.

2374
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:08,870
This is never going to work.

2375
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:12,270
I like when I get into
a warm bed and I and I,

2376
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,290
I know that nobody's going to be
knocking on my door to take me for a walk

2377
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:16,640
because of my political point of view.

2378
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:20,180
I feel lucky that I get
to sleep and then fuck.

2379
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,330
This is what happens when you grow up
with like a super conservative family.

2380
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:30,810
I ain't go night night Fox
News on right by your bed.

2381
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,120
This is your favorite to be steeped in.

2382
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:38,360
His big governments have always done
what they wanted to their people and we

2383
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:39,194
live in America.

2384
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:43,760
We walked in the Megan Kelly shows
on wake me up in a gated community in

2385
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:44,360
Calgary,

2386
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:44,620
but,

2387
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,830
and then when I feed my kids,

2388
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:46,581
I know it sounds weird,

2389
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:47,450
but I have enough food.

2390
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,920
I Brian waiting for it to end.

2391
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:49,650
He,

2392
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:53,360
he used to stay up because remember
we'll how TV's at one point in time,

2393
01:00:53,361 --> 01:00:54,194
they would just,

2394
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,120
the TV would start,

2395
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:56,180
they would know more shows.

2396
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:56,450
Yeah.

2397
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,180
It would just end and they would play
the fucking star spangled banner.

2398
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,380
Brian would stay awake.

2399
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,270
I can hold my heart.

2400
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:05,720
I'll tell you.

2401
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,560
I'll tell you what I did.

2402
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:07,510
Very good.

2403
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:08,343
Rich.

2404
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,680
I never used some CT.

2405
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,083
He does.

2406
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:11,481
Yeah.

2407
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:12,314
Unfortunately.

2408
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:13,011
They're saying,

2409
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:13,310
hey,

2410
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,330
a cool right there.

2411
01:01:14,331 --> 01:01:14,901
You know what he said?

2412
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:15,110
Uh,

2413
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:18,020
he said he got most of his real
damage from fighting in k one.

2414
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:18,291
Yeah,

2415
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:19,071
no shit,

2416
01:01:19,071 --> 01:01:19,780
Sherlock.

2417
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:20,000
I mean,

2418
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,060
he fought a lot of fights in k one and
he fought them really close together to

2419
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,240
try and head real tough fights.

2420
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:26,451
Man.

2421
01:01:26,451 --> 01:01:28,850
He fought some really
tough guys killing me.

2422
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:33,970
Jerry Goodrich Goodrich fought the guy
who is the Krav Maga instructor for the

2423
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:35,750
Israeli special forces.

2424
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:38,220
New says big stud with Blue Eyes.

2425
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:38,951
Is that the UFC?

2426
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:40,260
Is that multi horrible,

2427
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:43,360
awful memory to look at
this fucking bribing.

2428
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:46,560
Anybody says about fucking
pot ruining your members.

2429
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:50,510
How is Brock Lesnar going
to come back and fight?

2430
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:50,930
Mark Hunt.

2431
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:51,800
Isn't that insane?

2432
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:52,993
I think.

2433
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:53,930
I almost feel,

2434
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:57,020
I really do almost feel
like UFC 200 is too insane.

2435
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,090
I almost feel like it's so insane.

2436
01:01:59,091 --> 01:01:59,960
It's almost too much.

2437
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,471
It's almost,

2438
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:00,750
to me,

2439
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,290
it's almost too much to
handle my weak ass bitch.

2440
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:04,160
Hold school prides,

2441
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,600
bitch heart can't handle it.

2442
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,430
I agree.

2443
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:06,820
It's too,

2444
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:07,550
I agree.

2445
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,200
It's too much on twice a year.

2446
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:10,610
Make a super bowl type car.

2447
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:10,770
No,

2448
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,050
that's almost too much slice.

2449
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,190
Even the super ball.

2450
01:02:13,191 --> 01:02:15,620
It's telling you what if third lesson,

2451
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,790
UFC history,

2452
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,860
55% takedown accuracy.

2453
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:19,470
Yeah.

2454
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,130
If he takes,

2455
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,780
if he grabs mark on his back.

2456
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,213
That's true.

2457
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:24,930
But still that's true.

2458
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,771
That's like a percentage.

2459
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:26,604
He's not,

2460
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,593
not really.

2461
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:27,950
No,

2462
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:28,021
no,

2463
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:28,171
no,

2464
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:28,321
no.

2465
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:29,400
He's absolutely going to get tested,

2466
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:30,360
but he's not a four week.

2467
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:31,020
No,

2468
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:31,091
no,

2469
01:02:31,091 --> 01:02:31,320
no,

2470
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:31,531
no,

2471
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:31,681
no,

2472
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:31,831
no,

2473
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:31,981
no,

2474
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:32,220
no.

2475
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:35,210
He's exempt from the four
months in advance rule,

2476
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,420
which means you have to be tested
up until four months in advance.

2477
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:43,440
This deal came together so
quickly that they didn't make the,

2478
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:44,151
they just,

2479
01:02:44,151 --> 01:02:47,400
just no way they could have that because
they weren't even talking to him four

2480
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:48,234
months ago.

2481
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:48,481
No,

2482
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:48,931
it's true.

2483
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,570
They weren't talking to them for doing
this fight for a month and you think

2484
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:55,710
Brock literally went from zero saying
that zero chain didn't think he was in a

2485
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:57,720
fight at all until four
weeks before we were like,

2486
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,350
I'll take it.

2487
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:58,770
I'm ta.

2488
01:02:58,770 --> 01:02:59,970
I'm saying that this deal,

2489
01:02:59,971 --> 01:03:04,050
like him getting signed to fight
did not happen until recently.

2490
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:05,910
It was a very recent thing.

2491
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:10,230
They were trying to make UFC 200
crazier after Connor and Nate fell off.

2492
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,070
True.

2493
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:11,610
True.

2494
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:12,990
This is where all this came from,

2495
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:14,280
so they had to make this look.

2496
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:17,820
I can't talk about it because I know too
much of the inside stuff of what they

2497
01:03:17,821 --> 01:03:19,020
had to do to make it work out,

2498
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,580
but it was an ordeal.

2499
01:03:20,581 --> 01:03:23,520
This was an ordeal to pull
off the Nate Connor thing,

2500
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,630
this Brock Lesnar thing,

2501
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,470
isn't he?

2502
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,260
Because he's still,

2503
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,090
he's still wrestling for the WWE.

2504
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:30,930
This is a,

2505
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,400
this is a crazy deal.

2506
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:34,170
It was not an easy thing to pull off,

2507
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:35,200
so he's not going to get tested.

2508
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:35,480
Why?

2509
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,313
He's tested,

2510
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:37,853
tested now,

2511
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:38,940
like they're not going to test.

2512
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,290
They weren't testing for months ago.

2513
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,400
He's had like every
other person in the Zack,

2514
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:43,050
he hadn't,

2515
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,190
he's the exception.

2516
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,000
But why did,

2517
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,541
can I ask you,

2518
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:46,610
why did Bryan,

2519
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:47,610
I feel good point.

2520
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,430
If you're going to make
exceptions for him,

2521
01:03:49,431 --> 01:03:50,370
he has to do it for other guys.

2522
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:50,551
Well,

2523
01:03:50,551 --> 01:03:51,091
here's the deal,

2524
01:03:51,091 --> 01:03:51,480
right?

2525
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,110
Here's the,

2526
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:52,561
this is,

2527
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:54,150
this is the argument against it.

2528
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,710
The argument against it is you got to say,

2529
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:56,430
listen,

2530
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,020
if you want to make this legitimate,

2531
01:03:58,021 --> 01:04:01,530
you should have no question whatsoever
that your athletes are clean and

2532
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:02,370
compliant,

2533
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,560
and that means four months out.

2534
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,740
But how are you not
going to make this fight?

2535
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,460
Like if you were a promoter and there's
no way you can test the guy from four

2536
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:11,911
months ago,

2537
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:12,331
but you say,

2538
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:12,840
listen,

2539
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,220
we can test them right now.

2540
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,120
We tested right now,

2541
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,320
do we have an exemption queen?

2542
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:16,651
Okay,

2543
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:17,790
if he's on steroids right now,

2544
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:18,900
we're fucked and we're done.

2545
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:19,740
And his deals over,

2546
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:20,160
right?

2547
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:20,911
But if he's clean,

2548
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:21,241
he says,

2549
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:22,074
he's clean.

2550
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,220
Let's fucking do it.

2551
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,960
I get it for for entertainment
and pay per view,

2552
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:28,410
it makes 100% but if you're going to say,

2553
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:28,950
are you saying,

2554
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:29,730
hey Connor,

2555
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,080
we don't make it summons for anyone.

2556
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:31,711
Brock Lesnar,

2557
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:32,700
here's when exception and brother,

2558
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:34,670
well that's it for the WWE battery,

2559
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,090
but it's a different kind of essential,

2560
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:37,830
make an exception though
because you're doing,

2561
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:42,210
you're making an exception to what
happened in the past before the deal.

2562
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:45,660
You're not making an exception as far
as like what you have to do from here on

2563
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:50,640
out in terms of promotion and in terms
of what's agreed upon by the promoter and

2564
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:51,271
the AF true.

2565
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:53,510
But if every other what's agreed
to put buses just talking to him,

2566
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:54,660
tell her what,

2567
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,160
let's say I want to come back right now,

2568
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,040
I have to give them a four month
advanced and they have to test me.

2569
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:02,190
Or you are a big enough star
where they use their exemption.

2570
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:05,730
So then so then the
fighter in the keynote,

2571
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,270
no,

2572
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,410
if you don't know that you're going to
fight until right before you're going to

2573
01:05:09,411 --> 01:05:09,571
fight,

2574
01:05:09,571 --> 01:05:10,590
like let's put it this way.

2575
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:11,820
You don't think I would know before.

2576
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,440
I'm not necessarily in favor.

2577
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:14,940
You might be an impulsive person.

2578
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:15,660
I don't know.

2579
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:15,841
Okay.

2580
01:05:15,841 --> 01:05:16,080
Let's,

2581
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,920
let's just say you're like Brendan Schaub.

2582
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:18,130
You're,

2583
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,210
you're a pretty crazy guy.

2584
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:19,570
Yeah.

2585
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:22,150
If someone came along and maybe
a year and a half from now,

2586
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:24,440
you're fucking still Quito it up and you,

2587
01:05:24,441 --> 01:05:27,400
you and Tony Jeffries or hitting the
pads every day and you're feeling frisky

2588
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:32,360
when you're rolling with Hanan Barao
and Gracie Hanan Barao that'd be fun.

2589
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,970
Fuck mixing up my Brazilian.

2590
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:34,640
Awesome dude.

2591
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,060
So if you did that and you just said,

2592
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:37,661
fuck it man,

2593
01:05:37,661 --> 01:05:38,350
I want to come back.

2594
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,410
If the fighter and the kid blows up and
you're getting 20 million downloads a

2595
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:42,550
month and everything is,

2596
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,181
everything is,

2597
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:45,670
everything is happy and
fascinating and you just go,

2598
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:46,840
I need something else I need,

2599
01:05:46,841 --> 01:05:47,770
I need a fucking challenge.

2600
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:48,400
I want to fight.

2601
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,470
And then Dana white calls you
up and he's smoking a cigar.

2602
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:51,303
The phone,

2603
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:52,170
listen,

2604
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:53,003
Hey Brendan,

2605
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,620
crazy deal.

2606
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:57,340
And then you just say,

2607
01:05:57,341 --> 01:05:57,821
fuck it.

2608
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:58,110
I'm going,

2609
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:58,943
I'm crazy.

2610
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,460
Don't make that exemption.

2611
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,740
Maybe they would if you
were famous as Brock Lesnar.

2612
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:03,520
Yeah.

2613
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,211
You listening to me,

2614
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:04,520
Bro.

2615
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,081
Fucking left it.

2616
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:05,914
You got to make it.

2617
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,600
I'm telling you are batshit crazy.

2618
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:08,890
If you think Brockton,

2619
01:06:08,891 --> 01:06:08,981
oh,

2620
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:09,940
he's gonna fight for it.

2621
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:15,170
You might be correct also and
also Wue were guys on the torso.

2622
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,930
He known for taking steroids.

2623
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:17,793
It's a little fishy.

2624
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:18,400
It is.

2625
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:18,820
Well,

2626
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:19,540
prove this.

2627
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:24,540
It's definitely not ideal when you're
trying to promote this sport as being

2628
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,010
absolutely tested,

2629
01:06:27,011 --> 01:06:27,281
right,

2630
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:30,190
because you have this little weird
gray area that you'd introduced.

2631
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:33,430
It's when I say entertainment
and sport as a fan,

2632
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,560
it's all door.

2633
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,020
No,

2634
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,700
to not make this fight.

2635
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,840
It is criminal.

2636
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:38,920
I want to see it,

2637
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:41,320
but I feel you my concern and tested,

2638
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,333
yes he has.

2639
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:47,700
I understand you for and I agree with
you and not mad at certain exceptions.

2640
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:48,970
Then we it.

2641
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:50,290
It's a weird gray area,

2642
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,970
but why would Brock Lesnar,

2643
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,790
I mean we all do have to diverse specs.

2644
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,220
Let's take a moment aside.

2645
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:58,840
How about a fucking round maybe log.

2646
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:00,070
I'm not going to have a real life.

2647
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,410
You're right.

2648
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,750
There was a real man.

2649
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:06,520
You got the script and
he was a real good dude.

2650
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:07,151
Great Guy.

2651
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:09,120
I always enjoy talking Kimbo.

2652
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,150
Who's going to play Kimbo?

2653
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:11,710
Annandale,

2654
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,780
Robert Downey Jr and spray paint my face.

2655
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,060
You could do like Jurassic Park.

2656
01:07:16,061 --> 01:07:19,590
You just get a computer to make images
of Kimbo and you get some duties were

2657
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,770
really good at doing Kimbos.

2658
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,410
You don't can't have an actor now.

2659
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:22,991
You don't think so?

2660
01:07:22,991 --> 01:07:23,261
Got You.

2661
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:27,020
Use a real computer
generated Chenko shy white.

2662
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:27,740
No Perth.

2663
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,573
How dare you?

2664
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:30,223
No,

2665
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,870
that's a good call out.

2666
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,340
Nothing like that.

2667
01:07:35,341 --> 01:07:36,161
Last doctor in the world,

2668
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:37,630
Michael Jackey pull it off.

2669
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:39,573
Pulled up.

2670
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:40,730
He pulled up Tyson.

2671
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:41,650
He's tough.

2672
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:42,230
He's good.

2673
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:42,611
Pulled off.

2674
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:42,970
Tyson.

2675
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:43,780
Come on.

2676
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:45,400
You don't think you pulled
off the types of spawn.

2677
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:46,540
How dare he was fun.

2678
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,460
I liked him in spawn deaf and by the way,

2679
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:49,643
my

2680
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:51,480
mind,

2681
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,450
your p's and q's around in,

2682
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:53,293
please

2683
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:55,423
throw some bones.

2684
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:57,320
Hey,

2685
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,840
let's stop all that nonsense.

2686
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:02,330
Michael Jai white is a cool motherfucker.

2687
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:03,680
I'm a big fan.

2688
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,460
Emma's a person and as an activist spawn.

2689
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:10,300
He's a great dude or some
other guys couldn't do it.

2690
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:11,320
He's built for it.

2691
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,860
Certainly built for giant.

2692
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:14,380
He's jacked as fuck.

2693
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,230
Hey,

2694
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,070
mind your p's and q's

2695
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,330
around.

2696
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:16,890
Fuck you.

2697
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:17,211
I said,

2698
01:08:17,211 --> 01:08:17,720
man,

2699
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,880
he's a good dude and a
real legit martial artists.

2700
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:20,060
Yeah.

2701
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:24,890
Michael Jai white came to legend
through a hopping side kick at the back.

2702
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:25,730
Granted this bag,

2703
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,620
the chain would break
all attorney turned shit.

2704
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:28,341
No,

2705
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:28,731
this one,

2706
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:29,540
I don't even think it was a tough,

2707
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,410
he's tough dude.

2708
01:08:30,411 --> 01:08:30,731
He's,

2709
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:31,730
he's like you.

2710
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:32,121
Sure?

2711
01:08:32,121 --> 01:08:33,230
I thought it was a hopping size.

2712
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:35,550
Big Guy around either way,

2713
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:37,490
whatever the,

2714
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:38,330
the kick it was.

2715
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:38,911
Don't say his name.

2716
01:08:38,911 --> 01:08:39,171
Scott.

2717
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:40,280
Perfect technique.

2718
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,620
Michael Jai white has
perfect kicking techniques.

2719
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,590
His sidekick is like laser sharp.

2720
01:08:45,591 --> 01:08:46,850
He extends his foot.

2721
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,430
He holds it out there and
pulls it back like legit.

2722
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,540
Very high level black belts.

2723
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,950
You kicked it off him.

2724
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,000
Don't kill him.

2725
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,970
So you mind a PS and qs.

2726
01:08:55,971 --> 01:08:56,930
If you see him in a bar,

2727
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:59,030
you buy him a drink and
you thank him for his word.

2728
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,580
Thanked them for snakes.

2729
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:01,530
No,

2730
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:02,363
you think forever.

2731
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:03,051
Wait a minute.

2732
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:03,884
Hold on a second.

2733
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:04,401
Brian,

2734
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:04,971
let me ask you this.

2735
01:09:04,971 --> 01:09:08,840
Do you think to you at 170
pounds of supple glory?

2736
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:13,010
And I'm suppose I'm a leopard that
you can kick as hard as Shab Ken,

2737
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:14,150
even though shove doesn't kick.

2738
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:15,823
No.

2739
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,513
I tried to

2740
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:20,980
shop and I tried to,

2741
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,451
yesterday,

2742
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:24,284
yesterday,

2743
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:25,911
yesterday,

2744
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,310
yesterday I said to Brendan
shop and I was Kinda,

2745
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,360
I was half serious.

2746
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:30,261
We came out,

2747
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:31,490
we did this real fun,

2748
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,250
uh,

2749
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:37,040
it's press thing and he grabbed
me around my torso and I said,

2750
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:37,161
oh,

2751
01:09:37,161 --> 01:09:37,521
my back,

2752
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:38,331
my back please.

2753
01:09:38,331 --> 01:09:40,310
And I tapped immediately and then I said,

2754
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:41,690
I got something happened.

2755
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,860
Maybe it was too much coffee,

2756
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,240
maybe it's too much coffee.

2757
01:09:44,241 --> 01:09:45,074
And I said,

2758
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:46,280
and I was half serious,

2759
01:09:46,281 --> 01:09:49,610
maybe even 70% of years
ago I was a wrestler.

2760
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:50,683
I don't like the way,

2761
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,680
I don't want like the way it came out
in the middle of the [inaudible] the way

2762
01:09:52,681 --> 01:09:53,361
it came out to me,

2763
01:09:53,361 --> 01:09:53,790
by the way.

2764
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:54,220
Yeah.

2765
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,730
I'm a man and by the way,

2766
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,870
who's shaped my box.

2767
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:57,704
I played tennis.

2768
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,430
I said,

2769
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:59,750
if I didn't want you to,

2770
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,740
you're not getting me in a,

2771
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:01,700
in a body lock.

2772
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:02,533
Oh my God.

2773
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:04,040
Yeah.

2774
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:04,780
Well.

2775
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:05,540
Well Mike,

2776
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:06,730
tell me what you do with your thought.

2777
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:07,160
Hey,

2778
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,880
he put his phone and wallet on top of
his car on top of my car and I can go in

2779
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:11,714
the top.

2780
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,580
I put my phone on my
wallet on top of the car,

2781
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,140
Joe.

2782
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:16,370
And then we engage,

2783
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,233
we engage.

2784
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,860
I tried a couple of arm drags.

2785
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,820
I I get some risks.

2786
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:20,600
Control,

2787
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,680
I get some risk control.

2788
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:22,710
Yup.

2789
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:23,360
He,

2790
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,081
he tries to,

2791
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:25,460
he tries to head head me.

2792
01:10:25,461 --> 01:10:27,800
He tries to kind of throw a headlock.

2793
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:28,310
Ami.

2794
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:29,630
I pull my neck,

2795
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:31,370
I bowl my neck and then,

2796
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,440
and then he got two on one on my wrist.

2797
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:34,200
He got both his hands.

2798
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:34,731
And when I say look,

2799
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,240
I see,

2800
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:35,960
cause he goes,

2801
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:36,430
Ooh,

2802
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,300
let me get to I one.

2803
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,420
That's a big mistake.

2804
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,093
He whispered.

2805
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,330
And then I felt,

2806
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:46,420
I felt his explosive power and he put
me into a body and then I began to

2807
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:49,400
immediately squeal like a pig.

2808
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:50,690
This is the best part.

2809
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:51,501
And then I go light bro,

2810
01:10:51,501 --> 01:10:52,610
I'll meet you at the lunch place.

2811
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:53,430
He drives off,

2812
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:56,720
leaves his phone and on top of his
car and he ran over to his IFO.

2813
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:01,130
See this thing I sure did
it as an objective person.

2814
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:02,780
This is why this is so disturbing to me.

2815
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,990
I know what I can do to you and
then I know what he can do to me.

2816
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:07,340
That doesn't,

2817
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,610
that doesn't make sense to me.

2818
01:11:08,611 --> 01:11:08,830
Well,

2819
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:09,260
I'm a good,

2820
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:09,750
I'm like,

2821
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,150
I've gotten a hold of you before.

2822
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,710
Relatively helpless.

2823
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,580
Good rest

2824
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,040
the apple and they charge them
a thousand dollar mistake.

2825
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:29,521
He goes,

2826
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:29,850
Bro,

2827
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:32,550
it's worth $1,000 worth five grand.

2828
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:37,830
You got hustled and iPhone.

2829
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,460
I mean,

2830
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,110
how could you really think
to you who grapple with it?

2831
01:11:40,111 --> 01:11:40,944
Because I'm a good cause I'm,

2832
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,040
I'm good on my feet and this is weird.

2833
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,780
I know it is sad.

2834
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:47,123
Do this.

2835
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,990
I'm going to stick to my guns and I'm
going to say a time when you tried to pull

2836
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:52,860
my bow back

2837
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:54,990
though,

2838
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:57,020
you know that bow that I
shoot a hundred arrows.

2839
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:58,591
Who is that?

2840
01:11:58,591 --> 01:12:00,690
There was a brick wall that like,

2841
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:01,524
God,

2842
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,320
it just,

2843
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,330
it just was not moving it.

2844
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:07,261
But listen,

2845
01:12:07,261 --> 01:12:07,471
Bro,

2846
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:07,891
I don't matter.

2847
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:08,611
I'm having a line.

2848
01:12:08,611 --> 01:12:09,061
I don't remember.

2849
01:12:09,061 --> 01:12:09,894
What you're talking about

2850
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,180
is a strangeness to this humor
because I know part of it is humorous,

2851
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,840
but the strangeness is
There's a Whisper of truth.

2852
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:20,340
Like this one,

2853
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:25,340
I am 100% convinced that shop is too big
and too strong for me to grapple with

2854
01:12:25,411 --> 01:12:26,220
him.

2855
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,053
But you're not.

2856
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:27,311
No,

2857
01:12:27,311 --> 01:12:27,351
no,

2858
01:12:27,351 --> 01:12:27,600
no.

2859
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,433
I have

2860
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:34,030
a little bit,

2861
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:35,480
see if me and Shabazz,

2862
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:35,810
Roland,

2863
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:36,900
I'm thinking how long can I,

2864
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:37,520
your phone?

2865
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,010
Yeah.

2866
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:39,280
And whether or not I can,

2867
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:43,080
if it's impossible to get him so tired
and to survive long enough that I could

2868
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:43,490
catch him.

2869
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:44,050
Yeah.

2870
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:44,851
So getting him to get,

2871
01:12:44,851 --> 01:12:46,650
I'm so tired because he's so much bigger.

2872
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:47,220
Yeah.

2873
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,060
And he's so strong.

2874
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:48,923
And by the way,

2875
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:51,150
I like to stick my finger in
the cage and poke the bear.

2876
01:12:51,151 --> 01:12:51,721
I think that's what,

2877
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:52,554
that's weird.

2878
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,390
But that's the weird thing is like,

2879
01:12:54,391 --> 01:12:59,391
I don't think you're totally aware
and I am what you can and can't.

2880
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,140
No,

2881
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,550
I'm very well might be like,

2882
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,473
no,

2883
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:05,003
it's not true.

2884
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:05,630
No,

2885
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:05,760
no,

2886
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,060
no,

2887
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:06,330
nope.

2888
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:08,940
I'm very aware of how badly I
could get beat up and I felt it.

2889
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:11,250
I felt that I'd been putting
bad positions by him,

2890
01:13:11,251 --> 01:13:11,911
by other guys,

2891
01:13:11,911 --> 01:13:12,721
by boxing,

2892
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:13,160
all that.

2893
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,490
Like hugged Dan Henderson.

2894
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,280
Oh,

2895
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:15,570
awesome.

2896
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:17,780
Very uncomfortable
feeling he's made of wood.

2897
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,313
Shake him.

2898
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,850
So funny that you say that.

2899
01:13:20,851 --> 01:13:23,850
That's exactly what Ryan Parson
who trained him forever said,

2900
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,870
he said he would have to do like deep
tissue on like rub them down after a

2901
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,420
fight.

2902
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,570
He said he'd beaks hostage.

2903
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:28,831
He's like,

2904
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,180
he's made out of a different thing.

2905
01:13:30,181 --> 01:13:31,110
He's got a semi,

2906
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:32,310
he's got a simian strength.

2907
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,233
There's nobody more.

2908
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,050
Uh,

2909
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:34,441
he's just,

2910
01:13:34,441 --> 01:13:35,520
he's got his head,

2911
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:36,380
everything about him before.

2912
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,710
Fucking Hector Lumbar,

2913
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:37,981
the guy,

2914
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:39,880
he just fought that guy at hand.

2915
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:41,730
I actually think Dan Henderson,

2916
01:13:41,731 --> 01:13:42,564
you get a title shot.

2917
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:43,171
Oh,

2918
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:44,130
I hope so.

2919
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,150
And believe me,

2920
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:46,440
the kid was not,

2921
01:13:46,441 --> 01:13:47,160
I'm not the kid.

2922
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:47,970
You're the kid.

2923
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:48,840
That kind of the kid.

2924
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:49,480
What?

2925
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,030
What did I know?

2926
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:52,410
It's key to meet me person.

2927
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:53,820
I was lobbying for me.

2928
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:55,620
I called Dana Up.

2929
01:13:55,621 --> 01:13:55,921
I said,

2930
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:56,191
dude,

2931
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:57,330
let's talk about this.

2932
01:13:57,610 --> 01:13:59,460
Really come on and then I text you.

2933
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,333
Is that for real?

2934
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:01,020
No,

2935
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,420
I'm just trying to hype this thing up.

2936
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:04,140
What could be a better,

2937
01:14:04,141 --> 01:14:05,400
more exciting fight?

2938
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:07,300
Bisping Hendo too.

2939
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:08,940
And they both walk away.

2940
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:09,803
They both walk away.

2941
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:10,531
You got Wyman.

2942
01:14:10,531 --> 01:14:12,610
Rockhold I feel like Jocko Ray

2943
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:17,320
as a fan is disappointing
me that he doesn't just step
aside and let this way as

2944
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:18,580
a God damn.

2945
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,300
Get the fuck out the way.

2946
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,503
I agree.

2947
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,011
Chuck array,

2948
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:24,791
your Nax Bro.

2949
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:27,540
100% you sit down for lift weights.

2950
01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:28,780
I probably won't be like drug tests.

2951
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:29,614
You felt like,

2952
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,340
oh well he's got to have sworn that

2953
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:37,930
dude fucking yoga to
fucking whatever you lose.

2954
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,490
Just let this fight happened please.

2955
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:40,324
And then your next.

2956
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:41,110
I agree.

2957
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:42,910
And then Weidman and
Rockhold have a rematch.

2958
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,620
Come on belt.

2959
01:14:44,621 --> 01:14:48,130
Both guys just lost Weidman
wanted Rockhold wants it.

2960
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:48,521
Come on.

2961
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:50,710
Some no interim belts to be thrown away.

2962
01:14:50,711 --> 01:14:53,370
Too many interim Butano busy Dan.

2963
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:56,590
They both retire after
that fight for the belt.

2964
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:56,951
Yeah,

2965
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:57,784
that's a good idea.

2966
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,070
Jocko Array Weidman.

2967
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:00,200
This guy's Chakra.

2968
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:07,510
This guy looked at stained glass
and got a tattoo or statues of all,

2969
01:15:07,511 --> 01:15:08,560
he's a radio guy.

2970
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:09,310
Really?

2971
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:09,521
Yeah.

2972
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:09,870
Full time.

2973
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:10,870
He's got a morning show,

2974
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,733
I believe,

2975
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:12,100
by the way.

2976
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,830
Seen really good guy.

2977
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,330
Really Nice guy and fucking tough guy.

2978
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,460
And you know who he is?

2979
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,520
He's a the hockey enforcer.

2980
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:22,750
This mother fucker's had like 270 hockey.

2981
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:23,913
Wow.

2982
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:25,930
Cocky though.

2983
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:29,270
It was in the NHL either
when talking about not NHL.

2984
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,040
Really?

2985
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:30,251
No,

2986
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:30,641
I don't think.

2987
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:31,121
Are you sure?

2988
01:15:31,121 --> 01:15:32,020
I'm almost positive.

2989
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:32,720
Yeah.

2990
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,553
Okay.

2991
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:34,780
Evan,

2992
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,430
the cub is balls deep in hockey.

2993
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:37,660
And he said he never played Nhl.

2994
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:37,930
Yeah.

2995
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:38,591
Oh,

2996
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:38,861
okay.

2997
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:39,820
So either way.

2998
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:40,743
Either way.

2999
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,050
A hockey hockey's insane.

3000
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:45,700
He's been winning fights.

3001
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:46,890
This guys the worst.

3002
01:15:46,891 --> 01:15:48,730
How many fights in the UFC so far?

3003
01:15:48,731 --> 01:15:49,061
Jamie?

3004
01:15:49,061 --> 01:15:49,240
No,

3005
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,110
he just two in one,

3006
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:50,380
right?

3007
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,490
You've got knocked out his first one.

3008
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:51,701
Then what?

3009
01:15:51,701 --> 01:15:52,210
His last one.

3010
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:54,910
He took his first fight on
short notice and got stopped.

3011
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:57,040
Start someone who stopped him.

3012
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:58,481
Oh,

3013
01:15:58,481 --> 01:15:59,410
Tiago Santos.

3014
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,263
Telco Santos.

3015
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,520
He's one in one in the,

3016
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,510
but then he beat change to
Hoonah to Hoonah is legit man.

3017
01:16:04,511 --> 01:16:05,140
Knocked them out.

3018
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:05,801
Not Fast.

3019
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:06,640
52 seconds.

3020
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:07,840
Look at his fucking fights.

3021
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,590
30 strides.

3022
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,180
52 boom.

3023
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:10,481
Oh,

3024
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:12,980
this one's someone's getting knocked
out and O'connell's gangster.

3025
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:15,490
It's got power.

3026
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,170
Hit Him with the stain glass son.

3027
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:18,960
O'Connell got pals.

3028
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:22,840
The stained glass in the cities use the
holy ghost power and he stays in the

3029
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:24,060
pocket of Tada.

3030
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,100
I don't like what he's doing.

3031
01:16:25,101 --> 01:16:26,050
This pull up his,

3032
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,020
his very Jane.

3033
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,180
Very Roman Catholic.

3034
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,160
That stained glass tat too.

3035
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:31,300
I've never seen before.

3036
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,833
The problem.

3037
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,753
It's an issue.

3038
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,920
Let's go ahead and get the tans sick.

3039
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,090
Let's go ahead and tell him the US.

3040
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,000
Celebrate that Shit.

3041
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:38,350
Yeah.

3042
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:40,780
One guy's got a tan that's
someone's getting knocked out.

3043
01:16:40,781 --> 01:16:41,970
This fighting going past this.

3044
01:16:41,971 --> 01:16:42,830
That gets geyser.

3045
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,780
Someone's going to get tired.

3046
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,600
Does that is an odd choice of tattoos,

3047
01:16:48,601 --> 01:16:50,920
but that's coming from a guy who has odd

3048
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:53,253
fucking

3049
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:00,170
sang glass

3050
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:02,140
dude.

3051
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,100
How tough is boss?

3052
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:03,471
Wow.

3053
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:04,304
It's hanging in there.

3054
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:05,980
[inaudible] hand boss,

3055
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:07,863
Beautiful Tan.

3056
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,370
Fucking 10 and then candidates here.

3057
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,250
Let him back up and do it again.

3058
01:17:13,251 --> 01:17:14,640
100% oh man.

3059
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:15,271
Keep beating on him.

3060
01:17:15,271 --> 01:17:17,200
We talked about this guys almost done it.

3061
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:18,660
Just in my experience in the octagon,

3062
01:17:18,661 --> 01:17:19,910
you don't have stained glass tattoos.

3063
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,810
Bride come out against the character.

3064
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:23,723
When you're up,

3065
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:24,710
you got a chance.

3066
01:17:24,711 --> 01:17:25,520
When you're down,

3067
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:26,450
you're only punching up,

3068
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:26,960
right?

3069
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:27,291
God,

3070
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:27,650
that guys,

3071
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:28,011
it's hard.

3072
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:28,791
Then we can recover.

3073
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:29,900
The pause is tough.

3074
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:32,440
He just took Sue's O'connell,

3075
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:33,020
man.

3076
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:33,141
Oh,

3077
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:34,610
Kyle's got a nasty you left hand,

3078
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:35,444
man.

3079
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,100
He's just tough as shit.

3080
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:40,760
He's just one of those Irish fucks that
just doesn't want to use of stained

3081
01:17:40,761 --> 01:17:42,590
glass tattoos and the toughest fuck.

3082
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:44,140
You don't get that stuff

3083
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:51,060
very is it?

3084
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,580
I seen his name wrong.

3085
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:53,061
Bossy,

3086
01:17:53,061 --> 01:17:53,780
Bossy,

3087
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:55,420
Bossy boss has got some big legs.

3088
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:56,430
Why am I thinking it's boasting?

3089
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:57,603
The sercos.

3090
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,660
Maybe we should change it.

3091
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:00,321
Powerful.

3092
01:18:00,321 --> 01:18:01,300
10 boxes.

3093
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,290
Let's go ahead and look at
the thoughts on this kid.

3094
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,400
Look at bossy size.

3095
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,330
Let's call them the Bosi.

3096
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,021
The boats.

3097
01:18:06,021 --> 01:18:07,370
Just call him the boss.

3098
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:07,940
No,

3099
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:08,371
it was common.

3100
01:18:08,371 --> 01:18:09,500
His real name or who get mad?

3101
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:13,640
You think just double leg.

3102
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:14,474
I'm jail.

3103
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,313
Oh God you can't.

3104
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:16,820
Those are some big legs.

3105
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:17,980
That's hard to look at.

3106
01:18:17,981 --> 01:18:20,180
How big his likes to tell you
right now if this fight was on ice,

3107
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:21,170
your boy's phone.

3108
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,250
That is an interesting thing,

3109
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:22,431
man.

3110
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:23,690
About hockey players.

3111
01:18:23,691 --> 01:18:23,901
Man,

3112
01:18:23,901 --> 01:18:25,310
they develop some serious bowels.

3113
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,033
Tags him again.

3114
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:27,270
Oh.

3115
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:28,103
Cosmin doing.

3116
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:29,090
Oh he's,

3117
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:32,380
he's ending his combinations with
that left hand and that's where balls,

3118
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:33,223
he's getting caught.

3119
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:33,681
Yeah.

3120
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:33,921
He's,

3121
01:18:33,921 --> 01:18:36,590
he's stolen in a nice lunches
in bunches and it's land.

3122
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:39,080
It's also is his accuracy is really good.

3123
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:39,531
My boss,

3124
01:18:39,531 --> 01:18:40,364
he's moving,

3125
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:41,241
catching,

3126
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:41,920
moving back.

3127
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,360
Catching.

3128
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:42,890
Yeah.

3129
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,120
Catching him moving back.

3130
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:45,330
That's,

3131
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:45,610
you know,

3132
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:46,700
that's not easy to do.

3133
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:47,540
That's how the timing,

3134
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,700
his tattoo artist might
want to call up Aaron dove,

3135
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:55,460
Adobo Guru Tattoo San Diego.

3136
01:18:55,461 --> 01:18:56,500
My clean the shit up.

3137
01:18:57,710 --> 01:18:58,550
More colored dog.

3138
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:01,280
Like a Crayola box on that bites skin.

3139
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,250
That's one good thing
that white people have.

3140
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,750
I know I can't do color.

3141
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:09,680
White people could do some
amazing people like look,

3142
01:19:09,681 --> 01:19:11,540
if you are working a serious albino,

3143
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,580
you could have some beautiful
colors and I know I have no cure.

3144
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,620
A white piece of paper,

3145
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,480
you know,

3146
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,630
like blank canvas,

3147
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:18,493
black twos.

3148
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:19,703
They could,

3149
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:21,770
well they can put tattoos
everywhere though.

3150
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:25,120
And around somehow or another it's,

3151
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,540
it's like a subtle thing.

3152
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,740
They should do white ink though.

3153
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:29,480
It just doesn't take the
skin and it doesn't work.

3154
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:30,314
Now it looks sick.

3155
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:31,183
Oh,

3156
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:32,990
I see what he asked you
left hands to the body.

3157
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,770
But you know,

3158
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:40,850
it's interesting that the black guy
covered in tattoos is a fairly new thing

3159
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:42,080
culturally in this country,

3160
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:42,350
right?

3161
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:42,861
Rappers.

3162
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:43,450
Athletes.

3163
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,150
Yeah.

3164
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:44,391
I mean,

3165
01:19:44,391 --> 01:19:45,860
but it's so common now.

3166
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,110
It's interesting how it took off.

3167
01:19:48,111 --> 01:19:51,210
Like if you looked at black guys
from like Muhammad Ali's error,

3168
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:52,063
Joe Frazier,

3169
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:54,500
but then look at like Deontay wilder.

3170
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:54,711
Yeah,

3171
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:55,191
you're right.

3172
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:56,210
So many guys like that.

3173
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:00,690
How many gang tattoos were subversive
up until really the nineties saint?

3174
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:01,091
I mean,

3175
01:20:01,091 --> 01:20:01,700
you know,

3176
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:01,941
yeah.

3177
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:06,710
Body art was always considered subversive
and weird decoration and you had to

3178
01:20:06,711 --> 01:20:07,260
be,

3179
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:07,740
you know,

3180
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:12,080
kind of on and you had to be a criminal
or like something or something.

3181
01:20:12,081 --> 01:20:12,301
You know,

3182
01:20:12,301 --> 01:20:16,650
you had to be on the outskirts
of society to have a tattoo.

3183
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:18,023
Even in the hearing.

3184
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:18,960
I remember I told my dad,

3185
01:20:18,961 --> 01:20:23,961
I got an earring as a joke when I
was 65 I'm on the phone like it go.

3186
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,593
I didn't parental,

3187
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,793
he thought it was,

3188
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,340
he's a bully that we're talking about.

3189
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:33,060
You're trampling on my sensibilities.

3190
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:37,800
It's used sometimes when people
just arguing with each other.

3191
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,260
If one person's right,

3192
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,031
he's a bully.

3193
01:20:40,031 --> 01:20:40,680
Damn boss,

3194
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,640
boss take down.

3195
01:20:41,641 --> 01:20:42,570
That's when he knows shit.

3196
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:43,230
Hit the fan.

3197
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:43,921
I don't know man.

3198
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:44,790
He's kind of mix it up.

3199
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:45,653
Let's try and mix it up.

3200
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,790
These guys taking crazy shots to the head.

3201
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:49,653
Bullies.

3202
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,580
Damn that Tattoo.

3203
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,820
So color white people.

3204
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:55,860
White fucking peak off of campuses.

3205
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:57,300
Do I love tattoos?

3206
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,240
A lot of white people get the Red Tet,

3207
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,780
the the red ink these days.

3208
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,120
I see girls with reading
because that's iconography.

3209
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,013
That shit.

3210
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:05,550
God Damn boss,

3211
01:21:05,551 --> 01:21:05,850
man,

3212
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:07,030
there's that left look,

3213
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:08,390
Sam,

3214
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:12,000
Jesus Christ God and he's super dorm.

3215
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:12,953
Incredible,

3216
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,590
incredible,

3217
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:14,090
powerful.

3218
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:14,750
Tam.

3219
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,520
God Damn it.

3220
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,800
Look at it isn't though is it's so,

3221
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:17,634
but he can't breathe.

3222
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,561
That left hook broke.

3223
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:20,520
That knows for sure.

3224
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,440
I don't know.

3225
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,460
Hockey might have done that.

3226
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:24,570
I probably hockey right?

3227
01:21:24,571 --> 01:21:27,810
Hockey's some rough fucking dude's
thinking about how many games they play,

3228
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,170
the cardio I used to,

3229
01:21:30,171 --> 01:21:31,770
I used to train with some
professional hockey players.

3230
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,360
They are fucking gangster.

3231
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,520
They also party harder than
any professional athlete.

3232
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:35,731
I know.

3233
01:21:35,731 --> 01:21:37,380
Think about how stupid noses are.

3234
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:43,080
So weak ass little structure and how
stupid all someone has to do is smash it

3235
01:21:43,081 --> 01:21:43,341
and you,

3236
01:21:43,341 --> 01:21:45,600
you're like down to like 60% strength.

3237
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,460
All they have to do is destroy that thing.

3238
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:49,350
Do you think our noses are
meant to be smashed though?

3239
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:54,620
Well why is there like that and this
world full jazz shows chimpanzees they got

3240
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:58,200
strong knows it's trap
punching a giraffe bitch.

3241
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,093
It's odd.

3242
01:21:59,210 --> 01:21:59,710
Eyes.

3243
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:02,910
Eyes are wide and kip
really break a cat's nose.

3244
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:05,730
Can you know he could punch a
house cat right in the face.

3245
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:09,690
It will kill you and your sleep made made
to kill you with its face and they're

3246
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:10,030
no.

3247
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:11,430
Well their noses are all wet.

3248
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,400
Hold these guys.

3249
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,320
Oh my God.

3250
01:22:13,321 --> 01:22:13,681
It's funny.

3251
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:14,700
He's fucking boys.

3252
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:16,650
Oh.

3253
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:17,850
Cobbles basketballs in trail.

3254
01:22:17,851 --> 01:22:19,250
Coddles about to go O'Connell.

3255
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:21,080
And when one of these guys
shoots where I take down,

3256
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,020
it's,

3257
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:22,261
you know,

3258
01:22:22,261 --> 01:22:22,910
it's go time.

3259
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:24,330
But college took a big deep breath too.

3260
01:22:24,331 --> 01:22:24,690
That was,

3261
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:27,360
he looked at shots not good for his head.

3262
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:28,523
Please don't go to them.

3263
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,310
That's either these guys grabble.

3264
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:35,760
It's interesting when you see a guy
come back while he's hurt because like

3265
01:22:35,761 --> 01:22:36,660
that's what you find out,

3266
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:37,411
what kind of condition.

3267
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:38,580
You're really correct.

3268
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:40,640
How quickly can you come
back while you're hurt?

3269
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:41,493
Yeah.

3270
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:46,060
Do you ever see the training fatal
you do you like to drink wobbled?

3271
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:46,381
No.

3272
01:22:46,381 --> 01:22:51,150
He would fly around in circles like use
punch and then spar or do running and

3273
01:22:51,151 --> 01:22:51,950
shook.

3274
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:52,800
It was nuts.

3275
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,730
Hey Man,

3276
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:54,563
but he needed that.

3277
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,990
He needed get that shit
off against Maldonado.

3278
01:22:58,230 --> 01:22:58,650
Well,

3279
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:00,990
you know he's a tough guy that paid off,

3280
01:23:00,991 --> 01:23:03,090
but I don't like the way
he approached that fight.

3281
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,590
This is a guy who went
toe to toe with cop.

3282
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:06,453
Okay.

3283
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,010
I don't know what kind of
testing they had him under.

3284
01:23:09,011 --> 01:23:10,340
Do you do your yeah.

3285
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:11,283
None.

3286
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,733
Yes sir.

3287
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,690
Now you fucking kidding me right there.

3288
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:14,981
Kay.

3289
01:23:14,981 --> 01:23:15,401
It looks,

3290
01:23:15,401 --> 01:23:17,560
it's like Novitsky likes
it called the smell test.

3291
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:18,280
He didn't,

3292
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,370
he smelled like Beo
and kettle bells to me.

3293
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,271
Yeah,

3294
01:23:22,271 --> 01:23:23,640
it does smell like any steroids.

3295
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:25,600
I still like cabbage and potatoes.

3296
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:26,710
He looked like shit,

3297
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:28,923
man.

3298
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:31,691
He's so close.

3299
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:32,530
Come to the UFC.

3300
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,120
I don't give a fuck.

3301
01:23:34,121 --> 01:23:38,680
It's not 2007 you get eight
the fuck up before this fight,

3302
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,260
I would have argued with you or no.

3303
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,840
Maldonado exposed him
in in a bit of a way,

3304
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:45,270
but it also could be that he hasn't.

3305
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,330
What was the last time you competed?

3306
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,680
How long ago was his last fight?

3307
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:48,543
Not that far.

3308
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:51,010
Fargo Hoodie fife out that
chump and beat the fuck out.

3309
01:23:51,011 --> 01:23:51,844
I'm like right.

3310
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:54,250
They beat up some scrub.

3311
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:54,701
Right.

3312
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,800
So was it a scrub you
thought make you work in,

3313
01:23:56,801 --> 01:23:57,634
in Russia,

3314
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:05,050
but he got paid to go
down the line in the show.

3315
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,943
Oh yeah.

3316
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:06,913
He was to fight.

3317
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:08,650
Get to fucking fights.

3318
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:09,300
Yeah.

3319
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:10,071
Before that is old.

3320
01:24:10,071 --> 01:24:10,870
But he should know.

3321
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:13,240
He took that guy down and
punched him until he tapped.

3322
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:14,051
It was in December.

3323
01:24:14,051 --> 01:24:14,171
Yeah.

3324
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:15,430
It was a terrible fucking fight.

3325
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:16,900
He's not fighting anyone.

3326
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,700
So you come to come to the UFC,

3327
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:19,240
hey,

3328
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:22,210
we're going to test you unless your bank
colors and these guys are to get fucked

3329
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:22,451
up.

3330
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:23,310
So a boss,

3331
01:24:23,311 --> 01:24:23,681
he's got,

3332
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:23,791
oh,

3333
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:26,920
call my ground or all
them I got bottle's fine.

3334
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:27,671
Oh my God.

3335
01:24:27,671 --> 01:24:28,540
This fights crazy.

3336
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:29,790
Oh Wow.

3337
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:30,220
Oh Oh.

3338
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:31,450
Meaning he's gonna Finish him.

3339
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,360
I think it come calm.

3340
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:33,000
Strong.

3341
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,710
It keeps that half card will keep
it to half guys got the under hook.

3342
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:36,581
Oh,

3343
01:24:36,581 --> 01:24:38,920
bossy with his own under
hook on the legs stops.

3344
01:24:38,921 --> 01:24:39,760
It stops a pass.

3345
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,410
Oh Shit.

3346
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:47,010
Oh,

3347
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:47,520
okay.

3348
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,353
Oh Shit.

3349
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:49,120
What?

3350
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:49,690
Bossy willing.

3351
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:50,760
This fucking fight.

3352
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:51,181
Damn.

3353
01:24:51,181 --> 01:24:51,841
Bossy is tough.

3354
01:24:51,841 --> 01:24:55,110
It's dude so fucked up.

3355
01:24:55,111 --> 01:24:56,020
This is a war.

3356
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:00,540
The Tan Jeremiah Wallace is the one it
looks like he should be hopping out of a

3357
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:01,260
cares.

3358
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,240
Bossy looks like it's not bossy wash.

3359
01:25:06,660 --> 01:25:07,790
Don't fucking do it.

3360
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:08,663
I said,

3361
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:11,750
did you say what keeps me?

3362
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,600
Cake boss is the one with
the whole Kogan skin.

3363
01:25:15,601 --> 01:25:16,620
The hot dog skin.

3364
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:16,921
Yeah.

3365
01:25:16,921 --> 01:25:17,754
That's him on top.

3366
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,610
Hot Dog skin is hilarious,

3367
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:20,900
man.

3368
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,640
His best looking guys have hot dogs.

3369
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:23,640
They all have hot dogs.

3370
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:25,600
Whole cloak.

3371
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,230
Ian Looks like dude.

3372
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:28,130
Hot,

3373
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:28,861
dark skins.

3374
01:25:28,861 --> 01:25:30,000
The best expression ever.

3375
01:25:30,001 --> 01:25:31,930
Why did you come up with
that for a while ago?

3376
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:32,791
A while ago.

3377
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:33,624
It's beautiful.

3378
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:39,030
There's a few a few descriptions in
my life that have really sunk home.

3379
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:39,641
Oh Shit.

3380
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:41,520
Oh bossy with the hammer fist.

3381
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:42,781
Connell's in trouble,

3382
01:25:42,781 --> 01:25:43,030
man.

3383
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,220
Yeah,

3384
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:43,861
he's in trouble.

3385
01:25:43,861 --> 01:25:44,790
Carl's losing this fight.

3386
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,130
Toss these in a lot of trouble right here.

3387
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,350
Exhausts for sure.

3388
01:25:49,351 --> 01:25:50,100
One and one.

3389
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:51,300
I mean you say he's losing his fight,

3390
01:25:51,301 --> 01:25:52,110
but this is a draw.

3391
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:53,070
I mean he's in trouble.

3392
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:53,281
No,

3393
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:53,581
I agree.

3394
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:54,450
I think if someone said,

3395
01:25:54,451 --> 01:25:55,530
hey shot bet on this fight,

3396
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:56,320
I got bossy.

3397
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,153
Okay.

3398
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:01,110
[inaudible] fucking never know
what the dude local O'Connell.

3399
01:26:01,111 --> 01:26:02,780
He's just so God damn tough.

3400
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,360
It's a way to survive
either one of these guys.

3401
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,090
Well posses one and
one one 32nd knock out,

3402
01:26:08,091 --> 01:26:11,470
one 59 second knocked out and the
way he survived that onslaught,

3403
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,220
I mean his head snapped back,

3404
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:16,590
his eyes rolled back and bounced off
the ground and you still got back up,

3405
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:18,770
but she'd be jumping out of the cake.

3406
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:20,100
Authorization for Lumbar.

3407
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,910
This hill is not a lot of Jujitsu.

3408
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,340
Jujitsu here.

3409
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,160
He just went to the hundred
percent control the puzzle.

3410
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:28,910
It's just,

3411
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:31,610
I wish they would stand up and
blast each other in the face.

3412
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,600
It sound like a fan of the tab out.

3413
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,000
He's got giant.

3414
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:36,913
Here we go.

3415
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:39,950
What's the new tap out
shirt firing the kid.

3416
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,071
Oh my God.

3417
01:26:46,071 --> 01:26:46,610
You're right.

3418
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:47,480
They're everywhere.

3419
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:48,351
They are everywhere.

3420
01:26:48,351 --> 01:26:49,490
I see him all the time on my shows.

3421
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:50,290
Oh Shit.

3422
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:52,580
[inaudible] needed the body.

3423
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:53,080
This dude,

3424
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,430
you got that fucking
coward guy wearing one.

3425
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,710
Yeah.

3426
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,260
Calling card that he loves us.

3427
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:00,080
I know he loved the series.

3428
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,180
He liked the three these hearings
is that guy's a big deal.

3429
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:02,760
I know.

3430
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,200
Or to support his name.

3431
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:07,100
Colin cowherd and he's a good guy,

3432
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:07,341
man.

3433
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:08,400
Famous to talk.

3434
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:08,661
Look,

3435
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:09,590
if I know who you are,

3436
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:12,770
you're famous and you watch
that show religiously,

3437
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:13,040
right?

3438
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:13,251
Yeah.

3439
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:14,084
He's my favorite.

3440
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:14,931
He's good man.

3441
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:16,310
Guest ask good questions.

3442
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:17,330
Just smart guys.

3443
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:18,164
Objective gun.

3444
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,083
Yeah.

3445
01:27:21,050 --> 01:27:21,883
I can't believe you posted,

3446
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:25,040
but that other guy that's like
a really famous guy there.

3447
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:26,060
Skip Bayless.

3448
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:27,440
There's a CEO guy,

3449
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:29,750
Neil Patrick.

3450
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:30,210
Yeah.

3451
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:31,550
I think that guy's show recently.

3452
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,480
Really?

3453
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,450
I'm surprised you did that show.

3454
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:33,980
Well,

3455
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,720
I was doing like a tour for the UFC.

3456
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,550
It just seemed like a nice guy too,

3457
01:27:37,551 --> 01:27:39,850
but he definitely didn't
seem like he knows a lot.

3458
01:27:39,851 --> 01:27:40,820
I don't know shit about fighting.

3459
01:27:40,821 --> 01:27:41,121
No.

3460
01:27:41,121 --> 01:27:41,421
Well,

3461
01:27:41,421 --> 01:27:41,661
you know,

3462
01:27:41,661 --> 01:27:42,650
you ask good questions.

3463
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,260
He's a professional.

3464
01:27:44,261 --> 01:27:44,490
Yeah.

3465
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:44,691
Oh,

3466
01:27:44,691 --> 01:27:45,471
super professional.

3467
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:46,191
He's one of the best,

3468
01:27:46,191 --> 01:27:48,950
a lot of them bring on UFC because
they realize it gets ratings,

3469
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,330
but they don't know about the sport.

3470
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,500
But he was asking me questions like,

3471
01:27:51,501 --> 01:27:51,921
what's,

3472
01:27:51,921 --> 01:27:54,830
who's the most legendary
MMA fighter of all time?

3473
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:55,310
Well,

3474
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:55,791
excuse me,

3475
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:56,750
so it's pretty general.

3476
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:57,111
I said,

3477
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:57,271
well,

3478
01:27:57,271 --> 01:27:57,471
I know,

3479
01:27:57,471 --> 01:27:57,770
but I said,

3480
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:58,603
I went with [inaudible].

3481
01:27:59,190 --> 01:27:59,521
I said like,

3482
01:27:59,521 --> 01:28:00,130
he was straight.

3483
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:02,090
Who was the most important
one of those things?

3484
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:03,350
Who's the biggest star?

3485
01:28:03,351 --> 01:28:03,831
Like I said,

3486
01:28:03,831 --> 01:28:05,780
he's crazy because he was the original,

3487
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:08,270
cause he changed everything about Ms. Dot.

3488
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:10,100
Pioneer who's the Bruce Lee of a sport,

3489
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:13,730
change everything about martial arts with
his victories because everybody had to

3490
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:14,090
go,

3491
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:14,750
wow,

3492
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,583
what is he doing?

3493
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:16,603
And then we had to learn it.

3494
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:17,480
Correct.

3495
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:18,021
Changed it.

3496
01:28:18,021 --> 01:28:18,560
That's fair.

3497
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:18,860
Yeah.

3498
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:23,860
I mean obviously it was his whole family
and his is his uncle and his dad and

3499
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:25,450
yeah,

3500
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:25,710
dude,

3501
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:25,960
I,

3502
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,340
I had to do a short,

3503
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:28,650
I had to do a,

3504
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:29,470
uh,

3505
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:30,790
a tribute showed us,

3506
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:31,400
uh,

3507
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,070
Kimbo slice for spike dude.

3508
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:34,900
They were,

3509
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,020
they would ask me like the,

3510
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:36,640
you know,

3511
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:36,850
I'm not,

3512
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:39,890
I'm only t I'm going to get flack for
this with asking me for the Mount Rushmore

3513
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,100
and I see can't be up there without
Kimbo slice for what he did on Youtube.

3514
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,570
Stuff like that kick to the body.

3515
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:44,961
Dude,

3516
01:28:44,961 --> 01:28:47,060
I started crying so bad is fucking,

3517
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:48,980
I don't know if they're going to
what they're going to do with it but,

3518
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:51,260
well I wouldn't agree with that
as far as I'm Mount Rushmore,

3519
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:56,030
but I would definitely agree with it as
far as like a guy who is super important

3520
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,570
for the overall picture,

3521
01:28:58,370 --> 01:28:59,660
MMA is end.

3522
01:28:59,661 --> 01:29:03,690
The difference between like fighters in
a May fighters and then a guy like Kimbo

3523
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:08,020
who was a backyard fighter with
den became a legit MMA fights.

3524
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,300
There is a significance is the idea that
you can be somebody in your backyard

3525
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:13,500
and if you,

3526
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:16,740
if you have the skills or
the personality or something,

3527
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:17,574
the magic,

3528
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,473
you can make it to

3529
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:21,811
knock them out.

3530
01:29:21,811 --> 01:29:22,760
Spinning back fist,

3531
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:23,690
the candles on queer.

3532
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:26,640
Oh Wow.

3533
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,020
Oh my God.

3534
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:30,780
Crazy fucking white people,

3535
01:29:30,781 --> 01:29:31,614
man.

3536
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,213
Fuck.

3537
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,153
Keep going.

3538
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:37,440
Don't take it up a breather here.

3539
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:37,590
Yeah,

3540
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:39,270
don't do that chaos.

3541
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:40,920
Oh my God,

3542
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:42,030
this is crazy.

3543
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:43,591
Oh,

3544
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:44,424
nice left.

3545
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:46,290
It's got a very nice left hand.

3546
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:46,441
Yeah,

3547
01:29:46,441 --> 01:29:46,771
he does.

3548
01:29:46,771 --> 01:29:50,910
He's been landed on the mixes it up
between like a half a jab and a hook.

3549
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,710
It's like Michael Jai Smith or whatever.

3550
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,120
He said sharp white Chai White.

3551
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,080
I met John Michael J.

3552
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:57,090
Smith.

3553
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:58,040
Tom Smith is my name.

3554
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:00,720
Hey Dude.

3555
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,553
Hey Dude,

3556
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:02,070
dude.

3557
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:02,940
I'm about Jason's dude.

3558
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:04,910
Mind your p's and q's around.

3559
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,150
When is Tony Baltimore fight
and Hubby even over men off.

3560
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:08,551
No,

3561
01:30:08,551 --> 01:30:09,384
Ferguson.

3562
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:10,703
Ferguson different.

3563
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,510
You fucking get the wrong right.

3564
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:16,291
Oh Shit.

3565
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:17,124
That's good.

3566
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:17,820
That's good.

3567
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:18,230
I kept,

3568
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:19,220
oh,

3569
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:21,240
we're throwing spinning shit.

3570
01:30:21,241 --> 01:30:22,074
Huh?

3571
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,320
Greatest Nick Diaz quotes of all time or,

3572
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:27,721
oh,

3573
01:30:27,721 --> 01:30:28,860
we're throwing spinning shit.

3574
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:29,390
Oh my God.

3575
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:30,480
They were going to high five again.

3576
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:32,130
Bossy is like loving function,

3577
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,630
high fiving and kill it.

3578
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:35,240
He's enjoying himself.

3579
01:30:35,241 --> 01:30:36,330
This is the time it was my boys.

3580
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,320
He can't keep high fiving.

3581
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:38,131
He looked,

3582
01:30:38,131 --> 01:30:38,520
dude,

3583
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:39,870
that guy looks fucking fresh.

3584
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:40,980
Look how good a shape he is.

3585
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:41,940
In third round.

3586
01:30:41,941 --> 01:30:44,190
He's moving light on his feet
and he's eight some shots.

3587
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:46,580
Who calls noses in pieces.

3588
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:47,510
It's a mess,

3589
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:48,661
but look at Bossy.

3590
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:49,860
He's nice movement.

3591
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:50,880
He was moving around.

3592
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:52,380
He's also catching his breath right?

3593
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,560
Oh Man.

3594
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:56,161
He's punching.

3595
01:30:56,161 --> 01:30:56,994
Well,

3596
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:59,700
fight is fucking crazy.

3597
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:00,630
Some rock 'em sock.

3598
01:31:00,631 --> 01:31:01,540
'Em Dude,

3599
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:04,050
this guy's Kennedy for fight of the year.

3600
01:31:04,051 --> 01:31:04,531
My wrong,

3601
01:31:04,531 --> 01:31:05,364
my God.

3602
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:06,940
There's like rocky fairly brawler.

3603
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:07,933
I'm swimming.

3604
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:09,360
I'm three wines deep.

3605
01:31:09,361 --> 01:31:10,141
I don't know Joe,

3606
01:31:10,141 --> 01:31:12,000
but from the three wine glasses.

3607
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:12,421
Yes,

3608
01:31:12,421 --> 01:31:13,254
you're right.

3609
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:14,550
Certainly the brawl here.

3610
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:15,753
Oh,

3611
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:17,190
when was Roy Rory,

3612
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:19,080
Rory and fucking,

3613
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,130
that was a while ago though.

3614
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:20,881
That was a year ago.

3615
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:22,530
I think this fights like this.

3616
01:31:22,531 --> 01:31:25,350
I think we should all have a
button at home that we can press.

3617
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:26,880
We just say no decision.

3618
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:27,830
No one can lose.

3619
01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:31,320
This can lose this fight we're
going to make America just spoke.

3620
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:32,154
Neither one of you guys.

3621
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:33,923
There's no way.

3622
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:37,190
The night bonus for sure.

3623
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:40,140
Unless someone stops someone.

3624
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,330
If this fight ends right now,

3625
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:43,320
the way this is going,

3626
01:31:43,321 --> 01:31:44,700
how the fuck do you pick a winner?

3627
01:31:44,701 --> 01:31:45,600
This God damn fight.

3628
01:31:45,601 --> 01:31:46,510
It's not fair.

3629
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,750
I don't know how easy life within fair.

3630
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:49,650
It's a draw.

3631
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,120
How do you feel that he

3632
01:31:53,210 --> 01:31:54,043
cut?

3633
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:56,533
It's easy.

3634
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:57,511
You've got to do any money,

3635
01:31:57,511 --> 01:31:57,741
man.

3636
01:31:57,741 --> 01:31:57,960
Wow.

3637
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:58,460
God,

3638
01:31:58,460 --> 01:31:58,880
God,

3639
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,220
I don't want to hear
you say Michael's here.

3640
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:00,611
White again.

3641
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:01,444
Don't bring it.

3642
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:03,670
Don't put his mouth.

3643
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,010
Put his name in your mouth cause
you just mind your p's and q's.

3644
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,050
Throw strikes.

3645
01:32:08,051 --> 01:32:09,250
You could look at total strikes,

3646
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:10,120
obviously.

3647
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,560
Round one and round two.

3648
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:11,831
One,

3649
01:32:11,831 --> 01:32:12,010
one.

3650
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:12,490
[inaudible].

3651
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:12,701
One,

3652
01:32:12,701 --> 01:32:13,331
one for Bossy,

3653
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:16,600
but you can't just calculate
all the strikes all together.

3654
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:17,503
Oh,

3655
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,390
that's a store that's right there.

3656
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:20,710
He should both make an agreement.

3657
01:32:20,711 --> 01:32:22,480
No wrestlers still gangster in it.

3658
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,081
Look at this.

3659
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:24,790
Get this out on the break.

3660
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:26,063
Look at this.

3661
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:27,880
Look at what the cloud boss.

3662
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:28,301
Hey boss.

3663
01:32:28,301 --> 01:32:28,751
Hey boss.

3664
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:30,790
Say 50 50 seconds left here.

3665
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:33,720
I'm going to both set enough can stop it.

3666
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:36,340
Now these guys are friends after this.

3667
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:37,450
This is not an ironic,

3668
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,190
every time they see each other,

3669
01:32:39,191 --> 01:32:40,690
they hug each other for
the rest of their lives.

3670
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:41,190
Eh?

3671
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:42,023
It depends who wins.

3672
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:42,963
Oh Shit.

3673
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,040
Oh,

3674
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:46,263
nobody's winning.

3675
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:46,640
Oh No,

3676
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:47,900
the one.

3677
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:49,360
I bet you money.

3678
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:50,350
Boston wins this fight.

3679
01:32:50,351 --> 01:32:50,800
Really?

3680
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,633
You want to bet?

3681
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:54,140
Oh con terminate I believe.

3682
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:54,550
I believe.

3683
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:56,800
I believe that I bought say won,

3684
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,680
but he's fighting in Canada
should be going to bed over there.

3685
01:32:58,910 --> 01:32:59,110
Eddie,

3686
01:32:59,110 --> 01:32:59,943
you're pretty quiet.

3687
01:33:00,010 --> 01:33:00,970
Oh you want to bet right now?

3688
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,151
Yeah,

3689
01:33:01,151 --> 01:33:03,640
I got best bet right now.

3690
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:08,150
Ten thousand fifteen thousand
truckloads a shirt on,

3691
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:08,410
bro.

3692
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:11,500
I think that surgery's only
give you the free pass.

3693
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:12,334
This is

3694
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:17,553
my God.

3695
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:19,550
Oh fuck.

3696
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,190
Now he got buzzed a well fuck.

3697
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,300
I got by say too,

3698
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:28,330
cause I cause the peer
pressure back to Kimball.

3699
01:33:28,331 --> 01:33:31,870
All I was saying is what he did because
he brought in the average fan from

3700
01:33:31,871 --> 01:33:33,730
youtube to mixed martial arts.

3701
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:34,960
That's why he's a big deal.

3702
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,680
Even when I fight,

3703
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,430
my mom knew who Kimbo was
from the youtube videos.

3704
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:40,443
I definitely see that.

3705
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:41,170
That's all I'm saying.

3706
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:42,820
I definitely see he's an important figure.

3707
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:46,210
I just wouldn't say it's
only like four or five.

3708
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:46,571
No,

3709
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:47,140
my Mt.

3710
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:47,650
Rush voice.

3711
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:49,450
Oh horses.

3712
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:52,420
One boy's supposed to be five I think.

3713
01:33:52,421 --> 01:33:52,871
I believe so.

3714
01:33:52,871 --> 01:33:53,021
Yeah.

3715
01:33:53,021 --> 01:33:54,030
I forget who was supposed to be number.

3716
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:54,700
Fuck.

3717
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:57,640
How about we put Ronald motherfucking
Reagan and it and say it's done.

3718
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:59,320
I'm not mad at that.

3719
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:00,230
Oh man,

3720
01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:00,700
man,

3721
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,690
Ronald Reagan Bitch,

3722
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:04,060

3723
01:34:04,061 --> 01:34:05,800
We kind of like just say no,

3724
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:06,850
I'm a Reagan Fan.

3725
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:07,810
I don't care what anybody says.

3726
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:08,471
He's right.

3727
01:34:08,471 --> 01:34:09,520
He's a [inaudible] news.

3728
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:12,890
Put me off to sleep when he was a ties.

3729
01:34:12,891 --> 01:34:16,390
Tim Fox News Guy.

3730
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:17,253

I'm a real is for right.

3732
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:22,450
I love saying that,

3733
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,780
but I thought there might have been a
fifth or maybe they were thinking about

3734
01:34:25,781 --> 01:34:26,500
that name.

3735
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,221
The four Brian,

3736
01:34:27,221 --> 01:34:29,810

and named the 40 years at

3737
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:32,260
Mount Rushmore.

3738
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:33,910
What does is this Johnny
Depp and a motorcycle?

3739
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:34,720
No,

3740
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,830
John Depths off everything,

3741
01:34:35,831 --> 01:34:35,981

3742
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:37,570
I can't be him bitches and do commercials.

3743
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:39,190
There's no clip of Ronald.

3744
01:34:39,191 --> 01:34:41,680
I'm going to go with Washington.

3745
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:43,460
They blink him.

3746
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:44,270
That's not him.

3747
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:44,740
Joe.

3748
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:47,480

3749
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,290

3750
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,370
That's four.

3751
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:52,630
There's only four and Lincoln.

3752
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:53,730
Is that right?

3753
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:54,640
I think he's right.

3754
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:57,660
You guys.

3755
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:58,020
Ancient

3756
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,060
history doesn't matter.

3757
01:34:59,061 --> 01:35:00,510
I can't believe I got it.

3758
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:02,400
I got lucky on that one guy.

3759
01:35:02,401 --> 01:35:03,560
So if you're like an MMA,

3760
01:35:03,561 --> 01:35:04,850

Chuck Liddell.

3764
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,313

3766
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:12,140
Do you have to have rampage?

You have to PSP.

3773
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:19,701
You have to have GSP.

3774
01:35:19,701 --> 01:35:20,690
And he got an answer in Silva.

01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:25,700
That's too many.

3778
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:29,060
Let's say there's no way I'm going
to have fatal on the cro cop.

3779
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,930
Oh yeah.

3780
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:32,170
You got to have faith or for all time.

Fuck you.

And Megan my shoulder.

3785
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,700
I was just going to say
that and maybe even Ninja.

3786
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,230
How dare you come on.

3787
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:40,480

It was a bad motherfucker.

3791
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:48,080
Years to probably compared to Shogun.

3792
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:48,860
That's true.

3793
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:49,321
His preface,

3794
01:35:49,321 --> 01:35:50,990
it shows this is crazy.

3795
01:35:50,991 --> 01:35:51,620
Accomplished.

3796
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:52,040

That's awesome.

3799
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:54,140
Hard loss.

3800
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:54,381
Yeah.

3801
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:54,951

man.

3805
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:01,280
That's a hard loss.

3806
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:04,530
At least you see that sweet
tattoo kind of was a bad month.

3807
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:08,300
Europe you or mean
being dead shit is sick.

3808
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:10,350
I wish my brownness could get that color.

3809
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,100
I feel very uncomfortable
about coming here and this.

3810
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:15,380
That's how I look at this.

3811
01:36:15,381 --> 01:36:16,111
That's a caramel.

3812
01:36:16,111 --> 01:36:21,111
Rob Did not want a fifth face to be
carved in 1936 can be handled by the Susan

3813
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:21,890
B.

3814
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:24,200
Anthony should be out a bunch of
fucking guys trying to get laid.

3815
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:28,900
But Susan B.

3816
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,250
Anthony that Mount Rushmore,

3817
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,700

3818
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:37,340
look.

3819
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:38,180
Terrible people.

3820
01:36:38,181 --> 01:36:39,014
That's what's wrong with them.

3821
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,970
But she was the first feminist.

3822
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,571
This boom,

3823
01:36:41,571 --> 01:36:41,871
boom.

3824
01:36:41,871 --> 01:36:43,110
You can't have her look at this.

3825
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:43,850
Boom,

3826
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:46,640
look at this one left and then this
is the one that shuts the lights off.

3827
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:47,151
You got to,

3828
01:36:47,151 --> 01:36:47,800
yeah,

3829
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,300
I mean the dude one lounge to him.

3830
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:50,480
Is that a ten eight round?

3831
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:51,343
He's so tough.

3832
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:52,390
He's so tough.

3833
01:36:52,391 --> 01:36:53,560
And so he said,

3834
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,310
that's gotta be ten eight
it has to be attending.

3835
01:36:55,670 --> 01:36:55,941
Well,

3836
01:36:55,941 --> 01:36:57,560
I don't know what is and isn't anymore,

3837
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:57,831
man.

3838
01:36:57,831 --> 01:36:58,011
I don't know.

3839
01:36:58,011 --> 01:37:00,500
Who knows what these fucking rafts judges,

3840
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:00,951
but it's,

3841
01:37:00,951 --> 01:37:02,000
I don't think it's done.

3842
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,470
I don't think it's done the right way.

3843
01:37:03,471 --> 01:37:05,210
I don't think we should
have a 10 point system.

3844
01:37:05,211 --> 01:37:07,220
I think it should be like a hundred
points or something like that,

3845
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:13,780
or 30 points or this should be a bunch
of points where it's not ten nine and

3846
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:14,271
half,

3847
01:37:14,271 --> 01:37:14,631
10 at night.

3848
01:37:14,631 --> 01:37:16,880
Especially with the
grappling and the submission,

3849
01:37:16,881 --> 01:37:17,720
it doesn't make sense.

3850
01:37:17,721 --> 01:37:21,290
Especially if I'm get off my back and
I'm constantly having the guy in danger,

3851
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:25,520
or if I'm a counter restaurant is not
saying we disagree with this decision.

3852
01:37:25,521 --> 01:37:25,940
Right.

3853
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:27,020
I'm not going to disagree with it.

3854
01:37:27,021 --> 01:37:27,530
You know?

3855
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:28,270
Like I said,

3856
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:29,180
it was an awesome fight.

3857
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:30,381
Winds deep.

3858
01:37:30,381 --> 01:37:31,214
I don't know,

3859
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:35,870
could easily finish only MMA.

3860
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:39,583
There's no submission.

3861
01:37:39,660 --> 01:37:41,420
Do you feel wait,

3862
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:41,821
grow.

3863
01:37:41,821 --> 01:37:42,710
What if you had,

3864
01:37:42,711 --> 01:37:46,520
what if you had grappling
judges and striking Joe?

3865
01:37:46,521 --> 01:37:48,500
How much of MMA judges fuck all that.

3866
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:49,760
Right,

3867
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,890
but what if you had x fighters as judges?

3868
01:37:51,891 --> 01:37:53,820
That's what you have.

3869
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:54,501
Here's what you want.

3870
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:56,550
You Want Matt who judged for pride?

3871
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:56,820
Yeah.

3872
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:58,680
Matt Hume is who you should have judging.

3873
01:37:58,681 --> 01:37:59,100
Yeah,

3874
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,140
you should have gotten his own.

3875
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,070
It's a handful.

3876
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:02,460
Understand like Dwayne,

3877
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:06,240
Dwayne Ludwig is another great example.

3878
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:06,920
You know,

3879
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:09,900
and have people that have a
full understanding of MMA.

3880
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:15,800
Bj Penn was the judge of his knowledge
of anatomy or all think of amazing rich

3881
01:38:16,441 --> 01:38:17,274
Franklin,

3882
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:18,721
rich Franklin,

3883
01:38:18,721 --> 01:38:19,554
rich Franklin,

3884
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:20,850
Jens Pulver.

3885
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:24,300
Think about how many great
fighters that don't fight anymore,

3886
01:38:24,301 --> 01:38:27,900
but have a deep knowledge
of MMA would be judging.

3887
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,071
Why are they not?

3888
01:38:29,071 --> 01:38:29,630
Why did they,

3889
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:31,700
he's better than who data.

3890
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:32,843
Why don't they,

3891
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:35,460
why don't they reach out to those guys?

3892
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,030
Well,

3893
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:37,140
there's commission

3894
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:44,460
that's part of the [inaudible]
some mother fucker.

3895
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:46,590
This was a date with my boyfriend,

3896
01:38:46,591 --> 01:38:46,830
right?

3897
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:48,180
That's big and hits hardest.

3898
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:52,710
Does Jujitsu man underrating
two as of lately.

3899
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:57,210
But I was impressed when he fought Ben
when he fought Ben and almost caught him

3900
01:38:57,211 --> 01:38:58,350
in an arm bar from the bottom.

3901
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:02,860
And I was thinking that [inaudible]
is a crafty guy that doesn't sit still

3902
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:04,440
fighting a long time,

3903
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,730
but he keeps getting better.

3904
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,290
That's hard as fuck.

3905
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,153
Definitely does.

3906
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,450
He doesn't rest on his laurels.

3907
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:12,180
And if you watch him fight now
he fights much more technical.

3908
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:14,400
He doesn't unload like big bombs.

3909
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:15,323
So because of that,

3910
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:16,021
well he does.

3911
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:17,520
We'll still has that with Ben.

3912
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:19,500
He caught Ben and he hit
him with like a sauna.

3913
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:20,060
Upper cuts.

3914
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:20,700
Yeah,

3915
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:24,930
but he's been fighting more technical
but then he's harnessing that tower.

3916
01:39:24,931 --> 01:39:25,150
Yeah,

3917
01:39:25,150 --> 01:39:25,810
he's getting,

3918
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:26,830
he's up that trend now.

3919
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:32,510
Fought for title Anderson in his prime
fun was my boyfriend so he can squat shut

3920
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,153
up.

3921
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:36,920
It is a tough really is.

3922
01:39:37,890 --> 01:39:39,540
It's a tough fight for both guys.

3923
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:44,340
Donald is no joke at one
70 like him has more tools.

3924
01:39:44,370 --> 01:39:44,700
Yup.

3925
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:45,071
He's,

3926
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:47,130
he's nasty off of his back.

3927
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,410
His kickboxing is legit as fuck.

3928
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,900
He wants to see what steers kicks.

3929
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:52,470
You know what scares me is Donald,

3930
01:39:52,471 --> 01:39:53,760
when he fights good boxers,

3931
01:39:53,761 --> 01:39:56,850
struggles cause cause and even Donald,

3932
01:39:56,851 --> 01:39:57,141
Mitzi,

3933
01:39:57,141 --> 01:39:57,391
he goes,

3934
01:39:57,391 --> 01:39:58,680
I go forward or backwards.

3935
01:39:58,681 --> 01:39:59,550
I don't take any angles.

3936
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,890
And when you're facing a
guy who has good boxing,

3937
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,491
you're in trouble,

3938
01:40:02,491 --> 01:40:02,850
man.

3939
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:06,690
I hear a guy like him say that and I
got to assume that he's working on that.

3940
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,030
I've got a suit hope telling you that,

3941
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:10,470
that he's trying to get better at it,

3942
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,200
but you always got to,

3943
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:16,980
you got to kind of guess where a guys
that based on his previous performances.

3944
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:18,480
So if you look at his
previous performance,

3945
01:40:18,481 --> 01:40:20,610
like Nate Diaz was a really
troublesome fight for him.

3946
01:40:20,611 --> 01:40:21,480
He had a really hard time,

3947
01:40:21,481 --> 01:40:22,530
particularly in the first round.

3948
01:40:22,531 --> 01:40:23,460
What can they do?

3949
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,810
Bosses actually well,

3950
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:28,950
but I also think there was some emotional
stuff going on in that because Nate

3951
01:40:28,951 --> 01:40:32,930
talked him into a coma a hundred percent
Nate knocked his hat off and cow,

3952
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:33,783
he's a nice guy.

3953
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:36,900
Like if you see cowboy when he
was lining up to fight Kobe,

3954
01:40:36,901 --> 01:40:37,710
like the weigh ins,

3955
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:38,610
they're real friendly.

3956
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:40,140
Cowboy's a real friendly guy.

3957
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:41,820
He's a really,

3958
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:43,050
really good guy.

3959
01:40:43,051 --> 01:40:43,920
He's a really good guy.

3960
01:40:43,921 --> 01:40:44,820
So he doesn't want,

3961
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:46,560
he doesn't need or want to hate.

3962
01:40:46,561 --> 01:40:47,510
You didn't need animosity.

3963
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:49,650
But I think Nate,

3964
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:52,530
Nate really got in his head
with that shit and it was like,

3965
01:40:52,531 --> 01:40:52,850
wow,

3966
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:53,683
a lot emotional.

3967
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:54,040
I

3968
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:54,873
mean this guy was like,

3969
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:55,480
Nate,

3970
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:58,300
Nate's super disrespectful
when he's gonna fight you.

3971
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:00,100
And it's part of the strategy.

3972
01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:01,180
It makes it personal.

3973
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:01,630
Yup.

3974
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:04,720
And to make you think about it because
it makes your emotions ramp up and makes

3975
01:41:04,721 --> 01:41:05,260
you tight.

3976
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,570
Mentioned me making mistakes.

3977
01:41:06,571 --> 01:41:07,404
It makes you make mistakes.

3978
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:07,990
Brilliant.

3979
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:08,530
Very smart.

3980
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:09,363
They're brilliant at it.

3981
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,060
Well it Connor,

3982
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:10,900
we get caught that,

3983
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:11,141
you know,

3984
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:12,010
he's great at that.

3985
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,360
Do you like that?

3986
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:14,160
Cause I,

3987
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:15,400
I go back and forth man,

3988
01:41:15,401 --> 01:41:17,920
because I've seen you like
do I like well Joe's a Aldo.

3989
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:20,020
I love shit talking when
it's done really well.

3990
01:41:20,021 --> 01:41:23,230
But you know what I don't like is it seems
like a lot of people are trying to do

3991
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:25,720
that now that weren't doing
or you know why though?

3992
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:29,320
Because the guys who do it or make it
more money and they're getting more fame.

3993
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:30,310
So now guys,

3994
01:41:30,311 --> 01:41:31,560
it's not in the personality.

3995
01:41:31,561 --> 01:41:33,610
It's on their demeanor
and their trying to do it.

3996
01:41:33,611 --> 01:41:35,020
It's like God damn that is fake.

3997
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:35,943
This is not good.

3998
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:36,813
But that's what you,

3999
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:38,800
that's what you get when you award that.

4000
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:39,400
Yeah.

4001
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:42,170
Cause everyone mimics
the same as NFL mimics.

4002
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:44,810
Everyone mimics willing
to trade off like the Tan,

4003
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:45,340
uh,

4004
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,730
support for,

4005
01:41:46,770 --> 01:41:47,531
for cash.

4006
01:41:47,531 --> 01:41:48,281
That's what it really is.

4007
01:41:48,281 --> 01:41:48,431
Cause,

4008
01:41:48,431 --> 01:41:49,051
why don't you start talking,

4009
01:41:49,051 --> 01:41:50,050
but if it's not your channel,

4010
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:51,760
generally guys,

4011
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:52,660
people aren't into that.

4012
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:55,530
Generally it turns people off and
they generally like it makes it,

4013
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:56,990
makes headlines about that headache.

4014
01:41:57,550 --> 01:42:00,970
Conor never turned anybody off nail named
the most famous fighters in the world.

4015
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:01,804
Floyd Mayweather,

4016
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:03,040
the most biggest shit.

4017
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:03,874
Talk about time.

4018
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:07,600
Conor Mcgregor Shit talker Brock
Lesnar Shit Tacos and think about it.

4019
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:09,220
Connor put everything together.

4020
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:14,380
He had incredible performances and he
talked match combination on who's great at

4021
01:42:14,381 --> 01:42:14,860
talking shit.

4022
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:16,090
Not that great of a fighter,

4023
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:17,560
a good fighter,

4024
01:42:17,561 --> 01:42:22,180
but he wasn't good enough
to be a world champion.

4025
01:42:22,181 --> 01:42:23,770
Came so close against Anderson.

4026
01:42:23,771 --> 01:42:24,181
I know Joe,

4027
01:42:24,181 --> 01:42:25,240
but what got me to the point,

4028
01:42:25,241 --> 01:42:28,640
that shit talking the shit talking but
also the performance is getting Nate,

4029
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:29,471
Nate Marquardt,

4030
01:42:29,471 --> 01:42:30,160
you can't,

4031
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:30,810
you can't say that.

4032
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:33,760
That was [inaudible] with his shit.

4033
01:42:33,761 --> 01:42:35,330
Talking bout some dudes.

4034
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:37,090
Definitely no chills.

4035
01:42:37,091 --> 01:42:37,924
Phenomenal.

4036
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:38,960
Phenomenal athlete.

4037
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:39,670
Great fighter.

4038
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:42,490
I'm just saying that with his
personnel and his shit talking,

4039
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:43,690
it elevated him.

4040
01:42:43,691 --> 01:42:44,290
But yeah,

4041
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:48,700
I think when a guy like
Conor does something that he
did knock out Josie Aldo in

4042
01:42:48,701 --> 01:42:49,421
13 seconds,

4043
01:42:49,421 --> 01:42:49,870
hold it.

4044
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:50,703
He's a different,

4045
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:51,910
it's a different thing.

4046
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:52,241
I agree.

4047
01:42:52,241 --> 01:42:53,590
Like his performances,

4048
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:54,670
he,

4049
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:55,060
his,

4050
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:57,010
his wins were a different thing,

4051
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:59,080
but then it backfires
because when you lose,

4052
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:01,810
he'll get look at Rhonda and full.

4053
01:43:01,811 --> 01:43:02,460
Yeah.

4054
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:04,030
So that brightened up,

4055
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:04,900
that's the price.

4056
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:05,711
But you know what?

4057
01:43:05,711 --> 01:43:06,240
Fuck it.

4058
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,140
You make that money in your bank account.

4059
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:10,090
Guys like Randy couture,

4060
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:11,050
when he loses,

4061
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:11,471
people are like,

4062
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:11,771
fuck,

4063
01:43:11,771 --> 01:43:13,010
you're still a bad motherfucker.

4064
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:13,810
Like no one true.

4065
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:14,680
No one hates him.

4066
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:14,980
You don't.

4067
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:16,390
Those Randy couture days are over.

4068
01:43:16,391 --> 01:43:18,410
My brother Connor changed the entire game.

4069
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:20,253
There's a lot of guys

4070
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:25,720
fighting anymore.

4071
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:26,583
But if he was,

4072
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:30,650
but do you understand that if George St
Jersey appears is a beautiful man who's

4073
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:31,600
a great fighter,

4074
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,160
doesn't catch so much spot on,

4075
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:33,731
he's respectful,

4076
01:43:33,731 --> 01:43:34,564
he wears nice suits.

4077
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:36,370
He would still sell like crazy today.

4078
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,840
I still sell like crazy.

4079
01:43:37,841 --> 01:43:39,010
He came up today and he was,

4080
01:43:39,410 --> 01:43:42,970
cause he was a huge star before onsite
named someone right now who's currently

4081
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:45,730
fighting UFC who's quiet
and as a superstar.

4082
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:47,140
That's interesting.

4083
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:47,921
Well,

4084
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:48,460
you really,

4085
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:53,330
there's the superstars
are Randa Kahn and tough.

4086
01:43:54,010 --> 01:43:57,890
Jon Jones is like on the
brink of superstardom.

4087
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:01,460
If Jon Jones can you get past [inaudible]
and they get record numbers for UFC

4088
01:44:01,461 --> 01:44:03,680
200 and becomes a gigantic event.

4089
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:06,140
John Jones at the door because he,

4090
01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:09,830
because he has great talent but he's
also in the headlines for bat shit.

4091
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:10,880
He's making headlines.

4092
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:12,590
But sometimes that,

4093
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:16,070
I mean if you want to talk about like
what makes someone a famous person,

4094
01:44:16,071 --> 01:44:19,940
sometimes that's almost as important
and it's goofy societal agree as someone

4095
01:44:19,941 --> 01:44:22,430
being a shit talker or look at a guy
like couldn't remake your headline.

4096
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:25,040
Is Uriah Faber Shit talker or not?

4097
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:25,701
I don't think he is.

4098
01:44:25,701 --> 01:44:26,720
I think he's super honest.

4099
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:27,720
He's an old school.

4100
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:28,553
He's an old school guy.

4101
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:31,280
Uriah faber talking
about an upcoming fight.

4102
01:44:31,281 --> 01:44:31,700
He never,

4103
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:32,660
he's an old school guy.

4104
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:33,980
That's not huge drawl anymore.

4105
01:44:33,981 --> 01:44:34,310
Eddie,

4106
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:35,360
he's an old school guy.

4107
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,900
He's from the old [inaudible] right
favors still right up there and there's a

4108
01:44:38,901 --> 01:44:42,080
reason why they had Uriah versus Dominick
Cruz and it wasn't just cause your

4109
01:44:42,081 --> 01:44:43,400
rise been doing really well.

4110
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:46,610
It was also because they know you're Ryan
can sell some fucking hundred percent

4111
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:47,453
California.

4112
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:48,640
Super Nice.

4113
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,050
His name or a superstar
who doesn't talk shit.

4114
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:52,700
That's all I'm saying is
your I have favorites.

4115
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:53,070
Yeah,

4116
01:44:53,070 --> 01:44:54,020
but he's old now.

4117
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:55,580
He's been doing it.

4118
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:56,260
You're out of favor.

4119
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:59,090
And let's define superstar.

4120
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:02,450
Is it a UFC champion paper?

4121
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:03,880
Paper paper.

4122
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,001
Who's been a paper?

4123
01:45:05,001 --> 01:45:06,380
Could you draw besides your riot?

4124
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,180
That's not a world champion in the UFC.

4125
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:09,980
Anderson Silva don't talk shit.

4126
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:10,251
No,

4127
01:45:10,251 --> 01:45:12,950
but everybody who was ever
been a paper view star,

4128
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:16,010
that's never been a world
champion in the UFC.

4129
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:17,320
Is there one McGregor?

4130
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:17,930
No.

4131
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:18,830
Conor McGregor knocked out.

4132
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:19,743
Although he's,

4133
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:22,850
but when he fought in the ideas in the
world champ at one 70 but it doesn't

4134
01:45:22,851 --> 01:45:23,121
matter.

4135
01:45:23,121 --> 01:45:23,901
He's a world champion.

4136
01:45:23,901 --> 01:45:24,980
One 45 he was,

4137
01:45:24,981 --> 01:45:26,240
he had beaten Josie.

4138
01:45:26,241 --> 01:45:26,440
Oh,

4139
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:27,320
there's one of the best,

4140
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:32,830
say one 70 was all but 170170170
that's the waterworld chat the answer.

4141
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,040
But he won the world championship.

4142
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:40,911
It's the wrong answer.

4143
01:45:40,911 --> 01:45:41,920
But here's the co,

4144
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:42,860
doesn't matter Bro.

4145
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:44,300
He won the heavyweight title.

4146
01:45:44,301 --> 01:45:45,770
St currently hasn't been,

4147
01:45:45,771 --> 01:45:46,160
hasn't,

4148
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:46,993
hasn't been.

4149
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:47,930
There's not one.

4150
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:50,780
So you're wife favors the
only guy in consideration.

4151
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:55,730
If you think about a guy who like a
legit star who's never won a UFC title,

4152
01:45:55,731 --> 01:45:56,960
who can sell paper views,

4153
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:59,380
you're Ryan might be the only guy here.

4154
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:00,560
I want to WEC title it.

4155
01:46:00,561 --> 01:46:01,394
Yeah.

4156
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:01,791
Yeah,

4157
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:02,690
but never the UFC.

4158
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:07,750
Nobody in the UFC that like has come along
in these years who's not like a giant

4159
01:46:08,211 --> 01:46:10,840
crazy fight pass fan
has likely seen those.

4160
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:11,990
True.

4161
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:12,823
You know it's,

4162
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:13,870
it's hard because you,

4163
01:46:13,871 --> 01:46:17,630
you don't see those when they
show those a UFC countdown shows,

4164
01:46:17,631 --> 01:46:19,040
you see highlights from him and shit.

4165
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:21,170
But you don't really see w he sees on TV.

4166
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:22,180
True.

4167
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:22,581
Well,

4168
01:46:22,581 --> 01:46:25,460
I mean a lot of dudes do talk shit,

4169
01:46:25,461 --> 01:46:26,220
but it's fighting.

4170
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:27,053
It's natural.

4171
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:28,510
It's a puddle.

4172
01:46:28,510 --> 01:46:29,030
The drawl,

4173
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:29,863
not a wheelchair.

4174
01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:31,010
So Ronnie's a good,

4175
01:46:31,190 --> 01:46:31,820
good call.

4176
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:32,870
He doesn't really talk shit.

4177
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:36,680
He's gotten close a couple
of times this fighting shit.

4178
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:37,370
But you know,

4179
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:40,670
he doesn't get the kind of like numbers
he's actually talking about that.

4180
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:45,440
He did an interview recently where he's
talking about how he'd rather fight Nate

4181
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,010
Diaz,

4182
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:50,040
Nate Diaz rather than Conor because
it doesn't matter to whether

4183
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,980
it's for the world title.

4184
01:46:50,990 --> 01:46:51,180
Nice.

4185
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:52,290
So I gets the same amount of money,

4186
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:53,730
like whether he's fighting,

4187
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,980
he doesn't get paper view because
they're a piece of paper champion.

4188
01:46:55,981 --> 01:46:58,320
Just wants to fight the
best guy and wants a fight.

4189
01:46:58,321 --> 01:46:58,601
Like who?

4190
01:46:58,601 --> 01:47:02,040
A guy who he wants to fight and I guess
he wants to get back at Nate because he

4191
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:03,150
fought day before.

4192
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:03,831
It makes it neat,

4193
01:47:03,831 --> 01:47:05,610
beat him and he doesn't feel
like he fought his best.

4194
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:10,920
That's also why cowboys such a bad
ass because he just wants challenges.

4195
01:47:10,921 --> 01:47:12,520
Like that's what he gravitates towards.

4196
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:13,770
That's why,

4197
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:16,020
I mean he's a small one 70 dude.

4198
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:18,120
Paul Felder looked bigger
than him the other day.

4199
01:47:18,121 --> 01:47:19,320
We were hanging out at the comedy store.

4200
01:47:19,690 --> 01:47:22,380
I like by like a few pounds.

4201
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:23,850
That's true.

4202
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:25,380
Maybe 10 well he was,

4203
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:26,160
it fell.

4204
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:31,160
Felder was not high eighties when we
saw him and Donald was Max Holloway.

4205
01:47:31,441 --> 01:47:34,230
When nine in a row doesn't
talk an ounce of Shit.

4206
01:47:34,231 --> 01:47:34,500
You don't,

4207
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,460
nobody knows who he is.

4208
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:36,330
That's what I'm saying.

4209
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:36,571
Yeah.

4210
01:47:36,571 --> 01:47:38,550
But he also is the bad part to it.

4211
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:40,350
But he also is the UK.

4212
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:40,651
He could,

4213
01:47:40,651 --> 01:47:42,270
he could headline a UK show.

4214
01:47:42,271 --> 01:47:42,451
Right.

4215
01:47:42,451 --> 01:47:43,230
Max Holloway.

4216
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:43,481
Thoughts?

4217
01:47:43,481 --> 01:47:44,314
You Mean Hawaii?

4218
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:44,520
Mother,

4219
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,120
bugger.

4220
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:45,241
Oh,

4221
01:47:45,241 --> 01:47:45,780
is he?

4222
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:46,770
I thought he was from the UK.

4223
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,011
No,

4224
01:47:47,011 --> 01:47:47,680
John Holloway.

4225
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:48,513
Thinking of John Hallway.

4226
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,330
Okay.

4227
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:50,760
Filming give John Hathaway.

4228
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:51,743
John Hathaway.

4229
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:00,440
I made up one of those [inaudible]
fuck and he's won nine in a row.

4230
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:06,950
Give him a fucking total
shock to Max Holloway.

4231
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:09,420
He's so fucking good.

4232
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:10,051
Max Holloway.

4233
01:48:10,051 --> 01:48:14,790
So Ghanaian and they'll fucking row and
beat the WHO's who is Hawaiian accent is

4234
01:48:14,791 --> 01:48:18,560
so fucking pick out there that no,

4235
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:20,390
get the fuck out of here though.

4236
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:22,320
If you pay attention to flags,

4237
01:48:22,321 --> 01:48:25,190
they're confusing because a lot of
people don't realize Hawaii is all fuck

4238
01:48:25,210 --> 01:48:25,590
anymore.

4239
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:28,050
Hawaiian Hawaii comes into the frag flag.

4240
01:48:28,051 --> 01:48:30,800
It looks like a British flag flag,

4241
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:34,940
which in a weird way because like no
one in South Dakota comes in with the

4242
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:39,450
fucking South Dakota flag because that
is one of the promote more proof positive

4243
01:48:39,451 --> 01:48:42,750
things that Hawaii is
like an occupied country.

4244
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:44,670
We have taken over Hawaii and decided,

4245
01:48:44,671 --> 01:48:45,031
you know what,

4246
01:48:45,031 --> 01:48:46,890
you motherfuckers are
just a little too close.

4247
01:48:46,891 --> 01:48:49,950
We would like to control you since
you're in the middle of the ocean.

4248
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:50,910
And you know,

4249
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:51,390
I don't,

4250
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:56,130
it's not a good idea to let an enemy
tribe live here five hours by plane from

4251
01:48:56,131 --> 01:48:57,030
fucking Los Angeles.

4252
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:58,380
So we're just going to own you.

4253
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:00,270
So that's what Hawaii is,

4254
01:49:00,271 --> 01:49:00,511
man.

4255
01:49:00,511 --> 01:49:05,160
That's how I know there's a
lot of Hawaiians that want
Hawaiian independence to

4256
01:49:05,161 --> 01:49:05,730
that.

4257
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:07,560
I would say settle down.

4258
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:08,423
Settle down.

4259
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:13,490
Everyone said Max Holloway will
respect you deeply as your own nation.

4260
01:49:13,861 --> 01:49:14,251
Just wait.

4261
01:49:14,251 --> 01:49:14,431
God,

4262
01:49:14,431 --> 01:49:15,264
the new,

4263
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:18,030
let's just keep this one to you.

4264
01:49:18,031 --> 01:49:19,170
Love yourself from Hawaii.

4265
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:20,160
I Love Hawaii.

4266
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:21,053
I Love Hawaii.

4267
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:22,780
I'm going to go on vacation.

4268
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:24,980
I'm probably going to die.

4269
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:27,420
There it in the sense that
like when I'm an old man,

4270
01:49:27,421 --> 01:49:28,254
I'm going to move there.

4271
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:29,423
I never been there.

4272
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:30,523
I love it.

4273
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:31,380
I love it best.

4274
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:33,130
And you know what tells me,

4275
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:36,510
why don't we all go to tell me that they
go there and the Hawaiians treat them

4276
01:49:36,511 --> 01:49:38,010
bad and that the Hawaiians are racist.

4277
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:39,020
They're all cash back.

4278
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:40,290
I've never had that issue.

4279
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:41,850
They couldn't be any friends.

4280
01:49:41,851 --> 01:49:42,720
I be any nicer.

4281
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:43,290
I went,

4282
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:44,880
they take me in like I'm fucking legal.

4283
01:49:44,881 --> 01:49:46,080
And did you ever heard it's the best?

4284
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:46,740
Um,

4285
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:48,460
I went to for a wedding.

4286
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:49,090
Uh,

4287
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:49,510
um,

4288
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:50,141
we went to,

4289
01:49:50,141 --> 01:49:51,700
me and my wife went to
a wedding out there.

4290
01:49:51,701 --> 01:49:53,620
One of her friends got
married on the big island.

4291
01:49:53,621 --> 01:49:55,810
There was like the Hilo side
and then there's another side,

4292
01:49:56,110 --> 01:49:58,650
there's a Hilo side that
Bj is very popular in.

4293
01:49:58,990 --> 01:50:00,130
And then the other side,

4294
01:50:00,131 --> 01:50:01,510
they're like rivals,

4295
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:02,230
you know,

4296
01:50:02,230 --> 01:50:02,680
they're like,

4297
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:06,670
and we were on the side that
was like rivaling Bj and the,

4298
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:07,060
you know,

4299
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:07,511
we were out there.

4300
01:50:07,511 --> 01:50:08,200
We had the,

4301
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:10,060
I was watching the UFC on,

4302
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:10,661
on,

4303
01:50:10,661 --> 01:50:10,950
uh,

4304
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:15,700
on my phone and during the wedding I
didn't know anybody and everybody that

4305
01:50:15,701 --> 01:50:17,620
lived there was like white
people that move there.

4306
01:50:17,621 --> 01:50:19,510
They all said do not go out at night.

4307
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,990
Do not go out because yeah,

4308
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:25,000
if you go out at night
locally to any of these bars,

4309
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:26,050
you're going to get fucked.

4310
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:26,381
Oh yeah.

4311
01:50:26,381 --> 01:50:27,220
You don't go to a bar.

4312
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:27,431
Well,

4313
01:50:27,431 --> 01:50:29,510
you also know studio city.

4314
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:32,170
Would you go to the bars?

4315
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:33,500
And I did.

4316
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:34,840
I went to the bars and Hawaii.

4317
01:50:34,841 --> 01:50:35,441
They're close.

4318
01:50:35,441 --> 01:50:36,390
Fuck Tall.

4319
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:37,860
How I am,

4320
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:38,703
Bro.

4321
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:43,280
You're a beast inside your ears.

4322
01:50:43,281 --> 01:50:44,114
You've got a

4323
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:46,210
tank top on

4324
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:49,373
point.

4325
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:55,150
The local said don't you don't
want to go certainly bar,

4326
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:59,080
but let me tell you some one thing cause
you get a lot of heat online sometimes.

4327
01:50:59,110 --> 01:50:59,650
I do.

4328
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:00,461
Yeah man.

4329
01:51:00,461 --> 01:51:03,160
Like people think because you
talk a lot of shit on the podcast,

4330
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:06,330
people who understand that this
is like elevated conversation.

4331
01:51:06,350 --> 01:51:08,230
Like in real life you
got along with everybody.

4332
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:10,140
Everyone Brendon here.

4333
01:51:10,210 --> 01:51:14,110
So I mean you're one of those
guys like everybody you meet,

4334
01:51:14,111 --> 01:51:16,060
everyone's hugging
everybody everywhere I go.

4335
01:51:16,061 --> 01:51:16,781
He's also,

4336
01:51:16,781 --> 01:51:19,120
he's also very
compassionate to all people.

4337
01:51:19,121 --> 01:51:19,481
Like he's,

4338
01:51:19,481 --> 01:51:20,021
he's kind of,

4339
01:51:20,021 --> 01:51:20,771
he's a soft,

4340
01:51:20,771 --> 01:51:21,604
he's a soft day.

4341
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:24,040
You just talk mad shit and
you've got to settle down.

4342
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:27,400
I settled down but do you hate,

4343
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:28,680
okay.

4344
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:31,280
[inaudible] Cowboy Donald looks

4345
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,890
ready to take down by Donald.

4346
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:38,130
Good wrestling dude and cat.

4347
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:39,021
Patrick Cote task,

4348
01:51:39,021 --> 01:51:39,940
good Jujitsu man.

4349
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:41,230
He's very sneaky off his back.

4350
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:44,200
Serone has really good Jujitsu Shit,

4351
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:46,010
right submissions.

4352
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:50,140
Ronnie's been top five for 10 years.

4353
01:51:50,141 --> 01:51:50,921
Teen triangles,

4354
01:51:50,921 --> 01:51:51,754
some ridiculous,

4355
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:52,593
ridiculous.

4356
01:51:53,010 --> 01:51:55,030
He shows it's so fucking fast.

4357
01:51:55,031 --> 01:51:55,521
He's probably,

4358
01:51:55,521 --> 01:51:58,000
he probably has more triangles
and anybody in the UFC ever.

4359
01:51:58,390 --> 01:51:58,631
Well,

4360
01:51:58,631 --> 01:51:59,560
if you think about it,

4361
01:51:59,590 --> 01:52:00,910
all the fights in the WEC,

4362
01:52:00,911 --> 01:52:01,300
one of,

4363
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:03,730
one of the things that you
and I talked about a lot eddy,

4364
01:52:03,731 --> 01:52:06,190
that he was a great example of a guy.

4365
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:10,240
Why it's important if you're a
good kicker to have a nasty guard.

4366
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:12,460
Cause he didn't give a
fuck if you took him down.

4367
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:15,790
So he would throw these nasty as
head kicks and if you took him down,

4368
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:16,900
oh shit.

4369
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:20,530
Where that triangle come from until well
and then he talked about when he fought

4370
01:52:20,531 --> 01:52:20,950
Diaz,

4371
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:23,800
he was saying how he was embarrassed
because he's so afraid to go to the ground

4372
01:52:23,801 --> 01:52:24,041
with them.

4373
01:52:24,041 --> 01:52:24,281
I was like,

4374
01:52:24,281 --> 01:52:25,630
what the Fuck's wrong with you?

4375
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,640
You're believing his Jitsu man.

4376
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:29,550
What the fuck is he?

4377
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:32,020
His digits is pretty fucking high level.

4378
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:33,850
It is and I'm telling him how boys,

4379
01:52:33,851 --> 01:52:35,700
it's fucking good man buddy.

4380
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:36,050
Anyway,

4381
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:38,590
should be worried but you shouldn't knock.

4382
01:52:38,591 --> 01:52:39,424
Go down.

4383
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,020
Here's the deal.

4384
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:43,780
A guy like DHEAS could tap cowboy.

4385
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:45,980
He's one of the few guys
that get tab cargo and I'm

4386
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:46,813
not saying that

4387
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,600
stove a very glued posey

4388
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:55,220
is cowboy so bad.

4389
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:01,780
We're just standing there
token in a scramble.

4390
01:53:01,781 --> 01:53:02,720
Fuck you ain't did.

4391
01:53:02,721 --> 01:53:04,610
That's the perfect scrambled
tomboy just came up.

4392
01:53:05,470 --> 01:53:10,360
It's a beautiful sweet or you stand
up and you or you get to soc controls,

4393
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:11,410
beautiful works out.

4394
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:12,890
It's going to have a speed advantage.

4395
01:53:12,891 --> 01:53:17,420
But the power scares cowboy shines
is with his fucking leg kicks,

4396
01:53:17,421 --> 01:53:17,781
man.

4397
01:53:17,781 --> 01:53:20,720
Hell he where he ate up Eddie Alvarez
and that's where he started to turn the

4398
01:53:20,721 --> 01:53:21,351
tide on.

4399
01:53:21,351 --> 01:53:22,184
Nate Diaz.

4400
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:24,890
He started tacking that
heavy fucking fucked up.

4401
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:29,560
He started fucking up that front
foot cowboy has nasty leg kicks mass.

4402
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:30,340
Just the power of,

4403
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:32,390
and it scares the fuck
out of me with Donald.

4404
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:34,100
Oh God.

4405
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:35,630
Cowboy with the tape out.

4406
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:39,620
What's killing the power
of Coty because when,

4407
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:41,150
when Donald gets comfortable,

4408
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:43,160
he stands upright and it
doesn't move his head.

4409
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:43,770
You got to worry about,

4410
01:53:43,770 --> 01:53:46,370
everybody's got to worry about
Cota expected take downs.

4411
01:53:46,371 --> 01:53:47,740
And I think he,

4412
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:49,430
that was the last thing on his mind.

4413
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,670
I'm telling very prepared
cause it comes prepared.

4414
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:53,930
Tony Cowboy for three,

4415
01:53:53,931 --> 01:53:58,350
four years moved basically the Denver
for six months and just train with or

4416
01:53:58,360 --> 01:53:59,950
bowling or arm wrestling nonstop.

4417
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:00,440
Russell,

4418
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:01,730
every single good there,

4419
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:02,001
man.

4420
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:02,740
I'm telling you.

4421
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:04,190
I'm telling you can fucking wrestle.

4422
01:54:04,390 --> 01:54:06,480
Damn his Jujitsu,

4423
01:54:06,481 --> 01:54:07,430
it leaves no space.

4424
01:54:07,431 --> 01:54:09,480
He's got a real tight by God.

4425
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:11,650
He doesn't get dangerous Jujitsu.

4426
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:11,811
Yeah,

4427
01:54:11,811 --> 01:54:12,230
you very,

4428
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:12,651
very much.

4429
01:54:12,651 --> 01:54:13,220
It's so,

4430
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:14,540
it's so explosive.

4431
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:15,500
It's hard to train for him.

4432
01:54:15,501 --> 01:54:17,710
That dam and rustling helps your Jujitsu,

4433
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,810
so goddamn hundred percent Dan,

4434
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:21,693
you know this,

4435
01:54:22,150 --> 01:54:22,870
the wrestling rooms,

4436
01:54:22,870 --> 01:54:24,020
it's about the base,

4437
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:24,981
the stability,

4438
01:54:24,981 --> 01:54:25,940
the balance,

4439
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:28,100
all that shit into your Jujitsu.

4440
01:54:28,101 --> 01:54:29,660
Just they just got so much.

4441
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:30,390
Brendan,

4442
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:31,400
would you train with Donald?

4443
01:54:31,401 --> 01:54:33,080
Does he just pick up things very quickly?

4444
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:33,943
Is that what

4445
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:35,873
he trains?

4446
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:39,733
He like,

4447
01:54:40,630 --> 01:54:42,620
he's literally all he does.

4448
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:43,481
Just trap you.

4449
01:54:43,481 --> 01:54:44,780
Just trains all fucking time.

4450
01:54:44,781 --> 01:54:46,430
That jump off boats and cows and shit.

4451
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:47,181
Dude,

4452
01:54:47,181 --> 01:54:50,090
he's going to call God Donald's Rhoda.

4453
01:54:50,091 --> 01:54:51,170
You bad motherfucker.

4454
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:52,220
God Damn,

4455
01:54:52,221 --> 01:54:53,054
he's a back massage.

4456
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:58,160
I can throw my underwear and he's got the
fucking body triangle locked down that

4457
01:54:58,161 --> 01:54:58,731
body triangle,

4458
01:54:58,731 --> 01:55:02,870
so God damn long to controls
your kids yourself and good,

4459
01:55:02,871 --> 01:55:03,980
good under hook by the way.

4460
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:04,371
He looks.

4461
01:55:04,371 --> 01:55:06,950
He looks pretty much as
big as coke to actually no,

4462
01:55:06,951 --> 01:55:07,370
he does.

4463
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:08,203
All right.

4464
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:09,000
Talk to you.

4465
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,200
It's more shredded than is pretty safe
unless you've got something funny to say.

4466
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:13,133
He's pretty good.

4467
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,300
He's also was also caught shit.

4468
01:55:16,330 --> 01:55:18,130
He's taking a shit saving.

4469
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:20,220
Ah Nah.

4470
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:23,390
He's not a Kielbasa.

4471
01:55:23,391 --> 01:55:24,250
He's not bossy.

4472
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:26,420
10 he's not whole coke and hot dog skin.

4473
01:55:26,450 --> 01:55:28,030
You see like a roasted?

4474
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:29,440
Yeah,

4475
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:30,273
he's like abroad.

4476
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:31,280
He's relaxed.

4477
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:32,960
He's got his back just like a thick,

4478
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:34,160
I'm going to shut up.

4479
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:35,253
Fucking brought.

4480
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:35,690
Come on up.

4481
01:55:35,690 --> 01:55:36,310
Come on.

4482
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:37,250
Broths in the summer.

4483
01:55:37,251 --> 01:55:37,881
Kind of get up.

4484
01:55:37,881 --> 01:55:38,714
You Man.

4485
01:55:39,430 --> 01:55:40,263
Looking for it again.

4486
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:41,720
It's special peppers and onions.

4487
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:43,530
I'm so fucking hungry now.

4488
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,513
Me Too.

4489
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:45,563
Let's go get it.

4490
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:48,390
I was eating cheese and
pickles in the back room.

4491
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:49,291
That's not good enough.

4492
01:55:49,291 --> 01:55:50,160
I mean I need meat.

4493
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:50,580
Me Too.

4494
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:51,413
I need,

4495
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:53,860
I'm sure we got some buffalo.

4496
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:55,553
Oh really?

4497
01:56:00,890 --> 01:56:02,470
Stand up Dan.

4498
01:56:02,490 --> 01:56:03,400
Patrick coattails.

4499
01:56:03,430 --> 01:56:04,650
So game man.

4500
01:56:04,651 --> 01:56:06,060
He's so God damn game.

4501
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:13,020
God Eddie in inside that shell hole.

4502
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:13,873
I don't know

4503
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:19,980
why he's kicking the fuck out of
homeboy from San Diego on the ground.

4504
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:21,163
You know what I'm talking about?

4505
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:22,590
No,

4506
01:56:22,590 --> 01:56:23,320
no,

4507
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:24,153
no.

4508
01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:25,040
What the fuck?

4509
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:25,561
That kid's name?

4510
01:56:25,561 --> 01:56:28,380
Black belt from Syria Jujitsu.

4511
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:32,800
He said,

4512
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:32,930
yeah,

4513
01:56:32,930 --> 01:56:33,570
I know it's weird.

4514
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:33,721
It's,

4515
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:34,471
we sent Jerry,

4516
01:56:34,471 --> 01:56:35,304
I'm not doing anymore.

4517
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:39,030
He'd sent Jerry [inaudible] media.

4518
01:56:39,031 --> 01:56:39,864
I'm just trying to bait

4519
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:45,360
everything we say because some
God damn fake news title story.

4520
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:47,433
Can they do.

4521
01:56:48,830 --> 01:56:49,501
I understand.

4522
01:56:49,501 --> 01:56:50,330
I'm not hating though.

4523
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:53,220
I'm friends with a lot of
them are really good guys.

4524
01:56:53,221 --> 01:56:54,210
There's a lot of them that are good.

4525
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:55,290
Got Them Suck Dick.

4526
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:56,280
A lot of them are pretty cool.

4527
01:56:56,510 --> 01:56:59,160
But you know when I feel
like I really do feel like,

4528
01:56:59,161 --> 01:57:00,270
but I really do feel like this,

4529
01:57:00,510 --> 01:57:01,290
a lot of the,

4530
01:57:01,290 --> 01:57:06,070
the animosity between MMA
media and you and I and,

4531
01:57:06,071 --> 01:57:10,620
and a lot of other people would probably
be solved if we were actually talking,

4532
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:15,300
cause we would probably have a
conversation that wasn't as one side of is

4533
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,280
someone writing something
shitty about you,

4534
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:18,990
you responding in a shitty way.

4535
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:22,290
Someone writes something to you on Twitter
or they was baseless communication.

4536
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:23,151
It's face.

4537
01:57:23,151 --> 01:57:23,984
That's right.

4538
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:26,610
Well it's also like you're
not reading people's faces.

4539
01:57:26,611 --> 01:57:28,620
And so an issue with writing something,

4540
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:28,851
right?

4541
01:57:28,851 --> 01:57:31,470
Cause you write something about
someone's opinion and there's a lot of

4542
01:57:31,471 --> 01:57:32,220
assumptions.

4543
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:33,240
There's a lot of you,

4544
01:57:33,370 --> 01:57:33,661
you,

4545
01:57:33,661 --> 01:57:35,040
you're not communicating with them.

4546
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:37,080
But like if you and I have
a dispute about something,

4547
01:57:37,081 --> 01:57:37,231
we,

4548
01:57:37,231 --> 01:57:37,711
oh we've,

4549
01:57:37,711 --> 01:57:39,000
we've had arguments before,

4550
01:57:39,001 --> 01:57:42,540
but we are always resolved them cause
we're both reasonable and we're friends

4551
01:57:42,541 --> 01:57:43,950
and we'd talk and we'd be friendly.

4552
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:47,790
But if you just wrote a blog about me
and I responded with a blog about you

4553
01:57:47,791 --> 01:57:48,090
here,

4554
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:49,680
we know each other forever and I love you,

4555
01:57:49,681 --> 01:57:50,700
but we'd probably be managed.

4556
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:55,860
But the issue becomes if

4557
01:57:58,170 --> 01:57:59,003
Serrano,

4558
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:00,240
he's not playing around,

4559
01:58:00,241 --> 01:58:01,074
he's not here and fun.

4560
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:02,000
Oh,

4561
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:02,700
he's not hearing it.

4562
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:03,840
Who he's ever about defense.

4563
01:58:03,841 --> 01:58:04,081
Nice.

4564
01:58:04,081 --> 01:58:06,360
Kick to the bigger than he normally does.

4565
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:07,890
He was very good with the articles.

4566
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:08,700
The thing is,

4567
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:11,010
what gets clicks is
negativity or headlights.

4568
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,020
He is point,

4569
01:58:16,021 --> 01:58:16,854
right?

4570
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:18,750
But it's not,

4571
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:21,000
I understand in some ways,

4572
01:58:21,001 --> 01:58:22,350
but because it's their job,

4573
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:27,440
but I feel like it does as much damage
to them as it does to the person they're

4574
01:58:27,661 --> 01:58:28,500
misrepresenting.

4575
01:58:28,710 --> 01:58:31,470
So if they write a story
about you and they just,

4576
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:32,071
Oh my God,

4577
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:37,071
those kicks are o and p Co Tej has
to come back with one of his own man.

4578
01:58:38,011 --> 01:58:38,790
That's him.

4579
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:39,361
You know he's,

4580
01:58:39,361 --> 01:58:41,950
he's a fucking game dues super game.

4581
01:58:42,210 --> 01:58:43,043
He

4582
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:45,760
said Donald loves his size.

4583
01:58:45,761 --> 01:58:46,660
We shut the fuck.

4584
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:47,660
I know I changed my mind.

4585
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:51,580
It's the angle of fucking camera.

4586
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:53,020
He can put her on these cameras.

4587
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:55,510
Hey takes also a piece of an analyst too.

4588
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:56,373
He does a lot of work.

4589
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:58,230
Just be careful of Michael J.

4590
01:58:58,230 --> 01:58:58,240
White.

4591
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,250
That's all I ask from you.

4592
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:04,140
You hey man drinks and I
respect him because a spa,

4593
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:07,100
you've got a spear respect
and for a sidekick roundhouse,

4594
01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:08,950
you know who needs some fucking props?

4595
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:11,770
Who is an awesome analyst for Eve Edwards?

4596
01:59:11,771 --> 01:59:12,371
God Damn,

4597
01:59:12,371 --> 01:59:13,204
he's good.

4598
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:14,433
I think Tyra.

4599
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:15,340
I Love E.

4600
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:15,341
Dot.

4601
01:59:15,341 --> 01:59:16,174
Very good.

4602
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:17,690
They're both good.

4603
01:59:17,690 --> 01:59:19,090
Lee Weekly's kill the game.

4604
01:59:19,170 --> 01:59:20,500
He could be good as well.

4605
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:20,771
No,

4606
01:59:20,771 --> 01:59:21,810
I have to know.

4607
01:59:21,820 --> 01:59:26,580
Agree with me and bring up another black
guy cause I have my black black duck.

4608
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:29,833
You guys,

4609
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:32,080
you guys a little respect
for Donald Right now.

4610
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:32,541
Oh,

4611
01:59:32,541 --> 01:59:33,070
I pick up,

4612
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:37,410
I go count that power scares
me with Donald Donald.

4613
01:59:37,411 --> 01:59:38,290
A Jab Tom.

4614
01:59:38,291 --> 01:59:41,950
I like Donald Better at one 70 because
he doesn't have to fucking dry himself

4615
01:59:41,951 --> 01:59:42,460
out.

4616
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:42,940
He looks,

4617
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:43,810
he does it great.

4618
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:45,613
Great.

4619
01:59:45,790 --> 01:59:47,170
And he also has a speed advantage,

4620
01:59:47,171 --> 01:59:47,651
like a sham.

4621
01:59:47,651 --> 01:59:48,484
Whoa.

4622
01:59:48,850 --> 01:59:49,840
You mentioned dogs.

4623
01:59:49,841 --> 01:59:51,430
Roni verse Robbie Lawler.

4624
01:59:51,610 --> 01:59:52,080
Fuck.

4625
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,110
Oh boy.

4626
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:53,950
Okay,

4627
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:54,783
let's not get crazy.

4628
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:56,760
What do you mean knock your crazy?

4629
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:57,760

01:59:58,990 --> 01:59:59,920
Nasty Jab.

4632
01:59:59,950 --> 02:00:00,783
Oh,

4633
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:02,590
I wouldn't mind another
take down for Donald.

4634
02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:04,930
I mean Donald and he's
taking it by not get crazy.

4635
02:00:04,931 --> 02:00:05,950
It's like you would have to like,

4636
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:08,730
he would have copied a bunch of
guys before that could happen.

4637
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:09,573
Hey,

4638
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:13,433

4639
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:14,333
Seventies

4640
02:00:17,150 --> 02:00:19,690
Jad it's almost crazy
talking about somebody else.

4641
02:00:19,691 --> 02:00:22,610
Finding Robbie when
Robbie is about to fight.

4642
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:23,010
Nah,

4643
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:24,190
that's the way the world works.

4644
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:25,360
That's our sport.

4645
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:27,250
100% I'm talking shit.

4646
02:00:27,730 --> 02:00:28,640
Oh Donald.

4647
02:00:30,430 --> 02:00:31,690
Because Donald's such a big name.

4648
02:00:31,691 --> 02:00:33,850
I could see him jump into number three.

4649
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:36,130
We get Patrick Cote timber
trying so fucking Tony,

4650
02:00:36,131 --> 02:00:36,964
Josh Shit.

4651
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:37,751
Oh,

4652
02:00:37,751 --> 02:00:38,800
now we're doing jumping shit.

4653
02:00:38,830 --> 02:00:39,663
Oh.

4654
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,160
Oh.

4655
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:46,753
He's on point.

4656
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:47,750
He's doing a quick going,

4657
02:00:47,790 --> 02:00:48,440
a big bully.

4658
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:49,021
Kids coming in.

Still dangerous.

4661
02:00:52,811 --> 02:00:53,950
He has so much power.

4662
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:54,701
It's so dangerous.

4663
02:00:54,701 --> 02:00:56,170
Keep it down over there Brendan.

4664
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:59,430
You keep it down to thing about
Kowtow to fight the weight coach.

02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:18,543

4673
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:23,201

don't get a brawling match.

4675
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,180
Don't do that.

4676
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:26,040
Shoot in La.

4677
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:28,340
That jabs smooth though.

4678
02:01:31,110 --> 02:01:32,680
Donald has a ride.

4679
02:01:32,681 --> 02:01:33,221
Excuse me.

4680
02:01:33,221 --> 02:01:33,810
I'll just go ahead.

4681
02:01:33,810 --> 02:01:35,140
Copper 3000 please.

4682
02:01:35,141 --> 02:01:37,640
Head kick for 3000 now that heart coats,

4683
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:37,960

4687
02:01:41,380 --> 02:01:42,213
let's let this play out.

4688
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:43,471
I'll step away.

4689
02:01:43,471 --> 02:01:44,181
If you try that.

4690
02:01:44,181 --> 02:01:45,200
I'm fucking stepping away.

4691
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:47,240
I'll take a kick for 3000 please.

4692
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:49,240
All right,

4693
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:50,630
crazy.

4694
02:01:50,630 --> 02:01:52,220
I'm looking for that step and knee.

4695
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:53,960
I can't wait for this head kick.

4696
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:58,970
I like how Donald defends
would that left knee.

4697
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:03,010
He does a real good job of catching
guys as they come in cause he throws all

4698
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:04,810
that fractures and use on Jim Miller.

4699
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:09,230
So good and throws that that need of the
body very sparing just keeps coming in

02:02:09,231 --> 02:02:09,771
for effect.

02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:18,890
Tough coatings like bring it on.

4707
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:22,130
These Canadians are built
from different stuff.

4708
02:02:22,190 --> 02:02:23,080
Don't get me wrong.

4709
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:23,983
Match Cowboy.

4710
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:26,900

4713
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:29,750

02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:30,813

4715
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:34,640
He's going to say day left.

4716
02:02:34,641 --> 02:02:35,001
Switch,

4717
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:36,440

4718
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:40,040
I can't say I want to say
something while everybody leaves.

4719
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:40,430
Okay,

4720
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:40,740

4724

This is fun.

4725
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:49,190
You understand he's the best player is
broadcasting during the fire and the kid

4726
02:02:49,191 --> 02:02:50,120
when he's doing this show.

4727
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:51,230
It's fun folks.

4728
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:51,651
Of course.

4729
02:02:51,651 --> 02:02:52,390
It's fun.

4730
02:02:52,390 --> 02:02:52,620
Dang.

4731
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:54,500
I know there's a lot of nerds
out there that are freaking out.

4732
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:55,363
They're angry,

4733
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:55,780
man.

4734
02:02:55,780 --> 02:02:56,490
He's the best.

4735
02:02:56,490 --> 02:02:56,760
Boom,

4736
02:02:56,760 --> 02:02:57,593
boom,

4737
02:02:57,930 --> 02:02:58,763
boom.

4738
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:00,110
I'll tell you the defense.

4739
02:03:00,111 --> 02:03:01,490
Bernard's please Brenton shop.

4740
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:02,480
He's a very nice guy.

4741
02:03:02,481 --> 02:03:02,751
If you,

4742
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:03,221
if you were,

4743
02:03:03,221 --> 02:03:03,540
if,

4744
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:05,210
if you're a nerd and
you're getting picked on,

4745
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:07,160
Brenda's job is going to
punch the guy in the face.

4746
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:08,180
He's not fighting anymore,

4747
02:03:08,181 --> 02:03:08,870
folks.

4748
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:09,800
Just trying to make some hype.

4749
02:03:10,170 --> 02:03:10,950
Zoe does it.

4750
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:11,700
That's okay.

4751
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:12,533
Just relax.

4752
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:13,970
Everybody realizes a special guy,

4753
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:17,030
everybody relaxed and
enjoy coattail versus Roni.

4754
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:19,160
You're allowed to disagree and agree.

4755
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:20,023
It's all good.

4756
02:03:20,210 --> 02:03:21,043
It's all good.

4757
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:23,210
But I guarantee you if
you met him in real life,

4758
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:24,850
you'd go music.

4759
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:25,993
Yes.

4760
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:28,160
And if you see him on stage
of Brian cow and you're like,

4761
02:03:28,161 --> 02:03:28,400
hey,

4762
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:28,521
look,

4763
02:03:28,521 --> 02:03:29,930
so know a little nervous up there.

4764
02:03:30,010 --> 02:03:30,180
Yeah,

4765
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:30,710
of course.

4766
02:03:30,710 --> 02:03:31,251
He's nervous.

4767
02:03:31,251 --> 02:03:32,590
Never fucking done this before.

4768
02:03:32,810 --> 02:03:34,130
Do you understand a weird it is.

4769
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,840
These guys are feeling a thousand people.

4770
02:03:35,841 --> 02:03:39,710
The Wilbur Theater in Boston sold
out show and I got the report.

4771
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:44,240
I you guys sold out the
Wilbur is crazy for a podcast.

4772
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:45,103
Crazy.

4773
02:03:45,170 --> 02:03:46,220
I don't even know what to say about it.

4774
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:47,690
It's just amazing.

4775
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,350
It's fun.

4776
02:03:48,350 --> 02:03:50,120
I mean a lot to me and Brennan shop,

4777
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:50,961
my whole life changes.

4778
02:03:50,961 --> 02:03:51,950
I've been in the business forever.

4779
02:03:51,951 --> 02:03:52,820
I'm so happy.

4780
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:53,451
Well,

4781
02:03:53,451 --> 02:03:53,751
you know,

4782
02:03:53,751 --> 02:03:56,360
you were the one that
told me to do a podcast.

4783
02:03:56,840 --> 02:04:00,350
I'm so happy and it's been amazing
what I miss when we're talking about

4784
02:04:00,351 --> 02:04:01,880
crocodiles just talking about you guys.

4785
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:02,833
You guys have.

4786
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:05,150
Oh my God.

4787
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:09,360
He just wants to track just round one
this round there and shut the fuck up.

4788
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:10,583
Just started.

4789
02:04:10,830 --> 02:04:11,750
I know Brian,

4790
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:14,390

4791
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:16,473
Fuck.

4792
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:17,390
I'm not going to cocky.

4793
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:19,340
Oh,

4794
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:19,940
look at this.

4795
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:20,773
He'll get out.

4796
02:04:21,410 --> 02:04:22,370
He just gets out.

4797
02:04:22,371 --> 02:04:22,901
Get Out.

4798
02:04:22,901 --> 02:04:24,740
I just want to point out in my house,

4799
02:04:24,741 --> 02:04:25,574
I do all the cooking,

4800
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:26,800
so just it's just job.

4801
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:27,170
Boy,

4802
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:28,070
this is crazy.

4803
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:29,000
Look at this.

4804
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:29,833
Look at this.

4805
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:31,780
What's a healthy glass?

4806
02:04:32,570 --> 02:04:33,550
You're obviously not gender.

4807
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:34,473
They go,

4808
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:35,490
oh,

4809
02:04:35,490 --> 02:04:35,850
should I look?

4810
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:36,683
It is true.

4811
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:37,800
I don't know what I'm saying.

4812
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:38,491
I got sharp guys,

4813
02:04:38,491 --> 02:04:39,470
doll smell driving for me.

4814
02:04:39,471 --> 02:04:41,280
I'm going to keep forgetting
your brothers behind me.

4815
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:41,791
I love him.

4816
02:04:41,791 --> 02:04:43,050
Bet your sweet as he is.

4817
02:04:43,130 --> 02:04:43,530
All right.

4818
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:45,090
This side is very exciting man.

4819
02:04:45,091 --> 02:04:45,600
Come on down.

4820
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:47,520
I like how Donald Switches stances too.

4821
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:49,170
There are men and there's Donald's,

4822
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:52,620
Donald's Serone switches stances
and it's not because he's injured.

4823
02:04:52,621 --> 02:04:52,981
He's just,

4824
02:04:52,981 --> 02:04:55,840
because he's got so many
variables in is a task.

4825
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:58,520
Look at this kid can do all
kinds of shit as attack.

4826
02:04:58,590 --> 02:05:00,020
He's a bass drum,

4827
02:05:00,030 --> 02:05:00,690
head hunting.

4828
02:05:00,690 --> 02:05:01,410
I know what you're saying.

4829
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:01,561
No,

4830
02:05:01,561 --> 02:05:02,311
you're definitely right.

4831
02:05:02,311 --> 02:05:07,311
And it's interesting seeing him do that
at 70 I think this is a good example of

4832
02:05:07,351 --> 02:05:08,184
a guy.

4833
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:08,821
First of all,

4834
02:05:08,821 --> 02:05:10,530
let's bring up Patrick Otay fought Tito,

4835
02:05:10,531 --> 02:05:15,100
would tease at two oh five and his UFC
light heavyweight yen dropped him and

4836
02:05:15,110 --> 02:05:18,660
dropped an all time great
light heavyweight in Chemo rts.

4837
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:19,410
So,

4838
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:20,340
oh my God.

4839
02:05:20,341 --> 02:05:24,690
Donald Donald's Serone looks this is an
argument for the point of diminishing

4840
02:05:24,691 --> 02:05:26,220
returns and weight cutting.

4841
02:05:26,221 --> 02:05:26,360
Yep.

4842
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:26,880
Correct.

4843
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:27,713
Yep.

4844
02:05:27,730 --> 02:05:28,640
Donald looks fun.

4845
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:30,320
We'll also drop them twice.

4846
02:05:30,330 --> 02:05:32,700
Argument for Donald's Raleigh
being a bad mother fucker,

4847
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:35,250
but we already knew that
that was bad at anyway.

4848
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:37,320
I think he's at home.

4849
02:05:37,650 --> 02:05:38,560
He's both from the looks.

4850
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:39,390
Exactly.

4851
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:40,220
Exactly.

4852
02:05:40,220 --> 02:05:40,481
Thanks.

4853
02:05:40,481 --> 02:05:44,370
Asked cardio can take a shot and yeah,

4854
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:46,140
just get run healthy man.

4855
02:05:46,141 --> 02:05:46,974
He's healthy.

4856
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:50,430
He was one 76 when I was talking to him.

4857
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:50,661
He's saying,

4858
02:05:50,661 --> 02:05:52,020
I'm the only six pound weight cut.

4859
02:05:52,021 --> 02:05:52,171
It was.

4860
02:05:52,171 --> 02:05:53,790
I'm not telling you that's the move.

4861
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:55,020
That's really the move.

4862
02:05:55,050 --> 02:05:55,883
It really hurts them.

4863
02:05:55,990 --> 02:05:57,720
Connor can't make 45 anymore.

4864
02:05:57,750 --> 02:05:58,990
It's going to tell for goods,

4865
02:05:58,991 --> 02:05:59,731
so let it go,

4866
02:05:59,731 --> 02:06:00,001
man.

4867
02:06:00,001 --> 02:06:00,691
He's a superstar.

4868
02:06:00,691 --> 02:06:02,720
He doesn't need a fucking fight.

4869
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:04,530
Dos Anjos at 55 sons,

4870
02:06:04,860 --> 02:06:05,590
he wins,

4871
02:06:05,590 --> 02:06:07,020
maybe loses everybody makes money.

4872
02:06:07,021 --> 02:06:07,980
He gives a fuck.

4873
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:10,060
Oh my

4874
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:18,160
[inaudible]

4875
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:21,113
your

4876
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:24,720
I'm texting him right now.

4877
02:06:24,721 --> 02:06:25,960
I'm saying there are men in there done.

4878
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:26,853
There's Thomas Rauner.

4879
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:28,230
That's the kind of beaten down though.

4880
02:06:28,231 --> 02:06:29,830
You have [inaudible]
that's the kind of sounds.

4881
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:30,570
My boyfriend,

4882
02:06:30,570 --> 02:06:33,620
I don't think anybody's ever beat
down your coattail like damn,

4883
02:06:33,621 --> 02:06:34,390
he's a bad mother.

4884
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:35,040
Think everybody's at.

4885
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:38,010
Anybody's ever beat down Patrick
Hotel like that petro quota is lost.

4886
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:39,480
He broke his hand versus Donald,

4887
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:39,690
uh,

4888
02:06:39,690 --> 02:06:43,260
Alan Belcher and Alan Belcher caught
them in a rear naked Anderson Silva.

4889
02:06:43,261 --> 02:06:44,340
He blew his knee out.

4890
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:46,160
Who the fuck has ever beaten him down?

4891
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:47,880
He dropped them three times.

4892
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:49,440
Who has ever beaten him down like that?

4893
02:06:49,650 --> 02:06:50,490
How about nobody?

4894
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:51,030
No one,

4895
02:06:51,030 --> 02:06:51,451
no one.

4896
02:06:51,451 --> 02:06:54,330
And he's coming in on us when
stress and he's coming in.

4897
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:55,620
Fantastic.

4898
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:56,610
Jesus Christ.

4899
02:06:56,611 --> 02:06:57,780
He has a granite chin.

4900
02:06:57,781 --> 02:06:59,010
He's known for his chin,

4901
02:06:59,040 --> 02:06:59,873
known for his chin.

4902
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:01,460
Got Damn Donald's running.

4903
02:07:01,461 --> 02:07:01,950
Look good.

4904
02:07:01,950 --> 02:07:02,371
God.

4905
02:07:02,371 --> 02:07:03,204
He's a bad man.

4906
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:04,650
Look at that left hook.

4907
02:07:04,651 --> 02:07:08,130
Left Hook was landing in the
pocket and not taking any shots.

4908
02:07:08,810 --> 02:07:10,830
What hard punches did
he take in this fight?

4909
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:11,730
He's just too quick.

4910
02:07:12,630 --> 02:07:13,610
Too quick for these candidates.

4911
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:16,800
Not just two quick fucking healthy bro.

4912
02:07:16,830 --> 02:07:17,690
He's fucking hell.

4913
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:20,040
I am going to be that fucking form guy.

4914
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:22,840
Can you imagine Donald versus
Wonderboy and Donald's?

4915
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:24,120
Donald's our friends.

4916
02:07:24,121 --> 02:07:24,954
So it's fucking

4917
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:29,070
jacking off to him.

4918
02:07:29,071 --> 02:07:31,560
Brian has sent him the way you yet there.

4919
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:32,750
It's probably not in your best interest.

4920
02:07:33,820 --> 02:07:35,470
I just like no did.

4921
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:36,393
It's like one of the,

4922
02:07:36,570 --> 02:07:38,500
what's that guy that Howard
Dean's like the Howard Dean?

4923
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:39,373
Yeah.

4924
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:46,023
What did I do?

4925
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:52,390
One drink.

4926
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:54,220
Too many mistakes.

4927
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:02,110
It sounds like he's watching
somebody fucking going.

4928
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:03,450
Yeah.

4929
02:08:03,510 --> 02:08:03,790
No,

4930
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:07,360
it's like he's got an audition and he's
never had an audition before and they go

4931
02:08:07,361 --> 02:08:08,194
action and he goes,

4932
02:08:08,260 --> 02:08:09,093
yeah.

4933
02:08:10,510 --> 02:08:12,730
And then the guy goes a great stuff.

4934
02:08:12,731 --> 02:08:13,564
Brendan,

4935
02:08:13,930 --> 02:08:15,130
you've got your info.

4936
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:16,870
Oh by the way,

4937
02:08:16,871 --> 02:08:18,100
that's not Johnny Depp.

4938
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:24,020
You thought that was Johnny Depp me.

4939
02:08:24,021 --> 02:08:24,680
But the other guy,

4940
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:25,513
snoop Dogg,

4941
02:08:25,540 --> 02:08:27,580
I was barely paid attention for sure.

4942
02:08:27,581 --> 02:08:28,450
Some high as fuck

4943
02:08:30,470 --> 02:08:31,450
Jon Jones.

4944
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:35,840
Speaking of high as fuck John
Fucking Jones was pulled up better.

4945
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:36,250
Well,

4946
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:37,780
here's the thing for the main event,

4947
02:08:37,781 --> 02:08:38,031
Joe,

4948
02:08:38,031 --> 02:08:38,864
for the main event,

4949
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:40,180
here's a out of respect.

4950
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:41,410
Here's the thing about this.

4951
02:08:41,411 --> 02:08:41,770
Um,

4952
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:43,360
this UFC 200 things,

4953
02:08:43,420 --> 02:08:44,740
the mock lesson or thing,

4954
02:08:45,310 --> 02:08:45,581
you know,

4955
02:08:45,581 --> 02:08:46,061
this is the thing,

4956
02:08:46,061 --> 02:08:48,790
because MMA media loves to
write stories about this stuff.

4957
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:50,560
I'm a fan of aerial.

4958
02:08:50,561 --> 02:08:51,131
Hawaii's,

4959
02:08:51,131 --> 02:08:53,170
I'd like Ariel Helwani when
I was telling him that,

4960
02:08:53,230 --> 02:08:55,270
what was told to me about the UFC,

4961
02:08:55,271 --> 02:08:56,104
about the leak,

4962
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:57,003
I don't,

4963
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:58,090
I don't like,

4964
02:08:58,390 --> 02:09:00,280
I don't not like Ariel Helwani.

4965
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:01,780
He's always been a nice guy to me.

4966
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:02,943
I liked him.

4967
02:09:03,190 --> 02:09:05,680
I was just simply stating what I was told,

4968
02:09:06,150 --> 02:09:06,880
you know,

4969
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:07,091
I mean,

4970
02:09:07,091 --> 02:09:07,690
I don't,

4971
02:09:07,690 --> 02:09:10,060
I don't give a fuck
about these big promos.

4972
02:09:10,061 --> 02:09:13,540
You know what I care that Brock
Lesnar is gonna Fight Mark Hunt.

4973
02:09:13,690 --> 02:09:15,040
I don't care if I heard it from my mom.

4974
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:16,570
My mom called me up,

4975
02:09:16,630 --> 02:09:17,860
but I worked for the UFC.

4976
02:09:17,861 --> 02:09:21,970
I didn't find out until I was sitting
there doing commentary and I didn't give a

4977
02:09:21,971 --> 02:09:22,360
shit.

4978
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:26,110
If I had found out because of Ariel
Helwani story instead of the UFC,

4979
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:28,000
I wouldn't have given a fuck.

4980
02:09:28,001 --> 02:09:30,610
It wouldn't have been
any less valuable to me.

4981
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:32,780
Can I ask you something as a,

4982
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:34,630
as a guy who's on the inside,

4983
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:39,870
why would Brock Lesnar take a guy
like Mark Hunt on his first fight?

4984
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:40,750
I'll think get a choice.

4985
02:09:40,750 --> 02:09:41,830
Doesn't make any sense.

4986
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:43,373
Choice.

4987
02:09:43,450 --> 02:09:44,283
That's a good question.

4988
02:09:44,570 --> 02:09:48,730
In some going to give them Josh Barnett
won the fight and you'd fucking wrap

4989
02:09:48,731 --> 02:09:49,510
them into could,

4990
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:50,770
it could be that,

4991
02:09:51,010 --> 02:09:52,060
well Jesus Christ,

4992
02:09:52,061 --> 02:09:52,300
I would,

4993
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:57,300
I would almost like to see Josh
Barnett more pro wrestling that barn.

4994
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:59,260
It wanted to fight,

4995
02:09:59,261 --> 02:10:00,160
promoted for the fight.

4996
02:10:00,161 --> 02:10:00,890
Did he give it to it?

4997
02:10:00,890 --> 02:10:01,960
Is the many of reasons.

4998
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:02,410
Ah,

4999
02:10:02,410 --> 02:10:02,771
man,

5000
02:10:02,771 --> 02:10:03,550
I don't know man.

5001
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:04,090
I would,

5002
02:10:04,090 --> 02:10:05,740
if I'm talking to Dana has pressed,

5003
02:10:05,741 --> 02:10:06,574
I'd be hard pressed.

5004
02:10:07,030 --> 02:10:08,230
I'd be hard pressed to pass.

5005
02:10:08,231 --> 02:10:10,330
Josh Barnett's offer
hunt is going to like,

5006
02:10:10,331 --> 02:10:10,990
hey bitch,

5007
02:10:10,990 --> 02:10:13,930
I ain't the undertaker fucking
uppercut and second row,

5008
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:14,711
suck it up.

5009
02:10:14,711 --> 02:10:15,640
Let me tell you something,

5010
02:10:15,641 --> 02:10:15,821
man.

5011
02:10:15,821 --> 02:10:19,720
Josh Barnett is not a fucking easy fight
for saying he is Barnett's a fucking

5012
02:10:19,721 --> 02:10:20,351
monster.

5013
02:10:20,351 --> 02:10:23,290
I'm saying hunt isn't a cakewalk.

5014
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:23,801
No,

5015
02:10:23,801 --> 02:10:24,041
no,

5016
02:10:24,041 --> 02:10:24,251
no.

5017
02:10:24,251 --> 02:10:25,990
Neither guy that can wrestle.

5018
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:26,853
Exactly.

5019
02:10:26,890 --> 02:10:28,030
Exactly what cut can't.

5020
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:28,301
Yeah,

5021
02:10:28,301 --> 02:10:33,301
but Bob Brock Lesnar is a fucking genuine
NCAA two times 96 but he's still a

5022
02:10:36,111 --> 02:10:38,240
fucking gorilla wrestler.

5023
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:39,950
He hasn't fought and how long?

5024
02:10:40,350 --> 02:10:40,940
It's a good point.

5025
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:41,960
That's a huge point.

5026
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:42,880
Yeah.

5027
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:43,311
I mean,

5028
02:10:43,311 --> 02:10:44,510
you know our cousin from,

5029
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:48,010
we're going to get too weird hunt.

5030
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:51,210
This has some weird Goddamn Donaldson.

5031
02:10:51,211 --> 02:10:52,210
Ronin yeah,

5032
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:53,233
Donald's up.

5033
02:10:54,290 --> 02:10:57,470
He's a bad motherfucker
to do this to Patrick.

5034
02:10:58,210 --> 02:11:02,390
You never see passionate about take turns
to 70 think about the cool fight to 70

5035
02:11:02,391 --> 02:11:02,981
for Donald.

5036
02:11:02,981 --> 02:11:04,430
Ever see Patrick Otay Turtle.

5037
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:05,120
I'd love it.

5038
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:06,010
I love him at seven.

5039
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:07,033
I love it.

5040
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:09,080
Even get scratched now.

5041
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:10,730
Good as it gets.

5042
02:11:10,731 --> 02:11:12,320
I'll be on the boat tomorrow morning.

5043
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:12,860
Yeah,

5044
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:17,020
he'll be doing some jet skiing or
fucking riding a bull or some shit.

5045
02:11:17,021 --> 02:11:18,290
Fucking a bear for sure.

5046
02:11:18,291 --> 02:11:19,040
Relaxed on it.

5047
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:20,120
He's a different kind of guy,

5048
02:11:20,121 --> 02:11:20,570
man.

5049
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:20,811
I mean,

5050
02:11:20,811 --> 02:11:22,340
this is what makes him happy.

5051
02:11:22,370 --> 02:11:23,840
He likes doing crazy shit.

5052
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:26,150
I'm a big fan.

5053
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:29,000
Shaved my head just like him as a person.

5054
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:30,350
Good Fun,

5055
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:31,310
Warren Dude.

5056
02:11:31,430 --> 02:11:32,580
You know what Donald said to me wants,

5057
02:11:32,581 --> 02:11:33,080
man,

5058
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:35,060
I only met him like maybe twice.

5059
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:35,570
You know?

5060
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:37,280
I was like early on the day and I said,

5061
02:11:37,281 --> 02:11:37,671
hey man,

5062
02:11:37,671 --> 02:11:38,061
what's up?

5063
02:11:38,061 --> 02:11:39,250
And I rent to give him a handshake.

5064
02:11:39,260 --> 02:11:39,591
Goes all.

5065
02:11:39,591 --> 02:11:40,101
Come on man.

5066
02:11:40,101 --> 02:11:41,030
We hug around here.

5067
02:11:41,330 --> 02:11:41,601
Yeah,

5068
02:11:41,601 --> 02:11:42,170
that's good.

5069
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:43,003
It gives you a hug,

5070
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:44,510
but it's a genuine hug.

5071
02:11:45,230 --> 02:11:45,680
It's not,

5072
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:47,420
it's not political or he's not.

5073
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:49,070
Now he's really starting.

5074
02:11:49,090 --> 02:11:51,570
Podcasts are now Jackson's gym.

5075
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:52,420
Subscribing.

5076
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:52,850
Yes.

5077
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:53,460
I'll take it.

5078
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:53,661
Yeah.

5079
02:11:53,661 --> 02:11:54,710
Everybody should podcast.

5080
02:11:54,711 --> 02:11:56,090
He calls it the companion for sure.

5081
02:11:56,830 --> 02:11:57,591
It's the same way.

5082
02:11:57,591 --> 02:11:58,550
You have a fucking,

5083
02:11:58,551 --> 02:11:59,510
why not call it the campaign?

5084
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:00,031
I'm just kidding.

5085
02:12:00,031 --> 02:12:00,690
He gives a shit.

5086
02:12:00,690 --> 02:12:01,670
Know what you'd call it?

5087
02:12:01,671 --> 02:12:02,370
The same way.

5088
02:12:02,370 --> 02:12:03,470
[inaudible] companion.

5089
02:12:03,530 --> 02:12:04,430
I think that's a show.

5090
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:05,353
Something like this

5091
02:12:07,370 --> 02:12:08,330
bad motherfuckers.

5092
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:10,100
He calls a bad motherfucker ranch.

5093
02:12:10,190 --> 02:12:10,341
Well,

5094
02:12:10,341 --> 02:12:10,851
it's like a,

5095
02:12:10,851 --> 02:12:11,330
what was that?

5096
02:12:11,330 --> 02:12:13,460
A Garren Keeler sir.

5097
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,920
Sekai prairie home companion guy.

5098
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:16,480
Oh yeah,

5099
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:17,680
garrison Keillor.

5100
02:12:17,681 --> 02:12:18,514
Is that his name?

5101
02:12:18,890 --> 02:12:19,011
Well,

5102
02:12:19,011 --> 02:12:20,750
there was a radio show that
was like a really famous,

5103
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:22,950
his name is called,

5104
02:12:23,010 --> 02:12:23,811
I don't remember his name,

5105
02:12:23,811 --> 02:12:25,130
but he a garrison.

5106
02:12:25,190 --> 02:12:26,023
He had a,

5107
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:27,860
he had it on NPR every Sunday.

5108
02:12:27,890 --> 02:12:28,531
I've never fucking,

5109
02:12:28,531 --> 02:12:30,680
it's one of those things that people
listen to when you're inconsistent,

5110
02:12:30,890 --> 02:12:31,960
was completely shut down.

5111
02:12:31,980 --> 02:12:33,480
You're no longer interested in fuck that.

5112
02:12:33,490 --> 02:12:34,323
All

5113
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:36,940
guys joking.

5114
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:38,450
The prairie home companion,

5115
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:39,220
is it,

5116
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:41,210
is it part of the public's radio path?

5117
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:43,880
I don't remember fucking heard of them.

5118
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:44,301
Well,

5119
02:12:44,301 --> 02:12:48,590
it's a famous thing and I don't believe
I've ever listened to a whole one.

5120
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:49,341
But,

5121
02:12:49,341 --> 02:12:49,521
uh,

5122
02:12:49,521 --> 02:12:50,810
I know that it's a big piece.

5123
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:53,360
Was still doing the damn thing this to be,

5124
02:12:53,390 --> 02:12:55,070
this would be the main event gentleman.

5125
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:55,780
Yeah.

5126
02:12:55,780 --> 02:12:55,970
It's,

5127
02:12:55,970 --> 02:12:58,040
I hope you guys are
ready to fucking fight.

5128
02:12:58,370 --> 02:12:58,970
Okay,

5129
02:12:58,970 --> 02:12:59,870
let's break this down.

5130
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:00,500
Brendan Shop,

5131
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:01,790
Eddie Bravo and Brian.

5132
02:13:01,791 --> 02:13:02,850
Model Oregon crone.

5133
02:13:03,190 --> 02:13:04,130
What do you guys think?

5134
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:05,240
Let's start with Brian.

5135
02:13:05,270 --> 02:13:05,451
What?

5136
02:13:05,451 --> 02:13:05,930
Maine,

5137
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:06,591
what do I say?

5138
02:13:06,591 --> 02:13:07,424
What do you think?

5139
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:08,263
I mean,

5140
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:09,740
look it.

5141
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:11,630
Here's the problem.

5142
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:12,853
Here's the problem.

5143
02:13:12,950 --> 02:13:13,730
There's no problems.

5144
02:13:13,730 --> 02:13:13,960
Rory.

5145
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:15,050
He's trained,

5146
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:16,940
trained with Wonderboy.

5147
02:13:17,970 --> 02:13:18,850
He alive.

5148
02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:24,260
I'm not [inaudible] let me finish.

5149
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:31,530
If Rory Rory gives him space,

5150
02:13:31,531 --> 02:13:32,010
it's going to be a

5151
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:32,843
disaster.

5152
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:36,120
If Rory stays in boxing
wrestling distance,

5153
02:13:36,150 --> 02:13:36,931
he's going to be,

5154
02:13:36,931 --> 02:13:38,010
he's going to win this fight.

5155
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:40,230
But I don't know if you can do that now.

5156
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:41,620
I don't know if you
can do that with Kevin,

5157
02:13:41,650 --> 02:13:42,483
with Wonderboy.

5158
02:13:42,630 --> 02:13:45,000
Wonderboy may have figured
out distance you want to be,

5159
02:13:45,001 --> 02:13:49,010
may have figured out how to keep a gun
in a way to close to close back here.

5160
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:51,330
Let me hear what Brendan,

5161
02:13:51,331 --> 02:13:51,790
thanks.

5162
02:13:51,790 --> 02:13:53,220
I'll take here what,

5163
02:13:53,221 --> 02:13:53,520
Brendan,

5164
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:53,760
thanks.

5165
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:54,840
I'll get to you next.

5166
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:56,610
I want to hear what your
employee has too many tools.

5167
02:13:56,611 --> 02:13:58,640
He's too smart and he's a,

5168
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:01,280
they've trained together before
it Tristar and for us help,

5169
02:14:01,550 --> 02:14:01,780
uh,

5170
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:02,850
Wonderboy out a bunch.

5171
02:14:02,851 --> 02:14:06,570
So they know his tricks and I think Roy
wins this fight and it's good for the

5172
02:14:06,571 --> 02:14:10,170
sport because he's a free agent and
he'd go test the free market waters.

5173
02:14:10,380 --> 02:14:11,880
So it changes the sport for the good.

5174
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:12,540
Interesting.

5175
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:12,721
Eddie,

5176
02:14:12,721 --> 02:14:15,900
probably you think it's too close to call?

5177
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:16,913
That's why we should bet.

5178
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:18,320
But if I had a,

5179
02:14:18,321 --> 02:14:19,650
if I had a gun to my head,

5180
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:21,000
I would go with,

5181
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,060
you're right on paper.

5182
02:14:24,061 --> 02:14:25,240
You're right Roy,

5183
02:14:25,241 --> 02:14:26,940
you make too many tools,

5184
02:14:27,110 --> 02:14:29,460
but because he can just strike in Russell,

5185
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:30,630
Stephen Thompson,

5186
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:33,510
he's just so quick coming in and out.

5187
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:34,793
I'm gonna just,

5188
02:14:35,190 --> 02:14:36,420
just with that kind of shit,

5189
02:14:36,421 --> 02:14:37,350
this is explosive.

5190
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:40,050
So difficult cause [inaudible]
go with that just for a goof.

5191
02:14:40,051 --> 02:14:43,080
Volta analysts picked
Wonderboy on UFC tonight.

5192
02:14:43,081 --> 02:14:43,470
By the way,

5193
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:44,210
here's the thing.

5194
02:14:44,210 --> 02:14:46,830
Stuff like wonder boy has been hit before.

5195
02:14:46,831 --> 02:14:48,270
It didn't Ellenberger tag him.

5196
02:14:48,510 --> 02:14:49,530
Yes he did.

5197
02:14:49,531 --> 02:14:49,660
Right?

5198
02:14:49,660 --> 02:14:49,721
He,

5199
02:14:49,721 --> 02:14:50,730
Matt and Matt Brown.

5200
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:51,151
Yeah.

5201
02:14:51,151 --> 02:14:51,750
Matt Brown.

5202
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:53,060
Well Matt Brown was a,

5203
02:14:54,110 --> 02:14:54,780
but,

5204
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:55,890
but in his words,

5205
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:59,040
he said that he was overtrained going
into that fight and then he made some

5206
02:14:59,041 --> 02:15:00,710
mistakes or we all and uh,

5207
02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:01,010
it,

5208
02:15:01,010 --> 02:15:02,730
it's totally possible that's truth.

5209
02:15:02,730 --> 02:15:07,730
But he also fought Matt motherfucking
Brown and you might feel like you got

5210
02:15:08,130 --> 02:15:10,860
overtrained if you fight Matt Motherfuck,

5211
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:12,420
that pressure son Matt Brown,

5212
02:15:12,421 --> 02:15:15,270
we'll put some pressure on you and you'd
be looking for solutions is a mortal.

5213
02:15:15,271 --> 02:15:20,010
He takes you to a dark place and
dark place before you might think,

5214
02:15:20,011 --> 02:15:20,211
man,

5215
02:15:20,211 --> 02:15:20,320
it's,

5216
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:23,250
I'm going to poison my
fucking soup 100% not bitch.

5217
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:28,200
That's not Matt Brown Cardio Cardio,

5218
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:33,860
beating that ass and draining in a way
that only a dude who's died and been

5219
02:15:33,931 --> 02:15:38,670
brought back to life by emps can do for
Ruby size clothes because to him and

5220
02:15:38,671 --> 02:15:39,720
Donald came that pain.

5221
02:15:39,721 --> 02:15:40,640
Besides Carl's comment,

5222
02:15:40,650 --> 02:15:41,820
when he was really young,

5223
02:15:41,970 --> 02:15:46,600
the only person Rory Macdonald's
lost who I believe is Robbie Lawler.

5224
02:15:46,650 --> 02:15:47,390
Am I right?

5225
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:49,290
Call callers conduct
you list Robbie Lawler.

5226
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:50,153
That's it.

5227
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:50,880
That I can,

5228
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:51,601
and he was beating.

5229
02:15:51,601 --> 02:15:52,800
Who else can call his conduct?

5230
02:15:52,830 --> 02:15:54,120
Bring that kind of darkness.

5231
02:15:54,570 --> 02:15:56,670
Court McGee coordinate well,

5232
02:15:56,671 --> 02:15:56,881
yeah,

5233
02:15:56,881 --> 02:15:57,714
he brings,

5234
02:15:58,620 --> 02:15:59,940
she brings that same dark.

5235
02:15:59,970 --> 02:16:02,380
He's talking about that touch
of death done was such a death.

5236
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:03,793
There's data,

5237
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:07,530
there's fucking this mortal Matt
Brown and there's Court Mcgee.

5238
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:09,690
Mcgee might lose some
fights and he's a very,

5239
02:16:09,691 --> 02:16:10,321
very tough guy,

5240
02:16:10,321 --> 02:16:11,071
but he's in a very,

5241
02:16:11,071 --> 02:16:13,800
very difficult division with
a lot of very tough guys,

5242
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:18,510
but there's a darkness to court brings
when he starts beating that ass dark too.

5243
02:16:18,650 --> 02:16:22,560
He beats that ass in a very
fucking animalistic clinical way,

5244
02:16:22,561 --> 02:16:26,100
like a technical clinical way where
he's seen the edge because he has a

5245
02:16:26,101 --> 02:16:27,610
technique from the grim reaper he's got,

5246
02:16:27,870 --> 02:16:29,710
he's been to the edge of time for real.

5247
02:16:29,711 --> 02:16:30,730
They both have come back.

5248
02:16:30,731 --> 02:16:31,600
Him and Matt Brown.

5249
02:16:31,630 --> 02:16:32,201
It's not,

5250
02:16:32,201 --> 02:16:34,060
they carry with them
some Harry Potter Shit.

5251
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:36,010
Yup.

5252
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:37,300
Frighteners in this bitch.

5253
02:16:37,301 --> 02:16:39,910
This is why this could
never be on television.

5254
02:16:39,911 --> 02:16:41,740
Ever understand folks?

5255
02:16:41,790 --> 02:16:42,760
Never,

5256
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:45,460
I haven't made a call yet.

5257
02:16:45,550 --> 02:16:46,383
I'm going to go.

5258
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:47,720
Okay,

5259
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:48,011
let me,

5260
02:16:48,011 --> 02:16:48,580
can I say,

5261
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:49,413
yeah,

5262
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:53,350
I think I agree with you guys
that if you looked at it on paper,

5263
02:16:53,351 --> 02:16:54,860
brewery is a,

5264
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:59,350
he's a more difficult challenge because
he has more tools and he can knock guys

5265
02:16:59,351 --> 02:17:00,041
out that are legit.

5266
02:17:00,041 --> 02:17:01,690
Strikers like Terex happening.

5267
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:03,020
He's not going to tech staff.

5268
02:17:03,021 --> 02:17:05,800
And he was big because
Safa deans or like a very,

5269
02:17:05,801 --> 02:17:09,610
very skillful striker and Safford Dean
ran a clinic on Nate Marquardt to when

5270
02:17:09,611 --> 02:17:13,510
the Strikeforce welterweight title is a
clinic clinic of leg kicks and technique

5271
02:17:13,511 --> 02:17:14,230
and footwork.

5272
02:17:14,230 --> 02:17:15,430
He's really good striker.

5273
02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:19,570
So for Rory did not came out the way he
did is pretty stunning and it's Roy's

5274
02:17:19,571 --> 02:17:22,660
interchanges between wrestling and
striking the can make a big difference in

5275
02:17:22,661 --> 02:17:27,550
this fight because Roy's fluid in that
where as Stephen Wonderboy Thompson,

5276
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:31,120
unless he figures out a way to put Roy
on his back early and shake him up the

5277
02:17:31,121 --> 02:17:32,200
way boats he tried to do.

5278
02:17:32,410 --> 02:17:36,190
But the danger with that is
Rory has a wicked fucking guard.

5279
02:17:36,191 --> 02:17:37,900
He's fast off of his back.

5280
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:41,530
He moves quick and he tries to set
up sweeps and all my plot this,

5281
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:42,530
we went to draw meditech.

5282
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:43,360
Right.

5283
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:45,160
And you might not have seen it before,

5284
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:47,920
but it is legit as fuck.

5285
02:17:47,921 --> 02:17:50,800
He went to a draw with JT Torres.

5286
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:51,581
He did.

5287
02:17:51,581 --> 02:17:52,000
Well.

5288
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,470
Do you understand folks?

5289
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:58,500
I mean don't understand like this is
like the top of the food chain Brazilian

5290
02:17:59,081 --> 02:18:00,490
Jujitsu competitors.

5291
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:01,410
He's a killer.

5292
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:02,680
He's in that breed.

5293
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:04,900
So homeland,

5294
02:18:05,170 --> 02:18:05,830
exactly.

5295
02:18:05,830 --> 02:18:10,830
So Roy McDonald can go to the ground at
that high of a level and survive without

5296
02:18:10,871 --> 02:18:11,340
getting tapped.

5297
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:11,951
They're really close.

5298
02:18:11,951 --> 02:18:13,070
Kin tapped his arm,

5299
02:18:13,071 --> 02:18:13,904
got jacked up,

5300
02:18:14,530 --> 02:18:16,960
but he didn't get in trouble
or his arm is fucked.

5301
02:18:16,961 --> 02:18:19,090
He was saying we're fucked and he
had a fight like three weeks later.

5302
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:21,610
He's a mad band.

5303
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:23,470
He's also the Canadian serial killer.

5304
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:24,041
But Dude,

5305
02:18:24,041 --> 02:18:24,551
I'm telling you,

5306
02:18:24,551 --> 02:18:24,911
man,

5307
02:18:24,911 --> 02:18:29,080
one of the things that came about him
being on my podcast is people got to

5308
02:18:29,081 --> 02:18:32,500
really understand your
only CNM in his game face.

5309
02:18:32,550 --> 02:18:32,630
Oh,

5310
02:18:32,630 --> 02:18:32,850
he's,

5311
02:18:32,850 --> 02:18:33,000
Oh,

5312
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:33,490
course.

5313
02:18:33,490 --> 02:18:34,990
He seems like he's a psycho.

5314
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:36,670
But when he was on the podcast,

5315
02:18:36,690 --> 02:18:37,523
Larry's,

5316
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:39,220
when he was on this podcast,

5317
02:18:39,490 --> 02:18:43,240
people got a chance to see him like
as an actual person and they're like,

5318
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:43,721
oh,

5319
02:18:43,721 --> 02:18:45,960
I've only been seeing you
when you're competing now.

5320
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,350
He's the bad dude.

5321
02:18:47,620 --> 02:18:49,410
What do some great,

5322
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:50,420
nice sense of humor.

5323
02:18:52,270 --> 02:18:53,700
This is a perfect example.

5324
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:54,910
What we were talking about.

5325
02:18:54,911 --> 02:18:56,320
We're talking about with Connor.

5326
02:18:56,440 --> 02:18:58,300
This is the guy that should be applauded.

5327
02:18:58,301 --> 02:19:00,640
He is a fucking intelligent,

5328
02:19:00,730 --> 02:19:01,391
savvy.

5329
02:19:01,391 --> 02:19:02,151
There's a superstar,

5330
02:19:02,151 --> 02:19:02,591
has number one,

5331
02:19:02,591 --> 02:19:02,890
a bell,

5332
02:19:02,890 --> 02:19:04,190
exact face of cancer.

5333
02:19:04,191 --> 02:19:06,980
Exact number one close still.

5334
02:19:07,050 --> 02:19:07,883
Then when the bell

5335
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:11,320
say dicker down,

5336
02:19:11,590 --> 02:19:14,350
that came from him at
the time I was single.

5337
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,460
She was single.

5338
02:19:15,490 --> 02:19:16,570
There's a bunch of girls in Vegas.

5339
02:19:16,571 --> 02:19:17,260
He goes,

5340
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:19,990
it's time to separate that mother hand
from the goose and take them down.

5341
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:22,331
Oh,

5342
02:19:22,331 --> 02:19:23,200
he's tall,

5343
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:24,073
tall

5344
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:27,980
and I had to write it into
my phone to remember the

5345
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,670
next morning.

5346
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:31,240
He's an animal that's other hands.

5347
02:19:31,270 --> 02:19:33,190
There was one girl like taking Google.

5348
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:34,730
That's a funny piece of advice.

5349
02:19:34,731 --> 02:19:35,141
He's good.

5350
02:19:35,141 --> 02:19:35,811
He's the best.

5351
02:19:35,811 --> 02:19:37,430
He's his nose looks different.

5352
02:19:37,470 --> 02:19:37,810
He sold,

5353
02:19:37,810 --> 02:19:39,190
he's talking to a lot of shots,

5354
02:19:39,360 --> 02:19:39,650
man.

5355
02:19:39,650 --> 02:19:40,461
Robbie Lawler fight.

5356
02:19:40,461 --> 02:19:41,530
He got his nose destroyed.

5357
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:43,310
You mean wonder man?

5358
02:19:43,311 --> 02:19:45,320
He's 33 he's a really good dude,

5359
02:19:45,321 --> 02:19:45,680
man.

5360
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:46,700
He's a really good dude.

5361
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:47,860
I'm a big fan.

5362
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:48,853
They're both great guys.

5363
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:49,550
Good guys.

5364
02:19:49,550 --> 02:19:50,630
You know both of them pretty well,

5365
02:19:50,631 --> 02:19:50,930
right?

5366
02:19:50,930 --> 02:19:51,321
Really,

5367
02:19:51,321 --> 02:19:52,610
really well trained
partners for a long time,

5368
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:54,500
but Roy McDonald,

5369
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:56,210
just for the good of the sport.

5370
02:19:56,211 --> 02:19:57,800
If he rent and testis free agency,

5371
02:19:57,801 --> 02:19:59,240
it helps to grow the sport.

5372
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:00,890
But let me just say this about Wonderboy.

5373
02:20:01,010 --> 02:20:05,660
Wonderboy is extraordinary and in his
ability to close the distance and land

5374
02:20:05,661 --> 02:20:08,960
these like thunderous shots out of
nowhere of the best in the world.

5375
02:20:08,961 --> 02:20:13,790
These combinations are so fluid that
they're enough for him to land one or two

5376
02:20:13,791 --> 02:20:15,410
hard shots every exchange.

5377
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:17,570
And if he does that,

5378
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:22,660
if he somehow or another can tempt
Rory into some hypnotic dance,

5379
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:23,631
Jude,

5380
02:20:23,631 --> 02:20:25,280
some high level shit on him,

5381
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:29,150
it's all in his ability to have stuff
to take down if he feels super confident

5382
02:20:29,151 --> 02:20:29,984
in his ability stuff,

5383
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:30,650
takedown.

5384
02:20:30,650 --> 02:20:32,420
Cause he'd been training
with Weidman so much,

5385
02:20:32,421 --> 02:20:33,300
he hasn't been training with

5386
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:36,960
fire but it may,

5387
02:20:36,961 --> 02:20:38,510
but it made a big difference.

5388
02:20:38,511 --> 02:20:39,344
Wonderboy,

5389
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:40,490
Wonderboy is going to win this fight.

5390
02:20:40,491 --> 02:20:43,790
His understanding of how to
stuff takedowns his stuff,

5391
02:20:43,850 --> 02:20:46,220
his takedowns stuffing
is at a very high level.

5392
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:49,670
It absolutely has something
to do a training with Weidman.

5393
02:20:49,671 --> 02:20:53,420
But it's not saying that he's so silly
that he would substitute that and not

5394
02:20:53,421 --> 02:20:55,250
have a high level wrestler test him.

5395
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:56,353
He's not dumb.

5396
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:57,590
He's a smart guy.

5397
02:20:57,630 --> 02:20:58,280
So is his dad,

5398
02:20:58,280 --> 02:20:58,820
if I can call it.

5399
02:20:58,820 --> 02:21:00,710
I think Roy eats his lunch.

5400
02:21:00,860 --> 02:21:05,860
I think I love 100% I am
100% 50 50 on this fight.

5401
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:10,700
100% just for just to be controversial
because you know how I am guys.

5402
02:21:10,970 --> 02:21:11,840
I'm calling me.

5403
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:13,970
Are you a rebel Wonderboy?

5404
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:17,930
Wonderboy by knocked out
Brian kick knock out.

5405
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:19,550
Well Roy and if there's any,

5406
02:21:20,670 --> 02:21:22,040
if there's anybody can knock him out.

5407
02:21:22,041 --> 02:21:23,770
It's roaring and keeps its Wonderboy.

5408
02:21:23,810 --> 02:21:25,820
If people get mad at
me being noncommittal,

5409
02:21:25,821 --> 02:21:29,270
it's not because I like both of these
gentlemen and it's really honestly because

5410
02:21:29,271 --> 02:21:31,460
this sport is so fucking crazy

5411
02:21:35,170 --> 02:21:36,170
being knocked out.

5412
02:21:36,171 --> 02:21:37,980
Luke Rockhold on my first,

5413
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:39,800
my baby fell asleep.

5414
02:21:40,460 --> 02:21:41,900
I finally pumps it first.

5415
02:21:41,901 --> 02:21:42,860
I remember I put them asleep.

5416
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:44,180
Mike knocks him out.

5417
02:21:44,181 --> 02:21:45,180
I love my good buddy.

5418
02:21:45,181 --> 02:21:45,800
I went,

5419
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:48,090
Oh shit are crying.

5420
02:21:48,380 --> 02:21:49,330
Fuck mine.

5421
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:51,300
I even texted him that you woke up my kid,

5422
02:21:51,301 --> 02:21:52,134
but it's worth it.

5423
02:21:52,570 --> 02:21:57,570
That's how I fucking crying when when
Bisbing one I felt like crying 10 fucking

5424
02:21:58,131 --> 02:21:58,370
years.

5425
02:21:58,370 --> 02:21:59,030
It was happy for him.

5426
02:21:59,030 --> 02:21:59,790
I wish he had.

5427
02:21:59,790 --> 02:22:04,160
I wish she hadn't gotten on on top
of the fence and gotten fuck you.

5428
02:22:04,340 --> 02:22:09,240
That was whatever the guy he
was on a roller coaster ride

5429
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:14,000
him winning the fight and winning
the world title like that.

5430
02:22:14,001 --> 02:22:15,500
You can't fault him for that.

5431
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:17,780
Talk to him when the dust settles.

5432
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:19,970
Talked to him on Monday and he's barely,

5433
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:20,361
yes,

5434
02:22:20,361 --> 02:22:24,410
back to Michael Bisping
Dennison to UFC title.

5435
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:25,244
They both walk.

5436
02:22:25,470 --> 02:22:28,470
It's the best story of all time.

5437
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:29,910
I never seen a knockout like that.

5438
02:22:30,210 --> 02:22:30,631
Look at this.

5439
02:22:30,631 --> 02:22:31,464
Look at this.

5440
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:32,131
Oh my God.

5441
02:22:32,131 --> 02:22:32,670
Here we go.

5442
02:22:32,670 --> 02:22:33,450
Here we go.

5443
02:22:33,450 --> 02:22:34,470
Now here's the question.

5444
02:22:34,471 --> 02:22:35,101
Here's the question.

5445
02:22:35,101 --> 02:22:36,900
Can Rory threaten him enough?

5446
02:22:36,901 --> 02:22:39,770
We'd take towns to get him
off of his game of strike.

5447
02:22:39,830 --> 02:22:40,663
You can kick too.

5448
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:44,550
I don't like how course Wonderboy is
coming to them or does Roy decide that all

5449
02:22:44,551 --> 02:22:47,850
that training with Raymond Daniels has
made him comfortable enough with it,

5450
02:22:47,851 --> 02:22:52,380
a legit high level karate striker that
he thinks he can look at the sideways.

5451
02:22:52,380 --> 02:22:53,220
He's just sideways.

5452
02:22:53,460 --> 02:22:54,241
Rory smart.

5453
02:22:54,241 --> 02:22:54,731
The haunt.

5454
02:22:54,731 --> 02:22:55,260
He's,

5455
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:55,411
well,

5456
02:22:55,411 --> 02:22:57,330
he's Daniel's fight sideways too,

5457
02:22:57,331 --> 02:23:00,750
which is one of the interesting things
because Thompson is one of the few guys

5458
02:23:00,751 --> 02:23:02,190
that can pull off that stance.

5459
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:04,590
It's a total front leg side kick.

5460
02:23:04,591 --> 02:23:07,170
You know where in front
of like Brown and na,

5461
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:08,790
but Liotta doesn't do it as good as him.

5462
02:23:08,830 --> 02:23:09,890
She used to back in the day.

5463
02:23:10,230 --> 02:23:12,210
Justin Scoggins does it very well.

5464
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:13,560
That flyway kid.

5465
02:23:13,590 --> 02:23:13,921
Yeah,

5466
02:23:13,921 --> 02:23:15,060
he does it very well.

5467
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:15,300
Yeah,

5468
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:16,050
very well.

5469
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:17,890
He's one of the maybe the best at it.

5470
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:18,960
Be the best next to him.

5471
02:23:19,020 --> 02:23:19,890
Better moves.

5472
02:23:19,891 --> 02:23:21,780
Fantastic moves like a fucking,

5473
02:23:21,790 --> 02:23:23,490
he's a high level kid.

5474
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:25,170
That's got a lot of potential,

5475
02:23:25,410 --> 02:23:29,850
but if you can pull that stance off and
control with that front leg like a jab,

5476
02:23:29,970 --> 02:23:31,790
there's a lot of guys that
aren't ready for that.

5477
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:36,480
That fucking left leg is wound up for
him to see when Valtellina fought Raymond

5478
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:36,481
Daniels,

5479
02:23:36,481 --> 02:23:41,060
what do [inaudible] fuck?

5480
02:23:41,230 --> 02:23:42,950
Oh my sneaky fucker.

5481
02:23:45,300 --> 02:23:46,950
Introduction of danger.

5482
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:48,570
Introduction with danger.

5483
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:49,920
He's so smart.

5484
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:51,090
I roll.

5485
02:23:51,330 --> 02:23:52,320
It's like being in the very,

5486
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:53,340
very important.

5487
02:23:53,341 --> 02:23:54,240
He's a killer man.

5488
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:56,250
Tristar.

5489
02:23:56,250 --> 02:23:57,390
Tristar is heavy,

5490
02:23:57,391 --> 02:23:58,970
deep into leg Rasa.

5491
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:00,840
Done for us.

5492
02:24:00,841 --> 02:24:03,280
Donna Harris comes up there.

5493
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:05,040
So those guys are all about like,

5494
02:24:05,070 --> 02:24:09,270
oh guys for us a hobby apparently
is not down with the ketogenic diet.

5495
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:09,960
He feels it.

5496
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:10,161
Yeah.

5497
02:24:10,161 --> 02:24:10,470
Yeah.

5498
02:24:10,470 --> 02:24:12,690
I would love to talk to him about
that because I'm an atheist,

5499
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:14,530
so smart and he's smarter than me.

5500
02:24:14,531 --> 02:24:15,540
It worries me.

5501
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:20,370
I like you look good bro.

5502
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:20,840
I like it.

5503
02:24:20,840 --> 02:24:23,160
I'm very happy with your
kid or let me know about it.

5504
02:24:23,161 --> 02:24:24,240
He might not be correct.

5505
02:24:24,270 --> 02:24:25,380
I don't know who's correct.

5506
02:24:25,470 --> 02:24:25,750
I mean,

5507
02:24:25,750 --> 02:24:27,380
and it might not be Whoa,

5508
02:24:27,390 --> 02:24:27,730
nice.

5509
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:29,600
How fast.

5510
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,290
He's also so confident.

5511
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:34,180
We're always throwing head
kicks man and he dies,

5512
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:38,760
he can kick and also it keeps him at a
distance where he can head kick Thompson

5513
02:24:38,761 --> 02:24:41,610
but Thompson has to move forward
to counter with that punch.

5514
02:24:41,730 --> 02:24:42,061
So He,

5515
02:24:42,061 --> 02:24:44,520
if he can get that head kick
off as quick as he just did,

5516
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:46,710
it gives Wonderboy
something to think about it.

5517
02:24:46,711 --> 02:24:47,071
Guess what?

5518
02:24:47,071 --> 02:24:47,530
All of a sudden,

5519
02:24:47,530 --> 02:24:48,363
hold on a second dude.

5520
02:24:48,570 --> 02:24:51,180
Cause Wonderboy is always used
to fighting on the outside.

5521
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:54,150
So if Rory can be the guy on the outside
because he threatens with that head

5522
02:24:54,151 --> 02:24:54,391
kick,

5523
02:24:54,391 --> 02:24:57,880
it changes the whole cause
I ain't gonna us Zack.

5524
02:24:57,970 --> 02:24:59,310
It looks like he's fighting.

5525
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:01,230
He's mirroring uh,

5526
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:02,220
Wonderboy style.

5527
02:25:02,221 --> 02:25:02,520
Right.

5528
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:03,291
That's what it looks like.

5529
02:25:03,291 --> 02:25:05,250
He also has the best job
at one 70 in the world.

5530
02:25:05,251 --> 02:25:05,371
Yeah.

5531
02:25:05,371 --> 02:25:06,090
He's got a very good job.

5532
02:25:06,090 --> 02:25:08,250
He looks like he's mirroring
his exact style though.

5533
02:25:08,251 --> 02:25:08,630
Stamps,

5534
02:25:08,630 --> 02:25:09,463
stance,

5535
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:10,343
everything.

5536
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:11,433
Well,

5537
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:12,330
it's interesting if he can,

5538
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:13,830
if he can threaten more
with the head kick,

5539
02:25:13,831 --> 02:25:14,611
that's really interesting.

5540
02:25:14,611 --> 02:25:16,230
If he can hide it behind those punches.

5541
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:17,910
Damn.

5542
02:25:17,910 --> 02:25:19,630
Not really right now.

5543
02:25:21,430 --> 02:25:21,680
Hey,

5544
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:22,290
look like rocks.

5545
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:23,123
One Guy South Park.

5546
02:25:23,140 --> 02:25:23,780
But days looks like,

5547
02:25:23,780 --> 02:25:24,041
yeah,

5548
02:25:24,041 --> 02:25:24,460
that's,

5549
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:25,293
that's accurate.

5550
02:25:25,370 --> 02:25:26,203
But they look like,

5551
02:25:27,060 --> 02:25:27,440
no,

5552
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:27,690
no,

5553
02:25:27,690 --> 02:25:28,080
no,

5554
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:28,230
no,

5555
02:25:28,230 --> 02:25:28,750
no.

5556
02:25:28,750 --> 02:25:29,590
I know what you're saying.

5557
02:25:29,650 --> 02:25:29,831
Yeah.

5558
02:25:29,831 --> 02:25:33,160
He's mirroring him in terms of he's
standing much more sideways and easily.

5559
02:25:33,410 --> 02:25:33,661
Yes.

5560
02:25:33,661 --> 02:25:34,090
Yeah.

5561
02:25:34,090 --> 02:25:37,360
Well he's done a lot of sparring with
Daniels and he understands how to negate

5562
02:25:37,361 --> 02:25:38,230
that front leg kick.

5563
02:25:38,350 --> 02:25:41,350
See that front leg kick is way
more effective if you're slightly,

5564
02:25:42,070 --> 02:25:44,890
slightly square because you
fight like a tie fighter.

5565
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:47,140
You expose that front and tie fighters.

5566
02:25:47,141 --> 02:25:48,340
They throw a lot of tips,

5567
02:25:48,490 --> 02:25:52,840
but they don't necessarily throw the
same kind of sidekicks unless they have

5568
02:25:52,841 --> 02:25:54,730
some sort of other backgrounds as well.

5569
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:55,990
Roy's biggest advantage.

5570
02:25:55,991 --> 02:25:58,090
He's so smart and put it all together.

5571
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,280
George Saint Pierre is,

5572
02:26:00,370 --> 02:26:01,203
Oh yeah man.

5573
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:01,571
No,

5574
02:26:01,571 --> 02:26:02,404
he's legit.

5575
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:03,333
He's luck.

5576
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:06,390
The switch.

5577
02:26:06,390 --> 02:26:07,720
Some spinning back kick.

5578
02:26:07,721 --> 02:26:08,340
Yeah,

5579
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:08,820
he's got it.

5580
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:09,581
Well that's the thing.

5581
02:26:09,581 --> 02:26:10,890
See Training with us.

5582
02:26:10,930 --> 02:26:12,070
20 with Raymond Daniels.

5583
02:26:12,190 --> 02:26:12,330
Well,

5584
02:26:12,330 --> 02:26:15,040
I'd like both of these nerves
but trainer with Raymond Daniels,

5585
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:16,120
but tires you for that.

5586
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:17,760
You know you're,

5587
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:19,360
you're okay.

5588
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:19,511
No,

5589
02:26:19,511 --> 02:26:20,344
I'm just kidding.

5590
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:21,970
I love both these guys.

5591
02:26:22,330 --> 02:26:25,610
See that front leg side
kick style like Balta.

5592
02:26:25,660 --> 02:26:26,780
Leni beat that down.

5593
02:26:26,781 --> 02:26:27,614
Hands down.

5594
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:29,160
Oh sidekick.

5595
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:31,000
It's a nice sidekick.

5596
02:26:31,470 --> 02:26:32,261
So slick.

5597
02:26:32,261 --> 02:26:32,941
Hey Brandon,

5598
02:26:32,941 --> 02:26:33,581
you keep it down.

5599
02:26:33,581 --> 02:26:33,851
All right.

5600
02:26:33,851 --> 02:26:34,684
That's the benefit of,

5601
02:26:35,310 --> 02:26:36,010
Oh,

5602
02:26:36,010 --> 02:26:36,760
here we are.

5603
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:37,251
Here we go.

5604
02:26:37,251 --> 02:26:39,190
Hobos and the clinch rough.

5605
02:26:39,250 --> 02:26:40,083
Oh please.

5606
02:26:40,330 --> 02:26:41,710
Rory tries to get you back,

5607
02:26:41,711 --> 02:26:42,220
man.

5608
02:26:42,220 --> 02:26:43,031
When you hit Rory,

5609
02:26:43,031 --> 02:26:44,950
even if you hit him with
that front lake side cat,

5610
02:26:45,010 --> 02:26:45,801
he gets back.

5611
02:26:45,801 --> 02:26:47,200
We'll serve gets boy listen,

5612
02:26:47,201 --> 02:26:51,380
he's fucking Canadian banks
as a bad motherfucker.

5613
02:26:51,490 --> 02:26:56,490
This kid that maple syrup gets
boiling about fucking talking about.

5614
02:26:57,160 --> 02:27:00,340
You know what's interesting when you
see a kid like worry or you see someone

5615
02:27:00,341 --> 02:27:05,170
like my shop says you're
the first frame shop.

5616
02:27:05,170 --> 02:27:06,003
Cracks me up.

5617
02:27:06,490 --> 02:27:07,060
He'll say some.

5618
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:09,170
You know what's interesting about
both of these guys isn't it?

5619
02:27:09,171 --> 02:27:12,460
They're going to get better is if they
don't get physically injured in his fight

5620
02:27:12,461 --> 02:27:15,280
to the point where it incapacitates
them and stop their training.

5621
02:27:15,490 --> 02:27:17,290
These guys are going to get
better because this fight,

5622
02:27:17,291 --> 02:27:18,790
because they're in that prime period.

5623
02:27:19,210 --> 02:27:20,260
Roy has to get going.

5624
02:27:20,470 --> 02:27:24,490
What you're looking at right here is like
some of the best movement and striking

5625
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:26,290
in one 70 that you're going to find today.

5626
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:26,590
Yeah.

5627
02:27:26,590 --> 02:27:27,740
One verse two son.

5628
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:28,450
Yeah,

5629
02:27:28,450 --> 02:27:31,540
and as far as like MMA
striking like these guys are,

5630
02:27:31,541 --> 02:27:34,180
Goddamn is legitimate
guess elite of the elite.

5631
02:27:34,210 --> 02:27:34,760
There'll be a leader.

5632
02:27:34,760 --> 02:27:35,650
The echelon,

5633
02:27:35,651 --> 02:27:38,890
you'll get the 1% there's 1% right
now and that's what we get any better.

5634
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:41,350
That's what's fascinating to like
standing on the outside watching that.

5635
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:42,071
I'm watching that.

5636
02:27:42,071 --> 02:27:42,490
I'm going,

5637
02:27:42,490 --> 02:27:43,510
these guys are gonna get better.

5638
02:27:43,511 --> 02:27:45,130
It's a chess match for Roy.

5639
02:27:45,131 --> 02:27:46,780
I'm a little scared if he loses this one.

5640
02:27:46,930 --> 02:27:47,950
It's a little tough.

5641
02:27:48,130 --> 02:27:51,940
What is the fighter of
2025 going to look like?

5642
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:54,430
I mean how good the matrix.

5643
02:27:54,460 --> 02:27:55,510
Oh God damn good.

5644
02:27:55,511 --> 02:27:59,040
Are these like the Matrix
break dancer slash I don't know

5645
02:28:02,020 --> 02:28:03,160
karate skills.

5646
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:04,750
It might hit saturation point.

5647
02:28:04,751 --> 02:28:09,220
Look at boxing my boxes from
the 19 hundreds to his dive son.

5648
02:28:09,310 --> 02:28:10,001
Danger,

5649
02:28:10,001 --> 02:28:11,680
danger will Robinson.

5650
02:28:13,890 --> 02:28:16,660
And how about Thompson
with a slick getaway?

5651
02:28:16,661 --> 02:28:17,494
Like not

5652
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:20,920
professional defense,

5653
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:21,180
right?

5654
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:22,400
You don't have to standard

5655
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:24,660
pros and that's his buddy Raymond.

5656
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:28,220
He said get off and
sun dance stream other.

5657
02:28:28,221 --> 02:28:28,941
Look at that corner.

5658
02:28:28,941 --> 02:28:30,320
Raymond Daniels for us.

5659
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:31,030
What?

5660
02:28:31,030 --> 02:28:32,040
What is Raymond Daniels?

5661
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:36,200
Roddy champion champion
also ignites the glory.

5662
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:37,450
You have to acknowledge me.

5663
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:39,140
I can't believe you don't know who he is.

5664
02:28:39,170 --> 02:28:40,970
Who makes good tick off like a chimpanzee.

5665
02:28:40,971 --> 02:28:41,630
If you guys,

5666
02:28:41,630 --> 02:28:42,890
it makes my asshole,

5667
02:28:43,190 --> 02:28:44,730
my Dick went narrow one guy.

5668
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:46,650
Sorry cause I was running hard for this.

5669
02:28:47,770 --> 02:28:49,580
I clenched step like say please God.

5670
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:52,370
Let me not have heard that curry.

5671
02:28:53,180 --> 02:28:54,260
Who's running with dance?

5672
02:28:54,261 --> 02:28:55,400
My fucking heart hurts.

5673
02:28:55,540 --> 02:28:59,240
He says top one of the top
kickbox walks in the world.

5674
02:28:59,241 --> 02:29:00,074
I know,

5675
02:29:00,490 --> 02:29:00,921
there you go.

5676
02:29:00,921 --> 02:29:01,850
I can know what he is.

5677
02:29:02,260 --> 02:29:02,901
And he was asking,

5678
02:29:02,901 --> 02:29:04,400
you guys need skin.

5679
02:29:04,420 --> 02:29:06,280
Nikki holds skin and um,

5680
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:07,543
who?

5681
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:08,511
Joseph,

5682
02:29:08,511 --> 02:29:09,310
What's his last name?

5683
02:29:09,310 --> 02:29:09,640
Thoughts.

5684
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:09,840
Laney.

5685
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:11,900
You Fuck fucking false fossil.

5686
02:29:12,090 --> 02:29:13,660
It goes to the only guys
that beat and I'm like,

5687
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:14,800
I had to beat him and uh,

5688
02:29:15,010 --> 02:29:16,510
if they both feed them the same way,

5689
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:18,130
remember that boy ty.

5690
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:18,540
Hi.

5691
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:21,010
Hi Guard leg kicks.

5692
02:29:23,790 --> 02:29:25,440
Thompson's not dawn or not.

5693
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:28,940
There's a lot of pro wrestling
fans like there's sure shoot.

5694
02:29:28,941 --> 02:29:29,774
I saw

5695
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:35,940
telling him shut up and
let Joe and Brendan Talk.

5696
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:39,450
You will never get to fight for
the title cause I have a pen.

5697
02:29:43,170 --> 02:29:44,003
Oh,

5698
02:29:44,110 --> 02:29:45,320
little sneaky need of the body.

5699
02:29:46,990 --> 02:29:48,000
Feel credit.

5700
02:29:48,010 --> 02:29:48,890
Need to take a break.

5701
02:29:49,430 --> 02:29:53,620
Well I always feel like Rory brings
a queasiness either guy here.

5702
02:29:54,250 --> 02:29:58,340
I don't want either go to lose
worries at terrifying individual.

5703
02:29:58,350 --> 02:29:59,350
But Wonderboy,

5704
02:29:59,390 --> 02:30:01,910
he so fucking whip smart.

5705
02:30:01,970 --> 02:30:02,803
There's more pressure.

5706
02:30:02,810 --> 02:30:03,560
Sharp.

5707
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:06,020
There's just a lot of pressure
on Roy man face of Canada.

5708
02:30:06,110 --> 02:30:07,490
He's going to free agency.

5709
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:11,150
Wonderboy is going to be fine even though
he's 33 and I don't think that affects

5710
02:30:11,151 --> 02:30:12,170
Rory at the same way.

5711
02:30:12,171 --> 02:30:13,430
It affects a regular person.

5712
02:30:13,431 --> 02:30:14,180
I disagree.

5713
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:15,440
I think he fights harder.

5714
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:17,990
That Robbie Lawler
fight was goddamn chaos.

5715
02:30:17,991 --> 02:30:20,930
I rewatched that best fight
of the fucking century.

5716
02:30:21,650 --> 02:30:22,221
Oh much shit.

5717
02:30:22,221 --> 02:30:23,540
I rewatched that today.

5718
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:24,480
It's amazing.

5719
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:27,780
I can't even tell high am
time dressing all the fuck.

5720
02:30:27,781 --> 02:30:29,970
I'm talking to him that we watched.

5721
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:31,250
By the way,

5722
02:30:31,250 --> 02:30:35,870
I was going through my DVR because I was
running out of space and I came across,

5723
02:30:35,871 --> 02:30:36,260
uh,

5724
02:30:36,260 --> 02:30:36,980
this fight,

5725
02:30:36,980 --> 02:30:39,950
the pluck the Rory Macdonald,

5726
02:30:39,951 --> 02:30:40,784
Robbie Lawler fight,

5727
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:41,780
and I had to watch it.

5728
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:42,740
A little bit of it again.

5729
02:30:42,741 --> 02:30:44,100
It was just like Jesus Christ.

5730
02:30:44,130 --> 02:30:45,820
How he told me when he got hit,

5731
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:47,720
it went white.

5732
02:30:47,780 --> 02:30:48,740
It just all went white.

5733
02:30:48,741 --> 02:30:49,490
He couldn't see.

5734
02:30:49,490 --> 02:30:50,720
So he just had to sit down.

5735
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:53,440
Terrible fight was chaos.

5736
02:30:54,290 --> 02:30:54,740
He goes,

5737
02:30:54,740 --> 02:30:55,011
he goes,

5738
02:30:55,011 --> 02:30:56,360
my nose was jamming into,

5739
02:30:57,460 --> 02:30:58,980
it felt like it was
jamming in my eye sockets.

5740
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,480
She's moving just,

5741
02:31:00,520 --> 02:31:00,810
Oh,

5742
02:31:00,810 --> 02:31:03,140
just the right amount
away from wonder boys.

5743
02:31:03,150 --> 02:31:04,280
He's so calculated.

5744
02:31:04,281 --> 02:31:05,660
It's really interesting.

5745
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:10,820
And he's the first guy to give Wonderboy
like real problems with his timing.

5746
02:31:11,270 --> 02:31:11,421
Yeah.

5747
02:31:11,421 --> 02:31:12,231
Cause Matt Brown said,

5748
02:31:12,231 --> 02:31:14,720
I don't give a fuck I've been
dead and just walk through it.

5749
02:31:14,750 --> 02:31:17,450
Well maybe it was a
different Wonderboy too.

5750
02:31:17,451 --> 02:31:21,180
Obviously wonder boys gotten better at
stuff and take downs and training with

5751
02:31:21,181 --> 02:31:22,014
wrestlers.

5752
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:24,450
Matt Brown still got hit and
she just walked through it.

5753
02:31:24,480 --> 02:31:25,810
Roy's not getting really hit.

5754
02:31:25,811 --> 02:31:26,960
He stayed true that outside.

5755
02:31:26,990 --> 02:31:27,190
Yeah.

5756
02:31:27,190 --> 02:31:28,060
No longer at work.

5757
02:31:28,110 --> 02:31:29,010
Unquestionably man.

5758
02:31:29,570 --> 02:31:31,740
And glories threatening him everywhere.

5759
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:32,310
He's,

5760
02:31:32,310 --> 02:31:33,210
he does something different.

5761
02:31:33,211 --> 02:31:35,370
Every fight to Rory comes
up with a new bag of tricks.

5762
02:31:35,400 --> 02:31:36,120
Every fight.

5763
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:36,960
Well he does that.

5764
02:31:36,961 --> 02:31:37,650
Wow.

5765
02:31:37,650 --> 02:31:39,680
That front leg side kick is legit son.

5766
02:31:39,730 --> 02:31:40,040
Yeah,

5767
02:31:40,040 --> 02:31:40,590
they slot.

5768
02:31:40,590 --> 02:31:43,590
If Rory can like slide back with it,

5769
02:31:43,591 --> 02:31:47,190
if he sees the leg come up and
he lets his body go with it,

5770
02:31:47,430 --> 02:31:48,960
it's not as bad.

5771
02:31:48,961 --> 02:31:50,010
The serious weapon,

5772
02:31:50,011 --> 02:31:50,844
right.

5773
02:31:51,080 --> 02:31:53,100
God Damn Fun Foot High Egg.

5774
02:31:53,350 --> 02:31:53,880
That's the,

5775
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:54,340
that's a,

5776
02:31:54,340 --> 02:31:56,160
the benefits of leaving
your leg out there.

5777
02:31:56,190 --> 02:31:59,850
Do you remember us talking
about this like 10 15 years ago?

5778
02:32:00,090 --> 02:32:00,631
Oh good.

5779
02:32:00,631 --> 02:32:01,590
That's a great shot.

5780
02:32:01,710 --> 02:32:03,600
Members talking about those karate guys.

5781
02:32:03,610 --> 02:32:03,871
I'm like,

5782
02:32:03,871 --> 02:32:04,810
they're coming man.

5783
02:32:04,811 --> 02:32:07,980
And Roy can wrestle guys that
can throw these fucking kicks.

5784
02:32:07,981 --> 02:32:08,730
I've seen them.

5785
02:32:08,730 --> 02:32:09,590
I've seen these gangs.

5786
02:32:09,591 --> 02:32:10,424
Right elbow.

5787
02:32:10,830 --> 02:32:12,360
They're going to learn
how to do everything else.

5788
02:32:12,400 --> 02:32:13,620
Sure Dude,

5789
02:32:13,621 --> 02:32:16,550
Wonderboy and I owe to,

5790
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:18,480
the buys is blocking it though.

5791
02:32:18,540 --> 02:32:19,710
But the shots,

5792
02:32:19,711 --> 02:32:21,420
the body suck that up.

5793
02:32:22,460 --> 02:32:27,350
It's like a investing and it
pays off in the frown fight man.

5794
02:32:27,351 --> 02:32:28,184
It's a long fight.

5795
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:31,200
Oh that didn't go more.

5796
02:32:31,201 --> 02:32:32,550
This fight goes on.

5797
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,360
The more those body shots
are going to mean something.

5798
02:32:35,361 --> 02:32:35,670
Dude,

5799
02:32:35,670 --> 02:32:38,760
I've made want to buy and multiple
cards cause we had the same manager.

5800
02:32:38,761 --> 02:32:41,640
So that's the way sometimes
it lines up and wonder.

5801
02:32:41,641 --> 02:32:44,770
Boy's dad trains him and he'd be in
the back crying and I'm like this guy's

5802
02:32:44,790 --> 02:32:45,720
about to get his ass whooped.

5803
02:32:45,780 --> 02:32:50,730
And he'd go out there and starched
dude's fucking starched dose.

5804
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:52,010
Cause whenever I see a guy crime,

5805
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:53,280
like you're fucked bro.

5806
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:55,860
He'd go out there and fuck dudes up.

5807
02:32:55,950 --> 02:32:56,101
Yeah,

5808
02:32:56,101 --> 02:32:56,880
he can handle it.

5809
02:32:56,880 --> 02:32:57,960
He just going through it,

5810
02:32:58,030 --> 02:33:00,300
gets it out of system and it
goes out there and perform.

5811
02:33:00,330 --> 02:33:02,730
So I feel like a man.

5812
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:03,600
I feel like crying.

5813
02:33:03,660 --> 02:33:08,370
How often to guys quit from leg kicks
to the arms like very other fighters.

5814
02:33:08,371 --> 02:33:08,791
They're just like,

5815
02:33:08,791 --> 02:33:09,331
fuck that.

5816
02:33:09,331 --> 02:33:09,750
I'm done.

5817
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:10,370
What's his name?

5818
02:33:10,370 --> 02:33:12,720
Had that guy quite well.

5819
02:33:12,721 --> 02:33:14,820
Frank shamrock with Kang Lee recently.

5820
02:33:14,821 --> 02:33:15,641
What was his name to go?

5821
02:33:15,641 --> 02:33:17,080
Got Arm barred by Jacques Hurray.

5822
02:33:17,610 --> 02:33:18,650
Who just fought recently?

5823
02:33:18,990 --> 02:33:19,230
Yeah,

5824
02:33:19,230 --> 02:33:19,611
he,

5825
02:33:19,611 --> 02:33:19,780
he,

5826
02:33:19,780 --> 02:33:21,430
he was his knees broke down.

5827
02:33:22,250 --> 02:33:26,490
He did it to other people out
there that quit from leg kicks APP.

5828
02:33:26,550 --> 02:33:28,100
There's some fire kicks.

5829
02:33:28,110 --> 02:33:28,700
Remember?

5830
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:33,060
Remember it more one of
the arms or legs or bands?

5831
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:33,480
Man,

5832
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:34,550
it really depends dude.

5833
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:36,450
Remember when it's on the arm too.

5834
02:33:36,570 --> 02:33:38,790
Like if you kick someone here,

5835
02:33:39,320 --> 02:33:40,111
like right here,

5836
02:33:40,111 --> 02:33:44,010
it's significantly easier for you to
absorb than if you get kicked here.

5837
02:33:44,280 --> 02:33:44,550
Dude,

5838
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:44,890
who's,

5839
02:33:44,890 --> 02:33:45,541
who's homeboy?

5840
02:33:45,541 --> 02:33:47,850
The Dutch kickboxer and spot in the UFC.

5841
02:33:47,851 --> 02:33:48,601
Did I make sense with that?

5842
02:33:48,601 --> 02:33:49,050
No idea.

5843
02:33:49,050 --> 02:33:54,050
Anthony made a guy quit liking is here
to block a kick here than it is a block

5844
02:33:54,331 --> 02:33:54,511
kick.

5845
02:33:54,511 --> 02:33:54,930
Yes.

5846
02:33:54,930 --> 02:33:55,201
As you,

5847
02:33:55,201 --> 02:33:58,100
if you're blocking the kick higher
towards your hands and your arms,

5848
02:33:58,200 --> 02:33:59,490
your arm gets real weak.

5849
02:33:59,550 --> 02:34:01,140
I'll give you get kicked in the middle.

5850
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:02,160
Like up here,

5851
02:34:02,460 --> 02:34:05,280
he's probably going to get
your arm broken chains here.

5852
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:06,241
You might be okay.

5853
02:34:06,241 --> 02:34:09,330
The same kick here like might
hurt the other guy shin.

5854
02:34:09,740 --> 02:34:10,441
It's a difference.

5855
02:34:10,441 --> 02:34:12,450
A big difference between
catching an elbow,

5856
02:34:12,451 --> 02:34:13,860
like catching a shin,

5857
02:34:14,010 --> 02:34:16,090
but you still don't want it now.

5858
02:34:16,130 --> 02:34:16,963
Right?

5859
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:19,100
Want to,

5860
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:21,280
you can definitely break you guys foot.

5861
02:34:21,310 --> 02:34:22,240
Like if a guy throws,

5862
02:34:22,390 --> 02:34:24,100
see one of the things about wonder boys,

5863
02:34:24,101 --> 02:34:25,720
he throws in step kicks,

5864
02:34:25,721 --> 02:34:29,050
which is really interesting
because his distance is way better.

5865
02:34:29,620 --> 02:34:32,590
It's might not be like the
best thing for leg kicks,

5866
02:34:32,591 --> 02:34:33,221
like leg kicks.

5867
02:34:33,221 --> 02:34:34,160
You want to use shit.

5868
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:39,200
That's why with the leg kicks you wanna
you shinbones but with he can throw in

5869
02:34:39,281 --> 02:34:41,240
step kicks that are super powerful.

5870
02:34:41,530 --> 02:34:43,630
Him Traditional Thai kicks,

5871
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:44,351
he boy,

5872
02:34:44,351 --> 02:34:45,250
he does those two.

5873
02:34:45,251 --> 02:34:46,040
He didn't do those too.

5874
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:49,870
But what I'm saying is
there's a difference when a
guy's really good with the

5875
02:34:49,871 --> 02:34:54,520
instep that gives you almost an
extra foot of area where you,

5876
02:34:54,610 --> 02:34:59,490
where you're impacting except a lot of
the really good Dutch kickboxers like an

5877
02:34:59,491 --> 02:34:59,801
airshow.

5878
02:34:59,801 --> 02:35:02,680
Hoost he would wrap that foot
around the back of your head.

5879
02:35:02,950 --> 02:35:06,190
Who would blam so he would
really tuck you into like,

5880
02:35:06,610 --> 02:35:08,470
like when you like flex your foot,

5881
02:35:08,471 --> 02:35:12,420
he would tuck you to sleep right in
there cause it hit the back back,

5882
02:35:12,620 --> 02:35:12,940
back,

5883
02:35:12,940 --> 02:35:13,150
back.

5884
02:35:13,150 --> 02:35:13,751
He'd Punch,

5885
02:35:13,751 --> 02:35:15,820
hit jab paunch and then just throw it,

5886
02:35:16,120 --> 02:35:19,530
throw it over the top of
your shoulder and chop.

5887
02:35:19,531 --> 02:35:20,321
How tall is he?

5888
02:35:20,321 --> 02:35:20,651
Six.

5889
02:35:20,651 --> 02:35:21,484
Four at least.

5890
02:35:22,150 --> 02:35:23,920
He's a very tall man and I met up a bunch.

5891
02:35:23,921 --> 02:35:24,041
That's,

5892
02:35:24,041 --> 02:35:25,090
it's a very nice guy too.

5893
02:35:25,091 --> 02:35:26,260
And so skillful.

5894
02:35:26,261 --> 02:35:27,410
What a great kick boxer.

5895
02:35:27,411 --> 02:35:28,244
He was

5896
02:35:29,620 --> 02:35:30,453
right hand.

5897
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:34,900
But what I'm saying is like Wonderboy
offers like a lot of weird shit that if

5898
02:35:34,901 --> 02:35:35,950
you don't prepare for him,

5899
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:37,840
which Roy clearly did bring it in.

5900
02:35:37,841 --> 02:35:38,680
Raymond Daniels,

5901
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:42,150
he could be a real problem to you
because his distance is so much good.

5902
02:35:42,190 --> 02:35:42,971
More hooked by then.

5903
02:35:42,971 --> 02:35:43,930
You think it should be?

5904
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:44,793
Yeah.

5905
02:35:45,620 --> 02:35:46,810
Oh Man.

5906
02:35:46,811 --> 02:35:47,740
Closing that distance really?

5907
02:35:47,741 --> 02:35:49,080
Well God want to push it away.

5908
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:51,220
Fuck cancer's back with speed.

5909
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:52,150
He said he does what?

5910
02:35:52,151 --> 02:35:55,450
Look were Maury sheet
moving very well here.

5911
02:35:55,451 --> 02:35:55,810
But,

5912
02:35:55,810 --> 02:35:58,990
but the thing about Wonderboy
is you've got a mind.

5913
02:35:59,050 --> 02:35:59,351
Oh,

5914
02:35:59,351 --> 02:36:00,400
your p's and q's.

5915
02:36:00,401 --> 02:36:04,780
You get a fucking dot your i's and cross
25 minutes just like medical j white.

5916
02:36:04,820 --> 02:36:05,980
You're writing for 25 minutes.

5917
02:36:05,990 --> 02:36:06,823
Are you going to sleep?

5918
02:36:09,650 --> 02:36:14,650
I'm just saying [inaudible]
Smith Smith's slash why?

5919
02:36:17,560 --> 02:36:19,210
When you watch your fucking p's and q's,

5920
02:36:19,290 --> 02:36:20,123
bro.

5921
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:20,770
Hey,

5922
02:36:20,770 --> 02:36:24,370
buy him a drink and thank him for his
work and shop to lock up the spawn.

5923
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:26,930
It ends this beautiful kickback.

5924
02:36:26,980 --> 02:36:27,781
Don't get fraud.

5925
02:36:27,781 --> 02:36:28,614
Wonderboy.

5926
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:30,490
Wonderboy just miss changed to wonder,

5927
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:31,220
man.

5928
02:36:31,220 --> 02:36:31,780
Oh,

5929
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:32,680
how many times something,

5930
02:36:32,681 --> 02:36:32,861
man,

5931
02:36:32,861 --> 02:36:36,280
I'm so impressed with the controlling
of distance by Roy as well.

5932
02:36:36,281 --> 02:36:38,750
You should weigh uses that high left hand,

5933
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:39,201
that guard.

5934
02:36:39,201 --> 02:36:40,090
Look how he does this.

5935
02:36:40,210 --> 02:36:43,420
He like leans forward with his arms
straight up in the air on the left side,

5936
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,400
and that's something he
used against Tyron Woodley.

5937
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:47,560
He shutdown Woodley's right hand.

5938
02:36:47,620 --> 02:36:47,711
Well,

5939
02:36:47,711 --> 02:36:48,510
he just jumped.

5940
02:36:48,510 --> 02:36:49,343
He just jumped.

5941
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:51,970
He just jumped a half dog.

5942
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:54,273
He's looking for that.

5943
02:36:54,550 --> 02:36:55,720
They're just going right to the legs.

5944
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:59,380
He's got a ride if he Sweetser and
gets on top of this to be brilliant.

5945
02:36:59,890 --> 02:37:00,790
Oh my goodness.

5946
02:37:00,791 --> 02:37:01,420
It's gone after.

5947
02:37:01,420 --> 02:37:02,050
Oh my goodness.

5948
02:37:02,050 --> 02:37:02,980
Hammer fist.

5949
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:03,970
Look at this shit.

5950
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:05,320
Oh my goodness.

5951
02:37:05,350 --> 02:37:07,660
Who's lippy gentlemen?

5952
02:37:08,080 --> 02:37:09,640
We have a very even fight here.

5953
02:37:09,641 --> 02:37:10,060
Racy,

5954
02:37:10,060 --> 02:37:11,650
but gets right back up to his feet.

5955
02:37:11,730 --> 02:37:12,563
Yep.

5956
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:14,680
Wonderboy slick as fuck.

5957
02:37:14,681 --> 02:37:15,990
Beautiful fucking technique

5958
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:16,843
by Wonderboy,

5959
02:37:17,100 --> 02:37:17,390
right?

5960
02:37:17,390 --> 02:37:19,520
Hey wanna fucking chess match,

5961
02:37:19,960 --> 02:37:20,793
man.

5962
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:24,450
This is no different than Steph
curry versus Lebron James.

5963
02:37:24,460 --> 02:37:25,430
It's just brilliant.

5964
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:28,430
That left hand Wonderboy
just landed moving away.

5965
02:37:28,431 --> 02:37:29,270
Very slick.

5966
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:30,773
Dammit.

5967
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:33,260
You don't wonder why
fights to total hands down,

5968
02:37:33,261 --> 02:37:33,591
man.

5969
02:37:33,591 --> 02:37:34,140
It's fine.

5970
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:35,150
Total hands down.

5971
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:37,890
Total hands down in these punches
are coming up from the hips.

5972
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:38,753
Look at us.

5973
02:37:39,130 --> 02:37:42,170
You got to Mexico and
he will blitzkrieg on.

5974
02:37:42,171 --> 02:37:43,004
Dude,

5975
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:43,940
it's not landing.

5976
02:37:43,941 --> 02:37:44,660
Notice it.

5977
02:37:44,660 --> 02:37:47,720
But Roy is doing a great
job minimizing the damage.

5978
02:37:47,820 --> 02:37:49,580
Great shop and constant pressure.

5979
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:50,630
So again,

5980
02:37:50,631 --> 02:37:51,061
wonderful.

5981
02:37:51,061 --> 02:37:51,920
As we were saying before,

5982
02:37:51,921 --> 02:37:53,300
he's got to move back more,

5983
02:37:53,540 --> 02:37:54,650
causes more.

5984
02:37:54,890 --> 02:37:56,360
It's a little bit less natural.

5985
02:37:56,390 --> 02:37:57,980
The moving back and jumping in.

5986
02:37:58,220 --> 02:37:59,810
Whereas Rory Rory,

5987
02:37:59,811 --> 02:38:01,340
he's just started plotting forward.

5988
02:38:01,490 --> 02:38:03,140
Just keeping the distance with that long,

5989
02:38:03,141 --> 02:38:06,110
straight left hand and threatening
every time they engage.

5990
02:38:06,770 --> 02:38:07,101
Hey,

5991
02:38:07,101 --> 02:38:11,350
good luck judging this fight down.

5992
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:12,433
Oh Gosh.

5993
02:38:12,980 --> 02:38:13,813
Jamie.

5994
02:38:14,270 --> 02:38:16,590
Jamie is the man and he sent me

5995
02:38:21,970 --> 02:38:23,260
sweet baby.

5996
02:38:23,380 --> 02:38:24,213
Fuck you.

5997
02:38:24,590 --> 02:38:25,560
Fuck you somebody.

5998
02:38:25,580 --> 02:38:26,031
Fuck you.

5999
02:38:26,031 --> 02:38:26,810
Track TV.

6000
02:38:26,810 --> 02:38:27,291
Fuck you.

6001
02:38:27,291 --> 02:38:28,124
America.

6002
02:38:28,140 --> 02:38:29,640
Who's the Donald Trump who did this?

6003
02:38:30,580 --> 02:38:31,413
Ted Cruz.

6004
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:33,193
Fuck you.

6005
02:38:33,210 --> 02:38:34,070
Fuck everybody.

6006
02:38:34,190 --> 02:38:35,220
They finally got those.

6007
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:37,490
Wow.

6008
02:38:37,490 --> 02:38:38,450
Oh the,

6009
02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:40,490
Oh yeah.

6010
02:38:40,490 --> 02:38:41,510
Come on God.

6011
02:38:41,511 --> 02:38:42,640
Good luck judging this fight.

6012
02:38:42,890 --> 02:38:43,850
God mastery.

6013
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:45,110
It's mastery.

6014
02:38:46,910 --> 02:38:47,990
This is an interesting man.

6015
02:38:48,170 --> 02:38:48,650
Oh,

6016
02:38:48,650 --> 02:38:50,780
that's a bit of someone's
gonna land something major.

6017
02:38:51,350 --> 02:38:51,921
Maybe not,

6018
02:38:51,921 --> 02:38:52,370
man.

6019
02:38:52,370 --> 02:38:55,400
This could be a a five round it fair.

6020
02:38:55,401 --> 02:38:57,200
That's very similar to what
we're seeing right now.

6021
02:38:57,470 --> 02:38:59,240
If both guys keep their fitness,

6022
02:38:59,330 --> 02:39:03,530
they're going to realize is an imminent
threat and any kind of like any opening

6023
02:39:03,650 --> 02:39:04,730
and he'd taken chances.

6024
02:39:04,760 --> 02:39:07,580
Roy's going to have to grapple
to test the fitness at Thompson.

6025
02:39:07,610 --> 02:39:08,730
He's comfortable.

6026
02:39:09,410 --> 02:39:10,460
He's been trying to really,

6027
02:39:10,490 --> 02:39:11,810
not really that fucking,

6028
02:39:12,050 --> 02:39:13,690
that right hand and he's
putting in front of his film.

6029
02:39:13,690 --> 02:39:14,300
My very,

6030
02:39:14,300 --> 02:39:14,720
very,

6031
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:15,530
very nice.

6032
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:16,940
I got wonder boy at this point.

6033
02:39:17,510 --> 02:39:17,721
Well,

6034
02:39:17,721 --> 02:39:18,830
both guys look really good,

6035
02:39:18,860 --> 02:39:19,071
dude.

6036
02:39:19,071 --> 02:39:20,450
This is a tough fight to jug.

6037
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:21,313
Absolutely.

6038
02:39:22,130 --> 02:39:23,600
Who the fuck fights like wonder boy man,

6039
02:39:23,601 --> 02:39:25,100
look at this guy switching stances.

6040
02:39:25,130 --> 02:39:26,330
Hands down low.

6041
02:39:26,390 --> 02:39:27,223
I feel like he's,

6042
02:39:27,290 --> 02:39:28,790
he's sitting in his
house though right now.

6043
02:39:28,791 --> 02:39:29,331
You know what I'm saying?

6044
02:39:29,331 --> 02:39:30,500
Like you're not going to get tired.

6045
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:31,820
He could do this for 10 rounds.

6046
02:39:31,821 --> 02:39:32,170
Yeah.

6047
02:39:32,170 --> 02:39:32,570
Don't worry.

6048
02:39:32,570 --> 02:39:33,980
Has to force a grappling.

6049
02:39:34,250 --> 02:39:34,491
Well,

6050
02:39:34,491 --> 02:39:38,450
if he starts to feel like Rory slowing
down a little bit and he can relax,

6051
02:39:38,451 --> 02:39:39,620
he can do more of this shit.

6052
02:39:40,050 --> 02:39:42,100
This just chill man.

6053
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:43,520
God linking with sandstone.

6054
02:39:43,530 --> 02:39:43,810
All right,

6055
02:39:43,810 --> 02:39:44,330
and you're making,

6056
02:39:44,330 --> 02:39:46,640
you should like open up one
of those psychic places.

6057
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:50,270
I'm telling you how to feeling,

6058
02:39:50,271 --> 02:39:50,720
Bro.

6059
02:39:50,720 --> 02:39:51,680
I had a feeling.

6060
02:39:51,681 --> 02:39:52,514
I'm telling you,

6061
02:39:52,910 --> 02:39:53,810
I had a feeling.

6062
02:39:53,811 --> 02:39:56,750
I'm telling you it's
going to win this fight.

6063
02:39:56,751 --> 02:39:57,610
He's going to win this fight.

6064
02:39:57,611 --> 02:39:59,890
You know the odds are I know,

6065
02:39:59,900 --> 02:40:00,733
but I just do.

6066
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:03,020
I have an overwhelming feeling
that he's going to win.

6067
02:40:03,021 --> 02:40:05,810
And you and a shitload other people.

6068
02:40:05,811 --> 02:40:07,010
You're a crazy person.

6069
02:40:07,011 --> 02:40:08,600
Mama cleaned up for the fight.

6070
02:40:08,730 --> 02:40:11,300
I'll tell up people did not
the way I did it though.

6071
02:40:11,301 --> 02:40:12,290
And that was my conviction.

6072
02:40:12,570 --> 02:40:13,381
New crazy person.

6073
02:40:13,381 --> 02:40:13,680
Brian,

6074
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:15,210
I don't know how you're going to judge us.

6075
02:40:15,211 --> 02:40:15,990
Fire crazy.

6076
02:40:15,990 --> 02:40:18,570
You can say Roy's winning
cause the octagon control.

6077
02:40:19,020 --> 02:40:19,853
I don't know.

6078
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:20,191
Listen,

6079
02:40:20,191 --> 02:40:21,720
this is an office also in Canada.

6080
02:40:21,721 --> 02:40:22,170
You,

6081
02:40:22,170 --> 02:40:22,681
I don't care.

6082
02:40:22,681 --> 02:40:23,514
They're fuckers.

6083
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:24,090
Seriously.

6084
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:27,930
This is a fucking awesome fight is an
interesting fight and this is on chess.

6085
02:40:27,931 --> 02:40:29,730
Match is a super high level,

6086
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:33,120
a fair between that two of the
most dangerous guys on the planet,

6087
02:40:33,121 --> 02:40:35,160
Gaia and Royce Corner
looks like Roy in 20 years.

6088
02:40:36,450 --> 02:40:37,410
They looked very similar.

6089
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:39,120
The same,

6090
02:40:39,150 --> 02:40:41,380
same oblong face could be his brother.

6091
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:41,760
Yeah.

6092
02:40:41,760 --> 02:40:42,361
It might be his dad.

6093
02:40:42,361 --> 02:40:43,320
His Dad speaks trainer,

6094
02:40:43,770 --> 02:40:44,620
Wonderboy Thompson,

6095
02:40:44,750 --> 02:40:45,241
Cutie Pie.

6096
02:40:45,241 --> 02:40:45,571
By the way,

6097
02:40:45,571 --> 02:40:46,620
if you're talking about like top,

6098
02:40:46,621 --> 02:40:48,510
don't lie no more that
we can't do that anymore.

6099
02:40:50,030 --> 02:40:50,730
Yeah,

6100
02:40:50,730 --> 02:40:51,570
just to match.

6101
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:52,380
They get mad.

6102
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:54,050
Too much gay stuff that's not gay.

6103
02:40:54,150 --> 02:40:54,983
I'm just saying.

6104
02:40:55,590 --> 02:40:57,090
I understand you're
trying to get auditions.

6105
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:57,990
If you were looking at,

6106
02:40:58,260 --> 02:41:01,380
if you were aesthetically looking at
fighters and you had to choose models,

6107
02:41:01,381 --> 02:41:02,490
he'd be in your top five.

6108
02:41:02,491 --> 02:41:03,360
Fuck you.

6109
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:03,990
Boy.

6110
02:41:03,990 --> 02:41:05,010
I don't want to do this anymore.

6111
02:41:05,580 --> 02:41:07,580
We've been on Alan Jobe and number line.

6112
02:41:07,790 --> 02:41:08,160
Yeah,

6113
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:09,570
and one divorce in the top five.

6114
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:10,230
No,

6115
02:41:10,230 --> 02:41:11,520
this makes me wonder,

6116
02:41:11,521 --> 02:41:11,821
man.

6117
02:41:11,821 --> 02:41:16,821
He's 33 there's no 33
there's been natural.

6118
02:41:18,150 --> 02:41:18,691
Robert Redford?

6119
02:41:18,691 --> 02:41:19,340
Yes.

6120
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:19,650
No,

6121
02:41:19,650 --> 02:41:20,311
it has Wonderboy.

6122
02:41:20,311 --> 02:41:21,330
That's where the name came from.

6123
02:41:21,560 --> 02:41:22,221
It has to be wonder,

6124
02:41:22,221 --> 02:41:22,531
man.

6125
02:41:22,531 --> 02:41:23,130
He's three.

6126
02:41:23,130 --> 02:41:23,281
No,

6127
02:41:23,281 --> 02:41:23,431
no,

6128
02:41:23,431 --> 02:41:23,581
no,

6129
02:41:23,581 --> 02:41:23,701
no.

6130
02:41:23,701 --> 02:41:25,200
Robert Redford was like 50 came back.

6131
02:41:25,201 --> 02:41:25,741
If I'm the kid,

6132
02:41:25,741 --> 02:41:26,320
he's a boy.

6133
02:41:26,320 --> 02:41:27,260
Runs that's embarrassed.

6134
02:41:27,261 --> 02:41:28,094
You look great.

6135
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:28,971
It looks great.

6136
02:41:28,971 --> 02:41:29,761
Skin was a little loose,

6137
02:41:29,761 --> 02:41:31,480
but could bomb stretch.

6138
02:41:33,390 --> 02:41:34,050
Oh,

6139
02:41:34,050 --> 02:41:35,200
look at that one.

6140
02:41:35,440 --> 02:41:36,450
If I can catch,

6141
02:41:36,470 --> 02:41:38,130
he can catch it from every angle.

6142
02:41:38,850 --> 02:41:40,080
I like saying obvious things.

6143
02:41:40,110 --> 02:41:40,460
Oh,

6144
02:41:40,460 --> 02:41:41,293
sorry.

6145
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:44,593
Sidekicks.

6146
02:41:44,610 --> 02:41:45,001
You know what?

6147
02:41:45,001 --> 02:41:46,230
If I was a feminist writer,

6148
02:41:46,231 --> 02:41:47,370
I'd be really mad at that movie.

6149
02:41:47,371 --> 02:41:48,560
The natural plus.

6150
02:41:48,561 --> 02:41:49,680
I'm like evil woman,

6151
02:41:50,210 --> 02:41:53,460
and it just took away the genius
of some very masculine man.

6152
02:41:53,490 --> 02:41:54,241
How old is that?

6153
02:41:54,241 --> 02:41:54,630
Moves me.

6154
02:41:54,630 --> 02:41:55,590
Is Old as fuck.

6155
02:41:55,800 --> 02:41:56,400
So they did.

6156
02:41:56,400 --> 02:41:57,990
It wasn't even a photograph.

6157
02:41:58,190 --> 02:41:59,460
There's all just cartoons.

6158
02:42:01,290 --> 02:42:02,220
I have never heard of it.

6159
02:42:02,460 --> 02:42:02,731
Why?

6160
02:42:02,731 --> 02:42:04,050
It's a great movie with Brendan.

6161
02:42:04,110 --> 02:42:05,530
It's a really good mood and natural.

6162
02:42:05,610 --> 02:42:06,121
I'll check it out.

6163
02:42:06,121 --> 02:42:07,740
It's about baseball in the early days.

6164
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:08,000
Oh yeah.

6165
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:11,650
I'll check it out for black people figured
out how to play it until black people

6166
02:42:11,651 --> 02:42:12,590
are keeping it said hello.

6167
02:42:12,770 --> 02:42:14,580
How are you doing that
with a blind make money?

6168
02:42:14,640 --> 02:42:15,473
We have,

6169
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:17,970
let me see this way better genetics.

6170
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,830
Wait til they fucking
find out about hockey.

6171
02:42:19,831 --> 02:42:21,690
We're all fucked and we live on an island.

6172
02:42:21,691 --> 02:42:22,920
This is a crazy fun.

6173
02:42:22,920 --> 02:42:26,160
We play baseball better
than you and we're coming.

6174
02:42:26,490 --> 02:42:27,130
We're coming,

6175
02:42:27,130 --> 02:42:27,760
man.

6176
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:28,550
What the fuck?

6177
02:42:28,550 --> 02:42:29,730
You guys are fucked.

6178
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:31,560
Randy Johnson.

6179
02:42:31,561 --> 02:42:33,420
He's fucked you Steve Garvey.

6180
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:34,650
He had four arms.

6181
02:42:34,651 --> 02:42:36,630
It didn't even look like
they belonged on a person.

6182
02:42:36,940 --> 02:42:40,110
It's like who shaved down that
gorilla gave it a baseball bat.

6183
02:42:40,650 --> 02:42:41,820
This forearms.

6184
02:42:41,970 --> 02:42:43,510
It was almost like his forums.

6185
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:46,050
Like someone saw it off the last,

6186
02:42:46,350 --> 02:42:48,060
Reggie Jackson is five inches.

6187
02:42:48,061 --> 02:42:48,560
Really?

6188
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:49,770
He was so thick.

6189
02:42:49,771 --> 02:42:50,730
It was retarded.

6190
02:42:50,910 --> 02:42:51,361
Hey Brennan,

6191
02:42:51,361 --> 02:42:53,040
such as you grew up a baseball fan.

6192
02:42:53,090 --> 02:42:53,670
Yeah.

6193
02:42:53,670 --> 02:42:55,170
Did you ever play like charades?

6194
02:42:55,171 --> 02:42:56,460
Like guess who I am and he like,

6195
02:42:56,480 --> 02:42:56,740
yeah,

6196
02:42:56,740 --> 02:42:57,573
like a Guy

6197
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:01,030
Steve Garvey Garvey.

6198
02:43:01,050 --> 02:43:03,490
I still got some things
you'll never forget it.

6199
02:43:03,491 --> 02:43:04,324
It was like,

6200
02:43:05,330 --> 02:43:06,390
and people her live.

6201
02:43:06,860 --> 02:43:07,920
Brian Downing.

6202
02:43:08,020 --> 02:43:08,500
Brian,

6203
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:09,021
Brian down.

6204
02:43:09,021 --> 02:43:10,650
If from the angels a

6205
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,300
no,

6206
02:43:13,300 --> 02:43:14,740
I'm talking like Ryan Sandberg.

6207
02:43:15,220 --> 02:43:15,450
Oh,

6208
02:43:15,450 --> 02:43:20,450
we talked about is you look at
Wonderboy and catch him fight compasses.

6209
02:43:22,760 --> 02:43:23,321
Crazy.

6210
02:43:23,321 --> 02:43:24,154
The shark.

6211
02:43:24,190 --> 02:43:27,780
We just jumped the shark when Eddie
starts on baseball and fucking him,

6212
02:43:27,820 --> 02:43:30,070
he met Wonderboy just
landed a sled combination.

6213
02:43:30,071 --> 02:43:30,221
Yes,

6214
02:43:30,221 --> 02:43:31,054
he did.

6215
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:31,390
He's,

6216
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:32,200
he's,

6217
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:34,600
I think I started as baseball
thing and I apologize.

6218
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:35,201
No,

6219
02:43:35,201 --> 02:43:36,034
I dig it.

6220
02:43:36,930 --> 02:43:37,763
Look your Wonderboy,

6221
02:43:38,030 --> 02:43:38,650
Mr. Short,

6222
02:43:38,650 --> 02:43:42,370
shorter watch baseball takes
too long board about soccer.

6223
02:43:42,520 --> 02:43:43,780
I've been trying to watch soccer lately.

6224
02:43:45,610 --> 02:43:46,241
Soccer Fund,

6225
02:43:46,241 --> 02:43:46,540
right.

6226
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:48,550
Especially now with the Copa America Cup.

6227
02:43:49,690 --> 02:43:49,961
Yeah.

6228
02:43:49,961 --> 02:43:50,681
It's been interesting,

6229
02:43:50,681 --> 02:43:50,880
man.

6230
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:51,713
Americans,

6231
02:43:52,480 --> 02:43:55,330
I'm not really like trying
to do this by nationality.

6232
02:43:56,140 --> 02:43:57,160
You try to do this?

6233
02:43:57,210 --> 02:43:57,610
Nope.

6234
02:43:57,610 --> 02:43:57,880
Nope,

6235
02:43:57,880 --> 02:43:58,713
nope,

6236
02:43:59,310 --> 02:43:59,620
nope.

6237
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:04,210
I'll give up u s and this is the first
time ever in my life I've had a chance to

6238
02:44:04,211 --> 02:44:08,590
acknowledge athletes from other
countries as if the countries that,

6239
02:44:08,591 --> 02:44:09,370
uh,

6240
02:44:09,370 --> 02:44:11,400
we all enjoy watching performed.

6241
02:44:11,401 --> 02:44:11,770
They don't,

6242
02:44:11,770 --> 02:44:11,990
I,

6243
02:44:11,990 --> 02:44:13,630
I'm not a part of this competition.

6244
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:15,941
Sham American.

6245
02:44:15,941 --> 02:44:16,360
Joe,

6246
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:19,000
I'm enjoying watching you
cheer for Chris Weidman.

6247
02:44:19,070 --> 02:44:20,160
INSTRUC gray.

6248
02:44:20,590 --> 02:44:21,370
I would not.

6249
02:44:21,370 --> 02:44:21,651
I know.

6250
02:44:21,651 --> 02:44:22,420
I'm just kidding.

6251
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:23,253
Can't do it.

6252
02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:24,940
I don't allow myself job,

6253
02:44:25,270 --> 02:44:25,840
but it's,

6254
02:44:25,840 --> 02:44:26,673
I don't allow myself

6255
02:44:29,360 --> 02:44:30,193
like for whatever,

6256
02:44:30,220 --> 02:44:31,780
whether it's bullshit or you,

6257
02:44:31,781 --> 02:44:32,580
right.

6258
02:44:32,580 --> 02:44:33,910
It's like whatever.

6259
02:44:33,911 --> 02:44:35,270
Let's have a reason to unite.

6260
02:44:35,271 --> 02:44:35,740
Let's just,

6261
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:37,980
let's fucking start USAID Columbia.

6262
02:44:38,810 --> 02:44:39,221
Fuck you.

6263
02:44:39,221 --> 02:44:40,810
Columbia on this day.

6264
02:44:40,900 --> 02:44:41,770
Fucking Columbia,

6265
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:42,760
right?

6266
02:44:42,760 --> 02:44:43,001
Yeah.

6267
02:44:43,001 --> 02:44:43,834
There's nothing wrong with that,

6268
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:44,673
but agents,

6269
02:44:45,310 --> 02:44:46,143
there's nothing wrong with,

6270
02:44:46,210 --> 02:44:47,920
I have a USA Soccer Jersey and I,

6271
02:44:47,921 --> 02:44:49,750
where'd brow naked?

6272
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:54,640
Just a hard on soccer jerseys
for Elton John Sunglasses.

6273
02:44:55,380 --> 02:45:00,380
Blue Raccoon hat out of a real record
that he caught eating out of his garbage.

6274
02:45:00,620 --> 02:45:01,620
Killed it with a rock.

6275
02:45:02,510 --> 02:45:05,420
Wonder why is impossible it
tachy can't touch Wonderboy.

6276
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:06,100
The owner.

6277
02:45:06,100 --> 02:45:06,900
What am I talking about?

6278
02:45:06,900 --> 02:45:08,010
The any idea at all?

6279
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:08,541
Sorry Buddy.

6280
02:45:08,541 --> 02:45:09,430
I'm so into this fight.

6281
02:45:09,431 --> 02:45:10,264
I can't help it.

6282
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:12,370
Oh,

6283
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:13,233
good level.

6284
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:14,171
Good Jab.

6285
02:45:14,171 --> 02:45:15,190
By golly,

6286
02:45:15,630 --> 02:45:17,510
I heard tiger or something
from one of your,

6287
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:18,653
I know tigers.

6288
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:19,361
Don't worry about it,

6289
02:45:19,361 --> 02:45:19,560
bro.

6290
02:45:19,560 --> 02:45:20,700
I saying I love soccer.

6291
02:45:20,701 --> 02:45:22,710
We talking about Charlie
Sheen and I can't.

6292
02:45:23,560 --> 02:45:25,420
Now I'm watching this thing of beauty,

6293
02:45:25,450 --> 02:45:26,800
this poetry in motion,

6294
02:45:27,430 --> 02:45:28,263
both of them,

6295
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:30,990
but one of the boys you can't touch.

6296
02:45:31,010 --> 02:45:31,251
Wonder boy.

6297
02:45:31,251 --> 02:45:32,490
He's got a hickey on his neck.

6298
02:45:33,070 --> 02:45:34,780
Hickeys sidekick is beautiful.

6299
02:45:35,020 --> 02:45:35,853
He's eight.

6300
02:45:36,940 --> 02:45:39,910
He's winning this fight and
he's winning decisively.

6301
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:40,620
Who's winning this fight?

6302
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:41,030
I wonder.

6303
02:45:41,030 --> 02:45:41,980
Boy Keeps.

6304
02:45:41,981 --> 02:45:44,070
She keeps hitting control.

6305
02:45:44,140 --> 02:45:44,531
No,

6306
02:45:44,531 --> 02:45:45,610
he keeps hitting worry.

6307
02:45:45,611 --> 02:45:46,360
Keeps hitting this.

6308
02:45:46,360 --> 02:45:47,440
Let's all be honest.

6309
02:45:47,441 --> 02:45:48,730
We haven't been paying attention.

6310
02:45:50,400 --> 02:45:52,660
He's been breaking on USA hockey keepers,

6311
02:45:52,661 --> 02:45:53,081
Columbia.

6312
02:45:53,081 --> 02:45:55,440
I was watching the wonder
boy hasn't been touched in.

6313
02:45:55,450 --> 02:45:56,080
Might be lying.

6314
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:56,271
He's,

6315
02:45:56,271 --> 02:45:57,880
he's punching Rory.

6316
02:45:58,030 --> 02:45:59,440
I'm over and over again.

6317
02:45:59,800 --> 02:46:00,550
Not Hard,

6318
02:46:00,550 --> 02:46:01,960
but he's connected with Brian.

6319
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:04,010
You might want to stay
offline for a couple of days.

6320
02:46:07,210 --> 02:46:08,140
Definitely don't check.

6321
02:46:09,430 --> 02:46:09,650
Oh,

6322
02:46:09,650 --> 02:46:10,161
definitely.

6323
02:46:10,161 --> 02:46:11,330
Stay away from Facebook.

6324
02:46:11,331 --> 02:46:12,164
Brian Cowen care.

6325
02:46:13,460 --> 02:46:14,300
I'll be in Florida.

6326
02:46:14,390 --> 02:46:15,850
I'll be an off the academy in Naples.

6327
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:21,190
June 23rd 24th 25th it's like sometimes
it's better to just watch it and greed.

6328
02:46:22,310 --> 02:46:23,143
You don't have to talk.

6329
02:46:23,270 --> 02:46:23,700
Listen,

6330
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:24,533
I get excited.

6331
02:46:24,710 --> 02:46:25,540
Look at this.

6332
02:46:25,540 --> 02:46:26,560
I've made mistakes.

6333
02:46:28,130 --> 02:46:28,830
I've made mistakes.

6334
02:46:28,830 --> 02:46:30,780
Didn't land be Ted.

6335
02:46:30,781 --> 02:46:31,614
Let him know that.

6336
02:46:31,630 --> 02:46:32,463
Didn't

6337
02:46:33,610 --> 02:46:35,730
foresee talking a little

6338
02:46:37,960 --> 02:46:38,440
fights.

6339
02:46:38,440 --> 02:46:39,320
I get excited,

6340
02:46:39,321 --> 02:46:39,561
Bro.

6341
02:46:39,561 --> 02:46:40,390
I can't help it.

6342
02:46:40,390 --> 02:46:42,620
I view more as you do it.

6343
02:46:43,050 --> 02:46:44,630
Accent best.

6344
02:46:44,670 --> 02:46:46,370
Least make it entertaining.

6345
02:46:46,371 --> 02:46:47,240
You want to say something?

6346
02:46:47,241 --> 02:46:48,140
Say only accurate.

6347
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:53,780
So we just trying to say is 10 years some
ridiculous person that we don't know.

6348
02:46:54,590 --> 02:46:56,990
Instead of our friend Brian
was saying retarded shit.

6349
02:46:57,070 --> 02:46:57,380
All right.

6350
02:46:57,380 --> 02:46:58,340
I like the Brazilian.

6351
02:46:58,341 --> 02:46:59,300
You're Brazilian voice,

6352
02:46:59,301 --> 02:47:01,250
so if you're going to say
civil about the fight,

6353
02:47:01,251 --> 02:47:01,760
just give me an,

6354
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:02,790
I'll do him as an Englishman.

6355
02:47:02,910 --> 02:47:03,600
Rough.

6356
02:47:03,600 --> 02:47:05,310
Have you done to get hopeless?

6357
02:47:05,350 --> 02:47:05,820
Oh,

6358
02:47:05,820 --> 02:47:06,710
that was terrible.

6359
02:47:06,711 --> 02:47:07,311
On a second.

6360
02:47:07,311 --> 02:47:10,370
Have we ever gotten him
w together with Hanako?

6361
02:47:11,370 --> 02:47:12,203
How's that?

6362
02:47:12,540 --> 02:47:13,360
How's that?

6363
02:47:13,360 --> 02:47:17,450
We'll be talking to
talk about that forever.

6364
02:47:17,540 --> 02:47:19,020
How's that possible exactly.

6365
02:47:19,070 --> 02:47:19,790
Oh my God.

6366
02:47:19,790 --> 02:47:24,080
This week around this week on the
farm when you leaving for Florida,

6367
02:47:24,860 --> 02:47:27,290
I'll be leaving for the off
the hook comedy club in Naples,

6368
02:47:27,540 --> 02:47:28,220
June,

6369
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:32,690
June 22nd to perform June 23rd 24th
and 25th what's in your fucking mouth?

6370
02:47:32,990 --> 02:47:33,680
Pickles.

6371
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:35,010
Don't chew into the microphone.

6372
02:47:35,050 --> 02:47:37,660
Not you know many goddamn
complaints I get about you choose.

6373
02:47:37,970 --> 02:47:39,500
If you smack into the mic,

6374
02:47:39,530 --> 02:47:40,363
you just did.

6375
02:47:40,470 --> 02:47:42,110
US Son of a bitch.

6376
02:47:42,650 --> 02:47:43,490
Stay off Twitter.

6377
02:47:43,491 --> 02:47:45,000
I'm telling you guys,

6378
02:47:45,130 --> 02:47:45,651
hey Melanie,

6379
02:47:45,651 --> 02:47:46,484
lay low.

6380
02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:49,460
I want to lay low for a Dallas.

6381
02:47:49,461 --> 02:47:50,271
Do I always do?

6382
02:47:50,271 --> 02:47:50,571
Anyway,

6383
02:47:50,571 --> 02:47:52,550
I got to step up my Twitter game guys.

6384
02:47:52,551 --> 02:47:53,540
Let's watch four minutes.

6385
02:47:53,541 --> 02:47:58,310
35 second front leg side kick is nasty
because when it different sheet Wonderboy

6386
02:47:58,311 --> 02:48:00,170
and anybody will Raymond Daniels for sure,

6387
02:48:00,380 --> 02:48:03,780
but between one point and a
lot of guys that you'll spark,

6388
02:48:04,130 --> 02:48:06,620
he said he could hurt you with that
front leg side kick to the body,

6389
02:48:06,830 --> 02:48:08,030
the front lake sacks to the body.

6390
02:48:08,030 --> 02:48:09,680
It's got like a real snap to it.

6391
02:48:09,930 --> 02:48:11,000
Whereas a lot of guys who just,

6392
02:48:11,540 --> 02:48:14,720
they do it a lot of times they touch
you with the ball of the foot more than

6393
02:48:14,721 --> 02:48:17,810
they're hitting you with like
the side blade or the heel,

6394
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:19,870
but Wonderboy is stuffing it in there.

6395
02:48:19,900 --> 02:48:20,733
He's too hard.

6396
02:48:21,980 --> 02:48:24,190
Good toe.

6397
02:48:25,370 --> 02:48:26,001
Very nice.

6398
02:48:26,001 --> 02:48:29,720
Roary caught him with that left hand that
that right arm across the face in that

6399
02:48:29,721 --> 02:48:30,920
left arm extended.

6400
02:48:30,921 --> 02:48:31,940
Very interesting.

6401
02:48:32,180 --> 02:48:34,780
Almost like the George Foreman fight.

6402
02:48:34,880 --> 02:48:36,060
Aren't she more style?

6403
02:48:36,061 --> 02:48:36,651
I mean come on.

6404
02:48:36,651 --> 02:48:38,020
Wonder Boys catching a horse.

6405
02:48:38,160 --> 02:48:40,790
You got to think about
Octagon Control Brian.

6406
02:48:40,830 --> 02:48:42,140
It factors into it.

6407
02:48:42,141 --> 02:48:44,930
Does it matter when you're getting at
he's punching him those kind of with the

6408
02:48:44,940 --> 02:48:45,240
left.

6409
02:48:45,240 --> 02:48:46,810
She landing stuff too though.

6410
02:48:46,970 --> 02:48:47,810
Really Baba.

6411
02:48:48,170 --> 02:48:49,003
I disagree.

6412
02:48:49,580 --> 02:48:50,210
Honestly.

6413
02:48:50,210 --> 02:48:51,590
This is a very good fight.

6414
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:52,830
It's a great fun with

6415
02:48:54,380 --> 02:48:58,190
these guys are just caught
him with a left hook hard.

6416
02:48:58,530 --> 02:48:59,331
I know it's true,

6417
02:48:59,331 --> 02:49:02,670
but I know you want her to win
and I love Rory and I love,

6418
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:03,830
I fucking love him.

6419
02:49:03,980 --> 02:49:04,970
Just shut the fuck up.

6420
02:49:05,720 --> 02:49:05,991
Hey,

6421
02:49:05,991 --> 02:49:08,310
can I have to say that Brian was a judge?

6422
02:49:08,311 --> 02:49:09,091
We'd have to kill him.

6423
02:49:09,091 --> 02:49:10,380
Just watch the fight.

6424
02:49:10,480 --> 02:49:11,040
I'm quiet.

6425
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:11,873
Look guys,

6426
02:49:11,910 --> 02:49:13,260
I think I'm being accurate here.

6427
02:49:13,261 --> 02:49:14,220
I'm being fair.

6428
02:49:14,250 --> 02:49:15,083
It's a very good fight.

6429
02:49:15,090 --> 02:49:17,600
Look at Rory sneakers would
agree with you brother.

6430
02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:20,070
[inaudible] he's sneaky ass.

6431
02:49:20,071 --> 02:49:22,320
Right hand copy strike
would agree with you Brian.

6432
02:49:22,350 --> 02:49:25,110
I'm just saying an octagon
control and significant strikes.

6433
02:49:25,111 --> 02:49:26,040
Roy might be winning.

6434
02:49:26,180 --> 02:49:26,550
Yeah,

6435
02:49:26,550 --> 02:49:27,390
I don't know man.

6436
02:49:27,391 --> 02:49:30,630
It's in fucking Canada is not
not coming close to winning bub.

6437
02:49:30,631 --> 02:49:31,290
He's just not,

6438
02:49:31,290 --> 02:49:34,510
I'm sorry he's not watching this.

6439
02:49:34,530 --> 02:49:38,280
Stop worrying about the end of the
goddamn fight and enjoy the fucking fight,

6440
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:39,473
which is playing.

6441
02:49:39,650 --> 02:49:41,850
You guys are talking about
you guys talking about soccer.

6442
02:49:41,850 --> 02:49:44,490
Stopped thinking about who won
while it's actually happening.

6443
02:49:44,491 --> 02:49:45,420
You fuck heads.

6444
02:49:47,250 --> 02:49:48,690
I'm not really mad shit.

6445
02:49:48,691 --> 02:49:48,871
You Go.

6446
02:49:48,871 --> 02:49:50,560
I'm so mad.

6447
02:49:50,630 --> 02:49:54,750
You're just [inaudible] to stop.

6448
02:49:55,410 --> 02:49:56,243
It needs to stop.

6449
02:49:56,250 --> 02:49:57,083
You're passionate,

6450
02:49:57,510 --> 02:50:00,810
well controlled without
doesn't make say Jamie,

6451
02:50:01,170 --> 02:50:01,700
listen man,

6452
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:04,900
I'll you this Roy pulling to
the ground home like this.

6453
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:06,270
But again,

6454
02:50:06,300 --> 02:50:08,040
the judges when you get
pulled to the ground,

6455
02:50:08,041 --> 02:50:09,060
they're viewing it as one.

6456
02:50:09,061 --> 02:50:12,300
The boy getting Tory is trying
to attack him from his back.

6457
02:50:12,301 --> 02:50:13,620
He felt like that was a good idea.

6458
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:14,160
Right?

6459
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:15,060
Is that what happened or what did,

6460
02:50:15,220 --> 02:50:15,590
yeah,

6461
02:50:15,590 --> 02:50:16,920
he pulled them down.

6462
02:50:16,921 --> 02:50:17,131
Right.

6463
02:50:17,131 --> 02:50:18,030
I'm not imagining that.

6464
02:50:18,031 --> 02:50:19,620
I'm no fucking happen.

6465
02:50:21,230 --> 02:50:22,063
That was hard.

6466
02:50:22,150 --> 02:50:22,680
Who's,

6467
02:50:22,680 --> 02:50:24,360
we can't pull side control.

6468
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:25,780
I mean you want to post card?

6469
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:26,220
Yep.

6470
02:50:26,220 --> 02:50:27,600
Do this might lose up Roy.

6471
02:50:27,601 --> 02:50:30,490
The fight and these Wonderboy
almost are pretty fucking white.

6472
02:50:30,510 --> 02:50:31,350
So close.

6473
02:50:31,351 --> 02:50:33,800
And then when you pull
fucking site control,

6474
02:50:33,810 --> 02:50:34,231
you know Eddie,

6475
02:50:34,231 --> 02:50:38,100
you like one of the first guys to
say that it was before one a cro,

6476
02:50:38,101 --> 02:50:38,934
cop's fights.

6477
02:50:39,270 --> 02:50:42,000
You and I were talking and you were saying
like when you get a guy who's like a

6478
02:50:42,001 --> 02:50:42,930
real experience,

6479
02:50:42,931 --> 02:50:43,351
Stryker,

6480
02:50:43,351 --> 02:50:47,190
they can generate some power
and like a real close area.

6481
02:50:47,191 --> 02:50:51,690
Like you were noticing that if there was
guys who could do ground and pound from

6482
02:50:51,691 --> 02:50:52,620
inside the guard,

6483
02:50:52,621 --> 02:50:55,830
even where you see what vandalling
pride back in the pride days,

6484
02:50:56,150 --> 02:50:57,060
you see ventilated.

6485
02:50:57,150 --> 02:50:58,200
He wanted me to stay standing,

6486
02:50:58,201 --> 02:51:00,020
but he was rarely in the gold,

6487
02:51:00,021 --> 02:51:00,720
but Oh,

6488
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:01,553
you heard him?

6489
02:51:03,290 --> 02:51:04,123
Oh No.

6490
02:51:04,220 --> 02:51:04,740
Oh.

6491
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:05,573
Oh Shit.

6492
02:51:05,940 --> 02:51:06,420
Oh,

6493
02:51:06,420 --> 02:51:07,640
he hurt Roy's.

6494
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:08,470
Hi.

6495
02:51:08,470 --> 02:51:08,670
Oh,

6496
02:51:08,670 --> 02:51:09,570
I don't know what he hit him with the,

6497
02:51:09,571 --> 02:51:10,500
I think he hit him in the nose,

6498
02:51:10,501 --> 02:51:12,270
but I think he hit with
the left hand nightmare.

6499
02:51:12,271 --> 02:51:13,104
He's covering up.

6500
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:14,340
What did he hit him with?

6501
02:51:14,370 --> 02:51:14,671
Oh yeah,

6502
02:51:14,671 --> 02:51:15,331
he's bleeding heavy.

6503
02:51:15,331 --> 02:51:15,590
Snow.

6504
02:51:15,590 --> 02:51:18,930
Snow sucked up that same
knows that he broke it to rob.

6505
02:51:19,490 --> 02:51:23,470
Look at wonder boys cardio and I
really just say that's the same nose.

6506
02:51:23,471 --> 02:51:24,840
He broke in the Robbie Lawler fight.

6507
02:51:32,260 --> 02:51:37,260
2042 seconds.

6508
02:51:57,130 --> 02:51:59,260
If I was UFC had fire me,

6509
02:52:00,210 --> 02:52:00,350
they

6510
02:52:00,350 --> 02:52:01,270
call me up right now.

6511
02:52:01,271 --> 02:52:02,360
I'll give you a bonus.

6512
02:52:02,920 --> 02:52:04,520
I give you a fucking promotion.

6513
02:52:05,530 --> 02:52:06,130
That's enough.

6514
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:06,963
That's enough.

6515
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:08,993
We've seen enough.

6516
02:52:09,010 --> 02:52:09,843
Brian Stann,

6517
02:52:10,370 --> 02:52:10,820
right?

6518
02:52:10,820 --> 02:52:11,653
Family seven,

6519
02:52:11,970 --> 02:52:12,431
whichever.

6520
02:52:12,431 --> 02:52:12,830
Say this.

6521
02:52:12,830 --> 02:52:14,010
Let's say Roy,

6522
02:52:14,290 --> 02:52:16,000
he's bleeding bad or that knows man,

6523
02:52:16,510 --> 02:52:17,440
that does not look good.

6524
02:52:17,830 --> 02:52:18,730
All jokes aside,

6525
02:52:20,410 --> 02:52:24,470
let's say knows that that he used
to breed that up when he was fine.

6526
02:52:25,880 --> 02:52:26,713
No,

6527
02:52:28,050 --> 02:52:28,883
no,

6528
02:52:29,230 --> 02:52:30,430
no zebra out.

6529
02:52:30,860 --> 02:52:32,050
But he was too.

6530
02:52:32,170 --> 02:52:33,220
He broke that same note.

6531
02:52:33,221 --> 02:52:35,040
That's a note that knows,

6532
02:52:35,050 --> 02:52:37,150
you knows locking first.

6533
02:52:37,810 --> 02:52:38,890
Wonderboy came members,

6534
02:52:38,891 --> 02:52:43,490
mamas smell the fresh sanitize area
of the hospital that says he knows.

6535
02:52:44,130 --> 02:52:45,160
They know son.

6536
02:52:45,310 --> 02:52:45,760
Wah.

6537
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:46,061
Okay,

6538
02:52:46,061 --> 02:52:47,050
so Brian,

6539
02:52:47,080 --> 02:52:48,820
since you are paying attention so closely,

6540
02:52:48,821 --> 02:52:49,900
much more than any of us,

6541
02:52:51,130 --> 02:52:54,610
you really do judge a
fine 100% without a doubt.

6542
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:56,720
Wonderboy and buy without a doubt.

6543
02:52:57,370 --> 02:52:57,970
Without a doubt.

6544
02:52:57,970 --> 02:52:58,803
The strengths are.

6545
02:53:01,980 --> 02:53:02,360
What do you think?

6546
02:53:02,360 --> 02:53:03,840
It definitely looks like
Thompson when the phone,

6547
02:53:03,850 --> 02:53:04,590
what do you think as you,

6548
02:53:04,590 --> 02:53:09,130
but you think Roy McDonald might've got
the nod because of a black helicopters

6549
02:53:09,131 --> 02:53:14,131
and chem trails because the tower
seven don't start with that shit again.

6550
02:53:15,140 --> 02:53:16,370
So if that's scary,

6551
02:53:17,310 --> 02:53:18,143
I'm scared.

6552
02:53:18,760 --> 02:53:19,593
Please.

6553
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:23,890
Were you paying attention enough to,

6554
02:53:23,930 --> 02:53:27,340
to really give an honest
reading of who won the fight?

6555
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:28,433
Yes.

6556
02:53:30,100 --> 02:53:30,940
Wonderboy,

6557
02:53:31,060 --> 02:53:32,260
definitely one.

6558
02:53:32,650 --> 02:53:33,310
Thank you.

6559
02:53:33,310 --> 02:53:35,620
I have to say way too hard.

6560
02:53:37,540 --> 02:53:38,373
Too many drinks.

6561
02:53:40,540 --> 02:53:41,830
I was super impressed with two things.

6562
02:53:41,831 --> 02:53:42,041
One.

6563
02:53:42,041 --> 02:53:45,040
I was super impressed with Roy's that
the weird defense is using what that high

6564
02:53:45,041 --> 02:53:49,390
left hand and that right
hand almost across his face
like Archie Moore Style and

6565
02:53:49,420 --> 02:53:51,730
definitely like he was really
good at controlling the distance.

6566
02:53:51,731 --> 02:53:54,280
But I think like as the rounds went on,

6567
02:53:54,281 --> 02:53:59,281
you started to see Wonderboy getting a
little more comfortable and relaxing into

6568
02:53:59,561 --> 02:54:00,760
that sniping,

6569
02:54:00,790 --> 02:54:02,230
jumping back and forth style.

6570
02:54:02,500 --> 02:54:03,520
And that's when uh,

6571
02:54:03,550 --> 02:54:04,960
that's when the tide started to change.

6572
02:54:05,020 --> 02:54:08,620
It looked like to me where it started
to establish that Wonderboy was getting

6573
02:54:08,621 --> 02:54:10,300
slightly better in each exchange.

6574
02:54:10,420 --> 02:54:12,670
And that's what we talked about
actually before the fight started.

6575
02:54:12,671 --> 02:54:16,610
I was saying if Wonderboy can land
one or more punches and eats exchange,

6576
02:54:16,611 --> 02:54:18,450
then Rory can pick it.

6577
02:54:18,500 --> 02:54:19,960
And that adds up over time.

6578
02:54:20,350 --> 02:54:21,640
That's exactly what happened.

6579
02:54:24,370 --> 02:54:26,050
50 45,

6580
02:54:26,890 --> 02:54:28,450
50 45 Wonderboy,

6581
02:54:28,630 --> 02:54:29,463
Wonderboy,

6582
02:54:30,220 --> 02:54:33,100
54 boys,

6583
02:54:33,101 --> 02:54:34,570
I've got to go do some standup comedy.

6584
02:54:34,600 --> 02:54:36,400
I love all three of you
and love you too baby.

6585
02:54:36,401 --> 02:54:37,240
I love you Jay.

6586
02:54:37,241 --> 02:54:40,030
I love you and love you
to see your boys later.

6587
02:54:40,150 --> 02:54:42,880
And you were a hundred percent
correct on the scoring Colby.

6588
02:54:42,881 --> 02:54:43,690
You nailed it.

6589
02:54:43,690 --> 02:54:44,523
And now

6590
02:54:45,690 --> 02:54:47,260
finding is my secret garden guys.

6591
02:54:47,650 --> 02:54:51,010
So please treat me really,

6592
02:54:51,011 --> 02:54:52,240
really high level fight,

6593
02:54:52,241 --> 02:54:52,511
man.

6594
02:54:52,511 --> 02:54:54,250
I think we can all agree this.

6595
02:54:54,880 --> 02:54:55,420
Sit down,

6596
02:54:55,420 --> 02:54:55,751
sit down,

6597
02:54:55,751 --> 02:54:55,990
blah blah.

6598
02:54:55,990 --> 02:54:56,531
For one second.

6599
02:54:56,531 --> 02:54:57,340
Let's wrap this up.

6600
02:54:57,340 --> 02:54:57,700
Go ahead.

6601
02:54:57,700 --> 02:54:59,560
You don't have a show
until you have a half hour.

6602
02:54:59,561 --> 02:55:00,160
Sit down.

6603
02:55:00,160 --> 02:55:00,460
Sit down.

6604
02:55:00,460 --> 02:55:01,810
Have a fuck those people.

6605
02:55:01,960 --> 02:55:02,793
I know this.

6606
02:55:03,090 --> 02:55:03,980
There's a guy,

6607
02:55:04,790 --> 02:55:05,623
there's always a guy.

6608
02:55:05,720 --> 02:55:06,650
But um,

6609
02:55:07,440 --> 02:55:08,370
this was like a,

6610
02:55:08,390 --> 02:55:11,030
this is a super interesting style fight,

6611
02:55:11,090 --> 02:55:11,450
right?

6612
02:55:11,450 --> 02:55:12,500
As well as yes,

6613
02:55:13,370 --> 02:55:14,420
it's almost a new blood,

6614
02:55:14,421 --> 02:55:14,661
right?

6615
02:55:14,661 --> 02:55:16,820
I mean Wonderboy is the new blood.

6616
02:55:16,820 --> 02:55:20,270
He just is Roy Roy's younger,

6617
02:55:21,540 --> 02:55:22,373
more dynamic.

6618
02:55:23,030 --> 02:55:26,120
You have to give Wonderboy
the title shot here for Rory.

6619
02:55:26,121 --> 02:55:28,190
It's a tough road because
now he goes into free agency.

6620
02:55:28,250 --> 02:55:29,000
I make a call.

6621
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:29,750
I called Robbie.

6622
02:55:29,750 --> 02:55:31,540
Lawler is the baddest
motherfucker on the planet one.

6623
02:55:31,541 --> 02:55:32,374
A boy will beat him.

6624
02:55:32,410 --> 02:55:34,910
I beat him the same way
he beat Johnny Hendricks.

6625
02:55:35,150 --> 02:55:36,190
It's a very tight group.

6626
02:55:36,230 --> 02:55:38,140
I agree 100% with Brian on that content.

6627
02:55:38,210 --> 02:55:38,481
Yeah,

6628
02:55:38,481 --> 02:55:41,690
but you gotta you can't
dismiss Tyron Woodley.

6629
02:55:41,910 --> 02:55:42,200
Yes,

6630
02:55:42,200 --> 02:55:46,540
you can buy same thing and do
the same thing with giant hands,

6631
02:55:48,210 --> 02:55:50,090
Robbie and Tyron Woodley or funny.

6632
02:55:50,091 --> 02:55:54,620
You can't pretend that you know what's
going to happen and I will and I will.

6633
02:55:54,621 --> 02:55:56,120
That's what we're doing as usual.

6634
02:55:56,180 --> 02:55:58,970
What do you think's going to
happen in that fight with Tyron?

6635
02:55:58,971 --> 02:55:59,630
Well,

6636
02:55:59,630 --> 02:56:00,300
Robbie Lawler,

6637
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:01,880
you think you know what's going to happen?

6638
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:03,050
I think,

6639
02:56:03,050 --> 02:56:04,460
I think that rock and bar,

6640
02:56:04,461 --> 02:56:06,170
I think Robbie Lawler and pills,

6641
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:06,510
no.

6642
02:56:06,510 --> 02:56:07,343
Listen,

6643
02:56:08,990 --> 02:56:11,390
one red bike thing and then
I'm going to get out of here.

6644
02:56:11,720 --> 02:56:12,290
Listen,

6645
02:56:12,290 --> 02:56:13,123
let me drop this.

6646
02:56:13,340 --> 02:56:14,173
I think Robbie,

6647
02:56:15,170 --> 02:56:16,590
Robbie Lawler has something that,

6648
02:56:16,620 --> 02:56:20,030
that I've never seen a fighter and
that is in round five and I'm not

6649
02:56:20,031 --> 02:56:20,840
exaggerating.

6650
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:22,070
He's more pumped,

6651
02:56:22,130 --> 02:56:24,320
has more energy than it doesn't round one.

6652
02:56:24,560 --> 02:56:25,490
And on top of that,

6653
02:56:25,491 --> 02:56:29,780
that doesn't hear something indestructable
about that guy either major.

6654
02:56:29,790 --> 02:56:30,710
Yes I am.

6655
02:56:31,010 --> 02:56:32,300
And so as Paul Felder

6656
02:56:35,720 --> 02:56:40,720
off the Comedy 23rd 28 r y
a n c a l l e n at Twitter,

6657
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:45,170
that fucking such a savage.

6658
02:56:45,171 --> 02:56:45,950
So funny.

6659
02:56:45,950 --> 02:56:47,330
He's such a fucking savage.

6660
02:56:47,340 --> 02:56:51,680
So finally he called
to show just stand up.

6661
02:56:51,810 --> 02:56:52,643
It's got a show.

6662
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:54,330
I don't know where to show.

6663
02:56:54,330 --> 02:56:56,930
So this is like exactly what
we said before the fight out.

6664
02:56:57,010 --> 02:57:01,280
You know what I was saying
that if Wonderboy can just
get a couple extra punches

6665
02:57:01,790 --> 02:57:05,810
in each exchange or one every now and
again those are going to accumulate.

6666
02:57:06,170 --> 02:57:06,711
Ooh,

6667
02:57:06,711 --> 02:57:07,544
I don't like that.

6668
02:57:07,550 --> 02:57:08,990
That open hand shit.

6669
02:57:09,020 --> 02:57:11,420
He landed a palm to the face first.

6670
02:57:11,450 --> 02:57:12,590
Rory is young,

6671
02:57:12,620 --> 02:57:14,970
but he's had some miles on
him while he's had that.

6672
02:57:15,020 --> 02:57:19,460
Robbie Lawler fight was absolutely
brutal and this was a less brutal fight.

6673
02:57:19,490 --> 02:57:20,250
But yeah,

6674
02:57:20,250 --> 02:57:21,120
definitely took some water.

6675
02:57:21,130 --> 02:57:21,841
Boy for sure.

6676
02:57:21,841 --> 02:57:22,940
He just the next title shot.

6677
02:57:23,060 --> 02:57:26,000
That was the thing about beat the
number one guy in the world watching the

6678
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:26,960
Robbie Lawler fight again.

6679
02:57:27,030 --> 02:57:27,520
Oh,

6680
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:29,120
I almost forgot.

6681
02:57:29,150 --> 02:57:30,050
Not really forgot,

6682
02:57:30,051 --> 02:57:34,040
but I had to be reminded a little
bit of how primal that fight was.

6683
02:57:34,500 --> 02:57:35,080
Oh,

6684
02:57:35,080 --> 02:57:35,800
barbaric.

6685
02:57:35,800 --> 02:57:36,633
Close guys,

6686
02:57:36,680 --> 02:57:37,461
Baird at all.

6687
02:57:37,461 --> 02:57:37,940
I like,

6688
02:57:37,940 --> 02:57:42,940
but the thing is I like
wonder boys chances against
Woodley or a fucking Robbie

6689
02:57:44,030 --> 02:57:44,031
Lawler.

6690
02:57:44,031 --> 02:57:46,100
He's super like his chances
against both of them.

6691
02:57:46,130 --> 02:57:47,180
He's super dangerous,

6692
02:57:47,210 --> 02:57:49,610
especially if they'd take a
chance to try to hurt him.

6693
02:57:49,620 --> 02:57:50,120
Ooh.

6694
02:57:50,120 --> 02:57:51,350
See the thing about open up,

6695
02:57:51,890 --> 02:57:53,510
it's not going to decision.

6696
02:57:53,720 --> 02:57:54,830
If you take a chance,

6697
02:57:54,831 --> 02:57:55,940
he's going to capitalize on it.

6698
02:57:55,970 --> 02:57:58,220
He can do that little slide back.

6699
02:57:58,221 --> 02:58:02,330
Counter lefthand can nasty man
and he can fight from southpaw

6700
02:58:02,370 --> 02:58:03,480
or Orthodox too,

6701
02:58:03,481 --> 02:58:04,050
man.

6702
02:58:04,050 --> 02:58:04,280
You know,

6703
02:58:04,280 --> 02:58:05,520
40 fights from southpaw.

6704
02:58:05,550 --> 02:58:07,490
A lot of it is those sidekicks,

6705
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:08,550
his front leg side case,

6706
02:58:08,850 --> 02:58:09,780
but God damn man,

6707
02:58:09,781 --> 02:58:11,460
he can do that from the left side too.

6708
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:12,700
He get through those front legs.

6709
02:58:12,810 --> 02:58:15,210
He's been doing karate since he was three.

6710
02:58:15,530 --> 02:58:17,850
He's literally that guy
that you always joke about.

6711
02:58:18,210 --> 02:58:19,530
Eddie Brown would always joke about it.

6712
02:58:19,531 --> 02:58:20,040
He goes,

6713
02:58:20,040 --> 02:58:20,431
he goes,

6714
02:58:20,431 --> 02:58:24,510
if you took a dude who was doing like
karate from the time he was three,

6715
02:58:24,750 --> 02:58:26,340
one was like Super Ninja.

6716
02:58:26,460 --> 02:58:30,750
There was like 52.0 and you taught him
how to stand up and avoid take downs.

6717
02:58:31,140 --> 02:58:32,970
How good would he do against
most of the strikers?

6718
02:58:32,971 --> 02:58:33,350
There you go.

6719
02:58:33,350 --> 02:58:33,850
We used to,

6720
02:58:33,850 --> 02:58:36,030
you and I used to have these
conversation title next.

6721
02:58:36,180 --> 02:58:39,270
It's almost like you created
this dude with your imagination.

6722
02:58:39,271 --> 02:58:42,270
You know what other conversations we
used to have his back in the dark days of

6723
02:58:42,271 --> 02:58:43,880
the UFC when it was underground on,

6724
02:58:44,040 --> 02:58:44,880
on direct TV,

6725
02:58:44,881 --> 02:58:45,271
only,

6726
02:58:45,271 --> 02:58:47,250
only on satellite is the days are over.

6727
02:58:47,250 --> 02:58:48,480
We have shows like this,

6728
02:58:48,830 --> 02:58:53,130
you know what an networks with baseball
scores on the bottom and they're in

6729
02:58:53,131 --> 02:58:57,990
these big ESPN type studios that like
one of these days that's going to happen.

6730
02:58:57,991 --> 02:58:58,600
And it's,

6731
02:58:58,600 --> 02:59:00,130
it's like nothing now everywhere.

6732
02:59:00,460 --> 02:59:00,870
What do you,

6733
02:59:00,870 --> 02:59:01,590
what do you do?

6734
02:59:01,590 --> 02:59:03,390
Where does Roy McDonald go from here?

6735
02:59:03,480 --> 02:59:04,500
Starts to fray and see,

6736
02:59:05,190 --> 02:59:05,611
well,

6737
02:59:05,611 --> 02:59:06,061
you know what,

6738
02:59:06,061 --> 02:59:07,380
it was a very close fight,

6739
02:59:07,381 --> 02:59:07,841
but he,

6740
02:59:07,841 --> 02:59:10,530
he lost a decision to Wonderboy.

6741
02:59:10,560 --> 02:59:15,150
Who Right now is the best in the fucking
world that standing up and doing this

6742
02:59:15,151 --> 02:59:17,140
doesn't matter that slides in a outside.

6743
02:59:17,290 --> 02:59:17,500
No,

6744
02:59:17,500 --> 02:59:17,670
no,

6745
02:59:17,670 --> 02:59:17,941
no,

6746
02:59:17,941 --> 02:59:18,121
no,

6747
02:59:18,121 --> 02:59:18,241
no,

6748
02:59:18,241 --> 02:59:18,780
no.

6749
02:59:18,780 --> 02:59:22,890
But I'm saying is he still a few years
younger than Wonderboy and I think he

6750
02:59:22,891 --> 02:59:24,480
learns from this fight
and gets even better.

6751
02:59:24,481 --> 02:59:27,480
But I think this is a Goddamn wake
up call to the rest of the division.

6752
02:59:27,481 --> 02:59:29,940
This Wonderboy dude is legit as fuck.

6753
02:59:30,030 --> 02:59:31,590
And his angles and all this shit.

6754
02:59:31,620 --> 02:59:33,300
We're seeing this creativity,

6755
02:59:33,301 --> 02:59:36,150
this ability to stay in the pocket
and not get hit nearly as much.

6756
02:59:36,330 --> 02:59:37,830
Throw a lot of dangerous shit.

6757
02:59:37,831 --> 02:59:39,180
Look at these angles man,

6758
02:59:39,510 --> 02:59:40,151
and take shots.

6759
02:59:40,151 --> 02:59:41,790
Tagged him there with that left hand.

6760
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:43,790
All all I'm saying is if
you're wearing Mcdonald,

6761
02:59:43,791 --> 02:59:47,250
he lost the number one guide and I less
than number two guy would go back to the

6762
02:59:47,251 --> 02:59:47,851
drawing board.

6763
02:59:47,851 --> 02:59:50,430
He keeps swaying and you're 26
years was signed with UFC game.

6764
02:59:50,470 --> 02:59:51,320
You don't test for agents.

6765
02:59:51,380 --> 02:59:52,410
Who knows?

6766
02:59:52,920 --> 02:59:53,191
Dude,

6767
02:59:53,191 --> 02:59:53,760
it's no.

6768
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:55,200
When you say free agency,

6769
02:59:55,410 --> 02:59:58,260
no one is saying that the UFC isn't going
to counter the offer and they're going

6770
02:59:58,261 --> 02:59:59,094
to come to a nice,

6771
02:59:59,760 --> 03:00:02,560
I'm saying if you're already just signed
with the UFC and try fighting for the

6772
03:00:02,561 --> 03:00:03,390
kid,

6773
03:00:03,390 --> 03:00:06,480
I think he could absolutely
be a world champion.

6774
03:00:06,481 --> 03:00:11,481
Either saying Bella tour or in the UFC
world champion in any organization.

6775
03:00:12,180 --> 03:00:12,780
It's,

6776
03:00:12,780 --> 03:00:14,190
he's 26 man,

6777
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:17,730
like he has like four or five
years before he hits his prime.

6778
03:00:18,240 --> 03:00:19,170
But what are you looking at with the,

6779
03:00:19,171 --> 03:00:24,030
with Wonderboy right now it's one
of the slickest sneakiest strikers,

6780
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:26,970
one of the best guys at
moving back and calendaring.

6781
03:00:26,971 --> 03:00:28,710
I don't see anyone them and tall.

6782
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:31,070
I thought Wonderboy was
this toughest style.

6783
03:00:31,071 --> 03:00:33,210
A style wise matchup possible.

6784
03:00:33,211 --> 03:00:34,021
I think it'd be too willing.

6785
03:00:34,021 --> 03:00:35,130
I think you'd be to Robbie Lawler.

6786
03:00:35,131 --> 03:00:36,470
I think he smokes Robbie Lawler.

6787
03:00:36,471 --> 03:00:36,960
Be Honest.

6788
03:00:36,960 --> 03:00:37,711
That's so crazy.

6789
03:00:37,711 --> 03:00:37,921
I know.

6790
03:00:37,921 --> 03:00:38,520
It's crazy.

6791
03:00:38,520 --> 03:00:39,353
I don't know.

6792
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:40,860
You can be so competent.

6793
03:00:40,920 --> 03:00:41,753
I agree.

6794
03:00:42,090 --> 03:00:42,901
I just think if he,

6795
03:00:42,901 --> 03:00:43,380
if he,

6796
03:00:43,380 --> 03:00:44,460
if he got past Rory,

6797
03:00:44,461 --> 03:00:45,420
that was his biggest test.

6798
03:00:45,421 --> 03:00:45,661
I thought,

6799
03:00:45,661 --> 03:00:45,871
man,

6800
03:00:45,871 --> 03:00:48,390
there's not a worse match up
guy who can grapple strike,

6801
03:00:48,391 --> 03:00:49,650
do everything and he's smart.

6802
03:00:49,770 --> 03:00:50,011
He's not.

6803
03:00:50,011 --> 03:00:50,731
You can take chances.

6804
03:00:50,731 --> 03:00:51,564
You beat him.

6805
03:00:51,750 --> 03:00:52,740
You're off to the races.

6806
03:00:52,800 --> 03:00:56,620
Robbie Lawler's apart burying dude
straight by bearing buddy brawls and brawl

6807
03:00:56,640 --> 03:00:57,690
brought with Wonderboy Thompson.

6808
03:00:57,691 --> 03:00:58,524
That doesn't end well.

6809
03:00:58,680 --> 03:01:03,630
Maybe calculated maybe or maybe
Robbie Cass's US seven opponents.

6810
03:01:03,660 --> 03:01:04,840
Maybe Robbie catches in the way.

6811
03:01:04,841 --> 03:01:07,150
Jake Ellenberger caught
him and he puts them away.

6812
03:01:07,210 --> 03:01:08,470
That's entirely possible.

6813
03:01:08,830 --> 03:01:09,161
Yeah,

6814
03:01:09,161 --> 03:01:10,470
but what'd he do to make a hamburger?

6815
03:01:10,510 --> 03:01:12,170
Maybe catch some bad case,

6816
03:01:12,220 --> 03:01:15,220
the midnight totally to look
totally possible as well.

6817
03:01:15,370 --> 03:01:18,910
What I'm saying is nobody knows what's
really going to happen until they get

6818
03:01:18,911 --> 03:01:19,540
into it,

6819
03:01:19,540 --> 03:01:21,220
but when I see a guy like Robbie Lawler,

6820
03:01:21,221 --> 03:01:22,330
I see a guy that's like,

6821
03:01:22,710 --> 03:01:27,710
it's less like the physical punishment
that he's taken in these chaotic wars

6822
03:01:28,450 --> 03:01:30,000
with Hendrix catches.

6823
03:01:30,060 --> 03:01:30,590
Sorry.

6824
03:01:30,590 --> 03:01:31,810
Unless that catches up with them.

6825
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:35,730
You're looking at a God damn
barbarian straight by Robbie Lawler.

6826
03:01:35,731 --> 03:01:36,580
It goes to war.

6827
03:01:36,581 --> 03:01:39,820
He goes to war with every
Adam in his big picture.

6828
03:01:39,821 --> 03:01:42,790
He has blood on his arm for coming today
and you know who's the most dangerous

6829
03:01:42,791 --> 03:01:43,600
fucking fight for him?

6830
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:45,040
That dude right to the right Maya.

6831
03:01:45,340 --> 03:01:45,940
Fuck yeah.

6832
03:01:45,940 --> 03:01:46,670
Not fighting him though.

6833
03:01:46,670 --> 03:01:47,503
He's nothing,

6834
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:51,550
but if he ever does Damien Maia
is dangerous to everybody fucker.

6835
03:01:51,970 --> 03:01:53,380
When does he get the title shot?

6836
03:01:53,440 --> 03:01:54,250
It's going to be a well,

6837
03:01:54,250 --> 03:01:54,521
well,

6838
03:01:54,521 --> 03:01:54,971
you know what,

6839
03:01:54,971 --> 03:01:55,360
man,

6840
03:01:55,360 --> 03:01:56,193
here's the thing.

6841
03:01:56,290 --> 03:01:57,760
I don't understand ratings.

6842
03:01:58,060 --> 03:01:59,560
It's all subjective.

6843
03:01:59,561 --> 03:02:03,790
It seems like there's some
by the decisions that get
B done that get done rather

6844
03:02:03,791 --> 03:02:07,120
when one guy beats another guy and this
guy agreed this guy was number three and

6845
03:02:07,121 --> 03:02:07,410
this guy,

6846
03:02:07,410 --> 03:02:08,590
the greasiest cards number two.

6847
03:02:08,591 --> 03:02:09,700
But you know,

6848
03:02:10,150 --> 03:02:12,520
you might have a different agreement than,

6849
03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:14,380
or different opinion rather than I do.

6850
03:02:14,410 --> 03:02:14,921
And I think,

6851
03:02:14,921 --> 03:02:15,220
uh,

6852
03:02:15,220 --> 03:02:15,600
it's,

6853
03:02:15,600 --> 03:02:16,600
it's a subjective thing.

6854
03:02:16,601 --> 03:02:17,230
So I,

6855
03:02:17,230 --> 03:02:18,160
I've tried to reserve,

6856
03:02:18,490 --> 03:02:21,640
but the UFC also Trump's
rankings cause VLC goes well.

6857
03:02:21,641 --> 03:02:24,880
We want Damien had to fight and get flight
drinking him for three wheel to fight

6858
03:02:24,900 --> 03:02:25,510
to the title next.

6859
03:02:25,510 --> 03:02:26,380
They're going to make it happen.

6860
03:02:26,500 --> 03:02:30,460
Well Damien's an interesting
guy because he's older for sure.

6861
03:02:30,960 --> 03:02:32,450
Fought for the title 85.

6862
03:02:33,130 --> 03:02:34,500
And what he's been doing,

6863
03:02:34,501 --> 03:02:36,610
the guys when he gets them on
the ground is nothing short,

6864
03:02:36,611 --> 03:02:36,910
hard.

6865
03:02:36,910 --> 03:02:38,320
Mauling Gunnar Nelson,

6866
03:02:38,321 --> 03:02:39,730
they keep tossing these young lines,

6867
03:02:39,740 --> 03:02:40,573
these starches.

6868
03:02:40,840 --> 03:02:41,673
Gunnar Nelson,

6869
03:02:41,800 --> 03:02:42,670
Neil Magnuson,

6870
03:02:42,790 --> 03:02:43,660
Neil Magni.

6871
03:02:44,230 --> 03:02:45,063
In that sense,

6872
03:02:45,090 --> 03:02:45,490
I'm,

6873
03:02:45,490 --> 03:02:45,741
I'm,

6874
03:02:45,741 --> 03:02:46,030
uh,

6875
03:02:46,030 --> 03:02:46,721
almost like them.

6876
03:02:46,721 --> 03:02:49,840
The enemy of two different types of people
here on the enemy of the people that

6877
03:02:49,841 --> 03:02:53,710
want to respect the rankings because I
sometimes just want to see what happens.

6878
03:02:54,010 --> 03:02:56,440
I want to see what happens when guys
fight certain guys and it's one of the

6879
03:02:56,441 --> 03:03:00,180
things that I don't necessarily
like about the idea titles.

6880
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:02,530
Oh can I see a guy like Robbie Lawler?

6881
03:03:02,710 --> 03:03:05,860
Like I understand that he's the world
champion are specked that and it's fucking

6882
03:03:05,861 --> 03:03:06,281
amazing.

6883
03:03:06,281 --> 03:03:08,800
But really what I care
is that Robbie Lawler's,

6884
03:03:08,801 --> 03:03:09,640
Robbie Lawler,

6885
03:03:09,880 --> 03:03:14,290
which he is exactly what she is and I
want to see Robbie Lawler fight other guys

6886
03:03:14,320 --> 03:03:15,700
that are intriguing.

6887
03:03:16,030 --> 03:03:16,990
Like in to me,

6888
03:03:17,320 --> 03:03:18,520
Robbie Lawler was Thompson.

6889
03:03:18,910 --> 03:03:23,170
Oh you told you it's completely 100% a
hundred percent a hundred percent I'm

6890
03:03:23,171 --> 03:03:26,740
with you 100% I mean like
I'd like that fight as well.

6891
03:03:27,280 --> 03:03:27,821
I'm telling you.

6892
03:03:27,821 --> 03:03:29,110
I also like Tyron Woodley.

6893
03:03:29,140 --> 03:03:31,300
I like Tyron Woodley
for the Oh shit factor.

6894
03:03:31,720 --> 03:03:35,860
I like Tyrone Woodley for his ability to
close the distance and restaurants and

6895
03:03:36,280 --> 03:03:39,010
wrestle like a motherfucker and
it's serious knockout power.

6896
03:03:39,190 --> 03:03:41,200
I like Tyron Woodley
against almost anybody.

6897
03:03:41,201 --> 03:03:42,340
He's dangerous man.

6898
03:03:42,370 --> 03:03:43,240
Just striking to me.

6899
03:03:43,241 --> 03:03:44,470
Trouble against these top guys.

6900
03:03:44,471 --> 03:03:49,471
I think there's a lot of fucking high
level guys in the one 70 division.

6901
03:03:49,631 --> 03:03:51,190
And what interesting.

6902
03:03:51,191 --> 03:03:54,400
What's interesting to me about
Damien Maia is I see the,

6903
03:03:54,401 --> 03:03:59,401
what he does to guys like Rick Story and
I see what you guys had it does to guys

6904
03:03:59,721 --> 03:04:03,560
like Neil Howe magnate and I go
with elite daily and Maya all.

6905
03:04:03,561 --> 03:04:05,330
Luckily Damien Maia,

6906
03:04:05,390 --> 03:04:05,541
well,

6907
03:04:05,541 --> 03:04:06,860
we see this time and going,

6908
03:04:07,420 --> 03:04:07,640
oh,

6909
03:04:07,640 --> 03:04:12,560
we see Tyron Woodley with some
ridiculous Nate Marquardt asked one punch

6910
03:04:12,570 --> 03:04:13,403
knockout.

6911
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:15,080
I want fuck knows man.

6912
03:04:15,310 --> 03:04:19,250
But I think that's a super
powerful fighting a guy
like Woodley ain't so fun to

6913
03:04:19,251 --> 03:04:21,770
try to take down either because
he closed the distance on him.

6914
03:04:21,771 --> 03:04:23,480
He hits hard and fast

6915
03:04:25,130 --> 03:04:25,911
like Rory did here.

6916
03:04:25,911 --> 03:04:27,050
Like with doe from those legs.

6917
03:04:27,051 --> 03:04:28,690
It didn't pay off really.

6918
03:04:28,700 --> 03:04:29,241
It looked good.

6919
03:04:29,241 --> 03:04:30,051
Or in the first round though,

6920
03:04:30,051 --> 03:04:30,680
didn't it?

6921
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:31,281
It'll look cool,

6922
03:04:31,281 --> 03:04:32,114
but you know,

6923
03:04:32,240 --> 03:04:34,580
did someone give
Wonderboy the first round?

6924
03:04:35,270 --> 03:04:35,640
Yeah.

6925
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:36,110
Yeah.

6926
03:04:36,110 --> 03:04:40,190
Fed Up to judges had it 40 40 45 what
did you think about the first round?

6927
03:04:40,191 --> 03:04:40,491
A few.

6928
03:04:40,491 --> 03:04:41,390
If you had to guess,

6929
03:04:41,420 --> 03:04:43,490
I would have gave a sudden
you're shadowing memory,

6930
03:04:43,790 --> 03:04:44,091
right?

6931
03:04:44,091 --> 03:04:47,420
Based on this fucking
peanut Nawara amendment.

6932
03:04:48,110 --> 03:04:51,350
I give the first round to Roy and then
after it appeared that he lost the rest

6933
03:04:51,351 --> 03:04:51,620
of them.

6934
03:04:51,620 --> 03:04:52,161
God Damn,

6935
03:04:52,161 --> 03:04:55,130
I love the way Wonderboy slides
in and out of these shots.

6936
03:04:55,210 --> 03:04:55,520
He's,

6937
03:04:55,520 --> 03:04:58,610
I'd love how he stays in the
pocket to and throws all these,

6938
03:04:58,790 --> 03:04:59,850
these angles there and there.

6939
03:04:59,851 --> 03:05:00,850
He realized it hurt him.

6940
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:04,550
Did y'all talk about a guy who realizes
his standup potential but he's worked on

6941
03:05:04,551 --> 03:05:06,590
his grappling and take
down the fence so much?

6942
03:05:06,710 --> 03:05:09,380
He was so comfortable training out of
his gym and South Carolina and went,

6943
03:05:09,410 --> 03:05:09,621
ah,

6944
03:05:09,621 --> 03:05:10,311
who's the best?

6945
03:05:10,311 --> 03:05:10,491
Well,

6946
03:05:10,491 --> 03:05:14,090
let's go to Weidman's camp and get
annihilated for months and months.

6947
03:05:14,091 --> 03:05:16,760
A month so I can get better
at one 70 that's not,

6948
03:05:17,090 --> 03:05:18,080
that's how many guys do that.

6949
03:05:18,230 --> 03:05:18,521
I know.

6950
03:05:18,521 --> 03:05:19,341
He figured it out.

6951
03:05:19,341 --> 03:05:20,210
It's cool man.

6952
03:05:20,780 --> 03:05:21,390
Well,

6953
03:05:21,390 --> 03:05:24,230
and he's also trained by
his dad and now it's crazy.

6954
03:05:25,070 --> 03:05:26,390
Most most of us,

6955
03:05:26,391 --> 03:05:26,691
father,

6956
03:05:26,691 --> 03:05:29,060
son relationships are tough to
bring someone else into men.

6957
03:05:29,150 --> 03:05:30,020
They figured it out.

6958
03:05:30,620 --> 03:05:30,920
Yeah,

6959
03:05:30,920 --> 03:05:31,970
they must have figured it out.

6960
03:05:32,550 --> 03:05:33,321
But he's a,

6961
03:05:33,321 --> 03:05:38,321
he's an interesting thing
because he brings a totally
new sort of a style to the

6962
03:05:39,861 --> 03:05:40,880
top of the heap.

6963
03:05:41,090 --> 03:05:44,270
Like there's no on the top of the heap
that mimics that we've had the wrestlers

6964
03:05:44,271 --> 03:05:45,350
before and you know,

6965
03:05:45,351 --> 03:05:46,670
the Matt Hughes,

6966
03:05:46,671 --> 03:05:48,320
Johnny Hunter and Johnny Hendricks,

6967
03:05:48,321 --> 03:05:49,730
like really powerful wrestlers.

6968
03:05:49,731 --> 03:05:49,881
You know,

6969
03:05:49,881 --> 03:05:53,030
Matt Hughes would get more submissions
and a lot of ground and pound victories.

6970
03:05:53,031 --> 03:05:55,550
And Johnny Hendricks got a
lot of standup victories,

6971
03:05:55,580 --> 03:05:59,450
a lot of standup chaos like that crazy
Fitch Kayo and the Martin Kampmann Kale.

6972
03:06:00,170 --> 03:06:04,850
Johnny had some ridiculous one
lefthand the bomb Kaos Jesus.

6973
03:06:05,090 --> 03:06:05,451
So there's,

6974
03:06:05,451 --> 03:06:06,530
they're different in that way,

6975
03:06:06,710 --> 03:06:07,580
but um,

6976
03:06:07,640 --> 03:06:07,940
it's,

6977
03:06:07,940 --> 03:06:08,960
it's real interesting.

6978
03:06:08,961 --> 03:06:12,680
We see a guy that you
haven't seen before really,

6979
03:06:12,681 --> 03:06:17,681
and a karate guy like wonder boy with his
crazy undefeated kickboxing record and

6980
03:06:18,231 --> 03:06:20,750
you can't figure it out because
no one's figured it out.

6981
03:06:20,751 --> 03:06:21,110
Really.

6982
03:06:21,110 --> 03:06:24,430
George Saint Pierre told me he's the
best tracker that he's ever sparred one.

6983
03:06:24,460 --> 03:06:25,160
Ha Ha.

6984
03:06:25,160 --> 03:06:25,851
I'm telling you,

6985
03:06:25,851 --> 03:06:26,260
man,

6986
03:06:26,260 --> 03:06:28,730
towards St Pier brought him
to Denver and we were like,

6987
03:06:28,731 --> 03:06:29,640
who's this skinny kid?

6988
03:06:29,640 --> 03:06:29,891
And like,

6989
03:06:29,891 --> 03:06:30,880
oh all he's going to do.

6990
03:06:31,090 --> 03:06:32,930
Cause at the time he was
even thinking about MMA,

6991
03:06:33,110 --> 03:06:33,943
he's just striking.

6992
03:06:34,550 --> 03:06:37,910
How have you seen rush hour where Chris
Tucker eats kicked in the face of guy?

6993
03:06:37,940 --> 03:06:38,330
Which one?

6994
03:06:38,330 --> 03:06:39,163
Y'All did it.

6995
03:06:39,530 --> 03:06:41,720
I'm telling you when he's sparred with us,

6996
03:06:41,870 --> 03:06:42,550
I was like,

6997
03:06:42,550 --> 03:06:43,383
ah,

6998
03:06:43,430 --> 03:06:45,530
I don't know shit.

6999
03:06:46,190 --> 03:06:47,900
I wasn't the only one that felt like that.

7000
03:06:47,901 --> 03:06:48,830
George St Pier,

7001
03:06:48,950 --> 03:06:49,780
Nate,

7002
03:06:49,780 --> 03:06:51,710
Shane and Neymar car,

7003
03:06:51,770 --> 03:06:53,460
all of us went in and just got raw,

7004
03:06:53,461 --> 03:06:54,940
wracked,

7005
03:06:55,230 --> 03:06:55,650
wracked.

7006
03:06:55,650 --> 03:06:57,060
Well he's looked like amateurs.

7007
03:06:57,090 --> 03:07:02,090
He's the best example of someone that
knows that other style and implements it

7008
03:07:02,160 --> 03:07:07,010
in an MMA fight because that's style
is always been a question mark.

7009
03:07:07,011 --> 03:07:07,261
I was like,

7010
03:07:07,261 --> 03:07:10,370
how come some of these
national karate champion Dudes,

7011
03:07:10,390 --> 03:07:12,930
I haven't gotten into
MMA because if they do,

7012
03:07:12,931 --> 03:07:15,600
they'll sport karate guys
and the sport taekwondo guys,

7013
03:07:15,810 --> 03:07:19,590
more of this poor karate guys on a lot
of ways because some of their matches a

7014
03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:20,910
concentrate more on punches.

7015
03:07:21,060 --> 03:07:23,430
A lot of them are swift
punches to the face,

7016
03:07:23,431 --> 03:07:25,410
like even a sport punch.

7017
03:07:25,470 --> 03:07:25,830
Uh,

7018
03:07:25,830 --> 03:07:26,071
you know,

7019
03:07:26,071 --> 03:07:27,210
one point karate guys,

7020
03:07:27,211 --> 03:07:27,821
the point crying,

7021
03:07:27,821 --> 03:07:28,510
we can tag a guy,

7022
03:07:28,510 --> 03:07:29,343
they stop,

7023
03:07:29,510 --> 03:07:33,120
they'd still concentrate more on punches
to the face then the taekwondo guys.

7024
03:07:33,210 --> 03:07:33,511
So,

7025
03:07:33,511 --> 03:07:36,990
but you can get like a really good
combination of the two of those techniques

7026
03:07:37,470 --> 03:07:39,420
and if those guys get into MMA,

7027
03:07:39,421 --> 03:07:39,901
man they,

7028
03:07:39,901 --> 03:07:43,710
they're so hard to hit because they'll
sport karate guys are used to just

7029
03:07:43,950 --> 03:07:47,430
jumping back and forth on each
other and the judge Calloway.

7030
03:07:47,730 --> 03:07:47,941
Yeah,

7031
03:07:47,941 --> 03:07:48,900
that's their whole shit.

7032
03:07:48,960 --> 03:07:52,160
I think waterboy is going to
sit the blueprint for some
of those guys because he

7033
03:07:52,161 --> 03:07:55,110
and golfed himself into
grappling to Conor.

7034
03:07:55,111 --> 03:07:56,880
Mcgregor is considered one of those guys.

7035
03:07:56,881 --> 03:07:57,270
Right.

7036
03:07:57,270 --> 03:07:59,150
I mean any other background?

7037
03:07:59,420 --> 03:08:00,253
When I was,

7038
03:08:00,390 --> 03:08:02,280
when I was really good at taekwondo,

7039
03:08:02,281 --> 03:08:03,810
when I was winning state championships,

7040
03:08:03,840 --> 03:08:05,550
I had a karate match.

7041
03:08:05,550 --> 03:08:06,720
I took a fight,

7042
03:08:07,180 --> 03:08:07,901
a tournament,

7043
03:08:07,901 --> 03:08:12,090
a point karate tournament and I fought
this dude named mafia Holloway who was

7044
03:08:12,091 --> 03:08:16,350
like this big time point karate
guy and this guy fuck me up.

7045
03:08:16,650 --> 03:08:17,483
I couldn't,

7046
03:08:17,790 --> 03:08:22,320
I couldn't get ahold of them because I
was used to like continuous style kicking

7047
03:08:22,370 --> 03:08:22,770
this.

7048
03:08:22,770 --> 03:08:24,060
It wasn't used to this,

7049
03:08:24,240 --> 03:08:27,510
this Darden's smashed start
in with a punch to the face.

7050
03:08:27,720 --> 03:08:29,240
They big would Darden on you.

7051
03:08:29,270 --> 03:08:30,480
Then everything would stop and you go,

7052
03:08:30,540 --> 03:08:31,290
Oh,

7053
03:08:31,290 --> 03:08:31,531
okay,

7054
03:08:31,531 --> 03:08:32,700
I'm way behind on this.

7055
03:08:32,701 --> 03:08:33,840
Like I should have trained for this.

7056
03:08:34,250 --> 03:08:37,590
I think I trained for like kickboxing
or for taekwondo and this guy had this

7057
03:08:37,800 --> 03:08:38,940
totally different thing.

7058
03:08:38,941 --> 03:08:39,950
And I remember um,

7059
03:08:39,960 --> 03:08:41,070
from that one match,

7060
03:08:41,310 --> 03:08:42,090
which uh,

7061
03:08:42,090 --> 03:08:42,301
you know,

7062
03:08:42,301 --> 03:08:43,950
it didn't last very long and I didn't,

7063
03:08:43,980 --> 03:08:44,880
I didn't get hurt in it,

7064
03:08:44,881 --> 03:08:45,960
but I definitely got tagged.

7065
03:08:45,961 --> 03:08:48,960
He tagged me with the front leg side
kick to the body and a couple of other

7066
03:08:48,961 --> 03:08:49,230
things.

7067
03:08:49,230 --> 03:08:50,130
But I remember thinking like,

7068
03:08:50,131 --> 03:08:50,730
man,

7069
03:08:50,730 --> 03:08:54,900
I got to rethink my whole approach to
darting in and out because they don't like

7070
03:08:54,901 --> 03:08:59,280
taekwondo guys don't necessarily do that
to the same with the same explosion,

7071
03:08:59,281 --> 03:09:00,720
the same distance covering.

7072
03:09:01,020 --> 03:09:04,620
And then I remember thinking those guys
are really hard to catch and those guys

7073
03:09:04,621 --> 03:09:06,180
to get really good at that thing.

7074
03:09:06,181 --> 03:09:07,860
And you've seen it with that kid in,

7075
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:10,320
in Beltour Michael Page,

7076
03:09:10,680 --> 03:09:11,460
Michael Page,

7077
03:09:11,460 --> 03:09:12,390
Michael Fan page,

7078
03:09:12,570 --> 03:09:13,560
same thing.

7079
03:09:13,561 --> 03:09:14,690
You're seeing the same thing.

7080
03:09:14,730 --> 03:09:16,680
Like to see him against
tougher competition.

7081
03:09:16,970 --> 03:09:18,500
Did you grow up doing karate is yes.

7082
03:09:18,520 --> 03:09:20,580
He's a bad motherfucker dude.

7083
03:09:20,850 --> 03:09:25,850
He says karate champion in his last
fight he got fucking do put up his

7084
03:09:27,500 --> 03:09:28,240
highlights is,

7085
03:09:28,240 --> 03:09:29,070
is um,

7086
03:09:29,070 --> 03:09:32,580
Wikipedia so we can find out
what his actual credentials are.

7087
03:09:33,030 --> 03:09:35,340
The Herald tonight cowboy.

7088
03:09:35,550 --> 03:09:35,821
Yes,

7089
03:09:35,821 --> 03:09:36,654
absolutely.

7090
03:09:36,660 --> 03:09:37,493
Absolutely.

7091
03:09:37,620 --> 03:09:38,460
But you know what man,

7092
03:09:38,490 --> 03:09:39,480
that Michael Van and page,

7093
03:09:39,690 --> 03:09:42,560
I don't want to break
from him because he's no,

7094
03:09:42,561 --> 03:09:42,671
no,

7095
03:09:42,671 --> 03:09:43,320
it's okay.

7096
03:09:43,320 --> 03:09:43,861
But he's,

7097
03:09:43,861 --> 03:09:45,000
he's something new.

7098
03:09:45,060 --> 03:09:46,230
He's a unique guy,

7099
03:09:46,231 --> 03:09:46,530
man.

7100
03:09:46,530 --> 03:09:47,370
No one can figure him out.

7101
03:09:47,400 --> 03:09:47,911
Well he's,

7102
03:09:47,911 --> 03:09:49,410
he's like way,

7103
03:09:49,620 --> 03:09:51,090
way above the guys.

7104
03:09:51,091 --> 03:09:52,110
He's fought so far.

7105
03:09:52,111 --> 03:09:52,631
They just cool.

7106
03:09:52,631 --> 03:09:53,490
You don't law.

7107
03:09:53,740 --> 03:09:54,573
I understand,

7108
03:09:54,580 --> 03:09:56,700
but they don't belong in there with them.

7109
03:09:57,070 --> 03:09:57,671
New Ideas.

7110
03:09:57,671 --> 03:09:58,600
Amazing man.

7111
03:09:59,180 --> 03:10:00,460
That's how it guys should be built.

7112
03:10:00,461 --> 03:10:01,650
What are you looking at looking at it?

7113
03:10:01,690 --> 03:10:03,800
It says Wikipedia a record.

7114
03:10:03,880 --> 03:10:04,031
Well,

7115
03:10:04,031 --> 03:10:04,661
let's go to the what?

7116
03:10:04,661 --> 03:10:05,230
He's um,

7117
03:10:05,230 --> 03:10:05,411
his,

7118
03:10:05,411 --> 03:10:05,471
uh,

7119
03:10:05,471 --> 03:10:06,304
credentials are,

7120
03:10:07,150 --> 03:10:08,150
go back to what it said,

7121
03:10:08,210 --> 03:10:08,970
but just karate.

7122
03:10:08,970 --> 03:10:09,371
It's good.

7123
03:10:09,371 --> 03:10:09,941
It's good.

7124
03:10:09,941 --> 03:10:14,530
He's not fighting criminal creme because
right now he's building his experience

7125
03:10:14,560 --> 03:10:15,240
and he's you,

7126
03:10:15,240 --> 03:10:16,450
he's getting his style down.

7127
03:10:17,450 --> 03:10:18,450
It's just does it say here?

7128
03:10:18,470 --> 03:10:18,840
Timing.

7129
03:10:18,840 --> 03:10:19,673
Hi.

7130
03:10:19,900 --> 03:10:20,561
Can we get larger?

7131
03:10:20,561 --> 03:10:21,394
What does it say?

7132
03:10:21,490 --> 03:10:23,740
It says page describes the
discipline is not karate,

7133
03:10:23,741 --> 03:10:24,580
not talk window.

7134
03:10:24,581 --> 03:10:29,581
It's a hands down kickboxing style that
likens himself to a matter of don't fuck

7135
03:10:32,861 --> 03:10:33,520
wrote this.

7136
03:10:33,520 --> 03:10:34,870
We can't have fans.

7137
03:10:34,871 --> 03:10:35,081
Right.

7138
03:10:35,081 --> 03:10:35,914
Wikipedia.

7139
03:10:36,050 --> 03:10:38,650
I movement based fighter as game plans.

7140
03:10:39,340 --> 03:10:40,150
This is weird.

7141
03:10:40,150 --> 03:10:40,990
It's terrible.

7142
03:10:41,390 --> 03:10:43,090
Regularly karate.

7143
03:10:43,950 --> 03:10:47,240
His own style have credentials.

7144
03:10:47,740 --> 03:10:50,950
They have like something like
like awards or some shit.

7145
03:10:50,951 --> 03:10:52,270
Like does he have any kick round?

7146
03:10:52,271 --> 03:10:52,950
There you go.

7147
03:10:52,950 --> 03:10:56,410
Point karate background
clicking kickbox in her career.

7148
03:10:57,400 --> 03:10:58,000
Wow.

7149
03:10:58,000 --> 03:10:59,770
Am I really wrong about his um,

7150
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:01,660
point karate background.

7151
03:11:01,661 --> 03:11:03,190
Did he never have kickboxing?

7152
03:11:04,030 --> 03:11:04,870
Kickboxing.

7153
03:11:05,050 --> 03:11:05,883
Okay.

7154
03:11:06,670 --> 03:11:07,720
I knew he had that too,

7155
03:11:07,721 --> 03:11:09,220
but I thought he was like a condition.

7156
03:11:10,630 --> 03:11:12,100
I may have thought he was too.

7157
03:11:12,250 --> 03:11:13,083
I might've made it up.

7158
03:11:13,210 --> 03:11:14,043
Maybe you told me.

7159
03:11:15,820 --> 03:11:20,820
Maybe I told you as an English kickboxer
Rod Credit Karthika what does it say?

7160
03:11:21,971 --> 03:11:22,860
Sport crowd.

7161
03:11:22,861 --> 03:11:23,680
A teacup.

7162
03:11:23,680 --> 03:11:24,071
Okay.

7163
03:11:24,071 --> 03:11:24,450
He did?

7164
03:11:24,450 --> 03:11:24,980
Yeah.

7165
03:11:24,980 --> 03:11:25,813
Okay.

7166
03:11:26,030 --> 03:11:26,550
All right.

7167
03:11:26,550 --> 03:11:26,920
Yeah.

7168
03:11:26,920 --> 03:11:27,820
Hell that's exactly it.

7169
03:11:27,821 --> 03:11:29,100
Sport Karate Guy.

7170
03:11:29,101 --> 03:11:29,700
Weird.

7171
03:11:29,700 --> 03:11:29,920
Yeah.

7172
03:11:29,920 --> 03:11:30,560
I thought,

7173
03:11:30,560 --> 03:11:30,690
well,

7174
03:11:30,690 --> 03:11:31,210
I don't know what,

7175
03:11:31,210 --> 03:11:32,170
what he accomplished.

7176
03:11:32,171 --> 03:11:34,410
I thought it was like a
very high level guy friends.

7177
03:11:34,490 --> 03:11:36,350
Like he's just a guy who
took a taekwondo class.

7178
03:11:36,800 --> 03:11:37,633
I don't think so.

7179
03:11:38,260 --> 03:11:39,840
Rex Quando it just fucking

7180
03:11:41,350 --> 03:11:43,210
karate that grow into that.

7181
03:11:43,270 --> 03:11:45,180
I think he hates taekwondo
according to that one.

7182
03:11:46,290 --> 03:11:46,991
Carrot Tika,

7183
03:11:46,991 --> 03:11:47,350
right?

7184
03:11:47,350 --> 03:11:48,520
Is that what it turned Tika?

7185
03:11:48,610 --> 03:11:50,960
I think it said watch
eastbound and down in

7186
03:11:52,990 --> 03:11:53,920
and then just fucking

7187
03:11:55,450 --> 03:11:57,040
kick box on the weekend it down.

7188
03:11:57,041 --> 03:11:57,661
It was um,

7189
03:11:57,661 --> 03:11:58,510
what was the fucking

7190
03:12:02,310 --> 03:12:03,790
what the fuck's it called Eddie?

7191
03:12:04,270 --> 03:12:05,610
He wants the best thing.

7192
03:12:05,630 --> 03:12:06,463
Got His black belt.

7193
03:12:06,760 --> 03:12:07,593
That fucking,

7194
03:12:07,930 --> 03:12:08,763
what was that?

7195
03:12:09,700 --> 03:12:11,180
He was working with uh,

7196
03:12:11,490 --> 03:12:11,911
an a,

7197
03:12:11,911 --> 03:12:15,460
an association called the points fighting
League where it was a team points

7198
03:12:15,461 --> 03:12:16,150
league.

7199
03:12:16,150 --> 03:12:16,930
Oh whoa.

7200
03:12:16,930 --> 03:12:17,920
Team points league.

7201
03:12:19,270 --> 03:12:20,830
Look at this cowboy with no shirt on,

7202
03:12:20,831 --> 03:12:24,400
but the cowboy hat on powerful
allowed that to happen.

7203
03:12:24,550 --> 03:12:26,410
How many gang guys are
jerking off to this right now?

7204
03:12:26,411 --> 03:12:26,950
1 million.

7205
03:12:26,950 --> 03:12:29,080
Seven more than seven.

7206
03:12:29,110 --> 03:12:29,381
Well,

7207
03:12:29,381 --> 03:12:30,214
I met 7 million

7208
03:12:37,060 --> 03:12:39,630
cobble Brennan job.

7209
03:12:41,320 --> 03:12:42,880
What was the other question that we had?

7210
03:12:42,980 --> 03:12:43,770
I forgot.

7211
03:12:43,770 --> 03:12:43,930
Hey,

7212
03:12:43,930 --> 03:12:44,980
I'll tell you what was fun.

7213
03:12:44,981 --> 03:12:46,420
Is Calorie.

7214
03:12:46,430 --> 03:12:46,901
Seriously.

7215
03:12:46,901 --> 03:12:51,901
I took him on Abbot Kinney and took him
to creation and he's just fucking so

7216
03:12:52,310 --> 03:12:53,143
raw.

7217
03:12:53,600 --> 03:12:54,980
I didn't know the green juice over here.

7218
03:12:54,981 --> 03:12:55,221
I'm like,

7219
03:12:55,221 --> 03:12:56,210
hey bro.

7220
03:12:56,420 --> 03:12:57,730
Fucking relaxed,

7221
03:12:57,731 --> 03:12:58,160
man.

7222
03:12:58,160 --> 03:12:59,850
How about you stop selling them out on TV?

7223
03:12:59,870 --> 03:13:00,300
Nah,

7224
03:13:00,300 --> 03:13:01,180
that's cowboy man.

7225
03:13:01,210 --> 03:13:02,043
He's the best.

7226
03:13:02,210 --> 03:13:05,780
He's the best cowboy and Abbot
Kinney mixed together like water,

7227
03:13:05,781 --> 03:13:06,110
noise.

7228
03:13:06,110 --> 03:13:07,660
He's fucking combinations by law.

7229
03:13:07,760 --> 03:13:08,630
I have to God,

7230
03:13:08,840 --> 03:13:10,190
he was the highlight of the night.

7231
03:13:11,090 --> 03:13:12,970
He dismantled coatings,

7232
03:13:13,310 --> 03:13:13,910
man,

7233
03:13:13,910 --> 03:13:14,541
it's too quick,

7234
03:13:14,541 --> 03:13:14,811
man.

7235
03:13:14,811 --> 03:13:14,990
Well,

7236
03:13:14,990 --> 03:13:16,940
some calculating how good his angles are,

7237
03:13:16,941 --> 03:13:17,301
man.

7238
03:13:17,301 --> 03:13:17,570
I agree.

7239
03:13:17,570 --> 03:13:19,430
It was those two right
hands and and get touched.

7240
03:13:19,431 --> 03:13:22,190
Either dangerous fight dude.

7241
03:13:22,191 --> 03:13:23,210
He beat him down.

7242
03:13:23,540 --> 03:13:24,650
That was ferocious.

7243
03:13:24,860 --> 03:13:28,130
I really liked Donald Cerrone at one
seven do you remember the first fight when

7244
03:13:28,131 --> 03:13:30,260
that girl kicked the other girl in
the titty and she turned around?

7245
03:13:30,350 --> 03:13:31,183
That's not what happened.

7246
03:13:31,220 --> 03:13:35,150
What she did want down and
she pulled her bra or titty.

7247
03:13:35,151 --> 03:13:36,680
Got Breast.

7248
03:13:38,900 --> 03:13:39,351
It's illegal.

7249
03:13:39,351 --> 03:13:39,831
It's illegal.

7250
03:13:39,831 --> 03:13:40,310
Illegal.

7251
03:13:40,310 --> 03:13:41,000
It is illegal.

7252
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:42,200
I think what happened was,

7253
03:13:42,750 --> 03:13:45,140
it's coming down was she
kicked her in the face,

7254
03:13:45,260 --> 03:13:47,090
but as her footwork was coming down,

7255
03:13:47,091 --> 03:13:48,380
the foot caught the bra,

7256
03:13:48,381 --> 03:13:51,590
the Bra pulled down the Teddy and um,

7257
03:13:52,160 --> 03:13:53,480
you know what happened folks.

7258
03:13:54,020 --> 03:13:56,440
But then she did it again and
kicked her right in the solar plex.

7259
03:13:56,470 --> 03:13:56,601
Well,

7260
03:13:56,601 --> 03:13:57,261
that was a different one.

7261
03:13:57,261 --> 03:13:58,910
Girl turned around and ran.

7262
03:13:58,911 --> 03:13:59,750
She smashed her.

7263
03:14:00,110 --> 03:14:01,280
I still to this day,

7264
03:14:01,890 --> 03:14:05,990
I want to pretend that I remember a
kick before that kick to the body.

7265
03:14:06,470 --> 03:14:07,610
I don't know if I'm right or not,

7266
03:14:07,611 --> 03:14:09,440
but either way there's three kids.

7267
03:14:10,370 --> 03:14:11,540
There was a base of a fight.

7268
03:14:11,720 --> 03:14:12,553
It was awesome.

7269
03:14:13,190 --> 03:14:14,390
Good night of fights.

7270
03:14:14,600 --> 03:14:15,321
Fuck yeah,

7271
03:14:15,321 --> 03:14:16,154
it was

7272
03:14:17,290 --> 03:14:17,870
Callin.

7273
03:14:17,870 --> 03:14:21,340
Watched every single one
called the other one.

7274
03:14:21,820 --> 03:14:23,660
He was into every single one.

7275
03:14:23,690 --> 03:14:24,523
He was on fire.

7276
03:14:24,560 --> 03:14:25,101
He was on fire.

7277
03:14:25,101 --> 03:14:25,491
He was,

7278
03:14:25,491 --> 03:14:26,540
he was in the zone.

7279
03:14:26,541 --> 03:14:27,770
We tried to get him to shut the fuck up.

7280
03:14:27,840 --> 03:14:28,673
[inaudible] times.

7281
03:14:29,080 --> 03:14:33,050
We did many times we tried to get
them into talking fucking alligator.

7282
03:14:33,940 --> 03:14:37,250
Get Joey to make a phone
call during the main event,

7283
03:14:37,251 --> 03:14:38,210
like in the third round,

7284
03:14:38,240 --> 03:14:38,871
the fourth round,

7285
03:14:38,871 --> 03:14:41,700
like a Howard Harold Letterman giving his

7286
03:14:44,210 --> 03:14:45,110
greatest idea,

7287
03:14:45,111 --> 03:14:46,080
but that's a great idea.

7288
03:14:46,081 --> 03:14:47,040
That's a fantastic,

7289
03:14:48,740 --> 03:14:49,511
oh my God.

7290
03:14:49,511 --> 03:14:50,344
Let's stand up.

7291
03:14:50,810 --> 03:14:52,050
Eddie Bravo with the home run.

7292
03:14:52,140 --> 03:14:52,270
Yeah,

7293
03:14:52,270 --> 03:14:53,120
that's a great idea.

7294
03:14:53,360 --> 03:14:54,193
What would he say?

7295
03:14:55,850 --> 03:14:56,541
He called it in the,

7296
03:14:56,541 --> 03:15:00,170
in the fourth round is the fucking man.

7297
03:15:02,620 --> 03:15:05,120
That's an old school game
of debt type of shit.

7298
03:15:05,870 --> 03:15:06,800
Going to the corner.

7299
03:15:06,890 --> 03:15:09,740
He's going to pull out four knives
and cut his own fucking chat.

7300
03:15:10,510 --> 03:15:12,740
Come out and make foot to face bitch.

7301
03:15:13,510 --> 03:15:14,343
Well,

7302
03:15:14,410 --> 03:15:15,380
it's a great ice.

7303
03:15:15,410 --> 03:15:15,741
One of them.

7304
03:15:15,741 --> 03:15:19,280
North Carolina Christians dog ain't
never seen those people before.

7305
03:15:19,380 --> 03:15:20,213
That's on site.

7306
03:15:21,500 --> 03:15:22,400
South Carolina,

7307
03:15:22,820 --> 03:15:23,631
Carolina,

7308
03:15:23,631 --> 03:15:24,680
North Carolina,

7309
03:15:24,681 --> 03:15:25,640
East Carolina.

7310
03:15:25,641 --> 03:15:26,510
Shut the fuck up.

7311
03:15:26,830 --> 03:15:28,220
I'm trying to drop science.

7312
03:15:28,400 --> 03:15:29,233
Those people,

7313
03:15:29,340 --> 03:15:33,170
they're eating that fucking gumbo
that the crawfish in it dog.

7314
03:15:33,171 --> 03:15:34,580
It's something about the crawfish,

7315
03:15:34,940 --> 03:15:36,590
some about that hot spice dog.

7316
03:15:37,340 --> 03:15:38,790
It's a great fucking call.

7317
03:15:38,791 --> 03:15:40,730
Ready to live in the fucking swamps.

7318
03:15:40,940 --> 03:15:41,840
C'Mon man.

7319
03:15:41,930 --> 03:15:43,760
You ever see that fucking
swamp people show?

7320
03:15:45,290 --> 03:15:48,380
He would just go on some swamp
people show rant and you'd be like,

7321
03:15:48,381 --> 03:15:48,711
yes.

7322
03:15:48,711 --> 03:15:49,544
Where do start?

7323
03:15:49,880 --> 03:15:50,020
What

7324
03:15:50,020 --> 03:15:50,350
do I,

7325
03:15:50,350 --> 03:15:51,090
what do I,

7326
03:15:51,090 --> 03:15:51,923
where do I donate?

7327
03:15:53,810 --> 03:15:55,170
I'm going to try calling him right now.

7328
03:15:55,190 --> 03:15:56,023
Say

7329
03:15:57,420 --> 03:15:58,253
Yes.

7330
03:15:59,520 --> 03:16:00,220
Culture.

7331
03:16:00,220 --> 03:16:01,053
Oh my God.

7332
03:16:01,710 --> 03:16:02,850
These are really interesting man.

7333
03:16:02,851 --> 03:16:03,481
I enjoyed this.

7334
03:16:03,481 --> 03:16:04,470
I was watching this earlier,

7335
03:16:04,520 --> 03:16:05,220
but yeah,

7336
03:16:05,220 --> 03:16:08,120
it was working out and that
was watching these guys do.

7337
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:09,420
There are different,

7338
03:16:09,450 --> 03:16:09,571
uh,

7339
03:16:09,571 --> 03:16:10,051
point of view.

7340
03:16:10,051 --> 03:16:11,730
It's like what one guy has to do to win,

7341
03:16:11,930 --> 03:16:13,620
but another guy has to
do to win there could.

7342
03:16:13,621 --> 03:16:14,550
Very interesting.

7343
03:16:14,551 --> 03:16:15,241
Very good.

7344
03:16:15,241 --> 03:16:15,781
Very good.

7345
03:16:15,781 --> 03:16:17,100
I liked that a lot of the best.

7346
03:16:18,510 --> 03:16:19,800
If you watch him on ESPN,

7347
03:16:19,830 --> 03:16:21,900
I think he's just fucking
keep breaking them down.

7348
03:16:21,901 --> 03:16:22,571
Fantastic.

7349
03:16:22,571 --> 03:16:22,861
Got It.

7350
03:16:22,861 --> 03:16:23,131
You know,

7351
03:16:23,131 --> 03:16:25,290
I think who might have a slight edge?

7352
03:16:25,410 --> 03:16:26,191
Dominick Cruz,

7353
03:16:26,191 --> 03:16:27,720
I think Dominick Cruz is the best at it.

7354
03:16:28,580 --> 03:16:29,161
Dominick Cruz,

7355
03:16:29,161 --> 03:16:29,994
it's like fucking,

7356
03:16:30,140 --> 03:16:31,030
I think he's the best at it.

7357
03:16:31,031 --> 03:16:32,240
I think they're,

7358
03:16:33,030 --> 03:16:34,440
I think they're both fantastic.

7359
03:16:34,810 --> 03:16:35,643
Oh.

7360
03:16:36,290 --> 03:16:36,441
Oh.

7361
03:16:36,441 --> 03:16:37,430
You haven't even seen without

7362
03:16:39,140 --> 03:16:39,861
chaos.

7363
03:16:39,861 --> 03:16:40,730
Joey Diaz.

7364
03:16:41,980 --> 03:16:42,813
Diaz.

7365
03:16:46,710 --> 03:16:47,543
Yeah.

7366
03:16:50,430 --> 03:16:51,263
Okay.

7367
03:16:55,730 --> 03:16:57,140
Negotiate the contract.

7368
03:17:00,950 --> 03:17:03,240
He's going to have to find
those shiny shoes on again.

7369
03:17:10,470 --> 03:17:10,831
Rolling.

7370
03:17:10,831 --> 03:17:11,190
You know,

7371
03:17:11,190 --> 03:17:15,010
I know he had a magical day.

7372
03:17:15,660 --> 03:17:16,740
That dude is great.

7373
03:17:17,160 --> 03:17:17,550
I mean,

7374
03:17:17,550 --> 03:17:19,100
you know what do you want him to me?

7375
03:17:19,110 --> 03:17:19,943
He's a fucking,

7376
03:17:20,130 --> 03:17:20,963
and he's in there.

7377
03:17:21,390 --> 03:17:22,630
He just can't beat those aren't.

7378
03:17:22,640 --> 03:17:23,300
Yep.

7379
03:17:23,300 --> 03:17:26,750
Do you think that Donald Cerrone
is better at one 70 Joey?

7380
03:17:27,760 --> 03:17:29,730
I didn't really watch him throw.

7381
03:17:29,740 --> 03:17:30,790
He fights so much.

7382
03:17:30,791 --> 03:17:32,160
It's like us doing stand up.

7383
03:17:33,760 --> 03:17:34,580
True.

7384
03:17:34,580 --> 03:17:35,190
That's true.

7385
03:17:35,190 --> 03:17:37,320
You know he loses water every five.

7386
03:17:37,321 --> 03:17:39,270
One of the every six he's
doing something right.

7387
03:17:39,630 --> 03:17:41,940
I don't know if he's in
Greg Jackson's camp anymore.

7388
03:17:42,630 --> 03:17:43,463
He does.

7389
03:17:43,760 --> 03:17:44,593
He still is.

7390
03:17:44,790 --> 03:17:45,450
He still does.

7391
03:17:45,450 --> 03:17:46,020
He does.

7392
03:17:46,020 --> 03:17:47,280
He has his own camp too.

7393
03:17:47,281 --> 03:17:49,620
He's got this thing called
bad motherfucker ranch.

7394
03:17:49,830 --> 03:17:51,450
He's got a ranch in New Mexico.

7395
03:17:51,780 --> 03:17:52,970
It's close to Jackson,

7396
03:17:52,971 --> 03:17:53,804
so yeah.

7397
03:17:54,950 --> 03:17:55,783
No I didn't.

7398
03:17:55,860 --> 03:17:56,621
I'm sorry man.

7399
03:17:56,621 --> 03:17:57,580
I had to do a benefit.

7400
03:17:58,090 --> 03:17:58,871
It was a nightmare.

7401
03:17:58,871 --> 03:17:59,940
They had no air conditioning.

7402
03:18:02,280 --> 03:18:03,270
That's the requirement.

7403
03:18:05,320 --> 03:18:05,490
Oh,

7404
03:18:05,490 --> 03:18:06,330
that's ridiculous.

7405
03:18:06,331 --> 03:18:07,530
You can't have hot comedy.

7406
03:18:07,830 --> 03:18:08,730
You can have hot yoga,

7407
03:18:09,150 --> 03:18:09,983
hot comedy.

7408
03:18:10,320 --> 03:18:10,621
Oh,

7409
03:18:10,621 --> 03:18:11,241
we fucked.

7410
03:18:11,241 --> 03:18:12,630
It was like doing comedy and Philly.

7411
03:18:14,940 --> 03:18:16,810
He has always done that.

7412
03:18:17,070 --> 03:18:17,680
No,

7413
03:18:17,680 --> 03:18:19,300
I never noticed really helium,

7414
03:18:19,301 --> 03:18:22,150
the fucking hair is always last week.

7415
03:18:22,420 --> 03:18:23,260
It was working with,

7416
03:18:23,261 --> 03:18:24,094
sorry,

7417
03:18:25,150 --> 03:18:26,890
so it was fucking hot dog.

7418
03:18:26,891 --> 03:18:27,570
I'm happy I'm done.

7419
03:18:27,570 --> 03:18:28,403
I tell him

7420
03:18:29,740 --> 03:18:30,131
everything.

7421
03:18:30,131 --> 03:18:30,900
All right up there.

7422
03:18:30,900 --> 03:18:31,740
Everything's beautiful,

7423
03:18:31,750 --> 03:18:32,190
man.

7424
03:18:32,190 --> 03:18:33,210
We must your brother

7425
03:18:33,310 --> 03:18:33,490
then.

7426
03:18:33,490 --> 03:18:38,490
Right now what happened was some fucked
up because it taped and the auto racing

7427
03:18:38,680 --> 03:18:39,513
instead.

7428
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:40,673
Oh yeah.

7429
03:18:42,980 --> 03:18:43,813
Yeah.

7430
03:18:43,860 --> 03:18:43,980
Are

7431
03:18:43,980 --> 03:18:47,770
Racing and I'm catching the
flight now with wood one before.

7432
03:18:47,860 --> 03:18:48,130
Yeah.

7433
03:18:48,130 --> 03:18:49,530
Joey really surprised me.

7434
03:18:49,610 --> 03:18:52,940
There was some crazy thing that happened
when Fox sports one at Fox sports two

7435
03:18:53,060 --> 03:18:54,160
Jamie nailed it.

7436
03:18:54,200 --> 03:18:56,600
It changed over while we were watching it.

7437
03:18:58,500 --> 03:19:00,430
That's what happened
to cause saw the girl.

7438
03:19:01,420 --> 03:19:02,021
Yeah,

7439
03:19:02,021 --> 03:19:02,501
I'll shut up.

7440
03:19:02,501 --> 03:19:04,120
What's your fucking car started coming in?

7441
03:19:09,620 --> 03:19:10,480
I don't give a fuck.

7442
03:19:10,490 --> 03:19:11,323
You know why?

7443
03:19:12,910 --> 03:19:14,030
Cause I also trade

7444
03:19:16,590 --> 03:19:17,590
fucking brilliant.

7445
03:19:17,591 --> 03:19:18,220
Joey.

7446
03:19:18,220 --> 03:19:18,971
Where's that on?

7447
03:19:18,971 --> 03:19:19,671
How do you take that?

7448
03:19:19,671 --> 03:19:21,480
Is that on 30 for 30 on ESPN?

7449
03:19:22,990 --> 03:19:24,720
You know what the beauty is about?

7450
03:19:24,721 --> 03:19:24,901
Oh,

7451
03:19:24,901 --> 03:19:26,010
Jane made the Americans.

7452
03:19:26,140 --> 03:19:27,340
Brian cows aren't even here.

7453
03:19:27,400 --> 03:19:28,480
This is Brendan and Sean.

7454
03:19:28,481 --> 03:19:29,314
Joey.

7455
03:19:29,350 --> 03:19:29,710
Oh,

7456
03:19:29,710 --> 03:19:30,800
how you doing Mr [inaudible]?

7457
03:19:30,860 --> 03:19:31,501
What's up bro?

7458
03:19:31,501 --> 03:19:35,670
What's beautiful about this show
is please explain it to Joe Rogan.

7459
03:19:36,210 --> 03:19:37,043
I'm right here.

7460
03:19:37,920 --> 03:19:39,050
That could've been Oj.

7461
03:19:39,060 --> 03:19:40,350
That could have been Brad Pitt.

7462
03:19:40,860 --> 03:19:42,390
That could have been Justin Bieber.

7463
03:19:42,990 --> 03:19:47,340
You gotta Watch your Joe Rogan because
it breaks it down all the way to,

7464
03:19:47,341 --> 03:19:51,540
he was at USC and the
most interesting part,

7465
03:19:51,541 --> 03:19:54,150
Brendan shop him when fucking Muhammad,

7466
03:19:54,151 --> 03:19:56,730
I leave put that thing together
for the black athletes.

7467
03:19:56,870 --> 03:19:57,141
Yeah.

7468
03:19:57,141 --> 03:19:57,651
And he said,

7469
03:19:57,651 --> 03:19:58,131
fuck that.

7470
03:19:58,131 --> 03:19:58,941
I'm not black.

7471
03:19:58,941 --> 03:20:01,520
I'm Oj and separate himself on blacks.

7472
03:20:02,910 --> 03:20:04,020
You but you know,

7473
03:20:04,021 --> 03:20:04,800
grow.

7474
03:20:04,800 --> 03:20:05,850
I think John,

7475
03:20:06,030 --> 03:20:06,570
uh,

7476
03:20:06,570 --> 03:20:06,900
uh,

7477
03:20:06,900 --> 03:20:07,560
the,

7478
03:20:07,560 --> 03:20:08,393
the uh,

7479
03:20:08,700 --> 03:20:10,710
the cop has the best analogy.

7480
03:20:11,220 --> 03:20:12,053
The old check,

7481
03:20:12,300 --> 03:20:13,260
big John McCarthy.

7482
03:20:14,180 --> 03:20:16,860
He's got the best analogy
because in one of the,

7483
03:20:17,050 --> 03:20:21,470
in one of the things Mark Burman went to
his house before he had a baseball bat

7484
03:20:21,471 --> 03:20:25,280
in his hand and mark for him and told
him twice to put the fucking back down.

7485
03:20:25,690 --> 03:20:30,150
And the third time he had to take out
his stick and that whole chain was just

7486
03:20:30,151 --> 03:20:30,811
glaring at him.

7487
03:20:30,811 --> 03:20:35,070
And then he came back and they said
that when that guy dies that to take his

7488
03:20:35,071 --> 03:20:38,490
brain because he's definitely got the
same shit that all these other things.

7489
03:20:41,090 --> 03:20:42,380
What CTE,

7490
03:20:43,370 --> 03:20:43,920
if,

7491
03:20:43,920 --> 03:20:44,753
if,

7492
03:20:44,960 --> 03:20:47,520
if the trial was today,

7493
03:20:47,521 --> 03:20:49,930
they would argue CT clinically insane.

7494
03:20:54,660 --> 03:20:56,130
That motherfucker is crazy.

7495
03:20:57,830 --> 03:20:58,663
He's crazy.

7496
03:20:58,940 --> 03:20:59,420
What does it,

7497
03:20:59,420 --> 03:21:00,620
what does CTE stands for?

7498
03:21:00,621 --> 03:21:03,710
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
or something like that.

7499
03:21:03,711 --> 03:21:04,390
Is that what it is?

7500
03:21:04,390 --> 03:21:05,223
Yeah,

7501
03:21:08,830 --> 03:21:09,663
they break down.

7502
03:21:10,260 --> 03:21:11,180
It's tough to

7503
03:21:12,810 --> 03:21:13,950
chronic traumatic

7504
03:21:15,630 --> 03:21:17,310
encephalopathy punch.

7505
03:21:17,630 --> 03:21:17,950
Okay.

7506
03:21:17,950 --> 03:21:18,480
What that is,

7507
03:21:18,480 --> 03:21:20,070
and nobody could have done something.

7508
03:21:20,610 --> 03:21:21,443
Brendan shops,

7509
03:21:22,980 --> 03:21:24,090
you bet your sweet ass.

7510
03:21:24,091 --> 03:21:24,924
I did Jelly.

7511
03:21:27,220 --> 03:21:28,130
They broke it down.

7512
03:21:28,131 --> 03:21:28,964
Joe Rogan.

7513
03:21:29,110 --> 03:21:31,600
How's animalistic what he did to

7514
03:21:34,220 --> 03:21:36,500
the rule of biscuits?

7515
03:21:41,750 --> 03:21:44,040
No fade or rush.

7516
03:21:45,900 --> 03:21:46,290
Oh,

7517
03:21:46,290 --> 03:21:47,850
that old Russian track team.

7518
03:21:52,940 --> 03:21:53,320
No,

7519
03:21:53,320 --> 03:21:53,730
Bro.

7520
03:21:53,730 --> 03:21:54,563
That was,

7521
03:21:58,060 --> 03:22:01,670
went to him and got him in a
choke hold and just drawn it.

7522
03:22:01,730 --> 03:22:02,563
Slammed his bro

7523
03:22:02,690 --> 03:22:03,523
allegedly.

7524
03:22:05,120 --> 03:22:05,300
Oh,

7525
03:22:05,300 --> 03:22:06,133
they broke it down.

7526
03:22:07,310 --> 03:22:08,210
How do they know he did it?

7527
03:22:08,211 --> 03:22:09,044
100%

7528
03:22:10,140 --> 03:22:10,351
well,

7529
03:22:10,351 --> 03:22:11,400
it's not him that he did it.

7530
03:22:11,401 --> 03:22:11,890
How,

7531
03:22:11,890 --> 03:22:12,960
how anybody would do it.

7532
03:22:13,500 --> 03:22:14,460
This is what they said.

7533
03:22:14,461 --> 03:22:15,690
How can anybody would do it?

7534
03:22:16,120 --> 03:22:16,540
Okay.

7535
03:22:16,540 --> 03:22:17,210
No Way.

7536
03:22:17,210 --> 03:22:18,830
So they went through everything.

7537
03:22:19,190 --> 03:22:20,000
Yeah.

7538
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:20,760
Right.

7539
03:22:20,760 --> 03:22:22,140
Then he went and choked him.

7540
03:22:22,380 --> 03:22:23,213
Caught him.

7541
03:22:23,780 --> 03:22:24,730
He was on the floor,

7542
03:22:24,731 --> 03:22:25,830
I guess two fences,

7543
03:22:25,831 --> 03:22:26,630
Bro.

7544
03:22:26,630 --> 03:22:27,463
I'm not doubting that.

7545
03:22:28,060 --> 03:22:29,780
I'm not doubting that
they figured this out.

7546
03:22:29,810 --> 03:22:32,230
He did it 100% I'm not
downing and he can't hear me.

7547
03:22:32,410 --> 03:22:34,000
I'm not doubting that
they figured this out.

7548
03:22:34,001 --> 03:22:36,010
But you know the one
thing that perplexes me,

7549
03:22:36,011 --> 03:22:37,180
is it a dummy?

7550
03:22:37,450 --> 03:22:37,780
How do,

7551
03:22:37,780 --> 03:22:41,860
how do they figure that out by looking
at where the bodies are like by the marks

7552
03:22:41,861 --> 03:22:42,611
on the ground?

7553
03:22:42,611 --> 03:22:44,500
Like how did they figure
that a blood at his house.

7554
03:22:44,501 --> 03:22:45,370
At her house,

7555
03:22:45,970 --> 03:22:46,803
right.

7556
03:22:47,430 --> 03:22:48,263
Joe Rogan.

7557
03:22:51,200 --> 03:22:53,000
Oh,

7558
03:22:53,060 --> 03:22:54,340
his hands were all fucked.

7559
03:22:58,570 --> 03:22:59,820
Debbie cut his leg or something.

7560
03:22:59,970 --> 03:23:00,630
Yeah.

7561
03:23:00,630 --> 03:23:01,710
And also Joey,

7562
03:23:01,711 --> 03:23:05,250
they're saying it was such a hate crime
that when he hit her in the throat,

7563
03:23:05,251 --> 03:23:06,840
it basically decapitated or,

7564
03:23:06,900 --> 03:23:11,490
so they're saying that it would
have to be such a passion of crime.

7565
03:23:11,610 --> 03:23:16,130
Like you had such a love for when you
hit someone that hard to sever their math

7566
03:23:16,140 --> 03:23:17,790
and almost cut her head off.

7567
03:23:17,910 --> 03:23:19,470
It had to been a passion of crime.

7568
03:23:19,530 --> 03:23:20,191
Could you imagine?

7569
03:23:20,191 --> 03:23:20,910
Let's assume,

7570
03:23:20,910 --> 03:23:21,910
let's assume that you did it.

7571
03:23:27,730 --> 03:23:28,563
Wow.

7572
03:23:35,570 --> 03:23:38,090
He was fucking making 3.5 million.

7573
03:23:38,980 --> 03:23:39,820
Holy Shit.

7574
03:23:44,950 --> 03:23:45,551
Hey Joey.

7575
03:23:45,551 --> 03:23:47,290
How about most of that defense team?

7576
03:23:47,380 --> 03:23:49,780
The how about most of
the defense team is dead.

7577
03:23:50,680 --> 03:23:51,970
Tara was a motherfucker.

7578
03:23:52,770 --> 03:23:53,060
Yeah,

7579
03:23:53,060 --> 03:23:53,893
but you know what

7580
03:23:55,440 --> 03:23:57,740
and that was the baddest
motherfucker have,

7581
03:23:57,741 --> 03:23:59,060
his name is Barry Scheck.

7582
03:23:59,480 --> 03:24:00,680
They got him on the show.

7583
03:24:02,210 --> 03:24:03,043
Joe Rogan.

7584
03:24:04,040 --> 03:24:06,100
I haven't seen puff par five brother.

7585
03:24:06,140 --> 03:24:06,610
I haven't seen.

7586
03:24:06,610 --> 03:24:07,391
I've only seen for,

7587
03:24:07,391 --> 03:24:07,531
hey,

7588
03:24:07,531 --> 03:24:08,291
is there a way to,

7589
03:24:08,291 --> 03:24:10,180
why I haven't seen any of these episodes?

7590
03:24:10,181 --> 03:24:11,014
Is there a way,

7591
03:24:11,350 --> 03:24:14,350
assuming I've lost my mind
and I want to be terrified.

7592
03:24:15,260 --> 03:24:15,411
No,

7593
03:24:15,411 --> 03:24:17,530
it's a brilliant song up on there.

7594
03:24:19,470 --> 03:24:20,630
That's the only guy.

7595
03:24:21,740 --> 03:24:22,350
That guy,

7596
03:24:22,350 --> 03:24:23,183
wow.

7597
03:24:26,120 --> 03:24:26,953
Come on.

7598
03:24:28,060 --> 03:24:29,640
It was a fucking sign.

7599
03:24:30,830 --> 03:24:31,431
Hey Joey.

7600
03:24:31,431 --> 03:24:32,970
Even to the way they dress,

7601
03:24:32,971 --> 03:24:34,000
they had a whole game plan.

7602
03:24:34,001 --> 03:24:35,000
I mean until their ties,

7603
03:24:35,001 --> 03:24:35,601
their suits.

7604
03:24:35,601 --> 03:24:36,650
They had a whole game plan.

7605
03:24:39,840 --> 03:24:40,350
Wow.

7606
03:24:40,350 --> 03:24:40,831
Fucking,

7607
03:24:40,831 --> 03:24:41,121
it's a,

7608
03:24:41,121 --> 03:24:41,930
it's brilliant.

7609
03:24:41,930 --> 03:24:44,100
This is the best documentary ever seen to

7610
03:24:44,100 --> 03:24:44,400
him.

7611
03:24:44,400 --> 03:24:45,121
It's amazing.

7612
03:24:45,121 --> 03:24:45,540
It did.

7613
03:24:45,540 --> 03:24:48,960
It paints a different story
on how how Oj Simpson,

7614
03:24:49,110 --> 03:24:51,210
he went associate himself as being black.

7615
03:24:51,211 --> 03:24:52,430
He didn't view himself as black.

7616
03:24:52,431 --> 03:24:53,670
He view himself as Oj.

7617
03:24:53,910 --> 03:24:56,430
So we always thought he
was bigger than the race.

7618
03:24:56,510 --> 03:24:59,090
It's so crazy the way they
painted the picture too.

7619
03:24:59,160 --> 03:25:04,160
But is that editorial choice or is
that based on his friends or family?

7620
03:25:04,980 --> 03:25:05,770
Mm,

7621
03:25:05,770 --> 03:25:06,311
but you know what,

7622
03:25:06,311 --> 03:25:07,000
they left out.

7623
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:08,520
They only mentioned it one time,

7624
03:25:08,560 --> 03:25:09,393
guys.

7625
03:25:10,330 --> 03:25:11,820
They left doctor cocaine.

7626
03:25:12,390 --> 03:25:12,830
Okay.

7627
03:25:12,830 --> 03:25:13,320
Oh No,

7628
03:25:13,320 --> 03:25:13,690
no,

7629
03:25:13,690 --> 03:25:14,400
no,

7630
03:25:14,400 --> 03:25:15,233
no.

7631
03:25:16,920 --> 03:25:17,330
Yeah.

7632
03:25:17,330 --> 03:25:18,610
That's a big red flag there.

7633
03:25:18,620 --> 03:25:18,771
Hey,

7634
03:25:18,771 --> 03:25:21,000
there's a documentary
you can watch on Youtube.

7635
03:25:21,800 --> 03:25:22,200
Oh,

7636
03:25:22,200 --> 03:25:22,490
Jay,

7637
03:25:22,490 --> 03:25:23,960
the untold story

7638
03:25:27,190 --> 03:25:29,540
on youtube or Netflix.

7639
03:25:29,720 --> 03:25:30,021
Oh No,

7640
03:25:30,021 --> 03:25:30,950
it's at the library,

7641
03:25:30,951 --> 03:25:31,340
Bro.

7642
03:25:31,340 --> 03:25:35,210
[inaudible] in America on the tomato.

7643
03:25:35,480 --> 03:25:35,950
Right.

7644
03:25:35,950 --> 03:25:36,800
100

7645
03:25:37,070 --> 03:25:38,240
he had CTE.

7646
03:25:38,300 --> 03:25:39,890
But then you sprinkle that cocaine.

7647
03:25:41,080 --> 03:25:42,670
Why didn't they talk about the cocaine?

7648
03:25:43,250 --> 03:25:43,750
Hmm.

7649
03:25:43,750 --> 03:25:44,583
That's interesting.

7650
03:25:44,740 --> 03:25:45,400
Bring it up.

7651
03:25:45,400 --> 03:25:46,480
And that's a suspect.

7652
03:25:47,710 --> 03:25:47,831
Well,

7653
03:25:47,831 --> 03:25:48,040
you know,

7654
03:25:48,040 --> 03:25:48,740
it's interesting,

7655
03:25:48,740 --> 03:25:49,573
Joe.

7656
03:25:50,480 --> 03:25:51,313
Hello?

7657
03:25:51,500 --> 03:25:52,760
I said what's interesting is,

7658
03:25:52,880 --> 03:25:53,180
uh,

7659
03:25:53,180 --> 03:25:57,890
one of the doctors that
was somehow involved in the
case back in the day was on

7660
03:25:57,891 --> 03:26:02,300
TV recently and he was talking
about the new discoveries about CTE.

7661
03:26:02,301 --> 03:26:04,070
What would the new
understanding about CTE.

7662
03:26:04,310 --> 03:26:08,060
And they said that it is very possible
that they might have actually introduced

7663
03:26:08,061 --> 03:26:11,750
that into the trial back then
if they knew what they knew now,

7664
03:26:11,780 --> 03:26:12,530
which is crazy.

7665
03:26:12,530 --> 03:26:13,270
Right?

7666
03:26:13,270 --> 03:26:14,080
Absolutely.

7667
03:26:14,080 --> 03:26:14,913
Absolutely.

7668
03:26:15,700 --> 03:26:16,391
Absolutely.

7669
03:26:16,391 --> 03:26:19,000
It's just makes sense because
John would mark me on that.

7670
03:26:19,690 --> 03:26:20,341
He goes back,

7671
03:26:20,341 --> 03:26:22,210
guy had the different CTE,

7672
03:26:22,810 --> 03:26:24,700
the shit that you know you don't fuck it.

7673
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:26,440
It just comes and goes,

7674
03:26:28,170 --> 03:26:28,961
comes and goes.

7675
03:26:28,961 --> 03:26:30,460
It is completely different dog.

7676
03:26:31,210 --> 03:26:33,890
He was an American hero
that kills a white woman.

7677
03:26:34,690 --> 03:26:36,100
You kind of see this Joe Rogan,

7678
03:26:36,101 --> 03:26:37,030
how they break it down.

7679
03:26:37,290 --> 03:26:39,040
It's just a long documentary.

7680
03:26:39,041 --> 03:26:40,450
It's 15 fucking hours.

7681
03:26:41,160 --> 03:26:41,641
Hey Joey,

7682
03:26:41,641 --> 03:26:42,750
let me ask you this man.

7683
03:26:42,810 --> 03:26:43,920
How much do you know about

7684
03:26:44,140 --> 03:26:44,370
t?

7685
03:26:44,370 --> 03:26:45,203
E

7686
03:26:45,770 --> 03:26:46,461
I don't know.

7687
03:26:46,461 --> 03:26:46,941
I all,

7688
03:26:46,941 --> 03:26:49,360
I feel I saw the movie and

7689
03:26:49,700 --> 03:26:50,211
he's talking.

7690
03:26:50,211 --> 03:26:51,044
Question.

7691
03:26:51,140 --> 03:26:52,010
You saw concussion?

7692
03:26:52,040 --> 03:26:52,710
No.

7693
03:26:52,710 --> 03:26:52,920
Yeah,

7694
03:26:52,920 --> 03:26:53,753
sure.

7695
03:26:53,880 --> 03:26:55,950
I showed the movie aren't you?

7696
03:26:55,951 --> 03:27:00,951
Started thinking about things and they
made a lot of sense to me now saying

7697
03:27:01,350 --> 03:27:01,531
this,

7698
03:27:01,531 --> 03:27:04,560
that happened over the years of
people I knew who plays football.

7699
03:27:05,490 --> 03:27:07,080
It just made sense to me.

7700
03:27:07,110 --> 03:27:10,470
Like I didn't even know about
the Pittsburgh Steelers,

7701
03:27:10,471 --> 03:27:14,670
all that stuff with the center
and the other guy had no idea.

7702
03:27:14,820 --> 03:27:15,710
But it makes sense.

7703
03:27:16,180 --> 03:27:17,390
That makes sense available.

7704
03:27:17,410 --> 03:27:19,440
It'll happen to one of my
friends when he was younger,

7705
03:27:19,740 --> 03:27:20,610
he was a senator

7706
03:27:22,520 --> 03:27:25,070
and he was also a note and he
was awesome when nose guard,

7707
03:27:25,350 --> 03:27:27,350
so they get hit in the head
of all the fucking time.

7708
03:27:29,720 --> 03:27:30,553
Wow.

7709
03:27:31,210 --> 03:27:34,030
So I'm looking at the kids and
how that played college ball,

7710
03:27:35,110 --> 03:27:37,010
they're not that solid light.

7711
03:27:37,011 --> 03:27:39,310
The kids I grew up with
that played college ball,

7712
03:27:39,670 --> 03:27:40,960
you can see that something's not,

7713
03:27:41,740 --> 03:27:46,090
I think the pro ball really puts it
all to you because it puts the stress

7714
03:27:46,091 --> 03:27:48,970
combined with the hitch and
now you're making money.

7715
03:27:49,270 --> 03:27:50,103
You know?

7716
03:27:50,770 --> 03:27:53,020
I think that really
pushes it over the end.

7717
03:27:53,590 --> 03:27:55,150
That's just too many years ago.

7718
03:27:55,180 --> 03:27:56,013
They hit in the head.

7719
03:27:56,150 --> 03:27:56,440
Right,

7720
03:27:56,440 --> 03:27:59,110
which should become a pro when
you add three or four years,

7721
03:27:59,111 --> 03:27:59,944
you know,

7722
03:28:01,270 --> 03:28:03,070
I don't know much about
it until Joe Rogan.

7723
03:28:03,460 --> 03:28:08,050
I know that right now I could see it
from the beginning is of it and some

7724
03:28:08,051 --> 03:28:08,884
fighters.

7725
03:28:10,420 --> 03:28:12,070
And if you don't see the beginning of it,

7726
03:28:12,190 --> 03:28:13,900
some fighters that you're not looking,

7727
03:28:14,710 --> 03:28:16,660
you could tell that they're a little box,

7728
03:28:16,661 --> 03:28:17,494
you know?

7729
03:28:18,280 --> 03:28:18,431
Well,

7730
03:28:18,431 --> 03:28:20,020
it's interesting because it's like when,

7731
03:28:20,021 --> 03:28:23,110
when do you make a decision when
you're a fighter and Brendan,

7732
03:28:23,111 --> 03:28:24,610
you're the only one that
could talk about this.

7733
03:28:25,060 --> 03:28:27,220
What do you make a decision like Gwen,

7734
03:28:27,720 --> 03:28:31,380
when your good friend
Joe Rogan fucking suck.

7735
03:28:33,420 --> 03:28:34,890
I never said you suck,

7736
03:28:39,550 --> 03:28:41,590
except that once you tap that button,

7737
03:28:42,100 --> 03:28:43,310
you keep getting knocked out.

7738
03:28:44,170 --> 03:28:47,740
And I can guarantee you that those people
that had more than 400 accounts over

7739
03:28:47,741 --> 03:28:48,574
the years,

7740
03:28:48,730 --> 03:28:51,610
they'll start to experience headaches
or something with that vision.

7741
03:28:51,760 --> 03:28:53,840
That needs to be a way with that memory.

7742
03:28:55,710 --> 03:28:56,860
If people listening to this,

7743
03:28:56,861 --> 03:28:59,190
Joey Diaz is on
speakerphone on Eddie Bravo,

7744
03:28:59,191 --> 03:29:00,024
his phone,

7745
03:29:00,070 --> 03:29:01,660
and he can't hear Brendan,

7746
03:29:01,661 --> 03:29:02,890
who's on the other side of the table,

7747
03:29:02,891 --> 03:29:03,180
cause ed,

7748
03:29:03,180 --> 03:29:04,011
he's got the speaker phone.

7749
03:29:04,011 --> 03:29:04,510
I'm just like,

7750
03:29:04,510 --> 03:29:05,530
it's real hard to hear.

7751
03:29:06,040 --> 03:29:07,720
So you've gone judge?

7752
03:29:07,960 --> 03:29:08,160
Yeah,

7753
03:29:08,160 --> 03:29:08,310
no,

7754
03:29:08,310 --> 03:29:08,421
no,

7755
03:29:08,421 --> 03:29:08,591
no.

7756
03:29:08,591 --> 03:29:09,000
Joey,

7757
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:09,220
no.

7758
03:29:09,220 --> 03:29:09,521
Joey,

7759
03:29:09,521 --> 03:29:10,181
I think you're dead,

7760
03:29:10,181 --> 03:29:10,481
right?

7761
03:29:10,481 --> 03:29:10,661
Yeah,

7762
03:29:10,661 --> 03:29:11,110
he's right.

7763
03:29:11,110 --> 03:29:11,411
Joey.

7764
03:29:11,411 --> 03:29:12,370
I think you'd dead right.

7765
03:29:12,460 --> 03:29:13,330
I think you're dead right?

7766
03:29:13,331 --> 03:29:14,050
We all do.

7767
03:29:14,050 --> 03:29:14,890
We all agree with you.

7768
03:29:15,130 --> 03:29:17,740
I was just telling people that
you couldn't hear Brendan.

7769
03:29:18,050 --> 03:29:18,550
Um,

7770
03:29:18,550 --> 03:29:18,700
I,

7771
03:29:18,700 --> 03:29:18,901
yeah,

7772
03:29:18,901 --> 03:29:19,120
it's,

7773
03:29:19,120 --> 03:29:19,391
it's,

7774
03:29:19,391 --> 03:29:19,660
um,

7775
03:29:19,660 --> 03:29:21,820
it's one of those things where
you've got a wonder as a fighter.

7776
03:29:21,821 --> 03:29:23,110
Like where do you draw the line?

7777
03:29:23,111 --> 03:29:24,850
Because you'll get a guy
like Alistair Overeem.

7778
03:29:25,000 --> 03:29:26,740
He's been stopped a bunch of times,

7779
03:29:27,010 --> 03:29:29,260
but Alice is about the
fight for the title,

7780
03:29:29,310 --> 03:29:29,830
you know,

7781
03:29:29,830 --> 03:29:31,030
so when do you make that call?

7782
03:29:31,030 --> 03:29:33,790
Because Alistair's as good as
he's ever been knocked out.

7783
03:29:34,330 --> 03:29:34,811
You know,

7784
03:29:34,811 --> 03:29:38,260
he knocked out a junior dos Santos
and a spectacular Spec type note.

7785
03:29:38,261 --> 03:29:39,280
Rothwell knocked him out.

7786
03:29:39,730 --> 03:29:40,151
Correct.

7787
03:29:40,151 --> 03:29:41,830
Take Ben knocked him
out in the first round.

7788
03:29:41,930 --> 03:29:42,230
He,

7789
03:29:42,230 --> 03:29:43,090
here's the question,

7790
03:29:43,091 --> 03:29:43,271
Joe.

7791
03:29:43,271 --> 03:29:44,680
What other options do they have?

7792
03:29:45,220 --> 03:29:46,340
That's why I stopped that.

7793
03:29:46,370 --> 03:29:47,050
Other options.

7794
03:29:47,050 --> 03:29:47,920
Most guys don't,

7795
03:29:48,130 --> 03:29:48,910
but he's,

7796
03:29:48,910 --> 03:29:49,380
yeah,

7797
03:29:49,380 --> 03:29:49,550
I,

7798
03:29:49,550 --> 03:29:51,520
that's a good point
because people can say,

7799
03:29:51,521 --> 03:29:52,150
well,

7800
03:29:52,150 --> 03:29:53,440
you've taken too many fights.

7801
03:29:53,560 --> 03:29:56,860
You need to stop and
do what the workforce,

7802
03:29:56,861 --> 03:29:57,550
fuck you.

7803
03:29:57,550 --> 03:29:57,761
Right.

7804
03:29:57,761 --> 03:29:59,020
I make six figures fighting.

7805
03:29:59,021 --> 03:30:02,200
I'm get punched on shitting
my pants in front of my kids.

7806
03:30:02,380 --> 03:30:05,380
But that's also don't you think that
there's an important point where you have

7807
03:30:05,381 --> 03:30:06,880
to decide like whether or not it's,

7808
03:30:06,881 --> 03:30:11,881
it's what you actually want to do and you
had the option to do other shit and it

7809
03:30:11,951 --> 03:30:16,030
was a perfect time for you to
just step back and do other shit.

7810
03:30:16,031 --> 03:30:16,870
But some people,

7811
03:30:17,020 --> 03:30:18,280
I also have Joe Rogan,

7812
03:30:18,281 --> 03:30:21,190
Brian Cowen who helped me
out and gave me a platform.

7813
03:30:21,910 --> 03:30:22,990
You're also an entertaining,

7814
03:30:23,050 --> 03:30:24,080
there's a lot of dudes with the,

7815
03:30:24,090 --> 03:30:25,090
they would do podcasts.

7816
03:30:25,091 --> 03:30:25,421
You'd be like,

7817
03:30:25,421 --> 03:30:27,160
shut that shit fucking suck.

7818
03:30:27,161 --> 03:30:28,400
I'm just saying the jelly.

7819
03:30:28,920 --> 03:30:29,800
I had other options.

7820
03:30:29,810 --> 03:30:30,520
Joey's snores.

7821
03:30:30,520 --> 03:30:32,130
Guys have to fight you still there,

7822
03:30:32,250 --> 03:30:33,083
Joey.

7823
03:30:33,210 --> 03:30:34,043
Joey.

7824
03:30:35,210 --> 03:30:35,350
Hey,

7825
03:30:35,350 --> 03:30:35,770
we're gonna.

7826
03:30:35,770 --> 03:30:37,420
We're gonna wrap this podcast up.

7827
03:30:37,421 --> 03:30:37,691
Joey,

7828
03:30:37,691 --> 03:30:38,524
we love you man.

7829
03:30:38,850 --> 03:30:39,683
I you brother.

7830
03:30:40,150 --> 03:30:40,983
I love you.

7831
03:30:42,930 --> 03:30:43,763
I love you guys.

7832
03:30:44,660 --> 03:30:45,890
That's always the best.

7833
03:30:46,280 --> 03:30:47,300
He's a national treasure.

7834
03:30:47,301 --> 03:30:48,110
A world treasure.

7835
03:30:48,110 --> 03:30:51,520
He won't drive and do fine in the kit
cause it's too far to broad dark company.

7836
03:30:52,110 --> 03:30:52,943
Me,

7837
03:30:53,690 --> 03:30:54,740
I'm 51 years old.

7838
03:30:54,741 --> 03:30:55,311
Let me tell you something,

7839
03:30:55,311 --> 03:30:55,461
mother.

7840
03:30:55,461 --> 03:30:55,741
The fuck,

7841
03:30:55,741 --> 03:30:56,780
I'm 49 years old.

7842
03:30:56,781 --> 03:30:57,411
Let me tell you something,

7843
03:30:57,411 --> 03:30:57,980
bitch.

7844
03:30:57,980 --> 03:30:58,390
He goes,

7845
03:30:58,390 --> 03:31:02,600
[inaudible] 11 fuck you cock sucker.

7846
03:31:03,620 --> 03:31:04,460
Fuck man.

7847
03:31:04,700 --> 03:31:05,533
He's so fun.

7848
03:31:05,940 --> 03:31:08,420
He looked as the right
shit to say about it.

7849
03:31:09,250 --> 03:31:12,260
We're not going to get them over there
on the west side like Marina del Rey or

7850
03:31:12,270 --> 03:31:13,103
listen dog.

7851
03:31:15,020 --> 03:31:16,160
He knows and you know what?

7852
03:31:16,420 --> 03:31:17,330
He doesn't text.

7853
03:31:17,390 --> 03:31:17,961
I'll text him.

7854
03:31:17,961 --> 03:31:18,500
Hey Man,

7855
03:31:18,500 --> 03:31:19,820
can you do 11 or call me?

7856
03:31:20,170 --> 03:31:20,480
He'll,

7857
03:31:20,480 --> 03:31:21,201
he only calls.

7858
03:31:21,201 --> 03:31:21,970
I never text.

7859
03:31:21,970 --> 03:31:22,310
You run.

7860
03:31:22,310 --> 03:31:27,310
No danger of me and driving down to
fucking Laguna Niguel here with no danger.

7861
03:31:29,070 --> 03:31:29,903
Want eat?

7862
03:31:30,090 --> 03:31:30,923
What?

7863
03:31:31,160 --> 03:31:32,450
Four o'clock on a Tuesday.

7864
03:31:32,451 --> 03:31:33,530
How about you suck my Dick.

7865
03:31:35,000 --> 03:31:35,833
All right man.

7866
03:31:35,870 --> 03:31:39,830
You asked me to do the show
and he's in the had a mass.

7867
03:31:39,890 --> 03:31:40,230
Listen,

7868
03:31:40,230 --> 03:31:41,810
dog would make it nice and simple.

7869
03:31:42,080 --> 03:31:42,980
Come to my house,

7870
03:31:44,350 --> 03:31:44,840
Bro.

7871
03:31:44,840 --> 03:31:46,030
He's got his own studio now.

7872
03:31:46,031 --> 03:31:46,340
I know.

7873
03:31:46,340 --> 03:31:47,410
I went to the studio,

7874
03:31:47,430 --> 03:31:51,380
need to set up a student to
a studio and he was so high.

7875
03:31:51,680 --> 03:31:52,850
We got nothing done.

7876
03:31:53,120 --> 03:31:53,953
That's perfect.

7877
03:31:54,980 --> 03:31:55,191
Hey,

7878
03:31:55,191 --> 03:31:56,024
talk to me about,

7879
03:31:56,180 --> 03:31:56,421
hey,

7880
03:31:56,421 --> 03:31:57,620
you know I go on there and he goes,

7881
03:31:57,980 --> 03:31:59,450
talk to me about boulder.

7882
03:32:00,020 --> 03:32:01,720
What you weren't going to say.

7883
03:32:02,510 --> 03:32:05,390
Let me tell you about my story
about boulder and he's so hot,

7884
03:32:05,910 --> 03:32:06,940
so y'all nothing done.

7885
03:32:06,950 --> 03:32:07,850
I'm going to take a nap.

7886
03:32:07,851 --> 03:32:10,950
I want you to talk to
me about mountains and

7887
03:32:12,850 --> 03:32:15,770
he does he goals and ferrets.

7888
03:32:16,190 --> 03:32:16,700
Exactly.

7889
03:32:16,700 --> 03:32:17,533
Come on dog.

7890
03:32:19,120 --> 03:32:19,520
Dog.

7891
03:32:19,520 --> 03:32:20,353
Come back.

7892
03:32:20,990 --> 03:32:21,823
Better than ever.

7893
03:32:23,030 --> 03:32:24,200
Spark up the bong.

7894
03:32:24,290 --> 03:32:26,660
Tell me about your time in Mexico.

7895
03:32:27,100 --> 03:32:29,060
What do you mean you got
nothing done where you guys,

7896
03:32:29,320 --> 03:32:30,710
didn't you do a podcast or something?

7897
03:32:30,980 --> 03:32:31,910
We did a podcast.

7898
03:32:31,911 --> 03:32:34,940
He was just so high and we're talking
about cu boulder for two hours.

7899
03:32:34,950 --> 03:32:36,240
Six perfect.

7900
03:32:36,560 --> 03:32:38,630
Let it roll the back and he is what he is,

7901
03:32:38,631 --> 03:32:38,811
man.

7902
03:32:38,811 --> 03:32:39,410
He's perfect.

7903
03:32:39,410 --> 03:32:40,243
He's the best.

7904
03:32:40,400 --> 03:32:42,350
It's fucking hilarious.

7905
03:32:42,380 --> 03:32:43,280
Talk to you about some places.

7906
03:32:43,281 --> 03:32:44,180
He's never even been.

7907
03:32:44,660 --> 03:32:45,800
Those North Dakota people.

7908
03:32:47,130 --> 03:32:48,490
Dirty white

7909
03:32:51,310 --> 03:32:52,131
fucking shoes.

7910
03:32:52,131 --> 03:32:55,400
They want these Chinese women at sucked
at Dicks and they'd come over and

7911
03:32:55,401 --> 03:32:58,220
fucking old World War
Two snoopy airplanes.

7912
03:32:58,620 --> 03:32:59,830
They dropped them out of the sky.

7913
03:32:59,860 --> 03:33:02,840
They just suck your Dick and they just
fucking shoot right back off in a space.

7914
03:33:04,040 --> 03:33:05,360
He'll make some shit up.

7915
03:33:05,920 --> 03:33:07,490
He's fucking crying.

7916
03:33:08,650 --> 03:33:10,370
It's a total unique individual.

7917
03:33:10,760 --> 03:33:12,620
When are you gonna meet
another Joey d as in your life?

7918
03:33:13,370 --> 03:33:14,203
Never.

7919
03:33:14,210 --> 03:33:15,470
He calls and checks on me.

7920
03:33:16,130 --> 03:33:16,521
I know.

7921
03:33:16,521 --> 03:33:17,031
It's beautiful,

7922
03:33:17,031 --> 03:33:17,360
right?

7923
03:33:17,360 --> 03:33:19,850
It's great wonder boy nasty in this fight,

7924
03:33:19,851 --> 03:33:20,180
man.

7925
03:33:20,180 --> 03:33:21,500
These highlights were watching

7926
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:25,810
wonder boys loss was
to Matt fucking bound.

7927
03:33:26,720 --> 03:33:28,520
Other than that needs starched everybody.

7928
03:33:28,820 --> 03:33:29,001
Well,

7929
03:33:29,001 --> 03:33:30,200
he just fought real smart.

7930
03:33:30,500 --> 03:33:31,860
I wish were shot with stop.

7931
03:33:32,960 --> 03:33:35,960
I think he probably will
eventually for sure,

7932
03:33:35,961 --> 03:33:38,140
but one of my favorite people
on the planet and stuff.

7933
03:33:38,430 --> 03:33:42,840
Well that Glover fight is going to be
hard for a proud former champion like him

7934
03:33:42,841 --> 03:33:46,800
to go out on if he decides to
end it on the groper fight.

7935
03:33:46,801 --> 03:33:47,634
Fight for him.

7936
03:33:47,700 --> 03:33:49,020
Who's Glover fight now?

7937
03:33:49,430 --> 03:33:50,250
It's a good question.

7938
03:33:50,250 --> 03:33:52,950
When you said Gustin in the
beginning I liked Gustafson.

7939
03:33:53,040 --> 03:33:54,240
I think that's a great fight,

7940
03:33:54,270 --> 03:33:57,930
but Gustafson already has
a fight scheduled and it
might be a reason why they

7941
03:33:57,931 --> 03:33:59,400
scheduled the guy against him.

7942
03:33:59,401 --> 03:34:00,234
Do you know who it is?

7943
03:34:00,270 --> 03:34:01,110
Who is a gun?

7944
03:34:01,170 --> 03:34:03,000
They just announced it like yesterday.

7945
03:34:03,001 --> 03:34:03,720
Right?

7946
03:34:03,720 --> 03:34:05,970
It's like I'm not ranked
in the top 10 I know that.

7947
03:34:06,510 --> 03:34:07,920
That's a weird fight to make,

7948
03:34:07,921 --> 03:34:08,550
right?

7949
03:34:08,550 --> 03:34:09,031
What's the name?

7950
03:34:09,031 --> 03:34:11,520
Starts with a B block coach.

7951
03:34:11,590 --> 03:34:12,231
Yon Blocker,

7952
03:34:12,231 --> 03:34:13,200
which is a good fighter.

7953
03:34:13,290 --> 03:34:14,310
He's a very good fighter,

7954
03:34:14,370 --> 03:34:15,990
but good enough to fight gusts when right.

7955
03:34:15,991 --> 03:34:20,991
Number three or 400 you can find a
highlight reel for young yon blocks of it

7956
03:34:22,410 --> 03:34:22,830
honestly.

7957
03:34:22,830 --> 03:34:24,660
But the only thing is
it's gusting is gone.

7958
03:34:24,690 --> 03:34:24,931
You know,

7959
03:34:24,931 --> 03:34:27,810
he almost beat John Jones a decision.

7960
03:34:27,811 --> 03:34:29,080
He'll SPDC and decision.

7961
03:34:29,081 --> 03:34:30,000
Then you're fighting this guy.

7962
03:34:30,060 --> 03:34:30,920
Well I think he,

7963
03:34:30,921 --> 03:34:32,070
cause he said time off.

7964
03:34:32,100 --> 03:34:33,810
It's almost a welcome back.

7965
03:34:33,870 --> 03:34:35,520
I don't like [inaudible]
had mental problems.

7966
03:34:35,521 --> 03:34:36,090
Welcome back.

7967
03:34:36,090 --> 03:34:38,580
I don't like to say almost beat.

7968
03:34:39,420 --> 03:34:41,400
I like to say lost a close fight too.

7969
03:34:41,580 --> 03:34:42,413
That's fair.

7970
03:34:42,480 --> 03:34:42,781
Yeah.

7971
03:34:42,781 --> 03:34:43,760
Can't say almost covered.

7972
03:34:43,761 --> 03:34:44,280
Did it really well,

7973
03:34:44,280 --> 03:34:45,300
he was beating John.

7974
03:34:45,360 --> 03:34:46,740
Who's going to beat John Jones?

7975
03:34:46,770 --> 03:34:48,060
Fuck had some moments.

7976
03:34:48,190 --> 03:34:49,230
Some good moments.

7977
03:34:49,260 --> 03:34:50,730
But you never had John Johnson trouble.

7978
03:34:50,731 --> 03:34:52,290
Jon Jones always came back.

7979
03:34:52,710 --> 03:34:54,330
John John's gritty as fuck.

7980
03:34:54,330 --> 03:34:54,571
Right.

7981
03:34:54,571 --> 03:34:55,390
But he came back.

7982
03:34:55,390 --> 03:34:56,223
You know what I'm saying?

7983
03:34:56,260 --> 03:34:57,240
I just won that fight.

7984
03:34:57,390 --> 03:34:58,280
Jon Jones won that fight,

7985
03:34:58,860 --> 03:35:00,390
but it was good fight.

7986
03:35:00,480 --> 03:35:00,961
It was a very,

7987
03:35:00,961 --> 03:35:01,640
very good fighter.

7988
03:35:01,640 --> 03:35:02,290
Close fight.

7989
03:35:02,290 --> 03:35:02,970
Yeah.

7990
03:35:02,970 --> 03:35:05,910
See like the fight where
he was in like trouble.

7991
03:35:06,120 --> 03:35:09,480
That's like the rumble Johnson
fight when he fought rumble.

7992
03:35:09,780 --> 03:35:11,880
When customers that's in trouble,

7993
03:35:11,940 --> 03:35:13,570
that's in trouble losing right.

7994
03:35:13,600 --> 03:35:14,760
That's losing the fight.

7995
03:35:14,840 --> 03:35:15,600
Right.

7996
03:35:15,600 --> 03:35:17,070
Jon Jones has never been in trouble.

7997
03:35:17,071 --> 03:35:17,820
Never been in trouble.

7998
03:35:17,820 --> 03:35:19,290
Gus Fring gave him his toughest test.

7999
03:35:19,320 --> 03:35:19,831
It's interesting.

8000
03:35:19,831 --> 03:35:20,250
Right.

8001
03:35:20,250 --> 03:35:24,450
You know and that's how John
or had him in an arm bar.

8002
03:35:24,690 --> 03:35:25,320
It's true.

8003
03:35:25,320 --> 03:35:27,810
That's what I'm up and slammed
him and then submitted them.

8004
03:35:27,870 --> 03:35:28,410
Yup.

8005
03:35:28,410 --> 03:35:31,920
That might be one of the most dangerous
times in his career because his arm was

8006
03:35:31,921 --> 03:35:33,110
completely hyper extended.

8007
03:35:33,120 --> 03:35:33,740
Snap does.

8008
03:35:33,740 --> 03:35:35,670
He showed what a bad mother fucker he is.

8009
03:35:35,680 --> 03:35:36,513
He did not.

8010
03:35:36,750 --> 03:35:37,583
He snapped his arm.

8011
03:35:37,590 --> 03:35:37,861
Yes.

8012
03:35:37,861 --> 03:35:39,420
He said he hyperextended his elbow.

8013
03:35:39,780 --> 03:35:44,280
It's one of the reasons why he took that
job on the ultimate fighter with Chael

8014
03:35:44,280 --> 03:35:46,740
Sonnen because he wasn't going
to fight for quite a long time.

8015
03:35:47,250 --> 03:35:48,780
So they knew that.

8016
03:35:48,781 --> 03:35:52,020
So they scheduled that fight next
and then if you remember correctly,

8017
03:35:52,170 --> 03:35:53,070
he has that fight.

8018
03:35:53,071 --> 03:35:54,300
He beats the shit out of jail son.

8019
03:35:54,301 --> 03:35:56,310
And he breaks his toe in the process.

8020
03:35:56,640 --> 03:36:00,900
He was pushing off the mat so fucking
hard trying to kill [inaudible] son and

8021
03:36:01,110 --> 03:36:03,810
then he broke his own
toe and spun it around.

8022
03:36:03,811 --> 03:36:04,621
You remember that Shit.

8023
03:36:04,621 --> 03:36:06,180
He's a fucking monster.

8024
03:36:06,330 --> 03:36:09,660
Even realize it until he looked
down on for pound number.

8025
03:36:09,661 --> 03:36:11,490
He was standing there
after the fight was over.

8026
03:36:11,491 --> 03:36:15,240
I was talking to him and then he looked
down and realized that he had twisted

8027
03:36:15,241 --> 03:36:16,470
his toe upside down.

8028
03:36:16,590 --> 03:36:18,390
Fucking nightmare.

8029
03:36:18,550 --> 03:36:21,780
Good luck had motherfucker
and if DC done beat them,

8030
03:36:21,781 --> 03:36:25,020
it's all where everyone's motherfucker.

8031
03:36:25,320 --> 03:36:26,153
But here's the thing,

8032
03:36:26,600 --> 03:36:27,960
and I don't know if he's right,

8033
03:36:28,080 --> 03:36:32,370
but Greg Jackson was saying that he
thought that one of the things about John

8034
03:36:32,371 --> 03:36:33,030
being,

8035
03:36:33,030 --> 03:36:34,200
I didn't think you was sluggish.

8036
03:36:34,260 --> 03:36:35,900
I thought he took a lot of time off any,

8037
03:36:35,960 --> 03:36:36,611
a lot of pressure.

8038
03:36:36,611 --> 03:36:38,680
I thought he fought very creatively
and I thought he thought,

8039
03:36:38,681 --> 03:36:39,514
well us,

8040
03:36:39,770 --> 03:36:40,570
yes,

8041
03:36:40,570 --> 03:36:41,170
bad chick.

8042
03:36:41,170 --> 03:36:41,650
No,

8043
03:36:41,650 --> 03:36:42,483
I didn't.

8044
03:36:43,780 --> 03:36:44,250
I did.

8045
03:36:44,250 --> 03:36:45,760
I definitely don't
think he fired his best.

8046
03:36:46,150 --> 03:36:49,910
But I think considering the fact that
he was off for a long time and all that

8047
03:36:49,920 --> 03:36:53,590
personal problems that he went through
and he fought a real tough guy and OSP

8048
03:36:53,591 --> 03:36:56,500
that was in a fairly defensive
position and a lot of the fight,

8049
03:36:56,560 --> 03:36:57,820
he didn't risk anything.

8050
03:36:57,821 --> 03:36:58,481
It's more else.

8051
03:36:58,481 --> 03:36:59,260
Very John.

8052
03:36:59,260 --> 03:36:59,471
Well,

8053
03:36:59,471 --> 03:37:00,740
Osp photo smart fight.

8054
03:37:00,760 --> 03:37:01,720
You're far a smart fight.

8055
03:37:01,721 --> 03:37:05,260
Camp tested the water he did the
best is Billy took some chances,

8056
03:37:05,380 --> 03:37:08,290
but he got out of the fight
ultimately in pretty good shape.

8057
03:37:08,320 --> 03:37:09,530
We set bruise on his arm,

8058
03:37:09,531 --> 03:37:09,930
got broke,

8059
03:37:09,930 --> 03:37:10,500
come to win.

8060
03:37:10,500 --> 03:37:10,670
Really?

8061
03:37:10,670 --> 03:37:12,210
Another guy who his arm got broke by kick.

8062
03:37:12,230 --> 03:37:12,940
Yeah,

8063
03:37:12,940 --> 03:37:14,020
John broke his arm.

8064
03:37:14,050 --> 03:37:15,880
Probably significantly slowed him down.

8065
03:37:15,910 --> 03:37:16,743
Yeah,

8066
03:37:16,960 --> 03:37:19,120
so I didn't think it was
a bad performance at all.

8067
03:37:19,150 --> 03:37:24,070
I think osps fucking good man and getting
better and a dangerous eats a tricky

8068
03:37:24,071 --> 03:37:24,841
fight for anybody.

8069
03:37:24,841 --> 03:37:26,090
He's a super powerful guy.

8070
03:37:26,100 --> 03:37:27,040
So South Paul,

8071
03:37:27,041 --> 03:37:27,260
I thought,

8072
03:37:27,260 --> 03:37:29,410
I just thought John Look
kind of lackadaisical.

8073
03:37:29,440 --> 03:37:30,370
He didn't risk anything,

8074
03:37:30,371 --> 03:37:31,420
get too much to lose.

8075
03:37:31,450 --> 03:37:32,320
Just a lot of factors,

8076
03:37:32,410 --> 03:37:36,310
a lot of factors and also getting that
off of his chest and then getting back in

8077
03:37:36,311 --> 03:37:37,150
there and fighting.

8078
03:37:37,151 --> 03:37:41,560
Daniel is going to be like a
warmup fight against a top six guy.

8079
03:37:41,710 --> 03:37:44,050
Cause that's the OSP was I'm pretty
sure it was ranked number six.

8080
03:37:44,070 --> 03:37:44,240
Yeah,

8081
03:37:44,240 --> 03:37:44,830
that's a,

8082
03:37:44,830 --> 03:37:46,180
that's a great thing for John.

8083
03:37:46,210 --> 03:37:47,470
He also didn't show anything.

8084
03:37:47,500 --> 03:37:47,830
He didn't,

8085
03:37:47,830 --> 03:37:48,011
he,

8086
03:37:48,011 --> 03:37:49,960
he really didn't show DC anything.

8087
03:37:50,740 --> 03:37:54,760
But what I was gonna say is it Greg
Jackson seem to think allegedly after that

8088
03:37:54,761 --> 03:37:58,720
fight that the weightlifting might've
played a part in him look tight.

8089
03:37:59,350 --> 03:38:00,130
That's fair.

8090
03:38:00,130 --> 03:38:00,963
You think so?

8091
03:38:00,970 --> 03:38:01,600
That's fair.

8092
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:02,770
Because when you're in the weight room,

8093
03:38:02,771 --> 03:38:04,150
you put on more muscle,

8094
03:38:04,360 --> 03:38:04,631
you know,

8095
03:38:04,631 --> 03:38:05,441
you're slower,

8096
03:38:05,441 --> 03:38:06,130
you're a little more,

8097
03:38:06,130 --> 03:38:08,020
the more you know you're not as fluid.

8098
03:38:08,260 --> 03:38:08,491
You know.

8099
03:38:08,491 --> 03:38:10,590
It's interesting cause he didn't fight
for a while and you went through the

8100
03:38:10,591 --> 03:38:11,020
shit.

8101
03:38:11,020 --> 03:38:11,890
He was in jail.

8102
03:38:12,780 --> 03:38:13,601
Hey Greg Jackson.

8103
03:38:13,601 --> 03:38:14,434
I think it's more,

8104
03:38:14,560 --> 03:38:15,490
Hey Greg Jackson.

8105
03:38:15,670 --> 03:38:19,510
I think it's more that he t boned
a pregnant lady ran from the scene.

8106
03:38:19,540 --> 03:38:20,860
He had some time in jail.

8107
03:38:20,900 --> 03:38:21,461
You didn't find,

8108
03:38:21,461 --> 03:38:22,181
not gone forever.

8109
03:38:22,181 --> 03:38:25,390
It's called doc gun rusk and they thought
it very talented south Paul who is

8110
03:38:25,391 --> 03:38:26,350
tricky to deal with.

8111
03:38:26,710 --> 03:38:27,760
That's more what it is.

8112
03:38:27,910 --> 03:38:28,450
It's not,

8113
03:38:28,450 --> 03:38:30,430
it ain't the weight lifting well,

8114
03:38:30,580 --> 03:38:31,031
yeah.

8115
03:38:31,031 --> 03:38:33,430
It's interesting that you
would like it immediately,

8116
03:38:33,740 --> 03:38:38,410
like blame one aspect because one of the
things it was after I talked to John or

8117
03:38:38,411 --> 03:38:39,910
while I was talking to
John after the fight,

8118
03:38:40,330 --> 03:38:44,050
one of the things that he said was
that he felt physically felt great.

8119
03:38:44,260 --> 03:38:45,100
He just wasn't,

8120
03:38:45,550 --> 03:38:48,400
he wasn't engaging enough or it wasn't
pulling the trigger and you wanted to,

8121
03:38:48,580 --> 03:38:51,520
this was probably like
just a comfort thing.

8122
03:38:51,521 --> 03:38:51,761
You know?

8123
03:38:51,761 --> 03:38:53,380
He hadn't been fighting in a long time.

8124
03:38:53,381 --> 03:38:54,101
All the pressure,

8125
03:38:54,101 --> 03:38:54,680
all,

8126
03:38:54,680 --> 03:38:58,360
he's like probably quite a few factors
and maybe even it's not either or.

8127
03:38:58,630 --> 03:39:01,720
Maybe even the weightlifting might
have slowed him down a little bit.

8128
03:39:02,680 --> 03:39:03,221
Like you said,

8129
03:39:03,221 --> 03:39:04,180
I think it's the number of things,

8130
03:39:04,181 --> 03:39:05,860
but look at Gusto when
he's been out for a while.

8131
03:39:05,890 --> 03:39:07,090
They gave him a pretty,

8132
03:39:07,350 --> 03:39:08,530
I'm not saying it's a warm up fight,

8133
03:39:08,531 --> 03:39:09,790
but he's not finding a top 10 guy.

8134
03:39:10,060 --> 03:39:13,990
John's warmup fight was against the number
six guy in the world where the South

8135
03:39:13,990 --> 03:39:13,991
Paul,

8136
03:39:13,991 --> 03:39:15,700
who's explosives as fuck,

8137
03:39:15,940 --> 03:39:17,650
he's supposed to fight
for the world title.

8138
03:39:17,800 --> 03:39:19,270
So John was being a little hesitant,

8139
03:39:19,271 --> 03:39:19,870
safe.

8140
03:39:19,870 --> 03:39:20,920
He knows what's on the line.

8141
03:39:21,190 --> 03:39:23,380
Is there some sort of
history between Gustafson,

8142
03:39:23,381 --> 03:39:24,214
the guys fighting?

8143
03:39:24,490 --> 03:39:26,170
Is there a reason why
they're going to file things?

8144
03:39:26,171 --> 03:39:27,550
I think remember Gastrin was like,

8145
03:39:27,551 --> 03:39:28,990
I don't know if I want to do this anymore.

8146
03:39:29,150 --> 03:39:30,550
So I think it's more of like,

8147
03:39:30,890 --> 03:39:31,860
text me water against,

8148
03:39:31,990 --> 03:39:33,230
let's see if this is for you.

8149
03:39:33,231 --> 03:39:34,490
Go through a 12 week training camp.

8150
03:39:34,491 --> 03:39:35,301
Let's see what happens.

8151
03:39:35,301 --> 03:39:37,010
Cause you're phenomenal fighter.

8152
03:39:37,100 --> 03:39:37,660
Really?

8153
03:39:37,660 --> 03:39:38,360
Yeah.

8154
03:39:38,360 --> 03:39:39,410
That's interesting man.

8155
03:39:39,620 --> 03:39:42,110
Because I'm like you as a fighter,

8156
03:39:42,140 --> 03:39:45,020
when a fighter starts entertaining
those thoughts of stopping,

8157
03:39:45,140 --> 03:39:45,973
it's game over.

8158
03:39:46,880 --> 03:39:47,713
It's game over.

8159
03:39:48,380 --> 03:39:49,970
It's game over you and it,

8160
03:39:50,240 --> 03:39:51,073
it's game over.

8161
03:39:51,540 --> 03:39:52,560
It really is B.

8162
03:39:52,910 --> 03:39:55,400
And this has come from a guy who
didn't think that way for a long time.

8163
03:39:55,400 --> 03:39:56,041
Even when he told them,

8164
03:39:56,041 --> 03:39:56,301
I'm like,

8165
03:39:56,301 --> 03:39:56,901
what's he talking about?

8166
03:39:56,901 --> 03:39:57,770
One flooded in one for that.

8167
03:39:58,010 --> 03:39:59,420
And then when it finally the dust cell,

8168
03:39:59,421 --> 03:40:00,080
I'm like,

8169
03:40:00,080 --> 03:40:01,180
it's kind of fucking right.

8170
03:40:01,181 --> 03:40:04,430
Cause then when you're fighting guys
who it's all they have good life being a

8171
03:40:04,431 --> 03:40:08,780
glow overtake share who's
in fucking Connecticut in
the snow running sprints and

8172
03:40:08,781 --> 03:40:11,210
all he gives a fuck about
is knocking you out.

8173
03:40:11,360 --> 03:40:12,320
Or Anthony Johnson,

8174
03:40:12,321 --> 03:40:13,580
who all he cares about his knock,

8175
03:40:13,581 --> 03:40:13,940
you know,

8176
03:40:13,940 --> 03:40:15,770
he doesn't care about anything else.

8177
03:40:16,010 --> 03:40:17,000
And when you're one foot in,

8178
03:40:17,001 --> 03:40:17,540
one foot out,

8179
03:40:17,540 --> 03:40:18,950
you just can't compete at that level.

8180
03:40:19,040 --> 03:40:19,940
You just can't.

8181
03:40:20,090 --> 03:40:22,010
You can be a guy and still fight,

8182
03:40:22,130 --> 03:40:22,821
win some,

8183
03:40:22,821 --> 03:40:23,361
lose some.

8184
03:40:23,361 --> 03:40:24,710
But you should.

8185
03:40:24,740 --> 03:40:25,573
You should leave.

8186
03:40:25,820 --> 03:40:26,570
I think you're right.

8187
03:40:26,570 --> 03:40:30,740
And I'm glad you said that you should
leave 100% because I'm telling you,

8188
03:40:30,890 --> 03:40:34,520
there's guys out there who they
live and die for this shit.

8189
03:40:34,770 --> 03:40:36,710
They don't care about anything else.

8190
03:40:37,170 --> 03:40:38,140
Literally nothing more.

8191
03:40:38,190 --> 03:40:39,740
Mcdonald's Pete with them.

8192
03:40:39,800 --> 03:40:40,401
Good luck man.

8193
03:40:40,401 --> 03:40:40,880
Good luck.

8194
03:40:40,880 --> 03:40:44,300
Good luck while you're doing a
fucking radio show telling Dick Jokes,

8195
03:40:44,450 --> 03:40:46,940
this guy's hitting mitts are
getting better at the craft.

8196
03:40:47,120 --> 03:40:48,020
You just can't compete,

8197
03:40:48,021 --> 03:40:48,300
man.

8198
03:40:48,300 --> 03:40:48,590
Yup.

8199
03:40:48,590 --> 03:40:52,800
And it's his paycheck because how you
feed this family [inaudible] you're going

8200
03:40:52,801 --> 03:40:53,420
to get hurt.

8201
03:40:53,420 --> 03:40:54,400
See this time to record,

8202
03:40:54,401 --> 03:40:54,771
knock on,

8203
03:40:54,771 --> 03:40:59,771
he got knocked out by this cat
Christoph junk toe Jocko fucking name,

8204
03:41:00,681 --> 03:41:01,980
clean lefthand.

8205
03:41:02,030 --> 03:41:02,271
He was,

8206
03:41:02,271 --> 03:41:04,160
he was pressuring pressing the action,

8207
03:41:04,190 --> 03:41:08,320
looking to establish a his range
and everything is like a minute in.

8208
03:41:08,330 --> 03:41:12,350
This dude hit him with a perfectly time
lefthand like right on the eye socket.

8209
03:41:12,590 --> 03:41:14,450
Just jarred him and went down.

8210
03:41:14,460 --> 03:41:17,120
Then he finished him off
with some sick Hammerfest.

8211
03:41:17,121 --> 03:41:17,900
Check this out,

8212
03:41:17,900 --> 03:41:21,300
watch he's moving forward and this guy
had been like threatened with the left

8213
03:41:21,301 --> 03:41:21,541
hand.

8214
03:41:21,541 --> 03:41:22,910
We couldn't find his range.

8215
03:41:23,100 --> 03:41:26,570
Watch how he just slides
back and then back in.

8216
03:41:26,630 --> 03:41:30,050
Oh God damn.

8217
03:41:30,080 --> 03:41:34,820
I mean that is just thunderous hairline
difference up than heroin is dope as

8218
03:41:34,821 --> 03:41:35,091
fuck.

8219
03:41:35,091 --> 03:41:35,924
If you win,

8220
03:41:37,190 --> 03:41:39,010
it ain't good in the movie.

8221
03:41:39,011 --> 03:41:41,240
If you see gt back,

8222
03:41:41,241 --> 03:41:46,241
a man who unconscious on a bathroom
floor as he's way worse to Jason,

8223
03:41:47,290 --> 03:41:47,330
Jason,

8224
03:41:47,330 --> 03:41:48,000
Steve,

8225
03:41:48,000 --> 03:41:48,833
he's tall,

8226
03:41:48,920 --> 03:41:49,753
he's tapped out.

8227
03:41:50,980 --> 03:41:55,980
Type Tandon is holding off some weird
shit on the side of the here area and

8228
03:41:56,390 --> 03:41:57,223
stayed the man.

8229
03:41:59,830 --> 03:42:00,501
Celebrities.

8230
03:42:00,501 --> 03:42:02,060
There are the better for all of us.

8231
03:42:02,061 --> 03:42:02,670
Trust me,

8232
03:42:02,670 --> 03:42:05,720
says Mr. Full head of
hair with the [inaudible].

8233
03:42:05,860 --> 03:42:07,580
You have thick hair privilege.

8234
03:42:07,610 --> 03:42:09,470
You have super my hair falling out.

8235
03:42:09,540 --> 03:42:10,370
I'm getting old.

8236
03:42:10,370 --> 03:42:11,440
We can't listen to you.

8237
03:42:12,590 --> 03:42:13,430
I'm going to shave my head.

8238
03:42:14,510 --> 03:42:15,440
I'm going to join the bowl.

8239
03:42:15,830 --> 03:42:17,210
Well you know Tim didn't McCrory.

8240
03:42:17,211 --> 03:42:21,290
It looked really good and his last fight
man and he won by a quick knockout in

8241
03:42:21,291 --> 03:42:23,690
the first round and you know this is,

8242
03:42:23,870 --> 03:42:25,700
this is just the nature of the beast,

8243
03:42:25,701 --> 03:42:26,330
man.

8244
03:42:26,330 --> 03:42:27,230
Really good guy.

8245
03:42:27,260 --> 03:42:28,093
Strike.

8246
03:42:28,100 --> 03:42:30,620
Meanwhile a cow fucking
goddamn good cowboy.

8247
03:42:30,621 --> 03:42:34,080
Look tonight I text you the
best I saw last weekend.

8248
03:42:34,081 --> 03:42:36,180
I text you was lemme Chanko yeah,

8249
03:42:36,181 --> 03:42:37,420
he has six fucking,

8250
03:42:38,010 --> 03:42:39,010
this is boxing.

8251
03:42:39,950 --> 03:42:41,010
He has six fights.

8252
03:42:41,280 --> 03:42:43,050
He was a gold medalist in the Olympics.

8253
03:42:43,150 --> 03:42:44,190
His first pro fight.

8254
03:42:44,191 --> 03:42:44,461
He goes,

8255
03:42:44,461 --> 03:42:46,110
I won a world championship fight.

8256
03:42:46,110 --> 03:42:46,380
They go,

8257
03:42:46,380 --> 03:42:47,640
we can't give it to
you on the first fight.

8258
03:42:47,910 --> 03:42:51,450
So he gets on a second fight once
a world championship now to six,

8259
03:42:51,451 --> 03:42:53,160
five he went to another
world championship.

8260
03:42:53,460 --> 03:42:54,360
I'm telling you,

8261
03:42:54,361 --> 03:42:54,810
man,

8262
03:42:54,810 --> 03:42:57,030
this is the best pound for pound
fighter in the world right now.

8263
03:42:57,210 --> 03:42:58,260
He's bad motherfucker.

8264
03:42:58,280 --> 03:42:58,531
I'm like,

8265
03:42:58,531 --> 03:42:59,270
God,

8266
03:42:59,270 --> 03:43:00,020
you're a bad mother.

8267
03:43:00,020 --> 03:43:01,410
Those are fucking nuts.

8268
03:43:01,560 --> 03:43:02,670
If you like Dominick Cruz,

8269
03:43:02,671 --> 03:43:05,100
this guy's doing unboxing Islamic Chanko,

8270
03:43:05,101 --> 03:43:05,310
right?

8271
03:43:05,310 --> 03:43:05,920
Well with Chanko.

8272
03:43:05,920 --> 03:43:06,660
Yeah,

8273
03:43:06,660 --> 03:43:07,980
that's how you say his last name.

8274
03:43:08,010 --> 03:43:08,191
Oh,

8275
03:43:08,191 --> 03:43:08,711
it's fucking,

8276
03:43:08,711 --> 03:43:10,440
and he's a an artist in their mouth.

8277
03:43:10,470 --> 03:43:10,921
Beautiful.

8278
03:43:10,921 --> 03:43:11,431
Fun to watch.

8279
03:43:11,431 --> 03:43:12,930
But he lost to a solar lease,

8280
03:43:12,931 --> 03:43:13,170
right?

8281
03:43:13,170 --> 03:43:13,651
He did.

8282
03:43:13,651 --> 03:43:14,251
They fight again.

8283
03:43:14,251 --> 03:43:15,440
Eat fucking smoking.

8284
03:43:15,450 --> 03:43:16,470
What happened in the first fight?

8285
03:43:16,500 --> 03:43:17,160
I didn't see it.

8286
03:43:17,160 --> 03:43:20,190
It was a decision and some
people even gave to Loma Genco.

8287
03:43:20,430 --> 03:43:20,731
Well,

8288
03:43:20,731 --> 03:43:22,020
Sally's is a really good,

8289
03:43:22,021 --> 03:43:23,700
a brawling man is a tough,

8290
03:43:23,701 --> 03:43:24,301
tough dude,

8291
03:43:24,301 --> 03:43:24,990
man.

8292
03:43:24,990 --> 03:43:27,000
He's one of those bad
ass Mexican fighters.

8293
03:43:27,250 --> 03:43:27,420
You know,

8294
03:43:27,420 --> 03:43:29,130
if you go look at like bad ads,

8295
03:43:29,160 --> 03:43:30,840
blood and guts fighters,

8296
03:43:31,050 --> 03:43:36,050
if you had a look at like one nation that
continually produces bad ass blood and

8297
03:43:36,481 --> 03:43:37,314
guts fighters,

8298
03:43:37,610 --> 03:43:38,520
Mexico,

8299
03:43:38,850 --> 03:43:39,683
Mexico,

8300
03:43:40,080 --> 03:43:42,500
look at Canelo Alvarez shot man.

8301
03:43:42,570 --> 03:43:42,901
Julio,

8302
03:43:42,901 --> 03:43:43,980
Cesar Chavez,

8303
03:43:44,640 --> 03:43:46,610
Mexico has had some bad mother fuckers,

8304
03:43:46,760 --> 03:43:48,210
evil Oscar de la Hoya.

8305
03:43:48,211 --> 03:43:49,950
They don't want to give it to
him cause he's good looking.

8306
03:43:50,090 --> 03:43:50,671
God Damn.

8307
03:43:50,671 --> 03:43:51,690
And he's Mexican.

8308
03:43:51,990 --> 03:43:53,420
He's a bad motherfucker.

8309
03:43:53,430 --> 03:43:57,210
I rewatch Oscar de la Hoya vs
Julio Cesar Chavez last week.

8310
03:43:57,840 --> 03:43:58,281
God Dang,

8311
03:43:58,281 --> 03:44:00,270
I forgot who it was.

8312
03:44:02,070 --> 03:44:03,180
Golden boy was the best.

8313
03:44:03,210 --> 03:44:05,910
I saw that at the La sports
arena on close circuit.

8314
03:44:06,090 --> 03:44:08,640
Like you gotta let took a basketball
arena and you get to see it on,

8315
03:44:08,641 --> 03:44:11,880
he knows better than all of them
to me and one for Dell Marquez.

8316
03:44:11,910 --> 03:44:12,743
Fuck yeah.

8317
03:44:12,750 --> 03:44:13,021

Jim was a route to fight?

8320
03:44:19,680 --> 03:44:20,151

03:44:20,151 --> 03:44:20,260

8330
03:44:21,991 --> 03:44:22,650
It was a fight.

8331
03:44:22,650 --> 03:44:25,230

friend Terry Claiborne.

8334
03:44:28,590 --> 03:44:29,910

8335
03:44:30,360 --> 03:44:31,140

8336
03:44:31,140 --> 03:44:32,640
Marco Antonio Berrera.

8337
03:44:32,730 --> 03:44:33,900
Oh fuck man.

8338
03:44:35,270 --> 03:44:35,910
Okay.

8339
03:44:35,910 --> 03:44:36,031
Oh,

8340

So tobacco garble hall.

8342
03:44:41,340 --> 03:44:42,173
No south.

8344
03:44:42,720 --> 03:44:43,471
Who the fuck?

8345
03:44:43,471 --> 03:44:44,304

8346
03:44:45,100 --> 03:44:45,590
no.

8347
03:44:45,590 --> 03:44:47,230
That wasn't the fight that went on.

8348
03:44:47,240 --> 03:44:50,070
The God damn it too much weight.

8349
03:44:50,300 --> 03:44:51,000
Chocolate seat.

8350

They'll blow your fucking mind to,

8351
03:44:52,410 --> 03:44:54,240
Schwab's has never been
better than right now.

8352
03:44:54,270 --> 03:44:55,103
It's amazing.

8353
03:44:55,200 --> 03:44:55,321

that Prince Ahmed fight.

8359
03:45:04,720 --> 03:45:06,190

8360
03:45:06,191 --> 03:45:07,960
And who's fighting someone else?

8361

Gimme Marketing.

8364
03:45:11,570 --> 03:45:15,790
Antonio Barrera was a Wikipedia so I
could figure out which fight it was,

8365
03:45:16,080 --> 03:45:17,830
but I still wasn't sure how long ago.

8366

I think he's got a on labrea somewhere.

8373
03:45:30,491 --> 03:45:32,290
I haven't seen him in a long time.

8374
03:45:32,291 --> 03:45:33,370
It's a really cool dude.

8375
03:45:33,371 --> 03:45:34,204
I went with him,

8376
03:45:34,410 --> 03:45:35,081

8399
03:46:04,870 --> 03:46:05,311

03:46:05,311 --> 03:46:05,611

8401
03:46:05,611 --> 03:46:06,330

8403
03:46:06,991 --> 03:46:07,260

Benevidez was in 1996 on February,

8405
03:46:14,340 --> 03:46:16,260

when he was training John David Jackson,

8418
03:46:38,761 --> 03:46:41,070

a middleweight champion.

8419
03:46:41,520 --> 03:46:42,120

8420
03:46:42,120 --> 03:46:43,170

8433
03:47:04,471 --> 03:47:04,680
man.

8434
03:47:04,680 --> 03:47:05,340
Man.

8435
03:47:05,340 --> 03:47:06,240
What was it like fighting,

8436
03:47:06,330 --> 03:47:08,190
what was it like doing
commentary on his fight,

8437
03:47:08,830 --> 03:47:09,270
uh,

8438
03:47:09,270 --> 03:47:09,521
to be,

8439
03:47:09,521 --> 03:47:10,081
you did it for,

8440
03:47:10,081 --> 03:47:11,250
what would you do for cvs?

8441
03:47:11,251 --> 03:47:12,270
CBS Sports.

8442
03:47:12,271 --> 03:47:13,200
He's a,

8443
03:47:13,830 --> 03:47:14,850
he's a buddy.

8444
03:47:14,851 --> 03:47:15,930
It's tough man,

8445
03:47:15,931 --> 03:47:16,764
because

8446
03:47:18,940 --> 03:47:21,340
it's tough because
obviously past his time,

8447
03:47:21,341 --> 03:47:21,930
you know,

8448
03:47:21,930 --> 03:47:23,290
it's like he fought a lot,

8449
03:47:23,350 --> 03:47:25,150
young line and he did well,

8450
03:47:25,151 --> 03:47:25,721
but he definitely,

8451
03:47:25,721 --> 03:47:25,961
you know,

8452
03:47:25,961 --> 03:47:27,040
he probably lost the fight.

8453
03:47:27,100 --> 03:47:28,150
He definitely lost the fight,

8454
03:47:28,151 --> 03:47:29,650
but it's like,

8455
03:47:29,651 --> 03:47:30,670
where do you go from here?

8456
03:47:30,740 --> 03:47:31,331
Here's like the,

8457
03:47:31,331 --> 03:47:32,470
where that fight fights.

8458
03:47:32,770 --> 03:47:33,730
Thurman.

8459
03:47:34,450 --> 03:47:36,010
Thurman or border.

8460
03:47:36,100 --> 03:47:36,400
Yeah,

8461
03:47:36,400 --> 03:47:36,761
both guys.

8462
03:47:36,761 --> 03:47:37,750
What are you going to do with that?

8463
03:47:37,790 --> 03:47:37,950
Right.

8464
03:47:37,950 --> 03:47:38,783
You can do with that.

8465
03:47:39,070 --> 03:47:39,230
Well,

8466
03:47:39,230 --> 03:47:39,671
you know,

8467
03:47:39,671 --> 03:47:40,750
here's my question.

8468
03:47:40,900 --> 03:47:41,760
I don't know thing.

8469
03:47:42,040 --> 03:47:43,330
We know each other where I can say,

8470
03:47:43,331 --> 03:47:43,781
hey brother,

8471
03:47:43,781 --> 03:47:44,614
what are you doing?

8472
03:47:45,370 --> 03:47:47,210
How do you distinguish a guy
like Shane Mosley from a garlic,

8473
03:47:47,230 --> 03:47:50,110
Bernard Hopkins like Gag Bernard Hopkins.

8474
03:47:50,590 --> 03:47:52,510
If he thinks that he can fight somebody,

8475
03:47:52,511 --> 03:47:54,400
I want to see him see if
he can fight that guy.

8476
03:47:54,460 --> 03:47:54,951
Even if it,

8477
03:47:54,951 --> 03:47:57,940
even though he's 49 or
almost 50 I mean that guy,

8478
03:47:58,510 --> 03:48:02,540
the only guy that really kind of
dismantled his defense was Kovalev Kavala.

8479
03:48:02,560 --> 03:48:03,790
Put them in some real trouble.

8480
03:48:03,820 --> 03:48:04,390
Real trouble.

8481
03:48:04,390 --> 03:48:06,100
Kovalev to me might be
the best in the world.

8482
03:48:06,101 --> 03:48:06,700
Pound for pound.

8483
03:48:06,700 --> 03:48:07,600
He's one of them.

8484
03:48:07,660 --> 03:48:09,790
He's done top three could article Lufkin.

8485
03:48:09,820 --> 03:48:13,030
Him apparently had some
wars and some boxing wars.

8486
03:48:13,031 --> 03:48:15,370
That's the rumors are they're both nasty,

8487
03:48:15,760 --> 03:48:17,320
nasty fucking knockout.

8488
03:48:17,321 --> 03:48:18,730
Russia's own combat sports.

8489
03:48:18,940 --> 03:48:20,140
Really think about it.

8490
03:48:20,170 --> 03:48:22,750
Not really named one UFC Russian champion

8491
03:48:24,340 --> 03:48:25,060
Nigga,

8492
03:48:25,060 --> 03:48:25,893
Nigga Madoff.

8493
03:48:25,930 --> 03:48:26,763
Do I get him?

8494
03:48:27,280 --> 03:48:28,113
He'll be

8495
03:48:32,780 --> 03:48:34,940
jumping to conclusions.

8496
03:48:34,941 --> 03:48:36,020
He might have some good shit.

8497
03:48:37,370 --> 03:48:38,720
Habib's on defeated.

8498
03:48:38,721 --> 03:48:39,554
Just injuries.

8499
03:48:39,620 --> 03:48:40,431
Stopped him here.

8500
03:48:40,431 --> 03:48:41,810
He beat the champion of Santos.

8501
03:48:42,480 --> 03:48:43,530
He's 55

8502
03:48:45,570 --> 03:48:47,050
he's the outlier and fuck,

8503
03:48:47,980 --> 03:48:48,380
goddamn.

8504
03:48:48,380 --> 03:48:49,880
He's a fucking,

8505
03:48:50,270 --> 03:48:51,200
there's a lot of them bud.

8506
03:48:51,720 --> 03:48:54,740
Some fury fury just
beat Vladimir Klitschko.

8507
03:48:54,800 --> 03:48:55,670
They're fighting again.

8508
03:48:55,820 --> 03:48:55,971
Yeah,

8509
03:48:55,971 --> 03:48:57,680
but Tyson fury just beat Bladimir.

8510
03:48:57,681 --> 03:48:58,730
Klitschko correct.

8511
03:48:58,820 --> 03:48:59,480
Okay.

8512
03:48:59,480 --> 03:49:00,011
Coville off.

8513
03:49:00,011 --> 03:49:00,844
Good luck.

8514
03:49:01,080 --> 03:49:01,913
Good luck.

8515
03:49:02,480 --> 03:49:03,890
But Andre Ward might be able to beat him.

8516
03:49:03,980 --> 03:49:04,813
I don't think so.

8517
03:49:05,300 --> 03:49:06,880
He better fight more than fracking.

8518
03:49:06,881 --> 03:49:08,840
So confident Brendan,

8519
03:49:11,000 --> 03:49:12,530
Brendan and boxing right now.

8520
03:49:12,531 --> 03:49:16,100
Is there an African
American heavy weight boxer?

8521
03:49:16,460 --> 03:49:17,540
Fucking vicious,

8522
03:49:17,541 --> 03:49:17,811
nasty,

8523
03:49:17,811 --> 03:49:18,320
wilder.

8524
03:49:18,320 --> 03:49:18,580
Oh,

8525
03:49:18,580 --> 03:49:19,990
Anthony Joshua from England's.

8526
03:49:19,991 --> 03:49:21,000
I'll fucking look.

8527
03:49:22,040 --> 03:49:22,900
Joshua [inaudible].

8528
03:49:23,030 --> 03:49:23,863
Joshua,

8529
03:49:24,140 --> 03:49:25,790
when he looks like he'd win the Olympia,

8530
03:49:25,791 --> 03:49:25,941
right.

8531
03:49:25,941 --> 03:49:28,970
Look at this poll about who
they want Wonderboy to fight.

8532
03:49:28,971 --> 03:49:31,310
63% of the people said Wonderboy.

8533
03:49:31,670 --> 03:49:35,510
9% of Damien Maia like past our good.

8534
03:49:37,430 --> 03:49:39,210
It's just cause people won't see Nakia.

8535
03:49:39,440 --> 03:49:44,440
That gigantic killer praying that this
world champion Jiu Jitsu straggler.

8536
03:49:44,571 --> 03:49:48,590
Fuck that Damien Maia
puts the chuck two people.

8537
03:49:48,591 --> 03:49:50,510
My friend love watching
dude and line right now.

8538
03:49:51,260 --> 03:49:52,460
This fight was interesting,

8539
03:49:52,461 --> 03:49:52,611
man.

8540
03:49:52,611 --> 03:49:53,211
I was watching,

8541
03:49:53,211 --> 03:49:55,130
this is Chris Beall was tagging Joe Soto,

8542
03:49:55,131 --> 03:49:57,110
but Joe Soto was moving with Shit.

8543
03:49:57,290 --> 03:50:01,670
He was constantly pressuring him and he
got him to the ground and took his back.

8544
03:50:02,120 --> 03:50:03,940
This he's fighting the next CDI.

8545
03:50:04,000 --> 03:50:06,400
He's getting lit up cost Soto Joseph.

8546
03:50:07,790 --> 03:50:09,020
He's a David [inaudible] Guy,

8547
03:50:09,021 --> 03:50:09,320
right?

8548
03:50:09,320 --> 03:50:09,680
Yeah.

8549
03:50:09,680 --> 03:50:14,420
He's a brown belt and gave it to the
finals against Eddie Cummings and Ebi for

8550
03:50:14,421 --> 03:50:15,254
the last time.

8551
03:50:15,680 --> 03:50:15,921
Yeah.

8552
03:50:15,921 --> 03:50:17,000
You don't want to enter the fine.

8553
03:50:17,010 --> 03:50:19,490
He yelled something to me and I wanted
to talk to you about this because he

8554
03:50:19,491 --> 03:50:21,800
yelled something to me during the fall,

8555
03:50:21,830 --> 03:50:23,150
after he won his last fight.

8556
03:50:26,240 --> 03:50:26,781
He was like,

8557
03:50:26,781 --> 03:50:27,770
I didn't grease up.

8558
03:50:27,771 --> 03:50:29,060
I didn't grease up dude.

8559
03:50:29,061 --> 03:50:30,500
I don't know what you're,

8560
03:50:30,620 --> 03:50:34,790
I dunno what y'all are like as if I
knew it because of him telling any,

8561
03:50:34,791 --> 03:50:35,624
I didn't grease up.

8562
03:50:35,800 --> 03:50:38,270
So it was about misunderstanding.

8563
03:50:38,380 --> 03:50:39,213
Um,

8564
03:50:39,440 --> 03:50:40,273
well if you're totally,

8565
03:50:40,400 --> 03:50:42,530
totally well either way,

8566
03:50:42,531 --> 03:50:42,790
man.

8567
03:50:42,790 --> 03:50:43,623
Super suspect.

8568
03:50:43,740 --> 03:50:44,230
Ooh.

8569
03:50:44,230 --> 03:50:47,090
Well he was just trying to clarify to
me because he knew that they were on

8570
03:50:47,091 --> 03:50:47,924
commercial,

8571
03:50:48,170 --> 03:50:49,040
but it was um,

8572
03:50:49,070 --> 03:50:49,903
whatever.

8573
03:50:49,940 --> 03:50:50,773
That doesn't matter.

8574
03:50:50,810 --> 03:50:52,430
What he did tonight was beautiful,

8575
03:50:52,710 --> 03:50:53,550
beautiful grappling.

8576
03:50:53,580 --> 03:50:54,260
You take them.

8577
03:50:54,260 --> 03:50:56,480
He took us back to why I
said a real strong way.

8578
03:50:56,600 --> 03:50:59,480
It took us back in the second
and the third and I was like,

8579
03:50:59,481 --> 03:50:59,930
man,

8580
03:50:59,930 --> 03:51:01,370
he can threaten.

8581
03:51:01,430 --> 03:51:02,330
Cause once he gets to the,

8582
03:51:02,360 --> 03:51:03,470
once he got to the ground,

8583
03:51:03,710 --> 03:51:05,930
he was taking his back like really quick.

8584
03:51:06,280 --> 03:51:06,590
Oh,

8585
03:51:06,590 --> 03:51:08,090
super quick.

8586
03:51:09,050 --> 03:51:10,340
Like knife through butter.

8587
03:51:10,430 --> 03:51:10,701
Yeah.

8588
03:51:10,701 --> 03:51:13,090
It wasn't like he was in danger issues.

8589
03:51:13,180 --> 03:51:13,771
First off,

8590
03:51:13,771 --> 03:51:17,210
it's more of like how quickly would
he be able to progress to the back.

8591
03:51:17,240 --> 03:51:18,230
It was just a matter of time.

8592
03:51:18,240 --> 03:51:19,070
Forget his neck.

8593
03:51:19,070 --> 03:51:20,060
He's a very good grappler,

8594
03:51:20,061 --> 03:51:20,331
man.

8595
03:51:20,331 --> 03:51:21,141
Very good grappler.

8596
03:51:21,141 --> 03:51:21,501
Amazing.

8597
03:51:21,501 --> 03:51:23,280
I wasn't aware of how
good he was to be honest.

8598
03:51:23,380 --> 03:51:23,781
David.

8599
03:51:23,781 --> 03:51:25,890
Tarell guys are fucking animals.

8600
03:51:25,920 --> 03:51:30,510
Everyone I know says David trail is in
the training room is the biggest fucking

8601
03:51:30,511 --> 03:51:31,410
freak of all time.

8602
03:51:31,440 --> 03:51:34,260
It'll all the like the
legendary stories I hear.

8603
03:51:34,261 --> 03:51:34,580
They,

8604
03:51:34,580 --> 03:51:37,590
everyone tells me David
[inaudible] a mother fucker dude.

8605
03:51:37,591 --> 03:51:42,420
We saw her legendary stories from everyone
grapple in his prime in Abu Dhabi in

8606
03:51:42,421 --> 03:51:44,580
2003 back when uh,

8607
03:51:44,640 --> 03:51:45,630
Eddie went down there.

8608
03:51:45,930 --> 03:51:47,700
I saw him like in his prime.

8609
03:51:47,701 --> 03:51:49,190
He got some really high level guys.

8610
03:51:49,191 --> 03:51:49,741
See I heard,

8611
03:51:49,741 --> 03:51:52,140
I heard eating that I heard even then,

8612
03:51:52,141 --> 03:51:54,210
he never lived up to his potential.

8613
03:51:54,211 --> 03:51:55,050
I heard in the trains.

8614
03:51:55,090 --> 03:51:55,591
I'm telling you,

8615
03:51:55,591 --> 03:51:57,210
I've heard like it at,

8616
03:51:57,211 --> 03:51:58,110
I've never grabbed the guy.

8617
03:51:58,140 --> 03:51:58,973
I don't know.

8618
03:51:59,010 --> 03:52:01,290
I think I've met him
once passing through UFC.

8619
03:52:02,610 --> 03:52:03,690
He's like a Centaur.

8620
03:52:03,700 --> 03:52:07,590
Like he's the stories I hear from
other people and legit people are nuts.

8621
03:52:07,650 --> 03:52:12,650
One thing that was clear with Joe Soto
and Ebi for was his leg locks were really

8622
03:52:12,811 --> 03:52:15,440
good in his leg lock
defense hasn't trail enough.

8623
03:52:15,530 --> 03:52:15,780
Yeah,

8624
03:52:15,780 --> 03:52:16,890
and it was because of Dave truck.

8625
03:52:17,400 --> 03:52:21,600
He's been all about leg locks for the
last 10 15 years and he got to the finals

8626
03:52:21,900 --> 03:52:24,660
against Eddie Cummings who just
leg locked three dudes in a row.

8627
03:52:25,130 --> 03:52:27,630
And you would think nobody ever
sits on their ass in place.

8628
03:52:27,631 --> 03:52:28,750
Footsies with any Cummins.

8629
03:52:28,751 --> 03:52:29,970
They genuinely don't that.

8630
03:52:30,290 --> 03:52:30,460
Yeah.

8631
03:52:30,460 --> 03:52:30,901
That's like,

8632
03:52:30,901 --> 03:52:31,141
okay,

8633
03:52:31,141 --> 03:52:31,470
let's,

8634
03:52:31,470 --> 03:52:34,170
let's try to get around those
legs and try to play smash.

8635
03:52:34,320 --> 03:52:35,310
That's what everyone's trying to do.

8636
03:52:35,311 --> 03:52:37,500
They don't want to go like for
legs with no Eddie Cummins.

8637
03:52:37,620 --> 03:52:41,870
But Joe Soto did in the
fucking Tony and no,

8638
03:52:42,120 --> 03:52:42,440
no,

8639
03:52:42,440 --> 03:52:42,900
no.

8640
03:52:42,900 --> 03:52:43,710
But Eddie Cummings is,

8641
03:52:43,710 --> 03:52:44,461
he's the champion.

8642
03:52:44,461 --> 03:52:45,930
He's coming back to defend the belt.

8643
03:52:45,931 --> 03:52:46,860
That's a Saturday,

8644
03:52:47,100 --> 03:52:49,050
July 16th on fight pass.

8645
03:52:49,080 --> 03:52:49,913
Boom.

8646
03:52:51,720 --> 03:52:53,550
Ebi On fucking five pounds.

8647
03:52:54,800 --> 03:52:55,560
So good.

8648
03:52:55,560 --> 03:52:56,251
It's going well.

8649
03:52:56,251 --> 03:52:57,370
So good and Fucker,

8650
03:52:57,570 --> 03:53:02,370
it's took best grappling format that's
ever been created far which is such a

8651
03:53:02,371 --> 03:53:03,121
smart move,

8652
03:53:03,121 --> 03:53:03,360
man.

8653
03:53:03,360 --> 03:53:04,960
Have Fun when you guys went fucking.

8654
03:53:05,940 --> 03:53:08,400
But it's fights moving wheel fucking white

8655
03:53:12,080 --> 03:53:13,170
about five shows.

8656
03:53:13,530 --> 03:53:17,080
Is that the one thing that king of the
cage had that no one else had is they

8657
03:53:17,081 --> 03:53:18,360
would have to 13 fights,

8658
03:53:18,600 --> 03:53:19,800
but there would be no waiting.

8659
03:53:19,801 --> 03:53:21,120
As soon as one fight was done,

8660
03:53:21,150 --> 03:53:21,780
boom,

8661
03:53:21,780 --> 03:53:22,710
they start the next fight.

8662
03:53:22,711 --> 03:53:23,320
Bam.

8663
03:53:23,320 --> 03:53:23,810
As that.

8664
03:53:23,810 --> 03:53:24,481
That's a bad idea.

8665
03:53:24,481 --> 03:53:27,210
But I hear you for Judah to for well,

8666
03:53:27,240 --> 03:53:31,620
for anything it's great because it
just moves the show along and you know,

8667
03:53:31,950 --> 03:53:32,131
uh,

8668
03:53:32,131 --> 03:53:32,700
we were,

8669
03:53:32,700 --> 03:53:32,881
uh,

8670
03:53:32,881 --> 03:53:35,700
behind schedule because we've had to do
everything in a three hour block because

8671
03:53:35,701 --> 03:53:37,260
of paper view and we're behind.

8672
03:53:37,261 --> 03:53:39,000
So we weren't even showing replace.

8673
03:53:39,000 --> 03:53:40,320
People thought that that was our style.

8674
03:53:40,321 --> 03:53:41,101
We don't show replays.

8675
03:53:41,101 --> 03:53:43,130
Like we didn't even have
time for replaced go.

8676
03:53:43,190 --> 03:53:43,810
We were just go,

8677
03:53:43,810 --> 03:53:44,041
go,

8678
03:53:44,041 --> 03:53:44,290
go,

8679
03:53:44,290 --> 03:53:45,123
go.

8680
03:53:45,330 --> 03:53:49,050
Is that little girl
still ripping heels off?

8681
03:53:49,410 --> 03:53:49,801
Which one?

8682
03:53:49,801 --> 03:53:50,634
He turned my grace.

8683
03:53:50,670 --> 03:53:51,570
You know what I'm talking about?

8684
03:53:51,630 --> 03:53:52,980
The only one ripping heels off.

8685
03:53:53,070 --> 03:53:53,940
Oh Riley,

8686
03:53:54,690 --> 03:53:57,150
she's gonna fight soul
snatcher in September.

8687
03:53:57,260 --> 03:53:57,990
You're better.

8688
03:53:57,990 --> 03:53:58,340
Yeah,

8689
03:53:58,340 --> 03:53:59,040
we gotta find a,

8690
03:53:59,040 --> 03:53:59,761
an opponent for,

8691
03:53:59,761 --> 03:54:00,710
we don't have an opponent for it,

8692
03:54:00,711 --> 03:54:03,390
but grace is fighting
and Ebi seven as well.

8693
03:54:03,391 --> 03:54:07,770
I'm super curious to see how this is
received because as a person who loves

8694
03:54:07,771 --> 03:54:08,604
Jujitsu,

8695
03:54:09,060 --> 03:54:10,450
and I think we could all agree on this,

8696
03:54:10,470 --> 03:54:12,450
like one of the big problems that
you've been involved in these kinds of

8697
03:54:12,451 --> 03:54:12,811
matches,

8698
03:54:12,811 --> 03:54:16,110
they go to draw and it's like a lot
of them go to draw and you'll have a

8699
03:54:16,111 --> 03:54:18,880
professional matches four five
six in a row and nothing happened.

8700
03:54:18,881 --> 03:54:20,250
Super Boring and nothing happened.

8701
03:54:20,400 --> 03:54:20,990
The,

8702
03:54:20,990 --> 03:54:22,890
the draws are boring though.

8703
03:54:22,891 --> 03:54:23,890
Some are amazing

8704
03:54:24,940 --> 03:54:29,940
on 100% peritoneum versus who said mark
behind the great draw for the public.

8705
03:54:31,721 --> 03:54:32,860
They're not trying to see that

8706
03:54:34,480 --> 03:54:34,770
joy.

8707
03:54:34,770 --> 03:54:35,890
The mouth finishes.

8708
03:54:35,920 --> 03:54:36,281
Yeah,

8709
03:54:36,281 --> 03:54:37,120
but they still enjoy them.

8710
03:54:37,121 --> 03:54:40,030
Not just saying if you out
ratings you need finishes or none.

8711
03:54:40,031 --> 03:54:42,910
That's what you mean sort of.

8712
03:54:42,911 --> 03:54:47,911
But I see your point too because there's
something interesting about a fight

8713
03:54:47,950 --> 03:54:51,550
that gets that close to being finished
several times with a guy escapes and you

8714
03:54:51,551 --> 03:54:54,100
don't know exactly what's going to
happen and there's a lot of drama.

8715
03:54:54,310 --> 03:54:56,020
And then it gets to the
end and it still drama,

8716
03:54:56,050 --> 03:54:59,800
but it would be infinitely better
if then they moved into your format.

8717
03:54:59,830 --> 03:55:04,830
That's what they went to draw was pretty
good because it was a technical jujitsu

8718
03:55:04,901 --> 03:55:05,231
battle,

8719
03:55:05,231 --> 03:55:09,580
but your format makes that draw one of
the best fights in the history of the

8720
03:55:09,581 --> 03:55:10,414
world

8721
03:55:12,740 --> 03:55:15,700
because all of a sudden the has got
Jake shields back and he starts,

8722
03:55:15,701 --> 03:55:19,030
he starts with the over under or Jake's
got his back and he starts to go over

8723
03:55:19,031 --> 03:55:19,211
under,

8724
03:55:19,211 --> 03:55:19,870
that's all I'm saying.

8725
03:55:19,870 --> 03:55:24,610
Any your format proves that we want to
see people try and finish because if you

8726
03:55:24,611 --> 03:55:25,870
have the metamor style though,

8727
03:55:25,930 --> 03:55:29,690
it proves that that
thing's not working styles.

8728
03:55:30,730 --> 03:55:32,530
Is that your style?

8729
03:55:32,650 --> 03:55:34,270
That could work the metamor style.

8730
03:55:34,390 --> 03:55:38,550
If there was more incentive
to win instead of a draw,

8731
03:55:38,590 --> 03:55:39,670
there's men an incentive.

8732
03:55:39,850 --> 03:55:40,481
People were like,

8733
03:55:40,481 --> 03:55:42,050
you don't want to lose weight set up off.

8734
03:55:42,860 --> 03:55:43,870
The problem is,

8735
03:55:44,080 --> 03:55:45,700
the problem with the
draws is when you have,

8736
03:55:45,790 --> 03:55:47,710
when it's clear that the
one of the fighters are,

8737
03:55:47,711 --> 03:55:50,140
both of the fighters are
totally satisfied with the draw.

8738
03:55:50,141 --> 03:55:50,441
They're like,

8739
03:55:50,441 --> 03:55:50,811
fuck it.

8740
03:55:50,811 --> 03:55:51,644
Who you tell him.

8741
03:55:51,880 --> 03:55:52,600
You know what I mean?

8742
03:55:52,600 --> 03:55:54,070
As long as there's then,

8743
03:55:54,340 --> 03:55:55,780
then it's a problem,

8744
03:55:56,020 --> 03:55:56,321
you know?

8745
03:55:56,321 --> 03:55:58,840
But if two guys are really going after it,

8746
03:55:58,990 --> 03:55:59,890
then it's not a problem.

8747
03:55:59,950 --> 03:56:01,900
So how do you make guys
to really go after it?

8748
03:56:02,080 --> 03:56:03,160
You got to make it up.

8749
03:56:03,161 --> 03:56:04,260
Finance Bi.

8750
03:56:04,420 --> 03:56:05,620
Well there you go.

8751
03:56:05,621 --> 03:56:06,454
What are we talking about?

8752
03:56:08,320 --> 03:56:09,153
I'm trying.

8753
03:56:09,320 --> 03:56:10,990
You have to do Ebi rules.

8754
03:56:10,991 --> 03:56:12,760
Otherwise you from saying it's all good.

8755
03:56:13,000 --> 03:56:16,360
It's a beautiful Porsche just wiped out.

8756
03:56:16,361 --> 03:56:17,590
It was so depressing.

8757
03:56:18,650 --> 03:56:19,960
Got Destroyed.

8758
03:56:20,170 --> 03:56:22,620
Some crazy race and for gt GTVs fried.

8759
03:56:22,621 --> 03:56:25,850
I don't know what the races
but some of them on social,

8760
03:56:25,960 --> 03:56:28,210
just scorched teen hybrid.

8761
03:56:28,211 --> 03:56:32,220
What hybrid on my phone guys
are all experts aren't too.

8762
03:56:32,290 --> 03:56:33,190
These people are nuts.

8763
03:56:33,191 --> 03:56:35,320
Who knows more about cars all day?

8764
03:56:35,420 --> 03:56:36,700
Joel question for sure.

8765
03:56:36,770 --> 03:56:38,260
You're like a blue belt
and he's like a black belt,

8766
03:56:38,261 --> 03:56:38,920
right?

8767
03:56:38,920 --> 03:56:39,341
Yeah.

8768
03:56:39,341 --> 03:56:40,710
I'd say I'm a junk car.

8769
03:56:40,720 --> 03:56:42,390
Magazines for the last 20 Saul,

8770
03:56:43,510 --> 03:56:45,520
he's in a car wreck since I've known him.

8771
03:56:45,570 --> 03:56:47,500
He's balls deep and like fixing the cars.

8772
03:56:47,590 --> 03:56:48,250
I'm a fan.

8773
03:56:48,250 --> 03:56:50,050
I'm a fascinated person.

8774
03:56:50,080 --> 03:56:52,540
I'm easily fascinated by
engineering discipline.

8775
03:56:52,650 --> 03:56:54,070
You know the ins and outs of it,

8776
03:56:54,071 --> 03:56:55,630
like like archery shooting.

8777
03:56:55,631 --> 03:56:57,250
You're going to spend 20 hours on it.

8778
03:56:57,550 --> 03:56:59,800
I'll spend an hour on it and
I'll move on to something else.

8779
03:56:59,801 --> 03:57:00,820
Then I'll come back the next day.

8780
03:57:00,821 --> 03:57:01,654
Another hour.

8781
03:57:01,780 --> 03:57:02,531
Not everything though,

8782
03:57:02,531 --> 03:57:03,360
ma'am.

8783
03:57:03,360 --> 03:57:04,520
You're into it though.

8784
03:57:04,580 --> 03:57:05,950
You show us the ring.

8785
03:57:05,980 --> 03:57:06,371
Yeah.

8786
03:57:06,371 --> 03:57:07,330
You're selling into it.

8787
03:57:07,680 --> 03:57:08,513
It's a mental problem.

8788
03:57:08,930 --> 03:57:09,780
There's something wrong with me.

8789
03:57:09,850 --> 03:57:10,790
You had that NSF.

8790
03:57:11,330 --> 03:57:12,220
Jesus Christ.

8791
03:57:12,240 --> 03:57:14,350
It's a corvette wiped out,

8792
03:57:14,730 --> 03:57:16,360
but that's a beautiful car to Jesus.

8793
03:57:16,361 --> 03:57:17,194
Fucking,

8794
03:57:18,310 --> 03:57:19,560
oh my God.

8795
03:57:20,490 --> 03:57:21,840
Asian Nascar drivers.

8796
03:57:23,640 --> 03:57:25,000
First Asian Nascar drivers.

8797
03:57:25,001 --> 03:57:26,220
So recessed we're setting.

8798
03:57:27,320 --> 03:57:29,150
I would protest against sense.

8799
03:57:30,860 --> 03:57:33,110
Jesus got one job.

8800
03:57:33,140 --> 03:57:35,840
You drive in a psalm and you
know those things break dude.

8801
03:57:36,200 --> 03:57:37,250
Shit goes wrong.

8802
03:57:38,230 --> 03:57:39,770
All of that in a corvette.

8803
03:57:39,950 --> 03:57:40,820
Now that's a different one.

8804
03:57:41,320 --> 03:57:41,680
Oh,

8805
03:57:41,680 --> 03:57:43,510
I guess they have a bunch
of fucking accidents.

8806
03:57:43,840 --> 03:57:44,900
That one's on fire,

8807
03:57:44,990 --> 03:57:45,261
Yo.

8808
03:57:45,261 --> 03:57:46,130
That's no big deal.

8809
03:57:46,190 --> 03:57:46,760
What is that?

8810
03:57:46,760 --> 03:57:49,220
That's like a Batmobile you
have to run at this point.

8811
03:57:49,310 --> 03:57:49,521
Yeah,

8812
03:57:49,521 --> 03:57:49,830
you should.

8813
03:57:49,830 --> 03:57:50,940
Oh Shit.

8814
03:57:50,941 --> 03:57:51,774
Oh my God.

8815
03:57:51,890 --> 03:57:52,191
Damn.

8816
03:57:52,191 --> 03:57:52,990
This car racing.

8817
03:57:52,990 --> 03:57:53,823
Just got

8818
03:57:55,080 --> 03:57:55,913
any movies.

8819
03:57:55,960 --> 03:57:58,850
What happens at that point that you've
got to get the fuck out of dodge before

8820
03:57:58,851 --> 03:58:00,020
you become a part of the problem.

8821
03:58:00,230 --> 03:58:03,470
I want them to look like
actual cars that are dope.

8822
03:58:03,530 --> 03:58:08,030
I think racing is fucking
probably so unbelievably exciting,

8823
03:58:08,031 --> 03:58:11,870
but the consequences are
absolutely devastated.

8824
03:58:12,200 --> 03:58:12,890
You Die.

8825
03:58:12,890 --> 03:58:14,780
How crazy do you have to
be to race a car like that?

8826
03:58:15,610 --> 03:58:16,443
They all crazy.

8827
03:58:16,460 --> 03:58:16,821
No,

8828
03:58:16,821 --> 03:58:20,090
they develop a real good sense
of how to control the car.

8829
03:58:20,120 --> 03:58:23,630
And then at a high level you're around
a lot of other people with a really good

8830
03:58:23,631 --> 03:58:26,570
sense of how to control car and
then you got to mind each other.

8831
03:58:26,571 --> 03:58:28,250
And that was like one of the things about,

8832
03:58:28,251 --> 03:58:29,030
um,

8833
03:58:29,030 --> 03:58:30,110
that fucking dude,

8834
03:58:30,380 --> 03:58:30,920
uh,

8835
03:58:30,920 --> 03:58:31,520
uh,

8836
03:58:31,520 --> 03:58:32,480
Ayrton Senna.

8837
03:58:33,080 --> 03:58:35,480
If you ever seen that
documentary on Ayrton Senna,

8838
03:58:35,510 --> 03:58:40,510
he's a Brazilian guy who was a formula
one racer who was extremely aggressive.

8839
03:58:40,880 --> 03:58:41,900
I think it's Formula One.

8840
03:58:41,901 --> 03:58:42,830
He's a race car driver.

8841
03:58:43,100 --> 03:58:44,420
I don't know much about this stuff.

8842
03:58:44,630 --> 03:58:46,550
I believe that he was Formula One,

8843
03:58:47,030 --> 03:58:50,180
but if they had a documentary
on him and was fucking genius,

8844
03:58:50,181 --> 03:58:50,421
man,

8845
03:58:50,421 --> 03:58:51,254
it's brilliant.

8846
03:58:51,620 --> 03:58:56,620
He was just this dude who just felt
where the car was going at a level,

8847
03:58:57,051 --> 03:59:02,051
like at an understanding that very few
people ever get to and he would push it

8848
03:59:02,151 --> 03:59:03,890
to that fucking limit.

8849
03:59:04,280 --> 03:59:08,360
He like had this feeling for what
a car could and couldn't do and he,

8850
03:59:08,361 --> 03:59:12,800
he better than almost anybody of his
era could get the car to that limit and

8851
03:59:12,801 --> 03:59:13,810
everybody was scared of him.

8852
03:59:13,870 --> 03:59:14,481
That's pretty cool.

8853
03:59:14,481 --> 03:59:15,550
Super Dangerous.

8854
03:59:15,560 --> 03:59:19,070
You got a Porsche nine 11 g r s
you need to step your game up.

8855
03:59:19,071 --> 03:59:19,904
Joe.

8856
03:59:20,150 --> 03:59:23,360
Look your gt three C I
don't want to do those.

8857
03:59:23,940 --> 03:59:24,360
Yeah,

8858
03:59:24,360 --> 03:59:25,193
he do.

8859
03:59:25,370 --> 03:59:26,090
He do.

8860
03:59:26,090 --> 03:59:26,960
I definitely don't.

8861
03:59:27,020 --> 03:59:29,090
I like going [inaudible] damn.

8862
03:59:29,150 --> 03:59:30,440
One step below this.

8863
03:59:30,740 --> 03:59:31,340
It is,

8864
03:59:31,340 --> 03:59:34,970
but I like to go through a canyon and
a slightly unreasonable race rate of

8865
03:59:34,971 --> 03:59:35,600
speed.

8866
03:59:35,600 --> 03:59:36,410
That's it.

8867
03:59:36,410 --> 03:59:37,071
Just slightly.

8868
03:59:37,071 --> 03:59:37,180
I,

8869
03:59:37,180 --> 03:59:37,360
Hey,

8870
03:59:37,360 --> 03:59:37,581
hey,

8871
03:59:37,581 --> 03:59:38,414
slow down.

8872
03:59:39,220 --> 03:59:39,950
Let's take it easy.

8873
03:59:39,950 --> 03:59:42,140
I or hear a rumble shift.

8874
03:59:42,160 --> 03:59:44,360
I like to feel a car
pulling into a corner.

8875
03:59:44,540 --> 03:59:46,220
I don't need to break the law that deep.

8876
03:59:46,520 --> 03:59:47,930
These motherfuckers are crazy,

8877
03:59:48,290 --> 03:59:48,531
dude.

8878
03:59:48,531 --> 03:59:49,364
I love me.

8879
03:59:50,360 --> 03:59:52,790
How often do you guys die in this racing?

8880
03:59:52,880 --> 03:59:53,001
Oh,

8881
03:59:53,001 --> 03:59:53,870
they die all the time.

8882
03:59:57,200 --> 03:59:57,951
Not so much.

8883
03:59:57,951 --> 04:00:01,850
And how often they had a bunch of
regulations put in place after like Dale

8884
04:00:01,850 --> 04:00:02,683
Earnhardt died for

8885
04:00:05,170 --> 04:00:05,480
one.

8886
04:00:05,480 --> 04:00:09,770
You're talking about Nascar over
f what I'm thinking about this,

8887
04:00:09,771 --> 04:00:11,810
what kind of sport other
than race car driving,

8888
04:00:12,120 --> 04:00:15,320
there's like one of the number one guys
die on the job and everybody's like,

8889
04:00:15,330 --> 04:00:16,163
well

8890
04:00:17,900 --> 04:00:19,350
they can get really bad now.

8891
04:00:19,351 --> 04:00:20,820
And there's the walk away from it.

8892
04:00:20,940 --> 04:00:22,330
Is it because of the new technology?

8893
04:00:22,830 --> 04:00:24,630
They barely are moving
in those little cockpits.

8894
04:00:24,631 --> 04:00:25,464
Their heads are.

8895
04:00:26,920 --> 04:00:28,530
That's actually really good news,

8896
04:00:28,531 --> 04:00:28,830
man.

8897
04:00:28,830 --> 04:00:29,663
I wish I knew that.

8898
04:00:30,390 --> 04:00:31,080
I do know that.

8899
04:00:31,080 --> 04:00:31,920
Thank you Jamie.

8900
04:00:32,040 --> 04:00:32,790
Thank you.

8901
04:00:32,790 --> 04:00:36,990
Well that's awesome that they figured
that out and it definitely is a comfort,

8902
04:00:37,170 --> 04:00:41,910
but it's still a dangerous sport but
dangerous endeavor and these guys are

8903
04:00:41,911 --> 04:00:42,721
athletes for sure.

8904
04:00:42,721 --> 04:00:42,991
Right?

8905
04:00:42,991 --> 04:00:43,824
I would agree.

8906
04:00:44,520 --> 04:00:46,050
It takes a lot of fucking,

8907
04:00:46,110 --> 04:00:47,380
you gotta be tuned in.

8908
04:00:47,880 --> 04:00:48,900
It's exhausting.

8909
04:00:49,150 --> 04:00:52,370
Some of these guys are great
man to physical activity.

8910
04:00:53,460 --> 04:00:54,330
It's arguable.

8911
04:00:54,331 --> 04:00:56,130
It's not athletes in the same extent.

8912
04:00:56,310 --> 04:01:00,030
It's not an athlete to the same extent
as like an MMA fighter or a basketball

8913
04:01:00,031 --> 04:01:04,200
player or someone who relies on
endurance as well as explosive ability.

8914
04:01:07,240 --> 04:01:08,700
This my thing just as a physical,

8915
04:01:08,701 --> 04:01:09,810
how is this any different?

8916
04:01:09,811 --> 04:01:10,410
Well yet,

8917
04:01:10,410 --> 04:01:11,340
how's it any different?

8918
04:01:11,341 --> 04:01:16,341
If I play a race car game
on my couch in a Sauna,

8919
04:01:16,560 --> 04:01:17,140
oh,

8920
04:01:17,140 --> 04:01:18,150
we can't die.

8921
04:01:18,151 --> 04:01:18,781
You fuck.

8922
04:01:18,781 --> 04:01:19,051
Okay,

8923
04:01:19,051 --> 04:01:22,170
so kind of question is
that this is real shit.

8924
04:01:22,290 --> 04:01:23,780
If you play a game on your day,

8925
04:01:23,790 --> 04:01:24,623
barely,

8926
04:01:25,020 --> 04:01:25,791
they barely ever die.

8927
04:01:25,791 --> 04:01:26,431
Come on man.

8928
04:01:26,431 --> 04:01:27,264
It's still the,

8929
04:01:28,020 --> 04:01:29,480
the terror of getting an an,

8930
04:01:29,481 --> 04:01:29,581
an,

8931
04:01:29,581 --> 04:01:30,211
an accident.

8932
04:01:30,211 --> 04:01:31,680
Even if you don't think
you're going to die.

8933
04:01:31,740 --> 04:01:34,860
So he jumps through a plaintiff's
through a plaintiff's work.

8934
04:01:35,250 --> 04:01:36,480
Jumping through a plane,

8935
04:01:36,481 --> 04:01:37,440
jumping off a plane,

8936
04:01:37,460 --> 04:01:38,090
sorry.

8937
04:01:38,090 --> 04:01:38,923
Oh,

8938
04:01:39,300 --> 04:01:39,781
hang gliding.

8939
04:01:39,781 --> 04:01:40,614
In sport,

8940
04:01:41,350 --> 04:01:43,160
I think competitions about hang gliding.

8941
04:01:43,161 --> 04:01:44,040
That's your sweet ass.

8942
04:01:44,041 --> 04:01:45,330
That's a physical activity.

8943
04:01:45,420 --> 04:01:45,631
See,

8944
04:01:45,631 --> 04:01:46,441
I think the problem is,

8945
04:01:46,441 --> 04:01:47,340
or the definition,

8946
04:01:47,610 --> 04:01:48,443
the definition is just,

8947
04:01:48,700 --> 04:01:49,533
you know,

8948
04:01:49,590 --> 04:01:50,480
trying to put this in.

8949
04:01:50,490 --> 04:01:51,390
We know what this is.

8950
04:01:51,540 --> 04:01:52,740
This is car racing.

8951
04:01:52,900 --> 04:01:53,733
It's quiet.

8952
04:01:53,810 --> 04:01:58,230
But why does it have to be a
sport or a game or an endeavor?

8953
04:01:58,231 --> 04:01:59,550
This is fucking car racing.

8954
04:01:59,580 --> 04:02:00,500
This is what it is like.

8955
04:02:00,510 --> 04:02:03,090
There's no need to categorize it and
decide whether or not it's a sport,

8956
04:02:04,300 --> 04:02:06,100
but be more joy it for whatever the fuck.

8957
04:02:06,560 --> 04:02:07,393
Hey man,

8958
04:02:08,400 --> 04:02:10,290
it's on Fox sports one bro.

8959
04:02:10,380 --> 04:02:12,180
I mean it's not on fucking CNN.

8960
04:02:12,210 --> 04:02:12,990
Money's involved.

8961
04:02:12,990 --> 04:02:13,680
Money,

8962
04:02:13,680 --> 04:02:14,350
sport,

8963
04:02:14,350 --> 04:02:15,183
professional,

8964
04:02:15,870 --> 04:02:16,930
professional poker.

8965
04:02:16,931 --> 04:02:17,764
A sport.

8966
04:02:17,820 --> 04:02:18,720
It's on ESPN.

8967
04:02:18,750 --> 04:02:19,583
It's poker

8968
04:02:21,010 --> 04:02:22,110
poker on Fox sports one

8969
04:02:23,950 --> 04:02:24,783
yes.

8970
04:02:24,800 --> 04:02:25,290
Okay.

8971
04:02:25,290 --> 04:02:26,041
That gets weird.

8972
04:02:26,041 --> 04:02:26,874
Right,

8973
04:02:27,220 --> 04:02:31,590
and they do it for hours or takes
a lot of focus is on ESPN two okay,

8974
04:02:31,591 --> 04:02:32,281
well then it's chess.

8975
04:02:32,281 --> 04:02:34,950
A sport because chess is
like a more complicated,

8976
04:02:34,951 --> 04:02:35,671
what about go?

8977
04:02:35,671 --> 04:02:37,110
It's more complicated than chess.

8978
04:02:37,610 --> 04:02:38,443
Very good.

8979
04:02:38,990 --> 04:02:39,691
Chess boxing.

8980
04:02:39,691 --> 04:02:40,260
Do you ever see that?

8981
04:02:40,260 --> 04:02:40,351
Oh,

8982
04:02:40,351 --> 04:02:40,891
that's retarded.

8983
04:02:40,891 --> 04:02:41,611
That's ridiculous.

8984
04:02:41,611 --> 04:02:42,180
Don't do that anymore.

8985
04:02:42,180 --> 04:02:42,760
Grass.

8986
04:02:42,760 --> 04:02:43,530
That's tough.

8987
04:02:43,530 --> 04:02:43,930
Yeah,

8988
04:02:43,930 --> 04:02:44,571
let's stop it.

8989
04:02:44,571 --> 04:02:44,910
Let's do it.

8990
04:02:44,910 --> 04:02:47,040
Let's hit him on the hook and
then make them do complex move.

8991
04:02:47,940 --> 04:02:48,773
Stop.

8992
04:02:49,110 --> 04:02:49,943
Don't do that anymore.

8993
04:02:50,130 --> 04:02:50,821
That's a gimmick,

8994
04:02:50,821 --> 04:02:51,654
man.

8995
04:02:53,040 --> 04:02:55,320
These fucking cars are so
God damn capable today.

8996
04:02:55,860 --> 04:02:56,431
It's amazing.

8997
04:02:56,431 --> 04:02:58,650
When you look at cars
just a few decades ago,

8998
04:02:58,800 --> 04:03:00,350
like car engineering,

8999
04:03:00,351 --> 04:03:02,250
he's had an amazing level right now.

9000
04:03:02,760 --> 04:03:04,380
Some sort of a really strange place.

9001
04:03:04,540 --> 04:03:06,880
The point of this kind of at a standstill.

9002
04:03:08,150 --> 04:03:12,390
The what point does it go away when you
have fucking Tesla's driving themselves.

9003
04:03:12,440 --> 04:03:15,390
Then you have [inaudible] wood
oven has a horse race cars.

9004
04:03:16,370 --> 04:03:18,030
He baiting here in round one.

9005
04:03:18,060 --> 04:03:19,180
Not Fuck.

9006
04:03:19,181 --> 04:03:20,014
Are you doing man?

9007
04:03:21,160 --> 04:03:21,993
Standstill.

9008
04:03:23,330 --> 04:03:24,163
The wheels,

9009
04:03:24,250 --> 04:03:25,083
the wheels.

9010
04:03:26,680 --> 04:03:30,700
The frames are the one and we
got two headlights steer away.

9011
04:03:31,020 --> 04:03:31,870
Can we restart it?

9012
04:03:31,930 --> 04:03:33,160
I have to stop it and restart.

9013
04:03:33,520 --> 04:03:33,971
Restart it.

9014
04:03:33,971 --> 04:03:34,601
We're going to keep going.

9015
04:03:34,601 --> 04:03:35,434
I want to stop.

9016
04:03:37,310 --> 04:03:37,571
All right.

9017
04:03:37,571 --> 04:03:38,650
We're going to take a leak folks.

9018
04:03:38,651 --> 04:03:41,740
We run out of our files
killing and be like so long,

9019
04:03:42,130 --> 04:03:43,600
so I don't know what's going on with that.

9020
04:03:43,750 --> 04:03:44,561
This is like some shit.

9021
04:03:44,561 --> 04:03:46,080
They're going to laugh
about one day a second.

9022
04:03:46,090 --> 04:03:46,450
I just got,

9023
04:03:46,450 --> 04:03:47,283
I live at

9024
04:03:50,030 --> 04:03:52,300
to fun and we'll be right back.

9025
04:03:53,770 --> 04:03:54,700
You're really going to take a break.

9026
04:03:55,120 --> 04:03:55,953
Fuck it,

9027
04:03:56,410 --> 04:03:56,651
dude.

9028
04:03:56,651 --> 04:03:57,131
We're rolling.

9029
04:03:57,131 --> 04:03:58,340
It's like one of the greatest podcast.
