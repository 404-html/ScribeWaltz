1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,430
It's too hard for us to wrap our heads
around how big the whole picture is.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:05,821
You know,

4
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:06,690
when you realize that,

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:07,830
you know,

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,341
what does the,

7
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,174
um,

8
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,350
the,

9
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,220
the Woodstock song,

10
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,420
we are stardust.

11
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,350
We are golden.

12
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:14,910
We are billion year old carbon.

13
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,230
Well,

14
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,481
we were,

15
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,231
we really are.

16
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:17,430
Fucking Joni Mitchell.

17
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,323
Yeah.

18
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,951
Joni Mitchell.

19
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:20,910
And who was a Crosby stills.

20
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,590
They covered is eye what it was.

21
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,250
That's her song.

22
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:23,730
Yeah.

23
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,540
Brilliant Song.

24
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,710
And it's so true.

25
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,230
This is the thing that
people do understand human
beings actually made because

26
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:31,380
the star Burns out explodes.

27
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,240
And that has to happen.

28
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,051
If it doesn't happen,

29
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,540
you don't make those
materials and human life,

30
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,860
carbon based life forms don't,

31
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:38,041
don't,

32
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:38,491
don't exist.

33
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:40,080
So even if it doesn't work out,

34
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:40,680
it works out.

35
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,090
Right.

36
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,331
You know,

37
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:43,970
you can understand and are in the
state that we're in and you know,

38
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:44,241
this,

39
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:45,290
this real tactical,

40
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,933
tactical,

41
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,580
tactical,

42
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:48,830
uh,

43
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,700
existence that we live,

44
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:50,000
you know,

45
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,200
you get caught up with the game,

46
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:51,411
you know,

47
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:52,460
you kind of get into the fear.

48
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,890
Yeah.

49
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,000
And,

50
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,270
uh,

51
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,103
and uh,

52
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,010
that's part of it.

53
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,760
Super easy.

54
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,420
So it's okay,

55
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,810
you know,

56
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,051
but,

57
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:57,290
uh,

58
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,760
every now and you get
kind of wrapped up in it.

59
00:00:58,761 --> 00:00:59,140
And,

60
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,810
uh,

61
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,040
I remember like last week,

62
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,550
uh,

63
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,430
the same guide to do Jitsu guy
that I was telling you about Todd,

64
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:05,361
he,

65
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:06,194
uh,

66
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,830
he's,

67
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,730
he just out of the blue,

68
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:08,211
he texted me,

69
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:08,481
he's like,

70
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:08,961
so man,

71
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:09,770
how's it going?

72
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,310
Like,

73
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,450
it's almost like intuition.

74
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:12,440
Like how's it going?

75
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,190
Like funny you should ask because they've
just been a shit storm the whole week.

76
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:16,881
And he goes,

77
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:17,240
Oh,

78
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,320
well let me just give you this.

79
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,520
And he sent me this.

80
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,793
I hope I brought it,

81
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,180
gives them this thing.

82
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,660
I ended up forwarding it to a bunch of
people because I knew a bunch of other

83
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:28,400
people were going through some weird shit.

84
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,283
And uh,

85
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,220
may I,

86
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,053
sure a polluted.

87
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,910
So live your life that the fear of death
can never enter your heart trouble.

88
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:39,260
No one about their religion,

89
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,620
respect others in their view and
demand that they respect yours.

90
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,583
Love your life,

91
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,960
perfect your life,

92
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,060
beautify all things in your life.

93
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,900
Seek to make your life long and its
purpose in the service of your people.

94
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,330
Prepare a noble death song for the day.

95
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:54,830
When you go over to the great divide,

96
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,960
always give a word or a sign of salute
when meeting up or passing a friend,

97
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:00,800
even a stranger,

98
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,270
when an are lonely place,

99
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,360
show respect to all
people and grovel to none.

100
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,760
When you arrived in the morning,

101
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,970
give thanks for the food,

102
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,290
for the joy of living.

103
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,690
If you see no reason for giving thanks.

104
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:13,460
The fault lies only in yourself.

105
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,601
Uh,

106
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:14,961
abused.

107
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:18,380
No one or no thing for abuse
turns the wise ones into fools.

108
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,760
And Rob's a spirit of its division.

109
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,830
When it comes your time to die being out
like those whose hearts are filled with

110
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:27,350
fear and death so that their time comes,

111
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:27,830
they weep.

112
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,680
They pray for more,

113
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,640
a little time and live their lives
again over and over in a different way.

114
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,593
Instead,

115
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,020
sing near death song and
die like a hero going home.

116
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,000
That's fucking beautiful.

117
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,281
So of course,

118
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:41,114
all my friends are like,

119
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,590
you know who wrote that?

120
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,910
So I had to go back to him.

121
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:44,600
I go,

122
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,500
where'd you get that?

123
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,423
He goes,

124
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:46,671
uh,

125
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:47,870
homeless do gave it to me.

126
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,333
Wow.

127
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,010
It's Jesus.

128
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,711
It's like,

129
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:52,640
please don't say it's l,

130
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:53,474
Ron Hubbard.

131
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,240
That would be my luck.

132
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:56,550
Like,

133
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,691
Oh,

134
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:57,560
you know Adolf Hitler.

135
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,850
Well,

136
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,683
it like,

137
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,491
I believe,

138
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,324
I appreciate that.

139
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,750
I actually found it online and it's um,

140
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,340
uh,

141
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,290
chief Tecumseh crouching tiger from the,

142
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:08,531
uh,

143
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,580
from the shiny nation.

144
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,390
Whoa.

145
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,650
He died in 18,

146
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,484
13.

147
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,630
Wow.

148
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,670
Wow.

149
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,450
Yeah.

150
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,730
That makes it even more cool cause I
thought it was some new age douchebag.

151
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,650
Probably do pilfered some stuff off
the internet and pieced it together.

152
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:23,890
No,

153
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,660
that's perfect.

154
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:24,751
Yeah.

155
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:25,584
Wow.

156
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,310
I agree with everything you said.

157
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:27,911
Except for Megan.

158
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:28,744
Front of religion.

159
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,051
You go,

160
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:32,321
girl.

161
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:32,921
Other than that,

162
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,754
he's got me.

163
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,600
I think religion has to be
made fun of because if you,

164
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,060
if you can't make fun of
things that are ridiculous,

165
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:43,670
you're missing out on a big part of
what's fun about this life and religions.

166
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,310
Ridiculous.

167
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,010
Respect it,

168
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,820
but made fun of it,

169
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,620
right?

170
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,040
Yeah.

171
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,440
Yeah.

172
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,011
Other than that,

173
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,551
I'm down.

174
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:49,930
I'm down with the Shawnee warriors.

175
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,143
