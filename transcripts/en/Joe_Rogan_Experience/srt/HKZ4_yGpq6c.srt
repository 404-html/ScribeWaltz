1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,490
Low Freak bitches.
Was he found guilty before it was

2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:07,390
revealed that there was these dirty?
Yes.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,650
Yeah,
they and they didn't and they knew that

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:14,190
this case existed and they didn't allow
like the lawyer Ross,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,080
his defense was trying to postpone the
trial a couple of months so that the

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,100
grand jury investigation,
the criminal charges they knew were

7
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:22,250
going to drop the complaint.
Uh,

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,270
but they were not allowed to postpone
the trial.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,190
Well,
that seems like a slam dunk if you can

10
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:29,400
prove that these cops are using other
people's user names and they were

11
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:33,390
hacking into people's accounts and that,
that seems like right there,

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,420
like you can't.
You can't prove anybody that's a trial.

13
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,100
I would certainly.
I'd like to see that trial.

14
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:41,910
Like my perspective on it is,
is I'm fine with whatever the truth

15
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,880
turns out to be.
I would just love to see both sides have

16
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:48,480
their day and I was at that trial and
the defense did not have a day.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,430
That's always how it is though,
man.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,300
Mean the idea that you get a fair trial
is such a fucking joke because there's

19
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:56,220
so much railroad and going on.
Yeah,

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,810
because especially when there's an
agenda like this to prosecute someone in

21
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:00,540
a,
in a,

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,510
an important case,
a landmark case they think is going to

23
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:06,840
establish a precedent.
They will fuck you.

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,060
Yeah.
That's Kinda how it is.

25
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,680
Yeah.
They will fuck you.

26
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:14,460
And that's what they did to this guy.
Now this dread pirate Roberts character.

27
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:15,600
What's his name?
Dread.

28
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:16,400
Pirate Roberts.
Oh,

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,580
I mean,
the guy was accused of being a God they

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,950
think Russell brick just.
And he's denying that he was dread.

31
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,360
Pirate Roberts.
He's saying,

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,240
here's what we know about him.
We know that he had these like hardcore

33
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,350
libertarian values.
He wasn't a hacker.

34
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,890
He wasn't a computer guy.
I didn't know anything about coding at

35
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:32,590
all.

36
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,160
Um,
he was a physics major,

37
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,850
you know,
he was a,

38
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,090
he'd put himself through to universities
on full scholarship.

39
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:42,750
He had a master's degree in mechanical
engineering from Penn State.

40
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:44,650
Very Bright.
Um,

41
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,830
we know that he had hardcore libertarian
politics.

42
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:49,860
We know that much.
He admitted to creating the Silk Road.

43
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,740
He said he did it to create it like an
economic stimulation where he would

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,300
combine tour and Bitcoin to allow a
marketplace to exist that would be free

45
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:59,730
for everybody to use.
However they wanted to use it.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,900
He claims he said he built it with the
help of a lot of other people was he

47
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:06,420
doesn't really know how to code and he
just let it run.

48
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,900
And he took off and he was done and he
moved on and that's what his family,

49
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:13,800
his mom and dad back him on that.
And that's what his family claims given

50
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,410
being around him because they're a very
tight knit family.

51
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,960
All this time they were like,
this was not someone who was on his

52
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,610
laptop all the time.
I don't know how he could have been

53
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:25,230
running a mill,
a almost a billion dollar drug empire.

54
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,120
Um,
he wasn't that guy.

55
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,040
It wasn't,
the guy just sat on his mama's keyboard

56
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,600
all the time.
Um,

57
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,050
so he claimed he's not dread pirate
Roberts prosecution claimed that he was

58
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:36,990
in and uh,
and that was what that first trial was

59
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,520
about.
What is there proof that he was a,

60
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,840
they did find a journal on his laptop
and the journal on his laptop is like,

61
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,370
you know,
today I'm setting up a dread pirate

62
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,380
Roberts account today.
I'm going to do this today.

63
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:49,620
Fuck.
Does that fuck writes a journal on their

64
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:52,470
laptop of all the shit they're going to
do that today I will take over the

65
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,990
world.
It's kind of how it was.

66
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,860
That seems so silly.
Yeah,

67
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:56,730
I mean it's,
it's,

68
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,160
you know,
it again would love to see like

69
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,630
I went to the trial thinking,
okay,

70
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,250
now we're going to see what happened.
Right.

71
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:07,060
And I would love to see the defense
really have time to sort of talk through

72
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,510
their end and have expert witnesses and
get into the nitty gritty of it because

73
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:12,940
I mean I would say we were the wherever
the truth lies,

74
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:14,800
but,
but to be in the courtroom and to hear

75
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,030
all that and just think,
okay,

76
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,820
if this is true,
this is like the most naive,

77
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,300
you know,
criminal mastermind and the history of.

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,320
Could you imagine breaking would have
lasted like wouldn't have lasted half a

79
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,840
season if they had Walter White light,
you know.

80
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,900
So today I will plant a bomb in the
courthouse today.

81
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:35,440
I'm going to blow up that bomb.
This don't tell anyone for law

82
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:36,520
enforcement,
you know?

83
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,710
Yeah.
It's not like he knows a lot about

84
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,800
computers and computer could be hacked
into or anything.

85
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,450
Yeah.
That's so stupid.

86
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,990
So our t just really liked the videos
that I was doing and asked me to come

87
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:50,170
there for an interview and um,
I just said there's no way I want to

88
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,940
move to DC.
That sounds horrible,

89
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,550
but I just couldn't.
I couldn't pass up the opportunity and

90
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,820
they said that they wanted me to have a
show and just do exactly what I was

91
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:02,710
doing and just rant and,
and have an international platform to

92
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,050
do.
So the,

93
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,060
the only hesitation that I had,
I mean I talked to someone who initially

94
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,620
interviewed me for our tea and I asked
her,

95
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,220
why do you work here?
Like why is Russia today covering things

96
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,080
that activists care about?
Like what is,

97
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,910
what is going on here?
And she was like,

98
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:17,020
look,
if I have to work for the Russian

99
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,510
government to tell the truth about
what's happening in my country,

100
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,530
that's what I'm going to do because we
have to get the information out there.

101
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,110
At that time,
the Cold War,

102
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,170
Russia was not in the news like
militarily or like this crazy Cold War,

103
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,660
renaissance and resurrection in terms of
like propaganda wars.

104
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:37,210
So at that time I was like,
that's great.

105
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,030
And I mean,
the editorial freedom that it gives is

106
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:43,320
completely unmatched.
And of course people are gonna love you.

107
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,520
That,
that gross generalization that

108
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,150
everything on the networks propaganda.
The problem is everything's propaganda.

109
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,290
Every fucking thing is propaganda.
Tell me one media source that is not

110
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,370
used in some way to push a viewpoint or
a bias.

111
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,030
Everyone has bias.
There is no such thing as neutrality.

112
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,710
You know,
everyone comes with an opinion.

113
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,350
Everyone that comes with a bias,
and I'd rather know the bias,

114
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,530
which is Russia today.
You may not get the truth about Russia

115
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:11,140
from going to Russia and watching Russia
today,

116
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,200
but you will get the fucking truth about
the U.

117
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:16,540
s government and you will get the truth
about corporations because it's state

118
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,850
funded so you can talk about those
things without worrying about

119
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,500
advertisers and sponsorship.

120
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,260
So I always tell people navigate around
the bias.

121
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,870
No,
I'm not going to tell people that there

122
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:27,700
is no bias.
That's fucking stupid.

123
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,530
Of course there is.
It's Russia today.

124
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:32,890
It's fun about the Russian government,
so there's a lot of factors that go into

125
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,480
that,
but I'd much rather know that bias

126
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:38,080
blatantly in front of my face then not
know the tens of thousands of special

127
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:41,500
interest and conflicts of interest going
into the entire corporate media

128
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:44,860
apparatus and all these other agencies.
I mean,

129
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:48,790
and that's even scarier because you have
people on those channels that had been

130
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,790
fired for criticizing the U.
s government and it's not even state

131
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,980
funded media.
It just corporate media.

132
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,990
How long his uncle Paul been around for?
Well,

133
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:58,190
he started.
Uncle Paul started is I've

134
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,640
been doing character for years and
relationships long before I did.

135
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:03,730
I'm on the radio.
I didn't coin my girlfriends and maybe

136
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,450
he was uncle Larry many years ago.
There was Roger Davis or Roger d and

137
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,360
this is long before chip,
there was Roger and Roger had a brother

138
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:14,690
Lester who was burned in a fire and it
was,

139
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,980
you got a whole time,
like all storyline.

140
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,720
Lester was burned everywhere,
but his knees and his,

141
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,140
he would always wear knickers to show
off.

142
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:24,230
His legs was a whole thing and uncle
Roger and uncle,

143
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:26,810
uh,
uncle Larry and then it merged into chip

144
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,840
who my girlfriend hated so much.
Chip became the fucking because they

145
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:35,720
would chip would embarrass people.
I did had literally before I ever

146
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:38,510
thought I'd do on the radio,
I would be out with girlfriends and

147
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:41,540
embarrass them by doing that.
Like I'll just be making bad jokes in

148
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,410
the cab and my girlfriend jen and even
grow up and go home and just go,

149
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:50,411
just shut the fuck up.
It's not funny and it made me so happy.

150
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,830
And what?
This is what Dr Jen crazy.

151
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,210
He'd be like a really nice steakhouse
and the waiter would come over and she

152
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:04,340
would order like the salmon and then
chip just goes.

153
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,430
How much is that?
And would ask the way there.

154
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:09,650
And she was like,
do you know how humiliating it is that

155
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:13,850
people think I fucked that guy?
People think I'm fucking this guy.

156
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,490
And that's where they come from.
That visceral reaction.

157
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,590
It was real,
like I was who doing one night that she

158
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,490
all I would do,
I would do it,

159
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:25,950
you know,
I,

160
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,050
Edgar's one,
I don't do as much because it's bigger.

161
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,460
Edgar's the one with the tiny mouth he
drew

162
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,070
and that's his thing.
But he had a brother Eugene and Eugene

163
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,860
was always telling her that like,
you know,

164
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,860
you need to get right with the Lord.
And he would always tell her she was

165
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,240
garbage and a whore.
You tell my girlfriend she was all for

166
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,660
and she was not worthy crying.
I'm crying.

167
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:51,231
But I,
I.

168
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:52,970
What happened was my girlfriend at the
time,

169
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:55,310
who's now my best friend,
she might extra offer from years ago.

170
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,760
She hated Eugene so much.
And I mean,

171
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,940
it wasn't even funny anymore.
Could we would do it and she would dig

172
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:06,080
her fingernails into my face.
She dug her nails into my face because I

173
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:09,320
think eugene hit a spot.
It's real.

174
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,670
And um,
it was,

175
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,090
it was such a visceral reaction from her
that I stopped doing eugene because she

176
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:20,300
caught me dirty texting with another
girl.

177
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,090
She fucking,
I told you I wasn't even to go.

178
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:24,200
I have a fuck.
It was just a girl.

179
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,600
I told you my dirty intriguing.
It was a girl.

180
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:28,050
I was like,
I'll pay you 500 baby.

181
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,320
So I fucking,
I'm such an addict.

182
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:32,410
I would save my conversations to jerk
off to,

183
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,450
and I hit the wrong button by button and
I fucking printed it.

184
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,120
Dude,
I fucking printed it.

185
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,570
So she wakes me up one morning she goes,
Jim,

186
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,120
wake up.
And I knew I was in trouble.

187
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,090
So she found these things and she knew I
hadn't fucked the girl,

188
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:48,890
but it was a real strain on the
relationship.

189
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,700
So as I swear to you as,
as one of the ways of making amends to

190
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,860
her,
I stopped doing eugene.

191
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,350
I killed off Eugene Mellencamp because
she,

192
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,230
because I do a baby boy character in
jelly who she liked,

193
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,600
who's jelly.
I don't do jelly publish to embarrass

194
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:05,460
these.
Just a little boy.

195
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,350
But she thought he was really cute and
uncle Paul would always molest jelly and

196
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,800
fucking and chip was so stupid.
Chipotle is dropped jelly off and uncle

197
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,470
Paul's house and he didn't know it was a
whole fucking inner world.

198
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,840
So yeah,
chip would be like,

199
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,150
well Ivanka,
Paul's a good guy.

200
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,790
He's helping out and she is.
So she would drive her crazy.
