Yummy naturebox.
I'm sitting here in honor of our guests 

33
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:49,460
care,
Santa Maria,

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,970
who's from Texas.
I'm eating the Lonestar Snack,

35
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:55,971
Mitch mix mix in that yummy stuff.
Mostly violence.

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,160
A lot of America.
It seems like it's mostly nuts.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,350
Do you want me though?
I'm naturebox.

38

Gives you a ton of delicious choices.
Uh,

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,990
hundreds of different choices.
Really yummy stuff.

40
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,070
Peanut butter,
nom noms.

41
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:13,200
If you had those yet.
Pretty God damn good.

42
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,070
Dark cocoa almonds.
We have those baked sweet potato fries.

43
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,900
I had those.
Good,

44
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,870
Yummy,
Yummy,

45
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,180
yummy.
I haven't found any SRIRACHA cashews.

46
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,150
I don't know what the fuck is going on.
There might be some sort of a shortage.

47
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,090
I talked too much about the cashews.
Seriously did.

48
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,790
They were like gone off the website for 
a bit.

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,310
They are that good.
They are that good.

50
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,340
Naturebox is pretty fucking bad ass.
It's an excellent way to get healthy 

51
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,260
snacks delivered to your home and if you
have like specific requirements,

52
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:43,980
like if you want snacks that are low on 
sugar or non Gmo without gluten,

53
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,120
they have all that stuff.

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,600
They have all their snacks have zero 
trans fats,

55
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,780
zero high fructose corn syrup.
So they're very delicious and you don't 

56
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,380
have to feel guilty about them,
especially if you choose correctly.

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,860
Big Apple Pineapple or big island rather
big apple pineapple,

58
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:01,190
like growing pineapples in New York.
The fuck is wrong.

59
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,230
That's what happens when you fly.
And then you try to talk.

60
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,020
Your brain is like,
what'd you do to be stupid?

61
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,680
But Big island pineapple,
really delicious and simple simple 

62
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,200
stuff.
The um,

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,490
those,
uh,

64
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,250
blueberry almonds too.
I can go on and on and on.

65
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,280

77
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,450
Last but not least,
we're brought to you by [inaudible] dot 

78
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,321
com.
That is o n n I t on it is a human 

79
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:10,321
optimization website and what we sell 
primarily is things that we find that 

80
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,920
well,
mostly things that I use,

81
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,040
things that we find that benefit you,
whether it's strength and conditioning 

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,110
equipment like our kettlebell series,
the Zombie Bells and the primal bells,

83
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:25,111
which are these artistically created 
kettlebells that are all three d 

84
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:25,630
balanced and maps,
so even though they look cool,

85
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,060
they function just like a regular 
Kettlebell.

86
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,640
If you've never used any athletic 
equipment,

87
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:35,641
I said this ad Nauseum,
but I have to have to repeat it because 

88
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:37,180
I don't want anybody to get hurt.
Please start slowly.

89
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,670
You do not have to kill yourself the 
first day.

90
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,090
If you're one of those people that 
hasn't worked out for years and you're 

91
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:45,090
like,
digit,

92
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,520
I'm going to work out like a fucking 
monster from now on and the first day 

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:47,520
you work out really hard and you hurt 
yourself.

94
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,690
We'll that's not good,
right?

95
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,570
That's not good.
Which you want to do is start slowly and

96
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,020
just write things down.
There's a lot of people in this world 

97
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,800
could benefit from writing down things 
that you want to accomplish.

98
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,500
Write down a routine,
a simple routine.

99
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,110
Real simple.
Today I'm going to do 20 pushups,

100
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,540
20 sit ups,
and I'm going to run a mile.

101
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,260
You can do that.

102
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,410
It won't take that long.
It'll probably take like an hour to get 

103
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:13,490
everything done.
Maybe what's,

104
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,120
what's a strong mile,
seven minutes.

105
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,410
You're not going to run seven minute 
miles.

106
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,300
We'd never run before.
He probably been run 10 minutes,

107
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,680
so that's,
you know,

108
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,220
it's enough time.
Just get a little exercise in folks,

109
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,080
do a little something.
Get your blood pumping.

110
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:31,081
It's fucking good for you.
We also sell healthy foods and 

111
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,910
supplements like the new warrior bar 
that we started selling it on it,

112
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,500
which is a all natural buffalo bar,
14 grams of protein,

113
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,840
no antibiotics,
no added hormones,

114
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,540
gluten free,
very yummy.

115
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:47,060
And it's done with this old lakota 
recipe that um,

116
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,090
the,
they use cranberries and it's actually 

117
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,050
quite delicious.
And like I said,

118
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,480
140 calories,
four grams of fat,

119
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,070
and it's a two ounce serving with 14 
grams

120
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,750
of protein.
Excellent for you.

121
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,080
All this stuff at on it we sell is all 
stuff that either myself or Aubrey uses 

122
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:09,530
and we find the very best things as far 
as like protein supplements,

123
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,480
as far as you know,
any,

124
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:16,481
any of the items that we sell,
we just try to find you the best shit 

125
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:16,481

Brian likes to fuck around with new 

132
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:38,990
operating system.
He may have loaded some new operating.

133
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:43,991
Says to Mondo was fucking fucked up.
Why don't you just sing it as a ticket 

134
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,530
out?
You had it working on it.

135

What happened?
He doesn't even know the music.

136

This is Lulu.
Lulu is operating systems.

137
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:54,800
Not.

What's this one called?

139
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,350
It's called Yosemite.
I thought they were like cats and shit.

140
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,000
This is so good.

151
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,650
but like on your facebook,
which one is your actual.

152
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,190
Are these all just people trying to.
Mostly they're not me.

153
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,270
Yeah,
there's like 100 fake music.

154
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,500
If someone's tagging fake job,
someone sending you some Dick Pics,

155
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,530
I guarantee you that's not me.
I guarantee you even it looks exactly 

156
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,420
like my Dick.
That's not me right now.

157
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,270
I have the sweet talk nerdy tee shirt on
right now which represents Kara Santa 

158
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:04,450
Maria's.

159
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,410
Awesome podcast.
How many episodes do you have now?

160
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,600
I just put up episode 26.
Jesus.

161
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,010
Louisa,
can you believe that?

162
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,420
Number one,
you were number one and I do it weekly 

163
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,790
and you,
you inspired me.

164
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,010
You and your listeners inspired me to do
this.

165
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,310
Well,
you're,

166
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,650
you're born for this.
This is a perfect venue for you.

167
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,750
I'm telling you.
Thank you.

168
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,790
By the way,
but I'm telling you when I left your 

169
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,460
studio the last time I was on,
I probably got 300 tweets from people 

170
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:32,540
saying,
start your podcast.

171
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,790
It's awesome.
It was great.

172
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,080
It was so great.
That's so cool.

173
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:38,060
You already have 26 of them.
That's incredible.

174
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,680
How did you do that?
So fast?

175
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,140
He just do them weekly and it's been 
that long.

176
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,260
It's been 26 weeks,
so it's been six months essentially in 

177
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,520
March or April.
That's awesome though.

178
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,660
That's so cool that you did it.
You,

179
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,660
you need something like this because you
know,

180
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:56,490
whenever you deal with a lot of 
producers

181
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,810
or you know,
network folk think they mean well,

182
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,050
but they all,
everyone has their own idea of what 

183
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,040
should happen and even if they're nice 
people it gets in the way.

184
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,630
It's so true.
And like I,

185
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:14,631
you know right now I contribute to,
to different television shows and I'm 

186
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:17,370
very lucky I'm a freelancer.
I'm a contributor so I work on a show on

187
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:22,371
Al Jazeera America called Techno,
which is a great science kind of news 

188
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:25,631
magazine style show.
And then I work on a local show here in 

189
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:25,631
la called soquel connected,
which is on Kct,

190
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,830
which used to be our pbs affiliate and 
now it's just a,

191
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,120
um,
a public television kind of standalone.

192
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,480
And that's great.
I have great producers.

193
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:35,730
I get to self produce some stuff.
It's wonderful.

194
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,300
Prior to only doing those and the 
podcast,

195
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,320
I was full time on a show called take 
power,

196
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,750
live on pivot TV.

197
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,130
That was daily eight to 12 hours a day 
every day,

198
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,190
you know,
hair and makeup for two hours straight.

199
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,870
Basically two hours.
Yeah.

200
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,010
Was trying to turn you into a werewolf 
saying absolutely didn't look like he 

201
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,920
wasn't allowed to wear my hair straight,
wasn't allowed to wear black,

202
00:09:58,921 --> 00:09:59,970
wasn't a law.
It was crazy.

203
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:02,190
Like I couldn't have rules.
Very strict.

204
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:07,191
I could not be myself on that show.
And I look back and that is really when 

205
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,420
the podcast started because I was so,
like you said,

206
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,750
kind of boxed into speaking only in 
sound bites and presenting a version of 

207
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,491
myself that honestly I was not 
comfortable really presenting the 

208
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:22,650
podcast was a really,
really necessary outlet.

209
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Like it was so psychologically freeing 
for me and now I think it really helps 

210
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:32,781
keep me centered and anchored when I do 
new jobs and new work to really 

211
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:34,770
understand how not to let things get out
of him like that.

212
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,480
The best representative of yourself is 
yourself.

213
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,820
You got a bunch of people like deciding 
what you should do.

214
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:45,690
I think it'd be great if you wore pink.
Oh look what you should be in paint that

215
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:47,930
legitimate like I did.
They made me wear pain.

216
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,270
Like it was crazy and I had to wear my 
hair out curly.

217
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:54,570
I read it and they hated that and I 
don't know,

218
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,320
man.
I think it's because I was the only girl

219
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:03,321
on the show at the time.
It was like very male heavy and I was 

220
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:04,110
supposed to be like the representative 
of the female species,

221
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,670
which was like,
come on.

222
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,190
I'm kind of a tomboy.
Like it wasn't really working for me.

223
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,640
It was a lot of short skirts too.
Which is weird for me.

224
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,850
Like I like to wear black leather,
but yeah.

225
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,180
Anyway,
and we've talked about it many times in 

226
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,210
the podcast about how you watch Fox News
and all those women who like,

227
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,220
it's almost like they have it in their 
contract that they have to uncross and 

228
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,771
crossed her legs like a certain amount 
of times per minute because it's like 

229
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:33,980
who the fuck is that uncomfortable that 
you're shifting and switching your legs 

230
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,520
back and forth and if a man dressed like
that,

231
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,380
it would be so insane.

232
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,410
Oh,
can you imagine saying because there 

233
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:42,410
are,
you know,

234
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,830
if you watch runway shows ever,
you keep up with fashion at all.

235
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:48,090
There are kind of male versions of that 
sort of ensemble,

236
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,430
but nobody actually.
Where's that in real life.

237
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:54,010
Like the short kind of tight,
maybe not up to

238
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,380
your nut sack,
but like halfway down your thigh,

239
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,560
these little like plaid shorts and then 
he will,

240
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,430
you know,
it's very runway,

241
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,300
but even those are shorts.
There's something crazy about a skirt.

242
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,050
Yeah,
I agree.

243
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:09,340
I mean it's just like easy access.
It's the most ridiculous invention.

244
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,870
It's like your vagina,
which is your coveted sexual organ.

245
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,980
I mean,
this is like,

246
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,190
this is where the babies come out,
this is where you let the loved ones in 

247
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,750
this so much to the vagina and yet it's 
there protected by the thinnest piece of

248
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:25,510
fabric.
If,

249
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,650
if we've seen all these little teeny 
bopper celebrities and their little 

250
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,780
woopsies getting in and out of cars 
oopsies where there just happened to be 

251
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,740
cameras right down near the vagina is 
like,

252
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:38,280
that's not a website.
Such shit was engineered.

253
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,960
What's the reasoning behind that?
I should have a cooter.

254
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,120
Why would you want to do that?
Some people want to look at it.

255
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,310
I don't want that to be Clark Clark with
me.

256
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,340
I'll never forget what he said about 
vaginas because he's of a different 

257
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,490
persuasion.
He goes firsthand saw vagina.

258
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:55,290
I was like,
when's it going to heal?

259
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,520
But it is a weird thing.
I mean that you're presented as a 

260
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,360
serious journalist on Fox News or as a 
neuroscientist,

261
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:12,361
which is what you are,
and yet they want you to have your 

262
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:15,130
vagina basically just barely protected 
by a little,

263
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,420
a little napkin that they throw over it.
No,

264
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,260
thank you.
And always the cameras are,

265
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,770
you know,
right at the midlines,

266
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,050
the midline of the table and so it's,
it's just like an unflattering or,

267
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,120
or ultra flattering depending on how you
look at an angle that just makes you 

268
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,660
feel really exposed.
It's.

269
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,020
Yeah.
How are you supposed to take somebody 

270
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,020
seriously?
That it's.

271
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,210
It doesn't make you any hotter.

272
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,920
That's where people are confused.
Yeah.

273
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,040
You don't have to.
I think it's a little better sometimes 

274
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,130
to leave things up to the imagination.
Yeah.

275
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:46,150
Well,
I mean,

276
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:50,890
no it's not,
but I'm saying like maybe not on tv,

277
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:53,470
on the news news.
What's your.

278
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:54,610
Yeah.
What's your objective?

279
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:56,800
I mean,
is it better in real life?

280
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,500
Well,
no.

281
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,370
Well I don't know.
Depends on what you're trying to do,

282
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:03,580
but if you're on a show where you're 
just trying to like talk about issues,

283
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,730
it's distracting.
It's distracting to have like this 

284
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,791
really sexy outfit on and I think that's
half the reason why these fucking Fox 

285
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:16,470
News type shows do that.
Barbara Walters never dressed like that 

286
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,470
can be corrected,
but she,

287
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,580
you know,
not too too scandalous.

288
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,830
But she did wear short skirts and I was 
actually just watching,

289
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,150
so I'm gonna get a little more 
comfortable.

290
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,850
I'm very short and I feel tiny in this 
chair.

291
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,090
Um,
so I'm just crossing my legs.

292
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,340
So I was watching this documentary 
called misrepresentation.

293
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:38,341
Have you seen this?
I'm about to get like super feminist on 

294
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:39,550
the show really early,
just so I can piss off like everybody on

295
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:40,590
twitter.
Um,

296
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,140
so actually really good documentary.
It's called misrepresentation.

297
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,270
You can find it on Netflix and it was 
produced and I'm kind of narrated by 

298
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,710
Jennifer Siebel newsome,
who Gavin newsome's wife and

299
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,240
the whole thing is kind of about media 
representations of women,

300
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:59,210
how women are portrayed,
how women,

301
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,570
you know,
make up x amount of the population,

302
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:07,571
x amount of the jobs in this field and 
this field and this field and then how 

303
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:10,451
they're represented both in fictional 
television but also in nonfiction 

304
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,960
programming.
And they talk a little bit about that,

305
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:15,800
kind of why our female news readers 
meant to look.

306
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:20,801
So I'm sexy.
It's always kind of like the crusty old 

307
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,510
dude.
And then like his hot and nice,

308
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,110
like that's what it looks like when you 
look it up,

309
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,470
a news reading team,
um,

310
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,500
and,
and they have these great interviews 

311
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,751
with people like Lisa Ling and Katie 
couric and kind of talking about Katie 

312
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:39,580
actually is very open and says I kind of
feel guilty like almost I played into 

313
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,300
this like maybe I set this trend in 
motion and um,

314
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,310
you know,
I was fit.

315
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,320
I wore,
you know,

316
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,840
not ridiculously short skirts,
but you could see my legs on TV.

317
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:52,841
And then it seems like that's now the 
formula that every news reader has to 

318
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:53,570
have.
And you almost just assumed that they're

319
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:55,110
dumb.
Like it,

320
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,570
it,
it portrays.

321
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,240
I,
I don't think it portrays strength.

322
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,380
Unfortunately.
When you have these girls that are women

323
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,050
that look like they're trying so hard to
be sexy,

324
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,870
then all of a sudden it puts it in your 
head like,

325
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:13,871
oh,
she's just reading a script that 

326
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:13,871
somebody else wrote for her.
When sometimes these are really,

327
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:15,770
really bright,
really successful women.

328
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Like why do you want?
Or just they just want people to watch 

329
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,420
it and they just feel like the best way 
to hook people is sex.

330
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,280
Yeah.
And,

331
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:26,600
and the truth is they also,
in the documentary,

332
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:29,240
they showed all of the major news 
corporation,

333
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,710
which there aren't that many anymore,
you know,

334
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:33,710
they've been kind of conglomerating and,
and uh,

335
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,100
more and more of the property is owned 
by less and less people and they showed 

336
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,821
the number of women on the board,
on the board of all of these different 

337
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:42,821
news organizations.

338
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:47,380
And so you look at like Time Warner or 
you look at Viacom and it's like one 

339
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,660
woman,
two women,

340
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,810
you know,
to women and as opposed to like 30 men 

341
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:56,750
are 15 men.
The people that are making the shows and

342
00:16:56,751 --> 00:17:01,751
the people who have ultimate control 
over those kinds of decisions 

343
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:03,200
historically and to this day are like 99
percent male.

344
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,780
I wonder if that's why I like women like
Megan Kelly,

345
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:09,500
that Fox lady who's not at all,
she's very sharp.

346
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,860
She's kind of mean,
kind of got an edge to her wonder if 

347
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,860
it's like to like let you know,
hey fuck face.

348
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,680
Just because I've got my tits hanging 
out in my legs are crisscrossed,

349
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
barely covered my cooter.
I'll still put you in your place where 

350
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,720
she's on her heels all the time.
I'd always backed up.

351
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,870
Yeah.
I don't think it's an uncommon feeling 

352
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,440
for women who are just in a position 
where they're surrounded by men who just

353
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,450
are going to assume when they walk in 
the door that she's just dumb bimbos 

354
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:37,580
she's a weather girl.
She's a news reader,

355
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:42,581
but really she's writing her own copy 
and doing her own research and it a 

356
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:42,581
really strong smart.
I mean,

357
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:44,990
I disagree with like fucking everything 
she says,

358
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,310
but I've seen her be a total brilliant 
on air before.

359
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,210
She's slightly more rational than most 
of the people in that network.

360
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,370
That's not saying much because she can 
be pretty rational,

361
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:56,950
but she,
you know,

362
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,540
she's right wing.
That's just,

363
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,390
that's her thing.
She's like a real Santa Claus is white.

364
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,400
Is that her kapow she's hot as fuck.
That's very distracting,

365
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,750
right?
It is.

366
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:12,070
But it's also usually looks like that 
on.

367
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,080
That's what you should do.
Just fucking work it all the way deep.

368
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,140
Ridiculous.
She should do the news from a bed all 

369
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,210
day.
All the news should be done from silk 

370
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:23,210
sheets.
She's got her tits highlighted.

371
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:23,210
Yeah,
she does.

372
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,120
They're different colored.
Yeah.

373
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:25,020
That's an interesting.
I mean,

374
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,200
come on,
wardrobe,

375
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:31,210
dry.
She basically has a two tone thing with 

376
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,400
the tits or impossible to not look at 
because they don't blend in at all.

377
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,350
And that's the thing.
It's like they really push you.

378
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,330
I remember on um,
take part live one day wearing one of my

379
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,580
favorite looks,
which was like black pants,

380
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:46,581
high heels,
a white button down shirt that was 

381
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:46,581
fitted.
I mean I think that the outfit was,

382
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:49,230
I consider it like a hot outfit and a 
black tie and,

383
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,250
but I had my hair braided and kind of 
pulled back and I was wearing glasses 

384
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,740
and my producer told me that I couldn't 
dress like that anymore because it was 

385
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,330
too masculine.
Look like a girl.

386
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,220
Like it's obvious that I'm not trying to
be a dude.

387
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:04,000
I like to wear ties.
Producer guy.

388
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:04,920
No,
no.

389
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,900
You don't have to say no,
he wasn't.

390
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:07,610
It wasn't.
No.

391
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,060
Maybe he really was.
No,

392
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:12,660
he wasn't for sure he wasn't where he 
thought you look masculine like that.

393
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,790
No,
I mean,

394
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,791
I dunno.
It's like put on a short skirt and and 

395
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:18,791
you get that thing to where even if they
don't overtly tell you,

396
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:23,751
it's like you get off air every night 
and when you're dressed in an outfit 

397
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:24,900
that you love,
like pants a shirt,

398
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:29,901
like you feel comfortable but you feel 
good about yourself and you look in the 

399
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:29,901
mirror and you think your body looks 
good.

400
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:30,510
It's like whatever.
Okay,

401
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:35,511
fine.
Show whatever you were like the dumbest 

402
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:37,971
little short pink skirt or dress that 
you're totally uncomfortable in and 

403
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:41,631
you're not acting like yourself.
You look great to know like in your ifb,

404
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,790
like in your,
in your ears,

405
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,760
because they're constantly,
they're like in your ear,

406
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:52,350
like that's gross to the ifps are gross.
I know it's horrible having someone talk

407
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:57,351
to you,
especially if you're in the middle of a 

408
00:19:57,351 --> 00:19:59,510
conversation and they're difficult that 
or don't say this or bringing this back 

409
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,140
and bring up that are asked this.
It's tough.

410
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,350
It's tough.
Especially when there's tension between 

411
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:06,870
you and your producer when not hiding 
it.

412
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,500
When I do post fight interviews,
when I first started doing it,

413
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,200
they used to talk to me in my ear like 
way back in the day,

414
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:18,201
like sometimes it'd be in midsentence 
and there'd be some fucking clueless 

415
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:18,201
shithead on the other end.

416
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:22,860
You know,
it hasn't happened in decades because 

417
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:22,860
then the new guys are awesome.
The guys that have been doing it for,

418
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,660
but in the nineties when I did it,
there would be a guy talking.

419
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,450
I literally had to take the thing out of
my ear because I couldn't concentrate on

420
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:32,451
what I was saying and they have a 
meltdown in the booth when they see you 

421
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:32,451
take it out of your year.
I don't know what it's like.

422
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,260
You can't.
You literally can't form a sentence.

423
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,180
First of all,
when you're doing post fight interviews,

424
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:38,820
you're doing it in real time off the 
cuff,

425
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,850
completely ad libbed and you're.
You're asking questions and adjusting 

426
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,081
based on how the fighter talks to you.
They don't understand like even a good 

427
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:48,310
producer will be like,
well,

428
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:49,810
I never talked to you while you're 
talking.

429
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:51,280
I wait until you stop talking.
It's like,

430
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:56,281
yeah,
but I have to fucking hear with the 

431
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:56,281
person I'm interviewing says to me,
you literally can't hear you.

432
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,010
Someone to talk to you here and you're 
talking.

433
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,840
I don't hear it.
No,

434
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:03,841
you can't hear it all and it's,
it's the same thing that show I was on 

435
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,560
was a live show every night,
so I get it counting down to commercial.

436
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,870
The things where you have to keep time.
Hey guys,

437
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:09,940
we gotta wrap it up.
We've only got a minute left.

438
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,030
Great.
But like just the talking and the 

439
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,370
talking or you should say this.
It's like fuck you.

440
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:17,620
I'm not going to say that to say what I 
want to say.

441
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,180
Well that's the beautiful thing about 
the Internet.

442
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:24,210
You know,
the beautiful thing about the internet 

443
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:24,700
and producing your own show and creating
your own show is I kind of look at those

444
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:29,701
old shows,
the shows that have been around for a 

445
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:31,471
long time like that.
Especially those news type shows we 

446
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:32,650
talked about like the the uncle and the 
niece and the like,

447
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,430
that kind of weird format where they 
talk fake and it's everything.

448
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,580
Seven minutes cut to commercial.
I feel like that's a dinosaur.

449
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:44,581
I really don't think that's gonna.
I mean I don't think it's going to last 

450
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:45,910
for people,
sort of our generation.

451
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,940
I use that loosely,
but I think most of middle America is 

452
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,761
still watching that kind of traditional 
television in America gets the Internet 

453
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:53,761
two.
They do.

454
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:54,220
That's true.
That's true.

455
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:57,670
America is not middle America anymore.
I think most of middle America,

456
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I mean they're.
They're watching what's on because it's 

457
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,820
always been there,
but people are way more hip.

458
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,690
Yeah,
they are.

459
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,760
But tell him when you go on the road,
don't you feel it,

460
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:11,761
Brian,
when you go to Ohio and all these 

461
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:12,430
different places like that used to be 
like a little behind.

462
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:17,431
They're not really behind anymore and 
there's a lot of fucking slick people 

463
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:17,431
that are living in the middle of 
nowhere.

464
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:17,890
Yeah,
absolutely.

465
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,150
I think that's what's great about 
everything.

466
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:24,150
I mean,
I just got rid of cable from my first 

467
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,101
time in for once.
I'm like choosing what I want to watch 

468
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:26,101
instead of just like,
oh,

469
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:27,760
what's on TV right now?
So you're kind of directing,

470
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,400
but what are these Middle America people
picking out?

471
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:32,860
Stupid Shit.
Like I wanna watch this.

472
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,770
Slowly but surely though they're getting
more hip.

473
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,670
No,
I think so too.

474
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:38,170
I think part of the problem though is 
that,

475
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:43,171
I mean you look at the statistics and 
Fox News is still the most watched news 

476
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:48,331
network.
Like what does that say about our 

477
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:48,331
country?
What says?

478
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:51,751
First of all,
they don't really know what the fuck 

479
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:51,751
people are watching because the Nielsen 
ratings are ridiculous.

480
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:53,260
That's true.
It's the most antiquated way of figuring

481
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:58,261
out.
It's the only thing that's worse is the 

482
00:22:58,261 --> 00:23:00,380
arbitron.
When they try to figure out who's 

483
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,380
listening to radio,
that Shit's ridiculous.

484
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,690
I could give you a book and you're 
supposed to carry it around and write 

485
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:04,710
down.
When you listened to this channel,

486
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,670
when you listen to that channel like 
they don't fucking know.

487
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,220
What ends up happening is that people 
represent themselves to be different 

488
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,220
than they are.
They're like,

489
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,991
I love NPR when they like never listened
to npr because they think it looks good 

490
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:20,031
as well.
There's that thing that they do on 

491
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,730
networks as well where they'll.
They'll like,

492
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,070
if you're on a talk show,
especially the.

493
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,130
They have the ratings based on how many 
people are watching up into a certain 

494
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,691
point.
Like that's why the tonight show has a 

495
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,521
20 minute break because 15 minutes in is
when they do their first rating so they 

496
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:40,231
don't want to cut to commercial because 
then you'll change the channel fuck up 

497
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:43,171
the ratings.
So they have this 20 minute things so 

498
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:43,171
everything is geared towards like keep 
watching us,

499
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:43,450
look at us.

500
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,450
We're going to do something crazy and 
they just.

501
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,350
It's like sweeps every night duties,
do anything to try to get you to hang in

502
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:56,351
there for 20 minutes and then they'll 
bring someone on and that's what the 

503
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,711
skirts are all about and that's why you 
have all these people that their 

504
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:02,660
sensibility is not based on what's the 
best way to get caris thoughts out.

505
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:05,090
What's the best way to get megan's 
thoughts out?

506
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,270
The thing is,
how do I get someone to watch this 

507
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:10,270
chick?
Oh,

508
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,760
completely.
And also there is a problem I think 

509
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:12,760
where people say,
okay,

510
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,811
well people in the industry,
especially when you talk to them about 

511
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:16,811
this,
they go,

512
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:16,811
well,
whatever.

513
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:18,740
We just give people what they want.
So you look at like bad reality tv where

514
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:22,130
there's cat fights and humiliation 
television and all the shit that,

515
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,060
you know,
the Kardashians,

516
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:28,061
all the shit that we're like a breaks my
heart that this is so popular in 

517
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:28,061
America.

518
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:31,960
And then people say,
well that's what the people want and 

519
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:31,960
we're just answering to what their needs
are.

520
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,430
You know,
we're not actually effecting any sort of

521
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,990
social change.
We're just playing into the hands of,

522
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,540
of,
of what they're interested in.

523
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,750
But I say that that's fucking bullshit 
because we have an illusion of choice in

524
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:47,960
this country.
Like we don't have viable options.

525
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:51,140
If I want to watch the news,
I've either got Fox News,

526
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,470
MSNBC or CNN.
Those are the things that are easy for 

527
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,540
me to find.
I probably,

528
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,600
unless I haven't expanded cable package,
don't have al Jazeera or BBC World News 

529
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,490
or another option or rt or another 
option available to me.

530
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,870
So I'm watching this programming that's 
no longer even news.

531
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:13,871
It's just fucking advertiser blow jobs 
and like ratings run offs.

532
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,200
You know,
our team,

533
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,210
an interesting example is kind of a 
fucked up channel that rt is very like 

534
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,480
in the one hand there's amazing 
reporting happening there and in the 

535
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,110
other hand it's like answers to the 
Kremlin.

536
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,900
It's so weird.
Abby Martin is a friend of mine.

537
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:34,901
She's been on the show several times and
she's great and she's one of the rare 

538
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:35,540
people that can kind of dress however 
she wants.

539
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,010
She dresses,
she wore slacks should wear.

540
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,190
I mean she's very pretty,
but she'll wear,

541
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,870
you know,
she'll wear something that makes it look

542
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:44,990
hot and then if that's what she wants to
wear or she'll wear something different.

543
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:49,040
But she has a weird situation there too 
where she's criticized Russia,

544
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,380
like especially what's going on in the 
Ukraine and you know,

545
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,200
and they were like,
we're going to send you to the Ukraine.

546
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,010
And she's like,
Whoa,

547
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:55,490
Whoa,
Whoa,

548
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,230
the fuck you are like,
no,

549
00:25:57,231 --> 00:26:02,231
you're not sending me to the Ukraine.
They like made a publicly or press 

550
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:06,190
statement because she was,
she was criticizing Putin's 

551
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,040
administration and what,
what was going on and you know,

552
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,830
was very public on television.

553
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,980
She did this thing and so they said,
we're going to send her to,

554
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,010
to Crimea so she can see what it's like 
on the ground.

555
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:16,480
She's like,
Yo,

556
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,670
you're fucking mind.
I'm not going to a war zone.

557
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,130
What did you guys,
you didn't talk to me like,

558
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,660
you know,
this is not happening.

559
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:25,550
I'm just telling you right now.
It's not happening.

560
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,650
But it's weird.
It's a weird place.

561
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,000
I've,
for Russia,

562
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:34,060
I'm pretty good friends with um,
a loaded mankowski and Jenny Churchill 

563
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,621
who used to work at rt on the aloneness 
show back in the day and then they went 

564
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:40,700
over to huff post and we're at huff post
live,

565
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,140
which is,
um,

566
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,080
where I kind of met them.
And that's where the science editor.

567
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:50,150
Yeah,
that's where I was their science 

568
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:50,150
correspondent.
There was a science editor in New York.

569
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:50,670
I did all their correspondent,
like on air work,

570
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,800
um,
and so I met them there and yeah,

571
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:57,801
they've told me some pretty interesting 
stories too about our t and a lot of 

572
00:26:57,801 --> 00:26:57,801
stuff has been leaked lately,
like you see it,

573
00:26:57,801 --> 00:27:02,690
like the reporters there have been more 
and more open about the fact that 

574
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:07,050
there's an obvious agenda at that news 
network and I feel like when it comes to

575
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,410
Russia reporting you have to take it 
with a huge grain of salt,

576
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,120
but they do a good job of investigative 
reporting in other parts of the world.

577
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,390
And also what's interesting is everybody
that knows about our t primarily knows 

578
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,200
about it from clips that were released 
on the Internet.

579
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,820
Yeah.
They,

580
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,290
they're really good about their social 
media and videos.

581
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,380
It's a big reality when it comes to all 
those new shows too and all those 

582
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,600
tonight show and talk shows their,
their whole thing is get a clip that 

583
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,411
pops it completely.
Something that you could put on 

584
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:42,351
television and the or put on television,
but then people will make a clip of it 

585
00:27:42,351 --> 00:27:43,980
and put it on Youtube.
I mean look at Snl,

586
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,490
obviously people still watch it if you 
want to believe Nielsen ratings,

587
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:52,491
but like that show is not good anymore.
It hasn't been good in a really long 

588
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:55,521
time,
but they really reinvented themselves 

589
00:27:55,521 --> 00:27:56,670
with the digital shorts a few years ago 
and as those were getting released,

590
00:27:56,671 --> 00:28:00,720
I mean there was this new kind of 
resurgence of young people being like,

591
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,370
oh,
snl is actually funny.

592
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,980
It's not so kind of worn out and old.
Yeah,

593
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,990
it's the whole problem with this and 
there's a bunch of problems but trying 

594
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,181
to do a new show every week and then 
just doing it live in front of an 

595
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:14,220
audience.
Just a terrible idea and they don't have

596
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,140
any.
It's like make it a half hour show.

597
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Like don't make it an out.
Because what ends up happening is they 

598
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,480
have good ideas for clips and then they 
just,

599
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,400
every,
every single sketch,

600
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:28,401
they just run it into the ground.
It's just like they get the joke and 

601
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:32,151
then they repeat it 10 times.
It's also like a super competitive 

602
00:28:32,151 --> 00:28:34,830
environment and you know Phil Hartman,
who was a good friend of mine,

603
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,030
we were on Newsradio together and he was
on Saturday night live and he had a 

604
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,760
nightmare stories like after talking to 
him about what it was like the 

605
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,380
backstabbing and all the weird behind 
the scenes shit that goes on.

606
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,380
People trying to force their,
their sketches in and other people cock 

607
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,380
blocking them.
It was just like,

608
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,550
oh,
that sounds horrible.

609
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,590
Worst thing,
the worst way to come up with something 

610
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,871
creative.
Like they have this like weird 

611
00:28:59,871 --> 00:28:59,871
competitive environment.
Like no one's supporting it.

612
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:00,420
I mean,
I don't know how it is there now,

613
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,910
but he told me some nightmare stories.
Yeah,

614
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,700
there were times when it was really 
amazing,

615
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:08,580
but yeah,
there was.

616
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,530
There were some times Eddie Murphy days,
there's,

617
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,490
you know,
I mean it's,

618
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:16,550
you're always going to have talented 
people who are capable of being funny 

619
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,011
under extreme circumstances can put them
in the worst scenario and they could 

620
00:29:19,011 --> 00:29:19,980
figure out how to make something funny 
occasionally,

621
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:25,010
but you're right,
like it would be better if it were much 

622
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,010
looser,
but it's TV.

623
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,490
Be Better if they had time,
like you need to work on a sketch like a

624
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:34,610
once a month sign and drive specials 
would probably be a fucking nuclear 

625
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:34,610
bomb.
That was really bad.

626
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,750
That's true,
but people have these expectations and 

627
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,851
they want to live up to those 
expectations and they want to keep up 

628
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:42,070
with the ratings and make enough money 
and all the old school

629
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,070
tv model is I,
I don't know how much life it has left 

630
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,070
in it.
The problem is that's where the money is

631
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,370
still.
It's a legacy model.

632
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:52,090
It's all of the investors,
all of the advertisers.

633
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,120
It's how they know how to do their jobs 
because they've been doing it for so 

634
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,770
long that they still pumped so much 
money into that machine.

635
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:04,771
I mean,
I see it as a freelancer when I get 

636
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:07,291
offered a TV job.
It always pays better than a web job 

637
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:09,370
across the board.
That's where the money is still in,

638
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,390
in and.
And that's where my agent is trying to 

639
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,471
push me.
I do a lot of web work because I like 

640
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:16,570
new media and I like that.
I can be free on it,

641
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:21,070
but the truth is we're still in this 
kind of legacy world with,

642
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:26,150
with old school media and until those 
large corporations start to understand 

643
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,890
new media,
I think that you're going to see this 

644
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:31,890
weird inflated bubble where all the 
money's still stays there,

645
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,310
but nobody's even fucking watching 
anymore.

646
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,890
It's adjusting.
It's adjusting slowly.

647
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:36,520
But it's,
it's,

648
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,110
it's definitely,
uh,

649
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,890
in this transitionary period where more 
people are kind of realizing,

650
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:43,270
hey,
isn't everybody on line?

651
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,500
Everyone is online,
right?

652
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,800
So isn't it aren't the same people that 
are online also watching television 

653
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,690
shows like we can reach them in both 
ways and then it will slowly shift.

654
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,750
In my opinion,
it's going to shift to the Internet 

655
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,750
almost entirely.
I really don't see.

656
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,940
The only benefit that I could see a 
networks is things like game of thrones 

657
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,661
where you need massive budgets to put on
these spectacular special effects and 

658
00:31:06,661 --> 00:31:07,000
everything in Ireland.

659
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,640
You know what I mean?
So I think you will be able to see and 

660
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,870
what happens when those production 
companies or when Hbo Rolls Out and it 

661
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,580
becomes a standalone app where you don't
need the cable provider anymore,

662
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,350
then fuck,
that's online too.

663
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:24,770
I mean,
the only things that I appointment view 

664
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,601
anymore at all on television are masters
of sex.

665
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,090
What does that?
Um,

666
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,120
it's on showtime.
Oh,

667
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,760
is that the Kinsey thing?
Well,

668
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:33,420
it's masters and Johnson,
so different researchers.

669
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:35,310
But yeah,
sex researchers from the fifties.

670
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,560
So this is like that movie was Liam 
Neeson.

671
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:38,950
Who the fuck

672
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,140
is that the Kinsey movie?
Yeah.

673
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:43,260
So,
so the Kinsey and then I don't remember,

674
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:47,130
but Kinsey and masters and Johnson are 
probably the most cited sex research,

675
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,160
historical sex researchers in psychology
courses where you learned about sexual 

676
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:57,171
behavior,
but masters and Johnson a really 

677
00:31:57,171 --> 00:31:57,270
interesting thing because masters was an
ob Gyn.

678
00:31:57,271 --> 00:32:02,271
Johnson was his research assistant and 
they fucked a lot and that's show.

679
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,840
And so they got.
They were the source of a lot of their 

680
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840
research.
Yeah.

681
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,050
And it's Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen.
It's really good.

682
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,910
Is it?
It's a great show.

683
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,020
That's interesting.
So is it,

684
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,330
is it a pervy show?
Is it Kinda like a.

685
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,460
well,
there's a lot of scientific about their 

686
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:20,460
socks.
Yeah.

687
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:20,850
Well yeah,
they totally are.

688
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:25,851
But it's a new field at this point.
Nobody has thought to investigate like 

689
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:29,990
sexual response.
So they are the first people to detail 

690
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,660
what happens when you have an orgasm.
They're the first people to try and take

691
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:32,820
measurements of female orgasm,
like all these.

692
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,420
Really nobody thought that that was 
legitimate research at the time.

693
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,390
So he gets thrown out of multiple 
institutions.

694
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,040
He's always getting

695
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,430
in trouble.

696
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,310
It is pretty fascinating.
We think about it.

697
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:45,320
It wasn't until the 20th century that 
people started researching stuff.

698
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,970
Oh.
And sexuality.

699
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:51,971
And even then it was all men,
like nobody gave a shit about a female 

700
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:51,971
response.
That was totally secondary.

701
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:56,220
Like because this is what happens.
This is another little feminist.

702
00:32:56,221 --> 00:32:59,220
I'm a soapbox.
Is that feminist though?

703
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,910
I have an issue with the term feminism.
I know it's kind of like,

704
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
it's the term feminism.
All it really means is that I support 

705
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:10,200
equal rights for women.
You know?

706
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,410
So in that sense of the term,
yes,

707
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,130
I'm very much a feminist,
but so were you.

708
00:33:14,131 --> 00:33:19,131
So it was probably everybody in this 
room and of the people listening for 

709
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,551
sure.
And so this is the thing when you don't 

710
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:25,401
have female physicians and you don't 
have female researchers because the 

711
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:29,211
institutions don't allow them,
then you don't have a female research 

712
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:32,781
perspective.
So all of the sudden all of your 

713
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:34,971
research subjects are men because nobody
thinks that it matters to research what 

714
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,490
happens to a woman's body.

715
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,940
And it took decades for research on 
female sexual response to catch up to 

716
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:46,281
research on male sexual response,
which is crazy because females are the 

717
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:46,640
child bears.
Yeah.

718
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,790
It's pretty bizarre.
I know.

719
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,330
We're pretty bizarre when you think 
about all the different things that used

720
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:56,331
to be used on women,
like the women used to go to a doctor to

721
00:33:56,581 --> 00:34:01,581
get manually manipulated to orgasm 
because they were like suffering from 

722
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,720
hysteria,
hysteria,

723
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,660
hysterectomy,
hysteria.

724
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,470
They all connected.
Like that was the idea.

725
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,500
And you know,
in women who would go to hospitals for 

726
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,350
exhaustion,
that was like a common thing to Austin.

727
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:18,750
She's hospitalized for exhaustion,
which is celebrities still do that.

728
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,630
Precious.
They say,

729
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,490
yeah,
they say that,

730
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,940
but it's like it's either depression or 
substance abuse.

731
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,730
Right.
That's what they used to call them,

732
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,780
exhaustion and it was only women,
wasn't men that were going to do it 

733
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,260
sometimes too,
but it was very common for housewives to

734
00:34:31,261 --> 00:34:33,350
go in for exhaustion.
Wow.

735
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,160
What they do to.
I'm just check them off,

736
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:40,180
just they might've.
They might have and they probably gave 

737
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,361
him like early versions of psychiatric 
medications and they basically let them 

738
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:44,650
leave whatever stressful environment 
they weren't.

739
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,740
Get away from the babies that were 
making you depressed.

740
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:49,800
Get away from the husband,
go be on your own for a bit.

741
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:52,380
Read a fucking book.
Do you think it's fair to think that

742
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,440
as life becomes easier and as a society 
and civilization is more like goods are 

743
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:02,220
more accessible?
It's easier to get food.

744
00:35:02,221 --> 00:35:07,221
It's easier to get water.
It's easy to get services and then 

745
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:11,330
slowly but surely things sort of 
equalized in terms of the more 

746
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,730
aggressive sex males paying more 
attention to the needs of the female.

747
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:17,820
But in the old days when things were 
much harsher,

748
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:21,120
people lived less that they have a 
shorter lifespan.

749
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,230
The world was a darker place than it was
more sexist.

750
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,450
Do you think it was more like men were 
just like,

751
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:27,830
look,
this is,

752
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:29,670
these are tough times.
Fuck off bitch,

753
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,020
you know,
I'm going to get mine.

754
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,450
I think it's probably both.
I think that there's definitely,

755
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:38,130
you look at kind of maslow's hierarchy 
of needs you've ever studied

756
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,700
psychology,
hospitalized for exhaustion make you 

757
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:49,290
look at maslow's hierarchy of needs and 
it's like this pyramid.

758
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:54,291
It's like the food pyramid,
but it's the needs pyramid and at the 

759
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:54,780
bottom are things like food and water 
and shelter.

760
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,000
Like when you're concerned about food 
and water and shelter,

761
00:35:57,001 --> 00:36:01,770
you're not concerned about things like 
love and um,

762
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,780
friendship.
And then as you get to the top,

763
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:06,420
it's things like self actualization and 
Blah Blah Blah.

764
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,810
So I think that there is a component of 
yes,

765
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:14,811
if you're just struggling to survive,
contemplating or waxing philosophical 

766
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:17,750
about it,
you know,

767
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,700
civil liberties and things like that,
it's not in your.

768
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:24,330
So you may be very instinctual and you 
may be aggressive because of that or for

769
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:29,331
whatever reason you may see kind of 
patriarchal lines that are drawn in the 

770
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:31,380
sand and some sexism and some violence.
But I think on top of that,

771
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,900
maybe that would always be the case.

772
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,930
So long as women didn't have a voice.
I'm not sure.

773
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,960
I'm not sure if just moving to the 
future and I'm not sure if it has a 

774
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,210
function,
if it's a function of people having more

775
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:46,560
access to food and goods and services or
if it's really a function of women.

776
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,650
Because what happened was women were 
mothers and men said,

777
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,630
okay,
mothers bring life.

778
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,300
This is something that we should respect
and we should honor.

779
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,710
And this was a historical norm for a 
very long time.

780
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:06,711
And then as you know,
these kind of hunter gatherer societies 

781
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:09,060
moved into more agrarian societies and 
started to form cultural structures.

782
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:14,270
Men realized I can overpower that bitch,
like I have physical strength and I can 

783
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:19,851
physically put this woman in her place,
and as they realized that there was a 

784
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,790
power differential between them,
that men were physically stronger.

785
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:28,791
I think that's where a lot of 
patriarchal wisdom comes from is that 

786
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:29,730
men are physically stronger than women.

787
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,790
Do you think that wasn't there was there
was realized not until there was 

788
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:40,041
agriculture and until there was cities 
and I think that that was a big part of 

789
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:42,180
it is when you think that that would be 
a big part of it everywhere.

790
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:47,181
I mean all primitive cultures.
Well if you are a hunter gatherer type 

791
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:52,191
and so you're living in a very small 
tribe and you're concerned about kinship

792
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:57,291
or the welfare of your children,
then I think that there's a certain 

793
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,610
amount of respect and honor that you are
going to pay to your wife,

794
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,590
but why does that go away with 
agriculture?

795
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:04,680
Why does it go away with the city?
It's not so much agriculture as it is.

796
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:07,080
All of the things that come along with 
that agriculture,

797
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:12,081
which is maybe political power,
which is starting to stratify and have 

798
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,280
jobs and,
and it no longer are you making your own

799
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:16,050
clothes,
making your own shoes,

800
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:19,200
doing your own hunting,
doing your own cooking.

801
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:23,250
All of a sudden now you're a cobbler and
you're a butcher and you're whatever.

802
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:28,251
And so people have to depend on one 
another for goods and services and they 

803
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:28,740
have to say,
okay,

804
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:33,741
I'll trade you this for that.
And then money comes into play and 

805
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:36,351
bartering and all of a sudden,
whereas it was a lot more egalitarian 

806
00:38:36,351 --> 00:38:36,351
before where

807
00:38:36,351 --> 00:38:41,100
everybody kind of had a strong role 
because they were taking care of 

808
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,170
themselves or they're very small groups.
Their family groups.

809
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,960
Now all of a sudden they have a place in
society.

810
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:49,110
And that's I think where you really 
start to see a subjection of women is 

811
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:54,400
because men start to develop power 
within societies.

812
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:59,401
And if you look back historically,
there are no known societies that were 

813
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:03,190
matriarchal societies,
but you do see in smaller kind of tribal

814
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:05,950
communities,
more matriarchal,

815
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:11,010
um,
ideology more kind of honoring and 

816
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,310
worshiping of mother figures and mother 
gods.

817
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,120
But every time there's a society,
it becomes patriarchal historically,

818
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,580
throughout every time.
There's no such thing as those.

819
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,450
Yeah,
all of it.

820
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,300
There is no such thing as those 
Amazonian women tribe that,

821
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:27,301
you know,
people talk about like the Amazonian 

822
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:27,301
women.
That's your girlfriend.

823
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:27,720
Yeah.
And that's not a real thing,

824
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,350
like women are going to take care of 
them.

825
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,460
It's a myth.
It's a myth.

826
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,020
So their vaginas.
So,

827
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,690
and I don't know,
I can't say that that's a cause of it,

828
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:39,691
but those things are highly correlated.
But do you think that that evens out 

829
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:42,400
once civilization society becomes more 
complex and has.

830
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,570
So my,
my point was that scarcity makes people 

831
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,510
desperate and when people get desperate,
they victimized not just women,

832
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:52,560
but they've victimized week.
Exactly one week.

833
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,690
It's like you know who,
who were the people that we historically

834
00:39:55,691 --> 00:40:00,691
look to for like heroic figures in times
of great stress when people that pulled 

835
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:06,561
themselves up by their bootstraps and go
out there and kick some fucking ass 

836
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:06,561
people with big muscles.
So I mean that's the thing.

837
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:11,161
It's,
it's such a brutish and such an 

838
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:11,161
underdeveloped,
a way to value strength,

839
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:13,720
to only value strength in like I punch 
harder,

840
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,150
right?
Because there's other forms of strength,

841
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:19,360
but you're right,
when people are desperate,

842
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,820
people know that,
that,

843
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,350
you know,
think about if you're having an argument

844
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:27,190
with another guy or if something comes 
to a head even at work,

845
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,220
wherever,
and you're having an argument and you 

846
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,410
can't agree with each other and you 
start to get more and more frustrated.

847
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,300
What's the way in every film,
in every I'm a book.

848
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,160
What's the way that it finally get 
settled?

849
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You roll up your sleeves and you get 
into a physical altercation with each 

850
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,081
other,
which is just not a form of strength or 

851
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:49,081
not a form of,
um,

852
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:53,170
of settling a score that's common in 
like feet.

853
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,830
In females it happens.
Don't ever watch basketball wives.

854
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,010
Yeah,
it happens.

855
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,250
They throw it out like the worst of the 
worst to.

856
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,520
Not Normal.
It's counterintuitive,

857
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:06,310
but the best way to avoid that with men 
is martial arts.

858
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:11,260
Get men in a situation where they train 
and they compete against each other on a

859
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:16,261
regular basis.
They don't have this need to dominate 

860
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:19,381
each other the way it's true because I 
do think that it's a bit stupid to to to

861
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,230
just completely ignore the role that 
things like testosterone play in gender 

862
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:30,691
dimorphism like in female male 
differences in humans and and other 

863
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:34,190
higher order mammals like testosterone 
is

864
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,190
a is a chemical that actually is highly 
linked to things like aggression and 

865
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:45,341
feeling tension and having this need to 
release that in some way and we have 

866
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:50,621
less of it.
We have significantly less of it and 

867
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:53,501
some women are more aggressive in.
Some women are completely passive and 

868
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:56,411
are never aggressive that way,
but there is a significant difference 

869
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:57,950
between males and females and 
testosterone is a big reason for that.

870
00:41:57,951 --> 00:41:59,540
So being able to get that aggression 
out,

871
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,780
whether it's on a heavy bag or whether 
it's through martial arts or whatever 

872
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,790
exercises you use,
I think it's irresponsible to think that

873
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,290
that's not part of the equation.

874
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,630
Yeah,
it definitely is for a man coming from a

875
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:14,390
male point of view.
I know it makes a significant difference

876
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:16,070
with me whether or not I can release it 
or not,

877
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,280
but it's also the just doing martial 
arts and being involved in something 

878
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:26,831
that gives you an understanding of what 
physical confrontation is really all 

879
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:26,831
about it.
It doesn't.

880
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:31,630
It's not this scary thing that every man
has to like puff his chest up to avoid 

881
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:36,701
happening or.
Or you go into it completely ignorantly 

882
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:40,840
thinking it's like a movie,
like you're going to sock some guy and 

883
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,511
that's going to be the end of it and 
meanwhile you throw a punch at him and 

884
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:43,511
he moves his head and you're like,
oh shit.

885
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:48,341
This guy actually knows how to fight.
Now I'm fucked because now I tried to 

886
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:48,341
hit somebody that is not going to let me
hit them.

887
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:52,860
They're going gonna beat me up.
A lot of that I think comes from fear 

888
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,060
and it comes from ignorance.
It comes from other ridiculous,

889
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,640
these media depictions of what happens 
when people hit each other.

890
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,370
One the things that drives me fucking 
crazy and I really wanted to talk to you

891
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:02,450
about this because I wanted to get into 
depression is a head trauma.

892
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:07,770
Like there's so many God damn movies 
where someone hit someone in the head 

893
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,741
and they fall down,
they get up and they rub their head and 

894
00:43:11,741 --> 00:43:13,781
they were out cold and then they go out 
and they fucking have a crazy fistfight 

895
00:43:13,781 --> 00:43:15,000
with 100 people or you know,
they,

896
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,940
they make it like they're back to 
normal.

897
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:19,640
Like they get shut off and they come 
back to normal and that's fine.

898
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,640
Guy Is like,
you know,

899
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,230
this great martial artist is,
is in a fight with like 10 other dudes.

900
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:31,231
Right?
And then he's like punching and kicking 

901
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:33,000
and then he does that thing where he 
headbutts like tons of like cracked his 

902
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,530
skull against the skull of like multiple
people in a row.

903
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:37,300
And it's like in no way affected by it.

904
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,420
Well,
headbutts,

905
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,840
it's really weird thing,
but the way to do it correctly,

906
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:46,730
it actually is effective because you're 
using this part of your head,

907
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:51,731
your forehead,
which is a really hard part and you 

908
00:43:51,731 --> 00:43:53,820
smash them in the nose and your nose 
kind of gives in so crazy,

909
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,540
but it works.
It works like crazy.

910
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,630
I wish we had a shot of redband just 
then when there's a great video of a 

911
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,750
woman knocking a guy out in a bar,
this.

912
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,950
There was some sort of a bar fight in 
this.

913
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:10,990
This guy was involved in a fight with 
this woman's boyfriend and the guy grabs

914
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:16,631
the woman and the woman grabs the guy 
shirts and slams him in the head right 

915
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,940
on his nose and the guy goes out cold 
and goes limp and it's hilarious because

916
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:24,941
it's like this little woman and this big
man and she knocks him out with her 

917
00:44:24,941 --> 00:44:24,941
head.

918
00:44:24,941 --> 00:44:25,410
Yeah,
but that's that.

919
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,560
They never showed that in the movie.
They never hit him in the nose.

920
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:29,600
They hit him like in the same part of 
their head.

921
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,350
Yeah.
You can't do that.

922
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Well you can.
You're going to scramble your brain or 

923
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,420
Samoan if you're like one of those dudes
with extra big head,

924
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:38,790
you can get away with that,
but for most people you smash him in the

925
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:39,380
nose.
I mean,

926
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,680
you probably don't want to do that too 
much.

927
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:43,410
We're even seeing that there are just a 
video.

928
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,170
This watch.
This girl had bought this dude.

929
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:51,171
It's fucking hilarious because there's 
all this shit going on and this girl 

930
00:44:51,171 --> 00:44:54,951
just grabs this dude and Kaos see if you
can cut to it because it's kind of a 

931
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:56,790
long video.
If I remember correctly.

932
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,720
There's like a lot of shit going on.
Big Bar fight.

933
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,890
Oh,
just isolate it because this is.

934
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,370
Is he punching her?
No,

935
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,190
I think.
Yeah.

936
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:05,940
Oh my God.

937
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,450
Dude.
That's insane.

938
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,350
Yeah.
I don't know when in this video.

939
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,900
I don't think this is the same video.
I think this is a different one.

940
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,440
Yeah.
This isn't the same video.

941
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,160
The other video was indoors.
That one,

942
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,450
that one's outdoors,
but whatever.

943
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:23,980
Um,
yeah.

944
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,980
Like even,
you know,

945
00:45:24,981 --> 00:45:28,730
they're finding that soccer players,
just the multiple,

946
00:45:28,731 --> 00:45:33,731
the movement of like hitting a ball with
your head over and over and over and 

947
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,880
over and over causes mild concussive 
injuries.

948
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:39,881
So yeah,
cracking people in the skulls a lot is 

949
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:39,881
probably.
Yeah,

950
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:41,330
it's not really avoided.
Well,

951
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:42,320
you know,
and me,

952
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:47,321
I've obviously I come from this 
background of not just constantly doing 

953
00:45:47,321 --> 00:45:51,251
that my whole life,
but being around it my whole life I've 

954
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:54,040
been around so many guys getting hit in 
the head and I've seen them from the 

955
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,720
beginning of their career and then I see
them at the end of the career and I see 

956
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,121
a significant decline in how they 
communicate and how I'm sure how they 

957
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:05,711
feel.
They seem like old men when they're in 

958
00:46:05,711 --> 00:46:07,691
their forties and depression is a real 
issue and it's one of the reasons why I 

959
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:09,650
wanted to bring this up is because my 
friend Mark Gordon,

960
00:46:09,651 --> 00:46:14,651
Dr Mark Gordon,
who's an expert in traumatic brain 

961
00:46:14,651 --> 00:46:17,531
injury and he works a lot with soldiers 
and athletes that have had significant 

962
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:23,621
brain trauma and they have a lot of 
issues with their hormones afterwards.

963
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,920
The pituitary gland is extremely 
sensitive and he wrote a piece 

964
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,090
connecting Robin Williams with 
depression,

965
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:37,150
not just based on a lot of factors.
I mean robin had a lot of things going 

966
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,230
on and he,
he obviously had substance abuse issues.

967
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:44,231
He obviously he had the Parkinson's 
issue which was also taking medication 

968
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,520
for Parkinson's,
which has been connected to depression,

969
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,760
but he also had heart surgery and his Dr
Gordon's connection was that Robin 

970
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:59,120
Williams having had this major heart 
valve replacement,

971
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,360
which entails many hours of anesthesia,
lowered blood pressure and the 

972
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,990
literature speaks of post cardiac 
surgery,

973
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:10,991
depression and over 100 publications and
that the prolonged surgery with low 

974
00:47:11,091 --> 00:47:16,091
blood pressure,
they believe precipitates a perform a 

975
00:47:16,091 --> 00:47:19,361
form of she hands syndrome,
which is the loss of important brain 

976
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:19,361
hormones.
Oh,

977
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:19,760
interesting.
Additionally,

978
00:47:19,761 --> 00:47:23,630
there is an increase in reverse t three 
and a decrease in t three,

979
00:47:23,631 --> 00:47:28,631
which can cause a relative 
hypothyroidism that's also associated 

980
00:47:28,631 --> 00:47:32,831
with depression.
And Mark Gordon wrote this whole piece 

981
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:35,221
about it and he's saying that what 
people have to consider more is like 

982
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:39,040
when you take someone into a situation 
where you're fixing their heart,

983
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,010
you're,
you're,

984
00:47:40,011 --> 00:47:45,011
uh,
you also have to realize that there's 

985
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:45,011
gonna be some adverse effect.
The whole body's gonna react to this.

986
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:46,000
It's not just gonna be about,
look,

987
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,290
your heart's fixed,
you know,

988
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:48,650
why are you so sad?
You know,

989
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,280
hormones are fucking completely out of 
whack now.

990
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,670
And that could have played a factor in 
this that was ignored.

991
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,720
Well,
and that's something that I think that 

992
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,630
we've historically had this really weird
approach to medicine,

993
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:05,631
which I think is kind of a secondary 
effect of thinking scientifically.

994
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,990
And obviously I,
my background is in neuroscience.

995
00:48:09,991 --> 00:48:14,991
I worked as a scientist for many years 
and I am very much a scientific thinker 

996
00:48:15,691 --> 00:48:20,691
and I'm all about the scientific method.
But I think that we sometimes are at 

997
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:23,250
fault when we're a little bit too 
reductionistic and our views.

998
00:48:23,251 --> 00:48:25,170
And so if you look at the history of 
modern medicine,

999
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:30,180
of evidence based medicine,
what ends up happening is that we look 

1000
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,831
at a problem and we try to fix the 
problem and we look at it as if you can 

1001
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:38,241
somehow cut that piece of the person's 
physiology completely out of them,

1002
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,730
solve it,
and then put it right back in.

1003
00:48:41,731 --> 00:48:44,520
And it doesn't have any effect on 
anything else in their bodies.

1004
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,320
I mean,
you look at medication,

1005
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,350
right?
Um,

1006
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,190
any,
any form of pharmaceutical,

1007
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:54,030
they all have side effects.
If you think about what a side effect is

1008
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:56,790
it,
it comes down to how medication works of

1009
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
medicine is a molecule.
It's some sort of molecule that fits in 

1010
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,620
a receptor somewhere in your body.
And the idea is that you want it to have

1011
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,000
really high efficacy.
So let's say that I'm somebody who has a

1012
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:14,030
problem with blood pressure for example.
Or actually let's just jump into 

1013
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:20,121
depression because I've been talking 
about this a lot lately around Robin 

1014
00:49:20,121 --> 00:49:21,030
Williams.
I had Paul Gil Martin on my podcast just

1015
00:49:21,031 --> 00:49:22,470
last week to talk about that.
He,

1016
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:27,471
he hosts the mental illness.
Happy hour podcast and has really great 

1017
00:49:27,471 --> 00:49:31,251
insights into mental illness and I of 
course publicly have dealt with 

1018
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:34,080
depression most of my life.
I take medication every day.

1019
00:49:34,081 --> 00:49:36,270
I go to therapy every week.
I'm very open about it.

1020
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,120
Isn't that for a lot of people,
they would look at you,

1021
00:49:39,121 --> 00:49:40,950
especially people that don't have any 
issues with depression.

1022
00:49:40,951 --> 00:49:42,780
They look at you,
obviously very intelligent,

1023
00:49:42,781 --> 00:49:44,970
beautiful young.
Why would you be depressed?

1024
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,940
Guys probably tripping over themselves 
trying to date you.

1025
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,020
You,
you.

1026
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:53,520
You're obviously very successful in 
pursuing intellectual pursuits.

1027
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,040
Why would you be depressed?
For a lot of people are like,

1028
00:49:56,041 --> 00:50:01,041
why would a lot of people don't 
understand the difference between 

1029
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,321
depression and sadness and they don't 
understand that depression is a 

1030
00:50:03,321 --> 00:50:06,740
biological illness.
Know they don't think of it and they 

1031
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,480
also don't think of it in terms of like 
people look at it in terms of like,

1032
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,870
well,
you've got all these sums.

1033
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,090
Looks like you've got all this,
these numbers.

1034
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:12,690
Look,
there's all

1035
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,450
that almost can can make it worse for 
certain people.

1036
00:50:15,451 --> 00:50:20,451
I mean,
you look at somebody like Robin 

1037
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:20,451
Williams,
he had so much going for him right?

1038
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:20,451
He was famous,
he was loved,

1039
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:21,540
he had all this money.
How could he be depressed?

1040
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:24,840
He didn't have the problems that you 
were I have and you know what?

1041
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:29,930
Then you have this extra layer of guilt.
You have this extra layer of shame,

1042
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,530
this extra layer of why the fuck am I 
still depressed?

1043
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,560
No matter how much success I get,
no matter how much money I make,

1044
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:41,830
no matter how much people write me 
letters and say that they love me and 

1045
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,840
and whatever.
I can't seem to beat this feeling inside

1046
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:49,841
of me.
This constellation of symptoms because 

1047
00:50:49,841 --> 00:50:51,770
it's not coming from that.
It's coming from your brain,

1048
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:52,360
isn't it?

1049
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:58,160
I don't suffer from depression,
but I have had many friends who do and I

1050
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:03,200
have always wondered what it's because 
it seems to be that when you go to a 

1051
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,921
doctor and they start treating it with a
treat it with medication or they try to 

1052
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:08,460
adjust your diet and prescribe exercise 
first,

1053
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,760
that there's no like one simple fix and 
everybody's completely different.

1054
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,890
We'll get people get upset about that 
because I think it goes back to,

1055
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:20,390
to kind of what I was talking about 
before,

1056
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:22,440
which is a meandering way to,
to.

1057
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,710
Okay,
so again,

1058
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:27,290
to go back to this idea of a drug,
you take a drug,

1059
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:32,291
let's say I take an antidepressant.
My antidepressants specifically is a 

1060
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,910
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,
an Ssri that's called citalopram.

1061
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:37,070
That's the off brand.
I think it's Selectsa,

1062
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,440
um,
is the brand name I take that it binds 

1063
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,031
to my serotonin receptors in my brain 
and it allows me to dump more Serotonin 

1064
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:52,481
into the synopsis that the gap between 
two brain cells so that I always have 

1065
00:51:52,481 --> 00:51:56,651
more available.
It basically tells my brain that I need 

1066
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:57,710
more serotonin so I make more serotonin 
available to myself.

1067
00:51:57,711 --> 00:51:59,180
It's a,
it's a real uptake inhibitor.

1068
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,890
And so I'm sorry,
it keeps more serotonin in,

1069
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,090
in the gap,
um,

1070
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,910
instead of sucking it back into the 
cell.

1071
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,420
So I always have more available to me 
now.

1072
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:14,260
It's a molecule.
It's got a shape just like anything out 

1073
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:14,260
there.
It has geometry,

1074
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:18,640
so it binds to this specific receptor in
the brain because it had got a similar 

1075
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,880
shape to that.
There are other things in your body that

1076
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:24,620
are similarly shaped and so what ends up
happening is when you take a drug,

1077
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:30,100
the specificity of the drug is only 
based on whether or not the key fits in 

1078
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,631
a locked somewhere in your body,
but let's say that you had hundreds of 

1079
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:38,650
thousands,
millions of locks available to you and 

1080
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,661
one key and you started going through.
You'd be able to stick that in a bunch 

1081
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:41,030
of locks.
Some of them it might even turn,

1082
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:46,130
but it would fit in the lock of multiple
locks hanging on that wall.

1083
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,530
So what ends up happening is I take this
drug,

1084
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:53,770
it binds in my brain,
it does what it's supposed to do in my 

1085
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,591
brain,
but it also may be does other shit like 

1086
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:59,321
makes me really fucking tired or it 
makes it so I don't want to have sex as 

1087
00:52:59,321 --> 00:52:59,321
often.

1088
00:52:59,321 --> 00:53:03,880
It's a side effect and the reason that 
you have a side effect is because 

1089
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,960
there's other parts of your body that 
the drug binds to.

1090
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,050
It's the same thing with medicine.
Like you were saying,

1091
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:14,300
you operate on somebody heart.
The heart is connected to other things.

1092
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,420
It's it,
it's the source of blood flow throughout

1093
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:20,570
your body.
It is connected to hormone levels.

1094
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:24,050
There's all sorts of things that can 
happen when you put somebody under under

1095
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:26,220
anesthesia,
when you them open,

1096
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:27,560
when you,
uh,

1097
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,290
you know,
you,

1098
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:32,820
you cause an immune response and 
inflammatory response there your body is

1099
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:37,821
a holistic thing and so when you start 
jacking with certain things,

1100
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:43,010
other things are going to happen.
That doesn't mean you should throw the 

1101
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:46,401
baby out with the bathwater,
but medicine is a risk benefit analysis 

1102
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:47,640
always.
But how do they find the.

1103
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:53,150
It seems to me that they find the right 
medication by experimentation that they 

1104
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:53,150
try it.

1105
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,440
And is that just the only way?
It's because we don't have any test.

1106
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:58,770
I can't.
You can't go up as a doctor.

1107
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:01,350
You can't come to me,
stick a needle in my spinal cord,

1108
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,640
take out my cerebral spinal fluid and 
measure how much serotonin I have in it.

1109
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,670
I wish you could.
I wish I could take some sort of a blood

1110
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:10,340
test or I could,
you know,

1111
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,120
pee in a cup and then you could analyze 
that p and say you're low on Serotonin.

1112
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,910
You need an Ssri.
That would be what works for you because

1113
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:21,200
other people's depression comes from 
problems with dopamine,

1114
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,020
comes from problems with norepinephrine 
or some combination thereof.

1115
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:27,060
But there's no test for it.
It fucking sucks.

1116
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:32,090
There's no test for it.
And so what ends up happening is you 

1117
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:32,730
have to play a musical chairs.
You try a drug.

1118
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,480
Maybe it was the first drug I tried for 
aunt,

1119
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:39,510
uh,
when I decided to finally go on 

1120
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,510
antidepressants,
fucked me up so bad.

1121
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,830
I took an n,
d,

1122
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:45,030
R I a selective serotonin norepinephrine
and dopamine reuptake inhibitor.

1123
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,220
I was so fucking depressed.
I couldn't function.

1124
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,260
And we decided,
let's throw the book at it.

1125
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:53,550
Let's take the drug of all drugs,
the monster drug that does everything.

1126
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:57,480
And I couldn't sleep for a week.
I felt like I was on straight up crank.

1127
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:00,690
Like on crystal.
I quit smoking,

1128
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,510
I quit smoking.
It was awesome.

1129
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:05,420
That's when I quit smoking.
That's an important point.

1130
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,280
Terrible for your body.
Horrible.

1131
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:13,340
Did you do anything to try to naturally 
stimulate your body to produce more 

1132
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:17,790
serotonin?
Did you try a lot of exercise?

1133
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,880
Did you adjust your diet but you didn't 
quit smoking?

1134
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:27,050
I did.
I mean ultimately you've got on the 

1135
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:28,971
drugs,
didn't trust only on the drug for a 

1136
00:55:28,971 --> 00:55:28,980
week.
So as soon as I got off the drug again,

1137
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:30,780
I immediately wanted to smoke again.

1138
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,790
But at that point I'd push through it 
and I said,

1139
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:33,330
you know,
I'm,

1140
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:38,990
I'm at my lowest.
I was at my lowest point I've ever been 

1141
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:38,990
at.
So I was like,

1142
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:38,990
fuck,
it can't get any worse.

1143
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:39,710
And I did.
I quit smoking and it's been a couple of

1144
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:40,470
years.
But I did,

1145
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,120
I tried.
But the truth is,

1146
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,790
this is why addiction research is so 
important.

1147
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:49,791
This is why researchers go into the lab 
with a bunch of mice or whatever and 

1148
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:50,520
they feed them a bunch of cocaine and 
they,

1149
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:55,521
you know,
do these different kinds of experiments 

1150
00:55:55,521 --> 00:55:58,161
where you,
you've heard of the famous experiment 

1151
00:55:58,161 --> 00:55:59,961
where you have the mouse in the cage and
it's got a bar pressing paradigms that 

1152
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:03,951
can push the bar.
It gets coke and then like it just 

1153
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:03,951
fucking does that until it dies.
Like it.

1154
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:04,710
Like there's food right next to it and 
it's like,

1155
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:05,640
no,
I want more coke,

1156
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:09,180
and then it just dies.
And so the.

1157
00:56:09,181 --> 00:56:14,181
Obviously there's something happening.
This is a natural phenomenon because 

1158
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:16,941
mice don't have value judgments.
They're not thinking about this from a 

1159
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:16,941
religious perspective.
They're not saying,

1160
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,400
I don't know,
maybe I should stop doing this coke and 

1161
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:22,400
maybe exercise a little more and that'll
give me the same kind of high.

1162
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,100
It overwhelms.
It's

1163
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,550
such a strong addiction.
Nicotine have the same sort of addictive

1164
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:31,180
properties are more addictive.
Nicotine is nicotine.

1165
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:35,200
Natural in the natural form is not like 
nicotine as far as like pipe smoke,

1166
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,350
nicotine is still addictive.
Even if you're talking about like vaping

1167
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:40,810
it or something like that,
and I'm talking about like the,

1168
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:44,320
like traditional methods of it,
like the way they would smoke tobacco in

1169
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:47,170
a pipe or a cigar or something.
It's not as addictive.

1170
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,330
I don't think it's as addictive,
but it's still addictive.

1171
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:54,360
I mean it's still,
it's the nicotine is the molecule that 

1172
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:54,490
studied in laboratories.
It's not the tar,

1173
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:56,350
it's not the shit that comes in the 
papers now.

1174
00:56:56,351 --> 00:57:00,430
That's what has much more carcinogenic 
properties,

1175
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:05,431
but nicotine itself is highly addictive 
and that's the molecule that studied in 

1176
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,360
research.
It's pure nicotine.

1177
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:12,750
Nicotine itself.
It doesn't actually have some medicinal 

1178
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:12,750
benefits.

1179
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,620
It does.
It's actually neuroprotective so it can 

1180
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:15,620
protect against Parkinson's.
Wow.

1181
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,130
So if you smoke you won't get 
Parkinson's.

1182
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,100
Well,
I wouldn't say that,

1183
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:23,101
but there is some evidence in the lab 
that animals that were given nicotine,

1184
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:28,650
um,
had a lower incidence rate of 

1185
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:28,650
Parkinson's.
Is it,

1186
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,310
is it dangerous in the form that people 
take it as far as like gum or things 

1187
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,450
along those lines as much less 
dangerous,

1188
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:39,451
but the goal still would be to get off 
of nicotine because the reason they're 

1189
00:57:39,451 --> 00:57:39,910
chewing the gum is because they're still
addicted to it,

1190
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:44,970
but is there a way to take a small 
amount of it that gives you those 

1191
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:44,970
neuroprotective properties but it's not 
dangerous?

1192
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,060
Possibly.
I'm on,

1193
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:49,900
but I think it would be important for us
to see more research to see how.

1194
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,630
How you know,
again,

1195
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:56,140
it's a risk benefit analysis.
Like is it really that beneficial?

1196
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,200
I don't know.
It's hard to say what's the dose 

1197
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,091
response curve?
How much would you have to take for it 

1198
00:58:03,091 --> 00:58:05,221
to be beneficial?
The thing about depression that is 

1199
00:58:05,221 --> 00:58:08,310
fascinating to me is that there are some
correlations between how well your life 

1200
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:10,450
is going.
Do you have relationships?

1201
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:12,820
Do you,
are you happy with what you choose to do

1202
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:16,150
with your day?
I had a friend who was a.

1203
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:20,800
He was on like some serious a SSRI and 
they changed his life.

1204
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:21,590
They got him.
He,

1205
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,680
he quit his business.
He quit his job,

1206
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:26,050
brother started his own business,
got involved in relationship,

1207
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:28,210
and then once he got to a really good 
place,

1208
00:58:28,211 --> 00:58:31,300
he slowly weaned himself off the 
antidepressants and now he's great.

1209
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:36,390
Yeah,
and that happens to a lot of people and 

1210
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:37,981
so I think that there's different.
What we have to understand too is of 

1211
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,520
course all psychiatric disorders or 
spectrum disorders,

1212
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:39,760
right?

1213
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,760
There's really extreme examples and 
there's barely any examples and if 

1214
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,730
anybody who's ever taken a psych course 
or who studied,

1215
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,860
you know,
if you were a psych major in college,

1216
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:49,690
you know that as you've studied the dsm 
four,

1217
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:54,691
which is,
it's called the diagnostic and 

1218
00:58:54,691 --> 00:58:54,820
statistical manual that they use in 
psychiatry and psychology.

1219
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,820
It's basically the big Bible of all the 
things you can be diagnosed with.

1220
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,290
The more you study it,
the more you're like,

1221
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:00,070
I have that.
Oh,

1222
00:59:00,071 --> 00:59:00,610
I have that.
Oh,

1223
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:04,480
it totally fucking have that.
And you realize everybody has.

1224
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,240
Everybody can convince themselves that 
they have these.

1225
00:59:07,241 --> 00:59:09,460
It's like web md.
You know what I mean?

1226
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:13,210
So it's only once it is sufficient,
lee,

1227
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,540
detrimental to your life,
that it affects your relationships.

1228
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:18,700
It affects Your ability to work,
it affects your health,

1229
00:59:18,701 --> 00:59:23,701
whatever the case may be,
and usually within the dsm there maybe 

1230
00:59:23,701 --> 00:59:23,701
like

1231
00:59:23,701 --> 00:59:27,130
eight things and it's like you have to 
have five out of these eight things and 

1232
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:27,130
so anybody can read it and go,
oh,

1233
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:32,080
I've felt depression before,
but what they don't realize is there is 

1234
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,830
a difference between depression and 
sadness.

1235
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,710
There's also a difference between parody
depressIon,

1236
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:41,000
so depression that lasts years,
decades,

1237
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:46,120
and the type of depression that people 
get that's directly linked to life 

1238
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,130
events and that's your dog dies,
you will a big one.

1239
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:54,160
You lose your freaking job.
Like we've seen so many documentaries 

1240
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:54,160
lately about this.
As the economy took a downturn,

1241
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,870
people lose their job and then they 
ended up committing suicide because they

1242
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:59,750
can't.
It's like this cascade of awfulness.

1243
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:01,680
That's a really common one.
Um,

1244
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:03,410
you know,
family member dies,

1245
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:07,670
you have a stillborn or you have an 
abortion or you how you have a baby,

1246
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:12,671
a healthy baby.
Postpartum depression is incredibly 

1247
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:12,671
common.

1248
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:16,300
And in that case,
that's much more common that people can 

1249
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:16,300
take meds,
they can do all these things,

1250
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,130
and once they get back to where they 
were before that horrible life event,

1251
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:24,610
they're okay to get off off the meds.
Some people are able to get their 

1252
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:29,570
depression managed without medication 
perfectly well,

1253
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:35,210
but some people aren't.
Is the different reactions that 

1254
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,230
different people have two different 
medication?

1255
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:41,290
IS it because their depression has a 
different source or is it just a 

1256
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:45,950
biodiversity?
I think it's more of a biodiversity 

1257
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:46,100
thing than a source thing as sources.
Hard to say.

1258
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:49,010
So depression is both.
When you think about it.

1259
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:54,040
Well,
brain and mind are the same thing in 

1260
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:54,050
most modern neuroscientists say that 
brain and mind are two sides of the same

1261
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:59,051
coin.
That mind is just an emergent property 

1262
01:00:59,051 --> 01:00:59,051
of brain.
Nobody's a dualist anymore.

1263
01:00:59,051 --> 01:01:03,730
They don't think that you can like heal 
the mind and it has no effect on the 

1264
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:04,160
brain because it's the same fucking 
thing.

1265
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,160
So there are some people's depression 
comes from the fact that their dopamine 

1266
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:13,511
levels are,
are not healthy or their norepinephrine 

1267
01:01:13,511 --> 01:01:14,000
levels are not healthy or whatever the 
fuck.

1268
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:19,330
But I think the,
the common view of depression now is 

1269
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:22,931
that there's some sort of biological 
difference in your brain and oftentimes 

1270
01:01:22,931 --> 01:01:27,611
that's either caused or it develops out 
of childhood or early life experiences 

1271
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:36,070
where you know you have some sort of 
trauma or you have some sort of 

1272
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,460
development.
You have some sort of,

1273
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,990
you know,
interaction with famiLy,

1274
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:40,880
whatever the case may be.
And it doesn't have to be,

1275
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,560
you know,
you were molested as a child.

1276
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:47,590
It can literally just be like you didn't
feel loved or whatever the case may be.

1277
01:01:48,801 --> 01:01:53,801
And you've got this brain difference 
combined with this emotional experience 

1278
01:01:56,961 --> 01:01:58,790
and what ends up happening.
Because when you're very young,

1279
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:00,140
you're brain is very plastic.

1280
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:05,170
So when you're very young,
you're learning skills that are gonna 

1281
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:07,870
last you the rest of your life and 
you're actually building your brain 

1282
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:10,391
architecture.
Certain neurons are connecting and 

1283
01:02:10,391 --> 01:02:10,820
disconnecting and reconnecting and 
pruning out the tree.

1284
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:15,821
The beautiful tree that is all of the 
cells in your brain is getting pruned 

1285
01:02:15,821 --> 01:02:19,300
when you're young and if you're 
depressed when you're young and you're 

1286
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:19,300
experiencing those kinds of things,
when you're,

1287
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:24,500
you're going to prune a tree that's 
prone to depression as you age because 

1288
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,820
you're going to keep reinforcing those 
neuronal connections.

1289
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:32,180
That's why therapy is so important.
Meds in and of themselves are never 

1290
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:35,700
going to get you in a place where your 
depression is really well managed.

1291
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:40,910
It's going to get you in a place where 
therapy is going to be working better 

1292
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:44,901
for you.
Meds are going to be an immediate and 

1293
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:47,900
necessary interventional strategy so 
that you're not crying or you're not 

1294
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,260
trying to kill yourself or you're not.

1295
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,260
Whatever your symptoms so you can 
actually fucking get out of bed to work 

1296
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,220
on yourself.
That's what meds are there for me.

1297
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,770
Meds keep me from staying in bed all 
day.

1298
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:03,970
That's not variable though.
Finding the right counselor has got to 

1299
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:03,970
be incredibly difficult.
It's tough.

1300
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:06,540
It's like I always liken it to the women
who are listening to the podcast.

1301
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:09,840
I liken it unto you when you were first 
deciding to go on birth control.

1302
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:15,380
a lot of women will go to their 
gynecologist when they're 15,

1303
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,590
16,
17 and say,

1304
01:03:16,591 --> 01:03:21,591
I want to go on birth control and 
they'll give them ortho try cycling or 

1305
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:21,591
whatever the pill,
the regular old pill,

1306
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:25,911
and they'll be fine.
A lot of women will take the pill the 

1307
01:03:25,911 --> 01:03:25,911
first time and it will make them really 
sick.

1308
01:03:25,911 --> 01:03:30,530
Like every time they take the pill it 
makes them want to throw up or it gives 

1309
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:30,700
them cramps or something's weird about 
it.

1310
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,010
It affects others and they go,
oh,

1311
01:03:32,011 --> 01:03:33,570
this drug doesn't work for me and go,
oh fuck,

1312
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:38,571
okay,
let's try one with lower levels of 

1313
01:03:38,571 --> 01:03:40,191
estrogen or progesterone,
or let's try the ring or the depo 

1314
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:40,230
provera shot,
or maybe you need an iud.

1315
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:46,190
I was like that.
It took me multiple times to find the 

1316
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:46,190
right drug and I think it's the same 
thing with therapy.

1317
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,190
I think it's the same thing with 
psychiatric medicines.

1318
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:49,200
It's not,
we're not monolithic,

1319
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:54,201
so the same combination isn't going to 
work for everybody and the truth is if 

1320
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:56,730
that makes you afraid of modern medicine
or if it makes you think that psychiatry

1321
01:03:56,731 --> 01:04:01,731
is woo or something like that,
it's the same thing as cancer in many 

1322
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:04,680
ways.
There's so many parallels.

1323
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:07,830
Cancer is not one disease.
It's a spectrum of diseases.

1324
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:12,300
If I got diagnosed with breast cancer 
and you got diagnosed with breast cancer

1325
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:15,270
and we both went in with our diagnosis 
the same day,

1326
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:20,300
our oncologists would give us different 
treatments because we would have 

1327
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:20,300
different genetic markers.

1328
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,380
We would respond differently to 
different types of chemotherapy.

1329
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:27,590
Chemotherapy means chemical therapy.
It's a really big umbrella term for all 

1330
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:30,000
the different kinds of cancer treatments
that are available.

1331
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,930
Maybe you would get more radiation.
Maybe I would need surgery,

1332
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:37,680
but your metastasis would make it so 
that surgery wasn't a viable option.

1333
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:42,710
It's it's a spectrum.
Disease and psychiatric illness or the 

1334
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:43,150
same way.
The variable though,

1335
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,870
the counselor has to be kind of weird.
It is weird.

1336
01:04:45,871 --> 01:04:50,871
It's weird.
Find someone that you can confide in 

1337
01:04:50,871 --> 01:04:53,570
wholeheartedly and it takes time a 
really long time finding the correct 

1338
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:53,570
sex,
right.

1339
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:56,280
Whether or not some men will do better 
with women counselors.

1340
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:59,670
I have a male counselor.
I'm like,

1341
01:04:59,671 --> 01:05:00,660
I would never.
It's funny,

1342
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:04,230
I have a male therapist,
but I have a female gynecologists like I

1343
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:08,030
would never in a million years let a 
dude like put speculums and may and like

1344
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:13,040
dig around in my cervix,
but I'm totally comfortable with a male 

1345
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,510
therapist.
I have a friend who went through a male 

1346
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:17,510
gynecologist and the gynecologist texted
her,

1347
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:18,380
asked her out.
Oh

1348
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:24,350
my gosh.
She's kind of a flirt.

1349
01:05:24,351 --> 01:05:26,480
She might've put it out there.
It's crazy.

1350
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:27,500
There.
Reminds me of what's the,

1351
01:05:27,501 --> 01:05:28,710
um,
jet appetite.

1352
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:32,350
What's the jed apatow movie while he was
getting in there?

1353
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:36,620
Whenever you have obviously never had a 
path you would never know.

1354
01:05:36,621 --> 01:05:39,410
I haven't,
but some girls are dirty bitches.

1355
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:43,090
But what's the judd apatow movie with?
Um,

1356
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,810
uh,
knocked up,

1357
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:45,650
you know,
and,

1358
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:48,830
and she goes to the doctor and it's her 
sister's doctor and he's all like,

1359
01:05:48,831 --> 01:05:50,360
oh,
I recognize your now.

1360
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:52,570
Like putting puts her in this.
It's like so good.

1361
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:57,620
I couldn't do dig around your cooter.
I could never.

1362
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,460
I just could never.
I'm glad that I live.

1363
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,020
I'm glad it's 2014 and there are plenty 
of female.

1364
01:06:03,021 --> 01:06:06,170
Ob gyn is available because back in the 
day you had a male guide.

1365
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:06,230
Yeah,

1366
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,910
because they were only do doctors.
Whoa.

1367
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:10,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1368
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:15,750
That would be really weird for a guy to 
have a woman doctor that's checking out 

1369
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:17,560
your genitals.
So would be odd as well.

1370
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,010
Would you have a female doctor before?
Right?

1371
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,130
Like grab your balls while you cough 
that.

1372
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,050
Yeah,
but that's the issue.

1373
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:29,020
Like the man would be the predator like 
that the doctor,

1374
01:06:29,021 --> 01:06:30,640
the female doctor would have to deal 
with,

1375
01:06:30,641 --> 01:06:35,641
especially if it's an attractive female 
doctor would have to deal with the dude 

1376
01:06:35,641 --> 01:06:37,060
being kind of excited about a woman 
checking out his balls.

1377
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:38,470
I'm not sure.
Keep doing it.

1378
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,100
She found it.
Yeah.

1379
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:43,600
That she'd probably have to deal with 
that a bit for fucking sure.

1380
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:44,650
Well,
there's um,

1381
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:46,690
you know,
I was talking to a friend of mount this,

1382
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:48,250
uh,
the other day and he,

1383
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:49,750
uh,
is pretty philosophical,

1384
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:54,751
older guy and he was um,
he's been through two divorces and he 

1385
01:06:54,751 --> 01:06:57,670
was talking about how sex starved so 
many people are like,

1386
01:06:57,671 --> 01:06:59,950
you're dealing with all these scenarios 
where you're like,

1387
01:06:59,951 --> 01:07:01,650
oh,
this guy was a creep and this,

1388
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:06,651
you know,
this woman is ridiculous and there are 

1389
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:09,301
people out there that no one's touching 
and they are so hungry just to be held.

1390
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:15,700
and I mean this is a minor story,
but when I was a,

1391
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:18,070
when I first came to California,
I didn't have any friends,

1392
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,020
came here from New York and I wasn't 
happy.

1393
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,840
I wasn't happy because I didn't enjoy 
acting.

1394
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:26,740
I didn't enjoy being around actors and I
didn't have any friends and it wasn't,

1395
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:28,720
didn't have a girlfriend,
didn't have any dates.

1396
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:33,780
And I,
I got a hug from this girl in a set and 

1397
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:37,540
I'll never forget that feeling of that 
hug because it wasn't like a sexual hug.

1398
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:42,510
It was a friend gave me a hug and when 
she gave me the hug it was like my,

1399
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:47,230
my level One but not sexual.
It was like love.

1400
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:48,870
Like I got,
I got touched you.

1401
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:52,570
Gotta love boner.
I got touched for the first time in like

1402
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,190
a couple weeks and I was like,
oh,

1403
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:56,800
you need thIs.
Like this is important for people.

1404
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:01,940
It's totally important for people.
There's all sorts of hormones like a 

1405
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:05,361
cascade of hormones that you set off 
when you are affiliative when you're,

1406
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:10,970
you know,
close to somebody else and it's 

1407
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:14,420
absolutely necessary.
And kind of going back to what we were 

1408
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,440
talking about about aggression,
like a male female difference.

1409
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:21,160
I also feel strongly that many men have 
a deep need that slightly different than

1410
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:29,260
than women that our sexual needs are 
much more affiliative and emotional and 

1411
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:34,340
there is some physiological basis for 
female sexual need.

1412
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:39,341
Don't get me wrong,
like any girl can tell you that she's 

1413
01:08:39,341 --> 01:08:40,180
had this craving,
this,

1414
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:41,870
this passionate feeling where she's 
like,

1415
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:46,160
I just need to come or adjust,
need to have sex with somebody.

1416
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:50,360
But with men,
there's literally a backup of fluid that

1417
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:55,361
you have to release.
That's a very different physiological 

1418
01:08:55,361 --> 01:08:58,481
thing than women.
And again that goes back to 

1419
01:08:58,481 --> 01:08:58,481
testosterone.
So the same thing as you were saying,

1420
01:08:58,481 --> 01:09:02,840
mma can be really helpful for clearing 
the mind and for lowering your.

1421
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:06,920
Your base levels of aggression.
I think coming does the same thing.

1422
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:11,921
I think it's healthy for guys to jerk 
off if they're not having a lot of sex 

1423
01:09:11,921 --> 01:09:15,370
because guys can get pent up and be 
aggressive because they're not coming up

1424
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:15,980
well.
They're also.

1425
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:17,920
You're desperate to.
Yeah.

1426
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:22,990
I had a joke about it was.
It was a whole descriptive called jerk 

1427
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:23,430
off first.
Then think about it like anything you're

1428
01:09:23,431 --> 01:09:25,830
thinking about doing in live.
Any weird decision you're gonna make.

1429
01:09:25,831 --> 01:09:27,450
You're getting married.
That's good.

1430
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:29,590
Jerk off first.
Then think about,

1431
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,380
you know you're going to decide to do 
this,

1432
01:09:31,381 --> 01:09:33,510
you're going to buy that car.
Are you going to do this?

1433
01:09:33,511 --> 01:09:35,760
You're going to buy those clothes.
Jerk off first.

1434
01:09:35,761 --> 01:09:37,620
And tell me if you really want to wear 
alligator shoes,

1435
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,690
what are you?
Why are you wearing those?

1436
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,680
So you're trying to attract a certain 
person like

1437
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,600
about the little head and people guys 
thinking with that head or whatever.

1438
01:09:45,601 --> 01:09:48,900
There is a really big neurono link 
there.

1439
01:09:48,901 --> 01:09:53,901
There are hormones that affect your dick
the same way they affect your brain.

1440
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:59,810
And so you can't pretend again that your
cock is somehow completely disconnected 

1441
01:10:00,511 --> 01:10:02,760
from your emotions,
from your feelings.

1442
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:03,580
Well,
if you at it,

1443
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,950
and also if you looked at it 
objectively,

1444
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:10,450
if you looked at the human beings on 
this planet as like a giant mathematical

1445
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:11,470
equation,
you would say,

1446
01:10:11,471 --> 01:10:13,330
okay,
why are there so fucking many of them?

1447
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:18,630
Well,
because there's this intense need to 

1448
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:20,551
breed and this intense need to breed was
back when it was really difficult to 

1449
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:20,551
stay alive.
You know,

1450
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:25,430
we are essentially the same organism 
that used to get cut down by each other 

1451
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,920
by animals,
predators,

1452
01:10:26,921 --> 01:10:29,350
natural illnesses,
disease injuries.

1453
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:31,730
We've only been around for 200,000
years in our,

1454
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,520
in our current form,
homo sapiens as a species.

1455
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:36,200
So before 200,000
years ago,

1456
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,600
we're talking about something that was 
different enough from us,

1457
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:41,780
evolutionarily speaking,
to be a different species.

1458
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:43,580
Homo sapiens,
200,000

1459
01:10:43,581 --> 01:10:48,581
years old,
that's long enough for a little bit of 

1460
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:48,581
evolution.
Yes,

1461
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:49,430
we are.
We have changed in some ways,

1462
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:54,560
but that's not long enough for that much
evolution in many ways.

1463
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:56,780
Biologically,
psychologically,

1464
01:10:56,781 --> 01:10:58,850
evolutionarily speaking.
You're right.

1465
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:02,600
We are the same organism.
That was like crawling out of the trees.

1466
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:03,820
Yeah,
extremely primitive.

1467
01:11:03,821 --> 01:11:08,821
And again,
when you also talk about the 

1468
01:11:08,821 --> 01:11:10,690
biodiversity,
there's some folks that are just more 

1469
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:13,171
fucking primitive today,
more animalistic or more kinetic and 

1470
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,160
just

1471
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:19,160
the range is so massive when we talk 
about what is quote normal and what is 

1472
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:25,191
hyper and hypo.
So many people are so different and 

1473
01:11:25,191 --> 01:11:29,841
that's why it's cool to see when people 
actually manage to partner up or 

1474
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:35,910
whatever sexual or emotional 
partnerships make sense for them,

1475
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:38,580
whether they're monogamous or 
polygamous,

1476
01:11:38,581 --> 01:11:40,920
whether they're um,
you know,

1477
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,060
gay,
straight,

1478
01:11:42,061 --> 01:11:47,061
somewhere in between.
It's so cool when you see people that 

1479
01:11:47,061 --> 01:11:50,181
make it work because they're on the same
page when there are so many differences 

1480
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:52,200
that exist out there.
When two people go,

1481
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,240
you're awesome,
or three or four,

1482
01:11:54,241 --> 01:11:55,020
whatever.
And they go,

1483
01:11:55,021 --> 01:11:56,350
you're awesome.
I'm into.

1484
01:11:56,370 --> 01:12:00,060
You were into the same stuff.
We abide by the same rules.

1485
01:12:00,061 --> 01:12:05,061
We have the same sexual proclivities and
it works like how fucking cool is that 

1486
01:12:05,061 --> 01:12:08,000
because there's so many combinations out
there.

1487
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:13,100
When those magnet,
those two ends of the magnet kind of 

1488
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:13,100
find each other in that way,
it's.

1489
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,600
It's pretty dope.
Like it's not that common.

1490
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,840
Well,
even like when you were talking earlier 

1491
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,551
about molecules and receptors,
it's almost like you have to have the 

1492
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:22,551
right fit.
Yeah,

1493
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:25,410
you totally do.
You also have to be a good molecule.

1494
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:31,060
It's like how many people truly have 
their shit together to the point where 

1495
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:34,281
anybody would want to be with them and 
so many people are so god damn 

1496
01:12:34,281 --> 01:12:36,831
codependent and so fucked up.
Then they laid can attract anyone 

1497
01:12:36,831 --> 01:12:38,430
because their own biology,
their psychology though,

1498
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:43,500
the mix that makes them a person,
it's just so chaotic that you can't 

1499
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,240
expect to be happy in a relationship 
because you're not happy alone.

1500
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:50,270
Yeah.
There has to be equity in a 

1501
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:50,270
relationship,
like you can't suck the light.

1502
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:50,490
You can't be like a vampire and a 
relationship.

1503
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:54,330
You have to offer somebody just as much 
as you get from them and you have to be,

1504
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:56,020
like you said,
very standalone.

1505
01:12:56,070 --> 01:13:01,070
I mean that's a common theme for me in 
therapy is this conversation about if I 

1506
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:07,041
am in a relationship,
feeling very confident and comfortable 

1507
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:08,220
because I have like an insane fear of 
commitment.

1508
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:13,580
I because I'm so used to thinking about 
our relationship as if it's a I'm a 

1509
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:18,891
prison sentence and I've been really 
relearning what it means to be in a 

1510
01:13:18,891 --> 01:13:23,631
relationship with my therapist and how 
the idea of living for now is a 

1511
01:13:26,161 --> 01:13:31,161
healthier way to look at life.
Like I don't have to think about 

1512
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:35,360
hardcore future kinds of conversations.
Like if I'm comfortable with myself 

1513
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:40,221
right now and I can be comfortable with 
a partner right now and not have all 

1514
01:13:40,891 --> 01:13:45,891
this like sense of intense obligation.
That's where that codependent stuff 

1515
01:13:45,891 --> 01:13:50,070
comes from and that's what I think is so
incredibly unhealthy in a relationship.

1516
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:55,520
It's like I'm going to bring my best 
self to the table and hopefully I'll 

1517
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,980
find a partner that does the same thing 
instead of needing a partner,

1518
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,670
which is a common motivation for people 
to get in relationships.

1519
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:04,860
I need somebody else.
I can't handle it on my own.

1520
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:07,290
Well then you're not going to end up 
working it out.

1521
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:10,650
There's all those variables to like the 
sexual variable,

1522
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:12,130
the emotional variable.

1523
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:15,520
There's so many different things that 
are going on and then it's almost like,

1524
01:14:15,521 --> 01:14:17,050
okay,
I found this waterhole.

1525
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,690
I can't leave.
I finally found water.

1526
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:24,691
I was alone like my experience of going 
several weeks without being hugged and 

1527
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:26,330
then being hugged and like,
oh,

1528
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,840
and that was just a friend.
It was someone on the set.

1529
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:34,020
The difference between that and someone 
who's gone years without a relationship 

1530
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,461
that really worked and you finally have 
one that works and you fuck it up 

1531
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:38,500
[inaudible] you too.
God damn clingy and too crazy.

1532
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,880
Where are you?
Where are you?

1533
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:41,140
Why aren't you home?
I'm texting you,

1534
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:42,520
why aren't you texting me back 
immediately?

1535
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:45,460
That kind of shit is what makes me run 
out the door.

1536
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:50,710
That's what I'm talking about when I 
talk about my quote unquote fear of 

1537
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:53,371
commitment.
What it really is is it's an intense 

1538
01:14:53,371 --> 01:14:56,260
feeling of stress when I feel obligated 
to somebody else,

1539
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:01,440
so,
so in the healthiest relationships I've 

1540
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,711
been in there,
the relationships where there's not a 

1541
01:15:04,711 --> 01:15:05,650
lot of jealousy,
not a lot of possession,

1542
01:15:05,651 --> 01:15:08,650
not a lot of that checking in and it's 
just trust.

1543
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:11,290
You trust each other and when you're 
really into somebody,

1544
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:13,810
you want to be around them and you spend
time with them,

1545
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:15,250
but when you want to be around your 
friends,

1546
01:15:15,251 --> 01:15:16,330
they're not like,
where are you?

1547
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:17,890
Why aren't you checking in?
When are you coming home?

1548
01:15:17,891 --> 01:15:19,180
It's like,
fuck off dude.

1549
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,430
Like I don't want to be with you.
If it's going to be like this,

1550
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:24,310
there are friends like that and they're 
brutal and you got to cut them off.

1551
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:25,500
Yeah,
you do because that's.

1552
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:30,540
That's that codependency and what 
happens when you end up with two people 

1553
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:33,301
were like that with each other and they 
less and less learn how to exist on 

1554
01:15:33,301 --> 01:15:38,221
their own,
so then when they finally do break it 

1555
01:15:38,221 --> 01:15:38,620
off because it's obviously unhealthy,
then they're fucked.

1556
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:43,750
Then it takes all this healing to get 
back to a place where they're 

1557
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:43,750
independent again.

1558
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,230
Yeah.
That's so true.

1559
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:49,231
And iT's.
It's a weird thing when you find those 

1560
01:15:49,231 --> 01:15:49,320
two people that like,
they can't be a part.

1561
01:15:49,321 --> 01:15:51,790
Like they literally,
they don't go everywhere together.

1562
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:55,240
They roast like nobody wants to be 
around them.

1563
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:58,240
They're the worst friends like that,
don't you?

1564
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:00,850
I cut off all my friends.
oh,

1565
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:03,610
you have no friend.
I'm your friend.

1566
01:16:03,611 --> 01:16:05,100
fuck face.
What are you talking about?

1567
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,890
I mean all my shit friends.
Oh,

1568
01:16:06,891 --> 01:16:07,840
you're shit for it.
That's good.

1569
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:10,720
cutting off shit.
Friends is just.

1570
01:16:10,721 --> 01:16:14,620
Me and my girl were out there riding 
motorcycles.

1571
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,600
Well,
I think the older you get,

1572
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:18,790
you just realized why my friends with 
these people.

1573
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,410
That happens to.
That's true.

1574
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:25,470
When you're younger you need a lot of 
support and I think the older you get 

1575
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:29,221
the more you value your alone time and 
the more you realize that good 

1576
01:16:29,221 --> 01:16:33,421
relationships and good friendship 
shouldn't feel like work and once they 

1577
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:33,910
start to feel like work you're like,
fuck,

1578
01:16:33,911 --> 01:16:35,700
I have too many obligations and 
responsibilities.

1579
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,780
I don't want to have to work to be 
friends with you.

1580
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:41,020
Also I have a lot of friends that are 
like super empowering.

1581
01:16:41,021 --> 01:16:43,390
Like when I'm around them I want to do 
better.

1582
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:46,000
I want to be better.
I get stimulated,

1583
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:51,020
you know,
I think better my mind functioning like 

1584
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:52,390
I'm inspired.
I'm very lucky to have that.

1585
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,500
Now.
You know,

1586
01:16:53,501 --> 01:16:58,501
you were talking about your experience 
when you first came to los angeles and 

1587
01:16:58,501 --> 01:17:01,680
not having a lot of friends and kind of 
being depressed and so when I first 

1588
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,720
moved to la I was in New York.
I'm usually not that comfortable talking

1589
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:09,721
about this,
but for some reason I'm going through 

1590
01:17:09,721 --> 01:17:11,011
right now.
I was living in New York and I was 

1591
01:17:11,011 --> 01:17:11,011
working on my phd and then I started 
dating

1592
01:17:11,011 --> 01:17:13,550
bill maher.
Like that's why I came to los angeles is

1593
01:17:13,551 --> 01:17:17,240
because we started dating,
I was living in New York.

1594
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:21,080
I would kind of come and go and see him 
and we weren't committed to each other.

1595
01:17:21,081 --> 01:17:23,180
I had a life on the west or on the east 
coast.

1596
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:28,420
He had his life here on the west coast 
and eventually we got close enough that 

1597
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:28,420
we decided,
hey,

1598
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:29,360
let's give this thing a go.
And so I was like,

1599
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:34,361
fuck it.
I was actually really not happy in my 

1600
01:17:34,361 --> 01:17:34,970
degree program.
so in some ways it was a double whammy.

1601
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:39,971
I was very happy to be exploring a 
deeper relationship with this guy that 

1602
01:17:39,971 --> 01:17:43,631
I'd grown to love and also I was more 
and more not happy with my situation in 

1603
01:17:44,391 --> 01:17:46,670
New York and so it was a new 
opportunity.

1604
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:51,970
I moved out to la and we ultimately 
ended up dating very seriously for about

1605
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:57,011
three years and that was my,
my first la experience was bizarre as 

1606
01:17:58,221 --> 01:17:58,550
fuck.

1607
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:03,550
I was dating somebody who was incredibly
famous in the public eye who had a lot 

1608
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:06,911
of money.
There was a big equity problem in the 

1609
01:18:06,911 --> 01:18:10,091
relationship.
I didn't know what I was going to do 

1610
01:18:10,091 --> 01:18:10,091
with my life.
I had just left my degree program.

1611
01:18:10,091 --> 01:18:11,720
I was searching for answers and I was 
young.

1612
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,030
I was 24,
um,

1613
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,780
but I had no friends,
none.

1614
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,960
I mean I was friends with people in 
their fifties,

1615
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:23,900
like that's,
that was my social circle and yeah,

1616
01:18:23,901 --> 01:18:26,130
I would meet people like I would hang 
out with sarah silverman,

1617
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:28,010
a little bitter,
but they weren't really my friends.

1618
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:33,011
I was the come along.
I was the girlfriend and there were all 

1619
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:33,020
very nice to me and I was like,
what a weird life,

1620
01:18:33,021 --> 01:18:38,021
but it was almost like I was living 
somebody else's life and I was pretty 

1621
01:18:38,021 --> 01:18:40,640
depressed and I was very lucky to have 
my best friend at the time,

1622
01:18:40,641 --> 01:18:45,641
kelly was still living in dallas where I
grew up and I'm kind of worked with her 

1623
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:47,750
and hooked her up with a job.

1624
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:52,750
Working with bill.
She ended up becoming his wardrobe 

1625
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:52,750
stylist and she still does that to this 
day,

1626
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,160
which is really amazing.
It was a huge opportunity for her.

1627
01:18:55,161 --> 01:18:56,900
She always wanted to come to la.
So.

1628
01:18:56,930 --> 01:19:00,770
And now she's this incredible celebrity 
stylist and has this great job.

1629
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:01,970
And,
and um,

1630
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:07,030
so I was very lucky when she first came 
out maybe six months later because we 

1631
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,070
got an apartment together and I finally 
had somebody,

1632
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:12,020
but I just had her and it took probably 
until just a couple of years ago.

1633
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:17,021
So now that's maybe been five years out 
before I met this group of friends that 

1634
01:19:17,021 --> 01:19:19,220
we affectionately call each other.
The nerd brigade.

1635
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:24,650
Yeah.
We hashtag nerd brigade on twitter all 

1636
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:26,420
the time and they're like,
one of my best friends just finished her

1637
01:19:26,421 --> 01:19:28,670
phd in molecular neuroscience from 
caltech.

1638
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:33,020
One of my other best friends got his phd
from usc in animal cognition.

1639
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:37,240
I have a friend who,
another neuroscience student at caltech.

1640
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,690
I have a friend who,
um,

1641
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:42,740
has a marine biology degree.
they're all like science communicators,

1642
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:45,140
writers,
academics,

1643
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,150
but cool young,
edgy,

1644
01:19:47,151 --> 01:19:50,180
fun people who like,
we get each other,

1645
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:53,840
we're friends because we have a lot in 
common.

1646
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,080
It took a long time to get close to 
these people and to meet them and to 

1647
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,520
finally.
Because la is a fucking hard city.

1648
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:05,910
If you're used to living in a university
town like there,

1649
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:09,390
it's so hard to you in.
Well first I was in denton,

1650
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:14,391
Texas.
That's where I did my undergrad and my 

1651
01:20:14,391 --> 01:20:14,391
master's at the university of north 
Texas.

1652
01:20:14,391 --> 01:20:17,840
And then yeah,
I was in New York city but I was living 

1653
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:18,660
in queens specifically in forest hills 
because I would take the bus to flushing

1654
01:20:18,661 --> 01:20:21,810
every day to um,
to queens college.

1655
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,930
That's where I was working on mY phd at 
the city,

1656
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:26,400
university of New York graduate center.

1657
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,090
But queens college was my campus.
And um,

1658
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,500
a lot of my friends live in pasedena 
still,

1659
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:33,920
which is very much a college town 
because their cow,

1660
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:36,540
they were caltech students and now 
they're working there or,

1661
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:37,860
or some of them are still taking 
courses.

1662
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:42,861
But I saw,
I mean brian just shook his head like 

1663
01:20:42,861 --> 01:20:45,950
la,
it's hard to meet smart people in this 

1664
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:46,290
city.
It's so full of fucking vapid people and

1665
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:48,900
people who will.
I learned this quickly.

1666
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:54,290
I moved to la dating somebody who was 
like an a list celebrity and all of a 

1667
01:20:55,231 --> 01:20:56,760
sudden I was like,
wait,

1668
01:20:56,761 --> 01:20:58,890
why do you want to be friends with me?
Wait,

1669
01:20:58,891 --> 01:21:02,400
what's going on?
I also date I dated another very,

1670
01:21:02,401 --> 01:21:04,670
very famous person in my life where I 
don't,

1671
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:07,770
I don't publicly talk about that 
relationship at all just to respect each

1672
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:10,740
other's privacy.
But I wouLd learn things about people.

1673
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:14,550
Like I had this one group of friends who
I thought were my friends,

1674
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,840
um,
and I remember dating this person and 

1675
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:19,840
being like,
hey,

1676
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,520
do you want to come to a barbecue?
I don't know.

1677
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:21,390
Oh,
but you know,

1678
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:23,100
so and so thought that you might want to
play tennis.

1679
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:24,900
We're going to do it at so and so's 
house.

1680
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:25,860
Oh,
so and so we'll be there.

1681
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:26,940
Oh yeah.
I'm totally down.

1682
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,440
And you would get that all the time.
This like,

1683
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:32,040
oh,
is that why you're friends with me?

1684
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,120
Thing is very bizarre.
It's such a weird experience that I 

1685
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,000
think a lot of people don't.
I never even imagined.

1686
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,010
But it also has opened a million doors 
for me.

1687
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:43,890
Like how the fuck you think when I was 
23 years old,

1688
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:48,920
you know,
cutting up mice or birds and digging 

1689
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:49,020
around in their brains.
See,

1690
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:54,290
I always thought I was going to be a 
bench scientist and that's what I was 

1691
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:54,990
going to do and I kind of hated it.

1692
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:57,840
I loved teaching,
kind of hated doing the lab work,

1693
01:21:57,841 --> 01:21:58,470
but I was like,
okay,

1694
01:21:58,471 --> 01:22:01,590
this is the path I'm on and this is who 
the fuck.

1695
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:02,700
If somebody had told me,
oh,

1696
01:22:02,701 --> 01:22:07,701
you're going to be in media,
you're going to be on the joe rogan 

1697
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:07,701
podcast,
you're going to start your own podcast.

1698
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:09,030
You're going to be on television.
I'd be like,

1699
01:22:09,031 --> 01:22:10,950
you're fucking out of your mind.
Like I'm scared of camp.

1700
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:16,610
When I was in Texas at 16,
I tried out for season two of american 

1701
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:17,770
idol.
You sing?

1702
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,490
Yeah.
I was a jazz singer and qa.

1703
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:25,380
Yeah.
And so I made it through for callbacks 

1704
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:26,280
and season two american idol.
I made it through the producers,

1705
01:22:26,281 --> 01:22:27,590
the executive producers more.
ExActly.

1706
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:30,180
I finally got to the three judges.
Who were they?

1707
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:35,410
The main ones?
It was like randy and paula and simon 

1708
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:35,410
cow.
And um,

1709
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:38,170
so that was the last audition you do 
before you have the book.

1710
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,510
Right.
And you know why I didn't get it.

1711
01:22:39,511 --> 01:22:41,400
All three of them said like,
you're not,

1712
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,630
they go,
we'd like your voice.

1713
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,940
We like your look because I was a total 
punk rock kid.

1714
01:22:44,941 --> 01:22:49,290
I had short spiky hair and my lip ring 
and the arm is very avril levine,

1715
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:51,240
kind of a look back then.
And they were like,

1716
01:22:51,241 --> 01:22:52,400
oh,
we love it all your,

1717
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,060
you're the total package.
And I was like,

1718
01:22:54,061 --> 01:22:59,061
great.
And then I auditioned and they were 

1719
01:22:59,061 --> 01:22:59,061
like,
you're not going through.

1720
01:22:59,061 --> 01:22:59,070
No,
but why?

1721
01:22:59,071 --> 01:23:00,810
And they were like,
you are not tv ready.

1722
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:05,870
I was so afraid of the cameras.
I like didn't have that dynamic 

1723
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:07,240
personality that all of the reality tv 
stars have where they're like,

1724
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:10,180
I'm going to win this competition 
because I'm the best.

1725
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:15,450
I just walked up and I was like,
are you ready for me to say I'm so 

1726
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:15,450
scared?

1727
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:16,390
Like it was I,
I was weak.

1728
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:21,391
I didn't have that,
that kind of self assertive thing going 

1729
01:23:21,461 --> 01:23:23,350
on to develop that.
I think I did.

1730
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:25,120
I think it happened from getting thrown 
into it.

1731
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,700
I think what happens is when you're 
like,

1732
01:23:27,701 --> 01:23:28,630
okay,
I'm just working.

1733
01:23:28,631 --> 01:23:33,631
I met him in the lab also.
I taught between then and now I've 

1734
01:23:33,631 --> 01:23:37,411
taught like a million courses so that 
helps you stand up in front of a 

1735
01:23:37,411 --> 01:23:37,780
classroom and you go,
you don't understand glycolysis,

1736
01:23:37,781 --> 01:23:42,781
we're going to figure this out together,
up on the whiteboard and you're helping 

1737
01:23:42,781 --> 01:23:45,241
the students.
So that helps with your confidence for 

1738
01:23:45,241 --> 01:23:45,241
sure.
But also I think getting thrown into it.

1739
01:23:45,241 --> 01:23:46,390
I come to la and it's like,
oh,

1740
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:49,090
let's go to the emmys.
Let's walk this red carpet,

1741
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:50,620
let's do all.
And then you know,

1742
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,800
you're all the sudden in the room with 
all these really important people and 

1743
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:55,810
you don't even know who they are.

1744
01:23:56,050 --> 01:24:01,050
Like I would go to parties where every 
single person there was a celebrity and 

1745
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:04,921
the people you didn't recognize,
you didn't recognize because they owned 

1746
01:24:04,921 --> 01:24:07,291
movie studios.
Like it's the weirdest feeling and then 

1747
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:10,120
once you realize I'm not that different 
from these people,

1748
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:15,180
I can have a conversation with them like
anyone else and I would talk about 

1749
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:15,180
science,
I'd be like,

1750
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,180
science is awesome.
Let me tell you this story.

1751
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:16,630
And they'd go,
oh,

1752
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:19,150
that's kInd of interesting.
And then eventually bill was like,

1753
01:24:19,151 --> 01:24:24,151
you need to be doing this on television,
you need to be trying this at least 

1754
01:24:24,151 --> 01:24:27,580
because I think you'd be good at it.
He completely and utterly pushed me into

1755
01:24:27,581 --> 01:24:32,581
this and I thank him everyday for it 
because I never would have done it 

1756
01:24:32,581 --> 01:24:33,280
without his help.
When the depression started when I was a

1757
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:38,281
child.
So you were dealing with it your whole 

1758
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:38,281
lot?

1759
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:38,281
My whole life.
Oh completely.

1760
01:24:38,281 --> 01:24:42,630
Some of those years,
like when I was dating bill or when I 

1761
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:45,151
would be moving,
those were some of the worst years 

1762
01:24:45,151 --> 01:24:47,430
because it was so stressful because he 
didn't have friends because I was 

1763
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:47,430
unmedicated unmedicated then.
Yeah.

1764
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:49,510
I didn't start taking medication until 
about three years ago.

1765
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,620
About 27.
Did you try other methods to try?

1766
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:58,330
I tried some things and I,
I've been in therapy my whole life.

1767
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:03,360
My parents first put me in therapy when 
they first started to decide that they 

1768
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,480
were thinking about getting a divorce 
and I was a young man.

1769
01:25:04,481 --> 01:25:09,481
I was maybe six or seven,
so from the time I remember I've 

1770
01:25:09,481 --> 01:25:11,650
understood the therapeutic process and 
they always really promoted that in me.

1771
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:14,710
so then even after the divorce and the 
re marriages and all of that,

1772
01:25:14,711 --> 01:25:16,150
I started doing the,
the,

1773
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:18,070
the therapy thing on my own.

1774
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,320
Then when I went to college and I was 
very much on my own,

1775
01:25:20,321 --> 01:25:21,730
I went to college when I was 16,
by the way.

1776
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:24,020
I've lived on my own at 60.
I was fucking weird kid.

1777
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,270
Yeah,
so I was a little.

1778
01:25:25,271 --> 01:25:26,530
I'm an adult,
but I wasn't.

1779
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:27,850
I did that.
I went to therapy.

1780
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:30,700
I did all those things by myself,
but I always had this mental block.

1781
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,620
I always had this like,
oh,

1782
01:25:32,621 --> 01:25:35,830
I don't need meds.
meds means you're really crazy.

1783
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:41,100
Meds means you really don't have control
and not until I kind of hit a very bad 

1784
01:25:41,981 --> 01:25:45,760
rock bottom a few,
maybe three years ago did I finally say,

1785
01:25:45,761 --> 01:25:46,570
you know what?
Fuck it.

1786
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:49,540
I've,
I think I actUally have to do this.

1787
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,990
I think it would be good for me.
And then it was the same experience that

1788
01:25:52,991 --> 01:25:56,770
I've heard over and over and over from 
people were finally they get on the meds

1789
01:25:56,771 --> 01:26:01,771
that are right for them and they 
calibrate to their dosage and maybe 

1790
01:26:01,771 --> 01:26:05,100
they've been on it for about two months 
and they just have this epiphany of 

1791
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:05,270
like,
why the fuck did I wait so long?

1792
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,460
I could have felt like this my whole 
life.

1793
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:12,950
What the fuck was I thinking?
Because you're so societaly,

1794
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:17,930
we're so resistant to looking at mental 
illness the same way we look at physical

1795
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:20,630
illness where,
so it's so easy.

1796
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,960
Uh,
paul gil martin just made this point 

1797
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,581
when he was on my podcast last week.
If you went up to somebody with diabetes

1798
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:30,590
type one diabetes and you were like,
what the fuck dude,

1799
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:35,480
why don't you just think more positively
so that your pancreas makes insulin?

1800
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,830
Like what?
What's wrong with you?

1801
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:40,310
Why can't you just make more insulin?
It's like they'd be like,

1802
01:26:40,311 --> 01:26:43,460
what are you talking about?
It's the same thing with depression.

1803
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:48,700
People put the onus on you like they,
they look at it like it's a disease of 

1804
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:49,550
will,
but it's not.

1805
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:54,640
It's a,
it's a biological illness and that's 

1806
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:57,260
just very hard for people to understand 
and so what you end up doing is carrying

1807
01:26:57,261 --> 01:26:59,630
around a lot of guilt and shame and a 
lot of feelings like,

1808
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:04,631
I'm not good enough.
I can't will myself out of this if I 

1809
01:27:04,631 --> 01:27:04,640
just think more positively.
It's not about that,

1810
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:07,220
and I did that for years,
years.

1811
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:11,030
You just deal with it and I destroyed so
many relationships.

1812
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,080
Wow.
yeah.

1813
01:27:13,081 --> 01:27:16,350
I can only imagine.
I can only imagine being trapped in that

1814
01:27:16,351 --> 01:27:18,930
scenario,
but I'm.

1815
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,960
I'm also very sensitive to the variables
that different people go through with 

1816
01:27:24,331 --> 01:27:26,160
their bodies.
I have hypothyroidism.

1817
01:27:26,161 --> 01:27:28,620
I have to take thyroid medication.
It runs in my family,

1818
01:27:28,621 --> 01:27:33,210
my mother has it too,
and I know I used to get headaches,

1819
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:35,760
these weird headaches at the end of the 
day where I was like,

1820
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:38,220
oh fuck,
like I could fall asleep.

1821
01:27:38,221 --> 01:27:40,560
And it wasn't like,
it wasn't like I was like,

1822
01:27:40,561 --> 01:27:42,960
now I get tired,
I go to sleep,

1823
01:27:42,961 --> 01:27:47,680
but it was like I could fall asleep just
watching tv and be out for like an hour.

1824
01:27:47,681 --> 01:27:49,890
So it didn't make any sense.
It was like a weird tired,

1825
01:27:49,891 --> 01:27:52,020
like I was in pain,
so,

1826
01:27:52,021 --> 01:27:53,580
uh,
and I get these weird headaches.

1827
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:56,310
And then once I finally got on 
medication I was like,

1828
01:27:56,311 --> 01:27:56,790
whoa,

1829
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,070
yeah,
right.

1830
01:27:58,220 --> 01:27:58,710
you're like,
oh,

1831
01:27:58,711 --> 01:28:02,100
this is,
this is what other people feel like,

1832
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:05,340
like I thought I was normal because 
that's another thing.

1833
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:10,520
There's such a stigma in this country,
not just about mental illness but about 

1834
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,470
any sort of illness where people can't 
openly freely talk about it.

1835
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:17,070
So you end up living in this weird 
bubble where you don't really like,

1836
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,910
I know people that have mental illness 
that didn't even realize they had mental

1837
01:28:20,911 --> 01:28:25,911
illness until they finally had a 
conversation with a doctor about it and 

1838
01:28:25,911 --> 01:28:25,911
they were like,
oh,

1839
01:28:25,911 --> 01:28:30,141
this isn't normal.
Like everybody doesn't hear voices or 

1840
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:30,141
everybody doesn't.
It's like,

1841
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:34,821
yeah,
because you're so afraid to talk to 

1842
01:28:34,821 --> 01:28:34,980
somebody about it.
So that's,

1843
01:28:34,981 --> 01:28:39,981
I mean that's a really important part of
this I think is just getting past the 

1844
01:28:41,311 --> 01:28:43,140
stigma.
That's why when something like this with

1845
01:28:43,141 --> 01:28:46,350
robin williams,
which is so fucking depressing happens a

1846
01:28:46,351 --> 01:28:49,260
lot of people rally around it and they 
say,

1847
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:54,290
hey,
maybe we can use this as a teaching 

1848
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:55,470
moment because this guy,
no matter how good his life was,

1849
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:00,920
he had this thing that he ultimately 
couldn't kick and it wasn't his fault.

1850
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:02,130
It just

1851
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,830
is that way sometimes.
And hey,

1852
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:09,090
maybe you have it too.
I think in some ways it's good when high

1853
01:29:09,091 --> 01:29:14,091
functioning People come out and talk 
about their illnesses because then 

1854
01:29:14,091 --> 01:29:16,440
people who are actually experiencing 
things like loss of employment,

1855
01:29:16,441 --> 01:29:17,850
loss of a loved one,
whatever,

1856
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,530
or who have had a bad go of it for other
reasons or like even you,

1857
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,550
like you had said before,
like even you,

1858
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:26,180
but you're pretty or,
but you're successful,

1859
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:27,560
you're whatever.
Well,

1860
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:32,570
if you could have that,
then of course it's not weird that I 

1861
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:32,570
have,
you know,

1862
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:36,390
it's like it's a good thing for people 
to be able to see that they're not alone

1863
01:29:36,391 --> 01:29:41,391
like that.
And also there's a bunch of people that 

1864
01:29:41,391 --> 01:29:45,441
attribute other people's depression 
really irresponsibly to a bunch of 

1865
01:29:45,481 --> 01:29:46,690
different things.
Oh yeah.

1866
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:52,730
I had gotten the podcast last week that 
was saying that robin williams killed 

1867
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:55,401
himself because his wife's ex wives took
all his money as if he knows it all.

1868
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:57,590
It's like,
oh,

1869
01:29:57,591 --> 01:30:02,591
I'm so glAd you're such an expert and 
I'm not saying that it was a women's 

1870
01:30:02,591 --> 01:30:05,751
addiction to free stuff that was loose.
It was so horrible and it makes you want

1871
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:08,850
to be like,
who the fuck are you to presume that you

1872
01:30:08,851 --> 01:30:11,100
know what's happening in somebody else's
head ever?

1873
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:16,130
Not only that,
it's insanely you're responsible to go 

1874
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:16,130
against the grain of science and 
medicine,

1875
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:18,270
which is clearly established that it's 
an illness.

1876
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,510
It's an illness.
Yeah,

1877
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:24,650
and I think that that's something too 
that a lot of people don't understand 

1878
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:28,101
the same way.
We're so comfortable with concepts of 

1879
01:30:28,101 --> 01:30:31,730
diagnosis and cure because we're so used
to things like flu cold,

1880
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:33,680
um,
you know,

1881
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:35,760
tonsil infection,
whatever,

1882
01:30:35,761 --> 01:30:40,761
where you take an antibiotic or you take
an antiviral or you just wait in your 

1883
01:30:40,761 --> 01:30:43,831
immune system clears the disease.
We're used to catching things and then 

1884
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:44,910
eliminating them.

1885
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:49,200
But when you have disease states that 
are processed,

1886
01:30:49,201 --> 01:30:52,380
states like cancer,
like diabetes,

1887
01:30:52,381 --> 01:30:57,000
like mental illness,
there's no cure per se.

1888
01:30:57,030 --> 01:31:02,030
like I even,
I got a tweet just earlier today from 

1889
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:02,030
somebody who is like,
blah,

1890
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:02,030
blah,
blah.

1891
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:02,030
Have you ever thought about blah,
blah,

1892
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:03,410
blah to cure your depression?
It's like,

1893
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,600
I'm not cured of depression because I 
take attallah pram,

1894
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:11,870
I'm in treatment puts.
I'll be in treatment the rest of my 

1895
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:15,021
life.
Do you believe as a person who's a 

1896
01:31:15,021 --> 01:31:18,291
neuroscientist,
is it possible that they could 

1897
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:20,811
eventually come up with something that 
balances your brain out instead of just 

1898
01:31:20,811 --> 01:31:24,980
adding something to your neurochemistry,
which sort of enhances your serotonin 

1899
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:25,920
levels,
but rather something that where they can

1900
01:31:25,921 --> 01:31:28,050
get it at a genetic level?
I hope so.

1901
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:28,950
I mean,
I really hope so.

1902
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:33,951
We're starting to see major improvements
in cancer biology with personal genomic 

1903
01:31:35,221 --> 01:31:40,221
medicine.
My fear with genomic medicine is only 

1904
01:31:40,221 --> 01:31:44,390
not to put a dark cloud on it because I 
think that it has like amazing 

1905
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:48,860
prospects.
My fear is that it's going to further 

1906
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:51,800
increase the kind of class divide where 
you've got people who are sick because 

1907
01:31:51,901 --> 01:31:56,901
sickness strikes rich and poor the same,
but for some reason we are a very class 

1908
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:00,070
based system

1909
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:05,070
and I think that you're going to see 
that rich people get those kinds of 

1910
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:06,970
treatments and poor people don't and 
that that kind of stuff

1911
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:08,150
scares me.
That worries me.

1912
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:11,320
It always is with anything emerging 
technologies.

1913
01:32:11,321 --> 01:32:13,300
Remember in the old days,
the wall street phone,

1914
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:18,330
remember that wall street movie where 
Michael Douglas epic fucking stupid 

1915
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:18,330
phone and that was like a huge status 
symbol.

1916
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,980
Rappers used to happen videos,
most people couldn't afford a phone.

1917
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:26,350
Now I,
I go to Brazil all the time for the ufc 

1918
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:26,350
and I've gone to these poor 
neighborhoods.

1919
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:26,770
You see people on cell phones.

1920
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:27,500
Oh,
you see it in,

1921
01:32:27,501 --> 01:32:31,280
in african nations were there aren't,
there isn't enough malaria medication,

1922
01:32:31,281 --> 01:32:33,230
but I mean there's this huge malaria,
um,

1923
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:38,190
push right now to increase awareness and
you know,

1924
01:32:38,191 --> 01:32:43,191
you can get mosquito nets,
you can do malaria tests on your family 

1925
01:32:43,191 --> 01:32:46,331
and you do it all through your cell 
phone because it's very common for 

1926
01:32:46,331 --> 01:32:46,880
people to have cell cell service or 
maybe not service,

1927
01:32:46,881 --> 01:32:51,881
but to have access to a cell phone 
because the technology is getting 

1928
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:51,881
cheaper and cheaper.
So yes,

1929
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:56,561
I do think that time always tells and 
that hopefully eventually that kind of 

1930
01:32:56,871 --> 01:33:01,871
stuff trickles down.
but I wish it didn't have to trickle 

1931
01:33:01,871 --> 01:33:01,871
down.
I wish medication.

1932
01:33:01,871 --> 01:33:06,010
I wish health and wellness,
we're a more egalitarian enterprise that

1933
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,730
one of the biggest problems I think with
the structure of american government and

1934
01:33:10,731 --> 01:33:14,360
being such a capitalist society,
which I'm all about capitalism,

1935
01:33:14,361 --> 01:33:19,361
don't get me wrong,
I think we need to be a socialist 

1936
01:33:19,361 --> 01:33:19,361
capitalist blend just like we are.
Um,

1937
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:21,860
we have a lot of socialist systems in 
our country.

1938
01:33:21,950 --> 01:33:23,630
The male,
the socialist educate,

1939
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:28,631
public education is socialist.
We have a lot of capitalist systems in 

1940
01:33:28,631 --> 01:33:31,481
this country.
I hate that healthcare is a for profit 

1941
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:32,120
system in America.
It makes no sense to me.

1942
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:38,280
The argument is obviously the people who
work harder or more ambitious become 

1943
01:33:38,441 --> 01:33:40,540
better at it,
should be rewarded for that.

1944
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:45,541
And that's what's going to motivate them
to work harder and be the best heart 

1945
01:33:45,541 --> 01:33:45,730
surgeon to be the best brain doctor to 
be the best.

1946
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:47,320
You know,
the guy who fixes.

1947
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:52,600
I just feel like by the time you're a 
brain surgeon and you're licensed brain 

1948
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,480
surgeon,
you're a fucking good brain surgeon like

1949
01:33:53,481 --> 01:33:58,481
you.
You don't get through a 10 year 

1950
01:33:58,481 --> 01:34:00,551
residency.
You get your surgical degree and then 

1951
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:01,670
you have a 10 year residency before you 
become a neurosurgeon.

1952
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:04,970
You don't get through that and you're 
like a sub par neurosurgeon.

1953
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:10,500
You're,
you're a fucking incredible 

1954
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:10,500
neurosurgeons.
they're the best of the best,

1955
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:14,650
the best of the best.
And if those people want to do private 

1956
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:14,650
practice on top of it,
that's fine,

1957
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:17,390
but we have a practice on top of the 
socialized medicine.

1958
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:19,430
There has to be a national health 
service.

1959
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:21,020
Has to be.
I agree with that.

1960
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:22,730
Here's the problem.
Here's the problem.

1961
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:24,680
Fundamentally and I,
it's very.

1962
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:29,830
If you can provide me an argument that 
solves this problem for a capitalist 

1963
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:30,520
healthcare system,
then I'm all about too,

1964
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:32,330
and I don't mean you,
but I mean anybody listening,

1965
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:33,770
I'm all about hearing it.

1966
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:39,280
The problem is that when you have a 
capitalist system that's a competition 

1967
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:44,801
based system for profit,
what ends up happening is that people 

1968
01:34:44,801 --> 01:34:46,010
compete.
That's how it works,

1969
01:34:46,011 --> 01:34:46,820
right?
You compete in,

1970
01:34:46,821 --> 01:34:49,460
a lot of times they say that's what 
drives prices down,

1971
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:52,410
is that you compete and prices get 
better and then you've,

1972
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:53,200
you know,
the best part,

1973
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,200
whatever.
Um,

1974
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:59,290
but what ends up happening when you have
for profit healthcare is that illness is

1975
01:35:02,091 --> 01:35:04,880
incentivized.
Wellness is not.

1976
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:08,690
People make more money.
The sicker you get,

1977
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,930
people make more money.
The more procedures you have to get.

1978
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:17,170
People make more money,
the longer you stay in the hospital and 

1979
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:20,741
the minute.
I'm not saying there's some grand 

1980
01:35:20,741 --> 01:35:22,421
conspiracy to keep people sick,
but if you've got an industry like the 

1981
01:35:22,421 --> 01:35:27,341
insurance and pharmaceutical and for 
profit hospital industry where the 

1982
01:35:28,161 --> 01:35:33,161
profit comes from sickness,
where is the incentive to get people?

1983
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:38,770
Well,
I'm not saying that doctors aren't very 

1984
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:39,200
noble people.
They are and they work every day.

1985
01:35:39,201 --> 01:35:40,130
DoctorS,
nurses,

1986
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,370
other healthcare officials to get people
better.

1987
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:48,490
But the system in itself does not 
incentivize wellness.

1988
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:53,150
It incentivizes sickness.
So at that very basic level,

1989
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:58,540
it's a bit broken because somewhere 
along that chain people are gonna take 

1990
01:35:58,540 --> 01:35:59,270
advantage.
They're going to say,

1991
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:04,450
oh,
I make more money if this guy has to 

1992
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:08,081
stay in the hospital an extra day or I 
make more money if this guy has to get 

1993
01:36:08,081 --> 01:36:10,610
this quote unquote unnecessary procedure
all the way across the board.

1994
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:15,850
The sicker you are,
the more money goes into the system and 

1995
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:16,580
that's really gross.
It's gross.

1996
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:21,290
There are certain things that capitalism
don't work on and I think that wellness,

1997
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:24,260
which is a basic human right,
is one of those things.

1998
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:29,290
It just doesn't make sense.
it's fundamentally incompatible with 

1999
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:31,841
that type of monetary system,
but isn't that just taking into account 

2000
01:36:31,841 --> 01:36:36,311
only people that do the wrong thing,
but people who do the right thing,

2001
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:41,710
who motivate themselves to become the 
best orthopedic surgeon and treat the 

2002
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:45,140
lakers and fix all their knee issues and
these people rise to the occasion,

2003
01:36:45,141 --> 01:36:47,150
shouldn't they be rewarded totally.

2004
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:49,130
And the turd in the pool is not the 
surgeon.

2005
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,810
Trust me,
it's the insurance company.

2006
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,270
It's the pharmaceutical company.
It's this.

2007
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:58,271
Occasionally the surgeon.
I have a friend who was my friend rob 

2008
01:36:58,271 --> 01:37:00,160
when he was young,
worked at a resort and he.

2009
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:05,260
He clearly remembers these doctors 
bragging about how they talked to some 

2010
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:08,570
guy into getting a surgery and because 
of these buying a porsche.

2011
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:09,290
Yeah,
no,

2012
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:09,920
there is that.
oh,

2013
01:37:09,921 --> 01:37:10,630
for sure.
So,

2014
01:37:10,631 --> 01:37:15,631
so the fact that it even trickles down 
to the people who took a hippocratic 

2015
01:37:15,631 --> 01:37:19,511
oath to the people who we think of as 
being the most noble of the most noble 

2016
01:37:19,511 --> 01:37:22,310
of citizens in this country,
if it even trickles down to them,

2017
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:27,910
how is it going to affect somebody who's
pushing paper at the insurance company 

2018
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:28,370
where you're just a number on a piece of
paper,

2019
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:33,400
you're just a statistic and you're a 
bottom line is the answer to cut out 

2020
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:37,050
that aspect of it,
that the insurance company is the,

2021
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:42,051
the the issue and that really socialized
medicine would be compensating the 

2022
01:37:42,051 --> 01:37:45,590
doctors and the doctors would still be 
potentially able to rise.

2023
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:51,620
That would be my answer is the same.
I think as any other industrialized 

2024
01:37:52,251 --> 01:37:57,251
western nation.
We're the only industrialized western 

2025
01:37:57,251 --> 01:37:57,251
nation that doesn't have national 
healthcare,

2026
01:37:57,251 --> 01:37:59,190
so what ends up happening is you have a 
public option.

2027
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:04,430
You have the option to have a healthcare
system that is free and available to you

2028
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:12,080
and it has basic levels of treatment and
care for anything that could go wrong 

2029
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,380
with you and their doctors.
You can see in their hospitals.

2030
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:18,180
You can go to if you want to go private.
It's the same way that we have education

2031
01:38:18,181 --> 01:38:21,390
in this country.
I had an amazing public education.

2032
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:23,730
I have friends who went to private 
school.

2033
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:25,800
Their parents wanted them to go to 
private school.

2034
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:30,830
Good for them.
They may have had a better education 

2035
01:38:30,830 --> 01:38:33,651
than me.
They may not have because there were 

2036
01:38:33,651 --> 01:38:35,841
still amazing teachers available and an 
incredible infrastructure in place for 

2037
01:38:35,841 --> 01:38:39,651
me to get an incredible education as a 
student in the right spot or you can be 

2038
01:38:39,651 --> 01:38:44,061
in the la unified school system and have
fucking horrible education that that is 

2039
01:38:44,061 --> 01:38:47,730
a problem with gentrification and with 
segregation and with again,

2040
01:38:47,731 --> 01:38:51,270
I think some of the problems of our 
capitalist society.

2041
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:55,900
While it's certainly a problem in how we
view and what you know,

2042
01:38:55,910 --> 01:38:58,860
what we think about in terms of where 
our money should go.

2043
01:38:58,861 --> 01:39:03,861
LIke if we had.
We had privatized police force and 

2044
01:39:03,861 --> 01:39:05,040
privatized fire.
Like every time your house was on fire,

2045
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:10,041
you had to pay someone to come in and 
fix the issue and put the fire out.

2046
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:11,700
Like,
my god,

2047
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,760
it's happened before it's happened 
there.

2048
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:18,860
Yeah.
You can find stories online of people 

2049
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:21,801
living in,
in regions where they have like a 

2050
01:39:21,801 --> 01:39:21,801
privatized,
um,

2051
01:39:21,801 --> 01:39:21,920
fire service,
like it's a,

2052
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:25,590
a four pay fire service and like 
people's houses have burned down because

2053
01:39:25,591 --> 01:39:28,080
they can't afford to put it out a weird 
area.

2054
01:39:28,081 --> 01:39:29,820
Like some,
like some rural area.

2055
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:31,830
Exactly.
And imagine what that was an urban issue

2056
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,380
with healthcare.
I mean healthcare.

2057
01:39:34,381 --> 01:39:39,381
You can be in the biggest,
most populated city in the world and 

2058
01:39:39,381 --> 01:39:39,381
there's poor people that don't have 
healthcare.

2059
01:39:39,381 --> 01:39:43,740
Yeah.
I think that if society is going to 

2060
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,981
offer basic services,
police force and fire for fire 

2061
01:39:46,051 --> 01:39:48,690
departments,
medicine has got to be wanting to be one

2062
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:53,691
of them.
And the thing is when you put the money 

2063
01:39:53,691 --> 01:39:56,541
into preventive care that's necessary,
you end up saving so much money on the 

2064
01:39:56,971 --> 01:40:01,971
back end when people who can't afford to
go to the doctor until they have a 

2065
01:40:01,971 --> 01:40:06,861
festering wound or until they've allowed
the cancer to spread or whatever are 

2066
01:40:06,861 --> 01:40:11,691
going to the doctor early on and they're
getting a checkup because they can 

2067
01:40:11,691 --> 01:40:14,220
afford it because it's free to them.
When you've got somebody who's living on

2068
01:40:14,221 --> 01:40:18,570
the street who obviously going to be 
subject to much more infection,

2069
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:21,600
much more disease because they just,
they're living in squalor.

2070
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:25,320
If they can go to the doctor on a 
regular basis and get a checkup,

2071
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:30,560
they're not going to be then going to 
the doctor later to get some multi 

2072
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:30,780
thousand dollar procedure.

2073
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:33,720
That hippocratic oath,
they have to do this.

2074
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,080
If somebody goes into and they're like,
fucking arm is hanging off,

2075
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:39,060
no doctor is going to be like,
I can't reattach your arm.

2076
01:40:39,061 --> 01:40:40,770
You're just going to die.
They're going to do it.

2077
01:40:40,771 --> 01:40:45,771
They're going to build these people and 
they're never gonna fucking pay their 

2078
01:40:45,771 --> 01:40:47,751
bills because they can't afford to and 
then you and I are going to absorb that 

2079
01:40:47,751 --> 01:40:51,801
cost in our.
In the money that we're paying for our 

2080
01:40:51,801 --> 01:40:51,801
insurance.
Go back when you're talking about people

2081
01:40:51,801 --> 01:40:56,481
living in squalor.
That goes back to the mental illness 

2082
01:40:56,481 --> 01:40:56,481
issue as well because

2083
01:40:56,481 --> 01:40:59,200
he definitely massive percent of those 
people that are wandering around 

2084
01:40:59,200 --> 01:40:59,500
homeless.
They're such an important point to make,

2085
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:00,340
but that was the gun.
Damn.

2086
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,740
Ronald reagan administration,
they changed the standards.

2087
01:41:02,741 --> 01:41:04,450
They let loose,
I remember it,

2088
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:08,860
I was a kid and I remember being in New 
York and seeing all these fucking people

2089
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:13,861
wandering.
I came to New York for a martial arts 

2090
01:41:13,861 --> 01:41:17,011
tournament during the reagan 
administration and I remember like 

2091
01:41:17,011 --> 01:41:20,610
people were talking and I was young.
I was a teenager and these adults were 

2092
01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:23,890
talking about these that all of a sudden
they changed the mental health standards

2093
01:41:23,891 --> 01:41:26,560
and they were releasing all these people
and I was like,

2094
01:41:26,561 --> 01:41:28,600
what?
LIke they're just releasing them.

2095
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:30,930
They were taking these people that were 
in mental institutions.

2096
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,960
They changed the standards of what you 
needed to to keep these people in these 

2097
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:38,310
facilities and they were just released 
them on the streets and influx.

2098
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:43,350
There were two massive releases.
There was one in the fifties when held 

2099
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:44,470
all first came on the market,
which is an anti psychotic,

2100
01:41:44,471 --> 01:41:47,740
which was a major improvement and 
psychiatric care.

2101
01:41:47,741 --> 01:41:50,350
So all of a sudden you had people who 
were schizophrenic,

2102
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:53,470
who had delusional kind of disorders and
you can treat them.

2103
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:57,070
And so these people who were like 
basically just being fed and watered and

2104
01:41:57,071 --> 01:42:01,000
asylums were given how doll and they 
could lead functional lives again.

2105
01:42:01,001 --> 01:42:06,001
So there you saw a big change in the way
that mental health services happened.

2106
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:11,550
You,
you no longer had the asylum population 

2107
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:12,100
and then you started having more of this
idea of like a mental health facility.

2108
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:14,940
And then again,
during the reagan administration used,

2109
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,740
you saw a big release.
The problem there was,

2110
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:19,780
it was,
it was really a name only.

2111
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:21,460
They weren't getting any better 
treatment.

2112
01:42:21,490 --> 01:42:23,860
They were just put out on the street,
change the standard.

2113
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:28,860
Exactly.
And so you've got these people that are 

2114
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:28,860
put out on the street and it's,
it's again,

2115
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:30,760
that there's,
don't get me wrong,

2116
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:32,530
I,
I mean,

2117
01:42:32,531 --> 01:42:33,880
look at me like I,
like I said,

2118
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:38,881
I moved out when I was fucking 16.
I busted my ass my whole life to like 

2119
01:42:38,881 --> 01:42:39,080
work really hard.
I got a good education.

2120
01:42:39,081 --> 01:42:40,030
Um,
I,

2121
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:43,150
you know,
even coming to la with bill,

2122
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:46,090
he opened a bunch of doors for me.
I fucking walk through those doors.

2123
01:42:46,091 --> 01:42:49,960
I made sure that I was as responsible as
possible.

2124
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:53,110
I am all about fiscal and personal 
responsibility.

2125
01:42:53,111 --> 01:42:55,930
I have amazing credit,
I have no debt.

2126
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:01,400
Um,
but I also know that as a nation we're 

2127
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:04,801
only as strong as the weakest amongst us
and there are certain people to whom 

2128
01:43:04,801 --> 01:43:07,510
those types of standards just can't 
apply because they're,

2129
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:10,660
they're ill will.
It's a spectrum issue,

2130
01:43:10,661 --> 01:43:11,020
isn't it?

2131
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:12,920
I mean there's,
there's so many variables that when,

2132
01:43:12,921 --> 01:43:17,921
when people like to look at these issues
and look at them in a black and white 

2133
01:43:17,921 --> 01:43:17,921
term,
I'm a liberal.

2134
01:43:17,921 --> 01:43:18,100
So I think this,
I'm a conservative.

2135
01:43:18,101 --> 01:43:20,380
So I think that.
And that's really,

2136
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:25,590
you know,
I have a lot of ideas that are very 

2137
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:25,590
liberal and a lot of ideas that are 
fairly conservative too.

2138
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:30,310
There's a real issues with picking aside
like that,

2139
01:43:30,311 --> 01:43:34,780
especially when it comes to ideologies.
It's just such a lazy way to think.

2140
01:43:35,230 --> 01:43:40,230
You're not thinking,
you're letting somebody else think for 

2141
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:41,941
you.
I get a lot of hate when I come on your 

2142
01:43:41,941 --> 01:43:41,941
podcast,
but also when I go on the young turks,

2143
01:43:41,941 --> 01:43:45,811
anytime I talk about gm foods or 
genetically modified crops in any way 

2144
01:43:45,811 --> 01:43:48,370
and because what ends up happening is 
people look at me and they go,

2145
01:43:48,371 --> 01:43:50,020
oh,
you're a liberal shill.

2146
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:50,950
They say,
I'm a shell.

2147
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,190
They look at me and they say,
okay,

2148
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,720
you're a liberal,
you're a progressive,

2149
01:43:53,721 --> 01:43:58,721
you're left wing.
Why do you have this super conservative 

2150
01:43:58,721 --> 01:44:02,651
ideology when it comes to gm foods?
Why would you say that you thInk that's 

2151
01:44:02,651 --> 01:44:05,080
a good thing?
You must be pro big agribusiness.

2152
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:10,090
You must be pro monsanto and it's like,
because I don't inform my politics based

2153
01:44:10,581 --> 01:44:15,581
on what a party tells me,
my politics are informed based on the 

2154
01:44:15,581 --> 01:44:19,001
science.
I studied the science behind genetic 

2155
01:44:19,001 --> 01:44:21,671
modification and I come to a personal 
conclusion that genetic modification in 

2156
01:44:21,671 --> 01:44:25,760
and of itself is not only not dangerous,
but can also be a huge boon.

2157
01:44:25,761 --> 01:44:30,620
It can be really helpful for health and 
human safety across,

2158
01:44:30,621 --> 01:44:35,621
especially in lower income and 
globalized areas where they're not very 

2159
01:44:35,621 --> 01:44:40,121
industrialized.
Second problem is that people have a 

2160
01:44:40,121 --> 01:44:41,900
really hard time with the concept of sin
touchy.

2161
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,980
This idea of,
you know,

2162
01:44:42,981 --> 01:44:47,981
that's a literary term for looking at 
the part for the whole or the whole for 

2163
01:44:47,981 --> 01:44:47,981
the part.

2164
01:44:47,981 --> 01:44:50,060
So people say gm food,
monsanto,

2165
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,100
monsanto.
It's the same thing.

2166
01:44:52,101 --> 01:44:57,101
It's not the fucking same thing.
That's a company that utilizes gm 

2167
01:44:57,101 --> 01:45:00,461
technology and yes,
recently I got offered a branded 

2168
01:45:00,461 --> 01:45:03,881
entertainment job with monsanto and I 
had to turn it down and the reason I 

2169
01:45:03,881 --> 01:45:07,331
turned it down was not necessarily 
because I really disagree with the 

2170
01:45:07,331 --> 01:45:08,690
practices even though I do fucking 
disagree with their practices.

2171
01:45:08,691 --> 01:45:13,691
Like let's be honest.
There are a lot of monsanto things that 

2172
01:45:13,691 --> 01:45:15,371
make me mad.
Social practices are but in the 

2173
01:45:15,371 --> 01:45:15,371
capitalist kind of prep,
but.

2174
01:45:15,371 --> 01:45:20,080
But the reason I had to turn down this 
brand to deal is because I knew that if 

2175
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,650
I ever took a dime from a company like 
monsanto,

2176
01:45:21,651 --> 01:45:26,651
my ability as a journalist to talk about
gm crops from a very neutral perspective

2177
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:33,190
would be out the window.
Nobody would ever take me seriously 

2178
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:33,190
again.

2179
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:36,730
So it's the same thing with big pharma.
People go like a big pharma's evil,

2180
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:42,640
and it's like,
so what should you never take drugs 

2181
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:42,640
again?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

2182
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:46,840
It's like you've got to be able to look 
at these things in a nuanced way and 

2183
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,770
understand that there are problems and 
there are evils,

2184
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:51,410
but you can't throw the baby out with 
the bathwater and you can't say,

2185
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:56,440
oh,
all modern medicine is terrible because 

2186
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:57,530
pfizer is making money on the backs of 
poor people.

2187
01:45:57,531 --> 01:45:58,010
It's like,
yeaH,

2188
01:45:58,011 --> 01:46:01,430
that's fucked up about pfizer,
but that doesn't mean modern medicine is

2189
01:46:01,431 --> 01:46:06,431
terrible.
These are two totally different 

2190
01:46:06,431 --> 01:46:06,431
conversations.

2191
01:46:06,431 --> 01:46:09,540
AlSo people,
when they start talking about 

2192
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:09,540
genetically modified foods,
one of the things that they have to take

2193
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:13,981
into consideration is that almost 
everything you eat is genetically 

2194
01:46:13,981 --> 01:46:13,981
modified and you go to the grocery 
store.

2195
01:46:13,981 --> 01:46:16,090
If you're getting corn,
if you're getting apples,

2196
01:46:16,091 --> 01:46:21,091
if you're getting tomatoes,
stop thinking that this just because 

2197
01:46:21,091 --> 01:46:21,940
it's organic,
that it's not genetically modified.

2198
01:46:21,941 --> 01:46:25,930
The corn that you eat today has no 
resemblance to the original corn.

2199
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,390
None Whatsoever,
and then they'll say,

2200
01:46:27,391 --> 01:46:29,070
yeah,
but it might not be transgenic.

2201
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:34,100
It likely is transgenic too,
and that's another thing like genetic 

2202
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:34,980
modification is a really big umbrella 
term.

2203
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:40,280
It could be selective breeding is 
genetic modification with a lot of 

2204
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:43,320
people have a hard time with the concept
of transgenic foods and I say to them,

2205
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,630
fine,
if you don't want to eat transgenic,

2206
01:46:45,631 --> 01:46:47,480
food's good.
Define transgender.

2207
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:52,320
So transgenic foods would be a scientist
going into the genome of an organism.

2208
01:46:52,321 --> 01:46:55,590
Let's say it's a type of corn.
They go into the genome and they go,

2209
01:46:55,591 --> 01:46:58,740
okay,
this corn tends to die readily.

2210
01:46:58,741 --> 01:47:02,520
When the temperature gets above 101,
well the climate is changing.

2211
01:47:02,521 --> 01:47:04,170
It's getting hotter and hotter Where 
they farm it,

2212
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:09,380
so we're going to tinker with the genome
and we're going to delete a gene or 

2213
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:12,861
insert a gene or move the genes around 
in some way so that this corn is now 

2214
01:47:13,201 --> 01:47:14,310
drought resistant.

2215
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:17,100
Change the genome,
produce a new corn crop,

2216
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:22,130
and then continue to breed that corn 
crop and that is really the goal and 

2217
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:24,360
generally the motivation behind gm 
crops.

2218
01:47:24,361 --> 01:47:27,570
It's to make them withstand things like 
droughts or pests or whatever,

2219
01:47:27,571 --> 01:47:31,170
so that they can live heartier and feed 
more people in that way.

2220
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:36,380
Now sometimes you have a company like 
monsanto doing their own research where 

2221
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:40,551
they want to make a crop that can only 
live for one generation and then die so 

2222
01:47:40,551 --> 01:47:41,340
that farmers have to keep buying their 
seeds,

2223
01:47:41,341 --> 01:47:43,260
for example,
or they make a roundup ready crops.

2224
01:47:43,261 --> 01:47:45,360
I want to crop so that I can spray the 
whole thing down.

2225
01:47:45,361 --> 01:47:46,950
With roundup,
the crop survives,

2226
01:47:46,951 --> 01:47:49,890
but all of the weeds around it die.
It's an easier way to farm,

2227
01:47:49,891 --> 01:47:52,710
but it could have some really 
detrimental ecological effects,

2228
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:58,220
but for the most part,
this is why a lot of scientists get 

2229
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:00,750
pissed off about all the gm hysteria 
because they're like,

2230
01:48:00,751 --> 01:48:05,751
okay,
if I were to take this random corn crop 

2231
01:48:05,751 --> 01:48:05,850
and that random corn crop and breed 
them,

2232
01:48:05,851 --> 01:48:08,310
I'm shuffling like 30,000
genes.

2233
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:13,670
If I were to go in targeted and changed 
three genes that only affect the ability

2234
01:48:15,301 --> 01:48:17,700
for it to withstand a higher 
temperature.

2235
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:21,630
It's a much more specific and targeted 
way to change this plant.

2236
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:24,540
I trust it more.
I know exactly what I'm eating,

2237
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:25,590
but people are like,
oh,

2238
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,480
it's horrifying because they're going in
with,

2239
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,570
you know,
pipetters and tools.

2240
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:35,600
Well,
it's because of things like roundup 

2241
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,641
because of companies that do mean 
there's a reason why people are 

2242
01:48:37,641 --> 01:48:37,770
suspicious is reason why people are 
cautious,

2243
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,400
they are worried about.
And then there's been also some.

2244
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:43,650
There's been some fuckery involved in 
these studies too.

2245
01:48:43,651 --> 01:48:47,240
Like there's a study about rats where 
they showed the grow,

2246
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:52,280
grew all these tumors in rats.
They use more susceptible to tumors in 

2247
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:53,520
the first place.
it's not,

2248
01:48:53,521 --> 01:48:54,060
it's,
it's,

2249
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:54,990
you know,
what,

2250
01:48:54,991 --> 01:48:59,991
as somebody,
as a person who has never studied lab 

2251
01:48:59,991 --> 01:49:04,011
science to try and make sense of all the
bullshit in the media and,

2252
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:09,920
and,
and to be reading articles that were 

2253
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:09,920
written by journalists who have never 
studied lab on,

2254
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,660
how are you expected to keep things 
straight?

2255
01:49:12,930 --> 01:49:16,830
That's why I do what I do for a living.
I'm a science communicator and my job is

2256
01:49:16,831 --> 01:49:21,450
to look at research that exists and to 
try and translate that to the public.

2257
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,510
But I also want to try and understand 
where the public is coming from.

2258
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:27,780
Why are you afraid of this thing?
Why does this thing worry you?

2259
01:49:27,781 --> 01:49:30,450
Let's understand the psychological 
reasons behind it.

2260
01:49:30,451 --> 01:49:35,451
LeT's understand what you've been fed 
your hold lives by the media and see 

2261
01:49:35,451 --> 01:49:38,400
what's reasonable and what's not and 
come to a rational conclusion about it.

2262
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:43,430
Unfortunately,
we as a species respond better in some 

2263
01:49:43,430 --> 01:49:48,010
ways to fear and hysteria.
We we see on the news that's like,

2264
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,240
holy shit,
this thing could kill you,

2265
01:49:49,241 --> 01:49:49,930
and you're like,
oh my god,

2266
01:49:49,931 --> 01:49:51,400
really?
I need to know about this.

2267
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:54,430
Because if the media was always 
presenting things rationally like,

2268
01:49:54,431 --> 01:49:56,800
okay,
let's take a balanced approach to this.

2269
01:49:56,801 --> 01:50:00,040
Let's look at the pros and the cons and 
people would tune out.

2270
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:05,041
It's not that interesting anymore.
The things that we find salient are the 

2271
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:08,821
things that raise the hairs on the backs
of our necks and what that ends up 

2272
01:50:08,821 --> 01:50:10,300
breeding is,
you know,

2273
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:15,360
is just a media landscape of 
fearmongering and screaming matches and 

2274
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:21,120
worst case scenario conversations,
which I don't think is very helpful for 

2275
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:21,120
anybody.

2276
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:25,800
It's also the reality of the absorption 
of information that people's ability to 

2277
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:25,800
take in.
How,

2278
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,100
I mean,
how much time do you have in a day?

2279
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:30,610
People work eight plus hours a day plus 
commuting plus family,

2280
01:50:30,611 --> 01:50:34,120
plus you have to be an expert about 
whatever they do for a living.

2281
01:50:34,121 --> 01:50:36,040
I doN't know,
contradicting information.

2282
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:41,041
You could always go online and find a 
host of websites that will tell you 

2283
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:45,631
about the evils of genetically modified 
foods and if and if you absorb that 

2284
01:50:45,631 --> 01:50:46,930
information and you.
That is what you preach,

2285
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:47,950
that's your mantra.
Now.

2286
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:53,130
It's very difficult to be open minded 
and then sort of accept other ideas and 

2287
01:50:53,130 --> 01:50:56,900
try that,
contradict those original ideas that 

2288
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:56,900
you've been telling everybody about

2289
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:56,900
and in.
The truth is it's,

2290
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,400
it's,
it's hard to figure out who to trust,

2291
01:50:58,401 --> 01:51:02,600
especially in a landscape like this.
That's why I never promote.

2292
01:51:02,601 --> 01:51:07,601
I have no intention as a science 
communicator that the work that I do is 

2293
01:51:08,331 --> 01:51:13,331
going to necessarily promote a lot of 
people to go off and become scientists 

2294
01:51:13,761 --> 01:51:15,110
themselves.
I mean hopefully young,

2295
01:51:15,170 --> 01:51:17,270
young children or some Teens,
people who are in that,

2296
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:19,940
in that age group and who are 
interested.

2297
01:51:19,941 --> 01:51:22,910
Maybe there'll be influenced a little 
bit about some of the work that I do,

2298
01:51:22,911 --> 01:51:27,911
but more more than that,
I want to see a higher level of 

2299
01:51:27,911 --> 01:51:32,171
scientific literacy in this country.
All that means is that we think more 

2300
01:51:33,681 --> 01:51:37,700
with our brains and less with our 
emotions and less with our,

2301
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:39,620
you know,
that stephen colbert truthiness,

2302
01:51:39,621 --> 01:51:44,621
like we got to get away from truthiness 
just because something feels right 

2303
01:51:44,621 --> 01:51:45,320
doesn't necessarily mean that it is 
right.

2304
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:48,530
So it's like,
stop for a minute,

2305
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:51,560
listen to the argument that's being 
made.

2306
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:56,860
Who is making the argument?
Do they have any financial reason to be 

2307
01:51:56,860 --> 01:51:59,951
making the argument?
Did they have any political reason to 

2308
01:51:59,951 --> 01:52:02,591
meet making the argument is this,
is this article about gmos being evil on

2309
01:52:02,631 --> 01:52:03,710
a website called,
oh my god,

2310
01:52:03,711 --> 01:52:06,650
gmos are evil.com
or you know,

2311
01:52:08,510 --> 01:52:11,120
and,
and that's the thing.

2312
01:52:11,121 --> 01:52:11,650
And I,
I,

2313
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:16,660
and,
and I think this also goes back to this 

2314
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:16,670
conversation I had about throwing the 
baby out with the bathwater.

2315
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:22,420
The mainstream media has its problems,
but journalism is an enterprise has a 

2316
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:27,101
lot of nobility to it.
The pharmaceutical company has major 

2317
01:52:27,101 --> 01:52:29,210
problems and it's very broken the 
insurance company too,

2318
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:33,530
but medicine has so much worth to it 
especially,

2319
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:37,310
you know,
evidence based by biomedical advances.

2320
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:41,810
Psychiatric medicine has a lot of know 
pluses.

2321
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:45,710
The process of genetic modification is 
so important,

2322
01:52:45,711 --> 01:52:47,540
but yes,
monsanto has a lot of problems.

2323
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:52,780
We've got to be able to think more 
nuanced about these things and instead 

2324
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:52,780
of going,
well,

2325
01:52:52,780 --> 01:52:55,610
I don't trust fox news,
therefore I don't trust any media.

2326
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:58,730
Therefore I only am going to go to the 
site.

2327
01:52:58,731 --> 01:53:00,050
Did that keeps,
as you said,

2328
01:53:00,051 --> 01:53:03,230
reinforcing what I already believe.
Omg,

2329
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:08,260
gmos are horrible.com.
That's the only place where I get my 

2330
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:09,380
news.
Well now you're in an echo chamber.

2331
01:53:10,190 --> 01:53:15,190
That's a huge issue and the other thing 
that you brought up there about 

2332
01:53:15,190 --> 01:53:15,980
political,
about financial,

2333
01:53:15,981 --> 01:53:20,981
all the different motivations,
all the different things in the 

2334
01:53:20,981 --> 01:53:22,811
variables,
that's also stuff that you have to try 

2335
01:53:22,811 --> 01:53:24,380
to pay attention to and squeeze into 
your head and that's the thing that it's

2336
01:53:24,381 --> 01:53:29,381
impossible.
We need someone like you to sort of 

2337
01:53:29,381 --> 01:53:32,350
break it down.
Someone who has a background in this 

2338
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:33,320
particular area to break it down in a 
way that we can understand what go.

2339
01:53:33,350 --> 01:53:34,340
Okay,
I'm comfortable.

2340
01:53:34,341 --> 01:53:39,341
The santa maria is being honest with me 
about this particular aspect of 

2341
01:53:39,341 --> 01:53:40,340
depression and neurochemistry.
He theSe are.

2342
01:53:40,341 --> 01:53:45,341
This is her experience.
This is also what she knows about the 

2343
01:53:45,341 --> 01:53:45,341
science behind it.
Okay.

2344
01:53:45,341 --> 01:53:48,640
I have no motivation otherwise.
Nobody's paying me to say this and I 

2345
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:48,640
think that this is why we,
as you know,

2346
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:50,630
the listeners of the joe rogan 
experience,

2347
01:53:50,631 --> 01:53:52,730
the listeners of talk nerdy with carrie,
santa maria,

2348
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:57,840
the people who are really involved in 
the next movement of alternative and new

2349
01:53:59,901 --> 01:54:04,901
media.
It is our responsibility to continue to 

2350
01:54:04,901 --> 01:54:08,921
support these kinds of programs and to 
continue to speak up and become engaged 

2351
01:54:09,441 --> 01:54:14,441
and involved.
Because if we're not happy with the way 

2352
01:54:14,441 --> 01:54:16,421
that traditional media is handling 
things because they're playing to the 

2353
01:54:16,421 --> 01:54:16,940
ratings and they're playing to the 
lowest common denominator,

2354
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:22,240
we can't be passive about it.
We have to support the news outlets and 

2355
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:25,460
the organizations and the podcasts and 
the web shows that that we support.

2356
01:54:25,490 --> 01:54:30,490
We have to do our part to make sure that
those things don't fail because the 

2357
01:54:30,490 --> 01:54:33,740
unfortunate thing is we don't have the 
backers that they have.

2358
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:37,160
You know,
I have a squarespace on my side.

2359
01:54:37,161 --> 01:54:39,200
I have computer learning zone on my 
side.

2360
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:41,420
You have these wonderful,
uh,

2361
01:54:41,710 --> 01:54:46,710
sponsors on your side that help you keep
doing this so that you can offer it for 

2362
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:49,700
free to your listeners,
but we're not being backed by pfizer,

2363
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:54,820
but we don't have four months and we 
don't have to meet with these other 

2364
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:57,371
companies would find value in it and 
they know that we're going to say some 

2365
01:54:57,371 --> 01:55:00,551
crazy shit,
but the only reason they're going to 

2366
01:55:00,551 --> 01:55:02,441
keep supporting us if is if people keep 
listening and if you raise them where 

2367
01:55:02,441 --> 01:55:02,540
people are going to keep listening 
because it's interesting.

2368
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:04,820
And the only reason why it's interesting
is because we're being honest.

2369
01:55:04,821 --> 01:55:06,060
Yes.
And so that,

2370
01:55:06,061 --> 01:55:08,210
that whole chain,
like we're all in it together.

2371
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:10,010
I think that's the important thing is 
that like,

2372
01:55:10,530 --> 01:55:12,440
we're here for you,
you're here for us.

2373
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:16,340
And we're all on that same team to be 
that counterculture and to,

2374
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:20,030
to offer opinions.
But also offer facts that are,

2375
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:23,270
that are based in evidence that are 
based in reason,

2376
01:55:23,271 --> 01:55:28,271
that aren't based in some sort of 
corporate interest or because some 

2377
01:55:28,271 --> 01:55:31,151
producer is in that fucking thing in my 
ear telling me that I have to do or say 

2378
01:55:31,151 --> 01:55:35,621
or act like somebody that I'm not.
I would love to talk to you about this 

2379
01:55:35,621 --> 01:55:36,530
to the end of time.
I would love to not tell you that you're

2380
01:55:36,531 --> 01:55:38,420
already past the time you were supposed 
to leave.

2381
01:55:38,450 --> 01:55:43,450
You know what's so funny too is the 
reason I have to leave and I'm so sorry 

2382
01:55:43,450 --> 01:55:43,790
you guys is because I have therapy 
therapy at three

2383
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:48,980
and I've got to make it all the way 
across town to see my therapist at 

2384
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:52,700
anytime you want to do this,
I'm more than happy to with you and I'm 

2385
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:56,211
so happy you're doing your show.
thank you so much for wearing my tee 

2386
01:55:56,211 --> 01:55:56,211
shirt.
I have to.

2387
01:55:56,211 --> 01:55:57,090
Can I take a moment to plug?
Is that okay?

2388
01:55:57,330 --> 01:56:01,500
Because I just started making all this 
great merchandise and you can find it if

2389
01:56:01,501 --> 01:56:04,270
you go brian to my main website just to 
care.

2390
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:06,420
Like if you go home,
maybe click on home,

2391
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:10,290
then you can see that I've got all of my
episodes right there.

2392
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:13,560
You can download them into the center.
That was on a different page.

2393
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:16,500
it was an old episode that I did a talk 
nerdy to me,

2394
01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:17,490
but there's,
you know,

2395
01:56:17,491 --> 01:56:19,660
you can see my episodes of the podcast 
right there.

2396
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:21,690
I use soundcloud,
so it's through there.

2397
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:24,420
And then if you scroll down you can see 
all of my merchandise there.

2398
01:56:24,421 --> 01:56:26,750
I have t shirts and stickers and slap 
bracelets.

2399
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,370
This one just like that one.
The old school microphone.

2400
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:34,660
I'm going to have a new style coming out
soon and also I'm going to be offering 

2401
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:36,840
soon hand made mugs from a really 
amazing potter friend of mine.

2402
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:39,210
So those will be really cool.
Custom one of a kind.

2403
01:56:39,211 --> 01:56:43,110
Mugs are made in a fucking factory in 
China by slaves,

2404
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:46,050
but they're beautiful.
They're pretty cool.

2405
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:47,820
well it's Mike Maxwell,
Mike Maxwell,

2406
01:56:47,821 --> 01:56:49,230
the artist.
I really like it.

2407
01:56:49,290 --> 01:56:50,460
It's cool.
And I get to take this home,

2408
01:56:50,461 --> 01:56:51,310
right?
Oh yeah.

2409
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:54,330
Fuck yeah.
