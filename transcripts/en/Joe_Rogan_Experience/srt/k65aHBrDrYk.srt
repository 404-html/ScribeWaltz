00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,790
I'll ask him first.
That's the proper thing.

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,850
Do you not like it Brian County?
When people give away your phone number 

25
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,390
and you get a phone call and it's like,
blocked me.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,050
Pick it up at some goofball,
one

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,040
to talk to you and you're like,
Oh,

28
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:17,041
when?
When Jimmy Burke gave my number on your 

29
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:17,041
podcast,
I got like 50,

30
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,540
but it's all been really cool.
I was like,

31
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,430
look,
don't you don't abuse my number?

32
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,010
And they'd be talking like,
what the fuck man?

33
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,230
I was like,
all right young guys.

34
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:27,850
All right guys.
I remember being used.

35
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:29,830
So yeah,
look,

36
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,920
99 point nine percent of all people are 
cool.

37
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,140
I mean that sounds crazy but are out on 
the road when I,

38
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,170
when I,
when I want people to come some nights 

39
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,170
there,
they helped me out in a car rental.

40
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,170
I'll get my number,
I'll go,

41
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,051
just call me.
I'll get to healthcare with free 

42
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:46,051
tickets.
Not once.

43
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:46,051
If I hadn't had anybody abuse it.
Not,

44
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:46,051
no.

45
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:48,110
Most people don't.
Most people are cool about it,

46
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,650
but I used to.
I fucked up once and twittered my 

47
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,801
number.
It's a whole difference I was trying to 

48
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:58,340
do.
He did somebody else I forget.

49
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:03,341
I was trying to send a buddy of mine my 
number when new number it was.

50
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:08,541
I don't remember who I did is I fucked 
up instead of hitting the reply to a 

51
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,430
direct message,
somehow know that was a tweet.

52
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,810
Yeah.
I got a number from Jamaica and I was 

53
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:15,810
like,
what is this?

54
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,550
I got got to answer it and I swear to 
God I.

55
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:21,551
I'm not exactly.
I'm sure a lot of listeners have 

56
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:21,551
probably gotten this,
but I probably hit.

57
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:21,551
Everybody goes,
yeah,

58
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:22,460
yeah.
Looking for a you,

59
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,700
you've won a prize.
Really terrible.

60
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:27,060
I was like,
I haven't because you won two point $5,

61
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,570
million dollars.
I just need some.

62
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,330
I just need some,
some tax money from you.

63
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,270
One percent of that.
Then you can have the money.

64
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,980
Can I?
Can I give you a tracking number?

65
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,210
No.
I was like,

66
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,790
yes,
and it gets me.

67
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,660
I go and he goes,
can you read it back to me?

68
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,320
I read it back.
Oh,

69
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:42,520
this is exciting.
I go,

70
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,800
how much I want to get to a point.
5 million.

71
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:46,450
Congratulations.
How'd you feel?

72
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,890
I feel amazing.
This is incredible because all you have 

73
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:51,890
to do is just now we're going to have 
to.

74
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,950
You have to pay the international tax,
that's all it is.

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,160
So just a while ago.
So I only have to be one percent of two 

76
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,470
point $5.
Million Dollars I think is $250,000,000.

77
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,150
Thousand Dollars.
I don't know.

78
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:02,380
I'm really nervous.
I'm not sure,

79
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,970
but that's all I got to do is know 
Justin fucked.

80
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,040
I'm going to ask you for $25,000.
How does that sound to you?

81
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,210
I go,
this is incredible.

82
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,390
And it goes I.
and then he gives me a bunch of other 

83
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:15,390
information and I'm like,
I'm so excited.

84
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,180
I just feel like,
what did I do to get this?

85
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,680
He goes,
you ended that sweepstakes,

86
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,290
the worst job in the world.
Right?

87
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,580
And finally I go,
let me ask you a question,

88
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,360
how long I should have it?
I was,

89
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,060
I was eating at a Pf Chang's.
I was like,

90
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,250
oh fucking dumb.
Do you think he goes,

91
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,320
Bob Claude?
And he just hung up.

92
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:37,321
He just swore then pot pot English.
Well he's mad that he couldn't scam you,

93
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,130
but I mean you got a little better at 
scamming then telling me.

94
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,370
I got a huge prize.
What's incredible is that that works.

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,750
I mean,
it's incredible.

96
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:49,030
I don't,
I do not remember who was telling us,

97
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:54,031
but someone had a friend that got Dan.
I wish I remember who the hell it was,

98
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,730
but anyway,
he was saying that was it already?

99
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,510
Was it already the total assist that he 
knew a dude that thought,

100
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:05,370
I think it was already knew a dude that 
thought he won,

101
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,410
you know,
some crazy price like this because you 

102
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,161
got scammed by these Nigerian guys.
And it started getting really cunty 

103
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:12,161
like,
yeah,

104
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:13,960
you guys wait,
wait to see what I got common like.

105
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,430
And they were like,
oh my God,

106
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,930
you were saying all this while you're 
getting scammed by these Nigerian 

107
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,820
Nigerians set up fake offices and a lot 
of them are lawyers and a lot of them 

108
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,090
are really educated and so I'll set up a
fake.

109
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,240
They weren't,
they were swinging the Big Wall Street 

110
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,240
guys for a while.
Oh my God,

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,040
it's so crazy for cash,
for cash because the Wall Street guy get

112
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,330
greedy and say,
you know,

113
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,630
you want have to pay taxes on this,
but they'd have these offices that have 

114
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:39,630
all set up.
They have,

115
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,470
it'd be with Nigerian oil company,
a subsidiary,

116
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,740
and there was a big article.
Scotland Yard was all over these guys 

117
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,680
because.
And the FBI because they wiped out.

118
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,710
They really did a good job.
They had some young guys who were 

119
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,320
traders give them $2,000,000.

120
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,740
This one guy mortgaged his house and he 
killed himself window that he a lot.

121
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,640
Some people can just get.
What they would do is they would give 

122
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:08,640
you money,
they would give you.

123
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,910
They do something like give you money 
and then you would give them legit money

124
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:13,900
or something.
Whatever it was.

125
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,080
There were a lot of things to do and 
you'd get home with this money in some 

126
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,260
cases.
I'm not remember the exact story,

127
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,400
but the money was a fake die that would 
wear off like in the movies,

128
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,190
you know,
like it was a,

129
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,670
some kind of a fake.
I don't know.

130
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,960
I have no idea,
but it was just a.

131
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,300
They realized that they were,
they were,

132
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,570
that,
that had been scammed of a million 

133
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,680
dollars in jump out the window.
Commercials are an unnecessary evil or a

134
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,700
necessary evil.
Unnecessary.

135
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,400
You have to pay for bandwidth.

136
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,400
We're almost,
we're almost at high speed bandwidth 

137
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,400

138
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,370
so hopefully it's all done.
So I know the,

139
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:56,140
uh,
people complain that the Ustream version

140
00:05:56,141 --> 00:06:01,141
looks kind of poopy.
We can't really show you high if we 

141
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,590
showed it in higher definition are shit 
with crash.

142
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,710
It's whack.
I'm pretty striking.

143
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:10,190
And Idev is beautiful.
Tight skin.

144

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Is he selling?
You know what Brendan Right now is 

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,580
texting a guy that pretending to be a 
girl that's going on right there.

154
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,400
That's why he's in love.
Make it hilarious tweets right now.

155
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Tim has all the high end android phones.
If you,

156
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:50,270
um,
you know,

157
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,790
like we've talked about this before on 
the podcast a.

158
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,530
unfortunately there's no other way to 
say it,

159
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:59,531
but if you used to back in the day,
if you had a smartphone other than an 

160
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:00,860
iphone,
you were a fool.

161
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Like you really were a fool.
Like if you had one of those 

162
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,310
blackberries storms.
I had one of those pieces of shit.

163
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,520
It was terrible.
Davidoff Helena is,

164
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,680
they call me out last year.
He goes about a year,

165
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:13,610
a quick,
let's do this.

166
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:14,690
I fonts.
Fantastic.

167
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,500
Oh,
is it?

168
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,970
Oh really?
Hey,

169
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:18,770
you heard this new thing called cars you
fall.

170
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,290
Are you still riding the horse for the 
longest time?

171
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,050
If you had anything else?
It was poop.

172
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,440
But now not so much the,
uh,

173
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,830
the samsungs actually are for the first 
time ever.

174
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,380
They're out selling the iphones.
These,

175
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,110
these,
the options of the larger screens,

176
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,290
the Samsung Galaxy s three,
like the differences size of the Brian 

177
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,101
screen with the cat on it mean the other
cats though.

178
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,740
The cool desk squad cat.
I mean that is a goddamn enormous and 

179
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,130
they're really fast.
I had an old,

180
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,840
an old early version android phone and 
it was kind of clunky and Shitty,

181
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,740
but this a samsung galaxy s three.
It's amazing.

182
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,250
And that there's an s four that's coming
out now too.

183
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,760
Um,
and then they also have.

184
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,230
What's even cooler is the note that note
is amazing.

185
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,230
What is that?
Oh,

186
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:11,231
it's fucking huge.
Is this five inch phone you couldn't 

187
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:14,330
write on it really?
They're like fucking computers.

188
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Their tablets and phones all in one.
One of my first memories of view and we 

189
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,400
heard the,
one of the first times we ever hung out 

190
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,400
as I came out to see you.

191
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,690
And I had no idea you were such a tech 
nerd fighter.

192
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,730
Like know this guy I talked to and we 
were,

193
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,520
we went looking for pit bulls were 
idiots.

194
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:29,180
Right?
So,

195
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:30,770
but you were like so techie.
I kind.

196
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,480
I see these computers.
You were on the Internet.

197
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:35,060
I didn't know what the hell that was and
then you go,

198
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,020
hold on,
I gotta go to this,

199
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,050
we've got to fries or something and you 
get memory and you pop up on your 

200
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,371
computer and you put memory chips into 
your computer like you did it yourself.

201
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:50,411
And I remember being like,
this dude's I made that computer.

202
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,850
I didn't even own a computer when you 
did that back then.

203
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:56,200
That was like for awhile as I would make
my own computers.

204
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,060
I was proud of that.
Yeah.

205
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,880
Yeah,
he was,

206
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,280
he was back in before anybody.
He had huge computer screens,

207
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:08,281
like you had a whole buy monitors and 
then hook them up as computer screen.

208
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,020
Do you remember the first time?
I prefer it before I knew you could get 

209
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,020
shit on the Internet.
He's,

210
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,170
I hear in my head and I'm like,
what are you doing?

211
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:20,171
He was out down and I'm like,
why is he keeping me out of his 

212
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:20,360
computer?
And he stopped laughing what?

213
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,630
And he goes and he come and you come 
running out and I go,

214
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,260
what are you doing?
He goes,

215
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,330
okay,
run in there and look now and I go 

216
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:29,360
running and he and I hear you're going 
here and as I go,

217
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,950
I see this ass on the screen and I'm 
like,

218
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:34,400
why is that a big ass on the screen?
This is like weird and all of a sudden I

219
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:39,401
see this Japanese guy with his hair 
pulled back like a Samurai and he's 

220
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:39,401
going,
oh,

221
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:41,300
oh,
oh,

222
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,500
underneath the ass.
I go,

223
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,870
oh,
okay.

224
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:43,990
I guess he's going to eat her ass 
sweater.

225
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,320
Oh,
guess what?

226
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,680
Here comes some poor ladies and 
gentlemen,

227
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,950
and the guy pulled out of the girl 
though,

228
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,640
and Joe's going,
he's laughing,

229
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:57,641
but go ahead.
It

230
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,150
was and he made them wait.
So it would download was.

231
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,260
Yeah,
I had a t one installed in my house back

232
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:06,500
then.
Remember that God,

233
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,570
it was such a retard.
I had a t one line installed in my 

234
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,411
house.
I used to ask you to go to pit bull 

235
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:16,411
websites.
It's like dogs because I just had to 

236
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:19,871
throw away a lot of my computers and it 
was so sad because you would go through 

237
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:23,861
and look at all the video cards and look
how cool they looked back then and 

238
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:23,990
they're just shit now.
You know,

239
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,240
your iphone is a million times faster 
than that video cards.

240
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:27,500
So really incredible,
isn't it?

241
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,990
If you think about like back in the 
quake two days,

242
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,020
like quake two,
I used to have what was called a two 

243
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,940
video cards in sli formation mean 
they're both linked up.

244
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:42,941
You have to separate video cards and 
they linked together through this 

245
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:46,181
computer cable and it doubles your,
your bandwidth as far as the ability to 

246
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:46,520
offer that to you.

247
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,730
Dragged me.
Could he get fucking candles?

248
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:53,270
Are Guns for the quake thing?
Like the special kind of animals?

249
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:53,770
I was.
No,

250
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,360
no,
no,

251
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:59,361
no.
You play quake with a mouse and 

252
00:10:59,361 --> 00:10:59,361
keyboard.
Yeah.

253
00:10:59,361 --> 00:10:59,361
There was something you were playing 
where I had to,

254
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:00,320
we had to get.
There's a while.

255
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:01,010
Yeah.
You know what?

256
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:06,011
I had a controller called the something 
three deed and had a track ball and uh,

257
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,340
a gun on it as well.
It's really cool.

258
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:10,070
I came with them.
He's like,

259
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:15,071
I gotta get this,
but the track balls just not quite as 

260
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,101
accurate.
There was some guys that were really 

261
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:18,280
good with that controller,
but the thing was about that controller,

262
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:20,570
it was very controversial because you 
didn't.

263
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,330
If you learn how to use that control and
then you wouldn't be good at the mouse.

264
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:28,331
And the keyboard,
which was widely accepted by almost 

265
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:28,331
everybody to be the most accurate way.

266
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:29,570
Some guys get really good at using the 
control,

267
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:34,571
but there were still fucking themselves 
by not just going with a mouse and 

268
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:37,241
keyboard.
Would you do what you do a live quake 

269
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:37,460
match in front of an audience?
Every says Kevin prayer.

270
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,420
Yeah,
sure.

271
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:39,170
Yeah,
that'd be fun.

272
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,880
And comic con 2000.
Well,

273
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,910
if I can,
I mean it all depends on the phone if I 

274
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,401
can,
but you don't have to train for it and 

275
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:48,401
know that's the problem.
The problem is if I started training,

276
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:49,790
I would get obsessed again.
Yeah.

277
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,791
But you.
But you don't know the rush gets crazy 

278
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:54,791
rush of getting really

279
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:59,070
good at quake is it's so intense because
you're playing in these three d games 

280
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,810
where you're running down hallways,
you have a variety of weapons on you and

281
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:09,811
you're chasing motherfuckers trying to 
kill them and when you kill them they 

282
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:10,150
splatter,
you're shooting rockets at them and it's

283
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:15,151
all in real time and the graphics are 
amazing and you're seeing it through a 

284
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,991
first person perspective.
Either you're seeing a gun in front of 

285
00:12:18,991 --> 00:12:18,991
you or seemed crosshairs in front of 
you,

286
00:12:18,991 --> 00:12:23,281
but you're manipulating the character 
and the better you get at your hand eye 

287
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:23,620
coordination and your understanding of 
maps,

288
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,050
the more effectively you can just fuck 
people up.

289
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:27,250
Like there's many,
many,

290
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:29,650
many,
many levels and video game skills.

291
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,370
And I never got really good.
I got good for a regular person.

292
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:35,020
Yeah.
But I never got like really good.

293
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,560
But I played some really good guys and 
just got slow

294
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,100
when I was doing my,
uh,

295
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,170
when I was doing a hang,
not hang over a ride along that movie I 

296
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,820
shot in uh,
in Atlanta with ice cube and Kevin Hart.

297
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,210
I would go into Kevin Hart's a trailer 
all the time because it would just hang 

298
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,451
out in these hilarious and he'd be,
he and his buddies would be taking that 

299
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:57,770
madden basketball game so far.

300
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,870
King seriously,
like,

301
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,860
stay like serious,
like serious,

302
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,510
like competition

303
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,120
games and get pissed off at each other 
if they lost.

304
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:07,330
Like,
and they're really a tight group.

305
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:09,520
They love each other.
It was war.

306
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:11,530
That fucking game was war.
I come in,

307
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:12,270
Hey Kevin,
we plan.

308
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,640
I wouldn't even eat.
They're addictive.

309
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,040
Yeah,
it's super different.

310
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,900
I,
I don't fuck around with them anymore.

311
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:23,901
I still play pool.
I don't fuck around with video games 

312
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:23,910
anymore,
but I am still addicted to technology,

313
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,920
which is why like I said,
we uh,

314
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,720
we're,
we're really into ting with tim.

315
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,830
Tim provides a is not just the greatest 
android phones available,

316
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,040
but we also,
they also provide contract free cell 

317
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,540
phone service on a major network.
It's on the sprint backbone,

318
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,950
so it's not like you're not in a mom and
pop network.

319
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:45,140
You're on a,
you know,

320
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,190
a huge network and you can do that with 
no contracts and the way a sprint has 

321
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:52,850
it,
not only other,

322
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,860
no contracts,
but they give you credit on unused 

323
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,891
service.
So if you use less than you would on 

324
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:01,280
Tang sprint.
Sprint,

325
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:02,630
yeah.
Well they're using sprint.

326
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,040
Sprint doesn't have the.
Yeah.

327
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,150
Well don't go to sprint.

328
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,950
Take Jesus Christ who lets us get high 
and do commercials.

329
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,280
I want to know.
I don't know whose idea that was 

330
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,280
laughing because there's so many 
entering and so on.

331
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,380
They're awesome.
Yeah.

332
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,840
I'm ting.
Anyway,

333
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:23,841
go to [inaudible] dot ting.com
and you can save yourself 25 bucks off 

334
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:28,341
of either one of their phones or one of 
their or their service.

335
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:33,360
And what I was saying was that 10 gives 
you credit on unused service.

336
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,310
So if you use less than you thought you 
would,

337
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,570
ting actually drops you down and,
and credits you the difference on your 

338
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,240
next bill.
I mean,

339
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,000
that's unheard of.
Companies never give you the money back.

340
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:50,090
That's the ethical way to do it.
And what they realized is you can still 

341
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,350
make money and provide people

342
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,760
a great service and you know,
you don't have to fuck people over.

343
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,700
You don't have to rip them off and you 
can do things in a generous way.

344
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,260
And that's,
that's how [inaudible] operates.

345
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:01,710
And I love that.
I think it's,

346
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,110
it's a,
it's a great ethic.

347
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,960
And when you see a company that has,
you know,

348
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:08,300
that that's how they're operating their 
business,

349
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,970
it makes you feel good about being 
connected to them.

350
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:13,210
It makes you feel good about,
about what,

351
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:16,360
what message they're projecting about 
that,

352
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,690
like the ethical,
you know,

353
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:20,990
I just got sponsored to buy ting,
the Brian callen show,

354
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,960
the bride cat got some good guests.
I'm not to mention the 10 minute 

355
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:26,960
podcast,
but um,

356
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,500
uh,
the,

357
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,390
the Ting,
I,

358
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,390
when,
when they came to me,

359
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,470
I said to myself,
you know,

360
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,000
I knew there were a good company for 
you,

361
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,230
so I was like,
that's great.

362
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,350
But then I thought,
you know,

363
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,700
if you get a sponsored by,
uh,

364
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,900
you know,
somebody wants to offer you a lot of 

365
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,481
money,
say you're podcast becomes huge and 

366
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:45,480
somebody and some,
sometimes companies can become so big 

367
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:45,480
and you're not sure where their 
interests are,

368
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,201
what they're doing it,
it really does kind of raise some 

369
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:53,200
questions.
I don't want to be responsible for 

370
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,271
supporting or,
or shelling a company that doesn't have 

371
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:55,271
ethical practices,
you know,

372
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,650
it's a hard one,
but you don't have to anymore.

373
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,690
There's,
there's plenty of really good companies 

374
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,721
and I think,
I think a lot of these companies also 

375
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:06,440
operating on the Internet.
The Internet is pretty transparent.

376
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,960
It's not,
it's not difficult to compare rates and 

377
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,380
services and that with cars,
man.

378
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,310
People.
No,

379
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,970
no.
You know,

380
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,570
it's like.
And they also know that it's an.

381
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,990
He taught every company has enough to 
squeeze every last blood out of.

382
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,380
You know,
when you have something that it's 

383
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,380
required,
a service like cell phone service,

384
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,090
it becomes that weird,
creepy thing where they've got you.

385
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,010
You fucking need them.
Okay.

386
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,300
You know you need that.
It's right.

387
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:32,860
You need the mic.
Me.

388
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:37,861
Mcdonald's says that they have.
They never turned anybody but like a 

389
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:37,861
hamburger meaning.
So you go in and say,

390
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:39,140
I don't like my hamburger.
That give you a free one.

391
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:40,730
Why the hamburger?
A lot of people say,

392
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:45,731
well,
you walk in and you're not a $2 

393
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:47,471
hamburger.
The average customer in Mcdonald's 

394
00:16:47,471 --> 00:16:49,640
spends I think about $53,000
over a lifetime on Mcdonald's.

395
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,950
They're loyal customers.
So when you walked through that door,

396
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,860
you're,
you're worth $53,000.

397
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,690
That's an interesting way of living.
And so they treat you like a person,

398
00:16:56,691 --> 00:17:01,691
not a hamburger.
They don't treat you do it because they 

399
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:01,691
want to be nice.
How about that?

400
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:02,240
Oh,
that Mcdonald's,

401
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:04,490
you fucking county number count and 
assholes.

402
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,910
That's ridiculous.
How many you just do it because you 

403
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,130
don't treat someone like they're $50,000
that some companies like starbucks from 

404
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,210
what I understand,
is very responsible socially.

405
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:19,211
Like they,
they're very intent on using the money 

406
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:19,211
to make our,
to,

407
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:19,211
to,
you know,

408
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:23,861
to it.
It's a big responsibility and I think 

409
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:26,411
that you're right.
I mean just how about doing it because 

410
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:26,411
it's the right thing to do.
I just,

411
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:26,411
I,
you know,

412
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:29,840
it just makes me happy to work with 
companies that I know are not douchey.

413
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,430
I'm.
So that's how I feel about tank.

414
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,780
Go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible] dot 
com.

415
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,000
Save yourself some money.
I'm also,

416
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:40,001
we're brought to you by squarespace.
Squarespace is one of our newer 

417
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:44,231
sponsors.
If you've never been a and don't know 

418
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,351
what it is.
Squarespace is an all in one inclusive 

419
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:51,250
platform online for the average regular,
everyday smell like you or me son to go 

420
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,260
and create their own website and it's 
pretty fucking bad ass.

421
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,930
And uh,
you know,

422
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
when I first got my very first website,
a dude named menthol created it for me.

423
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,880
Menthol did most of my websites.
No,

424
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,900
I got to get in touch with him and he he
got,

425
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,930
he got super busy.
You had a lot of things going on in his 

426
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,991
personal life into when he was a guy 
used to play quake with an extreme 

427
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:22,671
detriment.
We had a quick glance and you can train 

428
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:22,671
you.

429
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:22,880
Her name was extreme.

430
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,090
A little bit better than me.
When we played quick.

431
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:28,100
He always just a little bit better than 
me.

432
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,900
He was good.
He played really good.

433
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,320
We can have a comedy show podcast going 
around you while you're.

434
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,470
I am terrified of.
It sounds so ridiculous,

435
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:40,830
but I'm terrified of becoming addicted 
to playing video games going and you get

436
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:42,750
excited about.
I don't even know if you just get.

437
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,700
I love when you get really excited one 
time.

438
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,660
Remember you were like,
you were like,

439
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,810
we were like 30 and you're like,
look at this t shirt.

440
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,410
There was a ufc tee shirts,
like a fight,

441
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,550
this race car,
this thing,

442
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,050
this is a workout.
It's a book and then he just.

443
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,390
There was a pause and you go,
I'm 12.

444
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,020
So fucking great because we're all 
looking at you.

445
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:06,560
Like I didn't work kind of idiots too,
but Jesus wasn't overboard.

446
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,950
Really excited over a designer on a tee 
shirt.

447
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,910
Dude,
I'd get really good

448
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,030
excited about the newest video games 
coming out.

449
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,090
I've always been very child.
Just replace your pool obsession with 

450
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,290
your quake,
obsessing with the kids more.

451
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,620
Don't want to do it.
And they were like,

452
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,130
no,
I'm not.

453
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:26,131
I don't go.
I played pool maybe one night a week if 

454
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:26,131
that.
Do you remember when we were.

455
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:30,600
We were hunting and,
and I remember I think you said or 

456
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:30,600
something.
I was like,

457
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,130
I don't need a lot of sleep out here 
because we,

458
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,450
we're,
we're so not like I really.

459
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,240
The amount of stimulus we're exposed to,
we're inundated.

460
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,480
It's crazy.
We're not designed for this,

461
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,600
that's for sure.
We're.

462
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,410
We were designed for what you 
experienced when you go camping.

463
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,380
That's what we're designed for.
We're designed to take in nature.

464
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,620
We're not designed for Times Square.
The human body does not know what the 

465
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:52,620
fuck to do with Times Square.

466
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,610
The human body sees giant billboards and
just goes,

467
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,110
oh,
your whole system is out of whack.

468
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:00,010
You're like,
Oh fuck,

469
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:01,950
am I even looking at what about you?
Well,

470
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,580
what am I looking at when I'm going to 
the movies?

471
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:05,810
What am I looking at when I'm,
what am I dealing with?

472
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:09,490
And I'm listening to songs that,
the input that we received today,

473
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:11,170
so we're not designed for any of this 
shit.

474
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,880
Our bodies not caught up to what 
technology can do you fucks.

475
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,790
That's why they.
There's one theory about autism kids,

476
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,380
kids who have hyperactive minds and,
and um,

477
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,710
central nervous systems that maybe we're
evolving.

478
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,880
We're literally evolving with technology
because I totally believe that.

479
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,180
I totally believe that it makes sense.
I mean,

480
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,910
I think it's terrifying for people 
because we love our emotions,

481
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,360
but I think the reality is we're 
probably going to eventually outgrow 

482
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,360
them.

483
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,010
Oh Shit.
Did I say that I was having fun alive.

484
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,010
I've

485
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,620
squarespace.
You're dirty fox.

486
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,320
Keep hope alive.
This was supposed to be an ad.

487
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,470
I'm making a website right now.
We went off the rails pretty cool.

488
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:59,471
You could just pretty much pick a theme,
what you want your website to look like 

489
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,070
out of a bunch of different things.
And then like if you're watching right 

490
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,460
now,
I'm just pretty much making a website

491
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,910
as you sit here talking to me.
Yeah.

492
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,310
Yeah.
It's so ridiculously easy to say.

493
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,020
You just hit this to change the title.
Okay.

494
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,620
Look at this.
All right.

495
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,930
When she a fucking love it.
I want to do it.

496
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:21,290
I should trade to create my own website.
And that's now the name of your new 

497
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:25,380
website.
Yeah,

498
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:26,610
it's my new website.
I like it.

499
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,740
That's a good.
That's a catchy blog title.

500
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,070
I want Dolphin butthole.
I mean who could forget that sooner or 

501
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,290
that guy has got something to say.

508
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,430
Um,

509
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,090
abilities that's really a bad ass and 
easy to use.

Super easy to set up your own online 
store.

511
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,850
You could do it ridiculously fast.

they offer 24 slash seven support.

00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,460
Your site will look great on any device.
Like you can have it on an iphone,

514
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:24,930
an IPAD,
a computer.

515
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,600
It's gonna look sweet.
They know what the fuck they're doing.

516
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:29,400
I mean,
it's really incredible.

517
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,640
The.
This used to be so hard to do.

518
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,060
My God,
making a website at one point in time 

519
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,230
was just completely outside of the realm
of my,

520
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,690
my even thinking.
Brian just made a website.

521
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:43,410
Okay,
look,

522
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,240
I want dolphin butthole.
There it is.

523
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,500
Okay.
He just did that.

524
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:49,350
He made a fucking website.
I mean in the time we're doing this,

525
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,160
this conversation,
he made a website that shit's real.

526
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,200
And look,
I could make a store right now I guess 

527
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,200
manage products and now I'm selling 
Dolphin Butthole Lube.

528
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,500
I forgot to tweet that.
I'm doing the job

529
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,990
bikes and skis and shit.
He just started selling skis from his 

530
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,780
store.
This is madness.

531
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:09,781
This is like World War z.
But with technology it's not zombies,

532
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:12,220
but it's websites.
They're just fucking.

533
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,340
Every 12 seconds you've got a new one.
Anyway,

534
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,540
go to squarespace.squarespace.com.
Excuse me,

535
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,720
that's squarespace.com
forward slash joe and use the offer code

536
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,860
Joe and the number three and you can get
10 percent.

537
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,330
Is it number four now?
Because it's April.

538
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,320
Oh,
it's April,

539
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:34,050
right?
Yeah,

540
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,060
he probably use for use for Jesus 
Christ,

541
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,150
but use it.
It's cool company and a cool product and

542
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:43,950
it really works.
You know,

543
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,890
so if you're looking make your own 
website.

544
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,580
I say go fall.
I bet.

545
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,740
I think it's interesting to your your 
advertising things.

546
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:54,620
I wanted to say to your fans,
you guys liked to laugh.

547
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:57,620
I don't know if any of you out there 
that you do in a show.

548
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:01,430
Anyway.
Brian Campbell is a weird question.

549
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,680
I am in fact this Friday,
Saturday and Sunday at laugh out loud 

550
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,430
and San Antonio,
Texas.

551
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,080
Laugh out loud.
Lol.

552
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,510
San Antonio Dot com for tickets.
You best?

553
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:16,160
It's San Antonio.
It's a gangster town's website.

554
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:18,170
If you're listening to this later,
has always tour dates,

555
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:23,171
podcasts,
photos and videos on it and it's just 

556
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,121
Brian Cohen.com.
And listen to 10 minute podcasts in the 

557
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:26,120
Brian Cowen show.
We got a good one to 10 minute podcast.

558
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:31,121
I talked about and I confessed to 
killing a dolphin and the boys have to 

559
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:31,580
talk me off the ledge.
That's not true.

560
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,080
I would never do that,
but I'm on the Brian Council.

561
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,690
I did interview a really interesting guy
and it's up now.

562
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:41,950
Vincent Labarbera,
who is a defense lawyer could fit.

563
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:47,070
Let's talk about it.
Let's get through this commercial I'm 

564
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,070
talking about.
Yeah.

565
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,070
I would love to.
This.

566
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,010
This is going to be missing from the 
Sirius satellite broadcast.

567
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,190
He's a bad ass enough data on INC com.
So last sponsor.

568
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,950
We're at a chimp kettlebells.
Sorry.

569
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,060
No,
I won't listen.

570
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,060
I told you motherfuckers.
Okay.

571
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:04,061
It's hard.
Hard to make these things hard to keep 

572
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:04,061
these bitches and stock.
They went flying out because there's.

573
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:05,940
They're so cool looking.
I went,

574
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:08,300
by the way.
You know why I'm a good friend because I

575
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:10,780
don't call you up and say,
I saw that night.

576
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:12,910
I don't know who to give me some chimp 
Kettlebell.

577
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,780
No,
I'm buying them.

578
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,150
I'm like,
everybody else.

579
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,570
I'm getting one to Donald Cowboy cerrone
to.

580
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,260
I wanted my man right there.

581
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,810
Look,
it needs to be given away to some people

582
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:28,811
that she was just too cool not to have.
It looks like a chimp biting off your 

583
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:31,811
Dick.
That is the chimp biting off your Dick 

584
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:33,260
face and do for motivation for 
motivation and your workouts.

585
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,590
You know,
you could hold the kettle bells like 

586
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,021
that,
looking at the chimp and then drop it 

587
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:43,110
down to your Dick and then push away.
Drop the guys your Dick and they push,

588
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,270
motivate.
It can be the new kettle bell routine 

589
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:48,270
like the,
uh,

590
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,350
the chimp bite your Dick kip ups or 
something there.

591
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:55,600
I just read a book called our inner ape 
and he talks about how we're a bipolar,

592
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:57,710
a bunny comparisons to chimps and 
gorillas,

593
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,010
but one of the things that they use 
today at a circus of thing where they 

594
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,891
had a chimp that they muscled and they 
took strong men and tried to control 

595
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:07,490
that chimp trying to wrestle with it.
None of them.

596
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,410
None of that.

597
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,630
It's got four hands look forehands yeah,
and the amount of strength five times 

598
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,170
the point.
We don't even understand it.

599
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:19,550
It's just we think,
well,

600
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:21,160
they're about our size,
so you know,

601
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:21,830
like,
you know,

602
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,690
you're dealing with something completely
different.

603
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:26,710
It's just completely different.
But if you want to get chimps drawn,

604
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,580
go get yourself some other shit that we 
have.

605
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:33,581
We have regular kettlebell still like 
the God that was April fool's fucking 

606
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,700
foul and Joey Diaz fucking Kettlebell.
That's so ridiculous.

607
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,760
I love it.
I want it.

608
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,010
We have a club bells.
We started selling those now and Chin up

609
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,450
bars and all kinds of different fitness 
shit.

610
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,620
And uh,
of course,

611
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,770
a lot of great fitness supplements 
including hemp force,

612
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,800
the delicious and nutritious hemp 
protein supplement and as raw maca and 

613
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,150
raw or raw cocoa and MCA.
And um,

614
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,150
it's sweetened with Stevia.
Says very little sugar.

615
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,790
There's only one gram of sugar in a full
serving.

616
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,740
It's fucking delicious.
Super good for you.

617
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,100
And we have to get it from Canada 
because our county twat bad government 

618
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,230
says it's illegal to grow the non 
psychoactive version of his marijuana.

619
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,500
You can't grow it.
So these silly bitches,

620
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,390
so we have to buy it from Canada.
But,

621
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,890
uh,
it's super good for you.

622
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,570
It really easy to digest.
I love it.

623
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:27,750
In the morning,
if I don't have the time to put together

624
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,510
a Kale shake,
I'm just fucking running out the door.

625
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,850
I take one of those seats.
Oil,

626
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,110
coconut waters.
I throw in some hemp force.

627
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,090
Boom.
It's not like a lot of food,

628
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:38,790
but it gives,
it fills me up.

629
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,500
It's nutritious.
It's easy to digest,

630
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,940
it's super easy to digest.
You getting some nutrition,

631
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:47,700
like couldn't attrition in a,
in a small forum.

632
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,980
And it's great after workouts too.
Anyway.

633
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,000
[inaudible] DOT com.
Oh.

634
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,290
And,
and it,

635
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,630
um,
if you use the code name Brogan,

636
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,270
you will save 10 percent off any and all
supplements.

637
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,500
All right,
we got through it.

638
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,390
Brian.
Counselor,

639
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,350
we're going to.
We're already getting busy.

640
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,280
So it's a place that music first right 
now.

641
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,320
Oh yeah.

642
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,160
My voice is.
His name is breakable beats and you can 

643
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,400
find them on sound,
sound speeds.

644
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,400
And it really starts off putting because
it talks about.

645
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,550
And then it goes right into the,
here's the,

646
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,590
here's the breakdown being terrible.

647
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,500
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.

648
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,950
That is one of the most surprising 
things about podcasting is the amount of

649
00:29:39,021 --> 00:29:41,560
cool shit that people do on their own.
You know,

650
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,010
people

651
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,810
create funny.
A youtube compilations

652
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,390
did I have these guys in San Antonio and
I can't remember the name there.

653
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,910
I'm going to try to find them to give a 
shout out,

654
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:55,911
but they tweaked them to be in San 
Antonio and these guys create a whole 

655
00:29:55,911 --> 00:30:00,040
video devoted to Brian Callan and,
and no console out.

656
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,460
No consequences,
no guns allowed.

657
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,300
And I was dying.
They made like a three minute,

658
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,600
like really well done.
Put together videos.

659
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:10,320
So commercial for you?
Yeah.

660
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:15,350
They made a commercial for me and on 
twitter and it's trying to find them 

661
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,990
because they were so awesome.
And uh,

662
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
and anyway,
I'll,

663
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,150
I'll,
I'll,

664
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:23,151
I'll just give a shout out when we,
but I mean that's what the internet 

665
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:23,151
does.
You get a bunch of guys who are like,

666
00:30:23,151 --> 00:30:24,990
dude,
let's make a video for them advertising.

667
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:26,190
I was,
I was dying.

668
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,930
You guys are coming to my show for free 
by the way.

669
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,090
Just come up to me and telling me that 
you did it.

670
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,440
Not everybody will be like,

671
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,270
yeah,
you got to say,

672
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,970
are you getting any proof man?
Need to do another one?

673
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,380
Right.
I know the guys,

674
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:40,190
but I know what they look like.
It's a great thing,

675
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:41,390
man.
It's great.

676
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,780
Democratizing force and I have a 
beautiful voice.

677
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:47,720
I didn't realize that.
So I think they put some of that fucking

678
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,780
crazy shit and electronic music thing.
What's it called?

679
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,110
Yeah,
Auditorium.

680
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,640
They all turned the fuck out of.
You know,

681
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,670
they didn't decide.
I say Jay Z,

682
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:09,470
who uses that auto tune shit t pain.
I think I sound like Josh Groban.

683
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,450
I don't even know what that guy sounds 
like.

684
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,200
I when I read it,
yes you do.

685
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:22,060
I'm trying to find.
I would not be able to pick it out of a 

686
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,060
lineup and you know,
if you played it for me,

687
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,780
it wasn't him.
You would get me.

688
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,230
You can sell me a fucking album with 
johnny to tone from down the block 

689
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:33,580
saying,
if you could be one rock'n'roll front 

690
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:33,580
man of all time,
what would it be?

691
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,940
Oh Jesus.
It's tough to fuck with David Lee Roth.

692
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,390
It's tough to fuck with diamond.
Dave about it,

693
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,580
like when it comes to front man,
dude,

694
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,840
there was some years in the 19 eighties,
like 84 85 through the jump era,

695
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,580
they dominated,
dominated,

696
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,910
dominated,
which was incredible.

697
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,070
I mean,
it's no wonder they broke up.

698
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,380
They,
they,

699
00:31:58,381 --> 00:32:01,560
they were hitting it so hard.
Of course they all lost their mind.

700
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,330
I spent time at Diamond Dave.
Oh yeah.

701
00:32:05,331 --> 00:32:05,470
And

702
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,120
He,
uh,

703
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,910
he had some real,
had real conversations like three,

704
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,580
like two hours long.
And he,

705
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,880
because he used to rent up David Offs,
the apartment above David,

706
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,710
he had a building dove had and he used 
to rent from Doug Davidoff above him and

707
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:24,060
he basically would practice karate.
He had his helicopters license.

708
00:32:24,061 --> 00:32:27,690
He was an emt,
a real dramatic and saved lives.

709
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,760
He'd be,
he had to pull somebody out of a car and

710
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:31,630
they'd be like,
you're David diddly wrong buck.

711
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,430
And he was like,
ah,

712
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,530
but he told us these great stories and 
um,

713
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,540
he,
he like,

714
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,100
he's very,
very spartan,

715
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,190
like he has a bowl and a and

716
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,590
sometimes he'd sleep on the roof outside
in a tent.

717
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,150
He's just a real like,
you know,

718
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,850
that's very unusual day.
He's not in debt money or anything.

719
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:49,790
It's got living in a really small 
apartment in Tokyo now.

720
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:54,850
There it is.
He came on the podcast and talk to us 

721
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:54,850
about.
He's been living in Tokyo for 10 months.

722
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:55,490
Really?
Yeah.

723
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,640
This is what a trip this guy is.
He was.

724
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,170
They were going to do some shows in 
Tokyo and I go,

725
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:01,900
how many flight for how long?
He's like,

726
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,710
we're going to do about two weeks in 
Tokyo.

727
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,120
I'm like,
okay.

728
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,540
He went for 10 months.
For 10 months.

729
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:13,360
He said that Eddie got sick and so when 
they had to postpone,

730
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:17,030
it took a long time for them to be able 
to reschedule because it's a big tour.

731
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:22,031
Sure.
So when Eddie got second and they 

732
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:22,031
rescheduled,
he said,

733
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:22,031
well,
Hey,

734
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:23,030
I'll just go over there and see what 
it's like.

735
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,740
So he fucking moves to Tokyo.
He used to Kayak around Manhattan.

736
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,560
Yeah.
What are you gonna do today?

737
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:33,650
I'm going to Kayak around Manhattan.
The crack around Manhattan,

738
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:36,290
the island of Manhattan Kayak in the 
river.

739
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,650
He's.
He does what he wants when he's taken 

740
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,760
sword classes.
Oh yeah.

741
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,360
That's what he's doing is taking sword 
fighting classes and learning Japanese.

742
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,190
So he came over here.
He's speaking Japanese and telling them,

743
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,920
telling us about his fucking sword 
fight.

744
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:56,921
He's 58.
Well he refers to karate is cut out to 

745
00:33:56,921 --> 00:33:59,810
my favorite when I studied get out to 
for many years.

746
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:02,840
In fact I studied so long.
I feel as though I am good at.

747
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,240
Well he has a legit martial arts 
background.

748
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:06,680
There's no doubt about that.
Like he,

749
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,230
he definitely liked.
I remember he would throw kicks,

750
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,700
like when he would do shows,
I'm like,

751
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:12,530
that guy can move his fucking box.

752
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,480
Can do the splits.
Yeah.

753
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,880
He would throw these crazy high kicks in
and you're like,

754
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:18,470
Holy Shit.
Like you can't.

755
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:23,471
Like the way he was throwing kicks was 
like a guy who's trained martial arts 

756
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:23,471
and seriously,
yeah.

757
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:26,690
Yeah.
A lot in and trained very hard in really

758
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:27,980
good shape.
He's in great shape,

759
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:28,600
man.
It's just,

760
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,980
it's interesting to meet a guy like 
that.

761
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:36,010
It's like this 58 year old sorta.
God just still does whatever the fuck 

762
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,060
you want to go to Japan,
you know,

763
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:39,050
fuck it.
I think.

764
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:40,280
Yeah,
I think what happens though,

765
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,260
when you,
when you've hit the apex of fame,

766
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:43,940
like when you're a rock star on his 
level,

767
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:47,630
you're the biggest that you don't get 
more famous than that.

768
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:49,870
You just don't on earth on earth,
on earth man.

769
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,770
And uh,
and,

770
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:53,120
and just to play the stadiums and just 
they go crazy.

771
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,840
And I think once you do that and you're,
you kind of,

772
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,810
if you're an interested person in the 
world,

773
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,450
you realize that it's like you get 
immune to that.

774
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,890
You actually,
I think you'd get immune to it.

775
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:08,891
I think you'd get immune to that public 
and brace and then you've got to find 

776
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:12,131
some way else to keep yourself inspired 
and excited and interested in,

777
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,530
you know,
um,

778
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,740
that sounds like what he,
what he does,

779
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:20,741
man.
That's why he's got such varied 

780
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:20,741
interests,
man.

781
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:20,741
He's such a,
such an interesting dude.

782
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:22,970
I've got him on my phone right now.
I've got their greatest hits.

783
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:28,210
I was just listening to them like diver 
down to some of those songs running with

784
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:31,640
the devil.
Oh God.

785
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,110
Damn.
Those were good songs.

786
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:34,610
Unbelievable.
It just.

787
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,490
But they were so big that it's no wonder
that they broke up.

788
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,160
It's like,
who the fuck knows how to manage that?

789
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Like I was having a conversation with 
someone about Justin bieber where 

790
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:46,680
they're like,
you know,

791
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,710
do what he did.
He did this the other day and that 

792
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:51,710
happened the other day.
I'm like,

793
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,960
do you know how fucking crazy I would be
if I was Justin Bieber?

794
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:58,320
That kid's holding it together.
Rum Markup Markup.

795
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,140
They.
Yeah.

796
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,180
When I was 18 and 19 years old,
if I had $100,000,000

797
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:05,160
on a fucking Ferrari,
I right now,

798
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,180
Bro,
right now talking to her right now,

799
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,770
I'd be a mess.
Yeah.

800
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:14,000
I mean the kid's fine.
He's fine.

801
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,560
So he spit on somebody who knows what 
happened,

802
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:19,050
really knows when you're constantly 
surrounded by people.

803
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,130
Oh,
he's a nice guy.

804
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,220
He was in the laugh factory.
He was in that pain.

805
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:27,230
The crowd on a Tuesday night and and 
Donna Eric gets onstage and Justin's up 

806
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:27,480
there and he goes,
just,

807
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:28,710
and it must have been really hard for 
you,

808
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:29,910
but you know,
before you made it,

809
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,950
that one tough year when you were like 
14.

810
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,710
Fucking great.
There is also comes up with one liners 

811
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,800
like just off the top of his head.
He's an animal.

812
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,820
He's,
he's so fucking legit fucking dumb.

813
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,390
Stand up for 100 years and a high level.
I always love to remind dom that I paid 

814
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:54,150
to see him before I ever did comedy 
myself.

815
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,300
Saturday.
Yeah,

816
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,740
I remember his jokes.
I did his job.

817
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,210
Got I paid to see him in Nick's comedy.
Stop.

818
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:05,211
I actually went two nights in a row 
because he missed his flight or 

819
00:37:05,211 --> 00:37:08,811
something like that on the first night.
And so that was how I found out about 

820
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:12,501
Denis leary had.
Dennis leary went up that night and I 

821
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:12,501
was like,
who is this guy?

822
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:15,360
Where the fuck is dominant?
I painted seat down my rarer.

823
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,470
Well,
something happened.

824
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:18,570
There was like a missed flight or 
something along those lines.

825
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,400
So I was like,
God,

826
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:23,040
this guy who's this guy was like so 
bummed out,

827
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,070
but he fucking destroyed.

828
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,530
He destroyed no care,
care for cancer.

829
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:34,810
I mean this is before I knew anything 
about the plagiarism or anything about 

830
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:38,421
the bad things you hear about leary.
All I knew then I didn't even know who 

831
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:40,540
he was,
but he went on and fucking amazing.

832
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,870
He was like my favorite comedian for 
like six months.

833
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:44,640
Incredible.
When you see somebody who's that good at

834
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:49,641
something you don't stand up for the 
first time and you have like maybe 

835
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:53,270
designs on what?
Like I just did this interview just now 

836
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,020
today for the San Antonio thing and I 
literally said to the guy,

837
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:57,720
I said,
I still can't believe I can do standup.

838
00:37:57,721 --> 00:38:02,721
I can't believe I'm lucky enough.
I truly lucky enough to go around the 

839
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:06,090
country and make people laugh.
I can't believe I have that capacity.

840
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:11,091
Like the great surprise of my life was 
waking up one day and realizing I think 

841
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:13,230
maybe I can do this if I really 
practice.

842
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,370
You know what I mean?
It's like,

843
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,410
when did you,
when did you come to that?

844
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,570
I will always thought you always knew 
you could do.

845
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:19,650
No Man.
No,

846
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:21,810
I was a silly goose always as you know.
But um,

847
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,770
I remember I a Patty Jenkins,
my old,

848
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,600
my old girlfriend,
the director said,

849
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,280
Brian,
I got,

850
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,310
I made a speech or something at a 
wedding or something and I was funny and

851
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,110
she said,
I got three words for you dude.

852
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,100
Stand up comedy.
You're not

853
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,920
going to walk into a room as this guy or
that like,

854
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,400
whoa,
that guy's really unique.

855
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:44,401
He's five foot 11,
165 pounds with Brown eyes and Brown 

856
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:44,401
hair,
you know,

857
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,420
you're,
you're not going to go in there looking 

858
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:49,420
like you said,
but you're funny.

859
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,710
And she got me to start doing it.
And I was like,

860
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:53,110
I can't do this.
But I went home and wrote a monologue on

861
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:54,940
what it's like to be reborn.
A penguin,

862
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,490
a legless flightless bird in the middle 
of the South Pole.

863
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,170
And I was like,
that's kind of a funny idea.

864
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,340
Concept.
I don't know.

865
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:05,610
And I wrote it and I,
I came up to my friends at night and I 

866
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:05,610
said,
hey,

867
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,870
I heard this comic doing these jokes and
I pretended it was somebody else.

868
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,530
And they laughed.
And that's slowly how I built a set.

869
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,690
That's a good way of doing it.

870
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,210
And that's so like your personality to 
do that.

871
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,000
You're not really a self congratulatory 
God.

872
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,280
Terrible.
That's,

873
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,610
that's what you would do.
You would,

874
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:25,330
you would congratulate someone else.
Make a pre pretend character.

875
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,830
Oh,
my friend is so funny.

876
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,030
He says,
that's so funny.

877
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:30,100
I do have so hard.
And I was like,

878
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:34,300
I think I'm onto something very clever 
way to begin standing up,

879
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:38,470
kind of like to practice on people.
I would do that with some of the,

880
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,510
this common cat guy with that.
I don't know what he looks like.

881
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:43,270
He had red hair and I do the joke.
This was all before I met you.

882
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,070
Yes.
Yeah.

883
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,540
When I met you,
you were doing comedy a little bit.

884
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,940
You were,
but you had gotten into the door.

885
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,400
And it's,
and I don't blame anybody for this,

886
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:53,170
but there's,
there's a,

887
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:58,230
uh,
an attitude that exists or at least it 

888
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,291
used to when you got a series or got 
some sort of a sitcom stopped when you 

889
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:01,900
could stop doing your stand up.

890
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,530
You know,
I actually had a good friend and a guy I

891
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:07,810
respect very much said to me,
you know,

892
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:09,400
who's a producer?
And I was like,

893
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,560
are you talking about like,
what are you,

894
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,760
this is,
I'm just doing this for money like 

895
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,410
crazy.
Stand up is the greatest thing in the 

896
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:19,410
world for you to,
you don't know because you've never done

897
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:19,410
it.
And you know,

898
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,460
and even if you do it and you suck at 
it,

899
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,790
if there's a possibility that you can 
get good enough to be good at it,

900
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,590
stick with that shit so much fun.
It's way better than the activity.

901
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:31,540
Also a constant challenge.
Like if you're a Rockstar,

902
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,390
you can sing the same song for 30 years.
The stones can still sing.

903
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,590
Start me up.
And everybody cheers.

904
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,870
You fucking stand up.
You've got to reinvent yourself.

905
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:38,930
When they come to see you,
they,

906
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,450
they,
they want to see a new bag of tricks,

907
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:40,690
bro.

908
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:45,710
Oh yeah.
They're not there to like see your do 

909
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:45,710
your greatest hits.
Yeah.

910
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,960
I put on my special whenever it was a 
couple months ago.

911
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,140
I don't remember.
I'm not doing a single bit from that.

912
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,290
That's it.
It's all done.

913
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:53,590
That shit's dead and burdens what I'm.
All my stuff is no fun to do though,

914
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:54,660
man.
Because uh,

915
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,410
I,
I,

916
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,420
you know,
I've been inspired by quite a few guys 

917
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,960
that do that on a regular basis.
Bill Burr does on a regular basis.

918
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:07,140
Louis CK does on a regular basis and I 
think he got a lot of people thinking 

919
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,951
that way.
Like just throw me thinking and come up 

920
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:12,340
with the Nh totally right.
Because what you really want to see is a

921
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:14,920
lot of different material from 
comedians.

922
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,990
It's also keeps you in a really active 
stays in line.

923
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,800
Like I've really learned how to write 
anywhere no matter what.

924
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:25,801
And I'm always thinking of new stuff.
So we decided like how hard we can push 

925
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:25,801
ourselves.
Like,

926
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:26,530
Oh God,
I knew our a year.

927
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:27,490
I couldn't do it.
Yeah,

928
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,760
you probably could.
You probably could just fucking go to 

929
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,040
work and then when you do do it,
like when are coming up with new

930
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,790
stuff.
It's so.

931
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:39,791
It's so exciting.
It's like the shows have a different 

932
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:40,940
energy to them because you're still 
laughing at the shit too.

933
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:45,020
It's like it's still hitting you like,
and I don't know how you are when you're

934
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:47,510
creating material,
but when I'm creating a material,

935
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:49,070
I don't even know where the fuck it's 
coming from.

936
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,760
I never feel like it's mine.
I never do it.

937
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:56,790
It's a beautiful notion that you're a 
channel for something that already 

938
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:56,790
exists,
you know?

939
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:00,510
Well,
I think it's because the only way to 

940
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,261
truly use your creativity correctly is 
to take your sense of you out of the 

941
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:07,151
equation.
So it's not really that you're tapping 

942
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:09,620
into a muse per se,
as to take you out of the equation,

943
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:13,460
allows all the creativity to sort of 
appear and unfold.

944
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,620
It's you.
This idea of you.

945
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:20,650
Ego is such an overwhelmingly 
constricting mindset.

946
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,310
You know,
and then let me,

947
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:27,311
let me,
let me piggyback on that before you go 

948
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:27,311
on to this.
I love this.

949
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:27,311
I love what you're saying.
And,

950
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,610
and,
and when you say ego,

951
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,290
a lot of that for you young people.
Let me get specific and I think a lot of

952
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,320
is we all define ourselves on very 
strong lines.

953
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:41,321
Men especially in this society are told 
to define yourself along strong lines.

954
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:41,860
You know,
I'm,

955
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:43,160
I'm a fighter,
I'm a tough guy.

956
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:48,161
You can't push me whatever it might be.
I'm a musician that comes with a lot of 

957
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:51,020
baggage and I think that that one of the
nice things about trying to learning how

958
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:52,930
to create is to loosen those lines a 
little.

959
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,440
Don't try to define yourself,
don't have.

960
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,820
You don't have to be right.
Don't,

961
00:42:55,821 --> 00:42:59,060
don't pigeon hole yourself into a tough 
guy or I'm this guy,

962
00:42:59,061 --> 00:42:59,300
right?

963
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,890
No,
not when you're creating.

964
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,190
And it goes back to what you said,
take yourself out of the equation.

965
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:09,310
Well,
people try to define themselves because 

966
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:09,310
they're insecure.
You know what I mean?

967
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,130
That's how when I was a young man and I 
was insecure,

968
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:12,680
this one I tried to,
I tried to define myself.

969
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:14,750
I would try to pretend to be somebody I 
would try to,

970
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,990
you know,
as much as I wanted to be an individual,

971
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:21,200
complete individual.
I certainly wasn't good at it,

972
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:22,360
but,
you know,

973
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:27,361
at the end it's also like I was just,
I just played volleyball with Brendan 

974
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:27,361
Schaub,
mayhem,

975
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:30,470
Miller and uh,
my buddy Kiran all fighters and,

976
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:31,130
you know,
obviously,

977
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,320
and I'm sitting there looking at the 
fucking,

978
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:33,820
like,
just,

979
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,410
you know,
Jason's been fighting for 15 years,

980
00:43:36,411 --> 00:43:39,290
retired now,
but he's still a fucking rough athletic,

981
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:41,100
big guide.
I'm looking at fucking shop.

982
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,540
Should have a statue.
I should have a statue built to him that

983
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:45,320
I can just,
you know.

984
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,020
And,
and,

985
00:43:46,021 --> 00:43:51,021
um,
you're looking at what the fuck are you 

986
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:51,021
talking?
I'm gay.

987
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:51,021
I'm gay.
I'm straight.

988
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:51,530
I just want to talk about Brendan.
I get very good.

989
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:56,930
No,
but I'm looking at how big and strong 

990
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:56,930
these guys.
And I thought to myself,

991
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,890
there's always somebody stronger.
There's always somebody stronger than 

992
00:43:59,890 --> 00:43:59,890
those guys.
And,

993
00:43:59,890 --> 00:43:59,890
and by the way,
no,

994
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,460
that's not true.
There's going to be one strongest guy.

995
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,180
It's gotta be it's gotta be this and 
that.

996
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:08,230
It's not a,
there's always gonna be someone brings 

997
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,230
me to my point,
which is the idea that,

998
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,320
you know,
there,

999
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,900
there's not a real difference in some 
ways between me and sharp or somebody 

1000
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:16,910
who's really big in the sense that yes,
they're stronger,

1001
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:18,920
but we're all compared to somebody else.

1002
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,920
We're all kind of like,
depending on what context you're 

1003
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,430
standing in,
I'm stronger than this guy over here.

1004
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:27,710
He's stronger than me.
You really think about this shit.

1005
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:28,670
Yeah.
Why?

1006
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,240
Well,
I was just thinking about how we,

1007
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,140
we,
we kind of,

1008
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:36,330
we,
I was thinking about how we try to kind 

1009
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:36,330
of aim for certain things,
but you're 45,

1010
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,750
seven as an example.
I'm just using an example of anything 

1011
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,841
you do.
Like if you're a musician you want to 

1012
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:44,841
play like that guy.
I'm just saying that it,

1013
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:46,740
the,
the only thing that matters is that as a

1014
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:51,741
false,
that is a false way of going about 

1015
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:53,991
things.
All you can do is control your own 

1016
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:53,991
expression and who you are.
That's all you can do is go.

1017
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,780
There is no the idea of a comparing to 
something bigger or something that is an

1018
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:02,781
illusion almost.
It's the only thing you can do is get 

1019
00:45:02,781 --> 00:45:02,781
it.

1020
00:45:02,781 --> 00:45:06,110
Try to not dilute who you are.
You want to keep it as.

1021
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,790
Because it's so hard to say.
Saying that and doing that.

1022
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:09,870
It's like,
what is he saying?

1023
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,710
So what does he mean?
You know?

1024
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:16,790
It's just,
you got to know that your ego will fuck 

1025
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,481
you up your ego even though you feel 
like it's part of you and you feel like 

1026
00:45:20,481 --> 00:45:24,801
it's good to have it protect you,
so you're bullshit yourself about 

1027
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:28,431
things.
It's super important to know when you 

1028
00:45:28,431 --> 00:45:29,970
fuck up and not be in denial because 
when you're in denial,

1029
00:45:29,971 --> 00:45:32,790
it sets you back because no one's 
perfect.

1030
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,180
I'm not perfect.
You're not perfect.

1031
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:35,790
There's not a single perfect human 
being.

1032
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:38,880
The idea is ridiculous because it's like
you don't.

1033
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,100
You're a different person depending on 
when I catch you,

1034
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:46,130
you're a different person depending on 
what time of the day and you know and 

1035
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:46,130
what,
what,

1036
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,910
what happened to you recently or you 
know,

1037
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,550
what bad thing has gone down in your 
life.

1038
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,640
You're a different person in every 
minute of every day,

1039
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,120
300,
65 days in a way like,

1040
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:56,850
you know,
trying to,

1041
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:58,590
trying to say,
this is who I am.

1042
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:02,190
I'm a tough guy or on this.
You've got to just learn from mistakes.

1043
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,340
Always of course have the ethic of,
you know,

1044
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:07,290
just trying to be a good person who's 
trying to be nice.

1045
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:07,950
Try not to.
Yeah,

1046
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:08,880
but.
Well let me ask you this.

1047
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,910
Like you were saying,
and I was thinking about this the other 

1048
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:13,910
day,
you know,

1049
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:16,560
nobody's perfect.
You can try to strive for perfection.

1050
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,150
It's kind of a good thing.
You don't ever reach it,

1051
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:20,580
but the idea is you can imagine what 
perfection isn't a way.

1052
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,320
Like you ever feel that way.
You ever feel like,

1053
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,680
you know,
like you're doing this thing which is 

1054
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,400
stand up and you keep putting out stuff 
in your mind's eye.

1055
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,340
You have a notion of what,
what the perfect.

1056
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,830
I don't.
I think that's all waste.

1057
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,280
This is what I do.
What I want or what I would try to do.

1058
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,890
I just try to keep writing funny shit.
Just bright it,

1059
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:45,720
make it funny,
put it together as well as I know,

1060
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,000
you know,
I explained this to Ra once,

1061
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:49,430
but it's applicable to me to,
you know,

1062
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Ari and I were talking about comedy and 
like what's going on now that he has 

1063
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,890
like real fans and this,
this,

1064
00:46:55,891 --> 00:46:58,650
this new obligation.
And I said,

1065
00:46:58,651 --> 00:47:00,090
you know,
if I go,

1066
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:01,680
I'm an Ra,
shift your fan.

1067
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,390
I go,
I think you're really hilarious.

1068
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,850
So if I was,
you know,

1069
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,950
take me out of the context of being a 
professional stand up comedian.

1070
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:12,951
If I,
if I was a guy just to doing something 

1071
00:47:12,951 --> 00:47:15,201
else,
you're laughing and I found out about 

1072
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:15,201
Ari,
I'd be like,

1073
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:15,330
Oh,
this guy is funny.

1074
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:19,080
I would want to buy his CD.
I would want to buy his DVD.

1075
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:21,120
I would become an arch for your fan.
I go,

1076
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:25,800
but once that happens,
you're the only guy who can give me Ari.

1077
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,980
Fear you're the only guy who can produce
that material,

1078
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,280
like you have this weird

1079
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,700
obligation and if you do something like 
this,

1080
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:38,730
comics that were like really big at one 
point in time and they sort of stopped 

1081
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,720
delivering comedy,
they stopped making,

1082
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,900
making new specials and people sort of 
gave up on them because they don't 

1083
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,521
really talk about them that much anymore
because they're not getting material 

1084
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:50,521
from them on a regular basis.
You know?

1085
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:55,321
So you're the only Brian callen you're 
the only guy you're trying to reach 

1086
00:47:55,321 --> 00:47:59,110
Brian Cowen fans.
So I just try to.

1087
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:03,070
I know that people think that the 
ridiculous shit that I do is funding and

1088
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,950
I know how to do the ridiculous should I
do so just keep doing it.

1089
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,360
That's my thing.
Yeah.

1090
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:10,360
The idea that the.
I guess the idea of perfection is really

1091
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:13,560
a static notion and you're never static 
as a verb.

1092
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,370
I always,
yeah,

1093
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:18,490
always trying to update the bits.
It's a little bit different.

1094
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,310
Every show there's always something new 
I'm adding,

1095
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,950
I'm taking away.
I approaching it a different way.

1096
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,120
I'm,
I'm fucking with it.

1097
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:30,121
I'm trying to find out how to do it the 
right way and I'll learn along the way 

1098
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:34,201
through trial and error and from my own 
feelings of being too verbose or too 

1099
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:37,540
clunky or whatever the fuck it is.
And so in that way,

1100
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:42,541
and doing it like that,
like you're never in the equation 

1101
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:43,630
equation the equation.
The equation is always the impact of the

1102
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:44,200
material,
how,

1103
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:49,201
how,
what is the best way I can do to make 

1104
00:48:49,201 --> 00:48:49,201
this funny,
like,

1105
00:48:49,201 --> 00:48:49,201
what is if I was,
you know,

1106
00:48:49,201 --> 00:48:51,010
if I'm experiencing this myself,
like,

1107
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:55,330
what is the best way to do it?
So you sort of become a passenger,

1108
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,550
you know,
it's like you're the one who has to sort

1109
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:58,870
of orchestrate it.
But,

1110
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,090
you know,
the concept of the Muse,

1111
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:01,990
I hate when I say,
you know,

1112
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:04,230
that many times the concept of the muse 
that's,

1113
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,260
that's a,
uh,

1114
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:06,880
fakers um,
you know,

1115
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,080
I really should be like,
oh,

1116
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:08,700
I'm,
I'm,

1117
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:09,320
I'm like,
no,

1118
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:10,690
no,
you don't know anything.

1119
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,370
You didn't know what the fuck are you 
even talking about right now.

1120
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,560
But I,
I feel like it's,

1121
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:19,561
um,
the more you can take yourself out of 

1122
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:19,561
it,
the more you can say,

1123
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:20,980
I just want to be the best I can be.
I want to be perfect.

1124
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:25,060
I want to be all that shit is like,
that guy's not doing any comedy.

1125
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,250
That's that one.
Who needs all that?

1126
00:49:27,251 --> 00:49:29,740
That's an annoying,
that ego thing.

1127
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:32,830
That's the creepy part of you that you 
don't want to feed.

1128
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:38,100
You want that to shrivel up.
You want that to shrivel up like a 

1129
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,881
witch's tit.
Because I remember that there was a 

1130
00:49:41,881 --> 00:49:44,660
lawrence,
Olivia was a famous actor and he'd done 

1131
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:44,660
this production of,
uh,

1132
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,000
you know,
of Othello or something like that.

1133
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:51,300
And he was amazing and everybody came 
back and said was the most incredible 

1134
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:51,300
performance and he wasn't really black,
dark mood.

1135
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,020
And I said,
well,

1136
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,080
what's the matter?
He goes,

1137
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,540
he said,
the greatest performance we've anybody's

1138
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:56,530
ever seen.
And he said,

1139
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:58,990
I know,
I just have no idea how to repeat it,

1140
00:49:59,490 --> 00:49:59,960
you know?
And,

1141
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,020
and his thinking was wrong.
I sense there,

1142
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:03,800
you know,
you just got to go to.

1143
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:08,801
Then you got to go zen,
you gotta go Zan and understand that if 

1144
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:09,520
you can do that,
that means you could do that.

1145
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,500
It doesn't mean you're going to do it 
every night.

1146
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,550
I mean,
there's going to be nice,

1147
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,940
like there's times when I'm talking on 
this podcast where every third or fourth

1148
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:19,490
fucking word is my fat.
Stupid tongue is hitting my teeth wrong.

1149
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,130
Excuse me.
I mean marijuana and it's not even that.

1150
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,190
It's not.
It's not that I'm London Pretty Dapper,

1151
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,350
just not.
What am I trying to say is like there's.

1152
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,180
There's ebbs and flows to things.

1153
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,930
There's never a perfect absolute 
sustainable rhythm for anything.

1154
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:35,850
So you,
if you,

1155
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,110
if Lawrence Olivier can crush it like 
that,

1156
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:43,290
what that means is that he can crush it.
Like that doesn't mean you're gonna 

1157
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,200
crush it like that every night,
but he crushed it like that lie and it's

1158
00:50:44,201 --> 00:50:47,230
alive when things are live,
it's a different experience.

1159
00:50:47,231 --> 00:50:49,980
Do you remember in the book of five 
rings with me on the fast,

1160
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:55,010
she says,
practice something enough so that the 

1161
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,510
thing of itself reveals itself.
The spirit reveals that.

1162
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,130
What do you think he meant by that?
Well,

1163
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,390
because the same thing he meant that 
you,

1164
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:06,650
if you know the way broadly,
you can see it in all things and that's 

1165
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:13,070
the same thing.
It's like the way is the spirit of a 

1166
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,771
thing is really excellence.
Whether it's bowling or golf or archery 

1167
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,440
or the spirit of a thing is excellence.

1168
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:25,710
The spirit of a thing is finding how to 
control the body and to get it all 

1169
00:51:27,031 --> 00:51:29,350
online or how would you run up and do 
that?

1170
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:30,730
Perfect.
Three point.

1171
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,850
Oh,
or three point foul shot.

1172
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Did you ever see that film,
that video of that autistic kid that 

1173
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,850
never played basketball before and they 
threw him in on the last game to Brian,

1174
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,800
find this on my twitter.
This is incredible shit.

1175
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:45,910
Matt.
Incredible,

1176
00:51:45,911 --> 00:51:47,920
incredible shit.
This kid,

1177
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:52,921
it's kind of unrelated,
but this kid has a high functioning 

1178
00:51:52,921 --> 00:51:57,151
autistic and they put him in on this a 
basketball game and he's like,

1179
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:03,060
you could tell that the kids like loved 
by all these teammates and when they 

1180
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,850
take this kid and they finally let him 
play in the game.

1181
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,540
So they're one of the last games.
The kid gets up,

1182
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,820
the place goes nuts.
They love him,

1183
00:52:09,821 --> 00:52:13,850
they're cheering for him.
He throws his first ball and it's a Mrs.

1184
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:16,210
by like six feet and they're like,
oh Jesus Christ.

1185
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:21,390
And then he can't miss.
He's nailing three pointers from the 

1186
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,880
outside and the crowd is going fucking 
crazy.

1187
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:30,090
This kid misses one shot and then gets 
in this insane groove of over and over 

1188
00:52:31,211 --> 00:52:33,430
and over again,
slamming three pointers.

1189
00:52:33,431 --> 00:52:37,380
He won like the school record.
See Mrs.

1190
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,510
That's,
that's not it.

1191
00:52:40,511 --> 00:52:41,350
There's A.
Yeah,

1192
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:42,310
that's one of them.
Yeah.

1193
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:50,120
But Jay Mac wasn't done.
He kept shooting and kept hitting 

1194
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,220
another person.

1195
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,270
Oh,
did you start this like inside of it?

1196
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:53,130
A little bit.
Okay.

1197
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,160
Yeah.
The beginning.

1198
00:52:54,161 --> 00:52:59,161
They show the first basket with which he
misses by like six feet and then they 

1199
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:00,880
went crazy.
Look at them,

1200
00:53:00,881 --> 00:53:05,881
run on the field,
grab them and picking them up and 

1201
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:06,070
carrying them around their shoulders.
Imagine how good that kid must've felt.

1202
00:53:06,071 --> 00:53:08,560
Man.
Athletic director.

1203
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,920
If I retired today,
this would be the one thing that I 

1204
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:13,920
talked about forever.
Wow.

1205
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,370
Dude,
are you kidding me?

1206
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,440
Going amazing.
Yes.

1207
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,920
That's another word for excellence.
I think as you,

1208
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:22,950
as you speak about it as harmony,
everything moving in the way it's 

1209
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:23,020
supposed to,
that that's what it sounds like you were

1210
00:53:23,021 --> 00:53:28,021
talking about that,
that that's a form that's kind of like 

1211
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:28,021
hard

1212
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:31,370
harmonizing with a frequency man,
like getting into something and a and a 

1213
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:32,880
pattern and where everything is.
Everything is firing the way it should.

1214
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,500
Yeah,
and and understanding what it,

1215
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:40,530
what it really is like the more like in 
Musashi talking about it's totally 

1216
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:45,121
applicable to standup comedy because in 
talking about like the more time you 

1217
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:45,970
practice it in,
the more you observe it in,

1218
00:53:45,971 --> 00:53:50,971
the more you understand it,
the more it's what it is reveals itself 

1219
00:53:50,971 --> 00:53:54,481
to you and then you know how to operate 
and try to achieve excellence within it.

1220
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,280
That's ever it is.
You're almost writing it.

1221
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,180
You're almost,
it's,

1222
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,130
it's doing the work.
Yeah.

1223
00:54:00,131 --> 00:54:03,460
That's why I think that activities are 
really important for people.

1224
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,850
There's a lot of people that 
unfortunately don't engage in activity.

1225
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:11,620
They don't engage and don't have hobbies
or anything like that.

1226
00:54:11,621 --> 00:54:16,621
I learn a language or do something.
Do something that's exciting art of 

1227
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:16,621
learning.

1228
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:17,390
You know the problem with our education 
system,

1229
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:19,310
Gore Vidal was saying this,
is that what it was,

1230
00:54:19,311 --> 00:54:23,360
that we don't have an education system 
that teaches you how to think.

1231
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,360
We don't play so true.
And that's,

1232
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:27,470
that's,
that's the,

1233
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:28,970
there is an art to learning,
man.

1234
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:30,320
There's an art to learning.
There's an art

1235
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,480
art to be in a human beings,
right?

1236
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,250
It really is.
And no one teaches us.

1237
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:37,880
We don't know what the fuck we're doing.
We're all idiots raising other people,

1238
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:40,640
bar with the same flaws that we were 
raised with.

1239
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,560
There's no manual for it.
Exactly.

1240
00:54:42,561 --> 00:54:46,630
And there's,
when you look at what we consider our,

1241
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:52,250
our,
our source of education as far as like 

1242
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,240
what is distributed to us nightly,
what's the news?

1243
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:58,390
Right?
I mean that's really the education that 

1244
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:58,390
people have today.
Once you get out of school,

1245
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:03,250
unless you're reading books on your own,
where are you getting your information 

1246
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:03,250
about the world?
You're getting it from the fucking news.

1247
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,010
The news doesn't really represent what's
a going on in the world,

1248
00:55:07,011 --> 00:55:12,011
and B,
it doesn't say anything about how you 

1249
00:55:12,011 --> 00:55:12,011
should be dealing with this,
how you should be thinking,

1250
00:55:12,011 --> 00:55:14,660
how we,
how we should resolve these issues.

1251
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:18,170
It's like this tattle tale that just 
goes running over and tells us about all

1252
00:55:18,171 --> 00:55:19,910
the fucked up shit that's happening in 
the world,

1253
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,300
but they don't.
It's not a dialogue with a person.

1254
00:55:23,301 --> 00:55:24,830
It's like a source of information

1255
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:28,480
shy.
The way that that complaint goes back at

1256
00:55:28,481 --> 00:55:29,830
least 3,500
years.

1257
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,500
Socrates,
when he was in his trial said,

1258
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:35,260
you take a,
you wouldn't take a horse to try to ride

1259
00:55:35,261 --> 00:55:39,070
it and not train it.
The same applies to a human being.

1260
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,840
You got to,
you got to start with,

1261
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:45,860
with the notion of he was trying to 
teach philosophy in the sense that you 

1262
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,991
better,
you better know what questions to ask 

1263
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:48,991
throughout your life.
And we should start with young people,

1264
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:52,510
educate young people the right way with 
the right questions.

1265
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,040
If you don't do that,
then,

1266
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:56,560
then you know,
you've got to start with a base almost,

1267
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,660
you know.
And,

1268
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,390
and,
uh,

1269
00:55:58,870 --> 00:55:59,950
we don't,
we don't do that.

1270
00:55:59,951 --> 00:56:01,950
Men were,
it's almost like learning Jujitsu,

1271
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,170
just learning moves without learning the
principles behind it

1272
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,020
first.
Yeah.

1273
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:10,021
Well it's also like learning Jujitsu 
without going over the real correct 

1274
00:56:10,021 --> 00:56:13,340
drills,
learning real life applications and,

1275
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,700
and the,
you know,

1276
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,440
the way school is set up,
I,

1277
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,260
you know,
again,

1278
00:56:17,261 --> 00:56:19,540
you motherfucker,
the way school is set up,

1279
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:24,541
it's,
they have x amount of thousand kids and 

1280
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:27,970
they have to get these kids through with
a basic understanding of the building 

1281
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:31,541
blocks of our world.
They have to understand that they have 

1282
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:34,371
done understanding how to structure a 
sentence and they understand they have 

1283
00:56:34,371 --> 00:56:37,541
to understand form paragraphs and they 
had got to know what happened in the 

1284
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,850
past and then you're off on your own.
Good luck fucker.

1285
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:40,970
Stopped College.

1286
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:46,030
Yeah.
You talk about taking yourself out of 

1287
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,271
the equation.
That's an Asian thing more than a 

1288
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:47,271
western thing.
Certainly more than American.

1289
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:51,860
You know,
if they had Chinese people look at a 

1290
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:51,860
fish tank and then they had Americans 
look at the fish tank,

1291
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:52,590
the Americans,
uh,

1292
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:57,620
describe the fish.
The Chinese described how the 

1293
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,960
relationship between the rocks,
the seaweed,

1294
00:56:57,961 --> 00:57:02,961
the fish,
the boat in there and everything they 

1295
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:02,961
were,
they were looking at the entire,

1296
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,820
the entire picture and that,
that's a lot of it is.

1297
00:57:05,821 --> 00:57:08,430
Um,
but it was a paramedic in a medic,

1298
00:57:08,431 --> 00:57:10,380
I'm sorry,
in Vietnam for two terms,

1299
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,440
two tours.
And one of the things he found was that 

1300
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:15,450
the Viet Cong,
when they get injured,

1301
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,130
they wouldn't go into shock.
And you could,

1302
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,050
you can interrogate them.
They wouldn't go into shock.

1303
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:22,080
The Americans get it in.
A lot of times they go into shock.

1304
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,670
It's very dangerous when you go into 
shock,

1305
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,560
which is actually,
you know what shock is

1306
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:27,210
the lock.
Yeah.

1307
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,670
But you're trying to flush

1308
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:32,010
blood from your extremities and go right
to where the wound is.

1309
00:57:32,011 --> 00:57:34,880
Like sort of like the core area and your
body can shut down.

1310
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:37,340
It's very dangerous.
And that is from panic.

1311
00:57:37,341 --> 00:57:38,300
That's right.
That's from your,

1312
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:39,470
your,
your heart races.

1313
00:57:39,471 --> 00:57:42,680
And instead of slowing down.
And so why?

1314
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:47,710
Well,
one of the things was that when an 

1315
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:47,710
American would get shot,
you'd go,

1316
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:47,710
Holy Shit,
I've been shot.

1317
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:50,780
And you focus on that wound.
When Viet Cong would get shot,

1318
00:57:50,781 --> 00:57:53,990
they were taught.
Now the whole culture wasn't about you.

1319
00:57:53,991 --> 00:57:57,320
You were a leaf on a very big tree.
Put your attention out there.

1320
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:02,500
And,
and that was kind of one of the things 

1321
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:02,500
he took back from Vietnam because 
somebody said to him,

1322
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,401
you know,
you've been teaching this acting class 

1323
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:06,401
from seven to 12 for five years.
I've never seen you yawn once,

1324
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:07,040
not once.
And he says,

1325
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:08,220
I don't think about,
I don't,

1326
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,540
I don't think about myself.
I'm never part of this equation,

1327
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:12,890
man.
I learned a long time ago.

1328
00:58:12,891 --> 00:58:14,960
Even if I'm tired,
it's just a form of energy.

1329
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,930
And I spent a lot of time.
If I start worrying about being tired,

1330
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,750
I'll get tired.
He's got he,

1331
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:23,230
he was 55 and he just was very good at 
taking themselves completely out of the.

1332
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,060
Yeah.
I think that the,

1333
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,620
you can definitely trip yourself up,
but some bad behavior patterns as far as

1334
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:34,621
your,
your feeling in your health and the 

1335
00:58:34,621 --> 00:58:34,870
negativity that you see in the 
environment all over the place.

1336
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:39,871
I mean,
we've all been around that one person 

1337
00:58:39,871 --> 00:58:39,871
that just complains about everything.
Like,

1338
00:58:39,871 --> 00:58:40,500
oh great,
look at the hotel we're staying at.

1339
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,640
Oh fuck.
Look at this fucking place.

1340
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:43,920
Oh Jesus,
great.

1341
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,280
This place hasn't been updated since the
70 [inaudible] like,

1342
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:47,770
will you shut the fuck up man?

1343
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,370
There's a guy who,
who um,

1344
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:51,350
I don't want to speak out of turn.
I don't know if his name,

1345
00:58:51,351 --> 00:58:56,351
but he's a writer,
tried to kill himself and he was 

1346
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:58,670
listening to birds and some girl was 
there and she was talking to him and she

1347
00:58:58,671 --> 00:58:59,600
said,
listen to the birds.

1348
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:00,530
He goes,
what are you here?

1349
00:59:00,531 --> 00:59:01,270
He said,
I don't,

1350
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:02,570
I don't like listening to bird.
She said,

1351
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:03,230
why?
She goes,

1352
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,080
because they're so beautifully says you 
hear.

1353
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:10,100
But I hear a bunch of animals trying to 
fight for territory and scratch out and 

1354
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,430
yelling at each other.
And she went,

1355
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:12,380
hey dude,
don't ruin birds for me man.

1356
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,080
Maybe smart as fuck you.
I don't want to be.

1357
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:16,160
You're kind of smart,
you know?

1358
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,530
And it really is a question of what you 
choose to look at,

1359
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:19,700
what you choose to hear.

1360
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,070
Well,
how emotionally invested

1361
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,380
you choose to be in whether these birds 
fight to the death.

1362
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,730
I'll see your belief system,
right?

1363
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,840
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1364
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:27,170
You,
you,

1365
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,990
you can change your belief system in 
some ways.

1366
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:32,630
Choosing whether or not you're going to 
be affected by all this information.

1367
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:34,730
You know,
what I was going to say is that the,

1368
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,430
when we were talking about the,
uh,

1369
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:43,120
needing some sort of a,
a lesson in how to think and how to 

1370
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,680
operate the mind.
If the human mind,

1371
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,190
if the human body was the just,
you know,

1372
00:59:49,191 --> 00:59:54,191
just the human experience.
If that wasn't an instrument that you 

1373
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:57,881
had to learn to use,
think about navigating the human life 

1374
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:03,910
with the human body and language and 
think about if you came from somewhere 

1375
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:07,400
else and the human body wasn't in the 
human experience,

1376
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:12,290
wasn't just a person living a life but 
rather was a ride that you had to figure

1377
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:13,700
out how to,
how to master,

1378
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:18,730
how to accomplish and that the human 
animal with its creative abilities with 

1379
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:21,170
disabilities or reach out to people with
its,

1380
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:26,171
uh,
ability to build buildings and use 

1381
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:26,171
electricity.

1382
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:26,171
And all these different things,
that's a.

1383
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:27,440
that's a,
that's a vehicle.

1384
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:28,840
That's what that is.
Learn it,

1385
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:33,870
learn how to use that vehicle.
You would have intensive study for a lot

1386
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,520
of just trying to figure out how to go 
about the correct way of doing this.

1387
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,900
They would be like,
you know,

1388
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:46,901
you.
You'd have to figure out what is the 

1389
01:00:46,901 --> 01:00:46,901
best way to think is the best way.
Well,

1390
01:00:46,901 --> 01:00:48,980
most beneficial way to you to approach 
every project as a,

1391
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:53,690
as a person moving around in this human 
world with this human machine,

1392
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:55,700
it would be like a super complicated 
thing,

1393
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
but instead it's just two people.
Fucking some guy shoots a load in the 

1394
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:03,110
girl,
she swells up blank.

1395
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,540
A person comes out,
no one knows shit.

1396
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:06,920
Sound effects by the way.
Thank you.

1397
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,550
So the three of them are standing there.
No one knows what the fuck is going on.

1398
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,540
And they keep doing the same thing.
They keep interacting with each other.

1399
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,550
Same thing,
the way the human,

1400
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:22,270
the way the human being and the human 
body interacts with the world is so 

1401
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:25,430
bizarre and complicated and to get it 
right and correct.

1402
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,460
Take so much fucking thinking.
It's a mandate saying Hudl.

1403
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,480
It,
we just let these things just go loose 

1404
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,010
out into the world,
you know what I mean?

1405
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:40,230
Which is why people are desperate and 
lonely and all that.

1406
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:46,030
We're caught in this machine.
There's a real machine going on with 

1407
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,450
society today and that machine is,
uh,

1408
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,920
the building of society,
the increasing of bandwidth,

1409
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:54,770
you know,
the interconnectivity that's provided by

1410
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:59,771
technology.
It's all of that and it's all of that 

1411
01:01:59,771 --> 01:02:02,930
with this exponentially increasing 
momentum behind it.

1412
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:08,080
And we're all caught up in that and 
we're caught up in that and we have 

1413
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:08,900
mortgages and we have bills and we have 
all these,

1414
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:09,720
but we're,
we're,

1415
01:02:09,721 --> 01:02:12,350
we're doing is,
we're feeding this system.

1416
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:17,590
We're feeding the system of televisions 
and computers and cell phones and new 

1417
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:20,940
clothes and distracting.
It's so distracting.

1418
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:21,590
Like you,
you,

1419
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:26,610
you start unknowledgeable and,
and the Greeks who I said you go from 

1420
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,130
knowledge but you don't jump all the way
to wisdom.

1421
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:29,290
There's an in between place,
which is correct.

1422
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:32,710
Opinion correct.
Opinion comes from when you study,

1423
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:35,530
as you're reaching for wisdom,
you start to develop.

1424
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:39,310
The world crystallizes around you with 
the right teaching and and stuff.

1425
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:44,550
You start to learn what the what,
what sort of the correct way to look at 

1426
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,720
and reach and follow the correct opinion
is,

1427
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:51,721
and then you finally get to a point 
where you understand and can explain why

1428
01:02:52,391 --> 01:02:54,820
that is the correct opinion.
That takes a long fucking time.

1429
01:02:54,821 --> 01:02:59,821
That's life mastery in a way,
but it's like what you're saying is 

1430
01:02:59,821 --> 01:02:59,821
it's,
it's,

1431
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:03,310
it's we don't have a system and we tried
it with public education,

1432
01:03:03,311 --> 01:03:08,311
but we don't have a way or a system to 
really teach people how to live the art.

1433
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,590
No,
no one knows what the fuck they're doing

1434
01:03:11,591 --> 01:03:13,960
and we the,
the people that were raised by,

1435
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:15,460
they didn't know what the fuck they're 
doing either.

1436
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,950
I mean,
my parents are very nice people.

1437
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,550
My mother is a with my step dad.
They've been together forever.

1438
01:03:21,551 --> 01:03:24,550
It's like they're very nice couple.
They're very nice people,

1439
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:28,360
but they were raised by people,
didn't know shit,

1440
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:33,750
and their parents were raised by people 
who didn't know shit and this era that 

1441
01:03:33,971 --> 01:03:37,450
we're living in right now,
it's like human beings are just starting

1442
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:42,451
to wake up and realize that we were all 
living in this weird sort of momentous 

1443
01:03:43,061 --> 01:03:48,061
world.
His world that moves on momentum and 

1444
01:03:48,061 --> 01:03:50,221
momentum doesn't make any sense at all 
and we're all just waking up realizing 

1445
01:03:50,221 --> 01:03:52,060
that it was set up by people didn't know
what the fuck they were doing.

1446
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:55,690
I mean they knew how to build buildings 
and knew how to use electricity,

1447
01:03:55,870 --> 01:04:00,730
but no one knew how to teach society how
to chill the fuck out,

1448
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:05,740
relax and enjoy each other.
Not One fucking person besides like 

1449
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,930
Martin Luther King and a few people with
some dreamy speeches.

1450
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,830
Not One person emphasizes that in the 
role of government.

1451
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:16,980
Not One person is pushing that like 
can't we figure out a way that human 

1452
01:04:17,141 --> 01:04:22,141
beings are just nicer to each other?
Can't we figure out a way where there's 

1453
01:04:22,141 --> 01:04:25,540
maybe a little bit less profit,
but also less pollution and less fucking

1454
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:30,541
with people and less light,
less control over the human population?

1455
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:37,780
I would say that you're also dealing 
with the residue of of a most of human 

1456
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:42,521
history.
Almost all of it has been not enough to 

1457
01:04:42,521 --> 01:04:42,521
eat.
Yeah,

1458
01:04:42,521 --> 01:04:42,521
and dying.

1459
01:04:42,521 --> 01:04:42,521
Yeah.
No,

1460
01:04:42,521 --> 01:04:44,540
it's no doubt.
There's been a lot of things that led us

1461
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:47,510
to this point.
This is also the first point.

1462
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:52,511
We have a responsibility as the human 
beings that have the first access to 

1463
01:04:52,701 --> 01:04:57,701
this sort of information to not be 
looked at like a bunch of silly Fox by 

1464
01:04:57,701 --> 01:05:00,410
the people of the future because that's 
a real problem because if I look back,

1465
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:05,470
I've been living this life right now.
Just looking at all that silly nonsense 

1466
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:06,860
that human beings are involved with.
Like everybody.

1467
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:11,861
I looked on twitter and everybody has 
these fucking equal signs on their 

1468
01:05:11,861 --> 01:05:15,380
twitter Avatar to let every one know 
that they're into marriage equality,

1469
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,410
equality.
It's marriage equality.

1470
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:17,980
You

1471
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,600
should be.
You should be.

1472
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:22,900
That's like saying you're having that on
your twitter Avatar.

1473
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:25,780
You might as well just say water's wet 
is hot,

1474
01:05:25,781 --> 01:05:27,040
hot.
It's cold,

1475
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:27,760
cold.
I didn't.

1476
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:31,210
Of course marriage equality makes sense.
The fact that you even have to to.

1477
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:36,270
Who are you talking to who does this?
But seriously in 2000 and fucking 13,

1478
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:41,050
anybody we should find out who doesn't 
have that on their avatar.

1479
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,070
It should be that.
Let's.

1480
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,170
How about nobody use her face anymore 
and,

1481
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:44,830
and,
and let's,

1482
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:48,390
let's find out and do the people who 
have a problem with it.

1483
01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:52,000
It gives a shit whether or not a couple 
of lesbians want to marry each other.

1484
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:55,360
You're an asshole.
You're an asshole.

1485
01:05:55,361 --> 01:05:57,250
And maybe nobody tells you you're an 
asshole.

1486
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:02,410
Why do you give a fuck about them?
You worrying at all about what other 

1487
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:04,540
people are doing?
Sucks.

1488
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,530
It sucks for everyone around you.
You fuck everything up.

1489
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:12,070
You care that two people love each other
and they want to sign some paperwork.

1490
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:14,200
Why do you give a fuck?
What do you give a fuck of?

1491
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:17,830
She signed some paperwork that the other
chicks going to be your ass eating slave

1492
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:22,860
till the end of time and she'll have to 
be reincarnated in the future ass eater 

1493
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,670
and upon turning 18 will resume her 
practice.

1494
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:29,680
Whereas is this going to be immortal 
right then on paper with what fucking 

1495
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,660
difference does it make?
Why do you care if you care?

1496
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,050
You're an asshole.
You're just an ass or understood it.

1497
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:37,600
I never understood that.
It's fucking dumb.

1498
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:42,640
The desire to control the people and 
when pose your mythology or your belief 

1499
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,351
system on someone else,
it's really uncreative fucks to are not 

1500
01:06:46,351 --> 01:06:49,150
thinking about how ridiculous you're 
going to look in the future when they're

1501
01:06:49,151 --> 01:06:52,540
looking back on the past,
the way they looked at those idiots that

1502
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:55,390
thought that leaches were the best way 
to cure your broken leg.

1503
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,410
Those fucking people.
We laugh at them today and don't tell me

1504
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:01,380
about scientific applications of 
leeches.

1505
01:07:01,381 --> 01:07:06,381
Yeah,
fucks because there's none of that is 

1506
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,180
people like,
you know,

1507
01:07:07,181 --> 01:07:08,990
there are medical applications for 
leeches.

1508
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,870
Like people sent me that because I was 
making fun for gangrene.

1509
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,060
Hey,
you can use it for stuff,

1510
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:18,061
but guess what?
Medicine works better for almost every 

1511
01:07:18,061 --> 01:07:18,061
maggots.
For Nuggets.

1512
01:07:18,061 --> 01:07:18,061
Yeah.
Maggots.

1513
01:07:18,061 --> 01:07:22,531
Sorry.
I think digitally just for something to 

1514
01:07:22,531 --> 01:07:24,241
like to coagulate blood or some shit 
with maggots will eat all the 

1515
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:24,241
[inaudible] tissue.
Right?

1516
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:24,241
What they,
uh,

1517
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:26,440
they'll clean up dead and they think 
stop infections.

1518
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:30,310
It's really kind of crazy for you.
The maggots eating your flesh is good.

1519
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:32,710
Put a cast on you.
They throw a bunch of maggots down there

1520
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:37,711
and because they can't eat you,
they can only eat the stuff that's 

1521
01:07:37,711 --> 01:07:41,401
fucked up.
I mean they're not really like good 

1522
01:07:41,401 --> 01:07:44,161
eaters,
so like it pays to have them all mushed 

1523
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:47,221
up and your moons and actually 
apparently they're good eating if you 

1524
01:07:47,221 --> 01:07:49,860
need to either a high source of protein.
That shit.

1525
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:55,440
What's insearch?
It isn't as interesting how we have 

1526
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,291
this,
like really these really clear views 

1527
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,800
about what is and isn't good food or 
something that you should eat.

1528
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:05,190
And crabs and crabs and spiders.
Could there be an animal that's closer 

1529
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,810
to looking like each other in the same 
family?

1530
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:08,750
Yeah.
They're in the same family.

1531
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,650
Found out that lobsters were in the lice
family.

1532
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:13,920
I couldn't eat lobsters anymore.
I was like,

1533
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,120
what do you mean in the lice family

1534
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,830
dudes in the jungle that they cook up 
the trenches.

1535
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:22,310
No,
he never seen them.

1536
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:25,070
They look yummy.
It looks like a soft shell crab.

1537
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,240
I bet.
I bet.

1538
01:08:26,241 --> 01:08:27,890
I bet.
I bet they taste good.

1539
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,590
They're all in the same family,
but we have this weird thing,

1540
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,240
right?
Like when we're talking about maggots,

1541
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,550
like if it wasn't like,
look,

1542
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,980
what is hemp force protein?
It's fucking ground up plants.

1543
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:38,990
Mushy ground up plans.
Like,

1544
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:39,920
okay,
you eat plants.

1545
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:40,850
Got It.
Okay.

1546
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:42,080
What is.
What are maggots?

1547
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:44,540
Maggots are just these little fleshy.
Okay,

1548
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:45,380
well what?
What?

1549
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:46,940
What do you eat?
What?

1550
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:48,220
Tell me what you do.
What are you cool with?

1551
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:49,190
You?
Cool with yogurt.

1552
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,370
Eat the flesh off an animal and cool 
with yogurt.

1553
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:57,371
You know what that is?
You know you're eating like a fucking 

1554
01:08:57,371 --> 01:08:59,471
civilization.
You know you're eating the living 

1555
01:08:59,471 --> 01:08:59,471
organism or eating acidophilus.

1556
01:08:59,471 --> 01:09:01,190
A pure living organisms.
Bacteria.

1557
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:02,150
What are you doing?
Stupid.

1558
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:03,800
Do you know what you're doing?
But you're like,

1559
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:08,801
new maggots are bad.
Mcateer little buddies that your little 

1560
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:11,921
wound cleaning buddies,
they're full of protein and you're 

1561
01:09:11,921 --> 01:09:15,100
saying no to them,
but yet you're just chugging down that 

1562
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,650
fucking corn fed beef.
These fatty,

1563
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,410
diseased cows,
fat,

1564
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:26,680
sloppy heart pounding as they pumps 
blood through fucking caked up arteries,

1565
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:32,180
slivers living in no shit.
Oh my God.

1566
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:34,510
Just to fucking amount of fat that you 
get on.

1567
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,590
But that's the only way you get a 
delicious Ribeye.

1568
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,090
The kind that you really.
Oh,

1569
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,760
you cook it over a little salt and 
pepper.

1570
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:45,761
Don't get crazy.
All you need is a little salt and 

1571
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:45,761
pepper.
The,

1572
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:46,190
uh,
grass fed beef though.

1573
01:09:46,191 --> 01:09:48,420
Once you get used to that.
It's a.

1574
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,810
to me it's,
I feel so much better eating.

1575
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,720
Maybe it's psychological,
the oils,

1576
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,510
the oils,
first of all,

1577
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:53,770
the room.

1578
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,220
And it's.
So cows are supposed to eat grass.

1579
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:57,320
It would.
They're definitely,

1580
01:09:57,321 --> 01:10:00,770
you're eating a healthier and for sure 
it tastes more like a game.

1581
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:05,830
And also the,
the oils in the meat are very different 

1582
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,681
when they grasp the oils.
The fatty acids are,

1583
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,010
are,
I believe,

1584
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:11,870
I can't remember what the ratio is,
what it is,

1585
01:10:11,871 --> 01:10:16,871
but the fatty acids literally changed 
from like Omega three to Omega six or 

1586
01:10:16,871 --> 01:10:16,871
something like that.
I mean,

1587
01:10:16,871 --> 01:10:21,350
so,
so when you eat at a bison or you eat 

1588
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:24,470
grass fed beef,
the oils are healthier and,

1589
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:25,520
and a lot of,
um,

1590
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:30,550
heart doctors on Dr Oz are prescribing 
grassfed beef because it helps with 

1591
01:10:31,191 --> 01:10:36,191
inflammation.
It actually brings inflammation in the 

1592
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:36,290
body down according to a lot of 
research.

1593
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:41,380
That's really interesting because I 
talked to a woman who was a 

1594
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:41,600
chiropractor.
We were talking about desks,

1595
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:46,601
you know,
because I got a disc issue on my back 

1596
01:10:46,601 --> 01:10:48,730
and she said,
besides this thing called the mackenzie 

1597
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:51,341
protocol,
it's like a series of stretches that 

1598
01:10:51,341 --> 01:10:53,210
they use to elongate the spine.
She said changing the Diet is very 

1599
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:53,690
important.
And uh,

1600
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:58,720
she recommended a bunch of different uh,
anti-inflammatories and cutting out all 

1601
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:01,590
week.
Yeah.

1602
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,630
That that,
that,

1603
01:11:02,631 --> 01:11:07,631
believe it or not,
like people who are eating gluten and 

1604
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:10,980
like that,
the more and more people are sort of 

1605
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:13,320
understanding that what you're doing is 
just slowly poisoning yourself with that

1606
01:11:13,321 --> 01:11:14,070
stuff,
but you can

1607
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,020
handle it.
That's really what's going on.

1608
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:18,660
And when you cut it out you're like,
oh whoa.

1609
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,910
Yeah.
Why don't feel so good now?

1610
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,170
Like,
what's going on?

1611
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:27,390
Like that stuff's not good for you.
I stopped eating bread and also because 

1612
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:29,400
it's got a high glycemic index,
it's Kinda like spikes your insulin.

1613
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:33,090
So I eat brown rice and yams and I just 
feel better when I do that.

1614
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,580
I do that,
but yet I don't.

1615
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:38,880
I'm not rigid.
I still will go to a nice restaurant and

1616
01:11:38,881 --> 01:11:43,680
have locked bread with olive oil and 
balsamic vinegar and all the way this is

1617
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:45,270
salience do.
And they lived to 105.

1618
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,700
I wonder how much bread they they eat.
Do they eat a lot of bread?

1619
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,720
You know when you go there,
you see the bread they eat.

1620
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:53,190
It is,
it is as healthy.

1621
01:11:53,191 --> 01:11:54,490
It's a meal in itself too.

1622
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,550
It's like you see the bread up in like,
oh,

1623
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:58,260
you got to northern Italy.
I went to this place.

1624
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,840
I walked into this bread place that 
bread is,

1625
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:02,070
it doesn't look like bread.
Okay.

1626
01:12:02,071 --> 01:12:06,870
It looks like God just like a block of 
seeds and nuts and you're like,

1627
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:08,910
what the fuck are you could hit somebody
in the head and they die.

1628
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,760
My grandfather used to.
My,

1629
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:14,580
my grandfather came over here during the
depression on a,

1630
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:15,630
on a boat.
They,

1631
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:19,710
his family hopped in a boat from Italy 
and came up with a fun ride by the way.

1632
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:24,180
And they lived in this like seriously 
Italian neighborhood in New Jersey.

1633
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,750
And we used to,
uh,

1634
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:28,620
it was almost dead by the time I got 
older.

1635
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:33,830
But when I lived with them for a bit,
when I first moved to New York when I 

1636
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:34,470
was 23,
I guess 23 or 24.

1637
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:39,470
I live with my grandfather for like a 
year and he would still go by his bread 

1638
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:43,910
from this place in New Jersey.
And there's some people that had been 

1639
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:45,210
there from the 19 fifties.
They had been selling bread.

1640
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:46,320
And this one,
probably even more,

1641
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:48,520
I think it was actually the thirties 
they were there.

1642
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,340
Real Shit.
Oh yeah,

1643
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:50,790
yeah,
yeah.

1644
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:55,791
It was just old school bread place and 
they would go and get the bread every 

1645
01:12:55,791 --> 01:12:59,121
day.
And that's how the immigrants like 

1646
01:12:59,121 --> 01:12:59,121
dropbox,
by the way,

1647
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:02,480
everything was homemade tomato sauce.
My grandmother was always like cooking 

1648
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,560
things and it was always homemade.
She,

1649
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:08,850
they grew their own tomatoes.
They turned them into tomato sauce that 

1650
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,981
made their own pasta.
My grandmother would be like rolling 

1651
01:13:11,981 --> 01:13:12,350
Pasta and nothing came out of screaming 
at my grandfather.

1652
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,620
Get off me,
Joe,

1653
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:16,840
you leave me alone.
I'm tired of your bullshit.

1654
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:19,660
I'm going to tell you right now.
I'm going to move in with my sister.

1655
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,240
You feel like,
oh,

1656
01:13:21,241 --> 01:13:26,241
they would go crazy.
My grandparents were Sicilian and so it 

1657
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:26,700
was the same thing.
Nothing came out of a can.

1658
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:28,290
My grandfather's fucking.
Well,

1659
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:33,291
they didn't have kids to know.
It's like the idea of paying for 

1660
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:34,980
something which costs more when you can 
grow in your backyard.

1661
01:13:34,981 --> 01:13:35,940
Like what?
Are you stupid?

1662
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,130
My grandfather would show up with the 
wheel of Parmesan or we'll sit.

1663
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:43,350
We had a food pantry and it would sit in
this big closet like food pantry,

1664
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:45,000
like it was do you could walk into it,
you know,

1665
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:50,001
there's a real issue with with the 
cheese in this country and milk in that 

1666
01:13:50,001 --> 01:13:54,981
people want everything to be pasteurized
and homogenized and that raw milk when 

1667
01:13:54,981 --> 01:13:57,750
it's from an excellent source,
should be available to you,

1668
01:13:57,751 --> 01:14:02,751
just like raw eggs are available to you,
just like raw meat and it should be 

1669
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:06,270
clear and obvious as to whether or not 
you're eating bad food.

1670
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:08,160
Like when you're eating a steak.
Okay?

1671
01:14:08,161 --> 01:14:13,161
And if you buy a stake and the stake 
sits in the refrigerator for like five 

1672
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:13,161
or six days,
you don't

1673
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:14,020
get to it,
it starts to get a little funky.

1674
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:19,320
You know?
You know why that's because it's a 

1675
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:19,690
fucking thing from an animal and it's 
used to be alive.

1676
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:24,040
It's decaying and that Shit's real.
And as soon as you stop that process,

1677
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,810
okay,
as soon as you step in,

1678
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:28,810
you're monkeying around with nature.
Okay?

1679
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:29,980
And I know,
I know.

1680
01:14:29,981 --> 01:14:34,981
It's good.
I know it's helped a lot of people get 

1681
01:14:34,981 --> 01:14:34,981
through some really dark times in this 
world.

1682
01:14:34,981 --> 01:14:37,150
We're milk because it was homogenized 
and pasteurized.

1683
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:39,740
They could keep it longer and it fed 
people sure,

1684
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:45,120
but at a certain point in time,
we have to realize that all that 

1685
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,360
homogenization and pasteurization is not
the healthy way to do it.

1686
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,070
The healthy way to do it is to eat it 
fresh like it.

1687
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:54,100
They like the healthy way to do anything
and then it becomes this industry with 

1688
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:58,381
taking this milk and changing it through
this process of homogenization and 

1689
01:14:59,321 --> 01:14:59,950
pasteurization.

1690
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,090
Well,
what happens to those people?

1691
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:04,090
What if you don't have to homogenize the
pasteurized milk and what will be out of

1692
01:15:04,091 --> 01:15:05,020
business?
Listen,

1693
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:10,021
Charlie,
I've been given you a lot of money all 

1694
01:15:10,021 --> 01:15:10,021
these years.
I've supported you for governor and 84 I

1695
01:15:10,021 --> 01:15:14,260
support to you again.
We've got to make raw milk Hillier so 

1696
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:14,260
they illegal firearms,
safety.

1697
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,870
They arrest people for selling Rondo.
You can't get raw cheese.

1698
01:15:16,871 --> 01:15:21,871
Raw Cheese is super fucking hard to get 
man because they want you to use 

1699
01:15:21,871 --> 01:15:25,831
homogenized and pasteurized milk because
if it's just some joe blow farmer who 

1700
01:15:25,831 --> 01:15:28,060
has no access to homogenization 
pasteurization,

1701
01:15:28,061 --> 01:15:30,880
just start selling his milk and people 
actually like it.

1702
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:33,340
What the fucking world could end.
That's my problem.

1703
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,050
And and that's,
that's where,

1704
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:40,080
that's why the only thing we should all 
be talking about is campaign finance 

1705
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,410
reform.
The idea that money in politics,

1706
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:46,411
as long as there's money in politics,
you're going to have very powerful 

1707
01:15:46,411 --> 01:15:49,900
wealthy interests controlling even what 
the fuck you eat.

1708
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,440
Well.
Yeah,

1709
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:55,441
and I think it's not a bad option.
This is what I want to say because if 

1710
01:15:55,441 --> 01:16:00,010
you are in a low income household and 
you're in a situation where when you buy

1711
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:03,100
a gallon of milk,
like that gallon of milk needs to all be

1712
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:06,610
used,
it goes the pasteurized milk and if,

1713
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:07,650
if you,
you know,

1714
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:10,450
if it lasts for a week and a half with 
pasteurization,

1715
01:16:10,451 --> 01:16:12,640
but it only lasts three days and it's 
raw,

1716
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:14,160
that fucks your family.
I'm sure.

1717
01:16:14,161 --> 01:16:16,990
And I completely understand that.
So what we have to look at then,

1718
01:16:16,991 --> 01:16:18,830
if you were looking at a holistic 
approach,

1719
01:16:18,831 --> 01:16:23,260
is how do we eliminate that from 
civilized society?

1720
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:28,290
How do we eliminate people that are 
working in such poverty that they're 

1721
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:31,450
worried about their milk being bad?
If it goes three days like milk,

1722
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:33,000
how much milk costs?
Like what does milk,

1723
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,590
like four bucks or something like that.

1724
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:36,850
For a lot of people that's a deal 
breaker.

1725
01:16:36,851 --> 01:16:37,150
Look,
they're,

1726
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:37,540
they're,
they're,

1727
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:38,950
they're really trying to put it all 
together.

1728
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,860
That's kind of fucked up.
That's kind of crazy that,

1729
01:16:41,861 --> 01:16:46,861
you know,
some guy could be working in a job all 

1730
01:16:46,861 --> 01:16:51,451
day every day and then they take taxes 
out of that and then when you look at 

1731
01:16:51,451 --> 01:16:55,681
it,
he still doesn't have enough money to 

1732
01:16:55,681 --> 01:16:57,330
eat natural food.
That's where the food stamps program 

1733
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:57,330
comes from.
That's all those things.

1734
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:58,870
All those answers,
that's not the answer,

1735
01:16:58,871 --> 01:17:01,930
right?
The answer is sort of a restructuring of

1736
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:06,960
how much your time is worth.
Like what is in figuring out also how to

1737
01:17:07,901 --> 01:17:10,070
fund some way.
I mean it's the,

1738
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,070
the,
the,

1739
01:17:11,071 --> 01:17:15,380
the society we live in is really sort of
like a really nutty game,

1740
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:20,710
you know,
finding your spot in that game and 

1741
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:23,831
finding had six points from that game 
where you just said is finding your 

1742
01:17:23,831 --> 01:17:27,700
spots because the dea,
as technology grows exponentially and 

1743
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,030
our economy will start to change 
exponentially.

1744
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:34,490
There isn't.
You've got to figure out how to make 

1745
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,701
yourself useful and traditional labor 
and things is not going to be worth and 

1746
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:43,310
stand already is this case is not going 
to be worth what it was when a robot can

1747
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:45,380
do it and stuff.
So then then where does,

1748
01:17:45,381 --> 01:17:47,210
where does a human being,
where are you?

1749
01:17:47,211 --> 01:17:48,680
What is your skill set?
Have to be.

1750
01:17:48,681 --> 01:17:53,681
My guess is you're going to have to 
constantly be taking classes and 

1751
01:17:53,681 --> 01:17:55,940
constantly be changing and constantly be
keeping up with a,

1752
01:17:55,941 --> 01:18:00,380
with an economy that is always moving at
the speed of life.

1753
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:01,030
You know,
I mean it's,

1754
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,650
it's moving very quickly.
Speed of life.

1755
01:18:02,651 --> 01:18:05,780
That's a funny thing to say,
the speed of life and that's really what

1756
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:10,781
it is.
Like this beautiful life is constantly 

1757
01:18:10,781 --> 01:18:12,881
ever changing.
And to think that somehow or another 

1758
01:18:12,881 --> 01:18:12,881
you're obligated to,
to have a job.

1759
01:18:12,881 --> 01:18:14,750
I've been a cobbler.
My family were cobblers.

1760
01:18:14,751 --> 01:18:16,340
What's going on?
I can't make shoes anymore.

1761
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:18,980
Change.
I can't change what?

1762
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:22,220
Either that or make some shoes that are 
undeniably dope.

1763
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:27,630
Everybody wants to go to your shoe store
and buy your handmade shoes because 

1764
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:30,851
they're so fucking bad ass.
But unless you attain that sort of 

1765
01:18:30,851 --> 01:18:31,220
perfection at your craft,
you're not gonna attract people.

1766
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:32,460
You know,
you,

1767
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:34,490
you're going to have to find something 
that like.

1768
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:38,360
Imagine if you were like really into 
owning a record store and you're like,

1769
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:38,810
man,
I look.

1770
01:18:38,811 --> 01:18:40,070
Everybody needs records.
Okay,

1771
01:18:40,071 --> 01:18:40,610
I'll tell you,
man,

1772
01:18:40,611 --> 01:18:41,810
record store is always going to be 
around.

1773
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:47,050
It's a great investment.
I'm going to take my money and I put it 

1774
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:47,050
in her records because.
So let's talk about this.

1775
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:51,220
Economists always talk about how things 
become obsolete and there's always got 

1776
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:51,220
to be there.
The,

1777
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:55,241
the economy.
A capitalist economy is based on the 

1778
01:18:55,241 --> 01:18:56,150
notion that here's how they do it and 
I'm going to come along and do it better

1779
01:18:56,151 --> 01:19:01,151
for a premium.
I'll come up with a better way to do 

1780
01:19:01,151 --> 01:19:01,400
what you're doing and that's the idea.
You know,

1781
01:19:01,401 --> 01:19:02,870
the,
you always got a better car for you,

1782
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:03,800
you know,
your car is breaking down.

1783
01:19:03,801 --> 01:19:04,790
I got a better car,
you know,

1784
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:07,110
I'll fix that problem for you.
Will sort of be.

1785
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:12,150
I mean,
we are always constantly improving 

1786
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,901
things and that's one of the more 
fascinating things about the human 

1787
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:13,901
condition to me.
You know,

1788
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:16,080
I loved that.
I got the apple retina laptop thing.

1789
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,980
Look skinny,
tiny and light.

1790
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:24,310
I love that.
I love and you don't need any more 

1791
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,310
computer than that.
It's not like I can,

1792
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,310
I can follow,
but you're so wrong.

1793
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:25,530
I do.
If they come up with a new one,

1794
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:28,310
it's saying that,
you know,

1795
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,460
it's not a huge difference.
I want,

1796
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,030
once you get that,
it's all unique.

1797
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:37,420
It's very easy now to get everything you
need as far as like a visual experience 

1798
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,920
or you know,
or just access to information I think to

1799
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:45,150
try to deny or slow down the idea that 
we're going to continue to pump out 

1800
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:50,261
newer,
greater crazier shit and that you're 

1801
01:19:50,261 --> 01:19:51,380
going to continue to want it lustfully.
It's ridiculous at this point.

1802
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,600
You know,
it's fucking ridiculous.

1803
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:58,660
It's just,
it's a part of what humans are and your 

1804
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,750
attraction to it is just like your 
attraction to tits.

1805
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:05,140
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense,
especially if you know you're never 

1806
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:05,270
going to be able to touch them,
but a girl was great.

1807
01:20:05,271 --> 01:20:06,860
Tits can walk into a room and you just 
go,

1808
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:07,410
oh,

1809
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:12,900
the whole fucking good kid.
He just looked at him this round or they

1810
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:17,901
move when she moves and every girl in 
the room was pissed because she's not 

1811
01:20:17,901 --> 01:20:17,901
wearing a bra.
Oh,

1812
01:20:17,901 --> 01:20:20,640
that fucking bitch.
I can't believe she's not wearing a bra.

1813
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,620
What a fucking whore.
All my God.

1814
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:25,380
I can't believe she's not wearing a bra.
She shows up in life I can think,

1815
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:27,210
and she's not even wearing a bra,
this fucking pig.

1816
01:20:27,211 --> 01:20:31,230
She shows up her tits or Pocan.
Ask Dick in the room,

1817
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:37,990
otherwise known as many women.
I remember when I was with a bunch of 

1818
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:37,990
girls,
I was like,

1819
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,430
I don't know,
long time ago,

1820
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:41,570
and then this girl comes in and she had 
eyeliner on and she had like.

1821
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,740
She'd drawn a line around her lips.
She had this.

1822
01:20:43,741 --> 01:20:48,741
She was like really kind of.
She had high heels and all the girls 

1823
01:20:48,741 --> 01:20:48,741
were like,
oh,

1824
01:20:48,741 --> 01:20:48,741
look at how gross she is.

1825
01:20:48,741 --> 01:20:51,510
She's just so fucking trashy.
And I was like,

1826
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:56,220
that's what I call 1000 percent.
This guy's type.

1827
01:20:56,221 --> 01:21:01,221
You fucking fucking boring white chicks 
from Connecticut with your flat shoes 

1828
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:06,921
and your shitty genes goes,
holds those hot girls.

1829
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:13,980
Does it ever hold the ridicule them?
Do you think they're a bad part of 

1830
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:18,831
society?
When women see girls dressing slutty or 

1831
01:21:18,831 --> 01:21:21,921
flirty,
they fucking hate Boston Irish checks 

1832
01:21:21,921 --> 01:21:23,220
check.
Whereas nice heels,

1833
01:21:23,221 --> 01:21:28,221
you fucking hookah.
Does your mother know you're out there 

1834
01:21:28,221 --> 01:21:29,880
sucking cock for nickels?
Exactly.

1835
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,910
That's attractive hunting.
I think I'll pay you and not the fucking

1836
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:35,580
Italian princess over there.
I'll hold her back.

1837
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:40,640
Oh God.
Where they're painted toes and her that 

1838
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,730
her fucking skimpy skirt.
They hate hate haters.

1839
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,810
God Sad.
It's just a lot of haters out there,

1840
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:50,820
man.
That's a sad thing that women can't 

1841
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:50,880
express themselves the way they want 
away though.

1842
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,460
Like I,
if I,

1843
01:21:51,461 --> 01:21:52,740
if I didn't have outlets,
like,

1844
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,360
like,
uh,

1845
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,120
what do you mean?
You know,

1846
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:56,970
like if you,
if you're just a dude and there was some

1847
01:21:56,971 --> 01:21:59,640
guy who shows up,
like fucking shop shows up like with his

1848
01:21:59,641 --> 01:22:01,650
shirt off and the girls are all like,
I want to have sex with that guy.

1849
01:22:01,651 --> 01:22:03,390
And even your wife is like,
I love that guy.

1850
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:07,290
You're right about that.
That's bullshit.

1851
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:12,500
When dudes bring,
when dudes bring their wife over at me 

1852
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:12,750
sometimes and they'll say something 
like,

1853
01:22:12,751 --> 01:22:13,280
you know,
you,

1854
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,870
you're the one on New York on the list.
She's loaded.

1855
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,050
What are you talking about?
Stupid.

1856
01:22:19,051 --> 01:22:21,120
Like why are you in accepting that from 
her?

1857
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:21,990
You know,
why?

1858
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,140
Why don't you let anybody.
And these guys were like,

1859
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:25,620
look,
shut the fuck up.

1860
01:22:25,621 --> 01:22:27,180
If your wife says,
oh,

1861
01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:30,060
I think British chops hot,
she's an asshole.

1862
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:30,960
Right?
Right.

1863
01:22:30,961 --> 01:22:32,550
If you're married to some chicken,
she does that.

1864
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,610
Just like you're a douchebag.
If you make her feel like that.

1865
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:37,470
If you do that on purpose,
that's.

1866
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:38,940
That's what I'm just saying.
Tish beheaded.

1867
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,140
That is a guy.
You have outlets.

1868
01:22:40,141 --> 01:22:41,480
It doesn't matter.
A lot of guys are better looking.

1869
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,140
I just go,
yeah,

1870
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:43,380
I'll make you laugh.
So fuck you.

1871
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,110
Have you liked me anyway because you 
have a reoccurring theme.

1872
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,870
You have a reoccurring theme.
We're accepting.

1873
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:50,250
You're like,
look,

1874
01:22:50,251 --> 01:22:51,570
I'm not this.
I'm not that.

1875
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,860
I'm not this.
I'm not that,

1876
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:54,720
but under this.
No.

1877
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,620
That's a reoccurring thing like it is.
It is very self defining.

1878
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,800
You know?
I've been been writing script about 

1879
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:03,800
that.
Yeah,

1880
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,170
but I got to speak about that shit.
Go.

1881
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:07,580
No Way.
Started Paul Riser.

1882
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:08,350
Yes,
he is.

1883
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:13,360
Paul Pfizer and Paul and no disrespect 
to Paul Riser.

1884
01:23:13,361 --> 01:23:14,860
I just,
I loved him and aliens.

1885
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:21,080
That was his greatest movie ever 
auditioned for Paul Riser once you ever 

1886
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,660
see him in aliens.
Wasn't a funny role at all.

1887
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:25,120
It was like a really creepy guy role and
you fucking nailed it.

1888
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:27,880
Is acting was so believable,
man.

1889
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,550
Fucking.
He played a real creep man and he did an

1890
01:23:30,551 --> 01:23:31,620
awesome job.
That's,

1891
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:36,730
that's a great role.
I was amazed that he never did more 

1892
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:38,260
serious roles because he was so good in 
that.

1893
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,290
I mean maybe he didn't enjoy it,
you know?

1894
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:45,390
I mean he,
he was in one of the greatest horror 

1895
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:45,390
movies of all time.
I mean,

1896
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:49,321
why not just cut your losses,
but he went and did like a lot of 

1897
01:23:49,321 --> 01:23:49,321
comedies,
but he was awesome.

1898
01:23:49,321 --> 01:23:50,980
Just made so much money on mad about 
you.

1899
01:23:50,981 --> 01:23:53,260
I think you make $50,
million dollars.

1900
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:57,490
We had some cameramen that said Helen 
Hunt was mean.

1901
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:01,810
I've heard that people get sick.

1902
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,840
They get.
She probably wanted to be in theater or 

1903
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:07,210
perhaps film won an Oscar.
I say.

1904
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,780
I've actually had a couple of 
conversations with.

1905
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,790
Very cool.
Yeah.

1906
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:14,791
You never know.
She didn't want to be on that Shitty 

1907
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:15,820
Sitcom that I understand.
It is torture.

1908
01:24:15,821 --> 01:24:16,630
Sixth Year.
Yeah.

1909
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:18,520
And I would.
I do not.

1910
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:19,190
I mean,
I,

1911
01:24:19,191 --> 01:24:22,090
I am absolutely not saying,
oh poor them.

1912
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:23,470
To you folks out there and go,
hey,

1913
01:24:23,471 --> 01:24:26,050
I'll take that fucking job at a 
heartbeat and I know you would,

1914
01:24:26,051 --> 01:24:28,780
and you're right in saying that,
and yes it is a good job,

1915
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:34,200
but there's something about doing a 
really bad show that his soul stealing.

1916
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:40,080
Weird.
I've only been involved in one bad 

1917
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,441
sitcom ever done some pilots that were 
so bad that I was hiding in my dressing 

1918
01:24:43,441 --> 01:24:45,340
room because I need good,
funny people around.

1919
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:47,050
If I'm doing a TV show can be shitty.

1920
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:52,050
If I liked the people around me,
I'll bear with it for a long time 

1921
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:52,120
because the acting gets in the way.
I'm just fucking around all day.

1922
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:55,270
I take one pilots.
I probably did.

1923
01:24:55,271 --> 01:25:00,010
I did like one one big pilot.
It was an interesting one for this thing

1924
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:01,690
called overseas.
Oh yeah,

1925
01:25:01,691 --> 01:25:04,360
I remember that.
I remember you got that.

1926
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:05,570
Yeah.
With the,

1927
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:10,680
the uh,
well I was on news radio and he was 

1928
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:11,220
trying to find one guy to play this 
piece.

1929
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:14,950
Core Group of Peace Corps guys.
It's like something along those funny.

1930
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:16,300
Actually,
I thought it was funny.

1931
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:21,750
You know,
who knows why people do and don't do 

1932
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,160
certain projects or some pilots go and 
then other shows that are just terrible.

1933
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:26,230
Just stay on the air for a long period 
of time.

1934
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:29,860
It doesn't make any sense,
but the process is fucking hard.

1935
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:34,920
It's not easy to do.
It's like creating a new show and 

1936
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,330
figuring out the right way to do it and 
the right character and you know,

1937
01:25:37,331 --> 01:25:40,760
and then how much wacky neighbor do we 
need and this is not.

1938
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,300
That's like a super complicated thing.
It's chemistry,

1939
01:25:43,301 --> 01:25:44,020
right?
It's like a.

1940
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,700
all these moving parts have to work in.
You know,

1941
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:49,540
Alec Baldwin said one time when a 
movie's successful,

1942
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:51,400
it's a fucking accident.
And,

1943
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:55,270
and the reason it's an accident is there
are so many moving parts that any little

1944
01:25:55,271 --> 01:25:57,280
thing can go wrong,
including the weather,

1945
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:59,800
including some crazy shoots up a movie 
theater,

1946
01:25:59,801 --> 01:26:03,010
including whatever it might be,
and if not,

1947
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:06,830
if everything isn't working perfectly 
and uses the gym,

1948
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:09,650
the gym carry the ace Ventura thing.
He was doing the getaway.

1949
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:12,080
It was this huge movie.
Kim bessinger him.

1950
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:16,490
They were the remake of the Steve 
McQueen thing is biggest movie and along

1951
01:26:16,491 --> 01:26:18,260
comes and they were,
they were going to be number one,

1952
01:26:18,261 --> 01:26:23,261
not all this tracking that way and along
comes this little movie called Ace 

1953
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:27,020
Ventura pet detective and fucking just 
steals the whole show,

1954
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,210
you know,
and he was saying if a movie does really

1955
01:26:29,211 --> 01:26:30,800
well,
it's a fucking accident man.

1956
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,340
Everything's got to be as terror.
Pet detective probably did greg,

1957
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:35,510
because they love Jim Carrey.
Dude,

1958
01:26:35,511 --> 01:26:38,360
or the fuck you want because nobody saw 
that coming.

1959
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:39,660
Nobody.
Nobody saw that coming.

1960
01:26:39,670 --> 01:26:40,060
They were like,
look,

1961
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:40,850
we've got Jim Carrey.
Yeah.

1962
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:41,750
What are you going to do,
Jim?

1963
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:46,780
Good character.
It does this fucking wacky over the top 

1964
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:47,630
shit.
Everybody loves it.

1965
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,870
I died.
Yeah.

1966
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:52,100
I had so many people.
I saw a critically at the time they were

1967
01:26:52,101 --> 01:26:55,540
just destroying that movie and talking 
about what if he says shit,

1968
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:57,840
it is howling,
but that,

1969
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:02,360
that idea that everybody needs to do the
same kind of comedy is so stupid.

1970
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:06,260
Like you can't appreciate a wacky.
I know that you like Lewis Black,

1971
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:09,050
but can't you like a wacky guy too?
Like what do you,

1972
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:11,230
why are you like holding them back?
How many snap,

1973
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:12,140
man?
What about,

1974
01:27:12,141 --> 01:27:13,280
did you see burt wonderstone?

1975
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:14,030
How did that move?
You do?

1976
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,100
I don't know what that is.
I heard it was awful.

1977
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,240
Oh yeah.
What is it?

1978
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:20,220
It's a magic carrie.
And then Steve Carell and all.

1979
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:21,590
It's a new movie,
isn't he?

1980
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,980
Didn't he get in trouble because he was 
making fun of Charlton Heston?

1981
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:27,110
Yeah.
Yeah,

1982
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:28,730
he did.
I didn't see the video.

1983
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:30,380
Do you want to watch it?
Let's pull it up.

1984
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:33,230
Apparently he did some controversial 
video where he was,

1985
01:27:33,231 --> 01:27:38,231
uh,
he was mocking Charlton Heston who's 

1986
01:27:38,231 --> 01:27:40,940
dead and you know,
one of his famous keep brushing me.

1987
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:41,820
No,
no,

1988
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:42,140
no,
no.

1989
01:27:42,141 --> 01:27:42,940
From you.
You know,

1990
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:44,840
you'd taken my rifle when he prime my 
cold,

1991
01:27:44,841 --> 01:27:47,060
dead cold hands.
Yeah.

1992
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:52,090
Well,
apparently a Jim Carey took that out of 

1993
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:52,090
context.
Who apparently.

1994
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:53,840
Michael Morris.
There's no out of context.

1995
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:57,230
This is out of context.
When you say you'll take my rifle out of

1996
01:27:57,231 --> 01:28:02,231
my cold dead hands.
It's impossible to take that out of 

1997
01:28:02,231 --> 01:28:02,570
context.
You only say that when either a,

1998
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,600
you're joking around or be your fucking 
psycho.

1999
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:09,500
There's one or two things and I think 
that Charlton Heston was a fucking side.

2000
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:11,630
There's the third thing.
He was just being dramatic.

2001
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:12,950
Yeah,
he's a psycho.

2002
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:15,020
That guy like guns and.
Yeah,

2003
01:28:15,021 --> 01:28:16,400
you were going to have to kill them for 
it.

2004
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:20,210
Do we have the video,
the funny or die video?

2005
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:21,380
I think it is.
Yeah.

2006
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:22,960
Yeah.
Let's see this because I.

2007
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,990
This is the first time saying that it's 
hall.

2008
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:33,760
Why did the Ventriloquist quit drinking?
He was I.

2009
01:28:33,761 --> 01:28:34,520
I'd like a room.

2010
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:35,030
Yeah.

2011
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:40,790
Well,
I and how to find folks and welcome back

2012
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:42,900
to d hall.
This is a really long video,

2013
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:43,540
so hold on,
hold on.

2014
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:44,110
Often

2015
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:52,740
it's an absolute pleasure to be here in 
the shade of an.

2016
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:59,410
He would be laughing if it weren't for 
the Patriots who answered the call of 

2017
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:03,680
freedom.
The aliens.

2018
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:09,220
It would explode our every weakness and 
suck the brains out of every living 

2019
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:13,851
soul.
They'd be laughing but not like you and 

2020
01:29:13,851 --> 01:29:13,851
me.
They'd go,

2021
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:27,520
this is making me dumb.
Or just watch a five minute video.

2022
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:31,400
That six minute video people really 
upset about this.

2023
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:35,240
It was on CNN.

2024
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,800
Charlton Heston movies are no longer the
angels

2025
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:52,170
masturbating with a gun in his hand

2026
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:57,900
from his goal.
That takes a trigger.

2027
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:10,140
We're watching mental illness.
This is madness that anybody put that 

2028
01:30:10,851 --> 01:30:12,380
together,
watched it and went.

2029
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,050
I think it's good.
Let's let this out,

2030
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:20,220
man.
Is your allergies really fucking you up 

2031
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:20,220
right now?
No.

2032
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:20,220
No,
no.

2033
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:24,010
Why?
Because it's like super extreme outside 

2034
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:26,381
right now.
Like for indoor allergens or dust and 

2035
01:30:26,381 --> 01:30:26,381
dander.
I don't have allergies.

2036
01:30:26,381 --> 01:30:26,820
Meaning that I'm lucky.
Yeah,

2037
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,330
I'm lucky.
Yeah,

2038
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:33,550
except a gluten intolerance.
I don't think I've ever seen a thing 

2039
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:37,370
like watched a cartoon or something like
that and been offended.

2040
01:30:37,371 --> 01:30:37,660
Like,
what?

2041
01:30:37,661 --> 01:30:39,470
What are you talking about?
How can anybody be offended?

2042
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:44,800
I'm offended that they stole three 
minutes of my time watching Jim Carrey 

2043
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,881
to a guy that died 80 years.
My belief system isn't that shot that 

2044
01:30:48,881 --> 01:30:48,881
I'm,
you know,

2045
01:30:48,881 --> 01:30:50,630
you're going to say something that's 
going to throw me into a tizzy.

2046
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:51,380
Well,
not only that,

2047
01:30:51,381 --> 01:30:54,030
but because there's a reaction to that 
where you,

2048
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:55,070
you.

2049
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:57,140
I mean,
he's obviously knowing that.

2050
01:30:57,141 --> 01:30:58,760
What he's doing is sort of 
controversial,

2051
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,190
so in,
in,

2052
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,190
in,
in that,

2053
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:04,580
in sort of accepting that what he's 
doing and what he's making fun of,

2054
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:08,630
it's so mild because it's like the fact 
that he's doing it at all because what's

2055
01:31:08,631 --> 01:31:10,920
supposed to be a controversial about it,
you know,

2056
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:16,040
he's always to mock Charlton Heston.
So you've got like this artificial like 

2057
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,870
energy that you think is attached to a 
bit,

2058
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:19,700
but that's something tached to a bit for
me.

2059
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,830
Okay.
Because it's not controversial to me.

2060
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:24,260
It's not at all.
So I just kind of dumb like,

2061
01:31:24,261 --> 01:31:26,030
why are you even thinking about Charlton
Heston?

2062
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:29,060
You're talking about a dead guy that 
says something weird a long time ago.

2063
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:31,250
Like if you were really.
If you really had something to say,

2064
01:31:31,251 --> 01:31:33,320
it should be a lot funnier than that.
I agree.

2065
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,340
Like that's silly.

2066
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:36,860
It's silly,
it's folly,

2067
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:41,410
but you always wonder,
like a guy like Jim Carey who starts off

2068
01:31:41,411 --> 01:31:43,850
as career with that sort of ace Ventura 
thing.

2069
01:31:43,851 --> 01:31:48,851
We've just,
or fire Marshall Bill number that 

2070
01:31:48,851 --> 01:31:49,200
completely over the top hilarious shit.
No,

2071
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,100
you can't do that when you're 60.
Okay.

2072
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,690
Nobody wants to see Jerry Lewis was 
fucking fake Japanese teeth when he's 60

2073
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:55,940
now.
He didn't want to see that.

2074
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:56,830
You know,
you,

2075
01:31:56,831 --> 01:32:00,970
you don't mind it when he's 25 or 30.
It's kind of silly and Wacky,

2076
01:32:01,330 --> 01:32:04,120
but you,
there's a transitionary period for those

2077
01:32:04,121 --> 01:32:08,110
types of comedians where it gets weird.
Shit gets weird when they're hitting 40,

2078
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,730
you know,
like Emo,

2079
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:12,130
Philips,
like sort of sort of dropped that thing,

2080
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:17,460
you know,
he will do a thing like this where he 

2081
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:17,890
would move all around the stage and 
talk,

2082
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:19,500
trying to crazy.
I can.

2083
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:21,820
I can never got that.
It hurts my brain.

2084
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,740
He doesn't do it anymore.
You can't do it anymore.

2085
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,840
Now I now he does stand up.
So it's like you're,

2086
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:29,200
you're in your,
you're in a trap like the,

2087
01:32:29,201 --> 01:32:29,590
you,
you're,

2088
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:30,260
you're,
you're,

2089
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:33,040
you're looking at a beautiful flower and
it ain't going to last.

2090
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:38,041
That's right.
You better learn how to reinvent 

2091
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:38,041
yourself right quick.
It's fucking hard.

2092
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:41,851
Well,
bobcat goldthwait eventually sort of 

2093
01:32:41,851 --> 01:32:44,250
reinvented himself.
I think he was held by that sort of 

2094
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:45,310
screaming,
which is hilarious.

2095
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:50,340
I mean,
when you nail something as good as his 

2096
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,040
character,
it must be so hard to let go.

2097
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,510
I mean,
that character,

2098
01:32:52,511 --> 01:32:57,511
that Bobcat goldthwait character and 
that he did so many fucking police 

2099
01:32:57,511 --> 01:32:58,360
academy movies.
He did comedy specials.

2100
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,310
You ever seen me?
You're listening to meet Bob.

2101
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,840
Who's a Sunday fucking great guy.
I know him.

2102
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:04,610
I mean,
I've worked with them.

2103
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,760
I've worked with him twice and he's a 
great guy.

2104
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,570
He's a really smart dude who's really 
kind of understated and quiet.

2105
01:33:10,571 --> 01:33:12,020
Actually.
Exact opposite.

2106
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:15,580
He had to.
He had abandoned the bobcat character.

2107
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:17,050
You know,
it makes me laugh.

2108
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,780
Do you know one of the funniest human 
being tough fucking planet is,

2109
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:21,350
um,
a.

2110
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,130
Oh God.
A botox.

2111
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:24,460
Ha.
Gilbert gottfried.

2112
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:25,190
The.
Oh,

2113
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:26,940
he's very funny.
Oh my gosh.

2114
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:29,320
We're just hanging out with that guy.
Oh my God.

2115
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:31,270
Well,
he's real old school.

2116
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:32,950
Legit comment.
You know what I mean?

2117
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:33,610
He's,
he's,

2118
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:36,430
he's been around forever.
Gilbert's been legit forever.

2119
01:33:36,431 --> 01:33:41,431
And he still,
he'll still tweet ridiculous shit and 

2120
01:33:41,431 --> 01:33:44,551
get fired from campaigns and shit.
And it's just because that's who he is 

2121
01:33:44,551 --> 01:33:44,551
and he's awesome.
You know,

2122
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:49,560
I celebrate that Shit.
I think that the kind of guys who say 

2123
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:51,520
like really ridiculous preposterous shit
and offensive shit,

2124
01:33:51,521 --> 01:33:51,880
like,
like,

2125
01:33:51,881 --> 01:33:56,881
uh,
Gilbert godfried and do it on a regular 

2126
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:58,441
basis,
that's why is it okay for you to have a 

2127
01:33:58,441 --> 01:34:01,420
movie where you're pretending that 
you're a bad guy shooting cops?

2128
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:06,480
Why is that okay?
And it's not okay for Gilbert gottfried 

2129
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,100
to pretend to be some crazy man who's 
making fun of aids.

2130
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:14,160
I called them up.
I called him up to it and aids for 

2131
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:14,950
children with AIDS benefit that I do 
every year and I couldn't,

2132
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:19,980
I couldn't,
I couldn't even send that to the minute 

2133
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:19,980
he goes,
Bob,

2134
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:19,980
that kids with,
hey,

2135
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:23,890
stop using drugs.
And he just kept saying it over and over

2136
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:26,440
again.
I'm fucking dying.

2137
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:29,120
I'm not doing.
I like it.

2138
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,910
He just wouldn't let me get it out.
And he hung up on me.

2139
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:32,460
I was like,
all right,

2140
01:34:32,461 --> 01:34:34,630
well he's legit.
He's the real deal,

2141
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:36,640
you know,
he's a real comic.

2142
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:41,880
He's so funny.
Do you know that feeling like a real 

2143
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:41,880
comic?
You know,

2144
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,110
we all have that thing where there's,
there's,

2145
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:46,450
what is it?
It's being.

2146
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:50,560
When you say that you guys real comic,
and I know exactly what you mean,

2147
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:54,090
not being as some phony being you're 
being,

2148
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:54,670
you know,
you,

2149
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:58,010
you believe the person.
That's who that guy is,

2150
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,720
man,
I'm for better or for worse,

2151
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:04,900
that's who he is on stage that had been 
run into a comic at the airport and it's

2152
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:08,690
like Chucky Mc fuck-all sticks and like 
some,

2153
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:12,500
some do.
That's hacking it up around all over the

2154
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:13,910
country and you know,
one of those guys,

2155
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:15,230
he's just like,
oh Jesus,

2156
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:15,700
like,
oh,

2157
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:20,000
you'll hide your head and look down,
but if you see bill burr,

2158
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:21,760
you know you're going to go like bell.
What's up?

2159
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,130
I feel good about the world.
You see God don't break.

2160
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:25,130
Oh,
that guy's legit.

2161
01:35:25,131 --> 01:35:26,960
That's a real guy.
A real human being.

2162
01:35:26,961 --> 01:35:29,330
I can actually have a conversation with.
Well not only that,

2163
01:35:29,331 --> 01:35:30,890
I mean,
it's like when you run into them,

2164
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:34,310
if you run into a fellow comedian,
it's like it's a,

2165
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,750
it's sort of a rare fraternity.
Yes.

2166
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,250
There's not a lot of us out there.
No.

2167
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:41,140
If you get lucky and run into one when 
you're on the road,

2168
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:41,990
a language,
you know,

2169
01:35:41,991 --> 01:35:44,830
there's an intimacy there that like sort
of that you know,

2170
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,210
that you can't have an experience that 
most people haven't had,

2171
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:48,830
you know,
that you have.

2172
01:35:49,130 --> 01:35:51,020
You can't really share with other people
as much,

2173
01:35:51,021 --> 01:35:51,730
you know,
like,

2174
01:35:51,731 --> 01:35:53,420
just the would be like that with 
everything.

2175
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,790
I mean,
it must be like that for brain surgeons,

2176
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:56,530
you know,
imagine this,

2177
01:35:56,540 --> 01:36:01,540
be like some famous neurosurgeon and all
of a sudden you're on a flight with 

2178
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:01,540
another famous neurosurgeon.
Like,

2179
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:05,951
oh,
well do you believe you've been using 

2180
01:36:05,951 --> 01:36:05,951
for techniques and finding that stumps 
blood clots,

2181
01:36:05,951 --> 01:36:05,951
you know,
like it's,

2182
01:36:05,951 --> 01:36:08,270
it seems like that would be the case 
with everything,

2183
01:36:08,690 --> 01:36:13,690
you know,
just sort of massage she was talking 

2184
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:13,690
about that you find,
you know,

2185
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:15,320
whatever it is,
find what it is.

2186
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:16,070
It's a language.

2187
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:16,580
I mean,
you know,

2188
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,100
it's a language.
Every.

2189
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:19,240
Everything is the language.
You know,

2190
01:36:19,241 --> 01:36:24,241
you,
you get more and more fluent with 

2191
01:36:24,241 --> 01:36:24,241
things.
I mean,

2192
01:36:24,241 --> 01:36:24,241
think about what Jujitsu is.
Jujitsu,

2193
01:36:24,241 --> 01:36:24,410
language,
man's physical language,

2194
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:27,470
you know,
and there are answers to what,

2195
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,340
what somebody gives to you and,
and,

2196
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,720
and,
and somebody doesn't speak that language

2197
01:36:32,721 --> 01:36:34,340
is fucked.
Yeah,

2198
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,540
you know,
everything is that way.

2199
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:40,570
And by the way,
it's also part of that language is 

2200
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:40,570
rhythm.
There's a rhythm,

2201
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:41,360
there's a,
there's a speed,

2202
01:36:41,361 --> 01:36:44,840
there's a tempo to everything that you 
do and it varies on what you're doing,

2203
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,090
you know,
that there's a and,

2204
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:52,240
and,
and your personality informs what that 

2205
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:52,240
rhythm is.
You know,

2206
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:55,301
some guys when they do get to her 
fucking explosive and crazy and then 

2207
01:36:55,301 --> 01:36:56,180
other guys are really passive and just 
lock you up when they need to.

2208
01:36:56,550 --> 01:37:00,560
Just all depends on what your expression
of the thing it is you're doing,

2209
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:05,561
you know,
and you can always feel and you can 

2210
01:37:05,561 --> 01:37:07,781
always tell when someone is authentic,
not only because they last for a long 

2211
01:37:07,821 --> 01:37:09,290
time,
but I really think human beings have.

2212
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:12,980
You're keyed in.
We all have antenna for what's legit.

2213
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,250
We all have like,
like sensitive antenna for what's.

2214
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:18,500
You can get fooled for a little while 
when you're young,

2215
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:21,000
but at the end of the day,
you know,

2216
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:24,200
I think we all have a sort of A.
I think if you're lying to yourself,

2217
01:37:24,201 --> 01:37:27,590
you can get fooled fairly easily.
That's the thing with these scams.

2218
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:31,520
Most people are aligned to themselves.
Most people have to lie to themselves in

2219
01:37:31,521 --> 01:37:34,910
order to keep a job or a wife,
a husband or you know,

2220
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:35,780
there's a little bit.
Yeah,

2221
01:37:35,781 --> 01:37:38,420
it was a lot of people that have to kind
of bullshit themselves,

2222
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:40,220
you know,
and uh,

2223
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:43,100
it's not even that they have to bullshit
themselves.

2224
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:48,130
It also could be that they got on a path
of bullshitting themselves at one point 

2225
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:50,690
in time to sort of access too thick and 
too many responsibilities without though

2226
01:37:50,691 --> 01:37:53,840
they've moved on in their career.
They're moving forward in life.

2227
01:37:53,841 --> 01:37:56,050
Like I knew a dude who was a,
he

2228
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:57,450
had done movies,
okay,

2229
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:00,540
but he was still full of shit.
It was like a movie star.

2230
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:05,570
But he would lie to you.
He would lie to you about like fake 

2231
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:08,511
kickboxing matches that he had talked to
you about all these different things 

2232
01:38:08,511 --> 01:38:08,700
that he was doing.
He definitely wasn't doing it.

2233
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:13,720
He would just make shit up so he.
He had still been connected to the all 

2234
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,390
this whatever,
whatever negative thing that he had held

2235
01:38:15,391 --> 01:38:20,391
onto it.
He's still never realized how to let it 

2236
01:38:20,391 --> 01:38:21,150
go while he was advancing and all these 
other areas in his life.

2237
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:25,320
So while he becoming a successful 
millionaire movie star,

2238
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:28,170
he was also still a liar.
You see that a lot.

2239
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:31,050
I know.
I know somebody who's got just this like

2240
01:38:31,051 --> 01:38:34,500
on paper,
their life is so fucking amazing.

2241
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:37,830
They're looking lots of money,
crazy,

2242
01:38:37,831 --> 01:38:39,660
nice house,
healthy,

2243
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:41,610
great kids,
successful,

2244
01:38:41,611 --> 01:38:46,611
and they are taking lots of anti 
depressants just to get out of bed 

2245
01:38:46,611 --> 01:38:50,301
because there's something fucking and 
it's not a chemical thing so much for 

2246
01:38:50,301 --> 01:38:50,301
them.

2247
01:38:50,301 --> 01:38:52,110
It's just this malaise,
dissatisfaction,

2248
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:54,300
anxiety.
They're always suffering from.

2249
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:56,490
Well,
I think it's also an example,

2250
01:38:56,510 --> 01:39:01,510
an excellent example of that super 
complicated machine being run by an 

2251
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:06,171
incompetent driver.
If it's not an emotional or it's not a 

2252
01:39:06,171 --> 01:39:10,640
chemical problem in your brain,
if it's not a disease or a disorder 

2253
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:15,591
that's giving you the wrong amount of 
hormones and it's some sort of a 

2254
01:39:15,591 --> 01:39:18,780
behavioral issue that you've picked up 
over the years and a pattern of you keep

2255
01:39:18,781 --> 01:39:22,680
repeating over and over again,
that's a sign of someone who was given a

2256
01:39:22,681 --> 01:39:27,681
very complicated thing,
human life and didn't know how to fuck 

2257
01:39:27,681 --> 01:39:28,770
to drive it.
Just slammed it into trees and fucked it

2258
01:39:28,771 --> 01:39:31,530
up and got hooked on meth and just went 
crazy with it.

2259
01:39:31,531 --> 01:39:36,531
Didn't know what it was doing right?
Instead of someone who like who had 

2260
01:39:36,531 --> 01:39:39,801
never lived in a physical form,
you ethereal and nature and the universe

2261
01:39:40,051 --> 01:39:40,860
gives you an opportunity.

2262
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:41,310
Hey,
listen,

2263
01:39:41,311 --> 01:39:44,520
we've got an opening down on earth.
If you want a,

2264
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:48,720
we have a baby human available loving 
household.

2265
01:39:48,721 --> 01:39:53,721
Everyone is dedicated to the idea of 
taking this baby human and developing 

2266
01:39:53,721 --> 01:39:58,000
into a full form functional human being.
So you've got an excellent support 

2267
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,731
system behind you,
but you're going to have to start from 

2268
01:40:01,731 --> 01:40:01,731
scratch.
Okay?

2269
01:40:01,731 --> 01:40:04,701
You're gonna know no knowledge 
whatsoever right out of the gate you're 

2270
01:40:04,701 --> 01:40:08,631
going to have to.
People will teach you at first and then 

2271
01:40:08,631 --> 01:40:08,880
you're gonna have to develop a voracious
appetite for knowledge.

2272
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:14,090
All in all,
it's going to take about shit 30 years 

2273
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:16,911
before you even know how to fucking do 
anything correctly or fit in with the 

2274
01:40:16,911 --> 01:40:18,270
other people in your realm,
but hey,

2275
01:40:18,271 --> 01:40:20,550
it's better than being gas,
so what do you want to do?

2276
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:23,100
Do you want to be a spirit of the next 
stage of afterlife,

2277
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:29,690
fucking chance and ride a human flesh 
machines to the brink of the end of 

2278
01:40:31,381 --> 01:40:32,610
civilization.
Come on.

2279
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:34,990
I liked that.
He said,

2280
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:39,270
that's a really cool theme to write a 
story about.

2281
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:44,360
You want to be gas,
you want to ride this human flesh 

2282
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:46,521
machine.
It's very possible that that's what 

2283
01:40:46,521 --> 01:40:46,521
happened.
I mean,

2284
01:40:46,521 --> 01:40:47,550
this idea of like the world being a 
simulation.

2285
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:50,610
Maybe it's not a simulation in a sense 
that maybe a session,

2286
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:54,520
maybe the whole thing is fucking crazy 
and blips

2287
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:59,520
in and out of realities and maybe you 
are some sort of gaseous sole form in 

2288
01:41:00,381 --> 01:41:05,381
another dimension and then you live this
life as a person and then you pop out 

2289
01:41:05,381 --> 01:41:06,070
the other side and and or some other 
thing that's so crazy.

2290
01:41:06,071 --> 01:41:11,071
You can't even imagine it right now 
because it's not in the realm of 

2291
01:41:11,071 --> 01:41:12,550
experiences that a human can possibly 
experience on this earth.

2292
01:41:12,551 --> 01:41:16,840
So much like having a crazy six grand 
mushroom trip until you've done it.

2293
01:41:16,841 --> 01:41:21,841
You don't.
You can't even imagine what you're 

2294
01:41:21,841 --> 01:41:23,641
talking about here.
You can't imagine it and so when you 

2295
01:41:23,641 --> 01:41:23,641
talk about it,
you're just talking nonsense.

2296
01:41:23,641 --> 01:41:28,101
You just making noises with your mouth.
So when we leave this and move to the 

2297
01:41:28,101 --> 01:41:28,570
next thing,
if it is,

2298
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:33,750
if there is such a reality and it's 
possible that the next thing will be so 

2299
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:37,331
fucking strange,
you can't even imagine like instead of 

2300
01:41:37,331 --> 01:41:40,210
thinking about ourselves as this 
disconnected a human being,

2301
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:43,360
driving around in cars and using the 
Internet,

2302
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:48,010
the next thing could be no physical body
at all,

2303
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:53,240
but,
but just constantly connected with a 

2304
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,461
tangible feeling of contact of other 
entities and lifeforms and souls and 

2305
01:41:57,221 --> 01:41:57,620
pattern.

2306
01:41:57,620 --> 01:42:00,370
It's almost like being part of the 
Matrix as part of the Internet,

2307
01:42:00,371 --> 01:42:00,760
right?
I mean,

2308
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:06,120
if you think about that,
that's certainly what I'm just 

2309
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,331
listening.
I'm listening to fucking all the 

2310
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:09,331
socrates and they says,
you know,

2311
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:09,331
you're,
you're kind of in prison by this body,

2312
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:14,430
this body that kind of breaks down this 
body that distracts you constantly with 

2313
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:15,520
your appetites,
with food,

2314
01:42:15,521 --> 01:42:16,900
sex,
and just pain,

2315
01:42:16,901 --> 01:42:21,901
sleep and all the things.
And it distracts you from the work at 

2316
01:42:21,901 --> 01:42:25,411
hand.
The real work that did this 

2317
01:42:25,411 --> 01:42:25,411
contemplation on,
on,

2318
01:42:25,411 --> 01:42:25,411
you know,
the truth.

2319
01:42:25,411 --> 01:42:27,880
Getting to the truth of the essence of 
things.

2320
01:42:27,881 --> 01:42:28,130
And,
and,

2321
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:29,710
and it's true.
It's like,

2322
01:42:29,711 --> 01:42:32,110
if you think about it,
the idea is he says,

2323
01:42:32,111 --> 01:42:33,400
he as he was dying,
he goes,

2324
01:42:33,401 --> 01:42:33,820
look,
man,

2325
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:38,260
I spent my whole life trying to separate
myself from this physical body,

2326
01:42:38,261 --> 01:42:40,480
like I treat all my appetite's with 
quiet contempt.

2327
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:45,760
And he says,
finally I get to be rid of this shit 

2328
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:45,760
and,
and just be a mind.

2329
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,900
And he was like really looking forward 
to.

2330
01:42:46,901 --> 01:42:51,901
It's kind of profound.
That's a great statement that he treats 

2331
01:42:51,901 --> 01:42:53,350
all of his appetites with content.
That's a great sense,

2332
01:42:53,351 --> 01:42:58,351
right?
And so many intellectual sort of share 

2333
01:42:58,351 --> 01:42:58,510
that they call it the hair loss,
the first journey,

2334
01:42:58,511 --> 01:43:02,440
your hunger or your sexuality or as it 
is a distraction.

2335
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:04,330
It is,
it should be treated with quiet contempt

2336
01:43:04,331 --> 01:43:07,720
as you know it should,
it should be treated as the last fucking

2337
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:10,690
gasps of a fun life.
Jesus Christ.

2338
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:15,700
We want to just sit around with no 
boners on your couch reading a dumb 

2339
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:19,471
book.
But the idea is actually getting to the 

2340
01:43:19,471 --> 01:43:19,471
essence of the truth is more fun,
you know,

2341
01:43:19,471 --> 01:43:20,650
but uh,
and it's,

2342
01:43:20,651 --> 01:43:21,210
you know,
it's,

2343
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:21,750
it's,
uh,

2344
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,400
it's getting the essence of the truth is
more fun.

2345
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:29,400
But ultimately,
if you are to believe that this is a 

2346
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:29,400
temporary existence,
it's fruitless.

2347
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:29,950
Doesn't matter.
Well,

2348
01:43:29,951 --> 01:43:32,080
that's what she'd been enjoying this 
ride.

2349
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:34,390
That was aristotle's rebuttal to 
socrates.

2350
01:43:34,391 --> 01:43:35,770
Aristotle said,
yes,

2351
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:41,100
yes,
we should try to strive to be just a 

2352
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:41,100
mind.
But by the way,

2353
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,981
watch a woman give child birth and you 
tell me we're not physical fucking 

2354
01:43:43,981 --> 01:43:44,470
beings.
We're physical beings with appetites and

2355
01:43:44,471 --> 01:43:49,471
you can get yourself to a point where 
you feel really good physically and 

2356
01:43:49,471 --> 01:43:49,471
mentally.
So why not do that?

2357
01:43:49,471 --> 01:43:51,340
You know what I always say when it comes
to socrates,

2358
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,310
this is an important

2359
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:55,230
one to repeat whenever anybody says 
anything about soccer too.

2360
01:43:55,231 --> 01:43:56,930
So you should always include.
Yeah.

2361
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,000
And you know,
he fucked a lot of dudes.

2362
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,100
He actually didn't invent.
Yes,

2363
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:06,101
I love all his friends.
Did you fuck some boys soccer days 

2364
01:44:06,101 --> 01:44:09,190
folks?
And one of the things that Credo always 

2365
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:11,771
complained about as he tried to seduce 
them and citizen because he was married 

2366
01:44:11,771 --> 01:44:12,130
with two kids and he could never do it 
to do so.

2367
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:13,520
No creative,
try to seduce them.

2368
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:14,930
Socrates,
socrates,

2369
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:18,650
they talk about that motherfucker stand 
there during the war and he used to.

2370
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:20,330
He could nobody,
nobody.

2371
01:44:20,331 --> 01:44:25,331
They said with Dan,
lack of sleep cold and lack of food 

2372
01:44:25,331 --> 01:44:29,681
better than socrates,
nobody can drink more wine and stay 

2373
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:31,811
sober.
And one day he stopped and he started 

2374
01:44:31,811 --> 01:44:34,541
thinking and the soldiers,
garlic shitty town of he's thinking and 

2375
01:44:34,541 --> 01:44:38,231
they all sat there and watched him think
and they took bets on how long he'd 

2376
01:44:38,231 --> 01:44:38,231
stand in one place.

2377
01:44:38,231 --> 01:44:42,730
And pretty soon the stan started to come
down and they pulled their fucking cops 

2378
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:45,971
out to watch him sleep.
And he stood there all fucking night 

2379
01:44:45,971 --> 01:44:47,750
figuring out this problem.
The answer to an issue.

2380
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:49,070
To me,
meanwhile,

2381
01:44:49,071 --> 01:44:52,280
I bet that's a lie.
I bet that never happened.

2382
01:44:52,281 --> 01:44:55,940
I bet.
Exaggerate the shit out of everything.

2383
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:58,300
Remember talking about,
in fact,

2384
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:03,310
I didn't even know them.
We did that about my talk when I'm 

2385
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:03,310
saying we all do that,
but our teacher's like,

2386
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:04,390
Oh yeah,
your fight teacher.

2387
01:45:04,391 --> 01:45:06,110
The greatest,
you know he can jump over trains.

2388
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:11,120
Right?
What studies this Kung Fu with allows 

2389
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:11,870
them to kill Moose with his fucking bare
hands.

2390
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:13,880
Yeah.
Who knows my.

2391
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:15,620
When you get to those kind of stories,
it's like,

2392
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,510
God,
what really did happen?

2393
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:22,540
Who is who is responsible for writing 
down the actual events of the time and 

2394
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:25,040
it's funny because if you just go with 
human nature,

2395
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,240
we would always think,
yeah,

2396
01:45:26,241 --> 01:45:29,230
what's wrong with a little elaboration?

2397
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:32,000
I'm going to spice it up.
Good for the Romans.

2398
01:45:32,001 --> 01:45:34,010
Look,
we did a great job.

2399
01:45:34,011 --> 01:45:38,150
We brought them civilization and no,
he didn't kill that many babies.

2400
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:41,520
They say we killed babies.
Like whatever,

2401
01:45:41,521 --> 01:45:46,521
man.
There are people with insane powers of 

2402
01:45:46,521 --> 01:45:47,330
concentration that can sit and not move 
for 24 hours.

2403
01:45:47,331 --> 01:45:47,770
Yeah,
they're,

2404
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:49,100
they're,
they're autistic.

2405
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,040
Yeah.
Well,

2406
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:50,810
now that,
there,

2407
01:45:50,811 --> 01:45:55,811
there,
there are people who like somerset mom 

2408
01:45:55,811 --> 01:45:55,811
wrote a book called the stone arguments 
man,

2409
01:45:55,811 --> 01:45:55,811
bro,
Bro,

2410
01:45:55,811 --> 01:45:58,340
I got this one.
You're actually,

2411
01:45:58,490 --> 01:45:59,870
you're actually,
if you're intense,

2412
01:45:59,871 --> 01:46:02,700
you'll play quake for 15.
That's why I won't play it.

2413
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:07,640
That's amazing.
You've always been insanely intensive.

2414
01:46:07,641 --> 01:46:08,690
I said I remember I said,
hey,

2415
01:46:08,691 --> 01:46:09,700
you should try golf.
He,

2416
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:12,710
I'm not fucking playing golf.
If you get into it and it'll be over.

2417
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:13,730
No,
no,

2418
01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:15,530
no,
because you'll go crazy.

2419
01:46:15,531 --> 01:46:16,190
Yeah.
If I.

2420
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:18,350
If I got into golf and started taking 
lessons,

2421
01:46:18,351 --> 01:46:19,280
I would play golf all day.

2422
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:22,280
That shit takes a long time.
Like if I could play pool,

2423
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,170
you know you can play pool for a half 
hour,

2424
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:25,070
right?
You can go and you go,

2425
01:46:25,071 --> 01:46:25,730
hey,
I got a half hour.

2426
01:46:25,731 --> 01:46:30,731
You wanna hit some balls around and you 
can enjoy yourself a half an hour 

2427
01:46:30,731 --> 01:46:30,731
office,
five hours every time you do it right.

2428
01:46:30,731 --> 01:46:31,790
You gotta walk,
you gotTa follow that,

2429
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:33,830
take a cart.
Whatever you gotta do you gotta drive.

2430
01:46:33,831 --> 01:46:38,831
Then you got to follow.
You're hitting this thing and it's 

2431
01:46:38,831 --> 01:46:38,831
fucking.
Why do you tell your car?

2432
01:46:38,831 --> 01:46:42,261
That's kind of a bitch mode because I 
get exhausted playing golf because some 

2433
01:46:42,261 --> 01:46:45,840
shit.
Some things make me feel like I have 

2434
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,310
diabetes tagged with my five year old 
and fucking and fucking golf.

2435
01:46:46,311 --> 01:46:49,560
Some shit is just too.
I don't know what you're talking about.

2436
01:46:49,561 --> 01:46:50,250
Jujitsu

2437
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,320
and kettle bells.
I'm not one of those chimp kettlebells.

2438
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:55,910
Do that shit right now.
Walk though and play golf to golf.

2439
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:57,790
I get exhausted.
It's too much.

2440
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,630
I walked a mile.
My legs,

2441
01:46:59,650 --> 01:47:02,040
my legs.
I can't.

2442
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:03,510
If I'm bored,
I fucking.

2443
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:04,950
I fall asleep.
Well,

2444
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:07,050
you remember the steven no hunting 
thing,

2445
01:47:07,051 --> 01:47:12,051
which comes out April 28th on the sports
network were Brian and I went out to say

2446
01:47:12,570 --> 01:47:15,340
what it is a sportsman's network 
outdoors channeling you.

2447
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:19,630
I loved watching Joe and I just watched 
it and I was so.

2448
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:22,080
All these great memories were brought 
back,

2449
01:47:22,081 --> 01:47:23,550
but I was really impressed.
I thought it was.

2450
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:25,380
They did it.
They did a really good job.

2451
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:27,630
Matt shot at well,
they edited it well.

2452
01:47:27,631 --> 01:47:29,310
It was funny.
Great music.

2453
01:47:29,311 --> 01:47:30,870
By the way.
This is bullshit,

2454
01:47:30,871 --> 01:47:32,370
man.
Sportsmans channel.

2455
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:37,460
It is a two point one rating an imd be 
fucking silly.

2456
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,300
Liberals are going to be famous.
Here's the thing.

2457
01:47:42,301 --> 01:47:47,301
First of all,
that is so wrong because it was a great 

2458
01:47:47,301 --> 01:47:47,430
show.
That is a.

2459
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:49,170
This is the only show.
Okay.

2460
01:47:49,171 --> 01:47:52,320
If you,
if you're like me and you have any,

2461
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:55,110
if you eat meat,
okay,

2462
01:47:55,200 --> 01:48:00,200
and you have any desire for some sort of
intellectual connection to the animal 

2463
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:05,571
that cheat.
There's not a lot of people that 

2464
01:48:05,571 --> 01:48:05,571
represent you.
If you're a thinking person,

2465
01:48:05,571 --> 01:48:07,230
it's not a lot of people that represent 
you.

2466
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:12,380
In the sportsman's world.
We have this idea that sportsmen and 

2467
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:14,880
hunters are this like these idiots,
these,

2468
01:48:14,881 --> 01:48:19,881
these fucking numb minded Republican 
Republican robots and they're out there 

2469
01:48:22,381 --> 01:48:24,450
just fucking shooting animals because 
they're evil.

2470
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:27,720
Watch this show because this is not that
at all.

2471
01:48:27,721 --> 01:48:31,620
This is Steve Rinella who's a good 
friend now to Brian and myself.

2472
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:36,920
He's an awesome guy and a really well 
read individual with a deep knowledge of

2473
01:48:37,441 --> 01:48:42,441
especially the history of the 
colonization of the West and and a deep 

2474
01:48:43,171 --> 01:48:48,171
love for animals,
but deep love for animals and an 

2475
01:48:48,171 --> 01:48:50,751
understanding of the whole process of 
acquiring your own meat and the way he 

2476
01:48:51,781 --> 01:48:53,370
does it,
he does it through this idea.

2477
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:56,890
It's called fair chase hunting where 
he's not like,

2478
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:59,070
sometimes they'll like setup and I don't
have a problem with this.

2479
01:48:59,071 --> 01:49:01,350
I'm just saying this is one of the ways 
that people go hunting.

2480
01:49:01,351 --> 01:49:06,351
It makes it more effective.
Like you'll set out bait and the animal 

2481
01:49:06,351 --> 01:49:08,190
will come to the food and then when it's
at the food you're hiding in a blind and

2482
01:49:08,191 --> 01:49:11,420
you shoot it.
That's like super calm after that.

2483
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:14,550
That's Ted nugent's entire show by the 
way.

2484
01:49:14,551 --> 01:49:16,740
I like Ted nugent and I liked Ted nugent
show.

2485
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:19,290
I don't agree with them on a lot of his 
things that he says,

2486
01:49:19,291 --> 01:49:24,291
especially when it comes to politics and
there's a lot of nonsense and a lot of 

2487
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:24,720
his words.
But I think,

2488
01:49:24,721 --> 01:49:29,721
uh,
he's a fascinating character and he's 

2489
01:49:29,721 --> 01:49:29,790
out there shooting animals and telling 
everybody to go fuck themselves.

2490
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:34,970
He shot a coyote in the head with a,
with an air rifle on the show and then 

2491
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:35,370
was like,
oh look,

2492
01:49:35,371 --> 01:49:39,330
a great coyote threw it in the back of 
his Ted fucking new children.

2493
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:40,740
One with an air rifle.
Yeah.

2494
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:42,270
Think about this.
This is not,

2495
01:49:42,330 --> 01:49:47,330
I mean this is like he's a big rock star
and at one point in time when I was a 

2496
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:48,070
kid,
Ted nugent was fucking huge.

2497
01:49:48,150 --> 01:49:53,150
Lot of cons to this day,
stranglehold is one of my all time 

2498
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:57,190
favorite.
Classic rock hits the live version.

2499
01:49:57,340 --> 01:50:02,140
You got me in that.
God Damn Amazing.

2500
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:03,190
He's.
He's crazy though,

2501
01:50:03,191 --> 01:50:06,280
but I like them.
I know I don't like me.

2502
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:07,540
No,
I don't like everything about them.

2503
01:50:07,541 --> 01:50:12,541
I don't like them all across the board,
but Steve Rinella represents a 

2504
01:50:12,541 --> 01:50:16,051
completely different time.
He's not Ted nugent's leaving bait out 

2505
01:50:16,051 --> 01:50:20,110
and he shoot.
He shot three deer with a bow and Arrow 

2506
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:21,040
in the first 15 minutes of just show the
other day.

2507
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:23,320
I mean,
I don't even know.

2508
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:25,750
I mean how many they let you eat that 
much.

2509
01:50:25,751 --> 01:50:27,220
He's got to give away a lot.

2510
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:27,970
He gives away.
Yeah.

2511
01:50:27,971 --> 01:50:29,890
Yeah.
Hunters for the homeless are hunters for

2512
01:50:29,891 --> 01:50:31,210
the hungry rather.
But yeah,

2513
01:50:31,211 --> 01:50:31,560
they,
they,

2514
01:50:31,561 --> 01:50:33,550
they know.
They know animal goes to waste.

2515
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:35,890
They mean he has a guy that butchers and
shit.

2516
01:50:35,891 --> 01:50:40,891
He's shown it on the show before.
That's not mean Ted nugent not doing 

2517
01:50:40,891 --> 01:50:41,140
that.
He's definitely given a lot of food way.

2518
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:42,850
He just likes doing it,
you know,

2519
01:50:42,851 --> 01:50:44,930
and whatever man the fuck,
I mean,

2520
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:46,420
what,
why is that bad?

2521
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:49,790
But the guy who runs this dairy farm or 
you know,

2522
01:50:49,791 --> 01:50:52,120
a slaughter and steers to make your 
cheeseburger,

2523
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,700
that guy is acceptable,
right?

2524
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:56,020
Like,
that doesn't make any sense the way he's

2525
01:50:56,021 --> 01:51:01,021
doing it.
Even the way Ted nugent doing it by 

2526
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:01,021
leaving out bait and shooting it with an
Arrow when it comes to eat.

2527
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:03,940
So fucking what?
That's still way more ethical.

2528
01:51:03,941 --> 01:51:05,050
Way Smarter.
Like,

2529
01:51:05,051 --> 01:51:06,100
why wouldn't you do that?

2530
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:11,100
Don't you have some extra corn?
What do you want to traipse around the 

2531
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:11,590
fucking forest looking for some animal?
Just leave the corn out.

2532
01:51:11,591 --> 01:51:12,220
Shoot it.
Well,

2533
01:51:12,221 --> 01:51:17,221
what's the goal?
The goal is you have to shoot it until 

2534
01:51:17,221 --> 01:51:17,221
you've been out there at five in the 
morning,

2535
01:51:17,221 --> 01:51:18,640
freezing your dick off after sleeping in
a tent.

2536
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:22,540
You fucking use bait right quick,
especially if you're a hungry man.

2537
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,190
This guy,
Steve Rinella,

2538
01:51:24,191 --> 01:51:27,760
though he doesn't do any of that.
His is all fair chase hunting and he's a

2539
01:51:27,761 --> 01:51:32,761
really bright guy and we have this 
really ignorant stereotype that people 

2540
01:51:34,121 --> 01:51:37,750
that grew up in sort of hunting,
fishing backgrounds are dummies.

2541
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:39,070
You know,
a lot of people do,

2542
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:41,890
a lot of people who don't have any 
experience in hunting.

2543
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:47,280
And I think the beautiful thing about 
this show is you guys are fucking great 

2544
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:47,280
writer.
I mean,

2545
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:47,280
he's a great writer.

2546
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,480
His book,
very good book.

2547
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:53,770
It's very,
he's just descriptions or captivate you.

2548
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:57,490
Like he's got a really intelligent way.
I learned a lot from.

2549
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,540
Yeah.
So uh,

2550
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:04,170
my parents about the difference between 
hunting in a blind or,

2551
01:52:04,171 --> 01:52:05,800
or fair chase hunting.
Yeah.

2552
01:52:05,801 --> 01:52:07,450
But I was talking about something before
that.

2553
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:12,470
I don't,
I don't remember what the hell it was 

2554
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:12,470
that's called going on,
a tangent son hit.

2555
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:17,400
But the people that have a problem with 
basically anything that people do 

2556
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:20,020
because people that have.
What about all the restaurants?

2557
01:52:20,021 --> 01:52:21,460
Everywhere you go,
they're serving me.

2558
01:52:21,490 --> 01:52:26,490
Like why are you freaking out about 
certain specific situations where you 

2559
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:26,760
find meat,
you know,

2560
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:29,680
and why is it really meet because are,
what are these animals?

2561
01:52:29,681 --> 01:52:30,700
Can they do,
if you don't eat them,

2562
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:33,390
are they just going to live forever or 
if they're not gonna live forever,

2563
01:52:33,391 --> 01:52:35,350
they going to live a certain amount of 
time and then what happens to the meat?

2564
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:37,720
Is it okay to feed it to dogs once they 
die of old age?

2565
01:52:37,721 --> 01:52:38,860
Is that.
Is that allowed?

2566
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:39,720
You know,
but what?

2567
01:52:39,721 --> 01:52:41,950
What do we do as humans to control the 
population?

2568
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:44,320
We have spent a lot of money on 
sterilization programs.

2569
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,040
What if our health deteriorates because 
we're

2570
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:51,040
not eating as much animal protein and 
other countries take over and start 

2571
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,420
dominating us.
Marcy ran the army.

2572
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:54,300
Do you now,
quickly,

2573
01:52:54,301 --> 01:52:58,570
we'd be over quickly.
The Soviets would fucking take over.

2574
01:52:58,610 --> 01:53:01,120
Think Putin would standard if one,
if Maurice,

2575
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:06,130
he became the president of the gun.
They these fucking meet headed fic tree 

2576
01:53:06,951 --> 01:53:11,951
trunk.
Next Russian cosmonauts would come 

2577
01:53:11,951 --> 01:53:12,020
running over and just dominate this 
country.

2578
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:14,390
She's turned into a bunch of 
Vegetarians.

2579
01:53:14,391 --> 01:53:15,650
That's.
We live in a hard world,

2580
01:53:15,651 --> 01:53:16,610
ladies and gentlemen.
Okay,

2581
01:53:16,611 --> 01:53:19,670
and you can't run it on lentils.
You just can't.

2582
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:24,980
Paula by general hugging.
You can't run it on lentils.

2583
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:26,690
Fox,
silly fucks.

2584
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:32,530
That's why he hasn't won.
I don't think they want a metal last 

2585
01:53:32,530 --> 01:53:32,530
Olympics.
I'm like,

2586
01:53:32,530 --> 01:53:36,131
come on guys,
you got a billion people I love and not 

2587
01:53:36,131 --> 01:53:36,131
making anybody from India.
I love India.

2588
01:53:36,131 --> 01:53:36,131
I love it.
But.

2589
01:53:36,131 --> 01:53:37,840
But like you're not athletic.

2590
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:39,380
They're not as athletic as some 
countries.

2591
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:41,300
Sweden,
it's got 7 million people.

2592
01:53:41,301 --> 01:53:46,301
They went like fucking 50 gold metals in
Olympics because meals are hot.

2593
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:51,650
One trying really hard to get laid and 
the only way to do that as be awesome at

2594
01:53:51,651 --> 01:53:55,090
a sport.
That's the quickest way to be funny you,

2595
01:53:55,110 --> 01:54:00,110
but even that's not provable enough.
As a young man you can't fuck with the 

2596
01:54:00,110 --> 01:54:01,640
quarterback.
Guy was a basketball star.

2597
01:54:01,641 --> 01:54:02,690
That guy,
that guy,

2598
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:05,420
the guy who hits the home runs.
That guy wins that guy.

2599
01:54:05,421 --> 01:54:10,421
When I was a wrestler,
they didn't come out to see me in my 

2600
01:54:10,421 --> 01:54:11,540
fucking single out at 125 pounds and not
give a fuck about shit about that.

2601
01:54:11,770 --> 01:54:16,770
Yeah.
They didn't give a fuck about wrestlers 

2602
01:54:16,770 --> 01:54:16,770
and they certainly weren't into fucking 
karate guys.

2603
01:54:16,770 --> 01:54:17,990
No,
you're a karate guy.

2604
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:19,580
Doing Great.
What do you wear?

2605
01:54:19,581 --> 01:54:23,030
Pajamas and fucking stick your feet and 
people's face and how stupid that is.

2606
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,160
No,
we can't have sex kit out of here,

2607
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:32,470
but the fucking quarterbacks,
they just have to beat them off with 

2608
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:34,220
sticks and get out of here.
You fucking opportunistic hooker.

2609
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,560
I'm going to go practice my sidekick.
I'll be right back.

2610
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,590
Yeah.
They like,

2611
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:40,160
what are you doing?
Why do you do that?

2612
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:42,720
Where do you do it?
What do you do that that's you.

2613
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:46,400
That's all you do.
Not Flashing to play another sport.

2614
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:49,100
Even the USC and now it's.
These guys were like bad asses and a lot

2615
01:54:49,101 --> 01:54:49,950
of girls like,
no,

2616
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:51,800
no.
Those guys hit each other and their ears

2617
01:54:51,801 --> 01:54:53,750
are all weird.
What are you talking about?

2618
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:57,150
Those?
Those guys have to beat it off with that

2619
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:58,360
in their circle.
They share.

2620
01:54:58,370 --> 01:55:02,420
It's crazy what girls girl just like 
hate each other.

2621
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:06,320
That is a broken bit.
Doesn't want to go on a wild ride.

2622
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:11,350
UFC guys don't get the same kind of 
attention that basketball football 

2623
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:11,350
players do.
Man,

2624
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:12,700
are you crazy?
You think you like garlic?

2625
01:55:12,701 --> 01:55:17,701
Chuck Odell in his prime.
You'd never seen anything like that in 

2626
01:55:17,701 --> 01:55:19,280
the face of the earth.
You've never seen fucking that guy would

2627
01:55:19,281 --> 01:55:21,950
show up when chuck Liddell was the 
fucking champion in the UFC,

2628
01:55:22,150 --> 01:55:24,890
the UFC light heavyweight champion,
and he wouldn't walk into a club.

2629
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:28,860
He W,
w you've never seen gravity like daily.

2630
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:33,370
He would suck in hot titted asteroids.
Boom.

2631
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:36,830
He was like Jupiter absorbing grit.
They were just hugging him,

2632
01:55:36,831 --> 01:55:39,110
wanting to take pictures with him and 
hugging him,

2633
01:55:39,111 --> 01:55:40,620
want to take pictures with them,
do it.

2634
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:41,840
It was a swarm.
It was like,

2635
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:45,330
have you seen that commercial for a 
World War z while the Zombie swarm?

2636
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:46,740
That's what it was.
When chocolate,

2637
01:55:46,741 --> 01:55:48,390
Dell would show up,
girls would just flock to him.

2638
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:49,350
He's the gladiator.

2639
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:54,500
They couldn't help the Alpha male he 
wanted to meet and they wanted to talk 

2640
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:54,500
to him and the guy like literally 
couldn't move through the room.

2641
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:59,350
I've never seen anything like it hung 
with Mike Tyson and they say the same 

2642
01:55:59,350 --> 01:55:59,640
thing.
No idea.

2643
01:55:59,641 --> 01:56:02,760
Especially because in Vegas a lot of 
those girls are drunk.

2644
01:56:03,330 --> 01:56:08,330
When you're drunk,
that's when the real thoughts come out 

2645
01:56:08,330 --> 01:56:11,320
and you're like a picture with my DNA.
Your DNA takes out.

2646
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:12,240
Give a fuck.
I'm gonna.

2647
01:56:12,241 --> 01:56:13,260
Tell him right now,
suck as God.

2648
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,220
I don't give a fuck.
That's my thing.

2649
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:16,830
I'm going to do it.
It should go.

2650
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:18,780
Meanwhile,
no girl would support that.

2651
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:21,480
It's like you fucking whore.
They might need them to,

2652
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:22,830
but I don't want you to suck his Dick 
First.

2653
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:23,610
Oh my God.

2654
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:28,760
Oh my God.
He and in his,

2655
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,270
uh,
his one man show,

2656
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:32,510
he starts by saying,
yeah,

2657
01:56:32,810 --> 01:56:34,780
if you with those coco cafe,
and it's,

2658
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:37,440
let me get one of those two buddy in his
one man show.

2659
01:56:37,441 --> 01:56:42,441
He basically says he puts up the number.
I didn't see it basically puts up the 

2660
01:56:42,441 --> 01:56:42,441
number 400 million.
And he goes,

2661
01:56:42,441 --> 01:56:45,110
I lost all that money.
Oh my gosh,

2662
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:50,160
Dale,
I made 400 million and I lost 400 

2663
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:50,160
million.
No Shit.

2664
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:50,400
You know?
But that's what happens.

2665
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:53,340
You just buy a bunch of tigers and just 
like fucking everything.

2666
01:56:53,690 --> 01:56:58,690
Well,
it's also the kind of mentality that 

2667
01:56:58,690 --> 01:57:00,980
allows you to become a prize fighter,
that kind of mentality that allows you 

2668
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:05,121
to be a person who risks his health and 
runs at men in a,

2669
01:57:06,491 --> 01:57:08,950
in a boxing ring and smashes that 
brands,

2670
01:57:09,190 --> 01:57:10,980
you know,
you're thinking about the moment,

2671
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:15,981
man,
you're thinking about training for your 

2672
01:57:15,981 --> 01:57:15,981
next fight.

2673
01:57:15,981 --> 01:57:15,981
You thinking about months of 
preparation,

2674
01:57:15,981 --> 01:57:17,550
you thinking about the fight itself.
You probably also have to be a little,

2675
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:19,740
like you have to be pretty aggro,
right?

2676
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:25,430
For sure.
But it's also like someone telling you 

2677
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:25,430
what you can and can't do with your 
money.

2678
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:25,430
But like bitch,
I'm Hector Camacho.

2679
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:30,111
I'll do whatever the fuck I want.
I'm going to get my trio man in 

2680
01:57:30,111 --> 01:57:30,111
diamonds.
Suck my Dick.

2681
01:57:30,111 --> 01:57:30,111
Okay.
Alright.

2682
01:57:30,111 --> 01:57:31,830
So it's going to say macho man,
suck my Dick.

2683
01:57:32,930 --> 01:57:35,880
You get whatever you want.
I mean if you're a champion,

2684
01:57:35,881 --> 01:57:40,881
it's almost like you have to have that 
mentality to be that Mike Tyson type of 

2685
01:57:40,881 --> 01:57:41,130
a character.
You know,

2686
01:57:41,131 --> 01:57:43,230
Bernard Hopkins,
like famously frugal,

2687
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,400
you know,
he uh,

2688
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:49,460
he's just a smart disciplined guy that's
still at 48 years old world boxing 

2689
01:57:49,460 --> 01:57:51,180
champion.
The craziest thing I've ever.

2690
01:57:51,181 --> 01:57:56,181
No one's ever done that before.
No one's ever done at 48 years old and 

2691
01:57:56,181 --> 01:57:56,181
look fucking good.

2692
01:57:56,181 --> 01:57:57,330
He looked great.
He box the shit out of that dude.

2693
01:57:57,331 --> 01:57:59,170
It wasn't,
it wasn't a close to crazy.

2694
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:01,890
He's a master.
He's a master.

2695
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:05,700
He's a master boxer,
but he's like Super Frugal,

2696
01:58:05,850 --> 01:58:08,160
you know?
But his style is like super frugal.

2697
01:58:08,161 --> 01:58:10,320
That's why at 48 years old,
he's still in the mix.

2698
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:12,140
Whereas a guy like Mike Tyson,
when she says,

2699
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:18,030
and he fucking,
he raged for a few years and then done 

2700
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:20,220
Mike Tyson and Bernard Hopkins,
they were boxing at the same time.

2701
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:22,750
You know Bernard Hopkins is older.
Yeah.

2702
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:25,620
Bernard Hopkins is the older man and 
they were bought in.

2703
01:58:25,621 --> 01:58:28,500
Bernard Hopkins is still a world 
champion,

2704
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:32,830
still speaks fluent is no voice 
problems.

2705
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:35,450
So articulate so articulately,
does not get hit very well.

2706
01:58:35,790 --> 01:58:37,740
Knows how to roll with things.
He's never been hurt.

2707
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:39,630
Never been hurt even when he's been 
tagged.

2708
01:58:39,631 --> 01:58:41,320
But he's been tagged by guys in drop 
them,

2709
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:41,980
you know,

2710
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:45,010
he just starts boxing and he's 
disciplined is fuck.

2711
01:58:45,011 --> 01:58:47,920
And he sticks that fucking boxing game 
in your face.

2712
01:58:48,010 --> 01:58:52,270
And slowly but surely he starts to 
overwhelm when he beat Kelly pavlick and

2713
01:58:52,271 --> 01:58:54,250
he goes,
he grabbed him apparently,

2714
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:55,720
and he said,
don't let this ruin you.

2715
01:58:56,270 --> 01:58:57,700
You know,
he uh,

2716
01:58:57,970 --> 01:59:00,580
he knew he was going to be the money 
walk in the ring to be that good.

2717
01:59:00,581 --> 01:59:02,940
Kelly Pavlich was a fucking killer.
That's a,

2718
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:08,170
that's an exceptional fight.
But the defining fight was Felix 

2719
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:10,870
Trinidad because Felix Trinidad was 
thought to be a destroyer.

2720
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:15,990
I mean,
people were setting up Felix Trinidad 

2721
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:15,990
to,
to,

2722
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:15,990
you know,
fight all these super fights.

2723
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:18,040
Wasn't going to fight Oscar de la Hoya,
he's gonna fight like a lot of different

2724
01:59:18,041 --> 01:59:23,041
people at Felix Trinidad was a killer.
He's a serious high level dangerous 

2725
01:59:23,041 --> 01:59:27,061
threat.
And Bernard Hopkins blocked his fucking 

2726
01:59:27,061 --> 01:59:30,720
face off.
He just boxed his fucking ears off 

2727
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:31,570
credible and,
and just shut them down.

2728
01:59:31,570 --> 01:59:34,450
And it was amazing that people thought 
the Trinidad was the favorite going into

2729
01:59:34,451 --> 01:59:38,530
that fight because Bernard Hopkins 
fucking dominated him.

2730
01:59:38,620 --> 01:59:43,620
I mean,
he dominated him and he stopped him and 

2731
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:46,880
it ended Felix Trinidad feel extreme.
That was never the same after that 

2732
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:46,880
fight.
That was.

2733
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:47,620
That was the fight where he hit the 
wall.

2734
01:59:47,770 --> 01:59:52,770
They say for fighters always have one 
fight that like even get hit one time by

2735
01:59:52,961 --> 01:59:54,400
one.
It's one punch.

2736
01:59:54,401 --> 01:59:59,401
Usually that changes that whole mix.
Well you can say like GSP was not the 

2737
02:00:00,521 --> 02:00:05,521
same fighter.
He became very conservative and careful 

2738
02:00:05,521 --> 02:00:08,401
after he got knocked out by Matt Serra,
well he definitely became more 

2739
02:00:08,401 --> 02:00:11,290
conservative but controls you rather 
than GSP,

2740
02:00:11,530 --> 02:00:12,820
which you've got to look out and people 
say,

2741
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:13,730
Oh,
you know,

2742
02:00:13,731 --> 02:00:18,430
this is gsp slowing down or is GSP.
This was GSP that and you know,

2743
02:00:18,431 --> 02:00:20,680
is this time over or new guy's going to 
beat them.

2744
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:23,050
There's always going to be a bunch of 
fucking killers out there.

2745
02:00:23,051 --> 02:00:24,220
There's always going to be a bunch of 
scary.

2746
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:29,490
Johny Hendricks,
Jake ellenberger type dudes looking to 

2747
02:00:29,490 --> 02:00:32,501
smash your fucking face and when you're 
the champ there's no getting around 

2748
02:00:32,501 --> 02:00:35,221
that.
What's most impressive is that the guy 

2749
02:00:35,221 --> 02:00:38,320
has been doing this for so fucking long 
and when shit starts happening,

2750
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:41,320
like he blew out his acl,
look getting injured,

2751
02:00:41,470 --> 02:00:43,990
that is a normal part of being an 
athlete.

2752
02:00:44,020 --> 02:00:45,760
It happens.
There's no getting around it.

2753
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:50,080
You're putting your body through 
incredible strains and you're especially

2754
02:00:50,081 --> 02:00:55,081
doing an improvisational sort of a thing
like wrestling or Jujitsu or kickboxing 

2755
02:00:55,081 --> 02:00:58,651
where you you don't know how he's gonna 
move or you're going to be expiring and 

2756
02:00:58,651 --> 02:00:59,360
Shit goes wrong and you can get hurt.
There's no doubt.

2757
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:04,380
There's no way of avoiding that,
but when shit starts breaking and you 

2758
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:09,241
start getting injured and you start 
thinking about the amount of hours this 

2759
02:01:09,241 --> 02:01:12,510
guys put in the gym,
the amount of hours guys put in the 

2760
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:12,510
cage,
he amount of fights,

2761
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:12,700
amount of wear and tear.

2762
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:17,850
It's just a matter of how long can you 
consistently keep up that sort of 

2763
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:20,730
fighting intensity and all wrestling 
based fighting style too,

2764
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:24,070
which is very taxing on your spinal 
cord,

2765
02:01:24,071 --> 02:01:29,071
very taxing on your knees.
You know there's a lot of power in 

2766
02:01:29,071 --> 02:01:32,700
involved in a wrestling base style.
Even if you're a technical guy like a 

2767
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:36,541
Ben Aspirin,
it's like it becomes a difficult style 

2768
02:01:36,541 --> 02:01:37,840
to to incorporate what's of about him 
though.

2769
02:01:37,841 --> 02:01:41,240
It's gsps his ability and also there's a
lot of tape on them.

2770
02:01:41,241 --> 02:01:42,830
You can watch a lot on him.
You can like.

2771
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:47,860
You can try to figure him out,
but he fights a different fight in some 

2772
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:48,060
ways.
Every time he fights as well.

2773
02:01:48,061 --> 02:01:48,640
It's,
it's,

2774
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:50,210
I think,
don't get me wrong.

2775
02:01:50,211 --> 02:01:55,211
I think like a wrestling based style is 
definitely the best way to approach it 

2776
02:01:56,420 --> 02:02:01,420
as far as longevity,
but even that it's like how much 

2777
02:02:01,420 --> 02:02:01,460
longevity can.

2778
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:06,560
MMA is a brutal Goddamn game.
How much longevity can you get a certain

2779
02:02:06,561 --> 02:02:11,561
point in time.
Someone's going to come along and if 

2780
02:02:11,561 --> 02:02:11,561
Anderson Silva keeps fighting,
someone's probably going to beat him.

2781
02:02:11,561 --> 02:02:16,420
You know,
and it might be sort of a Bernard 

2782
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:16,420
Hopkins situation where no one ever 
gets.

2783
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:20,250
I mean,
he's so clever and so technical that no 

2784
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:20,250
one ever gets to the point where they 
can really humiliate them,

2785
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:24,910
but there'll be a guy like a chat dawson
who come along and beat Bernard Hopkins 

2786
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:25,430
because he was younger and quicker.
You know,

2787
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:27,560
there's going to be these Andre Ward 
type.

2788
02:02:27,561 --> 02:02:31,580
Gosh,
it's going to be the dude that,

2789
02:02:31,581 --> 02:02:32,600
uh,
Jermaine,

2790
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:36,290
the guy that I'm Kelly pavlock beat.
I want to say Jermaine,

2791
02:02:36,291 --> 02:02:37,360
Andrea,
but that's not his name,

2792
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,650
his name.
So a lot of his fights.

2793
02:02:40,730 --> 02:02:45,730
He was the champ and he beat 'em.
I don't know if that's the right box or 

2794
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:49,860
African.
His fucking name.

2795
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:52,140
Shit.
I hate that.

2796
02:02:52,141 --> 02:02:53,670
I got too many fucking names.
My brain.

2797
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,170
But this dude,
this name Andre?

2798
02:03:00,810 --> 02:03:01,540
No,
no,

2799
02:03:01,541 --> 02:03:03,700
he's an MMA fighter.
Oh,

2800
02:03:03,701 --> 02:03:04,630
well.
Oh,

2801
02:03:04,631 --> 02:03:05,980
that's right.
I remember that dude.

2802
02:03:05,981 --> 02:03:06,880
Yeah,
sorry.

2803
02:03:06,940 --> 02:03:07,600
Sorry.
Jermaine.

2804
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:09,430
Yeah.
He's actually a very talented,

2805
02:03:09,431 --> 02:03:14,431
a kickboxing champion.
I'm Jermaine Stewart.

2806
02:03:14,730 --> 02:03:17,380
Jimmy Taylor.
Taylor Taylor.

2807
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:18,750
Yeah.
Jermaine.

2808
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:19,720
Andrea says,
sorry.

2809
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:23,620
Bad ass looking dude was crazy.
I saw the one tail.

2810
02:03:23,621 --> 02:03:26,320
It's got a shaved head and the crazy 
ponytail he fought in the UFC,

2811
02:03:26,321 --> 02:03:27,250
I think.
Pretty sure.

2812
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:29,050
Um,
but uh,

2813
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:34,110
he beat Kelly pavlock knocked him out,
but he beat Bernard Hopkins twice and he

2814
02:03:34,421 --> 02:03:36,370
beat him with speed plead.
He beat him twice.

2815
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:40,410
He's a,
he's a bigger guy and he's but pablet.

2816
02:03:40,420 --> 02:03:44,080
Meanwhile pavlock beat him,
but he was just able to out athlete.

2817
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:47,100
It's so funny looking at Kylie look like
he like this.

2818
02:03:47,310 --> 02:03:50,440
If you saw him on the beach and shorts,
he couldn't look more normal.

2819
02:03:50,441 --> 02:03:55,100
There's not a lot of muscle tone.
He's covered with some kind of.

2820
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:57,880
After he had his kind of thing.
He had a bit of a breakdown.

2821
02:03:57,881 --> 02:04:00,580
Then he went and got about sat too,
but a lot of alcohol.

2822
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:02,260
Apparently.
It's before that,

2823
02:04:02,261 --> 02:04:03,610
when he was younger,
he had no tattoos,

2824
02:04:03,611 --> 02:04:04,270
you know,
very few.

2825
02:04:04,271 --> 02:04:05,920
It was just annoying.
He just retired,

2826
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:06,820
you know,
I think,

2827
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:08,440
yeah,
I think part of it,

2828
02:04:08,441 --> 02:04:09,850
I mean,
the alcohol thing,

2829
02:04:10,510 --> 02:04:13,420
it's very possible that the depression,
alcohol,

2830
02:04:13,421 --> 02:04:16,520
that stuff has to do with head trauma to
that.

2831
02:04:16,530 --> 02:04:16,850
Right?
Yeah.

2832
02:04:17,590 --> 02:04:22,590
And he thinks it might be as well.
And so he's retiring even though he's 

2833
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:22,590
like,
he,

2834
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:24,950
he won recently and he looked really 
good too.

2835
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:28,990
He was in the midst of a comeback.
He's a talented fucking boxer.

2836
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:29,920
Yeah.
Yes.

2837
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:31,720
But getting,
getting hit in the head,

2838
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:34,260
walking around with headaches all day.
You could have done it,

2839
02:04:34,410 --> 02:04:35,320
man.
It was done.

2840
02:04:35,330 --> 02:04:36,040
It.
Keep it.

2841
02:04:36,710 --> 02:04:37,620
It's,
it's not fun.

2842
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:39,300
I mean,
I never did it to the extent that he did

2843
02:04:39,301 --> 02:04:41,130
it though when he,
he did was incredible.

2844
02:04:41,131 --> 02:04:42,690
And he's a world champion and the amount
of,

2845
02:04:42,750 --> 02:04:47,750
just the amount of punishment that you 
have to go through just in the rain 

2846
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:49,590
dude.
I mean it's his Jesus Christ.

2847
02:04:49,770 --> 02:04:50,400
Just.
I mean,

2848
02:04:50,430 --> 02:04:51,510
my main,
the training ring,

2849
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:53,580
you know,
just everyday in the gym,

2850
02:04:53,910 --> 02:04:55,110
these guys,
you know,

2851
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:57,380
they,
they get caught all the time warm.

2852
02:04:57,390 --> 02:05:01,170
And the last time we fought was 2012.
He Won.

2853
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:06,230
And apparently he was a,
they were setting up a new fight for 

2854
02:05:06,230 --> 02:05:06,450
them.
You can get your own fucking computer.

2855
02:05:06,451 --> 02:05:08,760
No Way.
You want to see a picture of him?

2856
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:09,900
Yeah.
What do you want to say?

2857
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:11,840
The Tattoo.
So I'll find them for it.

2858
02:05:11,841 --> 02:05:13,560
Yeah.
He had a bunch of crazy tattoos.

2859
02:05:13,561 --> 02:05:15,210
Man.
He,

2860
02:05:15,211 --> 02:05:20,211
uh,
he went nutty and just fucking tattoo 

2861
02:05:20,211 --> 02:05:20,211
the shit out of his chest.

2862
02:05:20,211 --> 02:05:23,420
Go off.
He put like haunted houses on him and 

2863
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:23,420
shit.
Rory Macdonald.

2864
02:05:23,420 --> 02:05:27,321
I want to pull that up.
Kelly Pavlik tattoos you could see like 

2865
02:05:27,321 --> 02:05:29,610
the tattoos that he has on his mind.
Sam Macdonald fight GSP,

2866
02:05:29,611 --> 02:05:31,300
but I think their training partners,
um,

2867
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:36,530
apparently they are preparing for that 
possibility and they're not training 

2868
02:05:36,530 --> 02:05:37,260
together anymore.
Yeah.

2869
02:05:37,261 --> 02:05:39,090
They,
they prepare on the other opposite sides

2870
02:05:39,091 --> 02:05:44,091
of the gym.
I'm going to tell him was no fucking 

2871
02:05:44,091 --> 02:05:44,091
joke.
Yeah.

2872
02:05:44,091 --> 02:05:45,510
Kelly Patrick has like a,
the colosseum on his chest.

2873
02:05:45,530 --> 02:05:49,440
He has some nutty shit if you go to the 
one,

2874
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:51,780
um,
there's other ones where,

2875
02:05:51,781 --> 02:05:53,460
you know,
a kind of a good skinny.

2876
02:05:53,461 --> 02:05:56,910
Our image of what it is.
There's another one down there.

2877
02:05:56,911 --> 02:06:00,150
If you look at it,
it's got a bit of a better image.

2878
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:04,010
There's a couple of them.
Yeah.

2879
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:07,250
That one was arms are flex to kind of 
get to see that what it is.

2880
02:06:07,850 --> 02:06:12,850
Yeah.
It's like a Roman colosseum on the left 

2881
02:06:12,850 --> 02:06:12,850
and there's some,
uh,

2882
02:06:14,050 --> 02:06:19,050
some other shit was just get,
just get real random whether tattoos.

2883
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:24,340
He's got an angel with a bow and Arrow 
is great.

2884
02:06:24,370 --> 02:06:25,760
Look at him.
He's awesome looking.

2885
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:29,230
Is that a fighter?
A bridge?

2886
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:31,330
He's a fucking animal man.
When he was at his best,

2887
02:06:31,331 --> 02:06:33,630
he was a really fun guy to watch nipple 
locking up.

2888
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:38,660
I'm glad.
I'm glad he's retiring before it gets 

2889
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:38,660
ugly.
Mean guide did a lot.

2890
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:41,770
He accomplished a lot and it gets ugly 
for everyone.

2891
02:06:41,890 --> 02:06:43,900
He looks haunted a little bit.
Doesn't mean it looks.

2892
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:49,400
Guys are my brothers.
A lot of guys are somebody called being 

2893
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:49,400
an addict.
Uh,

2894
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:53,720
uh,
like you always feel like you're being 

2895
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:55,551
chased by something you know,
described that he said,

2896
02:06:56,011 --> 02:06:58,490
you know,
I always feel like I'm being chased by,

2897
02:06:58,530 --> 02:06:59,900
by some,
by a demon.

2898
02:06:59,901 --> 02:07:02,430
It's almost catching me every time I'm 
always running,

2899
02:07:02,431 --> 02:07:04,710
I'm always running.
Have you heard about these,

2900
02:07:04,711 --> 02:07:06,930
uh,
district attorneys that are getting shot

2901
02:07:06,931 --> 02:07:10,520
in Texas?
Some of assassinating district call.

2902
02:07:10,660 --> 02:07:12,480
One guy was white supremacy.
He had a shootout.

2903
02:07:12,481 --> 02:07:17,481
They killed him.
That was the guy who killed the 

2904
02:07:17,481 --> 02:07:17,481
Colorado,
was prison bureau chief in India.

2905
02:07:17,481 --> 02:07:20,040
Did that,
caught that gun and we got to kill them.

2906
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:25,490
And then the,
the guy who shot the district attorney 

2907
02:07:25,490 --> 02:07:25,490
and his wife,
they don't know.

2908
02:07:25,490 --> 02:07:26,550
I guess they still don't know who did 
it.

2909
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:28,080
You know,
you don't even know if it's connected,

2910
02:07:28,081 --> 02:07:30,570
but I'm sure it is.
Well,

2911
02:07:30,571 --> 02:07:33,090
it might be just a cartel thing.
You don't know man.

2912
02:07:33,170 --> 02:07:34,320
Fucking,
I don't know.

2913
02:07:35,190 --> 02:07:37,060
Wedding since 1964,

2914
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:38,440
I think.
How many?

2915
02:07:38,441 --> 02:07:41,290
Thirteen or 33 prosecutors have been 
shot.

2916
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:48,740
Wow.
There was a story that came out about a 

2917
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:53,630
cop that may or may not have planted 
drugs on a,

2918
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:59,250
on a woman because she was claiming that
a judge had moved in and our.

2919
02:08:01,670 --> 02:08:06,670
Oh,
let me pull it up on woman who 

2920
02:08:07,501 --> 02:08:09,960
complained about judges sexual 
solicitation.

2921
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:12,500
Jesus.
Yeah,

2922
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:13,560
I would,
I don't,

2923
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:18,620
I'm not shocked at that.
I mean they found a judge who is 

2924
02:08:18,620 --> 02:08:18,620
profiting off of sending kids to 
juvenile homes.

2925
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:20,050
Really?
Yeah.

2926
02:08:20,070 --> 02:08:22,920
They found a judge that was profiting 
off of that.

2927
02:08:22,921 --> 02:08:24,870
He's in jail now.
It's in Pennsylvania.

2928
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:26,310
So she's pretty sharp.
Pencil.

2929
02:08:26,311 --> 02:08:31,311
Yeah.
Sick motherfucker shit know he thought 

2930
02:08:31,311 --> 02:08:31,311
because these kids had done things in 
the past.

2931
02:08:31,311 --> 02:08:32,970
Fuck it.
I'll just send them down the river,

2932
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:34,080
you know,
they need it.

2933
02:08:34,150 --> 02:08:39,150
And he was getting kickbacks.
Who's getting kickbacks that more 

2934
02:08:39,150 --> 02:08:41,991
people,
he would convict ascend to these 

2935
02:08:41,991 --> 02:08:41,991
juvenile homes.
Some more money.

2936
02:08:41,991 --> 02:08:45,711
They could spend more money they can get
from the government and the more profit 

2937
02:08:45,711 --> 02:08:45,780
they can make.
Creepy Fox.

2938
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,430
Creepy.
Yeah.

2939
02:08:47,431 --> 02:08:51,660
This is a Murray County.
I don't know where the fuck that is.

2940
02:08:51,810 --> 02:08:55,230
Murray County sheriff's office.
Where the hell's Mary?

2941
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:59,430
You live in a serious hillbilly place if
no one's.

2942
02:08:59,431 --> 02:08:59,490
Yeah.

2943
02:08:59,690 --> 02:09:04,690
Oh,
you know what I was going to talk about 

2944
02:09:04,690 --> 02:09:04,690
my,
my uh,

2945
02:09:04,690 --> 02:09:07,340
Vincent Labarbera,
the guy that I podcast right now on the 

2946
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:09,060
Bryan County show and this guy,
this guy is a,

2947
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:14,120
is a uh,
first of all he wears a patch or was 

2948
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:14,120
that because he went snow blind three 
times from climbing,

2949
02:09:14,120 --> 02:09:16,470
like fucking huge mountains like in 
Africa and stuff.

2950
02:09:16,471 --> 02:09:17,460
And,
and.

2951
02:09:17,461 --> 02:09:18,290
Yeah.
And he was uh,

2952
02:09:18,430 --> 02:09:21,330
he would,
he would go and like basically go to war

2953
02:09:21,331 --> 02:09:22,370
zones.
Just see what it's like.

2954
02:09:22,371 --> 02:09:24,210
Is it really the counties in Minnesota,
by the way?

2955
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:28,380
I'm a whatever.
This guy went snow blind.

2956
02:09:28,381 --> 02:09:28,890
Yeah,
yeah.

2957
02:09:28,891 --> 02:09:30,910
From climbing mountains and shit.
He's be able to.

2958
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:32,130
Daredevil,
did all kinds of shit.

2959
02:09:32,131 --> 02:09:37,131
But now he's always been a high profile,
a trial lawyer for like big time drug 

2960
02:09:38,791 --> 02:09:41,160
cartels.
He's a huge proponent on the podcast.

2961
02:09:41,161 --> 02:09:43,130
Talks about why drugs should be legal 
and stuff too.

2962
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:44,340
Amazing.
So He's,

2963
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:46,650
he's tried to get the cartels out of 
jail.

2964
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:51,680
He does.
He just thinks all drugs should be 

2965
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:51,680
legal,
all of them.

2966
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:52,110
And he does everything he can to stick 
to the government whenever.

2967
02:09:52,350 --> 02:09:56,550
So he handles huge or big cases like 
big,

2968
02:09:56,551 --> 02:09:57,970
big time cases.
Uh,

2969
02:09:58,330 --> 02:09:59,950
the marine in Fallujah.
A lot,

2970
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:01,200
a lot of different people,
you know.

2971
02:10:01,201 --> 02:10:03,870
And um,
he's got a really interesting take on,

2972
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:04,710
on,
you know,

2973
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:05,640
justice,
like the,

2974
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:08,670
I had this Delta Force Guy I was talking
about killing an American citizen and he

2975
02:10:08,671 --> 02:10:11,160
was kind of justifying it and vince in 
la by Vera got on.

2976
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:12,240
It was like,
let me tell you something.

2977
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:13,760
That's the biggest bunch of,
you know,

2978
02:10:13,761 --> 02:10:18,761
he,
he couldn't have been more on the other 

2979
02:10:18,761 --> 02:10:18,761
side of it,
the,

2980
02:10:18,761 --> 02:10:19,130
that the US and the national defense act
and stuff.

2981
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:20,880
We talk a lot about.
He talked,

2982
02:10:20,910 --> 02:10:24,330
he just goes to town on the fact that 
that is killing our country,

2983
02:10:24,331 --> 02:10:27,420
our due process and everything and he's 
very articulate about it.

2984
02:10:27,421 --> 02:10:32,421
I'm not,
it's going down the path of corruption 

2985
02:10:32,421 --> 02:10:34,050
and we all see it and because now we're 
all on the Internet,

2986
02:10:34,050 --> 02:10:39,050
we all get to talk about it and we get 
to express our concerns and get to know 

2987
02:10:39,050 --> 02:10:39,720
when the government says trust me.
No,

2988
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:45,220
well keeps happening.
That's like this new thing is this 

2989
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:48,650
Monsanto bill that just passed silently 
through congress without any mainstream 

2990
02:10:49,771 --> 02:10:51,390
exposure where they're,
you know,

2991
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:56,720
giving Monsanto a,
all sorts of subsidies and all sorts of 

2992
02:10:57,630 --> 02:10:58,740
abilities to,
to,

2993
02:10:58,741 --> 02:11:03,741
uh,
to hide the fact that genetically 

2994
02:11:03,741 --> 02:11:03,741
modified foods are and things that you 
buy.

2995
02:11:04,170 --> 02:11:06,990
It's creepy.
It's creepy because it's,

2996
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:12,560
it's one of those things where it's all,
you would hope that they would one day 

2997
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:12,870
be.

2998
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:17,770
What was that

2999
02:11:19,330 --> 02:11:22,840
was the whistle to your phone,
dude.

3000
02:11:22,930 --> 02:11:24,250
Fuck,
that's the gay shit.

3001
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:27,780
I actually kinda like changed my ringer.
A couple of.

3002
02:11:28,660 --> 02:11:31,120
What the fuck was I even talking about?
We're talking about Monsanto.

3003
02:11:31,210 --> 02:11:35,860
I would hope that things would slowly 
start to move into a better direction.

3004
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:39,130
We're going to cut back on corruption.
We're gonna attack it.

3005
02:11:39,310 --> 02:11:42,130
We're going to make for a more fair 
society.

3006
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:47,310
We're going to only involve ourselves in
military campaigns that are Justin and 

3007
02:11:47,501 --> 02:11:49,660
true and we're going to try to,
you know,

3008
02:11:49,750 --> 02:11:52,930
you got to change the rest of the world 
to change the incentive structure if you

3009
02:11:52,931 --> 02:11:54,010
want to do that.
Of course,

3010
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:55,780
you know,
it's just weird,

3011
02:11:55,810 --> 02:11:56,500
man.
It's,

3012
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:59,890
it's the biggest.
The biggest danger is that when you have

3013
02:11:59,891 --> 02:12:04,891
good people behaving corruptly,
when you have a system that allows for 

3014
02:12:04,891 --> 02:12:08,161
no other way to do business,
so that so that your system becomes an 

3015
02:12:08,161 --> 02:12:08,161
economy of influence,
that meritocracy.

3016
02:12:08,161 --> 02:12:10,270
So who you know is really how you get 
business,

3017
02:12:10,271 --> 02:12:11,890
not what you can do and that's where 
you,

3018
02:12:11,950 --> 02:12:16,950
that's,
that's where we're headed in some 

3019
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:16,950
aspects and you have to be very careful 
of that.

3020
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:18,160
Yeah.
At least Lawrence lessig books as that.

3021
02:12:18,161 --> 02:12:19,610
In a republic last,
what I taught,

3022
02:12:19,630 --> 02:12:21,910
which I've talked about many times on 
this podcast,

3023
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,830
is that's a very important book to read 
and,

3024
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:26,110
and,
and what he does,

3025
02:12:26,111 --> 02:12:26,830
he says,
look,

3026
02:12:26,831 --> 02:12:30,100
let me show you how Washington is 
corrupt with a lot of good people try to

3027
02:12:30,101 --> 02:12:33,100
do the right thing,
but they can't do business without being

3028
02:12:33,130 --> 02:12:33,460
[inaudible].
Let me,

3029
02:12:33,550 --> 02:12:38,550
let me explain to people don't know what
the fuck we're talking about what this 

3030
02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:38,710
is,
because this is a pretty crazy shit.

3031
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:42,170
It's a genetically modified food.
Uh,

3032
02:12:42,370 --> 02:12:46,210
and the thing they're calling the 
Monsanto Protection Act,

3033
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:51,300
which was signed by President Obama.
They're calling it the Monsanto 

3034
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:51,300
Protection Act.

3035
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:51,300
What it actually was,
it's,

3036
02:12:51,310 --> 02:12:56,290
it was added to an essential spending 
bill without congressional hearings.

3037
02:12:56,440 --> 02:13:01,420
So they slept this rider and the rider 
strips the power from the federal courts

3038
02:13:01,421 --> 02:13:06,421
to halt the sales and planting of 
genetically modified foods even if 

3039
02:13:06,421 --> 02:13:08,410
health concerns arise.
Wow.

3040
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:11,260
Wow.
This is crazy.

3041
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:17,010
The provision was simply an industry 
ploy to continue to sell genetically 

3042
02:13:17,010 --> 02:13:21,121
engineered seeds even without a court,
even when a court of law has found that 

3043
02:13:21,121 --> 02:13:23,520
they were approved by the u.
s d,

3044
02:13:23,521 --> 02:13:28,521
a illegally,
the petition stated it's necessary to 

3045
02:13:28,521 --> 02:13:31,270
fund an unprecedented tacked on us 
judicial review.

3046
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:36,290
Congress should not be meddling with the
judicial review process based solely on 

3047
02:13:36,301 --> 02:13:38,250
the special interest.
Have a handful of companies.

3048
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,690
This is from a,
someone's uh,

3049
02:13:40,750 --> 02:13:44,650
I guess it was I,
I don't know who wrote that.

3050
02:13:44,830 --> 02:13:45,340
Someone.

3051
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Okay.
So essentially they're saying is they 

3052
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,981
snuck this in and people are just 
finding out about it now and that 

3053
02:13:53,981 --> 02:13:56,480
happens all the time in Washington.
They're trying to protect the profits of

3054
02:13:56,481 --> 02:13:57,390
this company.
That's,

3055
02:13:57,450 --> 02:14:02,450
that's the only way.
The only reason why you would hide 

3056
02:14:02,450 --> 02:14:02,450
information as you're trying to protect 
the product,

3057
02:14:02,450 --> 02:14:06,970
because if the,
if the genetically modified foods are 

3058
02:14:06,970 --> 02:14:08,090
safe and they're in there and we find 
out they're safe,

3059
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:13,300
then we don't have to worry.
But if they might not be safe and you 

3060
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:14,270
want to sue,
if you want you,

3061
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:16,130
you,
you're not going to know.

3062
02:14:16,190 --> 02:14:18,860
You're not going to be able to blame it 
on the genetically modified foods.

3063
02:14:18,861 --> 02:14:20,630
You're not even going to know if it's 
genetically modified.

3064
02:14:20,631 --> 02:14:25,631
If you have health issues that arise 
because of the genetically modified 

3065
02:14:25,631 --> 02:14:25,631
foods,
you won't even know the correlation.

3066
02:14:25,631 --> 02:14:26,710
You won't know what if you.

3067
02:14:26,710 --> 02:14:29,780
You know what?
If you have a known issue that's come up

3068
02:14:30,130 --> 02:14:35,130
on amongst a small percentage of people 
that do respond poorly to jump 

3069
02:14:35,130 --> 02:14:36,830
genetically modified foods,
well you won't even fucking know because

3070
02:14:36,831 --> 02:14:41,831
it's not going to be in the label 
because some cons got paid and it's 

3071
02:14:41,831 --> 02:14:45,850
crazy because the people who are selling
genetically modified foods should only 

3072
02:14:45,850 --> 02:14:48,700
want to be selling healthy genetically 
modified foods.

3073
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:53,720
It is possible that science can figure 
out a way to produce more food that's 

3074
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:55,340
more nutritious.
It is possible,

3075
02:14:55,550 --> 02:14:58,940
but it's also possible that they could 
fuck it up and when.

3076
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,100
When this,
when something like this comes along and

3077
02:15:01,101 --> 02:15:02,540
there,
this is all this is,

3078
02:15:02,570 --> 02:15:07,570
they should call this the Monsanto 
Information Act because all it is is 

3079
02:15:07,570 --> 02:15:09,170
keeping information secret,
keeping it from people.

3080
02:15:09,290 --> 02:15:10,940
That's never.
That's not only that,

3081
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:16,180
it's also keep.
It's also changing information in lying 

3082
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:16,970
about what's good for you and what's not
because they're setting up corruption.

3083
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:17,900
They're setting up.
Yeah,

3084
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:22,950
so corruption can take place.
I don't know enough about genetically 

3085
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:22,950
modified foods,
but I'll give you an example,

3086
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:23,150
but you don't have to.
Well No,

3087
02:15:23,151 --> 02:15:25,520
I'm saying that the,
the food and nutrition board,

3088
02:15:25,521 --> 02:15:30,521
which sets the school standard for 30 
million children on what they can eat 

3089
02:15:30,521 --> 02:15:32,630
because they've been hijacked by 
companies like Nestle,

3090
02:15:32,631 --> 02:15:37,631
et Cetera,
or the big companies that have an 

3091
02:15:37,631 --> 02:15:39,461
interest in selling their products.
Coca Cola and stuff and and they hire 

3092
02:15:39,461 --> 02:15:39,480
scientists,
read,

3093
02:15:39,481 --> 02:15:41,660
read the China study talks about this,
you know,

3094
02:15:41,960 --> 02:15:43,310
I'm paraphrasing here,
but they'll,

3095
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:48,340
they'll hide.
They'll stack the deck with scientists 

3096
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:50,501
that they basically hard to say that 25 
percent of your diet can be simple 

3097
02:15:50,631 --> 02:15:52,280
sugars,
which means I can.

3098
02:15:52,310 --> 02:15:56,630
I can have vending machines in there 
that sell soda and twix bars and seven.

3099
02:15:56,631 --> 02:16:01,631
That's part of your lunch.
That's where when you're ignorant and 

3100
02:16:01,631 --> 02:16:02,900
you don't know how,
how the system works,

3101
02:16:02,901 --> 02:16:06,890
how the incentive structure works,
you are going to pay a price for it with

3102
02:16:06,891 --> 02:16:11,891
your health and so are your kids.
So that's why I always tell people it's 

3103
02:16:11,891 --> 02:16:15,410
you can't not be politically committed.
It's not a luxury you can afford,

3104
02:16:15,411 --> 02:16:20,411
man,
because what happens is it becomes a 

3105
02:16:20,411 --> 02:16:20,420
concentration of vested interests.
Look at,

3106
02:16:20,450 --> 02:16:21,920
look at Wall Street.
Yes,

3107
02:16:21,921 --> 02:16:26,921
they compete with each other until 
someone comes in with legislation and 

3108
02:16:26,921 --> 02:16:30,070
they get very good at hiring lobbyists.
They get very good

3109
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:35,050
at their economy of influence and 
figuring out how to buy the right people

3110
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:40,080
to keep business as usual.
That's why you have to teach kids to 

3111
02:16:41,411 --> 02:16:44,290
entering the system.
Now to stop that pattern,

3112
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:49,580
you know,
they have to figure out a way to profit 

3113
02:16:49,580 --> 02:16:52,591
overall.
You know the whole thing's a problem 

3114
02:16:52,591 --> 02:16:53,710
with profit as long as it's earned 
honestly,

3115
02:16:53,711 --> 02:16:58,711
and you're playing by the rules.
The problem is when you have companies 

3116
02:16:58,711 --> 02:17:00,190
that stack the deck,
you know of course,

3117
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:01,990
and so,
so how does that happen?

3118
02:17:01,991 --> 02:17:04,630
You've got to figure out how that 
happens and why it happened,

3119
02:17:04,631 --> 02:17:07,470
and then that's the way you change it,
to figure out first how it happens.

3120
02:17:07,471 --> 02:17:12,010
Just so transparent when something like 
this Monsanto thing comes up because all

3121
02:17:12,011 --> 02:17:15,840
they're doing is keeping information.
That's all they're doing.

3122
02:17:15,870 --> 02:17:20,870
Exactly.
They should never be able to keep 

3123
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:20,870
information because if you have a good 
product,

3124
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:23,140
like let's say you're selling oranges,
when you can prove,

3125
02:17:23,141 --> 02:17:26,290
if you look at the data that oranges are
very rich in vitamin C,

3126
02:17:26,320 --> 02:17:28,330
they have healthy fiber to them.

3127
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:32,500
When you eat an orange with your lunch,
it's probably a really healthy choice.

3128
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:37,620
It's good for you and we have a lot of 
data to back that up so all the 

3129
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:39,370
information on oranges is readily 
available.

3130
02:17:39,590 --> 02:17:41,140
You can go look it up.
You know why?

3131
02:17:41,230 --> 02:17:42,990
Because there's nothing bad.
There's nothing to hide.

3132
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:44,440
It's a fucking orange.
Okay?

3133
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:47,340
But when you start monkeying around with
oranges and mold,

3134
02:17:47,350 --> 02:17:52,350
this is an orange that doesn't react 
badly to certain pesticides and this is 

3135
02:17:52,350 --> 02:17:55,780
an orange that creates its own pesticide
and kills off mosquitoes.

3136
02:17:55,781 --> 02:17:58,150
Or this is an orange that you don't tell
me.

3137
02:17:59,650 --> 02:18:02,260
Now we got a real problem because that's
not really an orange.

3138
02:18:02,410 --> 02:18:07,410
That's an orange that you fucked with 
and I don't know if you really know 

3139
02:18:07,410 --> 02:18:10,750
what's going to happen with that orange.
If I eat one of these a day for the next

3140
02:18:10,751 --> 02:18:13,000
20 years,
is that going to write my asshole out?

3141
02:18:13,180 --> 02:18:14,070
You know what is,
what is it?

3142
02:18:14,071 --> 02:18:14,770
Gonna?
Is it gonna?

3143
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:17,320
Erase my memory.
At least give me the information.

3144
02:18:17,740 --> 02:18:20,600
I want to know if he's got the gene of a
jelly fish because it was so,

3145
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:25,620
so it doesn't freeze.
I want to know that executive told me 

3146
02:18:25,620 --> 02:18:25,620
everything.
Show me everything.

3147
02:18:25,620 --> 02:18:28,180
You've got to make my own choices.
You can't hide information.

3148
02:18:28,181 --> 02:18:30,130
And the idea that they would do that 
with our food,

3149
02:18:30,131 --> 02:18:35,131
which is something that's.
We have a health crisis in this country 

3150
02:18:35,131 --> 02:18:37,090
for sure.
Even though we have access to all of the

3151
02:18:37,091 --> 02:18:41,560
information on the back of food,
all of the nutritional information isn't

3152
02:18:41,561 --> 02:18:44,830
readily available and almost anything 
that we buy in the store except for like

3153
02:18:44,831 --> 02:18:47,860
meats and things like that.
But when we do that,

3154
02:18:48,430 --> 02:18:53,430
we still don't use it.
We still use that information and so 

3155
02:18:53,430 --> 02:18:56,311
many people are eating terrible food 
everyday and so many people are or 

3156
02:18:56,311 --> 02:18:57,700
unhealthy and sick all the time and 
they're essentially poisoned themselves.

3157
02:18:57,700 --> 02:19:00,000
So that's with inflammation.
That's right.

3158
02:19:00,050 --> 02:19:05,050
That's when the fucking information with
readily apparent bad things to eat and 

3159
02:19:06,881 --> 02:19:08,770
people choose them.
You,

3160
02:19:08,771 --> 02:19:09,290
you,
you know,

3161
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:14,340
you can't stop inflammation.
You can't because what you're doing is 

3162
02:19:14,340 --> 02:19:17,680
you're setting yourself up so that you 
can lie and protect people in power.

3163
02:19:17,681 --> 02:19:19,450
That's the only reason you shouldn't be 
doing it.

3164
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:25,200
We already have a problem.
We already have a problem with people 

3165
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:28,021
having shitty diets.
We already have a problem with this 

3166
02:19:28,021 --> 02:19:28,730
weird thing with humans were stuff that 
tastes amazing.

3167
02:19:28,731 --> 02:19:33,731
It's fucking killing you.
Like krispy Kreme donuts are fucking 

3168
02:19:33,731 --> 02:19:35,390
delicious,
but that's a toxin.

3169
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:37,600
Yeah.
Those are like pure sugar.

3170
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,730
You go to a lot of parts of the country.
It's like you and I do travel a lot.

3171
02:19:41,070 --> 02:19:44,450
There's not a lot of access to real good
food and there's access to,

3172
02:19:44,480 --> 02:19:49,480
to,
to different restaurant chains or 

3173
02:19:49,480 --> 02:19:49,480
there's access to,
you know,

3174
02:19:49,480 --> 02:19:51,170
just a bunch of fast food and some areas
we can get healthier.

3175
02:19:51,830 --> 02:19:53,190
Supermarkets.
You can,

3176
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:55,670
you can always,
but even then we'd get a tomato and it's

3177
02:19:55,671 --> 02:19:57,830
Pale.
This is white fucking tomato,

3178
02:19:57,831 --> 02:19:59,840
like what's in that type and hitting the
gas chamber.

3179
02:19:59,841 --> 02:20:01,370
That's how.
That's why not only that,

3180
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:04,100
the genetics of the thing have 
completely been altered so they can keep

3181
02:20:04,101 --> 02:20:05,810
them on a truck for a week,
you know?

3182
02:20:05,811 --> 02:20:08,030
It's a sort of the same thing that 
they've done with,

3183
02:20:08,050 --> 02:20:11,500
with raw milk and I,
I know and people that are screaming at,

3184
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:15,770
you know what we perceived the oldies,
Lloyd's and people from boom.

3185
02:20:15,771 --> 02:20:16,550
Raw Milk.
Yeah,

3186
02:20:16,551 --> 02:20:16,810
yeah,
yeah,

3187
02:20:16,811 --> 02:20:17,270
yeah,
yeah.

3188
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:18,860
They're going to die anyway.
Look,

3189
02:20:18,980 --> 02:20:20,360
everyone's going to die.
You're gonna die too.

3190
02:20:20,450 --> 02:20:22,010
That's not the point.
I get what you're saying.

3191
02:20:22,011 --> 02:20:23,630
I know it logically.
You're correct,

3192
02:20:23,631 --> 02:20:28,631
ethically correct.
And I understand you're talking about 

3193
02:20:28,631 --> 02:20:28,631
transparency.
You're talking about,

3194
02:20:28,631 --> 02:20:30,170
I'm talking,
I'm talking not just about transparency.

3195
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:35,320
I'm talking that I'm saying that too 
many people are telling too many people 

3196
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:37,910
what is and isn't okay to do.
That's a real problem.

3197
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:43,120
And I always say that the law,
the way we should have law in this 

3198
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:46,421
country is,
could you imagine clint eastwood 

3199
02:20:46,421 --> 02:20:49,100
arresting you for it?
If he had a gun and he pointed at you,

3200
02:20:49,130 --> 02:20:54,130
could you imagine the clinics?
We would arrest you for the credit 

3201
02:20:54,130 --> 02:20:54,130
clinic square prints,
or you're growing hemp.

3202
02:20:54,130 --> 02:20:56,300
If you,
if you could you imagine dirty Harry,

3203
02:20:56,301 --> 02:20:58,800
where he breaks down hemp farms.
Tell and Oh,

3204
02:20:58,810 --> 02:21:03,810
we're you going to do it?
You're going to make food and clothes 

3205
02:21:03,810 --> 02:21:05,560
the fuck you are getting a squad car.
If anything other than that is a 

3206
02:21:06,741 --> 02:21:08,270
bullshit law.
Okay.

3207
02:21:08,271 --> 02:21:13,271
I could imagine dirty Harry arresting 
these cons that are getting paid off by 

3208
02:21:13,271 --> 02:21:14,600
Monsanto.
I can imagine.

3209
02:21:14,601 --> 02:21:17,830
Dirty Harry catching some scotch 
drinking asshole,

3210
02:21:17,940 --> 02:21:19,880
you know,
in his Senate Room,

3211
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,690
you know,
uh,

3212
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:23,240
beating some hooker to death and he,
you know,

3213
02:21:23,241 --> 02:21:27,270
he walks in and you fuck,
I got Monsanto through and yeah,

3214
02:21:27,271 --> 02:21:28,130
right dead man.

3215
02:21:28,210 --> 02:21:33,210
You're a bad debt.
And he shoots him dead man Callahan and 

3216
02:21:33,210 --> 02:21:37,421
you're happy.
You're happy that he shot the evil 

3217
02:21:37,421 --> 02:21:37,421
Monsanto guy.
Yeah.

3218
02:21:37,421 --> 02:21:37,421
That's,
that seems like plenty.

3219
02:21:37,421 --> 02:21:38,390
Should might want to step in on this 
one.

3220
02:21:38,810 --> 02:21:41,000
But could you see clinics with a rescue 
for having a,

3221
02:21:41,001 --> 02:21:42,880
a roach in your car?
No.

3222
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:43,820
No,
of course not.

3223
02:21:43,821 --> 02:21:46,640
He would maybe slap you and tell you.
Don't be stupid.

3224
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:51,820
Don't be stupid kid.
Michael Pollan says you can vote three 

3225
02:21:51,820 --> 02:21:52,070
times a day by what you put on your 
plate.

3226
02:21:52,130 --> 02:21:52,520
Fuck,
yeah,

3227
02:21:52,521 --> 02:21:53,480
you go.
That's a good point.

3228
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:55,310
Well,
that's why I've been telling people,

3229
02:21:55,340 --> 02:22:00,340
you know,
one day the stoners are going to unite 

3230
02:22:00,340 --> 02:22:03,370
because there's a lot of a lot of 
bullshit out there and you need to 

3231
02:22:03,370 --> 02:22:05,831
respect the donor dollar.
I think the way of the future though is 

3232
02:22:05,831 --> 02:22:06,350
probably genetically modified foods.
Ultimately.

3233
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:11,360
Either way the future is.
I don't think we can see that many 

3234
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:11,360
people without.
Without funding,

3235
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:11,760
we can find people with.
That's what I.

3236
02:22:11,770 --> 02:22:16,770
I don't know if that's true.
I don't believe it and I think as time 

3237
02:22:16,770 --> 02:22:18,890
goes on,
the origin of those thoughts is profit.

3238
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:24,190
I do not believe that the origin of 
those thoughts is because we're really 

3239
02:22:24,190 --> 02:22:26,160
concerned with feeding people because 
that's not something that's not

3240
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:29,190
something that you hear from the federal
government.

3241
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:31,740
That's not something that was taken into
considerations.

3242
02:22:31,741 --> 02:22:36,741
When you,
when you look at how much money they 

3243
02:22:36,741 --> 02:22:37,140
spend on defense contractors,
fucking billions and billions of dollars

3244
02:22:37,141 --> 02:22:39,410
on a daily basis,
on a yearly basis rather,

3245
02:22:39,550 --> 02:22:40,980
and defense contractors,
how much,

3246
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:43,410
how much they spend feeding people.
Fucking zero.

3247
02:22:43,590 --> 02:22:45,930
Okay.
If they had the same resources that they

3248
02:22:45,931 --> 02:22:49,590
put into the military and they put that 
into feeding people,

3249
02:22:49,591 --> 02:22:54,591
there would be incredibly successful in 
feeding people so when they come along 

3250
02:22:54,591 --> 02:22:58,341
and say,
we need genetically modified foods 

3251
02:22:58,341 --> 02:22:58,341
because we need to feed people.
They're not trying to feed people.

3252
02:22:58,341 --> 02:23:01,050
They're not talking about feed people.
They want profit should all food,

3253
02:23:01,051 --> 02:23:02,880
all food has been genetically modified,
all of it.

3254
02:23:02,881 --> 02:23:07,881
Everything we do,
there's a difference between selective 

3255
02:23:07,881 --> 02:23:08,700
breeding and growing and genetically 
modifying.

3256
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:14,040
They are changing things at the genetic 
level to give them resistance to 

3257
02:23:14,221 --> 02:23:15,120
pesticides.

3258
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:18,000
But if you're doing a lot of shit out 
there like golden rice,

3259
02:23:18,001 --> 02:23:20,950
which is very hot and fast,
well there's not.

3260
02:23:21,470 --> 02:23:24,630
It's not a yes or a no,
it's not yes or no.

3261
02:23:24,631 --> 02:23:26,010
That's what I'm saying that you're 
right.

3262
02:23:26,011 --> 02:23:29,400
I think that the rise of technology,
even in food is inevitable.

3263
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:32,640
There's a good side to it and they're.
There can also be an evil side to it.

3264
02:23:32,641 --> 02:23:33,640
And I think that,
um,

3265
02:23:34,070 --> 02:23:39,070
I think the question is transparency and
knowing and seeing all the data and 

3266
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:44,300
holding companies accountable and,
and realizing that technology is not a 

3267
02:23:44,300 --> 02:23:44,970
bad thing.
It is a good thing.

3268
02:23:45,090 --> 02:23:50,090
We probably,
if we have 80 million people on this 

3269
02:23:50,090 --> 02:23:51,921
planet in 50 years,
we're probably going to have to resort 

3270
02:23:51,921 --> 02:23:54,321
to genetically modified foods.
We already are in some parts of the 

3271
02:23:54,321 --> 02:23:57,411
world.
The question becomes how do you do it 

3272
02:23:57,411 --> 02:23:59,511
responsibly and ethically,
the real issue is Paul risers character 

3273
02:23:59,511 --> 02:24:03,411
from aliens is that country sneaky slimy
guy who wanted to bring the alien back 

3274
02:24:04,290 --> 02:24:06,300
and use it as a biological weapon.

3275
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:11,300
Yeah.
That was what was wrong with that 

3276
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:14,211
fucking mood.
That's what you call full circle as 

3277
02:24:14,211 --> 02:24:14,490
jealous.
And that's what's wrong with lobbyists.

3278
02:24:14,491 --> 02:24:19,491
That's what's,
what's wrong with influencing the 

3279
02:24:19,491 --> 02:24:21,570
congress to let something like this 
sneak through where franken foods can be

3280
02:24:21,571 --> 02:24:26,571
in your,
your diet and you're not even aware of 

3281
02:24:26,571 --> 02:24:26,571
it or the right.
I mean,

3282
02:24:26,571 --> 02:24:26,571
that's,
that's,

3283
02:24:26,571 --> 02:24:28,290
that's exactly right.
They were and even comes,

3284
02:24:28,300 --> 02:24:29,100
oh,
you know,

3285
02:24:29,101 --> 02:24:30,720
not what you're doing.
That matters.

3286
02:24:30,721 --> 02:24:32,340
Yeah.
And even people who might say,

3287
02:24:32,341 --> 02:24:37,341
well,
you're ignorant as to the effect of 

3288
02:24:37,341 --> 02:24:37,530
genetically modified foods you're in.
You are absolutely right.

3289
02:24:37,531 --> 02:24:40,050
I have not read that much about 
genetically modified foods.

3290
02:24:40,051 --> 02:24:44,400
I have read both pro and con.
I have heard like Carrie Santa Maria had

3291
02:24:44,430 --> 02:24:49,430
some very good points about genetically 
modified foods and you have some very 

3292
02:24:49,430 --> 02:24:49,430
good points and I've,
I've,

3293
02:24:49,430 --> 02:24:51,660
I've seen like at Penn Jillette had some
very good points.

3294
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:54,510
He and I had a discussion about 
genetically modified foods and I respect

3295
02:24:54,511 --> 02:24:57,840
his opinion as well.
It is not that this isn't the argument.

3296
02:24:57,870 --> 02:25:02,130
The argument is about transparency and 
it's about the access to information and

3297
02:25:02,131 --> 02:25:07,131
about.
And it's about someone who is supposed 

3298
02:25:07,131 --> 02:25:07,131
to be looking out for the interests of 
the people,

3299
02:25:07,131 --> 02:25:10,470
allowing people to withhold information.
You should never do that.

3300
02:25:10,530 --> 02:25:15,530
You should just never do that.
You should never allow someone who's 

3301
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:17,610
selling something to withhold some weird
shit that they're doing to it that might

3302
02:25:17,611 --> 02:25:22,611
affect your health.
I want to know if I'm eating it has a 

3303
02:25:22,611 --> 02:25:22,611
jelly bean,
a jellyfish,

3304
02:25:22,611 --> 02:25:23,740
a gene in it,
or it's after.

3305
02:25:23,741 --> 02:25:23,980
I want

3306
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,750
to know that.
Tell me everything you know,

3307
02:25:25,810 --> 02:25:30,810
and this is sort of semi hypocritical 
coming from me because I'm in the 

3308
02:25:30,810 --> 02:25:31,240
supplement company,
you know what I mean?

3309
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:36,300
I'm involved with with a supplement 
company and then you take the 

3310
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:36,300
supplements you're taking.
There's also,

3311
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:40,651
there's,
there's enough tangible data on the 

3312
02:25:40,651 --> 02:25:42,700
subject that I'm confident in the 
results and that I also have benefited.

3313
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:48,060
I know that I've benefited from taking 
supplements I've know that have 

3314
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:50,941
benefited.
I know that my health is pretty fucking 

3315
02:25:50,941 --> 02:25:52,030
good and I know also a lot of it has to 
do with diet.

3316
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:54,640
A lot of it has to do with exercise and 
a lot of it has to do with genetics,

3317
02:25:54,641 --> 02:25:57,070
no doubt about it,
but I am very confident.

3318
02:25:57,071 --> 02:26:02,071
I've gone through periods of have even 
made experiments where have backed off 

3319
02:26:02,071 --> 02:26:03,490
supplements and I get blood work done on
a regular basis.

3320
02:26:03,490 --> 02:26:06,880
I'm pretty aware of what the fuck's 
going on and when my nutrients,

3321
02:26:06,881 --> 02:26:09,010
we're all at a very high level.
I function better.

3322
02:26:09,220 --> 02:26:10,120
I just do.
I know I do.

3323
02:26:10,121 --> 02:26:12,130
I have more energy and feel better.
You know,

3324
02:26:12,131 --> 02:26:15,370
when it's all done in conjunction,
but just not enough.

3325
02:26:15,450 --> 02:26:17,740
You know,
like if you,

3326
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:22,860
if you look at the negative aspects of 
that could possibly come from 

3327
02:26:25,061 --> 02:26:30,061
supplementation.
There's not really enough information 

3328
02:26:30,061 --> 02:26:30,061
about that.
Like how many,

3329
02:26:30,061 --> 02:26:30,240
how many,
uh,

3330
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:33,550
vitamin D pills can you take before it's
makes you sick.

3331
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:34,120
You know,
how many,

3332
02:26:34,310 --> 02:26:36,430
how many people take the wrong amount of
this,

3333
02:26:36,610 --> 02:26:37,460
how many people.
It's like,

3334
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:40,870
it's a real trial and error thing unless
you're doing blood work.

3335
02:26:40,871 --> 02:26:43,330
So I always encourage people,
if you're interested in your health,

3336
02:26:43,780 --> 02:26:48,780
you got to know what the fuck is really 
going on in your same ferris has get 

3337
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:49,300
blood work done,
don't take,

3338
02:26:49,660 --> 02:26:50,590
don't take guesses.

3339
02:26:50,590 --> 02:26:55,590
He found out he was low and I think my 
rick acid and that's why I take coconut 

3340
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:55,590
oil.
The only place you can find,

3341
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:57,580
I think it's called myrick or my silicic
acid.

3342
02:26:57,581 --> 02:26:59,320
The only place you can find it as in 
sperm,

3343
02:26:59,321 --> 02:27:02,320
whale oil and coconut oil.
And I started taking it.

3344
02:27:02,321 --> 02:27:07,321
I gotta tell you man,
like I take a teaspoon or a tablespoon 

3345
02:27:07,321 --> 02:27:07,321
in the morning.
I do,

3346
02:27:07,321 --> 02:27:08,170
but maybe a psychological,
but I feel better.

3347
02:27:08,171 --> 02:27:13,171
Man.
I feel better when I do things like the 

3348
02:27:13,171 --> 02:27:13,171
Kale shakes I want to do,
but I juice Kale when I take a,

3349
02:27:13,171 --> 02:27:18,070
you know,
coconut oil is present and I know that 

3350
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:18,070
people are skeptical.
They were like,

3351
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:20,440
oh,
maybe people are bullshitting.

3352
02:27:20,441 --> 02:27:22,660
Maybe this is just more in placebo 
effect.

3353
02:27:22,661 --> 02:27:24,430
Maybe this is like,
it makes sense.

3354
02:27:24,510 --> 02:27:26,890
It's a drug man.
Treat it like it's not just that.

3355
02:27:26,890 --> 02:27:29,950
It's also like,
what exactly is your body?

3356
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:31,720
Okay,
why does it need nutrients?

3357
02:27:31,750 --> 02:27:36,750
What is really going on?
What's this some sort of a chemical 

3358
02:27:36,750 --> 02:27:39,151
process and it just stands to reason 
that the more building blocks it gets 

3359
02:27:40,630 --> 02:27:43,480
for repair,
for a killing,

3360
02:27:43,481 --> 02:27:46,600
you know,
taking out anti radicals,

3361
02:27:46,900 --> 02:27:51,900
free radicals for destroying free 
radicals in your system for helping you 

3362
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:54,640
strengthen your immune system.
All those different things.

3363
02:27:54,641 --> 02:27:58,630
It just only makes sense that if the 
machine has all it needs,

3364
02:27:58,631 --> 02:27:59,940
it will function better.
It did.

3365
02:27:59,941 --> 02:28:02,710
Did Tim Ferriss tell you?
I had him on the podcast and he said he,

3366
02:28:02,740 --> 02:28:03,400
he did.
Um,

3367
02:28:03,490 --> 02:28:08,490
he went to the blue zone and Okinawa and
see where they have the one area where 

3368
02:28:08,490 --> 02:28:09,130
they live longer than anybody else.
Is it like a choral thing?

3369
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:10,120
Nope.
He said,

3370
02:28:10,330 --> 02:28:15,330
he said he isolated.
He was interested in seeing what they 

3371
02:28:15,330 --> 02:28:15,330
don't do.
One thing they don't eat rice.

3372
02:28:15,330 --> 02:28:16,120
Um,
they blue potatoes,

3373
02:28:16,610 --> 02:28:19,200
a blue potatoes.
Yes.

3374
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:22,070
But he also said that I tried

3375
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:24,200
to guess what they were,
but he said there are a couple of things

3376
02:28:24,201 --> 02:28:27,440
that they have that,
that very important for health one,

3377
02:28:27,441 --> 02:28:32,000
they never retire and too strong fucking
communities and,

3378
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:34,310
and they always eat just enough.
There's a,

3379
02:28:34,311 --> 02:28:36,140
there's a saying for it.
I eat just enough.

3380
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:41,200
I never,
I never stuff but mainly they think the 

3381
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:44,201
two main things and Malcolm Mcdowell 
gladwell talks about this community is 

3382
02:28:44,201 --> 02:28:47,300
fucking important for longevity,
community and never retiring.

3383
02:28:47,301 --> 02:28:52,301
Being interested in involved in 
something is so important for your 

3384
02:28:52,301 --> 02:28:52,340
health and it doesn't seem,
seems metaphysical.

3385
02:28:52,341 --> 02:28:53,720
It doesn't seem physical.
Like you know,

3386
02:28:53,721 --> 02:28:55,100
you can like this,
this,

3387
02:28:55,101 --> 02:29:00,101
this town,
Rosetta and heart disease in the 

3388
02:29:00,101 --> 02:29:00,560
fifties,
in this country with epidemic,

3389
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:05,680
they'd open up soldiers who are at at 21
and a lot of their car arteries were 80 

3390
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:06,770
percent clog.
It was epidemic.

3391
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:12,160
They go to this place Rosetta,
which is this really tight Italian 

3392
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:12,560
community in Pennsylvania.

3393
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:17,560
They Lard,
they were all overweight and none of 

3394
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:17,560
them were dying of heart disease.
They were all dying of old age.

3395
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:21,670
Why?
The only thing they can isolate it was 

3396
02:29:21,670 --> 02:29:23,831
the fact that they were such a tight 
loving community that then maybe they 

3397
02:29:23,831 --> 02:29:25,280
come from a really strong genetic stock.
They're all from the same part of Italy.

3398
02:29:25,490 --> 02:29:28,790
They took guys from Rosetta and who went
to other parts of the country.

3399
02:29:28,820 --> 02:29:30,620
They were dying of heart disease at the 
same rate,

3400
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:32,540
but when they were in this fucking 
community,

3401
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:36,920
they had such a strong tight bond within
that community and so much support.

3402
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:40,110
They were just happy people.
They were just happy people.

3403
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:45,140
It totally makes sense.
There's a physical aspect of human 

3404
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:45,140
interaction that there's.
There's a reaction,

3405
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:49,961
there's something happening and there's 
a need for it to the point where they 

3406
02:29:49,961 --> 02:29:50,360
punish people in prison,
but taking it away from them.

3407
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:52,160
If you don't touch a baby when they're,
when they're,

3408
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:54,320
when they're between zero and one,
they will die.

3409
02:29:54,321 --> 02:29:59,321
It's called failure to thrive.
Hospitals have to have people come by 

3410
02:29:59,321 --> 02:30:03,461
and hold the babies you cannot have.
They used to have an orphanage is they 

3411
02:30:03,461 --> 02:30:06,311
put a baby and they wouldn't touch it 
because they didn't want to give it a 

3412
02:30:06,311 --> 02:30:06,311
disease.
They did that.

3413
02:30:06,311 --> 02:30:07,820
The baby would die.
That's called failure to thrive.

3414
02:30:07,860 --> 02:30:12,350
You don't hold the baby for a certain 
amount of time during the day.

3415
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:14,600
They will die.
Completely believed.

3416
02:30:14,601 --> 02:30:18,690
That totally makes sense that we don't 
want to accept it as a.

3417
02:30:18,691 --> 02:30:23,690
it's an actual tangible,
measurable sort of a feeling or a thing,

3418
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:26,420
but it's important.
Community is important.

3419
02:30:26,690 --> 02:30:31,690
You're not asleep.
You're not an island and we need each 

3420
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:31,690
other.
I mean,

3421
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:31,690
when I think of all the good times,
and I think about that,

3422
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:33,590
I was watching the hunting thing that 
you and I go back so far.

3423
02:30:33,950 --> 02:30:38,950
I thought you feel so lucky when you 
have friends that you have so many 

3424
02:30:38,950 --> 02:30:41,480
experiences with you and I know each 
other so fucking well,

3425
02:30:42,130 --> 02:30:43,130
you know,
so well,

3426
02:30:43,131 --> 02:30:46,040
like all the thorns and all.
It's just such a and watched.

3427
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:47,720
We've grown up together,
you know,

3428
02:30:48,830 --> 02:30:50,120
that kind of stuff is,
is,

3429
02:30:50,121 --> 02:30:51,050
uh,
is priceless.

3430
02:30:51,260 --> 02:30:53,660
I mean everything else known you for 
almost 20 years now.

3431
02:30:53,810 --> 02:30:55,250
Twenty years.
It'll be 20 years.

3432
02:30:55,251 --> 02:30:58,040
Next year.
Long ass time.

3433
02:30:58,370 --> 02:31:00,710
He stopped to think about how much crazy
shit we've seen together.

3434
02:31:00,770 --> 02:31:05,770
Yeah.
And you've saved me from making some 

3435
02:31:05,770 --> 02:31:05,770
crazy decisions to,
you know,

3436
02:31:05,770 --> 02:31:07,440
you've saved me from going insane.
I mean,

3437
02:31:07,540 --> 02:31:09,110
I remember a meeting you,
it was like,

3438
02:31:09,111 --> 02:31:12,480
oh,
there's one out there I could hang with.

3439
02:31:13,010 --> 02:31:16,550
I grew up in a bunch of different places
in this country.

3440
02:31:16,670 --> 02:31:17,610
Uh,
you know,

3441
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:20,010
from when I was a little kid lived in 
San Francisco

3442
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:21,620
and I live in Florida,
but I spent,

3443
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:26,640
you know,
all through my high school years I 

3444
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:26,640
spent,
you know,

3445
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:27,550
in Boston and one of the things about 
Boston,

3446
02:31:27,551 --> 02:31:32,551
like I lived in a suburb,
Newton is he given that a lot of real 

3447
02:31:32,551 --> 02:31:36,301
guys is a lot of guys who got up at 6:00
in the fucking morning and mowed lawns 

3448
02:31:36,301 --> 02:31:37,870
before they came to school.
You know what I'm saying?

3449
02:31:38,140 --> 02:31:39,350
I mean there was,
there was,

3450
02:31:39,510 --> 02:31:42,280
there were men's men were,
there were actual men.

3451
02:31:42,380 --> 02:31:44,770
If someone talks some shit,
they wanted to go punch him in the face.

3452
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:47,230
It was like growing up around them,
it was like there was,

3453
02:31:47,231 --> 02:31:51,010
these are normal people that I could,
if he told me a story,

3454
02:31:51,011 --> 02:31:53,720
I knew that's what happened,
or at least what he thinks it happened.

3455
02:31:54,100 --> 02:31:57,220
But I was getting mixed signals.
When I came to La.

3456
02:31:57,220 --> 02:31:58,630
I was like,
oh my God,

3457
02:31:58,631 --> 02:32:03,631
this is insane asylum.
I was totally ready to go back to New 

3458
02:32:03,631 --> 02:32:04,510
York and if I didn't assign a fucking 
lease from my apartment,

3459
02:32:04,660 --> 02:32:07,150
I thought my show was going to that 
stupid baseball show.

3460
02:32:07,320 --> 02:32:12,320
Like I was an idiot.
I was 20 whatever years old to the 

3461
02:32:12,320 --> 02:32:13,150
greatest show ever.
I'm thinking getting an apartment.

3462
02:32:13,151 --> 02:32:15,010
I can't fail.
And uh,

3463
02:32:15,070 --> 02:32:16,180
within,
you know,

3464
02:32:16,510 --> 02:32:18,790
four weeks I knew it was doomed and I'm 
like,

3465
02:32:18,791 --> 02:32:20,620
fuck,
I got a fucking apartment.

3466
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:23,620
I got an apartment for a year,
I want to get out of here.

3467
02:32:23,621 --> 02:32:28,621
I was like,
this is filled with crazy people and it 

3468
02:32:28,621 --> 02:32:30,991
is by the way,
but I slowly but surely accumulated a 

3469
02:32:30,991 --> 02:32:32,200
group of great friends.
It took forever.

3470
02:32:32,470 --> 02:32:34,620
It's like slowly grab guys like you,
okay,

3471
02:32:34,630 --> 02:32:37,080
come this way.
And then some show ideas.

3472
02:32:37,110 --> 02:32:37,870
Look at this guy.
Oh,

3473
02:32:37,871 --> 02:32:39,070
we gotta get him,
get in there.

3474
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:41,370
It's really true.
You can I come to la,

3475
02:32:41,400 --> 02:32:42,280
la La.
It's like the,

3476
02:32:42,290 --> 02:32:43,230
you know,
the first,

3477
02:32:43,231 --> 02:32:48,231
uh,
my buddy said he was from New York and 

3478
02:32:48,231 --> 02:32:49,971
he showed up at a party and he goes to 
this party and there's this guy in a 

3479
02:32:49,971 --> 02:32:52,050
robe with his arm around two girls on 
couch and he goes like this.

3480
02:32:52,051 --> 02:32:53,160
He goes,
gentlemen,

3481
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:56,250
welcome to my place.
Make yourselves at all.

3482
02:32:56,650 --> 02:32:59,180
He was like,
get me the fuck out of here right now.

3483
02:32:59,190 --> 02:33:02,520
I'm going to kick you in the face and 
we're in a fucking robe.

3484
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:04,890
Shit.
Hell yeah,

3485
02:33:04,910 --> 02:33:05,210
don't.
Yeah,

3486
02:33:05,220 --> 02:33:08,370
just try that in Boston or New York.
See how long you last with that shit.

3487
02:33:08,610 --> 02:33:10,050
Like,
my buddy was rock climbing.

3488
02:33:10,051 --> 02:33:11,970
We were rock climbing.
My buddies from California,

3489
02:33:11,971 --> 02:33:14,280
he was being a smart ass with them and 
telling them what to do.

3490
02:33:14,430 --> 02:33:16,290
And my buddy was a wrestle.
My buddy turned him and goes,

3491
02:33:16,291 --> 02:33:17,760
hey,
you don't know you.

3492
02:33:17,790 --> 02:33:22,790
You sure as fuck don't know me.
And that's the last time I hear you 

3493
02:33:22,790 --> 02:33:23,460
telling me to do anything.
And everybody got quiet.

3494
02:33:23,770 --> 02:33:24,610
And he was like,
well,

3495
02:33:24,611 --> 02:33:25,440
what the fuck?
What the fuck?

3496
02:33:25,441 --> 02:33:26,610
The Guy fucking threatened me.
I go,

3497
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:27,750
that's right,
dude.

3498
02:33:27,751 --> 02:33:32,751
He threatened you physically because 
you're being a fucking disrespectful 

3499
02:33:32,751 --> 02:33:35,661
more on their guys out there that will 
punch you in the fucking face if you 

3500
02:33:35,661 --> 02:33:35,661
don't know how to behave.

3501
02:33:35,661 --> 02:33:39,440
There's a giant percentage of people who
grow up in this coast that they don't 

3502
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:40,710
know how to behave.
Never seen a fight.

3503
02:33:41,030 --> 02:33:42,600
What's.
Even if they have seen a fight,

3504
02:33:42,601 --> 02:33:44,700
they'd seen a fight between someone like
them and some of them.

3505
02:33:45,080 --> 02:33:48,410
I'm not talking about Mexicans either.
I'm talking about white guys not talking

3506
02:33:48,411 --> 02:33:51,080
about white guys in white guys in 
Hollywood.

3507
02:33:51,081 --> 02:33:52,430
I'm not.
There are some tough.

3508
02:33:52,610 --> 02:33:54,970
There's some tough.
Like I know a lot of Latino guys.

3509
02:33:54,971 --> 02:33:55,030
Yeah,

3510
02:33:55,110 --> 02:34:00,110
out here who are tough as shit.
That's a whole different culture when 

3511
02:34:00,110 --> 02:34:00,110
you're talking about is actors.
Yeah.

3512
02:34:00,110 --> 02:34:04,850
I'm talking about.
You're really talking about is nothing 

3513
02:34:04,850 --> 02:34:04,850
to do with white guys,
but yeah,

3514
02:34:04,850 --> 02:34:06,600
there's some tough ass fucking regular 
white dudes from California.

3515
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:09,930
Well you're talking about is actor.
That's what it is.

3516
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:13,710
Their loans.
They're fucking Limu and when I,

3517
02:34:13,740 --> 02:34:15,000
when I first met you,
I was like,

3518
02:34:15,001 --> 02:34:15,840
oh,
this guy's doing.

3519
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:18,850
He's normal to or you're not normal.
You're certainly not normal,

3520
02:34:18,851 --> 02:34:21,760
but neither am I or was.
I was just honest about my interests,

3521
02:34:21,761 --> 02:34:25,570
which were because I'm a caveman.
Both dudes like we could talk.

3522
02:34:25,571 --> 02:34:26,650
We were two men.
I was like,

3523
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:28,570
oh my God is another man.
I could talk to this man.

3524
02:34:28,760 --> 02:34:29,950
You know what's,
what's going on here?

3525
02:34:29,970 --> 02:34:32,350
I was like,
I feel I'm like,

3526
02:34:32,351 --> 02:34:34,540
what's with this fucking guy?
Ya Know?

3527
02:34:35,290 --> 02:34:37,530
These fucking people that were on the 
set with you just said,

3528
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:39,910
man,
tv were exhausting,

3529
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:45,720
exhausting,
trying to be funny and clunky and 

3530
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:48,580
talking about their career.
Shut the fuck up.

3531
02:34:48,650 --> 02:34:53,650
My God.
What kind of self serving noises coming 

3532
02:34:53,650 --> 02:34:57,751
out of that stupid head of yours,
like you don't even know that someone's 

3533
02:34:57,751 --> 02:34:58,420
listening to you.
You can't even have a conversation.

3534
02:34:58,421 --> 02:35:03,421
You're not even a person.
You're one of those weird fucking actor 

3535
02:35:03,421 --> 02:35:06,721
automatons.
I came to dinner one time and I had a 

3536
02:35:06,721 --> 02:35:09,760
hat.
Turned backwards was fucking cool shit.

3537
02:35:09,761 --> 02:35:14,761
I looked in the mirror like 50 times 
that day because I just had this new 

3538
02:35:14,761 --> 02:35:14,761
hat.
I fucking sit down there and say,

3539
02:35:14,761 --> 02:35:16,270
well,
my father looked at me and he just goes,

3540
02:35:16,780 --> 02:35:17,600
done.
I go,

3541
02:35:17,620 --> 02:35:18,490
I'm good.
He goes,

3542
02:35:18,491 --> 02:35:22,050
yeah,
I can't do what he does.

3543
02:35:22,060 --> 02:35:24,490
He goes,
why are you wearing that hat?

3544
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:27,490
I'm not anymore.

3545
02:35:28,300 --> 02:35:29,570
Just the way he said it,
I was like,

3546
02:35:29,571 --> 02:35:30,160
oh,
I fucking,

3547
02:35:30,161 --> 02:35:33,160
I'm an idiot.
But today if you wanted to do it,

3548
02:35:33,161 --> 02:35:34,380
you could pull it off.
Fuck.

3549
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:38,110
Like now you're a different man.
Now you're self actualized.

3550
02:35:38,111 --> 02:35:41,480
Self realize now you could show up with 
a bra on and like,

3551
02:35:41,590 --> 02:35:46,590
father you're,
you're missing a certain amount of 

3552
02:35:46,590 --> 02:35:47,200
sophistication and worldliness,
torture my generation.

3553
02:35:47,201 --> 02:35:52,201
I mean I read books and wearing a,
it's like you can't fuck with us and a 

3554
02:35:52,201 --> 02:35:56,131
scarf,
but you could laugh about that and it 

3555
02:35:56,131 --> 02:35:56,710
would be great.
But if I was 21 and I was wearing a bra,

3556
02:35:56,711 --> 02:36:01,711
I was serious.
I was really trying to wear a bra like 

3557
02:36:01,711 --> 02:36:01,711
fucking asshole.
Like what am I?

3558
02:36:01,711 --> 02:36:02,200
One of the like,
you know what I mean?

3559
02:36:02,201 --> 02:36:05,160
Like with those green,
not the what of those dudes that the,

3560
02:36:05,170 --> 02:36:07,590
the,
the Guardian angels remember that.

3561
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:09,850
Of course,
dude,

3562
02:36:10,060 --> 02:36:13,900
I remember being in Boston and they just
made it to Boston were raise,

3563
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:19,100
but yeah,
they were in New York for awhile and 

3564
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:20,941
they just made it to Boston and the guy 
was walking around who's guardian 

3565
02:36:20,941 --> 02:36:24,331
angels,
a t shirt on and this bra on and he's 

3566
02:36:24,331 --> 02:36:25,930
walking and I look at him and I'm 
following him and I'm locking eyes.

3567
02:36:25,931 --> 02:36:27,850
When he looked at me and goes,
fuck you.

3568
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:30,190
He gave me the finger and I'm like,
well,

3569
02:36:30,191 --> 02:36:32,170
I didn't even say anything.
I didn't even say anything.

3570
02:36:32,171 --> 02:36:35,160
And you are a fucking guardian angel.
Really?

3571
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:39,640
And then the guy who was the head of it,
who is a,

3572
02:36:39,770 --> 02:36:43,900
a radio dj guy now,
he like faked a rape.

3573
02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:48,820
He faked a where he helped someone and 
he got shot,

3574
02:36:48,821 --> 02:36:49,490
you know?
Yeah.

3575
02:36:49,580 --> 02:36:50,950
But there was something that he faked.
Hold on,

3576
02:36:50,951 --> 02:36:53,570
I'll pull it up.
I don't want to slam over young man.

3577
02:36:54,130 --> 02:36:55,660
Curtis Silva,
I think his name is.

3578
02:36:55,840 --> 02:37:00,470
Yeah.
Fake story as quick story started.

3579
02:37:00,610 --> 02:37:01,640
The uh,
yeah,

3580
02:37:01,690 --> 02:37:04,210
I think that was horse shit.
Yeah,

3581
02:37:04,330 --> 02:37:05,380
I think,
uh,

3582
02:37:05,440 --> 02:37:10,270
I think that my courtesy was history of 
lies and publicity stunts part one.

3583
02:37:10,390 --> 02:37:14,210
Ooh,
that's not good year.

3584
02:37:17,500 --> 02:37:22,500
He admitted to creating and perpetuating
at least six hoaxes over the years 

3585
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:25,330
between 1979 and 1980 according to the 
December 14th,

3586
02:37:25,331 --> 02:37:27,700
1992 issue of people magazine because 
that's.

3587
02:37:27,701 --> 02:37:32,701
Remember when he got in trouble and the 
article sibyl recounts a October 1980 

3588
02:37:32,701 --> 02:37:37,081
publicity stunt where he claimed he was 
kidnapped by New York City transit 

3589
02:37:37,081 --> 02:37:39,490
police and told if the Guardian Angels 
Don't quit patrolling the subways,

3590
02:37:39,491 --> 02:37:44,491
they would kill him.
Everyone was against a silver plate and 

3591
02:37:44,491 --> 02:37:44,770
explained the mayor of the cops.
Even the public.

3592
02:37:44,980 --> 02:37:46,720
We just needed some good attention.
Oh,

3593
02:37:46,721 --> 02:37:48,100
he's a fucking scam.
Artists,

3594
02:37:48,580 --> 02:37:53,580
you know,
if you're a scam artist once you're a 

3595
02:37:53,580 --> 02:37:53,580
scam artist forever.
Fuck you.

3596
02:37:53,740 --> 02:37:55,150
You know,
this is just,

3597
02:37:55,151 --> 02:37:56,350
this is what he's doing.
I mean,

3598
02:37:56,351 --> 02:37:58,180
I guess,
can you bounce back from that?

3599
02:37:58,181 --> 02:37:58,600
Sure.

3600
02:37:58,700 --> 02:38:00,130
I'm going to try to do that with my 
standup.

3601
02:38:00,380 --> 02:38:01,250
Somehow.
I'm going to be like,

3602
02:38:01,251 --> 02:38:03,110
I got arrested for making people laugh 
too much.

3603
02:38:03,111 --> 02:38:05,900
They were pulling people out on fucking 
out on stretchers.

3604
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:07,330
This guy would have to bounce back

3605
02:38:07,500 --> 02:38:09,090
long way though,
man,

3606
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:10,110
you know,
he would bounce.

3607
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:14,220
He'd have to bounce back a long way 
because this is.

3608
02:38:15,210 --> 02:38:20,210
He's had another guy I worked with them 
who claimed that a fixed several 

3609
02:38:20,210 --> 02:38:22,250
incidents,
including highly publicized rape of then

3610
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:24,000
wife Lisa Silva,
Jesus,

3611
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:26,180
whatever it is.
Yeah.

3612
02:38:26,190 --> 02:38:27,960
He's a.
any fake that too.

3613
02:38:28,590 --> 02:38:29,670
Yeah.
Wow.

3614
02:38:30,270 --> 02:38:30,920
It's.
Well,

3615
02:38:30,970 --> 02:38:33,080
they have a cabin.
They did shoot him,

3616
02:38:33,081 --> 02:38:35,010
I think in the legs or something.
Yeah.

3617
02:38:35,011 --> 02:38:36,000
Well,
whatever it is.

3618
02:38:36,030 --> 02:38:37,840
I mean,
who knows what happened.

3619
02:38:37,841 --> 02:38:39,630
He might have paid someone to do 
something crazy to him.

3620
02:38:39,631 --> 02:38:41,040
Who knows?
Maybe it was just.

3621
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:43,740
If you're doing this many bullshit 
publicity stunts,

3622
02:38:43,741 --> 02:38:48,741
you're probably a really annoying guy.
Somebody will eventually actually does 

3623
02:38:48,741 --> 02:38:48,810
want to shoot you.
It's really annoyed at you.

3624
02:38:50,010 --> 02:38:51,780
Silly Bitch.
But if I was wearing that Bra,

3625
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:52,560
yeah,
yeah,

3626
02:38:52,830 --> 02:38:53,490
smack me.
Well,

3627
02:38:53,491 --> 02:38:55,620
if I was 21 smack me.
You're not allowed to wear a bra.

3628
02:38:55,680 --> 02:38:56,370
Yeah.
Even today,

3629
02:38:56,371 --> 02:38:57,720
I can't pull off a boy.
No,

3630
02:38:57,780 --> 02:38:58,350
nobody can.

3631
02:38:59,290 --> 02:39:00,720
All right.
Unless you.

3632
02:39:00,721 --> 02:39:02,480
Randy coture,
unless you're a green baret,

3633
02:39:02,481 --> 02:39:07,481
unless you're a green beret or in the 
French Foreign Legion that you can wear 

3634
02:39:07,481 --> 02:39:09,150
a bra if you're in a Gi Joe to some 
does.

3635
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:10,610
He does the new Gi.
Joe,

3636
02:39:10,611 --> 02:39:15,611
does he have a brewery?
I think one of the guys like Falcon or 

3637
02:39:15,611 --> 02:39:15,611
something.
If they're done well,

3638
02:39:15,611 --> 02:39:19,871
like I went to turn on teamwork around.
You've got a machine gun in your French 

3639
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:22,340
or you're in the French Foreign Legion 
or something.

3640
02:39:22,341 --> 02:39:24,650
You can actually.
You look pretty good.

3641
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:25,760
You have.
It is kind of.

3642
02:39:25,850 --> 02:39:27,900
Isn't that kind of funny that you're 
like,

3643
02:39:27,950 --> 02:39:29,930
if you're a killer,
you're allowed to wear a bra.

3644
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:32,870
Like that's when you're allowed to wear 
the silliest hat ever.

3645
02:39:33,150 --> 02:39:35,630
We want you to wear the silliest had 
ever because you're our best killer.

3646
02:39:36,150 --> 02:39:37,760
Like why don't give him a cat in the hat
hat?

3647
02:39:38,210 --> 02:39:41,450
Imagine that the fucking seat instead of
the Green Berets and see that cat in the

3648
02:39:41,490 --> 02:39:42,350
hat's just.

3649
02:39:42,350 --> 02:39:43,760
They're so gangster.
They don't give a fuck.

3650
02:39:43,761 --> 02:39:45,250
If you see that.
Hat's the Kombucha.

3651
02:39:45,380 --> 02:39:46,910
This is pretty funny.
Here's a.

3652
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:50,330
here's a screenshot.
Gi Joe to the characters,

3653
02:39:50,390 --> 02:39:51,810
and then we got.
Hi Guys.

3654
02:39:51,811 --> 02:39:54,010
I'm wearing a bra here.
He doesn't look back.

3655
02:39:54,130 --> 02:39:59,130
No.
The Brian keeps saying that he has gay 

3656
02:39:59,130 --> 02:39:59,130
accent.
Just stopped doing that voice.

3657
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:01,070
That's Dennis Quaid.
It's so dumb.

3658
02:40:01,110 --> 02:40:04,580
He doesn't sound like him and you can't 
keep repeating it.

3659
02:40:04,610 --> 02:40:06,160
It's not funny.
It's not true.

3660
02:40:06,230 --> 02:40:08,990
Agreed with me and nobody agreed with 
you owe people that agreed with you.

3661
02:40:08,991 --> 02:40:13,991
Just wanted to talk to you.
They just wanted to reach out to you on 

3662
02:40:13,991 --> 02:40:13,991
the Internet.
There.

3663
02:40:13,991 --> 02:40:14,040
Isn't that crazy test a bad dennis 
quaid.

3664
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:14,890
He's not.
He doesn't.

3665
02:40:15,550 --> 02:40:18,730
He doesn't think Dennis Quaid sounds 
like a a,

3666
02:40:18,810 --> 02:40:21,720
a South Park character really?
Well,

3667
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:26,990
what he did sound like in that movie,
you're talking about that today after 

3668
02:40:26,990 --> 02:40:27,230
tomorrow was totally fake it.

3669
02:40:27,230 --> 02:40:28,390
That's absolutely true.
It was like a.

3670
02:40:28,560 --> 02:40:32,070
It was such a super fake movie.
That is his acting sucked.

3671
02:40:32,190 --> 02:40:34,080
It was.
It was a terrible movie.

3672
02:40:34,081 --> 02:40:36,710
I mean the day after tomorrow,
it's.

3673
02:40:37,050 --> 02:40:41,130
It's almost impossible to do and not be 
ridiculous.

3674
02:40:41,131 --> 02:40:43,230
What have you seen that you love besides
les miserables?

3675
02:40:43,290 --> 02:40:48,290
What have you seen that I got injected,
injected into my asshole with a laser 

3676
02:40:50,131 --> 02:40:51,030
beam.
I didn't.

3677
02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:56,090
I wouldn't watch on the screen.
I want to experience it through my 

3678
02:40:56,090 --> 02:40:56,090
central nervous system,
asshole first.

3679
02:40:56,850 --> 02:40:57,880
And uh,
I love you.

3680
02:40:58,030 --> 02:41:01,440
I came,
I came in my own mouth.

3681
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:02,780
It's my,
my calm.

3682
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:05,910
I opened my mouth and it was like 
crescendo.

3683
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:11,160
The jet came out of my cock that was the
exact shape of my mouth on the inside 

3684
02:41:12,271 --> 02:41:16,920
and it went in seamlessly.
It was an air tight airtight seal gallon

3685
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:19,220
of calm,
just like,

3686
02:41:19,250 --> 02:41:24,250
like,
like a wiffle ball bat suspended from 

3687
02:41:24,250 --> 02:41:26,430
the tip of my dick out in a fan shape of
my mouth and went right in the hole.

3688
02:41:27,240 --> 02:41:32,240
You haven't,
you have to sit through a fucking 

3689
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:32,240
musical.
One time I remember you told me what was

3690
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:32,240
like,
he goes,

3691
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:33,550
it was a murderer.
Attention on my murders,

3692
02:41:33,580 --> 02:41:36,010
assault my attention span.
Yeah.

3693
02:41:36,180 --> 02:41:40,290
I had a friend that was a in a musical 
and we all went and we watched the first

3694
02:41:40,291 --> 02:41:42,240
half and then I was like,
what do you guys think?

3695
02:41:42,510 --> 02:41:43,470
And they're like,
well,

3696
02:41:43,471 --> 02:41:46,200
I think she's doing a really great job,
but think it was awesome.

3697
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:51,560
And I said,
that was a fucking murderers assault on 

3698
02:41:51,560 --> 02:41:51,750
your attention span.
How dare you pretend you'd like that?

3699
02:41:51,900 --> 02:41:54,990
Nobody could possibly like that.
When you're watching nonsense,

3700
02:41:54,991 --> 02:41:58,200
you're watching songs that suck for no 
reason.

3701
02:41:58,201 --> 02:42:01,440
Someone's singing songs for no reason 
and those songs are fucking terrible.

3702
02:42:01,710 --> 02:42:04,380
This shit doesn't make any sense.
Shut your mouth.

3703
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:05,620
You shut your mouth.
You're not enjoying it.

3704
02:42:05,740 --> 02:42:10,740
It'd be weird if I started singing now 
to tell you she's what?

3705
02:42:11,740 --> 02:42:15,000
Joe,
y'all my friend that was like,

3706
02:42:15,150 --> 02:42:18,120
they drop their jaw so I get embarrassed
when I eat.

3707
02:42:18,140 --> 02:42:21,930
When I see those things were all of a 
sudden the guy starts to sing.

3708
02:42:22,050 --> 02:42:27,050
Well,
what about the time that you had an 

3709
02:42:27,050 --> 02:42:27,050
acting class?
Brian and international.

3710
02:42:27,050 --> 02:42:28,440
And it was in the.
Did I?

3711
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:31,470
Okay.
Was Brian and acting class?

3712
02:42:31,530 --> 02:42:33,710
And it was,
he had a,

3713
02:42:33,950 --> 02:42:38,700
the teacher was singing show tunes and 
Brian called me up and he says,

3714
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:42,210
you have to come to this.
My teacher is going to sing,

3715
02:42:42,211 --> 02:42:45,460
show tunes.
London's it.

3716
02:42:45,750 --> 02:42:46,770
So I,
I went,

3717
02:42:46,771 --> 02:42:50,160
I found Brian and me and him just like 
cuddled up like a couple of retards,

3718
02:42:50,161 --> 02:42:51,510
like,
oh my goodness,

3719
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:54,150
this is the most ridiculous thing I've 
ever seen.

3720
02:42:55,410 --> 02:42:58,040
He was singing,
he was a,

3721
02:42:58,260 --> 02:42:59,010
you know,
he was a guy,

3722
02:42:59,011 --> 02:43:01,110
he's a great guy,
but he just loved show tunes,

3723
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:03,050
fucking love them and,
and,

3724
02:43:03,051 --> 02:43:03,870
and very straight.

3725
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:05,130
And uh,
I was,

3726
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:06,510
I was so fascinated.
I was like,

3727
02:43:06,511 --> 02:43:08,730
you love musicals.
He loved them.

3728
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:10,380
You know,
I sat through a musical,

3729
02:43:10,690 --> 02:43:11,890
a musical theater class,
you know,

3730
02:43:11,891 --> 02:43:13,720
that.
Did I ever tell you that your teacher,

3731
02:43:13,721 --> 02:43:14,820
was he?
Yes.

3732
02:43:15,090 --> 02:43:17,640
I was so obsessed with.
So I was like,

3733
02:43:17,641 --> 02:43:19,360
I gotta see who loves this stuff.
I,

3734
02:43:19,361 --> 02:43:24,361
I get obsessed with that stuff.
I see in the insanity and I'll get 

3735
02:43:24,361 --> 02:43:24,750
involved in it.
Man,

3736
02:43:24,990 --> 02:43:26,610
I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed it.

3737
02:43:26,980 --> 02:43:29,600
Wrong reasons what you and I had a great
fucking time then,

3738
02:43:29,601 --> 02:43:31,170
right?
It was really a good laugh.

3739
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:32,130
Yeah,
he was great.

3740
02:43:32,560 --> 02:43:37,560
I had the lyrics of his song stuck in my
head for so many years because it was so

3741
02:43:37,621 --> 02:43:40,110
bad.
It was like show tunes though.

3742
02:43:40,170 --> 02:43:45,170
She says,
may you have a training when you are 

3743
02:43:45,170 --> 02:43:46,760
thirsty and needed really literal songs 
on the nose.

3744
02:43:46,761 --> 02:43:51,761
Really bad it was,
but it was like one of those where it's 

3745
02:43:51,761 --> 02:43:51,761
like,
she's gone away.

3746
02:43:51,761 --> 02:43:56,450
Me,
you have a Sun News Da,

3747
02:43:56,600 --> 02:44:00,590
you have a hug when you need a hug,
we should do a music.

3748
02:44:00,591 --> 02:44:01,880
Oh No,
we shouldn't ask.

3749
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:06,990
No hunting now.
I really enjoyed the book of Mormon that

3750
02:44:08,861 --> 02:44:10,320
was allowed.
It was great.

3751
02:44:11,050 --> 02:44:13,900
It's really good,
but I liked their movies better.

3752
02:44:13,930 --> 02:44:15,100
How about that?
How about that?

3753
02:44:15,101 --> 02:44:20,101
Even even even the best case scenario 
when a bunch of people are singing 

3754
02:44:20,101 --> 02:44:23,920
theater guy now south like South Park,
the movie is still to this day,

3755
02:44:23,921 --> 02:44:27,430
I think like one of the greatest comedy 
special or comedy movies,

3756
02:44:27,431 --> 02:44:28,690
et Cetera.
Thirty call me up that,

3757
02:44:28,691 --> 02:44:29,680
you know,
I've never seen it.

3758
02:44:29,890 --> 02:44:30,550
I'm like,
God,

3759
02:44:30,551 --> 02:44:32,900
that's so crazy.
Team America never.

3760
02:44:33,010 --> 02:44:36,760
Oh my God,
I have to write what is wrong with you?

3761
02:44:36,761 --> 02:44:41,761
I'm going to do that.
That's what I'm going to write that 

3762
02:44:41,761 --> 02:44:41,761
down.
Yeah,

3763
02:44:41,761 --> 02:44:43,990
because and it was because it was so 
ridiculous in team America was also a 

3764
02:44:44,681 --> 02:44:45,130
musical.

3765
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:46,870
There was a lot of musical elements to 
it.

3766
02:44:46,871 --> 02:44:51,871
It was like a,
it was a little bit of music and then a 

3767
02:44:51,871 --> 02:44:51,880
lot of acting sort of like,
even like the book of Mormon.

3768
02:44:51,881 --> 02:44:55,430
Isn't that the one where Sean Penn got 
really mad at them for making fun of a.

3769
02:44:55,900 --> 02:44:58,210
didn't have a lot of things that.
Come on,

3770
02:44:58,211 --> 02:45:00,820
Shaun,
you got to take shawn uptight.

3771
02:45:00,821 --> 02:45:01,870
He needs a hug.
Well,

3772
02:45:01,900 --> 02:45:03,370
it's against.
He's a fucking actor.

3773
02:45:03,430 --> 02:45:06,280
There's no getting around that man.
The best actors,

3774
02:45:06,281 --> 02:45:11,281
the most,
the coolest ones to hang out with are 

3775
02:45:11,281 --> 02:45:11,590
still not nearly as interesting as your 
average landscaper.

3776
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:12,980
Right?
So fact,

3777
02:45:12,990 --> 02:45:14,590
why am I podcast?
I never have actors.

3778
02:45:14,591 --> 02:45:15,950
I always want to have like,
you know,

3779
02:45:16,390 --> 02:45:21,390
other people,
like somebody who writes a book or a or 

3780
02:45:21,390 --> 02:45:21,390
a soldier.
I don't know.

3781
02:45:21,390 --> 02:45:21,390
Somebody,
a lawyer,

3782
02:45:21,390 --> 02:45:22,360
you know,
it's more interesting to me.

3783
02:45:22,410 --> 02:45:27,410
Yeah,
I remember I was listening to an 

3784
02:45:27,410 --> 02:45:27,410
interview and uh,
I think Brad Pitt's an awesome actor,

3785
02:45:27,410 --> 02:45:28,240
no doubt about it.
But it was like I was listening,

3786
02:45:28,241 --> 02:45:31,210
I was like on CNN and I wasn't paying 
attention on care and I was like,

3787
02:45:31,211 --> 02:45:34,740
who is this idiot that Larry King's 
talking to Brad attack?

3788
02:45:36,220 --> 02:45:37,930
It doesn't mean he's going to make them 
believe.

3789
02:45:37,931 --> 02:45:41,680
And that's what it doesn't mean he's got
charisma is great to look at.

3790
02:45:41,681 --> 02:45:43,960
It doesn't mean I'm going to listen to 
his point of view on life.

3791
02:45:43,961 --> 02:45:46,660
I,
you know what also I think that the,

3792
02:45:46,780 --> 02:45:49,960
the ability to transform yourself into 
another person like you know,

3793
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:56,040
doesn't necessarily lend itself to you 
being in an eloquent public speaker and 

3794
02:45:56,531 --> 02:45:58,750
representative of,
of your craft.

3795
02:45:58,900 --> 02:46:00,730
A little.
Probably a Weirdos like,

3796
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:06,820
oh,
you mean because Daniel Day Lewis lived 

3797
02:46:06,820 --> 02:46:06,850
in a log cabin with no electricity 
through the whole time he shot Lincoln.

3798
02:46:07,180 --> 02:46:12,180
Hey Dude still sucked.
That's gotta suck when you do that,

3799
02:46:13,340 --> 02:46:18,340
when you spend so much time.
Still the fucking shit out of him with 

3800
02:46:18,340 --> 02:46:22,640
the box.
We trained for three years to be a 

3801
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:22,640
boxer.
For me,

3802
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:22,640
I got good and I watched.
I was like,

3803
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:26,171
well,
you could've done the movie without 

3804
02:46:26,171 --> 02:46:26,171
being a boxer.
Actually it wasn't.

3805
02:46:26,171 --> 02:46:26,360
It wasn't that it wasn't like the 
deciding factor,

3806
02:46:26,510 --> 02:46:27,710
but it wants to him,
man,

3807
02:46:28,740 --> 02:46:30,920
he is that guy.
Christian Bale said it the best.

3808
02:46:30,921 --> 02:46:35,921
They said,
why do you lose weight or you've put 

3809
02:46:35,921 --> 02:46:35,921
yourself through all this crazy shit.
He goes,

3810
02:46:35,921 --> 02:46:35,921
you know why I do that stuff,
dude.

3811
02:46:35,921 --> 02:46:37,760
I make believe I wear makeup for a 
living.

3812
02:46:37,761 --> 02:46:42,761
It doesn't make me feel like a man,
so I got to make it really fucking 

3813
02:46:42,761 --> 02:46:42,940
difficult on myself.
It was great answer.

3814
02:46:42,990 --> 02:46:44,720
Do it needs a hug too.
They all need hugs.

3815
02:46:44,930 --> 02:46:48,210
Okay,
mark and mark doesn't have that a to and

3816
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:50,390
looking at me.
What you guys want?

3817
02:46:50,391 --> 02:46:52,490
Attitude and you want to laugh.
You come to San Antonio,

3818
02:46:52,520 --> 02:46:53,960
Ella,
laugh out loud.

3819
02:46:53,961 --> 02:46:55,910
Comedy club Friday,
Saturday and Sunday,

3820
02:46:56,770 --> 02:46:58,060
lol,
lol,

3821
02:47:00,110 --> 02:47:02,660
and listen to the 10 minute podcasts and
Brian Cowen show.

3822
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:06,590
I'm out 35 because that's a good way to 
end this thing.

3823
02:47:06,650 --> 02:47:08,310
Let's fucking wrap it up.
This or this.

3824
02:47:08,510 --> 02:47:10,160
Saturday night,
I'll be in Indianapolis,

3825
02:47:10,190 --> 02:47:12,670
Indiana with young Tony Hinchcliffe.
Take it.

3826
02:47:12,700 --> 02:47:14,810
Tony out in the road break is a little 
comedy.

3827
02:47:14,811 --> 02:47:17,910
Booty break is cherry and he's chairman.

3828
02:47:20,130 --> 02:47:22,010
Cliff Pricey.
What is that?

3829
02:47:22,040 --> 02:47:23,840
That's how you spell his last name.
Oh,

3830
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:25,880
silly.
Um,

3831
02:47:25,881 --> 02:47:27,440
so that's a,
that's a Saturday night.

3832
02:47:27,450 --> 02:47:30,050
Indianapolis News,
New Brunswick,

3833
02:47:30,100 --> 02:47:31,550
New Jersey.
I'm pretty sure it's sold out.

3834
02:47:31,910 --> 02:47:34,800
And I think San Jose sold out too.
So Sam,

3835
02:47:35,150 --> 02:47:37,580
Shawn Rogan,
Joe Rogan experience.

3836
02:47:39,170 --> 02:47:42,500
That's my walking dead voice every time 
I see you.

3837
02:47:42,501 --> 02:47:44,220
And then I see me.
We've set something.

3838
02:47:44,270 --> 02:47:45,610
Could've been brothers.
Oh easily.

3839
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:49,790
Well everybody in my house by the way.
My parents watched the mediator episodes

3840
02:47:49,820 --> 02:47:52,670
they want to because they were kind of 
freaked out about Michela dear.

3841
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:57,790
A little.
A little odd to see them watch those it 

3842
02:47:57,790 --> 02:47:58,520
with a hatchet,
like chip open the fucking rib cases.

3843
02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:00,380
Pretty intense stuff.
But um,

3844
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:05,440
they were like,
do you guys look like the closest two 

3845
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:07,811
brothers you ever have?
Like as you get older you really look 

3846
02:48:07,811 --> 02:48:07,811
like brothers.
I kept,

3847
02:48:07,811 --> 02:48:09,140
like I was saying,
is that job or that strange?

3848
02:48:09,230 --> 02:48:11,570
I'm better looking at times a little 
sexier.

3849
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:14,270
You're a little sexier.
Rogan.ting.com.

3850
02:48:14,271 --> 02:48:17,210
Pitches go there.
Save yourself $25,

3851
02:48:17,810 --> 02:48:22,100
put it in your mouth,
putting your mouth and his balls.

3852
02:48:22,370 --> 02:48:24,050
That doesn't make any sense.
I'm sorry Tim,

3853
02:48:24,380 --> 02:48:27,260
you don't deserve that for your 
commercial Rogan.ting.com.

3854
02:48:27,290 --> 02:48:32,290
Go there and save yourself to $25 off 
either a phone or service.

3855
02:48:34,791 --> 02:48:38,870
An excellent company that supports the 
podcast so police support them.

3856
02:48:39,080 --> 02:48:42,800
We were also brought to you by square 
space and uh,

3857
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:47,920
I think it is squarespace.com
forward slash Joe.

3858
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:49,940
And I think,
uh,

3859
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:53,300
I think it's the code is joe three right
for now.

3860
02:48:53,330 --> 02:48:54,720
Probably Joe Fournier.
It doesn't work,

3861
02:48:54,760 --> 02:48:55,360
dude.
Joe Three.

3862
02:48:55,640 --> 02:49:00,640
Yeah.
Be Creative if it doesn't work just to 

3863
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:01,100
figure it out.
Your dirty fucks,

3864
02:49:01,101 --> 02:49:03,800

3865
02:49:03,801 --> 02:49:08,700

I want Dolphin bought a whole.

3866
02:49:08,701 --> 02:49:11,190
He put that shit together while this 
show is going on,

3867
02:49:11,191 --> 02:49:11,970
ladies and gentlemen.

3868
02:49:12,330 --> 02:49:17,330
Okay.
I mean it's really that ridiculous and 

3869
02:49:17,330 --> 02:49:17,330
he probably will maintain it too.
It's so easy.

3870
02:49:17,330 --> 02:49:18,960
Throw some pictures up there.
Every now and then and people.

3871
02:49:18,990 --> 02:49:21,630
Only people who listen to this episode 
will know about this.

3872
02:49:21,830 --> 02:49:24,270
Register that.
Hurry quickly use hover to register it.

3873
02:49:24,271 --> 02:49:28,080
I want often butthole.com.
Don't get.org

3874
02:49:28,081 --> 02:49:30,750
because then you can't profit legally.
I think I made that up.

3875
02:49:30,780 --> 02:49:32,430
Get Dot net.
Be Clever.

3876

3878
02:49:39,091 --> 02:49:40,050

So what it is,

3879
02:49:40,370 --> 02:49:41,460

Yeah,

3880
02:49:42,470 --> 02:49:43,500

You Fox.
Get a case of a God damn website.

3883
02:49:48,510 --> 02:49:51,330
We're all out of the chimp kettlebells 
at [inaudible] dot com.

3884
02:49:51,331 --> 02:49:56,040
But we got more common and like I said,
a lot more cool shit headed your way and

3885
02:49:56,041 --> 02:49:59,040
if you think of any cool shit that we 
need to have in the store,

3886
02:49:59,070 --> 02:50:00,450
fucking let us know about it.

3887
02:50:00,690 --> 02:50:03,860
Pills settled down.
Sign those gas stations.

3888
02:50:03,990 --> 02:50:05,460
You can't sell it legally over the 
Internet.

3889
02:50:06,390 --> 02:50:09,780
The CIALIS,
Chinese mixtures sold from Canada.

3890
02:50:09,870 --> 02:50:14,870
Powerful bra you for being on.
Okay.

3891
02:50:15,230 --> 02:50:20,230
And you or are also not as awesome as 
you mentioned the awesomest ever.

3892
02:50:20,881 --> 02:50:22,860
So it's impossible to be anymore.
Awesome.

3893
02:50:22,861 --> 02:50:25,620
So what'd you said?
Makes no so powerful.

3894
02:50:25,630 --> 02:50:28,430

3897
02:50:33,870 --> 02:50:38,870
Powerful lineup though.

3901
02:50:46,860 --> 02:50:49,071
liked the big robot.
We just did the little room last Friday 

3902
02:50:49,071 --> 02:50:49,071
