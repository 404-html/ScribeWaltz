1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,103
Down Highway Forty one,
I'm Laura was born Ram than trying to 

2
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:10,704
make a living and doing the best I can.
So when it's time to leave and I hope 

3
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:22,431
you understand that was bone rambling 
man.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,340
I don't think we live.
Are We?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,320
We are live.
Oh Ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,350
Oh Dude,
I'm a big fan man.

7
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:33,790
Melissa,
you heard that?

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,690
Oh,
I love that song.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,270
I used to listen to um,
midnight rider.

10
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,830
I used to,
whenever I used to do radio,

11
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:42,550
whenever do Kevin Vein was to the last 
radio that I decided to do in La.

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,413
Like I,
I used to do a lot of radio morning 

13
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,990
radio and getting up in the morning is 
rough because then you try to take a nap

14
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,300
and you always feel a little groggy 
during the first show.

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,173
Yeah.
Weekends.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,980
So the last one I would do is Kevin had 
been in La and smoke a joint,

17
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:58,300
get up in the morning,
smoke a joint and,

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,283
and always put on midnight rider always 
for some reason because it was dark 

19
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:06,010
house to.
I wish we could play it.

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,150
We can't play it though,
right?

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,930
God,
what happens to I,

22
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:11,080
I play Presto.
Just be dead air.

23
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:11,690
Kind of.
Oh,

24
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,330
that's kind of sing along to talk about 
it.

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,580
Okay.
Let's do that.

26
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,050
So the youtube will pull us off,
but regular radio won't.

27
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:25,051
But Jamie has the ability to go live 
unregular podcast type shit as anarchy,

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,210
Bro.
Yeah,

29
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,210
I like some light anarchy.
Do Doon.

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,030
Doon.
Doon.

31
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,661
Doon.
Doon.

32
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:34,660
Doon.
Doon.

33
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,130
If you haven't heard this.
God.

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,410
Is this a live version?
Oh yeah.

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,913
Is it?

36
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,580
Wow.
And um.

37
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,670
Oh,
it's totally different now.

38
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,703
It's good.

39
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,120
I'm not calling called catch.
No,

40
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,730
not catch them in.

41
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,270
Plus he fucks share diddy.
Yeah,

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,670
he used to fuck share back with.

43
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,980
Oh,
the clothes.

44
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:22,981
I'm wearing animals and I'm not gone.
I don't know.

45
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,880
That's beautiful man.
Giovan.

46
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,420
Ladies and gentlemen.
I knew you would appreciate that kind of

47
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:44,470
music feel.
Vaughn,

48
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:46,060
you got taste.
You got soul kid.

49
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:46,894
You got something going on.
I wish I was blind sometime you ever 

50
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:49,114
take.
But that the music so good because if 

51
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,380
you're blonde I bet it's just even 
better in their.

52
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,910
You know,
I would say yes,

53
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,130
but have you ever seen Leonard Skinner 
play?

54
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,980
They played free bird and you got to see
what's the guitarist named again?

55
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,410
Leonard scared.
He's such a bad motherfucker.

56
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,933
I should know his name.
I don't know hardly anybody's name and 

57
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,740
Leonard Skinner,
but I love letters.

58
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,583
But um,
there's a video of them in like some 

59
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,260
crazy huge show,
just gigantic audience.

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,000
And this dude is,
he's playing the guitar like performance

61
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,520
art man.
And that,

62
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,140
you know,
that one long solo and freebird,

63
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,230
which to me I maintain is like the 
greatest solo in the history of music.

64
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,890
I mean,
as is up there.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,830
Every results may vary.
Nobody has their own opinion,

66
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,290
but you can start sex and finished sex.
I don't know.

67
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,860
It depends on how your rocket.
I don't rock it.

68
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:42,694
Well man,
I'm going to get mad that I'm bad at 

69
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:45,690
sex.
Yeah,

70
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,230
he,
there he is like in this,

71
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,710
in this fucking gigantic audience full 
of people.

72
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,723
And this is Leonard Skin.
The crazy thing is Leonard skinner came 

73
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,920
out of Florida before people figured out
Florida sucks.

74
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,200
See,
because when I was a kid,

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,450
Florida was cool and if you listen to 
this,

76
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:03,400
you know what the fuck I'm talking about
Florida,

77
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,590
Florida state.
If you listen to this,

78
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,730
you know what I'm saying?
Folks.

79
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,530
I used to live there.
I lived in Gainesville.

80
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,790
Lastly,
lived there for awhile,

81
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,570
but Florida back then nobody had figured
out the Florida socks.

82
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:16,720
It was like Florida is the place to go 
to get away from this fucking winter and

83
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,230
they all go down there and then I'll 
move and then we realized like the dregs

84
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,400
of the Weirdos.

85
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,360
Yeah.
I remember seeing if,

86
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,850
if somebody had a tee shirt,
because I grew up in Louisiana.

87
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,800
If somebody teachers said Florida on it,
dude,

88
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,560
that was when they were somebody you 
know.

89
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,190
Wow.
They made it a thing.

90
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,640
Florida.
Yeah.

91
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,760
Florida to Louisiana looked up to 
Florida.

92
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,953
Oh,
definitely did because Florida had that 

93
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:41,860
coast land had pitches a sunshine on 
their shirt.

94
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,890
That's right.
Sunshine.

95
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,913
Yeah.
That sun or people sitting on like an 

96
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:46,360
umbrella.
You know,

97
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,480
they weren't infested with alligators 
yet either.

98
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,341
I don't think so.
I mean,

99
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,960
we didn't.
We didn't worry about it as much then,

100
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,123
you know,
if you lost somebody to an animal or 

101
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:55,984
something.
Back then I felt like it wasn't as big 

102
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:57,784
of a deal as it is now.
Really in the eighties and nineties if 

103
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,490
you lost somebody to an animal or an 
animal bite,

104
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:06,040
it was more,
you know,

105
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,330
part of God's plan I think.

106
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,180
Whereas now it's like just something 
crazy that happened at Disney world,

107
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,530
you know?
It was like the biggest thing ever.

108
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,371
Yeah.
That little kid.

109
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:16,410
That's pretty fucked up.
God Damn Monster Living at Disneyland.

110
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,210
This is how tolerant people get.
They get so silly.

111
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,320
They're like,
well,

112
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,630
he is here before us.
This is,

113
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:26,530
he's probably a 17 year old alligator 
lives.

114
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,830
This is peaceful environment.
And he made while he ate a baby.

115
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,873
Yeah.
Well you got to be a nasty alligator if 

116
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:36,670
you sit in there and you could.
There's probably been other choices came

117
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:37,211
by,
you know,

118
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,870
that was probably a couple of,
you know,

119
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,130
young lovers that were out there by the 
water earlier and you waited.

120
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,110
You know,
you might not get a young lover though.

121
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,440
A young lover might fight back.
Yeah,

122
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,740
yeah.
There's two of them.

123
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,330
That's true.
I don't know.

124
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,410
Don't worry though.

125
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,150
They're pretty invulnerable and if you 
cut off an alligator's arm,

126
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,440
it just grows back.
That's gangster gangster.

127
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:58,220
As it gets chopped off.
I'll see in a month with a new one.

128
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,560
Dude.
That's the Tupac of the Animal Kingdom.

129
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,783
Really when you think about it,
two fingers full of bullet holes headed 

130
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:07,840
to the ambulance and he's throwing up 
his fingers now.

131
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,210
Gangster alligators that their arms are 
so short and then just so capable.

132
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,044
Man.
I'm sure you've seen the video of that 

133
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:14,174
new one that they found in Florida that 
is on a golf course and it's like 15 

134
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:17,714
feet long.
It's one of the biggest gators were 

135
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,840
filmed and these people are on the golf 
course.

136
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:23,270
They're looking up at this gator.
See if we can find a jamie.

137
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,253
We can't show it on youtube.
You have to find it on youtube because 

138
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,340
we.
I got that gut be pulled off facebook.

139
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,270
There's something happens when you have 
these animal videos in particular,

140
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,910
when they go on facebook,
like people own those videos,

141
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,013
so when they go to look for a,
they have like an algorithm that can 

142
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:41,090
find it and if it's on your page they'll
pull your whole page down.

143
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,850
Yeah,
they own this but so this so many films,

144
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,040
there's a couple different angles of it.
A bunch of people filling because it was

145
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,080
so crazy.
So these people are all playing golf and

146
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,480
they're in the foreground so you could 
see him like,

147
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,323
there it is.
Look at that.

148
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,720
Look at the guy's a real animal and you 
realize how big it is.

149
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:57,554
When you see a guy.
Now Watch how this guy walks in the 

150
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:03,110
foreground and the guy.
When the guy looks Turkish,

151
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,520
a little doesn't.
It looks fake.

152
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,100
It looks fake.
It looks fucking gigantic now.

153
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,880
Now you see how big it is.
Now you understand how big it is because

154
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,990
you see this guy like,
are you?

155
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,990
Are you kidding me?
And they estimated it's somewhere around

156
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:16,640
15 feet.
And did they catch it?

157
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,550
I don't think so man.
They found it again.

158
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,820
They found it again in a pond.
See if he can find it.

159
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,591
Um,
they,

160
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:27,620
they really rediscovered this alligator 
in a pond.

161
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:31,340
I think that was the title of the video.
Maybe they're making a comeback.

162
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:32,174
Dude.
I hope something good comes into tax at 

163
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:33,980
some animal.
Dude.

164
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:34,814
I'm ready for it.

165
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,930
Everybody to fight.
Don't fight alligators,

166
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,490
man.
You don't want to fight them.

167
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,770
Well,
I'll get out there and do something,

168
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:44,210
man.
There's this dude that I have A.

169
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,210
I've had on my podcast before,
but he said his name is Jim shockey.

170
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,373
He's a very famous hunter from Canada 
and they hired him to go to a certain 

171
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:54,920
river in Africa.
I think it was the Congo,

172
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,180
but I'm not sure.
It might have been the Nile.

173
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,550
Anyway,
he had to go.

174
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,310
He went down there to kill some 
crocodiles that were eating people.

175
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,950
It is one of the craziest videos,
man.

176
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,120
You go there and the,
these,

177
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,140
these villagers,
everyone's got to stump where everyone's

178
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,810
missing an arm or a hand or they got a 
chunk bitten out of their chest.

179
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:12,644
It's crazy when you look at these poor 
people and they're all just living in 

180
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:18,110
fear and while he was down there,
a woman got taken.

181
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,093
Oh yeah,
they were up river looking for these 

182
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:25,370
killer crocodiles to try to shoot him 
and one of the women was washing clothes

183
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,200
and she just got yanked right out of the
water.

184
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,620
Maybe the worst,
but it was really scary,

185
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:32,270
man.
He's seeing the laundry.

186
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,403
Oh yeah.
Right.

187
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,943
Underwear.
Seeing the reaction of the people that 

188
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:38,990
were wailing,
just wailing,

189
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,230
crying,
you know,

190
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,440
because it wasn't just like they lost 
someone.

191
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:44,270
It's like God,
they lost another person.

192
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,670
It's like,
that woman's gone now forever.

193
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,450
She was consumed,
consumed by a monster like that.

194
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,900
That is their actual existence.
Damn.

195
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,973
Sitting by a river that they need.
It's water for life and the water is 

196
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:03,150
infested by monsters who are actually 
actively targeting them for food.

197
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,790
Yeah,
it's crazy.

198
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,663
That'd be like if somebody like,
there was a killer in Walmart and they 

199
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,810
just didn't know who or where.

200
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,643
It was constantly like what?
Lions would jump out while you were 

201
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,000
eating at Walmart.
Yeah,

202
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,250
but when you're buying food.
Yeah,

203
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,640
we got it pretty easy,
man.

204
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,240
You know,
those people must be so interesting like

205
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,040
people that live under that kind of 
pressure,

206
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,620
like their view of life and we can 
understand their language.

207
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,960
I bet they have like a,
you know,

208
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:32,961
like you'll listen to like read like 
ancient works of literature,

209
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,350
ancient poetry,
stuff like that.

210
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:37,560
And you think about it like these are 
people that are going through a war,

211
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,720
like the ancient Greeks and the ancient 
Romans.

212
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,550
Like you would read their words,
you go,

213
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:43,470
well this is fascinating.
We know it's being translated.

214
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:46,590
This is the words of someone who's gone 
through like sword war.

215
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,453
Yeah.
Back when they would fight with arrows 

216
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:52,860
and shit and swords and catapults and 
the intensity of life.

217
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,800
Back then when death was just around 
every corner,

218
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,230
it was everywhere.
It must be so,

219
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,160
so intense to talk to someone like that.
You should fly in a pygmy or something.

220
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:03,960
You thought about that?
No,

221
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:04,794
but I have had my friend Justin wren who
has been with the pygmies in the Congo 

222
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:11,700
is for like many,
many years.

223
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,810
He goes and builds wells for them days 
over there for months at a time.

224
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,110
He's had malaria three times.
He's going to come out again soon.

225
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,940
He just texted me.
I got to text him.

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,833
We're going to find a date,
and I used to be in the wishlist and be 

227
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,640
in the well business a little bit.
Not wishing wells,

228
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,990
most of the.
Not Water Wells,

229
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:31,470
but I worked for this.
This is made by a pygmy in the Congo out

230
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:32,304
of a nail.
It's a little knife that justin brought 

231
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:34,090
me.

232
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,890
Wow.
Yeah.

233
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,800
They take these nails and there's one 
over there to see that now,

234
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,540
right there on the desk.
That's what it looks like.

235
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,870
The hammer these nails out and they 
turned them into knives.

236
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,213
See?
That starts out of nail that they find 

237
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,950
way and they pound it down and sharpen 
it and turn it into a knife.

238
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,720
Additive history came back.
If history struck back,

239
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,280
did we would.
I wouldn't make it.

240
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,370
I wouldn't do it.
Make It.

241
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,800
I wouldn't make it long.
Ah,

242
00:10:58,801 --> 00:10:59,850
you'd be fine.
I don't.

243
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,280
I'm not prepared for a bull.
You would be though.

244
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,890
People are adaptable.
You're a smart dude.

245
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:06,120
Thea Yvonne.
I would lead,

246
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,510
I would think a little bit.
I would adapt.

247
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,390
I'd lay low in the beginning.
You know,

248
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,850
like somebody doesn't pick my battles.
Dude.

249
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,713
You'd have to kill somebody immediately.
You have to find the first person in 

250
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:15,504
your group,
the weakest person and kill them in 

251
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,270
front of everybody else.
Yeah.

252
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,710
Like you can't just stand there and be 
like,

253
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,330
yeah,
Duh,

254
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,090
kill some dude.
But think about them and you can't stand

255
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:28,170
there and just be in a comment.
You know,

256
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:30,240
everybody's chatting group huddle and 
everybody's like,

257
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,433
you got to take somebody out right then 
because that's going to show your 

258
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:37,050
dominance of $100 million.
At least going to show like this dude is

259
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,510
gonna do something.
I see.

260
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,580
I see what you're saying.
But I think if you think ahead,

261
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,440
you would think,
well no.

262
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,333
Then they're going to think that he's 
got arbitrarily gonna always kill the 

263
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,420
weakest person.
Eventually it's going to get to know one

264
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,340
because there's going to be.
The next week is person.

265
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,380
That guy is dead now and the next week 
like,

266
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,000
who's to decide whether or not you're 
weak

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,930
or you're not.
We if you were going to do that,

268
00:11:55,931 --> 00:12:00,010
that person would have to be either a 
terrible person who is victimizing other

269
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:04,520
people or they would have to have 
attacked first.

270
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:05,354
We'd have to be or they would have to 
been such a piece of shit that people 

271
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:08,694
are rooting for you.
Like somebody who was real chatty and 

272
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:11,044
you just asked them did.
There's no way I'm trying to survive 

273
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,340
like a,
like a,

274
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,533
you know,
the second coming of the universe and 

275
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:20,200
some dudes chatty in my group,
bro.

276
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,190
That's not.
Especially with like,

277
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,043
he fucks up some hunting parties.
You're out there the sneaking up on a 

278
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,740
pig and he's like,
oh my God,

279
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:27,574
it's so hot out.
You fucking pig runs away and 

280
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,060
everybody's hungry.
Yeah,

281
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,430
he did.
Was He the first man?

282
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,680
I think about that kind of stuff.
Like if a plane crash,

283
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:36,970
I already know I'm planning to head did.

284
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,890
I'd eat a Vietnamese guy.
Why?

285
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,540
Because that's easier to start or move.
If you attack somebody bigger,

286
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,310
you eat somebody bigger in front of 
other people,

287
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:49,060
it's going to alarm people,
but you got to eat a small person,

288
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:49,923
so stature is important.
I think if you've dumbed down a viet 

289
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,590
people aren't gonna be that upset at 
you.

290
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,290
It means people are going to be super 
upset.

291
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,880
What are you talking about,
dad?

292
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,660
Their sacrifice.
They're more understanding of things.

293
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,400
Dude,
is this a character you're playing?

294
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,370
No,
but if you eat a black dude,

295
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,220
you eat a black lady and her family's 
there.

296
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,960
There are going to be pissed.
So you think a Vietnamese person,

297
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:11,794
we'll let you slide.
I think that they'd be much more 

298
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:17,020
forgiving of a couple of day period.
I think a like their relatives.

299
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:18,160
You don't think so?
Honestly.

300
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,570
One thing?
No,

301
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,380
I don't think so.

302
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,120
I definitely think they'd be super 
pissed at you.

303
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,043
Especially modernized ones,
but what is interesting is like Vietnam 

304
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:26,564
was one of the few places where 
Americans can go back to Vietnam and 

305
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:32,110
they don't seem to hold any grudge at 
all.

306
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,740
Exhibit a exhibit a man.
Honestly it will.

307
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,660
Asian people in general are just much 
more forgiving and understanding.

308
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,760
It seems like after like,
I think,

309
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,833
I mean,
I don't have much,

310
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,330
I think,
I think that's a giant generalization.

311
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,730
It probably is,
you know,

312
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,780
I mean,
I did a fast for like four days and then

313
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:53,614
I was at the best buy and um,
and I remember this Vietnamese guy was 

314
00:13:58,181 --> 00:13:59,710
trying to help me out and I couldn't 
even hear him.

315
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:04,450
I was so hungry.
I couldn't ended up fast for four days.

316
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,330
Oh Dude.
Yeah.

317
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:07,300
When you're trying to prove,
I don't know,

318
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,134
man,
I was probably just dealing with some 

319
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,360
stuff and I was just trying to find a 
different way to handle it,

320
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:11,194
you know?

321
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,083
Um,
and then I remember this Vietnamese guy 

322
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,213
and I remember thinking,
if everybody turned the other way for a 

323
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:18,430
second,
I could eat this young fella.

324
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,480
His name was ben actually over here in 
Westwood,

325
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,480
but,
and I'd never thought,

326
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:26,710
God,
it's so ridiculous.

327
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,813
Well,
I mean,

328
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,920
but here's the thing,
I'd never thought that before.

329
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,993
So you only,
you got to the verge of cannibalism 

330
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,990
after just four days.
Yeah.

331
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,920
Damn.
How much weight did you lose?

332
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,110
I probably lost about four pounds and 
pounds.

333
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,750
I needed to know,
but I got clear man.

334
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,030
I could see and I could hear.
Swear to God.

335
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:45,790
Y'All could hear somebody fold a piece 
of bread from 80 feet away,

336
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,600
bro.
I was so hungry dude.

337
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,990
I could hear a fucking skittle hit the 
summit.

338
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,010
Cross the street.
I really

339
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,843
could.
Man.

340
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,050
Do you think that it heightens your 
senses because your,

341
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,993
your hunger was so sharp.
One hundred percent and I could see how 

342
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:58,664
people felt.
I could see how people felt if somebody 

343
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,150
wasn't feeling well,
I could see it man.

344
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,040
Whoa.
Really?

345
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,943
I swear I just,
I think I became much more in tune and 

346
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:10,290
it could've been the hunger that then 
like manifested itself into you,

347
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,443
you know,
wanting to find other ways in a way to 

348
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:15,330
connect with people.
So then maybe you know,

349
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,560
limbically you would think,
oh,

350
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,300
maybe they'll give me food or something.
You know,

351
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,190
if that makes any sense.
It does a little bit.

352
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,100
Well also I wonder if this is pure 
speculation,

353
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,500
but I wonder if it's possible that 
animals,

354
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:30,290
you know,
they say animals have like intense acute

355
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:34,010
sense of smell and we know that their 
vision is fucking spectacular,

356
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:34,880
right?
Like a cat.

357
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,320
Cats have spectacular.
You're like,

358
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,363
I think that they said a wild sheep has 
a vision that's 10 times better than a 

359
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:43,010
human beings.
Like yeah,

360
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:46,400
they have like 10 x binoculars.
Like that's how wild sheep is looking at

361
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:48,830
you all the time to hey turkeys think 
too.

362
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,290
I think Turkey's main might be even 
stronger or turkeys.

363
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,860
Turkeys might even be 20 power.
I got like double,

364
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,700
like a powerful set of binoculars.
You wouldn't expect it looking at him,

365
00:15:58,701 --> 00:15:59,534
you know.
But what else was going to say is I 

366
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:03,500
wonder if they see things that we don't 
detect.

367
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,860
Like I wonder if they could see like an 
actual aura or like it maybe be like you

368
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:10,484
don't just smell different when you're 
scared because they say you smell 

369
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:14,810
different.
They can smell fear and adrenaline.

370
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,640
Like I wonder if they can see things 
too.

371
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,103
Yeah.
Like if they could see your feelings 

372
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:19,304
kind of.
Yeah.

373
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,940
Like Dang,
that guy over there is depressed,

374
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:23,840
you know,
like the guy said,

375
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,890
yeah,
I could either.

376
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,120
That's interesting.
Well,

377
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:27,590
it's interesting then because animals 
are like,

378
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:28,690
you know,
supposed to be like,

379
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:29,524
for some people they're very comforting.
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if 

380
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,880
they have a better sense of sight that 
can then like transcend

381
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,610
just a visual capability.
Shit.

382
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,563
Would it at Jamie just pulled this up.
Some animals are capable of magneto 

383
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:43,154
reception boom,
an added sense that helps them detect 

384
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:47,294
magnetic fields.
European scientists have now learned 

385
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:50,534
that the molecule responsible for this 
trait is also found in the eyes of dogs 

386
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,553
and some primates,
which suggests the two might be capable 

387
00:16:57,471 --> 00:17:01,160
of seeing magnetic fields.
Holy fucking shit.

388
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,890
I knew it did.
Holy Shit.

389
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,280
I knew dogs and primates may be able to 
see magnetic fields.

390
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,800
Now.
This is February 23rd 2016.

391
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,860
So this is a year ago.
So this is all fairly new stuff.

392
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:13,880
Which is funny though.
A year ago,

393
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:14,450
you're like,
God.

394
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,350
So long ago,
dude.

395
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,700
Yeah,
it was new shit.

396
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,460
Now that's a year.
That's amazing.

397
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:23,450
So they might be able to like you,
you know you've heard it or as did you,

398
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,770
do you ever,
do you believe in ours?

399
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,200
What's your feeling on someone who said 
they could see your aura?

400
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,520
Well,
I'm in.

401
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:31,610
I remember one time this lady thought I 
was,

402
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,000
I was at a Vfw,
right?

403
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:33,834
And I was waiting to get a ride home and
this lady said she asked me if I was 

404
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:39,600
like an angel or something and I was 
like,

405
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,560
no.
And she said,

406
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,410
you seem like an angel.
She wants some deck.

407
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,490
She might have wanted some decks.
Sweet Angel.

408
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,180
And she was kind of busted as well,
so that's Kinda bad apple.

409
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,770
But it worked.
You might.

410
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,633
Well thank you ma'am.
I was waiting for someone to come and 

411
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:53,064
say that to me and if they did,
I knew I'd be with them because that's 

412
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:57,900
how it's meant to be as true.
It could have been over here.

413
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:02,901
Angel Swing,
a sweet Dick ran out swing Lulu beer and

414
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,500
feet.
She was going through a tough time.

415
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:10,450
It's all I vaguely remember about her,
but she wasn't very.

416
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,510
She wasn't doing physical fitness?
No.

417
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,763
Do you think that people,
like when you hear someone like an can 

418
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,230
see ours,
what is your automatic assumption?

419
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,300
Bullshit or.
Hm?

420
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,860
Well,
I think some people can get indefinitely

421
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,170
or closer to getting a feeling if 
they're.

422
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,800
If they're pretty clear themselves and 
they are coming from like a neutral,

423
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:32,634
pretty neutral state where they're not 
overwhelmed in their head and that sort 

424
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:35,820
of thing,
then yeah,

425
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:37,980
they might be able to pick up energy is 
pretty much better I think.

426
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,960
Hmm.
You know,

427
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,520
like have you ever had somebody come up 
to you and be like,

428
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,670
you have just like one of those kind of 
a little bit hippy Ish lady.

429
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:46,830
Usually this.
Usually it happens to me.

430
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,990
It's a hippyish woman and she'll be 
like,

431
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,600
you just have the best energy,
you know?

432
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,330
But I always think they're.
They have ulterior motives.

433
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,493
Yeah.
She was trying to get some Dick Theo 

434
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:58,400
Vaughn's another one.
I don't know.

435
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,350
You ladies if I was a Hippie Lady,
you're the kind of guy.

436
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,870
Go for really fucked Ya.
An eight.

437
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,930
An eight.
Yeah.

438
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,900
But you look like you'd be fun for a 
Hippie Lady.

439
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,063
Perfect.
Hippie lady still has good feet even 

440
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:11,910
though she wears sandals all the time.
Yeah,

441
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:12,744
that's true.
No TV fricking but a whole room full of 

442
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:17,760
dream catchers.
I'm out,

443
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:21,450
dude.
He can't treat 'em out.

444
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,220
Dude.
This is where my dream sleep.

445
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,370
Well,
when I get up in the morning,

446
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,100
I say my praise,
my praise to the universe.

447
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,260
And then I checked the dream catcher for
ideas.

448
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,620
What if we caught today?
What's my first thought of the day?

449
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,513
Just emptying out my dream catcher.
She's shaking him into a net and that's 

450
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:40,620
when I knew that I was going to teach 
aqua yoga.

451
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,750
It's my new style of yoga that I've 
created.

452
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:49,970
I hope we were out here in a kitty 
swimming pool or yoga there.

453
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,430
That's La man.
I got involved in orgasmic meditation.

454
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:56,040
You ever done that?
I wish I had.

455
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,430
If you had somebody in about it,
no orgasmic meditation.

456
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,280
Like you meditate as you're coming or 
you meditate until you come up,

457
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,163
will you?
I don't get the man doesn't release any 

458
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:06,384
semen.
The women,

459
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,670
uh,
they find pleasure in it.

460
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,740
Um,
but yeah,

461
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,870
I mean there's a lot of stuff like that 
out here in Los Angeles,

462
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:13,704
you know,
you can get caught up.

463
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,753
I remember this story about this dude 
who was in jail and he had managed to 

464
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,924
seduce one of the female guards.
It was a female guard and just cruise 

465
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:24,120
around her enough and eventually she'll 
let them out or something like that.

466
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:24,954
Something happened.
But this dude could lie in his bed and 

467
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,494
through the power of his mind,
he'd make his dick fully hard without 

468
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:31,584
touching it.
And then he come on himself without 

469
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:35,140
moving.
That's the dark art.

470
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:35,974
Sounds like what I'm saying.
Don't trust somebody that comes without 

471
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:42,480
touching themselves.
It seems a little extreme.

472
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,523
I can understand that.
It could be possible to do that because 

473
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,190
I've had wet dreams,
so if I've had wet dreams,

474
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,233
wet dream is all like you.
Your mind thinks you're actually having 

475
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:55,450
sex and then you ejaculate and then you 
wake up and you fucking idiot.

476
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:57,520
I am.
I came all over myself.

477
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,460
That's,
that's the reality of a wet dream.

478
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:02,530
Right?
So that's all possible through the mind,

479
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,543
so that's possible through the mind.
Why isn't it possible for someone who's 

480
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,993
a really dedicated practitioner of 
meditation to just concentrate entirely 

481
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:14,464
on recreating the sensation of 
pleasurable intercourse to the point 

482
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:18,784
where they ski all over themselves,
excessive while you're staring in the 

483
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:27,010
eyes of the guard,
the prison guard now.

484
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:27,844
That's awesome.
If you can look them in the eyes and do 

485
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:32,350
it and she's looking at you like,
let's just move to Mexico,

486
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:33,010
baby.
Aww.

487
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,090
That's a wizard work,
man.

488
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:34,924
That sounds cool.
And Louis throws documentary where he's 

489
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:37,564
at the prison.
They talk about like trying to come 

490
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:41,350
while they're staring at the prison 
guard in the eyes and it's like,

491
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:43,990
that's not sexual abuse or something 
like that.

492
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,200
And I'm talking about.
Did you see that?

493
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,031
Yeah,
that's right,

494
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:46,950
right.
Yeah.

495
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,770
I try to do it to try to get them to 
pass by.

496
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,410
They tried to ejaculate on them too,
I think.

497
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,273
Yeah,
I think so.

498
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,150
Well that was in silence of the lambs 
number.

499
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

500
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,750
Actually saw up,
ran into that guy the other day.

501
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,730
Anthony Hopkins.
Dude,

502
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,480
remember the guy next to Anthony Hopkins
Migs,

503
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,750
he uh,
came,

504
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,060
came in his hand and threw it in Jodie 
foster's face.

505
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,830
Yeah.
What happened to him?

506
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,230
That was his one moment.
That was this big moment,

507
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,770
a big moment that I did.
Dude,

508
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:18,460
come home and in a movie that's a 
fricking old,

509
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,110
that's old fashioned.
Did our big thing.

510
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:22,600
Used to be the jerk off of the bus 
window when I was growing up.

511
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,210
But it's a weird thing to want to come 
on somebody like,

512
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,770
like,
like as they're coming here,

513
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:27,860
they come here,
they come here,

514
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,910
they got ya.

515
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,690
And see right there he throws it at her.
I think it seems old fashioned to me,

516
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,470
kinda seemed like an old fashioned game,
you know,

517
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,363
it's a barbaric game,
but it makes sense that prisoners would 

518
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:40,210
do that.
But how crazy is that?

519
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:44,140
Like he got his cum on her face and 
she's probably haunted by that forever.

520
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,853
Obviously it's not a real person.
It didn't really happen and it probably 

521
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,154
was just like frosting.
If you were in prison or some sort of a 

522
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,503
deal like that,
do you think you did advance into 

523
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:56,320
homosexuality or not?
Honestly,

524
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,390
honestly I think a lot of people do.
I think you'd have to really consider if

525
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:03,160
you're going to be locked in there for 
the rest of your life,

526
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,940
whether or not you were cool with 
fucking dudes or no pleasure.

527
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,090
Now what if you had like one appeal but 
it was like 25,

528
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,910
like an appeal trial and it was 25 years
later.

529
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,763
Like that's kind of the risk,
you know like how many years will some 

530
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:18,634
dudes would get.
They rationalize it like in like gang 

531
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,330
banger communities.
They call it gay for the stay.

532
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,193
Yeah.
And they would go and they would just 

533
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,930
get gay soon as they get in jail and 
then they get out of jail.

534
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:29,764
They try not to be gay.
That was in that movie American me and 

535
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,450
obviously I have no idea how,
how accurate that was,

536
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:35,284
but that's been discussed before.
But I think Edward James Almost when he 

537
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:40,564
did that movie,
I think he kinda got in trouble with 

538
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:43,294
some gang bangers who were particularly 
upset about the way he portrayed her 

539
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,040
while in prison life in there.
And they're like,

540
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:49,874
you know,
they were upset at them about the 

541
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,210
alarming the.
They'll be quite terrifying.

542
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,290
I mean,
alarming group Tub.

543
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:58,640
Set the wrong group to upset because 
they have like drug induced gays.

544
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,780
I remember.
Hello.

545
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,780
Bye.
Is that real?

546
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,970
Yeah.
The rug induced.

547
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:06,440
They can,
they can get you with the drug.

548
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,251
No,
no,

549
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:08,720
no.
Like if you like,

550
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:09,554
I remember they had like a,
I mean there's popular culture in the 

551
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,990
eighties and nineties where they had 
like behind the rest areas,

552
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,350
a lot of men would meet up and um,
you know,

553
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,780
do drugs and find pleasure with each 
other back there,

554
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:19,190
you know,
rest areas,

555
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,690
rest stops on highways.
Yeah.

556
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:22,230
Rest stops off the interstate.
Um,

557
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,730
you know,
usually like a seaman building,

558
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,220
couple of water fountain where it is.
It was a party stopped back in the day.

559
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,880
You when you want to rest like you 
tired.

560
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:32,714
Yeah.
Fuck,

561
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,553
that's a long drive.
I'm just gonna pull in here and take a 

562
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,410
nap.
We leave this window open.

563
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,900
Some do reaches in and grabs your Dick.
Like,

564
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:39,734
Hey,
I'm just trying to sleep at all and 

565
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,880
everybody comes here to fuck.

566
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,120
No,
this is the desktop.

567
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,443
We used to walk.
We used to go see it because I lived 

568
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,334
across from this river and the other 
side of the river was the back of the 

569
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:51,794
rest area.
I know a lot of me back there partying 

570
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:54,710
and you smell it.
No,

571
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,780
you couldn't smell it.
It was fun.

572
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,370
It's like a dog chasing a dog could 
smell it because he dogs would be like,

573
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,730
I think a Turkey could see it fucking 
going on somewhere within this five mile

574
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:11,561
radius for sure.
If you can smell skunk a block away,

575
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,650
a dog.
It's Muslim,

576
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,100
but fucking away from your house to that
rest stop.

577
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:19,820
One hundred percent guaranteed.
Like if that rest stop was like a,

578
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:23,450
a fucking escapee from prison and they 
gave him the shirt,

579
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,261
smell it,
smell it,

580
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:25,130
buddy.
Go get him.

581
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,900
You.
It smelled that bud fucking,

582
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,820
you know they were there.

583
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,233
Maybe.
I wonder if we could get heightened 

584
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:31,034
senses in the future.
Maybe that's one of the things that's 

585
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:33,110
coming next.
You know?

586
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,180
I would imagine we're gearing towards 
it.

587
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,950
It feels like maybe naturally our senses
might be getting dollar.

588
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,870
Yeah,
because I think we don't use them.

589
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,220
We don't use them for danger.
We don't use them to stock pray.

590
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,370
We don't use them to run from something.
We just don't.

591
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:50,204
We don't use them,
so I think they're getting weaker and 

592
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,840
weaker when the are thumbs up.
Thumbs need to move fast.

593
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:54,674
Now I bet we have the fastest thumbs.
Have any fucking living being that's 

594
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,360
ever existed.
I mean to look back at people like thumb

595
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:02,720
dexterity now compared to today.
Oh I bet people can do.

596
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:05,120
I bet if I did this to some,
some people in the 18 hundreds,

597
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,163
they would go like,
you will learn to move your thumbs with 

598
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:09,530
such speed.

599
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,393
Come and see the mind.
If you showed somebody an iphone back 

600
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:15,220
then and just texted a message on it and
you're like,

601
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:15,830
here,
just text.

602
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,663
Text your name on there.
They but they would be so slow and 

603
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:22,004
stupid,
but you're flying through your phone 

604
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,480
phones.
We'll get your fingers will get quicker.

605
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,273
Hearing will probably stay the same.
No need for it to get any better 

606
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,243
hearing.
Your body's going to shrink shrivel 

607
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:33,980
away.
Bones,

608
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,823
muscles.
We're going to become like little 

609
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:36,690
aliens.
The aliens,

610
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,630
the big heads.
A little bodies will be in carts.

611
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,740
Will be in some type of a cartoon.
Yeah.

612
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,960
It's like an old fashion.
Look at Tesla will.

613
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,720
We'll have individual teslas that are 
like eggs and surround you and you can't

614
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:50,880
even steer and they just drive you to 
work,

615
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,043
drive you where you want to go.
You just talked to and it takes you 

616
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:54,084
somewhere.

617
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,650
But we will.
Will we still have sex?

618
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:58,350
We'll have to have some sort of a of a,
of a union,

619
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,780
but it'll probably be done in a lab.
I don't think they'll do sex anymore.

620
00:27:00,781 --> 00:27:02,100
You know?
That's kind of happen one day.

621
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,300
Yeah,
I think you're right.

622
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,343
I think you're right.
I think one day they'll make the people 

623
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:06,751
decided,
look,

624
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,880
we have sex for pleasure and you know,
we'll,

625
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,970
we'll still do that.
And we'll meet in the meeting,

626
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:16,380
will be done in a laboratory because it 
ensures 100 percent excellent DNA,

627
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,900
healthy children.
You can factor out racism,

628
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,673
you know,
you could,

629
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,020
you could probably do things to your 
kid.

630
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,270
Like I want my kid to be a seven foot 
tall,

631
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,920
you know,
pro lineman.

632
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,400
I want them to grow up to be 440 pounds 
lighter.

633
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,310
All right,
there you go.

634
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,300
Done.
And they fix it.

635
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,800
Yeah.
If that happens,

636
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:32,634
man,
people are not going to just take a 

637
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:35,580
chance with regular sex and having 
regular kid.

638
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,070
So they're going to produce these super 
babies.

639
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,560
So slowly but surely it'll start out 
like cell phones were.

640
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,560
Remember when Gordon Gecko was walking 
down the beach,

641
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,940
that big ass brick and nobody would be 
caught dead with today.

642
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,323
It would be just like that.
We'll start off with those stupid 

643
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:48,534
bricks.
It only rich people have and that 

644
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:51,240
eventually that break will be a fucking 
joke.

645
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,640
And everybody,
it's going to be easy to pay.

646
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,500
It'll be just like everything else.
Do you get your kid vaccinated?

647
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,380
Yes.
Did you pick what your kid's gonna be?

648
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,490
Yeah.
Yeah,

649
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,910
I made a fucking Amazon woman,
they can kill people with their legs and

650
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,050
some people would still be like,
well,

651
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,570
we went the old fashioned way,
you know,

652
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,350
we were deciding not to choose.

653
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,480
We're going to leave it up to the 
universe.

654
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,340
What if your kid is born with some sort 
of an ailment?

655
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,040
You'd be so heartbroken.
I'd go big Asian Dude.

656
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,410
I'd go four or five.
Six huge Asian sons,

657
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,870
nine feet tall.
Nine feet to loggers.

658
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,450
Wow.
The loggers browse more than a logger.

659
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,070
How long do you think they would last 
though?

660
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,930
Like how long do you live if you're nine
feet tall?

661
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:26,040
Not,
not a whole long.

662
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,600
Eight or nine years old.
I bet you know what I'm saying.

663
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,960
Who is the biggest guy?
The biggest guy knew growing up,

664
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:37,200
this kid named Ricardo,
he died at like 14 or 12.

665
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:38,640
He died at 12.
He had a heart attack.

666
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,563
How big was it?
Playing basketball and he's probably 

667
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:41,760
about 65.
Wow.

668
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,410
He was huge.
He was that age.

669
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:44,244
He had a hard time,
had a heart attack in the basketball 

670
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:45,600
game.

671
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,030
Hold on Shit.
And do remember len bias.

672
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,710
Remember that guy who was playing for 
the Celtics,

673
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:51,420
he dropped dead in the middle of a game.
Well,

674
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:52,530
yeah,
and he hits some cocaine.

675
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:56,760
Didn't he?
Donate doom.

676
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,170
Doom.
Wow.

677
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,810
That is the tallest guy ever.
Robert Wadlow.

678
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,400
He was eight feet 11 inches.
So he's essentially nine feet tall.

679
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,323
I mean he probably had a fucked up 
posture to like his body looks like it 

680
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:10,554
was all wrecked with arthritis and shit.
His joints must have been just 

681
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,030
completely fucked up.
I bake.

682
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,850
Took a whole family out with his leg 
though.

683
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:18,780
It was.
Well,

684
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:22,290
you would be able to escape his triangle
because his legs are so long.

685
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,940
They wouldn't be able to squeeze down 
enough.

686
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,860
He could decorate his legs for 
Christmas.

687
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:28,500
I bet it would be trying to triangle a 
squirrel.

688
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,700
Like good luck.
Tronic Triangle Square Squirrel.

689
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:32,280
The little motherfuckers gonna escape.

690
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,713
He's getting too much room and his legs.
You'll pop your head right out of there 

691
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:38,760
and take side control.
But wouldn't you be scared to like.

692
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,590
I feel like some of these athletes,
they got to be scared.

693
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:41,424
They're going to die a lot.
Like you think that's a fear that kind 

694
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:46,990
of lives in their head because because 
of they're so big and immense.

695
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,863
Yeah.
Larry Bird was actually talking about 

696
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:51,460
that recently because Larry Byrd is.
I think he's six foot nine.

697
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,480
Wow.
And his wife was real bummed out about.

698
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,333
I'm saying it because I'm saying that no
one over seven feet tall ever lives to 

699
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:02,260
be like 75 years old.
They just don't live that long.

700
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:04,180
You don't see those guys walking around 
with that age.

701
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,590
And it's true.
It's real sad.

702
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,560
Know had to do something about that.
And we need light for the tall,

703
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,910
not a charity.

704
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,960
You know what it is,
man.

705
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,790
It's just this weird fucking give and 
take to this universe.

706
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,640
And if you have this massive advantage 
in size,

707
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:20,550
your ride is quicker.
You know?

708
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,560
It's almost like having a muscle car 
with a small gas tank.

709
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,920
This is what you get.
You want that 600 horsepower shelby gt,

710
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:28,990
500.
Well you get this with.

711
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,940
You got a 10 gallon gas tank.
So good luck.

712
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,450
Yeah.
You know I had a ford escort back in the

713
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:34,601
day,
man.

714
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,160
You ever drive an escort?
Bill?

715
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:37,450
Russell's still alive.
80 three.

716
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,090
Holy Shit.
That's amazing.

717
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:41,980
Somebody send that to Larry Bird,
but he's black.

718
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:43,990
Black people have better genetics.

719
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,943
Um,
no,

720
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,760
no.
They have just as many problems.

721
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:51,250
I'm joking around,
but black definitely doesn't crack.

722
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,560
It's definitely a better skin for aging 
for sure.

723
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,330
It's sugars a little bit.
It doesn't crack.

724
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,540
You know,
Larry Bird,

725
00:30:58,541 --> 00:30:59,374
someone get him that quickly I think.
I think it's more likely today that a 

726
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,863
giant people like that will live longer 
because they're just so good with 

727
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:08,194
medicine and health and so much 
understanding about how to take care of 

728
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:11,854
yourself.
Yeah.

729
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,170
But I bet back in the day was like a 
real problem.

730
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:15,004
You know,
the heart attack is a real issue I 

731
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:17,810
guess.
Just so much travel.

732
00:31:17,811 --> 00:31:22,060
The blood has to go through and imagine 
like if you're seven feet tall,

733
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,450
all the extra real estate your heart has
to pump through.

734
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,010
You know,
even thought about that.

735
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,680
Yeah,
I mean in that sense,

736
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,783
you got to think like you're,
you're on borrowed time once you're 

737
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:33,670
hitting your sixties.

738
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,620
It's like,
oof.

739
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,400
Anything can happen from here on out.
Man,

740
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:38,770
you got a heart,
like a regular heart.

741
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,450
Yeah,
but you've got a giant body.

742
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,713
You had a crazy body.
Their heart's got to be bigger than a 

743
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:45,300
normal person's there.
Big.

744
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,750
Everything's bigger.
Their feet are bigger.

745
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,880
Hands are bigger.
I would assume their head's bigger.

746
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:51,400
Their heart's got to be bigger to right.
I would guess,

747
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:52,810
man,
I got the heart of the lesbian.

748
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,690
That's what they told me that I was 
young and I got a small rib cage to.

749
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,480
Don't they say your heart is the same 
size of your fist or is that bullshit?

750
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,640
Is that real?
They tell you when you're a kid.

751
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:03,700
I don't know if it's real though.
Brock Lesnar and a giant fucking heart.

752
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,040
He's a big fist.
Giant dude.

753
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,590
Huge,
ridiculous lunchboxes.

754
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,860
Big Old lunchboxes.
Is it scary when you meet him?

755
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:13,780
He's just so big.
It doesn't even.

756
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,010
You don't even feel like you're the same
thing.

757
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:15,550
Like,
wow,

758
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,700
how are you and I both people the fuck 
is that possible?

759
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,623
It's like you ever see like a poodle 
meet like a great Dane and the great 

760
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:23,470
thing is like the fuck is this.
Who was like,

761
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:26,280
what the fuck is that?
The same thing.

762
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,370
It's hard to believe,
you know,

763
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,990
a while.
Then the really freaky Ufo people,

764
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,913
they believe that that's proof positive 
that human beings were genetically 

765
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,090
engineered the same way dogs were,
because you know,

766
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,973
nobody knows where dogs came from.
We know the dogs came from wolves 

767
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:42,104
because they do genetic tests on these 
dogs and they realized that all dogs 

768
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:46,070
started off as a wolf.
All of them,

769
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:48,710
and this is like really recently,
they realize that dogs did.

770
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,760
Yeah.
All dogs.

771
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,770
Wawa,
even a Chihuahua.

772
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,233
That part I don't.
I wouldn't either except for these 

773
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:59,060
scientists.
Dudes have already done the DNA work.

774
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,710
You got to respect what they came up 
with,

775
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:01,544
I guess,
but what they thought was at one point 

776
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:04,940
in time they thought it was a bunch of 
wild canids.

777
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,803
Like all of them were like,
they thought like some dogs were from 

778
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:09,884
this wild dog,
from Africa and some dogs maybe came 

779
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:13,880
from wolves,
like a Husky that looks like a wolf,

780
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:14,780
right?
Nope.

781
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,520
Once they did the DNA,
they realize,

782
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:17,570
oh my God,
they're all wolves.

783
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,490
It's the wolf.
Everything's a wolf.

784
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,680
Then what happened then?
How did some of them get done?

785
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,100
We don't know.
We really don't know Sean.

786
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,950
Good question.
They know that they can do some things.

787
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:30,440
There was a great article,
not article,

788
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:34,490
excuse me,
episode of Radio Lab,

789
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,450
which is an amazing guy,
great podcast.

790
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,340
It's really good man,
and they had a really good one on Fox.

791
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,060
Says it was part of the episode,
but it was about engineering animals and

792
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:48,980
about engineering evolution and how long
you could change genes,

793
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,350
how long it would take,
and they took these foxes.

794
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:54,410
They took them from Wild Fox is like a 
completely wild.

795
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,580
Yeah.
Were you know,

796
00:33:55,581 --> 00:34:00,581
they were just in a regular Fox and by 
selectively breeding them,

797
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,270
just selectively breeding them.
They had them down to this floppy eared,

798
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:06,860
weird,
docile,

799
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,920
like pet fox thing.
Just a few generations,

800
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,933
like just a few years.
They just did these experiments for a 

801
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,160
few years and then eventually got these 
animals down to.

802
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,560
They were like almost unrecognizable 
from a Fox.

803
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,020
Their jaws were smaller that yours were 
floppy.

804
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,950
They became like a different thing.
Is that going to.

805
00:34:22,951 --> 00:34:26,480
It took while to make them domestic hit 
enough were to create a market.

806
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,170
I think they were doing that may be,
but they were definitely also writing it

807
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:33,290
down as experiments that we're trying to
figure out how long it would take.

808
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,110
I don't totally remember the premise for
the experiment,

809
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,033
like why they decided to do it,
but I remember the results and the 

810
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,244
results were they would take any,
any of these foxes that showed any 

811
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:43,784
aggression towards people,
any of them that weren't like instantly 

812
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,290
submissive.
They would shoot him,

813
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,583
kill him,
and then the ones that were submitted 

814
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:51,070
them,
they.

815
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:51,903
They lived,
so the ones that lived with the ones 

816
00:34:54,171 --> 00:34:56,360
that were the most timid and the most 
submissive,

817
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:59,720
and they started getting these floppy 
ears like their ears instead of sticking

818
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:02,570
straight up.
They started flopping and their jaws got

819
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:04,550
smaller,
like the whole thing changed.

820
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:07,240
I think they've changed color to like 
what's happening,

821
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,400
like what's happening in America,
kind of a little bit,

822
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:10,430
little bit,
little bit.

823
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,280
Well,
that's what these UFO freaks believe.

824
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,353
They believe that.
That's proof positive that aliens came 

825
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:19,190
down and grabbed some monkeys,
like has a monkey become a human.

826
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,890
We look.
You could see a person,

827
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,690
you see chimpanzee and you go,
okay,

828
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:25,850
I kind of see where that could have gone
into that.

829
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,713
Yeah,
I don't buy it,

830
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,680
but where's all the stuff in the middle?
Yeah,

831
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,543
we're the middle monkeys as well.
How come we're udall understand 

832
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:32,630
genetics.
You're right.

833
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,230
I don't,
but I'm just saying it.

834
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,073
It is odd.
I'm not saying we didn't come from 

835
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:39,540
humans from chimpanzees.
Of course we did.

836
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,690
Or from lower primate.
That's a cousin to the chimpanzee really

837
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:43,524
early in the Middle Lane.
I think there could've been a middleman 

838
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,890
whether it was for sure,
but those.

839
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,760
Those all died off and that kind of 
makes sense,

840
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,650
but it is totally fascinating that we're
so far ahead of everything else.

841
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,860
My point is when you look at a human,
there's nothing remotely like us.

842
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,360
It's not like a giraffe is similar to a 
deer.

843
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,600
A deer is the intellectual equivalent of
a horse,

844
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,230
you know?
No,

845
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,340
there's none of that,
man.

846
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,293
There's this one thing,
this one thing that has the weirdest 

847
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:12,870
hair,
like,

848
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,733
like,
uh,

849
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,950
your face doesn't have hair except for 
like this part.

850
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,500
It's an anomaly.
Your body only has like a little like,

851
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:20,550
what?
Where's that hair?

852
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:22,320
What's the hair for?
Is it leftover?

853
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,510
Is this,
you look like a mixture of some shit.

854
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,320
He was like one of those hairless cats 
who did this to you?

855
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,470
How did they make this out of you?
And people think aliens took us.

856
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,720
It took monkeys and came back with us.
That's what they think it will make.

857
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,740
If you look at Shaquille o'neal and then
you look at like Brittany Spears,

858
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,560
clearly they look very different.

859
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,560
They're the same species.
They could easily interbreed just like a

860
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:44,394
wolf could easily have sex with a 
bulldog because they're really all 

861
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:50,400
wolves,
which is so hard to believe.

862
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,150
Like if you didn't know species,
if you came here,

863
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:58,110
you were some fucking ball of plasma 
from another dimension and you came here

864
00:36:58,111 --> 00:37:00,840
to study.
There's not a fucking chance in hell.

865
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,793
You would think that Brittany Spears was
the same thing as Shaquille o'neal or 

866
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:05,844
me.
That I was the same thing as Shaquille 

867
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:09,050
o'neal or you know,
look,

868
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,933
look at anyone,
like I'm a fucking molly ringwald and 

869
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:17,280
then put her next to Mike Tyson.
How is that the same?

870
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,950
How is it the same thing,
but it's all the same thing.

871
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,060
You have the Anthony Lyn,
the,

872
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,050
the Chinese basketball player that got 
famous for awhile.

873
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,341
Jeremy Lin?
Yes.

874
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:27,174
Jeremy Lin.
That's right.

875
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,270
Sorry.
Put.

876
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,610
There you go.
Look at Shaquille o'neal.

877
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,730
He's enormous.
He's so big.

878
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:35,070
It doesn't even make sense.
Look at his pants too,

879
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:37,920
man.
But you see if you saw him and we'll pay

880
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,550
next to like a very small Asian guy.
Like maybe the one that you tried to eat

881
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,720
at the store.
Ben was his name actually.

882
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:46,020
Then if you saw him next to Ben,
you would say,

883
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:46,854
okay,
if you came from another planet and you 

884
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:50,810
saw a chimpanzee next to an orangutan,
you would like,

885
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,370
well those are different species,
right?

886
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,600
This is clearly two different things,
but they're not.

887
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,120
They're not.
Well,

888
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,010
those are chimpanzees.
Orangutans aren't,

889
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,570
but people aren't.
Yeah.

890
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,410
The same thing.
We're so weird.

891
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:05,250
It's so weird that we can like,
we look so different from each other,

892
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,200
but we all breed with each other just 
like dogs do.

893
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,093
I'm amazed that monkeys don't like,
here's what I don't think that we 

894
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:11,400
evolved from monkeys because.

895
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,500
Because monkeys never come visit us.
Know what I'm saying though?

896
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,390
Oh yeah.
Do you make it a lot of sense?

897
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,160
Like we go visit them though.
Think about this.

898
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:23,190
We go visit them at the zoo.
We're out in the nature Malaysia,

899
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,830
but they never went.
Have you ever like,

900
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:26,664
I'm it.
But when you open your window up and 

901
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:30,000
seen a couple of monkeys just seeing,
you know,

902
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,893
hey,
what's up?

903
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,180
What could have been if they had gotten 
their act together?

904
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:33,931
Man,
yeah.

905
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:34,764
They will be like,
look at these motherfuckers in their 

906
00:38:35,351 --> 00:38:36,490
car,
but they never do it.

907
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,280
They,
they show pretty much zero interest when

908
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,940
we pass by and that seems striking to me
if,

909
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:44,770
if we're the top grade of that species,
dude,

910
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,620
I'm a peek over and see what's going on.
You know when I see shack,

911
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:48,454
I go watch shack.
I paid to go watch him because he's the 

912
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:51,880
best of,
you know,

913
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:53,440
have a physical space,
you know,

914
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:55,870
maybe have,
have part of our breed of humanity.

915
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,943
Well,
there's people that go to brock Lesnar 

916
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,013
just to watch and pick a man over his 
head and slam them down on the ground 

917
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,113
because they'd see him hoists some 300 
pound dude over his head and you're 

918
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:07,480
like,
what in the fuck?

919
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,620
Like,
how is that guy?

920
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:11,200
The same thing as me,
but if I'm getting my associate's degree

921
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,050
does not 700 monkeys in the woods.
Like freaking out.

922
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,060
Like I can't believe they did it.
Yeah,

923
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,100
man,
this is like an inspirational movie.

924
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,470
Maybe the whole human experience is an 
inspirational movie.

925
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:21,340
The monkeys.
Yeah.

926
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,463
You know,
they're like looking at us and like 

927
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,670
maybe one day,
Nah,

928
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:27,450
let's just eat these coconuts.
I don't know man.

929
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,870
I just don't know if they know,
like,

930
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,060
I don't know.
That's where I really fall apart is when

931
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:33,070
they don't care as much as we do.
Well,

932
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,950
if you go to Costa Rica,
they care around you all the time.

933
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,080
You go to a stay at a hotel in Costa 
Rica,

934
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:39,760
they always hang around hotels because 
people would go,

935
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:40,630
oh my God,
the monkey,

936
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,700
and they feed them and is how much to 
feed them.

937
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,540
We gave a monkey some oreos like oreo 
cookies and we were like,

938
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:48,130
debating,
should we give this monkey oreos?

939
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,143
I'm like,
it's going to be like crack for that 

940
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,330
monkey.
Like that amount of sugar.

941
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,040
What do you think eats on amount of 
sugar,

942
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,090
and then I thought about.
I'm like,

943
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,820
I bet that fucking monkey eats oreos all
the time.

944
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,320
I go,
it's just keeping one oreo.

945
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,183
You don't.
We did.

946
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,400
He take the Oreo and he twisted it 
opened.

947
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,243
They start eating the frosting.
That motherfucker had gotten so many 

948
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:06,664
oreos.
He knows how to eat the frosting like 

949
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:10,330
the party.
Did you do that when you're a kid?

950
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,180
Twisted Tyler,
and then you scrape it with your teeth?

951
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,130
We see frosting and then you would 
reluctantly eat the cookie like that.

952
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,950
Hasn't had a little frosting on it 
first,

953
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,980
but the half that have more frosting on 
it for us.

954
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,790
Exactly.
I miss that,

955
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:25,624
man.
I would love to have the trails of a 

956
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:28,260
child,
but whatever.

957
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,341
I mean,
not like a,

958
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:31,174
you know,
I know what you mean because you just 

959
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,270
have system with child.
Think about that.

960
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:35,104
I remember eating a.
me and my buddies split a 90 pack of 

961
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,590
Vanilla cremes one night.
Wow.

962
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,180
Wait the whole thing.
Just 45 cookies up there.

963
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,700
So insane.
That's so many cookies.

964
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,720
No issue.
We will up in the morning.

965
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,590
Headache,
nausea,

966
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,890
diarrhea.
No monkeys at the window.

967
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,290
Nothing.
The thing is,

968
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,610
you're not aware of what it's doing to 
you either.

969
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,220
So your kid doesn't understand.
Why do I feel like shit?

970
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,780
They don't like directly put it 
together.

971
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,410
What?
You just ate a tub of ice cream.

972
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,850
Fuck.
You can't just eat a tub of ice cream.

973
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,090
That's like 50,000 milligrams of sugar 
or some shit.

974
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,470
Kids are nuts,
man.

975
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:11,590
I think we got to lower some of these 
regulations on a lot of these children.

976
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:12,940
You know?
Um,

977
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,940
just to be firm up a little bit,
a lot of these kids are a lot weaker.

978
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:17,260
I feel like they,
when I was a child,

979
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,540
what kind of regulations are you talking
about?

980
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,380
Regulation to beef them up.
I mean,

981
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,190
I just think,
you know,

982
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:27,550
younger driving age is younger drinking.
They just things that are going to get,

983
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,290
you know,
more experienced.

984
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:30,220
I feel like,
you know,

985
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,503
well that the problem with the younger 
driving age is they're gonna put us in 

986
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:38,900
danger like I think even the age it is 
right now.

987
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,870
Fifteen and 16.
That's a little sketchy for some kids.

988
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,350
It was definitely sketchy for me.
It was a shitty day.

989
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,280
I got a lot of accidents,
but I was like 15,

990
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:48,540
16,
definitely shouldn't have been driving.

991
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:51,020
It was too crazy.
Where were you driving in cars?

992
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,580
I always had muscle.
You were that guy you selling drugs or.

993
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,830
No,
I have a 19,

994
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:55,491
68,
four,

995
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:55,891
four,
two.

996
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:57,710
A wrapped around a tree right in front 
of the high school.

997
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,590
Hydroplaned man had bald tires and it 
was.

998
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:02,870
The water was wet and we were going 
around this corner.

999
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,310
My car just just said,
Ooh,

1000
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:06,260
we're going to slide.
Did everybody see?

1001
00:42:06,261 --> 00:42:08,240
You know,
they found my car afterwards,

1002
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:11,720
so smashed my car in half,
like cracked the frame and shit.

1003
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,570
You remember the first time you ever 
drove off in your car?

1004
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:15,404
The feeling you had,
like the first time you ever pulled off 

1005
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:18,620
in your vehicle by yourself?

1006
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,520
Yeah.
Crazy.

1007
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,253
Well,
I just think I was an irresponsible 

1008
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,710
driver because I was,
I was,

1009
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,380
I was going pedal to the metal with 
everything.

1010
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,333
Yeah,
like whether it was a car or there was 

1011
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:31,940
fighting,
like what is.

1012
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,580
That was what I was competing in martial
arts too.

1013
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,550
It was like I was crazy.
Like you can't,

1014
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,010
there's no way a kid who's 16 years old 
who just started driving,

1015
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,470
she'd be able to get a 400 horsepower 
muscle cars.

1016
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,960
Much insane.
Too much power.

1017
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,120
I had to,
I had no maturity.

1018
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,983
You know,
I just,

1019
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,163
I grew up for a broken family,
so it's like all this anger issues and 

1020
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:53,840
weird chill.
You can't give someone like that.

1021
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:55,910
A muscle car.
Did you have to have some discipline?

1022
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:58,410
Did you know that you like were pedal to
the metal like that?

1023
00:42:58,411 --> 00:42:59,244
Did you like,
did you realize it in relation to other 

1024
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,850
kids or were you just being yourself?

1025
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,900
Is.
It was just being myself,

1026
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:03,734
I didn't realize how crazy I was.
I've definitely felt uncomfortable 

1027
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:08,180
around other kids sometimes.
You know,

1028
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:10,670
we moved a lot around a lot though.
It was attributed to that.

1029
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,500
We'd never looked in one place at one 
time.

1030
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,630
You know?
I just think in general,

1031
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:18,800
teenage boys are really risky for a lot 
of things.

1032
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:22,190
Like my buddy was talking to me about 
this the other day.

1033
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:23,690
My Buddy Eric Chris,
he was like,

1034
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,640
they're the most dangerous thing in our 
societies,

1035
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,460
teenage boys and I never thought about 
it,

1036
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:31,490
but he's kind of like a teenage daughter
at the time.

1037
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:32,324
She seen edge and we were talking about 
it and he was like the most dangerous 

1038
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:36,050
thing in our society,
and I thought about it.

1039
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:36,441
I was like,
yeah,

1040
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:39,590
you don't want it is because they're,
they have manpower,

1041
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,573
laboy brains and their brain,
your frontal lobe doesn't even fully 

1042
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:46,730
developed until you're like 25.

1043
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,653
Wow.
Your total ability to process thoughts 

1044
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:52,350
correctly.
It's not like fully functional until you

1045
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:53,960
look 25.
That's the middle of it.

1046
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:56,150
Maybe that's the middle monkey joe to be
on.

1047
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,993
You know what I'm saying?
Like maybe that kind of maybe like 

1048
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,583
that's why that whole species died off 
if they were here because they were all 

1049
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:04,520
like teenage boys.
They had the boy brain,

1050
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:09,521
but the man body will let chimps.
Chimps are like horrible people.

1051
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,110
That's what they're like.
That is super strong.

1052
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,750
They're strong.
It's like a 500 pound person and they're

1053
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:15,770
horrible,
mean,

1054
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:17,300
vindictive,
jealous people.

1055
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:18,500
Are they?
Oh yeah.

1056
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:19,334
Yeah.
I didn't even know that chimps punish 

1057
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:24,170
each other too.
They punish people to God.

1058
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,000
They don't just try to hurt you.
They try to punish you.

1059
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:28,700
They try to take your fingers away,
take your genitals away.

1060
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,410
It literally pull your genitals off and 
attack you.

1061
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,570
What did they learn that or I wonder if 
they're smart.

1062
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,120
They're super smart.
They're not as smart as a person,

1063
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,610
but they're way smarter than a chicken.
Yeah,

1064
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,211
they're,
they're.

1065
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:40,044
They're thinking and looking at you and 
when you're doing something that they 

1066
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:44,910
don't like.
The guy that got really torn apart,

1067
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:45,744
it was a terrible story,
ripped his face off and tore his eyes 

1068
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:48,900
out and shit.
Um,

1069
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:52,800
it was his pet.
He was going to see how to pet chimp and

1070
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:53,634
after a while with champs,
one of something will happen at temple 

1071
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,590
snap on somebody like you remember that?
Chimp fucked up.

1072
00:44:58,591 --> 00:44:59,424
That lady's friend in Connecticut.
She had a pet chimp at tore this lady 

1073
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,100
apart.
When the police.

1074
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,080
I know a lady,
a panther killed her cousin one time,

1075
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,840
but this chip.
But the chip thing is crazy because this

1076
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:10,674
guy had a pet chimp,
but then it's chipped bit someone's 

1077
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:13,080
finger off.

1078
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,760
So they really couldn't keep the 
chimpanzee morning.

1079
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:15,594
They brought it to a chimp sanctuary.
So as they had this chimp at the chimp 

1080
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:18,664
sanctuary,
these other people had brought chimps 

1081
00:45:21,331 --> 00:45:22,164
there.
And it was like this whole like 

1082
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,753
enclosure where all the chimps were.
And he gave his champ a birthday cake 

1083
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,910
because it was champs birth and Kim to 
settle,

1084
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:29,783
celebrate with them.
And the other chimps were so mad they 

1085
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:32,274
didn't bring him a cake that they,
that he didn't bring them a cake that 

1086
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:38,760
they escaped from the enclosure.
The one of the gates was open,

1087
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,440
got ahold of the guy in,
tore him apart.

1088
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,730
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1089
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,610
Towards feed off.
Just tore his dick off.

1090
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:45,920
Like they'd tear you apart.
They,

1091
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:46,754
they,
they try to tear apart the parts of you 

1092
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,020
that they think you value the most.
Really.

1093
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:52,650
A,
yeah.

1094
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,940
And they do it out of jealousy.

1095
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:54,953
Like they were punishing him for making 
them feel bad that they didn't get the 

1096
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,970
cake.
They're monsters just heartbreak there.

1097
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:00,804
They're in.
They,

1098
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,520
they look,
they're not always this way,

1099
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,110
just like people aren't always monsters.
But chimpanzees inhabit some of the most

1100
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,160
terrifying traits and human beings.
There was a great article recently about

1101
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:11,994
these chimps and they had this one alpha
male that was teamed up with another 

1102
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:16,944
Alpha male and they dominated this 
village and they were horrible and 

1103
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:20,274
ruthless.
And then one of them got real sick and 

1104
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:24,810
he went away for awhile and came back.
But he was like physically all fucked up

1105
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:30,050
and so the original Alpha team was down 
to one guy and this one alpha male,

1106
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,790
they teamed up on them.
They all,

1107
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,660
all the other chimps got together and 
they figured out a way to Jack this dude

1108
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:41,010
that they attacked him and killed him 
and then cannibalized him.

1109
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,250
They killed him and then cannibalized 
him.

1110
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,230
Yeah.
I didn't know they were up till that.

1111
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,550
See,
now I might even go to the zoo now.

1112
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,200
Dude.
Honestly,

1113
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,860
it really does give you a different 
perception,

1114
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,240
you know,
because you don't see that.

1115
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,560
They don't put that on the sign out 
front.

1116
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:53,850
You know,
they just put that there,

1117
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,200
you know,
some of them are from Africa or Malaysia

1118
00:46:56,201 --> 00:46:59,040
and that they're happy to be there in 
the zoo,

1119
00:46:59,080 --> 00:46:59,913
you know?
Definitely not happy to be there in the 

1120
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:01,720
zoo.
Definitely not.

1121
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:04,560
Would you fight a chimp fuck that.
They'll kill you.

1122
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,360
You have no chance.
No chance.

1123
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:09,390
Do you think it's like a baby?
Do you think a baby and kick your ass?

1124
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,070
Not most babies,
no.

1125
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,390
Yeah,
that's what I think about a chimp.

1126
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,480
I think there's not a chance in hell.
Chimps going to kill you.

1127
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,600
What about this chimp one?

1128
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,760
Arm Chimp either.
He'll still kill you with one arm,

1129
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:22,080
right?
He might kill me.

1130
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:23,560
Would you go against him?
I'm know he'll.

1131
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,773
He'll fuck me up too strong.
I don't think you understand how strong 

1132
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,553
you're talking about.
You're talking about something that's 

1133
00:47:28,621 --> 00:47:31,630
like a 500 pound person.
It's so much stronger than you.

1134
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:32,583
If it gets a hold of you and it will,
it's going to pull your arms right out 

1135
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:37,050
of your socket.
One arm of norms.

1136
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:38,263
If it's face,
it's going to grab a hold of you with 

1137
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:41,690
his feet.
It's got feet that a thumbs on it.

1138
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:44,080
It'll hold onto you with its feet and 
they'll bite your neck off.

1139
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,290
Fuck man.
You making me nervous?

1140
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:48,210
Honestly.
Did.

1141
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,070
Well,
that's where we came from.

1142
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,920
I mean that's one of the reasons why 
we're still capable of,

1143
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:54,980
uh,
you know,

1144
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,650
hand to hand combat to this day,
you know,

1145
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,960
because we used to have to probably do 
it.

1146
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,660
It's,
it's got to be somehow or another in our

1147
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,553
ancient primate DNA.
But it's the question is how did we get 

1148
00:48:05,471 --> 00:48:07,120
so far ahead of the rest of them?
Yeah.

1149
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:09,880
Something happened,
something happened and we hit a jump.

1150
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:10,810
We hit a leap year.
Man,

1151
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:13,503
I'm serious.
That was something occurred where or 

1152
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,800
something where we came from the other 
way.

1153
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,520
It could be just some random mutation.
It could be something that we ate.

1154
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:24,340
It could be something that hit us,
it could be radiation.

1155
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,233
You know,
Terence Mckenna thought it was 

1156
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:26,824
mushrooms.
He thought people found mushrooms and 

1157
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,150
started eating mushrooms that have made 
us evolve at a faster rate.

1158
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,050
Some people have attributed to our diet,
but that doesn't totally make sense.

1159
00:48:35,051 --> 00:48:39,100
Some people attributed to our use of 
fire because when we used fire we cooked

1160
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:39,934
meat and we got more nutrients out of it
and that allowed us also to a bit get 

1161
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:45,034
clever and how we kept the fire and use 
of throwing tools like spears and shit 

1162
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:52,660
like that or di coordination.
Women could have made us do it though.

1163
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:55,090
They could have literally been like,
get your shit together,

1164
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,560
you know?
And we brought it up,

1165
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,730
push pussy.
So good.

1166
00:48:57,731 --> 00:49:00,310
We had to evolve to keep them around.
It's gone now.

1167
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:01,144
I think.
No offense if anybody has a puts out 

1168
00:49:02,411 --> 00:49:03,244
there,
but I think a lot of pussies going down 

1169
00:49:03,801 --> 00:49:04,634
hill these days.
I don't feel like it's what it used to 

1170
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:06,514
be.

1171
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,290
You think so or not?
What's changed?

1172
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,050
I don't know what's changed.
I don't know if just the value that they

1173
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:14,884
put on it or just the fact that it's.
I think a lot of it feels a little bit 

1174
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:19,450
more like a Dick.
A little bit.

1175
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:22,720
Like it doesn't have the same pussy 
feeling is that same texture.

1176
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,200
I think it just doesn't have the same 
softness to it.

1177
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:28,630
You know?
So literally Vaginas have changed you.

1178
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,350
I think vaginas are getting harder than 
they were when we were 30 years.

1179
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:35,530
Do you think it's possible?
It's just a guess like maybe something's

1180
00:49:35,531 --> 00:49:36,364
going on with you.
You just think it's like a collective 

1181
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,730
across the board transformation.
I think that yeah,

1182
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:43,564
I think the species are kind of like 
even in an up and that's going to make 

1183
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,030
you don't think so man.
It's a funny thought.

1184
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,970
So now they're getting stronger and 
harder.

1185
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:51,843
Men are getting weaker because men are,
because there's some other purpose 

1186
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:55,234
anymore.
He knows a lot of men out there just 

1187
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,390
crying behind a fucking dairy queen 
right now,

1188
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,840
not knowing what to do with themselves.
There are on a show and he's probably.

1189
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,150
What's Tony's anymore?
Scissor now,

1190
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:06,560
what is it?
As Jamie says,

1191
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:07,121
we're now.
But yeah,

1192
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:08,140
places like that,
you know,

1193
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:13,141
and a lot of managers disheartened and I
think that they just not the same.

1194
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,690
What is the instinct because there's an 
instinct from males are.

1195
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,410
And so to put women down and to hold 
their significant other down,

1196
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:24,220
but there's also a,
an instinct that women have to,

1197
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,200
uh,
diminish a man's manliness and to like,

1198
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,470
it's not always the emasculate them 
demasculate,

1199
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,040
right?
Yeah.

1200
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,330
Or masculinity masculine.
And it's not a,

1201
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:34,170
it's not all of them for sure know when 
I'm done,

1202
00:50:34,171 --> 00:50:35,600
I'm not talking about it,
but I'm talking about,

1203
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,460
we all know that they exist on both 
sides,

1204
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:40,790
on the male side and the women's side,
like people that did not try to pump you

1205
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:41,720
up,
they trying to shoot you down.

1206
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,550
Right?
But what is that instinct,

1207
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:44,384
that instinct in the women that some 
that some women have to try to like 

1208
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,560
diminish.
You try to chip,

1209
00:50:48,561 --> 00:50:49,520
chip,
chip away at you.

1210
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,013
Maybe they have more man and maybe they 
have a little more man in them and so 

1211
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,900
they're more pitch and they look at you.
You fucking,

1212
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,580
you're such a bitch.
You don't even have any heart.

1213
00:50:58,581 --> 00:51:00,680
You don't have any cards,
like almost challenging you.

1214
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,600
Yeah.
Almost want you to smack them.

1215
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,000
Yeah.
You think,

1216
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,693
I'm sure a couple of years have started 
that way util the murders started for 

1217
00:51:08,661 --> 00:51:10,400
sure.
That's the cops say,

1218
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,140
right?
That's the scariest thing they faced.

1219
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,410
Domestic violence.
Yeah.

1220
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,310
Because you might like find a guy 
hitting a girl.

1221
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,820
You might pull the guy off and the girl 
might shoot you or various diverse.

1222
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,073
Yeah.
I don't know what it is in a woman that 

1223
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:21,860
does that.

1224
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,170
I mean maybe there's probably some of it
is.

1225
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,223
I don't think it's genetic.
I think at some they were probably done 

1226
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:31,130
wrong by a man previously and that some 
of that still probably resonate.

1227
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:31,964
Send them,
you know,

1228
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:33,463
because some women do.
They just want to just make you feel 

1229
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:37,230
nasty,
you know,

1230
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,470
they want to make you feel nasty.
I hate that.

1231
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,540
Don't you think it's also how the,
how you raised,

1232
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,433
like if you watch your mom and dad 
insult each other and yell shit at each 

1233
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,050
other becomes ingrained in your system.
Yeah.

1234
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,990
Well I think it's fascinating how we 
turn into our parents,

1235
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:52,550
even though everybody says they don't 
want to.

1236
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,533
Well,
it's always interesting to me is how a 

1237
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:56,300
lot of people do.
You know,

1238
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,280
a lot of people definitely do.
It's easier.

1239
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,380
Certainly easier than becoming your own 
person.

1240
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,050
Becoming your own person requires a lot 
of thought.

1241
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,330
He,
a lot of people want to think anymore,

1242
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,164
man,
but I wonder if people ever wanted to 

1243
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:08,144
thank you know,
this is probably the smartest 

1244
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,760
conversation I've been involved in.
It may be months.

1245
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,083
It really is there.
That's the most I've talked to anybody 

1246
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,400
in a long time.
Well,

1247
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:21,401
I think people want to think but it's 
scary and it's a lot of work.

1248
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,200
It hurts her head sometimes.
You know,

1249
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,153
didn't you?
Your parents were like real old when 

1250
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,240
they had you write your dad was he and 
my dad was.

1251
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:32,090
My Dad was 70 when I was born.
Wow.

1252
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,410
Yeah,
he was born in 1910.

1253
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,210
Um,
Holy Shit Dude.

1254
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:38,060
You're from a different era.
You got different genes.

1255
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,433
Yeah.
Sometime I do think I'll feel a little 

1256
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:42,110
more tired.
I feel a little bit.

1257
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,944
No,
that's not what I mean.

1258
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,570
Yeah.
I mean he got like a,

1259
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,460
like early human genes.
Yeah.

1260
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,453
You know,
like you're a direct descendant from 

1261
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:51,650
someone who was born in 19.
Oh nine.

1262
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,870
Yeah.
You know my jeans.

1263
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,490
I'm,
I'm 49.

1264
00:52:55,491 --> 00:52:55,881
So,
um.

1265
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,890
How old are you?
I'm 36.

1266
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,170
Yeah.
See I'm more than 10 years old in you.

1267
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,860
But my jeans are from 50 years after 
yours.

1268
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,860
You're 19.
Oh nine.

1269
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:08,120
Is that what you said in 19,
10,

1270
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,013
19,
10.

1271
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,630
Almost 60 years.
Yeah,

1272
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:15,230
I was born in [inaudible] 67.
So 57 years of difference in our genes.

1273
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,940
Like you come from a part of your stock,
you're like old school outlaw Josey.

1274
00:53:19,941 --> 00:53:21,920
Wales jeans.
Yeah.

1275
00:53:21,921 --> 00:53:22,671
Maybe.
I don't know what I mean.

1276
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:24,470
My Dad did Erp type shit.
Nineteen.

1277
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:25,710
Oh nine dude,
that's like

1278
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,250
Ebola for credit cards at the colleges.
I don't think that's really wider,

1279
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,310
but he definitely,
you know,

1280
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:33,270
he got out there still,
you know,

1281
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:34,950
in 19.
Oh nine.

1282
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,230
I mean they didn't even.
I mean,

1283
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:38,880
how many cars were there?
10.

1284
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:39,811
19.
Oh,

1285
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:41,130
nine.
And he didn't have one.

1286
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:42,990
I remember asking him if he had,
when he didn't have one of them.

1287
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:48,270
Was He riding a horse everywhere?
I guess they walked it or something that

1288
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,620
imagine you have to work to do gigs.
If you walk thiel Vonda walking,

1289
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:55,950
standup comedian.
Oh my God.

1290
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,470
Pending on the spring.
I'll be in Sacramento.

1291
00:53:59,070 --> 00:53:59,903
I live in.
You'd have to learn how to do ultra 

1292
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:01,524
marathons.
We to run a hundred miles in between 

1293
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:05,270
shows at the amazing.
Yeah,

1294
00:54:05,271 --> 00:54:05,971
man,
it was wild.

1295
00:54:05,971 --> 00:54:08,160
It was pretty wild.
Grown up with an o with an old debt.

1296
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,690
I think that's what got me into comedy 
honestly.

1297
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,710
Just because people would make fun of my
dad a lot and then I had to.

1298
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,810
You'd have to have something to say,
you know,

1299
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,003
and then you had to create a story too 
because people would ask if that was 

1300
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:22,020
your dad and you didn't want to admit 
it.

1301
00:54:22,021 --> 00:54:23,580
A lot of times you.
Wow.

1302
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:25,290
When my dad would just be asleep,
he coming to this,

1303
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,000
I'm going to basketball games and be 
asleep.

1304
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,190
They fall asleep in the car all the 
time.

1305
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:31,110
You Fall Asleep in the car pool.
If he came to get us.

1306
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,810
Wow.
We thought he was dead all the time,

1307
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:35,430
you know,
just like weird shit like that.

1308
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:37,310
So I think it gave a weird,
uh,

1309
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,180
so I guess yeah,
I didn't really think about it,

1310
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:40,450
but maybe that's where I started making 
up,

1311
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,660
you know,
getting involved in more storytelling,

1312
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:43,523
you know.
How old was he when he'd done or how 

1313
00:54:44,621 --> 00:54:46,170
will you were 16?

1314
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,063
Yeah,
16.

1315
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,730
And he was a good dude.
He just got cancer and he was a hard,

1316
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,030
you know,
we work pretty hard.

1317
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,700
He was,
he was working deep into his seventies.

1318
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,080
Oh yeah.
He used to do the credit card he used to

1319
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,593
and that's where I first got on stage,
kind of I'll get to the credit card 

1320
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:01,620
colleges at the credit card when you go 
to the,

1321
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:02,454
you know,
the people that sign up for credit 

1322
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:04,230
cards,
you know,

1323
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:05,670
come and get this card,
you know,

1324
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,550
at the college,
get this card,

1325
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:09,030
you know,
get this free Frisbee.

1326
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:09,864
They always got like a handout with you 
and then I get up on the table and bark 

1327
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:14,100
and get people over to,
uh,

1328
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,533
to do the credit cards.
And so you'd start Kinda riff and a 

1329
00:55:18,391 --> 00:55:19,830
little bit on people that were walking 
by,

1330
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:20,910
you know.
Wow.

1331
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,000
But it was,
it was interesting.

1332
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:24,863
He was,
he was 25 years older than my mom's 

1333
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:29,640
parents were.
So that would be weird sometimes when he

1334
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:32,730
was 25 years older than your mom's 
parents.

1335
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:36,450
How old was your mom?
She's 65 now,

1336
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,200
so I don't know.
I don't know man.

1337
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:43,554
I'm,
I'm a,

1338
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:47,340
I'm a middle monkey I guess.
Did you say you're 35 to six?

1339
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,920
30 six.
So she was somewhere around 30.

1340
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,873
Yeah.
So she was somewhere around 30 and he 

1341
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:54,480
was somewhere around 70.
Yeah.

1342
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,520
Congratulations sir.
Yeah,

1343
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,260
but he didn't have any money though.
He didn't have any money.

1344
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,220
Just slinging it though.
Yeah.

1345
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,850
But I'll tell you this,
just being a product of it,

1346
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:04,950
you want to,
you want to come out of something that's

1347
00:56:04,951 --> 00:56:07,470
got a little bit of cash and it's nuts.
If it's in his seventies,

1348
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:08,363
you know,
but why don't you think that if you did 

1349
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:10,824
have that money,
maybe your life of being a little 

1350
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,534
softer,
maybe you wouldn't have as much 

1351
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:14,004
ambition.

1352
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,890
Maybe you wouldn't be the seal feel von 
sitting in front of me today.

1353
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,680
Yeah.
It's,

1354
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:20,514
I think it's all blessing adversity of 
the experience as a child that doesn't 

1355
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:25,480
fuck you up.
Like physically and you know.

1356
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:26,291
Yeah,
you're right.

1357
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:28,540
Ruin your body,
I think is all good for you,

1358
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:29,380
man.
You're right.

1359
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:30,214
It's just.
I think sometimes I still resonate with 

1360
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:32,890
a lot of the feelings that it has a 
child.

1361
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,400
It's hard to sometimes,
you know,

1362
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,130
I'm still getting through some of those 
now.

1363
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,920
So yes,
I agree with you.

1364
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:39,863
Um,
and I every day I hope to try and see 

1365
00:56:41,771 --> 00:56:42,604
that a little bit more and I know it's 
happening and it does make me realize 

1366
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:48,130
more now that the saddest thing in the 
world really is a,

1367
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,730
is when a kid doesn't really have a 
chance or an opportunity or you know,

1368
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:53,560
like you said something physically 
happened to him,

1369
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,460
you know,
that's bad.

1370
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:56,403
Yeah.
That's one of the saddest things in the 

1371
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:59,590
world for sure.
But uh,

1372
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:00,910
yeah man,
that was,

1373
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,220
that was the wild part.
I guess that's what it got me into this,

1374
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:04,510
in doing this.
So yeah,

1375
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,373
I mean I am,
I am grateful now because I'm able to 

1376
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:09,820
look back on it and you know,
and talk about it.

1377
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:12,520
And how crazy would it be if you knew 
your grandfather?

1378
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,850
Think about how,
what his genes go back to.

1379
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:16,930
Yeah.
I don't know.

1380
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,520
I mean look,
if he's,

1381
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,730
if he had your dad when he was 20,
that's another,

1382
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,560
that's in the 18 hundreds.
Yeah.

1383
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:26,320
So he's born in the 18 hundreds.
Holy Shit.

1384
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,480
Yeah.
The 18 hundreds chances.

1385
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,610
Christ.
That's crazy.

1386
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,910
Oh Man.
Born in the 18 hundreds.

1387
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:37,180
Was your grandfather for sure he was in 
the 18 hundreds for sure.

1388
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:40,510
Unless your dad was born and he was 
fucking 10 years old,

1389
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,433
right?
Yeah.

1390
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,480
Yeah.
My father from Nicaragua actually.

1391
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,920
Wow.
Nicaraguan.

1392
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,790
Where's your mom from?
From Illinois,

1393
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:49,870
Wyoming,
Illinois.

1394
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:50,704
Small town.
And he came up here talking like Juan 

1395
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:58,500
Carlos hit bilateral.
Indeed the tongues slinging.

1396
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,060
Did Dick?
Yeah,

1397
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,730
man,
I got the dig for you.

1398
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,900
Yeah.
That wasn't good or bad,

1399
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,140
man.
I don't know what he was doing,

1400
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:10,060
man.
I speak Spanish.

1401
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,500
Yeah,
he spoke Spanish.

1402
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,363
He was nice man.
I don't remember a ton about them 

1403
00:58:14,111 --> 00:58:14,944
honestly.
I've wished as I was just getting old 

1404
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:19,180
enough it was a,
he was falling out,

1405
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,043
you know,
but I do remember being scared a lot of 

1406
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:24,790
my feelings when I was younger.
Just fear man.

1407
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:28,690
I remember like my dad would walk me to 
church sometimes and um,

1408
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,730
and I would be scared because the 
sidewalks in Louisiana there,

1409
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:34,953
you know,
there's a lot of routes that are coming 

1410
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:36,600
up and this bad,
you know,

1411
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:40,030
it's under sea level a lot of it.
So all the sidewalks are all wonky.

1412
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:40,893
It's not even a walk,
it's really just a challenge of pieces 

1413
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:44,280
of concrete.
Really look at it.

1414
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:48,790
I never thought about it before,
but through this whole wall,

1415
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,053
those kinds of sidewalks,
it's Kinda cool to see those roots 

1416
00:58:51,731 --> 00:58:54,550
struggling against concrete know it's 
ballsy.

1417
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,230
It's ballsy for mother nature to be out 
there.

1418
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:59,140
This pressing up against those plates 
like that and moving them.

1419
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,083
Yeah.
And moving them.

1420
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,320
Yeah.
But what was weird when I remember being

1421
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:05,560
a kid was walking and just being scared 
that he was going to like fall.

1422
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,360
And so it was like,
I just remember always being gay or just

1423
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,310
being,
you know,

1424
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,153
and then I was such a kid and I'm like,
but I just remember this from my first 

1425
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,140
feelings were like I got to make you 
know,

1426
00:59:17,141 --> 00:59:19,630
just make sure he where he's walking is 
okay.

1427
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:21,010
You know,
I was probably six years old,

1428
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,310
so it was just a lot of fear

1429
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:25,400
I think.
And then shame I,

1430
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:28,070
I became ashamed in hindsight.
I feel bad about that.

1431
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,930
Yeah.
But that's understandable.

1432
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,470
And when you're a kid,
yeah.

1433
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,270
It's all confusing to you.
You know,

1434
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,220
why doesn't my dad looked like the other
kid's dad?

1435
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,980
Why do I have to do this?
Why does this have to happen to me?

1436
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,140
You know,
man,

1437
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,250
I stayed with my grandpa when I was 
first moving to New York.

1438
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:50,240
I couldn't afford my own place when I 
moved from Boston and New York and I got

1439
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:52,130
signed by my manager and I was like,
man,

1440
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:53,680
I'm going to move to New York.
This is going to happen.

1441
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:54,980
How to,
how do I make the money?

1442
00:59:54,981 --> 00:59:56,030
And My,
my grandfather said,

1443
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,864
you can come stay with me for awhile 
until you save up enough money for an 

1444
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:00,014
apartment.
My grandfather lived in New Jersey and 

1445
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:03,284
uh,
it was a very important moment in my 

1446
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:09,950
life to stay with them for a few months 
because my grandfather was,

1447
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,360
he was getting old.

1448
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,373
He was and my grandmother was almost 
dead because my grandmother had had a 

1449
01:00:14,661 --> 01:00:17,660
stroke and they had given her 12 years 
to live.

1450
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,070
But,
or excuse me,

1451
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,770
they'd given her 78 hours to live what 
you want to live in 12 years.

1452
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,371
Damn.
Yeah.

1453
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:23,204
They thought it was over.
They thought the stroke is going to do 

1454
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:26,240
her in a couple of days.
She's probably going to be gone.

1455
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:28,790
They found her in the back porch.
It was a really sad story.

1456
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,073
She lived though and there was even 
sadder that way because she was in pain 

1457
01:00:32,991 --> 01:00:33,824
and she would get bedsores.
My grandfather had a 10 to 24 hours a 

1458
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:39,650
day and I was staying with him during 
this time.

1459
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:40,543
Yeah,
so for a few months I was staying with 

1460
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:44,780
my grandmother who was on death's door 
for.

1461
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:48,650
She lived like a year or so after I 
moved out and she wasn't really aware of

1462
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:49,280
me anymore.

1463
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,113
She was not quite there anymore and my 
grandfather who was struggling to take 

1464
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:55,180
care of her and just seemed sad.
Yeah.

1465
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,290
And I remember thinking,
man,

1466
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,153
this life is temporary.
Like this experience that I'm 

1467
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:04,130
experiencing right now is a 24 year old 
man.

1468
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,420
Like this is not going to last like this
is the prime of my youth.

1469
01:01:08,421 --> 01:01:12,770
And I like hard in my ideas that like 
you got to get going,

1470
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:14,690
wow,
this is going to happen to you too.

1471
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:16,260
It's going to happen to all of us and 
you,

1472
01:01:16,261 --> 01:01:17,094
you,
you think that you're this static thing 

1473
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,460
like you stay in this same exact state.
It's not true.

1474
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:23,294
It's an illusion.
All those people that you see that are 

1475
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:25,994
old people that are walking down the 
street with their back's hunched over 

1476
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,770
that you're going to reach that age some
day.

1477
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:31,663
It's going to happen,
and if you don't pay attention and it 

1478
01:01:33,621 --> 01:01:36,320
all goes wrong,
you could wind up looking like that guy.

1479
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,080
You could wind up thinking and behaving 
like that guy.

1480
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:41,750
It is a slow ebbing of the life force of
the body.

1481
01:01:41,751 --> 01:01:44,510
If it's gonna,
it's gonna Drain you so God dammit.

1482
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:47,420
Get your fun out.
Get your life out.

1483
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,460
Just live.
You got to live.

1484
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,120
It's fucking coming and you got to 
remember because if you don't remember,

1485
01:01:53,121 --> 01:01:54,980
you're going to sleep in.
If you don't remember,

1486
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:56,780
you're not going to get anything done.
If you don't remember,

1487
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:57,920
you're not gonna.
You're not gonna.

1488
01:01:57,921 --> 01:01:58,754
Have the same focus and determination 
that you would have with the 

1489
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:04,250
understanding that this is a temporary 
experience.

1490
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,410
Yeah.
Let's see.

1491
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,650
It's interesting.
You'll be able to alert,

1492
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:07,960
you are able to learn that,
you know,

1493
01:02:07,961 --> 01:02:11,240
like not saying that that moment kind of
helped culminate.

1494
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:12,074
Yeah.
But it helped definitely helped some 

1495
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:14,600
people.
It's just hard to learn.

1496
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:15,530
Why is it so hard?

1497
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,030
Sometimes for us hard.
I mean,

1498
01:02:17,031 --> 01:02:17,864
even when I got out of there,
I probably forgot it when I got my own 

1499
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:20,784
apartment and started living normal.
Probably like let it slip for a little 

1500
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:23,370
bit,
you know?

1501
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:24,203
I mean I definitely went through some 
moments in my own life where I lost my 

1502
01:02:26,131 --> 01:02:29,850
motivation and my point of view or got 
lazy or lost my perspective,

1503
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,283
but I've figured out the consequences of
that and I always bounced it back as 

1504
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:34,524
best as I could,
but I just remember those few months 

1505
01:02:36,871 --> 01:02:39,390
that I lived with my grandfather being 
real important.

1506
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:41,213
Real important too,
because he lived in a neighborhood that 

1507
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:44,360
was real bad man.
It was,

1508
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,010
it was north ninth street in Newark,
New Jersey.

1509
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,300
Sounds horrible,
dude.

1510
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:49,470
Honestly,
I've never even been there.

1511
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,570
It was great at one time when he was,
uh,

1512
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,633
you know,
when it was all families that had all 

1513
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:56,900
moved to this neighborhood,
thugs.

1514
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,243
Well,
what had happened was they did this 

1515
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:02,550
thing called blockbusting.
They come around and say,

1516
01:03:02,551 --> 01:03:03,384
Hey,
black people are moving into your 

1517
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:05,010
neighborhood,
you got to sell now.

1518
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,113
And everybody sold,
my grandfather didn't like black people 

1519
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:09,863
to fuck off my lawn,
like one of those things because real 

1520
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:12,144
estate agents,
they would do that and just turn these 

1521
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:16,260
neighborhoods over and just make 
profits.

1522
01:03:16,261 --> 01:03:18,150
And so,
uh,

1523
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:18,984
and then it changed.
Went from a black neighborhood to a 

1524
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:21,564
Puerto Rican neighborhood and now it's 
like a bunch of different kinds of 

1525
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:25,220
immigrants and you know,
they're all,

1526
01:03:25,221 --> 01:03:28,560
it's all kind of the same cycle.
They're all trying to come to America.

1527
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:29,394
They're trying to establish themselves 
and that's the place where they get 

1528
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:32,790
going.
So there was a lot of crime.

1529
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:34,620
It was,
it was kinda dangerous.

1530
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:38,900
The next door neighbor was selling crack
and they battering rammed his door.

1531
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:39,763
I was like,
oh,

1532
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,490
I think something happened while I was 
there,

1533
01:03:41,491 --> 01:03:45,050
but the big raid was before I got there 
because I got there.

1534
01:03:45,051 --> 01:03:45,884
This guy had like barriers in front of 
his house gates and he had an Audi in 

1535
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:50,760
the driveway.
It was selling crack.

1536
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,090
Yes,
right next door.

1537
01:03:52,091 --> 01:03:52,924
It is funny.
There's always that one house and like 

1538
01:03:53,651 --> 01:03:55,460
the crappy neighborhood that has all the
like it's like,

1539
01:03:55,461 --> 01:03:57,190
uh,
like obviously it stands out.

1540
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,370
Something's going on the statues of 
lions out front and stuff.

1541
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:02,783
Yeah,
man.

1542
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:03,653
Yeah.
But I think having a dad like that 

1543
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:09,210
must've given you a different sense of 
the cycle of life,

1544
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,550
you know,
instead of having a young vital dad,

1545
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:13,590
you're like,
my dad so healthy and he's my hero.

1546
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,510
You grew up going,
holy shit.

1547
01:04:15,511 --> 01:04:17,250
My Dad was not much time left,
man.

1548
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:19,500
Yeah,
he,

1549
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:21,130
I think it just made me scared.
It just,

1550
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:24,040
it just made me,
it.

1551
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:25,143
First of all,
it made my sense of humor really dark 

1552
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:31,680
because I remember like my mom would ask
us if my dad was still alive or not,

1553
01:04:32,531 --> 01:04:33,820
you know,
and make us check on him like,

1554
01:04:33,821 --> 01:04:36,760
around dinner before I remember,
I remember having,

1555
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:37,653
like,
I remember my brother would sometimes 

1556
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:41,960
hold like a mirror under his nose as he 
would fog up,

1557
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:43,090
you know,
to see if we would,

1558
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,250
if my mom would,
um,

1559
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,600
and then we just tell mom,
yeah,

1560
01:04:46,601 --> 01:04:47,470
he's fine,
you know,

1561
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:49,270
so,
and my mom wasn't very caring.

1562
01:04:49,271 --> 01:04:50,830
She was,
she's a good woman,

1563
01:04:50,831 --> 01:04:53,380
she's a hard working woman.
She delivered newspapers,

1564
01:04:53,381 --> 01:04:54,160
you know,
her whole life,

1565
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,770
but she just,
I don't know,

1566
01:04:56,771 --> 01:04:59,290
maybe she was angry that she felt fallen
for this older man.

1567
01:04:59,291 --> 01:04:59,800
I don't know.

1568
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,540
Anyway,
I don't know.

1569
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:02,291
It was weird,
man.

1570
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,520
It was,
I don't know,

1571
01:05:03,521 --> 01:05:04,354
I,
I didn't develop much of a relationship 

1572
01:05:05,681 --> 01:05:06,514
for them with them.
Sometimes I just develop moments that I 

1573
01:05:09,011 --> 01:05:14,011
remember that I kind of pieced together 
that create the relationship that I felt

1574
01:05:15,251 --> 01:05:16,210
like we had.
I guess,

1575
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:19,150
you know,
I like treasurer about 10 or 15 moments.

1576
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:20,973
Um,
and then in hindsight he let me drive 

1577
01:05:23,051 --> 01:05:24,280
when I was young,
you know,

1578
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:25,114
he kind of took advantage of me a little
bit like you would drive them to 

1579
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:31,780
colleges when I entered to due to credit
card stuff when I was 12 and 13,

1580
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:33,130
you know,
tall enough to drive.

1581
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,390
So I'm driving 70 on the interstate man 
and shit dude.

1582
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:38,770
Yeah.
And he didn't.

1583
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:39,703
And in hindsight it,
it made me think that everything was 

1584
01:05:41,381 --> 01:05:42,100
okay.
Like uh,

1585
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,030
you know,
life doesn't,

1586
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:44,621
whatever,
you know,

1587
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:46,780
somebody,
you know like who care,

1588
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:47,770
you know,
whatever.

1589
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,970
Everything's fine,
you know,

1590
01:05:48,971 --> 01:05:51,340
like it doesn't matter what,
you know,

1591
01:05:51,341 --> 01:05:53,380
like everything.
Kids can do adult stuff,

1592
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:55,030
adults can do kid stuff,
you know,

1593
01:05:55,031 --> 01:05:57,910
there's no real lines in the sand there.
Wow.

1594
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:01,210
So there wasn't like a moment where you 
felt like finally you were grown up,

1595
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,280
like you just doing the same shit you 
always did.

1596
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,500
Yeah.
So you started driving at 12?

1597
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:06,363
Yeah,
I remember driving my dad to come to 

1598
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,510
these colleges and he was 82 at the 
time.

1599
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:13,180
He was 82.
I remember one time dropping them at the

1600
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:15,130
post office did.
And he said there's nowhere to park,

1601
01:06:15,131 --> 01:06:16,630
just go around the block,
you know.

1602
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:19,420
So I went around the block and he had 
like a delta 88.

1603
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:20,970
He bought it off.
Oh my God,

1604
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,033
of brothers and his April had speakers 
in the back and one of them had broken 

1605
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:28,840
out and had a bunch of Chinese food and 
Chinese food or some type of to go items

1606
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:29,650
in there.

1607
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:30,483
And um,
and fucking the speakers are always 

1608
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:36,400
speak up.
And I just remember I hit him.

1609
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,640
I probably hit three or four cars is 
going around the block to get back to my

1610
01:06:39,641 --> 01:06:40,474
dad because it didn't have power.
Power steering you that should have had 

1611
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:44,614
power steering.
I don't think I'm willing to me at 88 

1612
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,610
oldsmobile.
Yeah.

1613
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,580
Yeah.
To me it was big man.

1614
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:53,350
It felt like a,
you felt cool,

1615
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:54,184
you know,
but,

1616
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,260
and the car was such a piece of shit 
man.

1617
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:59,170
And so he couldn't even tell if it had 
been hit a bunch of Shit,

1618
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:00,510
you know,
he was always hitting shit.

1619
01:07:00,511 --> 01:07:03,370
And here was it again,
I don't know man.

1620
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,910
Delta 88.
I would feel like those are so big.

1621
01:07:06,911 --> 01:07:09,550
They would have to have power steering,
but I don't know,

1622
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:12,130
man.
What a risk cracker that must've been.

1623
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:14,290
If it wasn't champagne colored,
I remember that.

1624
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,630
Those are boats,
man.

1625
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,771
Yeah.
It felt big.

1626
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:19,570
It felt good and bad thing.
Look at it.

1627
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,570
Oh yeah.
He wasn't like that.

1628
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:23,240
Yeah,
Dude.

1629
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,130
It was like,
no,

1630
01:07:24,131 --> 01:07:26,560
it was probably a year or two.
It seems newer than that.

1631
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:28,630
A year or two newer than that one.
Yeah.

1632
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:31,750
Those were,
those were like American boats.

1633
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:33,970
Look at that motherfucker.
What year is that?

1634
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,350
That thing's awesome.
That's an two.

1635
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,330
Is that an ltd?
Seventy one.

1636
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:42,390
Nineteen 71 thing that is just 
Americana.

1637
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,710
Oh yeah.
Open up that hood.

1638
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:48,690
It's just a controlled explosion.
And cayston steal.

1639
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,293
Did.
I remember one time my dad took me to 

1640
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:56,461
get donuts when I was young and uh,
they had crows in Louisiana,

1641
01:07:56,501 --> 01:07:59,590
these big crows and they busted out the 
windows in his car and I would,

1642
01:07:59,591 --> 01:08:01,430
uh,
crows did this huge crow.

1643
01:08:01,431 --> 01:08:02,520
Yeah,
like a huge,

1644
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,540
broke the window.
Broke the windows in his car.

1645
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:05,380
They broke,
break it.

1646
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:07,690
I guess maybe with his beak.
Come on.

1647
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,980
Yeah,
they can do that.

1648
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,720
I mean,
they did this day,

1649
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:13,060
you know,
and uh,

1650
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:14,123
you should have somebody else didn't 
break the window and the crows were 

1651
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:15,881
inside.
Well,

1652
01:08:15,881 --> 01:08:15,980
I

1653
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,813
remember,
I just remember trying to tell them it 

1654
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:19,460
was a black bird.
I was like four years old and he thought

1655
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:21,290
it was a black man because he couldn't 
turn his neck.

1656
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,810
So he was like yelling all these racial 
slurs.

1657
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,150
Yeah.
And we're just going to get some towels.

1658
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,343
Oh No.
So there's just always things like that 

1659
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:30,530
that were just weird.
Yeah.

1660
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:32,720
He couldn't turn his neck.
Like that's one of the things I remember

1661
01:08:32,721 --> 01:08:33,860
most about him.
You know,

1662
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:36,050
I remember you had change in his pockets
a lot.

1663
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:40,010
He liked to whistle.
He slept on the couch,

1664
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,890
you know,
some parents kiss one time my dad kissed

1665
01:08:42,891 --> 01:08:45,350
my mother on the head one time at one of
our birthdays.

1666
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,390
That's it.
Uh,

1667
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,780
yeah,
just one time.

1668
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,490
Wow.
And I don't know,

1669
01:08:49,491 --> 01:08:50,324
I feel like when we started to grow up,
my mother became a little bit 

1670
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:55,790
embarrassed maybe almost to us that our 
dad was at age.

1671
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,720
What makes sense?
I mean if she was like 40 and he was 80.

1672
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,273
Yeah.
You know,

1673
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,670
she's 46 when he died of old age 
essentially.

1674
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:05,504
Right.
You might have a disease or cancer or 

1675
01:09:06,801 --> 01:09:07,550
something like that,
but when you,

1676
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:08,383
once you hit around 86,
it's kind of like that's the age where 

1677
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:14,900
everybody starts to go over,
man.

1678
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:16,250
Yeah,
I guess that was some of it.

1679
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:17,450
Yeah.
Not to be a debbie downer.

1680
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:17,900
Nothing.
No.

1681
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:18,733
You're not a Debbie Downer and just 
being honest and talking about your 

1682
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:23,270
life.
It's pretty fascinating man.

1683
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:24,470
I mean,
you know,

1684
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:25,323
I've,
I've kind of talked about this quite a 

1685
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:28,760
bit,
that there's a,

1686
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:32,810
we all have these ideas of like what 
your life is supposed to be like.

1687
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:33,953
I think a lot of them are based on 
movies were based on like a movie 

1688
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,140
version of life.
You Go,

1689
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:40,700
well that's how it happened in the 
movie.

1690
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,350
That's how it's supposed to go down in 
my life.

1691
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:45,260
And why isn't it happening in my life 
the way it happens in the movie,

1692
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,980
but then when you talk to people like 
you or you know,

1693
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:51,710
my child was different.
Jamie's childhood was different.

1694
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:54,410
Like I know a lot of people that are 
like really weird childhoods.

1695
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,603
Joey Diaz,
his childhood is the craziest story 

1696
01:09:56,721 --> 01:09:57,590
ever.
Julie Diaz,

1697
01:09:57,591 --> 01:09:59,900
his last spring,
it seems insane to me.

1698
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:02,630
Shall we found his mom dad while he was 
on acid?

1699
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,270
Oh yeah.
I mean his childhood,

1700
01:10:05,271 --> 01:10:06,104
his car.
You got adopted by his friends family 

1701
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:11,020
and they took him in and you know,
it's his car,

1702
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,290
his childhood.
It's crazy.

1703
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,080
And he's one of the most incredible 
people I've ever met.

1704
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:15,973
I love that guy.
Always hard to his heart to go in the 

1705
01:10:17,211 --> 01:10:19,280
Smithsonian and when they're done when.
No,

1706
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:20,660
no.
There's a lot of people like that,

1707
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:21,020
man.

1708
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,960
There's a lot of people that have come 
from like,

1709
01:10:22,961 --> 01:10:25,040
all my best friends have come from some 
fucked up.

1710
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:26,430
Crazy childhood.
Yeah.

1711
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,230
We're all experiencing that.
But the,

1712
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,153
the thing that's unique to me is that 
all these people with these fucked up 

1713
01:10:33,621 --> 01:10:36,680
crazy childhoods.
Those are the diamonds in this world.

1714
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,481
Yeah.
You know,

1715
01:10:37,481 --> 01:10:39,770
like those are like you ever talked to 
Whitney Cummings?

1716
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:40,993
Not.
I listen to a little bit of her on your 

1717
01:10:42,141 --> 01:10:44,210
podcast the other day.
The smartest people I've ever met.

1718
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:45,163
Wow.
She's so fucking smart and she's almost 

1719
01:10:46,851 --> 01:10:49,220
too smart.
Like she's like psychoanalyzing yourself

1720
01:10:49,221 --> 01:10:50,054
24 slash seven and talking about her 
childhood and experiencing life through 

1721
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:54,873
try and experiencing through her words 
what she had to go through and why she 

1722
01:10:56,991 --> 01:10:57,824
became who she is now.
It's like you don't make a person like 

1723
01:10:59,931 --> 01:11:01,820
that.
Like they don't come out normal.

1724
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:06,080
Like if you don't come out that way,
if they had a normal childhood.

1725
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,093
I just don't know.
The only way you make a Joey Diaz 

1726
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,750
because you got to experience with Joey 
Diaz is experienced.

1727
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:14,580
Yeah.
Like regular life people.

1728
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,443
They're just not.
You're not going to ever get one of 

1729
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:17,964
those people out of that regular life.
You're not going to make a thiel Vaughn 

1730
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:22,170
at have some regular life.
Yeah.

1731
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:23,670
You know what I mean?
It's,

1732
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:26,730
it's interesting thing because most of 
my life or my youth especially,

1733
01:11:26,731 --> 01:11:30,150
I pined for that regular or this idea of
what it was,

1734
01:11:30,151 --> 01:11:30,984
you know,
or something we saw on television or 

1735
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:34,860
little house on the prairie with the 
thing I really attached myself to,

1736
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:36,180
you know,
I've always been a huge Michael and,

1737
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:39,630
and fan as an adult.
Either a big fan of the man from Atlanta

1738
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,760
and seeing that.
Remember that?

1739
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:43,380
Yeah.
Michael Landon.

1740
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,340
He used to be,
I think it was sam.

1741
01:11:46,341 --> 01:11:46,650
What was it?

1742
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:50,580
Patrick Duffy might be Patrick Duffy.
There was a,

1743
01:11:50,581 --> 01:11:51,414
uh,
a show called the man from Atlantis was 

1744
01:11:54,211 --> 01:11:56,730
Patrick Duffy who was in what show was 
he in?

1745
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:59,270
He was in one of those step by step.
No,

1746
01:11:59,271 --> 01:12:00,570
no,
there was one before that.

1747
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:03,030
There was a big time show that he was in
before.

1748
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:06,780
It was like a superstar before he did 
the man for the last.

1749
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:08,490
It's silly.
It's terrible.

1750
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,630
Breathe under water and shit.
But it was,

1751
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:13,980
it was like on TV when I was a little 
kid.

1752
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,580
You know,
this God,

1753
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:16,961
I loved it.
I was,

1754
01:12:16,961 --> 01:12:18,180
I was a little kid.
I was stupid.

1755
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:21,780
What year was that on 77.
[inaudible] 78.

1756
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:23,873
10.
I was 10 years old and he was swimming 

1757
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:27,930
in the water and breathing under water.
Like a fish.

1758
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,300
Like he would keep his legs together 
when he would swim.

1759
01:12:30,301 --> 01:12:32,250
He had this weird way of swimming 
underwater.

1760
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,350
Yeah,
and I used to swim in a pool.

1761
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:35,184
I still try to swim Atlantis.
It's actually like an effective way to 

1762
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,970
swim.
It's not like he would swim like,

1763
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,740
like a,
like a dolphin.

1764
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,450
Like he would get in the water.
What is that?

1765
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,270
Is that him?
Is that him from way back then?

1766
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:49,301
Yeah,
it is.

1767
01:12:49,301 --> 01:12:50,610
That's from the show look.
Wow.

1768
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:51,503
Yeah.
That was always in very good shape and 

1769
01:12:53,971 --> 01:12:58,590
they would have him swim against the 
Dolphin and he was faster than it off.

1770
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:02,320
Look how stupid that is.
Homeland was a.

1771
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:05,700
This show is so stupid.
He's faster than a dolphin.

1772
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,200
I think I saw that real contest like 
this in Arkansas.

1773
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:10,183
One,
he's going to shoot it out of the water 

1774
01:13:11,671 --> 01:13:13,530
and grabbed the fish with the dolphin.
Can't get to it.

1775
01:13:13,531 --> 01:13:14,430
This was crazy.
Look,

1776
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,323
flies up in the air 30 feet out of the 
water and then he gave the fish to the 

1777
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:28,410
dolphin because he's even better than 
the dolphin.

1778
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,300
I feel like that show would make it 
today.

1779
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,233
Oh yeah.
They should do it today with the exact 

1780
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:33,234
same scenes and the exact stage put on 
comedy central will be fucking 

1781
01:13:35,851 --> 01:13:37,320
hilarious.
Same cast.

1782
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,820
But he would.
That wasn't a race,

1783
01:13:38,821 --> 01:13:39,654
but there was other times when you see 
him swim underwater and gyrate his body 

1784
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:45,300
like a dolphin would.
Yeah.

1785
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,430
Weirdest.
Fuck man.

1786
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,593
Yeah man.
I never wanted to be a fisherman my 

1787
01:13:48,781 --> 01:13:49,614
whole life.

1788
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,390
I did.
That didn't,

1789
01:13:54,391 --> 01:13:55,650
man.
I've never thought about that.

1790
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:57,860
Yup.
I've never woke up a day of my life.

1791
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:58,321
Said,
man,

1792
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:00,180
I wish I was fish.
Or how about,

1793
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,340
how about this?
How about a fucking platypus.

1794
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:02,970
I mean,
what is the,

1795
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:07,970
what is this Jamie?
Is that a double headed sea horse that's

1796
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,680
as tall as a person.
Wow.

1797
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:13,780
This seems real.
Look at it.

1798
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,750
He's trying to.
He's trying to bite them.

1799
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:17,584
The sea horses biting him and at the 
same time he's trying to get himself 

1800
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:22,150
free.
He's rubbing this.

1801
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,010
Uh,
yeah.

1802
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:24,160
I always do.
Is moving his head,

1803
01:14:24,161 --> 01:14:27,640
his rubbing,
his rubs against the stick on the muscle

1804
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,940
free and he falls to the ground.
Is he naked?

1805
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,890
Was he naked?
What is.

1806
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,540
Hold on.
Why is he rolling?

1807
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,370
Oh.
Oh my God.

1808
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:39,910
He moves like a dolphin on earth and 
then he gets the water is free.

1809
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,710
Why is he naked?
He's naked,

1810
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:42,544
right?
Yes.

1811
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,750
Oh,
this looks like a.

1812
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,390
Oh my God.
This is worse than the Captain Kirk.

1813
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,473
A fight with the alien scene.
Remember that terrible one with the 

1814
01:14:52,411 --> 01:14:53,244
aliens.
Got The crazy eyes and he kills it with 

1815
01:14:54,311 --> 01:14:55,920
a rock.
It's just like a scavenger.

1816
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,120
Looks like a tender dating key West 
actually is what?

1817
01:14:58,121 --> 01:15:01,180
This looks so bad man.
From Atlantis.

1818
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:04,170
A scavenger hunt is what it says on the,
um,

1819
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,340
on the youtube video.
If you want to go watch it,

1820
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:08,380
that's worth checking out actually after
Dick off.

1821
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,313
That is worse.
That's absolutely worse than the Star 

1822
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:12,843
Wars.
Fight with Captain Kirk in that alien 

1823
01:15:13,481 --> 01:15:14,201
guy.
Yeah.

1824
01:15:14,201 --> 01:15:16,000
I never seen that number.
I never got into star wars.

1825
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,300
Hold that shit up.
Star Trek.

1826
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,330
Star Wars.
Did I?

1827
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:21,070
Yeah,
I get them confused.

1828
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:24,970
I think if I was star track,
I'd be pissed that star wars came around

1829
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:25,630
pitch.

1830
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:29,110
We already used star Star.
How'd they come up with something else?

1831
01:15:29,111 --> 01:15:32,740
So what about the fact that it.
They got both huge series off of both of

1832
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:33,940
them.
Was the Canadian.

1833
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:36,880
How about it's not star Trek Bitch at 
space trek?

1834
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:38,130
Is it really?
Yeah.

1835
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:41,490
It's not star wars either.
So here's Captain Kirk first.

1836
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:45,370
Is this a green alien dude that moves 
and super slow Mo.

1837
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:46,493
Like,
look at him.

1838
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:47,613
He's Like,
whoa.

1839
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:48,453
Here comes the left.
The car hits him with some terrible 

1840
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:53,140
punch to the body here comes to right.
A terrible karate chop.

1841
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:54,910
This is so stupid.
Look at him.

1842
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:56,470
He's got crazy eyes.
He's reaching for him.

1843
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:57,960
It didn't happening.
Cool.

1844
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,390
Throws a kick.
Oh good move.

1845
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:00,873
Shitty ass kicked.
But the green monster obviously knows a 

1846
01:16:03,491 --> 01:16:06,340
little bit of moitai because you just 
got him on a single leg dump.

1847
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,470
Didn't even trip,
didn't bother the trip.

1848
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,540
Just severe strength.
Just thrown through the air.

1849
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:13,750
But meanwHile this is how inconsistent 
they are right now.

1850
01:16:13,751 --> 01:16:15,820
They're battling no problem.
Like the,

1851
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:16,953
the green monster is not overpower them.
He's trying to bite them wearing a 

1852
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,370
dress,
or is that a uh,

1853
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:23,720
probably something's going on.
Meanwhile,

1854
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,870
meanwhile he's having a hard time 
battling it out with shafting.

1855
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:28,421
Oh,
snack.

1856
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:30,330
They're double fucking palms into the 
ears.

1857
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:32,680
the double pump to the ears is always a 
good move.

1858
01:16:32,681 --> 01:16:35,430
When you're fighting monsters calling 
this man,

1859
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,030
check this shit out.
This is where it gets really stupid.

1860
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:40,390
He picks up this fake rock,
obviously fake rock.

1861
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,070
Look at him.
He pretends he's trained in way.

1862
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:42,913
Gets it by you.
I'm gonna hit you with this fake rock 

1863
01:16:45,131 --> 01:16:47,430
and it's gonna fucking kill you.
And look at this beautiful man.

1864
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,680
He was back then.
Look how he throws it.

1865
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,790
Bomb look as stupid as it bounces off 
him.

1866
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:54,250
So how come he can hit him with the 
fucking double pump to the head?

1867
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:56,020
And it's like the most devastating blow 
ever.

1868
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,540
But that rock,
nothing you.

1869
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:02,050
They're so inconsistent with his ability
to generate force.

1870
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,153
The religion jones' a little bit.
How dare you say you think she's had 

1871
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:07,624
enough?
He'll get it.

1872
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:10,490
He's going to pick up a fake rock now.
Oh you motherfucker.

1873
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:12,080
I'll show you.
And he's like,

1874
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:13,940
you throw a rock at me,
motherfucker.

1875
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:16,130
I'm going to throw a fake rock at you.
And kirk's like,

1876
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,200
I'm out of here bitch.
And see runs out of the way.

1877
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,710
Oh,
just just shy away from that rock.

1878
01:17:21,711 --> 01:17:25,190
You can't hit me with that.
And so now what happens?

1879
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,730
Nothing just get stupider and stupider.
Like why don't I just keep running.

1880
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:30,950
This thing is so slow.
Why he duking it out with it.

1881
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:31,843
It will never catch you.
Like you would literally never catch 

1882
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:35,930
you.
And you could run for a couple hours and

1883
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:36,764
then take a nap.
And this stupid fucking green man will 

1884
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:41,450
be coming over the top of that hill.
He'd hear his footsteps.

1885
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,810
He probably makes a lot of noise when he
walks and he would wake up and then just

1886
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:47,300
runs more.
I never fought nothing like that.

1887
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:53,210
You know whAt I'm saying though?
I follow you dog.

1888
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:55,430
One time this guy fight in me when I was
young,

1889
01:17:55,431 --> 01:17:56,870
he fighted you.
Well,

1890
01:17:56,871 --> 01:17:58,790
you know what I'm saying?
I did past tense.

1891
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:00,423
He,
um,

1892
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,380
he,
they made us hug in the hallway.

1893
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:05,820
That was the big thing at our and it was
over at our school.

1894
01:18:05,821 --> 01:18:06,654
We had to stand there all,
all afternoon for literally probably 

1895
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:09,344
maybe two,
three hours with your arms on each 

1896
01:18:10,581 --> 01:18:12,490
other's shoulders after you fought.
Yep.

1897
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:13,783
To make it up with each other.
and he became one of my best friends 

1898
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:16,040
after that.
Oh,

1899
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,520
just make out his brother went to prison
though for a bit.

1900
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:21,160
Same thing.
Yeah,

1901
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:22,340
that's true.
So his brother,

1902
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:23,660
I guess made out on our behalf.

1903
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,410
So you guys fought over,
what?

1904
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,030
Do you remember what it was about?
I remember,

1905
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:30,860
man,
I was probably talking smack,

1906
01:18:30,861 --> 01:18:31,940
you know,
just being a young,

1907
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:32,774
loud mouth.
And sometimes you call it your desserts 

1908
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:36,380
whenever you ran your mouth.
Sure.

1909
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,450
Every now and then,
um,

1910
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:43,310
I remember that though.
And I remember another man who I met,

1911
01:18:43,311 --> 01:18:44,144
a man who was a boxer.
I know you're big into boxing and ufc 

1912
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:46,610
fighting.
And um,

1913
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:50,000
I met a man who was a boxer who looked 
like don flamenco.

1914
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:52,490
Do you remember that guy down the video 
game guy?

1915
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,170
He looked just like my friend.
Yeah.

1916
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:55,733
Yeah.
He popped that jab yet my friend 

1917
01:18:58,911 --> 01:19:00,160
william,
just like him.

1918
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:01,680
WhaT's that noise?
What was that?

1919
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:03,490
How was the noise go?
It was more like a pool,

1920
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:08,130
wasn't noise.
When he hit you look at him.

1921
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,380
He looked like adam sandler with the 
prosthetic nose.

1922
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:14,383
Yeah,
that's what my buddy looked like a 

1923
01:19:14,931 --> 01:19:15,764
little bit.
There's a homosexuaL gentleman in 

1924
01:19:17,391 --> 01:19:18,520
italian.
Yeah.

1925
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:19,363
Remember he had the rose in his mouth 
come out and you'd be even more 

1926
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:22,724
humiliating when he kicked her ass.
And my buddy and I used to get high 

1927
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:26,054
together that gentlemen and we used to 
actually do steroids together back in 

1928
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:31,430
the day on the side of the interstate 
and we would,

1929
01:19:31,431 --> 01:19:34,200
uh,
and we were both busboys.

1930
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:35,183
Well,
He was a bus man because he was an 

1931
01:19:35,661 --> 01:19:39,170
adult,
but we would do bussing tables at the,

1932
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:40,183
at this steakhouse that had opened up.
And I remember we got really stoned one 

1933
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:43,694
night,
went over to his place and a princess 

1934
01:19:46,101 --> 01:19:48,530
diana died.
Princess diana was,

1935
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:50,350
you know.
And um,

1936
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,430
you really didn't know who she was when 
she died.

1937
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:54,050
No idea.
How old were you?

1938
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,320
Think 16,
probably.

1939
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:58,130
Wow.
You didn't know princess diana was.

1940
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:59,890
That's interesting.
I mean,

1941
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:02,560
I remember at one point they had a 
beanie baby about it.

1942
01:20:02,561 --> 01:20:04,940
That's the most that I remembered.
Yeah.

1943
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:06,530
She had her own beanie baby,
I guess.

1944
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:07,830
Oh,
princess

1945
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,590
diana thing was strange man.
Yeah.

1946
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:11,424
Well,
especially if you didn't know who she 

1947
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:12,504
was and like I remember my buddy's mom 
crying and like people were just 

1948
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:18,660
devastated I guess a lot of like 
southern kind of women.

1949
01:20:18,661 --> 01:20:21,570
Were you?
She was an idol to a lot of those women.

1950
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,760
She was like elvis presley kind of.
Well,

1951
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:28,200
it was crazy that she got killed in a 
high speed chase with the papa razzi was

1952
01:20:28,201 --> 01:20:29,250
chasing her.
yeah.

1953
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:30,930
Think about that.
It's crazy.

1954
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:33,600
Like if tHat happened here,
we'd probably be stoked about.

1955
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:37,240
Depending on who it was,
who they get.

1956
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:40,790
He get some of these retired nascar 
driver,

1957
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:42,243
they would give them a camera.
Do you remember when tony stewart a 

1958
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:45,870
camera,
he'll kill somebody.

1959
01:20:45,871 --> 01:20:49,320
Did halle berry got into a car accident 
and ran away?

1960
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,170
Just ran off the car and said,
fuck this,

1961
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,200
and figured out what my attorneys she 
took over.

1962
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,780
I remember because radio stations used 
to,

1963
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,560
oh tom lucas used to play a huge have 
callers.

1964
01:21:01,561 --> 01:21:04,470
They would call In and so let me go,
tom,

1965
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:08,100
take me out with a bong hit and he'd 
play like bong sounds like someone doing

1966
01:21:08,101 --> 01:21:08,934
a bong hit and he would take me out like
halle berry and you would hear like 

1967
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:13,810
cartoon footsteps,
you know,

1968
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:14,641
like when,
you know,

1969
01:21:14,641 --> 01:21:19,641
in cartoons when someone's taken off a 
that sounds like a xylophone with little

1970
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:26,340
slaps on the ground.
Like that's crazy.

1971
01:21:26,341 --> 01:21:27,174
But what would you do you think if you 
got an a in an instance like that where 

1972
01:21:29,591 --> 01:21:30,780
she messed up,
you think as well?

1973
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:32,130
She did it.
She was under the open.

1974
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,093
Yeah,
she Could have been.

1975
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:35,063
Who knows?
Did you ever get caught up in any of 

1976
01:21:36,031 --> 01:21:37,500
that?
Jealousy and drugs and stuff?

1977
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:41,310
This was chris brown's lamborghini was 
found a couple of weeks ago,

1978
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,293
but it was flooding.

1979
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:44,370
IT was his friend that drove it and just
disappeared.

1980
01:21:44,371 --> 01:21:45,204
That's,
I know it was his because it was like 

1981
01:21:46,221 --> 01:21:49,110
what a registered to him.
He wasn't driving.

1982
01:21:49,111 --> 01:21:51,870
He wasn't in town.
He did apparently let's like seven or 10

1983
01:21:51,871 --> 01:21:52,704
of his friends drive has a fleet of oh 
really expensive cars revoke privileges 

1984
01:21:57,931 --> 01:22:02,931
after this happened,
but total that's I got fucked.

1985
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:04,103
Which,
which kind Of lamborghini is a really 

1986
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:07,380
expensive one.
Yeah,

1987
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:08,150
you have.
Do you have a.

1988
01:22:08,150 --> 01:22:09,410
You have a pretty nice cars,
man.

1989
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:10,980
I've seen some of your cards at the 
comedy club.

1990
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:12,840
Yeah,
mine are older though.

1991
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,630
I don't have any.
I don't adore.

1992
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,863
Oh shit.
That's like a 300 plus thousand dollar 

1993
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:20,370
car.
Lamborghini,

1994
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:23,280
aventador.
I want to Say that's $400,000.

1995
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:24,780
Find out how much that fucking thing 
cost.

1996
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:28,280
So the same there should say right.
There he is.

1997
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,970
Why do these rappers?
I mean they just always.

1998
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:34,650
Ah,
why did they end up in so much strife?

1999
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:37,410
Do you feel like a lot of them remember 
what we were talking about earlier about

2000
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,030
us?
Same thing with them.

2001
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:41,890
You don't make them,
you don't make like a,

2002
01:22:41,891 --> 01:22:42,724
a,
a big time wrapper or a funny comedian 

2003
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:46,494
or you know,
or a great fight or any of these weird 

2004
01:22:49,681 --> 01:22:51,660
profession.
So you don't really make those things if

2005
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:53,490
you don't have some sort of pressure 
growing up.

2006
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:55,650
How much does that Bitch?
300.

2007
01:22:55,651 --> 01:22:57,210
Ninety 9,000.
$500.

2008
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,133
god damn it says from.
That's like that's a stripped down 

2009
01:23:01,471 --> 01:23:03,300
version.
Unless you call,

2010
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,400
you talk them down a little bit though.
That three 99,

2011
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,300
399,000.
You can't talk them down.

2012
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,240
You can't know.
He's got nice wheels on it too.

2013
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,430
Those are those look like an aftermarket
wheels.

2014
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:16,930
Those are dope too.

2015
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:17,930
Crazy car.
That's it.

2016
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:19,083
That isn't insane.
Car for a human being to be able to 

2017
01:23:20,441 --> 01:23:21,274
drive.
You can just go and buy one of those 

2018
01:23:21,851 --> 01:23:22,684
things.
Is it scary driving a car that it costs 

2019
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:25,780
a lot of money?
Is it like nerve wracking?

2020
01:23:25,781 --> 01:23:27,460
A little bit for sure.
Yeah.

2021
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:28,653
But it depends.
It all depends on how much money you 

2022
01:23:29,531 --> 01:23:30,360
have.
Right.

2023
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,500
You know,
like for chris brown driving that car,

2024
01:23:32,501 --> 01:23:34,510
he's probably could afford 30 or 40 of 
them.

2025
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:35,141
Right.
You know.

2026
01:23:35,141 --> 01:23:36,950
So for him it's probably not that scary.
Right.

2027
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:40,120
And plus there's something about that 
world,

2028
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,160
the rapper world,
but he's not really a rapper,

2029
01:23:42,161 --> 01:23:43,240
right?
Would you call him a rapper?

2030
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:45,490
He's like a singer.
He could've been like michael,

2031
01:23:45,491 --> 01:23:46,870
janet painter.
He could have been,

2032
01:23:46,871 --> 01:23:47,704
just call him an entertainer.
There's something in that world where 

2033
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:50,764
it's very valuable to be flossy.
It's very valuable to have like floyd 

2034
01:23:55,391 --> 01:23:57,760
Mayweather type watches and gold chains.

2035
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,430
And like if you're a singer or a rapper,
you know,

2036
01:24:00,431 --> 01:24:03,700
like you represent a guy who's made it,
you know,

2037
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:06,100
like chris brown represents the guy who 
pulls up in a ferrari.

2038
01:24:06,101 --> 01:24:06,391
Like,
oh,

2039
01:24:06,391 --> 01:24:08,590
of course he's in a ferrari.
He's chris brown,

2040
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:11,500
he's canadian.
He's a famous entertainer dude.

2041
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:12,573
So for guys like that,
you can't be pulling up at some fucking 

2042
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:16,120
toyota land cruiser,
you know,

2043
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:19,290
camera cameras at worst.
I do it on a nice accord.

2044
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:22,990
The court is a very nice.
Now is this fleet of cars?

2045
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:26,080
Forty $5 million.
He's got $45,

2046
01:24:26,081 --> 01:24:28,300
million dollars worth of cars.
That's what they said.

2047
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,450
Oh my god.
How that could not be realistic.

2048
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,440
Oh,
you think it's not.

2049
01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:33,820
But he plays arenas.
Man.

2050
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,120
If this dude's that's his house,
that was another guy.

2051
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:38,243
Is that his house down there?
That one that you did get your brothers 

2052
01:24:41,321 --> 01:24:41,770
right there.

2053
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:43,390
You got gotta,
rick ross.

2054
01:24:43,391 --> 01:24:44,224
Your brother filters a little stronger,
but rick ross is a serious fucking 

2055
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:48,130
cadillac.
That's a dope cadillac.

2056
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,660
Whose is this?
This says it says,

2057
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,380
but I was trying to find them.
Look at the house though.

2058
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:54,370
jesus christ was nice.
Man.

2059
01:24:54,371 --> 01:24:57,610
I could get a nice restaurant.
You feel so peaceful,

2060
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,733
but it's just the maintaining of that 
lifestyle is what breaks a lot of those 

2061
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:02,440
guys.
Yeah,

2062
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,510
because you might make $45,
million dollars.

2063
01:25:04,511 --> 01:25:05,710
You really might make that like,
wow,

2064
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:06,544
that guy made $45,000,000,
but you're going to make $45,000,000 

2065
01:25:09,221 --> 01:25:11,950
every three years because if not,
you're going to burn through it in three

2066
01:25:11,951 --> 01:25:13,240
years.
like the way you're living.

2067
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,950
As soon as you stop making money.
Oh,

2068
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:15,784
you want?
You want to take time off and you want 

2069
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:18,700
to write some new material.
Oh,

2070
01:25:18,701 --> 01:25:19,481
you do?
Oh,

2071
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:21,530
that's weird.
Because you've got bill's mother fucker.

2072
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:22,643
You're chewing through money left and 
right and you just see some new crazy 

2073
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,240
diamond studded watch the jewelry shop 
and you're like gotta have it gotta have

2074
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:29,160
it.
It's a million Dollars.

2075
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:30,460
Got to have it.
Boom.

2076
01:25:30,461 --> 01:25:32,020
You throw a million dollars.
It's a good investment.

2077
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:35,200
You got a billion dollar watch on what?
In the fuck?

2078
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:38,800
Yeah.
I mean I lost $2,000 in a pyramid scheme

2079
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:39,634
when I was younger because I grew up in 
an area where there's a lot of pyramid 

2080
01:25:41,681 --> 01:25:43,360
schemes coming through.
How they get ya.

2081
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:45,790
Um,
they just asked me for $2,000,

2082
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:48,280
pretty much dead and I gave it to him.
And what did they say?

2083
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,480
Did they say,
well,

2084
01:25:49,481 --> 01:25:51,340
they showed you this specialized sheet 
of paper.

2085
01:25:51,341 --> 01:25:53,470
That's what they really called it.
Even specialized chart,

2086
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:55,803
which in hindsight is the most,
I mean it's the lamest name for like a 

2087
01:25:59,771 --> 01:26:01,360
pyramid scheme,
a specialized chart,

2088
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:02,213
you know?

2089
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:03,243
And then they had these different blocks
in the bottom row is green and then 

2090
01:26:05,181 --> 01:26:07,790
yellow and then red,
blue and then red.

2091
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:08,803
And each time you put 2000 and you got 
somebody else to put your money in and 

2092
01:26:11,511 --> 01:26:12,344
then you sold your and you kept moving 
up and it literally was a pyramid and 

2093
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:19,700
you'd heard like the term pyramid scheme
and was still fell for it,

2094
01:26:19,701 --> 01:26:21,080
man.
So in hindsight,

2095
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,143
I still miss that money a lot of times.
I had an old boxing coach tried to hit 

2096
01:26:24,951 --> 01:26:26,210
me up.
One of those really?

2097
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,950
Yup.
When I first moved to la,

2098
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:31,180
I was working out at this place in north
hollywood and I was uh,

2099
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:34,420
taking boxing lessons from this dude.
And uh,

2100
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:35,263
one day he came up with,
this is the clunkiest shittiest pyramid 

2101
01:26:38,901 --> 01:26:43,100
scheme pitch ever because he wasn't like
a good talker in the first place,

2102
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,120
you know?

2103
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:44,811
And he thought,
oh,

2104
01:26:44,811 --> 01:26:46,520
here's this guy.
I was on a sitcom.

2105
01:26:46,521 --> 01:26:48,830
Nobody was watching.
Nobody knew who I was back then.

2106
01:26:48,831 --> 01:26:49,664
It wasn't like he targeted me.
I was Just a dude with the gym that he 

2107
01:26:51,171 --> 01:26:52,610
thought it was an actor might have some 
money.

2108
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:53,600
Right.
You know,

2109
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:54,860
and he's like,
I'm telling you,

2110
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:57,860
I bought these rims on my truck.
I got them from that,

2111
01:26:58,660 --> 01:26:59,493
like,
oh yeah,

2112
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,770
how's it work?
He goes,

2113
01:27:00,771 --> 01:27:01,604
well,
you put in money and then after awhile 

2114
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,850
you know you could take some of the 
money out and you can get a lot of money

2115
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:05,840
that way.
I was like,

2116
01:27:05,841 --> 01:27:08,470
what is this a pyramid scheme?
He just looked at me,

2117
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,980
his eyes glazed over.
I go,

2118
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:11,450
no,
it was levels.

2119
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:12,480
He's like,
you put on this go.

2120
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:16,280
It's a pyramid scheme and we just stand 
there in the parking lot looking at each

2121
01:27:16,281 --> 01:27:18,130
other and I go,
I gotta go,

2122
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:21,020
and so I leave and then I never wear 
worked out at that gym again.

2123
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:21,441
I was like,
well,

2124
01:27:21,441 --> 01:27:22,274
I'm done.
I can't come here anymore and Just 

2125
01:27:23,641 --> 01:27:26,630
fucking guy's trying to get my money.
Plus he's a big dude.

2126
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:29,570
So it was kind of dangerous,
dangerous to say no dude.

2127
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:31,430
I used to work out with David Duke when 
I was growing up.

2128
01:27:31,431 --> 01:27:32,264
Holy shit.
We shared the back fence when I was 

2129
01:27:33,771 --> 01:27:35,900
growing up.
Holy shit.

2130
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:38,240
We used to go to.
I mean,

2131
01:27:38,241 --> 01:27:39,074
that's kind of,
I don't know if you consider the klu 

2132
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:43,290
klux klan a pyramid scheme or not,
but um,

2133
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:44,390
and he dated.
I,

2134
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:45,223
I've worked at the seafood restaurant.
I was a Bus boy over there and he dated 

2135
01:27:48,201 --> 01:27:50,780
the prettiest girl that worked at the 
seafood restaurant.

2136
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,700
Was this when he was in the kkk?
No,

2137
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:56,000
this was after his nonpracticing 
honestly seemed like a nice guy to.

2138
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:56,893
How many years ago was.

2139
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,313
This was 1995.
So that was when he was in the public 

2140
01:28:03,071 --> 01:28:04,790
guy.
He was like a big deal back then,

2141
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,080
right?
Wasn't that one,

2142
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:07,283
was it later than that?
That he was like running for public 

2143
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:11,450
office?
Let me think.

2144
01:28:11,451 --> 01:28:14,840
It was when I was younger.
He was running against edwin edwards,

2145
01:28:14,841 --> 01:28:15,960
I believe,
for public office.

2146
01:28:15,961 --> 01:28:20,150
That was probably around 1990 or 88.
I feel like he did some stuff after that

2147
01:28:20,151 --> 01:28:23,180
though on a national level.
It wasn't on a state level.

2148
01:28:23,181 --> 01:28:25,010
What is he running for?
Governor or something like that.

2149
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:27,680
He ran for governor a couple times.
yeah,

2150
01:28:27,681 --> 01:28:30,080
him and I remember the signs because 
that wouldn't.

2151
01:28:30,081 --> 01:28:32,460
Edwards was a crook allegedly.
And uh,

2152
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:37,100
David Duke was a racist and that's what 
that one of the campaign poster said,

2153
01:28:37,101 --> 01:28:39,380
don't vote for the racist vote for the 
crook.

2154
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:42,470
That was the campaign.
She's everywhere.

2155
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:43,250
She's crying.

2156
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,220
And a crook one,
that man,

2157
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:47,370
one that's quite.
We used to go to,

2158
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,460
and I'll tell you this man,
he was,

2159
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:51,040
you know,
I'm not a believer,

2160
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:52,550
this is practices,
but he was a.

2161
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:56,180
He was elected to Louisiana house of 
representatives in 1989.

2162
01:28:56,181 --> 01:29:00,350
And that year the sitting representative
resigned his seat to become a judge.

2163
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:04,110
And duke ran in the special election to 
fill a seat.

2164
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:08,520
Daily beast describes the race in 
writing the off year,

2165
01:29:08,521 --> 01:29:11,820
special election in which David Duke 
through himself,

2166
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:15,220
little media notice at first out through
him.

2167
01:29:15,221 --> 01:29:18,130
So through himself,
a little media newness notice,

2168
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:22,680
notice at first,
who turned himself to as a what a taught

2169
01:29:22,681 --> 01:29:23,514
himself as a pro life.
Fiscal conservative was known as an x 

2170
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:26,424
clan member.
He issued overtly racist language and 

2171
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:29,784
instead pointed to crime in the city 
criticizing affirmative action and 

2172
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:36,770
minority set asides.
Jada's did chest and tris with them.

2173
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:39,340
So I wouLdn't in all that,
you know,

2174
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:40,223
we just did basic workout.
Did he quit like a bitch when the reps 

2175
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:43,860
got hired?
He was a,

2176
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,210
he was,
he was an animal.

2177
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:46,440
He was,
he was strong.

2178
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:47,323
he's a strong man,
a probably a lot of people after him to 

2179
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:50,124
kill him.
Probably got to be on your p's and q's 

2180
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:53,100
possibly.
And he gave me direction.

2181
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:55,250
He just gave me direction in elliot 
didn't.

2182
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,610
Yeah,
like how to do it right.

2183
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,440
He didn't compensate a ton,
but he would.

2184
01:29:58,441 --> 01:29:59,820
Yeah.
this is how you do it.

2185
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:01,500
This is how you do it,
you know?

2186
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,720
Uh.
Did you ever ask him about the clan?

2187
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:07,230
I didn't ask him about that date.
I wanted to try and meet as lady did.

2188
01:30:07,231 --> 01:30:10,280
I was trying to mill around and see if I
can smell a payer.

2189
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,510
Her pencil loans,
you fail me to it when you were a little

2190
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:13,260
kid.

2191
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:18,260
I mean at that time I was 15.
I what was the correct bra?

2192
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,580
I've never been more direct and I wasn't
back ever.

2193
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:24,020
I tHink that's what began your whole 
idea that pussies changed,

2194
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:27,300
or maybe she was so good to like regular
girls.

2195
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,610
Oh,
I can't possibly do that.

2196
01:30:29,611 --> 01:30:32,370
So I think sober sex,
I have sober sex is for children.

2197
01:30:32,371 --> 01:30:34,550
I've always thought that.
And I think that um,

2198
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:38,030
the more you get adult,
it just,

2199
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:39,053
it just wears down and a lot of this,
a lot of this puts it comes with a lot 

2200
01:30:42,331 --> 01:30:44,720
of extra just chat or inside items these
days.

2201
01:30:44,721 --> 01:30:47,070
It's just a lot.
Is that David Duke and his girlfriend at

2202
01:30:47,071 --> 01:30:48,060
the time,
that's not the one,

2203
01:30:48,061 --> 01:30:50,820
but she looks,
she looks like she's like north Florida.

2204
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:51,763
She's kind of north Florida in about a 
woman when a woman has an american flag 

2205
01:30:54,781 --> 01:30:56,810
bikini on that just takes it to the next
level.

2206
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:57,810
Hell yeah,
dude.

2207
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:00,240
Just down.
Yeah.

2208
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:02,550
She's down for you.
That's not her either,

2209
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:05,410
but the interesting.
I tell him,

2210
01:31:05,450 --> 01:31:08,640
yeah,
the 90 to vote an interactive timeline.

2211
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:09,930
Look at that.
But he is,

2212
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,720
he's a big man.
Look at the got wide shoulders and said,

2213
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:13,554
man,
you gotta lift weights if everybody 

2214
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:16,380
wants to kick your ass because you're a 
racist.

2215
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:18,570
Yeah,
we got to be ready at all times.

2216
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:19,703
You know,
you pull into the wrong fucking 

2217
01:31:20,311 --> 01:31:21,870
convenience store at 2:00 in the 
morning.

2218
01:31:21,871 --> 01:31:24,960
You might get the fuck beat out of you.
That's true dude.

2219
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:27,780
That dude is that dude.
I saw you on tv,

2220
01:31:27,781 --> 01:31:29,830
man.
You that x kkk dude.

2221
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:33,560
Like what?
Why?

2222
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,333
What are you saying?
picking up stuff in the laundromat and 

2223
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:42,640
he started to get a 40 ounce cause 
that's crazy,

2224
01:31:43,891 --> 01:31:44,724
man.
I probably got to be real careful where 

2225
01:31:45,451 --> 01:31:46,710
you go if you're a guy like that.

2226
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:48,500
Yeah man.
I guess dude,

2227
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:50,580
racism was pretty popular.
I feel like we're always from,

2228
01:31:50,581 --> 01:31:52,890
you know.
Was it popular when you were growing up?

2229
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:53,963
Um,
boston was definitely more racist than 

2230
01:31:56,281 --> 01:31:57,114
san francisco,
but Florida was more racist in boston 

2231
01:31:59,711 --> 01:32:00,544
for sure.
Yeah,

2232
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,300
I saw I had way more racist shit in 
Florida.

2233
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:07,210
I think that I did way more than san 
francisco.

2234
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,133
I remember I had,
I convinced my mother that I did not 

2235
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:13,180
know what the word nigger meant.
I didn't know what it meant.

2236
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:14,320
And she was mad at me.
She's like,

2237
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:15,670
you know what it means?
I go,

2238
01:32:15,671 --> 01:32:17,680
no,
I don't tell me what it means.

2239
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:20,250
She had to tell me what it means.
I couldn't believe it.

2240
01:32:20,251 --> 01:32:21,084
I was like,
what?

2241
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:22,660
Because someone had said it at school.
It was like,

2242
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:25,930
what?
I was trying to pretend that I knew what

2243
01:32:25,931 --> 01:32:28,060
the kid was talking about and then I got
home and asked my mom.

2244
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:28,953
Yeah.
She also got Mad at me when I asked her 

2245
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:34,880
out how people had made babies.
She didn't think I knew.

2246
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:37,300
She thought I knew it.
He knew all this.

2247
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,770
She goes,
she goes,

2248
01:32:38,771 --> 01:32:40,450
I'm going to tell you,
and you just gotta laugh.

2249
01:32:40,451 --> 01:32:40,871
I go,
no,

2250
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:42,610
I'm not.
And then she tells me.

2251
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,380
She's like,
I was seven.

2252
01:32:44,381 --> 01:32:45,214
I'll never forget this.
I was in the car with my sister and she 

2253
01:32:47,531 --> 01:32:49,300
goes,
man puts his penis in a woman's vagina.

2254
01:32:49,301 --> 01:32:51,680
I'm like,
fuck.

2255
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:54,760
It fell to the floor back then.
We didn't even wear seat belts,

2256
01:32:54,761 --> 01:32:57,310
you know?
I just fell right down onto the floor.

2257
01:32:57,311 --> 01:33:01,300
I was slapping the fucking floor of a 
1971 barracuda.

2258
01:33:01,301 --> 01:33:04,030
I thought it was the funniest shit ever.
A man.

2259
01:33:04,031 --> 01:33:04,841
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

2260
01:33:04,841 --> 01:33:05,674
Wait.
You make people buy a man and she's 

2261
01:33:06,991 --> 01:33:07,511
like,
I knew it,

2262
01:33:07,511 --> 01:33:08,410
I knew you were going to laugh.

2263
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,980
Like,
what the fuck's wrong with lab?

2264
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:11,860
do you think there will be a more 
creative way?

2265
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:13,420
Kind of a little bit,
you know,

2266
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,480
like maybe you have to like hide some,
like,

2267
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:16,443
like hide it in their ears or something.
like you got to sneak semen into 

2268
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:21,010
somebody or when they're not looking or 
just something a little bit more.

2269
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,413
I don't know what was a fucked up way to
be introduced to it because I didn't 

2270
01:33:24,701 --> 01:33:26,140
know.
And I asked her and she said,

2271
01:33:26,141 --> 01:33:28,510
you're gonna laugh,
you're gonna laugh.

2272
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,010
And then I'm like,
is it funny?

2273
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:32,290
Like now you gotta tell me because I'm 
like,

2274
01:33:32,291 --> 01:33:33,250
now I got to hear it.
I'm like,

2275
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,113
no,
I'm not gonna.

2276
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:35,163
And then when she tells me that I left 
and it kinda pisses me off now thinking 

2277
01:33:37,271 --> 01:33:38,380
about it.
I was Only seven.

2278
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:40,060
Fuck,
was I supposed to know?

2279
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:41,160
Yeah,
you weren't supposed to know it.

2280
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,300
That how the fuck was she?
But she was like,

2281
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,193
don't you already know?
She just assumed I knew everything to 

2282
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:48,160
like.
My mom wasn'T big on lessons.

2283
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,320
She was like,
you know,

2284
01:33:49,321 --> 01:33:50,120
I'm like,
I don't know.

2285
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:53,150
Tell me dude.
I remember.

2286
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:55,990
I can't really tell a seven year old.
I know.

2287
01:33:56,110 --> 01:33:58,090
I know some 11 year olds.
I wouldn't even tell them that.

2288
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:00,910
How you make a baby.
I want her to know,

2289
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:06,060
but I think a seven year old in 1974 was
just way different than a seven year old

2290
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:08,044
in 2016 or 17.
Seven year olds back then were little 

2291
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:11,793
animals.
They're little fucking savage monkey 

2292
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:16,750
people were like monkey people.
We didn't have any internet.

2293
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:17,584
There's three channels on television.
You had to get up to change with your 

2294
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:21,460
hand.
One of your friends was missing.

2295
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:22,563
People just disappeared.
They would go to the woods and it never 

2296
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:25,180
find them again.

2297
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:26,403
You left the house.
There's.

2298
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,110
There was a fucking answer.
Machines it tells in high school,

2299
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:30,183
nobody even knew where anybody was.
No one had a portable phone until well 

2300
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:35,620
into my adult years.
Yeah,

2301
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:36,493
like he came back in the stuff from 
summer for school and just hope 

2302
01:34:38,021 --> 01:34:39,970
everybody was still alive.
He couldn't find,

2303
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:41,980
you have to go to your friend's house.
You'd knock on their door.

2304
01:34:41,981 --> 01:34:45,050
Hey ms dot wilson's mike home and they 
let you in like,

2305
01:34:45,051 --> 01:34:45,821
hey,
what's up dude?

2306
01:34:45,821 --> 01:34:49,000
Like you had to find that shoe.
I know you let's go hang out.

2307
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:49,863
You know,
I have to drive to each other and he'd 

2308
01:34:51,731 --> 01:34:54,010
have to make some very specific 
instructions.

2309
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:58,010
So come over my house around 6:00,
the warm out in front and I'll know and

2310
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,651
I'll come out.
Okay.

2311
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:01,790
Okay.
And then you pull up mom,

2312
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:04,280
you got to go.
I remember that shit.

2313
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:05,780
That was awesome.
Did I,

2314
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:06,903
I just,
I,

2315
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:07,773
I just miss the old days when the only 
way to communicate you like it'd be in 

2316
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:11,084
front of people.
Just good information like information 

2317
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:16,980
you got through rumor and basically 
mystics or hope you know.

2318
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:19,820
The other thing,
the communication we had was all looking

2319
01:35:19,821 --> 01:35:20,654
at each other or at the very least 
hearing each other's voice on the phone 

2320
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:26,090
and very little shit was the only girl 
broke up with you over the phone.

2321
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:27,650
Oh,
that's cold blooded.

2322
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,530
She didn't look at,
you knoW,

2323
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:30,590
do.
She called me up,

2324
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,240
said it's over,
motherfucker,

2325
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:35,090
but she had to make contact with you.
At least you couldn't text you.

2326
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,510
It's over bitch.
Yeah,

2327
01:35:36,590 --> 01:35:37,760
I'm fucking your friend right now.

2328
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,010
Back then you had to actually make 
contact.

2329
01:35:43,011 --> 01:35:45,080
This is just not working out.
I need my space.

2330
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:47,840
No,
you had to hear it.

2331
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:48,743
You couldn't just look at it on text and
then you had to hang up in your house 

2332
01:35:51,921 --> 01:35:53,630
and some of your house and be like,
who was it?

2333
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:57,290
And then you had to expound to them when
it just occurred.

2334
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:59,030
Dude.
and people will think it's hilarious.

2335
01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:04,790
She broke your heart pussy dude.
I remember this.

2336
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,910
Uh,
we will after this dance one time.

2337
01:36:07,911 --> 01:36:10,010
First time a buddy of mine ever hooked 
up with a girl,

2338
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:11,133
um,
he touched her genital you after this 

2339
01:36:12,741 --> 01:36:13,371
dance,
you know,

2340
01:36:13,371 --> 01:36:14,204
we'd had a dance at the school and he'd 
been touching her genitalia out in the 

2341
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:17,804
woods actually.
And he was our first one of our buddies 

2342
01:36:19,101 --> 01:36:20,180
to do that,
you know,

2343
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:23,870
so she ends up leaving and we're all 
hanging out around the,

2344
01:36:23,871 --> 01:36:25,430
uh,
my buddy's house from this fire.

2345
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,353
and we're like.

2346
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:29,563
And we kept like doing different stuff,
like with our skin and our mouths and 

2347
01:36:31,881 --> 01:36:34,370
that doesn't feel like,
oh god,

2348
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,830
like kind of reenacted a pussy,
you know,

2349
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:39,230
like trying to just basically be a 
vagina for a minute.

2350
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:43,280
And uh,
and then my buddy's father comes out,

2351
01:36:43,281 --> 01:36:44,990
right?
And he sees you guys making out,

2352
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:48,580
know what it is.
Like what's going on.

2353
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:50,720
We're trying to recreate pussy.
Whoa.

2354
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,443
Okay.
I'll leave you guys alone for way too 

2355
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:55,790
long.
You got some fucked up ideas.

2356
01:36:55,791 --> 01:37:00,791
We're going To have to cleanse them.
it's just breaks out the fucking liquor.

2357
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,820
The only thing I could do,
I had to,

2358
01:37:04,821 --> 01:37:05,980
I had to get.
I'm so drunk.

2359
01:37:05,981 --> 01:37:09,580
I forgot what happened.
But uh,

2360
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:13,040
could you imagine dad goes to those?
Sit the fuck down.

2361
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:14,960
Sit the fuck down.
Comes out with a jug of whiskey,

2362
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:16,250
drink,
drink,

2363
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:20,450
tastes shut the fuck up and want to be 
fucked up for the rest of your life.

2364
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:22,490
Or do you want to forget everything that
happened so far?

2365
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:26,260
That's awesome man.
And he knows stuff,

2366
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:29,090
but the dead ended up smelling my 
buddy's hand,

2367
01:37:29,091 --> 01:37:31,910
right where the posts he came through.
And then,

2368
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:34,340
and he knew,
oh well we told,

2369
01:37:34,341 --> 01:37:36,580
we told them what had happened.
We tell,

2370
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:37,783
we tell them,

2371
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:46,960
but that just shows you how bad our 
sense of smell is.

2372
01:37:46,961 --> 01:37:48,940
You have to be that close to somebody 
saying,

2373
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:53,320
I know like a shark could smell your 
pussy when you were in like ankle.

2374
01:37:53,321 --> 01:37:55,260
Deep in tHe water.
It's a mile away,

2375
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:56,600
dum,

2376
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:56,980
dum,
dum,

2377
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:57,331
dum,
dum,

2378
01:37:57,331 --> 01:37:57,721
dum,
dum,

2379
01:37:57,721 --> 01:37:58,554
dum,
dum.

2380
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:01,390
It's a medium rare and key biscayne is 
not.

2381
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:02,243
Some speculation about certain animal 
attacks occur when women are 

2382
01:38:04,681 --> 01:38:06,450
menstruating,
like the animals,

2383
01:38:06,451 --> 01:38:07,284
more likely to see.
Is that bullshit or is that like some 

2384
01:38:08,821 --> 01:38:11,610
human human rumor?
You know,

2385
01:38:11,611 --> 01:38:14,780
some silly.
I believe that did.

2386
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:18,090
I would have never been to Maine.
If somebody's bleeding in your pool,

2387
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,013
you could attack them.
I wonder if you think about it like 

2388
01:38:21,001 --> 01:38:22,230
that.
Like if somebody come to my house,

2389
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:24,450
they're bleeding in my house and don't 
even care about it.

2390
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:27,660
But you get mad getting fucking attack.
You get attacked.

2391
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:29,070
Yeah.
If it's in my carpet or something,

2392
01:38:29,071 --> 01:38:31,650
you're standing for girls is.
If you have one of those 19,

2393
01:38:31,651 --> 01:38:33,630
70 shag carpet,
all white.

2394
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:34,703
Please take your shoes off at the door 
and this girl comes in with some old 

2395
01:38:37,021 --> 01:38:37,854
school gym shorts on and a really wonky 
ass pad leaking like have like a god 

2396
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,430
damn deer got hit with a rage broadhead 
and she's leaking all over.

2397
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:50,280
She's leaking all over your shag carpet.
What do you do?

2398
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:52,680
You attack her.
Do you help her out as a friend and just

2399
01:38:52,681 --> 01:38:54,750
wash your car?
Man,

2400
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:57,480
you get the woman a towel.
You've got to hire an archer.

2401
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:01,410
I think at that point did not.
If somebody is doing that in my house,

2402
01:39:01,411 --> 01:39:04,020
do they need to learn?
I wouldn't do that to you.

2403
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:06,330
You don't do that to me.
You don't bleed like that.

2404
01:39:06,331 --> 01:39:08,640
That's going to be a huge drag.
If women just bled.

2405
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:09,713
Yeah,
but if you are purposely just dripped 

2406
01:39:10,491 --> 01:39:11,324
dropping her in my living room and you 
know that I love this carpet and you 

2407
01:39:14,161 --> 01:39:16,590
know that I probably can't afford new 
carpet.

2408
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:17,843
There was a,
there was this thing where these women 

2409
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,230
were letting their periods run down the 
legs,

2410
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:25,620
like in some sort of a protest.
I forget what the protest was about,

2411
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:27,023
but I remember watching that going,
we have absolutely failed as a human 

2412
01:39:31,501 --> 01:39:32,334
being if we're so in denial of the 
biological process that it's somehow or 

2413
01:39:37,231 --> 01:39:42,231
another a protest to let your menstrual 
blood rolled down your legs somewhere.

2414
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:47,370
There's been some serious errors in 
communication.

2415
01:39:47,371 --> 01:39:48,204
If that's a statement,
if you were making a statement by 

2416
01:39:49,981 --> 01:39:50,814
letting period,
like it's either a massive failure in 

2417
01:39:53,401 --> 01:39:57,600
the sight of men to not communicate 
that.

2418
01:39:57,601 --> 01:40:00,060
It's no big deaL.
It's just a natural cycle of life.

2419
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,890
It's a part of life doesn't freak us 
out.

2420
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:02,903
It shouldn't freak you out.
Let's figure out how you can get 

2421
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:05,363
tampons.
Let's make sure you get take care of 

2422
01:40:06,391 --> 01:40:07,224
just like the same way we make sure 
people have toilet paper in the 

2423
01:40:08,821 --> 01:40:09,700
bathroom,
right?

2424
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,750
You don't just go shitting your pants 
and the of protest,

2425
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:13,613
right?
It's a.

2426
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:16,740
It's a Hygiene issue,
like it shouldn't be a pro,

2427
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:17,663
a good gender based protest.
Like how bad is our lines of 

2428
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:22,404
communication?
You have to get where women in any way 

2429
01:40:24,541 --> 01:40:25,374
think that letting your pussy bleed down
your leg is reclaiming some sort of 

2430
01:40:29,761 --> 01:40:31,200
power.
I don't think so.

2431
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:33,000
I think it's.
I think it's tacky.

2432
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:36,031
I do,
man.

2433
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:36,864
I don't and I don't.
I honestly don't know a woman that will 

2434
01:40:38,201 --> 01:40:39,450
do it or really want to know.
Well,

2435
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:41,850
I don't want to even happens by 
accident.

2436
01:40:41,851 --> 01:40:43,080
It's not.
It doesn't freak me out.

2437
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:45,590
I don't get freaked out.
Freaked out by it.

2438
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:46,820
Some people do though,
right?

2439
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:47,930
Yeah.
I don't get freaked out by,

2440
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:49,980
you know,
a period or somebody,

2441
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,700
that kind of stuff.
I just don't know.

2442
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:53,583
Yeah.
Gone wrong with the communication where 

2443
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:56,470
that becomes a protest.
Yeah.

2444
01:40:56,471 --> 01:40:58,030
Like I don't want to.
I don't want to.

2445
01:40:58,390 --> 01:41:00,190
I don't.
Maybe it's wrong of me to say.

2446
01:41:00,191 --> 01:41:02,500
I don't want to see that.
Maybe that's what the protest is about.

2447
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,230
I get it.
I get it on both sides,

2448
01:41:05,231 --> 01:41:06,064
but it seems so unnecessary.
What was the reason they were doing 

2449
01:41:08,051 --> 01:41:10,000
that?
Yeah,

2450
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:11,950
it was really recently.
Well,

2451
01:41:11,951 --> 01:41:13,810
why aren't men protesting more about 
anything,

2452
01:41:13,811 --> 01:41:14,230
do you think?

2453
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:16,390
Have you noticed that there's not as 
many tests.

2454
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:19,960
We're trying to get sex,
tampon tax.

2455
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:21,890
That's it.
Okay.

2456
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:24,890
How long ago was this?
Pretty reasonably 15.

2457
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:26,620
Oh hmm.
Yeah.

2458
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:29,140
Well I'm thinking like more recent 
events.

2459
01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:34,190
It's like a drip in events where women 
protest by letting their menstrual blood

2460
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:35,194
running down their legs,
school that place and prepare for some 

2461
01:41:37,031 --> 01:41:37,864
inquiries from the fbi to see some 
footage you probably don't want to say 

2462
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:43,070
and they're going to come to your house.
Yeah.

2463
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:43,691
I never,
uh,

2464
01:41:43,691 --> 01:41:47,140
I remember protesting in college about 
the soccer coach.

2465
01:41:47,150 --> 01:41:51,370
Had the girls' soccer team on Korea team
when I remember protesting about that.

2466
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:52,204
You protested?
Yep.

2467
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:54,790
Me and to my buddies and I even remember
this,

2468
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:56,320
uh,
at the last minute,

2469
01:41:56,321 --> 01:41:57,154
the coaches are out there and meet the 
local news is out there like 

2470
01:41:59,441 --> 01:42:00,790
interviewing us.
We all have signs,

2471
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:02,470
you know,
and,

2472
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:04,720
and a handicap fell on mine.

2473
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,360
He was in,
he was in,

2474
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,410
he had that carl sagan disease or 
whatever that is.

2475
01:42:08,411 --> 01:42:09,161
Who's that guy?
Who knows?

2476
01:42:09,161 --> 01:42:10,540
Even the stars.
Stephen hawking.

2477
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:12,550
He showed up in that van,
you know,

2478
01:42:12,551 --> 01:42:14,200
with a loudspeaker on.
And he's like,

2479
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:15,780
wait,
got rain forest.

2480
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:18,970
And then the little ramp came down and 
he came rolling out with a picket sign.

2481
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:20,470
Wow.
And then he died.

2482
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,670
He actually died.
He died,

2483
01:42:21,671 --> 01:42:23,380
um,
in the float a few years later.

2484
01:42:23,381 --> 01:42:24,250
That fella.
But yeah,

2485
01:42:24,251 --> 01:42:27,400
protest one time in the katrina flood.
It couldn't get his medication.

2486
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:29,560
Whoa.
Fuck.

2487
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:31,420
You don't think about those kinds of 
things,

2488
01:42:31,421 --> 01:42:32,440
you know,
right.

2489
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:34,780
Medication gets denied of people when 
they die.

2490
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:38,080
They become a casualty of the disaster.
Fuck man.

2491
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:38,973
So why wAs he given the girls creatine?
What's dangerous about giving girls 

2492
01:42:41,141 --> 01:42:41,974
creatures that come out?
And we just did it like people didn't 

2493
01:42:43,601 --> 01:42:44,434
know about it.
It's like the member of the first time 

2494
01:42:45,311 --> 01:42:46,300
creating hit the market.

2495
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,590
Everybody was like,
you know,

2496
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,270
it works,
you definitely work.

2497
01:42:49,271 --> 01:42:50,890
But it made you gain a little bit of 
water.

2498
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:53,680
Waterways get a little little chubby in 
the face.

2499
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:55,060
But what,
what does the,

2500
01:42:55,061 --> 01:42:56,290
uh,
negative ass is?

2501
01:42:56,291 --> 01:43:00,010
Was there a negative?
The coaches just take it and they didn't

2502
01:43:00,011 --> 01:43:01,270
know.
Oh.

2503
01:43:01,271 --> 01:43:02,104
So the coaches didn't even know.
They just wanted some sort of an edge 

2504
01:43:04,031 --> 01:43:05,620
and hadn't been established whether it 
was safe yet.

2505
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:06,700
Yeah.
Oh,

2506
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,080
I see.
And I was just kind of like,

2507
01:43:08,081 --> 01:43:10,110
we got antsy and got out there and 
started protesting.

2508
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:11,463
Yeah.
There's not a lot of protests going on 

2509
01:43:12,221 --> 01:43:14,020
except.
But when there is a protest,

2510
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:17,620
it's almost always liberal people that 
are protesting these days,

2511
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:18,713
it seems to be like protesting.
Like some speaker at some university 

2512
01:43:21,971 --> 01:43:22,600
tHey'll,
you know,

2513
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:26,110
have some speaker and they'll be 
protesting them or you know,

2514
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:29,180
it'll be like the women's march as being
as protest.

2515
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:30,043
Yeah.
All these protests against trump left 

2516
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:33,903
wing marches.
People say that the tea party had some 

2517
01:43:36,131 --> 01:43:36,964
massive protest,
but I can't find anything that shows 

2518
01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:41,950
there's been any numbers that were 
anything close to that women's march,

2519
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:44,830
especially in la.
Something that said there was speculated

2520
01:43:44,831 --> 01:43:48,280
numbers that weren't proven upwards of 
one to 2 million people.

2521
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:50,563
One or two places.
Did they had any people back then 

2522
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,420
because I heard that crowd or go.
Yeah.

2523
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:58,880
But the thing is Like when you,
when you're talking about that,

2524
01:43:58,881 --> 01:44:02,810
like you got to think of what's 
confirmed confirmed numbers.

2525
01:44:02,811 --> 01:44:04,530
Like we have satellite images now that 
are,

2526
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:07,250
that are different than what they had 
back then.

2527
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,230
So like if you look at the,
uh,

2528
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:11,930
like the footage that they were talking 
about with the inauguration,

2529
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:13,003
it's pretty clear when you look at the 
full 24 hours sped up footage of how 

2530
01:44:17,691 --> 01:44:20,510
many people were in the crowd versus how
many people in the crowd.

2531
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:22,460
For a mama there was more people.
For oBama,

2532
01:44:22,461 --> 01:44:24,890
it's pretty clear.
It looks like a massive amount of people

2533
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:27,530
when you look at it on the ground.
but overall,

2534
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:30,110
and you look at the big picture from 
above,

2535
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:31,093
it's not as many people.
So knowing that they tried to conflate 

2536
01:44:34,221 --> 01:44:35,054
those numbers,
they try to inflate those numbers and 

2537
01:44:37,131 --> 01:44:37,964
make it seem like,
I mean with a lot of people were saying 

2538
01:44:39,921 --> 01:44:40,754
it and they even said it on television.
that was the biggest crowd for 

2539
01:44:42,381 --> 01:44:43,750
inauguration ever.
We didn't know.

2540
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:44,593
Now we know now that's not true.
So maybe that was the same thing with 

2541
01:44:46,971 --> 01:44:48,290
the tea party.
We really don't know.

2542
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:50,810
It's tough to tell unless it happened 
tomorrow.

2543
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:54,560
Like if they had it tomorrow and you 
could use the same modern methods of,

2544
01:44:54,780 --> 01:44:57,290
you know,
figuring out how many people in an area.

2545
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:01,820
But they said that they think there was 
970,000 people at the women's march,

2546
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:03,400
just in los angeles.
Oh yeah.

2547
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:04,730
I heard that'S the biggest thing that 
ever happened.

2548
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:05,773
And it was all over the country.
I mean they were in pretty much every 

2549
01:45:08,211 --> 01:45:09,021
big city.
Right.

2550
01:45:09,021 --> 01:45:10,580
Didn't they have a bunch of them?
Yeah.

2551
01:45:10,581 --> 01:45:11,414
You think it was a lot of dudes who were
like hoping that like there was an 

2552
01:45:12,861 --> 01:45:14,900
attack or something.
So they lose their wife or something,

2553
01:45:14,901 --> 01:45:15,734
you know?

2554
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:20,780
I don't know about a lot of dudes,
but it probably at least one guy.

2555
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:21,920
Oh,
there's more than one.

2556
01:45:21,921 --> 01:45:22,391
I bet.
Yeah.

2557
01:45:22,391 --> 01:45:24,110
it's 50 least 50 guys,
you know.

2558
01:45:24,111 --> 01:45:24,944
There was some dude who like hugs,
vice extra heart thinking that like 

2559
01:45:26,961 --> 01:45:27,610
some,
you know,

2560
01:45:27,610 --> 01:45:32,560
militant islamic or non islamic group 
was going to get them to be it,

2561
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:34,700
I guess.
Anyway,

2562
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:39,760
I never been involved in any terrorism.
I haven't been either.

2563
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,360
Yeah.
The,

2564
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,193
anything.
There was some stuff going around the 

2565
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,153
end of last year with mike pence and a 
house bill about an abortion bill in 

2566
01:45:47,501 --> 01:45:48,334
Indiana,
which is bringing up some more stuff 

2567
01:45:49,841 --> 01:45:52,300
about the taxes on tampons all over the 
country.

2568
01:45:52,530 --> 01:45:53,363
That's what it was.
And so these girls were letting their 

2569
01:45:54,961 --> 01:45:57,650
menstrual cycles run down their legs 
that the other satellite.

2570
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:00,150
I just.
I'm okay with saying I don't like that.

2571
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,760
It makes me feel uncomfortable and I can
feel that way.

2572
01:46:02,761 --> 01:46:04,380
I feel like I can't even say that 
anymore.

2573
01:46:04,381 --> 01:46:05,214
Like I'm on the girls side.
Why the fuck are you raising taxes on 

2574
01:46:07,441 --> 01:46:08,550
tampons?
Yeah,

2575
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:11,310
but you want to make more money off 
something that people have to buy.

2576
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:12,480
that's fucked up.
Yeah,

2577
01:46:12,481 --> 01:46:13,314
that is fucked up.
It's fucked up because you have to buy 

2578
01:46:14,821 --> 01:46:15,654
tampons and men don't have to buy it.
So if men decide make them pay for the 

2579
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:19,590
fucking tampons,
but here's a tax.

2580
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:21,360
They're just,
they're just lazy and dumb.

2581
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:22,373
Trying to figure out where to shove 
taxes and don't make any sense like 

2582
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:25,550
tampons.
What or how,

2583
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:27,990
but what else?
Net tAx vitamins you piece of shit.

2584
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:30,870
What are you going to tax healthy food.
Fucking assholes.

2585
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:32,670
Why would it like seeing just something,
a little craft here?

2586
01:46:32,671 --> 01:46:35,940
I feel like maybe take tampons,
put them on the end of a arrow,

2587
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:37,590
firearm into the capital.
You know what I'm saying?

2588
01:46:37,591 --> 01:46:39,750
like something that really know what I'm
saying.

2589
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,850
I know what you're saying,
but that's dangerous.

2590
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:42,893
Yeah.
I guess I just wondered if you died 

2591
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:46,410
because you got hit with an arrow that 
had a tampon in the end of it.

2592
01:46:46,830 --> 01:46:48,840
Right through your eyeball,
right into your brain.

2593
01:46:48,841 --> 01:46:51,750
You dead and it's sticking out of your 
head like a planted tree.

2594
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:55,720
But at least the blood flow stopped,
right?

2595
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:57,103
At least you know what women go through.
I had this group online for a while 

2596
01:46:59,641 --> 01:47:00,474
where you could put a tampon in your 
butt to get know what women go through 

2597
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:03,444
hollow.
She had to put a tampon in your blood 

2598
01:47:04,261 --> 01:47:05,880
for like three or four days to kind of,
uh,

2599
01:47:05,881 --> 01:47:07,470
um,
no they don't.

2600
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:09,570
Unless they're doing it wrong.
Jesus christ,

2601
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:12,260
they go through these to put in there.
But no,

2602
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:13,133
they had this group online about six or 
seven years ago where you put a tampon 

2603
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:16,374
in your buttocks to a experience.
So man can experience what it's like to 

2604
01:47:19,111 --> 01:47:21,660
have at least something in his body all 
the time like that.

2605
01:47:21,661 --> 01:47:22,494
Yeah,
it's fucked up.

2606
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:24,690
Um,
but you know what man,

2607
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:28,230
there's a big problem also with like the
shame of it.

2608
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,200
It's weird that people have like so 
ignorant.

2609
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,310
Silly.
I agree.

2610
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:34,260
This is the shame of period.
Like,

2611
01:47:34,261 --> 01:47:35,100
oh my god,
I have my period.

2612
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:36,640
EveryBody run,
you know,

2613
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:37,300
like,
well,

2614
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:38,133
what do you think that started from now?
Do you think it's something that we 

2615
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:42,240
learned or something that for sure,
ignorance,

2616
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:45,510
ignorance.
I'm like a puritan values.

2617
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:47,243
This isn't making sense.
Like why would you be scared of periods 

2618
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,430
because we all beat up period,
didn't we?

2619
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,440
And now what happens when you live?
That's right.

2620
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:56,520
And we made it through and what not.
What do you think about the iud?

2621
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:57,443
And they have things like that now in 
women where they're stopped and their 

2622
01:47:59,071 --> 01:47:59,904
periods.
Is That scary you think are not scare 

2623
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:03,380
birth control pills.
Do that cycle.

2624
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:05,580
Um,
off and on to get their periods back.

2625
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:06,570
Yeah,
yeah,

2626
01:48:06,990 --> 01:48:07,823
yeah.
The birth control pills have positive 

2627
01:48:08,911 --> 01:48:11,220
benefits though.
Like some women take birth control pills

2628
01:48:11,221 --> 01:48:12,330
for certain ailments.

2629
01:48:12,910 --> 01:48:13,743
You know,
that was one of the big things that was 

2630
01:48:15,391 --> 01:48:16,224
an issue back when rush limbaugh got in 
trouble for saying some girl's a slut 

2631
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:22,890
because she wanted birth control pills 
to be paid for by insurance.

2632
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,140
Remember that?
And people got real mad at him.

2633
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:26,790
I mean it just sounds like something he 
would say.

2634
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:27,923
Yeah,
it was a big issue because I think some 

2635
01:48:30,301 --> 01:48:31,134
women for their own health,
they actually need birth control pills 

2636
01:48:34,681 --> 01:48:38,700
and not just for a sex women that don't 
even have sex.

2637
01:48:38,701 --> 01:48:42,000
Like it regulates certain diseases and 
issues that they might have.

2638
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:45,600
So there's apparently more than one 
reason to take that stuff.

2639
01:48:45,601 --> 01:48:46,434
I don't know.
Yeah,

2640
01:48:46,690 --> 01:48:48,060
I mean I think,
I mean I think they should,

2641
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:48,913
you know,
they should be able to choose what they 

2642
01:48:50,011 --> 01:48:50,761
need,
you know,

2643
01:48:50,761 --> 01:48:54,450
like which just crazy to tax it,
like the extra taxes and bonds,

2644
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:58,570
finding some money some other way or 
even just ask dude's ass.

2645
01:48:58,570 --> 01:48:59,670
People say,
hey,

2646
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:01,710
you know,
women are having a tough time or we need

2647
01:49:01,711 --> 01:49:03,120
extra money.
Dudes are going to go,

2648
01:49:03,121 --> 01:49:03,954
fuck you think I throw a couple extra 
dollars out there for a lady that needs 

2649
01:49:06,811 --> 01:49:07,750
a couple,
you know,

2650
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:08,990
good for you.
Yeah.

2651
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:12,410
You goT a good heart.
I guess,

2652
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:14,280
man,
I would do that day.

2653
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:15,600
I believe you.
You know?

2654
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,390
I mean it's definitely.
It's just,

2655
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:18,720
it's a,
it's a necessity.

2656
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:21,020
Yeah.
Like whether tampons or maxi pads,

2657
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:21,963
it's some sort of a necessity.
We're just lucky we don't have that 

2658
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:25,500
issue.
But if that was an issue for men,

2659
01:49:25,501 --> 01:49:29,670
like if men bled out of our ball sack 
for ball sack leaked once a month.

2660
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:31,013
If that was the case,
how pissed would be if they started 

2661
01:49:34,201 --> 01:49:36,990
making tampons and you got a tax 
tampons,

2662
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:39,870
you'll make more money off me in my 
balls.

2663
01:49:39,871 --> 01:49:41,190
Bleeding.
Fuck you.

2664
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:42,250
We will be so mad.

2665
01:49:42,290 --> 01:49:44,190
Oh,
we'd be fucking furious.

2666
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:45,320
We wouldn't handle it.
Well dude,

2667
01:49:45,330 --> 01:49:46,650
if we had,
if we had that,

2668
01:49:46,651 --> 01:49:48,490
we would not handle it well.
Did I be scared?

2669
01:49:48,491 --> 01:49:49,324
I'll probably stay indoors.
I'd rather you get nervous a lot and we 

2670
01:49:52,421 --> 01:49:53,254
would definitely want birth control to 
be paid for by the government in a 

2671
01:49:55,391 --> 01:49:57,280
heartbeat.
I'm on with that.

2672
01:49:57,770 --> 01:49:58,301
That's true,
man.

2673
01:49:58,301 --> 01:49:59,134
It's a great way to put it actually,
when you really put on yourself and see 

2674
01:50:00,641 --> 01:50:01,930
what you would do,
you know?

2675
01:50:02,110 --> 01:50:02,943
Yeah.
That's why when you look at a guy like 

2676
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:04,563
mike pence who you know who's the vice 
president of the United States 

2677
01:50:06,851 --> 01:50:07,684
respectfully,
but if someone told you he was a dick 

2678
01:50:08,631 --> 01:50:09,464
head,
you wouldn't be shocked Just by looking 

2679
01:50:10,691 --> 01:50:11,524
at them.
It looks like every high school 

2680
01:50:12,611 --> 01:50:14,310
assistant,
like football coach,

2681
01:50:14,311 --> 01:50:16,480
you know,
is that crazy?

2682
01:50:16,481 --> 01:50:19,150
Like who ended up in less than or like 
dating a girl.

2683
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:22,600
You know who those were from.
My high school was a spanish teacher.

2684
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:24,460
Really cool guy.
We had a science teacher,

2685
01:50:24,461 --> 01:50:25,294
really cool guy that ever talked about 
come buka a juice was this science 

2686
01:50:29,411 --> 01:50:30,161
teacher of ours.
He's like,

2687
01:50:30,161 --> 01:50:31,750
it's going to be the future.
Yeah.

2688
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:33,430
He goes,
it's going to be the future.

2689
01:50:33,431 --> 01:50:34,450
And were like,
you're nuts.

2690
01:50:34,451 --> 01:50:37,360
And then even though it was almost 
married to a girl,

2691
01:50:37,361 --> 01:50:39,190
they busted him.
How old was she?

2692
01:50:39,870 --> 01:50:41,400
Oh,
I don't know man.

2693
01:50:41,401 --> 01:50:42,234
I'm.
SHe was probably 16 or something and I 

2694
01:50:44,111 --> 01:50:45,430
used today.
I used to work for his brother,

2695
01:50:45,431 --> 01:50:46,264
actually the dude because he has wishing
well company buy us nice to work for 

2696
01:50:48,731 --> 01:50:51,070
them.
I think wishing wells when were popular.

2697
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:53,740
I think when I was in high school this 
dude got away with it.

2698
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:55,960
I think it was like one of them legal 
deals,

2699
01:50:56,260 --> 01:51:00,460
like it was just legal,
legal,

2700
01:51:00,490 --> 01:51:01,720
but he was a cool guy.

2701
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:02,653
yeah.
It was a fun guy and the 17 year old 

2702
01:51:03,851 --> 01:51:06,790
girl and him hooked up and everybody 
found out.

2703
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:07,510
Well,
I mean,

2704
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:08,343
could you see that happening though?
Say you're a teacher and you're 22 at a 

2705
01:51:10,211 --> 01:51:11,590
high school.
It was only 25.

2706
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:13,383
He was 25 and she was 17,
but he thought he was a 150,000 years 

2707
01:51:17,321 --> 01:51:20,970
old when you're 17 and the teacher's 25.
Really?

2708
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,180
That dude is anxious for a quarter 
fucking century.

2709
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,430
Yeah.
I mean he wasn't even.

2710
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:29,350
he was eight years old and this girl and
he was banging her.

2711
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:30,633
It was crazy.
Do you think that those laws are 

2712
01:51:31,871 --> 01:51:32,800
accurate?
Those age?

2713
01:51:32,801 --> 01:51:35,410
A little age,
age limit loans for here's why.

2714
01:51:35,411 --> 01:51:39,070
Laws about consent get blurry.
Here's why.

2715
01:51:39,071 --> 01:51:41,100
Because when I was 18,
okay.

2716
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:42,073
I turned 18.
I had a girlfriend and she was 17 and 

2717
01:51:44,621 --> 01:51:48,340
when I turned 18 she turned 17 first.

2718
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,233
No,
I turned 18 and she was 16 for like a 

2719
01:51:51,550 --> 01:51:55,980
month and then she turned 17 and her,
I think it was her mother,

2720
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:57,160
white girl,
white girl.

2721
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:58,233
Her mother was worried that what we were
doing was illegal because she knew that 

2722
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:03,580
we were having sex.
I was lying to my mom.

2723
01:52:03,690 --> 01:52:05,470
I didn't tell him.
We're talking about mom.

2724
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:07,570
She would come over my house and locked 
the door and my bedroom.

2725
01:52:07,571 --> 01:52:08,590
What are you doing there?
Even tHen,

2726
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,433
mom?
Nothing.

2727
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,353
Well,
I remember when you told me how it 

2728
01:52:10,961 --> 01:52:15,961
happens at seven going down,
but she caught knew,

2729
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:17,620
you know,
and she just didn't,

2730
01:52:17,621 --> 01:52:18,550
you know.
Anyway,

2731
01:52:18,770 --> 01:52:19,603
um,
there was a real worry and I got scared 

2732
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,200
that I could get arrested.
Yeah.

2733
01:52:23,430 --> 01:52:25,180
I'm like,
all the sudden we're not.

2734
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:29,350
We're like at first,
like wHen we first got together,

2735
01:52:29,351 --> 01:52:30,184
she was 16.
I was 17 and then all the sudden I'm 18 

2736
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:39,010
and for like a couple months who was 
super illegal because it was two years.

2737
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:40,480
Did it feel better because it was 
illegal?

2738
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:41,680
no,
scary.

2739
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:42,580
Scary,
dangerous.

2740
01:52:42,581 --> 01:52:43,121
I was like,
wait a minute,

2741
01:52:43,121 --> 01:52:43,954
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

2742
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:47,900
So I could go to for having sex with my 
girlfriend when I'm 18.

2743
01:52:47,910 --> 01:52:49,640
Like is that real?
Like a year?

2744
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:54,700
Because one day your legal.
Like if she's 17 years in 364 days,

2745
01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:58,760
she's illegal.
The next day she's legal.

2746
01:52:58,761 --> 01:53:00,650
So you're telling me is some magic 
thing.

2747
01:53:00,651 --> 01:53:04,160
Takes place over 24 hour period where 
all of a sudden she's illegal.

2748
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:05,353
That seems odd.
Especially if you're just 18 or 19 or 

2749
01:53:08,331 --> 01:53:11,720
whatever it is.
It gets super weird if you're 70 right?

2750
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:12,613
You know you,
you're super old and you're sitting 

2751
01:53:13,941 --> 01:53:14,774
there outside of the school going one 
more day waiting one motherfucking 

2752
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:19,373
rubbing your hands together.
We'll go to wendy's after I got candy 

2753
01:53:23,181 --> 01:53:24,830
for you.
But you know,

2754
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:26,023
it's just,
it just like a hard law like that as to 

2755
01:53:29,721 --> 01:53:32,420
when consent occurs,
when it was,

2756
01:53:32,490 --> 01:53:35,210
when the age of consent,
whether it's 18 or 17,

2757
01:53:35,211 --> 01:53:39,140
and in some places it would be 16 and 
some places you can marry people at 13.

2758
01:53:39,141 --> 01:53:39,974
It gOt real weird.
Do you believe that like a 16 year old 

2759
01:53:42,351 --> 01:53:44,870
and a 30 year old could fall in love?
Do you believe that?

2760
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:48,330
I don't not believe it.
Yeah.

2761
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:50,780
Because weird people are fucking weird,
man.

2762
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:54,710
People are weird and sometimes people 
get together and it defies all odds,

2763
01:53:54,711 --> 01:53:56,360
but it works great.
Yeah.

2764
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:59,690
Like there are people that have bizarre 
relationships where they're,

2765
01:53:59,691 --> 01:54:02,300
they're separated by vast distances in 
age.

2766
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,730
Their personalities are different 
actually,

2767
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:07,280
whenever you go eight years.
Yeah.

2768
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,250
I mean think about that.
I mean 38 years.

2769
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:14,690
That means when your dad that just stop 
and thInk about that for a second.

2770
01:54:14,691 --> 01:54:17,180
Your dad was 48.
Your mom was 10.

2771
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:18,950
Yeah,
that's illegal.

2772
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:21,710
That's crazy amount.
he's my age.

2773
01:54:21,770 --> 01:54:24,230
Your dad was my age.
And your mom was 10?

2774
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,520
Yeah.
WhoA.

2775
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:28,503
Yeah,
that's right.

2776
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:29,860
Yeah.
I'll vote no on that.

2777
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:30,690
Well,
in that,

2778
01:54:30,690 --> 01:54:33,430
in your situation to meet the ovando 
yeah,

2779
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:35,410
nobody got hurt,
but I think.

2780
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:36,001
But I guess,
yeah,

2781
01:54:36,001 --> 01:54:38,200
I mean that's weird if you.
Do you feel like at that,

2782
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:41,110
how would it look?
When was with 16 year old boy?

2783
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:42,700
Here's where I would feel way less 
weird.

2784
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,940
It was a hot 30 year old woman and a 16 
year old boy.

2785
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:47,440
Sorry,
sorry.

2786
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,600
Got to be honest.
I feel less weird.

2787
01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:52,390
I don't think it's ideal.
I don't think it's ideal for the kid,

2788
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:56,050
but what if he's 18?
If he's 18 and she's 30?

2789
01:54:56,470 --> 01:54:57,970
Yes.
Yeah,

2790
01:54:57,971 --> 01:55:01,300
they had that famous case about that.
A couple of thinking about 20 years ago.

2791
01:55:01,301 --> 01:55:04,780
Remember that?
I'm 20 years or 15 years ago.

2792
01:55:04,781 --> 01:55:05,614
It was a couple.
It was a woman who was dating her 

2793
01:55:06,341 --> 01:55:07,570
student.
Oh yeah.

2794
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:10,030
And they ended up getting married.
I think they live in Hawaii.

2795
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:12,730
One of the islands.
And she went to jail for a while,

2796
01:55:12,731 --> 01:55:13,564
right?
Yeah.

2797
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,010
Baby.
Jessica on here.

2798
01:55:15,011 --> 01:55:16,600
Remember that person?
If it's a girl that fell in the.

2799
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:17,780
Well,
yeah.

2800
01:55:18,130 --> 01:55:21,820
Did you ever come on your podcast?
Why don't you ask that?

2801
01:55:21,821 --> 01:55:24,830
Why would you think you fell on the well
one,

2802
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,073
what's it like?
Mostly about math and sugar and then 

2803
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:32,440
sometimes cornflakes.
I just remembered her.

2804
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,140
I saw this video the other day.
It's eight shows.

2805
01:55:35,141 --> 01:55:35,974
The video says it's an 80 year old man 
meeting his 12 year old bride for the 

2806
01:55:38,501 --> 01:55:40,330
first time,
second arranged marriage,

2807
01:55:40,331 --> 01:55:43,680
and that's the whole family's there at 
the house while it's happening.

2808
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:44,160
This

2809
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,020
is real.
He's like meeting her and she looks like

2810
01:55:46,021 --> 01:55:48,990
she wants to die.
She looks super sad.

2811
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:52,110
He's 80 years old,
so it says for the first time he has got

2812
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:52,310
to be.
Yeah.

2813
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:55,490
That's what it says is going on and what
is she reading something?

2814
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,090
I don't even want to see that.
Yeah,

2815
01:55:57,091 --> 01:55:57,630
dude,
that's,

2816
01:55:57,630 --> 01:55:58,320
that's,
that's,

2817
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,900
that's pronounced.
Marriages are terrifying.

2818
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:02,250
Yeah.
That's got to stop.

2819
01:56:02,251 --> 01:56:03,780
I mean I have to stop.
I don't know.

2820
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:06,990
I don't live there.
It's like going on from the beginning of

2821
01:56:06,991 --> 01:56:07,824
time because people have been oppressed,
but now it's the first time you can 

2822
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:10,134
broadcast to the whole world.
So they look at it through their 

2823
01:56:11,761 --> 01:56:14,520
standards versus the standards of the 
people that live in that area.

2824
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:15,600
So you.
Do you think thAt's fair,

2825
01:56:15,601 --> 01:56:16,730
that safe idea or no?
No,

2826
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,920
it's 100 percent.
Not care or safe and scary.

2827
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,430
It's ancient.
Antiquated.

2828
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:21,563
He comes from liKe these,
these cultures that have not caught up 

2829
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:27,420
to our own current perception of the,
of,

2830
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:28,830
of,
of civilization,

2831
01:56:28,831 --> 01:56:30,010
of life.
You know,

2832
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:31,850
that you should let people do what the 
fuck they want to do.

2833
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,240
There's no way that kid wants to do 
that.

2834
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:35,820
Do you think at some point we start to 
like,

2835
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:39,030
like at what point is technology like 
not good for us anymore?

2836
01:56:39,031 --> 01:56:42,450
This has been on my mind a lot recently.
Like it's just make me think about that.

2837
01:56:42,451 --> 01:56:43,284
like at what point is it that if we want
to survive as humans still like at what 

2838
01:56:48,211 --> 01:56:53,211
point do we stop it or not stop it,
but what do we do?

2839
01:56:54,930 --> 01:56:55,763
Hmm.
I know because I feel like it's taken 

2840
01:56:56,251 --> 01:56:59,100
over so quickly that we're not going to 
be human.

2841
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:01,110
We're behaving very.
I mean we'll still be human.

2842
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:04,020
What are behaviors are going to be?
Nothing.

2843
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:08,370
We're just going to be running little 
systems were operators.

2844
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:09,600
Yeah.
No,

2845
01:57:09,601 --> 01:57:12,710
I think what you're feeling and thinking
is what a lot of people feeling.

2846
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:16,530
Think it's a pretty common subject.
A lot of people are talking about.

2847
01:57:16,531 --> 01:57:17,364
A lot of people have perceptions and 
ideas and fears and projections of what 

2848
01:57:20,911 --> 01:57:22,830
they think are going to happen and no 
one really knows.

2849
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:24,203
No one reAlly knows,
but for sure the way we live right now 

2850
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:28,403
is super alien to the way the people 
that lived when your dad was born and 

2851
01:57:32,821 --> 01:57:34,110
that's just,
you know,

2852
01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:36,180
a generation ago.
I mean really,

2853
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:37,253
if you really look at what it really is 
like your dad like one skip one go to 

2854
01:57:40,531 --> 01:57:42,030
the birth,
your dad.

2855
01:57:43,050 --> 01:57:44,650
that's crazy.
I mean that.

2856
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:48,810
That isn't an insane amount of 
innovation and change.

2857
01:57:48,930 --> 01:57:49,763
Yeah,
and once we start becoming integrated 

2858
01:57:52,891 --> 01:57:56,460
with the computers and then once they 
become a part of your body,

2859
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:58,740
that's when things are going to get so 
fucking strange.

2860
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:00,840
I mean they're gOing to happen.
There's a guy,

2861
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:05,160
did we play it on here?
The guy who has the artificial legs that

2862
01:58:05,161 --> 01:58:08,490
are powered by neurochemicals,
I'm out doing that.

2863
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:11,010
Did you play that after the podcast 
showed you after the podcast,

2864
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:11,873
put it on,
put it on for theo because this is the 

2865
01:58:13,441 --> 01:58:14,790
craziest fucking thing ever,
man.

2866
01:58:15,090 --> 01:58:15,923
They figured out a way to make these 
artificial legs that work like real 

2867
01:58:21,181 --> 01:58:22,014
legs,
like for the longest time they've been 

2868
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:24,713
awkward and maybe strange and they got 
better and they made some artificial 

2869
01:58:28,291 --> 01:58:29,124
limbs for veterans that were were pretty
passable and they can even walk without 

2870
01:58:32,401 --> 01:58:33,234
a limp if they pulled it off correctly,
but now now they've come up with 

2871
01:58:36,901 --> 01:58:37,734
something that you're controlling with 
your mind and it's like a machine and 

2872
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:44,740
they have their essentially bionic,
the bionic legs,

2873
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:45,783
and these are functional like they have 
real people that have these artificial 

2874
01:58:48,941 --> 01:58:52,600
legs attach to their body and their 
neural impulses.

2875
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:53,463
The normal impulses that trigger tissue 
movement on a regular person make it 

2876
01:58:57,730 --> 01:58:59,230
happen under this new.
This guy,

2877
01:58:59,530 --> 01:59:02,560
hugh herr is the father of bionic 
revolution.

2878
01:59:02,561 --> 01:59:03,394
He has designed his own prosthesis.
I lost both of his legs in a climbing 

2879
01:59:07,391 --> 01:59:08,224
accident,
so this guy engineered these artificial 

2880
01:59:11,190 --> 01:59:12,023
legs up a knife.
He was 17 and he decided to become an 

2881
01:59:14,891 --> 01:59:15,724
engineer,
found a solution to the problem it will 

2882
01:59:16,961 --> 01:59:20,330
do away with outdated prosthetics,
which he had been given a.

2883
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:21,393
So this guy developed these legs that 
make him walk like he's walking with 

2884
01:59:25,841 --> 01:59:27,600
short sawn.
Look at.

2885
01:59:27,610 --> 01:59:31,750
Look at how they're injecting it into.
They can feel and move from sales.

2886
01:59:31,751 --> 01:59:33,640
From the brain.
Yeah.

2887
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:35,140
It's amazing,
man.

2888
01:59:35,141 --> 01:59:37,000
This guy is moving it.
Anyone can use them.

2889
01:59:37,001 --> 01:59:38,680
He can dance with them on.
He can run.

2890
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:40,690
Look at that.
He's fucking running.

2891
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:42,730
You can run with them.

2892
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:45,670
You can go upstairs.
The coming together of man and robot.

2893
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:50,000
I mean,
and this is again human limitations.

2894
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:53,260
So that's his daughter.
She's riding his back bro.

2895
01:59:53,290 --> 01:59:57,140
Did you see that boston dynamics robot?
They showed the other yesterday or going

2896
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:02,480
to play that because one day a human is 
going to get these legs like this boston

2897
02:00:03,611 --> 02:00:05,980
dynamics robot wants to jump.
That's a man.

2898
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:07,300
No,
it's a robot.

2899
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:08,183
It's like a terminator.
Robot can jump like six feet in the air 

2900
02:00:09,581 --> 02:00:10,450
or some shit like,
yeah,

2901
02:00:10,451 --> 02:00:14,890
see it's just a matter of time here.
People take their feet off and put these

2902
02:00:14,891 --> 02:00:15,724
fucking things on and rolled down the 
highway and we're going to choose those 

2903
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:18,993
demon legs,
those backwards horse type legs because 

2904
02:00:21,311 --> 02:00:22,144
apparently they're more efficient.
They're more efficient springs and you 

2905
02:00:24,881 --> 02:00:26,790
sit down on them.
It doesn't matter where you.

2906
02:00:26,830 --> 02:00:29,200
Does that scare you when you watch it,
when you looked at it?

2907
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:31,480
Depends on how high.
I'm prettY high right now.

2908
02:00:32,270 --> 02:00:35,520
Fairly scares me.
It scares me because it's um,

2909
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:38,380
it's changed and it's radical change and
it's probably coming at a,

2910
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:39,640
at a,
at a,

2911
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:42,450
at a pace that we can't really manage 
now.

2912
02:00:42,490 --> 02:00:43,323
That's what I think is the scariest 
thing about the change that we're 

2913
02:00:44,861 --> 02:00:46,870
experiencing right now.
It's happening so fast.

2914
02:00:46,871 --> 02:00:47,704
We're not going to be able to manage it.
It's not gonna be able to predict 

2915
02:00:49,931 --> 02:00:51,730
whether or not it's a good thing or bad 
thing.

2916
02:00:51,731 --> 02:00:53,830
and even if it is,
we do predict that it's a bad thing.

2917
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:56,490
We're not gonnA be able to stop it.
Well,

2918
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:59,440
there's a crazy race going on and we 
don't exactly know what the goal is,

2919
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:02,830
but there's a crazy race to innovate,
to keep coming up with better and better

2920
02:01:02,831 --> 02:01:04,180
stuff,
whether it's better,

2921
02:01:04,181 --> 02:01:07,330
laptops are better computers,
but it's all leading somewhere.

2922
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:08,173
We're not exactly sure where,
but we're chasing the best product 

2923
02:01:10,511 --> 02:01:11,344
available possible.
And that contributes to this sort of 

2924
02:01:13,661 --> 02:01:18,340
matrix of technology,
this incredible sort of,

2925
02:01:18,341 --> 02:01:19,174
um,
this environment where if you looked at 

2926
02:01:22,781 --> 02:01:25,390
like the technology,
you looked at it as like a,

2927
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:26,673
like a life form.
It's evolving quicker than anything 

2928
02:01:28,721 --> 02:01:30,280
we've ever seen ever.
Oh yeah.

2929
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:31,273
You know what I mean?
EverythiNg else from the champs that 

2930
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:37,780
were talking about earlier to bugs,
to the snake that was eating the snake,

2931
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:41,090
they all evolved.
They've all slowly changed.

2932
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:43,970
There's been natural selection.
There's been random mutations is,

2933
02:01:43,971 --> 02:01:44,804
but all sorts of factors that allowed 
them to get to the state they're at 

2934
02:01:46,761 --> 02:01:47,594
today,
but we've never seen anything like 

2935
02:01:48,711 --> 02:01:49,544
technology mean from my,
from my day I had a computer in 1999 or 

2936
02:01:55,761 --> 02:01:58,340
something like that and had like a four 
gigabyte hard drive.

2937
02:01:58,341 --> 02:01:59,660
And I thought it was the shit kenny.

2938
02:01:59,670 --> 02:02:02,120
And believe this dude,
four gigabyte,

2939
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:06,680
now your phone has a 128 gigabytes.
Now every new phone that comes out,

2940
02:02:06,681 --> 02:02:08,720
it's going to be even bigger and bigger.
They're going to 300,

2941
02:02:08,721 --> 02:02:09,554
260 gigabytes and terabytes.
Laptops have a terabyte on a regular 

2942
02:02:14,031 --> 02:02:16,520
basis.
Now that that is a thousand megabytes,

2943
02:02:16,521 --> 02:02:17,354
it's fucking insane.
We have this incredible environment now 

2944
02:02:20,991 --> 02:02:22,910
where everything is getting better all 
the time,

2945
02:02:22,911 --> 02:02:27,460
whether it's cars or tvs or phones and 
it's happening right in front of us were

2946
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:29,180
just sitting there watching it and we're
helping it.

2947
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:30,800
We're helping it.
We're feeding it.

2948
02:02:31,090 --> 02:02:33,200
We're in.
The newest shit comes out.

2949
02:02:33,201 --> 02:02:35,870
You can't wait.
There's a line outside the apple store.

2950
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:36,913
Please,
please show me what's going to replace 

2951
02:02:39,561 --> 02:02:40,394
me too.
I get to see it yet no little step 

2952
02:02:42,351 --> 02:02:43,580
closer.
Look,

2953
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:48,500
this one takes your fingerprint.
The next one takes your dna.

2954
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:50,120
Yeah.
The next one you blow into,

2955
02:02:50,121 --> 02:02:50,800
it powers it.

2956
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:51,633
It literally feeds off your breath.
And the next one's in electric chimp 

2957
02:02:54,591 --> 02:02:55,424
that takes you a dick.
So this one goes right up your ass like 

2958
02:02:57,141 --> 02:02:59,290
a fucking tampon and then we're done.
Yeah.

2959
02:02:59,770 --> 02:03:01,100
They have one that wraps around your 
risk.

2960
02:03:01,101 --> 02:03:02,690
Now.
Nokia just came out with one.

2961
02:03:02,691 --> 02:03:04,070
It's crazy.
What is you waLk,

2962
02:03:04,130 --> 02:03:04,963
they have a cell phone and you walk 
right up to your fucking wrist and go 

2963
02:03:07,581 --> 02:03:09,730
like that flap.
And it slapped one of them.

2964
02:03:09,810 --> 02:03:12,570
Little rubber bands.
Things that kids have bracelets.

2965
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:13,453
Yeah.
Slap bracelets and it just slaps around 

2966
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:15,643
your wrist and as a flexible screen you 
could look at your screen on your wrist 

2967
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:21,110
while it's like showing you your email 
and who's calling.

2968
02:03:21,370 --> 02:03:24,140
I remember when radar came out and that 
was the big thing around us.

2969
02:03:24,141 --> 02:03:24,680
Radar.

2970
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:27,080
I remember that.
People loved radar.

2971
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:30,440
Radar detectors.

2972
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:32,830
Let the fuckers aren't gettIng me,
dude.

2973
02:03:32,831 --> 02:03:33,664
My body.
One of my buddies used to just drive 

2974
02:03:36,641 --> 02:03:38,410
around the grocery store and just hear 
it beep,

2975
02:03:38,411 --> 02:03:40,810
but he went by the electric doors in the
front of his mind.

2976
02:03:40,811 --> 02:03:43,520
Still does that to this day,
that radar detector.

2977
02:03:43,521 --> 02:03:45,970
That's awesome.
Did I miss the old days,

2978
02:03:45,971 --> 02:03:46,691
man?
Sometimes.

2979
02:03:46,691 --> 02:03:47,524
You know,
I'm not like a,

2980
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:48,713
you know,
one of those naysayers that believes 

2981
02:03:49,691 --> 02:03:52,570
that the future isn't going to happen,
but I surely miss the old days.

2982
02:03:52,571 --> 02:03:54,510
I miss,
I miss old diseases.

2983
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:55,353
I miss.
I miss old when people had ailments and 

2984
02:03:59,471 --> 02:04:01,960
handicaps and it was just part of life,
you know,

2985
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:05,590
every battle wasn't fixed and corrected.
That's still the case for now.

2986
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:09,430
But eventually I'm going to bionic legs.
Everybody geTs a nice teeth.

2987
02:04:09,431 --> 02:04:11,140
Everybody got soap.
Everybody gets,

2988
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:12,750
you don't want that.
I want to.

2989
02:04:12,770 --> 02:04:14,230
I want some people that are a little 
different than.

2990
02:04:14,231 --> 02:04:15,064
I remember they had a dude who broken 
his neck and he just heard his clavicle 

2991
02:04:18,331 --> 02:04:20,290
and his shirt just never.
He was just the dude.

2992
02:04:20,291 --> 02:04:22,480
His shirt never fit the same way,
you know?

2993
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:23,920
And that was just,
we was,

2994
02:04:23,921 --> 02:04:24,754
you know,
he wasn't,

2995
02:04:25,330 --> 02:04:26,163
you know,
they never kind of warrior warrior life 

2996
02:04:28,211 --> 02:04:31,090
with you a little bit more,
if that makes any sense.

2997
02:04:31,330 --> 02:04:32,920
It does.
It does make sense.

2998
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:35,860
Or if you got rabies or something and 
you lost a limb or if you've got,

2999
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:37,173
you know,

3000
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,530
you know,
you just have bionic legs,

3001
02:04:40,531 --> 02:04:41,364
you know,
you had like crazy prosthetics at 

3002
02:04:42,490 --> 02:04:45,660
somebody with one dude in tucson had 
cigarettes.

3003
02:04:45,661 --> 02:04:47,750
He kept in his leg one time he had an 
astro built in the,

3004
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,760
in the side of the other one.
He Would cross his leg over and really?

3005
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:53,390
Yeah.
And it just don't know what it was.

3006
02:04:53,630 --> 02:04:54,930
That guy.
I'd be like,

3007
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:56,670
fuck that.
I want to get some bionic legs,

3008
02:04:56,671 --> 02:04:59,070
wouldn't you?
That's true.

3009
02:04:59,071 --> 02:04:59,821
I don't,
I'm not that guy.

3010
02:04:59,821 --> 02:05:03,180
So I don't know that that guy you would 
want the bionic legs,

3011
02:05:03,181 --> 02:05:05,130
like just,
you don't want to become that guy.

3012
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:06,173
if you.
Do you want to become that guy with the 

3013
02:05:06,961 --> 02:05:08,900
cigarette in his leg.
Lamb?

3014
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:11,100
No,
I don't want to become that guy with the

3015
02:05:11,101 --> 02:05:13,110
ash tray in your thigh.
You don't want to become that guy.

3016
02:05:13,410 --> 02:05:15,840
You want to be the guy with the bionic 
legs if you're either one of those guys.

3017
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:16,920
Yeah.
One hundred percent.

3018
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:19,230
Yeah,
I guess so.

3019
02:05:19,231 --> 02:05:20,064
I guess maybe I just missed the visual.
I was making us miss that time and it 

3020
02:05:22,671 --> 02:05:24,240
was just.
Things seemed a little slower.

3021
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:25,133
Well,
people always long for the past years 

3022
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:27,450
with.
Yeah,

3023
02:05:27,450 --> 02:05:28,860
that,
that feeling of nostalgia,

3024
02:05:28,861 --> 02:05:31,890
especially to people that never really 
totally felt secure during that time.

3025
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:35,160
Sort of romanticize that time.
you know,

3026
02:05:35,161 --> 02:05:37,920
I state this one girl she used to 
vacillate between her childhood was this

3027
02:05:37,921 --> 02:05:40,680
amazing dream and her childhood was 
hell.

3028
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:41,923
He never.
You never get a straight answer out of 

3029
02:05:42,991 --> 02:05:46,770
her Like either she would tell you that 
her childhood was this terrible,

3030
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:47,633
terrible life that was just constantly 
filled with stress and pressure and 

3031
02:05:51,121 --> 02:05:51,954
yelling and fighting and everyone was 
poor and no one can pay the bills and 

3032
02:05:55,111 --> 02:05:55,944
then sometimes she would describe it and
it would be like this wonderful magical 

3033
02:05:58,891 --> 02:05:59,724
time and everything was beautiful and 
amazing and if she could only go back 

3034
02:06:02,641 --> 02:06:04,230
then when life was simple,
it'd be like,

3035
02:06:04,231 --> 02:06:05,700
what the fuck are you talking about?

3036
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:11,600
You have this delusional perception of 
the past that you occasionally adopt,

3037
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:12,773
but for the most part you're talking 
about your childhood and the scars that 

3038
02:06:15,491 --> 02:06:17,880
it's left with you and they fuck with 
your head all day long,

3039
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:18,893
but then occasionally you'll pull out 
some bullshit version of your life and 

3040
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:24,350
like,
like you're looking at some like,

3041
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:25,213
like a memory scene in a movie where 
everything is blurry and perfect music 

3042
02:06:27,991 --> 02:06:28,824
is playing.
Is thAt a survival skill or just 

3043
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:32,220
something where she's nut to thinks 
she's definitely nuts,

3044
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:33,080
right?
Yeah.

3045
02:06:33,470 --> 02:06:36,000
She was definitely nuts,
but it's also a survival skill.

3046
02:06:36,001 --> 02:06:38,550
I think people that grew up in horrific 
childhoods especially,

3047
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:43,680
they have a way of a longing.
The longing for that past they long.

3048
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:46,950
They have so much nostalgia that they 
distort their memories,

3049
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:48,950
but memories are fucked up anyway,
man.

3050
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:49,813
Yeah.
It's crazy how they alter as you get 

3051
02:06:50,371 --> 02:06:51,950
older and you can all.

3052
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,833
You can almost.
If you plant the seed now of what could 

3053
02:06:55,711 --> 02:06:56,544
be a memory later,
it will almost become a real memory 

3054
02:06:59,011 --> 02:07:00,180
later.
You know what I'm talking about?

3055
02:07:00,181 --> 02:07:01,040
I do.
Yeah.

3056
02:07:01,110 --> 02:07:03,150
You can definitely manipulate your own 
brain.

3057
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:04,133
It's crazy.
Did you can't even trust yourself these 

3058
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:07,250
days.
Did any.

3059
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:08,183
Any day.
The human memory is not designed to 

3060
02:07:10,141 --> 02:07:10,974
recall the past and perfect order is 
designed to remember what's dangerous 

3061
02:07:14,041 --> 02:07:15,270
and what's not.
Keep moving.

3062
02:07:15,390 --> 02:07:16,141
Who do you like?
Oh,

3063
02:07:16,141 --> 02:07:17,190
I liked deal.
They deal.

3064
02:07:17,191 --> 02:07:18,180
What's up dude,
I know you.

3065
02:07:18,470 --> 02:07:19,470
You know what I mean?
Like you're.

3066
02:07:19,471 --> 02:07:21,600
You were around people that you trust 
and care for.

3067
02:07:21,601 --> 02:07:23,820
You remember that you remember things 
that they did bad,

3068
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,100
like I fucking hit me with that rock,
that piece of shit,

3069
02:07:26,310 --> 02:07:27,143
and you start saying,
but we're not designed for these 

3070
02:07:28,231 --> 02:07:29,064
longterm strategies for the world and 
remembering what the fuck happened 30 

3071
02:07:32,071 --> 02:07:33,780
years ago when you were in high school 
or whatever.

3072
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:34,980
You know so you're not going to remember
it.

3073
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:36,490
ThAt stuff.
And if you do,

3074
02:07:36,491 --> 02:07:38,830
it'll be all fucked up and jumbled up in
your brain.

3075
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:40,490
It won't be accurate.
Do you?

3076
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:43,240
have you seen that show black mirror?
It's about.

3077
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:44,950
I've seen a couple episodes,
two episodes.

3078
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:45,813
There's an episode where the woman's,
a woman's husband passes away and they 

3079
02:07:49,481 --> 02:07:54,481
have enough audio of him online where he
can now they can take all that audio and

3080
02:07:55,601 --> 02:07:56,434
mix it together and she can now talk to 
him online because enough of his voice 

3081
02:07:59,871 --> 02:08:00,704
is in the internet and you having this,
can you even imagine you're going to 

3082
02:08:03,611 --> 02:08:04,444
live.
You could potentially be interviewing 

3083
02:08:05,381 --> 02:08:06,760
people forever.
Whoa.

3084
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:09,160
Even after you're gone,
bro.

3085
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:10,800
Yeah,
but it still won't work because I don't.

3086
02:08:10,810 --> 02:08:13,240
I wouldn't know what he would have to be
an actual.

3087
02:08:13,241 --> 02:08:14,074
Like if you're going to listen to 
someone in a podcast interviewing 

3088
02:08:15,710 --> 02:08:17,490
someone,
it would have to be the actual person in

3089
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:19,360
because you don't really know what they 
will say.

3090
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:20,770
I don't even know what the fuck I'm 
going to say,

3091
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,780
but they'd have the best database of 
somebody like you.

3092
02:08:22,781 --> 02:08:24,550
To be honest.
They're got a good database,

3093
02:08:24,551 --> 02:08:26,110
but at the end of the day,
right.

3094
02:08:26,111 --> 02:08:28,310
It's not real time and it's not based in
them.

3095
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:29,193
It's not in the moment at all,
but I thought that that was pretty 

3096
02:08:31,211 --> 02:08:33,240
fascinating that they could even do it.
It is.

3097
02:08:33,490 --> 02:08:35,580
It's only the beginning of what they're 
going to be able to do.

3098
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:38,200
They're gonna be able to recreate your 
thought patterns to the point where they

3099
02:08:38,201 --> 02:08:41,920
could recreate how you would feel and 
think and I think how you feel and think

3100
02:08:41,921 --> 02:08:43,540
is a lot of time dependent upon your 
health.

3101
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:45,610
Yeah.
Like there's been many times where I was

3102
02:08:45,611 --> 02:08:46,444
just really tired and I just wasn't the 
same person that I would be if I was 

3103
02:08:48,761 --> 02:08:49,594
really awake.
Yeah.

3104
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:50,410
You know,
so who is that?

3105
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:51,730
Am I the same guy?
Well,

3106
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:54,910
because if you put me in the same 
scenario with the same person saying the

3107
02:08:54,911 --> 02:08:55,744
same thing,
but have a different reaction to it 

3108
02:08:56,981 --> 02:08:57,814
based on how I feel,
which is one of the reasons why I think 

3109
02:08:59,801 --> 02:09:03,130
it's so important to optimize your life,
like your physical health,

3110
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:06,130
it's so important to have as much energy
as you can all the time,

3111
02:09:06,150 --> 02:09:07,480
but great.
So then when you're talking to people,

3112
02:09:07,481 --> 02:09:10,270
you have a positive excellent response 
to it.

3113
02:09:10,271 --> 02:09:11,104
You Have like a good feeling.
You take it and like whatever you 

3114
02:09:12,881 --> 02:09:13,714
experience in life,
you don't have to be weighed down by 

3115
02:09:15,251 --> 02:09:16,084
your physical body to the point where 
you don't enjoy the experience as much 

3116
02:09:18,430 --> 02:09:20,020
as you could if you were feeling healthy
and happy.

3117
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:21,480
Yeah,
and we're the best part.

3118
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:25,140
You can't even get to the surface to be 
there to resonate with the other person.

3119
02:09:25,150 --> 02:09:28,300
Cranky tires.
You're hung over man.

3120
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:29,660
Also worse.
Oh,

3121
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:30,843
drink man.
I quit drinking because that hangover 

3122
02:09:31,850 --> 02:09:32,860
just couldn't take it,
man.

3123
02:09:33,010 --> 02:09:35,470
It's the worst drug they think they've 
got to fit.

3124
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:37,210
They figured out a way to cure 
hangovers.

3125
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:40,060
Some guys said that by 20,
I think it was like 20,

3126
02:09:40,061 --> 02:09:40,894
20,
they will have cured hangovers and 

3127
02:09:42,701 --> 02:09:45,580
figured out some,
some new method to cure hangovers.

3128
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:47,890
So literally.
So what separates doesn't mean you say,

3129
02:09:47,891 --> 02:09:48,724
you know,
you're talking about all these things 

3130
02:09:49,181 --> 02:09:51,250
about the future because you really seem
like a future man,

3131
02:09:51,251 --> 02:09:52,380
you know?
Yeah.

3132
02:09:52,810 --> 02:09:54,510
I'm going to make a new sHirt.
Future man.

3133
02:09:55,290 --> 02:09:57,880
Now they have a cartoon I think called 
future or something.

3134
02:09:58,980 --> 02:09:59,990
Drama.
Yeah,

3135
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:01,880
futurama.
That's a woman.

3136
02:10:01,881 --> 02:10:06,881
I think my spanish.
But what I'm saying at what point are we

3137
02:10:07,871 --> 02:10:09,400
no good anymore?
Well,

3138
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:10,234
we're not going to be this anymore.
I don't think it's a matter of us being 

3139
02:10:11,861 --> 02:10:12,250
no good.

3140
02:10:12,250 --> 02:10:14,500
I think you would pose the same question
to Australia.

3141
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:17,200
[inaudible],
however many hundreds of thousands,

3142
02:10:17,201 --> 02:10:20,260
if not millions of years ago.
Those fuckers were created.

3143
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:21,393
If you went back then and talk to those 
people with sorta kinda people or 

3144
02:10:25,301 --> 02:10:26,134
communicated in some weird fucking 
grunting form about what the fuck's 

3145
02:10:28,301 --> 02:10:30,370
going to happen a million years from 
now,

3146
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:31,391
they'd be like,
whoa,

3147
02:10:31,391 --> 02:10:33,040
we're not going to be us anymore.
Well,

3148
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:35,720
I'm going to have clothes on.
How many of going to be the same?

3149
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:37,460
Oh my god,
I'm going to get in a car.

3150
02:10:37,461 --> 02:10:39,320
I wouldn't even walk places.
Oh my god.

3151
02:10:39,321 --> 02:10:41,000
I'm going to fly in a plane.
You meet.

3152
02:10:41,001 --> 02:10:41,834
I'm not going to have to freeze to death
in the middle of the fucking rockies as 

3153
02:10:44,801 --> 02:10:46,580
they try to cross.
Oh my god.

3154
02:10:46,820 --> 02:10:49,160
No.
I mean we change everything.

3155
02:10:49,161 --> 02:10:50,570
Changes.
We're going to change.

3156
02:10:50,571 --> 02:10:53,240
Just like monkeys change.
Just like you know,

3157
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:55,040
our past ancestors changed.

3158
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:56,510
will we be okay?
Do you feel like,

3159
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:59,330
or it won't be us,
that's what we won't be.

3160
02:10:59,331 --> 02:11:01,520
We write because it will be a different 
time.

3161
02:11:01,521 --> 02:11:02,690
It will be different thing,
man.

3162
02:11:02,691 --> 02:11:05,780
We're going to be a different thing.
It's like Jordan can't play coby because

3163
02:11:05,781 --> 02:11:07,740
they just weren't the same at the same 
time like.

3164
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:08,743
Right.
But if you could get a time machine and 

3165
02:11:09,471 --> 02:11:10,610
put them together,
be fascinating,

3166
02:11:10,611 --> 02:11:11,444
right?
Yeah.

3167
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:15,170
But they can't and they don't and the 
thing keeps going.

3168
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:16,483
The thing keeps going.
The thing does not wait and you are a 

3169
02:11:18,141 --> 02:11:19,080
part of the thing.
You know,

3170
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:21,560
we look at the thing in terms of like 
iphones.

3171
02:11:21,561 --> 02:11:22,394
I don't want an iphone one take that 
piece of shit and throw it right in the 

3172
02:11:24,891 --> 02:11:25,724
fucking ocean.
But back in the day that iphone one was 

3173
02:11:28,521 --> 02:11:30,480
the shit.
Excuse me.

3174
02:11:30,670 --> 02:11:31,503
Yeah.
My father got aluminum on the back of 

3175
02:11:32,631 --> 02:11:32,810
it.

3176
02:11:32,810 --> 02:11:34,480
Look at that guys like having.
Touching.

3177
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:35,780
Yeah.
I make it work.

3178
02:11:35,781 --> 02:11:36,800
When I touch.
It's got a camera.

3179
02:11:37,490 --> 02:11:40,550
I can get online,
get online slow as fuck.

3180
02:11:40,551 --> 02:11:41,620
But you can get online.
Remember?

3181
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:43,780
Whoa.
Those are good times,

3182
02:11:43,781 --> 02:11:45,410
man.
But if you got one of those today,

3183
02:11:45,411 --> 02:11:47,150
he'd be horrified.
You'd like this slow,

3184
02:11:47,151 --> 02:11:50,300
clunky piece of shit.
How the fuck this thing ever make it?

3185
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:53,200
Probably beat your spouse with it,
you know,

3186
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:55,130
that's how much you wouldn't care about 
it.

3187
02:11:55,131 --> 02:11:56,510
Did it?
Would fucking hate it.

3188
02:11:56,650 --> 02:11:57,483
And skip it across over lake.
I guess I'm just nervous that I'm not 

3189
02:11:59,361 --> 02:12:00,980
going to be needed anymore in the 
future.

3190
02:12:00,981 --> 02:12:02,210
You know,
as a comic.

3191
02:12:02,550 --> 02:12:03,740
Yeah.
Sometimes there's a comic.

3192
02:12:03,741 --> 02:12:06,020
I think about that.
But also this is like a human.

3193
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:06,920
Well,
you'll,

3194
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:09,710
you'll be something whether or not 
needed is what you need.

3195
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:11,053
You know,
I don't know if needed is what we all 

3196
02:12:11,691 --> 02:12:11,990
need.

3197
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:16,610
We think we need needed because we don't
like to feel unneeded or unnecessary.

3198
02:12:16,611 --> 02:12:19,220
So we'd like to be desired.
So we want to be needed,

3199
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:20,113
right?
Eventually we're going to have to 

3200
02:12:21,861 --> 02:12:26,861
probably replace that with fulfilled.
Replaced that with a joyful,

3201
02:12:27,170 --> 02:12:28,003
with gratitude,
with enjoying the experience that's 

3202
02:12:30,861 --> 02:12:32,450
going to be.
That's a tough sell to.

3203
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:34,250
Who knows?
it's got to be some changes.

3204
02:12:34,710 --> 02:12:35,543
We might eliminate emotions that might.
If I was going to engineer something 

3205
02:12:38,910 --> 02:12:40,070
right,
not me,

3206
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:40,963
but if I was someone looking to 
ultimately innovate and get us past 

3207
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:45,013
where we are now as a species,
like if you're a certain leaps and 

3208
02:12:47,151 --> 02:12:48,950
bounds of the human race is going to 
have to make.

3209
02:12:49,490 --> 02:12:50,323
One of the big ones I would have to saY 
is we are always tripped up by our 

3210
02:12:52,911 --> 02:12:53,780
emotions,
man.

3211
02:12:53,810 --> 02:12:58,810
We're constantly tripped up by anger and
jealousy and desire,

3212
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:01,063
racism,
mild racism or a serious racism or you 

3213
02:13:03,501 --> 02:13:04,334
know,
just distorted perceptions of reality 

3214
02:13:06,831 --> 02:13:07,664
that are caused by the ego,
not looking at things accurately to 

3215
02:13:10,581 --> 02:13:11,414
protect you from the reality of who you 
are versus who you like to pretend you 

3216
02:13:14,481 --> 02:13:15,170
are.

3217
02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:16,003
All those dIfferent variables can hold 
back people right now if they come up 

3218
02:13:20,001 --> 02:13:20,834
with a way to ensure this ultimate bliss
state without any attachment to 

3219
02:13:25,581 --> 02:13:26,414
emotions,
almost like you exist in a state of 

3220
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:30,330
constant,
um,

3221
02:13:30,530 --> 02:13:33,320
ecstasy like taking the drug ecstasy 
like,

3222
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:38,370
but an intelligent crafty thought,
provoking,

3223
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,890
moving forward ecstasy with no emotions 
attached to it.

3224
02:13:40,891 --> 02:13:42,570
And no,
no jealousy and no anger.

3225
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:43,853
Boy,
who's going to not go into that and be 

3226
02:13:45,471 --> 02:13:46,590
like,
you want to be a champ?

3227
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:49,590
Do you want to go back to chimp days 
when you bite each other's dicks off and

3228
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:52,380
bite your fingers off and killing each 
other and eating each other?

3229
02:13:52,381 --> 02:13:53,880
Is that what you want to do or do you 
want to go forward?

3230
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:54,960
Well,
if you want to go forward,

3231
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:57,840
I don't want to do.
They might be several steps until we get

3232
02:13:57,841 --> 02:13:58,674
there,
but I think ultimately we may very well 

3233
02:14:01,261 --> 02:14:02,094
reach a point where we do not have 
emotions as we know them today because 

3234
02:14:06,331 --> 02:14:07,164
they're not necessary because there are 
biological artifacts of a time where we 

3235
02:14:11,671 --> 02:14:12,504
were living tooth fang and claw trying 
to protect ourselves from other 

3236
02:14:16,411 --> 02:14:17,670
organisms will not.

3237
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:18,533
We might surpass that.
We might reach some new state and that 

3238
02:14:21,181 --> 02:14:26,040
might be the main tool or the main 
ingredient,

3239
02:14:26,070 --> 02:14:30,420
the main element that we introduce into 
the human species that allows us to take

3240
02:14:30,421 --> 02:14:32,970
it.
That's cdm godlike level at because like

3241
02:14:32,971 --> 02:14:34,440
our new medium kinda.
Yeah.

3242
02:14:34,441 --> 02:14:35,274
I mean,
if you think you become something that 

3243
02:14:36,691 --> 02:14:37,524
you would never imagine exists now,
like something that can engineer the 

3244
02:14:39,871 --> 02:14:42,150
future,
something that can change a body turn,

3245
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:46,080
turn something someone into something 
that you've never experienced before,

3246
02:14:46,110 --> 02:14:46,943
make a mind infinitely more powerful 
than the mines that we currently 

3247
02:14:49,621 --> 02:14:51,090
experienced with the greatest minds on 
earth.

3248
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:53,670
If that's all engineering,
if that's all possible.

3249
02:14:53,850 --> 02:14:55,560
You think our feelings will be like in a
museum?

3250
02:14:56,220 --> 02:14:57,900
Nope.
I think it'd be a relic.

3251
02:14:58,050 --> 02:15:01,020
There'll be a relic just like wearing no
clothes as a relic.

3252
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:03,810
I mean you can go back to the amazon 
right now and you could find people that

3253
02:15:03,990 --> 02:15:05,040
aren't wearing any clothes.

3254
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:05,993
Undiscovered tribes that they're just 
going in there and logging and they 

3255
02:15:08,701 --> 02:15:11,550
discover these fucking people and the 
shooting bows and arrows and helicopters

3256
02:15:11,551 --> 02:15:12,540
with cameras on them.
yeah.

3257
02:15:12,610 --> 02:15:14,610
Eating termites to see some of that.
Yeah.

3258
02:15:14,850 --> 02:15:17,250
Yeah.
Whatever the fuck you can stay alive.

3259
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:18,720
That's all a relic,
right?

3260
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:20,483
Let me just makes me nervous.
Sometimes we're going into the matrix 

3261
02:15:22,430 --> 02:15:25,560
they have on going into the matrix.
It's happening.

3262
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:29,310
I'm going to get my stuff first.
What would you bring?

3263
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:30,450
If I said,
hey dude,

3264
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:31,820
you can go into the matrix,
but uh,

3265
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:35,400
you can bring three things,
I'd have to bring a picture of my family

3266
02:15:35,640 --> 02:15:40,640
and then I'd have to bring.
PrObably I bring some water,

3267
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:47,820
would be water in the matrix.
I'm not going to be the guy without it.

3268
02:15:47,821 --> 02:15:48,654
And then imagine if you're the only one 
smart enough to bring water and you're 

3269
02:15:51,511 --> 02:15:52,800
like,
well everybody hold the fuck on.

3270
02:15:53,120 --> 02:15:56,640
I don't have enough water for all of us.
Need some of that water.

3271
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:59,620
And he give it to some of their local 
fight them.

3272
02:15:59,650 --> 02:16:03,290
Try to get the water bags like fuck you.
I'm jagging the water of brother.

3273
02:16:03,291 --> 02:16:06,090
It's not like a brother would drink all 
the water out my grass man.

3274
02:16:06,270 --> 02:16:08,370
I'd probably give it out and I would 
take a knife in there.

3275
02:16:08,371 --> 02:16:10,050
Like a small knIfe.
A small one.

3276
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:11,790
Yeah.
Or maybe a toothbrush.

3277
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:17,970
You're the only person with a fricken 
nice grill and the matrix.

3278
02:16:18,070 --> 02:16:19,610
They're getting some pussy bro.
Woo.

3279
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:21,840
You think you get posting in the matrix 
from having a nice grill?

3280
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:23,180
I hope so,
man.

3281
02:16:23,450 --> 02:16:26,700
I don't know if I care about that.
I just don't want to be in there without

3282
02:16:26,701 --> 02:16:27,534
some of my little bit of a creature 
comfort because I'm feeling 

3283
02:16:29,501 --> 02:16:30,334
uncomfortable on there because if I take
my same feelings and I feel 

3284
02:16:32,531 --> 02:16:33,364
uncomfortable when I'm in this matrix,
I understand and I don't want to not at 

3285
02:16:37,421 --> 02:16:39,400
least have something to clean my teeth 
or to,

3286
02:16:39,970 --> 02:16:42,190
you know,
maybe like an like a scarf or something.

3287
02:16:42,191 --> 02:16:43,024
Something to make me feel more 
comfortable or do you totally knoW what 

3288
02:16:46,061 --> 02:16:46,894
you're saying?
Yeah.

3289
02:16:47,430 --> 02:16:48,430
I don't want to be the dude in the 
matrix.

3290
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:49,610
And what were you taken there?
You,

3291
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:53,470
I would assume that it physical objects 
would be useless,

3292
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:55,330
so I would just go,
uh,

3293
02:16:57,100 --> 02:16:58,390
but the water might be a good idea.

3294
02:16:59,250 --> 02:17:02,980
An hour even split.
No water in the matrix.

3295
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:03,993
I think the real problem is,
is your life force is what you are 

3296
02:17:09,251 --> 02:17:12,130
inside,
like is a soul real and what if they can

3297
02:17:12,131 --> 02:17:17,131
scientifically isolate the soul if they 
can fit science figures out a way.

3298
02:17:17,741 --> 02:17:20,560
Like I know we didn't use to know where 
the subatomIc particle was.

3299
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:22,690
We didn't use to know where the cell 
was.

3300
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:23,673
We didn't use to know the difference 
between multi-celled single celled 

3301
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:26,650
organisms,
but now we do,

3302
02:17:26,730 --> 02:17:27,563
right?
What if one day we get to a point where 

3303
02:17:28,430 --> 02:17:29,263
like we've isolated the cell in a human,
you could see it the same way a dog and 

3304
02:17:32,351 --> 02:17:33,184
see that magnetic field,
we've isolated it and in people and we 

3305
02:17:35,291 --> 02:17:38,080
know what it is and you can actually 
take it out of your body and transfer it

3306
02:17:38,081 --> 02:17:40,330
into the matrix and you will live now in
the matrix,

3307
02:17:40,331 --> 02:17:41,164
but your physical body will cease to 
exist and what if that's what happens 

3308
02:17:45,011 --> 02:17:45,980
when you die,
right?

3309
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,830
What If that's exactly what happens when
you die?

3310
02:17:47,831 --> 02:17:50,450
What if that's why the dmts released in 
your mind?

3311
02:17:50,470 --> 02:17:55,470
You blow through this kaleidoscope of 
geometric patterns to this other place.

3312
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:58,840
What if that is exactly what happens?
I believe that can happen.

3313
02:17:59,350 --> 02:18:02,860
THat feels most realistic to me,
but also I think you could come back and

3314
02:18:02,861 --> 02:18:04,720
be reincarnated.
You could probably bounce back and forth

3315
02:18:04,721 --> 02:18:06,220
between the two.
Why not?

3316
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:07,600
I mean,
if you can be born,

3317
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:10,510
why can't you be born again?
People like there was no evidence.

3318
02:18:10,650 --> 02:18:11,483
I know there's no evidence and you know,
but there you also know that you're 

3319
02:18:15,491 --> 02:18:16,271
alive.
Yeah.

3320
02:18:16,271 --> 02:18:19,120
That's the only evidence we have is that
we've been here already wants.

3321
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:20,103
Yeah,
so it seems most likely that that would 

3322
02:18:21,611 --> 02:18:22,420
occur.
Again,

3323
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:25,180
I don't know about most likely,
but totally possible.

3324
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:28,660
Would you get with a person can exist at
all if you can exist at all.

3325
02:18:29,470 --> 02:18:33,580
If whatever the fuck consciousness is 
exists in the form that is thiel vaughn,

3326
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:34,633
you're telling me that you're absolutely
sure that it doesn't pass through to 

3327
02:18:37,661 --> 02:18:41,290
some next dimension when the physical 
body deteriorates in this one.

3328
02:18:41,530 --> 02:18:42,900
You don't know that.
I mean,

3329
02:18:43,090 --> 02:18:44,620
you might be right.
You might be right.

3330
02:18:44,650 --> 02:18:47,130
It might be the end people that are like
nihilists.

3331
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:49,960
They're like the end.
Your body dies and that's it,

3332
02:18:50,020 --> 02:18:52,930
and you might be right,
but you don't know that you're right.

3333
02:18:52,931 --> 02:18:55,420
So even saying That your body dies and 
that's it.

3334
02:18:56,060 --> 02:18:58,570
The reason why I have a problem with 
that as a,

3335
02:18:58,571 --> 02:18:59,680
you don't know,
and b,

3336
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:02,920
the fact that you exist at all is 
fucking crazy.

3337
02:19:03,250 --> 02:19:05,740
Amen.
The fact that we can talk right now,

3338
02:19:06,250 --> 02:19:07,083
people listening,
there's people right now on road trips 

3339
02:19:08,651 --> 02:19:11,560
right now.
You people out there in that car,

3340
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:13,330
listen to this shit right now.

3341
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:14,163
Laugh children,
they have children probably too high to 

3342
02:19:15,641 --> 02:19:19,990
drive dan adults to to you.
You were a part of this.

3343
02:19:19,991 --> 02:19:20,824
We're all part of this.
The fact that we can experience each 

3344
02:19:22,660 --> 02:19:26,500
other at all and the reason why we're so
fucked up as a culture,

3345
02:19:26,501 --> 02:19:30,260
one of the big reasons why we're so 
fucked up as a as a civilization is that

3346
02:19:30,410 --> 02:19:31,243
we're somehow or another ignoring the 
mystery of being alive as being this 

3347
02:19:35,211 --> 02:19:40,211
crazy,
bizarre and wonderful and powerful thing

3348
02:19:40,971 --> 02:19:44,180
that just that you're alive.
Just that you're hearing these words.

3349
02:19:44,181 --> 02:19:45,014
Just that you and I are speaking these 
words just that's how a guy like Donald 

3350
02:19:47,810 --> 02:19:50,090
Trump gets into office.
That's how things like this happen.

3351
02:19:50,091 --> 02:19:52,880
When the world gets tossed into 
communication were all baffled,

3352
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:54,133
baffled by it all and still figuring out
on the fly and we're stuck with these 

3353
02:19:57,770 --> 02:20:02,770
archaic models of government and control
that were designed back when people were

3354
02:20:03,651 --> 02:20:06,260
riding rafts across the fucking ocean.

3355
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:08,980
With the power of the wind,
I mean literally whatever.

3356
02:20:09,010 --> 02:20:13,360
We're doing a huckleberry finn.
No,

3357
02:20:13,370 --> 02:20:15,290
now I'm thinking of something else.
Mayflower,

3358
02:20:15,530 --> 02:20:17,600
the mayflower pinta,
the santa maria,

3359
02:20:17,601 --> 02:20:18,434
all that shit.
Um,

3360
02:20:18,470 --> 02:20:21,920
I mean we are bizarre,
but just being alive is very strange.

3361
02:20:21,921 --> 02:20:23,360
People don't meet up and talk about it 
enough.

3362
02:20:23,361 --> 02:20:24,770
Then we don't have time,
man.

3363
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:25,703
That's the other thing.
We're keeping ourselves busy work and 

3364
02:20:26,811 --> 02:20:30,380
creating these objects and buying these 
objects were creating these objects.

3365
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:31,730
If you,
even if you're not well,

3366
02:20:31,731 --> 02:20:33,750
I don't work in technology.
So your theory doesn't Work.

3367
02:20:33,751 --> 02:20:35,870
Yes you do.
You work to buy technology.

3368
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:38,450
You don't think you work in technology,
but your labor,

3369
02:20:38,451 --> 02:20:40,370
no matter what you do,
I don't care if you change tires,

3370
02:20:40,580 --> 02:20:43,520
you,
our labor is helping technology innovate

3371
02:20:43,521 --> 02:20:44,354
because you're going to buy a new phone 
and if you're going to buy a new tv and 

3372
02:20:46,461 --> 02:20:48,140
you're going to buy a new computer,
you're helping.

3373
02:20:48,141 --> 02:20:50,690
You're all feeding.
You're working towards technology.

3374
02:20:50,870 --> 02:20:53,360
You just don't think you are,
but everybody is.

3375
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:55,070
Fuck man.

3376
02:20:57,250 --> 02:20:58,730
listen,
nervous now.

3377
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:03,020
Oh,
right now there's no need.

3378
02:21:03,090 --> 02:21:05,180
See,
I think that's part of the trick of life

3379
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:07,520
is that it's always going to feel like,
oh my god,

3380
02:21:07,521 --> 02:21:09,020
this is crazy.
This is going to end,

3381
02:21:09,410 --> 02:21:10,243
but you got to enjoy it while you can.
You got to enjoy this because right now 

3382
02:21:12,291 --> 02:21:13,430
it's not ending.
Yeah.

3383
02:21:13,460 --> 02:21:15,260
I had a dream the other night.
It was a fucked up dream,

3384
02:21:15,261 --> 02:21:17,060
man.
You get a choice of forum before we move

3385
02:21:17,061 --> 02:21:18,320
on.
As you get a choice,

3386
02:21:18,321 --> 02:21:20,630
if you move into that matrix or not,
do you think?

3387
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:22,700
Who the fuck knows?
Who knows?

3388
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:23,863
Who knows?
Maybe you get a chance to just stay in 

3389
02:21:25,281 --> 02:21:26,114
limbo.
Maybe get a chance to go into the dmt 

3390
02:21:27,921 --> 02:21:30,320
world and just danced with the ils for 
all eternity.

3391
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:31,353
Yeah.
Might or you might relax and give into 

3392
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:35,833
love so much that all of a sudden you're
opening your eyes and you're looking at 

3393
02:21:38,121 --> 02:21:38,954
your mother and you're a baby and you 
start from scratch and you tried to do 

3394
02:21:41,991 --> 02:21:42,260
it right.

3395
02:21:42,260 --> 02:21:44,750
This time I'm going to moscow,
dude,

3396
02:21:44,751 --> 02:21:46,850
that's where I want to go.
Do you want to be born in moscow?

3397
02:21:46,950 --> 02:21:47,781
Now?
I just want to go there.

3398
02:21:47,781 --> 02:21:50,060
like if you do that at all at the end,
you know,

3399
02:21:50,150 --> 02:21:52,340
like if you get a pickup one more spot,
you haven't been,

3400
02:21:52,341 --> 02:21:53,174
you know,
you imagine how vulnerable you would 

3401
02:21:53,991 --> 02:21:56,960
feel if you were reborn as a baby and 
you were in any way aware of the.

3402
02:21:56,961 --> 02:21:58,220
You already lived this life.
Like,

3403
02:21:58,221 --> 02:21:59,960
oh my god,
I gotta do this again.

3404
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:01,253
I don't think so.
I think if you've got to look at your 

3405
02:22:02,091 --> 02:22:04,250
mother,
I think you'd just be so filled with how

3406
02:22:04,251 --> 02:22:07,110
much love you probably have for in a 
good.

3407
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:09,260
That's a good attitude.
That's a good perception.

3408
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:13,110
Maybe it's interesting though.
That's fascinating to think that what if

3409
02:22:13,111 --> 02:22:13,944
you got to just have just a moment of 
like threw a baby was just through a 

3410
02:22:16,701 --> 02:22:17,534
baby's eyes or through your mother's 
eyes and see what you looked like or 

3411
02:22:19,641 --> 02:22:24,641
through like if you got to just go 
through to see what the roots of it all.

3412
02:22:24,771 --> 02:22:26,000
Where now,
what's manager?

3413
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:29,490
have you ever heard the stories of a 
three year old past lives?

3414
02:22:29,491 --> 02:22:31,900
They've tried to tell our parents say 
that their kids have told it.

3415
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:32,743
Started saying really weird things and I
always think those people are full of 

3416
02:22:34,741 --> 02:22:37,350
shit.
They don't know if that's ever true.

3417
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:38,810
Why don't you find out?
See what I mean.

3418
02:22:38,811 --> 02:22:39,990
You can't.
It's hard to prove them because they all

3419
02:22:39,991 --> 02:22:42,540
seem very anecdotal.
See if there's any like real good,

3420
02:22:42,541 --> 02:22:45,780
legitimate New York times source of a 
baby starting to speak spanish when it's

3421
02:22:45,781 --> 02:22:46,800
born in Germany or something

3422
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:49,470
that they busted a man in our town.
He was trying to be a ghost.

3423
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:54,540
He was to try to make money for his 
hotel to get it on the haunted tour.

3424
02:22:54,630 --> 02:22:57,030
Oh god.
They called him impersonating a ghost at

3425
02:22:57,031 --> 02:22:59,260
night.
That.

3426
02:22:59,610 --> 02:23:00,443
Has there ever been a fucking john era 
of television that has been more 

3427
02:23:02,641 --> 02:23:07,641
fruitless than ghost hunter shows?
David silva is one of my favorite job.

3428
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:09,310
What is it?
He.

3429
02:23:09,330 --> 02:23:11,700
I saw him last night and he said he 
goes,

3430
02:23:11,930 --> 02:23:14,220
go sunny.
It involves two of our favorite things,

3431
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:17,730
wandering around aimlessly and 
disappointment.

3432
02:23:23,430 --> 02:23:27,630
Every one of them is like ends up in a 
basement with black light.

3433
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:29,003
Like they try,
they use night vision and then they 

3434
02:23:30,881 --> 02:23:32,520
always cut to commercial.
What was that?

3435
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:33,443
And then they cut to commercial,
we'll be right back and we need black 

3436
02:23:37,591 --> 02:23:39,510
goes home is where the black ghost 
hunter is that man,

3437
02:23:39,511 --> 02:23:41,340
I know that black people don't like 
magic and ghost,

3438
02:23:41,341 --> 02:23:46,230
but you got to get some brothers and 
sisters out there on the hunt because if

3439
02:23:46,231 --> 02:23:47,370
anybody could find it goes.

3440
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:49,500
It's a black one too.
Are you still have a bit about that when

3441
02:23:49,501 --> 02:23:51,290
it came to big foot you?
Yeah.

3442
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:52,133
I was like,
here's what you don't find when you go 

3443
02:23:53,251 --> 02:23:54,084
looking for bigfoot black people,
like you are more likely to find big 

3444
02:23:56,981 --> 02:24:01,981
foot then you are black people out 
looking for that is a white man's folly.

3445
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:03,570
Black people like,
Yeah,

3446
02:24:03,571 --> 02:24:06,960
go ahead dude.
Fucking idiot.

3447
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:09,090
He looking for some shit that you don't 
even know.

3448
02:24:09,091 --> 02:24:10,980
It's real.
I'm going to be the guy.

3449
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:13,040
I'm going to be the guy.
I'm the explorer.

3450
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:15,840
I am To discover I'll be up there on 
that mountain.

3451
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:18,120
Like a real man.
But have you ever,

3452
02:24:18,121 --> 02:24:18,954
uh,
have you ever went to look for a 

3453
02:24:19,351 --> 02:24:20,184
treasure or something?
I love very treasured and stuff like 

3454
02:24:21,391 --> 02:24:22,224
that.
I've never heard of a treasure of being 

3455
02:24:23,131 --> 02:24:25,860
in any area that was feasible for me to 
go look for it.

3456
02:24:25,861 --> 02:24:27,660
So no,
I never been involved.

3457
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:29,080
Let's see.
You getting out there one day.

3458
02:24:31,470 --> 02:24:32,230
Never found him.
You

3459
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:33,540
treasure man.
Yeah,

3460
02:24:33,550 --> 02:24:34,383
I think that would be a crazy thing 
known to be one of those dudes that 

3461
02:24:35,950 --> 02:24:38,100
finds gold from one of them.
Sunken roman chips.

3462
02:24:38,101 --> 02:24:38,934
Yeah,
because they found like millions of 

3463
02:24:40,170 --> 02:24:41,003
dollars in gold at the bottom of the 
ocean and the sunken ships that 

3464
02:24:43,021 --> 02:24:45,780
apparently they used to sync all the 
time and certain parts of the world will

3465
02:24:45,781 --> 02:24:46,614
think about it.
They're pieces of shit and they put all 

3466
02:24:47,341 --> 02:24:49,340
their money on them,
invest in it and stuff.

3467
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:51,150
It's like the.
It was like the stock market crash.

3468
02:24:51,151 --> 02:24:53,460
It was like.
It was like our market crash boy,

3469
02:24:53,461 --> 02:24:57,000
five claims lived a past life as a woman
who died in chicago fire.

3470
02:24:57,270 --> 02:24:59,040
WhoA.
That's easy though.

3471
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:04,320
Stories like this that it's not proven 
against it.

3472
02:25:04,540 --> 02:25:05,970
People have looked into it.
huh?

3473
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,300
People comment on it.
So he just had this idea that he was.

3474
02:25:09,450 --> 02:25:09,910
I mean,
he,

3475
02:25:09,910 --> 02:25:13,470
he was a real person and he had the,
he had the details.

3476
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:14,520
Yeah.
Hot chick too.

3477
02:25:14,521 --> 02:25:17,430
It looks like what we just talking about
just before that happened.

3478
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:18,793
Um,
we're talking about aliens looking for 

3479
02:25:21,241 --> 02:25:23,920
ghosts.
Yeah.

3480
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:25,150
Fuck.
I lost my train of thought.

3481
02:25:25,180 --> 02:25:26,013
Oh,
they were talking about big foot and 

3482
02:25:26,501 --> 02:25:28,810
then we're talking about people going in
the woods looking for bigfoot.

3483
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:30,850
Well,
there's just something about people that

3484
02:25:30,851 --> 02:25:33,310
go and looking for things that aren't 
there and wants to be the president.

3485
02:25:33,311 --> 02:25:34,630
Discuss it.
Yeah.

3486
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:36,220
People want to discover shit,
right?

3487
02:25:36,221 --> 02:25:37,054
Whether it's ufo or conspiracy theories 
or they want to be the one that cracks 

3488
02:25:39,791 --> 02:25:40,900
this wide open.
Yeah.

3489
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:42,273
Like even like escape rooms.
That's why people love to go do those 

3490
02:25:43,991 --> 02:25:46,420
escape room things where you go and,
you know,

3491
02:25:46,421 --> 02:25:49,210
it's usually a group of top.
Honestly,

3492
02:25:49,211 --> 02:25:51,310
it's a lot of kind of a filipino 
atmosphere over there.

3493
02:25:51,311 --> 02:25:54,790
And then you go there and they do the 
um,

3494
02:25:54,970 --> 02:25:55,803
you know,
you go and try to break out of the room 

3495
02:25:56,951 --> 02:25:58,780
and even when you're in the room with 
people you don't know,

3496
02:25:59,110 --> 02:26:01,630
you immediately want to be the one to 
crack the code.

3497
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:06,520
And do you think that that partially 
like kills a little bit of a says as men

3498
02:26:06,550 --> 02:26:10,000
and maybe as people that everything 
feels like it's been discovered a little

3499
02:26:10,001 --> 02:26:10,810
bit?
Like.

3500
02:26:10,810 --> 02:26:11,501
Yeah,
for sure.

3501
02:26:11,501 --> 02:26:12,334
there's like part of us that longs for 
like the ability to be the person that 

3502
02:26:16,301 --> 02:26:17,680
figure some shit out.
Right?

3503
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:18,573
Or find some shit or discovering that's 
what probably led people to America in 

3504
02:26:21,311 --> 02:26:22,370
the first place.
Yeah.

3505
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:25,330
I haven't got to find the best spot.
Keep going.

3506
02:26:25,560 --> 02:26:26,590
You know.
And then they find a spot.

3507
02:26:26,591 --> 02:26:29,320
All right.
You ever see like an old homestead area?

3508
02:26:29,950 --> 02:26:31,660
You know what a homestead is?
I've,

3509
02:26:31,661 --> 02:26:33,220
I'm in Montana,
we,

3510
02:26:33,221 --> 02:26:34,054
um,
we came across these houses that were 

3511
02:26:35,441 --> 02:26:37,280
set up back when,
uh,

3512
02:26:37,480 --> 02:26:38,313
on,
um,

3513
02:26:38,530 --> 02:26:41,350
the Missouri breaks in Montana.
The river.

3514
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:42,700
I love Montana.
Well,

3515
02:26:42,701 --> 02:26:43,500
do you know those,
uh,

3516
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:44,333
ever seen those really old structures 
that are up there that are just rotted 

3517
02:26:46,841 --> 02:26:48,880
out from like the 18 hundreds and shit?

3518
02:26:49,320 --> 02:26:49,841
Well,
people,

3519
02:26:49,841 --> 02:26:53,020
they would give them plots of land and 
they will let them homestead.

3520
02:26:53,170 --> 02:26:54,100
So like say,
hey,

3521
02:26:54,101 --> 02:26:55,000
you know,
if you stay here,

3522
02:26:55,001 --> 02:26:56,590
if you could stay here for x amount of 
time,

3523
02:26:56,730 --> 02:26:58,180
you can,
you get to keep this land.

3524
02:26:58,310 --> 02:27:01,120
So people go out there and try and some 
of them didn't succeed.

3525
02:27:01,121 --> 02:27:01,954
They failed.
Wow.

3526
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:05,080
And yeah,
and you get to physically touch.

3527
02:27:05,081 --> 02:27:05,914
You can get out of your car or you get 
out of your boat rather walk along the 

3528
02:27:09,070 --> 02:27:12,490
shore and go up and put your hand on 
this building.

3529
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:17,640
That was built by some guy who took a 
chance and didn't make it.

3530
02:27:17,950 --> 02:27:18,783
Wow.
He took a chance and he came over from 

3531
02:27:20,381 --> 02:27:22,840
the east coast or somewhere somewhere 
east.

3532
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:28,000
Made it all the way out to Montana.
Took a patch of land and died out there.

3533
02:27:28,390 --> 02:27:29,223
And you could find that little house and
maybe sometimes there's a little 

3534
02:27:31,511 --> 02:27:34,850
cemetery there to where the people that 
used to live there buried in.

3535
02:27:34,890 --> 02:27:37,080
Do you think he feels any differently 
when he died then?

3536
02:27:37,081 --> 02:27:39,580
Like you were outfield when we die.
It's a real good question.

3537
02:27:40,510 --> 02:27:43,360
Like does his wonder if his a real good 
question?

3538
02:27:43,361 --> 02:27:44,194
I bet everybody goes scared.
It doesn't like if you die in beverly 

3539
02:27:46,451 --> 02:27:47,284
hills,
do you think it's any better than dying 

3540
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:49,840
in the jungle?
No,

3541
02:27:50,300 --> 02:27:51,720
no,
no.

3542
02:27:51,950 --> 02:27:54,400
That'S ultimately what's hilarious about
it all.

3543
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:55,503
At the end it's a complete and total 
lack of control and that's what's so 

3544
02:27:57,851 --> 02:27:58,684
terrifying to us because we go through 
our lives trying the best we can to 

3545
02:28:02,351 --> 02:28:06,790
maintain as much control as possible and
fail almost every step of the way.

3546
02:28:06,791 --> 02:28:07,624
And then ultimatelY the only thing that 
we have control over is our ability to 

3547
02:28:11,951 --> 02:28:14,290
let go of control.
Right?

3548
02:28:14,410 --> 02:28:16,270
Wow.
Yeah.

3549
02:28:16,271 --> 02:28:17,350
Right.
Ultimately,

3550
02:28:17,351 --> 02:28:22,190
the only thing we really have is this 
understanding

3551
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:26,900
that this is a temporary existence and 
you're going to come to a time where the

3552
02:28:26,901 --> 02:28:27,734
ride ends and everybody's right ends and
you just have to face that and it's 

3553
02:28:32,470 --> 02:28:33,303
scary

3554
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:36,710
at midnight rider song as pop back into 
my head and just saying that doon doon,

3555
02:28:37,180 --> 02:28:42,180
doon doon doon doon doon doon.
Doon should end on that.

3556
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:45,130
Perfect deal.
Vaughn.

3557
02:28:45,131 --> 02:28:47,330
You're a bad motherfucker alwayS like 
hanging out with you at the store.

3558
02:28:47,331 --> 02:28:48,740
So I'm glad we got a chance to do this.
Dude.

3559
02:28:48,741 --> 02:28:50,030
You're funny dude.
Thank you man.

3560
02:28:50,031 --> 02:28:51,640
I appreciate you having me.
I'd like to ah,

3561
02:28:51,770 --> 02:28:53,210
this world you created in here,
you know,

3562
02:28:53,211 --> 02:28:56,660
this is to think about stuff back soon.
Let's do it again man.

3563
02:28:57,350 --> 02:28:59,530
I appreciate it.
And a few vons.

3564
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:02,360
Goddamn I let them do stand up.
He's funny as shit.

3565
02:29:02,361 --> 02:29:05,570
And you have a specialist coming out in 
june on showtime now.

3566
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:07,160
Have a special.
It's on netflix right now.

3567
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:08,180
That's,
that's rIght,

3568
02:29:08,270 --> 02:29:09,103
yeah,
a bunch of trolls attack then when it 

3569
02:29:09,741 --> 02:29:11,150
came out,
but get it out there.

3570
02:29:11,300 --> 02:29:12,133
A bunch of roles yet is some people 
wrote like negative articles and like 

3571
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:15,733
had people like some sub reddit people 
like rank it low and just stuff that 

3572
02:29:19,161 --> 02:29:21,380
just like kind of I kind of got 
attacked,

3573
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:22,730
you know,
virtually attacked.

3574
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:24,680
Was it?
What was it about subject matter or.

3575
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:25,833
I don't know what it was.
Some people call me to compare you to 

3576
02:29:27,261 --> 02:29:29,210
donald trump's people.
Little understand satire,

3577
02:29:29,211 --> 02:29:31,190
I guess.
I don't know,

3578
02:29:31,250 --> 02:29:33,830
it just was disappointing,
but go check it out on netflix,

3579
02:29:33,831 --> 02:29:35,300
man.
I think you'll enjoy it called again.

3580
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:37,550
It'S called.
No offense on netflix.

3581
02:29:37,551 --> 02:29:39,290
