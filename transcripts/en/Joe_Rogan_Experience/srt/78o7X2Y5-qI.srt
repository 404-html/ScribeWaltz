1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,470
Her low freak bitches outfit.

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,000
I mean I've worn costumes like that.

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:07,380
Just sound like sketches and shit.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,303
Okay,

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,810
what is going on here in this picture?

6
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:10,770
This is so strange.

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,210
They're courting each other.

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,790
They're holding hands and
steering and juices eyes like,

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,140
you know what this says?

10
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,260
It's like you saw cartoons and you're
a little kid and they just fucked your

11
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:19,591
brain.

12
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:19,981
I'd be like,

13
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:22,140
well this is what I'm looking forward
to when I get out of this house.

14
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,401
And he got out of the house.

15
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,780
You hear car accidents,

16
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,800
gunshots,

17
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:26,820
rape.

18
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,240
But do they fuck each other while they're
both wearing a costume or do they fuck

19
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,920
people that aren't wearing a costume?

20
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,783
Apparently.

21
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,940
And this is I f I'm sorry if you are
a member of the furry community and I

22
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:37,774
misrepresent you,

23
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,330
but some of them have hatches where
their asshole is sort of like those old

24
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:47,280
school pajamas and those a wild west
cartoons and we're the wild west pajamas

25
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,630
where they had like a like pop.

26
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,410
I always had those Dukie flap and you
got two buttons that cover your Shitter,

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,670
like the shit trap and you open up the
trap door and drop a bomb in there and

28
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,350
then button that fucker back up.

29
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,050
They didn't have,

30
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,390
they probably had drawstrings.

31
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,700
He probably didn't even have
like rubber waistbands back then.

32
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,630
Right.

33
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,270
Like how different they like
those big buttons on either side.

34
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,370
How do they tighten down your uh,

35
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:08,851
underwear?

36
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:09,960
Back then it was buttons.

37
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,063
That makes sense.

38
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,690
They probably had buttons in the front,

39
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,650
buttons in the Shitter.

40
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,300
He did buttons on everything back then.

41
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,160
So these kids,

42
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,570
they thought that was the future.

43
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,720
And then they went out there and they
got punched in the face the moment they

44
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:22,554
left their house.

45
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,800
And then probably somebody did terrible
things to them and they went to school

46
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:26,760
and they got picked on.

47
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,830
And then here they are just
wishing they were a squirrel.

48
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,751
Oh this is the,

49
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:31,070
the squirrel just look in the courtroom.

50
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:33,030
And it was my favorite
toy when I was young.

51
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,710
Then watch this girl cartoon and be like,

52
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:34,801
Oh,

53
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:35,820
I want to be in a squirrel.

54
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,320
We don't want to go to school
and want to do the same.

55
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:39,330
We just want to be a squirrel.

56
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,640
Well the hotel where we were at,

57
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,260
they got to request it was,

58
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:46,260
they're filled up with furries except
me and a few of the other UFC staff.

59
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,830
I'm not,

60
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,610
I'm not lying.

61
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,230
It's a fill.

62
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,920
Dazing and they got a request and the
request was the ferries asked if they

63
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,110
could put a litter box in the lobby.

64
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,340
No Way.

65
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

66
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,490
They wanted to pay for her litter box.

67
00:01:58,491 --> 00:01:59,311
We brought into the lobby.

68
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:01,620
They like this whole convention is all us,

69
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,431
so can we do that?

70
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:02,881
And like I was like,

71
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:04,350
what the fuck are you talking about?

72
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,820
They took my idea for cats.

73
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:10,140
They tried to get a litter box and put
it in the front lobby of like the Westin

74
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,620
in Pittsburgh to make
smelly in apparently.

75
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,710
I mean it could have all just
been just they get to be like,

76
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,610
come on man.

77
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,490
Well they definitely were asking for
food to be delivered in bowls on the

78
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,324
ground.

79
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,951
Whatever they ordered.

80
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:28,740
They wanted to put a bowl like a dog
food bowl and eat it on the ground.

81
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,311
Right.

82
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:33,150
It was several different rooms that were
requesting this that I can see though,

83
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,280
if you're going to go that distance,

84
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,980
if you're not taking a
shit in the fucking lobby.

85
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,580
Right.

86
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,413
You want to know?

87
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,950
You don't know until you ask.

88
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,450
Think it's all us.

89
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,313
It's all us here.

90
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,190
It's just all us.

91
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,450
We're amongst friends.

92
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,853
We'll pay,

93
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:47,730
we'll pay him.

94
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,421
Let me just ask.

95
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:50,530
Let's just ask like they're so crazy.

96
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:51,510
They just probably asked.

97
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:51,720
Yeah,

98
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,311
I mean I get,

99
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:52,801
it's like have,

100
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,860
they'll just have a litter box
in your room and the lobby.

101
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,730
Yeah.

102
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,660
Come on man.

103
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,040
I bet a lot of them had them in their

104
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,510
going up that fucking flight of
stairs with a duffle bag fill.

105
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,344
What litter

106
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,891
is there?

107
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:09,070
It's part of the sport.

108
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:10,450
And when I came into bodybuilding,

109
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,270
it's not like I invented
steroids with already there,

110
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:13,780
you know,

111
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,150
my first semester and in Paris in 1965,

112
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,060
Larry Scott and was the Mr of MP or 90 65.

113
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,030
And he said he was using
steroids and that was 1965.

114
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,770
So when did this start being used?

115
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,521
I don't know,

116
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,440
but for sure in the early sixties,

117
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,360
1965 they had steroids.

118
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,710
When did they invent steroids?

119
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,501
Uh,

120
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,390
I believe,

121
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,950
well you had testosterone.

122
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,830
I mean testosterone was used
in the Second World War.

123
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
The Germans were using
that with the SS soldiers.

124
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,303
Um,

125
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,110
so injectable testosterone
was available then steroids,

126
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,570
which there were more refined
version of testosterone.

127
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,920
Um,

128
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,780
I think late fifties.

129
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,400
How has it more refined in what way?

130
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,920
So he got testosterone is a male hormone,

131
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,130
so it's basically 50%
androgenic that's male,

132
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,210
like characteristics,

133
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,150
50% anabolic repair bill.

134
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,190
So they want it to take this
and they want to this pot,

135
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,970
the anabolic and minimize the androgenic
cause that's what gives you side

136
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:10,670
effects,

137
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,280
prostate growth and all that stuff.

138
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,260
So they try,

139
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,640
they refined it so that those effects
are minimized and more of the anabolic

140
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:18,941
effect.

141
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:19,774
That was the idea.

142
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,080
And there's a guy called
John Siegler I think.

143
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,680
And because they found
out the eastern bloc,

144
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,543
they had their own,

145
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,580
had their own stuff called [inaudible].

146
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,003
So,

147
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,320
uh,

148
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,860
Siegler invented Dinah Ball,

149
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,210
and I don't know,

150
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,890
don't quote me if I could be wrong,

151
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:37,780
but I think it was about
58 or something like that.

152
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,670
He developed that the
u s weightlifting team,

153
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,410
1958,

154
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:42,250
I think it was 58.

155
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,960
But before that you had testosterone.

156
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,700
So they were known as what,

157
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,120
uh,

158
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,410
when people started using it,

159
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,320
but for sure from the early sixties,

160
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,170
it's been a part of bodybuilding
and then other sports.

161
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,230
And they used to be a disclaimer inside
the steroid thing saying anabolic

162
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:02,080
steroids do not increase
athletic performance.

163
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,000
That's hilarious.

164
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,280
All right.

165
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,710
So they stated this and
they also told guys,

166
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,401
if you take this,

167
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,440
you fucking balls are going to drop off,

168
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,550
you're going to fucking die,

169
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,050
you're going to get liver cancer.

170
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,970
So guys started using them and
seeing that that's all bullshit.

171
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,750
Right.

172
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,500
So then they don't want to listen
to anything that he's medical guys,

173
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:19,901
I've got to say,

174
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,160
cause you aligned to us then.

175
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:21,530
Right?

176
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,800
So you're going to be
aligned to us all the time.

177
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,551
Not necessarily.

178
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:25,080
So yeah,

179
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,430
because you do have the
chances of side effects,

180
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,300
but it,

181
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,900
you could say it's been
greatly exaggerated and certain
that's the problem was a

182
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:34,210
propaganda and deception,

183
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,044
right.

184
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:35,710
People,

185
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,790
the fucking truth man.

186
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,810
And let them deal with it.

187
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,644
And uh,

188
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,603
that's what I do.

189
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,743
Um,

190
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,960
because I saw all this stuff
on the Internet about what
I'm supposedly doing and

191
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,740
I thought young guys are going to read
this and maybe they're going to do it.

192
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,110
So I did an article in a magazine,

193
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:50,921
muscular development,

194
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:51,221
and I said,

195
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:51,461
here,

196
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:52,294
this is what I did.

197
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,510
This is what I did in Austin.

198
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,410
This is what I did for a contest
and these are my opinions.

199
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,550
And you know,

200
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,500
my honest opinion is like,

201
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,420
I don't think it's worth it unless you,

202
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,721
you know,

203
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:03,740
you're competing and so on.

204
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,000
But ultimately it's up to you.

205
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,410
Let me give you the information.

206
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,460
What you do with is up to you.

207
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,470
And I don't know for 70% of the
people like this is bullshit.

208
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,010
He didn't really,

209
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,570
he must have talked much more
than this because I'm taking this,

210
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,940
actually I'm taking more than this

211
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,873
and I don't look like him.

212
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,740
Well tough shit man.

213
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,703
You know

214
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,140
I always tell kids who want to be in this
business to please wait like even with

215
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:26,270
my kids is it just wait,

216
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,250
wait til you're like wait
to get an understanding.

217
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:32,420
Like I was able to be grown and and have
some grown shit happened to me and just

218
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:33,670
regular life shit happens.

219
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:34,820
So then when this happened,

220
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,860
I still have a point of reference to
get back to because you know like I know

221
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:41,060
you've interviewed everybody.

222
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,580
This business affects you in such a way
where you'll see one person one day,

223
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,320
I won't say the comedian's name,

224
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:52,340
but I remember a comedian back in the
day did like half of an HBO or whatever.

225
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,530
And then the next week I saw him,

226
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,860
he had 12 body guards and
they were pushing me back.

227
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,630
What the fuck man?

228
00:06:59,631 --> 00:06:59,961
Yo Man,

229
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,470
Yo know now.

230
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,700
Right now it just got crazy.

231
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,534
It got crazy,

232
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,520
crazy good,

233
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,353
crazy cause.

234
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,530
And I've seen,

235
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,320
I remember,

236
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,720
I won't say the names would
have been a couple of guys,

237
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,400
I never get this one dude hit.

238
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,250
And I went up to try to
say something to him and,

239
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,280
and for some reason he
had a white suit on.

240
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,320
We were in a club.

241
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:18,570
I,

242
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,670
why the fuck does he have this
white suit on and these big shapes.

243
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,450
And I went to talk to him and he said,

244
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:24,650
not right now man,

245
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,520
I'm rich.

246
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,353
Hmm.

247
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,280
He said that

248
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,803
they got rich,

249
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,640
let me be rich and famous right now.

250
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:35,350
I don't want to hear your pitch.

251
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,051
And some I said,

252
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:37,231
man,

253
00:07:37,231 --> 00:07:38,640
you think you can get away.

254
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:39,474
And I was like,

255
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,010
and as he said it,

256
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:41,850
I had to sort of like,

257
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:42,390
okay,

258
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,223
I had to get up.

259
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,130
But that's,

260
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,371
you know,

261
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,380
that's what happens when
you gotta be careful.

262
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,850
That tide goes in and it goes out
and people come up and they remember,

263
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,480
they remember and we remember
when you fucked with them.

264
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:55,080
And we've seen and we've seen him,

265
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:55,861
we've seen him.

266
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:56,040
But,

267
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,970
but being a comedian,

268
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:57,804
we get,

269
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:03,170
we get a chance to sit in a different
seat because we sort of are our jobs or

270
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,370
our observational,

271
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,070
you know,

272
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,380
so,

273
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,830
and we still all have our own demons,

274
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:08,340
but it's,

275
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,340
it's just different when you also
get humbled a lot as a comedian.

276
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,910
Yeah.

277
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,870
You gotta get those jokes.

278
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:14,760
You're performing in
front of a live audience.

279
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,840
It's all live.

280
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,700
It's got to work and it doesn't work.

281
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:18,231
Shit.

282
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,640
You gotta go back to the drawing
board and it's got to assess,

283
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,940
actors don't get a lot of that.

284
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,570
And that's one of the reasons
why the kind of shaky,

285
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,843
more shaky.

286
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,250
Yeah.

287
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:26,640
Right.

288
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,850
Don't get a lot of like testing
it live in front of people,

289
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:31,470
that humility that comes
with that you don't.

290
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,710
And,

291
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,041
and it's,

292
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:32,521
and it's tough.

293
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:33,450
I was talking to her act,

294
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:34,284
another actor,

295
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,371
and it's tough cause see,

296
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:37,050
I'm a comic who became an actor,

297
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,370
so I'm cheating.

298
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,481
You know what I'm saying?

299
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:40,800
I can go do this and I can go,

300
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:41,391
I'm going to be,

301
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:42,630
I'm going to be in Saint Louis tomorrow.

302
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:43,090
You know,

303
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:43,531
some jokes.

304
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:43,861
So I can,

305
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:44,101
you know,

306
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:44,640
I gotta get,

307
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,480
I can get my thing off.

308
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:46,710
But just actors,

309
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,900
it's tough when you're thinking about a
way to bounce three careers you can sing

310
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,710
too.

311
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,881
I mean,

312
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:53,730
you could do anything.

313
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,990
You're a weird guy.

314
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,531
That way.

315
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,990
You've got a lot of weird talent yourself.

316
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,970
And it's talking about
Justin Bieber and yeah,

317
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,331
Chris Brown,

318
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,880
you've got some weird ability to shift to.

319
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,890
It's not only,

320
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,340
but I've been fortunate in the fact
that now things have opened up.

321
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,001
Like,

322
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:09,211
you know,

323
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:10,110
back in the day,

324
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,000
like you could only do one thing.

325
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,430
One thing I would never forget
Keenan Ivory Wayans told me,

326
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,700
say,

327
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,450
Yo,

328
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,580
what's with the singing shit?

329
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,380
Yo,

330
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,161
you want a month?

331
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:21,160
Like I can't see you
