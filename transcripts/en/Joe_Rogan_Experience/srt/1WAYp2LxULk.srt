00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,420
Now they're judging everything you say.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,210
You've had that before.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,930
Yeah,

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,531
I drink it.

6
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:13,500
A lot of unknown bars
and you just start like,

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,071
well,

8
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:16,560
here's one of my stories.

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,270
One of my favorite doug stories is with
the fucking boxing match and Vegas,

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,450
and you were heckling and hold
him down and fuck his face.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,310
It'll destroy his confidence.

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,470
This is the prelims,

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,620
prelims or this box listening audience.

14
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:38,910
You have to understand when you
go to whatever his boxing or UFC,

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,490
the undercard no one's there.

16
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,350
They're all out getting drinks awaiting,

17
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:46,380
waiting for the thing that they
don't understand to happen.

18
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:47,250
That's at the end.

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,340
So it's dead silent.

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,500
Bingo Hall Church.

21
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,430
Silence.

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,330
So you can heckle and from the back row.

23
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:59,340
But Joe Rogan good a second row,

24
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,350
so it's absolutely quiet
and we're in their heckling.

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,500
Let me take your fucking him in the ass.

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:07,721
No,

27
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:07,801
no,

28
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,050
no.

29
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,090
We'll take it because I wasn't heckling
at all because Douglas doesn't do

30
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:12,924
marijuana.

31
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,490
Joseph does marijuana.

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,290
Douglas does alcohol.

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,970
Joseph does marijuana.

34
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,040
Joseph's freaking out because Douglas
Heckling ticket kind of fucking laugh.

35
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,920
You're the one who brought me in.

36
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,060
So I'm kind of your responsibility.

37
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,810
Yeah,

38
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,520
try making him come.

39
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,130
That always knocks me out like a light.

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,340
Wait till two seconds to go
and say you just got punked.

41
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,130
I don't remember that one.

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,230
It was a five fights in a
row with no one in the arena.

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,300
The boxers can hear you

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,700
well.

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:50,930
No,

46
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,121
no,

47
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:51,900
no.

48
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,670
He's being too too humble.

49
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,720
Here he got.

50
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,290
He started getting laughs
and that became a problem.

51
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,260
Became a problem.

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,350
One of them,

53
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,080
I don't.

54
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,850
I think it was holding
down and fuck his face.

55
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,830
That was the one that broke to waterfall.

56
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,043
The whole

57
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,560
break his confidence.

58
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,480
Let me say something about Doug Stam.

59
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:17,830
Hope will heckle a boxing when he.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,470
He starts the right way.

61
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,400
It isn't just dive right
into the holding down.

62
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,310
Fuck his face.

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:23,970
He's.

64
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,970
He starts with some light jabs and then
he builds up and it gets more and more

65
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:32,850
bizarre and then it got to the
whole data and fuck his face.

66
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,661
But when he said,

67
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:35,070
hold him down and fuck his face,

68
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,840
I remember just hearing people go,

69
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:37,710
Oh shit

70
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,070
don can we showed up at some?

71
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,490
Don't remember the Don King Haeckel,

72
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:49,060
but don king showed up while you
can still hear of my uncles and uh,

73
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,360
what was the name of his movie?

74
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:51,990
Whatever,

75
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,920
in America,

76
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,300
only in America.

77
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,163
Can you,

78
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,111
can you,

79
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:56,291
uh,

80
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,110
yelled something only in America.

81
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,930
Can you fuck over you had so many,

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,920
but he was there and could
hear every word I said.

83
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,500
Um,

84
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,230
I did a thought experiment
a while back and I thought,

85
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,040
you know,

86
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,030
it's interesting because when I was,

87
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,590
when I was in college,

88
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,390
every one of my college
buddies know me as Arnold,

89
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,490
they don't even know me as mark.

90
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,220
They call me arnold because when we were
in college there was a TV show called

91
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:25,760
green acres and there was a pig
on the show called Arnold Ziff.

92
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,020
And I could eat more than anybody in,

93
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,650
in the,

94
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,750
in the college I went to
including the football team.

95
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,660
And so people would call me Arnold Ziff.

96
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,500
And so I became Ahrens,

97
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,420
Arnie Arnold for most of my life,

98
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,650
just because the amount of food,

99
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,060
just because the amount
of food I could eat.

100
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,433
And um,

101
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,620
did you have like contests
or is this just like,

102
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,290
but I just,

103
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,970
everybody knew it's like you're
going to eat that dessert,

104
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:47,470
you're going to eat those,

105
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,280
you're going to eat that steak,

106
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,300
you can have that.

107
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,510
Um,

108
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,770
but it was running 100 miles a week.

109
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:52,970
I was skinny fat.

110
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:55,220
I weighed 30 pounds less than I weigh now,

111
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,060
but I just,

112
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,050
the throughput was,

113
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,070
was where it was.

114
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:58,810
Um,

115
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,990
and because I had leaky gut,

116
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,010
probably a lot of it just

117
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,690
went right out the button,

118
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,413
the button.

119
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,261
So,

120
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:07,090
um,

121
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,923
uh,

122
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,080
the thought experiment was that my
whole life I sort of was guilty of this,

123
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:16,910
like how much food can I eat and not
gain weight and not be uncomfortable.

124
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,511
You know,

125
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:17,870
that's,

126
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,140
I think a lot of people look that way.

127
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:19,800
It's like,

128
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,031
all right,

129
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:20,780
we're going to go eat lunch.

130
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,620
How much food can I eat and uh,

131
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:22,831
and,

132
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:26,360
and not gain weight or how much of that
cake or that pie can eat or whatever.

133
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:27,840
People I think tend to this is,

134
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,311
this is the,

135
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:29,660
what can I get away with part of it?

136
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:30,711
Well,

137
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:33,050
what if we shifted that
around and you said,

138
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,280
what's the least amount of food I can
eat and maintain muscle mass and maintain

139
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:42,281
energy and and not get sick and most
importantly not be hungry and you find if

140
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:45,230
you do this experiment
is pretty interesting.

141
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,970
If you become good at burning fat,

142
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,290
your your appetite,

143
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,410
so self regulate and so mitigates that
you find yourself pushing a plate of food

144
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:57,710
away after a couple of bites or not being
hungry or eating just the right amount

145
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:02,680
of food to to to get you through the
day and a couple other people out.

146
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,000
They took a trip out to
Japan and I popped out there,

147
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,860
got out there January third.

148
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,830
I was hanging out with
this girl out there.

149
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,180
We'd go to this bar,

150
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,530
so nice bar in Japan
called Jbs jazz blues.

151
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:19,230
So also a lot of the bars out there,

152
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,830
the names of them in English
are very on the nose.

153
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,430
It's a hip hop club.

154
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,900
It's Club Harlem,

155
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,793
Shit like that.

156
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,913
Like,

157
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,190
Oh the club that plays.

158
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:33,650
So let's call it 70,

159
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,201
like shit,

160
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,210
like really on the nose.

161
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,950
So we go to jazz blues,

162
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:39,480
so if you haven't Tokyo check it out.

163
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,580
It's just,

164
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,700
it's a small bar.

165
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,040
Uh,

166
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,130
I don't know the owner's name,

167
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:47,550
but it's full of vinyl records
and you can just request.

168
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,940
He has all types of vital records
is in a lot of Japanese people.

169
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:55,941
They were Americans or it
was some Japanese people
but it was in Tokyo at this

170
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,920
bar in Tokyo.

171
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,210
In Tokyo is some but not an eoc a lot,

172
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,103
but the bar.

173
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,220
But the bar itself,

174
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,600
it only holds 10,

175
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,050
15.

176
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,040
It's a small spot.

177
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,750
Ten or 15 people if that.

178
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,140
Yeah.

179
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,370
Pack like 10,

180
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,010
15.

181
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:11,760
It'll be pants.

182
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,620
It's ruining something.

183
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:13,454
Yeah,

184
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,293
it's this room.

185
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,280
Maybe it's my smaller than this room.

186
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,323
Whoa.

187
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,370
So it's a nice little

188
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,983
bar.

189
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,990
They also had this area
called the Golden Guy,

190
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,670
which on is has a,

191
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,930
it's an area full of small bars that
only hold four or five people that are

192
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,764
smaller than this.

193
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,080
The smaller than that place,

194
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,300
like super small places.

195
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,750
So at this bar,

196
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,310
the guy just knows the collection is,

197
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,740
it's a wall full of vinyl
and then his son behind it,

198
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,770
behind the bar also.

199
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,000
So you was he,

200
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,690
he what you want to hear,

201
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:50,150
say a stew,

202
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,040
stevie wonder songs in the key of life
and he just walks right up to the spot.

203
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,080
I mean it's obviously Stevie,

204
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,940
but he just walks up to the,

205
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,420
a bunch of records.

206
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,480
He didn't even flipped
through it or nothing.

207
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,030
He just knew exactly what.

208
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,150
He just grabbed it,

209
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:05,984
put it on there.

210
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,440
So we're hanging out and it was just A.

211
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,780
I'm with the girl who was half Japanese,

212
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:12,231
half white,

213
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,950
but she knew Japanese and English
and she saw a friend there.

214
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,510
So they started talking to Japanese.

215
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,450
That's this white chick
there that's super drunk,

216
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:24,710
like blush on her eyes is all fucked up.

217
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,650
Weird.

218
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,350
Like she had that stereotypical
like central casting drunk.

219
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,453
You know what I mean?

220
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,350
Like she was going to an audition to be
a drunk lady right after she was at the

221
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:37,184
bar.

222
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,560
So they started talking in Japanese.

223
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,720
She talked to me a little bit.

224
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,880
I found out she lives in the
same neighborhood that I do.

225
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,451
Williamsburg,

226
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:45,284
Brooklyn.

227
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,551
She starts,

228
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,510
they started talking to Japanese.

229
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:47,721
She's like,

230
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:48,411
you know what they're saying?

231
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:48,621
I'm like,

232
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:48,861
Nah,

233
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:49,610
she just be in play.

234
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,421
And then she says,

235
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,260
is this your wife?

236
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,311
I said,

237
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:52,431
no,

238
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,310
that's not my wife said,

239
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,620
is that your wife said,

240
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:55,454
no,

241
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,473
stop my wife.

242
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,860
Snatch your wife.

243
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,723
I was like,

244
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,170
why'd you just ask me the same
thing three times in a row?

245
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,190
Because I just,

246
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,320
she just asked me.

247
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,000
I guess he was that faded dog.

248
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:11,360
Her face turns and she's just,

249
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,210
I could just see her getting upset.

250
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,710
She starts flipping out like,

251
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,521
fuck you,

252
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,440
you didn't have to be disrespectful.

253
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,693
No,

254
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,930
fuck him.

255
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,480
He thinks because he's
without Japanese girl.

256
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,120
He's well like started,

257
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,640
you know,

258
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,600
you don't go in,

259
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,420
you think you're some cool comedian.

260
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,180
So then it revealed
that she knew I didn't.

261
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,110
I didn't tell her who.

262
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:35,250
I didn't say my job or anything to us.

263
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,290
So she knew me.

264
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,550
She didn't show them.

265
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,580
So now she is in a different.

266
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,900
She's just super upset.

267
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,111
Fuck you.

268
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,510
You came all the way over here.

269
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,353
You're doing.

270
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,220
And then she just started getting ready.

271
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,073
She was like,

272
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,250
he's a monkey,

273
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,290
he's a monkey.

274
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:51,700
I'm like,

275
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,220
Yo,

276
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,790
this is.

277
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,790
Am I being called a monkey by a white
woman from Williamsburg in Tokyo right

278
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:00,510
now?

279
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,560
What the fuck is why you should take
pictures of her and put it up all around

280
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:05,394
Williamsburg.

281
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,610
I should I just send this dummy.

282
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,510
Have you seen?

283
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,520
I should have thought
about starting to fill.

284
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,380
But it was just so weird that she.

285
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,731
For Real,

286
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:16,470
all I did objectively,

287
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,420
I wasn't in their face.

288
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:18,330
So I'd have a.
