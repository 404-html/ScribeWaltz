1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,710
Hello Freak bitches

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,981
time I ever met.

3
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:07,690
Alex said that weekend didn't,

4
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:08,110
um,

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,910
that's the only time you've
ever heard that in Waco.

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:10,751
Waco first.

7
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,370
And then that I lost
touch with him after that.

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:12,930
He,

9
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,880
he really couldn't,

10
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,570
he liked me again actually
after I wrote the minister go.

11
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,790
It's like he didn't like me
after I wrote my book them,

12
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,540
which includes all this stuff about being
sneaking into Bohemian Grove cause he

13
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,970
thought I was too much of a
debunker of Bohemian Grove.

14
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,800
But then when I wrote
the metastatic goats,

15
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:29,110
he liked me again because
he felt that I was like,

16
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:29,771
oh,

17
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:30,760
it's kind of like a bit of a,

18
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,311
the minister.

19
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:31,581
It goes,

20
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:33,520
it's kind of like a
conspiracy book in a way.

21
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,540
Yeah.

22
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,141
So,

23
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:35,710
um,

24
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,060
how much different is it than the,

25
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,560
should we keep going
with this Bohemian Grove?

26
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:38,850
Yeah,

27
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,670
yeah.

28
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,110
I get it.

29
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,943
There's more to say.

30
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,650
Uh,

31
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,550
so Alex and Mike decided to
go in via the undergrowth.

32
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,331
Like I,

33
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:47,320
I saw them.

34
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:47,740
Um,

35
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,000
so they went in through the bushes.

36
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,830
They wouldn't see the bushes and
there was a lot of poison oak.

37
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,740
I wouldn't be at all.

38
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,340
Scott.

39
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,210
Just walked in.

40
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,630
Yeah,

41
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,020
man.

42
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,291
Rick,

43
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:56,771
the lawyer,

44
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,350
this kind of preppy lawyer,

45
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,390
um,

46
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:00,760
artillery.

47
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,593
The funniest thing I've,

48
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,750
I've missed out of this story was it
was the night before we were going to

49
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:05,584
infiltrate,

50
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,370
um,

51
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,760
Alex and Mike decided to
practice being preppy.

52
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,180
And so they were walking down there,

53
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,620
worked half a day or like the code or
outside their Botero rooms at talking and

54
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:20,290
a kind of a feminine way
about microprocessors.

55
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:20,861
Like,

56
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:21,131
you know,

57
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:21,580
I,

58
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,980
I just nano technology is the future.

59
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,710
I think Doug Previz die.

60
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,633
Yeah.

61
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,050
Oh,

62
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,760
I do Johnny Reid.

63
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,481
I tried to kill him.

64
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:31,760
Stop.

65
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,000
He jumped off a building
and land in a dumpster.

66
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,903
Right?

67
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,690
Oh my God.

68
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,651
How bad was he?

69
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:39,160
Broken.

70
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,993
Fucked up.

71
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,463
Fucked up.

72
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,483
And he throw,

73
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,150
throw punches into the
[inaudible] was a trip.

74
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:46,984
It was,

75
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,880
and he got a check from the government
and he gave me to like bartenders around

76
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:52,570
the first.

77
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,590
That's what people thought,

78
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:54,341
but he lived like,

79
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:57,460
he banged his head on the
dumpster and it fucking over dog.

80
00:01:57,461 --> 00:02:01,360
He lived and he give his check from the
government on the first of the bartender

81
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,780
and he torment the bartender to that
check was done and they throw him.

82
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:09,100
I put it first and they will last a little
about the 18th and 19th when I was a

83
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:09,341
kid,

84
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:09,781
I used to tour,

85
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:10,630
met Johnny read.

86
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,630
He'd gone through on the east coast,

87
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:13,830
he'd lock the bathroom from the

88
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,120
fuck.

89
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,080
You say you liked the batteries from
the outside of the east coast when you

90
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:21,580
leave a bar at night,

91
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:22,414
when they close up,

92
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,320
right.

93
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,680
They locked the bathroom and then they
put like a a lock bolts or if you break

94
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:27,250
in they can't.

95
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,290
He would go in the bathroom.

96
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,040
Johnny read like 11
o'clock in the morning,

97
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,240
the P and we locked them in there.

98
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,130
We leave them in there until
like six o'clock at night.

99
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,960
We come back to have a drink.

100
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,450
We'd opened the bathroom and
he'd come out like nothing.

101
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:39,010
I swear to God like nothing happened.

102
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,750
He was hilarious.

103
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,780
I mean one day I put my
Dick on a chair next to him.

104
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,610
He was sending out of Boston,

105
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:47,981
my friends,

106
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:48,151
like,

107
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:48,984
which it,

108
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,890
see what happens and he's like,

109
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,491
wow.

110
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:56,110
And he just got up Johnny
relived like maybe 12 years ago.

111
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:59,020
We used to give him bumps a coke
and get them riled up at the,

112
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,981
and they just leave.

113
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:00,980
Fuck you motherfuckers.

114
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,040
I'll fight all of this
that he just fucking leave.

115
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,300
Oh,

116
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,830
Irish Jew a Jew.

117
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,600
You ever have a girl you
dated to kill herself?

118
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,683
No,

119
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,783
they should've

120
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,200
put that fucking helmet.

121
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,490
Grad Committee.

122
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,430
Your fucking Dick.

123
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,940
He said,

124
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,380
kill yourself the first time.

125
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,300
And when you get to your destination,

126
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,630
well for police it's even worse because
we're perpetuating that situation.

127
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,620
So work,

128
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,570
we're the ones doing that cycle.

129
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,590
So when we see a 61 time I was a shift
commander in the eastern district and I'm

130
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,490
telling my guys,

131
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,580
stop pulling over old white ladies.

132
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,220
Stop pulling over that young cute girl.

133
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,113
Stop.

134
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,990
We focus on who committed the crimes
and who commit the crimes in Baltimore,

135
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,910
16 to 24 year old black males.

136
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,020
That's who's committing the crimes.

137
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,130
So focus on them.

138
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,730
That makes sense until you complete the
cycle and realize that you started doing

139
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:01,450
that because of institutionalized
racism in your organization.

140
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,320
And so when you are jacking up those
guys on the corner and you do find that

141
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,130
dime bag,

142
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,450
so you sent him to jail.

143
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,860
Now he can't go to work the next day.

144
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:11,290
So he loses his job and then
he can't make it to court.

145
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,640
So he gets his license suspended and then
he's driving and then you are focusing

146
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,100
on those 16 to 24 black males.

147
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,850
So now you're more
likely to pull them over.

148
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,200
Now you pull him over.

149
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,400
Now he has a suspended license.

150
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:25,180
Now he gets his license is revoked and
now he can't get to the job legally and

151
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:25,750
you just,

152
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,140
and now,

153
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,220
now he's dealt.

154
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,200
It's left with selling
drugs on the corner.

155
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,450
So you were were creating it.

156
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,160
We have to step back and realize what
the facts are and what we're doing.

157
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:37,060
And the number one
problem is the drug war.

158
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,770
And then we have money in politics.

159
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:42,730
These are our two big issues that we
have to solve before we get anywhere.

160
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,240
Well,

161
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,530
what does the money in politics,

162
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:45,364
how's that player?

163
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,640
So I don't think we can change anything
until we stopped having politicians that

164
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,350
are serving their donors
versus serving the people.

165
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,730
So somebody that's talking like me is
never going to run a police agency as long

166
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,290
as all their corporate donors are saying,

167
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:02,471
no,

168
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:02,711
no,

169
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:02,891
no.

170
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:05,260
You keep those animals and the
cages because that's what they do.

171
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:05,411
I mean,

172
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:08,680
that's a good joke in Baltimore that
police are actually the zookeepers.

173
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:09,610
She keeps everything in it.

174
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:10,570
Don't let it hit the county.

175
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,310
So,

176
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:11,961
so that's,

177
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:12,521
that's our role.

178
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,570
That's what we're doing.

179
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,920
So your mayors and your politicians are
going to continue to encourage that.

180
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,780
They're not going to take a risk and say,

181
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,471
all right,

182
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:23,530
how do we lower juvenile
possession of marijuana?

183
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,030
You know that I know you do.

184
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:25,931
You know,

185
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:26,764
you legalize it.

186
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,550
Yeah.

187
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,383
And you control it.

188
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,860
And rates actually go down.

189
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,990
Whether we're overseas
or were in Colorado,

190
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,010
your possession rates for marijuana
will go down among juveniles.

191
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,120
But we don't do that.

192
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:40,690
We keep looking at everything like we're
a hammer searching for now and we keep

193
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:43,030
looking for what we're
going to hit to stop it.

194
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,870
Instead of standing back and using science
and figuring out what are we actually

195
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:48,670
going to do to fix this problem,

196
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,900
what we'll actually have results.

197
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,450
There are,

198
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,620
there are behaviors.

199
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:52,071
This book,

200
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:53,780
the murderer is so fucking incredible.

201
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:54,051
This guy,

202
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:54,651
Richard Walter.

203
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:59,651
There are behaviors that people like
certain guys will rape and kill a woman,

204
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,160
but when they're raping her,

205
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,540
if she dies in the process,

206
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,970
they'll stop immediately because they
don't want the cops that think they're

207
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,804
freaks.

208
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,970
All kinds of weird shit.

209
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:08,181
Like,

210
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:08,301
well,

211
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,120
that was the thing about this green river
guys and he didn't want them to know

212
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,380
that he fucked them after they were.

213
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:12,920
That's right.

214
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,420
He didn't want to admit it because
he had an ego and ego and the guy he,

215
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,271
the way he got them to do it,

216
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:18,104
he was looking at it.

217
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,190
You wouldn't be the first guy.

218
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,360
A lot of guys who've done that's right.

219
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:20,780
Yeah.

220
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,171
He's like,

221
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:21,381
oh,

222
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:21,800
okay.

223
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,011
Yeah.

224
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,251
He goes,

225
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:22,581
Hey,

226
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:23,091
I actually,

227
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,710
I did do that.

228
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,340
I didn't do that.

229
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,780
I do like they used to,

230
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,643
they got a guy,

231
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,870
I'm a high level of terrorists who,

232
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:30,530
um,

233
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,530
had never seen porn and they
started showing him porn.

234
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,311
Oh.

235
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:34,791
And I said,

236
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,221
and he,

237
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:37,560
it was like the carrot and
the stick and he was like,

238
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:37,991
Hey,

239
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:38,930
do you want to see more of this?

240
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,780
Will show you more at the tellers scene.

241
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,470
And he started talking just to see it.

242
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:42,890
No,

243
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,380
he was a,

244
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,620
he became up in a very
strict Islamic society.

245
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,590
So they showed them some
dick slot as life shit.

246
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:49,424
What do you want to know?

247
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,700
These really hot girls so much.

248
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,140
Excited to tell you something,

249
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:54,500
man.

250
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:54,831
Bella,

251
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,120
Donna and Carol.

252
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,490
We'll get you talking if you have a,

253
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,790
and we'll get you throwing up,

254
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,910
but she puts up baseball bat
up around us and they say,

255
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,443
hey,

256
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,950
go to Fossa.

257
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,540
Yeah,

258
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:04,760
I'll,

259
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,180
I'll,

260
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,970
I'll freaking tell you whatever
you want on the podcast.

261
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,080
She was fucking great.

262
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:09,914
I'll say Kira.

263
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:10,311
Yeah,

264
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:10,820
she was cool.

265
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,653
Smart.

266
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,640
The school shooting and he went like this.

267
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,803
No,

268
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,653
no,

269
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,380
I wouldn't go with fucking
great greats in 10th grade.

270
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,500
Might be a little intense and
too much of a big word to you.

271
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,230
Be a little hyperbole there.

272
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,510
May never seen one of our parents.

273
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,200
How about that?

274
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,950
Fuck,

275
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,000
haven't I swear to God.

276
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:30,834
I have never seen her.

277
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,611
Not One.

278
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:32,540
You'd never seen her work?

279
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,131
Not a lot.

280
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,030
Did you not do research for that episode?

281
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:35,780
Yeah.

282
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,450
Well I know she's,

283
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,730
I went Jensen.

284
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,020
Yeah,

285
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,320
she does some heavy shit too.

286
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:39,930
Oh,

287
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,820
almost too much.

288
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:41,211
Where you go.

289
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:41,451
Okay,

290
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:43,070
well that can't be well on my podcast,

291
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:47,890
she said her skin was bad because
she was taken in her darn and said,

292
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,880
I think you're taking in
too much testosterone.

293
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,140
Too many loads.

294
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,973
Yeah.

295
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,260
She's got 20 a you got
a whore on your hands.

296
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,593
Testing.

297
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,330
You imagine if you take it,

298
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:00,101
somebody loads it.

299
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:01,970
It changes your biological profile.

300
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,050
Imagine if you're just dating.

301
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:03,571
A girl said,

302
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:05,360
come my fucking face keeps breaking out.

303
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:05,870
What's happening?

304
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,670
These fucking guys bust all over my face,

305
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:07,841
man.

306
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:08,810
I will push us in her.

307
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,070
Oh,

308
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,130
you're in just so much come
in her body probably annually.

309
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:16,000
A lot of it and go right orally.

310
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,710
I don't that doesn't make
that noise when I'm coming,

311
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:22,544
unless I'm fine.

312
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,380
Yeah.

313
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,080
I've never had that noise because
there's some hot about that though.

314
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,353
I would agree with you.

315
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,163
I agree.

316
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,350
I like a turbo slot and I have always
will to contact us and have her print up

317
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,044
that shirt

318
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,210
with glitter.

319
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:41,841
I'll bake.

320
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:42,674
You assured us

321
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,180
Hashtag [inaudible] why
don't we make them all work?

322
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:49,990
No,

323
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,823
it's not.

324
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,810
Take Turbo slept.

325
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,270
I guarantee you if you put out
a turbo sled shirt fell out.

326
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,780
It was to ask you for the girls
limited edition for women.

327
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,980
You don't have the balls.

328
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,843
I say dude,

329
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,530
you can fucking limited edition.

330
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:06,090
Just make 20 they'll sell instantly.

331
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:06,490
Zach,

332
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,420
when he tweets we get now about terrible,

333
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,863
terrible,

334
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,261
terrible,

335
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:13,830
so it's a great,

336
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,663
