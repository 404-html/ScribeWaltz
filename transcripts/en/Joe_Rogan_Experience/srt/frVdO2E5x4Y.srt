1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,590
Talking about your fucking tie. I could
talk about that quite a bit. Tie Bar

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,410
one. Boom. Gavin McInnes
you are lives sir,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,030
from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which I
understand you invented. Yes I did.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,190
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,050
When you see all the hipsters
walking around just like you,

6
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:23,370
do you feel proud sort of um, you
like the bay, the Daddy? Yeah,

7
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:27,030
I'm the godfather of
hipsterdom. I don't feel, I,

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,980
I've always been sort of anti follower.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,300
Like there's ways you can get
followers where you, you know,

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,590
don't piss anyone off.

11
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:38,910
And I probably could have a big following
with these super far right dudes.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,610
The Kuk service give
guys cuckservative yeah,

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,170
they call you a cock if you race mix
and stuff. Oh, you're that Jamie.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,930
I see you this time.
It's a first,

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,890
but I ostracize them is for being erased
mixer and then I could probably get

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,330
gamer followers, but I think it's gay to
play video games. Oh, like the Gamer gate.

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,140
Yeah. People. So I lost those
gay, homosexual male gay in the,

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,910
in the grade school sentence.
Layman. Why? Why is it, uh,

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,080
why is it lame to play video games?
Video Games are fun.

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,020
You're pretending you're
Batman and 40 years old,

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,330
you can be 80 years old and still pretend
you're Batman. Yeah, it's still fun.

22
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,460
Remember when we were kids were
probably the same age. How old are you?

23
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,610
I'm 45 48 so you'd see those guys playing
star wars when with 10 year olds when

24
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:27,600
they were like 13 and you felt
bad for those guys. That's true.

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,250
And now those guys,
the average video game players,

26
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,070
31 but why is it okay to play chess and
it's not okay to play like a real online

27
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:35,880
strategy game?

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,720
I've been thinking about that a lot
actually this week and a really? Yeah,

29
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,140
and I think it's because when you
play a silly game like poker or chess,

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,620
there's some social interacting going on.
Like you'll go,

31
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:50,910
you fucker,
right?

32
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,150
Like you're in the room and you're
talking to the guy and you develop a

33
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:55,830
relationship and then you know,

34
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:58,590
later on you guys are at a bar
or something and it's like,

35
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,560
you fuck me just like
you did. Like, you know,

36
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,690
two months ago with that
checkmate move or something.

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,340
So it's improving your relationship
with the people around you. Hmm.

38
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,280
That's interesting. I never really
considered that. But video games,

39
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:13,740
you're shooting monsters.
It's into the void.

40
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,850
It's a Ephemera you're
blowing away time like dust.

41
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,750
Well they found that video games actually
do improve cognitive function in some

42
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:26,490
sort of a strange way and even can improve
but improve your, your uh, vision. Sure.

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,220
Gray. It's Kinda crazy
cause you know your vision,

44
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:31,860
you're darting around the screening,
especially like first person shooters.

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,371
You know,

46
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:35,390
you're looking for things that are trying
to kill you or you're trying to keep

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,850
the cab drivers in London
have that overdeveloped part
of their brain that does

48
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,660
directions. Really. Yeah. It's,

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,090
they can physically see that part of
the brain is sort of in gorged the

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,830
directions part of the brain.
Whoa.

51
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:50,770
So if they do like an Fmr eye on them or
something like that. Yeah. It's like, uh,

52
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,900
someone who has cat scans could probably
identify a London cab driver. Whoa.

53
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:58,170
That's crazy. So that's good.
You're working out a muscle.

54
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:03,130
But I witnessed a cab driver screaming
and Uber driver last night, you know,

55
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,530
cause he's fucking Uber drivers.
They look like it's just,

56
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,990
it looks like a normal Camry
or something like that. Right.

57
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,650
And there's a cab driver and the cab
driver is pulling up these people that are

58
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,700
waiting for something.

59
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,930
And I don't know what the deal was with
the people had called an Uber or call a

60
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:20,530
cab and a new Uber. You know, sometimes
people do that. People are assholes,

61
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,990
you know, they'll call both and
see, let's see who shows up first.

62
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,270
And the Uber Guy was in front of
the cab drivers honking his horn,

63
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,870
screaming at them and the Uber driver
that you can always tell the Uber driver

64
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,890
because they always have an iPhone and
one of those little iPhone holders so

65
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:39,190
they could type in the address and just
go. It's always like sitting right there.

66
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,560
Yup. And um, you know, I'm like,

67
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,230
am I about to see some shit go down
cause I was right next to it. I was like,

68
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:46,330
this guy's going to get out and kicked
this guy's ass or something's going to

69
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,210
happen. But nothing better
than seeing a live fight.

70
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,160
I've seen a lot of them couples to
male and female couples having fight.

71
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,030
If you go to New Orleans during Mardi gras
and she's wasted and you're just like,

72
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,490
I'm going to pull up a
chair and grab some popcorn,

73
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,150
but I love riffing with people and I
fucking hate cab drivers because they're

74
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,980
from another country and
they don't know how to riff.

75
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,830
Like the guy that brought me here,
I'm like,

76
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,810
what's going on with the traffic
on the other one? He goes, what?

77
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:17,830
These these years going that way?
Yes, dude, what do you think? I mean,

78
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,150
we're not in traffic. This traffic
right there and he's like, oh,

79
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:26,300
he's maybe the had of going
someplace maybe. Yeah, I know.

80
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,270
I'm trying to get into like, are they
shopping? So you want the small talk?

81
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,790
I want the small town.
I don't want the small talk.

82
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,880
So when I get the small talk I'm like,
I have to pull my earphones out. What?

83
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,770
What do we,
oh yeah,

84
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:41,920
I guess they're going to
give it up because you've
been abused by immigrants for

85
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:45,310
so long. I want to riff with
barmaids. I want to riff with drivers.

86
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:48,400
I want to riff with the woman I'm
ordering my coffee from and I just,

87
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,500
I just see these immigrants
doing these jobs and I go,

88
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,270
these are teens jobs were in the teens.
Oh,

89
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,740
like driving cars or teens jobs. Yes.
Really? Well, I actually, you know,

90
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,390
I drove a limos for a bit when I was
in my twenties, my early twenties. Um,

91
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,530
but um, what's mad at
Jamie as Flemmi? Let me,

92
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,500
let me extract, uh, elaborate a
little bit here in 2015 with Jay,

93
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,180
a unemployed teens everywhere
and unemployed college students.

94
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,030
They should be driving camps.
Now. I've traditionally,

95
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:24,031
I liked the idea of Archie bunker with
the stubby cigar and the tweed hat saying

96
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,850
that he saw a prostitute die right on
this corner as we drive. That's ideal.

97
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,420
Right.

98
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,410
But I'm saying as far as fixing the system
now I want teens doing immigrant jobs.

99
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,120
See, I don't want teens driving.
Definitely. Yeah. No Day. No,

100
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,160
I didn't like the way I
drove and I was a teenager.

101
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,350
I don't want anybody like me
driving me and I don't mind, uh,

102
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,140
immigrants as long as I can ask them
like where they're from and like you're

103
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:48,760
going to learn some
weird shit about people.

104
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,610
That's what I asked the guy here I go,
it's English.

105
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:53,410
He's just massacring the English language.

106
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,470
I'm watching someone just
murder it is his place and I go,

107
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,720
no, you mean is the place
we're going to a company. Yes,

108
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,350
he's placed company and
there's no interest in learning
the language that I go,

109
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,940
how long you've been here for.
And he goes six year,

110
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,190
I'm like six year fives in Armenia for
six years. I would be Armenian poet. Yeah,

111
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:16,880
but he could just go to Glendale and
fit. Right, exactly. I almost asked that.

112
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:20,510
I almost said, I almost said, why do
you only hang out with Armenians? Right.

113
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,340
Like had assimilates anymore.

114
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,230
I like Armenians cause there
the last unabashedly masculine

115
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,530
like ethnicity in this country.
Like skins or machismo sort. Yeah,

116
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,600
that's true too. But they've,
they've integrated more and
to the American culture,

117
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,850
especially in southern California,
Armenians,

118
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:43,730
they walk around with gold chains
and wife beaters on and yeah,

119
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:48,440
those string vest. I have a friend,
he's Armenian, his name is Armen,

120
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,900
which is hilarious. And uh, you know,

121
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:55,340
he was talking about this girl to
talk shit to him and he's like,

122
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:55,941
and you know what?

123
00:06:55,941 --> 00:07:00,400
And this fucking bitch was Armenian
like you don't know any better. Like,

124
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,570
like they have like special rules.
I,

125
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,940
there was this Armenian
dude I knew a long time ago.

126
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:09,860
He's an enforcer for a loan shark and a,
he's in jail now for double homicide.

127
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,100
But he gave me the best tip about
picking up chicks. He goes, when,

128
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,810
sorry in Brooklyn,
cause I'm drinking beer.

129
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,100
When you're with women,
right?

130
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,620
You say yes to everything. If
she's late, he say no problem.

131
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,550
If she don't show up for dead, you
say no problem. Don't worry about it.

132
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,840
You pay for everything you say.
It's okay if she's rude to you.

133
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:40,250
Even if she hit you, you say, oops. You
know, you just let it go. Yes, yes, yes.

134
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,670
Then the second she say,
I love you.

135
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,020
You turn that bitch around and you
fuck her in the ass and you punish or

136
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:52,070
followed up bullshit. You put
your through. Whoa. And it's true.

137
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,790
I think that guy's doing it wrong.
He is in jail.

138
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,300
Didn't work at all. And
Actually, oh, post the real jail,

139
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,770
not just jail. Jail. What did he
do? He murdered two people at once.

140
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,030
Double homicide. Yeah. That's
a, that'll put you away.
Yeah. People frown upon that.

141
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,140
It's,
well,

142
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:17,141
we've noticed a pattern over time since
cave days where when we allow that it

143
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:19,730
gets worse.
It gets worse and worse and worse.

144
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,670
And that's one of the most amazing
things about human history.

145
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,600
How frequently people were just killing
each other up until really recently.

146
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,520
Yeah. I, uh, I was a at a place
recently, last week actually,

147
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,630
that didn't have a, they didn't have
cable, they didn't have internet,

148
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,180
but they had a stack of DVDs.
And so we said, all right,

149
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:41,930
well we got here and we watched,
uh, gangs of New York. Right.

150
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,520
And you know that opening scene with Liam
Neeson's crew versus Daniel Day Lewis,

151
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:50,690
his crew. Yeah. Battling with fucking
machetes and axes and shit like that.

152
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,050
That's not that long ago.
And that movie was hyperbolic,

153
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:59,051
but there like a claw lady who had the
clause build the butcher was a guy.

154
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,050
Yeah, he did. He was a butcher.

155
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,860
He did have a fucking glass eye and
he probably did kill a gang of fucking

156
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,800
people. Yeah, yeah. Well you look
at life expectancy and you go,

157
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,890
people died really young back
then. But no, I think the,

158
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,450
those stats are skewed by the number
of people who died in childbirth, five,

159
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,120
10 years old,
20 and a fight.

160
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,510
There's plenty of guys that live to 75
but so many of so many people died young.

161
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,930
Then it fucks the stats.
And you think everyone died at 30 yeah.

162
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:31,950
Stats are interesting like
that, right? Like you gotta
go, Oh, how is that possible?

163
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:36,860
And then you look, oh, I see. It's because
so many people were murdered. Oh, okay.

164
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,730
Well, it's going to seem that
today. You look at old photos,

165
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:41,940
like you've got that old mug shot,
uh, who is that? Rosa parks. Yeah.

166
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,850
You're the first guy to guests
that correctly. Oh really? Yeah.

167
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,920
And you see they're all cross site in
them and I she's not, but I realized, Oh,

168
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:54,921
you run a fucking all out brawl and
your retina got separated from your eye.

169
00:09:56,251 --> 00:10:00,350
And then it was just, oh well I'm across,
I'll look from now on. I lost one eye.

170
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,060
This eye right eye doesn't
work, but that's fine. Yeah.

171
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,850
They didn't fix anything back then.
I have a buddy,

172
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,120
I put this on Instagram yesterday
is a fucking nasty picture.

173
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:13,260
My buddy got a staph infection and uh,
it became Marissa,

174
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,580
do you know that medication
resistant staph infection. Oh. Oh,

175
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:22,020
it's disgusting. I knew if a
guy had that so bad. Oh my God,

176
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,200
that's fucking gross. How
deep is that whole? Well,

177
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:30,180
they had to open him up that the big scar
up the knee was because the infection

178
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:30,871
was so bad,

179
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:35,250
they had to cut him open like a fish
and they had to disinfect the area and

180
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:38,820
drain the area. But it all came
about because his knee was swollen,

181
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,510
so he had to get his knee drained and
he got his knee drained and he caught

182
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:45,300
Mercer at the hospital and
he doesn't know. You know,

183
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,620
you don't know where you catch it in.

184
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:50,980
A lot of guys get it from
Jujitsu cause you Jitsu you're,

185
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,700
there's a lot of scratches
and a lot of abrasions.

186
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,480
They actually have specific soap that
they've developed just to keep your, uh,

187
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:59,860
your skin flora,
your outside skin flora.

188
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,540
And I was talking before the show about
how Jujitsu ruined your back. Well,

189
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,190
it definitely hurts stuff. Stop
the Jujitsu. It's lose lose.

190
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:10,920
What's the win? You learn how
to choke people. It's very fun.

191
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,290
It's like the most
advanced version of chess.

192
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,950
[inaudible] everyone says that about
every sport. Yeah, they do. I know.

193
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,120
It's like everybody calls chess boxing
his chest. It's like people say,

194
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:25,020
well that's, that's our version
of the word nigger know. You know,

195
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,510
like they do that.

196
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,000
It's like that expression like gay people
like to say that with the word Faggot

197
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,870
or if I've heard that with
tranny I that with long hair.

198
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,140
These dudes who we did an article
about him vice long time ago,

199
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:40,530
but guys who were super serious about
long hair and getting through that awkward

200
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:41,364
phase,

201
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,330
they call it what it's like here and then
someone goes get a haircut and they go,

202
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,040
that's our version of nigger.

203
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,930
Oh that's like our version of being
dragged behind a truck. Oh my God,

204
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:52,590
I got Jasper,
Texas.

205
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:57,250
Who behind a truck is pretty much
the worst thing that can happen.

206
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:02,000
You haircuts don't feel like anything.
Somebody really said that. Yeah,

207
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,520
they should be beaten.
Yeah.

208
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,690
That person should be thrown to
a maximum security penitentiary.

209
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,770
Should be dragging and chores.

210
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,860
Just just have them get their ass kicked
and don't drag them on a truck to the

211
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,720
Diet,
dragging them behind a truck for 15 feet.

212
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,400
Cause that probably kill my kill you.
It won't kill you. But it hurts. Like,

213
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,610
I couldn't imagine your head depends
on how you protect your head, you know,

214
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,720
cause you might hurt your elbow and then
lift your elbow up and then you face

215
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:28,170
plant and then it's over.
Right. Cause you know how,

216
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:32,710
how strong are you mentally to let
your elbows just grind down to nothing?

217
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,850
Because once that 15 feet starts, you
don't really know when it's going to end.

218
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,630
I mean they might say they're
going to take you for 15
feet, but you, you know, no,

219
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,520
you have to faith that they don't just go

220
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,550
fucking gas and Oh my God,
I think it might be worse
than drowning. Met 15 miles.

221
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:55,630
Yeah. It's worse than trousers
being buried alive, buried,

222
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:59,290
alive. I don't think it would be as
painful. It'd be horrific and terrifying.

223
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,230
Drowning they say is actually fairly
peaceful once you just give it. Right.

224
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,150
It's like there's the struggle then
you give it them. How would they know?

225
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,700
Burn drowned,
burned alive.

226
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,120
Maybe they can test the stress levels
like the amount of genuine dead on the

227
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:15,340
cadaver or something.
I don't know why you'd bother to do that.

228
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,280
Let's go burned alive.

229
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,350
Top drag mine at Chuck to
drowning three in Canada,

230
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:27,060
we say buried. Buried alive for
I say buried. Oh, you do? Yeah.

231
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,950
What do people say? Buried? Buried. How do
you pronounce this? Space? Berries. Nas.

232
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,880
A varied NASA. NASA. How
do you say it? Nassau.

233
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,750
Bahamas. Once. Two A's. Why is there a
second day different than your first day?

234
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,240
NASA. That's true. It's
not n a s e h. Hmm.

235
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,890
NASA. NASA, NASA, NASA. But what,

236
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,690
what does some people say but it's
secondary. NASA. NASA, Canadian say NASA.

237
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,730
But why would you say NASA
doesn't know? W you're right.

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,600
That's stupid. You're right. Wow.
I'm learning a lot today. Fixed it.

239
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:16,260
It's weird. It was like black
people love acronyms. Like, uh,

240
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,620
like, like fame stands for,
you know, forget anything.

241
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:23,320
Me and uh, every one. You
know what I mean? Well,

242
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:28,120
I think it's a sign of late years when
you get into the word rather than go look

243
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:32,830
it up. And they'll be like,
library where they keep the lies.

244
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,080
I know that's different and you're like,

245
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,250
why don't you move past just the
fucking word library and get into like

246
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:42,910
publishing or what gets
published and what doesn't.

247
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:46,480
I don't need you to take apart the
syllables things. My favorite is fear.

248
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,320
False evidence appearing
real. No, no, no, no.

249
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,100
You should be fucking

250
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,510
scared. This some shit that'll kill you.
I'll tell you. That is the biggest way.

251
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,040
Worse and racism and anything else.

252
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,200
The biggest albatross on black
Americans neck is this vision. This,

253
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:06,030
this assumption that the
world's out to get you. Mm.

254
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,980
And there's no sense in trying. You can
go to law school, you can graduate Alma,

255
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:12,480
come latte or whatever it's called.
Uh,

256
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,280
you won't get a law job because you're
black. So they go, well fuck you world.

257
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:19,940
Like when the Ferguson riots where
there were cops are killing us,

258
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,240
we're fighting back and you go,
cops aren't killing you.

259
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,190
Stop assuming that killed
that one guy. Yes. Sort of.

260
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,980
But that the Ferguson one
was the worst example.

261
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,040
It's weird how examples get picked up
and then people run with like the worst

262
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,040
one. It's like, like Ferguson
was, that was a bad guy.

263
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,940
There was a guy that had just committed
a robbery just before had punched the

264
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:44,600
cop,

265
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,600
was in a fist fight with the cop and got
shot at close range shot and then then

266
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,130
shot him.
And then people like hands up don't shoot.

267
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:56,930
Like that became the narrative. Like, boy,

268
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,380
I don't know if there's a lot of evidence
that that hands up thing happened at

269
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:05,000
all. Not like a thug. I can get
you black guys shot by cops.

270
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,830
I can get you black guys killed by racist.
I can get you black guys who stuck,

271
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,400
stuck with their families and had kids
and got fucked over and her in jail for

272
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:17,510
no reason. Let's do those guys. It's
not sexy enough. Yeah. But like, oh,

273
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:20,210
here's a sexy one that don't understand,
didn't take off as much.

274
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:23,370
Like the Tamir Rice kid
and 12 year old kid, they,

275
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,230
that guy saw that kid for two fucking
seconds and shot him and killed him.

276
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,970
That's got a BB gun.
Yeah.

277
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,240
He had an airsoft gun and the guy who
shot him had a poor evaluations on his,

278
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,550
uh,
on his ability to handle stress,

279
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,460
had a breakdown during one
of his training exercises.

280
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,720
They said he was terrible at communicating
to the point where they didn't think

281
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:45,950
that he would be able to fix it.

282
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,440
They didn't think they'd be
able to make him a good cop.

283
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,890
He resigned from that police force
was picked up by this police force,

284
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,250
goes on to fucking killed this kid.
Then on top of that, they do, uh,

285
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,900
they have private people investigate
it or whatever groups they have

286
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:03,410
investigated and they decide
that what he did seemed normal.

287
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,580
Like that was the most recent finding
that what he did seem like he's got a

288
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:10,790
bunch of kids shooting people with BB
guns in that area and doing robberies with

289
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:15,650
BB guns. It was an endemic in that area.
I do not know that. It may be possible,

290
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:16,640
but either way,

291
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:20,230
you don't fucking shoot a 12 year old
kid within two seconds of seeing him.

292
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,450
I mean, if he's got a BB gun, you
just don't, you don't do that,

293
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,050
that the whole that. But to me
that one is like, oh my God,

294
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:29,900
you're dealing with a 12 year old
boys playing with a gun, a toy gun.

295
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,940
I don't know whether or
not there was an epidemic.

296
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,750
This is the first time I'm hearing that.
But that makes a little more sense.

297
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,880
But that seems to me like a way
better one to highlight that.

298
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,790
That's a serious man.

299
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,790
Well the elephant in the room with
all of this stuff is black failure,

300
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,653
white guilt.

301
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,230
And we need to explain why blacks are
in prison and have to explain why blacks

302
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:50,400
are doing badly and to say,

303
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:50,671
oh,

304
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:55,671
cops are fucking horrible racist pigs
and America's racist explains away the

305
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:02,070
failure and then there's no
culpability. And you go, oh,

306
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,410
that's why they're doing bad.
It's our fault.

307
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,140
And then you can get on with your day.
But no,

308
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:11,370
you're in jail because you'd
committed a crime. Right.

309
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:14,070
But the problem is like when
crime is all around you,

310
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:18,660
you grow up in this environment that's
the same as it was 30, 40 years ago.

311
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,100
I had this guy, Michael Wood, who was a
Baltimore cop on the show. And uh, he,

312
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,510
when he was a cop,

313
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,590
he was talking about this area
where they used to rest people.

314
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,810
This is the area where the drugs were,
are this areas.

315
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:35,370
We had a lot of violent crime and this
place and they found this a mandate from

316
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:40,360
1970 something 70 something.
And uh, when they, uh,

317
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,250
found it, it was the exact same
areas with the exact same crime,

318
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,690
like they were going over the police
reports from the 70s and you're like,

319
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:51,000
Jesus Christ,
so we fucking spinning our wheels or what?

320
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,720
Like this is the exact same areas,
the exact same kind of crime.

321
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,640
Like it's never going to change. It's
just a swarm of bullshit in this one area.

322
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,880
These kids grow up in this,
it becomes their environment.

323
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,240
They become institutionalized.
Like it, it becomes their,

324
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,830
their reality and then they're stuck.
And it's so hard to get out of that.

325
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,490
It's so hard for me to empathize with
that. I mean I look at green point,

326
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:18,080
which is a really poor Polish
neighborhood and it's crime-free,

327
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,490
there's drunks all over
the street passed out.

328
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:25,140
But it's crime-free you look at any
poor eastern European neighborhood like

329
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:27,480
Brighton beach in Brooklyn.
And I think of my dad,

330
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:32,481
my dad grew up so poor that his toes
make me dry heave cause he had his

331
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:35,340
brother's hand me down shoes
and they were too small.

332
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,430
And if you wear shoes too small,
after an hour you're like,

333
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,060
I'm going to kill myself. But his whole
life was shoes that are too small.

334
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,830
It looks like Chinese foot binding. And
uh, he fought every day of his life.

335
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,180
You know,
we suck with his brothers,

336
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:51,690
whom he fought every day and he got
scholarships cause he was smart.

337
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,520
But in Glasgow, being a student
is like the worst thing it can be.

338
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,470
So if you have a private school blazer
that's like wearing a Klansman uniform in

339
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:04,380
Harlem, he said like, you're fucking
shouldn't. And then they were like,

340
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,340
so his nose, he looks like a boxer.
He looks Kinda like Kerris one,

341
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,260
his nose is totally fine. It's got huge
elephant, like, uh, uh, inner tire lips.

342
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,850
I don't know why I said elephant,

343
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,450
big elephant lips and he made tons
of money and brought us to Canada,

344
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,630
raised a middle class family from poverty.

345
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,250
And he never complained about it at once.

346
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:28,380
And he would have a
million reasons to say,

347
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,800
that's why I fucked up and that's
why I'm in jail. I did go to jail.

348
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,920
But don't you think that
this is an environment like
you're talking about a guy

349
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:39,480
who lived in a certain area and
moved to another area, like had,

350
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,660
had the courage and had the
ambition to get out of that area.

351
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,340
And it became a thing with
Europeans. I mean, the United States

352
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,190
was essentially founded by Europeans
who weren't happy with Europe.

353
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,300
So these ambitious people that created
this new environment and these new places

354
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,210
and these new immigrants
who, uh, you know,

355
00:20:58,211 --> 00:21:01,120
all got together and they created these
communities like, uh, you know, I,

356
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,420
my grandparents lived in Newark and uh,
you know,

357
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,760
that was an Italian community
that all came over here.

358
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,500
They all came over from the
boat, from Italy. And um,

359
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,980
my grandfather on the other
side came over from Ireland.

360
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,930
But this is like a group of people that
were very ambitious and wanted to do

361
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:18,250
better.
So they came to America.

362
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,180
Whereas you're dealing with in the
African American community with people who

363
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:26,260
were slaves, African American,
why don't we say black?

364
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,150
So black community,

365
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,590
you're dealing with people whose
ancestors were slaves and then they are

366
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,170
released and they live
in these environments.

367
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:36,790
Then you have in places like Baltimore,

368
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,210
institutionalized racism where you're
really not even allowed to sell,

369
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,140
but they did.

370
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,050
They had places where you weren't
allowed to sell homes to black people.

371
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,530
Like it was.
Yeah,

372
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,660
that was then you want to talk about
what the Irish went through all of that.

373
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,240
There's an echo. The last few
lines. Excuses. I don't know.

374
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:56,650
I think you're in 2015 your lot
in life is who you are and you,

375
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:57,790
I was actually thinking about you.

376
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,610
I was beating off the other day
thinking about you and uh, no,

377
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,440
but I was thinking about
you socks on or off.

378
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,590
I had to take my socks off
cause I had to just in them,

379
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,920
but I used growing up punk rock.

380
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,070
You laugh at Hollywood and you
laugh at celebrity and you go,

381
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:15,430
they're all fucking phony losers.
But in my old age,

382
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:19,360
I'm starting to think maybe these people
are talented. And you were on that show.

383
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:21,490
What was it? Radio days,
radio news radio, right.

384
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,670
Look at all the other
people on that show you get,

385
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,800
I think you get 11 million listeners.
Is that right?

386
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,990
Probably a little more than that.
No, really insane episode of Hannity,

387
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:34,420
which is the most successful show
in the most successful network.

388
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,640
I think it's 4 million. Uh,
11 million is fucking insane.

389
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,460
I think Anderson Cooper
gets 100,000 viewers,

390
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:47,020
so I'm starting to think maybe
Joe Rogan is just a very talented,

391
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,280
like Jennifer Aniston. She was
on that show. Friends, right?

392
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,830
Courtney Cox had her a cougar town thing.
Normally I would roll my eyes at this,

393
00:22:56,831 --> 00:23:00,130
but I honestly was thinking about this
yesterday. I thought, wait a minute.

394
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:04,030
She went from friends to Hollywood.
Maybe she's just a really good actress.

395
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:05,950
Maybe she's just really good at her job.

396
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,620
And if you dropped her out
of a plane in Costa Rica,

397
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,090
maybe within a few days she'd have
like a coconut stand and you know,

398
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,520
maybe she was genetically
predisposed to be successful. Well,

399
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,610
I don't necessarily think
it's genetically predisposed,

400
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:21,310
but she certainly worked on
it. Yeah. But they all did.

401
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:23,920
Everyone on friends worked at,
I don't think they did. I mean,

402
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:26,920
Matt Leblanc's got a show now on showtime,
right.

403
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:30,580
And he has some show that no one
washed away where he's placed himself.

404
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,420
It's some new show. It's
like a, he, you know,

405
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,760
he let his hair grow gray and I don't
know what the fuck he's doing, but,

406
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,430
but the other people on the show,
the kind of,

407
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,270
they made a shitload of money and that
kills ambition. Right? I kind of stopped,

408
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:45,920
but she was the only one that
really developed film career.

409
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,730
And obviously she works
hard. But if that's the case
with almost all those shows,

410
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,910
it's like one person goes on to do.

411
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,640
And what I'm saying is maybe
that person was very talented.

412
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,930
Like Phil Hartman was on news radio.
Incredibly talented guy.

413
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,820
He would be rich and famous if his fucking
wife didn't blow his head off. Yeah,

414
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,670
no doubt. Unquestionably. But you know,

415
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,840
Phil Guy that was on the show
from kids in the Hall Day,

416
00:24:09,841 --> 00:24:13,130
Foley maybe he's not talented. No,
he's a very talented, but Dave,

417
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,230
he went through a fucking horrible
divorce and is still going through it.

418
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:22,160
Half the country's divorce. It's, this is
what happened. I'll explain to you. Um,

419
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,720
he had,
uh,

420
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,430
he was married while he was on news radio
and he was making more money then than

421
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:31,730
ever in his life. And so what,
like 30 grand is episode?

422
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,850
Probably maybe more than that.
I think I was probably making that.

423
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,180
So he's probably making more than
me. 50. Yeah, something like that.

424
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,260
And when they broke up and got divorced,

425
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:46,230
the judge ordered him to pay a
certain amount of child support bay,

426
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,500
not alimony and a certain
amount of alimony,

427
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:52,850
but the child child support was based
upon the amount of money that he was

428
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,970
making at the time.
And he had argued that was unreasonable.

429
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,220
And the judge literally said to him,

430
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,670
your ability to pay is,

431
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,850
has no relation to your obligation to pay.
And he's like,

432
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:09,110
what the fuck does that mean? Like
you, you have an obligation to pay.

433
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,620
I don't care what your ability to pay

434
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,810
if you remove the amount, if you
have a kid, you're obligated to pay.

435
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,760
But yeah, well you're
looking at, you know,

436
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,540
he's making several hundred
thousand dollars a month
and then all of a sudden he

437
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:28,490
has to pay half of that and he can't. So
he was like, within a very short order,

438
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,390
it was half a million dollars in debt
to this woman who is, in his words,

439
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:37,210
a raging cunt. She, she was always in
a crazy person. She's just in his, uh,

440
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,810
in his well, but again, alleged I'm
lacking empathy. And, um, Dante Nero,

441
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:46,700
do you know who he is? Beige
Phillips. Yes. Yes. His Shit
is, and I agree with them.

442
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,470
If your marriage failed, you fucked
up. You're the, with a few exceptions,

443
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:53,900
like Jim goads wife is fucking insane.

444
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,710
But if your marriage failed,
then you,

445
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,680
your boat sank and you're the
captain of the ship and man,

446
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,770
why did you have kids like Louis
C K he's bragging about, uh, uh,

447
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,110
is divorce and how awesome it was.
And I've talked to friends,

448
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,840
I know all his friends, I don't know
him, but they're always like, well,

449
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:16,070
she was a nut and she was a rich artist
type and she, she was, wasn't livable,

450
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,130
livable with Hubble. And I go, why did
you come in? Or then what'd you come into?

451
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,910
Crazy bitch. So even the few
exceptions where move, no,

452
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:30,230
that's what I'm saying. The
ship, you control their change.

453
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,880
If you're a real man you that's
crucial her. But you tend the kids,

454
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:39,330
people change. Like men change, women
change. You can't control change, change,

455
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,880
but you don't always,

456
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,060
sometimes he just wants a job there
that's saying you have a corporation and

457
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,420
your employees, you know, you say,
Oh, when my employees changed. No,

458
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,190
this is how we're running the company.

459
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,490
You guys have to show up nine to five
and we're going to do it this way.

460
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,770
We're making grapple Grumman's well,
sometimes things,

461
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,040
even though they're successful,
they fail over time. Like Pontiac.

462
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,690
The GTO is an awesome car, so it was a
trans-am. None of them exist anymore.

463
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,240
CONIAC doesn't it?
They should have adapted or not.

464
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:09,660
You should have made shitty or just look,
you did a good job.

465
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,750
Look at doc Martin Work of art.
Let's get outta here.

466
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,400
Doc Martins were punk skinheads shoes.
Then they were nineties grunge shoes.

467
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,130
Now they're lesbian footwear, and then
they went, let's be lesbian footwear.

468
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,070
We've got to adapt. Let's
become flew bogs. Right? Well,

469
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:25,200
this certainly you can adapt,

470
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:28,830
but you might be happier that
you might be happier breaking up,

471
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,070
giving her money and then finding young
girls and you can have sex with like

472
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:34,110
Lucy Kay is doing it. I'm against it. Why?

473
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,280
That's not the way it goes
and it's bad for the kids.

474
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,400
Okay. That I agree with you that I
agree with you and that's what's worse.

475
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,570
You need to have,
sorry to interrupt you,

476
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,620
but you have to have kids so you don't
have kids. Right. I have three. Oh,

477
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:52,650
that's awesome. Are you married?
Yeah. Oh, great. With wedding ring on.

478
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,920
The three kids you have are with
the her. Yeah. Well that's fucking,

479
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:59,520
I'm glad I can relax because every
time I talk about divorce and kids,

480
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:01,260
especially with people
in the comedy world,

481
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,370
I'm talking to someone who's divorced
and never had kids. Well it's,

482
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:05,370
it's very common,

483
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,970
but I am married specifically because
I have kids and then this, see, I mean,

484
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:10,650
I've always said don't get married,
don't get married.

485
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:13,230
Marriage as a contract with the state,
which I agree with.

486
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,810
Up until when I had
kids, I was like, look,

487
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,940
bringing a life into the world to me is
way more of a commitment than a legal

488
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:25,890
contract that you can get
out of with a lawyer. Right.
So like that, that contract,

489
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:30,891
the contract with the child was so much
bigger and so much more involving and I

490
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:35,190
had so much more commitment to raising
kids. I was like, okay, let's do it.

491
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,540
Like if you want to like if I get
divorced some somewhere down the line,

492
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,410
then you fucked up. Well, maybe not, you
know, maybe it's just people want to move.

493
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:47,370
No, no. I'll throw in the towel saying
is not while the kids are young.

494
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,570
I mean I'll do everything I can to
not because I just think for kids,

495
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,890
well I say that,
but God dammit.

496
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,840
I know a lot of God damn interesting
people that became interesting.

497
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,990
I'm not going to use this as an excuse
because I'm actually happily married.

498
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:06,290
But people that became interesting because
they went through childhood breakups

499
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:07,950
and they moved around a lot.

500
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,050
I mean Mike Tyson is a good
fighter because his childhood
was held and she wants

501
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,440
everyone to have a shitty
childhood so they become good.

502
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,420
Not necessarily good fighter,
but I mean like interesting people,

503
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:21,360
like every interesting person
than I know overcame adversity.

504
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,090
They went through some crazy shit. It's
a great point. That's a great point.

505
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,480
It's a hard thing. You have
children. Yeah, I got three.
So when you're, you know,

506
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,390
I'm sure you take care of your kids,
but do you think of it like, man,

507
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:34,200
I'm short of sheltering these children
from the very things that made me

508
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,540
interesting.
A lot of my friends that have kids,

509
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,650
we kind of go through that dilemma.
Yeah. But I got plans for that. I mean,

510
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:44,110
I don't want to send them, I want to send
them to boarding school. Yeah, for real.

511
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,220
Yeah. Boarding camp. Boarding school.
Really like send him away to go to school.

512
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,130
Every top producer at Fox News
went to boarding school. Okay,

513
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:53,320
well then don't send your kids
to boarding school. There you go.

514
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,930
You've got that nailed.
I keep thinking you're right wing,

515
00:29:55,931 --> 00:30:00,380
but you're not in some ways, in some ways
I'm, I'm, I'm a very, I'm an outlier. I'm,

516
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,250
I'm a middle of the road and
a lot of like I'm in the NRA,

517
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,650
but I support gay rights and you know,

518
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:10,240
and a million other things that pro
choice million other things that people

519
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,960
would associate with left wing.
Obviously pro marijuana, right?

520
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,520
Well your normal basically I just
don't believe in right or left.

521
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,820
I think most of it is bullshit and
these ideologies that you still have to

522
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,470
rigidly apply,
you know,

523
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:26,770
and you originally adhere to the
right or the left and you a, you know,

524
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,670
you automatically,

525
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,450
I had a conversation once
with this fucking guy at a
party and I'll never forget

526
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:33,580
this, he was talking about
Democrats. He's like, well,

527
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,210
we got to win the Senate because if we
win this cycle, we, what is this? We Shit,

528
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,260
what does this week it? You want a team?
Are you on a team because you're talking,

529
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:43,360
we like you owe it goes well.

530
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,940
There's a lifelong Democrat and like
you're a lifelong democrat. Yeah.

531
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,090
Do you know crazy Dallas
cowboys? I exactly what people
to be left alone I want.

532
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:54,100
Yes.
There's two in politics is two groups.

533
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:57,580
It's people who want to be left the fuck
alone and people who don't leave them

534
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:58,414
the fuck alone.

535
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:02,830
And I tend to go right on most
things because the right as,

536
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,950
as of today seems to want
smaller government than the left.

537
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:09,790
But that's not always true. Like George
W. Bush spent way more than Clinton.

538
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,000
I don't know if I believe that.
I think they just go where the money is.

539
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,880
I think the go with the money is, and
they go with the influences. You know,

540
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:20,170
we were talking before the show about
this thing that I'm doing with Anthony

541
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,100
Bordain where we're going to,
um,

542
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,630
an episode of his show that we're
going hunting for birds and we're,

543
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:30,190
we're going to talk about a public land
versus private land. And Steve Rinella,

544
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:31,450
who's a,
the host of this show,

545
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:35,800
meat eater who's on the podcast earlier
this week had a really good point about,

546
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:40,720
um, about politics. He's
like, he said, I'm a political
unit, was his words. He goes,

547
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:42,400
because you got the left,

548
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,430
which is trying to take away gun
rights so I can't support that.

549
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,560
And then you've got the right
who supports your gun rights,

550
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,750
but they're taken away private land.

551
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,840
They're taken away or public
land that is used for hunting.

552
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:57,100
They're selling a way to corporations.
And so he goes like, I'm kind of fucked.

553
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,730
He goes, cause then both hand, cause
he's a professional hunter, so on both,

554
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,760
on both sides. He's like, I can't
adhere to either one of these.

555
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,970
The rightest selling land
away to corporations to
what bill is doing is there,

556
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,600
there are many on in the Republican
administration and many on that side that

557
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:18,601
are supporting the rights of corporations
to either sell away or take away some

558
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,900
public land is right now used,
you know,

559
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,810
there's public national
parks and public areas.

560
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:30,400
When they find these resource rich areas
that they can exploit and make a lot of

561
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:32,890
money, then they'll sell
contracts. These corporations,

562
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,640
I mean this is what's going on in
Alaska with when they're talking about

563
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:40,070
drilling and give it time,
uh,

564
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:45,110
the free market will make nature
better. I mean, we saw that in Zimbabwe.

565
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:50,410
Macaby was starving the fucking wildlife
to death and then he started selling

566
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:51,290
off the land.

567
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,520
They realize that it is in their best
interest to have lions and fucking zebras

568
00:32:55,521 --> 00:32:56,450
and giraffes running round.

569
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,690
So wildlife started coming back and
that Cecil the lion dude was sort of a

570
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,490
result of the free market getting
involved in sort of thing.

571
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,030
But that's a very extreme example of an
insanely poor area. And on top of that,

572
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,740
one of the best versions of that,

573
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,550
there's a Louis Theroux documentary on
these African hunting camps and that I,

574
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,180
you know, I hunt. So I have these
conversations with people all the time.

575
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,370
The way they did it in Africa,

576
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,670
most of the animals that are
hunted on a regular basis,

577
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,200
now we're on the verge of extinction.

578
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:32,410
All these different like Nealon Elan's
and a different blocks and different

579
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:35,690
kinds of deer and antelope.
They're fucking dying off like crazy.

580
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,330
But now they have them,
these private hunting camps.

581
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,540
So they have thousands of
them and they're right,

582
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,420
but they're thriving so that people
can go over there and kill them.

583
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,550
Like it's this crazy catch 22 no,
that's fine. You can't do that in man.

584
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:53,180
It's like the guy found a Greenpeace
who's now kind of anti Greenpeace goes if

585
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:58,181
you want more forests by more wood
because you incentivize trees,

586
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,440
right?

587
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,120
But in order to get a real good hardwood
tree that's a hundred feet tall,

588
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:09,290
it has to grow for hundreds of years.
And if you chop all those fuckers down,

589
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,460
you're not going to have any,

590
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:13,340
not a way that you change the
environment in which these trees grow.

591
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:17,390
All the birds, a song, birds disappear.
They're nesting areas go away.

592
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,380
The environment completely changes.
Like there's a lot of issues.

593
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:24,810
You can't just say yeah but like
go in there and North America,

594
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:29,540
there's more trees now than there ever
was before. And that is a true cut.

595
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,020
More trees and more trees now know
a lot of them are small, skinny.

596
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,370
But that's because we like trees.
We need trees.

597
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,450
I look at like ducks unlimited,
right? Isn't that run by hunters?

598
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,400
So they are doing more for marsh lands in
the government. Ever could. That's true.

599
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:50,120
Yeah, that is true. So that's
because they want those lands.

600
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,830
Those are public lands. So like
the, the lands that they're,

601
00:34:52,831 --> 00:34:55,700
they're preserving those,
these habitats are public.

602
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,090
So what are these corporations doing
with this land? Like well look, fracking,

603
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:02,990
fracking is a huge issue. You know, things
awesome. Yeah. Well is it? Yeah. Is it,

604
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:06,250
it's not awesome if you live down
water from it and it doesn't feel well,

605
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,530
there's a possibility it could pollute
with definitely pollutes water.

606
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:10,364
This deck does not,

607
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:14,360
but there's definitely wells that have
been polluted by fracking. Uh, maybe one,

608
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,440
oh, come on man. That's not true.
Yes. Such a movie. Frack nation.

609
00:35:19,441 --> 00:35:23,810
It's one movie was the f quit. How many
fraud? Many wells keep tap water on fire.

610
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,750
That's that water was always flammable.

611
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,190
It's naturally occurring methane in
the water. There's burning springs,

612
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:33,720
New York and it's my thing.
I saw

613
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,740
they use centrifugal force,

614
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,680
um, that, that water was always flammable.

615
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:44,790
That's why the people frack there cause
there's methane in the water. Well,

616
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,830
I don't know if that's the
case and it's the case.

617
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,340
It can be that that's the case.
It's risky.

618
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,040
Just like an air conditioner
falling on your head is risky.

619
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:57,180
Everything has inherit miss. And where I
am in the Catskills, uh, my place upstate,

620
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,930
there's tons of, uh, of, of uh,

621
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:04,950
perfect land for fracking
and these people, all the
hippies, all the weekenders,

622
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:09,150
the city, it's as they're called,
I'm one of the ads. They banned it.

623
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,210
Mark Rufallo is one of the big
guys up where I am. Oh, the Hawk,

624
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,400
the Hawk bandit and these kids in my
neighborhood up there RNF Afghanistan.

625
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,430
So they're going,

626
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:25,140
they're risking their lives to get what
I call unethical oil oil from people who

627
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:29,670
stone woman to death because
we've considered natural gas.

628
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:34,170
Some sort of fucking 80% of your natural
gas is already fracked. All of Ohio,

629
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,250
Texas, that's all fracking. Well, it's
certainly changed. The price of gas.

630
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,640
Gas has dropped dramatically since
they started doing that, rack it up.

631
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,503
But I don't,

632
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,280
I'm scared of them polluting wells and
I'm scared of than ruining water supplies

633
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:49,800
and the,
the underwater underground water supplies

634
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,260
and la in general where me and
Ella and John and I'm a part of La.

635
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,420
That's a pattern I've noticed
here. Okay. Where you go.

636
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,810
Like I heard that you with
Greg Fitzsimmons and you
were talking about teachers

637
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,820
and you're like, the
children are our future. Uh,

638
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,690
they don't get paid enough and
it's Mark Marin's says that too.

639
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:13,080
I got in a fight with him and he never
aired my, uh, what the fuck podcast.

640
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,130
What's really why? Well,
here's my theory. Uh,

641
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,710
he claimed it was because I came out as
a trans phobe and what's our interview

642
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:25,410
is now incomplete and it would be weird
to release it without us discussing

643
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,270
trans, wait a minute, wait a minute.

644
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:31,320
You came out post post
interview as a Trans Phobe yes.

645
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,960
Why is having an opinion on something,

646
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:37,860
whether it's a negative or
positive opinion, why is
that a phobia exactly. And I,

647
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:42,580
that was my point. I said, your dad
cutting his cock off, you're scared.

648
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,860
That's scary. Like that would
be scary. You wouldn't be
like, good morning, I guess.

649
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:51,360
Mom, you'd be freaked the fuck out then
that's a phobia. So we're all transphobic.

650
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:56,100
So I said Transphobia is
perfectly natural. Well, um,

651
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,630
I think I have you got your shit for
this dude talking about the MMA fighters.

652
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,560
But it's only because of this.
This guy was a guy for 30 years,

653
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,160
became a woman for literally 24 months,
started beating the fuck out of women.

654
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,640
And if you watch the fights, you're not
talking about even a skillful person.

655
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:15,270
It's just like it's, it's someone who's
just got a completely different frame.

656
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,210
I mean,
the way throwing these these girls around,

657
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,640
but that's,

658
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,510
I support your right to become a woman
if you want. I don't give a fuck.

659
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,930
If you want to know, well, I
do. Obviously I support it.

660
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:32,931
But here's a big misnomer with
this whole live and let live thing.

661
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:36,750
Like Anthony Comea says, hey, you
want to be, you want to get married?

662
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,340
You want to be gay going, I
don't give a fuck. Fuck you.

663
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,100
Now that we've legalized gay marriage,

664
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,290
people are getting fined like
a couple in upstate New York.

665
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:49,900
I find $13,000 for not having a
gay marriage in their living room.

666
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,090
What? I don't understand
what that mean. Well,

667
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:55,450
they usually host marriages
that there. Oh, they said, no,

668
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:57,250
we don't want to do this here
because it's our living room.

669
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,840
So I'm a live and let live dude.
And now that gay marriage is a thing,

670
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,440
people are being forced to go
against their religious beliefs.

671
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,160
So it looks like gay
marriages let everyone be,

672
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:13,660
but it's actually fucking with Christians.
And that's a very rare case, isn't it?

673
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,990
Isn't that a pretty rare case where
someone's having these marriages in their

674
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:20,640
living room? Yeah, I don't
think you should. I don't
know. You want to talk rare,

675
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,740
the gaze wanting to get married.
He's rare. How rare is it?

676
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,790
They don't want to get one on my block.
No, my, my neighbors are getting married.

677
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:31,650
These two facts upstate
and, and they, they,

678
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,820
they don't use that word of term.
They go, uh, yeah, just proposed.

679
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,080
And I'm like, oh great. And
then one of our mutual friends,

680
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:44,440
cause isn't this exciting? And
they go, no, they have eight,

681
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:49,270
like eight, some eight sims. Oh. Like
I've bragged before. I've had a bunch of,

682
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,880
but in the Hetero world,
that's hot shit.

683
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,230
But to them I'm a fag because you've
only had three sons. Only at three.

684
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,780
We have eight sims all the time.
And I'm like, I can't even picture,

685
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,040
like what are the, your legs go?
Where's the, what is the second column?

686
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,440
Your hair,
it must look like mine.

687
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:09,610
But with come like he must
have tally towels trick.

688
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:12,820
They're just holding it in sucking
toes. I mean, even a force him.

689
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,870
Has He ever had a threesome?
Yes. It's hard to maneuver.

690
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,140
You feel like you're walking around with
a clipboard like overrated. You, okay,

691
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,540
how are we doing over here?
It's, it's, it's missing.

692
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:27,310
The critical aspect that makes sex great
is when you're really into someone and

693
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:29,770
they're really into you.
Like that's the perfect example.

694
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,140
When you can't get that
prostitution is nice. Second,

695
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,710
when we can get what two people
are really into each other.

696
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:38,640
Like you're sharing a moment together
and then there's this other person and

697
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,360
we've on me. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.

698
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:44,120
I guess how much should I do over here on,

699
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,580
even if you go on a trip with three
people, it's kind of weird. It can be,

700
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,130
but it could be awesome. It
depends on how they gel. I mean, I,

701
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,510
I've had friends that uh,

702
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:56,110
their wife was a freak and they have a
threesomes or their girlfriends a freak

703
00:40:56,111 --> 00:40:59,500
and they have threesomes and they'd go
out and hunt for girls and they do it on

704
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:02,830
purpose and they enjoy it. That
must be fun. And believe me,

705
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:04,630
I would not work for my
wife brought a chick home.

706
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:06,640
I would not be kicking her out
of bed for eating crackers,

707
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:10,450
but I've never experienced that. But I
think that my wife fucking lied to me,

708
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:14,260
by the way, when I was courting
her, she goes, I might be a lesbian,

709
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:15,910
so don't be surprised
if I bring chicken home

710
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,620
and we're 10 years in where the
checks were, the fucking threesomes.

711
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,340
Well that's a crock of shit.

712
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,780
But the reason you have threesomes
and I guys, if you're listening,

713
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,410
never turn it down, struggle, work
hard, they're really hard to set up.

714
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,650
It sounds like a pop 10 yeah,

715
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,550
I would say I've probably had about four
or five and a good two thirds of them.

716
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,660
I was like a tour manager. Like when are
you in town? Okay, right. Setting it up.

717
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:47,870
Well, maybe at eight 30, one
of them I had to fake look,

718
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:50,480
you go to the bar and you pretend that
I know you from high school and you go,

719
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:54,320
oh my God. And then we'll go upstairs
to your hotel. You had to fake it. Yeah.

720
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,270
So you got to do those though cause you
beat off about them, uh, in your sixties.

721
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:03,020
Ah, I see. So you're filming it
with your eyeballs taking it all in,

722
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:07,910
but the actual act itself is
kind of annoying. It can be,

723
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,400
and that's why I was saying to the gays,
they don't,

724
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,210
they're never going to have kids. They're
fucking my age. You have eight Sims,

725
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,110
you take kids and monogamy at a
marriage. What's left? Uh, they,

726
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,960
I think they want to be able to visit
each other when they're in the hospital.

727
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:26,270
Yeah. That old thing. That's like
with the portion where they go, uh,

728
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:29,030
what if you're dead rapes? You can
you get an abortion then and you go,

729
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,850
you mean all one time that happened.

730
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:37,010
Why are we dictating policy based
on this crazy scenario? Yeah.

731
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,160
That's, I think you should be able do
whatever the fuck you want and don't you,

732
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,370
yeah. You shouldn't have to have
lesbians married in your living room,

733
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:45,680
but if you're gay, you should
be able to get married. Right.

734
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:50,770
I don't think you should have to go to
a place totally replace half my shit is

735
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,870
there. Bullshitting. What do you
mean they don't want to get married?

736
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:58,700
It's just as something to
fuck with us. Don't you think?
Some of them do three. Ah,

737
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,460
and they're lesbian. You're
fracking number one. Well,

738
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:08,930
you know, k's or 1% of the population, say
half of them are less than 1%. It's 1%.

739
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,930
So it's one out of 100 is gay. Yeah.
Like thinking of your classrooms,

740
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:15,590
how many are lying though?
How many are gay? And they
just, they just never commit.

741
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,510
Is it? So maybe it's two out of a hundred.
Uh, we all know, well, you're gay.

742
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:23,780
You're gay. Suck a dick. Yeah. But
we all know one closet Osi, right?

743
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,490
How many people? He's a fag.
But this whole thing like, oh,

744
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,040
we like the far right
religious guys going,

745
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,530
we need to get our kids away from
gayness or they're going to go gay.

746
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,190
Suck a million dicks. Margaret Cho
says, she goes, if you think gay,

747
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:40,460
is it something something you can learn?
Then I got some bad news for you.

748
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:43,880
You're gay. I could suck one Dick
Right now. I'll suck a dick right now.

749
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:48,320
You're ready, right. Okay, here we
go. Oh, oh, there's a gun to my head.

750
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:51,710
Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on. Still got gay.

751
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,840
He just sucked a Dick Right now,
here's my 999th cock.

752
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,650
This guys, I've been a hostage
for two months. Oh, well

753
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,170
I think you'd get way better at it.

754
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,110
I think it'd be more efficient because
you realize if you're more efficient and

755
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:09,020
you pretended you were into it, it
would go by quicker maybe. Yeah.

756
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:13,550
It's like when your wife faces
will come quicker. I think that's,

757
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,460
I think that's what's happening
and give a shit if my wife comes,

758
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,610
so how dare you. So, but
you know, if she's turned on
you get more excited. Right.

759
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,260
That's the idea. Yeah, baby. Woo.

760
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,410
You don't people that talk
about women who were bad in bed,

761
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,410
that's like a painter saying
that the canvas has bad.

762
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,660
She's just your canvas.
You have to maneuver and that's no,

763
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:39,480
no reason why gays and
mucking mind pat and bed,

764
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,770
male and female women can't be bad in
bed. That's not true. Girls were awkward.

765
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:47,340
They get, they grind on you. We're
they can. You slap her and you say,

766
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:51,000
don't do that. Can we go and turn
over when you're talking real here?

767
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:55,670
So like this Mark Marin thing. Tell me
what happened. Okay, so we were in a,

768
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,270
we did the podcast and he,

769
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:03,170
he's got that La fucking thing where
they fucking thing where it's like,

770
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,230
ah, I'm not going to look it up.
I'm just going to go by my emotions.

771
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:10,620
Woman politics. Basically. Jesse
Ventura, it's like this too. He was like,

772
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,510
I saw you and Jesse Ventura, the one where
you had your shirt off and he was all,

773
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,540
I see. Yeah. He's like,

774
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:19,230
what you're saying is people and
other countries aren't as go. Yeah.

775
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,500
Paypal in a mirror. I say somewhat in
Mexico and he goes, Oh, I go to Mexico,

776
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:26,640
which grade? And I go, Jesse, that's cool.

777
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,770
That's your experience.
That's anecdotal evidence.

778
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:30,510
I'm talking about millions of people.

779
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,950
I met a black guy who had a Nobel
peace prize in physics. Okay.

780
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:38,760
So black people are awesome
at physics. Um, anyway,

781
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:41,820
he was doing this La
thing and uh, he was, uh,

782
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,920
well the problem with education is I don't
think people get paid enough to teach.

783
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,970
I think it should be a more prestigious
position. They get paid 60 bucks an hour.

784
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,980
Who Does? New Jersey teachers.
Okay. One state, no, California.

785
00:45:55,981 --> 00:46:00,440
They get paid shit. They probably go
down to let's say 40 bucks an hour. Yeah,

786
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:03,060
an hour worked per hour worked.
You get you.

787
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,390
Can you imagine if in your summers
off, that'd be nice. Die of boredom.

788
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:09,570
But I don't know if that's true.
Like so like while they're in school,

789
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:12,410
they're getting $60 an
hour. So we're worked. Yeah.

790
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,510
How many hours do they
work at Day Jack? Shit. Oh,

791
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:18,060
but we have to do a lesson
plans, right. Fucking don't.

792
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:19,920
You've been teaching that
same class for three years,

793
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,080
but they still have to do
lesson plans, don't they? They,

794
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,260
they've just in autopilot it's karaoke
at this. So what are you saying?

795
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:28,470
They should get some sort
of an alternative income on
resize it and they should

796
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:31,920
be, it should be possible to fire them.
And that's what I said to Mary. Oh, okay.

797
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,590
I agree with that.
You said that it's whole systemic thing.

798
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,880
I fucking hate that word.

799
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,590
It's the stomach and there's not just
one thing that can nail it. And I go, uh,

800
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,693
yeah,
there is,

801
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:46,730
it's called getting fired and in Harlem
they have charter schools now and

802
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:51,030
teachers can be fired.
They are fucking thriving.

803
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,190
Blacks in Harlem are getting educated
and it's kicking ass and the left is

804
00:46:56,191 --> 00:47:00,060
floundering because they hate, they
like blacks as their little pet victims.

805
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:04,140
And when the free market helps them,
they go, wait, don't help my victims.

806
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:07,870
That's mine. And I saw the New York
Times headline. It said, uh, uh,

807
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,370
though charter schools thrive in Harlem,
it's not a fix all.

808
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,110
And the article was basically saying,

809
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,570
not all black kids can go to
charter schools in Harlem.

810
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:17,340
So they're not that great.
Oh, that's hilarious.

811
00:47:17,341 --> 00:47:22,170
Open up more charter schools
have more than one thing.

812
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:24,870
It's called getting them fired.
And then it got weird after that.

813
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:27,680
And he was just reading my Wikipedia
page and talking about shit and,

814
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,270
but what was it? You're trying to find
things that you do wrong? No, it was just,

815
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:33,160
he didn't want to be there.
So he was like,

816
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:35,590
what do I ask this guy about
it and didn't want to be there.

817
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:39,320
So he had shut down after that.
Yeah. Is it? Yes. So what,

818
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:40,500
what do you think was the trigger?

819
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:44,820
Just the fact that you weren't willing to
think I nailed him on education and uh,

820
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,650
he didn't like it. You pay, he probably
thought we're not releasing this.

821
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:52,120
And then he went to Wikipedia like,
Hey, I saw that you did this power trip.

822
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,350
That's a power Marin. Well, that's
doing that and not releasing it.

823
00:47:56,351 --> 00:48:00,540
Like I have conversations where I don't
agree with people all the time and I got

824
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:05,020
rid of the hill. Well, I don't mind
disagreeing with somebody, you know,

825
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:08,440
but it's just funny man. The comments
like, people say like, Oh you,

826
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:10,870
you and that fucking guy fought
like cats and dogs. No, no,

827
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:14,470
we just didn't agree on things like,
right. I shake their hand afterwards have,

828
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,910
I haven't had one guy,

829
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:19,420
one guy in the history that Brian Dunning
guy was probably the one guy because

830
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:23,860
he was so fucking dead in his head.
His brain was so rotten,

831
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:28,060
he just couldn't, he couldn't understand.
He couldn't grasp simple concepts.

832
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,100
I don't believe in disagreements.

833
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:34,060
I on something that one guy has more
information than the other guy and I would

834
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:37,330
just want to get there, uh,
to the right answer. Well,

835
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,760
I also want to see how
you got to your answer.

836
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:42,820
And there's sometimes is not a
right answer or wrong answer.

837
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,000
It's just this is how you look at
it. And even though if I, and some,

838
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:50,170
I played devil's advocate sometimes too
much because I want to see what your

839
00:48:50,171 --> 00:48:54,990
arguments are to the contrary. I want
to see what the thought processes I,

840
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,210
every time I've had a
fight with someone they,

841
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:03,270
and we leave and we're not agreeing
they're wrong and the one they don't have,

842
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,920
they have less information.

843
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:09,970
And it's happened to me once David
Cross tonight we were doing coke and we

844
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:13,750
argued for eight hours of just
out David Cross as a coke user.

845
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,580
He didn't coke in the White House. I
think he outdid it. Really explains a lot.

846
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:22,150
That explains his letter to the cable guy.
A open letter to Larry the cable guy.

847
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,150
Oh yeah, yeah. The desk of he, I
don't think it has coke anymore.

848
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:25,990
He's old and married.

849
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,590
But this was a long time ago and I was
talking about free lunch programs and I

850
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:34,060
go, it's fucking stupid. You don't,
lunch is a ham sandwich. The,

851
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:37,750
I did the math and it's like
a buck 80 right? I go, bums,

852
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:40,930
get 10 bucks a day to do vodka.
You can't.

853
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,350
You had a kid and you can't
scrape together a dollar
80 for ham sandwich because

854
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:48,520
the liquid is just the waterfowl. But
it's not the kid's fault. I understand.

855
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:53,521
But this state can't be supplying people
that dollar 80 sandwich that we have to

856
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:57,130
have some in supply kids with a little
bit of food at dollar eighties where the

857
00:49:57,131 --> 00:49:59,260
food, you use the argument
in the opposite way too.

858
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,440
If the state can't come up with a
dollar 80 for a kid for a sandwich,

859
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:07,450
then the state's fucked up. No, I'm
saying it's as crazy as the state going.

860
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,900
We're going to come in and brush your
teeth like we have to give you some basic

861
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:12,550
things that you're expected to do.

862
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:17,550
That's like helping kids go poopoo a
dollar 80 the mom that doesn't cost some

863
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,290
money to brush your teeth doesn't
cost money to wash your hands.

864
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:25,240
It costs money to feed a kid, but that's
where you draw the line with kids.

865
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:27,860
I can't fucking support themselves.
They're little kids. They don't have jobs.

866
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,690
So if a kid is hungry,
like,

867
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:33,010
and it all costs a dollar 80 to
make a fight I had with dentist,

868
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:37,610
it's not a bad fight because I just, I
feel like, look, I was a kid. I was poor.

869
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,750
You know, we were on welfare and we drank
powdered milk and the whole deal and,

870
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:44,450
and you know, I was hungry.
I remember being hungry.

871
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,630
I didn't fucking rare
in 2015 a kid may be,

872
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,000
this is in the 70s and I know the way
it works in school, even my own kids,

873
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,640
they'd go, do you want lunch or do
you want the school lunch today?

874
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,090
It just became a thing that was expected
and the state has to go at some point.

875
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,480
All right, we've got to draw the
line here. Uh, no. Kids are like,

876
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,070
have hunger pains cause their mommy.
You don't have to be a fucking crack head.

877
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,930
Well there's a lot of people like
crack heads that have kids. Oh, okay,

878
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:11,720
well then that's a bigger fish to fry.

879
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:13,970
Now we have to deal with
Chris kids having kids,

880
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:16,460
a lot of people that are irresponsible
that have children and I don't,

881
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:19,770
I think if you're going to have a state
school or a state sponsored school,

882
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,290
State's going to pay for everything.
Think about all the shit that's the,

883
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,640
what does that do that for dinner
that night? I don't know nothing,

884
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:27,470
but while you're in school,
while the kids in school,

885
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,010
you are responsible for that kid for
whatever, eight, seven, eight hours,

886
00:51:31,011 --> 00:51:34,580
whatever it is. That kid goes to
school, this mother is so useless,

887
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:39,350
she can't scrape together a ham sandwich
and now we let the kid go at three 20

888
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,870
[inaudible] decides to take this kid away.

889
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:45,980
You could argue the semantics
about competent. She can't fuck,

890
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:50,360
we have to take that kid away. That's
what I was saying. If your kid,

891
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,600
if you can't supply a ham sandwich or
your kid, I have to take your kid away.

892
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,530
Well at a certain level you got to figure
out like when is someone completely

893
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,360
incompetent, right? It's this a scale.

894
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,080
It's a dollar 80 a day
for lunch and using comp.

895
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:06,440
I don't think there's anything wrong with
supplying kids with food at school for

896
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:09,980
free. And I think that if
you, if you look at what,

897
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,690
what needs society should cover,
like which, which is society cover,

898
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,420
should they cover the police?
Should the police be private?

899
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,640
Should they cover the fire department?
Should that be private?

900
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:22,970
I mean there's a bunch of arguments for
what your taxes should and should not

901
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:23,690
pay for.

902
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,950
I don't think it's unreasonable if 80%
of public spirals into public schools,

903
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,200
I don't think it's unreasonable to say
that you should provide the kids with

904
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:30,711
food.
No,

905
00:52:30,711 --> 00:52:33,380
it's not unreasonable to say you should
provide kids who shit their pants with

906
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:36,920
underwear. But if a kid is shitting
his pants, we have an issue here.

907
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,640
So if a mother can't afford lunch,
sorry, the kids are anyway. Okay.

908
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:46,250
We have the same thing. But that
was the only time that David and I,

909
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,020
we both had a 100% of the facts and
after eight hours and probably a gram of

910
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:54,110
coke, we were like,
let's agree to disagree.

911
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,380
That's the only time you ever
agree with the time of my life.

912
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:01,310
Everyone had all the facts and we
still disagreed at the end. Otherwise,

913
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:05,180
disagreements are someone who
doesn't understand what's happening.

914
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:09,830
And Mark Marin was just saying, oh,
they need, uh, there's not one thing.

915
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:11,330
It's systemic. And it was, you know,

916
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:16,420
he personifies this sort of fake Beta
male comedian with the Cardigan and the,

917
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:20,480
Oh, I'm such a mess. I'm so
fucked up. Uh, and these guys,

918
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:24,440
fuck 20 year old girls while complaining
and scratching their heads going,

919
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:26,940
I am a mess.
And I was like,

920
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:32,210
this year we have this narrative of
the jock with the Letterman shirt,

921
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,880
right?
The UVA frat boy date raping chicks.

922
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:41,330
I'm going through my own Rolodex and I
see those guys cleaning up a drunk chicks

923
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:45,720
BARF.
And I see the Beta male comedians,

924
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,700
fucking chicks fucking passed out.
Chicks what?

925
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:53,880
Beta male comedians are fucking
passed out. Checks all of them.

926
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,270
And you know what comedians do like Gonzo
journalist thing here you're like half

927
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:03,600
serious, half reality, partially fiction.

928
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:08,220
And it makes your argument's very
difficult to go three your own history and

929
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:11,520
think of every time you know of a
guy who fucked up passed out chick,

930
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:16,110
I don't know. And he's not a jock. He's
like, he runs it. He does it. Indeed.

931
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,280
A fucking show. If I know a guy
who fucked the passed out chick,

932
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:23,430
he didn't tell me about it. I don't know
anybody that fucked up passed out shark.

933
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,260
Well it's usually contentious. Like the
guy I'm thinking of, she was sorta like,

934
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:31,290
I don't remember fucking him and
I'm never speaking to him again.

935
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:35,190
But it was kind of wishy
washy and he's not like,

936
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:38,640
I know these super handsome dude.
She's two guys.

937
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,360
One of them used to be a male model and
this chicken invited them over and she

938
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:43,720
was,
she got two ways.

939
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,360
So I think she wanted to get gangbanged
and she fucking drank a bunch of oxy was

940
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:50,310
showing them her pussy at this
point of the story. By the way,

941
00:54:50,311 --> 00:54:51,660
I was mad at him for not fucking her,

942
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:55,920
but then she started projectile
vomiting cause she over did it right.

943
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,820
And I've heard this story a few times,
especially with threesomes.

944
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,120
Girls get nervous and they overdrink.

945
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,810
And what are these
disgusting Frat boy jocks do?

946
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,940
They washed your sheets,

947
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,330
they've put the towels in
the fucking washing machine

948
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:14,370
and they made sure she was okay. And then
they went home. These Beta male guys,

949
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:15,960
like the kind of guys
who are on the Nerdist.

950
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,290
These guys who have one thinks is cool.
Uh,

951
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,940
I see those guys fucking her skull
fucking her or beating off in front of him

952
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:26,850
and Tom Solusa this to me once he goes,
he goes,

953
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:30,120
jerking off in front of a
woman is obviously pretty rare,

954
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:34,370
but it's not that rare in
the comedy world. Well the,

955
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,550
I do know a few comics who have done
some inappropriate jerk him off. Yeah.

956
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,180
They're mentally ill
narcissists for the most point.

957
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:45,960
And they were this wolf in sheep's
clothing of I'm a Beta male, I'm a loser,

958
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:46,440
I'm a nut.

959
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,440
And they just use it to fuck chicks over
and dump broads and they're the jocks.

960
00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:54,420
They're the date raping jocks
that everyone's scared of.

961
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:59,340
Well you're talking about like very
specific guys that are famous and wealthy

962
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:04,220
and also are playing that role
of being the failure. Yeah.

963
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,140
I'm talking about young
community like Jay more,

964
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,380
but there's two types of comedians.

965
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:11,190
There's Jay Moore with a dress shirt
and a blazer. That's that generation.

966
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,380
I don't know those guys.
They seem like pretty good guys.

967
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,700
Then there's the American apparel
sweatshirt dudes like the millennial up to

968
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,060
maybe 35 those are the guys
I'm talking about. Okay.

969
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:23,130
Aren't you doing exactly the same thing?

970
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,250
Is someone saying that black guys are
great at science cause one guy knows a guy

971
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:30,100
who does something this
year? Theory. First of all,

972
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,950
I'm basing it on a lot of guys. What guys?
Well, well you would have to name names,

973
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:39,280
but I don't know anybody who's
doing what you're saying.

974
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:43,120
I don't know anybody's skull fucking
passed out. Girls other than bill Cosby.

975
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:43,661
Okay.

976
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:48,661
How many young comedians you know sold
as food data girl at say 26 right?

977
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,833
A lot.

978
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:54,870
Then they dumped her at 29 her
ovaries are dried up 29 yeah.

979
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,650
I don't think they dropped that young.
Yeah, they do know you can have kids.

980
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,260
Here's your ovaries for the most part,
right?

981
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:07,320
This is your brain on drugs at 30 the
hourglass turns upside down and the sand

982
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:11,940
is draining from 30 to 35 snow, sand
and over five you're fucked. It does.

983
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:15,340
The pelican. Bring your
babies as well, Joe.

984
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:20,780
That fertility is draining from 30 to
35 my wife had our first kid at 36 or

985
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:27,880
something. They will go through
a door that said geriatric
mothers. Oh, it's over.

986
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:31,660
Well there's, that's in Canada. Double
evidence. They die. Young candidate. No,

987
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:34,710
I murdered in New York since
the polar bears since 99 no,

988
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,430
it of course there's exceptions.

989
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:41,380
My mother had my brother at 41 but
generally throughout your brother's soft.

990
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,010
We joke about his week sperm,
but uh, I mean we say he was,

991
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:46,630
he's bred with the old ovaries.

992
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:50,830
But I realized my youngest
son was born much with a mom,

993
00:57:50,831 --> 00:57:53,080
much older than my mom.
So we don't do that joke anyway.

994
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,590
But even with my youngest son, I was
watching him like a hawk at the beginning,

995
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:59,920
worried about a autism.
So anyway,

996
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,190
if you date a chick at
26 and you dump it 30,

997
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:05,170
she's going to take her a couple
of years to get over it. Right.

998
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,340
To the point where she's
ready to have kids. No, nope.

999
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:11,470
I mean get over it like
the new guy and marry him.

1000
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:16,120
And maybe be ready for kids. Who
knows? Man, I know a girl who,

1001
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,360
whatever anecdotal evidence,
go ahead.

1002
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,480
If you kill a woman's ovaries like that,
you are not killing it,

1003
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:26,730
but he's ovaries. Yeah,
you're taking her back.

1004
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,720
There should be some stigma around that.

1005
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,130
That's Hitler because she waved her best.
Those kids would have had kids,

1006
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:37,630
those kids.
So if you did during a time in her life,

1007
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,170
30 you have killed a million people.
You have committed a war crime.

1008
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:45,190
You're Hitler. It's very hard to take your
argument. Seriously. You're a funny guy.

1009
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,670
Which part is bullshit? All that.
It would kill your Hitler. You, you,

1010
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,010
you killed her ovaries.
All the, all the above.

1011
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,130
You have denied the world
millions of people. No.

1012
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,750
No you haven't because a woman can't
give birth to millions of people.

1013
00:58:58,751 --> 00:59:02,620
That's fuck no, but her grandkids,
grandkids, grandkids. Did you sleep?

1014
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:06,490
You could be making billions of dollars.
Million. Look at Attila the Hun.

1015
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,780
I think he's responsible for
like 3 million people. Oh,

1016
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:15,190
like physically. Yeah. No, no. Yeah.
He didn't fuck 3 million girls. No,

1017
00:59:15,191 --> 00:59:17,500
he fucked a bunch of, he probably
fucked you. Don't have enough hours.

1018
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:19,270
You don't have enough time to come.

1019
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,190
I'm talking about kids and grandkids
and we were talking bullshit.

1020
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,070
That's what you're doing. We're both
talking bullshit. No, we're not. Look up.

1021
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:28,500
Come on. I'm not going. Are you a
nerd? Look up how many children,

1022
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,370
how many children came from
until the hunt? Quite a few.

1023
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:32,540
Not as many as Genghis Khan.

1024
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:36,740
Genghis Khan's responsible for some like
one out of 500 dudes in Asia or some

1025
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:38,870
crazy number. Okay, so
that's what I'm saying.

1026
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,830
How many in year seven you take
up a woman's fertile years.

1027
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:47,810
You've done the opposite
of a team or hiking up her
years, her years or going on.

1028
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:49,310
They're going on.
You happened to be,

1029
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:54,311
she found her title after that 32 it's
very hard to have cold round her during

1030
00:59:55,431 --> 01:00:00,140
the time where she's 26 to 29 it doesn't
mean you're responsible for her any

1031
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:02,990
more than she's responsible.
You shouldn't be conscious.

1032
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,500
Both she and you should be
conscious of this is our prime time.

1033
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:08,600
It's like football players.
Okay. I think women are,

1034
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,130
that's why they get like super serious
all those times amongst my sort of media

1035
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:15,710
hipster kind of entertainment people,

1036
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:20,090
that whole concept is gone and one
generation ago it was, you know,

1037
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:23,000
you got to get her while she's young and
this is her big year and blah blah blah.

1038
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,230
There was some uh,
value on those formative over years.

1039
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,000
Today it's nothing.
And these women,

1040
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:33,500
they get dumped at 30 and then the
women get dumped at 30 a lot of them get

1041
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:38,060
married, but I know in New York got
dumped at 30 wow. That's super anecdotal.

1042
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:41,270
But I think a lot of my friends, when
they talk about women, they talk,

1043
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:46,010
if they date girls that are like up to
25 26 they're more like, they don't care.

1044
01:00:46,011 --> 01:00:47,060
They're having fun.

1045
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:50,150
They're there doing their thing with their
career and they're doing their thing,

1046
01:00:50,151 --> 01:00:51,260
going on dates and stuff.

1047
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:55,520
But they always say that when they get
to be around 30 31 32 they're like,

1048
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,260
where's this going?
That's lanes is heading.

1049
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,220
They should be saying that at 27 is
all I'm saying in your world. No.

1050
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:05,570
In a world that doc and doc,
I had some chick,

1051
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:10,370
a friend of mine, 39 her,
her, her physician said, Ooh,

1052
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:14,660
35, uh, getting kind of late.
And she said it to me like,

1053
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:18,980
can you believe that sexist pig? And
they go, he's a nerd. He has Asperger's.

1054
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:23,000
He doesn't have, he's not sexist. He's
telling you about your fucking vagina.

1055
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:24,650
Is that a sexist pig to say?

1056
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:30,230
Because today if you're 30 that's what
I'm trying to say today in 2015 to speak

1057
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,700
normal biological facts, I
called them hate. Fax is sexist.

1058
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:38,990
It's sexist to say that it's hard to
have kids after 30 and nearly impossible

1059
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:39,830
after 35.
Well,

1060
01:01:39,831 --> 01:01:43,440
I don't know what this has to do with
comedians that are fake Beta male skull

1061
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,320
fucks.
Comedians don't recognize that.

1062
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,160
You're not responsible for that any
more than they're responsible for

1063
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:53,390
recognizing that you're a 45 year old
guy who's going through some midlife

1064
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:57,020
crisis, some existential angst.
This goes back to what I'm saying,

1065
01:01:57,021 --> 01:02:00,980
but no one's responsible for, you know,
control the relationship. And if you,

1066
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,230
a lot of these guys will
fuck over this girl.

1067
01:02:03,231 --> 01:02:05,720
And sort of imply that he's
going to put a ring on it.

1068
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,110
And then 29 30 I mean,

1069
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:12,410
New York has a very disproportionate
number of total though.

1070
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:16,160
You're saying a lot of these guys fuck
over. Like relationships don't work out.

1071
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:19,070
A lot of times people pretend to be one
thing when you first start dating him,

1072
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,130
like you were saying,
your wife

1073
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,260
was saying, you know, I might
be a lesbian. And then as
you get deeper than you, oh,

1074
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,160
that was just like a shiny little spinner
and behind it was a hook. You know?

1075
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,560
That's how you catch trout to Troy.
So you're, you're, you're, you're,

1076
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:31,950
you could play it on both sides.

1077
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:34,230
People are full of Shit and
they're full of shit to themselves.

1078
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,100
People pretend to themselves that they
are this one type of person because that

1079
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:40,110
person appears to be more attractive.

1080
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,140
So when you're talking about these hipster
guys that are pretending to be these

1081
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:47,340
Beta males that are super sensitive
and male feminists, they in their mind,

1082
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:51,180
they have convinced themselves that they
are this thing because this thing would

1083
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:53,970
be more attractive to the type of
women they're trying to attract.

1084
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,670
So they're very just as confused.
I agree.

1085
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,680
They're not like this fucking
master miles self sabotage.

1086
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:04,170
This mastermind is trying to engineer
this false narratives a trap.

1087
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,980
What's negligence when you're just young,
they're living their life now.

1088
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:10,600
They're like 35 they're
fucking a 26 year old.

1089
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:14,970
Then they dry up her ovaries and
they dumper. Oh, okay, let's,

1090
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:17,320
I'm talking about too many different
things at once here, right?

1091
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,590
We want to establish,

1092
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:23,130
I want to establish that 100 from 25 to
30 should start getting serious and they

1093
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:26,070
have a certain currency because
their ovaries, two or none.

1094
01:03:26,071 --> 01:03:30,510
There's a venn diagram here where they
overlap where if they don't want fucking

1095
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:33,920
95% of the population wants kids.
I don't know about that and what,

1096
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:38,220
I don't want kids, a lot of girls
who don't learn, they are extinct.

1097
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:42,340
We've been over a quarter of a
million years. They just want to talk.

1098
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:46,770
Need to one kid like the kid is this
substitute that Doug is a subsidies and

1099
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:47,820
they called themselves mommy.

1100
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:50,330
But when you get on the four oh
five three o'clock in the afternoon,

1101
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,810
he can't fucking move cause there's,

1102
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,410
there's no room because all the cars
have blocked up all the road and you go,

1103
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,740
maybe we need more girls with little dogs.
Maybe we need more gay guys.

1104
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:04,170
I want to get married. Yeah. Well maybe
these people who aren't having kids is,

1105
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:09,060
is a self selection and you know where
you're going to have annoying feminists.

1106
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,030
They're good. My kid isn't going to
have to deal with them. Why is that?

1107
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,270
Because they're going to die off. Yeah,
they're dying off right now. I wonder.

1108
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,680
Jessebelle won't be around in one
generation. A lot. Doesn't have had kids.

1109
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:24,780
They don't have kids. No one had,
Jessica has kids. Maybe one or two.

1110
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:29,400
It's like fracking. Well no
really? And I actually know,

1111
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:32,340
I used to be friends with the chicken
decibel and she told me that that's not

1112
01:04:32,341 --> 01:04:36,300
true. Really? Who, which
one? Tracy Egan. Okay. Uh,

1113
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,460
she's a writer. Yeah, she's advice.
Now she told me that, uh, that,

1114
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:42,930
that I'm spilling the beans here,
but I don't care.

1115
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,560
She told me that the managing editor
who looks kind of like Jimi Hendrix,

1116
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:49,040
but it's a woman, uh, she, uh,

1117
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,890
would cry herself to sleep
at night because she waited
too long and her ovaries

1118
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:56,040
dried up. And, uh, I feel
like screaming at her,

1119
01:04:56,370 --> 01:05:01,350
your whole agenda is telling women that
they're men and they don't need kids and

1120
01:05:01,351 --> 01:05:04,530
they'll be fine without kids. And you
don't even believe that fucking shit.

1121
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:06,540
But is that their agenda?
Because I don't think it is.

1122
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:10,560
I think their agenda is saying that
women can be empowered and women can not

1123
01:05:10,561 --> 01:05:15,561
have to live under the
predetermined directives that
men have set forth them and

1124
01:05:17,561 --> 01:05:18,010
they can do their

1125
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,680
own shit.
That's was the beginning of the impetus.

1126
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:24,550
The pendulum has swung so far
and now it's, if you do that,

1127
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:28,480
you're a sellout and a loser and
you're a fucking Stepford wife. Why?

1128
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:32,590
So if you have a relationship and you
have a family and modern feminism,

1129
01:05:32,591 --> 01:05:35,410
vilifies the Midwestern housewife.
Calm.

1130
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:39,820
Our wives are losers according to
Jessebelle Willie. I've never heard that.

1131
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:43,270
I've never seen that written down. So you
see implied when you read the articles,

1132
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:45,010
it's like she's bad ass.

1133
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:49,450
She's kick ass like celebrating
empowered women there.

1134
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:53,020
Celebrate. Do you believe that? I think
in some ways that's what they want.

1135
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:54,850
They want to celebrate empowered women.

1136
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,880
Kick ass too is a movie that sums up
modern feminism and it is women or men.

1137
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:06,520
Women kick ass.
Women are marines like modern feminism is.

1138
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,010
Why aren't there more female superheroes?
I don't know.

1139
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:12,910
Cause it's not a feminine thing to fly
to a bank robber and punch him in the

1140
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:16,220
face. And I actually have a
theory about this. I said,

1141
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:17,760
but men and [inaudible] funny,

1142
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:21,790
I've never heard anybody saying that
they want more female superheroes. Oh,

1143
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:24,910
that's a big thing, isn't it? Yeah. Why
don't the, how come the women, feminists,

1144
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,600
the women, feminists,
they're the real feminists.

1145
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,450
I mean if there are real feminist,
it's only women, feminist men,

1146
01:06:31,451 --> 01:06:35,890
feminists are just, they are
extinct of Betas. Got You. Got It.

1147
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,120
You got all the same rights were done.
Humanists is really what we should all be.

1148
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,440
I don't think they have the same rights.

1149
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:43,780
You think to have exactly the same rights.
What rights do they have?

1150
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,180
What rights does do men have
that women don't have? Well,

1151
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:49,630
it's not a matter of rights.
It's a matter of rights for sure.

1152
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:54,130
Like as far as leaking any metric. And
men are worse off rights as far as like,

1153
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:58,090
but as far as like the way they're
appreciated and cultures and society,

1154
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,610
certainly now worldwide.
Oh No, no, no, no.

1155
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:04,810
I'm the only talking about North
America or the West fucking Middle East.

1156
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,540
All feminist should move to the
Middle East and get to work.

1157
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,830
Why don't feminist embrace
like Rhonda Rousey? She seems,

1158
01:07:09,831 --> 01:07:13,690
seems like the ultimate feminist. She's
like have like a feminist from a movie.

1159
01:07:13,691 --> 01:07:15,280
They don't embrace her.
No.

1160
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:18,700
Cause that's my beef with feminism
is that they're to Ronda Rousey.

1161
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,343
Well she is hot,

1162
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:25,530
she's hot and she kicks ass like
she literally is like two mater.

1163
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:29,800
When I see Leora craft,
I don't get a boner.

1164
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:33,760
I get a boner when a woman is feminism
like southern Belles make me hard.

1165
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:37,480
I learned some woman does a back flip
and shoots a monster in the face. I go,

1166
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:42,510
oh it's some dyke has short shorts on
and knows how to do backflips and I think

1167
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:46,690
nerds like it cause they want to see
action and they want to see pretty girls.

1168
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,890
So they'd to save time, they make a
tomb raider. Right. So it's like a,

1169
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:55,300
what's that thing when you take a Turkey
and you cook a duck in it? Yeah, exactly.

1170
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:59,470
Turducken I was watching the
movie support your local sheriff,

1171
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:03,730
you know that movies? No. What does that
really look with sheriff? It's like, uh,

1172
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:09,160
what's his name from uh, uh, James can no,

1173
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:13,210
James Caan. No support. Your local
sheriff. Okay. The Guy who was in Hawaii,

1174
01:08:13,211 --> 01:08:17,610
five o forever. Oh Jesus.
Well the fuck was that Nervo

1175
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:24,440
near, it's not an insult. Jamie's not
a nerd. I mean, he's apparently not,

1176
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:28,220
he can't look hindered the sense
that I'm a nerd, but, uh, all right.

1177
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:31,250
What is this where we look anyway
in the movie? Ah, there it is.

1178
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,960
And who's the main guy? What's his
name again? No, James Garner. Oh,

1179
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:37,640
James Caan. Anyway, in the movie,

1180
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:41,250
there's this scene where
they're in a courtroom and uh,

1181
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:45,680
they're having some trial and this
woman comes out and she's got on like a,

1182
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:50,230
you know, that's wild west dress and
the fucking hair up and little blouse,

1183
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:54,260
quite attractive. Anyway, she gets up
in the court and she goes, hey, Yo,

1184
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,460
listen to me and you'll listen.

1185
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:58,670
Well Patna I've had enough
of this and I want you.

1186
01:08:58,671 --> 01:09:01,220
And then they go border on the court
can sit her down. She said, no,

1187
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:05,360
I will not sit down. I demand that
you listen to me and I'm watching it.

1188
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:09,770
I just had this fucking epiphany wash
over me and I realize men invented this

1189
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:13,670
bitch. Like men invented
Jessebelle feminism, lyric craft,

1190
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,970
this whole thing,
because she's not being feminine.

1191
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:20,990
Like that movie was cast by a dude.
That movie was written by a dude.

1192
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:24,740
They're making her get up there.
And I think the suffragette movement,

1193
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:27,050
the whole like women
should vote was guys going,

1194
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,370
why don't you fucking say that you
should vote. And the ladies go, what?

1195
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:35,750
I was making a Lasagna. Now get up
there, say I need to vote, I'm a lady.

1196
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:38,930
And they go, okay, uh, I'm
a lady. Well, you know,

1197
01:09:38,931 --> 01:09:41,960
there is a biological reality for women
who have to take care of themselves.

1198
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:44,600
Women who work actually
develop more testosterone,

1199
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,210
women who are in the workforce
and we have to compete. Yeah.

1200
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:51,050
They actually develop more testosterone
and they become more aggressive like

1201
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:52,670
because of that testosterone.

1202
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:57,080
And I think that when women are
forced into that sort of a position,

1203
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,750
like is it,
is it a coincidence?

1204
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,600
Not saying that all
feminists are unattractive,

1205
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:06,380
but a lot of like really
vocal ones are unattractive.

1206
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:09,140
And so therefore they're forced
to take care of themselves.

1207
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:10,430
They're forced to be on their own.

1208
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,580
So they're forced to compete in
the workforce and you have to,

1209
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:14,630
in order to survive,

1210
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:17,930
you have to become more aggressive
and so be in becoming more aggressive.

1211
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:22,790
And then in standing up for themselves
and their own gender, they become like a,

1212
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:26,060
an antagonist or they become rather a,
an opponent of,

1213
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:29,360
of the men that they're competing with.
They don't belong there.

1214
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,840
They don't belong in the work environment.
Well that's whatever,

1215
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:36,350
the most part by themselves. Okay, so
you're your worker in Maggie Thatcher,

1216
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:41,180
you know this. Tons of Alpha females who
Oprah fucking rock Oprah. She's great.

1217
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,300
But my experience has been,
uh,

1218
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:47,000
when the woman contributes
to the workforce,

1219
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,510
I'm going to say 80% of the time it's just

1220
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:57,570
like, what does that mean? Okay, I'll give
it a rub in the forehead and goes, let's,

1221
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:02,540
let's ride this out until we can get
back to creating stuff. Like for example,

1222
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:03,800
when I ran an ad agency,

1223
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:08,780
we were doing a commercial for
converse and that bit was, um, uh,

1224
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:13,040
this guy's standing over here and then
this guy walks over and, and he says, hi.

1225
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:14,940
Then he leaves and he's
a hunk and she's a girl.

1226
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:17,490
And then later she talks to
her friends and goes, oh my
God, he talked to me, blah,

1227
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:22,320
blah, blah. So, okay, got it. We'll
do that. And then the woman goes,

1228
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,450
and then she comes up to
her friends and she's like,

1229
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:27,210
can you believe what happened?
Her friends, like, I can't
believe it. And I go,

1230
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:31,410
wait a minute, these are people.
And she goes, yeah, well, and I go,

1231
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:34,950
but I thought these were the people of
this world. And she was, well, who cares?

1232
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:36,650
It's just, and then, uh,

1233
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,560
she also said that putting weird
things with your hands here,

1234
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:42,120
for the people that are
just assigned to this,

1235
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:45,240
you're walking your fingers along the
table and I don't even know what the fuck

1236
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:47,340
you're doing. And I'm in the room
with him getting drunk actually,

1237
01:11:47,341 --> 01:11:52,260
but I go on another beer.
This is the world. Okay.

1238
01:11:52,261 --> 01:11:54,000
The people that pull their fingers,
right,

1239
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:58,080
can't just flip it and make some people
fingers and sometimes fingers or legs.

1240
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:01,320
I didn't know this was going
to be taking an audio wise.

1241
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:04,770
Let me give you a better example.
Um, my s my brother Andy percent,

1242
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,820
my brother designs
video games. Uh, and uh,

1243
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:12,870
he said when we do a thing with men,
they'll go, oh, okay. It's a squirrel.

1244
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:15,840
He's on a skateboard.
[inaudible] an APP, right, right.

1245
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:19,590
And he gets a bunch of nuts and then you
win a prize. Got It. And here we made it.

1246
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,030
Okay, it looks good, but he goes, well,

1247
01:12:21,031 --> 01:12:25,560
if I do something like that for a female
client, so they'll go, we had a thought,

1248
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:29,400
uh, what about changing the color scheme
from sort of autumn to more of a summary

1249
01:12:29,401 --> 01:12:32,790
thing? And he'll go, okay,
well that's not a button.

1250
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:35,190
We'll have to go back
and change all the code.

1251
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:39,420
So it's essentially making a whole new
video game from scratch. Okay, fine.

1252
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:44,130
And then he'll go, but we'll have
to bill you the same amount again.

1253
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:47,940
And then he goes, they kind of get
indignant, like they go, well, fine,

1254
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,300
like you're not going to question
me. What? Cause I'm a woman,

1255
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,580
I'm going to have a problem with
that. And then they go, okay,

1256
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:56,820
so my brother will have to Redo the
video game in a different color.

1257
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,060
Whereas men would go, oh, it's a whole
other thing. All right, fuck it. Yeah.

1258
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:05,490
That's not some men. Right.
Again, this is anecdotal.

1259
01:13:05,491 --> 01:13:08,580
I'm talking about my personal experience,
but so much like just the other day,

1260
01:13:08,581 --> 01:13:09,300
this woman,

1261
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,000
I have a meeting on Wednesday and this
woman set it up and I've talked to this

1262
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:15,890
other woman and this other woman, I
know this is sexist, but I go, well,

1263
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,840
I have a thing at two. And
she goes, okay, I'll just move
it. And I go, no, no, no, no,

1264
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:23,340
no. This is an important meeting. I don't
want these women to think I'm a flake,

1265
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:28,500
so don't change it. Uh, that makes
me look like I'm hard to work with.

1266
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:33,510
And she goes, oh, okay. Uh, I
was going to move it around.
I go, this meeting is huge.

1267
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,810
Don't be fucking with the Times.
And I'm just like,

1268
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,600
why am I dealing with these chicks when
it could be dealing with a dude who

1269
01:13:39,601 --> 01:13:41,820
would just go, okay, well the
meetings only going to be an hour,

1270
01:13:41,821 --> 01:13:46,170
so I think he'll make it fun.
Okay. Handshake. Well isn't it?

1271
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:48,270
Don't you think there's some
women that can handle that?

1272
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:51,110
It sounds like it's an incompetent person.
You could run it.

1273
01:13:51,111 --> 01:13:55,530
An incompetent dude too. Speaking
generally, right about millions, right?

1274
01:13:56,730 --> 01:14:01,680
Women are good at micro
management. They're good at
a line producing for example.

1275
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,240
They're great at that. Uh, as far as
big decisions and handshake deals,

1276
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,880
men are,
tend to be much better at it.

1277
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:13,940
And my entire career has been
almost exclusively women.

1278
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:18,850
Why is that? Because I'm selling
shit. So when I ran the magazine,

1279
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,750
the marketing people, marketing people
tend to be women. The ones buying the ads,

1280
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:26,980
they're woman advertising. The ones who
aren't, you know, bequeathing the budgets,

1281
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:30,370
the ones who come to the set. Women,
women, women. Buckwheat is a great word.

1282
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,583
I don't,

1283
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:37,600
I don't know how we got from Beta
comedian skull fucking passed out girls to

1284
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:41,500
this. But I'm trying and,
and men are different. Uh,

1285
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:42,700
that's the big picture.

1286
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,440
And feminism is something that's created
by men as a false narrative that women

1287
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,060
have bought it, Hook, line and sinker,

1288
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,880
where there really should be
at home protecting those very,

1289
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:56,970
very valuable three years from 26 to 29
before their ovaries turned to Sam or

1290
01:14:57,821 --> 01:14:58,654
something like that.

1291
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:02,350
That you're being sarcastic because
I'm listening to you going, yes.

1292
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,340
Well done.
That is exactly what I still,

1293
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:09,460
I'm trying to figure out what went wrong
with you and mark Marin that you became

1294
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:11,980
transphobic or he transphobic
after the inner, no,

1295
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:15,450
I wrote an article called Transphobia
is perfectly natural and it shut,

1296
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,230
shit hit the fan. I read
that and I also saw the, uh,

1297
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:25,150
the video that you put up about these
people regretting their transition. Right.

1298
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:28,480
You know, there's, there's definitely,
there can be that, right? I mean,

1299
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:31,390
that goes back to what we're saying,
what gay marriage and the surface,

1300
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:34,510
it's just leave and be there. They
want to get married and I go, no,

1301
01:15:34,511 --> 01:15:38,380
actually people are getting fined for
not having a gay marriage in their living

1302
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:41,690
room. So it's not as simple as just leave
them be you're actually antagonizing

1303
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:45,420
Christian, but no, no, no.
That's just one. And you were
talking about the outliers.

1304
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:48,520
The ones in nipple,
the five have to bake the wedding cake.

1305
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:51,130
You know that whole story about the pizza,
like in the wedding cake,

1306
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:54,710
like they sought out someone who would
say no, exactly. It's fake. Right.

1307
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:59,400
That's my whole beef. What is
faith? It was a store, the Ra's,

1308
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:00,940
but they would try to create a story.

1309
01:16:00,941 --> 01:16:03,730
You want the right to go
camping and you go, ah, okay.

1310
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:05,410
But I've never seen you camp before.

1311
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:11,320
But they don't not have the right to
go camp camp blacks camping, right.

1312
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:14,830
Scam. And you go, hey, no one's
suing black people for camping.

1313
01:16:14,831 --> 01:16:16,750
Like this is a non black camping ground.

1314
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,730
But if they heard about a campground
getting suit, oh wait a minute,

1315
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:22,240
I didn't know it was camp ground
did kick black people out. Yeah,

1316
01:16:22,241 --> 01:16:25,810
that would be shut down. Fucking fucked
up. My point is be gay marriages.

1317
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:29,450
They don't really want to
get married and uh, uh,

1318
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:32,140
but they do have a gay couple and
lives down the street from me.

1319
01:16:32,141 --> 01:16:33,970
They're good friends of mine.
The thing with trans,

1320
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:39,050
a kid with the Trans was
when you normalize it and
say it's perfectly healthy,

1321
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:44,290
right? Then your eight year old
son who's gay by the way, uh,

1322
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:48,010
says I'm a woman. You Go, we're
going to just ride this out.

1323
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,260
And when you become 18,
you're gonna move to the West village.

1324
01:16:50,261 --> 01:16:53,140
And we were red leather shorts, shorts
and suck a bunch of Dicks and realize, oh,

1325
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:58,080
I'm a fag. I met a woman. But
now that we've normalized trends,

1326
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:01,150
what we, what these moms are doing,
cause they love having a trans kid,

1327
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:04,900
it's like a status symbol. Now what?
Mom's love having a trans kid. Yeah.

1328
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,320
You want to talk about outliers?
Like that's the real outlier.

1329
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:11,730
Not even the people getting sued
for marriage. The moms are a soup.

1330
01:17:11,731 --> 01:17:16,520
It's a status symbol now. Yeah. What,
where are you hanging out? Look it up.

1331
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:17,503
Anyway,

1332
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:22,400
so these trans moms are giving
their kids hormones, right.

1333
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:25,730
To Delay Hubert [inaudible].
I did see a video hormone,

1334
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:30,460
really young kid that was getting
their first hormone dose. Yes.

1335
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:34,820
I was like, wow. It actually
the story, because he's a chick,

1336
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,250
but when I'm talking
with slightly different,

1337
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:38,330
they're giving them hormone blockers.

1338
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:43,040
So puberty won't be disturbing because
see you of pubes and your Dick won't get

1339
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,870
bigger or whatever happened.
Yeah.

1340
01:17:44,871 --> 01:17:48,410
So kids are getting hormone blockers
cause we've accepted this as fact that

1341
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:53,110
trans is normal. And then
we're also normalizing, uh,

1342
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:57,440
the operation and their suicide rate.
It's brutal. Now I'm not denying,

1343
01:17:57,441 --> 01:18:01,590
there are a few dudes who
are happier with the con,

1344
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:06,360
like Zoey Tur, who's that? I've talked
to him a few times. He's got a con.

1345
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:11,150
He used to be a, he used to be a, a
helicopter news guy. He's the guy who,

1346
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:16,220
who saw o j and the Bronco.
He shot that [inaudible] and he,

1347
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,180
she created a vagina and she
seems to be happier about it,

1348
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:24,230
but she's pretty conservative and
doesn't think that operations should be

1349
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:26,870
normalized because it's fucking
weird. You know, it's adorable.

1350
01:18:26,871 --> 01:18:30,160
Is that Caitlyn Jenner doesn't
believe in gay marriage. Yeah,

1351
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:34,680
well that's common with trans. They
tend to be conservative. Really? I,

1352
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:39,110
because I think they have this
mental that is very traditional.

1353
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:42,620
Like Caitlyn Jenner didn't turn into a
bull dyke and didn't wear a sweatshirt

1354
01:18:42,621 --> 01:18:46,100
with a nose ring.
She turned into like a 1950s lady.

1355
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:50,390
So she has this very traditional
with a very rigid famine. Yeah.

1356
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,440
Like it doesn't move very well. Not very
pliable. Cut your cock off by the way,

1357
01:18:54,441 --> 01:18:57,860
Bruce. No, he's got to keep
it. Well then he's a poser.

1358
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:03,050
He is opposer but doesn't Bailey
Jay still have his dick, her deck.

1359
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:07,130
Hey, can you say her dick? How can you say
her? That's the problem with this mess.

1360
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:11,870
It come with these new terms. They
like that. Hi Bailey. It is a mess.

1361
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:16,670
Bailey won't speak to me anymore cause
I call him. He really, and I'm like,

1362
01:19:16,671 --> 01:19:21,110
so you're a woman? And he goes, well, I'm
not a woman, but I'm not a heat. I'm like,

1363
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:25,490
fuck. Oh Wow. Take a night course
to talk to you. You fucking people.

1364
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,760
Have you seen Harvard's new
rules on Z and thigh and they,

1365
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:35,840
they're enough. Fuck New Pronoun.
So Ze walks into the bar,

1366
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:38,960
slam the dude's face and you're like,
was it a chick or a dude?

1367
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,720
Like I want to know the race. I want to
know how tall and here, right? H E r h.

1368
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:49,570
E. R. Right? Isn't that
one of them? There's like a
bunch of them x. He was like,

1369
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:53,600
they're just making shit up. See, this
is the key to political correctness.

1370
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:58,190
It's not about justice.
It's about me telling you how to speak.

1371
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:02,240
It's about the upper classes
telling the lower classes. Oh,

1372
01:20:02,241 --> 01:20:05,360
you don't say a black anymore.
You're saying a person of color.

1373
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:08,010
It's also about calling out.
It's

1374
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,750
calling people out on
their transgressions,

1375
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:12,780
calling people out on using
the wrong gender Pronoun,

1376
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,670
calling people out on being insensitive.

1377
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:18,390
It's like looking for greenlights
so they could say that you're wrong.

1378
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,130
It's looking for the moral high ground.

1379
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,710
That's a real issue with
it because it's a game.

1380
01:20:22,711 --> 01:20:25,770
It's a social brownie
point collecting game.

1381
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:29,070
Like you want to be the most progressive
person and you want to be the person

1382
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:32,580
that is the most aggressive
about calling out other people.

1383
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,820
It used to be the promotional website,
open minded.

1384
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:41,310
Progressive was like about being like
sensitive and loving and trying to be

1385
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:42,930
accepting of all people.

1386
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:47,690
Now it's become about finding people who
aren't progressive and calling them out

1387
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,800
on an outing them and
shitting on their life.

1388
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:53,580
I think it's people that just get a green
light to be a cunt and one of the cuts.

1389
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:54,090
Yeah,

1390
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:59,090
the best greenlight is finding people
that you think have violated someone

1391
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:03,330
else's civil liberties or
civil rights or or you know,

1392
01:21:03,331 --> 01:21:06,840
sensitivities and you just
aggressively go after them.

1393
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:10,860
It's fascinating how they act when an
old person like a war vet says Negro,

1394
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,570
they have this sort of giggling like
Negro that's so old,

1395
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:18,780
that's like four names ago.
They're not up to date with the names.

1396
01:21:18,781 --> 01:21:21,360
We've been telling them and they go negro.
Then it's black.

1397
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:23,280
Then it's African American.
Now it's person of color.

1398
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:27,060
Has the United Negro College Fund still.
How do you have NAACP still?

1399
01:21:27,061 --> 01:21:31,270
How do you have real
association for Advancement of
Colored People? They go like,

1400
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:32,760
like I was on Fox wants in.

1401
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:37,761
This woman said that Hillary said a
colored person and what Hillary actually

1402
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:41,610
said was person of color and she was
mortified, uh, in the green room going,

1403
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:43,590
oh my God. I said, colored person.

1404
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:46,470
I meant to say that Hillary said person
of color. Well that's what should I do?

1405
01:21:46,471 --> 01:21:46,771
I'm like,

1406
01:21:46,771 --> 01:21:49,440
why don't you apologize to them right
now because there's some black guy sound

1407
01:21:49,441 --> 01:21:52,650
guy over there. I'm like, go apologize
to him. Maybe he'll forgive you. Well,

1408
01:21:52,651 --> 01:21:55,080
isn't it hilarious though? Think
about what you just said. I mean,

1409
01:21:55,081 --> 01:21:57,960
if you didn't know this language
and if you didn't know human beings,

1410
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:03,230
how ridiculous is it that it's okay to
say a person of color but is not okay to

1411
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:08,370
say colored person that is the same
crew fucking this is all bullshit.

1412
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:13,080
I agree with you on that. Like at my
boxing gym, all the black dudes are,

1413
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:16,080
and the Puerto Ricans and the Hispanics,
there are really good thing.

1414
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,260
There are all the white
people get brain damage.

1415
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:22,990
They're all riffing on each
other's ethnicity, like, well yeah,

1416
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,680
you're Puerto Rican. What
would you know? Go on welfare.

1417
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:29,370
It's a fun way to ref and it was the
way it was a generation to go with the

1418
01:22:29,371 --> 01:22:33,930
Archie bunker's on the doshas is fucking
Polack and I believe that we were

1419
01:22:33,931 --> 01:22:38,910
closer when we could make jokes
like that and relax and be like, oh,

1420
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:43,110
it was on island time. Look at the black
eye when I discipline New York. Disagree.

1421
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:45,600
I disagree with that because
I don't think we're not,

1422
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,750
I think we are closer now than we've
ever been before, but I think these,

1423
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,670
these issues that we're dealing with,

1424
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:55,560
these are like transitionary issues and
I think that as people become more and

1425
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:56,640
more aware of each other,

1426
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,850
those will start to erode and
be outed as being preposterous.

1427
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:03,270
And I think these kinds of conversations
where we're mocking this like national,

1428
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:06,070
like the the colored people
or a person of color,

1429
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,700
these conversations are important and
I think ultimately people will come to

1430
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:11,530
their senses or at
least come to this show.

1431
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:15,880
But I disagree that I think I'm scared
of women at work. I don't care to women,

1432
01:23:15,881 --> 01:23:19,310
period. I don't write, don't riff
at work. They turned the sand. I uh,

1433
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:23,380
they fucking hate man scribe ovaries.

1434
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,940
You fuck with people and you can't
take it how you want to be clear.

1435
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,330
I understand. Got It. The whole
way. Black woman at work. Okay.

1436
01:23:31,331 --> 01:23:36,210
We had some black women and I was scared
of them because I thought this is a

1437
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:41,020
woman double whammy.
And the black women right at work,

1438
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,660
they don't like that they're a pariah.
And you know,

1439
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:46,180
you're in the lunchroom riffing and going,
look fag,

1440
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,930
you like hot dogs cause they're Cox. And
then a black woman walks in and they go,

1441
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:52,390
uh, hi, uh Shinika how are you?

1442
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:57,400
And everyone is walking on black
woman eggshells. And that's not fun.

1443
01:23:57,670 --> 01:23:59,380
And I don't think the
black woman like it either.

1444
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,200
Everyone was having fun until
I walked into the lunchroom.

1445
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:05,290
It's hard for me to get into this because
the black women that I know are all

1446
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:06,670
black Comedians,
right?

1447
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:09,610
Black Women Comedians are the black
women that I know from work. Rather.

1448
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:13,900
I should say that's so they're fun,
you know, so it's like Tiffany had it.

1449
01:24:13,901 --> 01:24:16,000
When I say we're,
we're better off when you could riff.

1450
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:18,760
I'm talking about Middle America.
I'm talking about Archie bunker.

1451
01:24:18,761 --> 01:24:22,720
I'm talking about a cubicles and
the lunch room and the water cooler.

1452
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:27,460
And I believe that all this
political correctness has
just made white people say,

1453
01:24:27,461 --> 01:24:30,520
I'm getting away from them.
They're not worth the trouble.

1454
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:35,080
They could ruin my career if I say the
wrong joke. Well, that is a real issue.

1455
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,300
I mean, if you, if you're
dealing with, it's super,

1456
01:24:37,301 --> 01:24:41,260
super fucking sensitive people and you
have them in the workforce. You, you,

1457
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:46,180
you know, if you, if you have a company,
sorry for doing that over and over again.

1458
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:49,710
What was that woman that sued, uh, uh,

1459
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:54,460
famous tech woman who sued some company
and they said she was really hard to

1460
01:24:54,461 --> 01:24:56,290
work with really?
And she lost,

1461
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:59,890
she lost a lawsuit because she said it
was about sexual discrimination. Uh,

1462
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:02,320
all women in every company.
Miss Woman,

1463
01:25:02,321 --> 01:25:04,960
she went on to work for
Google or reddit rather,

1464
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:08,110
she went on to work for Reddit or
the Asian one? Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1465
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:12,440
Didn't she can phone, she ran
reddit or something. She, she, she,

1466
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,030
she didn't run read it, but she was one
of the CEOs. Right, right, right. Um,

1467
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:19,150
I guess that is run
reddit. Right. But she uh,

1468
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:23,110
she sued for Ellen Pao.
Right? That's her name.

1469
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,730
I think she a black
husband. Okay, good for him.

1470
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:27,550
They're wanted for all kinds of fraud.

1471
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:30,610
I think she learned the hustle from
the black husband and he said, oh,

1472
01:25:30,611 --> 01:25:34,870
just bitch about race and a, it's tons
of money. She was bitching about race.

1473
01:25:34,871 --> 01:25:37,690
I think she was bitching about sex,
gender discrimination. But you know,

1474
01:25:37,691 --> 01:25:40,330
they were trying to say that this,
this is not a good person.

1475
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:41,410
She was not a good person.

1476
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:46,050
And that was like the whole argument
behind like having someone like that is,

1477
01:25:46,051 --> 01:25:49,690
is inherently dangerous. Like
if you had, not her in specific,

1478
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:55,060
but having someone who's like looking
for those green lights like we were

1479
01:25:55,061 --> 01:25:58,630
talking about, like with progressive
people looking to find something, some,

1480
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:03,750
some made up transgression that they
can call you out a lot of the time,

1481
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:08,030
sorry from a drifting. But a lot of the
time these women in the workforce, uh,

1482
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:12,320
subliminally recognize they shouldn't be
there and they need to generate income.

1483
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:15,500
So they come up with some sort of
grievance and it's the grievance industry.

1484
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,570
And I was watching TV in the hotel
with my wife this morning. Uh,

1485
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:21,253
uh,

1486
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:24,250
we don't get to watch TV because we have
kids and they don't like the TV being

1487
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:24,651
on at home.

1488
01:26:24,651 --> 01:26:28,790
So I'm just fucking bingeing on reality
shows and hot rod shows and everything.

1489
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,670
And she got bored and
went to see your friends.

1490
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:35,110
And I thought the reason she's
bored with all this reality show,

1491
01:26:35,111 --> 01:26:38,700
like I was watching food factories when
I watched food factories and they're

1492
01:26:38,701 --> 01:26:43,100
showing how you make jam. I can
imagine, oh, I see what they did there.

1493
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:47,090
And I can imagine driving the truck
that is harvest the berries and I can

1494
01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:50,000
imagine inventing the machine
and I can see the screen.

1495
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:52,640
The screen is probably the best way
to get out all the twigs and shit.

1496
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:55,190
And I'm watching like my guys do my shit.

1497
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,220
And I see that when I look
at a building I'm like, Oh,

1498
01:26:58,221 --> 01:27:01,900
you had IBM's there and you built a strong
foundation. Obviously it's 84. So I am,

1499
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:06,470
and I think women don't see the world the
way we do. And it's the same with kids.

1500
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:09,800
Like I'll take my kids to the park and
I'm playing with them and I'm chasing my

1501
01:27:09,801 --> 01:27:14,270
son around and as a monster, but a lot
of the Times after maybe 20 minutes,

1502
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:18,980
then I go, this is getting fucking
tedious. Uh, I'm sick of being a monster,

1503
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:22,880
but my wife has a unlimited patients
when it comes to being with the kids.

1504
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:27,530
So generally overall I'm not,
obviously there's exceptions,

1505
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:32,780
but I think men are better at creating
societies and women are better at

1506
01:27:32,781 --> 01:27:35,600
nurturing. And I just keep
seeing these software types of,

1507
01:27:35,601 --> 01:27:39,100
what about these angry women? You
know, angry feminists or what?

1508
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:42,570
You don't want them raising kids, right?
You don't want fucked up kids. Well,

1509
01:27:42,571 --> 01:27:45,200
what is by these angry?
You're talking about a handful of cons,

1510
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:48,680
but what's happening is these women,
like my wife,

1511
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:52,130
instead of meeting me and having
three kids, they're going,

1512
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:56,030
I guess I should be in the workforce
cause men or women and women or men.

1513
01:27:56,300 --> 01:28:01,300
So she goes into the working on some
stupid converse idea and everyone is just

1514
01:28:01,941 --> 01:28:06,230
sitting pinching the bridge of their nose
going, yeah, that's not going to work.

1515
01:28:06,231 --> 01:28:10,700
We can't use rollingstones music in a
commercial. It'd be like $3 million.

1516
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,633
You know what I mean?

1517
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:20,480
So what he's saying that women should
totally rely on men. They shouldn't.

1518
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:23,300
Another thing relying on men,
look,

1519
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:26,210
you fucking made three human
beings come out of your con.

1520
01:28:26,211 --> 01:28:28,040
But what if they didn't?
What if they didn't?

1521
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:32,210
They didn't have to find a man in order
to get by. Oh, I see what you're saying.

1522
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,600
Well first of all, I'm, I would never say
women aren't allowed in the workforce.

1523
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:40,870
I'm talking about this huge contingent
of women who have forced themselves into

1524
01:28:41,271 --> 01:28:44,360
the workforce and don't like it,
and especially even moms with kids.

1525
01:28:44,361 --> 01:28:47,990
I keep seeing my friends
who have working moms, uh,

1526
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:52,100
getting messages, texts. I've
even seen emails where they go,

1527
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:54,380
I'm fucking miserable. I
hate it. Like Nina Simone,

1528
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,770
I saw this Nina Simone documentary and
they talked about how late out, well,

1529
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:59,090
the implication was she was lazy,

1530
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:02,580
but how miserable she was with
her and I'm watching going, no,

1531
01:29:02,581 --> 01:29:06,060
she's depressed because she's on tour
in Europe and she's not with her fucking

1532
01:29:06,061 --> 01:29:10,200
kids. It's unnatural. Well,
not in that sense. Yeah.

1533
01:29:10,201 --> 01:29:13,200
If you do have children and you're not
with them and you're touring somewhere

1534
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:15,720
that, especially if you're a woman,
that should be really depressing.

1535
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,780
It's depressing.
It's depressing for me.

1536
01:29:18,781 --> 01:29:21,390
If I go on the road for a weekend
and I don't have my kids, I get,

1537
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,400
I get bummed out for two
days are pretty good.

1538
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:28,740
I third day you start missing.
Fourth Day sucks with women.

1539
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:31,350
It's like my wife, we're,
we've been gone for 24 hours.

1540
01:29:31,530 --> 01:29:33,630
My wife won't let me say things.

1541
01:29:33,631 --> 01:29:37,200
My son says cause it'll remind
her it's like a topless wow.

1542
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:41,160
Like he says put down me. If I said put
down me right now to her, she'd be mad.

1543
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:46,230
Right, I understand what you're
saying. Um, I don't, I it's,

1544
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,561
it's,

1545
01:29:46,561 --> 01:29:50,340
it's real hard when you get into these
generalizations like tests because women,

1546
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:53,310
if they don't enter the workforce,
then what do they do?

1547
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:55,050
They wait around for some
guy to pay the bills.

1548
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:59,400
And when the problem with like the
idea of saying that like working moms,

1549
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:02,970
I agree that a lot of women wish they
didn't have to work so they could take

1550
01:30:02,971 --> 01:30:03,571
care of their kids.

1551
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:07,480
But then they're looked in
disparaging ways by then and you know,

1552
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:10,320
talked about in disparaging
ways by men who are like, well,

1553
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:11,760
you don't even contribute
to the household.

1554
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:14,280
Well those guys are fucking
assholes and fuck them. And I,

1555
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:17,460
I don't understand this whole, I need
to work. I don't, I can't afford it.

1556
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:22,590
When I was a kid, we were middle class
and if you had that, my childhood today,

1557
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:25,050
you would be below the poverty line.
Like we had one car,

1558
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:28,110
my mom would get the groceries on
Wednesday after my dad got home.

1559
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,550
We didn't go on vacation much.

1560
01:30:29,551 --> 01:30:33,340
We didn't have babysitters
that I didn't have a car. Uh,

1561
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,510
and it was a perfectly happy life.
But there's this,

1562
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,160
I need to get into the workforce.

1563
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,830
You need to get in the
workforce to pay for the nanny.

1564
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:43,110
You bought yourself into
a higher tax bracket.

1565
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:47,640
You need a car to commute from work.
I think that it's a zero sum game.

1566
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:50,940
You probably bring seven grand a
year to the family where you live in

1567
01:30:50,941 --> 01:30:55,050
Williamsburg. Isn't that like super
expensive? It's fucking insane.

1568
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:59,370
Like how much is Benjamin costs this?
In the past few months I ran the numbers.

1569
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,770
I've been spending $780 a day.

1570
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:06,960
We blew 50 grand since March.
On what?

1571
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:12,450
There's no culprit. I like booze.
I'm an alcoholic. That's $40 a day.

1572
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:16,500
The babysitters and angel are you and I
need a holiday? Yeah, definitely. Yup.

1573
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:20,100
How many days do you tried to take off?
I quit boost for lent.

1574
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:24,950
I didn't have drinks on, I just became
Catholic. I would go up [inaudible].

1575
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,500
How old are you? 45 what the fuck's wrong
with you? Why becoming Catholic now?

1576
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:32,600
I had kids. I was, I believe. I realized
that there's something else going on.

1577
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:34,320
That's why I want everyone
to having else going on.

1578
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:39,300
What a cult of child kid fuckers. What's
what's going on. I was raised Catholic.

1579
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:41,750
Oh really? Yeah. I've been
in that shit when I was weak.

1580
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:46,380
Those child fuckers are called gays. Yeah.
They're called priests too, and they're,

1581
01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:49,890
they're, they're running the
Catholic church by the way.
Okay. You know about that,

1582
01:31:49,891 --> 01:31:53,060
right? That kid fuckers run
the Catholic church. Yeah.

1583
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:58,580
I think there is a problem in the
Catholic church with pedophilia is jai and

1584
01:31:59,951 --> 01:32:00,460
problem.

1585
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:00,790
Right.

1586
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:05,790
A massive probably literally is a cult
of kid fuckers for Nascar had as many

1587
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:10,240
drivers. Fucking kids. It would have
been closed down in the 60s yeah.

1588
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,550
Well the whole Middle East
should be shut down. Yeah,

1589
01:32:12,551 --> 01:32:15,430
but you're joining in on this, why you
joined and why are you giving them money?

1590
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:18,790
Then they pass the tray round.
Do you throw 20 bucks in their thinking?

1591
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:23,110
I hope this goes to kid fuckers.
Uh, no, but to be totally frank,

1592
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:28,230
I realized there that there is a god
and Catholicism was the nearest thing to

1593
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:33,460
grab. I mean, Amen. God. Um,
how did you realize this?

1594
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:39,250
Uh, well first of all, I think that
religion should be a little more private.

1595
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,440
Like my wife, I don't know
what her religion is. Well,

1596
01:32:41,441 --> 01:32:45,280
it's very convenient when people want
to talk about religion and say religion

1597
01:32:45,281 --> 01:32:48,430
should be private because then they
don't have to defend ridiculous ideas.

1598
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:50,940
Religion is a ridiculous idea.
Oh,

1599
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:54,580
by ancient by this idea
that makes no sense.

1600
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:58,630
No one ever like my wife's
American Indian, right. No
one ever top American, sir.

1601
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:02,110
You mean in Digitas?
Indian feather, not dot.

1602
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,740
And I don't know what her fucking
religion is. She never talks about it.

1603
01:33:05,741 --> 01:33:09,670
If someone dies, they do fucking shrooms
and sit in a teepee for three days.

1604
01:33:09,671 --> 01:33:12,680
That's my kind of really doesn't talk
about it. And no one ever criticize.

1605
01:33:12,681 --> 01:33:16,240
Like with Indians, you can't go in a
teepee if you're menstruating. Right.

1606
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:19,230
No one ever talks about that there cause
they don't want the bears to come in

1607
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:23,170
and kill everybody else. They don't have
to justify their, their spirituality.

1608
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:27,350
But for some reason Christianity is,
is like on the chopping block everyday.

1609
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,340
What about this on page three?
I don't understand it.

1610
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,850
He has to defend it because there's
a book, you just said it yourself.

1611
01:33:33,850 --> 01:33:38,530
You don't know what they believe in.
Kind of this kind of interrogation.

1612
01:33:38,531 --> 01:33:39,001
The Koran,

1613
01:33:39,001 --> 01:33:42,850
and we'll get this kind of interrogate
tour is not filled with things that you

1614
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:46,690
would say are magic.
What is magic in the Torah?

1615
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:50,980
What's magic terrorist towards just the
Jew Bible, but what's what they don't,

1616
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:53,230
they don't believe that
Jesus walked on water,

1617
01:33:53,231 --> 01:33:55,990
came back from the dead
or are healed sick.

1618
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,730
I'm not that well versed with the Torah,

1619
01:33:57,731 --> 01:34:02,731
but I assume as a religious
tract it's full of whimsical.

1620
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,570
A superhero.
He's sounding style.

1621
01:34:04,571 --> 01:34:07,450
You have to be able to defend the
hoses in the tour. That was magic.

1622
01:34:07,451 --> 01:34:09,250
He split the sea.
Well,

1623
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:14,020
I don't know if that the parting
of the sea was in the Torah. Is it?

1624
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:16,103
Yeah.
Well,

1625
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:21,160
the thing about it fascinating cause
it kind of brings it all full circle.

1626
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:25,000
The mainstream Jerusalem scholars
now believe that Moses was on drugs.

1627
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:26,640
They believe that Moses was in,

1628
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:30,310
it was taking psychedelic drugs and
that's what the whole burning Bush was.

1629
01:34:30,311 --> 01:34:32,920
The burning Bush
represents the Acacia Bush,

1630
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:38,050
which is a very common plant in that
area. And uh, it's rich with DMT.

1631
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:42,070
So they think that the burning
Bush was them smoking DMT. Wow.

1632
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:44,710
Which is the most potent
psychedelic drug known to man.

1633
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:49,540
And it also gives you all of these
experiences where you feel like you're in

1634
01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:51,430
contact with some sort of a higher power.

1635
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:53,500
So they think that
that's what was going on.

1636
01:34:53,501 --> 01:34:58,250
I use of hallucinogenics also helped
get me here, uh, in my teenage

1637
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:02,120
years. But uh, yeah. Why did
you join the Catholic Church?

1638
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:06,560
Uh, it was the nearest one. I,
I'd like the Knights of Columbus.

1639
01:35:06,561 --> 01:35:09,990
I joined the knights of Columbus.
I'm a third degree night. Uh,

1640
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:13,280
but what made me really
believe in a daddy,

1641
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:15,650
and I don't know why I'm telling this,

1642
01:35:15,651 --> 01:35:20,480
but I was coming home once
and my kid was in her crib,

1643
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:24,680
my first kid and I was looking
at her heel and you know,

1644
01:35:24,681 --> 01:35:29,240
a little baby's heel and I'm like, that
thing fucking works. There's a bone there,

1645
01:35:29,241 --> 01:35:32,750
there's the tissue.
It's got padded tissue below the bone.

1646
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:37,100
And I'd always suspected
there was a god deep down.

1647
01:35:37,101 --> 01:35:41,570
And then I just sort of
washed over me and I went, oh,

1648
01:35:41,571 --> 01:35:42,470
I get it now.

1649
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:48,670
The Big Bang was some sort of omnipotent
force that created the first domino and

1650
01:35:48,981 --> 01:35:51,920
that domino fell and
everything followed after that.

1651
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:56,180
So the Dodo bird is not like God
went and killed the Dodo bird.

1652
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:01,220
He set up this almost like that movie
where the dude drinks the drink and turns

1653
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:06,140
into sand and goes into the
waterfall. Oh yeah, yeah,

1654
01:36:06,141 --> 01:36:10,940
yeah. Um, uh, fuck the uh,
the Prequel to alien. Yes.

1655
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,610
What the hell is that permeates almost
like the beginning of Promethean. They,

1656
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:19,220
that massive, incredibly complex domino
was set off boom with the big bang.

1657
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:24,280
And that me and my daughter's seal.
Wow. That's convenient thinking.

1658
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:28,610
You know, it's, it seems like a guy
who calls out bullshit all the time,

1659
01:36:28,611 --> 01:36:32,420
but then just buys the into that.
Like, it's not about evolution.

1660
01:36:32,421 --> 01:36:37,210
It's not about random, you
know, got successful. Okay.
Evolution is God. Well you,

1661
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:41,640
when you say God though,
do you mean like a guy who created every,

1662
01:36:41,641 --> 01:36:45,770
like a specific individual or shitty
little teeny brains trying to wrap our

1663
01:36:45,771 --> 01:36:48,550
minds around this incredible thing here,
I'll prove to you that exists. Okay.

1664
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:52,790
Don't you think that Catholicism
represents our shitty
little brains that create

1665
01:36:52,791 --> 01:36:57,110
these ridiculous,
pathetic attempt to grasp the infinite by?

1666
01:36:57,111 --> 01:37:00,620
But why join into that?
Like why become a person in all the life?

1667
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:04,250
Like I go to a Latin mass and
I'm in this unbelievable church.

1668
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:07,160
I don't understand what they're saying
is speaking Latin and it's kind of cool.

1669
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:11,720
It just recognizing the miracle that is
birth and I'm just so thankful that I'm

1670
01:37:11,721 --> 01:37:16,721
here and the infant's decimally small
odds that I was created and I'm just sort

1671
01:37:17,361 --> 01:37:21,830
of saying, wow. Uh, thanks. Do you
do the same thing with science?

1672
01:37:21,831 --> 01:37:24,790
Do you go to like the Hayden Planetarium
and do the same thing when you studied

1673
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:29,860
constellations? Sure. I because you think
I think the earth is flat because no

1674
01:37:31,570 --> 01:37:35,600
pro science.
What Catholicism is gallows pretty pro.

1675
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:38,450
What the fuck are you talking of?
All Galileo.

1676
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:42,440
Galileo just kept poking the church
until they eventually said fuck off.

1677
01:37:42,441 --> 01:37:46,550
You're under house arrest. They,
they never really denied that.

1678
01:37:46,551 --> 01:37:49,730
The universal holders on the son.
This is not true at all.

1679
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:53,300
They fucking put him under house arrest
cause he was insisting that the earth

1680
01:37:53,301 --> 01:37:56,130
was not the center of the
universe. Right. But he wouldn't

1681
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:59,940
shut up about it. And they eventually
sent some crop, right? Yes, he was right.

1682
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:03,090
So they locked him out in the Catholic
Church and fuck, he's Filipino too.

1683
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:05,790
Well don't even defend up today here.
How about Ratzinger?

1684
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:09,270
How about the fact that they own the
fucking biggest gay by they own a building

1685
01:38:09,271 --> 01:38:11,580
that houses the biggest
gay bathhouse in Europe.

1686
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:15,210
So you would be okay if I was a member
of a different Christian religions.

1687
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,970
All religions are ridiculous.
I think ideologies are ridiculous.

1688
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,890
Daddy is you're against day as them.

1689
01:38:19,891 --> 01:38:24,690
You're against them against predetermined
patterns of behavior that you

1690
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:29,140
subscribe to that are thousands of years
old that were written by people who

1691
01:38:29,141 --> 01:38:34,140
were extremely ignorant to the facts that
we know now is to how the universe was

1692
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:39,290
formed and how biological life has evolved
and all of the work that science has

1693
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:41,550
done.
That doesn't mean I don't believe in God.

1694
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,780
It doesn't mean I don't believe in the
possibility of there being some grand

1695
01:38:45,781 --> 01:38:50,040
order to this,
but the idea that the Catholic church,

1696
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:53,220
the guy who dresses like a wizard and
sits on a fucking golden throne and you

1697
01:38:53,221 --> 01:38:55,920
have to call him father,
that that's the guy that this is,

1698
01:38:55,921 --> 01:38:59,130
this is that you're trying to
represent us. That's US trying to,

1699
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:02,310
we're doing a really shitty job.
I mean this is, this is a really,

1700
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:05,880
really ancient shit that didn't make
any sense back then and they were,

1701
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:06,990
that's all they had.

1702
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:10,590
But now that we do have science and we
do have so much more knowledge than the

1703
01:39:10,591 --> 01:39:14,760
people who were writing this shit down
in Qumran and fucking animal skins and

1704
01:39:14,761 --> 01:39:19,550
leaving them in clay pots for people
to go over and decipher this is,

1705
01:39:19,551 --> 01:39:23,410
it's, it's ridiculous to
know. It's an idea that uh,

1706
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:26,350
enforced me to a double homicide.
And you said the,

1707
01:39:26,590 --> 01:39:30,090
at the beginning of the show and you said,
we've learned over time,

1708
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,130
it's been a pattern here with murder.
We don't like it.

1709
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:37,530
The Bible was an amalgamation of
all these stories where we went,

1710
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:41,520
here's some things we've learned. Uh,
killing people sucks. Don't do that.

1711
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,920
And it's lasted for 3000 years.

1712
01:39:43,921 --> 01:39:46,680
That's longer than catching where
two different types of cloth.

1713
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:49,920
That's really bad. Yes, it's not perfect.
There is some weird shit in there.

1714
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:54,630
So a lot of weird shit in there guys come
back from the dead and the heel. Okay.

1715
01:39:55,020 --> 01:40:00,020
Do you believe that a good definition
of infinity is if you had monkeys on a

1716
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,350
typewriter forever,

1717
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:04,680
they would eventually print out
the completed works of Shakespeare?

1718
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,190
I think that that
definition of infinity is,

1719
01:40:08,191 --> 01:40:13,191
is a very strange one because the
idea that you would have these monkeys

1720
01:40:13,501 --> 01:40:16,460
randomly typing on a typewriter and
they would come up with the exam.

1721
01:40:16,730 --> 01:40:18,510
There's no evidence that that's possible.

1722
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:22,050
There's no evidence that it's possible
that a monkey just slamming their fingers

1723
01:40:22,051 --> 01:40:27,051
onto a keyboard would type out words in
perfect grammar with periods and commas

1724
01:40:27,811 --> 01:40:31,260
and question marks.
It could possibly be.

1725
01:40:31,261 --> 01:40:35,520
How about a computer that is just randomly
hitting randomly printing out keys?

1726
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:39,850
It's certainly our infinity, would it
not? Eventually in a trillion, trillion,

1727
01:40:39,851 --> 01:40:40,970
trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,

1728
01:40:40,971 --> 01:40:44,790
trillion years happened to have printed
out the complete works of Shakespeare.

1729
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:46,740
It,
it could be possible,

1730
01:40:46,741 --> 01:40:50,070
but I've seen no evidence that it's
ever been able to be replicated.

1731
01:40:50,071 --> 01:40:53,690
Even in a simple sentence, but
you'd never seen evidence. It's, but

1732
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,840
there's what we're talking about.
Something like that.

1733
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:01,030
Something that's never been
replicated even on the tiniest scale.

1734
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:04,600
Yeah. It has been replicated in a
tiny scale. It's called hacking.

1735
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:09,900
You keep trying the password
and eventually the computer
after 3000 tries cracks

1736
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:10,920
your password.
Yeah.

1737
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:14,590
But they'll work on complicated
algorithms that were created by people.

1738
01:41:14,591 --> 01:41:19,360
Like this is not good algorithm to have
random texts punched out on a keyboard,

1739
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:21,700
but it's not random.
They're there testing it.

1740
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:24,850
Like when you were talking about
like a monkey typing on a keyboard,

1741
01:41:24,851 --> 01:41:28,550
the monkey doesn't understand language.
So monkey's using semi colons and the,

1742
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:32,740
and the proper form using like three
periods in a row and then a space,

1743
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:36,310
but doing it over and over again to
form the complete works of Shakespeare.

1744
01:41:36,311 --> 01:41:40,600
Like I guess I get it, I guess I
get it. Okay. But I don't buy it.

1745
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:41,800
Let's start with that.
So you get it.

1746
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:45,760
So we are next to an infinite universe.

1747
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:47,890
That's monkeys on a typewriter.

1748
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:53,430
That means at some point there's
got to be an earth or uh,

1749
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:59,890
a planet like earth. Right.
More than that even. Okay, good.

1750
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:04,810
Right? Then you go, wait a minute. If
I'm doing infinite possibilities here,

1751
01:42:04,811 --> 01:42:08,530
there's going to be an earth where this
is happening. Joe Rogan. Not only that,

1752
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:13,720
the infinite means is the universe is
so big that every single thing that has

1753
01:42:13,721 --> 01:42:18,340
ever happened on earth in the exact same
order has happened an infinite number

1754
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:21,610
of times throughout the cosmos. That's
because you're talking about infinity,

1755
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:24,030
where you're talking about something
that literally has no boundaries.

1756
01:42:24,031 --> 01:42:25,120
So if there is one,

1757
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:29,050
the possibility of there being an
infinite number of those things exist.

1758
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:32,290
You sound like a, not only that, my
next step was going to be science.

1759
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:36,100
There's Joe Rogan interviewing a
guy that's exactly like Joe Rogan,

1760
01:42:36,101 --> 01:42:39,130
but my name's Gavin McInnes, but looked
at it like you, yeah, that's happening.

1761
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,970
And then you go, wait a minute. Sure.
Why does it have to be 2015 in October?

1762
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,350
Maybe it's 1936 and you're talking to
me on an old timey bullhorn, right?

1763
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:52,000
So why does that mean in a minute?
That is mathematically true.

1764
01:42:52,001 --> 01:42:56,860
I know for a fact mathematically that
Joe Rogan is interviewing me with an old

1765
01:42:56,861 --> 01:43:00,760
timey bullhorn in 1936 earth
way the fuck out there.

1766
01:43:00,761 --> 01:43:04,630
And I look exactly like you, right? I
know that to be mathematically true.

1767
01:43:04,631 --> 01:43:06,970
I only have three topics,
two equals four and I have three Cox.

1768
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:11,260
But I also know that that isn't true.
I know that that's not happening.

1769
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:15,860
Well you don't know the show Rogan's not
interviewing me in 1936 how do you know

1770
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:17,110
the planet?
How can you say that?

1771
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:20,770
The fact that those two things
are simultaneously true.

1772
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,850
One and the other is proof. There's
a gun. Wait, what do you mean what?

1773
01:43:24,910 --> 01:43:28,060
I don't understand what you just said.
Don't shake your head like that.

1774
01:43:28,061 --> 01:43:32,520
You fuck you didn't say it God damn
thing. How do you say no, that's not true?

1775
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:35,380
Two is four and I know deep
down two and two is not for.

1776
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:40,690
I know and you know you sound like
a religious person give you that.

1777
01:43:40,691 --> 01:43:42,900
You sound like a guy who
should go to church crazier

1778
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:49,330
where it's 1936 earth. You're interviewing
me in a bull horn and I look like you.

1779
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:52,460
I'm saying all possibilities
in an infinite universe

1780
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,280
could possibly be happening right now.
All possibilities,

1781
01:43:55,281 --> 01:44:00,281
meaning if earth exists and if we do
have cloth in the form of curtains and

1782
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:04,880
again, cameras at work with LCD
crystals and a little tiny statue of,

1783
01:44:04,990 --> 01:44:08,120
of biggie small that that's
possible everywhere. If it,

1784
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:10,580
if it exists here and
the universe is infinite,

1785
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:14,890
that means you're dealing with hundreds
of billions of galaxies, right?

1786
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:17,450
With hundreds of billions
of stars is happening.

1787
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:20,870
We don't know coin flip a coin 10 times.

1788
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:23,540
It's probably going to be a pretty
even distribution of heads and tails.

1789
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:25,760
If I flip a coin for three months,

1790
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:30,710
there's going to be one of those crazy
on Thursday there was a time I had heads

1791
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:32,590
60 times in a row.
I don't know.

1792
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:36,750
Maybe now when you go to
the infinite universe there,

1793
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:40,580
every possibility has to have happened,
right, but we know it didn't happen.

1794
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:45,000
What is, we don't know. It
didn't happen. How can you say
that? We don't know. Rogan,

1795
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,690
Joe Rogan. Gavin's. Dot. That's nonsense.

1796
01:44:47,691 --> 01:44:51,050
We have very little evidence about other
planets at all the evidence that we

1797
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:53,210
have. We've collected all
this data about planets.

1798
01:44:53,211 --> 01:44:56,240
We're looking at the gasses that
they admit in their atmosphere.

1799
01:44:56,241 --> 01:44:59,690
We're looking at the wobble at
the stars around them. Uh, have,

1800
01:44:59,970 --> 01:45:02,810
we could see that there's something
that's circling the stars so we know that

1801
01:45:02,811 --> 01:45:06,800
the light changes. We don't, we
don't have a view into those planets.

1802
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:11,000
We have a view into the planets in our
solar system in a very limited way and

1803
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:14,240
well, we're just now getting to the,
we're just not getting to Pluto.

1804
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:16,310
We're learning how fucking weird Pluto is.

1805
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:19,670
We haven't gone at all into the
Kuyper belt. We don't know anything.

1806
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:22,400
The galactic shelf outside
of our solar system,

1807
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:23,810
there's all sorts of shit out there.

1808
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:27,170
They think there might be a brown dwarf
star that we can't even see that it's

1809
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:29,270
way, way, way outside of Pluto.

1810
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:32,480
We're trying to figure out why
there's certain things out there,

1811
01:45:32,481 --> 01:45:36,170
why the Kuyper belt is filled with all
these objects, why there's a drop off,

1812
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:40,010
what massive body there might
be deep into our solar system.

1813
01:45:40,011 --> 01:45:43,610
And then you go into other solar systems
and other galaxies. This is a fucking,

1814
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:47,780
they've, they've barely scratched the
surface. If you to say that, you know,

1815
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,750
there's not a Gavin out there who looks
like me with three dicks sitting in

1816
01:45:50,751 --> 01:45:54,680
front of a 1930s microphone. It absolutely
could be true and it could be true.

1817
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,400
It could be billions of light years away.
Well, we'll never be able to see it.

1818
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:01,390
That is a great argument against atheism.
No,

1819
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:05,180
you're sitting there saying there's no
god, not just as crazy. At the very least,

1820
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:08,060
I've reduced you to as crazy as me,
and it's nothing.

1821
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:12,060
Nothing has to do with religion. There
nothing, nothing has to do with Josh.

1822
01:46:12,061 --> 01:46:13,280
There's nothing magical,

1823
01:46:13,281 --> 01:46:17,180
omnipotent force or
science or the science.

1824
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:20,750
What's the scientific explanation for
the Big Bang? What started this mess?

1825
01:46:20,751 --> 01:46:23,180
No one knows that. That's a
good one. That's a big miracle.

1826
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:25,850
And what did the Bible say?
There shall be late. Well,

1827
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:28,610
Terrence Mckenna said if science grants,

1828
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:32,540
if they ask for one miracle, they
say, grant, that's one miracle.

1829
01:46:32,630 --> 01:46:35,420
And we'll explain the rest of the
universe. But that's just because of,

1830
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:37,110
it's a lack of information.
It's,

1831
01:46:37,111 --> 01:46:39,470
they don't know whether or
not the big bang is even true.

1832
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:43,010
There's a lot of scientists that believe
that it could be possible that the

1833
01:46:43,011 --> 01:46:46,520
universe exists in a constant
state of expansion and compression.

1834
01:46:46,521 --> 01:46:49,980
The same way the tide's work the same way.
There's cycles of breathing in and

1835
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,760
breathing out that the universe will
expand and do some infinite direction.

1836
01:46:53,761 --> 01:46:58,680
Then come back and some infinitely small
place. This is why I believe in God.

1837
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:02,820
That's why you believe in a cult of
child fuckers that give you bread that's

1838
01:47:02,821 --> 01:47:07,450
supposed to be the the flesh of God.
Drink, drink my blood. There's one,

1839
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:12,210
a sad human attempt to act
out what you just described.

1840
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:15,660
Religion as a sad human attempt
to act out what you described.

1841
01:47:15,661 --> 01:47:18,690
So what you're saying
with the traditions are a,

1842
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,080
maybe I shouldn't say meager meager,

1843
01:47:22,081 --> 01:47:25,650
a humble attempt to grasp what
you were just talking about.

1844
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:27,510
I think it's rigid ideology.

1845
01:47:27,511 --> 01:47:31,110
I think it's rigid ideology that they try
to control behavior and they want your

1846
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:35,550
money. People shouldn't go to church
until they're 30 because when I go there,

1847
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:38,850
I just see all these nice Old
Lady Sang, God bless you. Well,

1848
01:47:38,851 --> 01:47:41,730
that's not looking at a big building
like Jason Jones. You know what?

1849
01:47:41,731 --> 01:47:45,900
Jason Jones from the daily show?
No, Samantha Bee's husband.

1850
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:48,480
I don't know her either.
Okay, so he was saying,

1851
01:47:48,690 --> 01:47:50,640
I wish there was a religion I could join.

1852
01:47:50,641 --> 01:47:52,800
It wasn't religious
and I think Bob Bowdon,

1853
01:47:52,801 --> 01:47:56,790
Kirk's kids go to a fucking Jewish
school where the rabbis are atheists.

1854
01:47:57,180 --> 01:48:01,350
So that thing exists, but
okay, after we agreed on that,

1855
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:03,690
that that would be a cool thing because
that was back when I was an atheist.

1856
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:07,470
I go, Jason, I went to this
thing, it's called church.

1857
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:12,150
Like they don't talk about gays and
dinosaurs. They just say, God bless you.

1858
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:16,260
Oh, and you're in. They're
going, thanks that I'm here.

1859
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:20,640
Kaison dinosaurs in abortion don't
come up. You just sit there going,

1860
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:25,110
Jesus Christ, what a miracle
we're here. I'm so thankful.

1861
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:28,560
I'm so thankful that, well that sounds
all positive. That sounds all positive.

1862
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:33,830
But the idea of like subscribing to this
ideology and doing it because you want

1863
01:48:35,221 --> 01:48:38,490
to somehow or another put order to
something that doesn't have order.

1864
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:43,350
I don't want to put order no or I'm an
all of the chaos. It's like an all room.

1865
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:46,650
Okay and that's native
American religions too.

1866
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:49,170
They sit there and they give thanks to
the north. They give thanks for this.

1867
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:52,110
Thanks to the east to the West.
All religions are the same.

1868
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:55,890
Well I think sank furnace Muslim
religions because they have such a severe

1869
01:48:55,891 --> 01:48:58,650
problem with inbreeding that
they've gone backwards in time.

1870
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:04,380
He just did it again. Huh? See what he
did. I see what you did. They're done.

1871
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:05,910
If I'll look at it,

1872
01:49:05,911 --> 01:49:09,390
ran in 1965 and look at her and
now they've gone backwards in time.

1873
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:13,890
Well a lot of that has to do with a war.

1874
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:17,040
A lot of that has to do with all sorts
of fucked up shit that's going on in the

1875
01:49:17,041 --> 01:49:18,850
middle of the marriage through
his cousin is what it has.

1876
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:23,160
Our are really relying on them for oil.

1877
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:26,250
There's a lot of shit going on.
Line in the oil well,

1878
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:29,490
showing them how to mine oil and
then paying them tons of money.

1879
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:32,700
Well that's also created.
These oligarchs created these monarchs,

1880
01:49:32,701 --> 01:49:35,970
these people that have insane amounts
of power and wealth and control these

1881
01:49:36,030 --> 01:49:39,510
these areas. Let's crack then if it's,
if you hate it over there so much.

1882
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:41,940
I just don't want to ruin our earth.

1883
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:46,140
I don't want to ruin the natural resources
of our planet, of our, of our country.

1884
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:47,440
I don't necessarily that,

1885
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,390
I don't think there's anything good about
giving these people insane amounts of

1886
01:49:52,391 --> 01:49:55,300
money or that there's anything
good about relying on them.

1887
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:59,880
I think also we're dependent upon fossil
fuel so much that we've innovated and

1888
01:49:59,881 --> 01:50:02,920
that's this one direction
and such an extreme way.

1889
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:07,180
I find people like Elon Musk pretty
fucking fascinating because he's trying to

1890
01:50:07,181 --> 01:50:12,070
figure out some way to do it
in a different way to find
out a way. The left goes,

1891
01:50:12,071 --> 01:50:15,340
no, I don't like that. I feel like
when you want to Bitch, oh the left,

1892
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:19,050
like we get a pint of left
Canada Fox News here. Yes,

1893
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:22,480
we get a pipe that goes from Canada
down here. How's that? Uh, no,

1894
01:50:22,481 --> 01:50:26,650
it would kill a bunch of owls.
Okay. How about we, we, we
frack here? No, no, no, no.

1895
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:30,580
Okay. So you want us to continue
dealing with these fucking inbreds well,

1896
01:50:30,581 --> 01:50:35,110
we have done some really stupid things in
the past that have ruined environments.

1897
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:39,540
That's the same. What's, what's Chernobyl?
That's what's going on. And it Fukushima,

1898
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:44,230
there's a lot of different areas of this
country that we could point to all the,

1899
01:50:44,231 --> 01:50:48,820
the, what was it? Love Canal.
Was that fucking one area
that the Poise Mile Island?

1900
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:50,540
No, no, no, no. There was a, there's a,

1901
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,850
there's been quite a few of them then
and then of course safe all the nuclear

1902
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:57,940
tests that they've done. I
love that one. Animated Gif.

1903
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:01,600
We see all the nuclear tests throughout
history and all the ones they've been

1904
01:51:01,601 --> 01:51:06,250
disliking up in Nevada, Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah. If you're seeing
that. No. Oh, it's amazing.

1905
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:10,180
It shows you nuclear tests
throughout history and you know,

1906
01:51:10,181 --> 01:51:14,230
you see like the first ones in the
forties like boom, like Whoa, boom.

1907
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:18,400
And then somewhere around like 1950s,
1960s,

1908
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:21,580
they go crazy. And in Nevada, they just,

1909
01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:24,490
just over and over and over again,

1910
01:51:24,491 --> 01:51:28,370
racking off thousands of nuclear
explosions and that, you know,

1911
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:31,780
that's how John Wayne died.
That was how the hulk was created.

1912
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:36,010
I don't think that's true.
The whole gamma rays is a different thing.

1913
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:38,470
But it was in Nevada at a
test site, was it not? Well,

1914
01:51:38,471 --> 01:51:43,000
I think it was an experiment with gamma
radiation that went wrong. Look at this.

1915
01:51:43,001 --> 01:51:47,170
This is the thing. This is a, an
animated Gif file. And if you look,

1916
01:51:47,171 --> 01:51:52,171
it shows the dates and then around
1940 [inaudible] 1949 now this,

1917
01:51:53,001 --> 01:51:57,610
this is where coming in late because,
uh, why don't we see these Jamie,

1918
01:51:57,850 --> 01:52:01,770
there's one. Boom, Sophie, this is late.
You started it late time lapse of every,

1919
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:04,060
so we're in the 1950s now.

1920
01:52:04,061 --> 01:52:06,250
These are the United States
ones have already gone off.

1921
01:52:06,310 --> 01:52:08,830
What's a matter with this?
If you look at the time, uh,

1922
01:52:08,831 --> 01:52:13,150
up in the upper right hand corner
explosions, well, what's a matter with it?

1923
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:17,340
Well, with it effectively Google,
boom, boom, boom, boom. Well,

1924
01:52:17,650 --> 01:52:20,050
they're blowing up shit in the ocean.
They're blown up shit.

1925
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:24,100
But there's a lot of those areas that
are just extremely toxic now. Like,

1926
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:28,960
like Chernobyl, chilled nearables
a fucking mess now the communist,

1927
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:33,400
but we have to use nuclear weapons.
It ended World War II.

1928
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:36,520
The Chinese, you know what?
The Chinese, the Japanese,

1929
01:52:36,521 --> 01:52:40,290
you know what they were doing.
You got to read this book, uh,

1930
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:45,290
the Rape of Nanking broken. You know that
Angelina Jolie movie? No, she ruined it.

1931
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:46,070
This guy,
Lee,

1932
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:49,100
uh, Louis Zamperini, she ruined it. Yeah.

1933
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:54,050
What about the people that wrote a book?
Now the book is awesome. The movie blows,

1934
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:57,800
right? But did she write the script?
Oh, it was her baby. Oh, was hers.

1935
01:52:58,130 --> 01:53:00,860
She created it.
She did the movie of the book.

1936
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,600
I want to get back to mark
Marin eventually. Okay. I
hate a lot of famous people,

1937
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:11,930
but uh, he said when he
was a pow in world war two,

1938
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:15,320
the reason I brought up Angelina Jolie's
cause I was gonna say, if you here,

1939
01:53:15,321 --> 01:53:17,180
if you're interested in unbroken,

1940
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:19,700
please don't be discouraged
by the shitty movie.

1941
01:53:19,701 --> 01:53:21,440
It's a fucking unbelievable book.

1942
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:26,480
Where this pow was stranded on a fucking
raft for 35 days. He beat up sharks.

1943
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:29,150
He got in fist fights with sharks.
Anyway,

1944
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:32,060
in the book when he's a a Japanese pow,

1945
01:53:32,061 --> 01:53:35,660
he saw Japanese women and
children being trained to fight.

1946
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:40,400
And this wash of doom came over
him cause he goes, oh my God,

1947
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:43,970
after we kill all their men,
there's still gonna fucking fight.

1948
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,230
How are we ever going to end this war?

1949
01:53:46,231 --> 01:53:48,860
Or they're going to go right down to
the woman and children, four year old,

1950
01:53:48,861 --> 01:53:52,430
we're gonna be fighting four year olds
before this war is over. And then Kaboom,

1951
01:53:52,431 --> 01:53:55,910
Kaboom lit the whole island on fire.
Horrible bombs.

1952
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:58,850
I'm not pro nuclear guy ended the war,

1953
01:53:59,090 --> 01:54:02,680
but isn't there a lot of evidence there
were already willing to surrender and

1954
01:54:02,681 --> 01:54:06,650
that we didn't want to pay any attention
to their children is not surrendering.

1955
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:08,150
Yeah,
but that's just survival.

1956
01:54:08,151 --> 01:54:11,390
I mean it just anecdotal evidence of
training women and children doesn't mean

1957
01:54:11,391 --> 01:54:14,710
that the country wasn't willing to give
up. They were starving. I mean there,

1958
01:54:14,711 --> 01:54:16,970
there was embargoes.
They were in a real bad place.

1959
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,450
There was evidence that Japan was willing
to surrender and then we just fucking

1960
01:54:20,451 --> 01:54:21,261
bond them anyway.
Yeah,

1961
01:54:21,261 --> 01:54:23,960
we bombed them cause we wanted to make
a point and we wanted to test out our

1962
01:54:23,961 --> 01:54:26,940
shit really well, I'll have
to look into that. This,

1963
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:28,910
there's arguments on both sides obviously.

1964
01:54:28,911 --> 01:54:31,700
Cause you're talking about something
that took place 70 fucking years ago.

1965
01:54:31,701 --> 01:54:32,660
It's a long ass time.

1966
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:37,340
But I think there's arguments that can
be made that they didn't have to do that.

1967
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:39,140
Can I get a bucket to Piss in?
Yeah,

1968
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:43,070
we can go piss this a bathroom right
out there. Don't worry about it man.

1969
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:46,880
Don't worry about it. We'll
pause this pitch. All right.

1970
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:51,440
He's a fascinating guy, isn't
it? Yeah, it's uh, it's,

1971
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:55,820
it's cute cause like he's fucking
around. But in these, not fucking around,

1972
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:57,110
it's like a sort of a,

1973
01:54:58,220 --> 01:55:01,820
it's sort of like a low rent
Gonzo journalism thing he's doing,

1974
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:03,800
but he's sort of,

1975
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:09,700
he has like real opinions and then he
fucks around when you challenge those real

1976
01:55:11,001 --> 01:55:15,950
opinions and says like really brash
things that he doesn't really believe.

1977
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:20,690
Very Fox News Ish.
I don't think it's Fox News,

1978
01:55:20,990 --> 01:55:23,390
but I find it fascinating that
all these right wing guys,

1979
01:55:23,391 --> 01:55:26,690
they have to be religious.
It's a part of the protocol.

1980
01:55:26,810 --> 01:55:31,810
You have to align yourself with people
that will blindly support you or we'll,

1981
01:55:32,061 --> 01:55:35,360
we'll,
we'll take you in if you were like,

1982
01:55:35,361 --> 01:55:40,250
you have to be religious like Steven
Crowder, religious, Milo, Yiannopoulos,

1983
01:55:40,251 --> 01:55:41,084
religious,

1984
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:46,480
all those guys they have in common
that they represent the right and it's,

1985
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:49,740
I don't necessarily even buy it. I
don't, I don't think they're really,

1986
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:51,390
they're really subscribing to it.

1987
01:55:51,391 --> 01:55:56,391
I think you have to align yourself with
people that liberal blindly support you

1988
01:55:57,691 --> 01:56:01,140
and that's like one of the best ways to
do it. That's how Reagan got in office,

1989
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:04,680
right. Lined himself with
the fucking religious people.

1990
01:56:05,310 --> 01:56:07,860
That's how he got in there.
I don't know. There's this,

1991
01:56:08,490 --> 01:56:12,450
all Canadians think that America is run
by Christians and then I moved here and

1992
01:56:12,451 --> 01:56:16,050
I saw a bunch of atheists,
but running the country,

1993
01:56:16,051 --> 01:56:18,570
well they have to say they're Christian.
You have to brush.

1994
01:56:18,730 --> 01:56:21,840
Obama doesn't believe in God. How
do you know Christian? I can tell.

1995
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:24,810
How can you tell him? Look at his
eyes. The black. I could smell it.

1996
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:28,140
Really? Yeah. You think he's gay?

1997
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:30,143
Uh,

1998
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:34,870
I have heard that rumor.
It doesn't really wash,

1999
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:37,510
but I do believe a lot of conspiracy shit.
Like what?

2000
01:56:37,630 --> 01:56:40,030
I don't think his birth certificate.
His real real,

2001
01:56:40,031 --> 01:56:43,920
I think only one of his daughters
is his birth daughter. What? Yup.

2002
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:45,820
I'd never heard that one yet.
You got to talk to Charlotte.

2003
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,740
Have you ever had Charles Johnson on the
show? Yes he is. He's a silly boy. No,

2004
01:56:50,741 --> 01:56:54,910
he's a great guy. He's a,
he's a nerd beyond nerd. He's
a robot. He's such a nerd.

2005
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:58,330
Right.
And his research is fucking amazing.

2006
01:56:58,780 --> 01:57:00,880
Well he definitely does.

2007
01:57:00,881 --> 01:57:04,600
A lot of reading goes after people
because he says some preposterous shit.

2008
01:57:04,990 --> 01:57:08,890
Like what? What the thing about
taking out deray Mckesson,

2009
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:11,880
he didn't mean shoot him.
Doesn't matter the way you say it.

2010
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:15,070
It was like saying it like that.
When you say something like that,

2011
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:17,170
how much would it cost for
someone to take him out?

2012
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:20,660
Like you have to be like really specific
when you say something like that.

2013
01:57:20,661 --> 01:57:24,860
And we were talking about a
marginalized figure. Who's a, uh,

2014
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:28,660
you know, and maybe people would say a
civil rights activist. He should've said,

2015
01:57:28,661 --> 01:57:31,480
take down, take down even. It's weird.

2016
01:57:31,630 --> 01:57:35,770
How about look up dirt on him. Be Real
specifics to what you're looking for.

2017
01:57:37,210 --> 01:57:41,470
This is nitpicking. Yeah. Maybe I got
some gossip. You want some gossip? Sure.

2018
01:57:42,010 --> 01:57:46,370
So I was uh, I do a show on
Anthony Caminos network. Right.

2019
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:51,460
And uh, uh, I was going to be on race
wars with Sherrod small Kurt Metzger. Huh?

2020
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:55,270
No, I hate oop for what
he did to Anthony. Well,

2021
01:57:55,271 --> 01:57:59,880
what it opie do nothing. You mean that
he didn't support him? Yeah. Yeah.

2022
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:02,020
And they should,
they should have left together.

2023
01:58:02,290 --> 01:58:06,040
Their contract was at least put up a
bit of a fight or at least call the guy.

2024
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:09,700
Yeah. Well I think a series probably
offered them a lot of money. Right.

2025
01:58:09,701 --> 01:58:12,150
And he has a wife and kids
and this is what you do.

2026
01:58:12,170 --> 01:58:14,110
Internet thing was not serious.

2027
01:58:14,111 --> 01:58:18,130
Offered me a ton of money and I got
wife and kids. I know what you do.

2028
01:58:18,131 --> 01:58:21,250
You do exactly what the Jeremy
Clarkson people at top gear did.

2029
01:58:21,490 --> 01:58:23,050
You just step back.
Everybody,

2030
01:58:23,051 --> 01:58:25,690
when Jeremy Clarkson got in
that fight with the PR producer,

2031
01:58:25,691 --> 01:58:28,660
a top care and they fired him,
punched the guy after a 12 hour shift,

2032
01:58:28,661 --> 01:58:29,494
lost his temper,

2033
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:33,790
James May and a Robert with the
books is it was the other guy's name,

2034
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:40,260
whatever, they, they, they
stepped back and they went,
okay, uh, were the show's over.

2035
01:58:40,261 --> 01:58:42,010
We're not doing this anymore.
We're not doing it without them.

2036
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:46,000
And they decided that they recast top
gear and those guys are now doing their

2037
01:58:46,001 --> 01:58:50,950
own show with, uh, the,
uh, Amazon network. That's
fucking awesome. It's great.

2038
01:58:50,951 --> 01:58:54,730
I wouldn't even ask that of, Oop, I
would just say at least try. Like,

2039
01:58:54,770 --> 01:58:56,950
I had these friends who,
you know,

2040
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:59,890
we're always trying to get pilots made
and trying to get shows on the air.

2041
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:03,760
And uh, this guy did like a funny
news show and they didn't like,

2042
01:59:03,790 --> 01:59:06,700
they liked the concept of show. They
didn't like him as a host and they'd go,

2043
01:59:06,701 --> 01:59:09,640
well, how about you as the host?
And we were all friends and he goes,

2044
01:59:10,090 --> 01:59:13,390
they want me as the host and it's
his show. What should I do? I don't,

2045
01:59:13,450 --> 01:59:14,283
I don't know what to do.

2046
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:19,320
I go fucking call him and
present the situation and go,

2047
01:59:19,901 --> 01:59:23,160
this is the deal. They're not going to
hire you talk opiate. Fuck no talk at all.

2048
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:26,500
I don't think they spoken since watts.
So when Anthony got fired,

2049
01:59:26,501 --> 01:59:30,280
that was the last day spoke. Yup. What
he just thought, fuck you. You fucked up.

2050
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:35,590
I don't need this shit. That's what
I finally, yeah, finally. Yeah.

2051
01:59:35,591 --> 01:59:38,870
I think he was looking forward to an end.
The,

2052
01:59:38,930 --> 01:59:41,830
there's some fights on
youtube where there's a one,

2053
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:46,120
a show where he was like
chewing grapes, I think, uh,

2054
01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:50,230
and he wasn't paying attention or Anthony
wasn't listening or opioids chewing

2055
01:59:50,231 --> 01:59:53,800
grapes. I can't remember what the
details were, but oop. Loses his temper.

2056
01:59:53,801 --> 01:59:56,630
And he goes, this isn't gonna last
forever. We're going to, we've got, uh,

2057
01:59:56,650 --> 02:00:00,010
maybe another year or so, but we're
done. Yeah, I heard of that one. Yeah.

2058
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:05,590
And I'm even fine with that, but just
call the dude and go, I'm done. You know,

2059
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:09,730
we live in this shitty society where
people don't fucking talk to each other

2060
02:00:09,731 --> 02:00:13,810
anymore. Even, even my anarcho
punk friends crass, they,

2061
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:16,990
they penny Rimbaud, they're gonna
start a crass. He goes conflict.

2062
02:00:16,991 --> 02:00:21,850
We're getting all kinds of royalties
from our songs and w fuck them.

2063
02:00:21,851 --> 02:00:25,090
We're never speaking to him again. And
I go, did you call Collin from conflict?

2064
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:29,530
And he goes, no, I just, I mean that's
why I hood. They'll give him a call.

2065
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:34,030
It turns out they had a crass cover on
one of their live albums and technically

2066
02:00:34,031 --> 02:00:36,010
they should have been giving the
royalties from that side of that.

2067
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:41,020
Why didn't you fucking call them? Anyway?
Um, that's a very specific instance.

2068
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:44,080
I know. So race wars, so race
wars, there's going to be on it.

2069
02:00:44,110 --> 02:00:46,780
I am going to be on on Wednesday
to discuss exactly this, but uh,

2070
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:52,900
I get this text from curt is going to be
so pissed. I'm bringing this up again,

2071
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:55,750
but uh, it said, hey man, do
you have some oop shit going on?

2072
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:59,730
And I on Anthony show a long time ago,
I don't feel strongly,

2073
02:00:59,731 --> 02:01:03,880
but opiate all it really, I am actually
very new to open Anthony. And I said,

2074
02:01:04,150 --> 02:01:06,100
I just noticed as a new listener,

2075
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:08,740
every time there's a fun
riff going with Jim and Anne.

2076
02:01:08,770 --> 02:01:10,330
That's funny cause they're funny guys.

2077
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:13,780
Opie would come in like a
chick and just go, yeah,

2078
02:01:13,781 --> 02:01:16,970
well you shower and I'll show her
right guys. And you just hear the,

2079
02:01:16,971 --> 02:01:21,040
the vibe cold brew and
it would ruin the fun.

2080
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:26,080
And I called him a torpid slough
meaning a slow slough, even slow.

2081
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:29,530
Torpid torpid [inaudible] I've never
even heard that word. It's a great word.

2082
02:01:29,531 --> 02:01:31,690
Thank you.
I'll add that to the vernacular.

2083
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:35,470
Torpid and luxurious are great ways to
say [inaudible] what does lugubrious mean?

2084
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:38,850
Same thing. Slow. Yeah. Why
not just say slow, slow.

2085
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,770
That sounds like English
language and I want to expand it.

2086
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:47,210
That's why I hate it so much.
The massacre at everyday. Um,

2087
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:51,950
so, uh, that's a beef I
have with Opi guests. Right.

2088
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,870
And by the way, with, as far as beef,

2089
02:01:54,110 --> 02:01:58,880
I'm sure both of us personally
feel like one molecule of contempt.

2090
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:01,900
Okay. But if you asked me
about him, that's my opinion.

2091
02:02:01,910 --> 02:02:06,530
It's like my opinion on Macy gray,
not my cup of tea. The singer. Yeah.

2092
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:10,490
Like I don't have a beef with Macy gray.
I just think she sucks.

2093
02:02:10,670 --> 02:02:15,620
I don't even know her songs.
Black one. She's just one
really good song. Yeah. Yeah.

2094
02:02:16,460 --> 02:02:20,230
Choke. Oh Wow. Hey, don't buy an add.

2095
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:24,320
Shulk oh yeah. I think she abandoned her
kids actually. Freelance career here.

2096
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:29,570
Are you just making that up? No. Maybe
the NERC could look it up, but the nerd,

2097
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:34,610
how dare you. Maybe just super cool
guy gets laid a lot. Can look it up.

2098
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:39,130
But um, anyway, Kurt goes, do you
have some weird beef with the ob?

2099
02:02:39,150 --> 02:02:42,560
I think we got to, we gotta
cancel. You what? Yeah.

2100
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:47,270
And so I, we gotta cancel you from a
podcast. You have a beef with opie.

2101
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:51,350
Why would he do that?
To save his job,

2102
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:55,700
to say the shop and then Sharana
Stan [inaudible] how's it saving?

2103
02:02:55,710 --> 02:02:59,180
Is His job? Because it's on opie
radio resources on opie radio.

2104
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:02,360
Ah,
so then Shirod call.

2105
02:03:02,361 --> 02:03:04,760
That's why you should be on a
fucking network right there.

2106
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:10,010
Cause I have people on here that are our
enemies with people who are my friends

2107
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:12,950
and I'm friends with both of them. And
they have fucking beef with each other.

2108
02:03:12,951 --> 02:03:16,190
I'm like, Eh, like dom Irrera and dice
clay, they fucking hate each other.

2109
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:20,210
They're both friends of mine.
That's good radio. It's, I don't,

2110
02:03:20,390 --> 02:03:25,390
I don't take sides unless
there's something like if
he's just arguing like this

2111
02:03:25,911 --> 02:03:30,350
guy sounds dumb or that guy either has
to be some reason like you have to have

2112
02:03:30,351 --> 02:03:33,320
done, it has to be some
transgression that I can't accept.

2113
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:36,280
You know where I say I have to put
my foot down, but it was just, ah,

2114
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:37,610
this guy sounds like a chick.

2115
02:03:37,670 --> 02:03:41,300
Or the exception is it's
this guy threatened your
wife and kids or something.

2116
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:46,560
It's a felony or you were
a rat or [inaudible] you
steal jokes or there's got to

2117
02:03:47,601 --> 02:03:50,270
be stealing jokes. I actually, my,

2118
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:53,600
one of my favorite things on the Internet
is you confronting Carlos Been Sia.

2119
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:58,010
That's what you do. You fucking go to
the guy and go this joke, this joke,

2120
02:03:58,011 --> 02:04:01,430
this joke, this joke now. Well with
that guy it kind of had to be done.

2121
02:04:01,431 --> 02:04:03,680
But when you have people like that,

2122
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:07,460
that's a reason to not have them on like
that. Makes Sense. Like there's this,

2123
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:08,980
even Carlos been, see, I'd,

2124
02:04:09,050 --> 02:04:12,940
I would imagine today him on this show
that would be fucking, what's his name?

2125
02:04:12,941 --> 02:04:17,030
Did he vantage, I'm sorry.
He's so dumb. If you had them
on, you would just be like,

2126
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:22,010
oh, this is just fluff. Come to get him
out of here. Then he leaves like there's,

2127
02:04:22,011 --> 02:04:24,740
uh, uh, what's his name? And
you have to deal with them.

2128
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:28,190
This duty was on opie and
Anthony once who lies, uh,

2129
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,440
who locker Mexico.

2130
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:35,180
And he was talking with some threesome
that he filmed and with a fitting Beta

2131
02:04:35,181 --> 02:04:38,280
tape. And they're like, where's the tape
then if you filmed it right. And, uh,

2132
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:39,960
he didn't know because he was lying.

2133
02:04:39,961 --> 02:04:41,520
And then they just go
get the fuck outta here.

2134
02:04:41,521 --> 02:04:44,790
And he leaves and it's a fucking great
clip. And then they tore up his book. Yes,

2135
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:48,540
yes. Yeah. But anyway, um, she goes, yeah.

2136
02:04:48,541 --> 02:04:52,830
And then Shirod who's sort of the
Alpha male that show goes, uh,

2137
02:04:54,990 --> 02:04:58,020
he goes, every time I do is an
invitation to him. He says it's Slavey,

2138
02:04:58,021 --> 02:05:02,400
so I won't do it. Slavey yeah, I go, I'm
Canadian. We don't do slavery shit. Uh,

2139
02:05:02,610 --> 02:05:03,900
he goes,
Nigga,

2140
02:05:04,110 --> 02:05:09,030
I did ob didn't cancel you and Nigga
give a, I can send you, I want it.

2141
02:05:09,031 --> 02:05:12,690
And I go, why? And he goes, I
wanted to be more informed and I go,

2142
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:18,180
then text me and go, did you threaten his
kids and wife? And then I would text. No.

2143
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:21,300
And then you go, you're on an
accusation. No, but I'm saying, oh,

2144
02:05:21,301 --> 02:05:25,590
that's a reason to cancel. So find out if
it's the big one. And then if it's not,

2145
02:05:25,591 --> 02:05:26,520
say let's have it on there.

2146
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:31,020
And the same thing happened
with Jim Norton on Opie and
Anthony back when it was

2147
02:05:31,021 --> 02:05:31,854
opie and Anthony.

2148
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:37,070
He was doing a show with vice and I was
scheduled to be on and he bumped it and

2149
02:05:38,071 --> 02:05:42,990
I called him now Jim, Jim Shriner.
And I love, by the way, I'm sorry,

2150
02:05:42,991 --> 02:05:45,060
I'm fucking talking shit.
Awesome dudes.

2151
02:05:45,090 --> 02:05:49,010
But this is just a thing that I think
someone did wrong. I mean Uj walking,

2152
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:52,710
it's a Georgian. Shouldn't
Ajay won? Um, so Jim goes, no,

2153
02:05:52,711 --> 02:05:54,690
I want it to be informed
before I had you on.

2154
02:05:54,691 --> 02:05:59,691
And we fought for an hour and a half
about this and I couldn't get anywhere in

2155
02:06:00,021 --> 02:06:01,990
the air. It was like that David
Cross thing about free lunches.

2156
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:04,200
I couldn't move forward.
It was just, and I go,

2157
02:06:04,410 --> 02:06:07,530
how can you fucking
believe that informed what?

2158
02:06:07,531 --> 02:06:12,060
You always have a dossier on every guest
and you understand every facet of their

2159
02:06:12,061 --> 02:06:15,240
lives. You didn't want me on cause you
had a vice show and you didn't mind to

2160
02:06:15,241 --> 02:06:18,710
jeopardize it. He goes, no, I didn't want
you bringing up some beef with someone.

2161
02:06:18,711 --> 02:06:22,500
Advice that I didn't know about and I'm
like well then have it out on the air.

2162
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:24,630
Well not only that,
how about just do a little research.

2163
02:06:24,690 --> 02:06:26,760
I mean how long does it take
to find out and ask you?

2164
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:29,910
I had a guy on my show who
believes the earth is flat.

2165
02:06:29,970 --> 02:06:32,940
I had a guy that's been fucking
said to be youtube clips.

2166
02:06:32,941 --> 02:06:36,960
He's angry and they made a hate video
about me cause I deny that the earth is

2167
02:06:36,961 --> 02:06:41,961
flat and he finds in consistencies
with the space station photographs.

2168
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:45,180
Hilarious huddle theory.
I think it's called adorable.

2169
02:06:45,410 --> 02:06:49,050
Clearly it wasn't informed on
puddle theory when I had the guy on,

2170
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:54,030
clearly I didn't go, well actually the
Antarctica has been explored in the 1936,

2171
02:06:54,031 --> 02:06:56,850
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was
like, so what's this? The earth is flat.

2172
02:06:56,851 --> 02:07:00,230
And then we discussed the flatter
and what did the guys say? Well,

2173
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:05,550
can I watch that? What's, what's
the episode? Or You got David Webb,

2174
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:08,400
uh, down the rabbit hole.
Deep down the rabbit hole guy.

2175
02:07:08,401 --> 02:07:12,040
He has a podcast on standup. New York
is a rabbit hole, but rabbit holes,

2176
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:15,330
the earth is flat. He's one of
many people who believe this. Yeah.

2177
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:19,290
It actually made him believe in God
because he thought the Great Creator made

2178
02:07:19,291 --> 02:07:22,830
this series of puddles. Wow.
There's a series of Sherwood.

2179
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:26,730
He's long gather and talk about 1930s of
microphones and dude's to three dicks.

2180
02:07:27,450 --> 02:07:31,770
Jesus fucking Christ. So what,
what is the beef with, with Vice?

2181
02:07:31,771 --> 02:07:34,110
You guys started to get like a,
Shane Smith is a good friend of mine,

2182
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:39,160
but we never easy though. Yeah, I liked
that guy. Okay. How dare you. Okay.

2183
02:07:39,290 --> 02:07:43,990
I like him. I like him. He's, he's, uh,
I mean I grew a love him. How about that?

2184
02:07:43,991 --> 02:07:48,790
I hug them when I see him really? Well.
He's a sweetie. I think that, uh, he, uh,

2185
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:52,570
he's not a friend of mine. Um, but
uh, you grew up together. Yeah.

2186
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:56,260
When did it go wrong? Uh,
oh six. What happened?

2187
02:07:57,970 --> 02:08:01,480
I think it was, I mean, I, I legally can't
talk about it cause I sold my shares.

2188
02:08:01,481 --> 02:08:04,660
So I did a nondisclosure non
disparagement thing, get paid.

2189
02:08:04,690 --> 02:08:08,620
I got fucking incredibly paid. I make
great money since then too. But uh,

2190
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:13,720
uh, I just keep hearing things about him
and I go, really? People believe that.

2191
02:08:13,721 --> 02:08:16,960
Like I got this story recently.
Oh yeah.

2192
02:08:16,961 --> 02:08:21,960
When I was in the Bosnian war as a war
reporter, uh, writing about Tito and, uh,

2193
02:08:22,510 --> 02:08:25,720
I thought a lot of these war journalists
are lazy. And I'm like, dude,

2194
02:08:25,721 --> 02:08:29,350
you weren't even there.
And we're reporters.

2195
02:08:29,530 --> 02:08:33,940
Producers died reporting on that war and
you're talking about them like they're

2196
02:08:33,941 --> 02:08:38,380
human garbage. Yeah. Udacity. And
no one ever looks it up. Charles C.

2197
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:41,040
Johnson is one of the few guys
who looks it up and goes, you,

2198
02:08:41,041 --> 02:08:42,850
you weren't fucking there.
You never worked for AP.

2199
02:08:43,810 --> 02:08:46,150
I don't know anything about
that, so I can't comment. Well,

2200
02:08:46,151 --> 02:08:49,210
when I hired him as a salesman in a,
after we started the magazine,

2201
02:08:49,211 --> 02:08:52,650
I never thought I'd be talking about him
as a journalist because he never seemed

2202
02:08:52,651 --> 02:08:55,270
to have any kind of interest
in it whatsoever. But well,

2203
02:08:55,271 --> 02:08:59,050
his videos of him going to
all these different places
are fucking extraordinary.

2204
02:08:59,050 --> 02:09:01,530
He got admit that I've never
seen him. Really? Yeah.

2205
02:09:01,570 --> 02:09:03,680
You should watch them and then
maybe comment. Okay. Yeah,

2206
02:09:03,681 --> 02:09:07,630
that and as far as he goes, I can't
say anything about him post. Oh wait,

2207
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:11,320
cause I've never seen anything
he's done or any problem was,

2208
02:09:11,321 --> 02:09:14,290
everything that I've seen
is post oh nine okay.

2209
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:17,740
Everything I saw was post
me starting this podcast,

2210
02:09:17,741 --> 02:09:20,860
so we're not contradicting each
other here. Yeah, yeah. I don't know.

2211
02:09:21,130 --> 02:09:25,230
I don't know what he said before,
what he's saying now, but I said this,

2212
02:09:25,330 --> 02:09:27,070
this is how we sum up most splits.

2213
02:09:27,071 --> 02:09:30,760
Like I was talking to Jill Abramson
from the New York Times, you know her,

2214
02:09:30,761 --> 02:09:35,440
she was executive, I knew her name. Sure
she was ousted. But uh, how dare they,

2215
02:09:35,530 --> 02:09:37,960
I go, it comes down to beers, right?

2216
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:41,530
Like you weren't going out for beers
with Pinch Arthur Sulzberger the,

2217
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:44,830
the head of the New York Times
and she goes, yeah, basically.

2218
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:48,820
I mean that's what all these splits come
down to is we stopped liking each other.

2219
02:09:48,821 --> 02:09:50,470
We didn't go for beers anymore.
Opie and Anthony,

2220
02:09:50,750 --> 02:09:52,120
we're going to have his stuff anymore.
Friends.

2221
02:09:52,180 --> 02:09:53,560
That's what's so great about the Japanese.

2222
02:09:53,561 --> 02:09:57,250
They insist on beers and when you have
beers with someone that you work with,

2223
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:00,190
you and the Super Hot Honk,
uh,

2224
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:04,030
you establish that you're both human
beings and that though you disagree.

2225
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:07,390
I hate when BLTs aren't
toasted too and it just,

2226
02:10:07,391 --> 02:10:10,720
it's like a reboot of
the humanity of people.

2227
02:10:10,730 --> 02:10:13,210
Emre I had doubled my wife and kids,
you know,

2228
02:10:13,330 --> 02:10:17,490
they didn't and we stopped hanging out
and then any excuse was a reason to,

2229
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:18,733
to split.

2230
02:10:20,650 --> 02:10:24,220
So you agree to disagree on what?
On that?

2231
02:10:25,450 --> 02:10:29,560
No, it was a horrible divorce. It was
lawyers and tons of horrible shit.

2232
02:10:29,590 --> 02:10:32,380
But I'm saying that was the
impetus is it's that simple.

2233
02:10:32,381 --> 02:10:35,960
It's not like there's some sort of big
secret like I fucked his girlfriend.

2234
02:10:35,961 --> 02:10:39,650
Or do you wish that you
were still involved in that
because you started it and

2235
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:44,440
now you see it grow and it's on Hbo and
it's this huge fucking thing on mine.

2236
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:49,500
It's massive. The only way I could,
I always ran 100% of the content. Uh,

2237
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:53,000
I was the boss of that and they did
sales. So how, how did it happen?

2238
02:10:53,001 --> 02:10:57,020
That chain became the boss? Well, as
we grew bigger, we were doing mergers.

2239
02:10:57,021 --> 02:10:58,130
And I think,
you know,

2240
02:10:58,180 --> 02:11:02,180
your salesman has power because he's
bringing in the money so that salesman can

2241
02:11:02,181 --> 02:11:06,710
start exercising that power,
uh, if he wants. And so,

2242
02:11:07,070 --> 02:11:10,730
you know, he, when he said, fuck you, all
of a sudden it had this big influence.

2243
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:14,600
And when I said, fuck you back,
it became lawyer things. But, uh,

2244
02:11:14,870 --> 02:11:15,920
for me to still be there,

2245
02:11:15,921 --> 02:11:19,940
I would have to be subservient to
my previous employees in a sense,

2246
02:11:19,941 --> 02:11:21,800
like my salesman,
my herb Tarlek,

2247
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:26,350
it'd be Johnny fever asking herb Tarlek
if he could play a song reference that

2248
02:11:26,351 --> 02:11:30,410
I'm, I've come struggling to keep up
with. I kind of remember Johnny fever,

2249
02:11:30,411 --> 02:11:32,450
but herb was the guy of sales guy.
Okay.

2250
02:11:32,451 --> 02:11:36,140
I remember her garlic and Les Nessman
have taken over w Keroppi and you're

2251
02:11:36,141 --> 02:11:39,860
saying to Johnny fever, would he like
to come back to wk RP you Johnny fever?

2252
02:11:39,950 --> 02:11:44,270
Yeah. Who else am I going to
be? Bailey. Maybe the chick.

2253
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:48,020
Was it Loni Anderson?
Yeah. Loni and Bailey.

2254
02:11:49,370 --> 02:11:51,480
I was the chick.
I was the secretary of place.

2255
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:54,790
But vice is a totally different
animal now, right? I mean,

2256
02:11:54,791 --> 02:11:57,620
it's just massive multimedia conglomerate.

2257
02:11:59,030 --> 02:12:02,480
I don't know anything about it.
I F I s that's gotta be so weird.

2258
02:12:02,481 --> 02:12:06,530
It's a house of cards. Uh, but
you name it, I don't know. Yeah.

2259
02:12:06,531 --> 02:12:11,420
We were called Voice of Montreal. Suroosh
named it. Les Nessman named it. And,

2260
02:12:11,421 --> 02:12:12,254
uh,

2261
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:17,470
it was a tax scam that
these black Haitians were
running and they just kept us

2262
02:12:17,530 --> 02:12:18,291
as a golden goose,

2263
02:12:18,291 --> 02:12:20,840
pretended it was his multicultural
paper and they got their money.

2264
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:24,510
And then we realized, I think
after I hired Shane that, uh,

2265
02:12:25,250 --> 02:12:30,250
they don't want us to generate income
because they just need us to be this tiny

2266
02:12:31,311 --> 02:12:33,710
little bubble that they get
paid to promote. You know,

2267
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:37,150
there's all this money in Canada to
promote multiculturalism and them, right.

2268
02:12:37,310 --> 02:12:38,870
So we,
we're a multicultural paper,

2269
02:12:38,871 --> 02:12:40,610
but we wrote about
skateboarding and punk bands,

2270
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:43,900
just people are just paying the
money. Yeah. Never read the,

2271
02:12:44,270 --> 02:12:47,210
it was a newsprint tablet.
And so how did it become what it is now?

2272
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:49,610
So we left and to avoid litigation,
I said,

2273
02:12:49,611 --> 02:12:53,900
let's just change the name device
from voice. Right. And, uh,

2274
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:58,190
then we made up this lie where we said
the village voice in New York threatened

2275
02:12:58,191 --> 02:12:59,024
to sue us.

2276
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:04,510
So we had to change the name to survive
and Canadians fucking salivate over any

2277
02:13:05,151 --> 02:13:09,680
David and Goliath story involving America.
So it was in everything.

2278
02:13:09,681 --> 02:13:12,800
It was in all the magazines,
all the papers, coast to coast,

2279
02:13:12,930 --> 02:13:17,870
America's bullying Canada again. And
no one looked it up and after you left,

2280
02:13:17,871 --> 02:13:21,380
so this is 2006, that's when it took
off. You had to be like, what the fuck?

2281
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:23,560
I left to know eight,
uh Oh he left.

2282
02:13:23,570 --> 02:13:25,400
No eight things started
getting rocky and I was six.

2283
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:28,850
We have the salesmen takes over a company,
it's going to become more profitable.

2284
02:13:29,150 --> 02:13:32,520
I mean, my, my sort of not just
model hospitable but bigger. I mean,

2285
02:13:32,521 --> 02:13:37,120
not just profitable, but the, the
reach like what it's accomplished.

2286
02:13:37,130 --> 02:13:41,730
The stories is sucking off a dude. Like
she's, she's, she's doing really good job.

2287
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:45,420
That's what I'm trying to get to that
woody Allen movie and husbands and wives

2288
02:13:45,421 --> 02:13:49,260
when they go, I saw your ex wife, she
was with Liam Neeson. She looked great.

2289
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:53,940
Is that when you found
Jesus? Uh, let me see. No,

2290
02:13:54,210 --> 02:13:57,120
I found Jesus and no. Five. Oh,

2291
02:13:57,360 --> 02:14:01,950
any coincidence that that's when shit
started to go bad at 12 months later? No,

2292
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:06,980
I mean, I've never been very public
about my religion and Right Day ism I,

2293
02:14:07,180 --> 02:14:09,180
I don't even know how it
came up in this podcast.

2294
02:14:09,181 --> 02:14:12,300
I honestly get uncomfortable when it
comes up because I feel like we're talking

2295
02:14:12,301 --> 02:14:13,500
about my for skin or something.

2296
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:16,580
I'd actually really comfortable
talking about my foreskin. Yeah.

2297
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:18,460
What I was saying. You feel like
you're talking about your forces.

2298
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:22,080
I talk about my wife's asshole talking
about religion is like talking about my

2299
02:14:22,081 --> 02:14:24,510
wife's ass. Interesting. Yeah. Hmm. So,

2300
02:14:24,511 --> 02:14:27,420
but now when you see vice on Hbo,

2301
02:14:27,421 --> 02:14:30,180
do you have to like flip the
channels or do you watch it? Uh,

2302
02:14:30,181 --> 02:14:32,250
I've never watched it.
It doesn't come up.

2303
02:14:32,251 --> 02:14:36,660
I think it has come up once in a while
when I'm scrolling and I just keep

2304
02:14:36,661 --> 02:14:39,080
scrolling. Do you, do
you have a feeling like,

2305
02:14:39,081 --> 02:14:42,240
like seeing a photo of an old girlfriend
name? I don't like those guys.

2306
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:47,010
So you know, it's like an x band. Right,
right, right, right. I don't enjoy it.

2307
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:49,710
I'm not enjoying this actually. You're
not enjoying this show. Well, no, no.

2308
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:52,530
This show is great. But this topic.
Okay, we don't have to talk about this.

2309
02:14:52,770 --> 02:14:55,230
I love Anthony.
Anthony's fucking awesome.

2310
02:14:55,231 --> 02:14:57,600
I think he's a national treasure
is such a freak. Great Guy.

2311
02:14:57,601 --> 02:14:59,870
But you know what he has
in common with David, uh,

2312
02:14:59,910 --> 02:15:03,060
is 50 year olds are kind of done.

2313
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:07,680
Like they have their shit that they
like to say David David Cross. Oh, okay.

2314
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:09,450
They have their shit they like,

2315
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:13,410
and they're not looking for buddies and
they don't want nuggies and they don't

2316
02:15:13,411 --> 02:15:18,180
want to look. He's a Wedgie.
You know? Like I like, I'm a
buddy guy. Right. Thank you.

2317
02:15:18,181 --> 02:15:22,620
Farther than you didn't say safety. Right.
I said, slut, I get to slap you. Uh,

2318
02:15:23,250 --> 02:15:26,370
so with Anthony, I'm like, all right,
we're part of the navy bodies now.

2319
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:30,240
Fucking Canadians. Uh, let's be buddies.
And he's like, no, I'm an old dude.

2320
02:15:30,241 --> 02:15:34,200
I like watching Fox and, uh, play with my
cat. So he doesn't like to do anything.

2321
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:35,760
He's not as,

2322
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:40,100
I don't know why I thought we'd become
best friends after I joined the navy.

2323
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:43,890
We're hoping. Yeah, that's what you wanted
to join for. You wanted a bestie. Yes.

2324
02:15:44,100 --> 02:15:47,340
And it's saying, I did Adam Carolla
show and same thing after I was like,

2325
02:15:47,341 --> 02:15:49,590
all right, so we're getting wiener
dogs or what's the deal here?

2326
02:15:49,710 --> 02:15:52,200
And he's just like bye and walks out of
the room. And I'm like, wait a minute,

2327
02:15:52,250 --> 02:15:55,200
I will never get to be best.
Nobody gets to be besties with Adam.

2328
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:58,980
Adam's got his own little group going on.
He doesn't want to hang.

2329
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:03,570
Well he has 50 different projects
going on simultaneously all the time.

2330
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:07,200
You know that Chi has TV shows,
he's got fucking,

2331
02:16:07,201 --> 02:16:10,540
who knows how many God damn
podcasts he runs simultaneously.

2332
02:16:10,541 --> 02:16:13,200
He's always racing cars and
he doesn't have any time. No,

2333
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:17,310
but 50 year olds have established that 50
year olds get to a point where they go,

2334
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:22,290
uh, I wanted to have 50 shows
and a racing car and I'm good.

2335
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:25,190
And then you show up and go, are
we best friends yet? And felt like,

2336
02:16:25,470 --> 02:16:27,660
can someone get him out?
He's so you really,

2337
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:29,530
you really need to make
friends at the church.

2338
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:32,810
Isn't that like part of like
what's good about church?

2339
02:16:32,811 --> 02:16:36,640
Every time I've been to church, um, the
people around me are losers. That's weird.

2340
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:41,680
I wonder if to think the same old ladies,
incredibly obese, hideous people. Why?

2341
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:46,120
Because they're desperate and they're
looking for some sort of liberals. I mean,

2342
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:50,500
that's the reason most comedians are
liberal because liberals don't have rules.

2343
02:16:50,501 --> 02:16:54,190
They're like, I'll take anything.
So all artists artists are liberal.

2344
02:16:54,490 --> 02:16:56,260
What do you mean then I'll have roles.
Well,

2345
02:16:56,261 --> 02:17:01,250
like think of how Liberals
and Conservatives see
painting conservatives go,

2346
02:17:01,251 --> 02:17:03,460
can you draw a hand?
Does it look realistic?

2347
02:17:03,580 --> 02:17:06,640
Liberals are like put a Tampon
in a teacup. You get an a plus.

2348
02:17:06,850 --> 02:17:11,830
So creative people tend to be left
because the less crime take you Robert.

2349
02:17:11,831 --> 02:17:16,300
Maplethorpe yeah. Um, so that's,

2350
02:17:16,360 --> 02:17:19,540
that's hilarious. Well, it confuse
me for a long time because I thought,

2351
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:24,010
why are so many comedians liberal?
They're analytical people by nature.

2352
02:17:24,011 --> 02:17:27,760
They investigate shit.
Yet they're all pro Bernie Sanders.

2353
02:17:27,970 --> 02:17:29,050
He wants to take your money away.

2354
02:17:29,051 --> 02:17:32,620
Didn't you look up how much money
rich people have and what the debt is?

2355
02:17:32,650 --> 02:17:35,920
I think they're trying to find an
alternative to what they think is a broken

2356
02:17:35,921 --> 02:17:38,910
system. And they don't really
investigate it deeply enough to,

2357
02:17:38,911 --> 02:17:41,170
to realize that what
Bernie Sanders is saying,

2358
02:17:41,171 --> 02:17:45,520
like financially doesn't seem
to be possible. Like I don't,

2359
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:49,570
I don't think I've seen anybody
say that the numbers jive. Yeah.

2360
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:50,680
But they don't look up the numbers.

2361
02:17:50,681 --> 02:17:53,230
And I like someone was saying
to me about you, they go,

2362
02:17:53,231 --> 02:17:57,640
he's like a smart dumb guy. And I
go, Huh. He know he's a curious guy.

2363
02:17:57,730 --> 02:18:00,010
And that's what interesting people are.
They're curious.

2364
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:04,130
And most comedians are curious
people. SMART, curious.

2365
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:07,870
You'll look at this, I'm going to
seal off. Good. It's weird. It's,

2366
02:18:08,110 --> 02:18:12,610
does it make sense? Maybe it means mind
elaborate subjects in a blue collar way.

2367
02:18:13,180 --> 02:18:14,980
Okay. But, uh,

2368
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:18,460
I don't get how people can be comedians,

2369
02:18:18,670 --> 02:18:22,480
which means curious and
not have looked shit up.

2370
02:18:24,070 --> 02:18:27,580
You could drain Warren Buffett and Bill
Gates and all those guys. Bank account.

2371
02:18:27,790 --> 02:18:32,080
It doesn't take a pube out of 18 trillion.
How have you not googled that?

2372
02:18:32,081 --> 02:18:34,200
You fuck heads. Well, not
only, and it not take a pee.

2373
02:18:34,270 --> 02:18:39,270
Like I think if you tax every
single person in this country,

2374
02:18:40,420 --> 02:18:42,700
um,
that makes $1 million.

2375
02:18:42,730 --> 02:18:47,080
If you tax them 100% you
don't even come close,

2376
02:18:47,350 --> 02:18:48,400
right?
Yeah.

2377
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:52,150
Every single person like you would
take all of their money that they make.

2378
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:53,380
It doesn't come close.

2379
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:58,300
This is why I don't like arguing with
liberals and I prefer focusing on my

2380
02:18:58,301 --> 02:19:00,850
disagreements with people on the right
cause at least they've done their fucking

2381
02:19:00,851 --> 02:19:04,450
homework. Well, I just say I don't
like rigid ideologies. Like I said,

2382
02:19:04,451 --> 02:19:07,060
I don't like the idea of
a liberal or conservative.

2383
02:19:07,061 --> 02:19:12,030
I'd say I think people lock themselves
into these ideas. And then this is as a,

2384
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:13,840
like I said about my
friend who was a Democrat,

2385
02:19:13,841 --> 02:19:16,600
like we've got a win if we win
the sand. Like what, what is this?

2386
02:19:16,780 --> 02:19:20,940
What are you saying? I go, what's this?
We year you are in, you know, you're,

2387
02:19:21,060 --> 02:19:24,540
you're rooting for the Raiders.
Right? Know there really
is what it is. But if you,

2388
02:19:24,541 --> 02:19:28,310
if you say no conservative, uh,
we're a nation of immigrants

2389
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:31,250
or something like that, some sort of
cliche thing, they've already heard it.

2390
02:19:31,251 --> 02:19:35,640
So many times they go, actually, uh,
we're a nation of citizens. And uh,

2391
02:19:35,730 --> 02:19:38,480
the borders were open in 65.
Listen to what you just said.

2392
02:19:38,481 --> 02:19:41,750
If you say that to a liberal, it's
this. If you say I had to conservative,

2393
02:19:41,930 --> 02:19:46,550
they do this. That's not my experience
with the left. They say things like, uh,

2394
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:49,190
well like you and Greg, you
go, teachers don't make enough.

2395
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:51,830
You hadn't looked up how much
teachers make. They don't make enough.

2396
02:19:51,831 --> 02:19:54,860
It's still not enough money.
60 bucks an hour isn't enough money.

2397
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:58,160
We agreed that it should be private
because I think that when you have things

2398
02:19:58,161 --> 02:20:00,830
private and you can make
people fired and you know,

2399
02:20:00,831 --> 02:20:04,190
you give contracts to companies
that are competitive, you,

2400
02:20:04,210 --> 02:20:07,820
you got a better product. Right. I think
capitalism does work in a lot of ways.

2401
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:11,090
Charter schools are great and charter
schools make less charter school teachers

2402
02:20:11,091 --> 02:20:14,000
make less than public school teachers
and they're kicking ass and they get

2403
02:20:14,001 --> 02:20:18,740
fucking three months off a year.
They go home at three 20. You know,

2404
02:20:18,741 --> 02:20:22,940
board. You'd be if you work that
little, I would be, I would look,

2405
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:26,600
if I got off work at three 20 that would
mean I'd have to go there at seven.

2406
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:30,620
I'd be fucking tired and I would be,
I would be looking for a nap,

2407
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:31,640
easiest job in the world.

2408
02:20:31,641 --> 02:20:34,940
But my point is I don't know that I
find with the left when I bring up shit,

2409
02:20:34,941 --> 02:20:36,410
they have never looked it up.
Like you say to them,

2410
02:20:36,411 --> 02:20:39,240
how many illegals are in the country?
They have no idea. You say, uh,

2411
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:40,310
education needs more funding.

2412
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:44,360
How much does each student get as far as
how much we spend and what goes to them?

2413
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:46,580
The answer is about 12 grand.
About a thousand bucks a month.

2414
02:20:46,730 --> 02:20:50,360
They never have any idea. They always
say, uh, it's not enough. Whatever it is.

2415
02:20:50,361 --> 02:20:52,430
Or with immigration, I go, how
many immigrants can be taken?

2416
02:20:52,431 --> 02:20:55,190
And they go more than we have now.
And you go, there's 30 million,

2417
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:59,270
what's a good number? 100 million.
And they go more. And I'm like,

2418
02:20:59,271 --> 02:21:03,470
you fucking hate math.
That's why you're a liberal.

2419
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:07,070
You just like the idea. You're basically
a woman you like. I'm not saying you,

2420
02:21:07,071 --> 02:21:10,010
I mean liberals in general.
They just like the sentimentality.

2421
02:21:10,011 --> 02:21:14,060
Like I this we're immigrants by
a nice to Mexican male liberal.

2422
02:21:14,750 --> 02:21:19,700
No, I don't think so. What am I? I
think you're mostly a libertarian. Yeah,

2423
02:21:19,701 --> 02:21:23,960
I would probably say that
I'm a libertarian for
everything but open borders.

2424
02:21:23,961 --> 02:21:27,110
I don't understand why they
want open borders. Well,

2425
02:21:28,010 --> 02:21:31,670
because we feel like the people in
the other countries got a shitty deal.

2426
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:35,180
They got a bad roll the dice and they're
stuck in this really roll the dice

2427
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:39,470
evolution as a roll.
The dice evolution from Mexico,

2428
02:21:39,590 --> 02:21:41,480
Mexico sucks cause of Mexicans.

2429
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:45,500
What have they contributed to
society in the past hundred years?

2430
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:50,150
Exact Ito's that's what Paul J.
Fox said when he was challenged.

2431
02:21:50,151 --> 02:21:53,480
He gave us a Mexican innovation from
the past hundred years and he goes,

2432
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:57,860
the TACO delicious food.
He's got a point. Yes, it is.

2433
02:21:57,910 --> 02:22:01,310
How about Sombreros? Notice in
California when I bring up Mexico,

2434
02:22:01,550 --> 02:22:03,710
people get uncomfortable
because it's like Mexicans.

2435
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:06,470
I love Mexicans and the Mexicans we have,
by the way,

2436
02:22:06,471 --> 02:22:11,030
it's power are the funny ones.
Northern Mexico, you know,

2437
02:22:11,031 --> 02:22:12,260
different regions have
their different things.

2438
02:22:12,261 --> 02:22:16,040
Like in Britain the Scots are known as
funny for some reason northerners or was

2439
02:22:16,041 --> 02:22:17,810
funnier. Maybe it's colder. Yeah.

2440
02:22:17,811 --> 02:22:20,540
They have to have a sense of humor
cause it's fucking freezing. Yeah.

2441
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:25,680
So we get the best as far as cool guys
to hang out with. And I love my movie,

2442
02:22:25,681 --> 02:22:30,060
how to be a man, did incredibly well
with Hispanics. More than this. What is,

2443
02:22:30,061 --> 02:22:32,490
I don't know, I'm not even aware of this.
Oh, I did a movie called how to be a man.

2444
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:36,360
What was it? It was a comedy about
a guy who's dying a fiction. Yes.

2445
02:22:36,570 --> 02:22:39,150
And he's recording videos
for his unborn son.

2446
02:22:39,300 --> 02:22:44,250
So after he dies the kid can watch the
videos and uh Huh. Learn from that,

2447
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:46,290
which we stole from the
Michael Keaton movie,

2448
02:22:46,291 --> 02:22:49,100
which we mentioned in
the film at the time. Uh,

2449
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:51,150
and I just assumed it would
do well with hipsters.

2450
02:22:51,151 --> 02:22:54,030
Then we've got the demo back and it was
like all Hispanics cause they're the

2451
02:22:54,031 --> 02:22:55,260
only ones into how to be a man.

2452
02:22:55,890 --> 02:23:00,690
Most millennials think it's a bad
thing to be a man. But anyway,

2453
02:23:00,691 --> 02:23:04,920
so I love Mexicans. Right? But we
just don't want, come on over here.

2454
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:08,120
We have immigration work now
as a fucking disgusting man.

2455
02:23:08,130 --> 02:23:12,540
It's funny you say that because you're
an immigrant. Yeah. I took 10 years,

2456
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:17,250
10,000 bucks, brought a heap load
of jobs and I got punished for it.

2457
02:23:17,730 --> 02:23:21,630
How'd you get punished?
I was charged 10 granted to be 10 years,

2458
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:24,960
but that doesn't seem like punishment.
That seems like fucking citizenship.

2459
02:23:24,961 --> 02:23:29,760
I'm another 650 bucks away in a bullshit
test. About what color is the flag?

2460
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:31,290
Why do you want to be an American citizen?

2461
02:23:31,291 --> 02:23:33,330
You don't want to be as citizens
of your names right now.

2462
02:23:33,331 --> 02:23:36,390
If I drunk drive or do something bad,
it could fuck up my green card and

2463
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:37,420
okay.

2464
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:39,910
Shit like that. Oh, so you
want to be able to drunk drive,

2465
02:23:39,970 --> 02:23:42,820
so that's why you want an American
citizenship. Uh, that's not why,

2466
02:23:42,821 --> 02:23:46,810
but I do thoroughly enjoy drunk
driving. I think it's a really, yeah.

2467
02:23:47,710 --> 02:23:47,910
Okay.

2468
02:23:47,910 --> 02:23:52,290
Do you drive drunk? No, it's the best.
It's like playing a video game. Oh,

2469
02:23:52,291 --> 02:23:57,260
come on man. You don't mean Blah blackout,
but seven beers. That's a fun time.

2470
02:23:57,290 --> 02:24:00,210
God Damn Dude, that's really
drunk. Like you're, you're,

2471
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:02,850
you're fucking reaction times terrible.
Something happens.

2472
02:24:02,851 --> 02:24:06,750
You could slam right into things.
No. Drunk driving is a myth. Wow.

2473
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:09,690
What do you mean it's a myth?
What does that mean? I mean,

2474
02:24:10,590 --> 02:24:14,370
the world wouldn't be better
if the world wouldn't change.

2475
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:19,230
If it was made legal
people would not,

2476
02:24:19,650 --> 02:24:23,880
people don't jeopardize their own safety.
It's, you know, in America, in New York,

2477
02:24:23,881 --> 02:24:27,240
sorry. Uh, it's illegal
to drive after two beers.

2478
02:24:27,630 --> 02:24:31,320
You shouldn't be commanding a vehicle
if you can't handle it on two beers.

2479
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:36,210
Two Beers right now. Yeah. It's, Oh,
what is it? Oh eight or o nine o nine.

2480
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:38,520
Yeah.
Well that I think is low,

2481
02:24:38,521 --> 02:24:42,300
but I think that's also a revenue
collecting device. Totally. You know,

2482
02:24:42,301 --> 02:24:43,290
I think recycling,

2483
02:24:43,380 --> 02:24:48,210
I think if you could do a test of people's
coordination and after two beers you

2484
02:24:48,211 --> 02:24:52,200
would find it's really not much different
than being sober, but seven beers,

2485
02:24:52,530 --> 02:24:56,580
big fucking difference. Driving is simple.
Think of how we drive is not simple.

2486
02:24:56,581 --> 02:24:59,430
If something goes wrong and you have to
make a split second decision and your

2487
02:24:59,431 --> 02:25:00,600
reaction time is fucked up,

2488
02:25:00,601 --> 02:25:04,620
so a collision occurs that wouldn't
have occurred if you weren't drunk.

2489
02:25:04,770 --> 02:25:07,070
That's where it becomes a problem
and super anti drunk driving.

2490
02:25:07,071 --> 02:25:09,630
If the shit hits the fan,
if the shit hits the fan,

2491
02:25:09,631 --> 02:25:13,110
you can't keep it together as much fan,
if something happens in front of you,

2492
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:17,580
a DRM on your brakes, a deer, a
person, someone makes a mistake,

2493
02:25:17,581 --> 02:25:21,300
someone goes into your lane, you could
cause a collision because you're drunk,

2494
02:25:21,301 --> 02:25:24,070
where you would avoid it if
you were sober. That's a fact.

2495
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:28,090
People are jumping out on the highway
now on the scenario is cars making a

2496
02:25:28,091 --> 02:25:31,630
mistake? Someone coming into your realm
in your lane ball, you bonked. No,

2497
02:25:31,631 --> 02:25:35,260
you don't Bonk, you collide and
people die. It happens all the time.

2498
02:25:35,650 --> 02:25:38,950
Car Accidents on the highway or fucking
deadly people happen all the time.

2499
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:42,600
You can accidentally, like Caitlyn Jenner
did push someone into fucking traffic.

2500
02:25:42,660 --> 02:25:46,870
They get his head on. Texting is way more.
He wasn't texting, he just spaced out.

2501
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,410
She was texting. Why is he here?
He was he then, why did he say,

2502
02:25:50,710 --> 02:25:55,120
I think you already had fake tits. He
was a, or at least take a bull dyke.

2503
02:25:55,121 --> 02:25:59,200
Then he had a sweatshirt on and he
was like, they had that big face,

2504
02:25:59,201 --> 02:26:02,520
the big man face before he turned into
a texting. I can't remember. I saw,

2505
02:26:02,530 --> 02:26:04,570
I don't think he was,
I don't think that's ever been proven.

2506
02:26:04,570 --> 02:26:07,630
I think that was the part of the
investigation they found out and my main

2507
02:26:07,631 --> 02:26:12,220
platform when he ran for president.
But I think drunk driving is not an issue.

2508
02:26:12,221 --> 02:26:15,940
I thoroughly enjoy it. I mean I've, Roger
Avery killed somebody drunk driving.

2509
02:26:16,330 --> 02:26:17,163
Okay.

2510
02:26:17,410 --> 02:26:20,710
The guy who wrote pulp fiction with
Quentin Tarantino hundreds of right now.

2511
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:24,220
But think of how many cars are
going opposite directions. Right?

2512
02:26:24,490 --> 02:26:26,950
And we only have what?
40,000 deaths a year.

2513
02:26:27,130 --> 02:26:30,820
But don't you think that people like
are less likely to drunk drive because

2514
02:26:30,821 --> 02:26:33,450
they're terrified of losing their
license? That terrified. Yeah,

2515
02:26:33,490 --> 02:26:36,910
so they do it less and less fun.
That's why La is less fun. Fun.

2516
02:26:37,070 --> 02:26:39,490
La is not fun because people don't drink.

2517
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:42,400
I'm talking to you because I don't know
when you're fucking around and when

2518
02:26:42,401 --> 02:26:45,550
you're, when you're
being serious. La Sucks.

2519
02:26:45,551 --> 02:26:47,230
I fucking hate this
city with a passionate,

2520
02:26:47,231 --> 02:26:49,960
you're doing it when is
sort of under here. Silly.

2521
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:53,470
Ours don't open at any given time and
everyone's petrified of drunk driving so

2522
02:26:53,471 --> 02:26:56,200
they don't even drink when they go
out. People go, no, they do drink.

2523
02:26:56,201 --> 02:26:59,410
They get Uber's. Uber's are
everywhere now. Recent. Yeah,

2524
02:26:59,411 --> 02:27:03,720
but that's what they do know.
Okay, well I can't wait to post,

2525
02:27:04,450 --> 02:27:06,790
but we're,
we're going back like three years now.

2526
02:27:07,270 --> 02:27:09,760
I'm talking about La really only
since I've been coming here,

2527
02:27:09,761 --> 02:27:13,600
which is Uber things like one and a
half maybe like we're really pumping.

2528
02:27:13,690 --> 02:27:16,720
Adopted it.
Maybe la is getting better since Uber.

2529
02:27:16,990 --> 02:27:21,820
Dla I know is fucking shittily
dressed squares. What about you?

2530
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:26,680
You think that's a good time?
Yeah, I'll kill you at that tie.

2531
02:27:27,190 --> 02:27:30,250
That's probably the problem with that tie.
If you got you and I,

2532
02:27:30,280 --> 02:27:34,960
that's when I got here. Officer
altercation. Got An altercation,

2533
02:27:35,010 --> 02:27:38,440
I would kill you with their tie. Do you
know that? That it's not good for combat.

2534
02:27:38,470 --> 02:27:41,440
It's not a good combo. Terrible.
But as you have the leash,

2535
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:43,680
the leash around your neck,
and I control you what that means,

2536
02:27:43,710 --> 02:27:45,070
sharing it into the cage match.

2537
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:47,620
I could get my hands underneath
that day and I twist.

2538
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:51,310
So you're think I'm criticizing
your town? No, I'm not.

2539
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:56,240
Look here. You mess. Go to New York and
go. Holy Fuck. No, that's ridiculous.

2540
02:27:56,290 --> 02:27:57,240
Disneyland don't fun.

2541
02:27:57,310 --> 02:27:59,830
I don't think it's a good idea to have
that many people jammed into a place,

2542
02:27:59,831 --> 02:28:02,100
whether it's here or there.
I don't like it when I left.

2543
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:07,120
We don't have that problem here. You
have their person, sidewalk, Empty Cup,

2544
02:28:07,150 --> 02:28:11,350
uh, fucking tumbleweed
person. Fucking abandoned.

2545
02:28:12,180 --> 02:28:16,300
Look at palm trees. They're not even
wood. That's not a tree. No, it's not.

2546
02:28:16,301 --> 02:28:19,430
It's plant hideous. Plan.
Why is it not a treat?

2547
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:22,190
Why is it not a tree you can't
get wood from? It's right. It's

2548
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:27,190
got dead leaves hanging off and you
go to like a carpet store and in West

2549
02:28:27,830 --> 02:28:31,400
Hollywood and you go, oh, this must be
abandoned. The paint is chipping off.

2550
02:28:31,430 --> 02:28:34,610
No one likes this place. No, it's
open. It's actually super expensive.

2551
02:28:35,550 --> 02:28:37,370
You can't even park your fucking car.

2552
02:28:37,371 --> 02:28:40,910
They have these so you don't need a
house of car. You take the subway.

2553
02:28:40,970 --> 02:28:44,940
I am an American and I enjoy autopay.
Then take your car.

2554
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:50,990
You're only fucking 30
minutes from awesome forests
and fucking shooting bears.

2555
02:28:51,860 --> 02:28:53,960
You mean over there? Up there? Well,

2556
02:28:53,961 --> 02:28:57,350
I shot an elk an hour and a
half away from here. Okay,

2557
02:28:57,860 --> 02:29:02,330
well that's pretty much earth, earth
and the hour and a half away from elk.

2558
02:29:02,630 --> 02:29:04,640
This may,
I mean maybe not Europe,

2559
02:29:04,850 --> 02:29:07,670
but as far as you know
where you would want a hunt,

2560
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:09,320
you're usually an hour and
a half away from nature.

2561
02:29:11,360 --> 02:29:15,440
Do you honestly think La Sucks?
No, I don't think La is ideal,

2562
02:29:15,441 --> 02:29:16,970
but I think la has a lot of great things.

2563
02:29:16,971 --> 02:29:20,330
I think the real problem
is overpopulation. I think
whenever you have too many,

2564
02:29:20,460 --> 02:29:23,330
you know all the time.
Notice, sorry, San Diego Man.

2565
02:29:23,331 --> 02:29:26,300
I worked in San Diego last night
and we drove down to San Diego.

2566
02:29:26,301 --> 02:29:29,810
We had to leave at 1230 and it took us,

2567
02:29:29,811 --> 02:29:33,440
it only took us three hours to get
there, which is pretty good. I mean,

2568
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:36,830
it's really a two hour drive with
an hour of traffic. That's not bad.

2569
02:29:37,070 --> 02:29:41,450
But the last hour was all San
Diego traffic and I was like, wow,

2570
02:29:41,451 --> 02:29:44,450
this is crazy different than
it used to be a few years ago.

2571
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:49,490
It's gotten a lot worse. San Diego fucking
reeks. I don't mean stinks literally,

2572
02:29:49,491 --> 02:29:53,180
but figuratively reeks way
worse in La and a lot of bumps.

2573
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:57,260
I think skateboarding is illegal
there. That's a Shitty, it is.

2574
02:29:57,290 --> 02:29:59,000
What's a very conservative city.
Yeah.

2575
02:29:59,110 --> 02:30:02,600
San Diego is there and it's like they're
telling me that they suck black guy's

2576
02:30:02,601 --> 02:30:06,510
dicks on the weekends. I like, I go,
what? It's a conservative town. You know,

2577
02:30:06,530 --> 02:30:09,940
it's a lot of, a lot of military
people, a lot of bay, you know, it's,

2578
02:30:09,950 --> 02:30:14,510
the base is there. Here's the best cities
in the world. Who trekked? What's that?

2579
02:30:14,630 --> 02:30:18,620
It's near Amsterdam. Amsterdam
without the jocks. Oh, okay. Uh,

2580
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:23,030
Barcelona. Barcelona is pretty
awesome. My friend Chris Ryan, just,

2581
02:30:23,031 --> 02:30:27,950
he's moving back there. Paris,
Paris, New York City, Montreal.

2582
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:33,110
Um, so when you're in New York City, do
you take cabs? Do you to take the subway,

2583
02:30:33,111 --> 02:30:38,060
subway everywhere? Yeah. Now, full
disclosure, you say you don't know what,

2584
02:30:38,061 --> 02:30:39,080
I'm kidding,
but I'm serious.

2585
02:30:39,380 --> 02:30:43,510
I'm Kinda being pre 2015 gav

2586
02:30:45,070 --> 02:30:48,980
at 45 with three kids in New
York's been there 15 years,

2587
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:54,110
to be totally honest is kills my argument,
but it is wearing on me a little bit.

2588
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:55,280
I appreciate your honesty.

2589
02:30:56,550 --> 02:30:59,840
I don't think there's a reason to have
blind allegiance towards a particular

2590
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:02,670
spot. I did for a long
time, but it was a lot.

2591
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:06,240
Same to rats at once
regularly fucking saying no,

2592
02:31:06,290 --> 02:31:07,730
I'm done with the city to be honest.

2593
02:31:07,790 --> 02:31:10,280
Did you see the video of the
rat killing the pigeon? Oh,

2594
02:31:10,281 --> 02:31:14,390
Anthony had that on his show. Yeah. It
was an amazing unfucking. No, they hunted.

2595
02:31:14,420 --> 02:31:18,980
I didn't, I had no idea of rats
hunted. Rats hunted this pigeon jacked.

2596
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:21,330
I mean it's like fit his neck.
Yeah.

2597
02:31:21,331 --> 02:31:24,570
And chased him like lost him for a bit
and then how to chase him and got him

2598
02:31:24,571 --> 02:31:28,500
again. Like it was crazy
everywhere. Fucking,

2599
02:31:28,501 --> 02:31:33,450
and you know what drives me nuts about
in New York, uh, sorry, pre 2015 Gav,

2600
02:31:34,050 --> 02:31:39,050
these fucking kids dancing on the subway
for money and they're swinging around

2601
02:31:39,601 --> 02:31:42,090
the Poles. You know what this, no,

2602
02:31:42,150 --> 02:31:46,320
they fucking so like you get on
the subway and the subway money,

2603
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:50,200
I'm about to do a show, boom, boom boom.

2604
02:31:50,250 --> 02:31:52,860
And they get out and the shit
they're doing isn't depressive.

2605
02:31:53,190 --> 02:31:56,610
They're swinging around a
pole on the train and you go,

2606
02:31:56,670 --> 02:32:01,230
that's a stripper pole faggot.
You're a not as good as the strippers.

2607
02:32:01,231 --> 02:32:05,460
I usually see you're a loser and
then they'll do shit like though.

2608
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:08,720
So they'll go upside down and slide down
as slowly and you can see the people

2609
02:32:08,740 --> 02:32:10,200
just moved here going,
oh my God.

2610
02:32:10,470 --> 02:32:13,020
And they go go to a strip club and
you'll see way better shit than that.

2611
02:32:13,290 --> 02:32:16,470
And then they do this thing with their
hat where they flip it and plop it on

2612
02:32:16,471 --> 02:32:21,210
their head. Like that's hard, right? Like
if, if we were drinking top path outside,

2613
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:23,910
no baseball hat or the cracks in
their teeth and flip it on their head.

2614
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:28,620
If we were drinking at an outside
bar and you did that, I would go, oh,

2615
02:32:28,670 --> 02:32:33,060
okay. Yeah, it would be. It is annoying.

2616
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:36,210
It's fucking, and I didn't know that
that was going on. Yeah. It's a thing.

2617
02:32:36,330 --> 02:32:39,530
Most people don't know this. You're
educating a lot of folks, right?

2618
02:32:39,540 --> 02:32:42,840
They will kick you in the head
too really well by accident.

2619
02:32:42,841 --> 02:32:44,100
You know when they're spinning around,

2620
02:32:44,390 --> 02:32:48,450
all New Yorkers got those fucking guys
start near me and they fucking touch me.

2621
02:32:48,451 --> 02:32:51,600
They're all going down.
Wow. And it's like seven.

2622
02:32:51,601 --> 02:32:55,560
It's a 10 year old Yorker impression.
It's old school. Irish hell's kitchen guy.

2623
02:32:55,561 --> 02:32:58,920
Hell's kitchen. Yeah. That's the night
Simon. And those guys are fucking,

2624
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:01,530
cause I said when they say
shit like that, I go, yeah.

2625
02:33:01,531 --> 02:33:04,980
But then you're in the New York post
in that little sliver that says,

2626
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:08,190
man in subway stabbed to
death after altercation.

2627
02:33:08,340 --> 02:33:11,130
Well how much violence does go on in the
subways because you always hear about

2628
02:33:11,131 --> 02:33:11,970
the bad incidents,

2629
02:33:11,971 --> 02:33:15,590
but every day millions of people are
going back and forth and back and forth,

2630
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:19,110
back and forth. It's not in New York,
a hunt, there's a murderer a day.

2631
02:33:19,620 --> 02:33:24,090
All East New York, all Bushwick, bloods,
crips, most of the gangs are Hispanic.

2632
02:33:24,110 --> 02:33:28,320
One a day, one a day on
average. That's not, that's more
maybe 400 a year. But yeah.

2633
02:33:28,470 --> 02:33:31,020
Well, West Hollywood only had
one murder this whole year.

2634
02:33:31,140 --> 02:33:35,040
Happened to the comedy store a couple
of nights ago. No Way. Yeah. Yeah.

2635
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:39,720
Who Was it done? Bears. He
killed, killed on stage. No,

2636
02:33:39,721 --> 02:33:41,500
there was a, um, uh,

2637
02:33:41,510 --> 02:33:45,750
a guy who apparently wasn't even a comic
and he was out on the patio and someone

2638
02:33:45,751 --> 02:33:50,340
walked up to him and shot him six times
in front of everybody, you know, maybe,

2639
02:33:50,630 --> 02:33:54,210
uh, brutal debt. Uh, they
think it was gang related.

2640
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:58,590
It's all speculation. Yeah. And it was a,
they had a black comedy night, you know,

2641
02:33:58,770 --> 02:34:00,840
urban in quotes,
urban comedy night,

2642
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:05,040
and they'd had some issues with
gang members there before allegedly,

2643
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:09,540
or we probably made fun of a dude. I don't
think so. He wasn't a comic. Oh yeah.

2644
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:12,540
They think he just was a guy that
they knew he was going to be there.

2645
02:34:13,380 --> 02:34:18,040
Compton culture visiting. Yeah. West
Hollywood. And I was seeing what

2646
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,340
they go through every day probably.
Yeah. Something along those lines.

2647
02:34:21,341 --> 02:34:25,840
But I found it amazing that that was
the only murder in Hollywood for a year,

2648
02:34:26,380 --> 02:34:30,170
wasn't it? All gays in Hollywood,
West Hollywood, that area. Um,

2649
02:34:30,180 --> 02:34:33,490
like below that is very gay.
Not all gays,

2650
02:34:33,491 --> 02:34:36,730
but a lot of straight people move to
those areas because they're super safe

2651
02:34:36,970 --> 02:34:39,630
because we're the gays live. It's like
they take care of everything. Well,

2652
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:43,180
gays are happy because they
get laid a lot. Hmm. That
makes a big difference. See,

2653
02:34:43,181 --> 02:34:47,340
that kills your argument about gays
having a problem. It seems like,

2654
02:34:47,341 --> 02:34:48,460
I never said gates.
I have a problem.

2655
02:34:48,490 --> 02:34:53,410
It's good at like the tiny
contingent of bitchy gaze.

2656
02:34:54,100 --> 02:34:58,900
Most gays don't give a fuck now what?
We'd never figured out what,

2657
02:34:58,930 --> 02:35:00,760
what did Marian get upset with?
It was,

2658
02:35:01,150 --> 02:35:06,150
it was after the show said the problem
with education is systemic word.

2659
02:35:06,310 --> 02:35:09,450
I hate more than the word bat shit crazy.
You don't hate you.

2660
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:11,980
I hate the word bat shit. What
the fuck does that mean? Well,

2661
02:35:12,140 --> 02:35:15,820
batch it is really dangerous.
Guano. Oh, I never knew that. Yeah.

2662
02:35:15,821 --> 02:35:18,110
This is a funny story. You're making
me hate the word less. There was,

2663
02:35:18,111 --> 02:35:20,020
he's a scientist and a,

2664
02:35:20,021 --> 02:35:25,021
there's a particular cave in Africa and
so they had set up to make this video of

2665
02:35:25,961 --> 02:35:29,860
these bats coming out of the cave cause
millions and millions of bats on a

2666
02:35:29,861 --> 02:35:34,180
nightly basis come out of this cave.
And so they set up, set up the cameras.

2667
02:35:34,510 --> 02:35:38,230
What they didn't anticipate is that these
bats, when they come out of the cave,

2668
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:41,230
they release their bowels oh instantly.

2669
02:35:41,320 --> 02:35:46,320
So they were literally covered in bat
shit like swarms and millions and millions

2670
02:35:47,531 --> 02:35:49,660
of bats shitting all over them.

2671
02:35:49,661 --> 02:35:54,220
And they develop these hemorrhagic
viruses. He's horrible diseases,

2672
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:56,980
bleeding from their eyes,
just horrific.

2673
02:35:56,981 --> 02:36:01,420
And they were dead within a week and
they don't know what the fuck killed them

2674
02:36:01,421 --> 02:36:04,240
and the they, you know, they had
to [inaudible] crazy anymore. Yeah.

2675
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:07,780
Thank you for that shit is dangerous
again. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

2676
02:36:07,900 --> 02:36:12,760
We're gonna wrap this up soon
anyway. As soon as you come back. No,

2677
02:36:12,761 --> 02:36:17,290
I don't do reads during the show.
It's fallen apart a little bit.

2678
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:18,580
Fallen apart with his bladder.

2679
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:26,200
He's a little off on the teacher
wages. Okay. Let's see what it is.

2680
02:36:26,440 --> 02:36:29,950
Of course he is closer to
15 to 20 bucks average.

2681
02:36:29,951 --> 02:36:34,510
This is a US average. Oh,
okay. Well there you go. Yeah.

2682
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:39,370
Median hourly rate by job. Yeah, I
didn't believe that. That $60 an hour.

2683
02:36:39,371 --> 02:36:42,440
That seems kind of silly.
He's of,

2684
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:45,100
it's really interesting
because he's a very smart guy,

2685
02:36:45,610 --> 02:36:50,610
but it's almost like he's purposely like
sabotaging real intellectual debate.

2686
02:36:51,971 --> 02:36:53,650
He like kind of what I said,
Fox News earlier.

2687
02:36:53,651 --> 02:36:56,350
It's just like they're making points to
make a point and then they went to argue

2688
02:36:56,351 --> 02:36:59,860
the point. Well he gets into it and
then he sabotaged it with humor.

2689
02:37:00,070 --> 02:37:01,350
Like you fucked it up and like,

2690
02:37:01,450 --> 02:37:05,650
it's almost like this is a strategic use
of the word faggot. Hey, look at the, uh,

2691
02:37:05,651 --> 02:37:09,610
the actual statistics for how much
teachers get paid. It's a lot less.

2692
02:37:10,330 --> 02:37:15,160
$11 for substitute teacher.
$14 for preschool. Uh,

2693
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:16,610
elementary school.
$15

2694
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:19,880
an hour. High School, $20.
Now imagine getting $20.

2695
02:37:19,940 --> 02:37:23,300
That's the highest rate they get by
the way. But imagine getting $20.

2696
02:37:24,360 --> 02:37:27,110
That's out of my ass.
I've looked this up. Well,

2697
02:37:27,140 --> 02:37:30,830
have a seat so we can hear you on the
microphone. Okay, good. Over here.

2698
02:37:32,630 --> 02:37:35,120
He doesn't just fine.
What is the source?

2699
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:40,550
payscale.com and keep it
up there? Where's this? Uh,

2700
02:37:40,610 --> 02:37:44,990
where are they getting this from?
payscale.com willing of seven,

2701
02:37:44,991 --> 02:37:47,750
1200 people from all over the United
States. Totally different numbers.

2702
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:52,640
Th th the teachers is the most
powerful union in the world.

2703
02:37:52,850 --> 02:37:56,450
They fund both sides on Capitol Hill,

2704
02:37:56,470 --> 02:38:01,130
so it's heresy. This is like black
helicopters and nine 11 was an inside job.

2705
02:38:01,131 --> 02:38:05,840
And then teachers, really big mentors.
They act like the mafia, like you will,

2706
02:38:06,350 --> 02:38:10,150
he will get your window smashed when you
fuck with the, uh, what do they call it?

2707
02:38:10,151 --> 02:38:13,310
The NDA. So you guys, anyway,
back to the Mark Marin thing.

2708
02:38:13,310 --> 02:38:16,640
You guys had a problem with the
worst word systemic and bat crazy.

2709
02:38:16,810 --> 02:38:20,470
That shit crazy. He said this
not just one thing. Right.

2710
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:23,900
I agree with him and I had sense.
I go, yes there is just one thing.

2711
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:27,110
And what is all one thing make it
possible to fire a fucking public school

2712
02:38:27,111 --> 02:38:29,480
teacher that would help.
That would certainly help.

2713
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Pretty shades in Harlem
with charter schools.

2714
02:38:32,310 --> 02:38:35,720
They can get fired and Harlem is doing
awesome with that. Just one little thing.

2715
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:37,340
But what did he get upset about?

2716
02:38:37,470 --> 02:38:41,000
There was the transforming guessing that
that's why he didn't like to show Oh,

2717
02:38:41,010 --> 02:38:45,950
just that as far as verifiable,
uh, it was in the tank, the show.

2718
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:49,700
And then when my transphobia controversy
exploded cause you wrote that article,

2719
02:38:49,730 --> 02:38:51,020
he's his people,

2720
02:38:51,021 --> 02:38:56,021
whatever said we're not airing this
show because judging by your views on

2721
02:38:57,411 --> 02:39:01,360
trends, people, the
interviews now incomplete.

2722
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:02,930
Hmm.

2723
02:39:02,930 --> 02:39:07,370
So I guess it was like
saying we interviewed the
head of the KKK about fruits

2724
02:39:07,371 --> 02:39:09,710
and vegetables and then find out
later he's the head of the KKK.

2725
02:39:09,711 --> 02:39:12,650
This would look stupid to put out
talking about food the whole time.

2726
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:15,590
Or say I shot the president
after you'd go, wait a minute,

2727
02:39:15,591 --> 02:39:17,540
we talked to the guy who
killed the president and we
didn't mention the shooting

2728
02:39:17,541 --> 02:39:17,990
the president.

2729
02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:21,620
So because of the fact that your
article came out after the interview,

2730
02:39:21,621 --> 02:39:24,470
he couldn't just release the interview
because it didn't discuss this very

2731
02:39:24,471 --> 02:39:26,480
important topic. That's his side. Yes.

2732
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:31,720
That seems like it's not that important
a topic except to those people or if

2733
02:39:31,791 --> 02:39:33,290
you're talking about that subject,

2734
02:39:33,530 --> 02:39:37,700
I don't think that the subject
of transgender people is
like an integral part of

2735
02:39:37,701 --> 02:39:39,320
who you are or,
uh,

2736
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:43,520
call me or have your people call
me and I'm in La all the time.

2737
02:39:43,540 --> 02:39:48,440
Or doing a dentists say update or say,
Hey, I didn't know you were this weird.

2738
02:39:48,441 --> 02:39:53,090
Youth. Don't think it's cool to cut
your cock off. Uh, let's discuss. Jeez,

2739
02:39:53,180 --> 02:39:54,700
but you did not think.
It's like,

2740
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:57,980
do you think people should be able
to do whatever they want? Yes,

2741
02:39:57,981 --> 02:39:59,450
but we're getting back to
this gay marriage thing.

2742
02:40:00,170 --> 02:40:02,270
When you normalize the transgendered,

2743
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:06,470
we end up in a situation where kids
are taking hormone blockers to prevent

2744
02:40:06,471 --> 02:40:10,280
puberty. We're clapping like
fucking losers. When a little boy,

2745
02:40:10,310 --> 02:40:14,220
a little gay boy gets female estrogen,
when? When should it be? Okay?

2746
02:40:14,370 --> 02:40:16,260
Like with Bailey, Jay,
you look at Billy j,

2747
02:40:16,261 --> 02:40:20,760
doesn't she look like that slightly
mentally it'll gay man. Uh, mentally ill,

2748
02:40:20,761 --> 02:40:25,410
gay man. Who am I like what
sky? What's mentally ill?

2749
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:30,800
He doesn't think he's a man
that's a gender dysphoria
that is well documented as

2750
02:40:33,271 --> 02:40:35,400
a mental disorder. Well, one,

2751
02:40:35,410 --> 02:40:38,280
the thing I like about him is he can
cut his tits off when he realizes what's

2752
02:40:38,281 --> 02:40:41,970
going on and be normal. There's no old
Bailey Jay. You realize there's no, like,

2753
02:40:42,110 --> 02:40:46,850
I am barely Jay. I've been gardening
all day or my knight in shining all.

2754
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:50,970
No, they don't. What do they do? They
ask themselves suicide. They fucking,

2755
02:40:51,060 --> 02:40:56,060
they go back become a meth head and they
get stabbed in a bad drug deal or a no.

2756
02:40:56,430 --> 02:41:00,870
Is that they remove their ted ours because
it's almost like what they want to be

2757
02:41:00,871 --> 02:41:04,200
a woman. You're not, you can't
be a woman. You can't be a bat.

2758
02:41:04,230 --> 02:41:08,010
You can't be a giraffe. Becoming a woman
is not something you get off a shelf.

2759
02:41:08,310 --> 02:41:10,140
What's the matter with homosexuals,

2760
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:14,130
but they don't want to be homosexual
like a lot of them is a perfect example.

2761
02:41:14,131 --> 02:41:17,850
The one that we're talking about,
the MMA fighter, she's now a lesbian.

2762
02:41:18,390 --> 02:41:20,760
She still likes women.
Like she was a,

2763
02:41:20,790 --> 02:41:25,170
she was a man for 30 years and then
became a woman who still likes women.

2764
02:41:25,290 --> 02:41:28,530
She is a wildly mentally disturbed gay

2765
02:41:30,600 --> 02:41:34,470
weight. Straight, straight. Yeah.
Yeah. Fucking crazy straight dude.

2766
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:36,060
He's this crazy man

2767
02:41:38,850 --> 02:41:42,060
and that's a great example. I'm glad you
brought that up because you're saying,

2768
02:41:42,061 --> 02:41:44,300
what's your problem? Why do you
hate all this shit? And I go,

2769
02:41:44,370 --> 02:41:45,990
obviously I don't fucking care.

2770
02:41:46,170 --> 02:41:48,390
Like if you're on a mountain and
you do something to yourself,

2771
02:41:48,391 --> 02:41:50,820
you can cut your face off. They're just,
there was just a woman in the news.

2772
02:41:50,970 --> 02:41:54,870
She decided she wanted to be blind and
she had a physician puts Shinar and

2773
02:41:54,890 --> 02:41:57,210
chemicals in her eyes.
She's blind fucking insane.

2774
02:41:57,420 --> 02:42:00,480
I don't want to make that illegal,
but I want to also say,

2775
02:42:00,481 --> 02:42:04,950
let's not normalize this because someone
who is kind of dumb and crazy and

2776
02:42:04,951 --> 02:42:08,790
thinks they want to invite, now
you've made it. Okay. So the,

2777
02:42:08,970 --> 02:42:13,110
the MMA fight is a perfect example of
the problem with this whole la live and

2778
02:42:13,111 --> 02:42:13,944
let live thing.

2779
02:42:14,010 --> 02:42:18,510
Cause now we have a dude with tits and
a fake cont kicking the shit out of

2780
02:42:18,511 --> 02:42:21,870
chicks. Well there was a really
funny time where this guy was, uh,

2781
02:42:21,871 --> 02:42:24,990
when Rachel Dolezal came
out as Trans Racial,

2782
02:42:25,170 --> 02:42:29,040
this guy was supporting trans
racial and uh, he was right. He was,

2783
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:29,881
but he was joking.

2784
02:42:29,881 --> 02:42:33,660
He was trolling and there were so many
people that were arguing back and forth

2785
02:42:33,661 --> 02:42:37,290
on his Twitter feed. He's a comic, I
guess from England. And uh, you know,

2786
02:42:37,291 --> 02:42:41,520
he was calling it wrong skin
hashtag wrong skin. And, but it was,

2787
02:42:41,610 --> 02:42:44,850
it was a hilarious to watch
these semantics arguments.

2788
02:42:44,970 --> 02:42:46,590
Here's one that you'll find funny.
Okay.

2789
02:42:46,620 --> 02:42:51,540
I got in an argument with someone about
the MMA thing and a about the woman who

2790
02:42:51,541 --> 02:42:53,000
was a man for 30 years.

2791
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:57,540
It became a woman and she said she
was always a woman and I said, really?

2792
02:42:57,541 --> 02:43:02,541
I said even when she was a man having
sex with another woman and making a baby

2793
02:43:03,330 --> 02:43:07,590
and she said even then, yeah,
I sound like that same durable,

2794
02:43:07,650 --> 02:43:11,440
I said that about Caitlyn Jenner.
So that means Kris Jenner was raped

2795
02:43:12,970 --> 02:43:15,920
because she thought she was having
sex with a man. Right. It's a seven.

2796
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:19,990
It was a woman deception. That's a
crime. I assume it is in New Jersey.

2797
02:43:20,050 --> 02:43:23,500
Especially in the definition of rape today
where you, if you regretted it's rape.

2798
02:43:23,530 --> 02:43:27,400
Yes. And if you look at him funny after
it's over, like that was bullshit.

2799
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:31,360
That's rape. Got It. Regretting sex was
raped. I would be doing 10 life sentences.

2800
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:35,140
Well you know the whole thing that's going
on with drinking where the man always

2801
02:43:35,141 --> 02:43:39,100
gets accused of rape. If two people were
drinking together, if the woman is drunk,

2802
02:43:39,160 --> 02:43:42,280
if the woman is drunk and is
doing one of your favorite things,

2803
02:43:42,281 --> 02:43:45,820
drunk driving and she kills people,
she's responsible for her actions.

2804
02:43:45,970 --> 02:43:48,400
But if a woman is drunk
and she has sex with a man,

2805
02:43:48,401 --> 02:43:50,350
apparently she cannot consent.

2806
02:43:50,380 --> 02:43:53,710
That's another great example of what
we're talking about because in the MMA

2807
02:43:53,711 --> 02:43:57,190
situation you lied and said woman or man,
and I have a man being the show.

2808
02:43:57,200 --> 02:44:01,630
Well she didn't lie. She didn't disclose
the fact that she used to be a man.

2809
02:44:02,050 --> 02:44:04,600
That's how she looked at it. She
said it's a medical can. Exactly.

2810
02:44:04,810 --> 02:44:09,810
So you've got to check beaten up and
then with the drinking thing you go,

2811
02:44:09,851 --> 02:44:11,710
wait a minute.
So all drunk sex is rape.

2812
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:16,870
Now we have like there was a woman who
was kicked off a flight for joining the

2813
02:44:16,870 --> 02:44:18,910
mile high club. Really? Yeah.

2814
02:44:19,090 --> 02:44:21,670
Cause she was belligerent and she was
fucking some dude in the bathroom and

2815
02:44:21,671 --> 02:44:25,240
screaming Ah, ah, oh, like
wasted my kind of girl.

2816
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:28,270
And then she gets in a
fight with the staff,

2817
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:30,670
the stewards or whatever
they're called these days.

2818
02:44:30,850 --> 02:44:34,090
The waitresses in the sky and uh,
uh,

2819
02:44:34,150 --> 02:44:38,020
she gets arrested cause she
was fist fighting them and
screaming and, and you go,

2820
02:44:38,021 --> 02:44:41,890
well wait a minute, you were
raped, you were drunk, drunk,

2821
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:44,650
you were drunk having sex.
So you should be charging that guy.

2822
02:44:45,070 --> 02:44:49,870
And when you reinvent the system
and change all the definitions,

2823
02:44:50,110 --> 02:44:53,140
you have to take into account
the victims here. Like,

2824
02:44:53,230 --> 02:44:57,280
well they've got on a blue band and the
alcohol thing outside of colleges, they,

2825
02:44:57,740 --> 02:45:00,040
feminists were pushing
that for a few years ago.

2826
02:45:00,200 --> 02:45:01,510
They were trying to push at nationwide.

2827
02:45:01,511 --> 02:45:04,630
But then it became preposterous because
you realize everyone's a fucking rapist

2828
02:45:04,631 --> 02:45:08,500
because the whole country is filled with
rapists because socially people drink

2829
02:45:08,501 --> 02:45:12,370
and that's how they wind up fucking so
the people under the influence that we're

2830
02:45:12,371 --> 02:45:15,910
having sex, it's like 80%. It's
something, it's something nuts.

2831
02:45:15,940 --> 02:45:16,840
That's why we're here.

2832
02:45:16,841 --> 02:45:20,440
I mean I wouldn't be alive if
drunk sex was rape or illegal,

2833
02:45:20,830 --> 02:45:25,000
but when you do all this shit and you,
you reboot the system,

2834
02:45:25,030 --> 02:45:27,490
what you're actually doing
is trivializing reality.

2835
02:45:27,490 --> 02:45:29,590
And if you say drunk sex is rape,

2836
02:45:29,890 --> 02:45:33,880
some fucking woman who was raped at
knife point by a guy in a ski mask is now

2837
02:45:34,240 --> 02:45:36,400
your peer.
You've just trivialize that.

2838
02:45:36,401 --> 02:45:38,940
And when you say Rachel
Dolezal is black youth,

2839
02:45:39,050 --> 02:45:43,390
it's trivialized every black person's
experience who you grew up with,

2840
02:45:43,391 --> 02:45:46,780
real racism. And when you say
that Caitlyn Jenner is a woman,

2841
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:51,130
you've trivialized womanhood now,
like this woman who gave birth and had,

2842
02:45:51,340 --> 02:45:51,521
you know,

2843
02:45:51,521 --> 02:45:54,370
she's a grandmother and there's a family
reunion and she's the matriarch that

2844
02:45:54,371 --> 02:45:56,290
basically built all these 60 people.

2845
02:45:56,560 --> 02:46:00,040
She's the same as this fucking guy
who put some fake tits. Bailey. Jay,

2846
02:46:00,670 --> 02:46:04,900
you've that's sexist.
You've trivialized it. Well,

2847
02:46:04,930 --> 02:46:06,850
it's certainly a weird thing.

2848
02:46:08,110 --> 02:46:11,840
I don't know if you've trivialized it
because I don't think it diminishes real

2849
02:46:11,841 --> 02:46:16,400
women in any way, shape or form does not
in my eyes. Okay, I'm a woman. We are,

2850
02:46:16,640 --> 02:46:19,910
we have been suffering, we
are oppressed. We get raped.

2851
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:23,810
And then some dude in a way it
goes, yeah, it's a fucking insane.

2852
02:46:24,050 --> 02:46:28,710
We are getting harassed on the street.
And she's looking at him going, oh,

2853
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:32,810
well I was actually really
raped. So was I. I had drunk sex.

2854
02:46:35,480 --> 02:46:38,270
Well, you just shat on her whole
experience with your bullshit wig.

2855
02:46:40,100 --> 02:46:43,780
I don't know if you do, but I see what
you're saying. I see what you're saying.

2856
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:47,810
I just think black face and go in
the million man march and go, Yo,

2857
02:46:47,811 --> 02:46:50,960
this shit is outrageous man.
But what about the guy who's a,

2858
02:46:50,961 --> 02:46:54,400
one of the guys from black lives
matter on Shaun King, who's wife like,

2859
02:46:54,410 --> 02:46:59,180
I feel like I'm the same liberal kid I
was when I was a punk teenager, right?

2860
02:46:59,210 --> 02:47:02,480
I don't like Rachel Dolezal in
Shaun King because they are racist,

2861
02:47:04,160 --> 02:47:06,740
racist,
but they identify with black people.

2862
02:47:06,741 --> 02:47:09,110
They are trivializing
the black experience.

2863
02:47:09,770 --> 02:47:12,560
I don't like Islam because they're sexist.

2864
02:47:12,890 --> 02:47:17,890
I don't like fucking feminists because
they deprive women of the joy of having

2865
02:47:18,021 --> 02:47:21,350
babies and they trivialize
what it is to be a real woman.

2866
02:47:21,770 --> 02:47:24,980
Their whole sort of anti southern
Belle thing is anti woman.

2867
02:47:25,670 --> 02:47:27,230
I'm still a feminist,

2868
02:47:27,430 --> 02:47:32,300
anti racist fucking punk rocker.
You're a feminist.

2869
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:36,920
I'm a feminist in the sense that I, I,
as Donald Trump says, I adore women.

2870
02:47:37,130 --> 02:47:40,550
I like women. I think that's the
definition of a feminist, right?

2871
02:47:41,030 --> 02:47:42,740
A feminist is someone who had,

2872
02:47:42,741 --> 02:47:47,500
that definitely has merit to
femininity to women. Yeah.

2873
02:47:47,510 --> 02:47:51,500
That's how they use it though. I know that
today it means, oh, you're a feminist.

2874
02:47:51,501 --> 02:47:52,550
If you think men or women,

2875
02:47:52,551 --> 02:47:55,460
you think women are bad ass and
kick ass during kickass too,

2876
02:47:55,610 --> 02:47:56,780
and they're doing circle kicks.

2877
02:47:56,810 --> 02:48:00,080
You know what my favorite is when
they say that if you are a feminist,

2878
02:48:00,081 --> 02:48:03,920
there's no need for any
other sort of equality,

2879
02:48:03,921 --> 02:48:07,730
gender equality issue because
feminism addresses all of it.

2880
02:48:07,910 --> 02:48:12,440
So there's no need to have men's
rights issues because once feminism is

2881
02:48:12,441 --> 02:48:16,340
completely achieved, once female
rights are equal to men's rights,

2882
02:48:16,580 --> 02:48:19,280
then they will address all
the other rights. I actually,

2883
02:48:19,490 --> 02:48:21,770
I talked to a feminist
about that and I said, okay,

2884
02:48:21,771 --> 02:48:26,420
so you must hate the amount of prison
rape going on, Eh, with men, right?

2885
02:48:26,450 --> 02:48:28,520
And she goes, yes, we do. And I go,

2886
02:48:28,550 --> 02:48:33,550
I can't even conceive of feminists
standing outside of prison with placards

2887
02:48:34,071 --> 02:48:38,570
going stuck the raping of these guys.
Well, the promise of being raped by guys,

2888
02:48:38,750 --> 02:48:40,930
like when they say that more than men
or be the line when they say their

2889
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:44,330
humanists, they don't care
if it's made. Right. Well,

2890
02:48:44,420 --> 02:48:46,010
I think a lot of when you,

2891
02:48:46,040 --> 02:48:49,250
when you're looking at these really
unattractive women that happened just so

2892
02:48:49,251 --> 02:48:50,210
happened to be feminist.
Again,

2893
02:48:50,211 --> 02:48:53,540
we're not saying that all feminists
are unattractive, but I've,

2894
02:48:53,610 --> 02:48:55,340
I have friends and I'm sure you do too,

2895
02:48:55,341 --> 02:48:58,250
that are just ugly dude's and they
grow to hate women because they're just

2896
02:48:58,251 --> 02:49:02,900
associate women with rejection and
feeling bad and they're just getting just

2897
02:49:02,901 --> 02:49:06,860
constantly shit on by women like fuck
these bitches and they develop that sort

2898
02:49:06,861 --> 02:49:08,370
of mentality.

2899
02:49:08,460 --> 02:49:12,180
It's just seems to be like a natural
course of progression that some really

2900
02:49:12,181 --> 02:49:15,870
unattractive women would be like really
hostile to men too because all their

2901
02:49:15,871 --> 02:49:20,460
life they've been rejected and made
to feel terrible by men. Right?

2902
02:49:20,850 --> 02:49:25,050
Yeah, I agree, but I don't understand
why they don't try like try what?

2903
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:28,890
Grow your hair long,
wear high heel shoes.

2904
02:49:28,950 --> 02:49:32,490
Maybe they be around the last call and
I'll fuck you. But here's the thing,

2905
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:37,350
a really hot chick with purple hair
and it's short and she's got a fucking

2906
02:49:37,351 --> 02:49:39,560
banging body.
Oh fuck the shit out of it.

2907
02:49:39,561 --> 02:49:42,510
You wouldn't even care that he wouldn't
even care. He'd be like, you sexy bitch.

2908
02:49:42,511 --> 02:49:45,430
Like we don't like short hair. We
don't like Birkenstocks. I don't know.

2909
02:49:45,460 --> 02:49:48,210
I used to date this girl. She had
a shaved head. She was hot as fuck.

2910
02:49:48,250 --> 02:49:51,300
When you fuck them from behind, it looks
like a dude does. I don't like that.

2911
02:49:51,301 --> 02:49:55,920
That's great. Very small dude with
a big ass fat 12 year old boy.

2912
02:49:57,170 --> 02:50:01,910
It. We have a women talk
about unattainable, uh, uh,

2913
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:03,120
expectations for men.

2914
02:50:03,360 --> 02:50:07,080
That's gays and women coming and put
those expectations were pretty cool.

2915
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:09,750
Like grow your hair long,
wear high heel shoes,

2916
02:50:10,350 --> 02:50:13,800
even if you're fat w put on some
lingerie and we'll work it out.

2917
02:50:13,801 --> 02:50:14,521
Do you think that there's,

2918
02:50:14,521 --> 02:50:18,030
what's going on with a lot of this is
that there's a lot of people that are,

2919
02:50:18,031 --> 02:50:21,810
they have these standards that they
feel like they've, they're supposed to,

2920
02:50:22,410 --> 02:50:25,080
they're supposed to uphold or
they're supposed to live up to,

2921
02:50:25,380 --> 02:50:28,320
but now they have a voice.
They have a voice because of the Internet,

2922
02:50:28,321 --> 02:50:31,800
because they find likeminded people
online and they get really active in those

2923
02:50:31,801 --> 02:50:36,190
communities and it gives them a sense
of community and a sense of, uh, of,

2924
02:50:36,191 --> 02:50:39,960
of purpose that they never
had before. Totally. Yeah.
They don't really believe it.

2925
02:50:39,961 --> 02:50:43,470
I saw some feminist girl, you know,
they hold their stupid fucking signs.

2926
02:50:43,471 --> 02:50:45,900
I love those signs and the sign said,
I'm sorry,

2927
02:50:45,901 --> 02:50:49,950
my breasts aren't big enough and she
had like pretty decent tits and I'm

2928
02:50:49,951 --> 02:50:53,610
thinking, I'll fucking come on
your tits. Like, I don't care.

2929
02:50:53,990 --> 02:50:56,460
That is feminism right there.
You're a feminist.

2930
02:50:58,110 --> 02:51:03,050
I've met maybe one guy in my life who
likes fake tits. I, I dated a girl,

2931
02:51:03,051 --> 02:51:06,450
had fake tits and she sat me down and
we had a talk where she told me I had to

2932
02:51:06,570 --> 02:51:11,400
pay more attention to her breasts because
I would be like face, neck, shoulders.

2933
02:51:12,790 --> 02:51:17,220
She sat down and had a talk. Yeah.
Cause she's like, what did she say?

2934
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:21,210
You need to pay more attention to my
breasts. Wow. My Dad could have those.

2935
02:51:21,240 --> 02:51:26,130
I can't get into it. I
can feel the scene. Yeah.

2936
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:28,590
Well the old ones especially,
they're really good now.

2937
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:30,590
They have some new ones now that are like,
they're,

2938
02:51:30,650 --> 02:51:35,650
they're a solid instead of a bag of
water now it's like a silicon mushy thing

2939
02:51:36,991 --> 02:51:41,760
where it feels exactly like breast tissue
allegedly. I like your shitty tits.

2940
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:46,410
You like regular natural tits. I like,
it's like my buddy Trevor said he goes,

2941
02:51:46,411 --> 02:51:49,830
when I was 20 I dated a girl
with droopy tits and I hated it,

2942
02:51:49,831 --> 02:51:51,750
but I was sure wouldn't mind
fucking with them right now.

2943
02:51:52,320 --> 02:51:56,460
Like a girl doggy style and
they're hanging down like
fucking bags and swinging.

2944
02:51:56,550 --> 02:52:00,450
I like that. I couldn't look at them
or I'd come. Wow. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

2945
02:52:00,451 --> 02:52:01,450
When you get older,
your,

2946
02:52:01,451 --> 02:52:05,010
your spectrum of attractiveness
increases and you're like, Ooh,

2947
02:52:05,020 --> 02:52:08,800
I'm fucking from Ohana can sort
of smell poop. I love it. Oh,

2948
02:52:08,890 --> 02:52:13,330
just a faint whiff. Yeah.
Don't get like a woman's ass.

2949
02:52:13,331 --> 02:52:16,810
And you're feeling like a woman
who'd washes that ass first gross.

2950
02:52:16,870 --> 02:52:19,600
I know too much about
bacteria. Oh, that's it.

2951
02:52:19,601 --> 02:52:22,370
Like a Jew [inaudible] la all this time.
Yeah.

2952
02:52:22,420 --> 02:52:24,120
You've taken on their
paranoia about gender

2953
02:52:26,570 --> 02:52:28,930
Fred staph infection
that almost killed him.

2954
02:52:29,440 --> 02:52:32,670
I want queefs I don't break for queefs.
You know,

2955
02:52:32,671 --> 02:52:35,580
like you're fucking going and you hear
that and they sort of want to stop. Yeah.

2956
02:52:35,590 --> 02:52:38,980
Fucking right. That's like I'm driving on
the highway and someone goes, hey, okay.

2957
02:52:38,981 --> 02:52:43,270
Let me ask you this. You, he pussy when
they're on their period. Uh, I used to,

2958
02:52:43,271 --> 02:52:46,600
but as I got older, no.
Hmm. I don't give a fuck.

2959
02:52:46,630 --> 02:52:49,600
I used to fuck chicks with Shane
a lot. And uh, how dare you,

2960
02:52:50,220 --> 02:52:52,480
we would accidentally
touch Dick's sometimes.

2961
02:52:52,481 --> 02:52:54,430
Like one time I was
like the operation game.

2962
02:52:54,460 --> 02:52:57,820
I thought it was fucking a girl in
her ass and it went into her cunt and

2963
02:52:57,821 --> 02:53:00,760
actually went into his condom inside.

2964
02:53:00,850 --> 02:53:04,180
I'm looking down at her how looses his
cotton? What is it? A fucking trash bag.

2965
02:53:04,210 --> 02:53:06,850
I was harder than makes sense.
At least resistance.

2966
02:53:07,150 --> 02:53:11,290
So I'm looking down at me like I swear
to God I got inside his condom. Yup.

2967
02:53:11,350 --> 02:53:14,950
So using the condom ever believes me
container so that you guys could rub dicks

2968
02:53:14,951 --> 02:53:18,550
together. But that wasn't the
plan. But I was, I was like,

2969
02:53:18,551 --> 02:53:19,840
I'm fucking this bitch his ass.

2970
02:53:19,870 --> 02:53:22,990
And I looked down and I see
an asshole and I'm like,

2971
02:53:22,991 --> 02:53:26,320
how many assholes is this woman
that I'm in? At least one of them.

2972
02:53:26,410 --> 02:53:30,190
And then I reached down and I feel
a condom. How drunk were you guys?

2973
02:53:30,250 --> 02:53:33,280
Not Drunk at all? Well, how did you not
know where you're putting your Dick?

2974
02:53:33,281 --> 02:53:36,280
Don't you look? What are you looking
at you, you're, you're on the ass.

2975
02:53:36,281 --> 02:53:40,360
You're pushing and pushing and pushing
and then you sort of feel that it slipped.

2976
02:53:40,780 --> 02:53:42,780
So you go, oh, that must
have gone in a hole.

2977
02:53:42,790 --> 02:53:45,220
The one that was pushing a girl
doing the whole time, calling

2978
02:53:48,110 --> 02:53:51,520
like Donald Sutherland and invasion
of the body snatchers. Well,

2979
02:53:51,521 --> 02:53:55,870
she's got to Dixon and vagina.
She's fucking, oh Huster listen,

2980
02:53:55,871 --> 02:53:59,380
she was from Malta. I hate to wrap
this up on a, on a high note like that,

2981
02:53:59,480 --> 02:54:02,950
but we're out of time. Did
you already hear the end of
the story? Oh sure, please.

2982
02:54:02,951 --> 02:54:05,790
So anyway, I reached down, I
go, I didn't have a condom on,

2983
02:54:05,800 --> 02:54:10,070
I have a condom on and then I pull out
and I busted not on her butt and if

2984
02:54:10,470 --> 02:54:13,600
people go, but you touched a dick. But
when you're doing that kind of stuff,

2985
02:54:13,760 --> 02:54:17,770
it's like two mobsters digging a hole
for a body and their shovels clink.

2986
02:54:17,790 --> 02:54:21,730
Like you don't fucking care. You're
at work. Right. I understand. I still,

2987
02:54:21,750 --> 02:54:25,150
I wanted to go. How do you wrap
that up nice and tight. Um,

2988
02:54:25,330 --> 02:54:29,860
how can people see your show on
the Anthony [inaudible] Dot com?

2989
02:54:30,030 --> 02:54:30,430
Uh,

2990
02:54:30,430 --> 02:54:35,410
if you're especially a
thorough anthony.com/gavin,

2991
02:54:35,830 --> 02:54:40,000
is it available in audio
form as well? Yes, it is.

2992
02:54:40,120 --> 02:54:43,600
And they also do a best of
every week. That's free. Um,

2993
02:54:43,720 --> 02:54:47,640
and that has legion of skanks and
Anthony come in and my show, um,

2994
02:54:47,950 --> 02:54:52,120
and I do a column at Tacky Magaluf.
Dot. Jay [inaudible]. Hilarious.

2995
02:54:52,150 --> 02:54:54,700
One time he was talking shit about
me saying Gavin's has a lot of shit,

2996
02:54:54,701 --> 02:54:57,100
but I shot them down once
and I knew they were nearby.

2997
02:54:57,490 --> 02:55:02,020
So I got my car and he said he shot you
down. Yeah. Like in what way? Like Neil,

2998
02:55:02,080 --> 02:55:04,940
one of my arguments, he pointed a
hawk. So you've drove over there?

2999
02:55:04,941 --> 02:55:07,580
I drove over there. I knew it
was live and I was like, what?

3000
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,880
I hear that all the time. What was
the thing? Right? And I'm sorry,

3001
02:55:10,881 --> 02:55:14,330
I can't remember the exact thing
you said. Dut, Dah, Dah, Dah.

3002
02:55:14,600 --> 02:55:18,260
And then later you said Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah. And that shuts
you down. And I was like,

3003
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:24,680
that is actually exactly what happened.
I still go back in the car and went home.

3004
02:55:24,681 --> 02:55:29,150
Like nailed. It happens. All right.

3005
02:55:29,210 --> 02:55:32,510
Thank you Kevin. Thanks for
having me. This was fun. Thank
you very much. Thank you.

3006
02:55:32,980 --> 02:55:36,520
All Right Gavin. Mcinnes
ladies and gentlemen, we'll be
back. See you soon. Bye. Bye.

3007
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:40,780

That was the funnest car.
