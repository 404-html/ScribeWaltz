1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,650
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast was one of the episodes that we

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:07,060
made while we were filming the Scifi show.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,970
Joe Rogan questions everything.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,940
So what we did when we did that show,

5
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:13,680
if you've never seen or heard of it,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,640
we had a podcast on the show and a lot
of people thought it was a fake podcast,

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,240
but it was actually a real podcast and
thanks to the generosity of the Scifi

8
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:21,631
channel,

9
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,420
we are now able to
release it as a podcast.

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,210
So a thank you to Tim and Wayne,

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:27,511
uh,

12
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:31,820
from Psi Phi and a to a
Michael and frank from uh,

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,590
Arthur Smith that produced the show.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,410
Thanks also to Todd who was
the director of the show.

15
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:39,060
We had a great time doing it and uh,

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,780
appreciate it very much and appreciate
you guys letting me do this like that.

17
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,680
Like the way we did it.

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,491
I think it was a,

19
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:45,690
it was really fun to do it this way.

20
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:48,450
We did it exactly like a regular podcast,

21
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:49,350
just me and Duncan.

22
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:54,380
And in this episode we went over
what's called a biohacking or um,

23
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,040
what,

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,300
what I call dorks with knives
sticking things under their skin.

25
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,530
Fascinating subject and uh,

26
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:03,960
I think you'll enjoy the shit out of it.

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,010
This episode is brought
to you by legal zoom.

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,220
Legal Zoom is a one of the sponsors
that we have where we have actually many

29
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,770
people that are connected
to the show have used it on,

30
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:19,170
it was formulated through legal zoom.

31
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:19,810
Brian,

32
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,220
um,

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,280
made his company in
LLC through legal zoom.

34
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,720
It's a way you can do things online where
you can get legal papers filed and do

35
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:34,650
things without actually having to
go to an attorney and sit down and,

36
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:35,160
you know,

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,760
pay for an office visit and pay exorbitant
amounts of money to an attorney.

38
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,570
And also you have to have a schedule
shit and drive and all that jazz.

39
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,520
You can use legal zoom naked.

40
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,063
You could be naked.

41
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:46,770
Nobody,

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,603
nobody can stop you.

43
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,301
You know,

44
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,420
you could make it a point to only use
legal zoom when you're naked and won't

45
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:56,421
have any benefit or any detriment to
the actual legal legality of the papers

46
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,044
that you,

47
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,003
that you make.

48
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,600
Like what kind of stuff can you do?

49
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,781
Well,

50
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:05,781

patents.

56
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,750
If you've got a great idea
and you want to protect it,

57
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,741
if you have a family,

58
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:14,760
you can make a will.

59
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,630
You can make a legal
will for just 69 bucks.

um,

77
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,050
the podcasts that we did on bio
hacking with Duncan Trussell and me.

78
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,123
All right.

79
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,540
The Joe Rogan experience Joe
Rogan podcast by night all day.

80
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,291
No,

81
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,220
it's really crazy.

82
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,173
Your mom,

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,760
after that,

84
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,190
one of your Stepdad's,

85
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,640
isn't that like an interesting sort of a,

86
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:37,500
of a snap back from that,

87
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,341
you know,

88
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:40,920
like she's probably around
this crazy guy with guns.

89
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,071
Oh fucker.

90
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,010
Give me a gay guy.

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,260
He has a kid.

92
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,733
My mom did.

93
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,570
My Dad was like really violent
cop and she married a hippie.

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,460
Like when she broke up with him,

95
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:55,200
my stepfather had long hair until
I was like 15 years old here.

96
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,053
Like a ponytail.

97
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,980
Who's a total complete hippie,

98
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,930
crazy stoner architect,

99
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,980
you know?

100
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,430
Yeah,

101
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:01,701
yeah.

102
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:02,534
Well he went back.

103
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,130
You don't want to date hunter s Thompson,

104
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,050
you don't want to be around.

105
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,330
Was that your dad hunter
s Thompson Shooting Shit?

106
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:08,961
Yeah,

107
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:09,890
still is.

108
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,300
He is.

109
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,770
He's,

110
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:11,960
he's,

111
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,990
he's still traveled around in a a car RV.

112
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:16,040
Just seeing the world.

113
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,401
Yeah,

114
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:17,510
he will now he's just,

115
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:17,751
no,

116
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,750
now he's like local and the Alabama,

117
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,640
but he like goes hunting deer still.

118
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:22,941
And He,

119
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:25,190
like I told you the fist fight thing,

120
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:25,640
right?

121
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,473
No,

122
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,740
this is the weirdest thing.

123
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:27,980
My,

124
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,910
I was getting a ride.

125
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:29,780
This is a quick story.

126
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:33,380
I was getting a ride back from
college with my friend Sean.

127
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:34,180
He recording all this.

128
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,700
Yeah.

129
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,920
My friend Shawn is driving back to,

130
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,320
uh,

131
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,900
was,

132
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,000
was driving to,

133
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,740
I'm immobile where his dad lived
and on the way back I'm riding with,

134
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,970
with this guy and he's like,

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,020
oh dude,

136
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:45,860
I forgot to ask.

137
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:46,521
I want to ask you,

138
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:48,420
this is your dad's name,

139
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,254
Julian.

140
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,211
And I'm like,

141
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:50,790
yeah,

142
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,200
Joey.

143
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,591
And Trust me,

144
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:51,891
he's like,

145
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,320
your dad assaulted my dad and a bar.

146
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,160
My Dad,

147
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,960
my dad beat up my friend's
dad from in college.

148
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,400
But when did this happen?

149
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,370
This was w w the the assault happened.

150
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,060
Yeah,

151
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,250
I think before me and this
guy were in college together.

152
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:14,300
But if you look at the probability of
getting a ride back from college with a

153
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:15,800
guy who was immobile,

154
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,360
the probability of your dad
having beaten his dad up,

155
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,340
it's so slim.

156
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,890
It's so slim that like my,

157
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,600
what are the odds that my,

158
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,440
that we both go to this liberal arts
college of 500 students and the one other

159
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:31,101
guy from mobile,

160
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:31,910
Alabama,

161
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,790
his father had been assaulted
by my father and a bar.

162
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,240
Those are pretty small and minuscule odds.

163
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,780
It's pretty funny too that it would be
your dad too because you're like the

164
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:42,614
opposite.

165
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,380
Like I could never imagine
you just assaulting someone.

166
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,730
Even if somebody got really mad at you,

167
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:47,091
you'd be like,

168
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:47,361
all right,

169
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:48,470
well fuck you man.

170
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:49,530
And you just like get out of there.

171
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,260
The idea of you assaulting
someone is beyond comprehension.

172
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,160
So the idea of your dad being
this fucking tooth bullet

173
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,140
and savage beating the fuck out of
your friend's dad getting arrested.

174
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,630
Jesus Christ got arrested
in the parking lot.

175
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,570
Two cops took him down and he kind of,

176
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,220
my dad

177
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,150
came home from high school
once with a black eye,

178
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,201
him and his,

179
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:14,530
uh,

180
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:14,831
his,

181
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:15,190
uh,

182
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,910
coworker,

183
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,540
they were doing a business together
and the business started going bad.

184
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,060
They got the fucking fist fight and he
came home and I remember looking at him,

185
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,430
I was like 16 or 17 or something
like that in a blackout.

186
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,751
I was like,

187
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:27,190
what the fuck man,

188
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,480
are you done with this?

189
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,370
You're still duking it out,

190
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,060
you know,

191
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,451
40,

192
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:33,040
whatever the hell will heal old.

193
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:33,761
He was back then.

194
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:34,870
Well it's a classic.

195
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,190
It's a classic.

196
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,510
It's a classic man.

197
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,201
It's weird.

198
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:39,280
A classic man.

199
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,170
Fuck.

200
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,003
Like it was like,

201
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,010
like thinking a Hemingway.

202
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:43,630
That's what's just part of being a man.

203
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:47,470
It's like you would get in it some
inevitable fistfight and in those days it

204
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:51,790
seems like you don't get in a fist fight
and there's lawsuits and legal staff.

205
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,570
It's just like the other guy
excepts getting his ass kicked.

206
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:57,040
You're the victor and that's it.

207
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,110
Or you get your ass kicked
and you forget about it.

208
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,730
That seems like the old way.

209
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:01,211
It is now.

210
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:02,320
If you get in a fist fight,

211
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,730
you end up in,

212
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:03,981
you know,

213
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,200
a serious legal trouble,

214
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:06,850
you get all the instant lawsuit.

215
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,800
But it was used to just be like,

216
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:12,580
when you see elk smashing into
each other in the wilderness,

217
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:13,540
that's what it used to be.

218
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,321
Being a man.

219
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:17,620
You would just run into a guy and
just start punching each other.

220
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:18,870
And then with it,

221
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,120
those were the days back in the good
old days before writing shit down

222
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,743
was,

223
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,980
people had a few mistakes,

224
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,370
just started writing shit down.

225
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:31,940
They were like,

226
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,990
oh yeah,

227
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,810
okay.

228
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,040
Yeah,

229
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,500
blame it on a Robbie Robbie's fault.

230
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,060
And that gentleman is,

231
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:39,340
his name is Sharon,

232
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,060
Sharon,

233
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,510
Sharon,

234
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,110
Sharon,

235
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,230
Sharon and Lucas.

236
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,180
And they're from a grindhouse
wetware and grindhouse wetware.

237
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:47,780
First of all,

238
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,420
greatest name for a competent,

239
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,263
amazing ever.

240
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,643
What does that mean?

241
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,850
Uh,

242
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,560
so it comes from the name,

243
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,420
uh,

244
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:55,911
grinders.

245
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,110
That's what we get real close to that.

246
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,470
Uh,

247
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,101
that's what we are.

248
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:58,934
We're grinders.

249
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,130
Grinders are kind of like a,

250
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,510
what happens when you make open source
hackers and body modification with a dash

251
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:06,344
of transhumanism.

252
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,280
Uh,

253
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,640
and what wears a is this,

254
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:10,971
you know,

255
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:11,804
your body.

256
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,080
So we're literally grinding our biology.

257
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,880
There's all these interesting little
names that you guys have for yourself.

258
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,420
Close fall grinders.

259
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,560
We're grinders,

260
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,740
we're transhumanists
where there's a lot of uh,

261
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,330
self defining going on there.

262
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,230
Well,

263
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,220
it's not exactly that we're self defining.

264
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:36,900
We're just guys who we really
liked technology and we
all grew up with like you

265
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:41,901
talk about growing up with Hemingway
and classic men and we were all about

266
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:42,540
fighting.

267
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,200
We grew up,

268
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,711
we were,

269
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:47,220
we were protected and sheltered and
grew up with star wars and grew up with

270
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,740
these stories about robots I could think.

271
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:54,270
And people that couldn't live any
longer and had to augment themselves and

272
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,680
cyborgs and well,

273
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,690
cyborgs were really cool.

274
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,490
We thought they were really cool.

275
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,481
And uh,

276
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:01,021
you know,

277
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:06,021
I was in my twenties when we hit
the year 2001st thing that happened,

278
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,550
New Year's Eve,

279
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,760
2000 and after I got over the
shock of nothing hitting the wall,

280
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,630
nothing falling out of the sky,

281
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,950
I turned to my brother and went,

282
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,990
where is my fucking jet pack?

283
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,300
And that kind of summed it up.

284
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,860
I felt that way.

285
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,640
Um,

286
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,780
my buddy's felt that way.

287
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,830
I didn't realize it,

288
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,810
but there were a lot of
people who felt that way.

289
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:28,711
And,

290
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:29,040
uh,

291
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,190
we were all broke and we
didn't know much about science.

292
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,300
And,

293
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,133
um,

294
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,760
somewhere along the line,

295
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,710
like I guess in 2006,

296
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:42,711
there was a kid in Arizona who realized
that he could start stimulating his

297
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:45,630
nerves with magnets,

298
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:46,980
with magnetic implants.

299
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,911
He,

300
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:48,271
uh,

301
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:52,530
went to a body mog guide and got
an implant done in his fingers.

302
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,590
It started going from
him to a guy in Europe.

303
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,720
And then like 2008,

304
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:58,520
there was a,

305
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,040
uh,

306
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,180
lady Quinn Norton,

307
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:00,960
um,

308
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,380
who wrote for wired and wrote
for some other or other places.

309
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:05,214
And she did it.

310
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,320
She went out and said it was a bad idea.

311
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,150
Don't do it.

312
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,983
Um,

313
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,410
other people started doing it.

314
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:10,910
Um,

315
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,743
so

316
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,683
let's back up.

317
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,191
First of all,

318
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:14,480
explain what you're talking about.

319
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,070
You're talking about bio hacking,

320
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:20,240
talking about doing something to your
body that enhances it in integrating,

321
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,190
incorporating technology into your body.

322
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,690
And the first guy was the guy in Phoenix
that did the Arizona rather was at

323
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:27,021
Arizona.

324
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:27,531
Was it Phoenix,

325
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:28,260
Arizona?

326
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah.

327
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,440
They did the magnets and its fingers.

328
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,671
As far as we know,

329
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:32,520
that's the first,

330
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:33,354
the pioneer.

331
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,400
As far as first document,

332
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,030
what benefit is there of
having magnets in your fingers?

333
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:38,510
Like what,

334
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,010
what did that accomplish for him besides
making it easier to put your hand on a

335
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:43,844
refrigerator

336
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:45,731
easier?

337
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:46,760
I think it's annoying.

338
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,030
I'm being annoying moment.

339
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,980
You're always getting stuck to things.

340
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,850
Yeah.

341
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,260
It doesn't exactly work like that.

342
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:54,790
These are really tiny magnets.

343
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,560
Magnets in your fingers.

344
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:56,950
Yeah.

345
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,281
Yeah.

346
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,061
I got like,

347
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:58,894
uh,

348
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,030
got wound around there.

349
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,190
One around there.

350
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,720
Wow.

351
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,430
So,

352
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,010
so you implanted magnets in your fingers?

353
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,830
Yeah.

354
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,663
Why'd you do that?

355
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,291
Uh,

356
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,124
I was drunk.

357
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,430
No kidding,

358
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:12,940
kidding.

359
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,690
Um,

360
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,410
I uh,

361
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,310
found out about this.

362
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:18,490
I was really interested in
everything we've been talking about.

363
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,820
I ran into a childhood friend of mine
who got it done last year and when he

364
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,690
showed me what he was doing with it,

365
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,040
I had to do it.

366
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:27,874
What was he doing with it?

367
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,893
Um,

368
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,580
it gives you the ability when you implant
a magnet in the nerve dance area of

369
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:37,060
your hand when you are around
an electromagnetic field,

370
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:37,630
um,

371
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,890
that magnet vibrates.

372
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,810
And so you can feel that now there
is a property of our brains called

373
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:44,800
neuroplasticity.

374
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:45,570
Uh,

375
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,210
when you provide a stimulus
over a course of time,

376
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,673
uh,

377
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,060
like about six months,

378
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,980
your brain starts to it,

379
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,870
it starts building something new.

380
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:56,981
And,

381
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:57,251
uh,

382
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,250
I was always fascinated
even as a child of a,

383
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,950
the idea of having an extra sense,

384
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,110
not necessarily like ESP,

385
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:09,160
but just an extra sense or be able to
hear a sound that no one's ever heard

386
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:09,490
before.

387
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,323
Is he a color?

388
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,980
No one ever seen before.

389
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,430
All those stories from a don't
do drug pamphlets that were like,

390
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,050
I can see the music,

391
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:18,700
I can taste sound.

392
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,350
That sounded amazing to me.

393
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,470
So when I heard about this extra sense,

394
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,490
I jumped at the chance to
incorporate that in my body.

395
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,480
But what extra cents,

396
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,080
the extra sense of using these magnets
to detect and electrical field or to

397
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,710
vibrate during an electrical field?

398
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,540
Is that what you're saying?

399
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,340
Yeah.

400
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,030
How would you define an electrical field?

401
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,133
Um,

402
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,760
it's our station.

403
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,300
It's an electromagnetic field.

404
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:44,770
So anytime that an electron
travels in a straight line,

405
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:45,791
uh,

406
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:50,350
you have a magnetic field that's coming
out kind of in a circle around it

407
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,820
radiates around it.

408
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,420
Um,

409
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,890
if you have a coil,

410
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:56,860
a coil of wire and the
electrons going through a coil,

411
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,170
there'll be kind of like a doughnut shape,

412
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,580
magnetic field around it.

413
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,530
So those sorts of fields,

414
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,870
they have property of a volume
and property of frequency.

415
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,430
They vibrate at a certain,

416
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,460
certain frequency and they're
loud or soft like a transformer.

417
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:15,131
Like we'll watch,

418
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:15,701
we'll transplant.

419
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,560
We have a building that absolutely.

420
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,830
So if you were near that with your
fingers having the magnets in them,

421
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:21,760
what would happen to you?

422
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,390
Um,

423
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,610
I can feel those sometimes.

424
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:25,390
Uh,

425
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,470
when people would ask me at the beginning
what it was like to feel this stuff,

426
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,770
I would describe it like an effort of
effervescent feeling like bubbles if felt

427
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:35,944
like bubbles.

428
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,100
And it was really interesting to me.

429
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,220
It felt like bubbles.

430
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,840
Yeah.

431
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,960
Like how does that work?

432
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:41,940
Well,

433
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,910
it's the weirdest explanation
for some of that or description.

434
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,130
Oh,

435
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,963
felt like bubbles.

436
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,110
I don't even know what to say.

437
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,420
Yeah.

438
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,253
Kind of like fists,

439
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,220
like pop tarts,

440
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,323
pop rocks runner.

441
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,060
Seafoam I think his wedding,

442
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,460
I don't know.

443
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,280
Froth like dog froth.

444
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,280
Every person that has the implant
uses completely different language.

445
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,100
It's been really fascinating to run
into other people with implants and talk

446
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:10,600
about this stuff because we are describing
the same phenomena and it's like

447
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:14,050
you're asking me to describe a
color that you've never seen before.

448
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,850
How am I going to describe squad?

449
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:16,420
Uh,

450
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,290
it's squat.

451
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,333
Was that blue?

452
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,761
No,

453
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:20,140
it's squat is a purple.

454
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,531
Uh,

455
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:20,831
no,

456
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:21,970
it's like a tasting.

457
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:22,540
An orange.

458
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:22,721
Oh,

459
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:23,410
so it's orange?

460
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,243
No.

461
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,850
Is there any negative repercussions to
having these magnets installed in your

462
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:28,340
body?

463
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,750
Um,

464
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:28,991
well,

465
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:33,100
the first time that someone actually said
something that made sense as far as a

466
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:33,934
negative thing,

467
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,640
I saw a speech by Quinn
Norton where she said,

468
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:36,881
Hey,

469
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:37,541
don't do this.

470
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,620
This is a bad idea.

471
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,580
Um,

472
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,020
hers shattered.

473
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:41,621
What?

474
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:44,650
Shattered her magnetic implant shattered.

475
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,370
Shattered.

476
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:45,671
Okay.

477
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:50,671
So when a a magnet receives either a
lot of heat or a very strong force,

478
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,320
uh,

479
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,570
it loses its magnetic pole.

480
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,340
But more importantly,

481
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,950
these magnets are made out
of rare earth elements.

482
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,590
Mine's like a cobalt a alloy.

483
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,190
Those things aren't really healthy to
take inside your body if it shatters.

484
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,390
So this is paralleling,

485
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,030
coded.

486
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,410
Some people use silicone,

487
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,303
um,

488
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,500
crazier people use hot glue.

489
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,140
Um,

490
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,550
and yeah,

491
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,630
so it's essentially,

492
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:14,890
it's,

493
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,920
it's poison.

494
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,181
You're,

495
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,420
you're dealing with a toxic.

496
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,240
Yeah.

497
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,360
So body when it's not covered,

498
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,310
when a Burstyn in her,

499
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:27,900
she actually consulted a
doctor and the doctor was like,

500
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:28,111
well,

501
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:28,944
here's the thing.

502
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,440
We could go through all the
trouble of pulling it out,

503
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,600
but it's so tiny and it's so little
that's really not going to bother you.

504
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,500
And so they left it in and
over the course of time,

505
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,140
that magnet pulled itself back together.

506
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,270
She never got the sense back,

507
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,310
but it pulled itself back together.

508
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:47,870
Yeah.

509
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,910
What's in it didn't harm her.

510
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,620
Creepy little creature.

511
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,410
If you guys are interested moving
around inside of her family,

512
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,161
she break it.

513
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,560
What'd she slap?

514
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:57,910
A cop car or something?

515
00:15:57,911 --> 00:15:58,440
How would you,

516
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,310
how did she shadowed?

517
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:01,270
She didn't say serious masturbation.

518
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:02,260
I have no idea.

519
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:07,261
Just furious possessed eyes
rolled back one shoe on screening.

520
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,190
Like a,

521
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,680
like a tiger cotton.

522
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,100
A Barb wire fence.

523
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,443
Hopefully it wasn't.

524
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,260
Yeah,

525
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,350
it could be cool.

526
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,280
I think that's what
happened if I had to guess,

527
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,580
but that usually doesn't happen with,

528
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,380
with the magnets this size,

529
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,560
you don't have a vagina,

530
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:27,460
so I wouldn't know.

531
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,460
How could you know what would happen
when a woman's in the middle of a furious

532
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:34,420
masturbation session

533
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,490
on thick fucking half a pound of meth?

534
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,880
Just slamming it home.

535
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,983
You never know.

536
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,420
Are you asking how can
we imagine what happened?

537
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,100
I can get shattered.

538
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,480
That's just a good a guess as any.

539
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,351
Yeah,

540
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,690
like maybe her orgasm was so strong.

541
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:55,030
It admitted and magnetic field mashed up.

542
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,170
Horny as fuck.

543
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,220
Maybe on top of an old
truck in the middle.

544
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,560
I'm just coming up with a scenario.

545
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,640
How do you did these are under,

546
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,050
these are under your fingers.

547
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:08,730
No,

548
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,880
that's a lot larger.

549
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,160
But if you guys are
curious to cock magnet.

550
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,090
Yeah,

551
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:13,361
yeah.

552
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:13,901
There you go.

553
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,250
So I need something for your cock.

554
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,370
That's neat.

555
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,540
You know,

556
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,260
just in a cleaner way of
expressing this question.

557
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,460
Um,

558
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,740
are there any gentleman perhaps that,

559
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:24,370
uh,

560
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,530
have these magnets putting
their nether regions?

561
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,520
I have no idea.

562
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,450
I don't know.

563
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:28,991
I think so.

564
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:29,980
It's been spoken about.

565
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,980
It's been spoken.

566
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,940
Has it been smoking or has it been
written on our website somewhere?

567
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,933
Uh,

568
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,060
it's been spoken about and you close,

569
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:39,850
you can get that to your
face to see the better.

570
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,100
You should live right
up to your face usually,

571
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,993
uh,

572
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,670
or move your chair a little bit
when it comes to stuff like that.

573
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,540
People talk about it and then,

574
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,000
and then don't do,

575
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,011
oh,

576
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:50,521
so they're saying,

577
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:50,940
hey man,

578
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,650
but thinking about
putting magnets in my car,

579
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,360
just so you started
thinking about their cock,

580
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,643
is that what they're doing?

581
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,440
That's what they're doing is and the,

582
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:58,400
and then your forest,

583
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:58,691
hate me.

584
00:17:58,691 --> 00:17:58,830
No,

585
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,161
Mike,

586
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,990
he's going to put
magazines cock to be like,

587
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:02,490
why are we sitting around
talking about Mike's car?

588
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,140
It's a lot of shit to
talk about in the world.

589
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,200
But Mike tricked us and Mike brought
up putting magnets in his cock.

590
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,370
He knows how to reach you guys.

591
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,181
Okay.

592
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:11,160
If he can't just talk about sex,

593
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,060
that's too easy.

594
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:12,601
No,

595
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:13,740
he has to talk about what,

596
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,760
what do you guys like?

597
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,320
You guys like putting
magnets in your body?

598
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,330
So he starts talking
about magnets his cock.

599
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,130
But people are in with like

600
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,913
absolutely,

601
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,380
totally serious.

602
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,191
This is,

603
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:26,911
I figured it out.

604
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:27,150
I'm,

605
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,640
I'm like Kojak or some shit.

606
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,830
But people already do that
with body modification.

607
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,460
You know,

608
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,540
they do write stuff.

609
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:33,900
Pierce,

610
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,250
I've seen allegedly seen some stuff
online and just horrible ideas.

611
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,890
You know that someone followed
through with drunk splits,

612
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:43,320
his cock and the guy.

613
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,770
Only one guy that's like saying
big foot's only one thing.

614
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,970
There's a lot of big foot.

615
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,860
You're saying more than one guy's
flying on an answer tonight.

616
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,640
Why would he do supercar?

617
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,000
It's supposed to feel phenomenal,

618
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:55,451
I suppose.

619
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:58,960
Doesn't it fall apart when you're having
to go hot dog that's been sliced and

620
00:18:58,961 --> 00:18:59,794
thrown on the grill?

621
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,530
It's kind of like shooting like a shotgun.

622
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,140
Oh,

623
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,090
Daniel says that.

624
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,130
Wow.

625
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:06,671
It's Christ.

626
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:06,900
Yeah.

627
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,330
Don't,

628
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,260
I think you guys are,

629
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,050
you caught your Dick and then you
just tell everybody it's awesome.

630
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,940
You don't want admit you're an idiot.

631
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,530
Is this like when they told me like we're
going to have a punch yourself in the

632
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,390
face contest and I had to start for

633
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,320
exactly preposterous.

634
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,910
You guys are are in a way,

635
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:29,911
what you're doing is you are turning
yourself into a lab rat with the intention

636
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:33,880
of gaining a kind of low level superpower,

637
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,130
like a really,

638
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:38,740
really low on the scale of super powers,

639
00:19:38,741 --> 00:19:42,220
the ability to feel EMF fields.

640
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,090
Is that what they're called?

641
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,630
Yeah,

642
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,880
he did feel that that's
a really low power,

643
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:46,714
but it's still,

644
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,940
you have more super powers than me.

645
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,630
I can't feel that you're still ahead
of the majority of your species,

646
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,370
but there's a risk to this.

647
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:59,371
You're risking your life so that
you can feel what it's like to be a

648
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:01,060
refrigerator magnet.

649
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,830
Anything that you put in your body,

650
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:04,630
you risk getting sepsis from.

651
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,400
There's a risk of sepsis.

652
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:07,480
So yeah,

653
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,350
there is a risk.

654
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,820
What exactly the Sepsis,

655
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,560
the sounds except Dick,

656
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,031
what does it mean?

657
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:17,800
It means some sort of infection and the
way bacterial infections of any sort.

658
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,640
So I've had a buddy who's
a surgeon who told me,

659
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,211
hey,

660
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:22,901
don't do this.

661
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:23,920
This is a bad idea.

662
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,151
Good for you.

663
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:25,990
You got that done.

664
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:30,991
But don't put anything else in your body
because any implant can go septic can

665
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:31,951
go bad.

666
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:32,784
Yeah.

667
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,830
I got my nose pierced and
Venice beach when I was 15.

668
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:37,360
And you should have seen that man,

669
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,020
you swell up.

670
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,380
Oh my God.

671
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:39,650
You know,

672
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,740
was just so nasty,

673
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:41,951
man.

674
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:42,420
My it,

675
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,990
my nose got swollen.

676
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,980
I pushed,

677
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,960
I remember pushing against
it in front of the mirror.

678
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,250
Just like the

679
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,360
amount of pus,

680
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:52,030
like where you get proud of
the amount of pus coming out,

681
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:52,571
you know,

682
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:54,010
that can kill people,

683
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,690
staff like that.

684
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57,580
And then ones of eating
your whole nose off.

685
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,331
Oh yeah man,

686
00:20:58,331 --> 00:20:59,021
I got lucky.

687
00:20:59,021 --> 00:20:59,291
You know,

688
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,790
you should never get your nose pierce.

689
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,260
That's a ridiculous thing.

690
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:02,860
But,

691
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,210
and there's no super power in that and
you just look like a dumb ass what he

692
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:08,044
said.

693
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:08,651
Um,

694
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:09,484
with them.

695
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,510
Um,

696
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,260
so this is a changeable
extra cents though,

697
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,930
this disability to
detect a magnetic field.

698
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:17,560
I mean,

699
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,220
you really tend to do something
that Dunkin or I can't
with your body because of

700
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:21,830
these additions.

701
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,340
It's,

702
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:22,880
it's,

703
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,320
it's profound.

704
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:27,020
It's something I didn't
understand when I got it done.

705
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,250
Um,

706
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,680
what started out like feeling bubbles?

707
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,753
Um,

708
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,840
now like,

709
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,703
uh,

710
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,600
I'll go to home depot and I'll
be feeling stuff because it's,

711
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,330
oh my God.

712
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,580
So fun to feel stuff.

713
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,540
Fuel,

714
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,101
nice person.

715
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,120
He's feeling mainly magnetics

716
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,490
freak hanging around,

717
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:47,350
home depot touching all this stuff.

718
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,461
Oh my gosh.

719
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:49,080
It's like you're ill.

720
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,680
Oh No.

721
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:53,450
But just hands down by the lawn mowers.

722
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,420
The magnetic field.

723
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,720
Oh,

724
00:21:59,530 --> 00:21:59,711
hey.

725
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:00,640
What's your favorite?

726
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:03,430
This means you probably have
like people our favorite flavors.

727
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,660
Do you have a favorite machine you
like to put your fingers in there?

728
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,173
Um,

729
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,950
I've had situations like I,

730
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,600
I've been around really strong
magnets and when the first,

731
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:15,290
uh,

732
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,970
was around a really strong magnet,

733
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,040
I felt a feeling in the pit of my stomach,

734
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,260
like dread and,

735
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,830
and it made me want to pull away
and run away from it as your word.

736
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,660
Clinked no,

737
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:28,130
it wasn't a logical thing.

738
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,143
It wasn't,

739
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,230
it wasn't a logic.

740
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,640
You know,

741
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,640
the funny thing about that is I'm
working out what our sensitivities are.

742
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:41,550
There's been a lot of debate among the
people who've had these things on how,

743
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,790
how close we can get to an MRI.

744
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,690
There are some people who talk about
it being dangerous because it can,

745
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,400
you can move around.

746
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,110
Since this is subdermal,

747
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,860
it's not anchored in any way like
a other subdermal a body mods are,

748
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,310
um,

749
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,190
it could move your magnet a bit,

750
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:02,180
one way or another,

751
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,440
someone's got to test it.

752
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,521
But,

753
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:04,940
uh,

754
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,830
there are people who've claimed,

755
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:07,940
uh,

756
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,773
uh,

757
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,930
through the network of
people who install these.

758
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,860
There are people who have claimed that
they've had a Mris done and felt their

759
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,450
magnet dance around and that's it.

760
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,050
Wow.

761
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,280
But the Mris,

762
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:21,980
a super powerful magnet
that you're talking about,

763
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:22,490
that tiny

764
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,990
ones are like 1.5,

765
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,340
1.5 Teslas.

766
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,270
But people go into those
things with sweater.

767
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:31,160
Is sweatshirts with the zippers on them?

768
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:31,730
They do.

769
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,370
Yeah.

770
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,370
I talked to a guy who operates
when in research facility and you,

771
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,380
that's why I'm like,

772
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,200
funny you should mention this because,

773
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,120
but that's not standard
operational procedures.

774
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,100
1.5 post it.

775
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:45,300
You supposed to get down to robe.

776
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,790
I just had one a couple of days ago.

777
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,940
He take your clothes off that you don't,

778
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:50,281
you don't go.

779
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:52,010
You sure they weren't
just fucking with you?

780
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,720
Are you sure you don't know anything
about MRI magnets and stolen your hand?

781
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,280
That's crazy man.

782
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:01,130
You don't go in there with zippers on
what kind of a fucking doctor these people

783
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,730
going to,

784
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,870
it's a research facility.

785
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:03,704
It's not.

786
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,410
Joe,

787
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,780
can I get what you said?

788
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:07,460
Someone's died from an MRI.

789
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,294
What is that?

790
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,541
Well,

791
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:12,470
I was trying to say is if you have metal
in the room when they turn the MRI on a

792
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:16,850
child died recently accidentally because
they had an oxygen tank and the room

793
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:18,680
and they weren't aware
they had it in there.

794
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,600
So when you turn on the MRI,

795
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,080
the fucking oxygen tank comes
flying into the machine.

796
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,943
Ah,

797
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,491
giant,

798
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:29,900
super powerful magnet and it killed
them by the time they could shut it off,

799
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:30,620
he was already dead.

800
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,890
I mean it's insane amount of pressure
you're dealing with and it's just cause

801
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:35,720
someone's dumb enough to
have metal in the room.

802
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,450
So I really find it hard to believe that
any doctor would allow someone to go

803
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:39,860
through an Mri with a zipper on.

804
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,000
That's preposterous.

805
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:41,960
That's just not what they do.

806
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,200
So I question who you're talking to.

807
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,180
Him talking to crazy people lying about
putting magnets in their dicks and

808
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:49,350
wearing zippers into Mri.

809
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:50,184
So you gotta hang it.

810
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,650
You've got to hang out
with a higher quality.

811
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,803
Grew up with humans,

812
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,930
a higher quality room.

813
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:54,690
But,

814
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,440
but there is,

815
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,640
there is a magnetic shielding cause
you know people that have pacemakers or

816
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:00,474
other implants.

817
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,630
Oh they put like something
over you to stop that.

818
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,040
No suit or something like that.

819
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:04,770
Yeah.

820
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,480
Huh.

821
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,051
That's interesting.

822
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:07,160
But you're not doing
that with your fingers.

823
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:11,140
You just let him tingle if you get in
there allegedly don't know and somebody

824
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,230
really should be careful about.

825
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,020
But I think,

826
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,810
I think,

827
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,230
I think it's something
that should be tested.

828
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,240
I think if we've even,

829
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:19,074
even if you're not,

830
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,100
I'm not advocating that someone with
this in their finger go in and test it,

831
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:24,000
but you know,

832
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:28,110
even if you can replicate the
consistency of human and put,

833
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:28,680
uh,

834
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,700
like a human flesh,

835
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:29,970
right,

836
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,970
demand it in and then expose it to
something like 1.5 Tesla just to see what

837
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:36,294
happens.

838
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,410
Now you have this which you've
already done with the magnets.

839
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,201
What is,

840
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:43,490
what's the next level thing?

841
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,080
Obviously everything progresses.

842
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,681
So what did,

843
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:47,570
what are people considering doing now?

844
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,270
So,

845
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:48,900
um,

846
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,220
we're doing well,

847
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,790
a lot of people are building
devices that interact with a magnet.

848
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,040
So you can think of it as a,

849
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,190
because it interacts with
electricity and magnetism.

850
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,590
It's kind of like a
really low level input.

851
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,820
You can input anything.

852
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,530
Uh,

853
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,600
so if you've got an external
device that's measuring,

854
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:09,810
say the amount of co two in the room,

855
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,050
you could hook that up through
a coil around your finger,

856
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,501
around your,

857
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:18,501
your magnet finger and have
that information transferred
into like pulses or how

858
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:21,540
much it vibrates or whatever.

859
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,870
So you're literally using an
external sensor to to give you data,

860
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,893
any data,

861
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,070
any data you want and have it
transfer that to the magnet.

862
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,450
And after,

863
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:35,640
after some training it becomes intuitive.

864
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:36,931
So,

865
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:37,764
uh,

866
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,191
you know,

867
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:41,400
some people have done it with
mainly sonar and thermal,

868
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,030
like a,

869
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,080
like a thermal laser.

870
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,090
Now I know that people have
talked about the ultimate,

871
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,180
the all the,

872
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:54,870
the ultimate future of incorporating
technology and the human body as the

873
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:59,790
ability to take the mind and download
it's consciousness somewhere into a,

874
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,200
an artificial creation.

875
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,140
But somewhere along the line is
probably going to be some steps.

876
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:04,974
Right?

877
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,210
And you guys are kind of
taking like one of the steps,

878
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,610
like by putting magnets in your body.

879
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,030
When do you think you're going to see
someone who puts a cell phone in their

880
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:15,360
body?

881
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,193
Is that coming?

882
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,410
Is it going to be like a neural interface
that allows you to get online with

883
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:20,244
Wifi?

884
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,333
Well,

885
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,470
we're somewhere towards that.

886
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,930
That's something else we're working on.

887
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,771
So,

888
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:27,604
um,

889
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,170
our CTO,

890
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,221
his dream,

891
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:33,850
the thing that brought us
all together wasn't magnets.

892
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,570
That was,

893
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,650
that was ancillary.

894
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,760
He was love,

895
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,151
right?

896
00:27:37,151 --> 00:27:37,391
Yeah.

897
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:37,841
Well,

898
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:42,310
of course it was love because we all kind
of knew each other and we all had this

899
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:47,140
love of the future and we all kind of
were told to sit back and let Motorola

900
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,243
take care of it.

901
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,280
And none of us wanted to deal with that.

902
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,000
Um,

903
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
but he wanted to build something that he
believed that we have the ability to do

904
00:27:58,181 --> 00:27:59,320
this stuff ourselves.

905
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:01,630
We don't have to wait for
some big company to do it.

906
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,070
We can do it cheap.

907
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,150
We can do it ourselves,

908
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:05,110
design ourselves.

909
00:28:05,111 --> 00:28:09,040
And since we know people who can
install magnets under our skin,

910
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,810
why not and implant?

911
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,793
Why not something?

912
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,360
Well,

913
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,710
the goal was to have something.

914
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,550
So basically what it does is a,

915
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:17,950
it,

916
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,783
it's a,

917
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,990
it's a rose compass,

918
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,830
uh,

919
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,450
that electrically stimulates you.

920
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:22,620
It's,

921
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,070
it's probably here on your cath and
it's always pointing north so that you

922
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:29,740
always have an intuitive
sense of where north is.

923
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,360
Now if you've got,

924
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,570
if you've got the chip talking
to some external thing,

925
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,780
you could hook it up to a map
system like Google maps and be like,

926
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:38,230
Yo,

927
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,063
take me home.

928
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,940
And then you have an intuitive
sense of where home is always,

929
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,823
wow,

930
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,890
wait a minute.

931
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,073
What?

932
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,140
Hold on.

933
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,580
Wait back that up.

934
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,320
You have a compass and stalled
in your body and the body,

935
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,280
how does it run?

936
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,770
It just runs on the magnetism
that's in the compass.

937
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:57,820
It's all mechanical.

938
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,100
Is that electronics involved?

939
00:28:59,101 --> 00:28:59,380
Right.

940
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,730
It can be powered wirelessly.

941
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:01,030
So it's,

942
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:05,290
it's got like a wireless coil in it and
it's powered somehow by an external.

943
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,740
Yeah.

944
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,031
Okay.

945
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:06,131
Yeah.

946
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:07,570
And so you can like hover it over it.

947
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:07,780
That's,

948
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,640
that's what the dream is.

949
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:14,370
And what is the method of communication
to the mind that explains where newer

950
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,970
north is or how to get home.

951
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,010
It's uh,

952
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,560
in the same way that you're using a really
simple system in terms of the magnet,

953
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:21,550
you're not using any magic.

954
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,350
It's just vibrating for this.

955
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,760
It's just applying a very,

956
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:28,540
very small amount of
electricity enough that you can,

957
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:28,930
there's,

958
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,190
there's a sensation so it's not like
blaring and it's not shocking you,

959
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:34,540
but there is a sensation.

960
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,980
Is this completely theoretical,

961
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:38,980
the idea of being able to find
your way home or is there any we,

962
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,850
we have,

963
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,390
uh,

964
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,223
parts of it,

965
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,190
parts of it built.

966
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,130
And actually when we came
together and we had that idea,

967
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:45,881
we said,

968
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:46,151
okay,

969
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,190
this thing has way too many features.

970
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:50,480
So what we're gonna do is
we're going to build a,

971
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,360
we're going to build an implant that's
kind of a halfway step to there so that

972
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,480
we build the ground,

973
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,110
uh,

974
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,621
towards it.

975
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:57,490
And that's actually,

976
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,720
it's actually this thing here.

977
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,710
And so what this thing
does is it actually,

978
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,480
it's a quantified self,

979
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,040
a health metric.

980
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,690
And this is,

981
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:11,260
uh,

982
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,430
this is just going to take data.

983
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,323
You can check this out.

984
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:15,911
This,

985
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:16,240
uh,

986
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,720
takes medical data and
sends it to your phone.

987
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,123
Uh,

988
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,030
so if you can imagine having
maybe six months worth of,

989
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:25,301
uh,

990
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:27,910
of your medical data and it's your data,

991
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:29,140
it's not anyone else's data,

992
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,093
your data,

993
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,240
um,

994
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,350
and you can do whatever with it.

995
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,550
Uh,

996
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,070
and so we wanted to kind of make,

997
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:37,380
do,

998
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,560
do a halfway project so that we get
familiar with implant technology and then

999
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,780
move towards really cool shit.

1000
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,741
The,

1001
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:44,941
I,

1002
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:45,510
I d I,

1003
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,540
I understand.

1004
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,110
Um,

1005
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,970
the idea of a compass,

1006
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,330
I understand that you,

1007
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,000
you could power it somehow,

1008
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,270
but what I don't understand is how the
compass is communicating with your mind.

1009
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,210
So in the,

1010
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,630
in the same way that,

1011
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,200
uh,

1012
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,490
the nervous system is,

1013
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,370
is communicating with your mind.

1014
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:04,060
It's not,

1015
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,893
uh,

1016
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,740
it's not sending it wirelessly
to your brain right there.

1017
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:12,190
There are things in your body that's
communicating to your nervous system that

1018
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:13,090
then goes to your mind,

1019
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:13,510
right?

1020
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,620
And so you're literally,

1021
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:15,670
uh,

1022
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,750
you're literally making
a new mini Oregon that,

1023
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,260
uh,

1024
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,490
or another part of your
body that interfaces with
your nervous system through

1025
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,324
electricity.

1026
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,150
And then

1027
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,160
you're just saying it's like
a vibration or something.

1028
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:30,110
It's like a low level pulse or something.

1029
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:30,440
Right?

1030
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,273
It's a low level.

1031
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,840
I understand that.

1032
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:35,060
I understand that you
would get a sensation,

1033
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:37,010
but I don't understand how
it could be directional.

1034
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,210
I don't see the mechanism.

1035
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:38,600
Well,

1036
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:38,900
it's,

1037
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,381
it's a,

1038
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:40,610
it's a rose compass,

1039
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:40,970
right?

1040
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,410
So what does a rose compass mean?

1041
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,343
It's a,

1042
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,700
so it's got a clock.

1043
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,151
Yeah.

1044
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:46,260
It's got a north,

1045
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:46,741
south,

1046
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:47,011
east,

1047
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:47,431
west,

1048
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:48,780
and then northwest.

1049
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,171
Oh,

1050
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:50,360
that's called the rose compass.

1051
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:50,640
Yeah.

1052
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,240
Okay.

1053
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,380
Oh,

1054
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,081
so it's a compass.

1055
00:31:52,081 --> 00:31:52,500
Yeah.

1056
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,001
And yeah,

1057
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:53,131
it's,

1058
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:53,341
it's,

1059
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:54,174
it's a compass.

1060
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,193
And so,

1061
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,500
uh,

1062
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,333
let's say,

1063
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,750
let's say I'm facing north,

1064
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,120
the stimulation will be going this way,

1065
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,163
right?

1066
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,850
But if I,

1067
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,840
if I turn,

1068
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,763
it's gonna Start.

1069
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,380
So start,

1070
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:06,860
stimulate.

1071
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,150
It's directional.

1072
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:10,130
It's direct that wherever the north is,

1073
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:12,680
it gives a signal or warning
where the Arrow goes.

1074
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,030
Yeah.

1075
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,600
So narrow and not just,

1076
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,160
doesn't just act as a beacon.

1077
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:20,510
It's somehow or another like sends a
charge off in that direction and then it

1078
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:21,920
becomes intuitive.

1079
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:25,340
Once you start determining
what that signal means,

1080
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,560
like it becomes a new thing,

1081
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:30,110
sorta like sound like you hear
sound over here and you know,

1082
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:31,100
it's coming in that direction.

1083
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,970
So it's crazy intuitive

1084
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,410
in the sense that like I
would be working with a,

1085
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,220
with some of the guys in the lab and you
know they've got two or three implants

1086
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,840
and they would say leave the soldering
iron on and they'd go to reach to grab

1087
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:47,440
something and just them feeling this,

1088
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,000
the,

1089
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,630
the intensity of the soldering
iron would make them pull back.

1090
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,380
Right.

1091
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,760
And so it's not like they're like,

1092
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,840
oh shit that,

1093
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,130
that might kill me.

1094
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:55,881
Let me pull back.

1095
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,714
It's more like,

1096
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,830
it's more like every time you reach
over here something screams at you or,

1097
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:02,180
or something like pokes you,

1098
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,240
it's like people who are allergic to cats,

1099
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,510
if you're around the you,

1100
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,590
that's a kind of superpower
a person is allergic to.

1101
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:14,020
Cats can walk into a house and be like,

1102
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,161
you have cats,

1103
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:15,550
right?

1104
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,330
You have cats.

1105
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,080
They can sense the cat cause
they start sneezing and coughing.

1106
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,470
You're dirty and you know,

1107
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:21,304
clean your house.

1108
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:21,701
Yeah.

1109
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:23,100
Well generally people have cats,

1110
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:23,934
cats,

1111
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,450
gross,

1112
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,250
a little creatures.

1113
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,781
He felt it.

1114
00:33:25,781 --> 00:33:29,530
When you walk into a house and you get
that first waft of the cat litter box and

1115
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:31,300
mixing it with Old Bananas.

1116
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,041
So Nice.

1117
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:34,110
You have a box of shit
in your house at night.

1118
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,970
Nice dirty vox as shit
and have had a filthy,

1119
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:40,420
which animal want peering out at
you from the wall ready to smother.

1120
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:43,150
Your baby won't sleep and
suck the breadth right out.

1121
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,160
Are you guys going to destroy cats?

1122
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,143
That's awesome.

1123
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,983
Um,

1124
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:52,380
I think this people like you make me
love existing today because the idea that

1125
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:56,260
there are human beings
at this very moment,

1126
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:58,310
and I picture you in a basement in,

1127
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,150
in basements with straight razors,

1128
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,260
shaking,

1129
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:07,410
cutting themselves open and just putting
chips inside of their doctors and have

1130
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,061
all this done,

1131
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:08,894
man.

1132
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,323
Fantasy

1133
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,460
leather straps download twig.

1134
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,340
Now.

1135
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:17,580
Well,

1136
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,640
guys are both right.

1137
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:19,840
You're both kind of rights.

1138
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,670
They don't all go to a dog.

1139
00:34:21,671 --> 00:34:22,780
What doctor do you go to?

1140
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:26,140
What doctor do you guys
go to feel good or evil?

1141
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,063
Dr Evil.

1142
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:27,721
And,

1143
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:27,970
and,

1144
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,930
and I imagine that when before you guys
put the magnets and you're snorting

1145
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:36,040
oxycontin or like you're
definitely on painkillers,

1146
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,903
right?

1147
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,590
I got it done with no pain meds and uh,

1148
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:41,830
oh my gosh.

1149
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,693
Um,

1150
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:43,680
it was a rush.

1151
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,760
I never had that much.

1152
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,880
That's a new man do to stay down there
with a razor blade in the photo says,

1153
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,250
I got to tell him without
painkillers and oh my gosh,

1154
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,233
what a rush.

1155
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,881
I don't.

1156
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:54,714
It was,

1157
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,560
was,

1158
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,311
it was something else.

1159
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:57,360
He mounted with endorphins.

1160
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:57,751
He got,

1161
00:34:57,751 --> 00:34:58,370
it's,

1162
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,203
it's trauma,

1163
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,971
it's trauma.

1164
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:04,140
Your body is going through trauma and
your body releases all that endorphins all

1165
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:04,974
at once.

1166
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,030
You,

1167
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,700
you,

1168
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,531
you definitely,

1169
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:09,920
you don't remember the fact
that you just got hurt?

1170
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,250
I don't,

1171
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,250
I don't advocate people doing this to
advocate in the opening themselves up at

1172
00:35:17,371 --> 00:35:18,030
all.

1173
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,820
Uh,

1174
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,290
that's not going to stop anybody.

1175
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,400
It's too late right now.

1176
00:35:21,401 --> 00:35:26,401
There's already 700 teens with exacto
knives putting their dad's wristwatch

1177
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:28,730
Bandana in mouth and tongue.

1178
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,080
But kids,

1179
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:33,740
if you're watching this
like seriously slate,

1180
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,583
don't kill.

1181
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,700
It never ends.

1182
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:36,300
Well,

1183
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,190
someone already it and they're kind

1184
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,240
of fucked up because of it.

1185
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,133
So tried what?

1186
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,070
Um,

1187
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,341
uh,

1188
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:44,130
so one of the people that pioneered this,

1189
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,730
uh,

1190
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,563
this,

1191
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:45,991
this,

1192
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:46,470
uh,

1193
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,930
lady out in Scotland
called lapse and an him,

1194
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,680
she did this talk called
cybernetics for the masses,

1195
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,023
um,

1196
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,620
where she advocating,

1197
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,300
you know,

1198
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,680
implants and uh,

1199
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,120
she did it herself.

1200
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:00,511
She,

1201
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:01,680
she sterilized,

1202
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,023
uh,

1203
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:03,961
what did she,

1204
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:04,560
she used,

1205
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,640
she used vodka.

1206
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:08,640
She uses vodka and hot
glue to coat the magnets.

1207
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,803
She uh,

1208
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,090
in her speech she told everyone,

1209
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,930
hey,

1210
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,060
I don't care how hardcore
you think you are.

1211
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,170
Get a spotter.

1212
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,500
Yeah.

1213
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,640
And as you will pass out.

1214
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,480
And that,

1215
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,320
that to me,

1216
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:19,861
that to me,

1217
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:21,690
she also used a vegetable peeler

1218
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,233
to me.

1219
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,040
That to me is not,

1220
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,290
is not DIY cybernetics.

1221
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,490
That's irresponsible.

1222
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,723
It's Bailey.

1223
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,760
I'm going to tell you that
when you told me her name,

1224
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,310
you don't leave at home with your keys.

1225
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:39,110
I've seen that speeds weapon and I
emailed her directly after this speech

1226
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,210
because I wanted to get her on my podcast,

1227
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,841
but she,

1228
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:42,201
first of all,

1229
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,060
I didn't know she was a she
cause she's Androgynous,

1230
00:36:44,061 --> 00:36:44,960
you can't really tell,

1231
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,650
but she looks like she fell
out of a Philip k Dick novel.

1232
00:36:48,651 --> 00:36:52,160
Like she is a really fascinating being.

1233
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:56,000
Like it's a really curious being and
she seems kind of nonchalant about what

1234
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:59,510
she's doing and it reminds me of you guys
a little bit because you guys seem to

1235
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:04,280
be brushing off the fact that what you're
doing can make it so that in 20 years

1236
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,770
you are just basically a
trembling drink machines.

1237
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:12,590
Somebody could put a cocktail in your
hand and makes it up because you have some

1238
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:16,370
kind of severe neurological damage from
the weird chemicals in your magnets

1239
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,630
going into your brain.

1240
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,801
It could be true.

1241
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:19,400
You're right.

1242
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,000
You're right.

1243
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,833
Totally right.

1244
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,960
We probably would be dealing
with something worse than
a Parkinson's like state.

1245
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,660
We cannot get up on the mic.

1246
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:28,850
I'm sorry.

1247
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,290
That's okay.

1248
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:29,900
Um,

1249
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,890
you're right.

1250
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,343
There are risks.

1251
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,193
Um,

1252
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,120
when left gave that speech,

1253
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:39,140
he gave it with the intent that people
out there would see her process and go,

1254
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,041
oh my God,

1255
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:41,270
you could do it so much better.

1256
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,650
You could do it so much safer.

1257
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,360
And when people are talking about what
grindings about and why it's called

1258
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:48,194
grinding,

1259
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:53,060
that's part of part of the spirit of
being a grinder is being open about your

1260
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:57,020
processes because you're
hoping that someone will look
at your processes and go,

1261
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:57,891
Oh yeah,

1262
00:37:57,891 --> 00:37:58,671
I see what you did.

1263
00:37:58,671 --> 00:37:59,840
I see how you made it better.

1264
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,770
I can make it even
better and even more so.

1265
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,663
Why Grindr?

1266
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,790
Um,

1267
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,541
so it,

1268
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:10,160
it originates from a comic book
called Doctor Sleepless and uh,

1269
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,350
there's a great guys a door.

1270
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:13,581
No,

1271
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:14,570
they're not door.

1272
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:15,290
It's awesome.

1273
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,120
I want to be a bad thing,

1274
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,300
but you guys are dorks and so there's,

1275
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:20,290
there's not a dork.

1276
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,260
So bad thing.

1277
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,650
These are pioneer dork too.

1278
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,740
How dare you.

1279
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,281
You're a Dork.

1280
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:28,250
I guess I am a Dork because that right
now you read walking dead comic books.

1281
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:29,320
You're a dork now,

1282
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:29,601
man.

1283
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:31,460
That's into tell me I
have to read a tense.

1284
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,900
Do you got to read him?

1285
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:33,963
He's a Dork.

1286
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,000
That does nothing wrong.

1287
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,601
It man.

1288
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:36,100
The son Ronald,

1289
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,611
being a Dork.

1290
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:37,750
Don't be scared of being a Dork.

1291
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:38,351
Oh,

1292
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:38,621
okay.

1293
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:39,050
Well fine.

1294
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm a dork too.

1295
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,560
I'd rather be a Dork with magnets under
my fingers are not going to be a Dork.

1296
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:46,060
I like to be a Dork with a low,

1297
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,781
bad to be a door.

1298
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:50,650
But the fact that you guys call
yourself grinders out of a comic book,

1299
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,970
that's clearly pretty Dorky,

1300
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,470
but it's not bad.

1301
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,780
[inaudible] you embrace being a Dork.

1302
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:56,620
I'm,

1303
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,460
I think the term Dork is a dorky term.

1304
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:00,731
No,

1305
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:01,630
it's an awesome term.

1306
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,860
And that's what we were when we're
out there looking for bigfoot.

1307
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,670
We were two dorks here,

1308
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:10,901
by the way,

1309
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:13,380
having a time of our
lives with fuck doors.

1310
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,300
There's nothing wrong with being a door.

1311
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,780
There's no disrespect intended,

1312
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:17,614
no disrespect.

1313
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:17,840
It's,

1314
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,140
it's,

1315
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,640
you know,

1316
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,880
you're not taking yourself that seriously.

1317
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,900
You never in your whole
group after college.

1318
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,200
Yeah.

1319
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,501
Uh,

1320
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:24,010
part of,

1321
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:24,131
uh,

1322
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:25,510
part of what we do is,

1323
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:26,344
um,

1324
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,300
is using,

1325
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,800
we're still using the scientific method.

1326
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:30,640
We're not just like,

1327
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,833
sure.

1328
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,913
Well,

1329
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,390
what we're doing is we're putting our
method out there for it to be criticized

1330
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:38,900
so that it's safe in,

1331
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:39,880
in our community.

1332
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,480
Right.

1333
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,260
And we're,

1334
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,040
it's not,

1335
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,450
uh,

1336
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:42,791
you know,

1337
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:45,430
cut yourself open with
vegetable peelers and it's not,

1338
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,960
it's not have,

1339
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,501
it's not,

1340
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:51,160
have the method be held up
by the FDA for 50 years.

1341
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,400
It's about knowing what the risks are
as an individual and deciding whether to

1342
00:39:58,091 --> 00:39:58,840
take it or not.

1343
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,673
That's that piece of it.

1344
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,511
Plastics,

1345
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:01,151
silicon,

1346
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:01,811
whatever it is.

1347
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:01,981
What it,

1348
00:40:01,981 --> 00:40:02,860
what does that exactly mean?

1349
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:04,090
I don't think you showed
me earlier the chip.

1350
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,040
Oh,

1351
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,690
that's,

1352
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,460
that's regular circuit board.

1353
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:12,850
There's all sorts of bad shit
and therefore women wasn't
made out of fiberglass,

1354
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,610
copper or metal plastics.

1355
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,470
Where would you put that?

1356
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,060
Inside a a silicone silicone shape.

1357
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:21,350
There was a bio proofing process,

1358
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:22,184
like a sheath,

1359
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:22,860
um,

1360
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,580
like a condom,

1361
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,130
silicone condom sort of thing.

1362
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,971
More like a,

1363
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:26,540
uh,

1364
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,380
something more secure.

1365
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,120
You take a CNC,

1366
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,740
you make a CNC mold,

1367
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,580
uh,

1368
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,031
reverse.

1369
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:36,470
So this isn't an unpopulated board
because all of our regular prototypes are

1370
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:37,370
being tested.

1371
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,630
Um,

1372
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:43,180
who on on four function
functionability functionality,

1373
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,031
functionality,

1374
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:44,450
it,

1375
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:44,811
Keating,

1376
00:40:44,811 --> 00:40:46,100
it crushing it.

1377
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:51,950
So once we're confident that we have like
something that can handle the stresses

1378
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:53,120
that we think,

1379
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:53,931
uh,

1380
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:57,200
someone who would have
something in it for a year,

1381
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,430
which is our goal.

1382
00:40:58,431 --> 00:41:00,890
Like get it inside someone
for a year and take it out.

1383
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,500
Then we're testing bio proofing.

1384
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,010
Bio proofing is doing a
pressure injected silicone mold.

1385
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,610
Oh Wow.

1386
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,870
That's just sounds like it would hurt.

1387
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,810
Do you guys have in your
car that's not inside you?

1388
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:14,644
You

1389
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,690
want to know though is like what part of
the body would you install this thing?

1390
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,880
Well,

1391
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,810
Tim's been talking about the forearm.

1392
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,773
Why the forum?

1393
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,820
Because it would be cool to look down
at your arm and see LED's lighten up

1394
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:30,910
underneath your skin.

1395
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:31,410
Yeah.

1396
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,191
So that's part of it.

1397
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:34,160
You guys aren't just pioneers trying

1398
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,230
to read a fine humanity.

1399
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:39,060
You just want to have shining
lights under your scan.

1400
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,270
Some dork pussy.

1401
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,350
Let's be honest.

1402
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,250
We are Jeff,

1403
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,530
many different types of

1404
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:47,871
dead man.

1405
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:48,131
If you're,

1406
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,270
you're a super baller in
the grinder community.

1407
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:52,550
If you walk around with a
glowing implant on your arm.

1408
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,390
Yeah.

1409
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,600
Do you guys have a,

1410
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,460
in your community,

1411
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:56,990
somebody who you know,

1412
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,850
will put anything under their skin,

1413
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:02,930
like somebody who walks around
Jangling with metal pieces and lights.

1414
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:03,741
Is there,

1415
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:05,870
is there a person who's
got the most implants?

1416
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,170
Uh,

1417
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,003
no I don't.

1418
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,840
I don't think we've reached there yet.

1419
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,560
What's the most incredible,

1420
00:42:11,561 --> 00:42:14,230
like the most extreme
implant that you're aware of?

1421
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,483
Maybe rich.

1422
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:16,760
Yeah.

1423
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,230
Probably fucking rich.

1424
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,030
Rich is going on with rich.

1425
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,051
So,

1426
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:21,380
uh,

1427
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,213
he's got,

1428
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:22,880
uh,

1429
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,600
he's got,

1430
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,433
uh,

1431
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,800
two magnet implants in his
finger and he actually has,

1432
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,663
um,

1433
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,710
he has a coil,

1434
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,870
like a huge coil that he uses to,

1435
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:33,704
uh,

1436
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:38,330
to be able to like hear radio
stations and all sorts of craziness.

1437
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,520
They're basically implanted earphones.

1438
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,301
Wait a minute.

1439
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:41,930
When he has,

1440
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,450
he has magnets on his fingers.

1441
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,900
Ears in his ears.

1442
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,411
Ears.

1443
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:45,590
Yes.

1444
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,081
Magnets.

1445
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:46,250
Yeah.

1446
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:46,910
Yeah.

1447
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,650
So he's got his fingers in his ears.

1448
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:49,330
Xochi said.

1449
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:49,571
Yeah,

1450
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:50,340
he's got,

1451
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,160
um,

1452
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,480
he's got like two minutes.

1453
00:42:52,481 --> 00:42:53,314
Ears,

1454
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:53,681
ears.

1455
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:53,981
Man.

1456
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:54,850
That's scary.

1457
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,043
Yeah.

1458
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:56,670
Yeah.

1459
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,590
They'll use easy to operate on your ears.

1460
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,433
He's intense.

1461
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,533
He's intense.

1462
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,860
And so what's the coil?

1463
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,970
The coil is a,

1464
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,870
like a,

1465
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,703
any coil.

1466
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,650
It's stimulating these magnets
makes of magnet vibrate.

1467
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,500
So he hooked up this coil to a,

1468
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:15,400
a little amplifier and that
amplifier sending sound through it,

1469
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,420
like a,

1470
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,500
your standard speaker,

1471
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,190
right?

1472
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:18,490
Right.

1473
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,340
You send sound through a speaker coil,

1474
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:25,030
it make some magnet jump back or makes a
magnet a forced the coil back and forth

1475
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,933
and you make sound.

1476
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,820
So he's using this,

1477
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:28,300
uh,

1478
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,460
sending electromagnetic waves to,

1479
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:31,120
uh,

1480
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,290
the magnets in his ears,

1481
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,180
his magnet stance around,

1482
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,560
and they give them sound.

1483
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:36,700
So he was able to,

1484
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:37,534
uh,

1485
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,750
use a Bluetooth connection to his phone
to hear his phone through as invisible,

1486
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:45,290
uh,

1487
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,123
your phones.

1488
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,450
That's insane.

1489
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:47,841
Yeah.

1490
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:48,674
So,

1491
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:49,340
yeah,

1492
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:49,610
it,

1493
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,560
it sounds really crazy and dangerous,

1494
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:52,190
but I think,

1495
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:52,851
I think there's,

1496
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:57,140
we're also trying to establish
a precedent that we want.

1497
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,610
Like we,

1498
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,100
no matter what organization pops up,

1499
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,290
there's going to be cyborgs in the future.

1500
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,393
And I,

1501
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,343
I think,

1502
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,860
I think that that's what we're listing.

1503
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,230
That's what we're moving towards.

1504
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,130
And I think that we want to move
to a future where people are openly

1505
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:17,030
experimenting with themselves instead
of having to go to one source.

1506
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:17,870
Uh,

1507
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,560
you know,

1508
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,740
like company x to get their implants.

1509
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:22,820
And I think there's,

1510
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:28,270
there's a sort of liberation that you
have by either making your own implant or

1511
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,274
knowing,

1512
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,100
knowing what

1513
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,060
it was made of,

1514
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,170
who coded it,

1515
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,090
what the code is and,

1516
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,230
and all sorts of stuff.

1517
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:38,340
So in our community,

1518
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:41,050
we share all of the information there is,

1519
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:45,960
there is no weird outside control because
everyone knows how it was built and if

1520
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:46,920
you don't like how it was built,

1521
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:47,760
you can change it.

1522
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:49,101
Cyborg,

1523
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:50,090
if you wear glasses,

1524
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,290
is the Nordi incorporation of
technology into the human body.

1525
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,770
I try to avoid like the word
Cyborg because the moment
that people start saying

1526
00:44:58,771 --> 00:44:59,604
Cyborg,

1527
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:00,481
everyone's like,

1528
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:01,410
you're not a Cyborg.

1529
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:01,810
Cyborg.

1530
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:02,251
Start this.

1531
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:03,030
And that means,

1532
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,210
yeah,

1533
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,380
some someone made with a machine,

1534
00:45:05,381 --> 00:45:07,510
these things you have sitting
on your face and that's how,

1535
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,560
that's how you see better.

1536
00:45:08,561 --> 00:45:09,840
And without those you wouldn't see so,

1537
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:09,930
right.

1538
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:10,210
Good.

1539
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,320
I think I thought a Cyborg,

1540
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:13,970
it means that it's part of you now.

1541
00:45:13,971 --> 00:45:17,420
You can't take it off like
it's permanently in you.

1542
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:17,601
Yeah.

1543
00:45:17,601 --> 00:45:20,240
You've learned hearing implants.

1544
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,350
Those are first steps.

1545
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:21,850
Yeah,

1546
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:22,210
yeah,

1547
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:22,430
yeah.

1548
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,230
Hearing aids,

1549
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:28,230
but you know what else is crazy and
dangerous learning to build an airplane.

1550
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,380
Like think of the Wright
brothers way back when,

1551
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:34,280
when they were telling people we're going
to try to make a device that makes us

1552
00:45:34,281 --> 00:45:35,510
fly like birds,

1553
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,291
frightened,

1554
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:36,881
terrified.

1555
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:38,330
People like are you out of your mind?

1556
00:45:38,331 --> 00:45:39,111
You're going to fall,

1557
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,550
you're just going to fall to your death.

1558
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,451
And it's true.

1559
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:45,500
There is an implicit risk whenever you're
trying to create some new invention.

1560
00:45:45,501 --> 00:45:47,690
And if you wait for the FDA,

1561
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:52,870
if we sit around and wait for apple or
for Microsoft to get this stuff passed,

1562
00:45:53,391 --> 00:45:54,800
it is going to be 50 years,

1563
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:58,130
a hundred years because we
need you guys to turn it.

1564
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:01,010
A few of you are going to have
to turn into the toxic avenger.

1565
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,630
A few of you are.

1566
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,261
It's true,

1567
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:03,531
man.

1568
00:46:03,531 --> 00:46:04,011
You need it.

1569
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,520
Cause they've made themselves Guinea
pigs for the sake of our species.

1570
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,740
They did it cause they're enjoying it.

1571
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:09,840
Yeah.

1572
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,320
Well it's worse than a
50 or wait and what's,

1573
00:46:13,321 --> 00:46:14,310
what's bad about it?

1574
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,570
Microphone.

1575
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:16,680
What's bad about it?

1576
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:17,220
Thank you.

1577
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,053
No problem.

1578
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,330
Uh,

1579
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:23,190
what's bad about it is the fact that
there are people who can afford what an

1580
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:24,510
implant would cost.

1581
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:25,890
And um,

1582
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,000
like with cell phones,

1583
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:31,110
I saw cell phones be a tool of
people who had tons of money.

1584
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:34,170
And I saw that with
every other technology.

1585
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,840
And when you're talking about modifying
your body in the ways that we are

1586
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:38,730
talking about it,

1587
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:44,090
and it seems like it has so much potential
to be a useful tool for people to

1588
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:47,670
make that something that's only
available to people with large amounts of

1589
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:50,490
capital seems like wrong.

1590
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,530
Well then you go on,

1591
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,393
listen,

1592
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,520
don't curse

1593
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,510
dirty address this.

1594
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:58,470
And quite accurately when he talks about
technology being applied in the cell

1595
00:46:58,471 --> 00:46:59,304
phone world,

1596
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,190
he's like it initially it
was just a privileged few.

1597
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:06,480
He goes now like 70 plus percent of
the population on the planet has cell

1598
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:06,990
phones.

1599
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,670
He can go to the jungles of Africa.

1600
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,020
You find people have cell phones,

1601
00:47:10,021 --> 00:47:12,060
people have cell phones
everywhere you look,

1602
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:12,520
which,

1603
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,420
so it starts off like
it's really expensive.

1604
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,730
But if it proves to be effective,

1605
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,190
it becomes accessible to almost everyone.

1606
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,570
Which is true.

1607
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,040
But,

1608
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,320
uh,

1609
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,400
but if you look at,

1610
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,230
if you look at waves of technology,

1611
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:25,411
right,

1612
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:26,580
and the evolution of technology,

1613
00:47:26,581 --> 00:47:31,581
the people that get it
first get to dictate how the
technology is used and they

1614
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:34,090
get to dictate the political landscape,

1615
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,690
right?

1616
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,560
So my,

1617
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,480
my awesome.

1618
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,570
So for example,

1619
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:39,010
you'd look at the on users

1620
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,090
don't get to dictate
the political landscape.

1621
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,000
So who has,

1622
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:42,963
that's the one.

1623
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:44,200
Yeah,

1624
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,310
but it's not cell phone producers.

1625
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:46,540
You're talking about people who buy him.

1626
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,550
You're talking about people
who can afford to use them.

1627
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,350
Now they're saying that
they're saying that when you,

1628
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:52,580
a cell phone is invented,

1629
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,200
when Verizon builds a cell phone,

1630
00:47:54,201 --> 00:47:58,320
they get into an agreement with the NSA
and there's code inside your cell phone

1631
00:47:58,321 --> 00:47:59,690
that makes it so that it's tracking you.

1632
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:00,980
It imagine,

1633
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:01,940
imagine,

1634
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,950
imagine that technology applied to,

1635
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:05,810
to some kind of implant.

1636
00:48:05,811 --> 00:48:08,660
Imagine if they came up with
some neuroprosthetic where,

1637
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:09,261
uh,

1638
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:09,621
you know,

1639
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:12,710
the neuroprosthetic that you can attach
to your hippocampus that allows you to

1640
00:48:12,711 --> 00:48:13,760
record your memories.

1641
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,360
Imagine if the government invents that
and it has some secret code in it.

1642
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:18,950
They can shut off your brain.

1643
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:19,441
Okay.

1644
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:19,950
But that's not new.

1645
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:20,700
What they were talking about,

1646
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,380
they were talking about
privilege to people.

1647
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,250
You're talking about this priority.

1648
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,740
He prior to owning ownership.

1649
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:28,574
So like,

1650
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:29,523
uh,

1651
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,050
with cell phones you have chips that,

1652
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,810
that are really good at decoding video.

1653
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:35,651
Really,

1654
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:36,484
really good at it.

1655
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,980
And they're really tiny and you know,

1656
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,540
they're also kind of cheap,

1657
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,480
but they're not open for everyone to you.

1658
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:46,090
So when you have something like
the raspberry Pi come along,

1659
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,430
they have to beg,

1660
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,313
what's a pie?

1661
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,700
It's a handheld computer.

1662
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,170
35 bucks.

1663
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,550
Does everything regular.

1664
00:48:54,551 --> 00:48:54,990
Yeah.

1665
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:55,920
It's crazy like that.

1666
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,430
They like on Reddit it always pops up
with something you've never heard of

1667
00:48:59,431 --> 00:48:59,971
raspberry.

1668
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:01,700
It's just a super cheap operating

1669
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,150
system.

1670
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:02,370
Right?

1671
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:03,900
It's a super cheap computer.

1672
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:04,090
Oh,

1673
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:05,450
it's a super cheap computer.

1674
00:49:05,451 --> 00:49:05,970
It,

1675
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,380
it's about the size of a credit card.

1676
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:11,130
It does everything that
computers should do.

1677
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,900
So you can get on the net,

1678
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:15,660
you can use a to do credit card.

1679
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,530
Um,

1680
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,730
it's credit card,

1681
00:49:17,731 --> 00:49:18,390
palm sized.

1682
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,260
It's palm sized.

1683
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,400
It's a screen as well.

1684
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:21,240
No,

1685
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,730
you need a screen keyboard.

1686
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:24,750
Uh,

1687
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,100
whatever interfaces with the boss.

1688
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,210
It's the CPU,

1689
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:28,711
the whole deal.

1690
00:49:28,711 --> 00:49:29,371
The box itself stuff.

1691
00:49:29,371 --> 00:49:29,761
Wow.

1692
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:30,660
That's credit card size.

1693
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:36,220
And they had to make deals
with a nondisclosure agreements
and make all sorts of

1694
00:49:37,231 --> 00:49:41,910
deals to attain the technology for their
cell phone parts that they're using in

1695
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:44,220
there that's not open to everyone.

1696
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,241
So you know,

1697
00:49:45,241 --> 00:49:49,650
in that same way we believe that people
will create better when they get the

1698
00:49:49,651 --> 00:49:54,630
keys to the candy store and
they can actually experiment
with all the parts that

1699
00:49:54,631 --> 00:49:57,810
are being used and being
developed as much as possible.

1700
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,330
We want to encourage
that plane and playing.

1701
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:01,700
That's interesting.

1702
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,061
But uh,

1703
00:50:02,061 --> 00:50:02,681
what do I,

1704
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:04,730
what I was concerned
with more was not the,

1705
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:04,821
uh,

1706
00:50:04,821 --> 00:50:05,654
the people,

1707
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,230
um,

1708
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:08,750
that are going to profit or not
profit from creating these things.

1709
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:12,350
I was talking about people getting access
to the technology itself and it seems

1710
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,280
like that's inevitable.

1711
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:15,440
It seems like if it's
effective for rich people,

1712
00:50:15,441 --> 00:50:18,770
it will eventually trickle down to the
rest of the population no matter what as

1713
00:50:18,771 --> 00:50:20,480
long as it's really worthwhile.

1714
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:21,181
But I,

1715
00:50:21,181 --> 00:50:26,181
I think that when you've got a particular
group of people always getting first

1716
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,280
access and they can always

1717
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,080
determine how it's used.

1718
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:33,930
And by the time the technology is
democratized to a point where it,

1719
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:34,940
you know,

1720
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,820
first advantage,

1721
00:50:35,821 --> 00:50:36,654
it doesn't matter,

1722
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,160
then there's something else
because they're sitting on
the capital from the last

1723
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:41,090
thing that came along.

1724
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,100
So you've got this perpetual cycle of,

1725
00:50:43,101 --> 00:50:43,371
well,

1726
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:44,420
we're making it first.

1727
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:48,110
So we always get to dictate
the terms of which this,

1728
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:48,681
this thing,

1729
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:52,340
the legal and technical terms by which
shakes this thing or this type of thing.

1730
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:52,710
Yeah.

1731
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,940
But isn't that what ingenuity is all
about and isn't that why people spend so

1732
00:50:55,941 --> 00:50:58,760
much money on companies to
try to develop products?

1733
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,640
I isn't that like sort of
their mo the motivation,

1734
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,970
the motivation is to capture the market
place and to be able to sell this

1735
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,560
incredible thing that they've created.

1736
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,360
I think you're saying it
should be locked down.

1737
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:08,620
No,

1738
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:08,841
no,

1739
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:09,041
no.

1740
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:10,190
I'm saying it shouldn't be long.

1741
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:10,550
Yeah,

1742
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:15,090
but I'm saying I meant locked down
as in once something has created a,

1743
00:51:15,091 --> 00:51:16,590
basically it's available to everyone.

1744
00:51:16,591 --> 00:51:19,740
It shouldn't be available just to
this one person that created it.

1745
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:20,151
Yeah,

1746
00:51:20,151 --> 00:51:20,840
I think so.

1747
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,131
And I,

1748
00:51:21,131 --> 00:51:21,561
I think,

1749
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:22,191
I think that's,

1750
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:25,130
that's the most ethical way to do it in,

1751
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,690
in this case because,

1752
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,040
uh,

1753
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,600
when you're talking
about augmenting humans,

1754
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:32,840
you're talking about giving them
additional information about the world.

1755
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:36,520
And this is our most powerful tool ever.

1756
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,670
And so when you,

1757
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,770
when you're talking
about supercharging this,

1758
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:44,390
you're giving individuals and it's
a great advantage over others.

1759
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,910
And with any other technology,

1760
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:47,151
you know,

1761
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:47,930
there's abuse.

1762
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,090
If you look at nuclear technology,

1763
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,013
right?

1764
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:51,980
Uh,

1765
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,680
the Soviet Union and,

1766
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:58,780
and the United States got to dictate
foreign policy for how many years because

1767
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:01,130
they had that and other countries didn't.

1768
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,180
And I,

1769
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,750
I personally think that that's the
scale of power we're talking about when

1770
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:08,820
you're saying like neural implants and,

1771
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:11,180
and all of these really powerful devices.

1772
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:15,470
I think that the first people that get
it get to dictate how everyone else

1773
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:16,304
plays.

1774
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:17,800
So you're essentially,

1775
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:22,240
what you're saying is that these new
technologies are going to be so powerful

1776
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,070
that once people get control of them,

1777
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:28,210
they'll literally be able to enslave great
groups of people who don't have them.

1778
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,830
They'll have power over them,

1779
00:52:29,831 --> 00:52:34,630
they'll have advantage over the over them
and they'll decide or could decide to

1780
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:37,700
use that advantage to
control the monopolize,

1781
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:39,520
the use of these technologies,

1782
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,920
monopolize the use of
these human improvements.

1783
00:52:41,921 --> 00:52:44,560
He's technological human improvements
and they'll just hoard them.

1784
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:45,400
All of themselves.

1785
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:45,981
Yeah,

1786
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:46,280
I mean,

1787
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,113
and not in any,

1788
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,960
does anybody ever done that
with anything technology?

1789
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,360
Has anybody heard the
technology ever for themselves?

1790
00:52:52,361 --> 00:52:53,740
It seems like if you can sell it,

1791
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:54,350
people sell it.

1792
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:54,731
Well it,

1793
00:52:54,731 --> 00:52:55,341
it never,

1794
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:56,630
it never lasts long,

1795
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,110
but what I'm talking about are the ram,

1796
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,880
the social ramifications of,

1797
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,500
of people trying to hold
on to that for whatever.

1798
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,640
Cause for example,

1799
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,420
everyone,

1800
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,400
every army today uses guns,

1801
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:12,350
but we're still reeling from the cultural
effects of one group of people having

1802
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:15,380
guns and another group of
people not having guns.

1803
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:15,891
Right.

1804
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:17,300
We're still reeling from,

1805
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,350
from,

1806
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:18,591
you know,

1807
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:22,160
countries hating each other and
an ethnic tension and whatever.

1808
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,170
So it's not,

1809
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,620
it's not so much about technology,

1810
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:26,454
it's about,

1811
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,380
this is what happens when you,

1812
00:53:28,381 --> 00:53:31,770
when you try to lock it down
eventually it's going to spread.

1813
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,860
But you're causing damage
by trying to lock it down.

1814
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:35,910
Right.

1815
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,370
That seems to be a,

1816
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:37,990
I dunno,

1817
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:38,310
it's a,

1818
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:39,210
it's a funny argument.

1819
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:44,070
It's an interesting argument and it gets
into a social engineering or socialism,

1820
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:44,750
uh,

1821
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,200
point of view where you got to go.

1822
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:46,501
Well,

1823
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:50,340
how do you decide to
distribute a technology?

1824
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,050
There are companies like ate a fruit,

1825
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,030
I ate of fruit spark fund,

1826
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,280
they're open source and
they still make money.

1827
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:57,630
Well,

1828
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:58,690
there certainly is.

1829
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,350
I mean that's a,

1830
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:02,560
if any place embraces open source,

1831
00:54:02,561 --> 00:54:04,850
it's the Internet and
technology and you know,

1832
00:54:04,851 --> 00:54:09,851
of course Linux and Unix and there's
always been a whole open source community

1833
00:54:09,861 --> 00:54:10,311
online.

1834
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:11,600
But to dictate that,

1835
00:54:11,601 --> 00:54:12,351
that's mandatory.

1836
00:54:12,351 --> 00:54:13,620
That's where things get sketchy.

1837
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,561
You know what I'm saying?

1838
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:16,011
I want,

1839
00:54:16,011 --> 00:54:16,491
I want,

1840
00:54:16,491 --> 00:54:20,060
I'm not saying that I don't want a future
where corporations don't sell this.

1841
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:21,440
I want people to have options.

1842
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,300
I don't totally understand
what you're saying,

1843
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:23,750
but it,

1844
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:26,180
it goes against every other way.

1845
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:28,130
We manage innovation and we,

1846
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:29,290
the way we manage innovation,

1847
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:30,380
it's people get copyrights,

1848
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:33,920
trademarks and you create something and
that becomes you and then you own that

1849
00:54:33,921 --> 00:54:36,260
and then you could sell it or
license it out to other people.

1850
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:36,601
Well,

1851
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:39,860
you're essentially saying is that
whenever it comes to a human benefit now,

1852
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:41,750
no longer do you have the option.

1853
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:45,260
Now you're going to distribute
it freely to everybody.

1854
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,090
And I,

1855
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:47,000
I say like you're,

1856
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:47,450
you're,

1857
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:51,140
you're regulating like in a way that
has never been regulated before.

1858
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:52,490
And that's the socialist idea.

1859
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,900
And it's intriguing.

1860
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:54,700
It's interesting.

1861
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,040
Um,

1862
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,873
it's debatable.

1863
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,350
Interesting.

1864
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:58,161
And it's debatable,

1865
00:54:58,161 --> 00:54:58,941
but what you're,

1866
00:54:58,941 --> 00:55:02,750
what you're talking about is a sort
of a mandatory type of a thing.

1867
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:02,991
Well,

1868
00:55:02,991 --> 00:55:03,191
I,

1869
00:55:03,191 --> 00:55:05,210
I don't wanna I don't want to say,

1870
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:05,751
hey Google,

1871
00:55:05,751 --> 00:55:07,520
you have to make this,

1872
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:08,870
this implant open source.

1873
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:13,340
What I'm saying is I want a future where
you can either get corporation x or you

1874
00:55:13,341 --> 00:55:15,620
can go to the open source community.

1875
00:55:15,621 --> 00:55:16,454
Be Cheap.

1876
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:16,800
Right?

1877
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,790
But isn't that inevitable?

1878
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:18,001
I mean,

1879
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:19,230
that's what you have with cell phones.

1880
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:19,581
I mean,

1881
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:23,160
you can buy an android phone or you can
buy an apple phone or you can buy some

1882
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:24,000
no name phone.

1883
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:24,480
I mean,

1884
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:24,691
I mean,

1885
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:26,700
eventually if something
is worth something,

1886
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:29,160
people sell it to the point where
you're going to have leaders in the

1887
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:29,730
marketplace.

1888
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,900
But once it has,

1889
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,700
once the public has access,

1890
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:34,470
those leaders are based
in the market itself.

1891
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:36,180
There based on what people buy,

1892
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:36,781
what they like,

1893
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:37,614
what they enjoy.

1894
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:40,020
He can't monopolize if someone,

1895
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:40,640
if,

1896
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,770
if everyone's selling a similar
product and one person's better,

1897
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:44,760
that's the one that succeeds.

1898
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:45,210
And that's,

1899
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:50,040
that's sort of where we're at because
of the fact that we don't just say when

1900
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:51,180
something comes along like,

1901
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:51,451
hey,

1902
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:53,520
everybody has access to this fuck patents,

1903
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:54,420
fuck trademarks.

1904
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:55,081
You know,

1905
00:55:55,081 --> 00:56:00,081
that that's literally against the way
innovation has spawned human beings to

1906
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:01,380
this point in the first.

1907
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,733
But there's other,

1908
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:03,140
there's,

1909
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,160
I think there's other
motivations than capital.

1910
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:10,220
I think they way the motivation in this
kind of technology is so much bigger

1911
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:10,891
than money.

1912
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:13,260
What you're talking about is achieving,

1913
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:14,140
uh,

1914
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:18,420
the ability with technology to produce
emotions or to create psychic states.

1915
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:18,960
Uh,

1916
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,321
that is,

1917
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:19,800
uh,

1918
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,830
an amazing thing and that's
an amazingly powerful thing.

1919
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,340
So so's calling people.

1920
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:25,001
Yeah,

1921
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:26,110
but you know what,

1922
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,410
I'd rather have an orgasm
helmet than a cell phone,

1923
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:29,840
but it's,

1924
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,171
look,

1925
00:56:30,171 --> 00:56:31,240
it's not either or.

1926
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:32,603
It's not either or.

1927
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,100
But what I'm saying is cell phones
didn't get socialized and this technology

1928
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:36,934
shouldn't either.

1929
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,490
I don't think they're saying it
should or shouldn't be socialized.

1930
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:40,020
I'm just,

1931
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,660
they're,

1932
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,470
they're trying to make an open
source version of this stuff.

1933
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,390
But if they do that for us,

1934
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,100
I don't think they're
going to do that before.

1935
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:49,300
It knows what they're doing.

1936
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,280
But what I'm saying is

1937
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,360
you make it,

1938
00:56:52,361 --> 00:56:55,750
you shouldn't be entitled to distribute
it to everybody if you want to

1939
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:56,261
you,

1940
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:57,280
but you shouldn't be.

1941
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:59,590
You shouldn't be forced into Detroit.

1942
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,330
I wonder if future of options and an end
and in terms of the technology coming

1943
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:04,570
out,

1944
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:09,570
I want the open source and the closed
source to come out at the same time

1945
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,780
because any,

1946
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:14,320
any lag time between the closed
source and the open source,

1947
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,280
again,

1948
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,390
it starts to produce,

1949
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,530
produce problems.

1950
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:22,030
So I want a future where people have
options as to what they're going to get.

1951
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,090
And I think that we've
already seen problems with,

1952
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,840
uh,

1953
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,780
with technologies being
pigeonholed so that,

1954
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:30,040
you know,

1955
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,090
we can't have,

1956
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,950
we can't not have a smartphone,

1957
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,890
but we know the fuckery that's
going on with smartphones.

1958
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:36,730
Right?

1959
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:37,860
And so there's what,

1960
00:57:37,861 --> 00:57:38,530
what do you,

1961
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,363
what do you do?

1962
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:39,851
Well,

1963
00:57:39,851 --> 00:57:42,310
there's a lot of problems with smartphones
if really want to get to the bottom

1964
00:57:42,311 --> 00:57:42,521
of it.

1965
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:44,860
The real problem is they're
all based on conflict minerals.

1966
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:48,160
The real problem in smartphones is that
you follow every smart phone down to its

1967
00:57:48,161 --> 00:57:48,700
source.

1968
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,690
And he got a little kid in Africa with
a stick knocking rocks out of the dirt.

1969
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:53,800
And that's real.

1970
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,390
And that they can't fix that yet.

1971
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,403
They really can't.

1972
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,520
They don't know what to do yet.

1973
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,470
So the,

1974
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,000
they need these conflict minerals
and they're not available in very,

1975
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,290
very many spots of the world.

1976
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,570
And the places where they
can get them the cheapest,

1977
00:58:04,571 --> 00:58:05,404
that's where they get them.

1978
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,030
And that's why you have
civil war in the Congo.

1979
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:09,460
And that's why you have people
fighting over these resources.

1980
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,450
So you've got a real problem besides
the innovation got a real problem in the

1981
00:58:13,451 --> 00:58:16,780
morality of actually owning a cell
phone because everyone who owns a cell

1982
00:58:16,781 --> 00:58:17,740
phone's a piece of shit.

1983
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,630
If you really get down to the core of it.

1984
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,800
I mean this just,

1985
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,760
there's no way around it.

1986
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,100
I,

1987
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,310
I think this is a,

1988
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,070
this is an unbelievably fascinating
subject and I think it's inevitable that,

1989
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:27,430
uh,

1990
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,690
we,

1991
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:29,770
we have this sort of discussion and the,

1992
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:34,771
in this argument and I think what we
really need is the idea of capitalism or

1993
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:35,883
competition.

1994
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,390
W merged with morality and
ethics and humanity and in,

1995
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,171
instead,

1996
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:44,080
what we usually have is he who
gets to the top of the mountain,

1997
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:48,250
kicks everybody in the face that's trying
to get up and instead of like pulling

1998
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:51,600
people up with them and
humanity benefiting and,

1999
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:51,891
and,

2000
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:55,330
and sharing something like that in an
open source manner because you think it's

2001
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,880
the right thing to do
instead of mandating it,

2002
00:58:57,881 --> 00:59:00,580
I think it almost should be
a part of success itself.

2003
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,910
That success itself sort
of generates a altruism.

2004
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,310
It generates happiness
at generates generosity.

2005
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:06,791
It should.

2006
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:10,210
It's like once you have some and you
care about others you should give,

2007
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:10,871
you should help,

2008
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:13,960
you should boost him up and
we don't have that attitude,

2009
00:59:13,961 --> 00:59:14,471
this country.

2010
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:18,640
Unfortunately we have this
ultra competitive attitude
which has spawned so much

2011
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:19,990
innovation because of it,

2012
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,580
but along way it's also made
a bunch of fucking assholes.

2013
00:59:23,581 --> 00:59:23,900
Yeah.

2014
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,960
You know a bunch of heartless
assholes just caught up in the hunt.

2015
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:27,470
Don't,

2016
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,820
don't you guys think that the,

2017
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,460
it's eventually going to be impossible
to keep anything private and that it's

2018
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,330
like to even the,

2019
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:40,620
so we're entering into a future where
there is really not going to be such a

2020
00:59:40,621 --> 00:59:41,850
thing as secrets.

2021
00:59:41,851 --> 00:59:45,330
We're entering into a
future where everything will
eventually be leaked in some

2022
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:45,511
way.

2023
00:59:45,511 --> 00:59:46,380
Everything will

2024
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:46,711
well,

2025
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:47,700
I'll go you one better.

2026
00:59:47,701 --> 00:59:49,410
I don't think money's
going to be real anymore.

2027
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,490
I think we're going to get to a point
where there's not going to ones and Zeros

2028
00:59:53,491 --> 00:59:57,460
are not going to cut it as far as you
have this and he doesn't have that and I

2029
00:59:57,461 --> 01:00:02,461
really believe that we're going to get
to some weird place where just by nature

2030
01:00:02,761 --> 01:00:03,510
of the,

2031
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:05,970
the just the progression
of technology itself,

2032
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,650
the dissolving of boundaries,

2033
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:11,580
the access to information ones and
Zeros are all you have when it comes to

2034
01:00:11,581 --> 01:00:12,060
money.

2035
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,350
Money is just information.

2036
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,890
It's going to get to a point where the
idea of the paradigm that we operate

2037
01:00:16,891 --> 01:00:17,071
under,

2038
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,000
we think it's important.

2039
01:00:18,001 --> 01:00:18,781
I keep my stuff,

2040
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:19,620
you keep your stuff,

2041
01:00:19,621 --> 01:00:20,251
I pay for this,

2042
01:00:20,251 --> 01:00:21,084
you pay for that.

2043
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:22,980
It doesn't exist anywhere else in nature.

2044
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,810
We've decided that this is normal.

2045
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,200
We're going to get to a point in time
where you're not going to be able to lock

2046
01:00:28,201 --> 01:00:29,034
it down anymore.

2047
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:30,660
You're not going to be
able to hold on to money.

2048
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:31,680
It's not gonna mean anything.

2049
01:00:31,681 --> 01:00:33,840
We're going to have to decide what the
fuck to do with all the different shaped

2050
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:34,560
houses.

2051
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,270
We're going to have to
decide who gets the food.

2052
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,400
It's not going to be real anymore.

2053
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:38,911
It's going to,

2054
01:00:38,911 --> 01:00:41,610
it's going to merge and
do some next level shit.

2055
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,590
And that's the future of humanity.

2056
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:44,491
I hope so too.

2057
01:00:44,491 --> 01:00:46,860
But then I hope people don't get
lazy as fuck because of that.

2058
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,990
Well one of the reasons why
people have done so well,

2059
01:00:48,991 --> 01:00:52,740
which is it's also arguable whether
or not doing so well as a good thing.

2060
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,870
But one of the reasons is that we've
needed to succeed in order to survive.

2061
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,620
I don't know.

2062
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,610
Can you think we got out of caves?

2063
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:04,300
How do you think we didn't get
killed off like neanderthal?

2064
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:08,030
How do you think we didn't become
food for the prey were weak and slow.

2065
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:08,510
We'd just,

2066
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:08,881
because we,

2067
01:01:08,881 --> 01:01:12,440
we innovated and we pushed forth and we
got the fuck away from all the things

2068
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:13,274
that are dangerous.

2069
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,360
We locked up cities,

2070
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:15,410
we invented guns,

2071
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,440
we did a lot of shit in order
to make innovation possible.

2072
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,090
Cause if you go to places on the earth,

2073
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,250
like the Amazon or like Africa,

2074
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:23,480
there's no fucking innovation.

2075
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:23,901
Okay.

2076
01:01:23,901 --> 01:01:26,750
You're wearing a piece of skin over your
deck and you look for something to eat.

2077
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:27,940
And that's what you do everyday.

2078
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,500
You get up in the morning early and you
go look for something he cause if you

2079
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:30,651
don't,

2080
01:01:30,651 --> 01:01:31,430
you die.

2081
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,750
My,

2082
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,130
my,

2083
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:32,701
my favorite,

2084
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:35,940
my favorite example is the,

2085
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:40,290
when we started growing crops
right before most of our,

2086
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,470
most of a human's time was
spent looking for food.

2087
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,370
Right?

2088
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,660
You didn't have time to ask,

2089
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:46,531
you know,

2090
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:46,921
mom,

2091
01:01:46,921 --> 01:01:47,540
what is that?

2092
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,850
Cause you were fucking either hunting
something or running away from something

2093
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,680
that was just about your entire life.

2094
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,380
When you are now growing food,

2095
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:56,551
you're now,

2096
01:01:56,551 --> 01:02:01,551
you now have a wide space in your
day where you're not doing anything,

2097
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,680
even entire seasons where
you've got food stored up.

2098
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:05,380
So what do you do?

2099
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,270
You started asking questions.

2100
01:02:06,271 --> 01:02:07,104
You started making art.

2101
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,360
You start writing things
down because you've got time.

2102
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:09,960
Now.

2103
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:14,960
I think that when I think technology
should be about liberating people to do

2104
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,570
what they want fall,

2105
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:19,200
I'm sorry to cut you,

2106
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,070
but what you're saying,

2107
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,380
this to me is one of the great,

2108
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,490
uh,

2109
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:23,671
uh,

2110
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:25,770
naive ideas of transhumanism,

2111
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,920
which is the notion that if you remove
from human beings and this then the need

2112
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:32,250
for something.

2113
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:32,821
In other words,

2114
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:34,950
because the ultimate
goal of transhumanism,

2115
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:37,210
I think is to take the,

2116
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:41,370
to shrink down the moment between what
you can think you want and the moment of

2117
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:44,820
having it to nothing so that you
instantaneously have something,

2118
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:48,780
whether it's by neurologically stimulating
your brain in a way that's exactly

2119
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:49,830
identical to reality.

2120
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:53,580
So you can experience any feeling state
that you want or whether it's using

2121
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,990
matters simulators to build something
that you've contemplated and all of

2122
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:02,520
humanity has been based on overcoming
the obstacle between those two things.

2123
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,170
But in overcoming the obstacle,

2124
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,500
you gain wisdom when you're
learning how to like play piano,

2125
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:09,330
you don't just get to
learn how to play piano.

2126
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:14,150
You get to learn the discipline of years
and years of working to play piano and

2127
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,250
suddenly we can download into
someone's mind how to play piano.

2128
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,750
If we remove that discipline,

2129
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,420
then what Joe's saying
is you end up with slugs.

2130
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:22,540
I think that,

2131
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:26,290
I think no matter how hard a dog tries,

2132
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:27,820
it can never learn calculus.

2133
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:29,740
There's just an upper limit.

2134
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:30,730
You just,

2135
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:33,730
no matter it can study
forever and it just,

2136
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,840
it won't happen.

2137
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:37,300
And so I think that there
are things that we just,

2138
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,710
as humans,

2139
01:03:38,711 --> 01:03:39,544
we just,

2140
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:41,470
no matter how hard we try,

2141
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:42,730
there's an upper limit.

2142
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:43,780
And so when you begin,

2143
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,550
let's say downloading information,

2144
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,290
there's some things you'll get easy,

2145
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,250
but there are other things that no one's
ever discovered that you now have to

2146
01:03:51,251 --> 01:03:54,760
discover new ways to play
that have never been even,

2147
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:55,541
you know,

2148
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:56,530
thought about ever.

2149
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,380
So I think that that when you,

2150
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:00,330
when you augment,

2151
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,110
when you make yourself more intelligent,

2152
01:04:02,111 --> 01:04:04,060
more capable now,

2153
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,750
now you don't have to do hard
work to do what humans can do,

2154
01:04:07,751 --> 01:04:11,050
but you still have to do
hard work to do whatever.

2155
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,680
Explain it in layman's terms.

2156
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,740
This is a technological
version of Mo money.

2157
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:17,700
Mo problems.

2158
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:19,411
Exactly.

2159
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:19,951
That's what it is.

2160
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:20,340
Yes.

2161
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:24,240
You don't get make your problems far
more complex like people thought.

2162
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:24,900
You know what?

2163
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:28,500
Once human beings have supermarkets
and you just go with a credit card,

2164
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:30,240
you don't even have to
bring her on a bag of gold,

2165
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,640
then no one's going to be depressed.

2166
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:35,100
It turns out people more depressed.

2167
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:35,821
They're sad,

2168
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:36,900
they're looking for meaning.

2169
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,640
They're not hunting and
gathering their food.

2170
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,780
They're missing all those,

2171
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:40,411
those,

2172
01:04:40,411 --> 01:04:44,340
those rewards that are
built into the human genome,

2173
01:04:44,341 --> 01:04:45,420
they don't get them anymore.

2174
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,373
So what do they do?

2175
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,620
They take Prozac and they drive
fast and they watch stupid movies.

2176
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:50,570
Yeah.

2177
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,770
Well can I put it a
little money mo problems.

2178
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:52,890
Well,

2179
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:56,110
let me put it in non
layman's burning man terms.

2180
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,120
If you'd take the
Tibetan book of the dead,

2181
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:01,990
one of the Bardos or one of the hell's
in the Tibetan book of the dead is called

2182
01:05:01,991 --> 01:05:03,790
the Hell of hungry ghosts.

2183
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,050
And what this hell is,

2184
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:10,030
is these beings living in this weird
place have this infinite appetite and

2185
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:13,930
anything they can think of to eat
immediately appears in front of them.

2186
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,540
So they have the combination
of always being hungry,

2187
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:17,080
mixed in,

2188
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,520
being able to instantaneously

2189
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:22,420
create any food that they want and that
creates a health state where all they're

2190
01:05:22,421 --> 01:05:27,280
doing is feeding and eating to try to
quench this endless human appetite.

2191
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,560
Now obviously we're really far away.

2192
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:30,870
Probably coming though.

2193
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:33,330
I mean if you wanted to think of
something that someone would invent,

2194
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:36,450
that's without doubt inside
the realm of possibility.

2195
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:39,880
We already have boner pills
for old dudes on a pill.

2196
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,340
The on their deathbed,

2197
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,140
they chomped down a couple of pills
and they got us Zombie talked.

2198
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:45,840
We already have that.

2199
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,780
You're telling me they're not going to
have something where it just keeps your

2200
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:49,620
hunger going.

2201
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:49,981
You,

2202
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:51,210
you never get satisfied.

2203
01:05:51,211 --> 01:05:52,140
You'll be hungry all the time.

2204
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:53,550
What's your favorite thing to do?

2205
01:05:53,551 --> 01:05:55,500
Isn't it eat mine too?

2206
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,530
Wouldn't it be great if you were
hungry always and you can just be a

2207
01:05:58,531 --> 01:06:00,100
professional eater all day.

2208
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,073
Yeah.

2209
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:02,971
Fast food.

2210
01:06:02,971 --> 01:06:04,590
Thinking about what people
had done to their lips.

2211
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:05,483
People would do that.

2212
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:09,210
People blown up their lips
putting magnets in their fingers.

2213
01:06:09,211 --> 01:06:09,900
No offense.

2214
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:10,950
They would definitely do that.

2215
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:11,580
I,

2216
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:12,790
I think that that,

2217
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:14,330
that's a,

2218
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,850
if that's something a negative
about the human condition.

2219
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,050
I mean if,

2220
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,180
if we have that technology at some point,

2221
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,520
then we would also have the
technology to change it.

2222
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:27,700
And that's another discussion whether
we should get rid of the hedonic

2223
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:28,090
treadmill.

2224
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:28,271
Well,

2225
01:06:28,271 --> 01:06:30,040
I'm not even sure that it's a negative.

2226
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:30,874
I'm just a,

2227
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,680
it's almost like a pattern.

2228
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:33,070
I mean,

2229
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:37,180
I think whatever it took to get
humans to this point in history,

2230
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,580
whatever it took to get
us to what we are now,

2231
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,650
it's an incredible process.

2232
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:46,710
I mean from whatever we were
from multi-celled organisms
on to this thing with

2233
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:47,674
laptops,

2234
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,510
that process is insane.

2235
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:54,750
And the idea that that
process just changes because
we add a chip and you know,

2236
01:06:56,021 --> 01:06:56,290
we,

2237
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:56,700
it's a no,

2238
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,131
I was going to be,

2239
01:06:57,131 --> 01:06:59,920
there's going to be like a growing phase
and then it's going to become something

2240
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:02,380
new just like it became this.

2241
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:02,800
Yeah.

2242
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:07,800
If this is unrecognizable to some crazy
Nana tall 50,000 years ago and it's what

2243
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:10,870
we will be 50,000 years from now,

2244
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,000
it's probably unrecognizable to us.

2245
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:13,360
Yeah,

2246
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,550
and whether it happens slowly or quickly.

2247
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:17,200
What has happened in our lifetime,

2248
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:19,410
man did the idea of of the Internet,

2249
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:24,280
it crept up on us so damn quick
that we all just accepted as a fact.

2250
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:27,160
Whereas if you brought
any other time in history,

2251
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:31,510
it's the most insane piece of sorcery
and magic the world has ever known.

2252
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:35,170
Just 20 years ago it would
have been insane conquering,

2253
01:07:35,171 --> 01:07:36,550
conquering a dragon.

2254
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:40,170
The idea that you could have a little
little glass box and your posture and

2255
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:41,470
answers all your questions,

2256
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:42,040
amazing.

2257
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,060
You could send messages,

2258
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,120
including video from people to
people all around the world.

2259
01:07:46,121 --> 01:07:46,811
It's insane.

2260
01:07:46,811 --> 01:07:49,840
Everything about it since the credible
and it's just a part of our accepted

2261
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:52,660
everyday life slowly
happen slowly or quickly,

2262
01:07:52,661 --> 01:07:53,320
whether it'd be,

2263
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:53,561
you know,

2264
01:07:53,561 --> 01:07:54,161
slowly.

2265
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:56,170
We think of it slowly in
the course of human history.

2266
01:07:56,171 --> 01:07:58,060
It's a massive burst of innovation.

2267
01:07:58,061 --> 01:08:01,510
But in our lifetimes it's been
10 20 years and then boom,

2268
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:02,081
it's all here.

2269
01:08:02,081 --> 01:08:04,480
But the idea that you're going to stop it,

2270
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:05,080
that,

2271
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:05,501
you know,

2272
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:09,250
or that we should even resist the
next level is it seems pretty silly.

2273
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,780
I just can't resist it.

2274
01:08:10,781 --> 01:08:11,710
You can't stop it.

2275
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:14,200
It's interesting to sit around and go,

2276
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:15,230
what the hell is it going to be?

2277
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:15,770
Yeah.

2278
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:16,630
That's where it gets weird.

2279
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:16,971
Yeah.

2280
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:17,191
And,

2281
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:17,901
and we don't know,

2282
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:18,560
but no,

2283
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,393
I don't,

2284
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:20,960
I don't think that,

2285
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:21,680
uh,

2286
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:26,270
primitive man could have put a person
on the moon if they were still worrying

2287
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:27,800
about catching that pig.

2288
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,000
You know what I'm saying?

2289
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:30,231
Whatever,

2290
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,930
whatever aspirations we
will have in 10,000 years,

2291
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,030
we won't get to that if,

2292
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,490
if we don't do certain things.

2293
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:38,480
Uh,

2294
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:38,731
and,

2295
01:08:38,731 --> 01:08:40,430
and I think that a part of,

2296
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:41,323
uh,

2297
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:45,110
a part of humanity that I think we
should keep is our need to explore and

2298
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:45,741
understand.

2299
01:08:45,741 --> 01:08:48,050
And I think that if we're
still worrying about,

2300
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:48,440
you know,

2301
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,000
getting cancer at 60,

2302
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,430
we're not going to get it

2303
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:51,850
there.

2304
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:52,390
Right.

2305
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:53,350
I think it's inevitable,

2306
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,090
but we still keep exploring.

2307
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:55,810
I really don't.

2308
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:56,430
I don't,

2309
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:58,060
that's why we're here.

2310
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,800
It's a whole part of the whole thing.

2311
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:01,150
There's no getting around that.

2312
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,520
Now you've got a video to show us.

2313
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:04,090
Oh,

2314
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:08,830
well we've got a something
Kikwete queued up with Tim when,

2315
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:09,790
when our buddy,

2316
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:12,100
our CTO got his magnets installed,

2317
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:12,821
uh,

2318
01:09:12,821 --> 01:09:13,361
he,

2319
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:14,800
he got it on video.

2320
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:15,401
Okay.

2321
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:15,761
Yeah.

2322
01:09:15,761 --> 01:09:16,050
Loans.

2323
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:16,883
Definitely see that.

2324
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:17,883
Slapped that up.

2325
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:18,311
Oh,

2326
01:09:18,311 --> 01:09:19,144
Jesus.

2327
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:21,080
Yeah.

2328
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:21,940
This is Tim.

2329
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:23,223
This is Tim.

2330
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:24,850
Oh my God.

2331
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,350
What's what?

2332
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:28,060
You don't know.

2333
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:30,250
What's that sound?

2334
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:30,760
Hold on.

2335
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,420
Pause that.

2336
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,253
Pause that.

2337
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:33,820
Why does it sound like that?

2338
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,470
What kind of soundtrack is on that?

2339
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:36,701
That's so stupid.

2340
01:09:36,701 --> 01:09:37,534
Kill the sound.

2341
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:40,840
Just play that because obviously
there's something going on behind it.

2342
01:09:40,841 --> 01:09:42,640
We might even be a movie.

2343
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:43,503
Wow.

2344
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:44,170
Okay.

2345
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:45,040
Doing the surgery.

2346
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,460
Some asshole if I'm at home depot.

2347
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,710
They were to around touching lawn mowers.

2348
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,191
It's like,

2349
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:51,371
Hey,

2350
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:52,204
I can do that for you.

2351
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:53,470
He's someone who,

2352
01:09:53,471 --> 01:09:53,770
uh,

2353
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:54,460
does,

2354
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:58,150
does tattoo work and he specializes
in doing subdermal stuff.

2355
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:59,043
Wow.

2356
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,280
Shitty tattoos.

2357
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:02,200
Never trusted tattoo artists was shitty.

2358
01:10:02,201 --> 01:10:07,120
Taxes cause a thing called old laser
tattoo removal sun looking into it.

2359
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:08,770
Never trust a surgeon was shitty.

2360
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:09,520
Tattoos,

2361
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,420
especially on his face.

2362
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,840
Tazzy surgeons with tattoos on their face.

2363
01:10:13,841 --> 01:10:14,770
Boy Floyd,

2364
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,570
you're going to go under and 10,

2365
01:10:16,571 --> 01:10:17,560
nine I to fuck you man.

2366
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:17,791
Your ass.

2367
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:18,624
Wait.

2368
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:20,261
Okay.

2369
01:10:20,261 --> 01:10:25,261
So this guy is cutting and he's
inserting this magnet into this dude's

2370
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:26,891
fingertip.

2371
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:27,490
This,

2372
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:28,211
it's a very,

2373
01:10:28,211 --> 01:10:28,511
very,

2374
01:10:28,511 --> 01:10:29,770
very tiny magnet.

2375
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:30,220
Yeah.

2376
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:31,000
Well how,

2377
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,990
how would you describe it?

2378
01:10:31,991 --> 01:10:35,320
It looks like a BB that's
been split into like sixes,

2379
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,040
right?

2380
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:36,940
That's all small looks.

2381
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,710
It's about two millimeters wide.

2382
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:40,150
It's a little gel that's
bigger than I thought.

2383
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:40,990
Maybe,

2384
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:42,430
maybe a little less than two millimeters

2385
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,780
cause that looks really tiny.

2386
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,010
Maybe it's just a perspective,

2387
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:45,321
uh,

2388
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:45,851
of this,

2389
01:10:45,851 --> 01:10:46,240
uh,

2390
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,170
this video,

2391
01:10:47,171 --> 01:10:48,310
but that looks like,

2392
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:49,690
well under a millimeter.

2393
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,460
What's the charge for this procedure?

2394
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,050
Three guys crazy.

2395
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:53,900
Absolutely.

2396
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,300
100% free talks you up,

2397
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:59,230
stick shit in your fingertips
and that's who you get

2398
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:00,280
stuffed down from.

2399
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:00,500
Uh,

2400
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,930
it'd be pretty reasonable.

2401
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:05,680
It'd be a bargain price
anywhere between 75 and one 50.

2402
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:08,080
Just like most subdermal uh,

2403
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:08,973
body mods.

2404
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:10,271
What is,

2405
01:11:10,271 --> 01:11:10,690
um,

2406
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:12,460
when you're talking about the future,

2407
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:14,890
when you guys sit around and you,

2408
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,920
you bring up what's on the horizon,

2409
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,030
what's like the big theoretical on the
horizon as to have anything to do with

2410
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:25,380
like the kind of technology that we see
in Google glass being incorporated in

2411
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,320
like maybe a normal sort of a thing.

2412
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,380
So there was a,

2413
01:11:29,381 --> 01:11:32,200
there was a paper put out
a few months ago about,

2414
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,490
uh,

2415
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:36,940
connecting two minds of rodents.

2416
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,163
Uh,

2417
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:43,350
and so there was one road and if I'm
not mistaken in Virginia and there was

2418
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:48,640
another road and somewhere in Brazil
and they put this chip into the,

2419
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:53,590
into the brains of these two mice and
put them through an obstacle course.

2420
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,850
And,

2421
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:55,091
uh,

2422
01:11:55,091 --> 01:11:57,880
with a US roughly 60 to 70%,

2423
01:11:58,090 --> 01:11:58,923
um,

2424
01:11:59,230 --> 01:11:59,890
uh,

2425
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:00,760
crossover rate,

2426
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:02,980
the other mouse actually learned,

2427
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:04,330
uh,

2428
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:06,490
the obstacle course of the other mouse.

2429
01:12:06,491 --> 01:12:07,324
It was connected to.

2430
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,050
Do you know if that's been
done without chips though?

2431
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:11,240
Rupert Sheldrake wrote
a whole book about it.

2432
01:12:11,241 --> 01:12:14,690
It's called the morphic field
and a morphic residence.

2433
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:15,021
And,

2434
01:12:15,021 --> 01:12:15,170
uh,

2435
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,010
he wrote a book,

2436
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:16,290
uh,

2437
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:20,600
about a dog's knowing when their
owners are coming home and uh,

2438
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,120
people being able to tell when people
look at the back of their heads.

2439
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:25,130
And it's a fascinating sort of a theory,

2440
01:12:25,131 --> 01:12:26,090
but he,

2441
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:26,570
um,

2442
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:27,590
he showed that,

2443
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,050
I don't know if it's been verified 100%,

2444
01:12:30,051 --> 01:12:30,460
so,

2445
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:35,000
but I know he wrote that he showed
that if you teach a rat in one place,

2446
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:37,250
a maze that rat somewhere else,

2447
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:40,850
another part of the world will learn
that similar maize or that same May.

2448
01:12:40,851 --> 01:12:41,684
It's quicker,

2449
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:42,950
statistically quicker.

2450
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:44,310
Right.

2451
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:45,830
They've also shown that chimpanzees,

2452
01:12:45,831 --> 01:12:46,810
once they started venting,

2453
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:47,300
um,

2454
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,620
things to do with tools,

2455
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:49,761
chimpanzees,

2456
01:12:49,761 --> 01:12:49,881
we,

2457
01:12:49,881 --> 01:12:51,080
they've demonstrated like,

2458
01:12:51,081 --> 01:12:51,710
um,

2459
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:52,040
a,

2460
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:52,311
um,

2461
01:12:52,311 --> 01:12:57,311
an orangutan in Africa learned how to
spear fish by watching people do it.

2462
01:12:57,321 --> 01:12:58,700
There's a picture of this thing doing it.

2463
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,290
It's all a motherfucker.

2464
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:01,940
It's the craziest thing ever.

2465
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:02,271
Well,

2466
01:13:02,271 --> 01:13:02,890
other rang,

2467
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:03,830
started doing it too.

2468
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:04,661
They once,

2469
01:13:04,661 --> 01:13:06,410
once they start learning things,

2470
01:13:06,411 --> 01:13:08,120
it's almost like it's in the ether.

2471
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:09,230
It's very strange.

2472
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:09,411
Yeah.

2473
01:13:09,411 --> 01:13:11,930
This is a ring of Tang
separated geographically.

2474
01:13:11,931 --> 01:13:13,530
It's not like they could
observe each other.

2475
01:13:13,531 --> 01:13:14,690
And I don't know about orangutans,

2476
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,411
but the,

2477
01:13:15,411 --> 01:13:15,710
um,

2478
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:17,660
the bice definitely
separated geographically.

2479
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,090
That's what's odd about it.

2480
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:19,851
But you know what,

2481
01:13:19,851 --> 01:13:20,181
I think,

2482
01:13:20,181 --> 01:13:20,331
man,

2483
01:13:20,331 --> 01:13:21,800
I don't think it's that they're learning,

2484
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:26,540
they learn it and then it
travels somehow through space.

2485
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,350
I think the evolution
sort of groves through us,

2486
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:31,011
do you know what I mean?

2487
01:13:31,011 --> 01:13:31,521
Like it's our,

2488
01:13:31,521 --> 01:13:31,791
it's,

2489
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:34,810
it's something that's
growing through humanity is,

2490
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,180
are these new innovation.

2491
01:13:36,181 --> 01:13:40,610
So it's not as though one orangutan
figured it out and send out a signal.

2492
01:13:40,611 --> 01:13:44,680
It's as though this was just a new phase
that was coming through this form of

2493
01:13:44,681 --> 01:13:45,491
that's very possible.

2494
01:13:45,491 --> 01:13:45,550
Well,

2495
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:47,280
but the Orangutang initially I,

2496
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:50,500
I've confused these two
stories pretty badly,

2497
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,131
but the,

2498
01:13:51,131 --> 01:13:51,281
uh,

2499
01:13:51,281 --> 01:13:53,620
the mice learned in
separate parts of the world,

2500
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:54,490
separate parts of,

2501
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:55,301
they weren't connected,

2502
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:57,400
whether it's a thousand
miles or a hundred miles,

2503
01:13:57,401 --> 01:13:58,234
whatever it was,

2504
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,380
but the rank Tang,

2505
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:02,410
we're watching people and the
orangutan started imitating people,

2506
01:14:02,411 --> 01:14:05,410
so they did directly
imitating human beings.

2507
01:14:05,411 --> 01:14:09,490
But if you really stop and think about
when human beings used to be essentially

2508
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,930
very similar to orangutans,

2509
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,600
it was probably only like a
couple of million years ago.

2510
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:13,990
Right?

2511
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,030
That seems like a long time to us,

2512
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:18,280
but in the span of the universe,

2513
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,210
that ain't shit.

2514
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:21,910
So the idea that a chimp could eventually,

2515
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:26,920
if they kept moving along and slowly
innovating and changing and finding magic

2516
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,530
mushrooms and learning how
to make fires with rocks,

2517
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,900
they could eventually become
some kind of a human thing.

2518
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:32,381
I mean,

2519
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:34,030
we didn't use to be people.

2520
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:34,930
That's a fact.

2521
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,910
I mean pretty much established.

2522
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:39,760
It's not like all of a sudden
we popped up in this form,

2523
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:40,241
you know,

2524
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:41,350
figuring out always shit.

2525
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,940
We've got to get away
from leopards that we,

2526
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:43,150
we,

2527
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:45,790
we became this like slowly and steadily.

2528
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:48,160
It's just the timeframe for us.

2529
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:52,540
It's so bizarre to wrap our heads around
with an 80 plus year lifespan to try to

2530
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:56,500
understand what a 10 million
year period of development is.

2531
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:57,490
We can't really,

2532
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:58,510
we can't get our head into that.

2533
01:14:58,511 --> 01:14:58,811
We don't,

2534
01:14:58,811 --> 01:14:59,920
we don't know what that means.

2535
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:02,320
And 10 million years
from now with this stuff.

2536
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:06,730
When he gets to that weird exponential
technology thing that's going on right

2537
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:07,330
now,

2538
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:09,730
we're going to be unrecognizable
a hundred years from now.

2539
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,320
Sure.

2540
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,170
Well that's what I feel
like Lucas is getting at.

2541
01:15:13,171 --> 01:15:18,171
By creating an actual in a pathway between
two minds or between many minds that

2542
01:15:21,421 --> 01:15:25,020
we can control using principles
we already understand.

2543
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:27,180
I don't know.

2544
01:15:27,181 --> 01:15:31,620
Intuition the way I know the way
in electrons going to travel.

2545
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,750
I know the way in
electrons going to travel.

2546
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:34,584
I don't,

2547
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:36,420
I don't get intuition that way.

2548
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:41,720
So if we can create chips where I can
have something in the back of my head and

2549
01:15:42,151 --> 01:15:45,530
I go like this and Lucas is like stop
scratching your arm cause I feel it.

2550
01:15:45,531 --> 01:15:46,140
Yeah,

2551
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:47,010
like that's,

2552
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,810
that's like that's an SRO

2553
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:50,280
touching your butt.

2554
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,513
How about that?

2555
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:53,250
Like sitting around your
house all of a sudden,

2556
01:15:53,251 --> 01:15:55,910
no Lucas stop.

2557
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:58,520
No,

2558
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:00,691
you're on a date.

2559
01:16:00,691 --> 01:16:01,740
You're trying to keep it together.

2560
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,800
You could get hacked with that kind of
technology somebody could hack into seems

2561
01:16:07,801 --> 01:16:08,251
inevitable.

2562
01:16:08,251 --> 01:16:09,380
Just like you get those.

2563
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:13,020
Like someone hacked Twitter today
and I must've got a thought.

2564
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:17,580
I'm not bullshitting a thousand
fake tweets about diet and exercise.

2565
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:18,271
Oh Wow.

2566
01:16:18,271 --> 01:16:20,370
I look so good for summer
because I started doing this.

2567
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,241
Like those,

2568
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:22,200
those bots,

2569
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:24,420
a Bot got through and just infected.

2570
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:29,640
I think the benefit of having a bunch
of people develop their own technologies

2571
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:30,720
together.

2572
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:31,411
Well No.

2573
01:16:31,411 --> 01:16:33,870
If you're developing your own
technologies for your own implants,

2574
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,580
there is some sort of,

2575
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:40,880
there's some sort of level of of security
like some people use macs because hey

2576
01:16:41,251 --> 01:16:45,810
macs don't get viruses the way pcs do
because people who want to write viruses

2577
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:48,540
are targeting pcs cause
there's more pcs around.

2578
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:52,190
I think that is a blinking
oasis in the desert.

2579
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:54,650
We're going to be able to stop
anything from getting hacked.

2580
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:56,120
I think the idea that,

2581
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,940
well first of all we've learned
about the NSA and spying.

2582
01:16:58,941 --> 01:17:00,500
It's already shown that
there's that you can't,

2583
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:01,371
you can't stop it.

2584
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:04,490
They've already got algorithms in place
already copy and all your emails because

2585
01:17:04,491 --> 01:17:04,760
of,

2586
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,570
because of bottle bottle,

2587
01:17:06,571 --> 01:17:08,600
net technology because it,

2588
01:17:08,601 --> 01:17:10,040
because can't invent

2589
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,873
our own internet.

2590
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:11,943
There is,

2591
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:17,020
we can only use that internet and that
Internet goes through certain filters

2592
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:20,180
you'd use also because these fucking
corporations have given in to their

2593
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:22,370
overlords and giving up the information.

2594
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:22,970
I mean that's it.

2595
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,470
And that's really where it comes down to.

2596
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:25,370
I don't want to live,

2597
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,090
I don't want to live in a future where
I've got artificial organs and all of the

2598
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:32,480
information from that is being pumped
out to some who the fuck knows.

2599
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:33,470
I don't,

2600
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:34,790
I don't feel comfortable with that.

2601
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:35,683
I want,

2602
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,630
I want that information
to belong to me at least,

2603
01:17:38,631 --> 01:17:41,240
so that I can do what it with what I want.

2604
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:41,661
You know,

2605
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:46,010
I don't want any advertisements because
my liver is doing whatever or I don't

2606
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:48,110
want people to be able
to shut off my liver,

2607
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:48,681
my liver,

2608
01:17:48,681 --> 01:17:50,090
cause I'm not being a good citizen.

2609
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,820
Imagine the Second Ethan Hawke Movie.

2610
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:55,040
There'd be no Snowden.

2611
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:55,480
Yeah.

2612
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,100
When his brain would have
melted out of his nose by now,

2613
01:17:58,101 --> 01:17:58,940
they just turned him up,

2614
01:17:59,150 --> 01:17:59,331
man.

2615
01:17:59,331 --> 01:17:59,841
I'm sorry.

2616
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:00,980
You guys had to take a leak.

2617
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:01,431
Go ahead.

2618
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:02,630
Go to the coconut water.

2619
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:03,840
Crushes me every time.

2620
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:06,170
Um,

2621
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:06,530
where,

2622
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:10,640
where do you think the end game is when
it comes to all this bio hacking stuff?

2623
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:11,030
What's,

2624
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:11,360
what's,

2625
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,380
what's the end game like?

2626
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:14,810
Where do you hope that it all winds up?

2627
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:19,820
Do you have like a man and I hope by
the time I'm x years old I can fly.

2628
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:21,110
I mean,

2629
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:21,551
is there a,

2630
01:18:21,551 --> 01:18:22,730
is there something like that

2631
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,290
I can go first.

2632
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,510
I see an end game as,

2633
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,350
as something way larger than
people screwing with their body.

2634
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,220
It's,

2635
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:33,053
it's,

2636
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:36,480
it's a whole bunch of
different technologies that
are happening all at once.

2637
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:41,760
And the fact that we don't have no
resources on this planet to support the

2638
01:18:41,761 --> 01:18:46,761
population growth and the amount of
people that we do have and those sorts of

2639
01:18:47,701 --> 01:18:48,720
things add together.

2640
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:53,990
I feel like when you look at a company
like space x and what space x is doing

2641
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:55,321
and,

2642
01:18:55,321 --> 01:18:59,190
and the fact that all these technologies
are leading towards longer lives,

2643
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:00,060
uh,

2644
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,770
the guy who's doing soylent,

2645
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:02,041
the,

2646
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:02,220
uh,

2647
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:04,920
food substitute guy of those dudes,

2648
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,133
dudes in New York,

2649
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:07,920
really awesome science stuff.

2650
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:08,371
Yeah.

2651
01:19:08,371 --> 01:19:09,450
Isn't it a drank it,

2652
01:19:09,451 --> 01:19:09,691
I was like,

2653
01:19:09,691 --> 01:19:10,524
what am I drinking?

2654
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:14,550
And I think all that adds
together and I think that,

2655
01:19:14,551 --> 01:19:15,001
you know,

2656
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:18,720
when we have so many people and we're
living a longer time and we have the

2657
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:21,930
ability to print anything we can conceive,

2658
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:25,170
then maybe it's time for us
to start moving out to space.

2659
01:19:25,171 --> 01:19:30,171
Maybe it's time that we can handle 20
years over to somewhere where we'll be

2660
01:19:31,081 --> 01:19:35,670
doing heavy construction work in zero g
so that other people can come there and

2661
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:39,030
live and be smarter and
move forward from there.

2662
01:19:39,031 --> 01:19:41,370
Maybe it's time to start
space colonization and

2663
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:42,980
space colonization.

2664
01:19:42,981 --> 01:19:43,814
That's where we're gone.

2665
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,750
It'd be going to be,

2666
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:47,090
Cyborg is here for us.

2667
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:48,020
He could be like,

2668
01:19:48,021 --> 01:19:50,870
download your consciousness into a
robot and send the robot in the space.

2669
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,490
I honestly think plastic brain,

2670
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:56,660
it's the smartest way to do it is to be
a side where if you're going into space,

2671
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,540
so what I've been saving
everything in space is,

2672
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:03,400
is trying to kill a biological organism.

2673
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:04,243
They can't,

2674
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:04,730
you know,

2675
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:05,060
uh,

2676
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:06,110
apes in a tin can,

2677
01:20:06,111 --> 01:20:06,944
won't cut it.

2678
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:07,993
I said what I'm saying.

2679
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:08,400
Uh,

2680
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:13,320
and I think being able to
withstand all of the crazy space,

2681
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,160
weather,

2682
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:14,491
space,

2683
01:20:14,491 --> 01:20:15,060
condition.

2684
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:15,451
Yeah.

2685
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:16,770
The conditions are insane.

2686
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:17,491
I mean,

2687
01:20:17,491 --> 01:20:17,631
the,

2688
01:20:17,631 --> 01:20:20,880
the temperature is instantly
death if you step outside,

2689
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:22,380
unless you have a pressure suit,

2690
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,040
if you get hit by any sort
of a solar flare or asteroid,

2691
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:26,770
you're done.

2692
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:27,011
Were,

2693
01:20:27,011 --> 01:20:27,340
were,

2694
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,170
were too fragile even for this planet.

2695
01:20:29,171 --> 01:20:31,210
That's why we've got this stuff on us.

2696
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:33,040
And I think motorcycle jackets and shit.

2697
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:33,953
Yeah.

2698
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:34,960
The idea of,

2699
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:35,740
of,

2700
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,310
uh,

2701
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:38,890
colonizing space as this,

2702
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,180
I don't think it's,

2703
01:20:40,181 --> 01:20:40,410
it's,

2704
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,470
it's too dangerous.

2705
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:45,840
Do you foresee a future where we really
do download our consciousness into some

2706
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,430
sort of an artificial human being?

2707
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:48,343
I,

2708
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:49,520
I don't know.

2709
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:50,563
Uh,

2710
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,690
I don't know enough about the
technology to say anything definite.

2711
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,360
I think that it's a cool idea,

2712
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,990
but I've never seen anything compelling,

2713
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,123
compelling,

2714
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:01,880
so I can't,

2715
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:02,713
I can't really say

2716
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:03,821
it's a mind fuck.

2717
01:21:03,821 --> 01:21:04,030
Oh.

2718
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:06,850
And then the idea of like a little,

2719
01:21:06,851 --> 01:21:08,560
you a little Lucas running around,

2720
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:11,830
made out of rubber and it's you,

2721
01:21:11,831 --> 01:21:13,360
your consciousness is in this thing.

2722
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:16,450
It's out there touching things
and moving stuff around.

2723
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:17,021
Yeah.

2724
01:21:17,021 --> 01:21:19,390
And also that you could duplicate a Lucas.

2725
01:21:19,391 --> 01:21:20,920
Like if you could download a Lucas,

2726
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:23,890
then you're Lucas getting
up on the on pirate bay.

2727
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:27,790
People could just be downloading you
and then sending you pictures of their

2728
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:30,660
Lucas that they've put in
some kind of habitrail.

2729
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,080
But that would definitely be another.

2730
01:21:32,081 --> 01:21:32,890
That would be another loop

2731
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:36,540
guess so because once you start
generating independent memories,

2732
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:39,390
I think you start having
different emotions,

2733
01:21:39,391 --> 01:21:40,620
different thoughts about things.

2734
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,301
Yeah.

2735
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:42,620
That's going to be really weird.

2736
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,830
Unless they all interface
somehow or another together,

2737
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:46,881
which is,

2738
01:21:46,881 --> 01:21:47,091
yeah.

2739
01:21:47,091 --> 01:21:47,450
Which,

2740
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:49,070
which I mean it is possible,

2741
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:49,371
right?

2742
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:50,480
I mean if you're dealing with,

2743
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:51,200
look,

2744
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:56,000
the idea of sending someone a video or
talking to someone through facetime or

2745
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,450
Skype in real time off your
phone seems like the dumbest,

2746
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:00,740
the craziest thing ever.

2747
01:22:00,741 --> 01:22:01,730
Like that couldn't be possible.

2748
01:22:01,731 --> 01:22:02,780
That wasn't even on Star Trek.

2749
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,880
They never even figured
that out on Star Trek.

2750
01:22:04,881 --> 01:22:05,714
But it's real.

2751
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:10,870
The idea that you and your three
clones or whatever they are could be

2752
01:22:10,881 --> 01:22:15,770
experiencing life simultaneously and that
you could multitask and that the mind

2753
01:22:15,771 --> 01:22:18,080
may evolve to concentrate
on one person or the other.

2754
01:22:18,081 --> 01:22:19,610
These two sleep or these two are out,

2755
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:20,331
you know,

2756
01:22:20,331 --> 01:22:22,790
and you're doing two different
things at the same time and aware,

2757
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:24,110
tuning into either one,

2758
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:25,551
whatever you choose.

2759
01:22:25,551 --> 01:22:27,890
It's sorta like touching your leg with
your left hand while you're writing

2760
01:22:27,891 --> 01:22:28,850
something with your right hand.

2761
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,380
It's going to be a problem man.

2762
01:22:30,381 --> 01:22:33,140
You're going to have
swarms of individuals.

2763
01:22:33,141 --> 01:22:37,060
There's going to be Rogan
swarms like kingus Khan,

2764
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:38,140
like Gingiss cons,

2765
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:42,110
responsible for like something like 5%
of the population's DNA cause they just,

2766
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:42,561
you know,

2767
01:22:42,561 --> 01:22:46,280
he went on a party and spraying the 12
hundreds and the whole world has never

2768
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:47,030
recovered.

2769
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:47,780
You know?

2770
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:51,950
Imagine if you're doing that
artificially stuff that's that powerful.

2771
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:54,320
All of a sudden it
becomes really important.

2772
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:57,680
Who has control of that
technology and the initial five.

2773
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:58,700
But how do you enforce that?

2774
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,710
It's a race.

2775
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:01,460
It's a race.

2776
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:01,971
Hold on a second.

2777
01:23:01,971 --> 01:23:02,804
What?

2778
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:04,123
What about them?

2779
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:08,710
About it's cough cause that's where
he wants to create is this whole army.

2780
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:09,360
Did you guys,

2781
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,450
you want to create an army?

2782
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,633
Well,

2783
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:12,990
not an army army,

2784
01:23:12,991 --> 01:23:14,430
but a whole group of people.

2785
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,350
He does live forever.

2786
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,220
Um,

2787
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:18,791
did you,

2788
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:19,300
uh,

2789
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,280
pay attention to the global future 20,

2790
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:22,750
45 conference?

2791
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:23,111
Yeah,

2792
01:23:23,111 --> 01:23:24,550
I know about the 2045 guys.

2793
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,780
What do you guys think about that?

2794
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:27,863
Um,

2795
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,460
I like that,

2796
01:23:29,461 --> 01:23:29,970
uh,

2797
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:33,360
that they're working
towards a solid project,

2798
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:33,750
uh,

2799
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:36,030
because that's kind of rare in
the transhumanist community.

2800
01:23:36,031 --> 01:23:41,031
There's just a lot of
Scifi talk way too much,

2801
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,593
just too much.

2802
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:43,693
That's fine.

2803
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:47,410
Discontent and the transhumanist
community debating on how to handle this

2804
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:49,180
correctly of know what
the fuck he's doing,

2805
01:23:49,181 --> 01:23:50,014
what his robots.

2806
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,310
But uh,

2807
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:51,810
I liked,

2808
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:54,870
I liked the fact that they have a
goal that they're working towards.

2809
01:23:54,871 --> 01:23:55,590
I just,

2810
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:57,660
I fear that,

2811
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,593
uh,

2812
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,830
there'll be a particular
group of people that'll,

2813
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:05,040
that'll get it and then
just fuck us for eternity.

2814
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,040
That's your big fear,

2815
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:10,000
your big fear of someone else getting
ahold of the goods first and not giving

2816
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:11,830
you the super chip.

2817
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:12,040
I,

2818
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,360
I fear about the type of people that'll,

2819
01:24:14,361 --> 01:24:19,361
that'll get it first because the world
didn't fair well when a particular people

2820
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:21,050
set of people got the gun first.

2821
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,560
That wasn't good for a
lot of the human species.

2822
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:25,580
Well,

2823
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,910
it was good for us though.

2824
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,111
That's how you're here,

2825
01:24:28,111 --> 01:24:28,501
dude.

2826
01:24:28,501 --> 01:24:31,320
That's how you sitting on the Internet
and I know with a plastic microphone in

2827
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:32,730
front of you sucked out of the earth.

2828
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,990
I would verted from oil.

2829
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:34,861
I would rather,

2830
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:38,910
I would rather not have to move forward
with that sort of contention and

2831
01:24:38,911 --> 01:24:41,060
fighting and just pee.

2832
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:41,431
I don't,

2833
01:24:41,431 --> 01:24:44,130
I don't think is that
inevitable with enlightenment.

2834
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,940
I mean we have w w w whether or
not we've achieved enlightenment,

2835
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:48,811
we certainly haven't,

2836
01:24:48,811 --> 01:24:50,280
but at the highest levels of humanity,

2837
01:24:50,281 --> 01:24:54,450
I think people are probably more aware
and tuned in today than at any other time

2838
01:24:54,451 --> 01:24:59,040
in history and it's probably way safer
today than any other time in history.

2839
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:01,680
Even though there's a lot of crazy
shit that goes down on a regular basis.

2840
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:03,720
If you compared your
everyday life to that.

2841
01:25:03,721 --> 01:25:08,160
If someone living in Siberia in the 12
hundreds in the Mongols came storming in

2842
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:08,600
it,

2843
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:09,720
we live a lot better.

2844
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,850
It's a pretty pretty God damn good.

2845
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:12,150
I,

2846
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:16,380
and I think that a big part of that is
technology and the access to information,

2847
01:25:16,381 --> 01:25:18,870
the access to information
is freer than ever before.

2848
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,390
Technology more powerful than ever before.

2849
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,420
Hence people are safer and
people were more moral.

2850
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:28,560
I really do believe that and I think
the idea of people being moral is more

2851
01:25:28,561 --> 01:25:32,820
accepted as not just something that
has to be enforced in order to keep the

2852
01:25:32,821 --> 01:25:33,151
peace,

2853
01:25:33,151 --> 01:25:36,750
but that's something that's beneficial
and something that you would should

2854
01:25:36,751 --> 01:25:37,381
strive for.

2855
01:25:37,381 --> 01:25:38,214
It's admirable.

2856
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:42,240
I think that that really meant it might
not have existed on such a mass scale in

2857
01:25:42,241 --> 01:25:42,721
the past,

2858
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,310
even in the past 20 or 30 years.

2859
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:49,170
I think we're dealing with like pretty
unprecedented times and it sounds like

2860
01:25:49,171 --> 01:25:50,190
really super,

2861
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:50,820
you know,

2862
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,541
optimistic.

2863
01:25:51,541 --> 01:25:55,860
But I feel like one of the byproducts
of this technology that we're all

2864
01:25:55,861 --> 01:26:00,450
experiencing is that we're experiencing
a sort of mini enlightenment and a a

2865
01:26:00,451 --> 01:26:02,700
burst of enlightenment
because of this information.

2866
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:04,070
If that is the case,

2867
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,560
I think that this kind of technology,

2868
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:09,230
that it sort of dissolves more boundary.

2869
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:14,180
I don't think it's going to lead to a
constriction of the people that utilize

2870
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:14,271
it.

2871
01:26:14,271 --> 01:26:18,290
I think it's going to lead to a
freedom of the species itself.

2872
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:19,760
I really do believe that.

2873
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,330
I think that if I look at the,

2874
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,360
the trend,

2875
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:25,400
even though everybody wants
to think the sky is falling,

2876
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,810
the trend is an indicate that,

2877
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,830
that the sky is falling for some people
in some spots and the apocalypse is

2878
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:31,670
right now,

2879
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:32,201
if you live in,

2880
01:26:32,201 --> 01:26:32,930
in the Congo,

2881
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:33,860
if you're in Liberia,

2882
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:35,360
the apocalypse is today.

2883
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:36,980
That's Mad Max,

2884
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:37,580
right?

2885
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:38,780
That's going on right now.

2886
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:39,913
So,

2887
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,570
but the trend for us here,

2888
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:43,100
it's obviously not in that direction.

2889
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:46,460
I mean it seems like there's always
going to be a worst case scenario on this

2890
01:26:46,461 --> 01:26:47,120
planet,

2891
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,780
but that worst case scenario is far better
today than it's ever been in history.

2892
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:54,170
And the best case scenario
was completely nonexistent.

2893
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,390
Even in science fiction novels,

2894
01:26:58,610 --> 01:26:59,450
it's going in that way.

2895
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:00,340
You can't stop it.

2896
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:00,581
Yeah.

2897
01:27:00,581 --> 01:27:01,630
Wait until one of these,

2898
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:03,230
one of these people in Venice,

2899
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,410
swarm of Nano,

2900
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:07,420
it goes flying out of their
basement devouring toddlers.

2901
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,110
I mean,

2902
01:27:08,110 --> 01:27:11,980
the thing is like I liked
the toddlers Sandler.

2903
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:13,440
It's a fun word to say.

2904
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:14,020
It's your thing.

2905
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:15,070
You always go with dead baby,

2906
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,033
but,

2907
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:16,631
but no,

2908
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:18,970
I think that when you're talking
about this kind of stuff,

2909
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:19,690
you're,

2910
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:21,280
you're talking about acceleration.

2911
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:24,270
I think you're talking about
a technological acceleration
and wherever there's

2912
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,120
acceleration,

2913
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:28,660
there's an increased
chance of hurting yourself.

2914
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:31,270
If you're on a skateboard
going a few miles per hour,

2915
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:31,961
you're fine.

2916
01:27:31,961 --> 01:27:33,580
If you're on a skateboard going downhill,

2917
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:34,750
you can wipe out.

2918
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:35,081
Well,

2919
01:27:35,081 --> 01:27:40,081
humanity is on this
technological skateboard that's
exponentially accelerating

2920
01:27:40,481 --> 01:27:41,830
and in that way,

2921
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:46,060
the role of the individual becomes
more and more and more intense,

2922
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,980
which means that with this kind of stuff,

2923
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:52,630
when the individual has access to the
kind of technology that they have today,

2924
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,280
they can do a ton of damage.

2925
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,750
Look what happened with those freaks.

2926
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:58,750
All they needed was a pressure cooker
and some ball bearings and they

2927
01:27:59,050 --> 01:27:59,920
permanently,

2928
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:00,590
yeah,

2929
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:04,630
they killed so many people and traumatize
so many others in the same way.

2930
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,130
Five years from now.

2931
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,430
What happens with when people
have access to this kind of stuff,

2932
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:09,880
it is day.

2933
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:10,713
It is.

2934
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:12,280
We are setting ourselves up,

2935
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,250
but for your time

2936
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:18,250
about very unique in
individual circumstances in
comparison to the 7 billion

2937
01:28:18,591 --> 01:28:21,380
people experiencing things completely
differently all around the world.

2938
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:26,030
The problem is that you're dealing with
7 billion people that have access to the

2939
01:28:26,031 --> 01:28:27,030
internet or at least a,

2940
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:30,680
a good percentage of them and
have their stories being told.

2941
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,450
So you're hearing about instances
all over the world simultaneously.

2942
01:28:35,451 --> 01:28:36,284
All at once.

2943
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,760
We're not designed for that were designed
to take in information from our local

2944
01:28:40,761 --> 01:28:41,420
community,

2945
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:44,870
were designed to take information from
all these abandoned dudes are about a

2946
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:46,760
mile away on foot and they're
coming here to fuck our women.

2947
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:47,960
That's normal.

2948
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,250
That's what we're supposed to deal with.

2949
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,460
You're not supposed to deal with a story
about a guy in Switzerland and fucked

2950
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:53,294
his pig to death.

2951
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:53,730
You know,

2952
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:56,780
you know you're not supposed to
deal with this guy in Detroit.

2953
01:28:56,781 --> 01:28:57,421
This got a,

2954
01:28:57,421 --> 01:28:59,590
a fake bigfoot in his cooler,

2955
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:00,473
the outback.

2956
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:00,900
These are,

2957
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:01,830
these are all,

2958
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:02,070
you

2959
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,380
know,

2960
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:03,060
this is,

2961
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:03,631
this is just,

2962
01:29:03,631 --> 01:29:08,631
you're dealing with so many human beings
and impossible number of 7 billion and

2963
01:29:09,121 --> 01:29:12,360
you're getting information from
vast number of those people.

2964
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:15,090
So you're always going to get these
freaks you're always going to get.

2965
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:16,920
But it's still the trend.

2966
01:29:16,921 --> 01:29:19,520
The overall trend batter is
way better than it's ever.

2967
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,410
And I agree with you there.

2968
01:29:21,411 --> 01:29:21,780
I,

2969
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:22,040
I,

2970
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:27,040
my hope would be that we become more
ethical before we get the power to cause

2971
01:29:27,711 --> 01:29:28,161
damage.

2972
01:29:28,161 --> 01:29:28,850
So we,

2973
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:30,830
even though we're more ethical now,

2974
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:35,690
any ethical mishap at this point
would be a lot more disastrous.

2975
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:39,920
It's not so bad when the most
powerful weapon you have is a sword.

2976
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:40,850
Uh,

2977
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:41,340
yeah.

2978
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:45,640
Well that's not true cause [inaudible]
70 million people doing worse than a

2979
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,260
sword and a lot of people,

2980
01:29:47,261 --> 01:29:48,260
a lot of other dudes with them,

2981
01:29:48,261 --> 01:29:49,730
but they did it with horses,

2982
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:50,540
right?

2983
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:51,261
70 million.

2984
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:52,820
Any ball over his lifetime with horses.

2985
01:29:52,821 --> 01:29:57,821
But the scenario is you have
three d printers and let's
imagine three d printers

2986
01:29:57,981 --> 01:29:58,850
in 200 years,

2987
01:29:58,851 --> 01:30:02,270
where now you can like
molecularly assemble stuff
and somewhere along this 200

2988
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,300
years someone discovered anti-matter.

2989
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:05,000
Right.

2990
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,440
So let's imagine that there's
a way someone could create
a anti-matter that when

2991
01:30:09,441 --> 01:30:10,400
it met,

2992
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:12,440
matter would dissolve the universe.

2993
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,540
Let's just say there's
an imaginary technology.

2994
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,210
They could open up a note side
of what's going to happen.

2995
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:20,540
A few people are going to die and then
it's going to force everyone to learn how

2996
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:24,760
to be really nice to everyone because
everyone can create a fucking anti-matter

2997
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,300
bomb in their computer.

2998
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:26,781
That's what I,

2999
01:30:26,781 --> 01:30:27,260
that's right.

3000
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:27,411
Yeah.

3001
01:30:27,411 --> 01:30:27,790
That's what I,

3002
01:30:27,790 --> 01:30:28,610
that's what I hope.

3003
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:29,241
That's what I mean.

3004
01:30:29,241 --> 01:30:32,500
They sale well on population
is a polite population.

3005
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:33,170
Well,

3006
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:35,570
I mean the way to take it
to the complete next level,

3007
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:40,880
black holes all throughout our
planet that were created by assholes.

3008
01:30:40,881 --> 01:30:44,780
We're going to have to hop over on our
way to seven 11 there's a black hole over

3009
01:30:44,781 --> 01:30:45,170
there.

3010
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:45,790
Thank you.

3011
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:46,140
Yeah.

3012
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:46,973
Something

3013
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,460
humanism that people
don't talk enough about,

3014
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,430
I think is making people more ethical.

3015
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:55,760
I think there's only talk of making
people more capable and intelligent.

3016
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:56,490
That's an implicitly,

3017
01:30:56,490 --> 01:31:01,010
there is no talk of making people
nicer for the sake of just living in a,

3018
01:31:01,011 --> 01:31:03,920
in a more sane world
because we're nice now.

3019
01:31:03,921 --> 01:31:07,760
But what happens if infrastructure goes
away and they become hungry again and

3020
01:31:07,761 --> 01:31:10,040
we've got lots of weapons
around what happens?

3021
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:11,300
And it would,

3022
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:16,300
it would take a longer period to build
back up in this state rather than if we

3023
01:31:16,431 --> 01:31:21,080
were nicer and had forethought instead
of having hunger automatically take over

3024
01:31:21,081 --> 01:31:21,501
and be like,

3025
01:31:21,501 --> 01:31:21,711
well,

3026
01:31:21,711 --> 01:31:22,341
fuck that guy.

3027
01:31:22,341 --> 01:31:23,174
He has food.

3028
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,073
You know,

3029
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:24,890
we,

3030
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:28,160
I think that we should start
having a discussion about,

3031
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:28,670
uh,

3032
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:30,950
making people more ethical,

3033
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:31,761
uh,

3034
01:31:31,761 --> 01:31:32,051
and,

3035
01:31:32,051 --> 01:31:37,051
and be able to empathize with even
other species because who knows,

3036
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:38,323
uh,

3037
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:42,590
who knows what we will run into in the
future and that might be important.

3038
01:31:42,770 --> 01:31:45,090
That's interesting that you brought
that up because that was something that

3039
01:31:45,091 --> 01:31:48,990
Dimitri Itzkoff actually touched on in
the conversation that I had with him,

3040
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:52,320
where he was talking about that being
an important part of this whole movement

3041
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:55,970
and that the movement wasn't just about
achieving some new technological state.

3042
01:31:55,990 --> 01:32:00,580
It's about Everlane elevating
humanity as a whole overall.

3043
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:04,030
And I thought that was really
interesting that he is taking that into

3044
01:32:04,031 --> 01:32:04,631
consideration.

3045
01:32:04,631 --> 01:32:06,760
That's one of the reasons
why in this global future,

3046
01:32:06,761 --> 01:32:09,720
25 2045 um,

3047
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:10,511
that's what it was,

3048
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:10,720
right?

3049
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,441
Global Future,

3050
01:32:11,441 --> 01:32:13,690
2045 conference that he had,

3051
01:32:13,691 --> 01:32:17,410
he brought in a lot of religious and
spiritual leaders to sort of ask some

3052
01:32:17,411 --> 01:32:20,530
questions of these different face to try
to get an understanding of what their

3053
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:25,680
philosophies were and how they would
incorporate this sort of new impending

3054
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:27,460
technology.

3055
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:29,590
Is transhumanism idea,

3056
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,690
had it w were it to come to fruition.

3057
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:33,400
It was really pretty fascinating stuff.

3058
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:33,880
I mean,

3059
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:36,760
he didn't just take it from
the technological standpoint,

3060
01:32:36,761 --> 01:32:38,260
it's cough really delve.

3061
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,280
He dove into the psychological and
the spiritual aspects of it as well,

3062
01:32:42,281 --> 01:32:46,390
which I thought was a unique and
admirable and probably pretty important.

3063
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:47,860
If this thing moves further,

3064
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:49,080
you're going to have some brick,

3065
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:50,560
real ethical questions.

3066
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:55,410
We develop immortal cyber beings
with skin made out of spider webs.

3067
01:32:55,411 --> 01:32:55,811
Silk.

3068
01:32:55,811 --> 01:32:56,710
That's bulletproof.

3069
01:32:58,250 --> 01:32:59,051
I mean there's already,

3070
01:32:59,051 --> 01:32:59,680
that's common.

3071
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:00,513
The track team anymore.

3072
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:01,181
They're already there.

3073
01:33:01,181 --> 01:33:02,170
He figured out how to do that.

3074
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:02,790
Yeah,

3075
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:03,850
the transhumanist,

3076
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:04,684
the Mormon,

3077
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:07,370
but that's,

3078
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:08,893
that's a real thing.

3079
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:10,420
It's like saying gays for Jesus.

3080
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:11,540
Yeah.

3081
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:11,830
Is,

3082
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:12,581
that's hilarious.

3083
01:33:12,581 --> 01:33:17,320
There is humanist Mormonism
subset of the Mormon community.

3084
01:33:17,321 --> 01:33:18,730
The problem is if you're
willing to be in a Mormon,

3085
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:19,720
you're fucking willing to be anything.

3086
01:33:19,721 --> 01:33:21,490
It's just a matter of who
rings your doorbell first.

3087
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,613
You know?

3088
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,390
It's like just to sit them down
and talk them into anything.

3089
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,500
You're a Mormon.

3090
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:27,880
We believe a 14 year old,

3091
01:33:27,881 --> 01:33:28,031
they've,

3092
01:33:28,031 --> 01:33:33,031
Joseph Smith in 1820 found golden tablets
that contained the loss work of Jesus

3093
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:35,770
and only he could read him
cause he had a magic rock.

3094
01:33:36,490 --> 01:33:37,960
No wonder whether afraid of gay marriage,

3095
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:38,943
your family,

3096
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,300
because if someone could
talk into being a Mormon,

3097
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,550
they can talk in a blowing them too.

3098
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:45,910
That's the job that's
right out of my standup.

3099
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:46,431
God dammit.

3100
01:33:46,431 --> 01:33:47,620
He got me doing my own material.

3101
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:48,533
God,

3102
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:49,460
you are the,

3103
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:52,660
you're a part of a movement right now,

3104
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,580
whether you call it grinders,

3105
01:33:54,581 --> 01:33:55,900
a transhumanism or whatever,

3106
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,860
you're a part of a movement where you're
focusing on a very specific thing.

3107
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:03,790
You're focusing on
incorporating technology into
the body to improve the body

3108
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:07,240
and as long as you're focusing on that
and as long as there's a whole community

3109
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:08,080
focusing on that,

3110
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:11,990
whether or not now it's just magnets and
the fingers is everybody's poo poo in

3111
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,461
it and saying,

3112
01:34:12,461 --> 01:34:16,900
what's the big deal is going to come a
time where it's a lot more than that.

3113
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:21,930
Whether it's some new
invention of something that
has absolutely no a rejection

3114
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:23,321
in the human body,

3115
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:24,970
so you can add all kinds of things,

3116
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:30,250
whether that some new technology comes
along that radically enhances perception,

3117
01:34:30,251 --> 01:34:34,300
whether it's visual or hearing
or thinking cognitive function.

3118
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,440
The ability to read each other's minds.

3119
01:34:35,441 --> 01:34:36,580
As long as you both have the chip,

3120
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,051
it's all going to happen,

3121
01:34:38,051 --> 01:34:38,884
right?

3122
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:41,200
Like you can't text message
someone who doesn't have a phone.

3123
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:42,101
Okay?

3124
01:34:42,101 --> 01:34:42,851
But if they have a phone,

3125
01:34:42,851 --> 01:34:43,930
you can text him pretty easy.

3126
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:48,580
And once we all have something like that
in our head and it's like your phone

3127
01:34:48,581 --> 01:34:50,050
will work with your friends' phones.

3128
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,161
Oh Em Gee,

3129
01:34:51,161 --> 01:34:53,200
I'm looking at you right now
and I'm writing this down.

3130
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:53,500
You know,

3131
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,420
there's going to be
those moments where we,

3132
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:58,190
we hit some next level
that we didn't see common.

3133
01:34:58,370 --> 01:34:59,900
Just like we didn't see
the internet comment.

3134
01:34:59,901 --> 01:35:01,310
We didn't see cell phones come in.

3135
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:03,530
No one saw that shit coming again.

3136
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:04,520
Even star track.

3137
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:05,910
They had a fucking walkie-talkie.

3138
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:06,740
Man.

3139
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:07,430
Perk out.

3140
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:07,700
Yeah,

3141
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,990
like say that to shut it.

3142
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:10,243
It'll flip it open.

3143
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:11,083
It's so stupid.

3144
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:12,440
They didn't see iPads.

3145
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:13,370
I didn't see any of that shit.

3146
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:16,400
And you guys are right
on the crest of the wave.

3147
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:19,400
Right on the crest of the
technological tsunami.

3148
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:21,920
Getting sucked into the singularity is,

3149
01:35:21,921 --> 01:35:25,400
we're all getting torn
towards that waterfall.

3150
01:35:25,401 --> 01:35:27,770
You guys are in the
canoes at the very front,

3151
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:32,330
how far would you be willing to take it
if someone came up with some real Steve

3152
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:32,331
Austin?

3153
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:34,490
$6 million man arms and legs.

3154
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:37,550
They just had a saw your shit
off and put on some new ones.

3155
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,970
Would you be down if you knew
if were like a whole bunch.

3156
01:35:40,971 --> 01:35:43,640
It was like fake tits where
everybody was doing it.

3157
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:45,200
If it got to that point,

3158
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,210
I guess everyone was doing it,

3159
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:48,193
we'd all do it.

3160
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:48,461
Yeah.

3161
01:35:48,461 --> 01:35:51,650
It came up to like a woman in the 18
hundreds oh it came up to a pilgrim or

3162
01:35:51,651 --> 01:35:52,820
something and said,

3163
01:35:52,821 --> 01:35:53,450
listen,

3164
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:53,930
I like,

3165
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:55,370
I like when you look like,

3166
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:56,600
but I'm thinking,

3167
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:57,320
Hey,

3168
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,580
some bags of water,

3169
01:35:58,581 --> 01:36:00,620
a surgically implanted under your breasts.

3170
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:04,730
You know you get a lot more
attention around the tax bags.

3171
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:06,420
They didn't even have this bag,

3172
01:36:06,421 --> 01:36:07,280
didn't have plastic,

3173
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:09,260
but they would think you're fucking crazy.

3174
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:10,460
Are we going to think,

3175
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:14,210
I mean is that US looking at the future
about like it's going to be standard.

3176
01:36:14,211 --> 01:36:15,560
Like you still have your arms and legs.

3177
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:16,281
Oh my God,

3178
01:36:16,281 --> 01:36:16,750
girl.

3179
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:17,583
What are you doing?

3180
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:18,410
What is that?

3181
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:18,840
Yeah,

3182
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,090
that'd be the end of rape.

3183
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:24,890
Everybody's just fucking super robot
retro thing though to have them fight off

3184
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:25,724
everybody.

3185
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:26,071
Yeah.

3186
01:36:26,071 --> 01:36:30,920
I think that Richard Gums in the cubs and
expression of yourself kind of the way

3187
01:36:30,921 --> 01:36:32,840
that body modification is already.

3188
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:34,040
No.

3189
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:39,040
Why would I replace perfectly good arms
and legs when I could have extra or

3190
01:36:39,231 --> 01:36:41,770
maybe something that ingredient,

3191
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:44,780
see greedy motherfucker trying
to give me a super body like,

3192
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:44,961
oh,

3193
01:36:44,961 --> 01:36:47,510
but I have those three
dicks but by the way,

3194
01:36:47,511 --> 01:36:48,131
then you got it.

3195
01:36:48,131 --> 01:36:51,870
Arms for us would be great if Shava
maybe that's what she was all about me.

3196
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:52,723
That is the feature.

3197
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,320
A futuristic holy shit.

3198
01:36:54,321 --> 01:36:55,130
I never even thought of that.

3199
01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:56,390
Maybe that's what that was all about.

3200
01:36:56,690 --> 01:36:59,060
Some crazy transhumanists from the past.

3201
01:36:59,090 --> 01:37:02,810
Maybe they figured it out a long time ago
and they're just barely wrote it down.

3202
01:37:02,811 --> 01:37:03,644
They were so high,

3203
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:07,760
the road down like they were still a few
passages in the Bhagavad Gita and then

3204
01:37:07,761 --> 01:37:08,930
went back to eat mushrooms.

3205
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:11,260
Hold on 600 is that what it says?

3206
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:16,420
But I do like that you ask somebody
who has magnets under his hands.

3207
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:18,890
If he had replaced his
arms with the robot arms,

3208
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:20,780
the answer was yes,

3209
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:21,890
of course you would do it.

3210
01:37:21,891 --> 01:37:24,160
And even even if no one else was doing,

3211
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:26,330
if you couldn't enjoy like
foot massages anymore,

3212
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,470
would you replace your legs?

3213
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,430
If they were just numb,

3214
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:30,950
they were numb but awesome
like jumping over buildings,

3215
01:37:30,951 --> 01:37:32,240
running 60 miles an hour,

3216
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:33,440
but they were numb.

3217
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:33,980
You know,

3218
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,450
you don't feel good massage.

3219
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,353
Are you saying that

3220
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:39,643
you feel nothing?

3221
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:42,400
I don't think it has to be a uh,

3222
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:43,160
a trade off.

3223
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,060
I might have to be,

3224
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:47,210
but if you keep your cock and balls
but the bottom of your sack is numb.

3225
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,750
The only way you can feel your
balls if someone squeezes them,

3226
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:53,480
but the legs on down fake as fuck.

3227
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:55,560
Super powerful Pistons and

3228
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:56,551
then you know,

3229
01:37:56,551 --> 01:37:57,384
nuclear power

3230
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:58,241
jump over tree.

3231
01:37:58,241 --> 01:38:01,810
You're saying I could jump over trees
but my falls are not all in the bottom.

3232
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:03,070
The bottom of your balls or no?

3233
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,073
Yeah,

3234
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:12,830
I'll take all the way to that.

3235
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:16,030
You think you would be willing to go
through an operation of it removes your

3236
01:38:16,031 --> 01:38:16,360
legs.

3237
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:16,511
I mean,

3238
01:38:16,511 --> 01:38:18,580
what if they get operations like look,

3239
01:38:18,581 --> 01:38:22,300
a long time ago you just
something like a fake tit would,

3240
01:38:22,330 --> 01:38:25,180
you'd probably die if someone
tried to do that to you.

3241
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:28,200
You would die just from the fact they
didn't know how to sterilize you.

3242
01:38:28,201 --> 01:38:30,280
You didn't have any way
of putting you under.

3243
01:38:30,281 --> 01:38:31,350
Sure it was.

3244
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:32,740
It would be nothing today,

3245
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,450
but back then it was a serious,

3246
01:38:34,451 --> 01:38:35,140
serious thing.

3247
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:37,240
Today girls go back to
work in a couple of days.

3248
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:38,860
The idea on the why,

3249
01:38:38,861 --> 01:38:39,910
I keep going back to fake tits.

3250
01:38:39,911 --> 01:38:43,810
I'm trying to find a nonsexist way
of approaching this and far as male

3251
01:38:43,811 --> 01:38:44,590
enhancement,

3252
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:47,950
but I can't find anything that's a
standard as the craziness of Male,

3253
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:49,560
a female breast enhancement.

3254
01:38:49,561 --> 01:38:50,500
It's one of the weirdest things.

3255
01:38:50,501 --> 01:38:51,334
Human beings still,

3256
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:53,230
but tried to,

3257
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:56,530
if we get to some point
where amputating legs,

3258
01:38:56,531 --> 01:39:00,680
it's like nothing and we're replacing
with an artificial one superpower.

3259
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:04,630
Think that the difference between
a breast implant and fake leg,

3260
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:05,381
right?

3261
01:39:05,381 --> 01:39:09,520
Is that already my knees
are given out already.

3262
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:10,470
My,

3263
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:12,370
my legs are going to wear out.

3264
01:39:12,371 --> 01:39:12,990
Stop right there.

3265
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:14,470
I had three tests.

3266
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,800
Three kids rather it you to
chicks tits who's had three kids.

3267
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,331
Everything wears out,

3268
01:39:19,331 --> 01:39:19,661
man.

3269
01:39:19,661 --> 01:39:20,530
We're made out of flesh.

3270
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:20,861
Right.

3271
01:39:20,861 --> 01:39:23,860
Would've been way better if I said
it's mother missed opportunity.

3272
01:39:23,861 --> 01:39:24,694
We stumbled.

3273
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:25,900
We do wear out.

3274
01:39:25,901 --> 01:39:26,740
You're totally right.

3275
01:39:26,741 --> 01:39:28,330
There's nothing different
between those two.

3276
01:39:28,331 --> 01:39:29,440
But we were out.

3277
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:30,070
Yeah.

3278
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:32,530
When we did eventually your choice,

3279
01:39:32,531 --> 01:39:36,490
it might be shitty legs or better legs

3280
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,710
or maybe the fix the fix the um,

3281
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:40,550
under sac and you know,

3282
01:39:40,551 --> 01:39:44,060
come up with some new technology that
even though the under sac is artificial,

3283
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:45,740
it has sensors and it sends it,

3284
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:51,290
I would just like everybody here to
stop pretending that if they had super

3285
01:39:51,291 --> 01:39:52,730
powerful robot legs,

3286
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,440
you wouldn't get your legs
amputated and replace.

3287
01:39:55,450 --> 01:39:56,160
If I see what,

3288
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:57,950
I wouldn't be worried about
the fact that they're numb.

3289
01:39:57,951 --> 01:39:58,850
That's a weird thing,

3290
01:39:58,851 --> 01:39:59,450
man.

3291
01:39:59,450 --> 01:40:01,340
I would want someone to
do it for jumping over.

3292
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:04,480
Treat people already working on that.

3293
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:05,090
You know,

3294
01:40:05,090 --> 01:40:05,960
the field your face.

3295
01:40:05,961 --> 01:40:06,141
Yeah.

3296
01:40:06,141 --> 01:40:08,510
That feel people already an end.

3297
01:40:08,511 --> 01:40:13,160
We're working towards a more sensitive
prosthetics that you can feel more.

3298
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:13,910
Right.

3299
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:15,710
And you can pretty soon.

3300
01:40:15,711 --> 01:40:18,980
I'm hoping that you can even dial it
so that if you're going to do something

3301
01:40:18,981 --> 01:40:20,180
dangerous or painful,

3302
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:21,830
you can dial the pain down,

3303
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:22,670
whatever.

3304
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:24,860
It becomes optional at that point.

3305
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:26,510
It why would you keep these?

3306
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:27,440
These aren't modular.

3307
01:40:27,441 --> 01:40:28,490
You can't switch them.

3308
01:40:28,491 --> 01:40:29,390
They don't rotate.

3309
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:30,140
Yeah.

3310
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:30,800
Why?

3311
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:31,251
Why would you?

3312
01:40:31,251 --> 01:40:31,700
Why?

3313
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:33,740
Because they feel good when
you hold someone's hands,

3314
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:34,611
but you can,

3315
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:36,700
you can always put over a layer of,

3316
01:40:36,701 --> 01:40:37,670
of soft stuff.

3317
01:40:37,690 --> 01:40:37,960
Why

3318
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,660
not just pretend you're
alive and jump off a bridge?

3319
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:42,940
I mean it's at what point
in time do we end this?

3320
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:43,800
Okay.

3321
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,770
You get your whole body is going to be
this fake robot body and you're needing

3322
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:51,640
to take what is the memories of your
life and your consciousness and download

3323
01:40:51,641 --> 01:40:56,530
them into some computer chip and then
the sh the you rots and this dream you

3324
01:40:56,531 --> 01:40:58,930
goes wandering around to
get batteries run out.

3325
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:00,280
Yes.

3326
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,500
Thinking you're really living
on a farm with the Waltons.

3327
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:02,831
Meanwhile,

3328
01:41:02,831 --> 01:41:04,660
you're a stupid thing with a battery.

3329
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:06,820
You don't even know what the
fuck's going on with your life.

3330
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:07,950
Meanwhile you're some,

3331
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:12,400
you're like holding hands on the beach
and getting foot massages while all of us

3332
01:41:12,401 --> 01:41:16,150
are bounding through the
universe jumping over buildings,

3333
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:20,230
but I'm just playing devil's advocate,

3334
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:23,770
but there always are those people that
want to hold everything back and go what?

3335
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,050
Like there was those assholes
that we were listening to.

3336
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:31,650
Science has yet to explain how a seed
becomes a beautiful flower and the spa.

3337
01:41:32,411 --> 01:41:32,951
Yes,

3338
01:41:32,951 --> 01:41:34,780
actually it has dummy.

3339
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:35,470
You know,

3340
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:36,330
we were listening to these,

3341
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:39,100
some of these religious people talking
at that conference were just there.

3342
01:41:39,150 --> 01:41:44,150
The ideas were so stupid and antiquated
can lean on to the the mysteries that

3343
01:41:44,651 --> 01:41:45,610
have already been solved,

3344
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:47,830
but in what we were talking about before,

3345
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:49,960
those mysteries that have been solved,

3346
01:41:49,961 --> 01:41:53,470
when we do understand the mechanism
behind the seed becoming a flower,

3347
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:57,880
make it even more fascinating because
even though we understand the process now,

3348
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:58,600
it's still,

3349
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,231
wow,

3350
01:41:59,231 --> 01:42:00,070
that's cool.

3351
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:02,230
Before it used to be a while.

3352
01:42:02,231 --> 01:42:03,490
That flower is beautiful.

3353
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:04,630
What a mystery.

3354
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,850
I'm so glad God brought this to my life.

3355
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:07,961
Now we're like,

3356
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:08,860
isn't this incredible?

3357
01:42:08,861 --> 01:42:12,760
This seed got oxygen and then minerals
from the soil and then it converts it

3358
01:42:12,761 --> 01:42:16,330
into energy and then it's photosynthesis
and it grows and then the flowers

3359
01:42:16,331 --> 01:42:16,720
blooms.

3360
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:17,620
This is insane.

3361
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:19,660
It's like the whole
process behind it is like,

3362
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:24,610
it's like so mind boggling and
enriching and as a human being,

3363
01:42:24,611 --> 01:42:28,510
that's one of the things that like really
jazzes us up when we learn new shit,

3364
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:29,920
when we discover new shit,

3365
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:30,880
it's part of like the,

3366
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:32,320
like when you tell someone something,

3367
01:42:32,321 --> 01:42:32,441
go,

3368
01:42:32,441 --> 01:42:33,041
Whoa,

3369
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:33,874
that's cool.

3370
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:35,740
Like we were talking
earlier today about this,

3371
01:42:35,741 --> 01:42:36,130
um,

3372
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:37,300
this discovery,

3373
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:37,841
these,

3374
01:42:37,841 --> 01:42:38,050
uh,

3375
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:38,830
scientists,

3376
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:39,071
uh,

3377
01:42:39,071 --> 01:42:39,400
in,

3378
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:39,940
uh,

3379
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:42,970
Germany and in Germany and America,

3380
01:42:43,510 --> 01:42:48,510
they have discovered this new type
of animal that used to be like a,

3381
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:51,940
an ancestor of the human being
that's from 41,000 years ago.

3382
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,240
They thought it might be a neanderthal.

3383
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:54,910
They thought it might be a homosapien.

3384
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:58,360
And it turned out to be some new thing
that they didn't even know existed.

3385
01:42:58,540 --> 01:42:59,081
It's called,

3386
01:42:59,081 --> 01:43:00,330
they're calling it at Dennis.

3387
01:43:00,331 --> 01:43:01,164
So van,

3388
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:02,530
based on where they found it,

3389
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:05,170
and when we were talking about it before,

3390
01:43:05,171 --> 01:43:05,741
we were all like,

3391
01:43:05,741 --> 01:43:06,580
whoa,

3392
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:07,431
cool,

3393
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:08,180
la.

3394
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:09,140
Like there's a,

3395
01:43:09,210 --> 01:43:13,390
there's a part of learning something new
and discovering something new that just

3396
01:43:13,391 --> 01:43:14,224
jazzes us

3397
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:15,240
and that,

3398
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:17,370
that's one of the things that
brought me to transhumanism,

3399
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:17,790
the,

3400
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:20,250
the desire to see the Milky Way.

3401
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:21,000
I mean,

3402
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,560
learning that we didn't live,

3403
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:26,970
we couldn't live long enough to explore
the galaxy was just to me as a kid was

3404
01:43:26,971 --> 01:43:28,020
just really,

3405
01:43:28,021 --> 01:43:28,231
yeah,

3406
01:43:28,231 --> 01:43:28,451
it was,

3407
01:43:28,451 --> 01:43:30,300
it was like,

3408
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:30,601
you know,

3409
01:43:30,601 --> 01:43:31,860
you're a super geek.

3410
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:35,200
I grew up watching like star wars and,

3411
01:43:35,201 --> 01:43:36,750
and you're watching doctor who,

3412
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,540
and then finding out
that were too fragile.

3413
01:43:39,541 --> 01:43:41,400
And we don't live long
enough to see anything.

3414
01:43:41,401 --> 01:43:43,020
It's like we can't,

3415
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:45,300
what we do is we say,

3416
01:43:45,330 --> 01:43:46,320
what's over that hill?

3417
01:43:46,321 --> 01:43:47,190
What's over that mountain?

3418
01:43:47,191 --> 01:43:48,024
Let's go.

3419
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:49,080
I know it's dangerous,

3420
01:43:49,081 --> 01:43:49,681
but hey,

3421
01:43:49,681 --> 01:43:50,730
there's nothing else to do.

3422
01:43:50,731 --> 01:43:51,564
Let's do it.

3423
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:53,690
And the fact that we,

3424
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:57,890
we can't cross space because we're
just too much radiation or theirs,

3425
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,420
you'll develop wrong or whatever.

3426
01:43:59,421 --> 01:43:59,991
That to me,

3427
01:43:59,991 --> 01:44:02,210
that was devastating and unacceptable.

3428
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:03,193
And I think that,

3429
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:04,160
that,

3430
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:04,993
that's just

3431
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:09,380
what other option is
there but to move forward.

3432
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:10,101
That's so funny,

3433
01:44:10,101 --> 01:44:11,270
that devastating.

3434
01:44:11,271 --> 01:44:12,104
Unacceptable.

3435
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:12,441
Do you,

3436
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:13,221
you heard about the,

3437
01:44:13,221 --> 01:44:13,520
um,

3438
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,580
there's a gentleman at the University
of Connecticut that's the foremost

3439
01:44:16,581 --> 01:44:17,414
scientists,

3440
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:17,890
uh,

3441
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:19,610
it working on time travel.

3442
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:21,170
Roy Mallet,

3443
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:23,300
I believe is Ray Mallet.

3444
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:23,750
I forget,

3445
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:24,583
I forget his name,

3446
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:29,540
but he's a professor and he started his
work on time trouble because his father

3447
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:33,320
died when he was a young man and he
wanted to go back in time to save his

3448
01:44:33,321 --> 01:44:34,010
father.

3449
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:34,671
So this guy,

3450
01:44:34,671 --> 01:44:36,800
he's like a goddamn
character in a comic book.

3451
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:41,690
He's like turn to a Spiderman book and
he's been working on time travel to go

3452
01:44:41,691 --> 01:44:43,880
back in time and save his father

3453
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:45,753
cool.

3454
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:46,160
Dead.

3455
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:46,920
But it's those,

3456
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,720
those things like where you were like,

3457
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:52,650
I can't imagine that I'm living in a
world where I won't get the fly in a

3458
01:44:52,651 --> 01:44:55,650
Battlestar Galactica ship
and fight the cylons.

3459
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:57,080
This is ridiculous.

3460
01:44:57,081 --> 01:45:02,060
I think that's what's beautiful about
transhumanism is that it has the impulse

3461
01:45:02,061 --> 01:45:03,650
within it is the same impulse.

3462
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,200
They got people to go onto ships,

3463
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:10,580
to sail towards a continent that
they'd kind of heard about it.

3464
01:45:10,581 --> 01:45:13,220
The re risking everything with no food,

3465
01:45:13,221 --> 01:45:14,180
probably going to die.

3466
01:45:14,181 --> 01:45:15,620
Maybe the earth just ends.

3467
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:18,860
I think there's something beautiful
about what you guys are doing,

3468
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:23,450
even though I do see it as a
kind of self destructive act.

3469
01:45:23,451 --> 01:45:25,460
I think when you put
magnets on your fingers,

3470
01:45:25,461 --> 01:45:25,970
you,

3471
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:27,440
you aren't thinking ahead,

3472
01:45:27,441 --> 01:45:30,290
you aren't thinking about what
you're going to be like in 30 years.

3473
01:45:30,291 --> 01:45:30,561
You know,

3474
01:45:30,561 --> 01:45:31,101
you don't know.

3475
01:45:31,101 --> 01:45:36,101
You could be the dude who used to have
a nose ring for like three days and I

3476
01:45:36,591 --> 01:45:39,040
didn't get a nose ring back
did and almost killed you.

3477
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:40,130
You self destructive,

3478
01:45:40,131 --> 01:45:43,760
best damn bull's they to give me the
nose ring was not the same impulse that

3479
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:46,220
drove explorers through the sea.

3480
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:49,230
It was just being dumb
and high in Venice beach.

3481
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,870
There's no glory to it.

3482
01:45:50,871 --> 01:45:52,550
What these guys are doing is glorious.

3483
01:45:52,551 --> 01:45:53,301
It's really cool.

3484
01:45:53,301 --> 01:45:54,710
It's just a kind of low.

3485
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:55,080
It's a bit,

3486
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:56,330
you have to start somewhere.

3487
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,380
You know,

3488
01:45:57,380 --> 01:45:57,830
you gotta,

3489
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:58,880
you gotta start somewhere.

3490
01:45:58,881 --> 01:46:00,430
You're starting with
magnets in your fingers.

3491
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:00,881
By the way,

3492
01:46:00,881 --> 01:46:01,990
if anybody's listening to this,

3493
01:46:01,991 --> 01:46:02,261
the,

3494
01:46:02,261 --> 01:46:02,411
uh,

3495
01:46:02,411 --> 01:46:02,671
the,

3496
01:46:02,671 --> 01:46:04,810
the scientist was Ronald Mallet,

3497
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:06,220
Ronald l mallet,

3498
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:07,300
m a l l e t.

3499
01:46:07,301 --> 01:46:08,111
T from the Ph.

3500
01:46:08,111 --> 01:46:09,940
He's a phd at the
University of Connecticut.

3501
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:12,490
Would you like to meet Dimitri Itzkoff,

3502
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:14,410
the man who founded the global future 20,

3503
01:46:14,411 --> 01:46:15,370
45 conference.

3504
01:46:15,371 --> 01:46:15,881
And if so,

3505
01:46:15,881 --> 01:46:16,421
what would you,

3506
01:46:16,421 --> 01:46:16,591
uh,

3507
01:46:16,591 --> 01:46:17,424
ask him

3508
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:18,940
you first please?

3509
01:46:21,010 --> 01:46:21,880
What would I ask him?

3510
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:27,260
I,

3511
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:28,160
I would ask him,

3512
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:28,950
uh,

3513
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:29,620
did you say to him,

3514
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,240
maybe it doesn't even have
to be a question and do it.

3515
01:46:31,241 --> 01:46:31,780
Would you,

3516
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:35,020
would you have anything specific that
you would want to talk to him about?

3517
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:38,300
I would actually ask him what his,

3518
01:46:38,330 --> 01:46:39,163
uh,

3519
01:46:41,070 --> 01:46:42,420
what his vision of the future is.

3520
01:46:42,450 --> 01:46:42,871
If it,

3521
01:46:42,871 --> 01:46:45,270
if it all pans out perfectly in his view,

3522
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:46,920
what would it look like?

3523
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:49,800
Cause I'm very interested in what his is.

3524
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:50,521
I'd love to,

3525
01:46:50,521 --> 01:46:51,600
I'd actually love to meet him.

3526
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:52,450
What about you?

3527
01:46:52,450 --> 01:46:53,283
Would you ask him?

3528
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:55,711
I'd like to meet him.

3529
01:46:55,711 --> 01:47:00,711
I'd like to know what he thinks
about where we're going as,

3530
01:47:02,011 --> 01:47:02,791
as a whole,

3531
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:06,240
as a group of people who are
experimenting with ourselves and,

3532
01:47:06,241 --> 01:47:07,470
and doing this stuff.

3533
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:10,470
And I would ask him for it,

3534
01:47:10,471 --> 01:47:12,270
the resources that we don't have.

3535
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:13,860
When you talk about how,

3536
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:15,053
um,

3537
01:47:15,150 --> 01:47:16,770
putting a magnet inside yourself,

3538
01:47:16,771 --> 01:47:18,480
you can't think about the long term.

3539
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:18,781
Well,

3540
01:47:18,781 --> 01:47:20,040
it's not that we haven't,

3541
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:23,910
it's that the people we talked to who
were professionals in these fields,

3542
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:29,240
they can't risk telling us the
answers because they have professional

3543
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:32,550
certification boards that would say,

3544
01:47:32,551 --> 01:47:32,791
hey,

3545
01:47:32,791 --> 01:47:34,110
you're behaving unethically.

3546
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:37,380
You're telling someone to do something
harmful to themselves and they don't know

3547
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:38,670
the risks that we're taking.

3548
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,170
We're yanking your license.

3549
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:43,860
And so we don't get answers
to questions that we need.

3550
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:48,150
And I think a guy like it's golf could
probably put us in touch with a lot of

3551
01:47:48,151 --> 01:47:52,260
people would have a lot of answers
for things I could really help us out.

3552
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:53,040
Awesome.

3553
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:53,650
Dude,

3554
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:54,311
thank you very much.

3555
01:47:54,311 --> 01:47:55,900
Really fun conversation.

3556
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:57,370
A really interesting stuff.

3557
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:59,020
Fantastic subject.

3558
01:47:59,021 --> 01:47:59,854
And uh,

3559
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:01,200
thanks for doing what you're doing.

3560
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:03,250
Thanks for sharing your
information as well.

3561
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:06,550
You guys have a great attitude
about all this technology too.

3562
01:48:06,551 --> 01:48:08,590
And even though I played
devil's advocate about it,

3563
01:48:08,591 --> 01:48:12,940
I really think that ultimately that
would be the best way and I'll fall.

3564
01:48:13,210 --> 01:48:14,230
We all had access,

3565
01:48:15,190 --> 01:48:16,030
but the problem is,

3566
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:16,660
you know,

3567
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:17,500
people are weak bitches

3568
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:21,340
grindhouse wetware lazy.

3569
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:23,003
Fantastic.

3570
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:24,370
Good night.
