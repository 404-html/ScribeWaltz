00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,050
What's your take on this?

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,850
Trump versus the intelligence community
jazz that seems to be going on right now

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,830
because I couldn't wait to get you in
here to get an insider's perspective on

5
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:17,170
this because I've never
seen anything like it.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,041
I mean,

7
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,810
I've never seen anything like what he was,

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,120
he was talking shit about flu shots today.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,210
He's like flu shots in
the biggest scam ever.

10
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:25,870
Like,

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,820
are you sure you've done research?

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,810
Are you a doctor?

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,570
Wow.

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:29,970
Well,

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,141
yeah,

16
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:30,801
I know that whole,

17
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:31,101
and he's,

18
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:32,680
and he's kind of a point
that not appointed,

19
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,900
but he's brought somebody in
as an advisor on that who is,

20
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,380
you know,

21
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,550
against vaccinations,

22
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:38,540
whatever that term is.

23
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,730
And not that the Intel thing.

24
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,243
Uh,

25
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,300
there's so many ways you can take this.

26
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:44,811
It was,

27
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:45,270
uh,

28
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,840
you know,

29
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,690
basically it was a self inflicted wound.

30
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,890
It was unnecessary.

31
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,360
There was no reason for him,

32
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,110
uh,

33
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,250
in the early stage of this,

34
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:53,660
when that narrative
started to build about,

35
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:53,781
oh,

36
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:56,360
there's this rift building between
Trump and the intel community.

37
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,950
It was because of his tweets,

38
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,370
right?

39
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,680
And it was because of him questioning the,

40
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,140
uh,

41
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,750
the intelligence about Russian
meddling in our election system.

42
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,350
And now to talk about
that just for a second,

43
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,310
of course,

44
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,370
the fucking Russians were meddling.

45
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,080
The Russians had been meddling in US
politics and campaigning over here in a

46
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:18,291
way,

47
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,870
since they've been around
as have the Chinese,

48
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,740
as have the Chinese,

49
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:22,640
you could go back to,

50
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:23,121
and people should,

51
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:28,121
this was a fascinating period of time
in history back to like 1941 go back to

52
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:31,970
when the Russians were still in an
alliance and a pact with the Nazis.

53
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,270
And so from the Russian perspective,

54
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,380
their goal,

55
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:36,730
their,

56
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,460
their point was to keep
the US out of the war.

57
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,720
And so what did they do?

58
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,320
There's an isolationist wing in the
States and Roosevelt was under a lot of

59
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:45,651
pressure.

60
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:46,700
Roosevelt was,

61
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,230
was becoming very close to Churchill.

62
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,700
They understood the threat.

63
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,350
He was one of the few
people that did at the time.

64
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:54,290
He understood how important it was
going to be for America to get into this

65
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,124
battle.

66
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,080
The UK was about ready to fall.

67
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,250
And so the British were actually running
their intelligence operations out of

68
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:04,520
New York and they had a place over
in Rockville Rockefeller Center.

69
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,420
And because they were worried they would
have island was going to be run over by

70
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:08,921
the Nazis.

71
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:13,100
So you have this going on in the dynamic
with the Russians was that they were

72
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:13,970
still in this pact,

73
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,420
you know,

74
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,320
with the Nazi.

75
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,520
Stalin didn't see this common.

76
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:20,870
He didn't see that on the Nazis were
running a very large propaganda campaign,

77
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:23,780
a diversion effort to ensure that the
Russians wouldn't know that they were

78
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,680
about to invade.

79
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,690
So the Russians spent a great deal of
time and money and resource here in the u

80
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:33,260
s influencing us public opinion
about staying out of the war.

81
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,280
There's no reason to be in the world.

82
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,930
Why would you want to get
into another war in Europe?

83
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,990
And they bought journalists and,

84
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,690
and uh,

85
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,100
placed,

86
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,320
uh,

87
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,370
newspaper articles.

88
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:41,270
They paid off journalists.

89
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,110
They were setting up associations
that were supposedly independent,

90
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,750
but we're run by the Soviets.

91
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,760
They were influencing unions,

92
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,230
dumping money into unions and bribing
basically day to get them to steer their

93
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:55,810
membership to isolationists,

94
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,270
you know,

95
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,511
uh,

96
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,344
agenda.

97
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,761
So to say that,

98
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:58,881
oh,

99
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,160
I know if the Russians were meddling,

100
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,150
of course they'd been doing it.

101
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:03,910
That's the w and then all
the way through the Cold War,

102
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,211
you know,

103
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:04,420
that's,

104
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,470
this is what they do.

105
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,513
So,

106
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,353
you know,

107
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,170
but it it the narrative because
it always has to be simplified.

108
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,240
I think as far as the media is concerned,

109
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,640
the narrative was that they
influenced the election.

110
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,290
We'll know they were meddling,

111
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,140
but they weren't hacking
into election systems.

112
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,710
They weren't hacking into the voting
booths and changing these things.

113
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,310
So,

114
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,230
so when you say metal and what they were
doing is essentially they were getting

115
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:32,550
information that was private that was
being distributed between the democratic

116
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,481
right convention.

117
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:33,690
Right.

118
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,040
They were definitely involved in,

119
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,840
in the DNC hacking for instance.

120
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,910
They were definitely involved in
thinking how were they involved?

121
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,481
Were they involved?

122
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:39,661
Were they,

123
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:44,661
did they directly did the hacking to
the Democrats or were they privy to the

124
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:47,820
information because someone sold
it to them or got it to them?

125
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,190
As with most of these things
that usually there's cutouts,

126
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,451
right?

127
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:50,781
So there's,

128
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:51,200
there's,

129
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,790
there's a pla plausible
deniability and so,

130
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,660
um,

131
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,430
but the Russians have been very,

132
00:03:58,431 --> 00:03:58,611
oh,

133
00:03:58,611 --> 00:03:59,180
I'm sorry.

134
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,660
No worries.

135
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,460
The Russians have been very,

136
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,030
um,

137
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,160
adept over the years at,

138
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,180
uh,

139
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,010
creating,

140
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,410
uh,

141
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:06,980
mayhem,

142
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,340
creating chaos around
democratic institutions.

143
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,570
Their whole goal is to chip
away at public trust in,

144
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:16,550
in a democracy and not
just here in the west,

145
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:17,060
but everywhere.

146
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,331
I mean,

147
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:17,571
you know,

148
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:20,000
and obviously that played out
in proxy wars out in Africa.

149
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,590
And so I,

150
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:22,010
again,

151
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,490
I guess what I'm trying to say is it
should have shocked no one that the

152
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:27,260
Russians would be engaged
in this sort of thing.

153
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,340
But,

154
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,090
um,

155
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:29,923
Trump,

156
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,330
again,

157
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,360
a self inflicted wound,

158
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,900
he hadn't gotten the full briefing shit.

159
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,600
He hadn't seen the
intelligence about this.

160
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,280
Uh,

161
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,310
and prior to that,

162
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:42,140
then he sending out a
handful of tweets saying,

163
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:42,470
I don't know.

164
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,190
I questioned it.

165
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,300
It didn't make any sense.

166
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,250
You have all the opportunity in the world
to question the intelligence and the

167
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:49,971
time to do that.

168
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:50,151
You know,

169
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:50,721
you're sitting there,

170
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:52,850
you're getting the briefings
from the heads of the agencies,

171
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:53,750
which happened.

172
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,810
And then if you notice
after that briefing,

173
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,790
his,

174
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,960
his tone changed completely.

175
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,480
And he came out and you know,

176
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,050
okay,

177
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,640
well the Russians were involved,

178
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,540
right?

179
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,260
Um,

180
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,760
and it didn't make it.

181
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,930
Now I had to walk that back.

182
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:11,210
So then he goes out to the
agency and he has a meeting,

183
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,410
which I think was a great thing.

184
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,330
I was really happy to
see that he did that.

185
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,450
And so soon in the
administration goes out to,

186
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,710
to our headquarters out
out there in Virginia.

187
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,053
Um,

188
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,800
and you know,

189
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:22,780
he got sidetracked,

190
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,560
but that's his personality.

191
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:27,080
He starts talking about
the inauguration numbers.

192
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,180
You start talking about the media,

193
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:29,511
you know,

194
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:30,530
the unfair media.

195
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,101
Well,

196
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:31,640
you know what,

197
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,620
you could just go out there.

198
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,180
Thank [inaudible] people say you're
looking forward to working with them to

199
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:36,710
protect national security interests.

200
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,880
Shake some hands and leave,

201
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,050
but it's not in his nature.

202
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:39,321
Right?

203
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,810
So he's going to get sidetracked and
he's got to talk about other things,

204
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:43,400
and then that becomes the story.

205
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,480
That's it.

206
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,201
That's I guess what I'm saying,

207
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,034
a balanced perspective.

208
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,320
How did it happen?

209
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,880
Because this is what was confusing to me.

210
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,370
How did the FBI in,

211
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,204
and now originally,

212
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,520
eventually the FBI came around
to the CIA's conclusions,

213
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,890
but there for a long time the
FBI was disagreeing with CIA

214
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,100
about whether or not the Russians had
anything to do with hacking the DNC.

215
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,241
Yeah,

216
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:02,600
the big,

217
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,390
I think the big disagreement
was really over motivation,

218
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,111
right?

219
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:06,490
I mean,

220
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,000
was that what it was a big part.

221
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,730
It was an evidence based thing that
they didn't see any evidence that the

222
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:11,564
Russians were involved,

223
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,970
which eventually became clear
and now there was a rest.

224
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,180
There was an arrest and unprecedented
arrest a couple of days ago.

225
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:17,420
Right?

226
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:17,840
Yeah.

227
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,051
Well,

228
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:18,560
I think,

229
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,180
but you're also talking
about two different groups.

230
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,940
So the bureau is the FBI
as a law enforcement.

231
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,860
So when they look at something,

232
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:26,630
they're looking at it from a
law enforcement perspective.

233
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:29,600
They're looking at gathering
sufficient evidence to prove a case.

234
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:29,991
Basically,

235
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,720
that's how they look at the agencies,

236
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,870
an Intel operation.

237
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,380
And so they're gab and
pieces of information.

238
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:35,601
You know,

239
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:37,160
it's not an evidentiary chain thing,

240
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,700
right?

241
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,481
So let's just get,

242
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:38,750
you know,

243
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,950
the preponderance of Intel.

244
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,320
Let's see where it leads as some
of it's going to be conflicting.

245
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,220
Some of it's not well,

246
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,090
well sourced,

247
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,920
but let's all see what it tells us.

248
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:46,430
You know,

249
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,800
and so part of it is how they approach,

250
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,610
um,

251
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,810
reaching a conclusion.

252
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,240
But you know,

253
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,420
they were both going to get to the same
place because he eventually there they

254
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:58,190
sit down and they compare notes.

255
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,030
Uh,

256
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,230
but part of it was the difference of
opinion over the motivation and motivation

257
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:04,064
is the toughest thing.

258
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,040
One of the toughest things
approved in this business.

259
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:07,874
And intelligence,

260
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:08,820
you know,

261
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,141
you can say,

262
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:09,351
okay,

263
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:09,951
they did this,

264
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:10,610
but you know,

265
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,590
unless you've got a sore
sitting in the tent,

266
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,251
who was there?

267
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,050
And part of the conversation
when somebody says,

268
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:15,560
well,

269
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:15,801
you know,

270
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:16,790
this is why are,

271
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:16,971
you know,

272
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:17,870
this is how we're going to do this.

273
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:22,240
And this is a reason it without
that sort of sourcing or intercepts,

274
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,680
uh,

275
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,060
it's,

276
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,560
it's tough to prove motivation.

277
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,100
So it took a while to kind of get
around to that notion and it's still,

278
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,113
to be honest,

279
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,960
you know,

280
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,270
it's still a little bit up near,

281
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,180
we're probably never going to get,

282
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:32,810
unless again,

283
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,210
we get our hands on a
really quality good source.

284
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,810
Uh,

285
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,430
that may still be a
little bit up in the air,

286
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,500
but the bottom line is Russian.

287
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,030
She had the Russians were engaged
in doing what they always do,

288
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,370
the covert action propaganda campaigns,

289
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,510
whatever it may be.

290
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,660
There's the 30,000 foot
view was always the same.

291
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,440
They want it,

292
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:48,771
they want to,

293
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,360
so a sense of,

294
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:50,931
of a,

295
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:51,980
of mistrust.

296
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:53,390
They want to create some chaos.

297
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:53,950
They want to,

298
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,140
you know,

299
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,730
kind of chip away at the belief that,

300
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:55,921
you know,

301
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:57,170
at democracy is a great thing.

302
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,123
And they did.

303
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,610
And look how much time was spent talking
about the integrity of the election

304
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,890
system and whether we actually
had a legitimate president or not.

305
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,910
That's a win.

306
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,130
So you've got a couple
of colonels in the FSB,

307
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,360
which was the old KGB,

308
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,200
uh,

309
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,930
who undoubtedly have been promoted
as a result of that operation.

310
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,930
And who got fo someone
got arrested from the FSB,

311
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,093
who was that guy?

312
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,461
Yeah,

313
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:17,120
I didn't get arrested.

314
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,410
I don't have those details in front of me.

315
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:18,641
I just,

316
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:20,330
just some token got a pissed off Putin.

317
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,930
Exactly.

318
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,490
Throw him in the fucking wall for awhile.

319
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,970
He just sent the wrong thing,

320
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:26,390
you know.

321
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,230
Uh,

322
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,670
but that's unprecedented.

323
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:28,881
Right.

324
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:31,680
Then they never have luckily
arrest there guys like,

325
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,500
um,

326
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,333
well they,

327
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,180
they have for certain things,

328
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,320
for corruption issues.

329
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,980
Um,

330
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,120
if they get sideways,

331
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:38,391
you know,

332
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:40,190
from a internal arguments,

333
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,461
you know,

334
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:40,850
then you'll,

335
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,290
you'll,

336
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:41,650
yeah,

337
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,390
it usually doesn't make the news because
nobody really gives a shit outside of

338
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:44,810
Russia.

339
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,220
And they do now because of this,

340
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,410
because of not because
people want to talk about it.

341
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,990
And what bothered me about this,

342
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:50,500
sorry to interrupt.

343
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:50,870
You're willing to,

344
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,230
what bothered me about this was the
narrative because the narrative was Russia

345
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,064
hacked the,

346
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,040
that's what everybody kept

347
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,780
saying and that's what
all these Democrats,

348
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,800
these left wing people were saying to
try to pump up this idea that Trump was

349
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:02,760
not a legitimate president.

350
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,230
Russia hacked the election.

351
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:05,130
Russia hacked the election.

352
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,230
Well know someone,

353
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,213
maybe Russia,

354
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,150
whoever it was,

355
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,220
put that information out that the
DNC had sent through private emails,

356
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,600
but the information was
what they sent you there.

357
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:16,951
I mean,

358
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:17,550
it wasn't,

359
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,930
they didn't hack anything.

360
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,200
Right.

361
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,020
They didn't get into
any election machines.

362
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,650
They didn't,

363
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,180
they didn't get into the voting machines.

364
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,410
They didn't do anything other than release
information that was supposed to be

365
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,620
private that indicated a
bunch of really shady shit.

366
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:31,980
Yeah,

367
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,550
exactly.

368
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,383
I mean all those,

369
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,440
all those Bernie Sanders,

370
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,720
how pissed off unless you be,

371
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:35,890
if,

372
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,180
if you're a Bernie Sanders supporter
and you're Bernie himself fucked over.

373
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:39,541
He got,

374
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:39,990
yeah.

375
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,040
Well he seemed to have made peace.

376
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:41,501
I guess he's,

377
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:43,650
he's a politician that even
though he says he's not,

378
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:44,484
I mean

379
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,940
it's just a weirdly principled one.

380
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,300
Yeah,

381
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,841
exactly.

382
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:49,770
I mean I hit a wide eyed,

383
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,420
Bernie would have been a better candidate.

384
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,610
I think Bernie would have been Joe Biden
would have been a better candidate.

385
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,460
I'll let you know.

386
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,810
You always like the person sitting on
the bench and then they get in the race

387
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:58,230
and they're not,

388
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,280
you know that's true too.

389
00:09:59,281 --> 00:09:59,580
Right?

390
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,620
They might have dug up some
shit about both of those guys,

391
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:05,310
but Bernie was an interesting guy and he
was not a whole lot of people that are

392
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,460
in his position for as long as he is
that have the kind of principles he has.

393
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:10,110
Like when he was able to say,

394
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:10,560
you know,

395
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,650
why don't you release the transcripts
of all these different speeches you gave

396
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:16,050
to all these banks that you got
paid a quarter million dollars.

397
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,621
And he goes,

398
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:19,230
I'll happily release mine
because I don't have any,

399
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,940
cause I wouldn't take a
penny from those people.

400
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,480
I was on a whole lot of people who could
say stuff like that in a big debate.

401
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,501
And you know,

402
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,370
they rallied,

403
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,170
they got together and they,

404
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,980
they decided to rig the
primaries and they've rigged it.

405
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,843
They really did.

406
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,440
That was what the Russians exposed.

407
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:34,800
But it,

408
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,850
Debbie Wasserman Schultz,

409
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,820
she was a real piece of work credible.

410
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,550
So I think there's,

411
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,331
and you're right,

412
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:41,010
and I guess what,

413
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,671
you know what obviously,

414
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:41,841
what,

415
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:42,550
what people on that,

416
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,680
uh,

417
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:42,951
on,

418
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:43,261
on the,

419
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,900
on the far left side are saying is,

420
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,351
well,

421
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:47,011
but without that,

422
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,990
if they hadn't released that information,

423
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:50,380
then it would have been
a different ballgame.

424
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,250
And you know that,

425
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,750
right.

426
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,700
Because we wouldn't know
how fucking corrupt she was.

427
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,060
Right.

428
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,871
But we wouldn't know the,

429
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,570
Debbie Wasserman Schultz had done what
she'd done and Debbie Wasserman Schultz

430
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:00,630
wouldn't have gotten fired from the
DNC and then immediately got hired by

431
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:01,500
Hillary's campaign.

432
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,800
Yeah.

433
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,071
I mean,

434
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:04,440
they picked her up in a
couple of minutes while she,

435
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:06,210
obviously they want to keep her happy.

436
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,190
You know how when somebody walking
out of that organization with,

437
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:10,990
with a chip on their shoulder talking.

438
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,620
So especially after what she did for you.

439
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:13,890
Yeah.

440
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,460
I mean,

441
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,020
they rigged the primaries.

442
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,890
They really did.

443
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,860
And people should be upset about
that way more than anything else.

444
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:21,450
It's id that Russia did something.

445
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,060
When you expose something that you should,

446
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,050
that we should have known,

447
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,000
we should have known about
it because it's a crime.

448
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,421
You know,

449
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,460
that kind of corruption
is essentially collusion.

450
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,323
It's a crime.

451
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,350
It's a conspiracy.

452
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,870
It's a real conspiracy to they're there,

453
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,920
they're interrupting democratic
process and that's what they're doing.

454
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,370
Right,

455
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:38,710
right.

456
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,790
Well then that was yeah.

457
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,790
Far More so then an outside force doing
what you expect them to do anyway.

458
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,710
Frankly,

459
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,890
the Russians did.

460
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:47,724
They always do.

461
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,730
So I think it would have been a great,

462
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,961
how interesting.

463
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,240
With those big conversations in,

464
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:54,630
uh,

465
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:54,930
in,

466
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,763
in the Kremlin,

467
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,650
um,

468
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,220
or at FSB headquarters where
they're talking about this.

469
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,580
Yeah.

470
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:00,911
And they're,

471
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:01,691
they're thinking about,

472
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:02,550
and they're planning it.

473
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,580
Someone had to write a note,

474
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:03,731
right?

475
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:04,600
Someone had to sit and say,

476
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,021
you know,

477
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:06,430
I got an idea for an operation.

478
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,361
And they had,

479
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:07,600
cause they,

480
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,890
you know,

481
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,670
it their bureaucracy like everything else.

482
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:13,210
And so they would have had to
sit and figure this out and then,

483
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:13,870
uh,

484
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,240
it would have made its way
to Putin cause you know,

485
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:19,510
this obviously the concern over the
blow back and the publicity of it all.

486
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,990
So Putin clearly knew what was going on.

487
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:23,711
Uh,

488
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,221
but again,

489
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:25,540
that's just the way it works.

490
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,090
Stalin new back in the day and
know exactly what they were doing,

491
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,750
trying to influence public opinion here
back during the early world war one or

492
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,021
two.

493
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,480
So yeah,

494
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:33,680
I,

495
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,040
there's no surprise to Chinese
do the same thing every,

496
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,730
you know,

497
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,280
every nation that's got the resources.

498
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:38,501
I mean,

499
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:38,710
hell,

500
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,861
we,

501
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:39,700
of course we do it too.

502
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:40,151
People always say,

503
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:40,331
well,

504
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:40,631
but wait,

505
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:40,871
do it.

506
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:41,021
Well,

507
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:41,291
yeah,

508
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,100
of course we do it,

509
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,430
you know,

510
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,330
I'm not saying we don't.

511
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,620
Yeah,

512
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,201
they all do it.

513
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:47,890
It's half of the weird competition that's
going on and you better hope we do it.

514
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:48,551
And in a sense,

515
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:49,480
I always say the San people say,

516
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,291
when I talk about,

517
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,124
uh,

518
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,600
you know,

519
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,433
um,

520
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,070
cyber hacking or whatever,

521
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:54,490
yeah.

522
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,121
People always go,

523
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:55,331
yeah,

524
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:55,451
well,

525
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:56,650
you don't have any right to talk a,

526
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,700
the u s does it as well.

527
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,480
I think it will.

528
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,230
Yeah.

529
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,090
That's actually a good thing,

530
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,000
given how aggressive and how nasty
the world is out there and how we're

531
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,650
constantly being hit and attacked,

532
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,580
um,

533
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,790
out in cyberspace.

534
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,530
I mean,

535
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:08,891
yeah,

536
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,270
we better hope we're good at it.

537
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,110
And,

538
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,560
you know,

539
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,170
if people knew how often,

540
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:16,180
how consistently and constantly,

541
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:16,931
uh,

542
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:21,931
our commercial and a public sector
infrastructure is probed and tested and

543
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,950
attacked on a daily basis,

544
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,970
people wouldn't sleep at night,

545
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,200
or they have to do is watch a showtime
series homeland to super accurate.

546
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:39,320
Yeah.
