1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,930
Hello Freak bitches.
Now,

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:05,540
when you started lifting weights when 
you were 12,

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,453
uh,
in 12th grade and you want more like a 

4
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:09,900
ninth or 10th?
Ninth to 10th grade.

5
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:10,734
Yeah.
Early to when you stopped taking the 

6
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:12,504
pills,
did you feel like the exercise did for 

7
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:17,880
you what the pills were kind of supposed
to do for you?

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,880
The weightlifting,
you know,

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,460
I had,
uh,

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,310
uh,
this,

11
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:22,144
this coach he's mentioned in that 
article that you were talking about the 

12
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,050
iron.
I talked to Mr Pepperman and he is,

13
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:28,820
he,
he,

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,840
I was in his car pool.
He was a Vietnam vet.

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,810
And uh,
he once said to me,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,730
I have to quote,
he said,

17
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,350
a,
you're a skinny little faggot.

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,080
Thank you sir.
And uh,

19
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,063
he said,
I'm going to teach you how to lift 

20
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:42,391
weights.
And I said,

21
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:44,190
okay,
it's more attention than my dad gave me.

22
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,023
So I said,
I'll take it.

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,570
And so he taught me compound lifts at 
the school gym.

24
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:51,030
So I bought a sears and Roebuck sand 
fill the weights set,

25
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:52,570
which I couldn't drag too,
my mom's station,

26
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,300
a VW fastback.
And eventually I did buy three months of

27
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,134
that weight.
So I'm fairly throwing it across the 

28
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:01,980
room cause you know you're growing so 
fast,

29
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,830
like your muscles are recovering 
overnight.

30
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,120
You just do the same workout every day.
You don't even feel it.

31
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,853
And he said you're not allowed to look 
at yourself until Christmas break after 

32
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,410
Christmas exams.
And this was like in September.

33
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,543
So I didn't,
I did everything he told me to and then 

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,960
he dropped me off before the Christmas 
break.

35
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:21,270
He said now today you can look at 
yourself in the mirror.

36
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,523
And I ran home,
like ran home and I tore my stupid 

37
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:29,520
school uniform off and I stood in the 
mirror and my body had definition.

38
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,383
I'm like,
wow,

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,313
those are packs of those.
I mean like I looked like I was a guy 

40
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:37,350
who lifted some weights and I've,
it was self validating like wow,

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,120
I'm here,
I did that.

42
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:41,550
I'm looking at myself going,
I did that.

43
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,593
No one can lift those weights for you.
And the feeling of achievement it gave 

44
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:46,524
me,
that I accomplished that was a shot in 

45
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:53,070
the arm that I still feel to this day.
Mile.

46
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,830
I mean cause it was so like wow,
you can do this.

47
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,460
That's possible.
Right.

48
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,180
Because every other time trying to meet 
girls at the school dance,

49
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:03,150
I had no guts to talk to the girls.
So they were alien creatures.

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,433
Um,
I didn't do well in school so you can 

51
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,504
make fun of me.
I couldn't throw the ball straight so 

52
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,930
they would throw it at my head to watch 
me run.

53
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,440
And so I didn't have any traction 
anywhere.

54
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,270
And then when I had the weights I'm 
like,

55
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:19,020
wow,
I'm filling out my tee shirt,

56
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:20,430
man.
Noticeable improvement.

57
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,264
Hell yeah man.
I lost effort equals results and I 

58
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:25,404
couldn't,
didn't make my grades better cause I 

59
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:27,411
still,
you know,

60
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:30,530
was all of Swahili to me as a school.
And was this let twos to,

61
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,310
it's probably too late.
I just,

62
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,350
yeah,
I'm just not good at sitting still.

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,940
But when I had the summer jobs,
that's when I kicked ass.

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,950
I never had an allowance.
I never,

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,510
when my mom said,
you never said,

66
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,560
here's 20 bucks.
I'm like,

67
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,870
where'd Henry Go?
He's got three jobs over the weekend.

68
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,490
I'd,
I'd wake up in the morning,

69
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,080
go to the pet shop,
work all day.

70
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,940
They're run home,
shower,

71
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:53,370
change my clothes,
do the night shift at the movie theater,

72
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,050
take the bus out to the surf shop in the
suburbs and,

73
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,890
and repair skateboards and whatever on 
Sundays.

74
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,450
So I always had pocket money because I 
always,

75
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,560
I liked having working a cash register 
on my key chain in school.

76
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,394
I had the keys to stores,
bosses trusted me cause I'd never steal 

77
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,070
and I,
so I would work like,

78
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,480
Oh,
like 20 hours a week and go to school in

79
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,314
high school.
And part of that was informed by the 

80
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,094
weightlifting.
And I like getting out of the house and 

81
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,870
being responsible.
But in school it didn't mean much to me,

82
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:30,100
but showing up on time at the pet shop 
and cleaning out 20 cat pans,

83
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:30,970
man,
that was like,

84
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,630
I had to be there at eight o'clock,
not eight oh one man,

85
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,480
because we got things to do.
I felt a real fealty.

86
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,930
And to this day,
like if I'm ever on a film shoot,

87
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,490
like who's the guy who's there early?
Man,

88
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:43,180
that's me.
I'm,

89
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,690
I'm there.

90
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,540
I memorize the whole damn script.
I'm so happy to have a job.

91
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,610
I'm like amazed.
Anyone cares.

92
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,410
And so all of that,
uh,

93
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,840
it keeps me on the straight and narrow.
I,

94
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,490
I call myself a human frozen yogurt 
machines is output.

95
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,500
No,
I don't want the applause.

96
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,090
I don't,
I like to build ships.

97
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:01,924
I don't want to say let them,
and the best part about finishing this 

98
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,970
ship is it sales off to see and you can 
build another.

99
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,810
So I love finishing a book.
You know,

100
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:12,040
I get this thing off my desktop now I 
can start a new one.

101
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,310
Like where can I go now?
And so that's how I,

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,480
I live to achieve and to output,
but it's not,

103
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,860
I don't ever look at,
I have a thing on my computer,

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,650
it's called the list.
And I keep a list of like every show,

105
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,660
uh,
every book I've written,

106
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,820
every movie I've been in,
every album I've ever made.

107
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,340
And when you look at it,
it's intense.

108
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,340
It's like you keep a list of every show 
you've ever done.

109
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,510
Oh hell yeah.
Of course.

110
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,450
Wow.
I don't know anybody who does that.

111
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,343
Yeah.
And sometimes I write down the set 

112
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:45,370
length.
I take a lot of notes.

113
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,330
Wow.
Yeah.

114
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,500
Write them all down.
But um,

115
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,960
I have this one thing called the list 
and it's just like,

116
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:50,681
you know,
every film,

117
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,330
every TV show,
every voiceover,

118
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,650
um,
every book,

119
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:55,780
every record on,
on and on.

120
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,840
And sometimes I look at it just going to
have to input.

121
00:04:58,841 --> 00:04:59,674
Like the new book comes out.
I have to go to the thing and input and 

122
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,310
I look at this list and my bone start 
aching.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,360
Like,
man,

124
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,790
this is a lot of,
there's a lot of shit,

125
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,770
a lot of crap.
This came.

126
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,643
Yeah.
And I don't wave it around and go see 

127
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:11,530
what I've done.

128
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,510
I just kind of go,
I'm only interested in what I'm doing,

129
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:15,730
what I'm doing next.
So why do you record it then?

130
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,564
Why do you write all that stuff down?
I like leaving a good trail of evidence 

131
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,920
and I like to be able to,
uh,

132
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,820
when someone will say,
I saw you in 1985 in champagne,

133
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:25,390
Illinois.
I'm like,

134
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,400
no,
that would be 1983 or 1986.

135
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,620
We didn't play there in 1985.
How do you know that?

136
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,270
Here?
It's right there.

137
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:32,104
See.
And they're like,

138
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,033
Whoa,
whoa.

139
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,590
Yeah.
You got to fucking list from 1983.

140
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,640
Oh I have every show since uh,
I was in Washington DC with my,

141
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,400
with my first band.
So you've,

142
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,180
you've written down every single show 
you've done in your life.

143
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,770
Yeah.
You should publish that.

144
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,843
Well it's in my journal books of the 
years I was in black flag that came out 

145
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:54,550
as a book.
I did a,

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,350
but I mean you should just publish that 
list.

147
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,010
You should put it up or something.
Just

148
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,350
some people could look at it.
Yeah.

149
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,540
I have a lot of,
there's a lot of those kind of things.

150
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,290
Right.
He's funny shit.

151
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,290
Just so people could feel lazy because 
just to look at that and go,

152
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,630
what in the fuck.
Cause sometimes you know,

153
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,800
something like that will change the way 
a person looks at the world.

154
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,580
To know that someone like Henry Rollins 
is out there recording every single show

155
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,620
and here's where are,
here's all.

156
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,930
Like you get this feeling like I'm 
getting this feeling when I'm talking to

157
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:23,060
you.
Like I want to go do something for real.

158
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,620
The get out of this.
No,

159
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,101
no,
no.

160
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,530
I love this interview.
I want to fucking accomplish something.

161
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,364
Like this is,
this is something that I like when I 

162
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:34,620
talked to people that are really 
motivated and really passionate it,

163
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,470
it gets me fired up and I was,
I'm,

164
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,500
I'm listening to you talk about this 
stuff and I want to go do something.

165
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,321
Yeah.
That,

166
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:43,220
that's all you get to do in life and you
get to do stuff and then you die.

167
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,550
You know,
it's over and it's over fast enough.

168
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:48,140
Anyway.
So for me,

169
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,480
I don't,
I don't tell people

170
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,060
this is a very compelling and attractive
a attitude you have though.

171
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,170
It's very,
very interest.

172
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,100
Yeah.
It keeps me going and it never gets,

173
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,660
I never get to that point where I've 
been to enough places where I've written

174
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:02,494
enough books or have done enough radio 
shows or I bought enough records is 

175
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:06,814
never enough records.
There's never enough time to do 

176
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:12,520
everything.
And I like living with that kind of,

177
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:13,354
um,
aspect of desperation who you're always 

178
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:17,021
kind of like,
oh,

179
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,100
come on man,
let's go.

180
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,830
Uh,
and I liked that because it keeps the,

181
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,723
as I say,
it keeps the blood thin and it keeps 

182
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:27,700
complacency at the door.
I have my bad days.

183
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:28,540
I'm like,
anyone else?

184
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,390
I'm just a,
you know,

185
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,060
burnt your bad days.
It probably ridiculous.

186
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,980
You're burning so hot.
I mean,

187
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:34,814
your bad days,
it probably like an average ambitious 

188
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:37,160
persons,
you know,

189
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:38,390
quality time.
I Dunno.

190
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,740
I mean,
I don't know man.

191
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:40,950
This is pretty intense,
but,

192
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:41,610
but

193
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,180
it's one of the reasons why I picked the
people I work with.

194
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:48,960
Like today you met Heidi who manages not
only me,

195
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,260
but all my companies and she's 
basically,

196
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,153
she's,
she and I had been working together for 

197
00:07:54,031 --> 00:07:55,860
Damn near 20 years.
She's amazing.

198
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,180
And she's air traffic control.
Cause if I'm not,

199
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:02,790
I'm never careful.
I say yes to every damn thing.

200
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,440
And she's like,
you can't say yes to that because you're

201
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:05,274
going to be over here on this day.
She goes like to stop answering the 

202
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,010
phone.
I got this.

203
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,993
So she like,
she's the one who coordinated all this 

204
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:11,890
with you.
Right.

205
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,601
Um,
because I,

206
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:13,940
you know,
not,

207
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,470
I'll just go and do it,
but I'm not good at setting it up.

208
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,633
And so she locks in the coordinates.
And so I work with people who are used 

209
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:26,760
to kind of my velocity,
like the road manager.

210
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,943
Uh,
in a way I'm very easy on road manager 

211
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:30,630
ward,
same.

212
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,463
I wake up,
I go to the front of the bus and he's 

213
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:35,490
already written out the map for me to 
walk to a gym.

214
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,433
So I wake up,
I go right to the gym and I always want 

215
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:39,480
the same thing.
I want to gym,

216
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,370
I want this,
I want to Gig.

217
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,620
And then I want some Sushi and I want to
go to sleep.

218
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,450
And so,
but it's,

219
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:47,610
it's intense and there's hardly any days
off.

220
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:52,611
So he knows how to keep all of that 
going and the phone is ringing because I

221
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,624
work in different media all time.
And so Heidi is always juggling 

222
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,053
chainsaws.
And so I'm around people who can allow 

223
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:06,321
me just to really run at it and go as 
fast and as hard as I want to.

224
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,290
I call it living at the speed of life.
He just kind of go,

225
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,860
you let your imagination and your 
resolve dictate everything.

226
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,130
And to be able to do that and still keep
the lights on,

227
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,840
I'm just a lucky bastard.

228
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,390
[inaudible].
