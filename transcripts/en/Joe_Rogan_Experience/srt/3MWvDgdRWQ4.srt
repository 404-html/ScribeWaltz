1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,770
[inaudible] four,
three,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,510
two,
one.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,030
Jeffrey.
Hey.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,710
Hey.
Thanks for being here man.

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,990
I appreciate it.
It's my pleasure and honor and uh,

6
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:14,880
on the day were bill cosby goes to the 
pokey,

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,710
crazy,
sad story that a sad for some people,

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,100
happy for others.
Sad that he's only going away for,

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,610
I wonder if that's a death sentence for 
a man at his age.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,380
Essentially it is,
right?

11
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,214
He's like 81 or something like that.
It'd be weird if justice took into 

12
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:33,990
account like your health status and 
awarding.

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,240
Right.
I think they have done that though.

14
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:37,074
Didn't they do that with that guy who 
was speaker Hassard who was speaker of 

15
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:47,661
the house who was convicted for 
molesting a large number of boys when he

16
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,820
was a wrestling coach.
Oh yeah.

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,810
Do you remember that man?
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,160
Yeah.
15 months.

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,510
15 months.
Imagine they might,

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,030
I mean that's,
that's pure insanity in a wheelchair and

21
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,360
he was cool.

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
Yeah.
It could have been.

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,340
Well,
there's,

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,173
there's no way.
If he was a 25 year old able bodied man 

25
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:09,120
who had done the exact same thing,
he would have gone to jail for 15 months

26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:14,690
for a admitting to Molesta a large 
number of kids who are under his care.

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,580
When he was,
he was a wrestling coach,

28
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:19,310
right?
Yeah.

29
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,670
Yeah.
Oh,

30
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:23,140
here's the guy in the movie was made of,
no,

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,170
no.
A different guy now is that,

32
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,450
that was dupont.
Dupont was not a child molester.

33
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:29,840
He was just a psychopath who,
uh,

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,200
hired a wrestlers to come live with him 
and wrestle with them.

35
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,400
Yeah,
I remember that.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,860
I know one of them,
the,

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,000
one of the main guy in the movie,
they,

39
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,834
they,
uh,

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,010
the,
the,

41
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,080
the two brothers,
Dave and Mark Schultz,

42
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,630
fantastic.
Uh,

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,590
wrestlers who were completely 
misrepresented in the movie.

44
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:53,424
They made him out to be like,
involved this weird gay relationship 

45
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:56,604
with him and doing cocaine and all,
they added all sorts of shit to that 

46
00:01:58,981 --> 00:01:59,814
movie.

47
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,260
Very weird.
How they do that.

48
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:02,850
Screenwriters,
you've got to dramatize it.

49
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,660
I guess it's sentence wasn't for child 
abuse.

50
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,820
Why?
That's why it was that.

51
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,510
It says that says the judge said it 
would have been higher,

52
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:15,840
he would have gotten more if the 
statutes didn't run out.

53
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:19,020
The limitation for accident in 1960s and
seventies ran out to the judge,

54
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:22,380
noted the punishment for such a 
conviction would have been far worse.

55
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,880
I think he actually got convicted for 
big transactions keeping stuff secret.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,870
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

57
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,020
I had to pay fines.
Statutes of limitations.

58
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,700
Yeah.
So we were talking about bill cosby that

59
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,534
a psychology professors and experts were
obviously stating that he had some sort 

60
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,600
of problem.
I mean,

61
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,790
it's weird because the media will,
um,

62
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,270
have a certain narrative they want to 
promote and they'll sort of find,

63
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,460
the psychologist will say the thing that
fits that.

64
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,433
Yeah.
So I think most clinical psychologists 

65
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,500
would say,
I've never talked to the guy,

66
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm not going entire to diagnose him

67
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
from a distance.
I have no idea what his condition is or 

68
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:04,264
what his issue is.
But then there's the handful who are 

69
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,800
willing to kind of stick their necks out
and say something.

70
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,563
And Man,
it's embarrassing to be a psych 

71
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,420
professor for that reason because 
you're,

72
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,343
you're always kind of being represented 
publicly by the people who are kind of 

73
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:21,130
being least professional about those 
kinds of diagnoses.

74
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,070
That is a real problem today,
isn't it?

75
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,600
Like in,
in terms of,

76
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,120
uh,
identity politics and this,

77
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:28,954
this inclination to draw conclusions and
to lean towards one side or the other 

78
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:37,060
instead of just looking at the actual 
situation objectively.

79
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,980
And if you're not talking to him,
I mean,

80
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,940
I'm assuming bill cosby's a terrible 
piece of shit as a human being.

81
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,070
That's what I'm assuming.
But you're looking at all this,

82
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:45,904
but I've never talked to the man.
I don't know what kind of crazy shit 

83
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,324
he's got going on in his head.
But if all these women are telling the 

84
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:54,790
truth and seems super unlikely that 
they're all lying.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,950
Yeah,
I mean wizard and it like zero for 50 of

86
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:57,610
them,
right.

87
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,930
With the same story.
Yeah.

88
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,560
He's got a deep dark streak,
that's for sure.

89
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,180
Um,
I mean,

90
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,014
the weird thing is,
so a lot of people who are successful 

91
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,264
have a little bit of that dark streak 
that have a little bit of that 

92
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:10,844
sociopathy.
Like they can kind of step back from 

93
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:17,540
normal human relations and they can 
either turn it into,

94
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,150
you know,
abuse and exploitation like cosby did or

95
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:23,120
they can kind of civilized themselves,
right?

96
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:28,120
And they can harness that to do 
something that's good and,

97
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:31,100
and where they're kind of using their 
ability to take a different viewpoint on

98
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:33,280
things to,
um,

99
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,260
analyze human behavior or invent things 
or,

100
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,380
or,
you know,

101
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,430
propose new policies or whatever.
And um,

102
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,830
so I think that kind of dark streak,
you know,

103
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:49,664
if you have it,
you have to recognize it and kind of 

104
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,940
tame it and work with it.
And the people who do,

105
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:56,774
I think can often do great things for 
society and the people who don't end up 

106
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:00,974
in jail.

107
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,333
Well,
this is one of the reasons why I wanted 

108
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:06,360
to bring this up to you as an 
evolutionary psych professor,

109
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,343
looking at the human mind in looking at 
behavior patterns and what's clearly 

110
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,743
some sort of,
I I hesitate to call crime and 

111
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:17,334
addiction,
but it seems like an addictive pattern 

112
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:20,754
that he has,
that there's a compulsion to doing this 

113
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:24,534
to people,
that it's not as simple as he wants 

114
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:29,790
women to have sex with them.
They don't want to have sex with them.

115
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,040
So he drugs them.
I don't think it's that simple.

116
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,650
I think there's some getting away with 
it thing.

117
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,723
There's gotta be some,
he's better than everyone thing because 

118
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,000
he's,
you know,

119
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,770
he's royalty in the t in terms of like 
Hollywood,

120
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,230
in terms of show business,
in terms of standup comedy,

121
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,900
he's always been treated as royalty.
I mean,

122
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:52,410
he's been allowed to essentially 
criticize anyone who wants.

123
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,430
He's rarely is there a rebuttal to the,
the things that he and

124
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,083
you know,
he's been criticizing the black 

125
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,734
community for its use of bad words and 
for its use of sexually explicit 

126
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,400
language and,
and depictions.

127
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,280
And meanwhile the entire time he's 
raping people.

128
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,290
I mean it's fucking

129
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,333
amazing.
I think one thing that might happen is 

130
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:15,664
if you've got this public image as being
like squeaky clean family values and 

131
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,360
you've got the burden of kind of being a
moral exemplar like that,

132
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,280
you know,
just like um,

133
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,473
televangelists right?
Or anybody who has a big religious 

134
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:29,284
following,
like the pressure to be good all the 

135
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:33,280
time I think can kind of tip people into
this.

136
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,300
The thrill of transgression I imagine 
could be quite,

137
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,740
quite kind of addictive and I think 
that's a real danger.

138
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:42,574
And I think that's that kind of 
hypocrisy is why we should be really 

139
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:47,194
careful about kind of idolizing anybody 
to that degree kind of morally and 

140
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:52,660
putting that burden on them.

141
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,423
Yeah,
I mean,

142
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,480
I could only imagine like being an 
evangelist,

143
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,020
being someone who,
who preached about the word of God,

144
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,570
but meanwhile having this weird hooker 
thing like,

145
00:07:04,571 --> 00:07:07,090
uh,
do you remember what was his name?

146
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,953
Ted?
He ran a giant church and I believe it 

147
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:16,120
was Colorado.
And the entire time.

148
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,983
I used to have a bit about them the 
entire time we smoke in math and having 

149
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:23,620
sex with gay prostitutes and all the 
while he's going on about,

150
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:26,800
it's always the guys who go on about how
awful gay people are.

151
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,170
They're secretly gay.
It's so common.

152
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,280
There's a little research on that.
I mean it's not definitive,

153
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:37,890
but it looks like a lot of Ted haggerty 
like film haggard,

154
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,010
cause a lot of people,

155
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,843
well a lot of guys who are pretty like 
outspokenly homophobic and like you put 

156
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:48,350
them in a sex research situation and see
what actually rouses them.

157
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,190
You show them straight or gay porn.
Right?

158
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:52,780
And you'll have a plethysmograph and 
you,

159
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,663
you sensed it.

160
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,960
What's the graph?
What does it is my graph?

161
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,910
What does that sense is blood flow in 
the penis?

162
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,650
Oh boy.
I need one of those.

163
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,163
I need one of those.
Just have it in the background of every 

164
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:04,740
podcast.
But when you come and do the podcast,

165
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:05,574
you had to put these electrodes on your 
penis and then we were just going to 

166
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:11,290
talk about Japanese vomit porn and 
tentacles.

167
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,940
Well,
the playthrough graphs don't lie because

168
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,910
I'm still not the heart.
The heart lies.

169
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,540
Not those put his,
my graphs.

170
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,150
So yeah,
the,

171
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,840
the people who are often,
you know,

172
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:27,330
most hostile to something,
you have some,

173
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,110
some little issue inside that is 
creating some conflict.

174
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,940
Yeah,
I mean normally makes sense.

175
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,640
They,
they,

176
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,640
the conflicted dots of the human being 
who has this ideal of who they'd like to

177
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:40,800
project and what they'd like people to 
think they are.

178
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,063
Meanwhile has this thing below the 
surface that is literally everything 

179
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:47,580
they despise and everything they rally 
against.

180
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:49,320
And that is their,
their true nature.

181
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,250
Yeah.
God,

182
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,160
it's gotta be the office feeling.
I mean,

183
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,430
I've known several who were closeted

184
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,750
gay men and it's,
it's an awful existence.

185
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,890
They just live in this perpetual state 
of just adjuncts and unease.

186
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,950
And meanwhile,
God,

187
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:12,090
if this,
think for the most part,

188
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,953
especially if you live in an urban 
environment and most part people don't 

189
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:18,750
give a shit anymore,
there's a almost a self imposed prison.

190
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,240
And the people that do give a shit,
they're the real problem.

191
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:21,881
You know,
the,

192
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:23,490
the,
the people who are not gay,

193
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:24,324
who really care if someone's gay,
unless they're trying to do a cause 

194
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,770
behind you.
Like why do you care?

195
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,630
Yeah.
Look,

196
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,870
if somebody wants to be in the closet 
about their sexuality,

197
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:35,704
like they want to be discreet for 
professional reasons or because 

198
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,620
investors would panic or whatever,
like that's totally cool.

199
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,483
But I think,
and it's so hard to be authentic to 

200
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:45,964
yourself.
Like it's okay to sort of acknowledge I 

201
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:51,950
have this sexuality or these 
predilections and,

202
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,630
and it's up to me to kind of harness 
them and deal with them and manage them.

203
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,330
And if you want to do that privately,
that's,

204
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,160
that's cool.
We should have that freedom.

205
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,263
Yes.
But if you don't work out those little 

206
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,580
demons and if you can't acknowledge 
what's authentic,

207
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,800
I think that's where you get these 
problems.

208
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:09,640
Like the cosby case.

209
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,653
Yeah.
And I believe there's a difference 

210
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,034
between discretion,
not wanting to discuss your sexuality 

211
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,540
and out and out hypocrisy there.
These are completely different thing.

212
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,950
It's one thing,
like you said,

213
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:24,160
like say if a guy's a ceo of some major 
corporation and he happens to be gay and

214
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:24,994
he's just not interested in all the 
political nonsense and all the social 

215
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:29,140
nonsense it goes along with discussing 
that.

216
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:29,921
Yeah.
He's like,

217
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,050
I'm just going to keep it discreet.
That makes sense.

218
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,470
Like why should he have to,
but if he lies to his friends,

219
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,903
you know,
like,

220
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,850
or if he goes on the attack and media 
ass that is,

221
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,790
yes.
That is damnation in hell fire.

222
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,120
We are so strange.
Um,

223
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,163
as,
as a race and I have talked many times 

224
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:51,874
about how bizarre it is that we've 
become really comfortable with seeing 

225
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,640
people have sex like on phones and you 
know,

226
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,563
I pads and laptops.
I mean it is such a massive part of 

227
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:06,250
Internet consumption.
Yeah.

228
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,293
But yet so dirty and so forbidden.
If someone comes in the room and you're 

229
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,210
watching,
you slam the laptop shut in disgust,

230
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,640
total embarrassment.
It's really weird.

231
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,470
Yeah.
Well it's weird on so many levels.

232
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:25,710
Like I don't do research on whatever,
the psychology of porn,

233
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:26,544
but I know people who do.
And the fact that you can study it and 

234
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:31,554
everyone watches it,
but you can't even show clips at a 

235
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,540
scientific conference.
Wow.

236
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,810
Of what people are watching is kind of 
bizarre.

237
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,150
A second thing that's bizarre is if 
you'd asked people seven years ago,

238
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,180
you know,
in the 50s or whatever,

239
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:49,014
what do you think will happen if there's
unlimited free online pornography that 

240
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:53,394
has every possible genre of humans,
of all sexes interacting with each 

241
00:11:58,811 --> 00:11:59,644
other,
including cartoon dragons and whatever 

242
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,780
they would go,
civilization will have fallen.

243
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,890
Like it would be chaos.
It that sounds post-apocalyptic.

244
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,753
And,
and yet we're living in that era and 

245
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,673
people are still driving their kids to 
school and seeing like morally 

246
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:22,471
judgmental about politics and our 
ability to carp compartmentalize is kind

247
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:27,070
of all inspiring actually.

248
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,690
Yeah,
it really is.

249
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,383
Um,
but it's also our ability to adjust to 

250
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,084
the times.
It's kind of awe inspiring to you think 

251
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,070
about the different,
like I've often talked about,

252
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,933
uh,
when I was in high school is I was in 

253
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:45,940
high school in 1981 my freshman year of 
high school.

254
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,013
And that was literally around the time 
that vh one tape was introduced into 

255
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:52,630
modern America.
Is that what was the,

256
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:55,150
what was the exact year vh one?
Tapes were invented.

257
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:55,984
We got them in my house,
I think in an 82 like maybe I was a 

258
00:12:58,991 --> 00:12:59,824
sophomore,
which is right when you're about the 

259
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:03,200
horniest and uh,
that's,

260
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,980
that's when porn made it into people's 
houses.

261
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:08,950
And you had to go through those beads in
the video store.

262
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,100
Do you get to the porn section?
And everybody was like everybody but had

263
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:15,530
blinders on and nobody looked at anybody
else and it was just terrifying.

264
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,363
And you know,
you saw your name are there in the late 

265
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:19,240
fees?
Like should I bring it back today?

266
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:20,140
Oh man,
if he paid,

267
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:21,790
I'll just keep it,
keep it bucks.

268
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,240
Three bucks.
If he just stole it costs 30 steel.

269
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,170
It just,
so you don't have to look,

270
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:31,171
look the guy in the face and in the 70s,
seventies really,

271
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,550
and her home use in the 70s on the Wiki 
it says,

272
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,410
yeah,
seventies and early eighties.

273
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,433
Okay,
well maybe it was late seventies or 

274
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:39,010
something like that.
My house,

275
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:42,370
we got it around 1980 I want to say 82 
ish,

276
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,650
but it changed the world and it changed 
it in a real sneaky way where nobody saw

277
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:49,990
it coming.
But the difference between the access to

278
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:54,991
sex to the looking at sex from 1960 to 
1980 20 years,

279
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,551
which is,
you know,

280
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:58,384
in terms of historically is a very short
period of time at any other time other 

281
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,780
than today.
Today it's a massive change.

282
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,643
Or if,
if you had to anticipate what it would 

283
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:08,830
be like in 2038,
he'd be like,

284
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,890
Oh God,
you know,

285
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,030
all of you on mucks inventions have come
to fruition.

286
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:13,864
We'll be living in tunnels underground 
and the surface of the earth would be 

287
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:19,630
190 degrees and there'll be no more 
water.

288
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:20,464
And

289
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,600
yeah,
people always overestimate how much it's

290
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:26,100
going to change in the next 20 years 
compared to the last 20.

291
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,023
Yeah.
Um,

292
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,180
but you know,
if you'd asked a bunch of,

293
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,913
let's say psychology researchers who 
study like marriages and longterm 

294
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,563
relationships,
ask them in 1980 what's going to happen 

295
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,193
when you have unlimited vhs porn?
Some of them might've said that'll save 

296
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,810
American marriages.

297
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,290
How many do you think would go with 
that?

298
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,993
All the hippies.

299
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,593
I think a lot of folks would have,
well that's the way you can get your 

300
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:55,880
sexual variety needs mat and a kind of 
virtual fake way.

301
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,073
And so that'll reduce the pressure for 
like infidelities and other folks would 

302
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:01,670
have said,
oh my God,

303
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:03,410
it will remind people what they're 
missing.

304
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,630
And so it'll,
it'll nuke marriages.

305
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:07,220
The divorce rate will go to 80%

306
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,590
but then there's the third option,
which is the sort of the cosby ask thing

307
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,290
is that the addiction that there's,
there's,

308
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,250
and maybe I can ask you about this,
like what is it about things,

309
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:22,450
whether it is gambling or you know,
whatever video games,

310
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,463
there are things that people get 
obsessed with and those things become 

311
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:31,930
almost a part of who they are.
It takes over their minds so much.

312
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,860
Like if you had a pie chart of the human
brain with some folks,

313
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,440
there's a giant chunk.
This just porn.

314
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,250
It's like 40% of the brain's porn.
Yeah.

315
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,840
Like what happens?
What is,

316
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:47,200
what is it about the mind that makes one
obsessed,

317
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:50,050
whether it's with gambling or whatever,
whatever,

318
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,170
the vice,
whatever the,

319
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,050
the thing that makes you

320
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,140
dick did.
Well,

321
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,920
I mean,
one,

322
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,490
one issue is people differ in their,
their conscientiousness,

323
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,383
right?
Their degree of self control and their 

324
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:06,370
ability to kind of resist temptations 
and keep their eyes on the target.

325
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:08,170
Like career,
family,

326
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:09,220
kids,
you know,

327
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,410
do the right stuff.
Um,

328
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,440
other people like I just can't control 
myself in any domain of life,

329
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,790
whatever it is,
video games,

330
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,110
porn,
um,

331
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,820
doing my homework,
whatever.

332
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,703
But I think we also have to cut people 
some slack because remember now if 

333
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:29,260
you're a teenager and you're really into
video games,

334
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,450
call of duty,
whatever it is,

335
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,133
there are literally thousands of people 
designing that game to be as addictive 

336
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:40,810
as possible and Beta testing it and 
refining it and,

337
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,540
and you know,
doing the level design.

338
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,930
So it gives you just the right 
reinforcers at the right pace.

339
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,770
And of course we're not going to be very
good at resisting that because the power

340
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:58,471
of capitalism and tech and innovation to
kind of exploit our brains is,

341
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,950
is pretty awesome.

342
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,640
Am I being naive or are they just trying
to be entertaining?

343
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,913
I mean,
I'm just trying to make an amazing game 

344
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:11,140
that's totally immersive and sucks you 
in.

345
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,030
Or are they really thinking,
Hey,

346
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:13,864
this Jeffrey Miller guy,
I want to get him fucked up on 

347
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:18,610
battlefield earth now.
That was the John Travolta movie,

348
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,550
right?
That that did not succeed.

349
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,350
Okay,
let's just say unreal tournament.

350
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,483
I want to get him fucked up on unreal 
tournament and get him completely 

351
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:30,490
addicted to this.
They're just maximizing sales and profit

352
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:33,400
and what are they doing it consciously 
or are they just trying to make the best

353
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:36,910
possible game that's so entertaining and
then it just as a side effect,

354
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,440
it becomes a addictive,
I think it's s

355
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,610
well,
okay.

356
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:44,444
If you're running a video game company 
that the folks actually doing the 

357
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,710
programming,
right?

358
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,180
Character design level design and 
whatever,

359
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,003
they want it to be awesome.
They want it to just pick the best game 

360
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,570
ever.
That is just so fun to play,

361
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:01,110
but the management knows we have to sell
it.

362
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,550
We have to make it compelling,
we have to make people excited about the

363
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,980
next version and,
and you know,

364
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:08,814
the add ons.
So I think there's kind of like a super 

365
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,330
ego and ed issue going on even within 
companies,

366
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,193
whether the designers just want it to be
cool and management just once a viable 

367
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,610
commercial product.
But

368
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,060
doesn't that just come with something?
That's cool.

369
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,501
I mean,
I'm,

370
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:32,750
I'm just playing devil's advocate here 
because I'm not exactly sure how.

371
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,840
I'm friends with a few guys who make 
video games.

372
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,220
Uh,
Cliffy B who,

373
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:38,810
uh,
worked for epic games,

374
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:41,710
who makes a,
he showed us unreal way back in the day,

375
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,583
even before Jamie worked here.
We get to see them making unreal 

376
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:47,540
tournament,
like as it was be made.

377
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,320
And,
uh,

378
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,280
I went to the aid offices when they were
working on quake three,

379
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,430
which are just these amazing games.
And it seemed to me,

380
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,840
and again,
I could be naive,

381
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:59,420
but it seemed to me that all they were 
doing it was just trying to make awesome

382
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:00,890
shit that they like.
Yeah.

383
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,200
And then it became addictive just cause 
it was so good.

384
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,450
I think that's most of that.
Um,

385
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,860
yeah,
I mean this summer,

386
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:09,690
like my girlfriend and I were each 
doing,

387
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,100
working on our next book proposals and 
we each got a little bit addicted to age

388
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:16,980
of empires hd,
which is like back in the day,

389
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:20,370
20 years ago.
And it's really fun because we learned a

390
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,530
lot about each other,
just watching each other play.

391
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,250
Like we had such different strategies 
and in terms of like what you build,

392
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:30,630
what you prioritize,
how you deal with enemies.

393
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:33,200
Like it,
it's an amazing kind of personality test

394
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,200
[inaudible] its own right.
Um,

395
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,980
and we each got a little bit addicted 
temporarily and in our own way.

396
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
And I don't think that's an intention of
the designers.

397
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:49,560
It's just if you make anything awesome,
whether it's music,

398
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,980
whether it's standup comedy or sex,
whether it's sex,

399
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:56,080
whether it's long form TV drama,
um,

400
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,780
like Ozark,
then people want that.

401
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,490
You know,
it works.

402
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,230
It's,
it's brain candy.

403
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,640
Yeah.
I saw you quote you,

404
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:09,380
you posted about Ozark after I posted 
about how amazing it is.

405
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:11,750
I'm completely wrapped up in this second
season.

406
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,970
So incredible.
But you were saying how they always make

407
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:15,680
the kids bratty.
Yeah.

408
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,540
You don't have kids Dhea.
I'll have a daughter.

409
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,860
You do 22.
Oh,

410
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:21,080
okay.
I didn't think she was bratty at all.

411
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:21,914
I think she kept it remarkably together 
for a teenager who's parents are 

412
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:28,490
murderers and drug dealers spoil alert.
I thought it was,

413
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,533
I think she's Jimmy and she needs some 
time alone where they need to talk to 

414
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:32,991
her.
I mean,

415
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:35,690
you can't just let her go through life 
hanging out with some kid who lives in a

416
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:38,240
trailer smoking weed and steel and 
books.

417
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,040
You got it.
I kind of warmed up to it after,

418
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:41,874
like I'd watch the first couple of 
episodes and she seemed kind of Bratty 

419
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,320
the daughter.
And really and that,

420
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:48,370
and then,
and then be amazing.

421
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,280
My kids.
Awesome.

422
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,123
And,
and I don't know why all kids aren't 

423
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,310
like her,
so,

424
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,480
um,
but I think screenwriters get lazy about

425
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:00,040
this stuff.
They think,

426
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,593
well,
if there's a family you need marital 

427
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:03,904
conflict and you need parent offspring 
conflict and you need secrets and lies 

428
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,040
and,
and,

429
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,053
but I think the way they're handling it 
is amazing because the kid doesn't have 

430
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,260
that kind of conflict.
The kid has,

431
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,000
like,
in my opinion,

432
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,853
uh,
a typical sort of a relationship with 

433
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:23,980
his father where he admires his father 
and his father's abilities and,

434
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,360
you know,
and he seems to be,

435
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,760
it's,
I just think that shows fucking great.

436
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:30,490
It's just so well read a written rather.
It just,

437
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:33,910
so it's so twisted and there's so much 
going on.

438
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,030
So many different levels.
It's like I get anxiety,

439
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,630
I start sweating and I feel like I'm 
buried body.

440
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,070
Well,
I love that you don't really know what's

441
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:46,070
going to happen and legitimate.
Like it's,

442
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,320
you know,
game of thrones,

443
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:51,980
you had that thing where any character 
could die at any time.

444
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:52,843
Yeah.
And that's what that was one of the 

445
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:58,130
major things that people watching.
Um,

446
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,473
and I think with really good TV drama,
you get that kind of engagement where 

447
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,000
it's,
it's like real life.

448
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,871
Like,
you know,

449
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:08,780
the series will continue but you don't 
know any particular character.

450
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:09,614
Well,
but

451
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,800
we didn't have that for most of culture.
That's what's really interesting.

452
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:14,963
It was through most of mass media 
fiction that you saw on television in 

453
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:22,260
the movies,
the good guy one.

454
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,311
Yeah.
You know,

455
00:22:23,311 --> 00:22:27,240
and it was real predictable and there 
was always like a little bit of drama.

456
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:29,370
Like he might lose,
he might lose.

457
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,500
Oh,
he wins occasionally.

458
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:32,334
You had something crazy like Thelma and 
louise driving off the cliff and you're 

459
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,960
like,
whoa,

460
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,200
whoa,
whoa.

461
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:39,150
There's off themselves.
That's the end of the movie.

462
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,410
And he would leave the movie theater 
like,

463
00:22:40,411 --> 00:22:41,520
Holy Shit,

464
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,500
what a gangster move.
You know,

465
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,810
there was a few movies like that,
but for the most part,

466
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,913
yeah.
Well starting in like the golden age of 

467
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,610
cinema in the 70s the counterculture 
cinema,

468
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:55,480
you sometimes got those really profound 
surprise endings.

469
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,620
But one thing that made an example,
the hustler vanishing point.

470
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,881
Oh,
okay.

471
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,880
That was the one with the challenger.
The guy had the challenger.

472
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,420
Yeah.
It's like I forgot to suicide by storm.

473
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,170
I remember the car.
Awesome car.

474
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,410
But I mean,
one thing that makes me optimistic about

475
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:12,244
America is that the same adults who are 
being completely insane to each other 

476
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:18,334
about politics on twitter,
whatever are watching this really 

477
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:24,880
sophisticated,
you know,

478
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:28,600
emotionally insightful netflix stuff.
Yeah.

479
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,530
And I can't connect those,
those two things.

480
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:37,210
It's like when people aren't talking 
about certain issues to capable of,

481
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,140
you know,
really in appreciating really insightful

482
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:41,974
drama that's about the subtleties of 
human relationships and moral ambiguous 

483
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,003
situations.
And then they go into the voting booth 

484
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,003
or get on twitter and,
and it's like there's black and there's 

485
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,260
white and that's it.
And,

486
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,820
and,
and I hate those people and I love these

487
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:59,900
people and I can't connect the dots 
between,

488
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,903
you know,
the entertainment media that we 

489
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:09,161
appreciate versus the kind of ideologies
that we over simplify.

490
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,980
Yeah.
I think twitter and I think,

491
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,810
well twitter in particular,
but blogs as well.

492
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,673
I think it is a horrible way to 
communicate when you are saying 

493
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:25,110
something that's in dispute,
you know,

494
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:28,740
because you're not challenged.
And I think there's also,

495
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:31,230
whether it's 140 characters or 280 
characters,

496
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:36,231
I just think this limited way of writing
in text without talking to someone,

497
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:37,974
without being in front of them and 
communicating with them and the 

498
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:40,464
subtleties of human interaction and 
social cues and recognizing people's 

499
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,390
feelings.
And it just,

500
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,150
it's a piss poor way of getting your 
thoughts out.

501
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:50,520
And it's very non human.
You know,

502
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,780
it's,
it's very,

503
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,190
um,
it's,

504
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,024
it,
it tends to gravitate towards cruelty 

505
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,480
because there's no consequences for 
saying cruel things.

506
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:01,314
It's almost like you're throwing a bomb 
over a wall and you don't know who's 

507
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:05,130
over there.
You know,

508
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:05,990
like you don't,
you're,

509
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:07,530
you're not there seeing it.

510
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,350
You're not,
there's something about that that I just

511
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:13,670
think is alien to the human condition.
And I think it's,

512
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,093
it's having a real effect on our 
civilization and our culture and how we 

513
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:21,810
communicate with each other.
And I think it's galvanizing the,

514
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:26,811
the polar opposites and it's making 
people go towards these extreme left and

515
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:30,270
extreme rights,
especially people that are easily led or

516
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,780
maybe not so thoughtful about,
you know,

517
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:38,280
the objective way that they're 
interpreting these events and not,

518
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,173
not being introspective and not looking 
at themselves with a critical eye and 

519
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:43,734
just engaging in this sort of back and 
forth tribal shit with people that I 

520
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:49,914
just think is a,
it's so strange to watch and 

521
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,430
particularly with when you read 
something and it's really well written,

522
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,503
like you could tell this is an 
intelligent person that's written a 

523
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:03,390
bunch of nonsense and called people 
outright and Nazis.

524
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:06,180
And what's the most recent one?
Um,

525
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,930
that box voc speaks about the radical,
what is it?

526
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,000
This is a new,
the radical,

527
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:13,280
right.
The reactionary,

528
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,130
right?
Oh yes.

529
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:15,570
That's it.
The reactionary,

530
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:16,500
right.
This is the new one.

531
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,570
We have a new one now.
It's new.

532
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:20,280
It's only like a couple of weeks old.
The reactionary,

533
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:21,300
right.
It's a baby.

534
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,100
Yeah.
It's time to,

535
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,663
I mean the weird thing is people do have
a hunger for this more primal engaged 

536
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:32,004
kind of long form discussion,
which is why podcasts like this are 

537
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:37,230
really popular.
My people are willing to listen to,

538
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,673
you know,
to reasonably smart people talking for 

539
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:46,461
an hour three about cool topics because 
that's the natural condition.

540
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,250
You know,
imagine our ancestors a hundred thousand

541
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,030
years ago around the campfire having a 
discussion about some fraud issue.

542
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:54,864
Well,
they would talk it through until it was 

543
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:58,770
more or less resolved or unless they at 
least identified,

544
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,143
here's the things we can agree on and 
here's the things we can agree to 

545
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,240
disagree on both twitter,
it's,

546
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,970
it's just the exact opposite.
It's not sitting around the campfire,

547
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,303
it's,
it's lobbing these hand grenades over 

548
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:13,434
the,
and it's an infinite number of hand 

549
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:16,560
grenades.
Like say if you have 30,000

550
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:18,240
followers or something,
God,

551
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:19,074
that's 30,000
people that might be lobbing hand 

552
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:24,480
grenades and then they might retweet to 
a bunch of other people and oh Jesus.

553
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,930
Then kier comes some,
you know,

554
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,783
especially if it's on some hot button 
topic that they would like to chime in 

555
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:30,510
on.
You know,

556
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,020
this,
this is strange.

557
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,700
Yeah.
Well I think,

558
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,730
you know,
the human social psychology is,

559
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:39,564
it's very hard to reach any agreement 
without a certain amount of back and 

560
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:44,034
forth,
preferably face to face in person with 

561
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:49,350
as much time as you need.
Yeah.

562
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,460
And this is why things like,
um,

563
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,370
the sort of time limited presidential 
debates drive me nuts.

564
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,700
I would love to just have 50,
60 hours of candidates.

565
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,623
Sure.
Talking it through and people can tune 

566
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,280
in and just here,
okay,

567
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,430
here,
here's six hours about foreign policy.

568
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:12,264
Let's see what they really,
and then voters could have an informed 

569
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:15,924
choice.
Imagine candidates actually learning 

570
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,590
something from each other,
right.

571
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,503
And being open and honest about that.
Instead they have to pretend that 

572
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:25,104
they're,
their ideas are rock solid and 

573
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:30,690
completely well thought out and rigid 
and impossible to evolve.

574
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,690
This is it.
They've got it and you're wrong.

575
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,920
And more what my opponent wants is some 
something terrible for America.

576
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,150
And God,
we've,

577
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:42,960
when we've seen this hustle so many 
times and yet it's the same hustle every

578
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:45,310
four years.
Yeah.

579
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:50,780
I hope we get to a future where people 
are allowed to be epistemically humble.

580
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:54,060
Like here's what I don't know and I 
don't know a lot about most things.

581
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,350
Even if politicians or scientists or 
media figures,

582
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,770
we're able to take that attitude.
Yeah.

583
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,973
And just,
it kind of gets back to the hypocrisy 

584
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:04,734
point,
right?

585
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,510
Everybody inwardly knows about most 
topics.

586
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,670
I know virtually nothing or I've heard a
few things third hand that I can kind of

587
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,720
regurgitate at a party.
Yeah.

588
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,970
But we're all kind of expected to have 
an informed view about everything.

589
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,830
And this is something I try to model for
my students.

590
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:29,190
Like if they ask a question and I really
don't know the answer,

591
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,640
I try to make a point of saying,
I don't know,

592
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,560
let's look it up.
That's awesome.

593
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,530
That's so important.
The idea that you should know everything

594
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:40,170
about everything is preposterous.
Yeah.

595
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,060
And you know,
if your 20 year old underground,

596
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,480
you don't know what the typical 50 year 
old knows,

597
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:48,010
you might think,
Oh,

598
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:50,800
they've probably mastered most of the 
wisdom and the world already.

599
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,700
Or he might think,
no.

600
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,111
Uh,
the,

601
00:29:54,111 --> 00:29:57,760
there's like gigabytes of stuff and they
can't possibly know at all.

602
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,123
There's such a spectrum to the average 
person that has a like a very intensive 

603
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:03,534
job.
Like say if you're involved in 

604
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:06,420
something,
a computer coding,

605
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,430
electronics,
something that's 10,

606
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,040
12 hours a day,
you're engrossed,

607
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,730
you don't have a lot of time to focus on
other areas.

608
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,743
You don't really have a lot of time to 
expand your understanding of whether 

609
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:21,540
it's biology,
mathematics,

610
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:22,374
whatever it is.
It doesn't apply to what you do for a 

611
00:30:23,191 --> 00:30:25,140
living.
Really have very little time.

612
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,170
So this,
this notion that you,

613
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,660
like people are embarrassed about things
they don't know.

614
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,810
And I think that's really unfortunate.
It's,

615
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,693
it's,
it's one of the main stumbling points 

616
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,620
when it comes to like open and honest 
discourse.

617
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:41,983
There's not,
you're not dumb if you don't know some 

618
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:44,820
things,
you know,

619
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,520
you just don't know some things and you 
just,

620
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:48,121
no way,
you know,

621
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:48,954
everything.

622
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,080
Yeah.
I think that's a great point.

623
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:56,081
A lot of people have these cognitively 
demanding jobs and that's not just white

624
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:59,360
collar workers.
I mean a lot of manual trades.

625
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,423
Um,
you've got to think about what you're 

626
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:02,984
doing and it,
it's hard mental labor and then you get 

627
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:06,704
home and you have dinner and you have 
the kids and their homework and your 

628
00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:11,990
family life.
And what are you going to do?

629
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,320
By the time you finally have some alone 
time at whatever 9:00

630
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,950
PM are you gonna,
you know,

631
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,330
turn on the nature channel and watch a 
really hardcore David attenborough,

632
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,413
you know,
animal behavior documentary or you're 

633
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,490
going to be like,
oh,

634
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,140
just rewatch,
you know,

635
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,170
um,
unbranded or whatever.

636
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,140
Yeah.

637
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,831
Yeah.
I mean,

638
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:34,050
people want escape at that point.
Yeah.

639
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,870
It's,
there's not enough time in the day.

640
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,050
One of the most beautiful things about 
podcasts,

641
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:39,884
it was completely unexpected for me,
is that it gives me this very unusual 

642
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,034
opportunity to sit down and talk to 
somebody without any interruptions for 

643
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:48,150
three hours,
which I could never ask someone to do in

644
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:50,370
real life.
And why it never came up before.

645
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,470
Like even to have dinner.
If you and I went out to dinner,

646
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,210
we'd be talking in,
you know,

647
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:57,930
maybe someone else would be with us,
different conversations to be eating all

648
00:31:57,931 --> 00:31:59,280
this amazing.
Did you try that?

649
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,163
Oh,
this is good.

650
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,111
Yeah,
what do you have to blah,

651
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:01,590
blah,
blah.

652
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,750
This is like little simple 
conversations.

653
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:04,584
It's fun and everything,
but it's not completely locked in like 

654
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:10,230
this with the headphones on through a 
microphone.

655
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:13,110
The knowledge that other people are 
listening and that these,

656
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,063
these subjects that you're discussing,
you're allowing these ideas to play 

657
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:19,344
themselves out and you're,
you're sort of moving them around and 

658
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,450
asking questions and you're looking at 
them from different angles.

659
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:25,284
And,
and to have that liberty and freedom to 

660
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:30,930
do that is a very rare thing.
And for people that get to listen.

661
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,943
And I,
I enjoy Sam Harris's podcast in 

662
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,830
particular radio labs,
one of my favorite,

663
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,430
but one of the th there's so many good 
ones out there,

664
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:39,264
but what's really good about them is 
that you get a chance to listen to 

665
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:48,761
discourse uninterrupted and uncensored 
undirected.

666
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,643
And this is something that I think is 
sorely missing from the rest of our 

667
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,264
culture.
And it's one of the reasons why these 

668
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,220
things have caught on so well.

669
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,623
Yeah.
I mean if you respect the ideas that 

670
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:03,900
you're talking about,
you should be willing to give time yes.

671
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,030
And attention.
Yeah.

672
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:05,963
And let them kind of breathe,
like opening a bottle of wine and just 

673
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:12,030
letting it do the aeration thing before 
you pour it.

674
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,073
And

675
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,060
it's funny how much of a thirst there is
for that.

676
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,890
I mean,
if you'd asked me 10 years ago,

677
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,490
would anybody ever spend three hours 
listening to a podcast,

678
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:23,211
I would have said,
no,

679
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,044
there's just this,
there's one way out acceleration of 

680
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:31,811
culture that's going to be faster and 
faster and nobody will watch more than a

681
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:33,630
92nd clip on youtube.
It's,

682
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,610
that'll be it.
Yeah.

683
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,013
And instead it's the opposite way.
I think people have a yearning for a 

684
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:40,484
more relaxed pace of dialogue that is 
actually a break from the frenetic pace 

685
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:49,070
of their work life.
Right.

686
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,880
Yeah.
Um,

687
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,680
I think even like leaning towards things
that are like tech reviews,

688
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,560
things along those lines,
those are getting longer and longer when

689
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:01,430
people are just,
I mean,

690
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,293
there was never a television show where 
someone would discuss cell phones in 

691
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:10,040
depth with no interruption for over an 
hour.

692
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,903
That's very common now where,
where someone will go over all the 

693
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:16,880
different details of a phone and let you
know,

694
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:17,714
like,
here,

695
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,080
here's what's new about the galaxy note 
nine and,

696
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,193
and the,
the gift fucking hundreds of thousands 

697
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,830
of views.
Like clearly someone's missed something.

698
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:26,721
Yeah.
I mean,

699
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:27,554
even on Youtube,
like you can get 25 minute reviews of 

700
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,870
like an ar 15 accessory.
Yeah.

701
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,400
Not just like the rifle,
but like the red dot scope or whatever.

702
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,230
And um,
or you,

703
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,990
I'm sure there long but wanting reviews 
or whatever.

704
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,340
Oh yeah.
There's a lot.

705
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,500
Yeah.
I've seen them all.

706
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,720
And I,
I mean,

707
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:49,550
I think that's just a more natural pace 
of,

708
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,510
uh,
human human discourse because no bear in

709
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:54,950
mind,
like a hundred thousand years ago,

710
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:56,750
sitting around the fire with a bunch of 
people,

711
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,290
no smartphones,
no video,

712
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,240
no TV,
no movies,

713
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,300
no recorded music.
The entertainment is each other and it's

714
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:09,890
not rushed.
It's like the sun,

715
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,233
the sun went down.
None of us are going to sleep for four 

716
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:14,680
hours.
Um,

717
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,990
what do we do?
Entertain each other with jokes.

718
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,950
No,
I mean,

719
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,530
break out the Ukulele.
They wouldn't have done standup comedy,

720
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:23,420
but there would have done sit down 
comedy.

721
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,310
Well,
somebody's probably stood up.

722
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,480
Yeah.
You know,

723
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,660
held court told some good stories,
you know,

724
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,670
I mean,
a good story is always valued.

725
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,463
Good storyteller.
This is what my anthropologist 

726
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:37,410
colleagues tell me is,
you know,

727
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:39,870
your status,
if you're in a tribal society,

728
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:40,704
a small scale society is heavily 
dependent on not just how good a hunter 

729
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:47,490
you are,
how many kids you have.

730
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:50,430
It's how entertaining are you in the 
evenings.

731
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,383
Sure.
And the people who are just break the 

732
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:56,730
monotony or just gold there,
their treasured.

733
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,980
Yeah.
They give you fuel to give you energy.

734
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:00,963
Like when you're around someone who's 
really hilarious to telling great 

735
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:04,840
stories,
he like everyone around it was like,

736
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,240
ah,
you get fired up by it.

737
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,560
Yeah,
yeah.

738
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,150
Um,
it's,

739
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,620
I don't,
I mean I have a rosy view of the future.

740
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:20,470
I'm very optimistic and I think that all
the chaos that we're going through right

741
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,870
now politically and socially in 
particular,

742
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:23,704
this is,
I feel like this is just an adolescent 

743
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,640
period of communication that we are 
experiencing this,

744
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,840
this open flood.
Like we've opened up the,

745
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:34,674
the barriers for communication.
Anybody can communicate now and it's 

746
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:38,524
just k and it's going to take a while 
before the discourse levels out and 

747
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:48,520
you've got a lot of loud noises on,
on all sides.

748
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,060
And there's a lot of people fighting for
power and fighting,

749
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,790
fighting for virtue,
fighting for,

750
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,323
you know,
whatever Social Brownie points they get 

751
00:36:58,061 --> 00:36:58,894
by pointing out their position being 
correct and your position being foolish 

752
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:05,050
and silly.
And this is the future and this is done.

753
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,390
And it's,
there's a,

754
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,950
there's this cruel aspect to it,
which is interesting.

755
00:37:08,951 --> 00:37:09,784
Like when if someone missed steps and 
someone says something that they regret 

756
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,100
and then they delete it,
there's this cancel culture,

757
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:20,120
get rid of 'em off with his head because
people realize the immediacy of all this

758
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,900
and there was terrified of it happening 
to them.

759
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,790
So it's like they're just throwing rocks
at whoever might be the accused.

760
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,320
It's fascinating to watch,
you know,

761
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,653
I mean we're going to need a whole new 
set of social norms where people just 

762
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,253
calm the fuck down about this stuff.
And I think it's kind of analogist like 

763
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,490
one of my favorite books about kind of 
social history is called dog,

764
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:47,660
the bourgeois virtues by Deidre 
mccloskey and economic historian.

765
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:48,494
And she points out when you switch from 
like the Middle Ages where everyone's a 

766
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:56,431
peasant to this urbanized commercial 
culture where people are mostly um,

767
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,663
traders and they have little shops and 
whatever they needed to learn how to 

768
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:01,714
interact with strangers to provide value
for money and they needed a whole new 

769
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:11,221
set of virtues that had to do with 
reliability and thinking,

770
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,113
what am I making,
what goods or services in my providing 

771
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:17,980
that actually are useful?
And it took,

772
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,083
you know,
a couple of generations for people to 

773
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:22,803
enter that kind of capitalist mode of 
what can I do that's helpful to others 

774
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,810
that can support my family.

775
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,290
And I think now we have a cultural shift
where we realize,

776
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,413
given social media,
how do we cope with the fact that 

777
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:37,414
everybody virtue signals,
everybody sometimes says things that 

778
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,374
are,
that are mean and stupid and everyone's 

779
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:48,661
fallible and anything you say will be on
a permanent record basically.

780
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,490
Um,
how do we cope with that?

781
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:52,391
You know,
we're,

782
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:53,224
we're used to a sort of public culture 
where everything is very polished and 

783
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:02,190
edited and curated and,
and that time has gone.

784
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,753
So we need a new set of kind of social 
and moral norms that cut each other a 

785
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:10,750
lot more slack,
I think.

786
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,193
Yeah,
I would agree with you and I would say 

787
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:14,234
that the inclination towards tightness 
and communication and understanding 

788
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,520
should be rewarded and that we,
we,

789
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,373
we need to reward that.
And I don't want to say ostracized 

790
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:31,430
people that are inclined to go towards 
this cancel culture idea,

791
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,980
but we need to let people be aware of 
it.

792
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,173
You know,
we were talking before the podcast that 

793
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,090
I have like all these emails that I 
can't catch up on because I was gone.

794
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,230
I was in the mountains for six days with
no cell phone service at all.

795
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,320
I felt better when I was there.
I just did.

796
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,453
I feel like there's a certain amount of 
anxiety that comes with being connected 

797
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:53,204
to all these people all the time and 
constantly checking your mentions and 

798
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,380
constantly looking at Google news to 
find out what chaos is coming our way.

799
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,213
And it's just,
I just don't think that that's healthy 

800
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,353
and I don't think,
I think I do my very best to mitigate 

801
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,920
the negative effects of it,
but my very best is not good.

802
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,510
So don't think we're doing a great job 
because when it's taken away from me,

803
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,270
and I've had this happen twice over the 
last few months,

804
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,310
um,
I was in Lanai,

805
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,173
this small island off of why one of the 
Hawaiian islands and I broke my phone 

806
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,030
and it took a few days for them to send 
me a new one and I was like,

807
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:30,170
God,
why do I feel so good?

808
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,740
I feel so present and it feels so 
healthy.

809
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,520
And then this last past week,
the same thing,

810
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,890
no cell phone service for all these 
days.

811
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:41,510
And so I just felt better.

812
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,473
I think there's a funny thing even that 
it happened with burning man culture 

813
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:46,264
where like when it got started in the 
early nineties it was let's all come 

814
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:52,510
together and have this excitement of 
interacting more.

815
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:53,883
And now since burning man is one of the 
few places where you don't get cell 

816
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:58,960
phone service and you can't really be 
online,

817
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,280
it's like,
Oh man,

818
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:04,570
this is such a relief because we 
literally can't stay connected.

819
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:08,020
And the community we're in is only 
70,000

820
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:11,260
people instead of 331

821
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,110
it was almost boulder that's almost 
boulder,

822
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:14,944
Colorado.
I think boulder's a little bit over 100 

823
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,990
so 70,000
is,

824
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,970
that's a fucking big city of freaks.
It's

825
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,153
city,
but it feels intimate compared to 

826
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:27,710
twitter.
Ooh,

827
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,653
right.
Yeah,

828
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,150
for sure.
Yeah.

829
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,440
I,
I'm fascinated by burning man.

830
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,160
I

831
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,750
can't go because hippies will drive me 
crazy and there's too much dust.

832
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:39,843
Yeah.
But I love the idea and I'm up fully 

833
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:42,530
support.
If there was like a fun do,

834
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:45,650
you could write a check like to support 
burning man.

835
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,740
I supported as a project,
as an idea.

836
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,753
I don't necessarily want to go there 
until they got it really polished and 

837
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:52,334
worked out.
But I think what the idea behind it is 

838
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,240
fascinating.
It's the people saying,

839
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,260
I don't like this.
I don't like where this is going.

840
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,950
I think there's a lot of people that 
would like to do something different.

841
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,070
Let's just try it out for a week.
Let's just everybody,

842
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:07,904
let's agree,
we'll get together through these days 

843
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,753
and let's,
let's just fucking dance and we'll have 

844
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:16,220
glow sticks and where pastries and get 
fucking crazy and do ecstasy.

845
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:19,550
And a lot of people were like,
fuck yeah,

846
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,563
let's do it.

847
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:25,490
And then this thing happens and this 
thing is only a few years old.

848
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,720
I mean it really is.
What,

849
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,690
a decade and a half.
How many years have they been doing it?

850
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,800
The night?
The first burning man.

851
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:32,634
It was like the late eighties but it was
just like a couple dozen people and now 

852
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:40,510
it gradually grew and it really became a
pretty solidified subculture by probably

853
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:46,871
the late nineties and no leadership.
Well there is guy behind it.

854
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,610
There's behind the scenes leadership of 
course.

855
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,653
I mean that's another fascinating thing 
is depending on the political lenses 

856
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:57,254
that you wear when you go there,
it's either like a libertarian paradise 

857
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,390
or it's a communist paradise.
Mm.

858
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,230
Or it's pantonium self organization of 
some sort.

859
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,890
Um,
but there's,

860
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,030
there certainly are people who are kind 
of coordinating it.

861
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:11,864
It's just they're not,
well there's tickets now you have two 

862
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,220
tickets.
It's hard to get,

863
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,660
it's hard to get tickets.

864
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,750
It's even hard to get a parking pass.
But this is my point.

865
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:23,420
Like why would they want to limit this 
thing?

866
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,820
Like who,
who is like a bit coin thing.

867
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:26,654
Like you're arbitrarily limiting the 
amount of bitcoin or deciding there's 

868
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:32,740
only a certain number and they're doing 
this with humans are just saying,

869
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:35,480
well I can't really go over 70,000
is just,

870
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,640
it's not going to work.
But what if they did?

871
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,830
What if they just opened up the 
floodgates and said,

872
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:41,590
anybody who wants to come to burning man
and,

873
00:43:41,591 --> 00:43:43,790
and,
and get get fucking crazy.

874
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,760
Just come on down.
How many things,

875
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,990
how many things would come?
Um,

876
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,190
half million pool boy.
But it would be chaos,

877
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,024
right?
Cause it would like who supplies the 

878
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,693
porter potties and the emergency medical
services and the therapists for people 

879
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,970
having bad trips.
Mm.

880
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,333
Um,
like you need some infrastructure and 

881
00:44:08,241 --> 00:44:09,140
then,
you know,

882
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,543
Nevada state police have to kind of make
sure there's not like murderers and 

883
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,440
stuff,
but do they come around?

884
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,580
Oh yeah.
The wander around.

885
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:22,100
They police how fast you drive and they 
must be so annoyed.

886
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,293
Like what did they have been dealing 
with up until Bernie man fucking 

887
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:27,560
nothing.
No,

888
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:30,200
just a little bit of mass hearing.
Their cow got loose.

889
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,920
Someone blew up a trailer

890
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,090
cause they got their mixture wrong.

891
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:36,730
But yeah,
it's,

892
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:39,200
it's fascinating in terms of,
um,

893
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:44,050
how quickly it went from not being a 
thing at all to being its own subculture

894
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:49,051
with its own mooch.
They'll moral norms and dress styles and

895
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:53,590
systems of virtue signaling and um,

896
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,860
yeah,

897
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,860
sort of political expectations about 
what beliefs are the right ones to have,

898
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:04,930
even though it didn't start out 
political at all.

899
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,243
Well,
whenever you get freaky you go left 

900
00:45:07,151 --> 00:45:07,984
wing.
Like if you get freedom and freaky and 

901
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:12,640
drugs,
it's left wing period.

902
00:45:12,641 --> 00:45:14,140
Right?
I mean there's no real,

903
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,600
I mean unless it's some eyes wide shut 
type shit.

904
00:45:16,601 --> 00:45:19,090
We were wearing masks and everybody's 
got a

905
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,470
right.
Yeah.

906
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:25,590
You don't typically hear people like,
well I went to burning man,

907
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:26,443
I dropped acid and,
and I realized like Mormon monogamy has 

908
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:32,550
really the proper way to live.

909
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,190
Yeah.
They're nice people though.

910
00:45:37,191 --> 00:45:39,010
They might be right.
Yeah.

911
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,053
Yeah.
Mormons are the nicest called of all 

912
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:43,130
time there.
They are.

913
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:44,540
Some of the nicest folks.
I know.

914
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:49,690
If I had to say if like there's one 
religion or I had to say like what are,

915
00:45:50,241 --> 00:45:51,074
what are the,
what are your expectations of 

916
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:54,800
friendliness and niceness?
Like wait,

917
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:56,750
where's,
where's the highest expectation?

918
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,920
For me,
it's Mormons.

919
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,610
That's one religion.
Like I think it's nonsense.

920
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:03,710
I think Joseph Smith was a little con 
man,

921
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,573
1820 when he found golden tablets that 
contain the loss work of Jesus and only 

922
00:46:08,151 --> 00:46:10,850
he could read him cause you had a magic 
rock and all that crazy shit.

923
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,013
It is absolutely ridiculous.
But the end result is a bunch of really 

924
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:18,530
nice folks.
Like they have a wonderful community.

925
00:46:18,531 --> 00:46:19,364
They're really nice to each other.
Once they got rid of all that polygamy 

926
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:22,510
shit,
you know,

927
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,760
once they got rid of the 90 wives and 
you know,

928
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,430
dressing up like a pilgrim,
they,

929
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,650
they became like a really nice community
of people.

930
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:32,720
They're like generally really friendly.

931
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,840
So my Granddad,
who was a business school professor,

932
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,070
um,
back in the forties,

933
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:38,904
he moved his,
his little family to Salt Lake City and 

934
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:41,694
they live there for a while and he was 
really inspired by the kind of family 

935
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:44,694
values.
And I think that was one reason he sort 

936
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:51,330
of went on to have 12 kids of his own.
And not that he turned mormon,

937
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:56,360
but he thought they're onto something in
terms of how seriously they take,

938
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,560
um,
the future,

939
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,910
both on earth and in the afterlife.
They believe in the afterlife,

940
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,560
don't they get a plan and have their own
when they die?

941
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,731
Right.
Well,

942
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:07,590
this is something I loved about the TV 
series,

943
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,390
the expanse.
I don't know if you've seen it.

944
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,210
We keep hearing about it and I haven't 
gotten into it yet.

945
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:14,970
It's just too many damn shows.
They're awesome to watch these days.

946
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,010
But as soon as I'm done with Ozark,

947
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:17,883
I'm gonna jump in.
What I loved about it is it's maybe a 

948
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:21,463
couple of hundred years in the future.
And so we've colonized Mars and the 

949
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,073
asteroid belt and there's one group of 
people who are building the first ship 

950
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:29,683
to

951
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:34,090
the distant star system and who's doing 
it?

952
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,070
The Mormons of course.
And I thought,

953
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:36,933
of course,
of course it's going to be a religion 

954
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,173
that has a farsighted approach and 
that's kind of pro natalist and that's 

955
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,280
all about family values and like 
increasing their numbers and,

956
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:52,480
and yeah,
of course it's going to be that.

957
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:53,314
I'm not

958
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,343
okay.

959
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:58,850
What's the social justice warriors 
putting together and star ship?

960
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,320
Yeah.
Did you ever see the um,

961
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:04,813
um,
the Osman family photograph from one of 

962
00:48:08,061 --> 00:48:08,894
their albums,
the early albums where they all got 

963
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:13,550
their own planet because they think that
when you die you get your own planet.

964
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,413
And so the album was based on that 
concept and like if you open up the 

965
00:48:18,621 --> 00:48:19,580
album,
it's like,

966
00:48:19,581 --> 00:48:20,660
Oh,
here's a fun planet.

967
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:21,410
Donnie.
Look,

968
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,090
Murray's got her own little asteroid 
belt.

969
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,250
Yeah.
Third,

970
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,340
they're totally locked and loaded to do 
the uh,

971
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,950
the interstellar colonization.
It's strange though.

972
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,400
I mean it's true.
It's strange the blinders that people go

973
00:48:34,401 --> 00:48:38,420
on that people put on and that they 
would put those blinders on.

974
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,230
Like it's almost like if you just can 
go,

975
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:43,064
hey look,
let's just all admit Joseph Smith was 

976
00:48:44,481 --> 00:48:45,314
full of shit,
but we got a good thing going on here 

977
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:47,924
folks.

978
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,063
We're all real nice to each other and 
that seems to be some real positive 

979
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:52,154
energy involved and believing in this 
higher power and this greater good and 

980
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,740
this overwhelming sense of community 
that we all have.

981
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,233
And they have a sense of humor about it,
like the way they reacted to the South 

982
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,630
Park guys doing book of Mormon.
It's fantastic.

983
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,523
It's like fair enough.
They took that Hillary page ad in the 

984
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:09,110
playbook.
I mean that,

985
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:09,944
that and that is a brutal musical in 
terms of like the way they're depicted 

986
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:16,303
buffoons believing in nonsense,
trying to recruit these indigenous 

987
00:49:20,031 --> 00:49:21,200
people.
It's kind of,

988
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,440
I mean it's ruthless and hilarious at 
the same time and they're like,

989
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:26,570
wonderful.
If you want to find out more about being

990
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:28,250
a mormon here,
come,

991
00:49:28,251 --> 00:49:29,150
come,
come to our website.

992
00:49:29,151 --> 00:49:30,320
Come check it out.
Thank you.

993
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,540
I think having that humility and that 
sense of humor about what you're doing,

994
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:41,290
I wish we saw more of that in like 
academia because there's a lot of fields

995
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:47,570
that are very bad and don't do good 
work,

996
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:50,120
but that are terribly,
terribly serious about it.

997
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,240
Like what gender studies or dare you,
social psychology,

998
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,613
gender studies.
I posted something on instagram 

999
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,290
yesterday.
Um,

1000
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:06,850
I was at a bookstore and there is a 
feminist baby.

1001
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,193
A book says feminist baby finds her 
voice and it's a baby screaming into a 

1002
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:14,050
bull horn.
Look at this picture,

1003
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:20,250
baby screaming into a bull horn and,
and I said that the lines between parody

1004
00:50:21,941 --> 00:50:24,880
and reality have never been blurrier and
some people laugh,

1005
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:28,030
but a lot of people call me a piece of 
shit and I

1006
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,920
is one of the rare times I dove into the
comments just to take a little look,

1007
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:33,770
see into the gates of hell,
but look,

1008
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:34,604
that's fucking parody folks.
Why is the baby screaming into a bull 

1009
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:39,710
horn?
What voice does she have?

1010
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,603
Did what?
What oppression is she rallying against 

1011
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:43,744
at three months old?
Is she screaming about the patriarchy 

1012
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,240
when she can't even fucking talk yet and
he hears more parody?

1013
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,940
Why she fat and ugly?
What kind of baby is that?

1014
00:50:52,941 --> 00:50:55,010
Baby looks like a thumb.
She doesn't even have a chin.

1015
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,290
This is chaos.
It's not even a real baby.

1016
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,160
It's like an m and m with legs.
It's crazy.

1017
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,053
Look,
she got fucked up hair and they've 

1018
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,180
already gendered her.
They put a bow on her,

1019
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:07,250
which is really fucked up to do to a 
baby.

1020
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,800
You've decided that she's a girl.
How dare you?

1021
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:13,100
You piece of shit.
You transphobic asshole

1022
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:16,300
and the [inaudible] is a little bit 
over.

1023
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:16,780
Yeah,

1024
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:20,970
she's got horror makeup on.
She dressed up like a fuck clown already

1025
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:23,520
as a baby.
Fucked up hair.

1026
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,950
Child abuse,
big nutty eyes.

1027
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:29,010
It's crazy.
Finds her voice.

1028
00:51:29,011 --> 00:51:30,660
She found her voice.
Fantastic.

1029
00:51:30,661 --> 00:51:33,510
She can't talk yet.
That's a baby.

1030
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,510
What we should all listen to the baby.
Give the baby a bull horn.

1031
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,780
Let's all gather round.
I got poop.

1032
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,170
What does the baby,
what is it baby saying?

1033
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,050
She finds her voice.
Look,

1034
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,730
it's parody even at the book is 
wonderful.

1035
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,860
I don't know that it's not.
Maybe it's a great book.

1036
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:50,723
Maybe it's fun.
Maybe it's a silly book that's parody 

1037
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:54,743
that fuck.
That would be a goddamn character on 

1038
00:51:56,311 --> 00:51:57,144
south park.
A baby feminist with a bow that screams 

1039
00:52:00,361 --> 00:52:03,300
at the top of her lungs.
What does this free the nipple.

1040
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,323
Hmm.

1041
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,060
Oh,
like right now I'm hungry.

1042
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,800
I get it.
Yeah.

1043
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,210
Oh,
is that from the book?

1044
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,950
That's from the book.
I guess feminist baby,

1045
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:13,660
maybe it's a great book.
I think it's satire,

1046
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,580
but it's what I do.
I mean,

1047
00:52:15,581 --> 00:52:16,414
here's the thing,
like if you're in a field where you 

1048
00:52:17,711 --> 00:52:21,010
can't tell whether something is from it 
or it's city Oracle,

1049
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:21,873
right,
then you need to lighten up about your 

1050
00:52:23,261 --> 00:52:24,250
field.
Yes.

1051
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:29,050
And just gender studies in particular.
Well yeah,

1052
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,330
in particular,
but um,

1053
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,440
but what is it about it that leans 
itself towards foolishness?

1054
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:41,343
I think it's very hard to do good work 
in a field where you have to everyday 

1055
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,063
systematically denying common sense and,
and deny the evidence of your own eyes 

1056
00:52:54,261 --> 00:52:56,390
and ears about what's right in front of 
you.

1057
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:57,224
Like how sex differences work.
I think that creates a habit of 

1058
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,213
interacting with the world in a way that
says what I study is going to beat 

1059
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:09,134
completely divorced from every aspect of
day to day life and everybody else I 

1060
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:17,210
encounter who's not in my field.
Because if,

1061
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,500
if you allow any crosstalk between like,

1062
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:23,823
yeah,

1063
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,140
you're sort of blank slate,
gender ideology and the real world,

1064
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,633
the ideology crumbles so you can,
you can only maintain it behind this 

1065
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:34,944
wall of,
of insulation and that's a terrible 

1066
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:41,340
position to be in.
I don't envy the people who,

1067
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,810
who live their lives that way.

1068
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,613
It all grows inside the walled gardens 
of academia and outside of that it's 

1069
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,830
these,
you know,

1070
00:53:50,831 --> 00:53:51,664
you get Internet groups from people that
sort of were indoctrinated into these 

1071
00:53:55,241 --> 00:53:57,130
ideas in,
in college or,

1072
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,980
and it's also,
I think in some ways there's a,

1073
00:53:59,981 --> 00:54:00,814
a leveling of the playing field that a 
lot of these ideologies present some 

1074
00:54:04,901 --> 00:54:07,630
people where they,
they go,

1075
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:08,530
no,
you're not a freak.

1076
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:10,390
You're okay.
You know this,

1077
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,553
there was some silly article on fat 
acceptance the other day and it was 

1078
00:54:15,161 --> 00:54:17,350
talking and they,
then they got proposed,

1079
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,193
which is fine.
I accept people who drink except I've 

1080
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:25,030
except all kinds of unhealthy choices.
But let's don't lie to me,

1081
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:25,920
just

1082
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,370
don't lie about the physical reality of 
what you've done to your body.

1083
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:31,230
If you reach 400 pounds,
that's not,

1084
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,240
that's not healthy.
You're saying it's healthy.

1085
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,530
You're saying it's okay.
No,

1086
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:37,770
you're just not dead yet.
If you lost 200 pounds,

1087
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:40,650
you would feel wonderful.
That would be healthier.

1088
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,990
Like if you smoke every day and you're 
like,

1089
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:43,351
look,
no,

1090
00:54:43,351 --> 00:54:45,180
cancer smoking is healthy.
No,

1091
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,014
no,
you're just,

1092
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,960
you're just,
your body is dealing with it.

1093
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,200
Your body's processing it.
It won't be able to forever.

1094
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,333
That is exactly what's going on.
If you're morbidly obese and for you to 

1095
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:56,964
pretend any differently and to just go 
on about this fat acceptance movement 

1096
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:02,574
and you know,
the big beautiful this and that and 

1097
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:05,431
like,
no,

1098
00:55:05,431 --> 00:55:07,860
you're obese.
You've eaten too much food.

1099
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:11,580
If you see a fat guy,
how come he doesn't get the same sort of

1100
00:55:11,581 --> 00:55:12,414
treatment?
If you see a morbidly obese man in his 

1101
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:15,414
underwear,
no one's saying he's beautiful because 

1102
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:20,970
he's disgusting and he's fat and he's 
lazy and he's,

1103
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,550
he's addicted to food.
We all know it.

1104
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:24,683
But if it's a woman,
we're so inclined to like acts such as 

1105
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:29,070
the care.
Let her go.

1106
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,870
She's fine,
you're wonderful,

1107
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:33,420
you're beautiful,
you're amazing.

1108
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,600
Like kid give her her space,
we treat them as if they're incapable of

1109
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:43,950
recognizing the absolute reality of 
their physical being.

1110
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,250
I think it's important,
you know,

1111
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:48,084
to address both the kind of individual 
choice level and also the kind of 

1112
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:54,294
systemic level like the food industry 
and what is being promoted and what the 

1113
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:01,290
federal government promoted for ages.
And,

1114
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:06,980
um,
it was this terrible situation where you

1115
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:08,154
could have followed exactly what the FDA
recommended and it would have been bad 

1116
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:12,384
for you for decades.
And because of lobbying and because of 

1117
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:17,724
the powers that be and an influence.
And I think that's the level to 

1118
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,490
criticize,
right?

1119
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,533
If you have a systemic problem like 
promotion of tobacco products and you 

1120
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:32,830
want to say for alternative,
um,

1121
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,950
then yeah,
you got to address the tobacco industry.

1122
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:40,930
We have this bizarre situation for 
example,

1123
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:41,983
um,
where like a lot of people in my 

1124
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:46,450
department work on alcoholism treatment 
research.

1125
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:47,284
How do you get people to drink less or 
they work on how do you get people to 

1126
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,240
stop taking opiates?

1127
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:56,320
How do you deal with opiate addiction?
And if you make a suggestion like,

1128
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,560
oh,
here's some awesome new research showing

1129
00:56:59,561 --> 00:57:02,200
that if people switch from opiates to 
cannabis,

1130
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,380
it like dramatically lowers the risk of 
death.

1131
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,110
Or if they switch from alcohol to 
cannabis,

1132
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:09,303
it,
it has all these health benefits 

1133
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,393
relatively to like being an alcoholic,
but it's kind of considered to bu to 

1134
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:22,321
raise that and a lot of medicine and 
psychology and so forth.

1135
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:25,090
Well it's like,
oh,

1136
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:25,924
you're,
you're giving into people being self 

1137
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,690
indulgent.
If you say,

1138
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:29,524
they said they should switch from one 
thing to another in a kind of harm 

1139
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:36,400
reduction mode,
almost like Methadone type solution.

1140
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,593
Yeah.
And a lot of them come out of a kind of 

1141
00:57:39,851 --> 00:57:43,900
12 step program mentality where it's 
like you have a disease.

1142
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:47,530
If you ever do anything that is bad for 
you,

1143
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:51,070
then you've relapsed and that's feeding 
your disease.

1144
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,780
I think that's idiotic.
And that's not the evidence shows,

1145
00:57:55,781 --> 00:57:59,170
that's not the way to treat any of these
physical addictions.

1146
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,240
But,
um,

1147
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,340
something like cannabis as an 
alternative is it's totally marginalized

1148
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:14,290
in academia.
Like you really can't talk about it as a

1149
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:15,124
valid alternative where people could 
come home and they can drink or they 

1150
00:58:19,361 --> 00:58:20,194
could come home and they could get high 
and maybe getting high for a lot of 

1151
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:26,680
people might be better.
It's is that changing though?

1152
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,440
I haven't seen any evidence that it's 
changing,

1153
00:58:29,441 --> 00:58:30,274
at least within academia really.
I would think that that would be one of 

1154
00:58:32,981 --> 00:58:33,814
the first places where it does change 
because the influence of the 

1155
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:41,311
pharmaceutical industry isn't so deeply 
entwined in the system itself.

1156
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,513
It's not like pharmaceutical industry.
People are dropping off pamphlets on 

1157
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,890
talking points when you're giving 
lectures.

1158
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,390
Well,
here's the problem.

1159
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,540
Who gives you the research funding to 
look into this?

1160
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,493
Right?
National Institute of Alcohol and 

1161
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:58,570
alcoholism or National Institute of Drug
Abuse.

1162
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,960
If you do a grant proposal that says 
here's an alternative that might work,

1163
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,350
they will shut it down because the 
federal government does not.

1164
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,000
Those agencies don't want to blow back 
of some senators saying,

1165
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:17,590
how dare you fund this research that 
says this is a valid alternative.

1166
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,693
Yeah.
So everyone who works in these areas is 

1167
00:59:20,441 --> 00:59:22,070
kind of locked into a system

1168
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:23,623
of,
of grant funding that subject to kind 

1169
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:27,470
of,
um,

1170
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,860
political censorship by the funding 
agencies.

1171
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,353
Do you remember those?
A talking dog commercials of about 10 

1172
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:39,740
years ago where there was a girl,
she comes home from school and the dog's

1173
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:40,574
like,
Lindsey really wish you wouldn't smoke 

1174
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:44,660
putt.
He not the same when you do.

1175
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:48,230
And I miss my friend and the girl 
sitting there stoned out of her mind,

1176
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:49,064
her dogs talking to her dog runs away.
It turns out that the organization that 

1177
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:58,460
funded those commercials was funded by 
tobacco,

1178
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:01,880
alcohol and pharmaceutical companies.
Yeah.

1179
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,320
Like they're drug dealers who are 
against drugs.

1180
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,220
It's literally like hookers doing a 
commercial against strippers.

1181
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:15,730
That's literally what it's like.
And we just accepted this and it was all

1182
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:18,080
over television.
It was everywhere you look,

1183
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,570
it became parody and he became 
preposterous.

1184
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:22,640
It was like,
this is your brain on drugs.

1185
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,260
You remember the eggs and everybody's 
like,

1186
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:25,094
I'm hungry.
I mean a meat million comedians had 

1187
01:00:26,631 --> 01:00:29,000
jokes on that.
Give me the Munchies,

1188
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:29,834
man,
this is just insanity that this is 

1189
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:34,394
allowed to take place is that drugs that
kill enormous numbers of people are 

1190
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:44,681
allowed to demonize drugs that kill no 
one ever in the history of use.

1191
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,303
If you looked at that rationally,
if you were something from some other 

1192
01:00:48,831 --> 01:00:49,664
planet that was studying the human race 
and you saw the way we program people 

1193
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:55,933
and the way we spend enormous sums of 
money to project a certain idea and get 

1194
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:06,920
it into people's heads through these 
very influential short,

1195
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,100
memorable videos,
you'd be like,

1196
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:12,970
this is a culture and a civilization.
Uh,

1197
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:14,030
uh,
an org,

1198
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:17,420
an organism that is matt.
This is madness.

1199
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,260
Yeah.
I often asked myself,

1200
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,310
how is this going to look in 50 or a 
hundred years to whatever my,

1201
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,400
my great grandkids or future people who 
stumble upon my books or this podcast or

1202
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:31,550
whatever.

1203
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:32,383
And I think if this would make zero 
sense and would it be totally 

1204
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:40,010
embarrassing both intellectually and 
ethically,

1205
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:45,050
then don't take it seriously and this 
particular issue,

1206
01:01:45,051 --> 01:01:45,884
I think it's really important for 
citizens to understand how much of 

1207
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:50,024
science is constrained by what can be 
funded by the federal government and 

1208
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:55,574
that we are not actually supported to do
certain kinds of research that might be 

1209
01:01:59,991 --> 01:02:03,860
really helpful to people.
It's the same thing with sex research,

1210
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:04,903
right?
It is virtually impossible to get 

1211
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:10,730
federal funding to do any kind of sex 
research in America these days.

1212
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,373
So what do you do?
You write a grant to do something else 

1213
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,573
and then you kind of do this x research 
on the side using like some of the 

1214
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:20,640
resources.

1215
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:22,050
Um,
I don't do this,

1216
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:24,690
but everybody I know does sex research 
does it,

1217
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,033
is it because they're concerned that the
image of funding sex research versus 

1218
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:36,260
funding,
whether it's obesity or hunger,

1219
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,210
poverty,
whatever it is,

1220
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,313
these are,
there's not enough resources to go 

1221
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:42,654
around.
Why would you spend any money studying 

1222
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:44,604
this?
You must be

1223
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,100
pervert.
It's partly that,

1224
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:48,630
but it's,
it's partly,

1225
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:51,363
you know,
the individuals in Washington who 

1226
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:58,680
administer these grants don't want the 
political flack.

1227
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,350
If some politician discovers,
oh,

1228
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:03,030
you're,
you're doing funding on,

1229
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:07,260
on like how women can have more orgasms.
Outrageous.

1230
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,910
Right.
And it's like,

1231
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,343
that sounds like one of the most cost 
effective ways to increase human 

1232
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:15,220
happiness I've ever heard of.
Right.

1233
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,003
Right.
But people are embarrassed of or glare 

1234
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,600
embarrassed about it.
Embarrassing of all sex.

1235
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,520
Yeah.
Um,

1236
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,460
marital therapy,
research you can do,

1237
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:27,323
like if you want to research,
how do you make a monogamous 

1238
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:32,760
relationship less full of stress and 
argument,

1239
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:36,270
you can get some money to do that.
But even there,

1240
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,153
like the kind of suggestions you could 
make are quite restricted in terms of 

1241
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:45,990
what,
what kind of therapy you're allowed to,

1242
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:51,130
to research or talk about.
So I,

1243
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,353
yeah,
I wish citizens understood this because 

1244
01:03:55,651 --> 01:04:00,651
their tax dollars are not being 
allocated in the best way to deliver the

1245
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:01,914
benefits in their real lives to their 
families and their relationships that 

1246
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:06,330
they,
that they could do.

1247
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,610
So to bring it all back to obesity.
What,

1248
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:10,863
what I would like,
and I bet I could say the same about 

1249
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:13,594
you,
is we'd like to take some of these sort 

1250
01:04:16,331 --> 01:04:17,164
of influential videos that we've seen 
done that demonize innocuous drugs like 

1251
01:04:22,991 --> 01:04:23,824
marijuana and put those on sugar.
Put those on how upbeat people are 

1252
01:04:28,751 --> 01:04:29,584
addicted to sugar.
People are addicted to so many things 

1253
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:32,884
that are causing obesity.
So many things that are causing us to 

1254
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,750
have this epidemic of,
you know what I mean?

1255
01:04:37,751 --> 01:04:38,584
If you go to Disneyland,
it's one of the saddest things in the 

1256
01:04:39,971 --> 01:04:40,804
world.
You see how many people are on scooters 

1257
01:04:41,891 --> 01:04:45,400
because they've eaten themselves out of 
their ability to be mobile on their own.

1258
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,760
They're just overflowing out of the,
off the side of these scooters.

1259
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:50,103
It's,
it's very depressing and then you see 

1260
01:04:51,881 --> 01:04:52,511
them,
what they're eating,

1261
01:04:52,511 --> 01:04:57,511
they're drinking slushies and you know,
eating fucking nonsense.

1262
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,680
And this,
this is a,

1263
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:04,930
and again it's another addiction and in 
the availability of it is so,

1264
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:05,823
I mean,
imagine if you were a heroin addict and 

1265
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,313
everywhere you went has heroin.
That's what it's like to be a sugar 

1266
01:05:12,671 --> 01:05:14,140
addict.
If you're a sugar addict,

1267
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:18,160
every store you go into is filled with 
your drug every

1268
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,930
seven 11 right when you go to pay for 
your gas or whatever you're doing,

1269
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:24,190
it's filled with your drug right there 
in front of you,

1270
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:27,940
your drugs everywhere.
And you know,

1271
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:30,220
if,
if you want to do something alternative,

1272
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:31,054
like I've been involved in the Paleo 
Movement for a few years and like my 

1273
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:37,990
girlfriend's Vegan and if you want to 
find good Paleo or Vegan food,

1274
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:38,824
it's like getting a little easier.
But it's not mainstream enough that 

1275
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:48,400
there's like a whole island walmart 
devoted to it and this is a shitty I'll,

1276
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:54,210
yeah,
so I don't know,

1277
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:55,493
the,
the food system is a pretty hard nut to 

1278
01:05:58,331 --> 01:06:02,500
crack because there's an awful lot of 
money at stake and the profit margins on

1279
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:05,110
junk food are very,
very high and it's also,

1280
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:07,150
it's very difficult to keep things on 
the shelf.

1281
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,370
Things go,
I mean if you have real fresh food,

1282
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:10,720
it goes bad very quickly.

1283
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,050
It's natural.
That's what it's supposed to do.

1284
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,050
And Good luck keeping a supermarket 
open.

1285
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:19,240
If you could only keep your vegetables 
for a couple of days.

1286
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,680
Now if there was like long life Kale,
I'd be pretty sad about that.

1287
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,083
But that would be sad.
Like some sort of artificial turf type 

1288
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:33,250
Kale and stuff goes bad quick,
you know,

1289
01:06:33,251 --> 01:06:34,630
it gets funky.
Yeah.

1290
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,270
Um,
but I,

1291
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,760
I'm kind of excited about new 
developments like clean meat,

1292
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,330
lunch meat.
I am too,

1293
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,193
because I think like ethically that'll 
be awesome and we'll see what kind of 

1294
01:06:44,591 --> 01:06:46,390
monsters they make out of that.
Yeah.

1295
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:51,790
It's going to be strange to see headless
meat slabs,

1296
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,460
no central nervous system.
Just grow and,

1297
01:06:55,461 --> 01:06:58,720
and trying to figure out how do they get
it to have like a muscle consistency,

1298
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,870
like a philemon yawn or something.
I mean,

1299
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:02,733
you gotta realize an animal like 
different cuts of meat have a different 

1300
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:07,234
texture to them because there's 
different muscle density because the 

1301
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,290
animals use their body.

1302
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,990
I think you'll have to electrically 
stimulate the muscles issue.

1303
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:18,340
So it kind of has to twitch and it's 
weird,

1304
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:20,470
but,
and people go,

1305
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,850
Oh God,
what did have nerves?

1306
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:24,340
That's disgusting.
People would make the argument then that

1307
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:28,120
it could feel somehow or another in some
neighboring dimension.

1308
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,033
It'll have like fake fake nerves.
What I'm excited about is you could 

1309
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:37,450
potentially have meat that's not just 
from like the top three species.

1310
01:07:37,451 --> 01:07:39,400
You know,
we could eat meat from people's pigs and

1311
01:07:39,401 --> 01:07:40,380
chicken.
Well,

1312
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,020
you can eat people,
Jeffrey.

1313
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:43,413
Well,
one of my edgier tweets was like 

1314
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:47,043
celebrities will start selling pieces of
themselves that can turn into like a 

1315
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:54,230
Ryan gosling stake.
If you don't want,

1316
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,350
encourage that bro.
Trust me,

1317
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:58,090
Brian,
don't go down that road.

1318
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,290
You're too delicious.

1319
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,321
Yeah,
man.

1320
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:03,154
I don't know about all that.
I don't think we should encourage 

1321
01:08:04,601 --> 01:08:07,060
because what if people are delicious?
That could be a real problem.

1322
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:12,070
I think the lab grown people always be 
cheaper than like,

1323
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,710
I don't know about that.
Yeah,

1324
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,633
I bet.
Could buy someone real cheap and some 

1325
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,930
sort of third world country.
Yeah.

1326
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,180
For food.
You know,

1327
01:08:20,181 --> 01:08:22,610
there was a terrible,
not terrible in a bad way,

1328
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,940
but in terms of its revelations a,
there's a documentary piece from vice on

1329
01:08:28,431 --> 01:08:29,264
Liberia.
And one of the things about it was that 

1330
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:34,400
they were selling human meat and that,
uh,

1331
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:37,670
this guy recognized it because he had 
eaten humans before.

1332
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:41,750
And so when there was a stand that was 
selling meat on the side of the road and

1333
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:42,584
he turned them in for selling human meat
and the reason why he knew his cause he 

1334
01:08:46,011 --> 01:08:46,850
had eaten people.

1335
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,110
I'm like,
okay,

1336
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:52,700
when's the next flight out of here?
What the Fuck Cube?

1337
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:53,360
Imagine.
I mean,

1338
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:57,140
if you gave me a piece of lamb and he 
didn't tell me what it was,

1339
01:08:57,141 --> 01:08:58,100
I'd be like,
hmm.

1340
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,630
Not sure.
Do you,

1341
01:08:59,631 --> 01:09:00,464
how many people you have to eat before 
you absolutely know that somethings 

1342
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,640
people like,
fuck man,

1343
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,033
I had a lot of lamp chops,
would not bet 100% on my ability to 

1344
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:14,561
distinguished a lamb chop from say of a 
veal chop or a venison chop.

1345
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:23,010
But all of this stuff is going to create
some real moral quandaries.

1346
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:26,120
Like there'll be this,
uh,

1347
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:28,670
what Jonathan Haidt calls moral 
dumbfounding where you go,

1348
01:09:28,671 --> 01:09:30,020
Yuck.
That is disgusting.

1349
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:32,670
Why?
I Dunno.

1350
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:33,890
It just is.
Yeah.

1351
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,690
I can't give you a reason.
Well,

1352
01:09:35,691 --> 01:09:36,524
robot brothels,
this is one of the more recent 

1353
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:39,254
discussions,
the ethical implications of robot 

1354
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:44,780
brothels and there's a robot brothel 
that's scheduled to be open.

1355
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,400
Where is that in Germany.
Is that where it does?

1356
01:09:46,401 --> 01:09:48,620
I believe,
I believe it is.

1357
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:53,621
And there's all these people were up.
Where's this Texas Holla powerful Texas,

1358
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,410
Texas.
Dex Is,

1359
01:09:57,411 --> 01:09:59,420
you could probably fuck a tiger if 
you've got enough money.

1360
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,703
Countries,
first robot sex brothel set to open in 

1361
01:10:02,841 --> 01:10:04,970
Texas prompts backlash.
See,

1362
01:10:04,971 --> 01:10:05,804
I wonder if that's real or one of they 
just like a hey put out a fucking press 

1363
01:10:09,651 --> 01:10:12,200
conference to tell them we're going to 
open up a robot brothel.

1364
01:10:12,201 --> 01:10:14,150
Let's let them go crazy.
Is Ron White?

1365
01:10:14,151 --> 01:10:15,320
He did it.
Ron.

1366
01:10:15,321 --> 01:10:16,154
When Ron White from his,
from his off from the desk of Rod White 

1367
01:10:19,731 --> 01:10:20,600
it Austin,
Texas.

1368
01:10:20,601 --> 01:10:23,240
He said this email,
60 bucks for a half hour.

1369
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,133
Oh,
that's cheap.

1370
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,420
How long does it take to get off with a 
robot?

1371
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,283
What did you lose your concentration set
locations by 2020 is there a snooze 

1372
01:10:30,111 --> 01:10:33,350
button?
2020 so 18 months.

1373
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:34,903
Yeah,
but see what you don't want to show up 

1374
01:10:36,471 --> 01:10:38,060
late.
Right?

1375
01:10:38,061 --> 01:10:39,470
You don't want to be there at the end of
the day.

1376
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,470
A bunch of unmotivated people cleaning 
out those fuck holes.

1377
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:43,893
Oh well of this was actually at the 
forefront of the lap dance club 

1378
01:10:46,371 --> 01:10:49,250
revolution in the late 80 [inaudible] 
the revolution there was a revolution.

1379
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:49,940
Well,
yeah,

1380
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:50,773
from from old stripper style clubs.
The lap dance where they actually 

1381
01:10:53,781 --> 01:10:55,950
touched you in.
That actually started in the,

1382
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:56,923
in Texas.
So either this is a show room where 

1383
01:10:58,281 --> 01:11:02,630
customers can test and rent dolls before
deciding to purchase one.

1384
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:05,900
Ooh.
He imagine,

1385
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:07,040
you know how like,
uh,

1386
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,620
they have certain cars that had been,
you know,

1387
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,513
on the lot for a while and like,
are you thinking about buying an m for 

1388
01:11:12,591 --> 01:11:14,040
Mike Cologne?
Take the

1389
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,120
sucker for a spin.

1390
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,000
Well,
y'all should read the essay.

1391
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:21,560
My girlfriend Diana Fleischmann wrote 
about sex bots,

1392
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,200
which got her a little bit of notoriety 
a few months ago.

1393
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,280
What was her take on?
It?

1394
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:31,210
Did it would be really good on balance 
because there's a lot of guys who,

1395
01:11:31,281 --> 01:11:35,020
um,
need,

1396
01:11:35,021 --> 01:11:35,854
like a sexual release and if it kind of 
takes them away from doing some like 

1397
01:11:42,191 --> 01:11:46,960
exploiter to bill cosby style behavior 
into just doing something like this,

1398
01:11:46,961 --> 01:11:49,510
which is kind of weird and gross but 
innocuous,

1399
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:52,560
like it's not hurting anybody,
um,

1400
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,860
that,
that would be a net win.

1401
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:57,070
Do you make that connection because 
that,

1402
01:11:57,071 --> 01:11:59,020
that's a,
that's a tricky connection,

1403
01:11:59,021 --> 01:12:02,020
right?
Because most people who think of rape,

1404
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:07,410
they don't think of it as an act of 
arousal or sex or intimacy rather.

1405
01:12:08,651 --> 01:12:11,470
It's a thing of power at some sort of a 
creepy,

1406
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,140
sociopathic,
psychopathic behavior trait.

1407
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,540
I know that's a standard view in gender 
feminism,

1408
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,600
but I don't think it's well supported by
the evidence.

1409
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,310
Um,
for example,

1410
01:12:22,311 --> 01:12:24,110
there's a big problem with rape in 
India,

1411
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:27,170
right?
And Porn as far as I understand,

1412
01:12:27,171 --> 01:12:30,590
is illegal in India now accessible 
though?

1413
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,080
Or is it that you don't,
I don't think it's even like,

1414
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:36,440
I think it's pretty hard to access porn 
websites from India,

1415
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:42,010
but I think if you legalized porn there,
I predict the rate of sexual abuse would

1416
01:12:43,371 --> 01:12:44,510
drop.
Willing.

1417
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,530
Yeah,
I really do.

1418
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:46,843
Boy,
that would be a weird sort of 

1419
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:53,501
experiment.
But the thing about robots and sex is

1420
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:03,190
they're going to get so good that it's 
going to be like a person and then we're

1421
01:13:03,191 --> 01:13:07,240
going to be in this weird x Mokena sort 
of situation where,

1422
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:09,520
um,
how would you feel?

1423
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,413
Like,
what if you were dancing around with 

1424
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:12,234
that really hot Japanese girl,
an x Mokena she starts taking off your 

1425
01:13:15,461 --> 01:13:16,750
clothes.
Like what do we do here?

1426
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,390
Like she feels warm.
She's beautiful.

1427
01:13:19,391 --> 01:13:21,280
She smells good like this.
My,

1428
01:13:21,281 --> 01:13:24,730
all my senses are telling me this is a 
person and she's a good listener.

1429
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:25,400
Yeah,
she's pretty,

1430
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,490
she doesn't Nag you.
She doesn't give a whole Nag.

1431
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:28,840
You owe you man.
He man's planning.

1432
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:29,943
No,
not yet.

1433
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,590
That's my favorite.
If you're correct and you have a penis,

1434
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:35,424
you're a mansplainer.
Gotta be real careful about your 

1435
01:13:37,321 --> 01:13:38,154
information,
the way you distribute it to two ladies 

1436
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:40,404
these days.
It used to be close to words being 

1437
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:44,580
patronizing and you've got this to do it
well.

1438
01:13:44,581 --> 01:13:47,940
It also could be called being correct.
Yeah.

1439
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:48,883
If sometimes you correct it just 
happened to be [inaudible] explaining 

1440
01:13:51,631 --> 01:13:54,090
true things as a crime.
Well,

1441
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:56,370
when it comes to gender studies,
we circle back to this,

1442
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,233
this,
um,

1443
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:01,110
denial of reality.
And we know that there's,

1444
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:06,710
there's this sort of really broad 
spectrum of sexuality in terms of male,

1445
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:09,260
female,
in terms of,

1446
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,340
you know,
in terms of the,

1447
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:12,500
the obvious,
you know,

1448
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:17,140
the rock on one side and Kate Upton on 
the other,

1449
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:17,711
right.
You know,

1450
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:20,290
these Super Uber female,
Uber,

1451
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,450
males.
And then there's all these,

1452
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:24,123
like,
who's the guy who was in the hobbit 

1453
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,660
illogical?
It's that guy he started in this sort of

1454
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:31,180
weird space in between the two of those 
people,

1455
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,590
right?
And draw in this hobby.

1456
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,300
Well,
he's not really androgynous,

1457
01:14:34,301 --> 01:14:37,540
but in terms of like,
you compare him to,

1458
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:39,340
you know,
fill in the blank,

1459
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:41,440
Herschel Walker,
it's not that manly,

1460
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,510
you know?
And then there's,

1461
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:44,373
there's women that don't feel 
represented by these standard views of 

1462
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:49,563
female sexuality as well.
But this just speak to the variability 

1463
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:55,270
of the human genome and it just,
it just DNA in general.

1464
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:56,104
There's different people that breed with
different people in different shapes 

1465
01:14:58,931 --> 01:15:01,240
come out until we figured out how to 
manipulate those shapes,

1466
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:05,470
which seems to be right around the 
corner with the robot fuck dolls.

1467
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,333
It seems like they're both gonna arrive 
probably at the same time where you're 

1468
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:10,870
going to be able to choose from,
you know,

1469
01:15:10,871 --> 01:15:12,970
having sex with a robot or having sex 
with the hulk.

1470
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,013
Like there's going to be real 
possibilities that everyone's going to 

1471
01:15:16,301 --> 01:15:17,800
look like thor.
I mean,

1472
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,110
this seems like this is not too far 
away.

1473
01:15:20,111 --> 01:15:21,010
One,
two,

1474
01:15:21,011 --> 01:15:21,844
three generations maybe,
possibly inside of our lifetime will 

1475
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:25,414
have mastered the human form to the 
point where the world's going to be 

1476
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:29,764
preposterous and it's going to be like 
the Star Wars Cantina scene everywhere 

1477
01:15:31,901 --> 01:15:33,130
you go,
oh yeah,

1478
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:34,413
well this is what happens whenever you 
have a biological innovation that opens 

1479
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:41,890
up new possibilities in terms of the 
evolution of bodies or behaviors.

1480
01:15:41,891 --> 01:15:46,540
As you get this adaptive radiation,
this explosion of possibilities like the

1481
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,430
Cambrian explosion,
right?

1482
01:15:48,431 --> 01:15:49,264
530 million years ago,
animals finally figured out how do you 

1483
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:54,903
program a multicellular body with a 
nervous system and as soon as they got 

1484
01:15:58,781 --> 01:16:01,450
that boom,
you've got all this,

1485
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:04,360
these bizarre new forms,
and then you get,

1486
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,190
you know,
dinosaurs and mammals in us.

1487
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:08,223
I think once we can program the human 
genome and you have parents who are 

1488
01:16:12,431 --> 01:16:14,440
like,
I want,

1489
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:19,470
I want to select for kids who were like 
really tall and really religious,

1490
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,590
right?
And other parents are like,

1491
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,513
I want cute little hobbit babies who are
like hardcore atheist with furry feet 

1492
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,910
and then you'll,
you'll get a divergence.

1493
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:33,130
Imagine if your parents decided to make 
you a Hobbit,

1494
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,750
like they could have done anything they 
want.

1495
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,043
Remember like the first early adopters,
I imagine it's going to be about fetal 

1496
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:40,743
transformation,
about taking something that's in the 

1497
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:43,864
womb and manipulating it,
and then as it emerges and evolves and 

1498
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:49,780
grows,
then you're gonna see what it is.

1499
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:50,763
If you fucking parents were just 
gigantic Jrr tolkien fans and you have 

1500
01:16:55,121 --> 01:16:57,340
heard furry feet and two feet tall,
you're like,

1501
01:16:57,341 --> 01:17:00,280
what the fuck mom?
Like you asshole.

1502
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:04,120
I just wanted a hobbit.
I did want to pay me like who's either a

1503
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:06,340
hobbit or a cave troll,
so you should call your boss.

1504
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,920
Yeah,
that's entirely possible.

1505
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,963
I think the,
I think the sex bots will come a lot 

1506
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:13,760
quicker.
Yeah.

1507
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:16,820
I think we're going away.
What do we look like?

1508
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,520
What do we look like right now in terms 
of sex bots?

1509
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:22,550
What are we looking at?
Let's say state of the art type?

1510
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:23,384
Google state of the art sex robot 
started talking to and see what they 

1511
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:28,910
have there in Texas.
I think they look pretty good,

1512
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,350
but they're not.
They're not good at.

1513
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:31,184
We're good at like language or 
conversation with eye contact or 

1514
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,053
handjobs movement or whatever,
but I think there will be this tipping 

1515
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:42,920
point where they can do conversation.
That's good enough.

1516
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,073
Right.
It doesn't have to be quite as smart as 

1517
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:51,500
an actual lover,
but it can be a hell of a lot nicer than

1518
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:52,334
an actual lover.
It can have better memory for all your 

1519
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:54,914
preferences and your desires and your 
and like it will also be more trainable 

1520
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:00,704
in terms of it'll kind of register.
Oh the last time I asked this question 

1521
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,193
like you didn't respond much,
but this other question you talked for 

1522
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:11,090
five minutes.
I'll ask more of that.

1523
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,493
Mm.
Right.

1524
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:16,370
This is all very problematic behavior 
discussing here Jeffrey.

1525
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:20,990
Well like your tone,
trainable.

1526
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:22,753
Well my girlfriends,
sometimes people are nice when you're 

1527
01:18:24,861 --> 01:18:25,880
nice to them.
Jeffrey,

1528
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:26,990
how about you?
Be Nice.

1529
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:31,820
First set of expecting this fucking 
robot to just take care of your Dick and

1530
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:32,654
balls and just be nice to you all the 
time and remember all the stuff you 

1531
01:18:35,271 --> 01:18:36,260
like.
What about it?

1532
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,680
He would develop into total narcissist,
sociopath with robots that we could just

1533
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,720
get to do whatever we want.
We bring them to the mall on a leash.

1534
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:46,543
Well,
so there are two different ways I could 

1535
01:18:47,721 --> 01:18:48,320
go.
Right,

1536
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,550
right.
On the one hand,

1537
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,990
like if there's a woman I'm interested 
in let's say,

1538
01:18:53,991 --> 01:18:54,824
and she has access to a male sex bot 
who's like really funny cause it's like 

1539
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:05,470
it's a little neural network has learned
like all of your standup routines or um,

1540
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:08,930
how to,
how to riff on today's news and,

1541
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:09,913
and it's a great listener and it 
remembers everything about her 

1542
01:19:13,011 --> 01:19:16,140
backstory.
I can either be like,

1543
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:20,840
I can't compete with that.
I'll have to dis it.

1544
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:21,883
I'll have to say you're not allowed to 
see him anymore or all have to level up 

1545
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,150
and be better.
Yes.

1546
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:34,190
Well like,
like humans and I,

1547
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:38,630
I hope people will level up and I'm well
yeah.

1548
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,673
And we'll get to see,
we'll learn from the people don't level 

1549
01:19:41,871 --> 01:19:42,704
up like how they fall apart.
I present you with an even more 

1550
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:46,490
disturbing scenario.

1551
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:48,223
Okay.

1552
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:49,123
Some people will be like,
you know that Jeffrey Miller is a 

1553
01:19:50,361 --> 01:19:51,194
handsome guy.
I like to fuck them all the time and 

1554
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:56,720
they gonna make a version of you and 
bring it around the mall with a leash on

1555
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:00,260
and you're going to be going to the 
apple store and a version of you.

1556
01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:01,094
It was going to be kicked and come with 
a dog collar on standing right next to 

1557
01:20:07,771 --> 01:20:08,250
you

1558
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,990
while you're buying a new Mac book.
And you're like,

1559
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:12,650
what the fuck?
And it's going to be totally legit cause

1560
01:20:12,651 --> 01:20:14,070
you don't look at,
Oh whoa.

1561
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,290
That's what it looked like.
Swappable face.

1562
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,570
Let me see what it looks like though.
This is just,

1563
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:19,583
this is,
this is like when you're looking at one 

1564
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:24,750
of them digital renderings of a house 
they haven't built yet.

1565
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,710
Let's see what we got here.
Pouch.

1566
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,150
Are they warm?
Whoa.

1567
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:34,710
The all these closeups or creeped me 
out.

1568
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:38,220
Come on.
Get Ai.

1569
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:40,020
It's Howard Stern.
Hey,

1570
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,820
leave this.
Oh that's creepy.

1571
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:44,880
They haven't passed the uncanny valley.
Clearly that,

1572
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,740
yeah,
it was hairy chest.

1573
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:47,700
What the fuck?
Oh,

1574
01:20:47,701 --> 01:20:49,230
it's a guy.
Robot video.

1575
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:51,370
A long video.
Yeah.

1576
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:55,890
I mean people will do like celebrity,
deep fake sex bots on,

1577
01:20:55,891 --> 01:20:59,610
there will be people wandering around 
with their Jordan Peterson Sax bought on

1578
01:20:59,611 --> 01:21:02,760
a leash and the store will have you seen
the porn where they do face swaps.

1579
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:05,190
That's,
that's getting really good.

1580
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:06,323
They're really good at that.
Now this is another social revolution 

1581
01:21:08,611 --> 01:21:09,444
we're going to have to brace for as an 
Arrow when you can do a credible porn 

1582
01:21:13,021 --> 01:21:16,740
fake of any celebrity or any citizen.
Yeah,

1583
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:17,813
just based on like sampling their 
facebook photos or do you know who kyle 

1584
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:21,714
done again is hilarious.
Standup comedian who has the funniest 

1585
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:31,161
instagram page of all time and his 
instagram page is about 80% of him doing

1586
01:21:32,011 --> 01:21:32,844
face swap videos of the Kardashians and 
president trump and Kanye west and with 

1587
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:38,123
it just so fucking ridiculous because 
you know that they're fake because it's 

1588
01:21:41,821 --> 01:21:42,654
real obvious that they fake,
but it's essentially like a new art 

1589
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:45,924
form.
If you think of like sketch comedy and 

1590
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:49,530
here play one forum,
see what we got here.

1591
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,393
This is a good one.

1592
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:51,930
Yeah.
Big Job.

1593
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:55,260
What I do know when I was at your tiny 
White House,

1594
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:57,170
I put a recorder in the chat.
Yeah,

1595
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:58,070
yeah,
she'd be,

1596
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:59,030
yeah,
yeah.

1597
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:00,890
Holy Shit.
Another day.

1598
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:06,540
Yeah,
the bathroom,

1599
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,920
the House we had,
oh by God,

1600
01:22:10,921 --> 01:22:14,040
she's got the weirdest ass,
but also sorta terrific.

1601
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:17,000
Esoteric a been a spell speller.
Chair.

1602
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,580
Hello.
Some information here.

1603
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:21,983
Okay.
She had a bell a little bit about an 

1604
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,390
hour and a half ago.
That's what we had tech,

1605
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:28,080
but totally datcher that she's on her 
period.

1606
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:29,730
Light flow day,
maybe day three.

1607
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,650
God,
yeah.

1608
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,360
Yeah.
That dead chicken by buddy lilly.

1609
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:37,170
He's realistic though.
Died.

1610
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:43,110
We just tried to open up this shit.
Paid bottle.

1611
01:22:43,111 --> 01:22:44,970
Just celebrate by retruded coby.

1612
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:52,303
So this kind of stuff,
but see what I love about this is it's 

1613
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,720
so obvious.
You know,

1614
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:57,410
it's,
it's,

1615
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:58,243
this is essentially,
I mean most he has them out of the 

1616
01:22:59,991 --> 01:23:02,000
little sketches that he does on his 
instagram page,

1617
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,770
but most of his stuff is this face 
thing,

1618
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,240
which is,
I mean,

1619
01:23:07,241 --> 01:23:08,074
relatively new technology.
When one was face swap invented less 

1620
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:12,860
than a decade ago or so on your phone.
Yeah,

1621
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:14,170
that good.
Pretty soon,

1622
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:19,171
just a few years,
and it's become this new form of comedy,

1623
01:23:19,391 --> 01:23:20,650
of sketch comedy,
you know,

1624
01:23:20,651 --> 01:23:24,190
and and with a guy like him,
he was such a good impressionist,

1625
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:25,863
you know,
but this is crude and obvious and how 

1626
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:32,350
long is it going to be before someone 
can actually,

1627
01:23:32,351 --> 01:23:36,640
I mean they already have that machine 
that a lot of the technology that allows

1628
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:37,474
you to take,
especially someone like me who's talked 

1629
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:41,740
for countless hours,
you take your voice,

1630
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:44,630
you take all of the recordings that I've
ever done,

1631
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:49,120
this more than a thousand podcasts.
You throw them into this machine and you

1632
01:23:49,121 --> 01:23:51,550
basically have all my various 
inflections,

1633
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,590
anger,
sadness,

1634
01:23:53,591 --> 01:23:57,820
laughter or giddiness,
perplexed,

1635
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:00,580
all the different words that I have in 
my vernacular,

1636
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:04,660
and you put them all into this thing and
you can kind of morph it around.

1637
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:09,160
It's photoshop for voice,
so you have the video where you can face

1638
01:24:09,161 --> 01:24:09,994
swap and manipulate people's images and 
it's getting better and federal at the 

1639
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:13,990
time.
Then you have photoshop for voice.

1640
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,033
You can essentially make movies with 
people where they just do whatever you 

1641
01:24:17,741 --> 01:24:18,580
want them to do.

1642
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,360
Yeah.
It'll be pretty soon,

1643
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:26,430
totally impossible to tell a fake audio 
recording from real and yeah.

1644
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:31,520
And then fake video from real.
And what do we do then?

1645
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:37,220
It means we can't really trust digital 
records of people in the same way.

1646
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:41,160
Um,
it also means you can,

1647
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:44,010
I don't know,
it might be good.

1648
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:44,844
I mean,
it means you can digitally sample 

1649
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:51,030
anybody who's a good communicator and 
they can do an unlimited number of,

1650
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,390
I mean,
you could have David Attenborough,

1651
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:56,910
you know,
natural history videos forever,

1652
01:24:56,911 --> 01:24:57,810
even after he's dead.

1653
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:58,893
Right.
But he could also be doing Nazi 

1654
01:25:00,071 --> 01:25:02,120
propaganda videos as well.
Yeah.

1655
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:04,930
That's what's really weird.
You could essentially,

1656
01:25:04,931 --> 01:25:06,550
it would be up to the user.
Yeah.

1657
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:07,593
So someone like kyle done again,
but an evil version could take David 

1658
01:25:11,171 --> 01:25:13,540
attenborough and,
you know,

1659
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,280
yeah.
You can do whatever you want.

1660
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:18,223
Well,
almost like what we're saying about 

1661
01:25:19,141 --> 01:25:23,880
communication that you,
this open floodgate of communication.

1662
01:25:23,881 --> 01:25:26,430
We're learning how to manage all the 
implications of this.

1663
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:28,080
It's really recent.
Yeah.

1664
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:30,330
And I think with,
um,

1665
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:33,420
human relationships,
you know,

1666
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:35,430
we'll have to figure out kind of 
ethically

1667
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:37,983
once,
let's say once somebody can make like a 

1668
01:25:41,051 --> 01:25:45,400
deep fake video porn of their ex lover.
Right.

1669
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,473
Right.
And then the wife wife catches them 

1670
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,060
watching it.
Right.

1671
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:50,710
Okay.
Or,

1672
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:53,980
um,
you know,

1673
01:25:53,981 --> 01:25:57,550
the wife buys a sex Bot and it's like 
keeps it at work.

1674
01:25:57,710 --> 01:25:59,080
Okay.
Like

1675
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:03,010
she didn't come home from work 
exhausted,

1676
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,070
all busted

1677
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,220
up and like,
I just want to watch ozark.

1678
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,353
I don't want to hear anyone talk to you.
One of her shoes broken fucking 

1679
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:13,580
happened.
Yeah.

1680
01:26:13,581 --> 01:26:14,660
Is that cheating?
Yeah.

1681
01:26:14,661 --> 01:26:17,060
Some people think that,
I mean,

1682
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:19,400
some people think looking at porn is 
cheating.

1683
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:21,500
There's that argument.
I mean there's,

1684
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:25,670
people have standards vary varying 
levels of standards

1685
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:29,540
and they don't negotiate it.
They don't talk about it.

1686
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:32,720
This is something my friend David Ley 
points out in his book,

1687
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:34,460
um,
ethical porn for decks,

1688
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,480
which is about responsible porn 
viewership for men.

1689
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:39,710
Hmm.
That,

1690
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:43,190
like if you're in a relationship with a 
woman and you're a straight guy,

1691
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:47,570
you need to have the talk about what is 
your girlfriend.

1692
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:51,440
Consider cheating in terms of porn 
watching.

1693
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,860
Most guys don't have the guts to have 
that conversation.

1694
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:56,900
Most women don't either.
And then

1695
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:59,260
there is it the guts or you don't want 
to open up that door.

1696
01:26:59,261 --> 01:27:03,280
It just keep it on the sneak tip.
She can't complain and then no one knows

1697
01:27:03,281 --> 01:27:05,530
nothing.
And then we're all good.

1698
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,573
Everybody finds out yes and mile and you
go to the movies and y'all hold hands 

1699
01:27:09,671 --> 01:27:14,590
Jeffrey and everything's fine and he 
keeps push the secrets to the grave.

1700
01:27:14,591 --> 01:27:15,424
Shut down into the why you're watching 
that Romcom you think of someone with a 

1701
01:27:17,861 --> 01:27:22,861
ball gag tied up in a basement covered 
in baby oil,

1702
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:26,260
right?
Yeah.

1703
01:27:26,261 --> 01:27:28,960
Some people into a happy place.
I'll have to go there.

1704
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,760
You got to go there all day sometimes.

1705
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,353
Yeah.
So the people have to talk about this 

1706
01:27:33,951 --> 01:27:35,660
stuff like that,
like grownups.

1707
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:41,230
And as the technology keeps advancing,
right and becomes more and more,

1708
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:46,100
you know,
the line between like

1709
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:49,593
porn and real life gets fuzzier.
And fuzzier right with robots and 

1710
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,820
virtual reality is going to be very 
strange.

1711
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:58,933
I think that probably what's going to 
happen is there's going to be some sort 

1712
01:28:01,751 --> 01:28:06,751
of a merger between virtual reality and 
robots like that would be like the,

1713
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:07,953
the real ultimate brothel.
So you wouldn't be as confused by the 

1714
01:28:14,681 --> 01:28:15,514
uncanny valley because there's so much 
closer in a visual sense of replicating 

1715
01:28:19,151 --> 01:28:19,984
that.
I'm sure you've seen like some of the 

1716
01:28:21,371 --> 01:28:22,204
more recent video games like God of war 
and a bunch of these like really high 

1717
01:28:25,061 --> 01:28:28,030
end games.
The graphics are so intense,

1718
01:28:28,031 --> 01:28:30,160
especially in the um,
you know,

1719
01:28:30,161 --> 01:28:32,660
the little scenes that they do,
whether they're there,

1720
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,080
have promo clips and stuff.
He looked at it like,

1721
01:28:35,081 --> 01:28:37,950
is this real end game video that I'm 
looking at these,

1722
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:40,210
this is insane.
It looks like I'm watching a movie.

1723
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:41,283
Yeah.
That this in combination like some sort 

1724
01:28:43,841 --> 01:28:48,841
of real four k age d virtual reality in 
combination with a sex robot is probably

1725
01:28:50,411 --> 01:28:51,310
where people are going to go.

1726
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:53,293
Yeah,
I think so.

1727
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:57,290
Um,
and then the other question is like what

1728
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:58,124
happens with that technology in terms of
education and college and how people 

1729
01:29:01,441 --> 01:29:04,830
acquire skills and knowledge and 
insight?

1730
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:06,540
Um,
it's really,

1731
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:10,860
really hard to imagine that people still
think in 15 years.

1732
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:11,694
Okay.
Going to a physical classroom and 

1733
01:29:12,991 --> 01:29:14,310
sitting,
you know,

1734
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:15,263
listening to the average community 
college like adjunct professor talking 

1735
01:29:20,641 --> 01:29:21,474
about human sexuality or gender feminism
or political science that they'll think 

1736
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:28,950
that's a state of the art.
That's the way we should do that.

1737
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:33,210
And,
and then what happens?

1738
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:38,300
I mean it seems kind of unlikely that 
university is,

1739
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:40,554
as we know them,
will keep existing in anything close to 

1740
01:29:43,351 --> 01:29:47,670
their current form.
And yet no one's talking about this.

1741
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,340
Um,
uh,

1742
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:51,563
like I wouldn't be that surprised if 
half the universities in America go 

1743
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:55,830
bankrupt within 15,
20 years.

1744
01:29:56,510 --> 01:29:59,450
So do you think that people are going to
be getting their education and some sort

1745
01:29:59,451 --> 01:30:00,284
of an online form,
some sort of virtual classroom form or 

1746
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:07,400
some maybe new,
not yet created version,

1747
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:11,450
some new virtual reality form that's a 
lot more interactive?

1748
01:30:11,451 --> 01:30:15,260
I don't think it will be just watching 
videos and then taking quizzes.

1749
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:16,183
Have you paid attention to what Elon 
Musk has been saying about as neuro 

1750
01:30:18,861 --> 01:30:20,900
link?
A bit.

1751
01:30:20,901 --> 01:30:21,734
Yeah.
Yeah.

1752
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,573
Yeah.
What do you think about what you've 

1753
01:30:23,421 --> 01:30:26,600
heard so far?
I think it will be very,

1754
01:30:26,601 --> 01:30:29,570
very hard technically to do that.
Um,

1755
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:31,940
but what,
what do you know about it?

1756
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:33,223
Um,
if you could explain it to people that 

1757
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:37,790
don't know what we're talking about,
if I understand correctly,

1758
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:40,910
having watched like you interview Ilan,
et Cetera.

1759
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:41,993
Um,
he's just concerned that the bandwidth 

1760
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:44,954
that connects the brain to the world or 
the brain to the Internet is quite 

1761
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:49,633
narrow.
Like you can get a lot of information 

1762
01:30:51,441 --> 01:30:52,274
quickly through your eyes and ears,
but your speed of like typing and 

1763
01:30:55,251 --> 01:30:58,150
controlling things is,
we're speaking is,

1764
01:30:58,151 --> 01:30:59,210
is kind of limited.

1765
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:01,093
So I think there's a push to kind of 
open up that that bandwidth and the 

1766
01:31:06,471 --> 01:31:07,304
speed of communication between the human
brain and digital reality and other 

1767
01:31:11,691 --> 01:31:15,380
people,
if they figured out a way to do that,

1768
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:18,860
it's a total game changer.
Um,

1769
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,173
in terms of how people interact with not
just social media but in general with 

1770
01:31:26,121 --> 01:31:26,954
each other.
I mean it means basically you have a 

1771
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:34,480
global telepathy system if you want and 
then everything changes because it means

1772
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,393
the ease with which one part of my brain
communicates with another part isn't 

1773
01:31:44,721 --> 01:31:45,554
that much higher than the ease with 
which that part communicates with 

1774
01:31:47,751 --> 01:31:50,570
somebody else's other brain part.

1775
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:52,973
What I've been thinking about is some 
sort of universal language in that if 

1776
01:31:55,591 --> 01:31:56,424
that's,
if they bridge the gap between cultures 

1777
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:01,294
and civilizations and w the way people 
communicate and doing so do it through 

1778
01:32:04,931 --> 01:32:05,764
some sort of a digital interface and 
instead of like very simple characters 

1779
01:32:08,831 --> 01:32:09,664
that equal words that you put into your 
linguistic disc dictionary and you have 

1780
01:32:14,141 --> 01:32:15,850
an understanding of what this person's 
talking about.

1781
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:18,700
Instead of that you get like real clear 
concepts,

1782
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:19,534
maybe even like an Emoji form or 
hieroglyphic form or some sort of form 

1783
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,833
where we figure out over x amount of 
years how to communicate through agreed 

1784
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:32,134
upon imagery or agreed upon data in some
sort of a way that it lets people 

1785
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:41,341
express emotions and perhaps even more 
engrossing and more complicated than the

1786
01:32:44,711 --> 01:32:46,660
actual language that we're enjoying 
right now.

1787
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:47,710
Yeah,
it'll,

1788
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:48,543
it'll be amazing.
I mean the evolutionary backstory to 

1789
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:51,791
this,
right,

1790
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:54,670
as you basically have the whole history 
of life on earth,

1791
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,313
you know,
before humans invent language where 

1792
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:03,160
animal communication is pretty 
primitive.

1793
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:04,023
Like all you really have at the most 
complicated as like nightingale's 

1794
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:10,570
producing complicated bird song to track
mates.

1795
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:12,210
That's about as much as you get.

1796
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,153
What about like chimps that have certain
sounds for tigers and other sounds for 

1797
01:33:16,071 --> 01:33:16,890
eagles

1798
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:19,780
that have like a maximum of maybe a 
dozen different sounds.

1799
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:21,083
Um,
but with human language it compared to 

1800
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:24,964
that,
it really is suddenly like having 

1801
01:33:26,261 --> 01:33:29,260
telepathy where you can communicate so 
much,

1802
01:33:29,261 --> 01:33:32,170
so quickly,
so efficiently and yet,

1803
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:35,310
um,
you know,

1804
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:36,153
of neuro link works,
it would be as far in advance of 

1805
01:33:39,221 --> 01:33:42,520
language as languages of kind of animal 
signaling.

1806
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,070
Whoa.
And it's hard.

1807
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:49,630
It's hard to imagine what that world 
looks like because

1808
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:51,340
yeah.

1809
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:55,870
You know,
imagine a form of twitter where it's not

1810
01:33:55,871 --> 01:33:58,630
just through your,
you know,

1811
01:33:58,631 --> 01:34:03,070
your thumbs on a key pad,
but it's a direct brain interface.

1812
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:05,733
And then when people,
it's not just saying something mean or 

1813
01:34:09,581 --> 01:34:11,850
stupid,
it's even thinking something meaner,

1814
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,750
stupid that could immediately get 
posted.

1815
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,193
And once you kind of start sharing your 
whole subconscious with people through 

1816
01:34:24,341 --> 01:34:28,180
neurolink,
then well,

1817
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,113
you know,
we'll have to level up with some new 

1818
01:34:29,971 --> 01:34:30,804
social norms about what,
what that means and sort of how much 

1819
01:34:34,831 --> 01:34:37,410
radical honesty we can take from each 
other.

1820
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:43,280
That seems to be where the future is.
The complete desolving of all boundaries

1821
01:34:45,691 --> 01:34:50,691
between people and information people 
and their lives and that some sort of a,

1822
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:53,903
uh,
a way of recording your actual 

1823
01:34:55,621 --> 01:34:59,780
experiences or letting people share them
in real time.

1824
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:00,793
Like imagine if people decided to let 
people through some virtual reality 

1825
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:09,620
scenario put on headsets and experience.
You are having sex with your girlfriend.

1826
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:10,701
You say,
hey,

1827
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:13,220
we're going to fuck on periscope.
Come on,

1828
01:35:13,221 --> 01:35:14,054
join in.
And everybody just puts on their neuro 

1829
01:35:16,821 --> 01:35:17,654
link and their augmented reality headset
and they put on their haptic feedback 

1830
01:35:21,471 --> 01:35:22,880
suit,
which is,

1831
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:24,830
you know,
now and you know,

1832
01:35:24,831 --> 01:35:27,140
like iphone 10 level,
you know,

1833
01:35:27,141 --> 01:35:28,970
you'd go back to iphone once,
piece of shit,

1834
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:31,730
haptic feedback,
10,

1835
01:35:31,731 --> 01:35:34,520
it's going to be incredible.
It's going to be silky smooth.

1836
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:35,354
It's going to feel like real touch and 
they're going to be able to have sex 

1837
01:35:38,601 --> 01:35:41,180
along with you.
You can have a digital orgy.

1838
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:46,410
Yeah.
I think that's coming within 50 years.

1839
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:47,363
Maybe earlier.

1840
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:50,430
That's a very conservative guess.
Yeah.

1841
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,590
100% is come up there.
There it is.

1842
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:54,150
Jesus Christ.
Jamie,

1843
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,660
there's a haptic feedback system looking
around in there.

1844
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:58,980
What is this?
It?

1845
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:02,100
Oh this couple sexy as fuck to take your
clothes off folks.

1846
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:04,920
Why are you wearing these goofy outfits?
Pretend you superheroes.

1847
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:07,200
What do you,
uh,

1848
01:36:07,230 --> 01:36:09,720
what are these things for?
Climate control systems,

1849
01:36:09,721 --> 01:36:14,190
biometric systems,
motion capture and avatar system.

1850
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:15,590
Boy,
we're fucked.

1851
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:18,210
Jeffrey Vr,
ar and Mr.

1852
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:21,120
So this is all happening while we're 
chit chatting about it,

1853
01:36:21,121 --> 01:36:22,410
these people have already engineered it

1854
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:26,160
and society is going to be totally 
blindsided by this.

1855
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:28,050
Yeah,
cause everybody thinks,

1856
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:28,913
oh well I saw it on Black Mirror but I 
know that it's not even my like so I 

1857
01:36:33,001 --> 01:36:35,060
don't have to worry about it and 
minoration yet,

1858
01:36:35,061 --> 01:36:37,680
cause it's only science fiction.
Like

1859
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:39,583
you said,
something on Sam Harris has show that 

1860
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:43,280
gave me a little bit of hope that turned
out to not be true.

1861
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:44,503
Okay.
He sits up that you were talking about 

1862
01:36:45,681 --> 01:36:48,890
asteroids about our ability to recognize
asteroids and,

1863
01:36:48,891 --> 01:36:51,020
and stop the impact.
Nope.

1864
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:54,350
According to Neil degrasse Tyson,
we need at least 10 years.

1865
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:55,723
We need to know that they're 10 years,
they're going to hit in 10 years and 

1866
01:36:57,711 --> 01:37:01,400
then maybe we could do something that's 
not comforting,

1867
01:37:01,401 --> 01:37:01,800
isn't it?

1868
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:02,850
Well.
Okay,

1869
01:37:02,851 --> 01:37:03,684
here's the thing.
It would be really good to invest at 

1870
01:37:06,901 --> 01:37:11,901
least a few tens of billions of dollars 
in doing that for sure as insurance,

1871
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:13,643
but like the probability of a 
significant asteroid impact within the 

1872
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:20,490
next century is pretty low.
If I understand it correctly.

1873
01:37:20,730 --> 01:37:21,720
I think he's just guesswork.

1874
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:25,240
Does motherfuckers just whizz by all the
time?

1875
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:26,493
Yeah,
it's the probability of us getting hit 

1876
01:37:31,331 --> 01:37:33,040
eventually is 100%

1877
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:34,003
yeah,
it'll happen probably in a few million 

1878
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:38,310
years,
but,

1879
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:40,560
but why do you say that?
Is that to make yourself feel better?

1880
01:37:40,561 --> 01:37:41,910
I'll be long gone.

1881
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,420
It'll be my great quick,
quick,

1882
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,841
quick,
quick,

1883
01:37:43,841 --> 01:37:44,450
quick,
quick,

1884
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:44,871
quick,
quick,

1885
01:37:44,871 --> 01:37:45,291
quick,
quick,

1886
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:45,711
quick,
quick.

1887
01:37:45,711 --> 01:37:46,311
Great.
Great,

1888
01:37:46,311 --> 01:37:47,144
great.
Great grandchildren have to worry about 

1889
01:37:48,381 --> 01:37:48,831
that.
Well,

1890
01:37:48,831 --> 01:37:50,150
you got to play the odds,
right?

1891
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:52,190
I mean we could,
we,

1892
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:53,173
we could be exterminated by a gamma ray 
burst from like a Supernova at any time 

1893
01:37:57,530 --> 01:38:01,080
with zero with no warning.
But it's pretty unlikely.

1894
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:05,370
And it hasn't happened before in the 
history of life on earth.

1895
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,950
Right.
But it happens constantly.

1896
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:09,263
All throughout the universe.
There was a documentary I watched once 

1897
01:38:11,611 --> 01:38:12,444
the freak me the fuck out.
It was all about hyper Novas and they 

1898
01:38:16,381 --> 01:38:17,214
were talking about when they first 
started discovering them that they were 

1899
01:38:18,661 --> 01:38:23,661
really actually concerned that there was
a war going on in space.

1900
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:27,120
And then they,
they recognize that all these explosions

1901
01:38:27,121 --> 01:38:27,954
were happening all day long and they 
thought there was a war going on in the 

1902
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:31,764
cosmos,
which is really fascinating because I 

1903
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:34,554
think this is like when they just got,
I want to say it as a sixties and they 

1904
01:38:37,861 --> 01:38:40,080
discovered this.
Does that make sense?

1905
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:41,643
In a way,
it's kind of surprising that we haven't 

1906
01:38:42,821 --> 01:38:46,330
seen evidence of that happening already.
Right.

1907
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:47,970
I mean,
when,

1908
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:50,350
when I wrote my piece about the Fermi 
Paradox,

1909
01:38:50,351 --> 01:38:53,170
which is why don't we have evidence of 
aliens already?

1910
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:55,690
My solution was basically,
well,

1911
01:38:56,230 --> 01:39:00,190
most species that are intelligent,
that invent technology get wrapped up in

1912
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:01,953
video games and virtual reality and sex 
technology and it just distracts them 

1913
01:39:06,581 --> 01:39:11,581
and they kind of dropped the ball on 
staying alive and exploring anything.

1914
01:39:12,041 --> 01:39:13,670
And,
um,

1915
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:17,260
I think it's still quite likely that 
that happens to most intelligent species

1916
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:20,200
that they just kind of disappear up 
their own buttholes

1917
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:21,983
yeah.
Or they create some sort of an 

1918
01:39:22,981 --> 01:39:23,814
artificial life form that's far more 
advanced than anything that it's 

1919
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:29,250
biological and has no desire,
need or,

1920
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,230
uh,
no instincts to reproduce.

1921
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,070
And if you,
if we see,

1922
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:33,471
I mean,
I've,

1923
01:39:33,471 --> 01:39:34,304
I've said this to many times that I 
think that we are essentially some sort 

1924
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:40,750
of a,
some sort of,

1925
01:39:40,751 --> 01:39:41,584
uh,
electronic caterpillar that gives birth 

1926
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:47,670
to a technological butterfly.
And we're making a coon right now.

1927
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:48,533
We don't know what we're doing.
And we're about to create artificial 

1928
01:39:50,221 --> 01:39:51,054
life.
And then we're doing it through our 

1929
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:56,120
intense desire for innovation.
Constantly want newer,

1930
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:57,023
better things,
whether it's televisions and cars or 

1931
01:39:58,891 --> 01:40:00,780
phones were never like that.
This one's perfect.

1932
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:02,520
Let's just stop here.
Never.

1933
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:05,730
The desire is always towards every,
you know,

1934
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,520
fill in the time period.
We want a new version,

1935
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:11,460
a better version with improvements.
And we keep getting those.

1936
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:16,760
And this is what fuels in many ways,
it fuels our desire for me.

1937
01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:19,050
Materialism,
materialism.

1938
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:22,980
IMBA is embodied by technological 
innovation.

1939
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:26,340
I mean what you're always wanting when 
you get past jewels,

1940
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:29,010
you always want the newest,
greatest innovations.

1941
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:30,203
Yeah.

1942
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:35,100
I think at a certain point humanity's 
going to have to bite the bullet and say

1943
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:39,510
we should plan which innovations come 
first,

1944
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:40,403
what happens next.
And we might even have to have like 

1945
01:40:42,931 --> 01:40:47,931
regulation or social taboos that say we 
really shouldn't go down that path until

1946
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:50,603
we do this other thing first.
That makes us ready to do that thing in 

1947
01:40:54,761 --> 01:40:56,740
a safer,
more rational,

1948
01:40:56,741 --> 01:40:57,290
more ethical.

1949
01:40:57,290 --> 01:40:58,250
Yeah.
But that's the big word,

1950
01:40:58,251 --> 01:40:59,084
right?
Rational like we're not really rational 

1951
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:01,993
and competition,
especially when it's a dealing with 

1952
01:41:04,941 --> 01:41:05,774
different countries that have different 
human rights laws and standards of 

1953
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:09,613
behavior and thinking,
well this is a problem with regulating 

1954
01:41:12,681 --> 01:41:16,730
like artificial intelligence is how'd 
you get China to play ball?

1955
01:41:17,090 --> 01:41:19,160
That was going to say China,
I didn't want to seem racist.

1956
01:41:20,570 --> 01:41:22,840
Well they're going to do it.
And Russia too.

1957
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,050
I mean I'm already doing it.

1958
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:25,013
China's a threat because they are smart 
and organized and future oriented and 

1959
01:41:28,261 --> 01:41:29,850
they can do long term planning and

1960
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:32,540
technologically they're incredibly 
advanced.

1961
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:33,681
I mean,
so,

1962
01:41:33,681 --> 01:41:35,030
so far advanced.
So we're,

1963
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:39,110
or this government rather it's trying to
keep the best phones from China,

1964
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:40,220
from getting to America.

1965
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:43,710
Yeah.

1966
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:44,543
Yeah.
I mean Huawei probably has some pretty 

1967
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,730
close links to the Chinese millage.

1968
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:51,670
It does,
right?

1969
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,593
Yeah.
It does.

1970
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:54,700
To the Chinese government.
Communist dictatorship.

1971
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:55,530
Yeah.

1972
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:56,363
And of course it's a lovely system if 
Huawei phones how backdoors it allowed 

1973
01:42:00,651 --> 01:42:01,484
the Chinese to learn a lot about 
Americans and our culture and our 

1974
01:42:04,951 --> 01:42:07,440
communication.
And that's the concern.

1975
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:08,960
Um,
it's,

1976
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:13,140
that's actually more of a concern to me 
than like,

1977
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:17,910
um,
military spying in the strict sense.

1978
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,433
Cause I think China has so many people 
working on cyber warfare that we 

1979
01:42:24,991 --> 01:42:27,930
probably don't even have any idea what 
their capabilities are.

1980
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,450
But I think if they have insight into 
like,

1981
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:34,830
here's the American psyche and here's 
how their political thinking works,

1982
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:38,340
it will be quite a bit easier to kind of
manipulate,

1983
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:40,013
um,
in terms of our geopolitics because we 

1984
01:42:45,961 --> 01:42:50,540
don't have anything analogists I think,
where like,

1985
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:55,110
is the Pentagon trying to figure out how
could we nudge Chinese social media use?

1986
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:56,513
You don't think they know our interests.
I'd be surprised if they're doing it 

1987
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:00,833
well.

1988
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:01,873
Well,
what's fascinating is Google's take on 

1989
01:43:03,530 --> 01:43:04,363
China is that they're willing to censor 
video or internet searches because they 

1990
01:43:09,861 --> 01:43:13,160
feel like if they don't try to just 
going to copy their technology and do it

1991
01:43:13,161 --> 01:43:15,020
anyway,
and so this way,

1992
01:43:15,021 --> 01:43:17,030
at least they're in there.
I'm like,

1993
01:43:17,031 --> 01:43:17,864
boy,
that's a sketchy way of sort of 

1994
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,850
absolving yourself.
Yeah.

1995
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:26,520
Of any bad feelings about censorship.
You're,

1996
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:29,600
you're contributing to censorship.
Government issued censorship.

1997
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:30,613
Yeah,
because you want to control the market 

1998
01:43:32,330 --> 01:43:33,410
and we're going,
oh yeah,

1999
01:43:33,411 --> 01:43:34,001
well,
you know,

2000
01:43:34,001 --> 01:43:34,834
I can't Google Tiananmen Square.
You literally can't Google Tiananmen 

2001
01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:38,983
Square.

2002
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:47,410
It seems like there's a huge difference 
between China's authoritarian regime and

2003
01:43:47,411 --> 01:43:48,244
the American political system,
but I think they're not quite as 

2004
01:43:51,591 --> 01:43:52,424
different as a lot of folks think.
Like if you talk to Chinese academics 

2005
01:43:57,891 --> 01:44:00,560
about like what can you research and 
what can you not research,

2006
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:04,670
like they have different constraints 
than Americans do.

2007
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:05,504
But on at the pragmatic level,
there are certain topics that they can 

2008
01:44:10,951 --> 01:44:11,784
address that we can't and vice versa.
So it's not like there's just one 

2009
01:44:14,911 --> 01:44:17,220
dimension of freedom and we're better 
than them on,

2010
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:20,190
on every aspect of it.
And I,

2011
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:21,293
again,
I think American citizens have no idea 

2012
01:44:22,891 --> 01:44:27,891
how restricted American scientists are 
and kind of what we're allowed to study.

2013
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,080
Oh,
we're going to talk about loud too,

2014
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:34,230
or what you can get grants and approval 
for.

2015
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:35,813
And is that the same thing as allowed to
effectively it's the same thing because 

2016
01:44:38,341 --> 01:44:39,720
you,
if you don't have any funding,

2017
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:41,450
you're not going to,
there's no study.

2018
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:43,610
You can't do science without money.
Right.

2019
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:48,290
Um,
and in fact,

2020
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:51,620
like if I was starting my career again 
at this point,

2021
01:44:51,621 --> 01:44:52,454
I wouldn't go into academia.
If I wanted to understand human 

2022
01:44:54,531 --> 01:44:55,364
behavior,
I would go work for facebook or Google 

2023
01:44:58,340 --> 01:44:59,173
because they have much more data about 
human behavior than I could ever get as 

2024
01:45:04,071 --> 01:45:07,670
a scientist.
Are they doing that?

2025
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,193
I'm sure they're doing it,
but we don't know what they're finding 

2026
01:45:11,091 --> 01:45:13,610
because they don't publish journal 
papers.

2027
01:45:13,611 --> 01:45:15,920
It's all,
it's all commercial secrets.

2028
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:18,253
So what I'm sure that like facebook 
understands a lot more about social 

2029
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:27,890
psychology then social psychology does 
at this point.

2030
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,060
Really?
Yeah.

2031
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,970
How could they not?
They have like 1.2

2032
01:45:31,971 --> 01:45:36,971
billion people interacting socially 
regularly and they data mine to hell out

2033
01:45:37,641 --> 01:45:39,860
of that for commercial purposes.

2034
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:41,440
Right.
But are they publishing things?

2035
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:43,730
Are they sharing this information?
Don't turn it all.

2036
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,360
I'm sure it's all internal.
But internally,

2037
01:45:46,361 --> 01:45:47,770
do you think they're publishing things?

2038
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,040
Yeah,

2039
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,390
I dunno.
That's the thing.

2040
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:52,730
Yeah.
Um,

2041
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:53,893
it's just a little bit alarming when 
this state of the art in understanding 

2042
01:45:57,661 --> 01:45:59,190
behavior isn't public.

2043
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:02,453
That is alarming.
And then Mark Zuckerberg might be a 

2044
01:46:05,551 --> 01:46:06,660
robot to,
right.

2045
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,360
Everybody's worried about that might be 
a Spec spot.

2046
01:46:09,630 --> 01:46:10,463
We've,
we played many times a video of him 

2047
01:46:11,401 --> 01:46:12,770
drinking water.
I don't know,

2048
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:13,613
Dude.
He drinks water like that creepy little 

2049
01:46:15,751 --> 01:46:19,110
fuck.
It's a just kidding mark.

2050
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:20,670
Don't delete my account.
Um,

2051
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:25,950
I think that we're,
we're looking at in terms of like Google

2052
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:29,100
and facebook and twitter and even 
youtube,

2053
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:30,173
we're looking at these enormous 
organizations that I don't think they 

2054
01:46:35,221 --> 01:46:38,610
had any idea what they were going to be.
You know?

2055
01:46:38,611 --> 01:46:39,444
And I,
I really particularly feel that way 

2056
01:46:40,471 --> 01:46:44,100
about twitter.
When twitter first started out,

2057
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:45,413
do you remember how it used to be like 
you would use like you're at like at 

2058
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:51,720
Miller is enjoying a cup of coffee.
Yeah.

2059
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:52,653
You,
you would talk about yourself in the 

2060
01:46:53,371 --> 01:46:55,050
third person.
It was really weird,

2061
01:46:55,530 --> 01:46:56,550
you know,
uh,

2062
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:59,130
at Jamie Vernon is going to the movies.

2063
01:46:59,600 --> 01:46:59,840
Okay.

2064
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:00,673
And that's how people talked the early 
days of [inaudible] and then people 

2065
01:47:03,231 --> 01:47:04,790
realize what the fuck am I doing?

2066
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,553
You had,
that's sort of the reason it developed 

2067
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:11,520
it because there was no group tech 
texting back then in 2007 or six when it

2068
01:47:11,521 --> 01:47:14,610
started.
So it was developed for group texting so

2069
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:17,700
you could share what you were doing with
a group of your friends.

2070
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,460
Was that what it was for?
They opened it so that more people could

2071
01:47:20,461 --> 01:47:21,294
follow if you wanted to.
And then celebrities jumped on and then 

2072
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:24,361
it,
and they,

2073
01:47:24,361 --> 01:47:25,194
like,
they started adding the ability people 

2074
01:47:26,491 --> 01:47:30,090
just started doing at Joe Rogan.
So they'd added the ability to,

2075
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:33,240
to click that and share it and tag it.
Yeah.

2076
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,320
So weird.

2077
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,033
And then you think about it now,
now it's a vehicle for the president to 

2078
01:47:38,081 --> 01:47:39,160
threaten other countries

2079
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:41,723
and it is the,
it's the global public forum and 

2080
01:47:43,471 --> 01:47:44,304
particularly in America,
it is that the public square where 

2081
01:47:46,711 --> 01:47:48,020
everyone shares ideas and,

2082
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,800
well,
it's a less verbose version of facebook.

2083
01:47:50,830 --> 01:47:53,110
The problem with facebook is you just 
can write too much.

2084
01:47:53,170 --> 01:47:54,580
I can't keep up with you,
bro.

2085
01:47:54,910 --> 01:47:55,743
And I like the really,
really ridiculous people who just 

2086
01:47:58,421 --> 01:48:01,960
paragraph after paragraph of run on 
sentences with no,

2087
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:04,330
no editing at all.
Like ugh.

2088
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:07,560
Yeah,
it's a lot about,

2089
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:09,473
here's a very long story about my most 
recent emotional trauma or I dunno if 

2090
01:48:15,721 --> 01:48:18,630
anybody ever is like having a breakup or
divorce on facebook.

2091
01:48:18,631 --> 01:48:19,710
You're like,
Oh man,

2092
01:48:19,711 --> 01:48:20,610
now I'm going to have to listen.

2093
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:23,050
Stop for a few months.
Yeah.

2094
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,220
And then they reach out hoping some 
people say it's going to be okay,

2095
01:48:27,221 --> 01:48:29,290
mark,
everything's fine.

2096
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:30,483
Life moves on.
You're going to forget about her 

2097
01:48:32,021 --> 01:48:35,550
eventually.
It's just,

2098
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:38,080
and people keep going back to who's,
who's left a comment.

2099
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:39,590
Yeah,
yeah.

2100
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:41,570
Maybe she liked it.
Maybe she's changed her mind,

2101
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:45,980
but it,
it,

2102
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:46,813
I mean it is very kind of funny and 
interesting that nobody predicted 15 

2103
01:48:51,111 --> 01:48:55,220
years ago exactly how humans would make 
use of this new technology.

2104
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,153
Yeah.
Like nobody in psychology was talking 

2105
01:48:57,591 --> 01:48:58,850
about,
oh,

2106
01:48:58,851 --> 01:49:03,851
twitter is going to radically transform 
the way that science operates.

2107
01:49:04,671 --> 01:49:09,671
For example,
news of like failed replications will be

2108
01:49:10,371 --> 01:49:13,850
spread within three days to everybody in
a field.

2109
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:15,163
And anybody who does scientific 
misconduct will be suddenly like pushed 

2110
01:49:21,291 --> 01:49:26,291
out within a week or a new result will 
be shared globally within 24 hours.

2111
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:33,950
Nobody was thinking about that.
So there's like signs,

2112
01:49:33,951 --> 01:49:34,820
twitter,
politics,

2113
01:49:34,821 --> 01:49:35,601
twitter,
entertainment,

2114
01:49:35,601 --> 01:49:40,490
twitter,
and they've all kind of changed the game

2115
01:49:40,491 --> 01:49:42,860
and their respective fields.
Um,

2116
01:49:44,030 --> 01:49:44,863
and we didn't understand human nature 
well enough to predict how people 

2117
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,190
actually use the stuff.

2118
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:51,800
Yeah.
We did.

2119
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:53,270
Just didn't see it coming either.

2120
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,090
Okay.

2121
01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:55,340
I mean,
no one ever would.

2122
01:49:55,580 --> 01:50:00,580
I remember when Ashton Kutcher was in 
some sort of a race with someone else,

2123
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:03,840
I want to say to get to a million 
followers,

2124
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:05,830
wasn't it like a million?
Yeah.

2125
01:50:06,030 --> 01:50:09,810
And everybody thought that's crazy.
He's going to have a million followers.

2126
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:13,030
I don't even think he's on twitter 
anymore.

2127
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:17,340
He's not.
But his account is hilarious.

2128
01:50:17,341 --> 01:50:19,020
It's like a production company now or 
something.

2129
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:19,943
Yeah.
And gave it to system fucking too 

2130
01:50:21,241 --> 01:50:22,074
dangerous.

2131
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:25,120
And now what?
Katy Perry has like 120 minutes.

2132
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:27,770
Yeah.
Something insane.

2133
01:50:28,050 --> 01:50:28,883
Probably more.
And then you've got to go to her 

2134
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,610
instagram,
which is probably even bigger than that.

2135
01:50:31,611 --> 01:50:35,840
It was racing CNN and Brittany Spears.
Oh Wow.

2136
01:50:35,870 --> 01:50:37,490
Okay.
Here's the article for a million.

2137
01:50:37,491 --> 01:50:40,820
Look at that twitter race to a million,
what years at 2009.

2138
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:43,700
Wow.
Twitter raise to a million followers can

2139
01:50:43,701 --> 01:50:45,740
cut your beat.
CNN and spears.

2140
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:47,053
That's hilarious.
No one even knew what it meant back 

2141
01:50:49,161 --> 01:50:49,994
then.

2142
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
So I mean with the virtual reality work 
or the neuro link,

2143
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:00,540
right.
We're going to have those things.

2144
01:51:00,541 --> 01:51:03,090
We'll probably have a beginner impact on
culture and society.

2145
01:51:03,091 --> 01:51:04,700
Even then twitter did.
Yeah.

2146
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:08,940
And still people are kind of just 
sleepwalking into that,

2147
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:10,013
that world sleepwalking with a few 
hesitant observers on the outside 

2148
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:17,760
warning,

2149
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,593
like almost like standing back,
like watching someone play with 

2150
01:51:20,251 --> 01:51:20,971
fireworks.
Like,

2151
01:51:20,971 --> 01:51:22,260
okay,
Hey,

2152
01:51:22,261 --> 01:51:23,094
um,
do you know what's going to happen when 

2153
01:51:24,421 --> 01:51:28,350
you light that garbage can on fire?
It's filled with dynamite

2154
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:36,940
and the legal issues or privacy issues 
that the impact on relationships.

2155
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:38,630
Yeah.
Um,

2156
01:51:38,690 --> 01:51:39,523
is okay,
so like we train a lot of PHD's in 

2157
01:51:43,821 --> 01:51:44,654
clinical psychology in my department and
a lot of them are going to deal with 

2158
01:51:47,781 --> 01:51:48,614
people and their relationships and their
marriages and the conflicts and 

2159
01:51:50,931 --> 01:51:51,764
arguments and whatever.
Are we training them for a future world 

2160
01:51:55,371 --> 01:51:56,204
where they're going to have to deal with
sex bots and virtual reality and new 

2161
01:52:00,681 --> 01:52:01,514
forms of social media and new kinds of 
basically telepathy that are foreign 

2162
01:52:07,851 --> 01:52:09,740
advance of human language.
No or not.

2163
01:52:10,730 --> 01:52:11,563
But that's,
that's the world that they're going to 

2164
01:52:13,011 --> 01:52:14,750
spend their professional lives in.

2165
01:52:15,050 --> 01:52:17,240
Isn't it similar in some ways?
I mean,

2166
01:52:17,241 --> 01:52:18,530
Jamie,
you could speak to this,

2167
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:19,903
you were trained as an audio engineer 
and now everything's like all the 

2168
01:52:23,571 --> 01:52:28,190
software that was available when you 
were learning is just useless now.

2169
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:29,493
Honestly,
it wasn't even youtube when I went to 

2170
01:52:30,651 --> 01:52:33,320
school.
So a lot of the,

2171
01:52:33,321 --> 01:52:34,154
uh,
if anyone has questions now you can 

2172
01:52:35,421 --> 01:52:36,254
learn almost everything.
I learned in the Year of program I had 

2173
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:40,813
in a week if you need it to,
you just don't get the hands on 

2174
01:52:44,361 --> 01:52:46,010
application and touched on this stuff.
But

2175
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,380
yeah,

2176
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:47,213
but people that went to school for video
editing and all the other different 

2177
01:52:49,981 --> 01:52:50,814
systems

2178
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,213
detailed,
detailed from anyone you want to watch 

2179
01:52:54,861 --> 01:52:56,900
now almost because they even had like 
the master class,

2180
01:52:56,901 --> 01:52:58,790
you could learn screenwriting from Aaron
Sorkin.

2181
01:52:58,791 --> 01:53:00,780
It learn directing from Hawaii.
Yeah.

2182
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:04,190
Ron Howard or whatever it is.
You didn't have that 10 years ago.

2183
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:07,520
Yeah.
And then in terms of financial,

2184
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:09,163
I mean the,
the amount of financial strain that 

2185
01:53:10,971 --> 01:53:14,930
getting the traditional education puts 
on people and they get out of school and

2186
01:53:14,931 --> 01:53:17,060
they're saddled with this debt that is 
also,

2187
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:21,080
you can't even absolve it if you declare
bankruptcy,

2188
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:22,393
which is kind of hilarious when you 
think of the dirty shit that banks do 

2189
01:53:24,861 --> 01:53:25,694
and Wall Street does and all the risks 
they take and all the chaos that they 

2190
01:53:28,881 --> 01:53:29,714
have created from their shitty decisions
that have affected the entire economy 

2191
01:53:32,481 --> 01:53:33,314
and they're absolved.
But yet some kid who wanted to get a 

2192
01:53:37,281 --> 01:53:42,050
gender studies degree and now as a 
quarter million dollars,

2193
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:45,050
some fucking halfassed Michigan 
University.

2194
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:48,880
I think it's unconscionable.
Yeah,

2195
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:50,170
it's terrible.
I mean,

2196
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:51,803
I feel really morally conflicted about 
working in an industry that I think is 

2197
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,760
pretty exploitative and a lot of ways.

2198
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,320
Yeah,
I was going to ask you about that.

2199
01:53:59,350 --> 01:54:02,920
Like what,
what's the stance that you take?

2200
01:54:02,921 --> 01:54:06,070
I mean if,
if a kid comes to you and says,

2201
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:07,750
you know,
I don't know what to do here.

2202
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:13,480
I mean generally the stance I take,
so in,

2203
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:14,373
in a way I'm,
I'm lucky because I work at a large 

2204
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,410
state public university and tuition is 
really pretty.

2205
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:24,590
Do you want to say which one it is that 
people at University of New Mexico,

2206
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:26,540
um,
and it's great.

2207
01:54:26,541 --> 01:54:29,360
We serve 40,000
students and we charge very,

2208
01:54:29,361 --> 01:54:30,194
very little tuition money compared to 
most places because it state subsidized 

2209
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:37,340
and if you keep up a certain grade point
average,

2210
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:42,800
it's about as close to free as you can,
you can get in America.

2211
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:44,623
So I don't feel like we're as 
economically exploitative as if I was 

2212
01:54:47,961 --> 01:54:50,420
like teaching at Middlebury college or 
Yale or whatever.

2213
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:54,140
But still,
um,

2214
01:54:56,050 --> 01:54:57,710
you know,
of undergrads come to me and they go,

2215
01:54:57,711 --> 01:54:59,750
what,
what should I learn?

2216
01:54:59,751 --> 01:55:02,360
What should I major in?
What classes should I take?

2217
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:03,973
The only real advice I can give is like 
take stuff that's going to be useful in 

2218
01:55:07,101 --> 01:55:08,660
your life,
your personal life,

2219
01:55:08,661 --> 01:55:10,640
no matter what career you do.

2220
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:11,783
Mm.
So you should take my human sexuality 

2221
01:55:13,551 --> 01:55:14,384
class cause you'll probably be a sexual 
being for the rest of your life and 

2222
01:55:16,701 --> 01:55:19,370
you'll be in relationships of some sort 
or another.

2223
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:21,870
You should learn about,
um,

2224
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:23,683
politics.
You should learn about the history of 

2225
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:26,173
civilization.
You should learn about animal behavior 

2226
01:55:27,741 --> 01:55:32,270
and biology and all that stuff.
But don't expect that.

2227
01:55:32,271 --> 01:55:33,104
Like you can major in pharmacy and then 
get a job as a pharmacist that makes a 

2228
01:55:40,290 --> 01:55:44,820
hundred k out of the gate because that 
might be automated.

2229
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:49,800
Don't assume you can go to law school 
and you'll make bank like your dad did.

2230
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:53,090
Because a lot of that like,
um,

2231
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:53,963
document discovery is being automated.
Don't assume you're going to be a 

2232
01:55:57,690 --> 01:56:00,350
surgeon because that might be 
roboticized.

2233
01:56:01,770 --> 01:56:06,440
So I just say you should try to get a 
classical liberal arts education that,

2234
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:11,460
that equips you as a citizen and as a 
person and as a,

2235
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:16,320
um,
an ethical being a and that's the future

2236
01:56:16,321 --> 01:56:18,090
proof way to do it.

2237
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:22,740
And even then,
there's a distinct possibility that this

2238
01:56:22,741 --> 01:56:23,574
education or a superior version of it 
will be available through some new 

2239
01:56:26,911 --> 01:56:29,910
unfound or soon to be discovered form.

2240
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:34,400
Yeah.
And just expect that you will,

2241
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:38,060
if you stay curious throughout your 
life,

2242
01:56:38,061 --> 01:56:41,510
you'll be able to learn about as much,
you know,

2243
01:56:41,511 --> 01:56:46,511
in every four to six years going forward
as you learned in this four to six years

2244
01:56:46,551 --> 01:56:47,810
of college.
That's right.

2245
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:48,663
What's interesting is that no one really
thinks of a university education as 

2246
01:56:52,381 --> 01:56:54,510
being something that equips you for 
life,

2247
01:56:54,690 --> 01:56:58,080
that your,
your learning so that you can just,

2248
01:56:58,790 --> 01:56:59,623
you're,
you're just educating yourself and to 

2249
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:07,100
sort of make your mind more available 
possibilities and options and

2250
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:09,800
causes and effects.
And just,

2251
01:57:10,610 --> 01:57:12,920
just for your own edification that 
that's,

2252
01:57:12,921 --> 01:57:15,860
this is not a consideration.
People think I need a career.

2253
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:17,023
Uh,
I don't want to go to this college for 

2254
01:57:17,511 --> 01:57:18,430
four years.
When I get out,

2255
01:57:18,431 --> 01:57:22,190
I want to kick ass job cause I want to 
buy Alexis or whatever it is.

2256
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:24,590
My favorite students,
honestly,

2257
01:57:24,591 --> 01:57:28,550
are the mature students.
It's the vets about a couple of tours in

2258
01:57:28,551 --> 01:57:29,384
Iraq or Afghanistan and come back to 
college and they have life experience 

2259
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:36,620
and they're like here because they 
really want to learn,

2260
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:39,710
not because the parents think it's the 
right thing to do.

2261
01:57:40,190 --> 01:57:42,380
Or even in my human sexuality class,
I get,

2262
01:57:43,330 --> 01:57:44,163
uh,
grandparents in their sixties and 

2263
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:47,420
seventies sometimes.
Really?

2264
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:48,680
Yeah.
Grand Pan.

2265
01:57:48,681 --> 01:57:52,400
They're great because they've actually 
had like 50 or marriages,

2266
01:57:52,401 --> 01:57:56,090
so they know a little something about,
wow,

2267
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:57,013
you know,
psychology and it's not for their 

2268
01:58:00,261 --> 01:58:02,240
career.
It's not for the status.

2269
01:58:02,241 --> 01:58:04,490
It's because they really want to be 
there and they want to learn.

2270
01:58:04,940 --> 01:58:05,773
Well,
I would also imagine they're not as 

2271
01:58:06,831 --> 01:58:08,510
filled with angst as an eight

2272
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:13,550
18 year old first escape from the family
nest and is not understanding what to do

2273
01:58:15,151 --> 01:58:16,200
with their freedom and

2274
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:19,700
so many distractions.
They're there just to educate,

2275
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,960
educate themselves.
Yeah,

2276
01:58:21,961 --> 01:58:23,730
they're there.
They're less neurotic.

2277
01:58:23,731 --> 01:58:25,380
They're more confident.
Um,

2278
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:29,520
they call me out on my bullshit 
sometimes today.

2279
01:58:29,730 --> 01:58:30,451
Oh yeah.
Like,

2280
01:58:30,451 --> 01:58:31,830
like what bullshit.
Um,

2281
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:34,433
well,
the horrifying thing now of if you're 

2282
01:58:35,371 --> 01:58:36,204
teaching a class is you can make a 
factual claim and any student can check 

2283
01:58:40,291 --> 01:58:41,124
it on,
on while I'm talking while you're 

2284
01:58:43,421 --> 01:58:44,254
talking.
And of course the 20 year old won't 

2285
01:58:46,451 --> 01:58:48,040
raise their hand and go,
that's wrong.

2286
01:58:48,970 --> 01:58:52,420
Put the grandmas will grandma's well,
yeah.

2287
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:55,630
Hilarious.
So yet you have to,

2288
01:58:55,790 --> 01:59:00,790
what do you even call that on?
Okay.

2289
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:08,011
So there was a book back in 99 called,
uh,

2290
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:15,210
I think the technology of orgasm that 
made the claim that vibrators were first

2291
01:59:15,281 --> 01:59:16,114
invented in the Victorian era,
the late 18 hundreds to help doctors 

2292
01:59:20,441 --> 01:59:23,980
bring their female patients to orgasm to
cure quote hysteria.

2293
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:28,660
And for 20 years that was sort of 
accepted as,

2294
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:29,523
oh yeah,
that's a good historical analysis of 

2295
01:59:30,881 --> 01:59:31,714
that situation.
And then that got totally debunked in 

2296
01:59:35,321 --> 01:59:37,610
the last few months by other historians.
Look,

2297
01:59:37,611 --> 01:59:40,750
the last few months I've been telling 
people that forever.

2298
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:41,733
I know I

2299
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:45,990
kai had to,
and what's the reality?

2300
01:59:45,991 --> 01:59:47,110
They didn't really,
doctor,

2301
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:51,180
you didn't finger back.
There's no evidence at all that that was

2302
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:53,940
going on.
I would think that that would be a thing

2303
01:59:53,941 --> 01:59:54,774
that Gal's wouldn't want to let go.
If there was a place we could go or the 

2304
01:59:57,421 --> 02:00:00,330
doctor definitely knew how to work it.
You give you an orgasm,

2305
02:00:00,331 --> 02:00:03,780
there'd be a line around the block,
frustrated ladies,

2306
02:00:03,781 --> 02:00:04,800
you would,
you would,

2307
02:00:05,130 --> 02:00:07,080
you would think it would have left it 
there in print.

2308
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:09,990
I would not just that,
why would it stop?

2309
02:00:10,350 --> 02:00:11,700
Why would the doctor say,
you know what,

2310
02:00:11,701 --> 02:00:14,330
this business is just too goddamn 
lucrative and my hands are tired.

2311
02:00:14,370 --> 02:00:16,350
Closing up shop.
I got carpal tunnel.

2312
02:00:16,410 --> 02:00:17,610
I can't even type anymore.

2313
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:21,860
Yeah.
And the women are like,

2314
02:00:22,910 --> 02:00:23,900
yeah,
how would that go away?

2315
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:26,030
So it was no evidence of who invented 
that.

2316
02:00:26,630 --> 02:00:28,790
I can't remember the name of the author 
of that.

2317
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:31,520
Um,
it even got made into a movie hysteria.

2318
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:32,180
Right?

2319
02:00:32,180 --> 02:00:35,030
The job nobody wanted.
Is that a book?

2320
02:00:35,450 --> 02:00:36,283
Oh yeah.
There we go about it from the New York 

2321
02:00:37,911 --> 02:00:40,310
Times based off the book.
Or this might actually be from the book.

2322
02:00:40,311 --> 02:00:42,800
And what year is this?
I don't,

2323
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:44,410
this might be the book.
I don't know.

2324
02:00:45,110 --> 02:00:46,260
Yeah,
I think that's it.

2325
02:00:46,730 --> 02:00:51,440
It,
so is this like sorta like that killer's

2326
02:00:51,441 --> 02:00:54,710
sperm theory that people still to this 
day recite,

2327
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:55,573
even though there's no evidence 
whatsoever that's prime as any other 

2328
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:00,590
function other than impregnating and 
egg?

2329
02:01:01,190 --> 02:01:02,900
Yeah.
There's a lot of kind of urban myths.

2330
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:05,360
That's a big one though.
There was a whole book written about,

2331
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:07,430
about different kinds of berm.
Yeah.

2332
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:09,440
Sperm wars attacks Berm.
Yeah.

2333
02:01:09,590 --> 02:01:10,850
That would kill other sperm

2334
02:01:11,070 --> 02:01:16,020
Baker and bellis back in the early 
nineties and those guys are assholes.

2335
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:16,943
It was a beautiful theory,
but like nobody could replicate it and 

2336
02:01:21,301 --> 02:01:22,140
it just didn't work.

2337
02:01:22,290 --> 02:01:23,123
Oh,
I thought it was a little pac man's 

2338
02:01:24,621 --> 02:01:26,880
sperm of their attack.
Another sperm.

2339
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:27,900
Right.
They called it what?

2340
02:01:27,901 --> 02:01:29,880
Kamikaze sperm.
Is that what they call it?

2341
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,833
Yeah,
the sperm that allegedly were 

2342
02:01:31,621 --> 02:01:32,880
specialized to,
yeah.

2343
02:01:32,881 --> 02:01:34,560
I remember someone brought that up to me
and I,

2344
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:36,000
I,
uh,

2345
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,710
I read it and I went,
oh boy,

2346
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:40,280
I don't know about that.
How smaller

2347
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,113
sperm.
So there's not a lot of room in there 

2348
02:01:42,651 --> 02:01:43,484
for other functions.
Like how are they even getting those 

2349
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:47,570
other sperm and killing them?
Like,

2350
02:01:47,571 --> 02:01:49,100
what's,
what are they using?

2351
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:51,170
They have acid,
like the alien.

2352
02:01:51,410 --> 02:01:53,390
What are they doing?
They rotten little ied.

2353
02:01:53,570 --> 02:01:54,403
Yeah.
What are they doing?

2354
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:57,473
Yeah,

2355
02:01:57,630 --> 02:02:00,930
they have an acrosome reaction.
Like there is a tiny little warhead that

2356
02:02:00,931 --> 02:02:05,240
like helps her get into the egg a 
warhead.

2357
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:10,610
Well it's some enzymes that are pretty 
good at that kind penetrating yeah.

2358
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:14,220
Digesting their way in.
But yeah,

2359
02:02:14,221 --> 02:02:17,280
that's an example of urban myth,
um,

2360
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:19,633
published urban myth published.
I mean at the time it was plausible but 

2361
02:02:24,381 --> 02:02:25,214
it kinda got debunked fairly quickly.
So it was this sort of just a 

2362
02:02:28,551 --> 02:02:33,551
sensational sort of an article that 
someone wrote or the book that they did,

2363
02:02:33,891 --> 02:02:34,910
they just say,
hey,

2364
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:36,973
let's just fake this in order to sell a 
lot of books and get people excited 

2365
02:02:40,431 --> 02:02:42,470
about our work.
I don't think they faked it.

2366
02:02:42,471 --> 02:02:47,471
I think they may,
they slightly old oversold it,

2367
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:48,393
but they,
like,

2368
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:52,630
they did have some proper journal paper 
publications that were peer reviewed and

2369
02:02:52,631 --> 02:02:53,464
that made sense at the time.
And like I used to teach that stuff 

2370
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:56,890
cause I believe that.
Oh yeah.

2371
02:02:57,070 --> 02:02:57,940
How'd you teach it?
Like,

2372
02:02:57,950 --> 02:02:59,110
what,
what was the,

2373
02:02:59,650 --> 02:03:04,650
what was the conventional way of 
describing this conventional story was

2374
02:03:07,710 --> 02:03:11,820
people think we evolved to be in 
monogamous,

2375
02:03:11,821 --> 02:03:12,654
long term pair bonds,
but here's some evidence that humans do 

2376
02:03:18,570 --> 02:03:23,160
extra pair copulations that they 
sometimes go outside the relationship.

2377
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,313
If that happens,
then there's occasional sperm 

2378
02:03:28,231 --> 02:03:29,064
competition where a woman mates with 
more than one guy during one ovulatory 

2379
02:03:32,311 --> 02:03:33,144
cycle.
So that potentially ejaculates from two 

2380
02:03:37,111 --> 02:03:37,944
different guys could be in a 
reproductive track competing to 

2381
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:45,690
fertilize same ag.
If that happens,

2382
02:03:46,170 --> 02:03:51,170
the sperm would be under selection to be
good at being fast,

2383
02:03:51,571 --> 02:03:53,790
fighting off the other sperm,
um,

2384
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:59,190
making the reproductive tract more 
hostile to any guy who comes after you,

2385
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:00,330
et Cetera,
et cetera.

2386
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:05,280
So it was kind of like a way of 
challenging the assumption of monogamous

2387
02:04:05,281 --> 02:04:06,114
mating and pointing out women have this 
sexual freedom and agency that was not 

2388
02:04:12,031 --> 02:04:12,864
fully recognized.
And the result is men have to compete 

2389
02:04:15,181 --> 02:04:18,000
more,
like not just physically,

2390
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:20,520
uh,
not just for status speeding and even at

2391
02:04:20,521 --> 02:04:22,080
this kind of biochemical level.

2392
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:26,070
And it all made sense,
right?

2393
02:04:26,140 --> 02:04:29,760
We could have been that species,
but as it turned out,

2394
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:31,483
um,
the rates of extra pair copulation or 

2395
02:04:35,821 --> 02:04:36,654
infidelity or actually pretty low and a 
lot of societies like it's not like 20% 

2396
02:04:43,711 --> 02:04:46,770
of kids are sired by some guy other than
their dad.

2397
02:04:46,771 --> 02:04:51,000
It's like mostly well under two or 3%.
Right.

2398
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:52,740
But we're talking about now.
Yeah.

2399
02:04:53,070 --> 02:04:53,903
But in,
in comparison to when all of this stuff 

2400
02:04:55,981 --> 02:04:59,460
evolved,
we could be talking about humans of 50,

2401
02:04:59,461 --> 02:05:00,810
60,000
years ago.

2402
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:02,760
Yeah.
Which is a totally different ballgame.

2403
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:05,010
It is different.
And if,

2404
02:05:06,090 --> 02:05:11,010
if we'd been a species with like a lot 
of sperm competition,

2405
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,440
then our testicles would be as big as 
chimp testicles.

2406
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,910
Right.
That's what's interesting,

2407
02:05:14,911 --> 02:05:16,320
right.
That when it comes,

2408
02:05:16,410 --> 02:05:17,243
there's a direct correlation between the
number of promiscuous females in the 

2409
02:05:20,491 --> 02:05:22,320
size of the testicles of the male.
Yeah.

2410
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:24,450
Which is why girls have little tiny 
dicks.

2411
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:26,100
Yeah.
Cause they're just dominating.

2412
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:27,173
Yeah.

2413
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:30,600
Well I,
I wouldn't,

2414
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:34,860
I wouldn't try to do some other alpha 
bad idea.

2415
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:38,730
I mean crazy that something grew to be 
so strong,

2416
02:05:38,731 --> 02:05:43,380
so powerful with giant fangs and it only
eats like stalks of grass.

2417
02:05:43,381 --> 02:05:45,510
And Broccoli and shit.
Yeah.

2418
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:48,353
So there's,
there's a lot of these little things in 

2419
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:52,620
psychology,
these little urban myths that get,

2420
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:54,763
you know,
learn by professors and Grad school and 

2421
02:05:56,701 --> 02:05:57,534
never really tested and then passed on.
And now that whole house of cards has 

2422
02:06:02,071 --> 02:06:02,904
been tumbling down the last couple of 
years where like almost everything that 

2423
02:06:07,231 --> 02:06:12,231
was taught in a social psychology course
now turns out to be kind of bullshit and

2424
02:06:12,781 --> 02:06:16,110
not like what other examples?
Um,

2425
02:06:18,930 --> 02:06:19,763
the idea that you can use a implicit 
association test or iat to sort of 

2426
02:06:24,571 --> 02:06:27,210
register how sexist or racist somebody 
is.

2427
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:28,763
Right.
That was a big exciting thing that 

2428
02:06:31,741 --> 02:06:32,574
social psychologist thought that they'd 
discovered that you can give someone 

2429
02:06:35,371 --> 02:06:36,204
this kind of computer test that measures
word associations and that kind of 

2430
02:06:40,531 --> 02:06:44,190
determine like how secretly sexist are 
you.

2431
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:49,620
And that turned into a whole industry of
giving these tests,

2432
02:06:49,621 --> 02:06:53,190
everybody in corporations to sort of 
assess,

2433
02:06:53,890 --> 02:06:55,730
you know,
are you secretly sexist and it,

2434
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:58,050
and to sort of wag fingers at them and 
say,

2435
02:06:58,051 --> 02:07:00,810
see,
you scored positive on this test,

2436
02:07:01,290 --> 02:07:06,150
that means you really are secretly 
sexist and therefore you need training.

2437
02:07:06,430 --> 02:07:07,970
Mm.
Um,

2438
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:10,830
and that's the industry and this is what
happened with starbucks,

2439
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:11,693
right?
A few months ago when they had that 

2440
02:07:15,390 --> 02:07:16,223
issue with the black guys and the 
starbucks and starbucks didn't handle 

2441
02:07:19,651 --> 02:07:20,484
that well,
and then there is public blow back and 

2442
02:07:23,251 --> 02:07:24,450
starbucks went,
okay,

2443
02:07:24,451 --> 02:07:25,284
we're going to do implicit association 
training for all of our staff 

2444
02:07:27,871 --> 02:07:31,410
nationwide.
And all of us in psychology.

2445
02:07:31,411 --> 02:07:33,270
We're like,
wait,

2446
02:07:33,271 --> 02:07:38,230
but you,
you guys know that was all debunked like

2447
02:07:38,230 --> 02:07:39,460
a couple of years ago.
It's all nonsense.

2448
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:40,323
No,
they're just concerned about the optics 

2449
02:07:40,991 --> 02:07:42,640
in order to make their stock go up.
Right?

2450
02:07:42,820 --> 02:07:43,930
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2451
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:46,330
So it's,
it's a pr move,

2452
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:48,400
but,
but it's not science based.

2453
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:49,383
It's not science based on,
and anybody who's a savvy consumer will 

2454
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:56,380
be able to like Google this stuff and 
see,

2455
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:57,280
oh,
it's,

2456
02:07:58,240 --> 02:07:59,073
it's nonsense.
But implicit bias training is still 

2457
02:08:00,671 --> 02:08:01,540
being used.
Right.

2458
02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:03,670
And so,
and it's all horse shit.

2459
02:08:04,390 --> 02:08:05,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

2460
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:11,800
So what is the method like,
say if you ran a corporation and,

2461
02:08:11,801 --> 02:08:12,880
uh,
like,

2462
02:08:12,881 --> 02:08:13,601
uh,
hey everybody,

2463
02:08:13,601 --> 02:08:16,210
Jeffery's going to come in and teach us 
how not to be racist.

2464
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:18,190
You might be racist,
not even know it.

2465
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:19,570
And Jeffrey's going to show you how,

2466
02:08:21,290 --> 02:08:23,900
I don't really know what they do in 
implicit bias training.

2467
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:24,823
I know that they typically will give 
everybody one of these implicit 

2468
02:08:27,681 --> 02:08:28,514
association tests that purports to show 
that you have issues and you do have 

2469
02:08:33,441 --> 02:08:34,274
hidden bias.
Like what would be like a question on 

2470
02:08:36,021 --> 02:08:39,140
one of these tests?
It's like associations.

2471
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:41,053
It's basically d are you faster to 
associate this stigmatized group with 

2472
02:08:46,251 --> 02:08:50,240
this negative word than you are to 
associate them with a positive word?

2473
02:08:50,780 --> 02:08:53,510
And you can measure reaction time.
Oh boy.

2474
02:08:53,930 --> 02:08:57,530
So lever in your hand or by you're 
pushing,

2475
02:08:57,590 --> 02:09:00,260
you're pushing,
you're seeing words flash on screens and

2476
02:09:00,261 --> 02:09:03,330
you're pushing buttons.
And the,

2477
02:09:03,490 --> 02:09:04,323
the subtle differences in reaction speed
to like the good versus the bad 

2478
02:09:08,991 --> 02:09:09,824
associations are supposed to map like 
your attitude towards the group in 

2479
02:09:15,111 --> 02:09:20,111
question.
And it's a,

2480
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:21,193
it's a reliable a fact.
The problem is it doesn't actually 

2481
02:09:23,121 --> 02:09:26,900
predict real sexist behavior in real 
life or racist behavior.

2482
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:28,633
So,
so how did it get past the initial 

2483
02:09:33,531 --> 02:09:35,600
stages to the point what was 
implemented?

2484
02:09:35,770 --> 02:09:36,603
Um,
social psychology has just a very 

2485
02:09:38,871 --> 02:09:39,704
politically correct,
virtually everybody in it is pretty far 

2486
02:09:43,791 --> 02:09:46,610
left.
And if you're conservative or centrist,

2487
02:09:46,611 --> 02:09:50,210
you pretty quickly get driven out of it.
Really?

2488
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:52,140
Oh yeah.
So Centra,

2489
02:09:52,141 --> 02:09:54,200
Steven,
um,

2490
02:09:55,250 --> 02:09:59,300
well we have pretty good data now unlike
like political affiliations of people in

2491
02:09:59,301 --> 02:10:04,301
different fields and in psychology it's 
at least like 10 or 15 to one liberal to

2492
02:10:05,541 --> 02:10:08,270
conservative.
Why do you think that is?

2493
02:10:08,630 --> 02:10:12,890
Is that more of the indoctrination of 
the walled garden of academia?

2494
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:14,713
I think it's partly that,
but I think it's also like there is 

2495
02:10:18,650 --> 02:10:21,970
pretty overt hostility to,
um,

2496
02:10:22,970 --> 02:10:23,803
centrist conservatives,
libertarians where you just kind of get 

2497
02:10:26,991 --> 02:10:29,270
these signals.
Like if you start Grad school that,

2498
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:33,710
um,
whatever you asked all others,

2499
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:34,760
other students,
Hey,

2500
02:10:34,761 --> 02:10:37,520
do you want to go to the shooting range 
or do you want to go hunting?

2501
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:38,533
Or let's talk about politics.
And if you're on the wrong side of 

2502
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:44,923
what's considered normal,
then you're made to feel pretty 

2503
02:10:47,301 --> 02:10:49,970
uncomfortable.
And you'll probably just,

2504
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,680
you know,
leave Grad school and go,

2505
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:53,000
uh,
the hell with that.

2506
02:10:53,001 --> 02:10:56,630
I'm going to be a lawyer,
entrepreneur.

2507
02:10:57,290 --> 02:10:59,270
Um,
whatever.

2508
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:02,980
So just the hostility forces people out.
It's as a tribal environment.

2509
02:11:03,070 --> 02:11:05,680
Yeah.
What was the source of that?

2510
02:11:06,670 --> 02:11:11,320
I mean,
it seems like if you're going to do real

2511
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:12,873
social experimental work,
if you're really going to try to 

2512
02:11:15,971 --> 02:11:20,310
understand human behavior,
it's really gotta be done objectively to

2513
02:11:20,350 --> 02:11:21,183
really get the actual raw data to really
be able to do scientific work where 

2514
02:11:25,781 --> 02:11:26,614
you're explaining things and trying to 
gauge cause and effect and origins of 

2515
02:11:31,091 --> 02:11:31,924
thought and behavior patterns.
You'd have to do it really objectively 

2516
02:11:35,860 --> 02:11:36,693
the same way you would do mathematics.
You'd have to really look at it 

2517
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:43,720
cautiously and get your data points in 
order and,

2518
02:11:43,721 --> 02:11:46,240
and,
and if you're doing real good work,

2519
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:51,550
you would think that there would be more
of an inclination to do good work,

2520
02:11:51,730 --> 02:11:56,100
then it would be to a ps whatever tribe 
you belong to too.

2521
02:11:58,010 --> 02:11:59,110
He would hope so.
But,

2522
02:11:59,950 --> 02:12:02,230
um,
take political psychology,

2523
02:12:02,231 --> 02:12:03,064
for example,
where the whole point is to understand 

2524
02:12:04,481 --> 02:12:07,000
how people think about politics and 
moral issues.

2525
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:11,800
There's a huge liberal bias and 
political psychology and you would think

2526
02:12:11,801 --> 02:12:14,560
they would have corrected that and said,
you know what,

2527
02:12:14,561 --> 02:12:15,394
it's that maybe we're missing something 
by not like we have a conference of 500 

2528
02:12:20,201 --> 02:12:22,930
people and there's not a single 
libertarian here or whatever.

2529
02:12:23,290 --> 02:12:26,040
And they never self corrected like that.
Um,

2530
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:27,640
they just assumed,
well,

2531
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:31,520
we're all well intentioned and we're all
smart so we're going to be able to,

2532
02:12:31,670 --> 02:12:36,670
to check our own biases and they 
completely failed to do that.

2533
02:12:38,590 --> 02:12:43,590
So you have all these measures of like 
political attitudes invented by leftists

2534
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:51,120
that kind of demonize conservatives or,
or centrists as basically being mentally

2535
02:12:54,731 --> 02:12:56,760
ill or,
or stupid or,

2536
02:12:56,790 --> 02:12:57,623
or whatever.
Where do you fit on the political 

2537
02:12:59,291 --> 02:13:00,124
spectrum?

2538
02:13:00,790 --> 02:13:05,790
I'm kind of a centrist libertarian with 
like a complicated patchwork of views.

2539
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:07,473
Like I,
I'd be considered extremely far left on 

2540
02:13:10,871 --> 02:13:11,704
certain things and pretty far right on,
on other things like what far right and 

2541
02:13:16,301 --> 02:13:18,200
what?
Um,

2542
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:25,740
I'm pro gun rights.
I'm pretty cautious about immigration,

2543
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:31,090
um,
on pro economic freedom.

2544
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:32,910
Um,
I don't want a big,

2545
02:13:33,210 --> 02:13:38,210
expensive state that has high tax 
burdens and,

2546
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,580
um,
um,

2547
02:13:42,430 --> 02:13:44,550
in,
in complicated ways,

2548
02:13:44,551 --> 02:13:47,970
kind of profoundly values and pro 
natalist and like,

2549
02:13:47,971 --> 02:13:52,971
I think longterm relationships are good,
not necessarily conventional ones,

2550
02:13:53,161 --> 02:13:53,994
but I'm pretty concerned about society 
figuring out a way to make it possible 

2551
02:13:58,741 --> 02:14:02,190
for ordinary folks to have longterm 
relationships and raise families.

2552
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:07,180
Isn't it fascinating that that's a right
wing thing?

2553
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:10,293
Wouldn't you think that something that 
would encourage families like the 

2554
02:14:14,501 --> 02:14:16,450
universal,
it wouldn't be tribal.

2555
02:14:16,660 --> 02:14:17,493
I mean,
you would think that something that 

2556
02:14:17,951 --> 02:14:18,784
would encourage longterm relationships 
and monogamous pair bonding and people 

2557
02:14:24,521 --> 02:14:25,354
getting together and working out long 
term solutions to keep a family 

2558
02:14:29,591 --> 02:14:30,424
together,

2559
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:32,213
that'd be,
uh,

2560
02:14:33,030 --> 02:14:35,580
that'd be good for everybody you would 
think.

2561
02:14:35,610 --> 02:14:38,280
I mean,
that seems like a left wing thing too.

2562
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:41,700
So the left is very concerned about 
environmental sustainability.

2563
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:42,540
Right?
Right.

2564
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:43,373
But they're not that concerned about 
kind of what you could call the 

2565
02:14:45,111 --> 02:14:48,690
civilizational sustainability or family 
sustainability.

2566
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:55,240
And I don't totally understand why,
but you tend to get the right thinking,

2567
02:14:56,810 --> 02:14:57,643
um,
how's this going to affect my great 

2568
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:01,493
grandkids or allow me to have any,
and the left is more like how's this 

2569
02:15:04,591 --> 02:15:05,424
gonna Affect Harp seals and polar bail 
bears in a hundred days and one should 

2570
02:15:14,941 --> 02:15:16,500
sort of imply the other but

2571
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:18,133
okay.

2572
02:15:19,740 --> 02:15:20,850
Hence being a centrist

2573
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:22,800
[inaudible].
Yeah,

2574
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:24,390
that's being a centrist and like

2575
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:28,783
it's a weird thing like when you try to 
reach a conclusion about a particular 

2576
02:15:33,111 --> 02:15:33,944
political issue based on what you think 
is think of the facts and the evidence 

2577
02:15:37,791 --> 02:15:42,791
in the good arguments and then you do 
that for each issue separately.

2578
02:15:44,570 --> 02:15:45,403
Right.
Rather than doing kind of tribal 

2579
02:15:46,221 --> 02:15:49,130
affiliation signaling,
it's very,

2580
02:15:49,131 --> 02:15:49,964
very confusing to people because they're
like how can you be like pro cannabis 

2581
02:15:56,241 --> 02:16:01,241
legalization if you're also pro guns or 
how can you be like open to polyamory if

2582
02:16:04,071 --> 02:16:09,071
you're also concerned about long term 
family stability or whatever.

2583
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:13,820
I was like,
that's just cause of the issues I looked

2584
02:16:13,821 --> 02:16:16,940
into.
That's the end dies.

2585
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,950
I ended up supporting.

2586
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:20,920
Does this go back to what we were 
talking about earlier,

2587
02:16:20,921 --> 02:16:21,754
that most people really don't have the 
time to form these opinions or become 

2588
02:16:26,321 --> 02:16:29,980
informed on these opinions and instead 
they just sort of adopt a pattern of

2589
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:34,980
behavior that seems to be the tribe that
they most affiliate with.

2590
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:38,680
So this this way are,
there's a conglomeration of opinions.

2591
02:16:38,930 --> 02:16:41,950
I'm just going to accept these opinions.
Yeah,

2592
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:42,813
absolutely.
It's so strange that we have to very 

2593
02:16:46,451 --> 02:16:49,270
clear sides this left,
right?

2594
02:16:49,420 --> 02:16:50,253
I mean,
we even have it represented by blue and 

2595
02:16:52,331 --> 02:16:54,950
red.
I mean this goes back to,

2596
02:16:54,951 --> 02:16:57,940
uh,
the Korean version of the Yin Yang,

2597
02:16:58,330 --> 02:16:59,320
you know,
and um,

2598
02:16:59,590 --> 02:17:02,650
the Korean flag,
they have that Yin Yang,

2599
02:17:02,651 --> 02:17:06,400
but it's instead of white and black,
it's red and blue.

2600
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:08,140
I mean that,
that is what it is.

2601
02:17:08,141 --> 02:17:08,974
It's these,
these opposites that work together in 

2602
02:17:11,921 --> 02:17:13,090
harmony.
It's,

2603
02:17:14,180 --> 02:17:15,013
well,

2604
02:17:15,170 --> 02:17:16,190
our society,
it's,

2605
02:17:16,191 --> 02:17:16,971
well,
I mean we,

2606
02:17:16,971 --> 02:17:20,000
it seems to be some sort of a natural 
system that we gravitate towards.

2607
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:22,330
Yeah.
And people police it.

2608
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:26,290
It's not like everyone just sort of 
chooses one side or the other and then,

2609
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:27,693
and then they go,
well I guess it makes sense that if you 

2610
02:17:29,591 --> 02:17:30,424
believe the laughed about issue a should
also believe the left about issues b c 

2611
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:37,420
through z.
If you deviate,

2612
02:17:37,421 --> 02:17:38,260
you got punished for it.

2613
02:17:38,490 --> 02:17:41,340
Well people use the term we to like 
we've got to win the house.

2614
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:43,050
I've heard that,
you know,

2615
02:17:43,170 --> 02:17:45,210
we've got to win the Senate.
What,

2616
02:17:45,270 --> 02:17:46,470
who's we?
Yeah.

2617
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:48,480
Are we running bob?
Like what are we doing?

2618
02:17:49,290 --> 02:17:50,610
But people,
it's,

2619
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:53,580
it's basically like the raiders.
We got to get to the superbowl.

2620
02:17:55,260 --> 02:18:00,260
I mean it is very tribal but I mean it's
weird because when,

2621
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:02,513
if you're in a literal tribe,
you have your territory and your 

2622
02:18:05,281 --> 02:18:09,210
resources and your,
your mates that you're defending and the

2623
02:18:09,211 --> 02:18:12,270
other tribe on the other side of the 
hill has their territory resources,

2624
02:18:12,271 --> 02:18:13,104
mates and kids and you actually,
there is a little bit of a zero sum 

2625
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:18,233
conflict.
But if you're all in the same effing 

2626
02:18:20,281 --> 02:18:21,860
country together,
yeah.

2627
02:18:23,010 --> 02:18:23,843
And you're all paying taxes to the same 
authority and you're all partaking in 

2628
02:18:27,571 --> 02:18:32,571
the same economy and you're all 
wrestling in the same public sphere of,

2629
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:37,230
of the Netflix that you watch and the 
twitter we are engaged with.

2630
02:18:39,480 --> 02:18:40,313
It's,
it should be more positive sum than 

2631
02:18:42,151 --> 02:18:42,984
that.

2632
02:18:43,340 --> 02:18:44,780
Well,
this is why I wanted to ask you this.

2633
02:18:44,781 --> 02:18:46,790
As an evolutionary psychologist,
does this,

2634
02:18:46,791 --> 02:18:47,960
and you know,
you're,

2635
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:51,410
you're obviously far more aware of this 
and the average person,

2636
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:52,273
does this just go back to the way the 
human brain developed when we were 

2637
02:18:56,481 --> 02:19:01,340
living in small tribes and that there's 
this inherent need for an us versus them

2638
02:19:01,341 --> 02:19:03,110
mentality that keeps us moving?

2639
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:04,753
Yeah,
I think so.

2640
02:19:06,270 --> 02:19:08,120
Um,
you know,

2641
02:19:08,130 --> 02:19:11,640
the people who have thought the most 
deeply about this,

2642
02:19:11,641 --> 02:19:12,474
like I'm a big fan of Jonathan Heights' 
work and the righteous mind and the way 

2643
02:19:15,271 --> 02:19:18,390
he kind of analyzes this stuff.
Um,

2644
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:25,160
I think it will be quite hard to escape 
the tribal thinking,

2645
02:19:25,380 --> 02:19:29,180
but we have,
we have escaped it with respect to a lot

2646
02:19:29,181 --> 02:19:30,380
of issues,
right?

2647
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:34,520
Where we really did,
did reach a moral common ground.

2648
02:19:34,550 --> 02:19:37,430
Like we all kind of Said,
Oh shit,

2649
02:19:37,431 --> 02:19:41,300
slavery was bad.
Women should be able to vote.

2650
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:43,353
MMM.

2651
02:19:44,930 --> 02:19:47,330
We should try to reduce the risk of 
nuclear war.

2652
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:51,860
Right.
So on some really big issues,

2653
02:19:51,861 --> 02:19:55,990
we have succeeded pretty well.
And kind of setting aside the,

2654
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:57,410
the,
the tribalism,

2655
02:19:58,280 --> 02:19:59,113
I think the problem now is there's just 
so many issues that are coming at us so 

2656
02:20:02,121 --> 02:20:05,030
fast that we don't have time to reach 
that.

2657
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:06,620
Yeah.

2658
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:10,910
Social equilibrium on,
on and off of them quickly enough.

2659
02:20:10,980 --> 02:20:11,813
Well,
this is what fascinates me by augmented 

2660
02:20:13,261 --> 02:20:14,094
reality and things like neuro link,
something that's going to accentuate 

2661
02:20:17,581 --> 02:20:18,414
the,
the ability and the power of the human 

2662
02:20:19,441 --> 02:20:20,274
mind,
where we're going to be able to take 

2663
02:20:20,980 --> 02:20:24,340
into consideration all of these things.
Um,

2664
02:20:24,910 --> 02:20:25,743
in a much like with Elan's term,
we'll have more bandwidth to work on 

2665
02:20:29,251 --> 02:20:30,150
them.
Yeah.

2666
02:20:30,550 --> 02:20:33,390
It just,
I think the more I think about it,

2667
02:20:33,660 --> 02:20:38,610
I think that this just quagmire of 
civilization.

2668
02:20:38,611 --> 02:20:42,480
There's so many different things that 
were conflicted about that really.

2669
02:20:42,481 --> 02:20:44,610
A lot of it boils down to a lack of 
time,

2670
02:20:44,980 --> 02:20:45,813
lack of time,
and a lack of also training in how to 

2671
02:20:49,741 --> 02:20:52,500
think.
One of the things that's most disturbing

2672
02:20:52,501 --> 02:20:54,960
about education,
particularly lower education,

2673
02:20:55,350 --> 02:20:58,260
is that no one ever tells you how to 
think.

2674
02:20:58,410 --> 02:21:01,410
They give you information,
but they don't tell you.

2675
02:21:01,411 --> 02:21:03,750
Now here's the tricks your brain is 
playing on you.

2676
02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:08,430
Like this is why you think certain ways.
This is if you're lucky,

2677
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:12,300
if you're really lucky,
someone teaches you about discipline,

2678
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:13,433
they teach you about resistance and 
about apathy in about about a 

2679
02:21:19,350 --> 02:21:23,040
procrastination and all these different 
games that your mind will play on you.

2680
02:21:23,041 --> 02:21:23,874
And just that alone will give you the 
ability to work through things and get 

2681
02:21:26,401 --> 02:21:27,234
more stuff done.
But very rarely does that even get 

2682
02:21:29,311 --> 02:21:30,144
discussed.
So most of the time you're just getting 

2683
02:21:32,221 --> 02:21:33,054
boring information stuffed into your 
fucking face and you barely pay 

2684
02:21:36,151 --> 02:21:39,060
attention to it enough to pass the test.
And as soon as the test is over,

2685
02:21:39,061 --> 02:21:40,090
you forget everything you learned.
I learned

2686
02:21:41,350 --> 02:21:42,980
because he really didn't learn it.
You just memorize it.

2687
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:45,033
And I wouldn't take that long to learn 
sort of the top dozen rationality hawks 

2688
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:50,193
that like the rationalist community or 
the effective altruism community are 

2689
02:21:52,811 --> 02:21:54,880
very,
very good at using and teaching.

2690
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:56,433
Like just the idea of steel manning an 
argument where you develop the ability 

2691
02:22:01,001 --> 02:22:01,834
to state the strongest possible version 
of your opponent's argument in a way 

2692
02:22:05,801 --> 02:22:06,634
that they would go.
You've said that even better than I 

2693
02:22:09,251 --> 02:22:10,510
could say.
Awesome.

2694
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:13,900
That means you really understand me even
if you disagree with it.

2695
02:22:14,380 --> 02:22:17,170
That's a good term to steel man as 
opposed to a straw man.

2696
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,750
Yeah.
And if we just taught,

2697
02:22:20,260 --> 02:22:22,630
you know,
kids in high school how to do that,

2698
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:24,093
um,
I think that would go long way towards 

2699
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:30,030
being able to have these,
these tribal dialogues.

2700
02:22:31,690 --> 02:22:32,523
Um,
or just that being able to think 

2701
02:22:33,481 --> 02:22:38,100
quantitatively about political and 
policy issues.

2702
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:41,400
Like how many people are affected,
how are they affected,

2703
02:22:41,401 --> 02:22:42,234
how much would it cost to fix?
How do we know what the best way to do 

2704
02:22:44,311 --> 02:22:46,170
it is?
Um,

2705
02:22:47,730 --> 02:22:51,690
rather than just diving straight for the
emotional argument.

2706
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:55,133
I think that would help a lot.
But is it really in anyone's vested 

2707
02:22:59,071 --> 02:22:59,904
interest to teach that and do the 
current stock of members of the public 

2708
02:23:06,751 --> 02:23:09,960
school teachers unions really have the 
ability or interest to teach that.

2709
02:23:10,470 --> 02:23:11,303
Right.
It almost seems like something they're 

2710
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:16,140
going to have to learn online and to 
augment their traditional education.

2711
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:17,273
Yeah.
So ideally you'd have like a virtual 

2712
02:23:19,261 --> 02:23:20,094
reality system where a kid could go into
it and argue about some issue like gun 

2713
02:23:24,121 --> 02:23:29,121
rights or abortion or immigration and 
some ai would sort of argue against them

2714
02:23:29,791 --> 02:23:33,210
or picking out their arguments or go 
convince me of your position.

2715
02:23:33,430 --> 02:23:34,263
Right.
And somehow or another make it 

2716
02:23:34,681 --> 02:23:35,610
interesting.
Yeah,

2717
02:23:36,210 --> 02:23:37,530
yeah,
yeah.

2718
02:23:37,531 --> 02:23:38,640
Make it fun.
Like they,

2719
02:23:40,530 --> 02:23:41,730
whatever make it,
uh,

2720
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:44,850
you know,
make it,

2721
02:23:44,851 --> 02:23:48,090
you're arguing with rick and Morty,
right.

2722
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:53,183
That is a,

2723
02:23:53,550 --> 02:23:57,990
one of the big issues with learning 
things is making things fun,

2724
02:23:58,710 --> 02:24:03,710
making things somehow or another,
a enthralling and captivating something,

2725
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:06,630
something that you actually want to 
absorb.

2726
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:10,830
And it's one of the great arguments 
about video games.

2727
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:12,113
And um,

2728
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:18,500
one of the more interesting things about
the previous generations,

2729
02:24:18,530 --> 02:24:19,363
sort of a dismissal of video games,
is that the dismissal was at one point 

2730
02:24:22,971 --> 02:24:23,481
in time,
oh,

2731
02:24:23,481 --> 02:24:25,670
you're just wasting your time.
And now that,

2732
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:28,520
that dismissal doesn't necessarily hold 
water,

2733
02:24:28,521 --> 02:24:33,440
because just like professional golfers,
professional video game players now make

2734
02:24:33,441 --> 02:24:36,350
enormous sums of money.
So it's gotten to this place where,

2735
02:24:36,380 --> 02:24:37,213
oh no,
this is a viable career and perhaps you 

2736
02:24:39,231 --> 02:24:40,064
should even be taking your kid to 
coaching and learning strategy and 

2737
02:24:43,911 --> 02:24:45,450
learning all these,
you know,

2738
02:24:45,500 --> 02:24:50,210
various applications that allow you to 
get better at these things that,

2739
02:24:50,211 --> 02:24:53,320
cause there's a real career in this and 
mean.

2740
02:24:53,330 --> 02:24:55,250
Try telling that to your GRANDPA,
Hey,

2741
02:24:55,790 --> 02:24:56,790
I'm going to play.
Um,

2742
02:24:57,140 --> 02:24:58,700
what's the,
what's the game they played for the most

2743
02:24:58,701 --> 02:25:00,830
money today?
Fortnite.

2744
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:02,290
Fortnite right?
Yes.

2745
02:25:02,330 --> 02:25:03,163
The big one that you're going to wait,
I want to be a professional fortnight 

2746
02:25:05,211 --> 02:25:06,380
player.
They would say,

2747
02:25:06,381 --> 02:25:07,680
get the fuck Outta here.
But you know,

2748
02:25:07,720 --> 02:25:09,490
I'm going to be a professional golfer.
How good are you,

2749
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:10,850
Johnny?
You know,

2750
02:25:10,851 --> 02:25:11,840
I'm an underpart,

2751
02:25:11,930 --> 02:25:13,220
eh?
Yeah,

2752
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:16,480
I want to be the next tiger woods.
Well,

2753
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:17,353
in my cohort,
a lot of other academics I've talked to 

2754
02:25:20,020 --> 02:25:21,100
like,
Hey,

2755
02:25:21,101 --> 02:25:26,101
did you play Sid Meier civilization a 
lot in Grad school or postdoc and yeah.

2756
02:25:26,650 --> 02:25:27,670
And we all go,

2757
02:25:28,650 --> 02:25:29,060
yeah,

2758
02:25:29,060 --> 02:25:29,893
most of our understanding about the 
history of technology and like world 

2759
02:25:32,871 --> 02:25:35,330
affairs and economics comes from playing
that game.

2760
02:25:35,450 --> 02:25:36,650
Really?
Yeah.

2761
02:25:36,980 --> 02:25:38,300
I never played it.
How does it work?

2762
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:43,040
Is it a one of those role playing games?
He started out in like the dark ages and

2763
02:25:43,041 --> 02:25:45,770
you progress through like Bronze Age,
Iron Age,

2764
02:25:45,771 --> 02:25:50,400
you invent railroads and then eventually
you like colonize Alpha Centauri and you

2765
02:25:50,460 --> 02:25:55,010
playing against the computer or it's the
human's turn based strategy game against

2766
02:25:55,011 --> 02:25:56,660
the computer.
Um,

2767
02:25:57,050 --> 02:25:57,883
but you kind of learn the whole 
technology tree and what everything's 

2768
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:00,793
called and what followed what and God I 
Hope said Meyer got it right more or 

2769
02:26:04,371 --> 02:26:08,360
less,
but it was a much more compelling way to

2770
02:26:08,361 --> 02:26:12,470
learn all that than like taking whatever
European history ap.

2771
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:13,393
Right.
I would imagine that's incredibly 

2772
02:26:15,891 --> 02:26:17,030
immersive.
Like how,

2773
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:19,310
how could they do something like that?
Oh,

2774
02:26:19,490 --> 02:26:20,323
the new discovery mode turns on 
assassin's creed origins is doing 

2775
02:26:22,550 --> 02:26:23,383
interactive history lessons.
It's like ancient Egypt I believe is 

2776
02:26:25,731 --> 02:26:28,490
what they do here.
And it's like deep detail,

2777
02:26:28,940 --> 02:26:32,000
really creation of it.
You go through it and they take for this

2778
02:26:32,001 --> 02:26:32,834
mode,
they kind of take all the the shoot and 

2779
02:26:34,101 --> 02:26:34,934
that's shooting but stabbing and killing
the people and just walk you through 

2780
02:26:37,671 --> 02:26:40,010
ancient and Egypt.
Cairo you get to see people die.

2781
02:26:40,490 --> 02:26:41,970
Not In this mode.
Maybe they did.

2782
02:26:41,971 --> 02:26:42,804
They might show some stuff of what not,
but so that you can either have it 

2783
02:26:45,771 --> 02:26:47,510
graphic or non graphic cause that's the 
idea.

2784
02:26:47,570 --> 02:26:49,190
Yeah.
Then they can show you through the map,

2785
02:26:49,550 --> 02:26:51,590
take you to play a video of this.
Can I watch this?

2786
02:26:52,730 --> 02:26:54,920
I think so.
I need to see this.

2787
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:57,550
I'll look it up like okay.
Yeah.

2788
02:26:57,620 --> 02:27:00,140
I mean that would be the best way to 
teach people.

2789
02:27:00,141 --> 02:27:05,030
Things do make some sort of interactive 
environment,

2790
02:27:05,060 --> 02:27:09,890
especially virtual where you could go 
there and experience it.

2791
02:27:09,891 --> 02:27:10,820
And,
and I mean,

2792
02:27:10,821 --> 02:27:14,060
I don't know if you've messed around 
with any of the htc vive things.

2793
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:15,150
Oh is this year?
So yeah,

2794
02:27:15,170 --> 02:27:17,180
it's just like a tour of the full screen
with this.

2795
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:23,030
Hello Mrs.
This is part of the game but this is not

2796
02:27:23,031 --> 02:27:23,864
the actual game.
This is like a mode they did to teach 

2797
02:27:25,461 --> 02:27:29,270
kids cause they had all of this 
technology available.

2798
02:27:29,271 --> 02:27:30,230
So they said,
you know what,

2799
02:27:30,231 --> 02:27:33,200
just get a narrator,
add some audio clips,

2800
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:36,920
making a mode.
Wow world.

2801
02:27:37,290 --> 02:27:40,550
And they even have it the way it was 
originally built.

2802
02:27:40,551 --> 02:27:44,270
The Great Pyramid with the limestone 
still attached for the most part.

2803
02:27:45,110 --> 02:27:46,970
This is a 20 minute videos.
This is like,

2804
02:27:46,971 --> 02:27:51,170
this is real deep detailed man.
He's like the best Graham Hancock,

2805
02:27:51,171 --> 02:27:53,120
you know,
explanation you could get,

2806
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:58,340
but you're the guy there and you're in a
third person position.

2807
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:00,190
You probably could go first person too,
I'm sure.

2808
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:03,980
Wow.
This is just this particular part.

2809
02:28:04,250 --> 02:28:06,170
They're going to keep doing this as 
well.

2810
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:07,273
This assassin's creed has gone through 
all sorts of different modes of history 

2811
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:12,470
through the renaissance,
Rome,

2812
02:28:13,190 --> 02:28:14,960
Spain,
all sorts of different areas.

2813
02:28:14,961 --> 02:28:18,380
And now that they sort of turn this on,
it's gonna ramp up probably.

2814
02:28:19,910 --> 02:28:22,040
Well that to me like a really

2815
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:26,150
good idea in terms of getting kids 
excited about learning things,

2816
02:28:26,460 --> 02:28:29,120
having some sort of an interactive game.
Yeah.

2817
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:32,030
Just game a game of every topic.
Yeah.

2818
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:34,250
Everything up really high quality way.
Yeah.

2819
02:28:34,390 --> 02:28:38,080
And I think the tricky thing with um,
you know,

2820
02:28:38,090 --> 02:28:43,090
education is the kind of tech that we 
use is several steps behind the state of

2821
02:28:44,031 --> 02:28:44,864
the art in Hollywood.
Special effects or documentaries or 

2822
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:51,680
this,
this kind of game.

2823
02:28:51,681 --> 02:28:55,520
So the students are kind of disappointed
when they come to class.

2824
02:28:55,720 --> 02:28:56,553
Right?
Right.

2825
02:28:56,570 --> 02:29:01,570
And it's like college is really 
expensive and it's really retro grade in

2826
02:29:02,331 --> 02:29:05,540
terms of the tech quality.
So why,

2827
02:29:06,860 --> 02:29:09,500
why are we here?
Um,

2828
02:29:10,370 --> 02:29:12,890
we should be on the forefront,
right.

2829
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:13,783
It should be possible to go to your 
State University and see awesome 

2830
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:21,860
gamified interactive stuff that you 
don't have access to at home.

2831
02:29:22,010 --> 02:29:22,843
But everything is changing so fast.
And in order for the curriculum to keep 

2832
02:29:26,391 --> 02:29:29,360
up with modern technology,
it would have to revamp every year.

2833
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:31,101
Well,
I mean,

2834
02:29:31,101 --> 02:29:36,101
a lot of the content we teach is pretty 
old actually.

2835
02:29:36,830 --> 02:29:39,320
Like the key ideas and evolutionary 
biology.

2836
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,630
Many of them go back 50 or a hundred 
years.

2837
02:29:42,890 --> 02:29:43,723
Um,
key ideas in animal behavior or 

2838
02:29:45,350 --> 02:29:48,650
paleontology or,
um,

2839
02:29:48,770 --> 02:29:49,603
anthropology.
It's not like those get updated that 

2840
02:29:52,281 --> 02:29:55,640
fast.
It's just the way you can present them.

2841
02:29:55,641 --> 02:29:56,474
Technically

2842
02:29:58,390 --> 02:29:59,680
we're,
we're not competitive.

2843
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:01,920
Yeah.

2844
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:02,753
And that's embarrassing.
Is there a way to change that or is 

2845
02:30:06,511 --> 02:30:09,210
that,
that seems almost insurmountable without

2846
02:30:09,211 --> 02:30:10,620
a complete overhaul.
The system,

2847
02:30:11,340 --> 02:30:16,340
I think you need a totally different 
kind of university and credential that's

2848
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:22,120
backed by a significant amount of 
capital and that's technology,

2849
02:30:22,320 --> 02:30:23,790
technological,
innovative,

2850
02:30:23,820 --> 02:30:28,620
and it's very on pc in terms of what it 
teaches and how it teaches.

2851
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:29,633
Do you think that's possible that would 
come along and compete with the 

2852
02:30:32,161 --> 02:30:33,420
standard?
Yes.

2853
02:30:33,480 --> 02:30:34,313
Yeah.
I think it's inevitable that that will 

2854
02:30:35,761 --> 02:30:39,030
happen and then that's probably going to
be what bankrupts and I think it's going

2855
02:30:39,031 --> 02:30:39,930
to eat our lunch.

2856
02:30:42,190 --> 02:30:43,350
Yeah.
What do you,

2857
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:46,140
how do you feel about that though?
As a person who makes their living?

2858
02:30:46,141 --> 02:30:46,421
Do,
I mean,

2859
02:30:46,421 --> 02:30:50,460
I'll see you write books and I'd be 
happy to jump ship and go do that.

2860
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:52,290
What did you oh yeah.
Good for you.

2861
02:30:52,350 --> 02:30:53,183
If I could like teach hundreds of 
thousands or millions of people rather 

2862
02:30:56,521 --> 02:30:57,354
than write 200 at a time.
Well that's essentially what Jordan 

2863
02:31:00,390 --> 02:31:01,223
Peterson is doing.
Yeah,

2864
02:31:01,350 --> 02:31:02,183
exactly.
But he's not doing it through a virtual 

2865
02:31:03,631 --> 02:31:06,000
thing.
He's doing it through video lectures and

2866
02:31:06,001 --> 02:31:06,834
then physical lectures.
It's really fascinating to see the 

2867
02:31:10,171 --> 02:31:11,004
reaction to him.
And now to Sam Harris is doing this as 

2868
02:31:12,931 --> 02:31:14,430
well,
but not the videos,

2869
02:31:14,431 --> 02:31:18,960
but he's definitely doing the uh,
the live sort of performances.

2870
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:20,693
And

2871
02:31:20,910 --> 02:31:22,530
No,
who would've ever thought there would be

2872
02:31:22,531 --> 02:31:26,730
a place where public intellectuals would
go and 5,000

2873
02:31:26,731 --> 02:31:30,120
people would sell out like that and go 
to see them?

2874
02:31:30,121 --> 02:31:32,700
Like they would go to see fucking Kevin 
Hart or something.

2875
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,020
It's crazy.
Yeah.

2876
02:31:34,830 --> 02:31:35,450
Well,
you know,

2877
02:31:35,450 --> 02:31:35,900
when

2878
02:31:35,900 --> 02:31:36,733
Kenzie first started doing a sec surveys
and he would go around the country 

2879
02:31:39,711 --> 02:31:43,220
giving lectures,
like he filled up a 4,000

2880
02:31:43,430 --> 02:31:44,263
person stadium and in UC Berkeley,
just presenting the first real data on 

2881
02:31:48,591 --> 02:31:51,850
human sexuality back in late forties,
I think.

2882
02:31:51,910 --> 02:31:54,290
Wow.
And so there was why,

2883
02:31:54,291 --> 02:31:55,124
because there's a real hunger for that 
because it was something the students 

2884
02:31:57,501 --> 02:31:58,334
couldn't get anywhere else.
And the same was true back in the 18 

2885
02:32:02,061 --> 02:32:04,730
hundreds when you had famous authors 
touring America,

2886
02:32:05,390 --> 02:32:06,223
like Mark Twain or um,
many people think is the founder of 

2887
02:32:09,441 --> 02:32:10,970
standup comedy.
Yeah,

2888
02:32:11,420 --> 02:32:12,980
yeah.
Right.

2889
02:32:12,981 --> 02:32:16,310
And they would use humor like Jordan 
Peterson,

2890
02:32:16,311 --> 02:32:17,660
Sam Harris,
you,

2891
02:32:17,690 --> 02:32:18,523
um,
and they would speak in the register of 

2892
02:32:22,911 --> 02:32:26,570
the people,
not pretentious academic jargon.

2893
02:32:27,330 --> 02:32:28,163
Sam is surprisingly funny.
I told that we had dinner recently and 

2894
02:32:31,950 --> 02:32:34,080
we were talking and I said,
dude,

2895
02:32:34,140 --> 02:32:35,730
you're really funny.
Like those,

2896
02:32:35,790 --> 02:32:36,623
those little side notes and asides you 
throw out little funny quips like this 

2897
02:32:41,251 --> 02:32:44,490
is like standup comedy type stuff.
When someone will say something like,

2898
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:45,893
like even with you though,
you guys were talking about polyamory 

2899
02:32:48,810 --> 02:32:50,830
and there was he through some sort of a 
joke?

2900
02:32:50,831 --> 02:32:52,260
Like how's that working out?
Yeah,

2901
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:54,600
no,
it's a very dry humor,

2902
02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:56,070
which I love.
Yeah.

2903
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:59,070
Um,
so funny guy,

2904
02:32:59,370 --> 02:33:00,203
but that makes it more palatable.
Spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go 

2905
02:33:03,721 --> 02:33:04,470
down.
You know,

2906
02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:05,303
this fascinating technology in terms of 
video games is going to help you absorb 

2907
02:33:08,281 --> 02:33:13,080
information about ancient Egypt.
And humor is going to help just make the

2908
02:33:13,081 --> 02:33:17,280
time go by better and make the whole 
experience less flat.

2909
02:33:17,900 --> 02:33:20,660
Yeah.
So I think,

2910
02:33:20,690 --> 02:33:23,210
I think that's a future and I think 
within 10 years,

2911
02:33:23,300 --> 02:33:24,133
um,
a lot of young people are just going to 

2912
02:33:26,691 --> 02:33:31,691
realize if I can actually learn more 
from some alternative system,

2913
02:33:33,441 --> 02:33:34,274
some franchise of really good gamified 
instruction plus great presenters who 

2914
02:33:39,360 --> 02:33:44,360
have a sense of humor and are smart and,
and kind of like Hetero docs and,

2915
02:33:45,001 --> 02:33:48,180
and edgy,
they're going to flock to that.

2916
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:49,033
The main thing is that business,
that franchise would have to provide a 

2917
02:33:54,171 --> 02:33:55,004
credential that actually separates them 
from people who don't have it and that 

2918
02:33:59,961 --> 02:34:04,961
predicts performance in companies or in 
the future.

2919
02:34:05,330 --> 02:34:06,163
Right.
Cause that's the main function of the 

2920
02:34:07,941 --> 02:34:12,830
university right now is it?
It's this credential signaling system.

2921
02:34:14,270 --> 02:34:15,103
And if somebody figures out a way to 
make it so that like if you've got a 

2922
02:34:20,651 --> 02:34:22,360
degree from this,

2923
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:24,030
okay,

2924
02:34:24,030 --> 02:34:24,863
whatever Sam Harris University,
that that is really a better predictor 

2925
02:34:28,281 --> 02:34:33,200
of doing well in a job or a marriage.
Right.

2926
02:34:33,230 --> 02:34:34,063
Then a Yale degree,
then suddenly the whole business model 

2927
02:34:38,021 --> 02:34:39,460
changes for universities.

2928
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:41,160
Well,
what's really fascinating when you think

2929
02:34:41,161 --> 02:34:41,994
about the history of education is that 
our ideas about these gigantic 

2930
02:34:45,661 --> 02:34:47,580
institutions,
whether it's Yale or Harvard,

2931
02:34:47,581 --> 02:34:51,320
is that they've been long established 
and long proven and bolt.

2932
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:52,193
No,
I mean a few hundred years in terms of 

2933
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:57,060
people being alive.
That ain't shit.

2934
02:34:57,330 --> 02:34:59,720
You know,
you go back before that you're,

2935
02:34:59,810 --> 02:35:00,643
this is really,
you only have a certain amount of years 

2936
02:35:03,661 --> 02:35:05,460
where these things were even a real 
thing.

2937
02:35:06,050 --> 02:35:06,883
Yeah.
And I mean the idea that you have a 

2938
02:35:09,560 --> 02:35:10,393
teaching institution that's also a major
research institution really only goes 

2939
02:35:13,701 --> 02:35:17,150
back to post World War II.
Like before World War II,

2940
02:35:17,151 --> 02:35:19,520
Harvard was basically an elite finishing
school.

2941
02:35:19,850 --> 02:35:24,850
It wasn't a research power.
So that whole system that we think of as

2942
02:35:25,581 --> 02:35:29,660
being ancient as actually just less than
a hundred several decades.

2943
02:35:29,810 --> 02:35:30,740
Yeah.
Wow.

2944
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:32,570
Okay.

2945
02:35:32,570 --> 02:35:33,420
Yeah.
Um,

2946
02:35:33,710 --> 02:35:34,543
I think you're probably right.
I think the new things can eat the 

2947
02:35:37,971 --> 02:35:38,990
lunch.
Yeah.

2948
02:35:39,170 --> 02:35:40,003
Well that's,
it's almost like they're setting 

2949
02:35:40,611 --> 02:35:41,444
themselves up.
I mean with some of the more ridiculous 

2950
02:35:43,641 --> 02:35:44,474
and preposterous protests that go on 
where there they are just trying to 

2951
02:35:49,101 --> 02:35:52,850
silence discussion.
And even with people like Christina Hoff

2952
02:35:52,851 --> 02:35:57,580
summers who's very reasonable and calls 
herself a factual feminist and they want

2953
02:35:57,581 --> 02:36:00,500
to call her a Nazi,
it's like there's no,

2954
02:36:00,710 --> 02:36:03,680
there's no wiggle room.
You are a one or a zero,

2955
02:36:03,681 --> 02:36:06,500
you are black or white,
you are evil or good.

2956
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:07,753
And that's it.
And this inclination towards Silencing 

2957
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:14,120
People d platforming,
screaming them down,

2958
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:15,433
halting them and getting them out and 
who decides who decides who's correct 

2959
02:36:19,161 --> 02:36:19,731
and rock?
Well,

2960
02:36:19,731 --> 02:36:20,564
the only way for people to get an 
accurate assessment of who's giving the 

2961
02:36:23,721 --> 02:36:27,230
right information is to have a debate,
but to have a real debate,

2962
02:36:27,410 --> 02:36:28,243
like a real debate where people are 
allowed to express themselves without 

2963
02:36:30,410 --> 02:36:31,243
people in the audience shaking jars of 
coins and bull horns and all the 

2964
02:36:35,151 --> 02:36:39,410
nonsense and setting off fire alarms and
all these things that these children,

2965
02:36:39,411 --> 02:36:42,890
and I call them children because they're
behaving like children are celebrating.

2966
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:43,993
You know,
I'm sure you're aware of what happened 

2967
02:36:44,841 --> 02:36:47,880
at Evergreen and now evergreens,
uh,

2968
02:36:47,930 --> 02:36:51,560
Evergreen State University where Bret 
Weinstein had,

2969
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:54,230
you know,
his horrible experience with,

2970
02:36:55,010 --> 02:36:57,260
if you don't know the story,
I'll give you the brief synopsis.

2971
02:36:57,261 --> 02:36:58,094
The,
they had a day of absence where it used 

2972
02:36:59,421 --> 02:37:02,330
to be that people of color would stay 
home so that you would miss them.

2973
02:37:02,630 --> 02:37:05,510
And then he decided to turn around and 
make white people stay home,

2974
02:37:05,511 --> 02:37:06,560
make them,
force them.

2975
02:37:06,680 --> 02:37:07,880
If you didn't do it,
you're a racist.

2976
02:37:07,881 --> 02:37:09,290
He said,
that's crazy.

2977
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:10,333
Like you guys are being racist.
And they shouted him down and they shut 

2978
02:37:12,651 --> 02:37:17,420
the school down and he won a half a 
million dollars in a lawsuit.

2979
02:37:17,770 --> 02:37:19,040
Uh,
and thou,

2980
02:37:19,070 --> 02:37:23,330
the schools,
most recent enrollment from the freshman

2981
02:37:23,331 --> 02:37:26,150
class was only 300 people,
which is crazy.

2982
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:28,850
Yeah.
I'm noticing the parents noticed,

2983
02:37:28,851 --> 02:37:32,160
the students notice and universities are
so complacent.

2984
02:37:32,161 --> 02:37:32,671
They think,
oh,

2985
02:37:32,671 --> 02:37:35,160
we can,
we can do any amount of this.

2986
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:36,113
Yeah.
And the customers will still come and 

2987
02:37:37,981 --> 02:37:39,180
they're,
they're wrong.

2988
02:37:39,181 --> 02:37:43,410
As soon as there's a viable alternative 
where somebody can get a credential that

2989
02:37:43,411 --> 02:37:47,370
means something and it's cheaper and 
better and they learn more and it's more

2990
02:37:47,371 --> 02:37:52,371
engaging that hole it universities 
acting stupid about that and,

2991
02:37:55,950 --> 02:37:56,783
and you know,
denying free speech and denying real 

2992
02:38:00,301 --> 02:38:03,390
debate.
That's the existential threat to them.

2993
02:38:03,450 --> 02:38:04,283
That's what's going to blindside them.
That's what's going to kill their 

2994
02:38:07,051 --> 02:38:07,884
tuition.
It's stunning how little resistance 

2995
02:38:09,241 --> 02:38:10,620
there is to it.
Yeah.

2996
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:11,920
That you,

2997
02:38:12,050 --> 02:38:17,050
the everyone knows that the only way to 
find out whose ideas are more,

2998
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:22,070
more well thought out,
more valid,

2999
02:38:22,610 --> 02:38:25,610
more factual.
The only way to find that out is to have

3000
02:38:25,611 --> 02:38:27,210
people discuss things together.
Yeah.

3001
02:38:27,290 --> 02:38:30,230
And T for you to be able to make an 
assessment based on the facts,

3002
02:38:30,590 --> 02:38:35,590
do it in real time and based on who was 
who farms a more compelling argument,

3003
02:38:36,830 --> 02:38:38,420
who's more reasonable,
who's,

3004
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:39,553
who's taught,
who's addressing all the flaws and the 

3005
02:38:42,591 --> 02:38:45,980
problems with both sides of this and 
coming up with a reasonable conclusion.

3006
02:38:45,981 --> 02:38:46,814
The only way to do that as discourse.
We all know that and we've known that 

3007
02:38:49,701 --> 02:38:50,690
forever,
but,

3008
02:38:50,930 --> 02:38:51,763
but somehow or another in higher 
universities in higher education 

3009
02:38:55,521 --> 02:38:56,354
centers,
this is where they're shutting this 

3010
02:38:58,731 --> 02:39:01,250
stuff down and they want to,
you know,

3011
02:39:01,251 --> 02:39:02,084
whatever,
whether it's Ben Shapiro is speaking or 

3012
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:05,930
whoever it is,
it's speaking,

3013
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:09,290
they want to scream at them,
they want to yell,

3014
02:39:09,350 --> 02:39:12,620
they want to break windows,
they want to co you know,

3015
02:39:12,660 --> 02:39:14,780
column racists or whatever they want to 
call them.

3016
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:16,753
Stunning.

3017
02:39:16,930 --> 02:39:17,763
I mean,
the way I think of it is like standup 

3018
02:39:20,170 --> 02:39:21,510
comedy.
I love and,

3019
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:22,453
and you know,
you do and the stuff you can say when 

3020
02:39:25,901 --> 02:39:30,901
you're on stage doing standup comedy 
university should be at least that open.

3021
02:39:32,530 --> 02:39:33,363
Like I should be able to lecture in a 
way that goes even a little bit edgier 

3022
02:39:37,180 --> 02:39:40,180
than most standup comedy could go 
politically,

3023
02:39:40,181 --> 02:39:42,790
intellectually,
ideologically challenged the thoughts,

3024
02:39:43,210 --> 02:39:46,690
challenged their thoughts.
So universities should be like the inner

3025
02:39:46,691 --> 02:39:47,524
sanctum of intellectual freedom compared
to which everything else is more 

3026
02:39:53,081 --> 02:39:56,890
restrained.
And we're kind of the opposite.

3027
02:39:58,270 --> 02:40:01,840
Like,
I know a few academics who go,

3028
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:07,000
who actually are like amateur standup 
comedians and it's so liberating to them

3029
02:40:08,380 --> 02:40:12,070
to be able to get up on a stage and say 
what they really think.

3030
02:40:12,430 --> 02:40:13,560
Dev Use fake names.

3031
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:14,903
Um,

3032
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:19,753
no,
but they're kind of protected by like 

3033
02:40:23,961 --> 02:40:26,270
the social norms of comedy,
right?

3034
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:26,961
Like,
you know,

3035
02:40:26,961 --> 02:40:29,450
you're not supposed to really take it 
very seriously.

3036
02:40:30,260 --> 02:40:32,690
Um,
but we're,

3037
02:40:32,691 --> 02:40:33,524
we're so far from that and you know,
in physics it doesn't matter that much 

3038
02:40:41,090 --> 02:40:41,923
because it's not like there's any 
aspects of quantum mechanics that are 

3039
02:40:45,351 --> 02:40:46,184
that intellectually edgy,
but man and psychology and the social 

3040
02:40:50,151 --> 02:40:50,984
sciences and behavioral sciences and in 
political science it's really important 

3041
02:40:55,581 --> 02:41:00,581
to be able to be provocative and 
authentic and,

3042
02:41:01,970 --> 02:41:04,790
and we can't in America at the moment,

3043
02:41:06,580 --> 02:41:07,413
well,
which is really what's going to set up 

3044
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:10,593
whatever's coming next.
It's going to offer some sort of a new 

3045
02:41:14,200 --> 02:41:16,750
new pathway,
new avenue that's not restricted.

3046
02:41:17,110 --> 02:41:17,943
Yeah.
Much like what you're seeing with a 

3047
02:41:20,110 --> 02:41:23,860
podcasts and blogs and all in,
in comparison to,

3048
02:41:24,100 --> 02:41:24,933
or youtube videos in comparison to what 
you're getting on regular network 

3049
02:41:26,951 --> 02:41:28,900
television mean it was network 
television.

3050
02:41:29,170 --> 02:41:31,150
And then cable was the more edgy 
alternative,

3051
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:33,890
and then there was pay cable like Hbo,
like,

3052
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:34,733
Oh my God,
I saw breasts and then that got nuttier 

3053
02:41:36,941 --> 02:41:38,830
and nuttier and,
but then it became Netflix,

3054
02:41:38,831 --> 02:41:39,664
which is a total nother level,
and then the internet is the wild west 

3055
02:41:44,560 --> 02:41:48,550
and they want you to go back to NBC in 
the 1970s and you're like,

3056
02:41:48,580 --> 02:41:49,900
ah,
no,

3057
02:41:50,430 --> 02:41:52,050
I'm not going to do it.
No,

3058
02:41:52,340 --> 02:41:56,110
not going to pretend,
but university seemed to be stuck.

3059
02:41:56,990 --> 02:41:57,823
Yeah.
I think universities are like NBC Circa 

3060
02:42:00,681 --> 02:42:04,010
1975 right,
where they're like,

3061
02:42:04,670 --> 02:42:06,520
oh,
this cable stuff that's not really gonna

3062
02:42:06,540 --> 02:42:07,370
matter,
and then,

3063
02:42:07,370 --> 02:42:08,610
oh,
this internet and that,

3064
02:42:08,990 --> 02:42:12,720
but the Netflix of education is coming 
and it's,

3065
02:42:12,800 --> 02:42:17,800
it's going to be incredibly disruptive 
and I hope that the academic friends and

3066
02:42:20,031 --> 02:42:25,031
colleagues I have who are good and an 
open minded art ready to jump ship

3067
02:42:26,830 --> 02:42:27,663
because ultimately they're educators,
whatever form it is that what their 

3068
02:42:30,821 --> 02:42:32,560
career is.
Is there an educator,

3069
02:42:32,650 --> 02:42:33,483
just like Kyle Dunnigan is a comedian,
he takes on a new form with this new 

3070
02:42:36,791 --> 02:42:37,624
technology and he becomes a comedian 
using face swapping technology that 

3071
02:42:41,290 --> 02:42:43,930
these educators are going to recognize 
that the,

3072
02:42:44,050 --> 02:42:44,883
the landscape has changed and there's 
gotta be some sort of a new way of 

3073
02:42:49,571 --> 02:42:50,680
distributing information.

3074
02:42:51,410 --> 02:42:53,690
Yeah,
I could have good academics or like just

3075
02:42:53,930 --> 02:42:54,763
ordinary humans with their curiosity 
turned up to 11 and who have a passion 

3076
02:42:58,521 --> 02:43:02,900
for discovering new ideas and then 
sharing them with people.

3077
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:03,793
And we don't really care how we do that.
We will do it through lectures or 

3078
02:43:07,161 --> 02:43:10,520
writing books or writing articles or 
podcasts,

3079
02:43:10,521 --> 02:43:11,354
whatever works the best.
Have you thought about starting a 

3080
02:43:13,751 --> 02:43:15,370
podcast?
Well,

3081
02:43:15,371 --> 02:43:18,160
you know,
I did a podcast with Tucker Max a couple

3082
02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:18,993
of years ago,
the maiden grounds where it was sort of 

3083
02:43:20,110 --> 02:43:23,710
related to our mate book that was dating
advice for young single guys.

3084
02:43:24,340 --> 02:43:25,880
Um,
but it wasn't realized.

3085
02:43:26,290 --> 02:43:28,060
It wasn't really,
well,

3086
02:43:28,061 --> 02:43:28,894
it was figure out what women 
authentically actually one and then try 

3087
02:43:32,921 --> 02:43:35,950
to transform yourself in that direction.
So you're a better boyfriend.

3088
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:42,360
What do they want?
A women want guys who are uh,

3089
02:43:43,910 --> 02:43:44,743
well informed and know about the world 
and ambitious and capable capability is 

3090
02:43:49,601 --> 02:43:50,434
the main thing,
like competency just in as many domains 

3091
02:43:53,591 --> 02:43:55,410
as possible.
Um,

3092
02:43:55,450 --> 02:43:56,283
they want guys who were in like 
reasonably good physical shape and good 

3093
02:44:00,761 --> 02:44:05,620
mental health and um,
who can strike the right balance between

3094
02:44:05,621 --> 02:44:08,140
being kind of Nice and agreeable and 
kind,

3095
02:44:08,170 --> 02:44:11,470
but also being dominant and assertive 
and um,

3096
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:14,020
kind of high status.

3097
02:44:14,380 --> 02:44:17,050
And if that's too much to ask,
you become a male feminist,

3098
02:44:19,670 --> 02:44:21,910
just grovel,
just bend of the knee,

3099
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:24,700
bend the knee.
So

3100
02:44:26,810 --> 02:44:29,440
yeah.
And you know,

3101
02:44:29,450 --> 02:44:30,283
when I teach human sexuality,
I kind of emphasize this to students 

3102
02:44:32,631 --> 02:44:33,464
that there's a lot you can do to make 
yourself more attractive to whoever you 

3103
02:44:36,411 --> 02:44:38,030
want to attract it.
You don't,

3104
02:44:38,060 --> 02:44:40,910
it's not all limited by what traits 
you're born with.

3105
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:41,953
Well,
it's fascinating is the difference in 

3106
02:44:43,180 --> 02:44:46,720
what a man is attracted to versus what's
a woman's attracted to.

3107
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:48,940
And this is something that we just don't
like to admit.

3108
02:44:49,350 --> 02:44:50,183
Yeah.
There's a great deal of difference when 

3109
02:44:53,741 --> 02:44:55,210
it comes to heterosexuals at least.

3110
02:44:55,350 --> 02:44:56,183
Yeah.
I mean there's a lot of difference when 

3111
02:44:57,601 --> 02:44:58,434
it comes to short term mating,
like what men want if it's a one night 

3112
02:45:01,651 --> 02:45:05,400
stand versus what women want.
And if you look at long term mating,

3113
02:45:05,401 --> 02:45:06,234
like who people choose for marriage,
there's actually quite a bit of 

3114
02:45:08,971 --> 02:45:09,804
convergence there.
Like everybody wants someone who's 

3115
02:45:12,810 --> 02:45:13,643
mentally healthy and reliable and smart 
and kind and would make like would pick 

3116
02:45:20,521 --> 02:45:22,040
the kids up on time from school.
Yes,

3117
02:45:22,060 --> 02:45:23,560
et cetera.
And funny,

3118
02:45:23,720 --> 02:45:26,350
funny is really important.
Bret Weinstein,

3119
02:45:26,460 --> 02:45:27,293
um,
talked about the difference between a 

3120
02:45:28,781 --> 02:45:31,870
woman who is beautiful versus a woman 
who's hot.

3121
02:45:32,680 --> 02:45:33,513
And what hot does is it gives you the 
opportunity to spread your genes with 

3122
02:45:37,691 --> 02:45:41,440
very little responsibility.
So a one night stand for,

3123
02:45:41,441 --> 02:45:45,070
I'm a girl who's hot.
You don't have to mate.

3124
02:45:45,910 --> 02:45:50,020
You don't have to like court her,
get her to love you,

3125
02:45:50,050 --> 02:45:53,200
show your virtue,
earn her respect.

3126
02:45:53,260 --> 02:45:56,260
Now he just bang her in the park like 
that.

3127
02:45:56,350 --> 02:45:59,860
That's hot versus someone who's 
beautiful,

3128
02:45:59,861 --> 02:46:00,694
who you really go out of your way to 
maybe even be a better person so that 

3129
02:46:04,631 --> 02:46:05,920
you could attract that person.

3130
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:07,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

3131
02:46:07,690 --> 02:46:10,610
If you fall in love with someone,
you want to be a better person for them.

3132
02:46:11,170 --> 02:46:14,160
But it's fascinating that there are 
these two choices.

3133
02:46:14,400 --> 02:46:16,410
And I never really thought about it 
until he brought it up.

3134
02:46:16,411 --> 02:46:17,244
But,
but they're essentially ways to 

3135
02:46:19,710 --> 02:46:22,830
distribute your DNA.
There's pathways.

3136
02:46:23,010 --> 02:46:27,570
One of them is through longterm bonding 
and you want a stable,

3137
02:46:27,571 --> 02:46:30,570
reliable woman who has a lot of self 
respect,

3138
02:46:30,780 --> 02:46:32,310
who chooses you.
It makes you feel good,

3139
02:46:32,311 --> 02:46:34,410
she choose you and the other one's a 
freak.

3140
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:39,460
Yeah.
But the fact that all different kinds of

3141
02:46:39,461 --> 02:46:40,294
people exist with all different mating 
strategies shows put each of those 

3142
02:46:43,811 --> 02:46:48,610
strategies historically and 
evolutionarily has worked like it's been

3143
02:46:48,611 --> 02:46:50,140
a valid strategy.
Yeah.

3144
02:46:50,170 --> 02:46:51,003
Cause there wouldn't be like promiscuous
men or women if that hadn't been 

3145
02:46:56,380 --> 02:46:57,940
something that worked.
Sure.

3146
02:46:58,030 --> 02:46:58,863
Right.
There also wouldn't be longterm pair 

3147
02:47:00,341 --> 02:47:03,340
bonded,
you know,

3148
02:47:03,460 --> 02:47:04,293
family people if that hadn't worked.
So I think it's silly when people are 

3149
02:47:07,781 --> 02:47:12,280
sort of dissing each other's mating 
strategies as if,

3150
02:47:12,310 --> 02:47:13,143
well there's one proper way.
And then all the other ways it sort of 

3151
02:47:16,361 --> 02:47:18,150
degenerate or reactionary or

3152
02:47:18,210 --> 02:47:19,043
whatever.
Well the other mating strategies 

3153
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:21,840
produced fucked up kids.
I mean,

3154
02:47:21,900 --> 02:47:24,930
you know the,
the hot one when you're not going to see

3155
02:47:24,931 --> 02:47:27,600
the kid,
you can develop a mess of a child.

3156
02:47:27,960 --> 02:47:29,700
And those are the ones they used to sell
cars,

3157
02:47:30,580 --> 02:47:32,020
right?
I mean,

3158
02:47:32,350 --> 02:47:36,010
but each fucked up by what standards.
So,

3159
02:47:36,430 --> 02:47:38,800
well there's dots,
the question father around,

3160
02:47:38,830 --> 02:47:40,840
you know,
you have daddy issues.

3161
02:47:42,430 --> 02:47:46,150
I think a lot of that is just a way of 
kind of shaming these,

3162
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:49,090
these other mating strategies.
Cause you mean,

3163
02:47:49,540 --> 02:47:54,540
well of course you get a little bit of 
circular logic.

3164
02:47:54,761 --> 02:47:59,761
For example,
where you say this mating strategy,

3165
02:48:00,820 --> 02:48:03,520
for example,
let's say a high degree of promiscuity,

3166
02:48:03,570 --> 02:48:05,020
you say that's bad.
Why?

3167
02:48:05,021 --> 02:48:05,854
Because it leads to offspring who in 
turn act promiscuous and then you call 

3168
02:48:09,851 --> 02:48:13,180
it the cycle of abuse or daddy issues or
whatever.

3169
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:14,233
But it's not a promiscuous thing.
Or is it just a longing for both a 

3170
02:48:18,471 --> 02:48:19,304
father and a mother and a loneliness and
a vulnerability that seems to come with 

3171
02:48:23,661 --> 02:48:26,480
being a,
the offspring of a single mother.

3172
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:30,950
Most people agree that that's not the 
ideal situation,

3173
02:48:31,070 --> 02:48:34,700
but it does produce unique people,
which is really interesting.

3174
02:48:34,730 --> 02:48:35,810
Like all,
most,

3175
02:48:35,870 --> 02:48:39,950
all of my really cool friends came from 
a fucked up,

3176
02:48:39,980 --> 02:48:40,813
broken childhood,
which I don't know what to think about 

3177
02:48:43,311 --> 02:48:44,144
that because I want my children to be 
comforted and healthy and never worried 

3178
02:48:51,711 --> 02:48:52,544
about the future,
but all my friends that grew up in 

3179
02:48:54,111 --> 02:48:59,111
chaotic environments where everyone was 
poor and fucked up and there's crime and

3180
02:48:59,211 --> 02:49:02,900
violence and nonsense and chaos.
Those are the interesting ones.

3181
02:49:02,901 --> 02:49:05,260
Their parents are drug addicts.
Those are the cool ones too.

3182
02:49:05,270 --> 02:49:06,860
It's,
it's such a,

3183
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:08,633
as a parent,

3184
02:49:10,590 --> 02:49:11,160
yeah.
I mean,

3185
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:15,270
so like as a scientist,
you've got to look at the whole spectrum

3186
02:49:15,271 --> 02:49:16,104
of mating and parenting behavior and go,
particularly as an evolutionary 

3187
02:49:20,071 --> 02:49:21,540
psychologist,
you can say,

3188
02:49:23,190 --> 02:49:25,710
I might have a moralistic reaction to 
that.

3189
02:49:25,711 --> 02:49:27,180
I might go,
that's bad,

3190
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:29,940
but you know what?
If it actually,

3191
02:49:30,960 --> 02:49:35,040
if what we consider bad is actually the 
way most of the other 4,000

3192
02:49:35,041 --> 02:49:40,041
species of mammals do it,
then who,

3193
02:49:40,440 --> 02:49:42,270
who were really the weird families 
anyway,

3194
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:44,370
right?
Most mammo families,

3195
02:49:44,700 --> 02:49:45,533
the dads aren't involved.
It's single moms raising offspring by 

3196
02:49:49,231 --> 02:49:53,460
themselves under harsh conditions and 
they,

3197
02:49:53,600 --> 02:49:55,710
they're not doing pair bonds.
Right?

3198
02:49:55,711 --> 02:50:00,711
Hardly any mammals do pair bonds apart 
from like gibbons and few prosimians,

3199
02:50:01,110 --> 02:50:03,570
like really small primates.

3200
02:50:04,590 --> 02:50:05,420
Okay.

3201
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:06,253
I,
I'm just very hesitant to kind of 

3202
02:50:07,321 --> 02:50:08,154
moralize it and,
but it isn't really fair or even 

3203
02:50:10,711 --> 02:50:11,544
accurate to compare ourselves to things 
that only lived to be like 10 I mean 

3204
02:50:16,071 --> 02:50:16,904
we're,
we're talking about enormously 

3205
02:50:18,681 --> 02:50:22,550
complicated emotions,
far more so because of communication and

3206
02:50:22,551 --> 02:50:24,950
societal norms and eh,
you know,

3207
02:50:24,990 --> 02:50:27,590
the comparison.
Yeah.

3208
02:50:27,830 --> 02:50:30,230
There's so much more involved being a 
person.

3209
02:50:31,530 --> 02:50:32,030
Okay.

3210
02:50:32,030 --> 02:50:32,863
It's just like,
if you look back historically right 

3211
02:50:36,460 --> 02:50:38,990
there,
premarital sex is to be demonized.

3212
02:50:39,290 --> 02:50:41,390
Right?
And folks used to say,

3213
02:50:41,391 --> 02:50:42,710
well,
oh my God,

3214
02:50:42,711 --> 02:50:43,544
you had,
you had one or two lovers before you 

3215
02:50:46,250 --> 02:50:47,870
settled on with your husband,
that's terrible.

3216
02:50:48,260 --> 02:50:50,690
And you could produce statistical 
correlations to say,

3217
02:50:50,720 --> 02:50:51,553
oh look,
premarital sex is correlated with being 

3218
02:50:53,961 --> 02:50:56,780
lower class or criminal or drug use or 
whatever.

3219
02:50:57,080 --> 02:50:58,100
I'm like,
that's all true.

3220
02:50:58,101 --> 02:51:03,101
But then society moved in a direction 
that said premarital sex is okay.

3221
02:51:03,710 --> 02:51:05,650
But wasn't that really because of birth 
control?

3222
02:51:06,250 --> 02:51:07,083
Because a woman's once,
once a woman had an ability to control 

3223
02:51:09,161 --> 02:51:12,130
her reproductive system and say,
you know,

3224
02:51:12,131 --> 02:51:12,964
I can hit,
just have sex for pleasure and 

3225
02:51:14,441 --> 02:51:15,670
enjoyment.
Yeah.

3226
02:51:16,060 --> 02:51:19,120
Because before it was the consequences 
are so grave.

3227
02:51:19,390 --> 02:51:20,930
Especially in poverty.
Yeah.

3228
02:51:21,160 --> 02:51:21,993
Like now there's another mouth to feed 
and now I can't work because I have to 

3229
02:51:24,461 --> 02:51:25,930
take care of the babies.
Oh,

3230
02:51:26,070 --> 02:51:26,810
right.
Okay.

3231
02:51:26,810 --> 02:51:27,643
Yeah.
So the technology of contraception made 

3232
02:51:29,541 --> 02:51:31,490
a big difference.
Um,

3233
02:51:31,640 --> 02:51:33,290
it used to be thought,
okay,

3234
02:51:33,291 --> 02:51:35,030
if you're,
if you're gay or lesbian,

3235
02:51:35,031 --> 02:51:35,864
that is morally degenerate and terrible 
and invalid and you can't possibly have 

3236
02:51:40,101 --> 02:51:43,340
a longterm relationship or a family or 
whatever.

3237
02:51:43,341 --> 02:51:48,341
And then we kind of changed that pretty 
dramatically in the last 20,

3238
02:51:49,310 --> 02:51:51,350
30 years.
So I just,

3239
02:51:51,650 --> 02:51:54,110
you know,
as a sex researcher,

3240
02:51:54,111 --> 02:51:56,110
I want people to

3241
02:51:57,950 --> 02:51:58,783
be quite cautious about saying that 
lifestyle is wrong and degenerate and 

3242
02:52:03,621 --> 02:52:08,621
unhealthy and this other lifestyle is 
better because in the era of sex bots,

3243
02:52:09,880 --> 02:52:11,050
right.
In virtual reality,

3244
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:15,550
deep fakes and whatever,
who knows what's going to happen.

3245
02:52:16,180 --> 02:52:17,890
Well,
if you read sex at dawn,

3246
02:52:18,130 --> 02:52:19,150
yeah.
Did you like it?

3247
02:52:20,250 --> 02:52:22,870
I had very mixed feelings about it.
What was the negative?

3248
02:52:23,620 --> 02:52:24,453
Um,
I don't think it's an accurate 

3249
02:52:25,301 --> 02:52:28,140
description of pre history,
prehistoric meeting.

3250
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:31,870
Um,
I think pair bonds,

3251
02:52:31,871 --> 02:52:34,240
Ron,
really deep and human evolution,

3252
02:52:35,410 --> 02:52:38,590
but I think as a sort of ethical ideal,
um,

3253
02:52:38,980 --> 02:52:39,813
polyamory is,
is okay and it works for some people 

3254
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:43,233
some of the time.
And this is something that you've 

3255
02:52:44,891 --> 02:52:47,380
discussed a lot.
Polyamory.

3256
02:52:47,710 --> 02:52:48,543
Um,
I really only kind of came out publicly 

3257
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:55,510
as being interested in it on the Sam 
Harris' show a few months ago,

3258
02:52:56,140 --> 02:52:56,973
but I'm,
I'm thinking about writing a book on it 

3259
02:52:59,380 --> 02:53:04,380
next and um,
it's a very popular thing.

3260
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:08,890
I mean the number of people who are in 
open relationships or poly relationships

3261
02:53:08,891 --> 02:53:11,380
is larger than the number of people who 
are gay or lesbian.

3262
02:53:11,530 --> 02:53:12,730
Certain really?
Oh,

3263
02:53:12,731 --> 02:53:13,720
for sure.
Yeah.

3264
02:53:14,170 --> 02:53:16,570
What's the number of people in gay or 
lesbian relationships?

3265
02:53:17,380 --> 02:53:18,213
Number of people who are gay or lesbian 
at the population level is like two to 

3266
02:53:22,121 --> 02:53:26,140
5% depending on the surveys in 
polyamorous relationships.

3267
02:53:26,350 --> 02:53:30,340
Um,
probably five to 15% at the moment.

3268
02:53:30,790 --> 02:53:34,450
And it's even higher among people under 
35 or so.

3269
02:53:35,110 --> 02:53:38,140
So this is a new thing.
It's relatively new.

3270
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:39,153
And is this just an acceptance of the 
instincts that people have to be 

3271
02:53:43,390 --> 02:53:47,000
nonmonogamous the acceptance of the,
that,

3272
02:53:47,130 --> 02:53:47,963
that,
that jealousy is holding people back 

3273
02:53:49,330 --> 02:53:51,310
from experiencing different things?
Like,

3274
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:54,220
yeah,
I think it's only in the 90s that you,

3275
02:53:54,280 --> 02:53:59,280
you got a coherent subculture that said 
if you're not going to be monogamous,

3276
02:54:00,311 --> 02:54:04,030
here's the honest,
ethical,

3277
02:54:04,420 --> 02:54:05,620
open way to do it.

3278
02:54:05,950 --> 02:54:06,783
And it kind of developed a bunch of 
social norms about how you manage these 

3279
02:54:09,761 --> 02:54:14,761
relationships in a way that's different 
from cheating or different from swingers

3280
02:54:15,731 --> 02:54:20,020
or different from prostitute,
hippie love communes or,

3281
02:54:20,140 --> 02:54:20,973
or prostitutes.
And I mean this is a longer discussion 

3282
02:54:24,311 --> 02:54:26,140
than we have time for probably today.
But,

3283
02:54:26,830 --> 02:54:27,663
um,
as a researcher it's a fascinating 

3284
02:54:29,201 --> 02:54:30,034
culture because it's people who are 
trying to find ways to kind of hack 

3285
02:54:32,831 --> 02:54:36,310
their jealousy and manage it better.
Yeah.

3286
02:54:36,850 --> 02:54:37,683
Um,
and it's also a new method of social 

3287
02:54:39,581 --> 02:54:41,170
networking,
right?

3288
02:54:41,171 --> 02:54:42,004
Where you're not drawing a sharp line 
between who you are sexually connected 

3289
02:54:46,991 --> 02:54:50,560
to and who you're socially connected to.
Um,

3290
02:54:50,650 --> 02:54:55,650
so people who were in depaul a tend to 
have sort of sexual friendship,

3291
02:54:56,500 --> 02:54:59,560
professional networks that are much 
broader than done.

3292
02:54:59,561 --> 02:55:03,220
A lot of people tend to have.
And I,

3293
02:55:03,440 --> 02:55:04,273
I think that's actually a little bit 
more similar to what Christopher Ryan 

3294
02:55:08,211 --> 02:55:10,590
was talking about with sex at dawn 
[inaudible].

3295
02:55:12,470 --> 02:55:13,303
Like I think in most prehistoric tribes,
anybody who wasn't a close relative who 

3296
02:55:18,291 --> 02:55:19,124
was sort of mating age,
you probably would have had sex with 

3297
02:55:21,981 --> 02:55:26,981
like sooner or later at least once,
even if you both had a sort of stable,

3298
02:55:27,810 --> 02:55:28,643
um,
paramont

3299
02:55:30,970 --> 02:55:31,803
and this is probably an incredibly 
controversial subject at the academic 

3300
02:55:38,021 --> 02:55:38,854
level.

3301
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:41,350
Well,
when I taught my course on polyamory and

3302
02:55:41,351 --> 02:55:45,310
open sexuality last year,
it got a little bit of controversy.

3303
02:55:45,670 --> 02:55:47,830
You say that with smile in the 
department.

3304
02:55:48,820 --> 02:55:49,653
Um,
well there was concern about what 

3305
02:55:52,840 --> 02:55:54,250
happens if,
you know,

3306
02:55:55,990 --> 02:55:58,450
you get complaints from

3307
02:56:00,190 --> 02:56:01,990
legislators.
Ah,

3308
02:56:02,040 --> 02:56:03,480
there it goes again.
Funding,

3309
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:05,040
yeah,
money.

3310
02:56:06,960 --> 02:56:07,793
But yeah.

3311
02:56:08,380 --> 02:56:11,140
Um,
there's a lot of cool research on it.

3312
02:56:11,590 --> 02:56:14,020
There was a lot of interesting 
psychological issues.

3313
02:56:14,190 --> 02:56:16,870
Plus if your students,
probably a good way to find the freaks.

3314
02:56:18,220 --> 02:56:20,410
It was,
they were wonderful,

3315
02:56:20,530 --> 02:56:22,530
wonderful freaks.
I mean those wrong,

3316
02:56:22,870 --> 02:56:23,703
great in a freak,
great students and open minded and you 

3317
02:56:27,551 --> 02:56:29,590
know,
we talked about the pros and the cons.

3318
02:56:29,591 --> 02:56:34,591
It's like this stuff is really hard to 
do for this and this and this reason and

3319
02:56:36,730 --> 02:56:37,563
people really only succeed at it if they
have certain kinds of traits and 

3320
02:56:41,321 --> 02:56:45,490
abilities and communication skills.
And if they don't,

3321
02:56:45,610 --> 02:56:50,610
they crash and burn and doesn't work.
So it wasn't just an advocacy class,

3322
02:56:51,190 --> 02:56:54,820
it was also like here's the pros and 
cons,

3323
02:56:54,821 --> 02:56:59,020
but also as a social trend,
this is a big deal.

3324
02:56:59,740 --> 02:57:02,860
And if you're going into one of the 
caring professions like medicine,

3325
02:57:02,861 --> 02:57:04,090
nursing,
social work,

3326
02:57:04,180 --> 02:57:05,013
clinical psych,
you damn well better know about this 

3327
02:57:08,350 --> 02:57:09,183
because a lot of people do it.
And if you're giving advice to a couple 

3328
02:57:14,350 --> 02:57:15,183
and they're in an open relationship and 
you don't even understand what that 

3329
02:57:17,891 --> 02:57:21,340
means or how it works,
you're going to give bad advice.

3330
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:24,760
And that's to me kind of professional 
malpractice.

3331
02:57:25,150 --> 02:57:28,780
Hmm.
It's also sort of in some ways,

3332
02:57:28,781 --> 02:57:33,781
an ongoing experiment in terms of how,
you know,

3333
02:57:34,631 --> 02:57:38,950
how people bond with each other,
how people form communities.

3334
02:57:39,610 --> 02:57:40,443
Yeah.
And this is in particular with in 

3335
02:57:43,480 --> 02:57:46,840
today's climate,
in today's society with the,

3336
02:57:46,870 --> 02:57:47,703
you know,
the ability to distribute this 

3337
02:57:48,191 --> 02:57:50,950
information and discuss these things in 
groups and yeah,

3338
02:57:51,670 --> 02:57:52,503
it's a different world in terms of just 
collecting data and it and comparing 

3339
02:57:56,981 --> 02:57:57,850
experiences.

3340
02:57:59,140 --> 02:58:00,760
Yeah.
It's a work in progress.

3341
02:58:01,170 --> 02:58:02,003
I mean,
I think nobody who is polyamorous or in 

3342
02:58:06,301 --> 02:58:09,240
an open relationship can pretend that,
yeah,

3343
02:58:09,241 --> 02:58:10,074
we really know how to make this work 
very well and here's the best practices 

3344
02:58:13,171 --> 02:58:14,190
and here's the,
all the,

3345
02:58:14,580 --> 02:58:18,030
the hacks and,
and anybody can do it.

3346
02:58:18,070 --> 02:58:19,590
No,
we're absolutely not.

3347
02:58:19,591 --> 02:58:23,310
At that point.
It's also brave to talk about because it

3348
02:58:23,311 --> 02:58:26,790
immediately puts you into this potential
pervert place.

3349
02:58:26,910 --> 02:58:27,470
Yeah.
Like,

3350
02:58:27,470 --> 02:58:28,303
you know,
you talk about sex with more than like 

3351
02:58:29,670 --> 02:58:30,780
more than one person.
Well,

3352
02:58:30,781 --> 02:58:31,650
wait,
what are you doing?

3353
02:58:31,770 --> 02:58:32,700
What are you doing,
Jeffrey?

3354
02:58:32,830 --> 02:58:33,780
Yeah.
What are you doing?

3355
02:58:33,781 --> 02:58:36,810
I know you're wrecking your reputation.
What are you doing?

3356
02:58:36,840 --> 02:58:39,600
You have to having sex.
I know it's super stigmatized.

3357
02:58:39,810 --> 02:58:42,840
Yeah.
But like compared to what?

3358
02:58:42,841 --> 02:58:45,540
Compared to be an evolutionary 
psychologist in the first place,

3359
02:58:45,541 --> 02:58:46,374
who does intelligence research or 
compared to teaching human sexuality or 

3360
02:58:49,651 --> 02:58:50,484
compared to doing just as a human and 
civilization doing a book with Tucker 

3361
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:54,353
Max.
I mean,

3362
02:58:54,410 --> 02:58:55,320
that's tricky,
right?

3363
02:58:56,670 --> 02:58:58,440
Um,
but I think we,

3364
02:58:59,070 --> 02:59:02,130
we have a professional responsibility,
you know,

3365
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:02,993
if you're a behavioral scientist to 
understand what are people doing out 

3366
02:59:05,731 --> 02:59:07,390
there,
um,

3367
02:59:07,740 --> 02:59:12,740
what is working and what isn't and how 
do you make it work better.

3368
02:59:16,440 --> 02:59:17,273
And the people who ignore it,
I think it's kind of like if you were 

3369
02:59:20,821 --> 02:59:22,920
like a psychologist in the early 
seventies,

3370
02:59:23,580 --> 02:59:25,410
right?
When the gay and lesbian rights movement

3371
02:59:25,770 --> 02:59:28,050
of starting,
if you'd sort of said,

3372
02:59:28,080 --> 02:59:30,660
Oh God,
I hope that'll blow over like that.

3373
02:59:30,690 --> 02:59:32,800
That doesn't deserve research.
We,

3374
02:59:32,810 --> 02:59:33,643
we,
uh,

3375
02:59:34,050 --> 02:59:36,080
we should keep it as a mental disorder.
And you know,

3376
02:59:36,081 --> 02:59:37,320
the,
the Dsm,

3377
02:59:37,350 --> 02:59:41,670
right,
I feel like is sort of at the same place

3378
02:59:41,671 --> 02:59:44,070
where,
um,

3379
02:59:44,970 --> 02:59:45,803
yeah,
there are reactionaries who go that 

3380
02:59:47,131 --> 02:59:47,964
that's just gross and disgusting.
Just like people in the early seventies 

3381
02:59:51,691 --> 02:59:53,910
would have said,
homosexuality is gross and disgusting.

3382
02:59:56,520 --> 02:59:57,031
Well,
it's still,

3383
02:59:57,031 --> 02:59:59,970
it's,
it's brave to discuss right now.

3384
03:00:00,030 --> 03:00:02,310
I mean,
it may very well be like,

3385
03:00:02,880 --> 03:00:03,713
you know,
when you're talking about the gay and 

3386
03:00:04,411 --> 03:00:08,430
lesbian rights revolution of the 1970s,
it may be 40 years from now,

3387
03:00:08,460 --> 03:00:10,320
it's just like that.
Like,

3388
03:00:10,350 --> 03:00:12,180
oh,
they're this and this.

3389
03:00:12,181 --> 03:00:13,260
Is that normal?
No,

3390
03:00:13,261 --> 03:00:16,260
who cares?
But in today's Day and age,

3391
03:00:16,261 --> 03:00:19,950
it's a tread carefully.
Right?

3392
03:00:20,610 --> 03:00:21,443
Well,
somebody's got to research it and talk 

3393
03:00:24,931 --> 03:00:25,764
about it.
Yeah.

3394
03:00:26,340 --> 03:00:27,173
And um,
I think like people should read sex at 

3395
03:00:31,531 --> 03:00:32,640
dawn Bicros,
Christopher Orion.

3396
03:00:32,641 --> 03:00:37,641
But that shouldn't be the final word 
about human evolution and polyamory.

3397
03:00:38,910 --> 03:00:41,850
What's another good book on it?
I mean,

3398
03:00:41,851 --> 03:00:46,380
the ethical slut is a good kind of,
that sounds like a restaurant.

3399
03:00:48,930 --> 03:00:50,430
I mean,
it's kind of the Poly Bible.

3400
03:00:50,680 --> 03:00:52,920
Is it really the ethical slut?
I love it.

3401
03:00:52,940 --> 03:00:53,773
It's a,
it's a,

3402
03:00:53,850 --> 03:00:55,920
that um,
dossie eat,

3403
03:00:56,660 --> 03:00:58,110
uh,
what's her name?

3404
03:00:58,470 --> 03:00:59,560
Eaten,
I think,

3405
03:00:59,920 --> 03:00:59,980
I

3406
03:00:59,980 --> 03:01:01,690
can't remember.
She's got a coauthor.

3407
03:01:02,250 --> 03:01:05,260
It's slot.
It's been right now I know it was a poly

3408
03:01:05,261 --> 03:01:07,180
Bible for 20.
Everybody buys that book just,

3409
03:01:07,181 --> 03:01:09,010
just to have it on your shelf.
I have,

3410
03:01:09,011 --> 03:01:13,150
that book sells a billion copies.
It's done pretty well at there.

3411
03:01:13,151 --> 03:01:14,320
It is.
The ethical slut.

3412
03:01:14,530 --> 03:01:16,960
Yeah.
Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy.

3413
03:01:17,830 --> 03:01:21,520
What a great name for a book.
I'm sad that I never came up with that.

3414
03:01:23,450 --> 03:01:28,450
It's a good title,
but I don't think there's a good book.

3415
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:32,320
Yeah.
That's actually savvy about evolutionary

3416
03:01:32,321 --> 03:01:37,321
psychology and human sexuality and 
polyamory and how it's all going to play

3417
03:01:38,201 --> 03:01:39,034
out in the next 10 years or so.
And this is why you were kind of 

3418
03:01:41,530 --> 03:01:42,610
planning,
writing it yourself.

3419
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:43,510
Yeah,
yeah,

3420
03:01:43,690 --> 03:01:44,171
yeah.
Well,

3421
03:01:44,171 --> 03:01:45,004
I hope you do,
man.

3422
03:01:45,250 --> 03:01:47,140
Thanks.
And thanks for coming here.

3423
03:01:47,200 --> 03:01:48,400
It's a lot of fun.
It's been a pleasure.

3424
03:01:48,440 --> 03:01:49,600
We had,
we talked for three hours.

3425
03:01:49,601 --> 03:01:50,740
Can you believe that?
Oh my God.

3426
03:01:51,020 --> 03:01:52,750
Yeah.
We did time warp in this room.

3427
03:01:53,080 --> 03:01:54,220
Time flew.
Thank you Jeffrey.

3428
03:01:54,221 --> 03:01:55,180
Really appreciate it.
Welcome.

3429

Uh,
