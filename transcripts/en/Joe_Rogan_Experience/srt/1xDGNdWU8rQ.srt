1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,900
We are doing this show and the honor of 
Derek,

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:08,901
the safari guide who was killed by 
Cecil's cousin in Africa today will all 

3
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:15,411
day my fucking facebook has been a mess 
because of people angry at me thinking 

4
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:18,780
that I really cared that this fucking 
safari guide got killed.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,510
But Abby Martin is here to straighten 
everything out.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,150
Did you.
Did you cry when Cecil?

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,040
No,
I didn't shed any tears.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,000
No,
no.

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,150
I cried when Jimmy Kimmel cried.
Yeah.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,050
See,
these stories are just.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,220
I just feel like they're manufactured 
kind of outrage and feign outrage for 

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,220
people to just feel better.
I mean,

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,761
yes,
of course you should love animals and 

14
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:41,880
humans and have solidarity with all 
living things,

15
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,881
but it just seemed really manufacturing.
Especially when I read interviews with 

16
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:46,881
people who lived there and they were 
like,

17
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:51,351
who the fuck is cecil the lion?
Like the way the hysteria in this 

18
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,150
country made it seem like he was like 
their national animal.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,810
Like this was the lion that was like the
lion,

20
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:59,010
right?
This beloved creature.

21
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:01,320
And everyone was like,
why do Americans care so much about this

22
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:06,321
lion who no one had heard anything about
him at all until this guy killed them.

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,080
And then once we decided that there was 
a name to.

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,230
So,
you know,

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,250
then it became this big thing where I 
had justin wren,

26
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:16,920
who's a friend of mine who works in the 
Congo,

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,060
he,
um,

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,210
he builds water wells for these people 
in the Congo that don't have a fresh 

29
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,841
water.
And he said the most sobering statistic 

30
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:27,841
yesterday,
he said,

31
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:31,911
5,000
children between the age of up to the 

32
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:35,091
age of five die every day in the Congo 
because they drink dirty water.

33
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,530
$5,000
a day,

34
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,200
a day.
I can't even comprehend.

35
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:45,201
So insane.
It's impossible to wrap your head 

36
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:45,201
around.
And you know,

37
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:46,320
black lives don't matter.

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,630
Lions matter.
Seriously.

39
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,140
I mean,
when you're,

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,200
that someone else wrote a really 
poignant editorial like this African 

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,330
woman.
And she was just like this,

42
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,510
you know,
there's so much death and destruction 

43
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,510
basically because of just so many 
things.

44
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,960
Globalization,
especially with the raping of the Congo,

45
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:02,190
the civil war there.
And she was like,

46
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:06,300
but lions matter more than black lives 
and that's the absolute truth.

47
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:11,301
And I think when people can 
anthropomorphize this creature and feel 

48
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:16,251
some sort of connection to it,
you can do that about anything you can 

49
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:16,251
do that about.
We do it for,

50
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:19,850
with our dogs.
But the truth is we're eating animals 

51
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:19,850
every day.
Um,

52
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,300
you know,
it just seemed like picking and choosing

53
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,670
just because it's this majestic 
creature.

54
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,540
Yeah.
It was also,

55
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:29,541
it gives people an opportunity to be 
really angry and not think about the 

56
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,030
real problems.
Like there was all these people in front

57
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:31,510
of Cecil's,
uh,

58
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:33,010
or this guy,
the dentist,

59
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,150
a dentist's office,
and they were saying they should have 

60
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,150
his head on their wall.
People,

61
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:42,390
I would like to see his head on a wall 
like you really want.

62
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,040
Do you want a person to be killed now 
to.

63
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,770
Well,
you know what,

64
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:49,230
I actually hit me a little bit too close
to home because I saw the,

65
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:54,231
um,
this kind of wave of hysteria and like 

66
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:57,591
vitriol against this guy and actual 
lambasting him with the death threats 

67
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:01,970
over and over again.
People going in Samaritan blood on his 

68
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:01,970
office and stuff and I just

69
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,130
was really,
really horrified because I was like,

70
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:03,880
Holy Shit,
this,

71
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,110
this happened to me on a really micro 
scale with the Chris Kyle stuff.

72
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,470
I was just like getting like incessantly
peddled with death threats and that's 

73
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:13,470
awful.
It's wrong.

74
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,421
You can't do that to someone.
We're all human beings and you can't do 

75
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:22,411
that.
Even if you hate someone or think that 

76
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:22,411
they,
you know,

77
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:22,840
if you personally want someone to die,
like you can't just be like,

78
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,060
you should die because you hunted a 
line,

79
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:27,250
you should die because you were a fuck 
Chris Kyle shirt.

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,760
I just think that apply it across the 
board and this kind of online bullying 

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,361
and like driving people into a hole or 
doxing them and exposing their personal 

82
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:37,930
information because you disagree with 
something that they did.

83
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,710
It's wrong.
Mia Farrow Docs,

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,030
the dentist,
Pharaoh,

85
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,590
she put the dentist to dress online.
Wow.

86
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,520
The last person that I would ever expect
to do that.

87
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,770
That's so interesting.
That's so interesting.

88
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,450
Wow.
Shit.

89
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:55,270
To fuck with you,
Ellen.

90
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,820
What do you want for it?
It's not a joke,

91
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,960
it's not a joke to get docs and to get 
like peddled with death threats.

92
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,640
Well,
you,

93
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,680
uh,
you had the Chris Kyle t shirt the fuck 

94
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:07,680
cruise.
Carl t shirt.

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:07,720
Was that,
what did it for?

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,050
Was it the being on the show that did 
it?

97
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,180
So you did warn me.
I'm just in case people haven't heard 

98
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,180
the last episode that I was on.
Um,

99
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,890
I talked about how Chris Kyle was a 
sociopath.

100
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,540
I talked about how he lied in his book 
about,

101
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,490
you know,
killing people.

102
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,080
I'm beating dogs or horses so bad that 
his hand broke.

103
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,280
But the thing is he's lied about so many
things.

104
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:30,850
I just even tours proven that he lied 
about that fight and stuff.

105
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:33,310
So we can't really trust what he said in
his book.

106
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,310
But I think it's just odd that someone 
would lie about killing black people in 

107
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,340
Hurricane Katrina.
Like why would you brag about that?

108
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:41,830
You think that you would brag about a 
story about like saving a child,

109
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,310
but instead he talked about how he was 
actually bragging about like 

110
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,570
slaughtering people who release,
which is super fucking weird or stealing

111
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:53,920
things super fucking weird and I just 
want to make it very clear that I have a

112
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:58,900
lot of respect for veterans and soldiers
who choose a defect.

113
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,910
They,
there's a lot of heroic people like Ben 

114
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,450
Griffin,
special operations and in the UK who 

115
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,260
basically went to Iraq and just refuse 
to go back.

116
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:13,261
So there's a ton of amazing veterans and
soldiers who I think that should be 

117
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:17,221
praised,
especially when we're looking at 

118
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:17,221
something like the Iraq war,
which was a complete disaster,

119
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,030
countless dead,
callous,

120
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:21,160
maimed.
Now Isis is erupted.

121
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,160
So when we have these heroes that are 
mythologized in our society and when we 

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,881
have someone like Chris Kyle,
who's the pinnacle of what the hero 

123
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:31,450
should be from that war and rewriting 
the history of the Iraq war,

124
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,730
I think it's really dangerous.
So I just,

125
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,070
you know,
I,

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,080
I talked about how,
what I really felt about Chris Kyle and 

127
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,970
um,
people got really upset.

128
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,660
My friend Leo who runs this clothing 
company,

129
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,540
printed a shirt,
a one off shirt fuckers,

130
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,260
kyle,
and he was just like,

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,060
he want,
he wanted me to wear it.

132
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:49,510
I was like,
yeah,

133
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:50,140
fuck it,
let's,

134
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,210
let's take a photo.
And I posted on my instagram account,

135
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,460
my instagram account,
like doesn't have that many followers.

136
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:59,461
I was like,
I did not know the shitstorm that would 

137
00:05:59,461 --> 00:05:59,461
be in suing whatsoever.
So,

138
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,460
you know,
war the fuck Chris Collared Shirt,

139
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,420
tits out.
Um,

140
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,570
you know,
two weeks go by and I was like,

141
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:06,170
whatever.

142
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,100
Nothing happened.
I wake up to every,

143
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,920
like it almost started where I was like,
Oh shit,

144
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:17,921
this is gonna be a really good art 
project because I was getting peddled 

145
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:18,020
with like the craziest shit you've ever 
heard.

146
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:20,810
Like rape,
like genital mutilation.

147
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,820
So detailed that I was like,
is this isis actually writing these 

148
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,601
comments because it seems like these 
people actually admire racists because 

149
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,781
it's like the most grotesque disturbing 
things about my vagina and what they 

150
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:33,740
wanted isis to do to it that I was like,
holy fuck.

151
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:36,350
Like you guys must have like some sick 
admiration for Isis.

152
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,640
Don't.
When you saw that,

153
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,820
do you report those people?
So it started.

154
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,420
I remember I was going to Baltimore and 
I just was getting it so frequently that

155
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:45,380
I was like,
holy fuck.

156
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:50,381
So my instagram,
I kind of had to like make it private 

157
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:52,211
immediately because someone had gone,
like people had gone through and said 

158
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,630
we're going to put our raping shoes on 
and find you all this shit,

159
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:53,930
you know?

160
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,220
So I,
I shut that down.

161
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:57,080
And then I went on facebook and saw 
that,

162
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,430
you know,
every single art post that I had on my 

163
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:02,430
art page,
every single public.

164
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:02,430
So I had to,
like,

165
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,560
I didn't want to shut it down because I 
was like,

166
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,650
I don't want to defer to these threats,
but at the same time it was getting so 

167
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,660
extreme that I couldn't handle it,
like the volume of,

168
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,170
of death and rape threats because at 
first I was like category cataloging 

169
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,170
them and I was like,
okay,

170
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,440
I'm taking screenshots of all these,
I'm going to make this giant like,

171
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,750
like art project.
And I was like,

172
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,750
Oh fuck this,
this is like,

173
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,480
not that,
this is actually getting way,

174
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,850
way too crazy.
Um,

175
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,920
and then I got doxed by this guy.
I'm this veteran who basically just 

176
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,340
wrote me and he was like,
Hey,

177
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,940
I just posted your address and all the 
veteran and sniper forums.

178
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,300
I was like,
there's sniper forms.

179
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,900
And he was like telling people you know 
how to find you.

180
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:43,901
And then I found out that my mom got 
doxed so my mom's personal information 

181
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:47,030
got exposed.
And so luckily I was already moving in a

182
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,690
week,
but I was just like,

183
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,160
this is,
this is shit crazy.

184
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:51,710
So I tried to contact the cops for like 
the,

185
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,830
I think there was like 10 really graphic
like I'm going to come to your house 

186
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,770
this Saturday,
cut your clit off,

187
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,510
like let you bleed to death on the 
floor.

188
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:00,980
Like just,
I mean things like that.

189
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:05,981
I was like,
and it was a person's public facebook 

190
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:05,981
page.
You can see as like license plate in the

191
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:06,440
photo.
He had like a baby,

192
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,540
you know,
they're just like these people out there

193
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:13,541
who are just totally proud to be like 
completely homicidal and rapey and 

194
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,750
really sociopathic acting.

195
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,220
So I went to the cops and I was like,
look,

196
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,590
there's like five people who I know who 
they are.

197
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,880
They've said that they're going to come 
kill me or raped me or cut my clit off.

198
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,410
And I was like,
is there anything that you can,

199
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,500
you can do?
And they basically just took the report 

200
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,640
and nothing ever happened.
We were supposed to go to the FBI.

201
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,220
Didn't do it was so funny.
I called the FBI and they're like,

202
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,120
yeah.
They're like,

203
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,140
oh,
online threats?

204
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,270
Yeah.
Just go to this website and file it.

205
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Like,
there's probably so many online threats 

206
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:43,850
going on every day.
Oh my God.

207
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:45,920
Especially with killing.
Yeah.

208
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,620
I mean,
the thing,

209
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,890
the thing that was just,
it just upset me so much because people 

210
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,750
were.
People were comparing me to like Pamela 

211
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:56,750
Geller.
They're like,

212
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,621
okay,
you can wear a fuckers kyle shirt and 

213
00:08:59,621 --> 00:08:59,621
like Pamela Geller can have the drama 
Muhammad contest.

214
00:08:59,621 --> 00:08:59,790
I'm like,
first of all,

215
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,420
Stop Dfi.
And Chris Kyle was like a prophet.

216
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,160
Like,
that's insane.

217
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,600
Um,
second of all,

218
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,940
we're not talking about a marginalized 
portion of society,

219
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:12,600
which is like Arabs who are basically 
like this,

220
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
this generation's like demonized 
population.

221
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:17,400
I was like,
we're talking about Chris Kyle,

222
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,440
which is like the peak of the empire,
this,

223
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:24,441
you know,
homicidal soldier who's like glorified 

224
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:26,460
and in war propaganda and shit.
So you can't really compare the two.

225
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,420
But I just think it's really important 
to understand the real history of the 

226
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,010
Iraq war and I think American sniper 
really not only whitewashed it but just 

227
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,610
doubled down on the myth and the 
establishment chooses these war heroes 

228
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:44,580
to perpetuate.
And Chris Kyle is not a hero.

229
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,120
I think that there are countless heroes 
that we would be much more appropriate 

230
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,120
to hail.

231
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,570
Well,
it's hard too,

232
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,420
when you look at a story like the 
American sniper story,

233
00:09:55,421 --> 00:10:00,421
it's hard to figure out what really 
happened because there were definitely 

234
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:01,990
some fabrications.
So it's hard to figure out,

235
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:04,270
okay.
Military people,

236
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,880
when they retire,
they do not get much money.

237
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,430
It's,
it's,

238
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,850
it's piss poor and it's,
it's quite an embarrassment.

239
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:13,270
It's an embarrassment as far as the way 
they're treated medically.

240
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,620
Um,
the,

241
00:10:14,621 --> 00:10:19,621
uh,
the UFC has worked really hard to 

242
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:20,830
provide money for the intrepid institute
for,

243
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,550
um,
but for traumatic brain injuries,

244
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,580
which is a huge issue with soldiers 
because the medical community has made 

245
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:33,670
so many incredible advances that people 
live that didn't live,

246
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,360
you know,
30,

247
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:36,070
40 years ago.
So now these,

248
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,190
these guys are living with some 
significant brain injuries.

249
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,640
And while we were doing one of these 
fundraisers,

250
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,840
it was,
it was hitting me.

251
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:48,841
I was like,
why the amount of billions and billions 

252
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:52,530
of dollars that are spent on this war,
how the fuck could they not allocate a 

253
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:55,240
similar amount to take care of the 
soldiers?

254
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,550
Because the soldiers don't have a voice,
like nobody gives a fuck for them.

255
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,630
Nobody cares.
So when these guys retire,

256
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,500
there's not a lot of options.
And so I was trying to figure out,

257
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:10,501
okay,
why would a guy like Chris Kyle make up 

258
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:13,771
all these stories?
He was talking about shooting car 

259
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:14,020
jackers in Texas that turned out to not 
be true.

260
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,280
He said he was shooting people and 
Katrina that were looting.

261
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,670
There was all these stories that didn't 
hold water and I was trying to think it 

262
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,421
was do you that maybe this guy was 
trying to fabricate a bunch of crazy 

263
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,070
shit and put it in his book because it 
would make the book more sensational and

264
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:35,071
sell.
And this would be a way that this guy 

265
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:35,071
could provide for his family.

266
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:35,071
Oh,
you mean me?

267
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:35,490
Like,
yeah,

268
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,760
bringing it back to the human level,
I'm sure.

269
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,940
But I mean I keep going back to the 
people who just is like,

270
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:45,941
yeah,
I feel for soldiers who come back with 

271
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:46,340
traumatic brain injuries.
But I do honestly think,

272
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,240
especially,
uh,

273
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:52,270
you know,
dating a veteran who was in the initial 

274
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:52,270
invasion of Iraq and stuff,
um,

275
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,670
there are people who the military 
because they want to kill people.

276
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,550
A lot of people joined the military 
because they have no options.

277
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:02,551
A lot of people joined the military 
because they believed in the Iraq war 

278
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:06,310
and the war on terror and a lot of 
people just want to slaughter people.

279
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:08,620
And I think Chris Kyle was one of those 
people,

280
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,160
unfortunately.
Do you think you become one of those 

281
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,160
people once you get out there?
Exacerbated?

282
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,060
Yeah,
astronomically.

283
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:16,390
Yeah.

284
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,800
Once you shoot the first few people like
me and that was a part of the,

285
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,410
the movies that the first person he shot
was a kid,

286
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,700
you know,
first of all,

287
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:27,910
the movie wasn't good and I was really 
confused by that.

288
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,370
You didn't think it was good?
No,

289
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,820
that was terrible.
I thought it was a terrible movie.

290
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,390
Wasn't well done.
It was like a clunky made for TV movie.

291
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,760
It felt like to me.
Did you see it?

292
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:40,780
No,
it's not gonna.

293
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,650
It's not a good movie.
In Arusha fear was talking about how bad

294
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:47,230
it was and I was,
I thought when Ari was saying that,

295
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,570
that he was just being hypercritical.
Ari hates a lot of things and I'm like,

296
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,980
oh my God,
maybe he's sorry,

297
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,980
but our watch,
I was like,

298
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,430
this is not a good movie.
It's just not a good movie.

299
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,490
And you know,
Bradley Cooper is a really good actor,

300
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:04,840
but it was wooden.
I felt like I felt like it was just,

301
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:06,670
it wasn't,
didn't have a life to.

302
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,730
It goes to Chris Kyland and felt like it
was just.

303
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh Man.
Did he really say that?

304
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:13,990
Yeah,
that's what I was like,

305
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:16,960
oh,
he's going for it.

306
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Going for all in golf,
a Hollywood superstar who wants to be 

307
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,420
the guy.
I'm seeing the movie.

308
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,330
Yeah.
And aside from just the movie,

309
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:29,340
be mad.
I think it's just unfortunate to kind of

310
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,610
personalize this character so much when 
you know,

311
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,770
ignoring basically people came out of 
the movie,

312
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:39,771
sanding rockies are savages,
and it was all like justified because 

313
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:40,170
they're looking through the eyes of 
someone like Chris Kyle when really,

314
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:41,490
I mean,
look at Iraq today.

315
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,730
Millions of refugees,
I mean,

316
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:47,400
as I just said,
the culture is just completely destroyed

317
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:48,660
and it's like,
what about those people?

318
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,710
So it's important.
Yeah,

319
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:54,711
we can humanize Chris Kyle and of course
we can humanize every soldier that's 

320
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,580
coming back because they were sold false
pretenses to go to war.

321
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,950
But um,
I just have to feel more for the,

322
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,910
for the people who are just the 
occupants of the country and they just 

323
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:04,910
were casualties of this mess

324
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,400
should I think we should feel for all 
humans equally,

325
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,500
especially people that we don't know.
And the idea that they're not as 

326
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,710
valuable because they live over there.
Yeah.

327
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:19,030
If there was something that happened 
over here where there was a foreign 

328
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,371
invasion that caused a million 
casualties that from innocent civilians 

329
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:24,940
would be up in arms and horrified.
And I don't know what the real numbers 

330
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,610
are for the Iraq invasion because it's 
hard to figure it out.

331
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,330
There's a bunch of different argued 
numbers.

332
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,930
Let's say it's the low ball number,
which is more than a hundred thousand 

333
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,040
innocent civilians.
That's horrific.

334
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:45,580
It's horrific to think that that's the 
low ball number and the high ball 

335
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,510
number,
somewhere around 2 million Sam Harris.

336
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,710
Come on right up to this big on the low 
ball numbers.

337
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,200
Here's

338
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,210
the problem.
And I am,

339
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,340
I'm,
this is all I'm going to say about Santa

340
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,340
Ana because I know that you offered the 
debate and I really appreciate that 

341
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,340
night.
Um,

342
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,610
I really,
really appreciate you offering that 

343
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:03,610
because I know that we've been going 
back and forth on twitter and shit.

344
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,370
I've gone back and forth.
Oh,

345
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,920
like he,
he actually wrote or he,

346
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:11,921
you know,
just the firehose of bullshit saying 

347
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:13,901
that all I was saying was like 
hyperbolic sensational figures and 

348
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:18,101
stuff.
And the problem that I have with Sam 

349
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:18,101
Harris and debating him is that,
um,

350
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:21,671
I don't feel like I should or need to 
debate in neuroscience about foreign 

351
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,760
policy.
Like I don't.

352
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,850
I'm interested in what he has to say 
about like neuroscience and interesting 

353
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,881
things that are like what he studied,
but as far as someone arguing with me 

354
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:30,881
about like the US foreign policy and 
empire,

355
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,420
um,
who's a neuroscientist,

356
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:36,050
I don't see any reason that I would get 
out of that.

357
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,530
Especially someone who talks about mass 
casualties with zero empathy.

358
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Um,
I don't necessarily think he's talking 

359
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,961
about it with zero.
Empathy I think was like a stone cold 

360
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:50,531
killer was trying to be objective about 
the numbers and not interject emotions 

361
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,130
with it.
Totally.

362
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,220
But don't you think that he would say,
why would I talk to someone who was a 

363
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,350
reporter about foreign policy?
No.

364
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,430
Journalists I think are much more 
credible than just like scientists who 

365
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,360
are just jumping into mix new atheism 
movement and just being like,

366
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:10,361
let's,
let's have a giant debate all about 

367
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:10,361
Islam.
I don't,

368
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:10,361
I just don't get it.
I mean,

369
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:10,361
the,
the,

370
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,570
the information information is available
to anybody in this day and age.

371
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:16,880
Right?
It's innovate in what he is.

372
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:21,260
Maybe he has a degree in neuroscience 
and he is a neuroscientist,

373
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:26,261
but really he's an author and he 
researches things and he talks about 

374
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:29,621
things and agree with them or disagree 
with them in the way he presents the 

375
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,920
numbers and the way he's presenting 
this,

376
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,820
this argument.

377
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,300
I think there's a lot of debate as far 
as how many people died over there.

378
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,190
Yeah.
Well here's the number.

379
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,710
Here's the problem with hin is that this
is.

380
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,980
He's.
He's basically.

381
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,530
He nitpicked all my numbers saying that 
they were huge,

382
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,250
but all he did was basically site 
official casualty count numbers from the

383
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:50,240
Pentagon.
It's like,

384
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:53,450
do you think that that's the fucking 
neck or number that's way worse going to

385
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,840
the lowest ball number of casualties and
saying this is cited.

386
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:01,010
Some other people as well,
and the high number that he was citing I

387
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,690
think was around 200,000.
Right?

388
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:04,130
It was that do.
I don't remember.

389
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,860
I'm not good at recalling numbers.
I just think it's.

390
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,470
I just think it's funny that that's what
he hammered in on his meat.

391
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,110
Basically blowing up the numbers when he
basically went to the.

392
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,260
The most extreme small calculations that
have been determined by military 

393
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:21,230
personnel when,
when basically the General Dempsey said,

394
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:23,780
we don't do body counts.
That's what he said during the Iraq war.

395
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,350
We don't do body counts,
so yeah,

396
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,670
it is really hard to tell how many 
people died,

397
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:31,420
but the international business times did
a study in 2006.

398
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:33,020
It said a million were dead at that 
point.

399
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:34,820
So yeah,
it is hard.

400
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,910
I just am sending include,
but they include Shia and Sunni in 

401
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,100
fighting as well.
Right.

402
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,340
Which is a lot of it was caused by the 
Iraq war,

403
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,730
which really triggered a huge amount of 
civil unrest because there was a power 

404
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,130
going on between

405
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,130
the Sunni and the Shia,
which were was more under control when 

406
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,920
Saddam Hussein was in control of our 
rack.

407
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,700
That is calculated in that casualty 
figure.

408
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,560
That's.
That's.

409
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,970
Well,
yeah,

410
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,960
and a direct result of like a directory

411
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,230
and that's what brings it really high.
It's really bad and I think that's one 

412
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,741
of the things that he argues against 
that you can't attribute that to the 

413
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:18,730
United States military invasion because 
it's sort of a side effect of the 

414
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,550
military invasion,
the civil war that's going on there.

415
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,660
Even though all,
even though Cheney back in 2000 or 1996 

416
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:24,660
said,
this is exactly what's gonna happen.

417
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,581
If we invaded Iraq,
pieces of Iraq are going to fly off 

418
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:31,711
Saddam.
We can never out him at this point 

419
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:31,711
because this is exactly what's gonna 
happen.

420
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:31,960
So it's like,
yeah,

421
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:35,020
you can say that was just a 
happenstance,

422
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:37,900
but the truth is everyone knew what was 
gonna happen.

423
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:38,800
So you know.

424
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,960
Well,
I think that's what he's just saying,

425
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:44,360
that it's difficult to attribute that.
Number two,

426
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:47,570
what the United States is responsible 
for because it's really civil war

427
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,420
or based on a complete destabilization 
and destruction of an entire.

428
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,000
The entire pot

429
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,020
emulation and entire population that was
run by an evil dictator in his 

430
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,970
homicidal,
sociopathic sons and yeah,

431
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:05,080
I mean it was all gross before that to 
mean more people are dead now,

432
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,970
but it was gross.
Then it's gross.

433
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:11,920
Now the whole world is terrifying.
You know the,

434
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:14,050
the thing about Isis,
did you see that shit with a,

435
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:17,680
blew up some ancient structures a couple
of days ago.

436
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,390
They,
they blew up some,

437
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,530
uh,
ancient monuments.

438
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,050
Pull that up because this is fucking 
terrifying.

439
00:19:23,051 --> 00:19:27,100
They beheaded some guy who's the head of
antiquities in Syria,

440
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,480
uh,
apparently this beloved guy who just was

441
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:36,810
unwilling to bow to their demands,
they behead this guy and then they blew 

442
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:42,121
up some ancient monuments.
Some are really well preserved ancient 

443
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:43,770
structures that were,
you know,

444
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,980
archeological treasures.
They're blowing these fucking things out

445
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:48,950
of the Taliban.
Blew up all those like Buddhist.

446
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,630
Now look at this fucking unbelievable.
They released the first images showing 

447
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:59,490
the destruction of the temple in 
Balsamiq fuck off.

448
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,250
I said that right?

449
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,460
It's just insane how rich isis is.
Like they've just stolen so much 

450
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,261
equipment and money.
It's just the whole isis thing is so 

451
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:13,480
disturbing because it is like,
it's like a self fulfilling prophecy.

452
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,630
It's like everyone's wanted this,
this group of like crazy Islam as that 

453
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:20,470
we can look at and be like,
look,

454
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:25,471
this is why we need this,
like never ending war and isis just be 

455
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,381
co comes out of the shadows of like 
destabilizing an entire region of the 

456
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:28,760
earth.
Um,

457
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:32,140
and this is what happens.
It's like this is the manifestation of,

458
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,170
you know,

459
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,460
well,
this is what the tin foil hat people 

460
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,201
have always been saying.
The United States engineer's the United 

461
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:41,320
States will prop up a country,
prop up a military,

462
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:42,630
and then go in and invade them.
One,

463
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,110
we got to invade them.
They're dangerous.

464
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,450
They're dangerous because we made them 
dangerous.

465
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,070
Mean this is the

466
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,090
conspiracy theory.
Because when you remember when Obama was

467
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:54,520
on tv saying that we had to invade 
Syria.

468
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,730
Yes,
only two years ago he was ready to Bama 

469
00:20:59,730 --> 00:20:59,730
side and we were all like,
what the fuck?

470
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,810
And the United States.
Pretty much universally it was like,

471
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:04,180
fuck it,
we're not going into another place.

472
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,330
We're not gonna.
We're not gonna start another war that 

473
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:09,330
we can't win.
And then the United States backed off.

474
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,170
They just let it go,
but then coincidentally,

475
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,410
the rise of Isis,
like right when that happened.

476
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,700
I mean,
fuck man.

477
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:17,620
If you wanted to make a conspiracy 
theory,

478
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:21,280
there's no better one than the isis.
It's right in front of everybody's face.

479
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,400
It's adorable and how ridiculous it is.
Like,

480
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,260
and I'm not saying that it's a 
conspiracy theory.

481
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:31,060
I believe that this is real,
but it's amazing how quick it filled the

482
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:34,660
void left by our hysteria to go into 
Syria.

483
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,460
Like,
oh,

484
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,940
will you reduce our grass bombing and 
are they using poisonous gas?

485
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,960
That was the thing,
right?

486
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,140
Poisonous gas as well.
There's rules how you're supposed to 

487
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,900
kill people.
We'll also why his WMD,

488
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:49,000
that pretense that we should just go in 
and invade a country.

489
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:49,410
It's like,
oh,

490
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:51,070
like the Iraq war.
It's so funny because people are like,

491
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:52,450
we didn't find WMD.
They light.

492
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:55,210
It's like if we did find WMD is would it
have been justified?

493
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:57,040
Then like just because Assad is kind of 
glove,

494
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,860
is that justified to go and fucking 
invade the country?

495
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,680
It's so weird.
There was a crazy hysteria.

496
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:05,110
They'll post nine slash 11.
That was just undeniable,

497
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:10,111
there's a blood lust than America that 
couldn't be ignored and then they just 

498
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:12,910
pointed it at something.
So in Iraq and we were over there before

499
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:13,760
anybody was like,
wait,

500
00:22:13,761 --> 00:22:15,590
what the fuck?
Iraq.

501
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,370
Like it didn't make any sense like that 
had nothing to do with it.

502
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,070
Meanwhile,
Saudi Arabia,

503
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,950
which is where all the fucking hijackers
came from,

504
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:26,970
we were like,
oil money.

505
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,150
We liked those guys.
No,

506
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:28,420
no,
no.

507
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,440
I racked,
Whoa,

508
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:34,530
that guy's an asshole.
Fuck his son's a piece of shit and 

509
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:34,530
they've got oil.
Let's get over there,

510
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,310
let's go.
And then we were over there,

511
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,200
now we're in Syria with Isis and Obama 
just issued this statement saying like,

512
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,680
we can now attack Assad forces while 
battling isis if we need to.

513
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,710
So it's just another proxy war that's 
gotten completely out of hand with 

514
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,430
future.
Look at these people that were training 

515
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,380
to these FSA people and like,
I mean they're beheading people and shit

516
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:57,970
too.
They were like acting like Isis.

517
00:22:57,971 --> 00:22:59,380
I mean,
it's insane.

518
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,220
The fsn basically like training all 
these Syrian.

519
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,380
I'm like revolutionaries,
you know,

520
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:07,960
all these people in these rebel groups.

521
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,960
And then they go over either abandoned 
post after we spent a shitload of money 

522
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,800
training them to fight isis or they join
isis.

523
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,410
It's a complete disaster.
Well,

524
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:20,410
it's hard to get Muslims to fight 
against Muslims.

525
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:25,470
You know,
when their core values and their core 

526
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,050
beliefs in religion are so much a part 
of their life.

527
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:31,290
And then they have these people that are
telling them that you're supposed to 

528
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,261
fight these people that have the same 
core values that celebrate Ramadan,

529
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:35,980
that believe in hello,
they,

530
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:40,981
they,
they have the same ideas that these 

531
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:40,981
people.
I was like,

532
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:44,701
it's way easier to stick with them and 
some guy direct some asshole directing 

533
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:47,840
you mccain from mother fucker from a DC 
America,

534
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:52,841
the Great Satan.
Those fucking people that have killed a 

535
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,230
million people in Iraq or whatever the 
number is.

536
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,880
Sam Harris,
you know,

537
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,160
it's,
it's amazing.

538
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,220
It's a,
it's an amazing quagmire that we're in.

539
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:01,370
Right?

540
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,630
It's so interesting though,
when you look at like every like civil 

541
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,630
war that's happened in the last 10 
years,

542
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,680
like Libya and then you know,
you have Ukraine going on Syria.

543
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,650
Mccain is just always there playing 
poker.

544
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,400
The hands of the people on the flag in 
the fucking world.

545
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,960
You're like,
why are I doing?

546
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:19,500
Who is paying you to be here?
My favorite time when he was,

547
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,530
they were voting on whether or not we 
should go into Syria and he was playing 

548
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,140
poker on his phone number.
Hey,

549
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,160
yeah.
You're just like kicking it on his 

550
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,160
phone.
Imagine you're,

551
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,670
you're about to.
You're part of a military decision that 

552
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,301
who knows how many fucking people it's 
going to kill whether or not it's going 

553
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:40,891
to trigger world war three,
whether it's going to trigger a new 

554
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:42,150
nuclear war and he's playing poker on 
his phone.

555
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,440
He doesn't give a fuck and get a nice 
water running through his veins hanging 

556
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,850
out,
just kicking it.

557
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,630
You know,
he,

558
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:54,000
he,
uh,

559
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,130
is so adorable that he would do that,
that he wouldn't think that people would

560
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,820
know holding onto a sharpie playing 
poker on his phone.

561
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,300
He's such a piece of shit.
He actually tweeted it like someone from

562
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:08,220
his campaign,
which is so hilarious,

563
00:25:08,221 --> 00:25:12,540
like tweeted at me saying,
thank you Vladimir Putin.

564
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:18,050
I see the,
just like paying attention to what I'm 

565
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:18,050
doing.
And He,

566
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,991
like basically called me,
I was just like a report that I did and 

567
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:20,991
I was like,
thank you John Mccain,

568
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:25,251
you seen our motherfucker,
you just tweeted out a scathing report 

569
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:27,030
about your war crimes to like all of 
your stupid followers on twitter,

570
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,060
some idiot running your campaign,
like tweeted out this video that just 

571
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,060
exposed the fuck out of him.
It was great.

572
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,640
That's hilarious.
You tweeted something and he wrote it.

573
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,130
I did a giant video just breaking down 
what?

574
00:25:38,131 --> 00:25:40,410
Like a scumbag he is.
And um,

575
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,510
and he tweeted it out.

576
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,270
Oh,
so you didn't even tweet.

577
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,170
He just tweeted your video.
Wow.

578
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,060
Wow.
It was great.

579
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Well that's called damage control.
And understand you've got to ridicule 

580
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,771
the information as Vladimir Putin.
Like as if America continues his attacks

581
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,430
against me.
That's what he said.

582
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,350
I'm honored.
That's hilarious.

583
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,760
Vladimir running our t Vladimir,
running my show up.

584
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,120
Did you ever meet that dude?
You never met him.

585
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:09,860
Did it feel like drip like the fucking 
Lord Kgb,

586
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,850
mother and Dad.
I'm done

587
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,470
so funny watching him.
Every time he does like a sit down,

588
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,350
he always just says the weirdest shit.
He just like on another level,

589
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,920
like Obama tried to crack a joke within.
They're sitting at some press conference

590
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:29,921
and it's him and Obama sitting there and
he just like looks at Obama and he was 

591
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,351
like,
you're trying to make this funny right 

592
00:26:32,351 --> 00:26:35,021
now and it's not.
Or something like just like completely 

593
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:35,021
or Obama's like stay there.
Nervously laughing.

594
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:36,590
He was just like,
stop doing this.

595
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,650
These serious.
You're like,

596
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,740
okay,
kill a lot more people personally than 

597
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,230
I'm sure.
How many people you think that guys 

598
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,481
killed Obama but not with his own hands 
to kgb.

599
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,000
Anybody knows how crazy that shit is.
He doesn't.

600
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,440
How many?
How many has he personally killed?

601
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:59,160
Yeah,
definitely.

602
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,160
Apple couple.
Probably KGB.

603
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,600
CIA,
that's for sure.

604
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,920
Yeah.
I mean like at least George Bush's Dad.

605
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,410
Herbert Walker Bush was the head of the 
CIA.

606
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,860
That was a real killer.
He was a real stone cold motherfucker.

607
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,610
That's a fucking guy.
He's winking with the wrong guy to.

608
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:25,611
I don't trust that dominant left eye.
What kind of creepy shit is at holding 

609
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:26,000
the gun with the right hand?
Squeezing the trigger.

610
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,840
Like those.
I like the photo of the glasses.

611
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,580
It always shows those reflect on.
Well,

612
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,550
you remember when that guy,
who's the guy that got murdered in broad

613
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:37,710
daylight with his girlfriend,
that was a.

614
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,440
nobody remembers that.
What happens is he kill pooting.

615
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,810
People just forget your name and it just
water under the bridge.

616
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:51,110
Just vanish.
That's a fucking crazy country right 

617
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,970
now.
Roy Jones Jr is going to be a citizen.

618
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,350
Roy Jones Jr is going to be a citizen.
Apparently they,

619
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,630
this is what he said was just fucking 
hilarious.

620
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,750
He goes,
uh,

621
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,670
the people of Russia love Roy Jones Jr.
I love it when people love me.

622
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,030
It's like the dude who went to North 
Korea.

623
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:09,560
Um,
wait,

624
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,590
who was that?
Basketball player?

625
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,660
Basketball.
Well,

626
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,130
I just Roy Jones as a career over there.
He's boxed over there a few times and 

627
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,040
they like his music.
He plays music over there and apparently

628
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,020
they enjoy that music.
Yeah.

629
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,690
So junior trying to get citizenship.
They're gonna.

630
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,810
Give him citizenship.
Good friend edward snowden.

631
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,960
You get to your visa,
you get a visa for you.

632
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,920
Um,
so yeah,

633
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,830
was probably sucking some kgb dick right
now.

634
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:46,570
Keep his visa going to shit.
They make that guy do just to stay 

635
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:46,740
there.
I'm sure nothing dude,

636
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,330
they're probably just love that he's 
there.

637
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:50,820
Don't you think?
Just a thorn in the side maybe,

638
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,730
but he can't go anywhere.
I mean it's not like he can.

639
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,600
He can't go anywhere.
No,

640
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,830
he probably has to like hide wally's.
Even in Russia,

641
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,390
just for fear of american agents.
Just takIng them out.

642
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,760
Totally.
What pots,

643
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,640
what a fucking crazy life end.
What's even crazier about it?

644
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:12,000
There's not a goddamn person I've talked
to that thinks he did anything wrong.

645
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,010
Like what he did was exposed with 
careful too.

646
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,080
He was just like,
you know,

647
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,600
let all the journalists that everything 
he was just like,

648
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,210
he's make sure that there's no didn't 
matter.

649
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,850
No one's being jeopardized.
Not only that,

650
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,350
the whole remember the hope and change 
website.

651
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:30,650
The hope and change website that obama 
had wheN he's running for president had 

652
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:30,810
a whole piece in there about supporting 
with blowers,

653
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,680
transparency and supporting 
whistleblowers when he was persecuted 

654
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,590
more than any other president under the 
espionage act.

655
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,710
What happens when you get in there?
Did they just show you fucKing ufo 

656
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,840
landing on the north pole and what do 
they show you?

657
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:45,640
They show you where all the bombs are 
being planted.

658
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,670
I think that yoU're so someone who has,
who is as young and impressionable as 

659
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,731
obama that at that time,
I think he was vetted really early when 

660
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:56,780
he was at harvard and I think that um,
he just was so fucking young.

661
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:57,110
I mean,
what?

662
00:29:57,111 --> 00:29:59,390
He was barely even a senator for a term.
Right.

663
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,660
and he just gets plucked out of 
obscurity and catapulted to the 

664
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,060
president's ship president ship 
precedent ship the presidency.

665
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:10,130
And then he just surrounded by a bunch 
of fucking.

666
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:11,960
I'm not excusing him at all,
I think is a war criminal.

667
00:30:11,961 --> 00:30:16,270
I really strongly dislike obama.
I think he's like a great manipulator.

668
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,340
A bit of a left.
Everyone,

669
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,690
a little bit of a lefty there.
Astronomy,

670
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,260
martin,
but I definitely think that god,

671
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:23,360
can you imagine who was just surrounding
him at all times,

672
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:28,361
like he had hillary clinton barking into
zero mccain like these crazy neo-cons 

673
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:32,501
who are just like,
we need more war and I think that you 

674
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:35,051
saw all the neocon establishment really 
promoting obama until the Syria thing 

675
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:38,621
happened where we backed down and that's
where you kind of saw this like 

676
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:41,620
ridiculous schism where now netanyahu's 
coming to visit and it's like this 

677
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,080
crazy,
um,

678
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:43,730
where obama's like week now.

679
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,820
So that's been an interesting.
Or they basically were like,

680
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,880
they were pissed off about the Syria 
thing really well.

681
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:50,420
They were like,
look,

682
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:52,130
we're about to have a civil war in 
America.

683
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,190
Yeah,
this could get ugly if they invaded 

684
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,471
Syria,
who the fuck knows what would have 

685
00:30:59,471 --> 00:30:59,471
happened?
It would have gotten really ugly in this

686
00:30:59,471 --> 00:30:59,930
country.
The most.

687
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,990
Whoever would Be the most dominant 
militant force on the ground would rise 

688
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:04,990
to power.
Just like,

689
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,020
well,
I mean look at Libya for fuck sake.

690
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,420
Baster,
total disaster in the past or now.

691
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,180
It's a terrifying place now apparently.
So it was like,

692
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:14,840
yeah,
no one's.

693
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:16,930
I don't think anyone's really defending 
assad,

694
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,840
but it's about people's sovereignty.
Right.

695
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,200
Amazing.
That a guy like you,

696
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,050
you look at these dictators and you say,
well,

697
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,970
no one wants kadafi to stay in power.
Obviously it's bad to have kadafi there,

698
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,190
and when kadafi got killed,
first of all,

699
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:36,191
it was one of the most bizarre and 
strange moments in social media and in 

700
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:43,310
the power of cell phone videos and the 
ability to distribute information.

701
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,490
The fact that they had video of this 
guy,

702
00:31:46,491 --> 00:31:48,290
the thing that.
Yeah,

703
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,340
and a moments he's dying,
the like the moments they captured him 

704
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,190
and they're all screaming and you're 
seeing something that no one has ever 

705
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:03,131
seen before.
No one ever seen a dictator captured by 

706
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:03,200
rebels,
I guess now.

707
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,040
Yeah,
it's happened throughout history.

708
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,450
It's never been documented and then 
distributed to everybody.

709
00:32:08,451 --> 00:32:09,890
I mean,
we could all watch and we could watch it

710
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:14,891
right now.
Jamie could pull it up right now and we 

711
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,961
can kick back and just the comfort of 
this woodland hills office suite and 

712
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:19,540
watch this fucking guy get bain edited 
in his asshole.

713
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,450
Yeah,
and it's.

714
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,510
It's horrifying and especially this 
disaster porn that's put out there by 

715
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:31,041
like jay sock and this video and yeah,
I know the us didn't film the video but 

716
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:36,051
it was showed everywhere and we also 
released photos of saddam's sons with 

717
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:39,000
all the bullet holes in them on,
on tv and shit.

718
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,870
We're like,
look like,

719
00:32:39,871 --> 00:32:42,320
look what you did that's fucking sick 
man.

720
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,400
And,
and you know,

721
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,800
we can see isis videos all day long,
have these crazy hollywood style sets of

722
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,400
where people are getting beheaded and 
it's like.

723
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:54,401
And you get mowed,
jumpsuits and it's like this crazy 

724
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:56,501
fucking manifestation of like hollywood 
culture and the military industrial 

725
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:59,111
complex rolled into one,
but at the same time you have our 

726
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,400
military uploading every drone strike on
a fucking youtube channel.

727
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,210
What are the,
what the why are including the ones that

728
00:33:04,211 --> 00:33:05,270
kill civilians?
Oh,

729
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,220
aBsolutely.
Yeah.

730
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,810
It's like just in case you're wondering 
what we're doing here,

731
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:11,240
you can watch our youtube channel and 
see how the people were killing.

732
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,500
It's really Weird.

733
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,590
Well it's,
It's horrific that when you watched her 

734
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:17,590
decision making,
should we shoot?

735
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,030
Should we shoot?
Let's just shoot like,

736
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:19,290
well,
it's not like that.

737
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,350
She's like tRying to figure it out on 
the fly and then you realize like,

738
00:33:22,351 --> 00:33:24,960
this is what precision drone strikes are
all about.

739
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,720
There's nothing precise about it.
This is not surgical.

740
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,190
It's like you have a bad person that may
or may not be in this area.

741
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:37,370
You have good information that the bad 
persons in this area let the missiles 

742
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,520
fly and they fly and then everybody is 
anywhere near.

743
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:43,521
That guy gets fucked up too and we're 
Just supposed to accept that because 

744
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,460
that's just a bad person.
We need to get them out.

745
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:46,770
We need to take out the bad person.
If other bad people,

746
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,420
aren't we a bad person?
If we're killing innocent people,

747
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,360
it isn't that the whole idea behind 
shit.

748
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,620
I mean it's.
It's good to want to protect us against 

749
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,800
bad people,
but that way is bad.

750
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:04,050
Like that's a bad way,
but you're saying you have a better 

751
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:04,050
word.

752
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:04,050
No,
I don't have a better way.

753
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,540
I don't have a better way that that.
All I know is that isis has gotten a 

754
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:08,680
shitload of us military equipment and 
billions of dollars,

755
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:11,140
so maybe we should stop just a bit like,
you know,

756
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,230
all of the stuff that we've tried to 
train the iraqi army,

757
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:19,231
like this isn't working because they're 
abandoning and like isis is just taking 

758
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:22,990
large swathes of equipment and humvees 
and grenade launchers and shit.

759
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:25,930
So I mean wHen I look at stuff like that
happening,

760
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:31,290
it's just like we just need to remove 
ourselves from the situation and let 

761
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,200
like allied states that are in the area 
really take hold of whatever

762
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,460
going out the way to do it.
I mean there a.

763
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,930
Is there justifiable war in your eyes?
Like now when you look at it?

764
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Oh you mean in general.
When you look at what's going on with 

765
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:43,960
isis right now,
when they're decapitating,

766
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,701
the syrian head of antiquities and 
blowing up these ancient cherished 

767
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:50,040
monuments is they're justifiable war 
there.

768
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:55,180
Are these bad guys?
Can you go in there and stop these bad 

769
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:55,180
guys?

770
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,360
I don't think there is a justifiable war
with isis because isis was created out 

771
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,591
of the vacuum of just a large war and 
countless casualties and refugees and 

772
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,130
the civil war thing that happened there.
So I think that isis is a direct result 

773
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,000
of us military intervention.
So I think that more us military 

774
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,821
intervention to stop isis is just going 
to exacerbate the problem and I 

775
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:17,180
definitely do not think that that should
be,

776
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,950
um,
an option whatsoever.

777
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:19,990
Right?
But what do you do?

778
00:35:19,991 --> 00:35:23,080
Do you let them take over and just start
doing more?

779
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,170
This is the trick.
This is the trick is like,

780
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,530
it's always going to be something.
first it was all caden.

781
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:32,531
Now it's like,
now it's like isis is like pulling it 

782
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:34,900
people's heartstrings so much because 
they're seeing these crazy images and 

783
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,180
it's like,
how can we just sit back and do nothing?

784
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,620
The thing is there's genocides happening
in Congo.

785
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,460
Are we going to go invade and take out 
the.

786
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,210
I mean,
it's just like,

787
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:46,020
why are we picking and choosing what 
we're putting in front of the tv screens

788
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,810
and brainwashed and everyone's saying,
what are you,

789
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,930
what are you going to do about isis?
First it was fucking a bolt.

790
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:56,931
What happened to a bulla that was all 
over the fucking tv and we curate it.

791
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,910
Annuity.
There's so much going on.

792
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:02,070
I just think to hone in on isis and just
say like,

793
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:05,790
we all need to focus on destroying isis 
militarily is,

794
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:08,010
uh,
is just a farce because a,

795
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:09,960
it came out of military intervention and
b,

796
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:13,020
we're not going to fucking destroy isis.
It's just going to galvanize more people

797
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,930
to join isis.
That's why they're recruiting is so high

798
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:18,060
across the world.
People are just like,

799
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:23,061
fuck tHis.
I mean they're being drawn to isis 

800
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:26,271
because of the endless warfare going on.
So I just think I don't have the 

801
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:28,260
answers.
I do think that regional players need to

802
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:32,070
take a step in.
That means Syria.

803
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:33,720
That means you know,
Iraq,

804
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,070
people in the region that understand the
region are not coming from like this neo

805
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,340
colonial lens and just like all we have 
is military solutions because that's all

806
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:44,250
we fucking know because we're the 
fucking empire.

807
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,260
That's right.
Chris got rescued.

808
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,160
I don't think that there's any clear 
solution and I think that's a real part 

809
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,170
of the problem.
I think that everybody who looks at isis

810
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,610
decapitating decapitated head of 
antiquities and blowing up monuments and

811
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,920
lighting people on fire with slow 
motion.

812
00:37:05,921 --> 00:37:07,780
Let me just see that video that they did
where they have,

813
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:13,140
they have slow motion video cameras like
complicated techniques where they're 

814
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,980
showing these people getting lit on 
fire.

815
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:18,190
I mean what they're doing is promoting 
terror.

816
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:21,180
They're trying to scare people and 
they're doing it with these videos.

817
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:26,190
Videos of decapitations assassinations.
Isn't it weird that they put them on 

818
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,580
youtube,
but it just keeps playing them?

819
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,730
If it bleeds,
it leads as you used to be on the girl.

820
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:32,440
you know how it is.
Start a new show.

821
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,130
What are you doing?
The empire files starting in the empire.

822
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,250
Final week and a half.
Fucking at counter culture type shit.

823
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,170
What are you trying to do with this 
empire?

824
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:42,290
Files?
Fucking

825
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:47,290
dissect the empire.
TrY to strip away the layers of the 

826
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:47,290
empire.
How did we get here?

827
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,920
Where do we go from here?
How do we.

828
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,120
Where do we go from here?
MuShrooms.

829
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,710
So it's funny because I'm jumping from 
Russia state television to latin 

830
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,050
american owned tv.
Who owns this one?

831
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:05,051
So this is chavez from the grave.
50 one percent Venezuela and then you 

832
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:09,941
have a 49 percent block of like 
Argentina and I'll play in Costa Rica 

833
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:14,060
and Nicaragua and stuff.
So it's like a 49 percent owned.

834
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,530
So it's a giant latin american block 
that has telesource,

835
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,170
which is the network.
And chris hedges just launched a show on

836
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:24,740
it and now I'm launching one called the 
empire files and it's going to be really

837
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:25,850
great.
Everyone check it out.

838
00:38:25,851 --> 00:38:28,730
We have all the social media up ready to
go.

839
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,380
So what's the name of,
of network?

840
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,450
Tell us or tell us sor,
sor as you are.

841
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,120
And

842
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,480
uh,
how do you get it?

843
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,750
Do you get it online or do you get it?
Unfortunately,

844
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,600
unlike our tea,
it's not in as many households on tv and

845
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:48,601
cable,
so you can just watch it on youtube or 

846
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:48,601
if you're in latin America can watch it 
until the summer.

847
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:50,470
So the upload everything to youtube.
Well that's beautiful.

848
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,640
That's all you need.
Exactly.

849
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,700
So you just basically use them for a 
studio using using their resources to 

850
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,440
help get the information out about the 
crazy empire we're living in.

851
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,540
so like what kind of shit you going to 
do?

852
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:06,541
Like investigative reporting type shit 
going to fly over to these horrible 

853
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:06,541
places.
So yes.

854
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:08,670
InvesTigative reporting and crimea.
Crimea.

855
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:15,160
It's on the ground.
She needs to be on the ground and crimea

856
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,960
for people that don't know.
There was a report that abby was working

857
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:21,430
for rt,
which is Russia today.

858
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:26,350
She did this,
a very critical piece on crimea and what

859
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:29,600
was going on over there in the Ukraine 
and they were gonna send her.

860
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,530
They said they were gonna send her to 
cry man.

861
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:36,820
She was like the fuck you are.
I live in America.

862
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:38,900
Pitch.
Yeah.

863
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,220
Just send all vetted russians and shit 
like go over and you're just like,

864
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:43,240
here's,
you know what I mean?

865
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:48,241
I could just imagine how it would be.
It would just be like when Jeff 

866
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:48,620
Stevenson,
shane smith went to North Korea and they

867
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,690
like fake restaurant set up for them and
just set it up for you.

868
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,080
I wanted to talk about the anniversary 
of the atomic bombs.

869
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,640
Okay,
sure.

870
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,740
Um,
what do you think about that?

871
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:05,370
Well,
I think it's a fascinatinG moment in 

872
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,951
history and an amazing moment for amazes
me more than anything that we haven't 

873
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:11,560
blown up an atomic bomb since 1947.
That's the most amazing thing.

874
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,940
So somehow or another we have had the 
brains to go,

875
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:16,550
like,
what will,

876
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:17,710
you know,
what is that 60,

877
00:40:17,711 --> 00:40:20,710
70,
66 slash 68 years,

878
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,070
whatever the fuck it is,
60,

879
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,370
68 years without.

880
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,510
And he's put his fucking city.
So it glows in the dark.

881
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,610
That's kind of crazy.
That's amazing.

882
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,640
But what,
what's truly amazing is how much 

883
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,460
ignorance was involved in the testing 
process.

884
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,410
The,
uh,

885
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:42,450
the,
the initial bombs that they blew up in 

886
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:42,550
the desert where they had soldiers run 
at the bombs.

887
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,790
Did you ever see those videos on a 
little like a,

888
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,030
like the thinG where you're looking at a
solar eclipse,

889
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:51,220
they're just like,
I'm your cardboard glasses kids,

890
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:53,790
and it's like 10.
Well,

891
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:58,810
the,
they had these ones where they would 

892
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,470
blow up these fake cities and they would
have these guys in a trench.

893
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,500
They would blow up the fixed cities and 
thEy would jump out of the trench and 

894
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,500
then run towardS the blast,
which never seen that.

895
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,120
Now,
if you can find those,

896
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:07,890
jamie,
because they're,

897
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,030
they're amazing.
No,

898
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,380
theY didn't do it because they didn't 
think it was gonna affect them.

899
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,690
They were teaching them to run towards 
the blast.

900
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,300
The idea would be that this nuclear bomb
would go off.

901
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:21,301
Everybody would be disoriented and 
fucked up and that these american gis 

902
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,660
would run in there and take over.
These guys all died.

903
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,120
Not only did they die,
but john wayne died.

904
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:32,790
John the bomb killed john wayne.
If you know that no one knows that nuts,

905
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:37,850
the bomb killed the fucking greatest 
american actor of all time.

906
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:43,791
It's insane.
The bomb killed the man who played 

907
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:43,791
gangas.
Does everyone realize?

908
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:44,090
Yeah,
so this is what they would do.

909
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,970
They would all get in these trenches.
I mean,

910
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,390
these are the actual trenches.
I mean,

911
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:48,980
it's unbelievable.
it's,

912
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:53,400
it's horrific that they had these four 
fucking soldiers.

913
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,490
yeah.
It was ridiculous.

914
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,700
So they,
these gUys,

915
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,750
they're playing cards and shooter.
Some women just like john mccain and so 

916
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,560
they blow these things off and when you 
watched the impact,

917
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:11,561
look at these guys are just ducking 
their head and so they have this close 

918
00:42:11,811 --> 00:42:14,810
enough that you see the blast,
like super clearly.

919
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,660
So they have these fake bodies out 
there.

920
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:22,730
They're all like drawn japanese likes to
watch how this goes off.

921
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:28,450
They set it off and then the guys get 
up.

922
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,930
Oh my god,
oh my god.

923
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,820
It's right in front of them.
I mean,

924
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:36,800
what is it?
Fuck five miles away,

925
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,540
six miles away,
whatever it is,

926
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,440
but look at the impact,
hits them and then they're closing their

927
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:46,250
ears and then they run towards the blast
and those guys are all dead,

928
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,200
all of them,
and they died young.

929
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,350
See the blast hits some.
Look at this.

930
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,360
Oh my god.
This is all nuclear radiation,

931
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,900
intense.
Super high doses of nuclear radiation.

932
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,970
So who knows what happened and then I 
mean,

933
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,300
I'm sure a good percentage of them died 
of cancer.

934
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,720
A few outlier survive because of freak 
genes,

935
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,660
but most of those guys,
just liKe the Gipper,

936
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,190
not the gipper.
What was he?

937
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,590
What was it was john wayne.
Look at that.

938
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,540
Look at that.
They're just running toward it.

939
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,030
Ronald reagan was the gipper.
What was john wayne?

940
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,160
Fucking ridiculous.
My god.

941
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:21,070
Look at like the.
Not just the plume,

942
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,020
But those crazy late or smoke formations
to the left.

943
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,440
I Don't know what those are.
You don't want.

944
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,340
My favorite one is the one that they did
in the ocean.

945
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,530
Yeah,
the one that they didn't really know how

946
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:33,830
much of an impact it was going to have.
The fucking just tRied shit,

947
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,020
you know,
just like they tried this,

948
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,080
see if you could find the,
the video of the ocean nuclear 

949
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,220
explosions that they did.
I think they did it off of guam.

950
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,590
I think that's where it was.
I don't remember though,

951
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,000
but they,
um,

952
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,120
they had all these battleships that they
stationed around where the bombs would 

953
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:55,460
go off and uh,
when they,

954
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,940
when they did it,
everything got fucked up.

955
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,970
I mean,
everything anywhere near it got fucKed 

956
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:03,970
up.
Go for this.

957
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,740
Look at this.
Look at this comes out of the water.

958
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:11,630
I mean you're talking about like a mile 
of water straight up in the air and just

959
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,420
ignore gulfs that battleship.
Yeah.

960
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,620
That battleship got fucked up.
John lin was the duke,

961
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,130
the duke.
Oh yeah.

962
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:22,550
I mean,
well,

963
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:27,551
it went straight up and straight down,
but I'm sure it had incredible 

964
00:44:27,551 --> 00:44:30,911
repercussions,
but look at it just they have no idea 

965
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:30,911
they,
I mean,

966
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:30,920
they didn't want to waste that.

967
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,040
They would try to blow some stuff up 
underwater and wonder how close they 

968
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,100
could be while it's happening.
Turns out not close.

969
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:43,230
Well,
here's all know is that the atomic bomb 

970
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,310
would obliterate,
like incinerate tens of thousands of 

971
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:50,091
lives in an instant and that takes,
I think it's one of the greatest war 

972
00:44:50,091 --> 00:44:52,910
crimes that are perpetrated on humanity 
and I think that's one of the greatest 

973
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:52,910
crimes against humanity that's ever been
done.

974
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:57,680
And whenever I say This,
I went to Japan last year and went to 

975
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,151
the hiroshima every museum with like an 
in utero blast survivor and it was one 

976
00:45:02,151 --> 00:45:03,930
of the most intense museums I've ever 
been to because we grew up,

977
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:04,770
of course.
Yes.

978
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,870
Yeah.
So,

979
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,850
so it was his mother's stomach when she 
was right there.

980
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,480
It was just like a random chance that 
she just survived and he happens to be 

981
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:14,480
fine.

982
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,650
Um,
but it was such a traumatizing.

983
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,450
It's wicked good hearing his arm 
stretch.

984
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,600
Right.
I wish that's what it was like,

985
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,920
um,
it just really,

986
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:27,690
really horrified museum because we grow 
up.

987
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,720
That is probably the biggest myth that 
we grow up learning is that the bombs 

988
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,251
were necessary to end the war and that 
they save lives and it's just like a way

989
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:40,380
to legitimize a really,
really horrific atrocity.

990
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:43,490
Um,
two of them actually will.

991
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:48,491
The issue is that Japan was already 
willing to surrender and that we didn't 

992
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:51,360
want them to surrender because we wanted
to try the bombs out.

993
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:56,390
That's whether or not that's true.
That's the bIg debate and that's 

994
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,770
something that a lot of people still to 
this day argued back and forth on 

995
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,330
whether or not it's actually the case.
if it is the case,

996
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:06,240
it's even more horrific because just 
like what they wanted to do in the ocean

997
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:11,241
where they tried that bomb out and 
watched a mile high wave of water 

998
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:12,570
overcome that fucking battleship.

999
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,840
They wanted to see what happens when you
dropped that shit on a city and they 

1000
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,300
dropped Russia.
Their cock.

1001
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,620
Yeah.
They show.

1002
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,700
Well,
I mean it's really,

1003
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:25,701
it's,
it isn't actually up for debate anymore 

1004
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:25,701
and this is,
this is a problem.

1005
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:29,151
It's just like the Iraq war.
It's just these people kind of holding 

1006
00:46:29,151 --> 00:46:31,761
onto this last ditch like gasp of air 
just to hold onto like american 

1007
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:35,661
exceptionalism and it really just is 
totally debunked at this point because 

1008
00:46:35,661 --> 00:46:36,450
even truman himself instilled an atomic 
bomb survey,

1009
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:40,470
university of Colorado featured to and 
of just like dozens of american military

1010
00:46:40,471 --> 00:46:43,050
experts and leaders,
internal interviews,

1011
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:48,051
diaries,
other declassified materials basically 

1012
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:50,690
involved in a bomb decision and all of 
them had one unit unanimous commonality 

1013
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:54,861
among them that every single one said 
the bomb was not a military necessity 

1014
00:46:54,861 --> 00:46:58,431
and it did not need to happen for the 
surrender that Japan was ready to 

1015
00:46:58,431 --> 00:46:59,680
surrender because if you remember,
I think like 100,000

1016
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:04,700
or maybe 80,000
people were incinerated in tokyo just 

1017
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:04,700
weeks prior with the fire bombing.

1018
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:09,410
So the u s had already dropped.
All these bombs basically eviscerated 

1019
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:12,120
tokyo and so countless people died way 
more.

1020
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:15,420
People actually died.
Then in the initial atomic bomb drops.

1021
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:17,280
So it's just,
it's just a really,

1022
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:22,281
really unfortunate kind of thing that's 
perpetuated and people just still hold 

1023
00:47:22,281 --> 00:47:22,281
onto it.
You know,

1024
00:47:22,281 --> 00:47:23,130
they say it would have saved lives.
It's like,

1025
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,190
well,
it would have saved us soldiers lives,

1026
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:30,010
but instead it took like probably half a
million japanese.

1027
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:33,220
If you look at the countless maimed in 
radiation poisoning,

1028
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:36,130
I mean I think like 80,000
died instantly and with the incineration

1029
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,870
was something that yeah,
it's awful.

1030
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,980
The only argument that could be said 
that it saved lives is that a kept other

1031
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:47,890
people from using nuclear weapons 
because there is so horrific.

1032
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,400
Otherwise you look at all the war that 
has taken place since 1947 and not one 

1033
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,370
person has used a nuclear bomb.

1034
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,120
It could be argued that it was because 
how horrific that was when it did happen

1035
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:03,630
with.
That's not a really good argument and 

1036
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:03,630
it's also like irritating that the us is
the one fearmongering in the world about

1037
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,410
like he can't have a nuclear bomb.
He can.

1038
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:06,190
He can't.
AnD it's like,

1039
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:07,780
well,
you guys are the only ones who have only

1040
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:12,430
used them troll weiss.
So why are we the arbitrators of who and

1041
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,230
who cannot utilize nuclear weapons?
Well,

1042
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,910
we're righteous and plus we're one 
nation under god,

1043
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,180
chris [inaudible] and patients.
Do you.

1044
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,200
Do you know that we're under god when 
you know most people don't even know 

1045
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,520
that we became one nation under god 
after the comedy scare,

1046
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:33,570
the 19 fifties.
Really the mccarthy scares what led 

1047
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,060
them.
To add that to the pledge of allegiance.

1048
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,910
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the 
United States,

1049
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,880
one nation indivisible for liberty,
and they had one nation under god,

1050
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,660
indivisible.

1051
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,660
They had to add that to it.
They had to add that to it because of 

1052
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,210
the kami scare.
That's unreal.

1053
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,430
So 19 fifties male.
Yeah.

1054
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,890
Before that.
Before the mccarthy hearings,

1055
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:55,390
they.
They didn't have undergone.

1056
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,680
Speaking of dirty,
insane,

1057
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:03,250
insane.
What about people that believe in 

1058
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:03,250
buddha?
Right.

1059
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:03,250
They don't have the.
It's not under them.

1060
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,750
They ain't.
No one needs to be changed it.

1061
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:09,751
Then I Just assume that they're going to
change it again to one nation under 

1062
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:12,961
chris kyle is so crazy because it's 
like,

1063
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:19,681
I don't think jesse ventura got like 
threat saying they're going to cut his 

1064
00:49:19,681 --> 00:49:19,681
bull.
They did.

1065
00:49:19,681 --> 00:49:19,681
No,
he did.

1066
00:49:19,681 --> 00:49:21,220
He got a lot of the horrible death.
maybe.

1067
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,040
I'm sure if I had to guess,
that's.

1068
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:23,530
I don't know.
Man.

1069
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:25,650
I think there was a lot of like really 
don't know what happened though.

1070
00:49:25,651 --> 00:49:27,520
So explain the,
the jesse ventura thing,

1071
00:49:27,521 --> 00:49:28,900
because a lot of folks aren't aware.

1072
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,560
Obviously badass navy seal epic.
Well he was a navy seal was before it 

1073
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,750
was thought they were both.
There wasn't that.

1074
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,510
He wasn't a navy seal.
They used to be,

1075
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:42,630
it was something,
there was another name for like before 

1076
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:42,630
know,
because it was in the Vietnam era.

1077
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,950
Yeah.
I forget what I'll find out.

1078
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,540
So,
so jesse ventura,

1079
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,150
I'm total bad ass.
Like the opposite of chris kyle.

1080
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:50,890
Right.
He's like against war.

1081
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:54,130
He's really on point.
So anyway,

1082
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,280
chris kyle was ever in a movie slack 
drawn.

1083
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,100
Is that in front of me?
Yeah.

1084
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,360
Um,
so he and chris kyle's book,

1085
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:07,870
it makes up this giant bar fight that he
like beat up jesse ventura.

1086
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:09,910
And if you know who jesse ventura is,
like,

1087
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:13,840
he's fucking like a brick house.
Well he's an older gentleman too.

1088
00:50:13,841 --> 00:50:17,410
I mean born in 1951 I think because.
Sure.

1089
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:22,530
But still,
it's like if you're going to fucking go 

1090
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:22,530
out there and say that you beat the shit
out of jesse ventura,

1091
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,630
you like socked him in a bar,
a might be a bad idea.

1092
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,830
Well,
here's what happened.

1093
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:28,130
He in the book,
he

1094
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,090
wasn't referred to as jesse ventura.
He was referred to a scruffy.

1095
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:37,120
He called them scruffy and he was saying
that this guy was some celebrity they'd 

1096
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,320
beat up because this guy had said 
something bad about navy seals.

1097
00:50:40,321 --> 00:50:43,160
So chris kyle came along and socked him 
for America.

1098
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:47,450
He was a udt underwater demolition team 
is the original seals.

1099
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,550
Um,
so he said oN the opiod,

1100
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,550
anthony show that it was chris kyle,
but the,

1101
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,530
chris kyle said that it was a jesse 
ventura.

1102
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:01,790
That's when he was goated into saying 
who the guy was.

1103
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:03,530
I believe it was opening anthony.
I'm pretty sure.

1104
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,180
And I'm in that.
That's when jesse ventura said,

1105
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:10,970
what?
You didn't fucking hit me like we didn't

1106
00:51:10,971 --> 00:51:12,620
get into a fight.
What are you talking about?

1107
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,920
and jesse ventura sued him and won and 
won one point $8,000,000.

1108
00:51:18,431 --> 00:51:23,431
There it is.
Jesse ventura wins one point 8 million 

1109
00:51:23,431 --> 00:51:23,431
in damages against chris kyle,
celine,

1110
00:51:23,431 --> 00:51:28,121
navy seal sniper,
and here's the issue was that he gave 

1111
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:30,320
chris kyle the option to,
to just to,

1112
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,600
just to retract it,
admit you're wrong,

1113
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:33,990
and I'll drop the chris.

1114
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:35,300
Carl wouldn't do it.
No fucking.

1115
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,180
And then he was killed.
Chris kyle was killed by some,

1116
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,390
some poor kid with ptsd.
Poor kid,

1117
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,600
asshole murderer.
He's a murderer to another guy that 

1118
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,690
fucked up.
I mean murdered chris kyle for no 

1119
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:49,690
reason.
Said ptsd.

1120
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,570
Shot him.
Shot the other guy that was with him,

1121
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,880
stole his truck.
I mean he was fucked.

1122
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:58,010
War of that level of that scale 
obviously fucks people's head up.

1123
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,140
And when he died,
jesse ventura continued with the lawsuit

1124
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,070
and that's where he got criticized and 
that's you're assuming the widow and all

1125
00:52:07,071 --> 00:52:12,071
this shit.
And they said he was suing the book 

1126
00:52:12,071 --> 00:52:12,071
company.
He said he was.

1127
00:52:12,071 --> 00:52:13,220
He goes,
I'm suing everybody that's profiting off

1128
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:17,810
of this lie,
that scully and his take on it was.

1129
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:22,730
PEople also should be aware of the truth
of what this guy not,

1130
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:24,890
didn't just lie about that,
but he lied.

1131
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,330
I mean,
jesse ventura did several inteRviews.

1132
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:28,700
We were talking about all the different 
lies.

1133
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,390
There's more than one line that book.
Absolutely.

1134
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,160
It doesn't mean that there aren't 
heroes.

1135
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:36,020
It doesn't mean that the military is 
bad.

1136
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:39,580
It doesn't mean that there aren't people
that genuinely go into the military like

1137
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,770
I'm sure your boyfriend did,
thinking that they're going to do good,

1138
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,080
that they have these ideals that they 
want to protect.

1139
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:50,230
They want to protect liberty and they 
believe in the american way of life and 

1140
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:54,041
then you know,
it all gets convoluted because you're 

1141
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,170
either with us or against us.
You're with us or again,

1142
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,440
it's not.
It's not.

1143
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:59,420
It's not.
That's not us.

1144
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,510
What you're doing is not as lies,
aren't us murder's not us shooting 

1145
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,030
looters,
not us.

1146
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,730
Like these people are making.
These decisions are not us.

1147
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:10,550
I mean we have more in solidarity with 
the people in Iraq than we do it.

1148
00:53:10,551 --> 00:53:12,470
Like the elite that are making these 
decisions.

1149
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:13,780
Yeah.
The,

1150
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:18,170
the people that are complete neo-cons 
that are complete chicken hawks that are

1151
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:22,040
outside of the consequences of war,
the ones pulling the strings.

1152
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,280
I think that there's a big problem with 
just the militarization,

1153
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,220
our society

1154
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,030
where we have,
you know,

1155
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:29,460
every sports game has this giant 
military.

1156
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:35,140
I'm just like drama thing going on where
we pay tax payer sponsored fucking 

1157
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,580
fighter jets flying over the stadiums 
and shit.

1158
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,070
I mean,
every single thing is militarized.

1159
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,240
Um,
and we're,

1160
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:47,450
when we're conditioned in this way to 
glorify the military so much that it 

1161
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:51,891
becomes an,
especially when you're at the helm of 

1162
00:53:51,891 --> 00:53:53,691
the empire,
thAt is the largest military force in 

1163
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:53,691
the world that's consolidated like 
military super power.

1164
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:59,240
That's the only solution to everything.
A bola sending the fucking military 

1165
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,660
isis,
let's bomb them.

1166
00:54:00,661 --> 00:54:04,710
More riots in the streets or like,
you know,

1167
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:10,010
sending the fucking militarize riot cops
who just got trained next to israeli 

1168
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:10,320
troops in Bahrain.
It's like,

1169
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,980
good god.
I mean we need to start really removing 

1170
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:15,980
ourselves with this kind of 
militaristic,

1171
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,400
I dunno,
characterization of our society because 

1172
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:22,400
it's really fucking toxic man.

1173
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,200
Well,
and also it creates military problems 

1174
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,980
abroad because the rest of the world 
identifies us with that as well.

1175
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,530
Of course,
if we're doing shit like what we've done

1176
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:34,640
in the Iraq war,
which whatever the number is,

1177
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,880
whether it's sam harris is number one 
that he adheres to or whether it's the 

1178
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,750
one of the far left adheres to a lot of 
fucking people,

1179
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:46,790
right?
A lot of fucking people died and that 

1180
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:46,790
those people,
it creates without a doubt,

1181
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:51,940
martyrs and it creates without a doubt,
support for the opposition because we 

1182
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:56,560
were looked at in other parts of the 
world as the dark empire and also if 

1183
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,860
they're muslim and they,
they,

1184
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:03,140
they support muslim ideals and then they
see that these people who are have a 

1185
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:08,030
completely different faith or attacking 
and invading their homeland,

1186
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,360
it's pretty easy to support that.
And then they,

1187
00:55:11,361 --> 00:55:13,220
it Just piles on and next thing you 
know,

1188
00:55:13,221 --> 00:55:18,221
we got a problem and we got a current 
problem and we have a past problem and 

1189
00:55:18,221 --> 00:55:22,061
we've got a future problem and we have a
military industrial complex that's just 

1190
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:26,411
fucking rakesh and allows problems 
because problems means we may get to 

1191
00:55:26,411 --> 00:55:28,460
make more missiles and more missiles 
means mum.

1192
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:30,610
Money keeps going.
I mean money,

1193
00:55:30,611 --> 00:55:35,611
more problems.
Did you ever see the hunter s thompson 

1194
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:35,900
documentary?
No.

1195
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,320
IT's a gonzo.
I think it was called.

1196
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:40,360
No,
it's.

1197
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:42,260
It's great.
It's great.

1198
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,680
It's a great documentary,
but one of the best parts about it was 

1199
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,840
mcgovern when he was recounting his,
his days with,

1200
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:54,910
with hunter,
when hunter was writing that fear and 

1201
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:57,811
loading on the campaign trail and he 
followed around the press corps for a 

1202
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:58,250
year,
then wrote that book,

1203
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:03,670
but mcgovern was just talking about how 
he was just sick and tired of old men in

1204
00:56:05,451 --> 00:56:10,451
air conditioned buildings,
making decisions that are to send young 

1205
00:56:10,491 --> 00:56:15,491
men off to war and I'll just never 
forget the way he was saying that.

1206
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,520
And he's,
you knoW,

1207
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:19,750
mcgovern when he was doing that thing,
you know,

1208
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,580
he was an old guy when they were doing 
that documentary.

1209
00:56:22,581 --> 00:56:25,510
He died 2012,
but he was,

1210
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:29,310
he was old when they were doing that 
documentary and he was just saying,

1211
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,030
I'm just tired of it.

1212
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:36,030
I'm tired of.
And he died very shortly after that 

1213
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:36,970
documentary was made some of the last 
days of his life.

1214
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:42,450
And you know,
he ran for president and was the 

1215
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,350
seventies [inaudible] 72,
I think 70,

1216
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,490
72,
72,

1217
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,800
whatever it was,
but it was during the Vietnam war and 

1218
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,870
just that kind of voice and he didn't 
win.

1219
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:01,120
One of the reasons why I didn't win is 
because his vice presidential candidate 

1220
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:01,300
turned out that he had undergone shock 
therapy,

1221
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:04,150
electrical shock therapy,
and kind of hid that from everybody.

1222
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:06,370
And it came out during the campaign,
but he was ahead.

1223
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,430
Mcgovern was a head and part of the 
reason why he was ahead,

1224
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,440
it was because hunter was supporting 
them and hunter was writing for the 

1225
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:14,440
rolling stone and he would write crazy 
shit.

1226
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:19,441
like that was where he wrote about ed 
muskie who was also running for 

1227
00:57:19,441 --> 00:57:23,401
president.
He was saying that ed muskie was 

1228
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:24,210
bringing in brazilian doctors and they 
were treating him for his ibogaine.

1229
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:24,760
Okay.
Addiction.

1230
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:30,100
I've been addicted to ibogaine scenes.
No one even kneW what it was back then.

1231
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:36,330
Ed muskie was clearly exhibiting signs 
and it was really funny because they 

1232
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:39,310
interviewed hunter on one of these in 
the documentary.

1233
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:40,940
He's on one of these talk shows.
He goes wearing,

1234
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:45,950
well there was a rumor that a ed muskie 
was addicted to ibogaine and I started 

1235
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:50,821
the rumor,
but he was at journalist,

1236
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,760
but it wasn't,
I mean he was a journalist,

1237
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:57,640
but he was also,
he was writing fiction but easily like I

1238
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:00,360
thought everybody knew,
everybody knew it was bullshit.

1239
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,100
He's my favorite of all time.
He's one of my favorite people that ever

1240
00:58:06,101 --> 00:58:08,560
lived and uh,
he just,

1241
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:10,780
he knew it was bullshit and,
but he thought it was.

1242
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:15,800
Other people knew it was bullshit,
but he also knew that he could make an 

1243
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,301
impact with this.
So he thought that he thought that 

1244
00:58:18,301 --> 00:58:18,430
muskie was just fucking ridiculous hack.

1245
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,640
So he just mocked him and,
and talked about him being under the 

1246
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,940
throes of this addiction that they had 
brought in this brazilian doctor and,

1247
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:32,600
and then musky,
like have these breakdowns on the 

1248
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:32,600
campaign trail because he was dealing 
with.

1249
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,340
Because nobody had ever dealt with that 
kind of negativity from the press 

1250
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:41,131
before.
Nobody ever running for president had 

1251
00:58:41,131 --> 00:58:41,770
dealt with just someone fabricating 
craziness about them.

1252
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,110
And it's the pressure of this.
You could tell he wasn't.

1253
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,320
I don't even know where to start.
If you run for president and you don't 

1254
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,591
have a thick skin,
if you can't deal with people getting 

1255
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:54,781
mad at you on twitter,
making shit up about you and the huff 

1256
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:54,781
post or whatever they would want to do 
you.

1257
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,290
You really shouldn't be running for 
president.

1258
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:58,570
You have to develop some sort of rhinos 
scan at this point,

1259
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,520
but back then they were paper.

1260
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:02,380
That was.
People didn't know what the fuck to do.

1261
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
There's only been a few presidents that 
were on tv and they don't have the 

1262
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,000
billion dollar campaigns where they're 
like,

1263
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,290
have a spin master training.
When you think about 1972,

1264
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:15,130
how many fucking presidential candidates
had even been on television?

1265
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,470
You know,
jusT a few decades worth.

1266
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:20,980
It was so recent.
It was all so fucking recent.

1267
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:23,660
These poor bastards didn't know what to 
do.

1268
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,590
Now,
look at it.

1269
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:27,050
Now.
Look at this fucking dog and pony show.

1270
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,600
Now you get obama doing the mark marin 
podcast,

1271
00:59:29,601 --> 00:59:32,370
which are super crazy.
Isn't it bizarre?

1272
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,050
Yeah.
Just go right to her.

1273
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,590
No,
I listened to a little bit of it.

1274
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:37,290
I didn't listen to him.
Oh,

1275
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:40,670
just knew it was all going to be soft 
balls and bullshit and all boat,

1276
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,780
you know,
America.

1277
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:44,080
You just funny where obama's going for 
the audience.

1278
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,100
It's like advice,
you know,

1279
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,910
sitting down with shane smith and Mike 
Moran.

1280
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:51,911
I mean they,
he has good people telling them where 

1281
00:59:51,911 --> 00:59:53,870
people are at that come in here and 
smoke a joint wIth me.

1282
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:58,900
Barack obama down fucking scared 
podcasts.

1283
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:03,910
Do mushrooms experience sue just a 
little mushrooms runs child's play 

1284
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:06,380
compared to compare to this?
Well,

1285
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:09,760
I don't know if I would do it.
I would feel weird about it.

1286
01:00:09,761 --> 01:00:11,570
I mean I would definitely do it if you 
want to do it,

1287
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:16,571
but it wouldn't pursue it and if I.
But I just don't know what you could 

1288
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,130
ever get out of that.
like what you.

1289
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:19,490
You're never going to get trained like a
vader.

1290
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,520
You know what I mean?
Like everything you'd say would just be 

1291
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,120
going on.
You would had some serious fucking 

1292
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,641
enemies if you really went for it.
Like that is the last person in the 

1293
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:32,750
world you want to like put a.

1294
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:36,410
You want to put you in a book or a 
category,

1295
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:37,520
right?
Like this is.

1296
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,440
he's on the fuck with lists.
I traveled too much in the world.

1297
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:48,250
arguably right up there.
The most powerful figurehead in the 

1298
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:48,530
world,
if not the most powerful.

1299
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,920
Certainly top four or five.
Just thought of something really fucking

1300
01:00:51,921 --> 01:00:54,590
crazy.
The bomb that we stopped being an atomic

1301
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:57,170
bomb that those obviously dropped on 
hiroshima and nagasaki.

1302
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,920
We have.
That's Like fucking babysit.

1303
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:01,280
Oh,
hydrogen?

1304
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:04,520
Yeah.
Thirty 300 times stronger.

1305
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,340
I don't even.
I don't even understand.

1306
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:09,020
Thirty $300.
what would that even do?

1307
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:11,650
Like picture what we just saw exploding 
that little battleship.

1308
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:13,110
Like what the fuck?
Well,

1309
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,530
how do we have that?
I don't know.

1310
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:16,640
I don't know.
I mean,

1311
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:20,220
I guess we want to kill better.
Better at it.

1312
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,260
The more fucked up is the research 
they've done into anti-matter weapons.

1313
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,090
Ooh,
that's really crazy.

1314
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:28,250
Because we don't know whether or not 
that's the.

1315
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:31,640
This is just theoretical guy.
Bring me one of them.

1316
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,480
Alcohol beverages to young jamie.
Um,

1317
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:39,730
we don't know whether or not it's 
theoretical or whether this is actually 

1318
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:43,301
a proof of concept.
Whether anti-matter can be developed 

1319
01:01:43,301 --> 01:01:46,301
into a weapon,
we do know there's research being done 

1320
01:01:46,301 --> 01:01:46,910
on it and when they do develop 
anti-matter research,

1321
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,130
I mean when they do develop anti-matter 
weapons,

1322
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:51,170
whether it's in our lifetime or in the 
future lifetimes,

1323
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:54,530
you're talking about a world destroyer.
We're talking about something they might

1324
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:56,990
just shoot over at pluto like,
you know,

1325
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:02,120
it'll take nine years and we'll watch 
pluto blow up from the sky just to see 

1326
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,230
if we can do it.
That's very possible.

1327
01:02:03,231 --> 01:02:08,231
They might do that someday.
Just decided to launch it in some 

1328
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:08,231
fucking planet.
Well,

1329
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:12,580
do you know that that's your 
justification for continuing the 

1330
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,420
trillion dollars that they're going to 
spend just updating and refurbishing the

1331
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:19,421
nuclear arsenal is that they keep 
doubling down on the fucking star wars 

1332
01:02:19,421 --> 01:02:19,980
fantasy that reagan had.
Gorbachev went

1333
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,480
to reagan and he was like,
let's disarm.

1334
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,610
Let's fucking end it.
And reagan was like,

1335
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:28,611
no,
I'm senile and I want to create this 

1336
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:28,611
giant star wars program that's going to 
like,

1337
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:33,170
you know,
like the shield and the sky and we're 

1338
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:33,170
going to do this and that.
And everyone was like,

1339
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:33,170
all right,
never going to fucking work.

1340
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:38,180
And of course it didn't.
But that's still like a dress of 

1341
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,590
vacation to battle asteroids to have 
these nuclear weapons here and continued

1342
01:02:39,591 --> 01:02:40,050
to.

1343
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,380
Yeah.
Video game,

1344
01:02:42,381 --> 01:02:47,381
asteroids out when you know,
they say that if you do blow up an 

1345
01:02:47,991 --> 01:02:51,050
asteroid,
the real issue is you're going to create

1346
01:02:51,051 --> 01:02:53,780
more asteroids.
Just mass.

1347
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,260
Like you have a,
you have,

1348
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:57,740
you have something,
you don't relate it.

1349
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,040
If you have something that has masked,
it's five miles across,

1350
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,380
you're going to develop a 100,
you know,

1351
01:03:03,381 --> 01:03:08,381
half mile ones or whatever you know,
or 500 yard ones and they're going to 

1352
01:03:08,381 --> 01:03:08,960
kill everybody to.
They're going to come down.

1353
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:11,930
It's going to rain metal and rock from 
the sky.

1354
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,660
Do you mean people that don't know what 
an asteroid is?

1355
01:03:14,661 --> 01:03:17,120
A lot of them are iron.
They're metal,

1356
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:21,080
they're just giant chunks of metal and 
you fucking space.

1357
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,540
It's a trip where here's a great theory 
for her.

1358
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,510
Great conspiracy.
That is actually true.

1359
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:28,330
Fuck,
go ahead.

1360
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:29,370
Go ahead.
Yeah,

1361
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,330
we're good.
Go ahead.

1362
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,310
Just do your p and we'll have jamie pull
this up to pull up.

1363
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:39,700
I want you to pull up this star wars 
scientists that have been killed,

1364
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:45,940
star wars scientists that have either 
been murdered or committed suicide 

1365
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:49,640
because what's really fascinating about 
the star wars program,

1366
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:52,520
and I'll have to at least slightly 
reiterate this,

1367
01:03:52,521 --> 01:03:57,521
when young abby martin gets back because
I don't think she was completely aware 

1368
01:03:57,521 --> 01:04:02,501
of this,
but when the star wars weapons defense 

1369
01:04:02,691 --> 01:04:07,310
system was created,
the idea behind it was the United States

1370
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:12,311
was going to create a military.
They were going to create some sort of a

1371
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:17,620
military solution with satellites that 
could shoot these missiles out of the 

1372
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:21,080
sky.
Now while they were doing it,

1373
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:26,140
they were spending fuck loads of money 
on this and apparently it was never 

1374
01:04:26,421 --> 01:04:30,770
effective and if you could pull up the 
numbers,

1375
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:33,500
just pull up like there's a list of all 
the star wars.

1376
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,740
See if he could find a better article.
See like that.

1377
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:39,450
Who killed all the star wars scientists 
here.

1378
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:44,150
See if you could find out who go to a 
like a rent is rents legit.

1379
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:46,970
Ariana see isn't like a super conspiracy
website,

1380
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:52,550
mysterious deaths of scientists like 
scientists killed,

1381
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:55,790
star wars scientist murdered,
killed,

1382
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,830
but a giant number of them have all been
killed.

1383
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:04,230
Let's see.
I don't know,

1384
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:05,510
like,
what's a good,

1385
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:11,470
what's a good like website for this?
We should probably find a good one 

1386
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:17,830
because there's so many fucking goofy 
conspiracy theory websites that lumped a

1387
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:22,240
star wars people in with um,
chem trails.

1388
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:25,750
So the,
the star wars program,

1389
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:31,060
the,
the theory being the star wars program 

1390
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,601
has apparently never really effective.
And the scientists that were behind the 

1391
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:38,491
star wars program,
a fuck load of them died by suicide,

1392
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:44,131
by murder.
And there's a giant list of them and 

1393
01:05:44,131 --> 01:05:44,980
it's one of the most fascinating 
conspiracies,

1394
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:47,350
modern time to find it.

1395
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:48,590
Okay.
Um,

1396
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:53,020
these guys that knew the people that 
knew the scientists,

1397
01:05:53,021 --> 01:05:56,110
the engineers dead,
like almost all of them,

1398
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,730
they all died like murdered suicide and 
like very,

1399
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:02,710
very suspicious.
And someone did like a number,

1400
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:03,450
like,
you know,

1401
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:08,460
they did like a percentage,
like what are the odds that all these 

1402
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:08,800
people were murdered inside of billion 
to one?

1403
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:09,190
Yeah.
Well,

1404
01:06:09,191 --> 01:06:14,191
they knew,
they all knew that it was bullshit it 

1405
01:06:14,191 --> 01:06:14,191
star wars program.
They'd spend millions,

1406
01:06:14,191 --> 01:06:18,721
untold billions of dollars to develop 
this completely ineffective system to 

1407
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,880
shoot missiles at a sky.
It was never proven to work ever.

1408
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,660
And those scientists are all dead of 
food.

1409
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:27,880
Here it goes.
Dead scientists.

1410
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:32,930
And look at us.
There's the list mark coney scientists 

1411
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:36,640
mystery,
the 19 eighties over two dozen science 

1412
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,910
graduates and experts working on the 
marconi or plessy.

1413
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,000
How do you say that?
Plessy pls,

1414
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,030
cc plus sss.

1415
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,120
Why defense systems died in mysterious 
circumstances,

1416
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:49,270
most appearing to be suicides.
The mod denied.

1417
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:54,271
These scientists had been involved in 
the classified star wars projects and 

1418
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:55,330
that the desks were in any way 
connected.

1419
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,580
But look at how these guys died.
I'm look at this guy,

1420
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,040
computer programmer.
I'm keith bowden,

1421
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:08,340
scientists and uh,
at essex university engaged in work for 

1422
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:08,340
marconi,
bubba blah,

1423
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:11,050
circumstance of death,
fatal car crash was vehicle went off out

1424
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:16,051
of control across a dual carriageway and
plunged into a disused railway lines.

1425
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:18,820
Mean didn't even drinking witH family 
and friends.

1426
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:20,650
Denied the allegations.
So what the fuck was it were?

1427
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:22,690
Where's the autopsy?
Coroner report,

1428
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:24,940
accident.
Here's another one.

1429
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:28,450
Literally a lieutenant colonel anthony,
godly expertise,

1430
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:32,170
head of work study unit at the royal 
college of military science,

1431
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:36,010
circumstance of death disappeared 
mysteriously without explanation.

1432
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:38,890
I presumed that that's fucking 
expertise.

1433
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,980
Radar designer and droughts,
men draftsman,

1434
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:45,460
I guess as draftsman droughts,
men with marconi,

1435
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:47,470
circumstance of death,
death by shotgun,

1436
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:49,360
blast at home corners,
verdict,

1437
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:50,170
suicide.

1438
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:55,470
jonathan walz,
29 expertise digital communications 

1439
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:57,670
expert who had worked at gdc and had 
british telecom,

1440
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:00,110
secret research center at the blah blah,
blah,

1441
01:08:00,111 --> 01:08:00,670
blah,
blah.

1442
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:01,720
Here's his light.
Yep,

1443
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:07,170
exactly.
Deiter result of falling from a hotel 

1444
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,820
room in west africa working for british 
telecom.

1445
01:08:09,821 --> 01:08:12,580
He had expressed fears that his life was
in danger,

1446
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:13,900
corners,
verdict,

1447
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,730
open,
and it just goes on and on and on.

1448
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:19,360
Look out.
you see how?

1449
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:21,410
See scrolling,
look how's as jamie's growing,

1450
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:25,070
look at the upper right hand corner.
Look how fucking long this list is like.

1451
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:30,071
Scroll down to the bottom of this list 
so you can see how many people were on 

1452
01:08:30,071 --> 01:08:30,071
this.
Oh my god.

1453
01:08:30,071 --> 01:08:33,741
Look at this.
This is all a lot of people that were 

1454
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:35,440
attached to the star wars program,
all of them in the late eighties and the

1455
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,700
early nineties,
dead as fuck.

1456
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:41,800
Kramer,
David Kelly [inaudible],

1457
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:46,000
the guy who basically said that there 
were no wmds and jen and he found it was

1458
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:46,510
found dead.

1459
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:47,700
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1460
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,980
That's fucking sketch does a lot of 
those people.

1461
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:55,250
That's what happens with the people are 
like interested in going over to some 

1462
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,240
place that we don't belong.
Killing people.

1463
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:02,420
The idea that you're not going to kill 
you because you want to stop them from 

1464
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:04,660
killing people like crazy.
that's crazy talk.

1465
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:07,620
It's a very good way to say.
How about pat tillman?

1466
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:12,621
I mean there's pat tillman's brother 
believes that pat tillman was killed 

1467
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:16,550
because he was speaking it because it 
was a very public figure and then you 

1468
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:16,550
speaking out against them.

1469
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:20,630
You know,
that's going back to the chris kyle 

1470
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:22,351
thing because every single myth that has
been resurrected out of the Iraq 

1471
01:09:22,351 --> 01:09:23,000
invasion has been like,
you know,

1472
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:25,490
the pat tillman thing,
they were so hard,

1473
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,940
hard on for pat tillman because he 
really was a fucking here.

1474
01:09:28,941 --> 01:09:33,230
I mean he's abandoning like a million 
dollar career to go fight him because he

1475
01:09:33,231 --> 01:09:38,231
really believed it and he's really 
fucking smart and he realized that it 

1476
01:09:38,231 --> 01:09:41,921
was based on lies and shit and he had 
this diary and it's an incredible 

1477
01:09:41,921 --> 01:09:45,551
documentary that just talks about his 
transition and people who knew him and 

1478
01:09:45,551 --> 01:09:49,571
when he was changing his mind and he had
this diary all written up and they 

1479
01:09:49,571 --> 01:09:49,571
fucking burned it.
Dude,

1480
01:09:49,571 --> 01:09:50,870
when they killed him,
if they did,

1481
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:53,180
they say it was friendly fire,
who knows?

1482
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,220
But his brother thinks that it was 
targeted.

1483
01:09:55,221 --> 01:10:00,221
I don't know,
but he definitely would have come out 

1484
01:10:00,221 --> 01:10:00,221
and been like another,
like chomsky,

1485
01:10:00,221 --> 01:10:02,060
like he would have come out and said he 
would have been a figurehead against the

1486
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:06,320
war and he died from friendly fire and 
then they burned all of his shit.

1487
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:10,640
They burned his diary so we could set 
that is fucking crazy.

1488
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:12,260
And then look at the Jessica Lynch 
thing.

1489
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:13,370
Remember her?
Yeah.

1490
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:16,030
And they said she was raped and all of a
sudden then she was like,

1491
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:21,040
the rocky,
like military was like helping her just 

1492
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:21,040
put it on in a hospital.
And like taking care of her,

1493
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,540
then they've staged that whole,
like

1494
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:28,390
the narrative was that she was trapped 
and she was being kidnapped by the 

1495
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,250
iraqis and that the United States 
military went in and rescued her and she

1496
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:33,740
was his hero and she was paraded around 
on television,

1497
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:39,100
but she spoke out against it and she got
death threats and she essentially 

1498
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,710
vanished and she just went quiet on it 
and they never talked to her again.

1499
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,630
It's so sad too,
because they chose her.

1500
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:49,631
They're like,
we're going to prop you up as this 

1501
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:49,631
person.
And it's like,

1502
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:49,631
what are you?
She just got swept up in it.

1503
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:52,460
It's just so crazy the idea that they 
would just do that to someone and,

1504
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:57,550
and,
and force them into some sort of a 

1505
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:57,550
situation like that,
you know,

1506
01:10:57,550 --> 01:11:00,680
I just don't understand why they would 
think that you would just play along.

1507
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:05,920
I guess they just assume like we're 
goiNg to kill people or they're telling 

1508
01:11:06,351 --> 01:11:07,700
you to do this or telling you to do 
that.

1509
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And it was one of the first times that 
we had women in active duty two and you 

1510
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,000
know,
in,

1511
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,250
in combat duty.
Yeah,

1512
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:15,530
totally.
Yeah,

1513
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,280
totally.
Just not a lot of.

1514
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:18,760
I mean,
when you're,

1515
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:23,860
when you're dealing with death and 
you're dealing with what you would call 

1516
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,290
a sanctioned murder,
right?

1517
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:30,500
I mean that's what like if,
if you're in the military and you are 

1518
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:33,720
supposed to go over there and shoot some
bad guys,

1519
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:36,360
whether they're good or bad guys,
you're going to go murder those people.

1520
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,670
Right?
That's sanctioned murder and it's one of

1521
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:42,960
the weirdest things about civilization 
is that we salute sanctioned murder.

1522
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,470
Murder is awful when you don't like 
someone and you killed them.

1523
01:11:46,471 --> 01:11:51,471
We want to lock you up.
But if we tell you you can kill someone 

1524
01:11:51,471 --> 01:11:53,040
as long as it's written down on paper.
And we all collectively agree,

1525
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:58,290
but we don't really collectively agree.
That's where it gets weird as a small 

1526
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:02,000
group of people that decide who you can 
and can't kill and then everybody else 

1527
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,200
has to fall in line.
Well,

1528
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:07,210
if those people were beyond reproach,
if they were these incredibly 

1529
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:10,461
enlightened people that had only our 
best wishes and hopes in mind and could,

1530
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:16,940
could not make a bad decision,
but then it makes sense to just give 

1531
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:16,940
into them.
They're smarter than us.

1532
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:18,150
We're the ants and they're,
they're the,

1533
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,250
they're the geniuses and we'll just 
follow along.

1534
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,960
But that's not the case.
It's never been there.

1535
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,800
No,
and the thing that bothers me about the 

1536
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,641
obama administration is that he,
he's famed as this like transparency 

1537
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:30,220
president.
You know,

1538
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:35,221
we talked about the whistleblower thing.
It's like everything is the opposite of 

1539
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:35,221
what it is.
It's like this,

1540
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:38,491
our wellington new era where you have 
the nsa's spying now,

1541
01:12:38,831 --> 01:12:42,370
like the patriot act sunsetted.
We think that the patriot acts over.

1542
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:47,371
It wasn't,
it was just that the clause that they 

1543
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:48,760
were able to illegally spinus through 
the nsa in the patriot act expired,

1544
01:12:48,761 --> 01:12:53,761
and then they just passed a new law to 
basically codified legal spine just 

1545
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:55,090
through another caveat.
It's called the freedom act,

1546
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:56,060
so that,

1547
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:05,380
and you can't vote against the patriot 
act either because the name is just 

1548
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:05,380
like,
what?

1549
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,170
You're not a patriot,
you don't like freedom,

1550
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,020
but you don't want to answer not,
not freedom.

1551
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:09,870
Yeah,
nope.

1552
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:11,780
Who do you want?
You want death,

1553
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,100
what do you want?
Destruction.

1554
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:13,680
So it's like,
wow,

1555
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:18,710
the prisoner to pass the freedom act 
like,

1556
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,580
yeah,
of course we'd been torturing people.

1557
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:25,581
There's been wars,
there's been extrajudicial 

1558
01:13:25,581 --> 01:13:27,530
assassinations but never before has it 
been like openly codified and like 

1559
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:29,670
legislated executively.
You know what I mean?

1560
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:34,671
So it's almost this weird era of 
normalization and conditioning where 

1561
01:13:34,671 --> 01:13:38,121
people just accept this as a new normal,
like the empire and just the post nine 

1562
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:40,050
slash 11 era.
We just do these thiNgs now and it's all

1563
01:13:40,051 --> 01:13:40,860
legal,
right?

1564
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,160
It's illegal because we've created all 
these legal caveats to do them.

1565
01:13:44,161 --> 01:13:46,980
So what is legal?
That's when it gets weird.

1566
01:13:46,981 --> 01:13:49,400
It's just like what is legal and what's 
not legal?

1567
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:55,090
They write it down.
It's legal tender pentagram just issued 

1568
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:56,490
this field manual to basically for all 
the branches in the military and in it.

1569
01:13:56,491 --> 01:14:01,491
I guess because citizen journalism is on
the rise and it's really hard to 

1570
01:14:01,491 --> 01:14:02,830
distinguish like who is like an official
established journalist are not are who's

1571
01:14:02,831 --> 01:14:07,831
like embedded with the enemy and they 
basically said that journalists can be 

1572
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:10,020
killed legally now by a us military 
personnel.

1573
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:11,890
That crazy.
Yeah.

1574
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:13,530
That's in the new pentagon arms.

1575
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:19,130
Well that was one of the things that 
happened during the obama obama 

1576
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:22,251
administration that,
that they started at assassinating 

1577
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:22,650
american citizens without trial.
You know,

1578
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,630
if they were to due process and you 
know,

1579
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:27,000
the rule of law and as long as you're 
over there though,

1580
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:29,310
they can just assassinate you drone 
strikes.

1581
01:14:29,311 --> 01:14:30,840
What,
how is this?

1582
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,360
It's I,
I get it.

1583
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:38,450
If they're absolutely honest and beyond 
reproach and the most enlightened beings

1584
01:14:38,851 --> 01:14:41,100
in the world that are dictating what 
these actions would be.

1585
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:46,101
I mean if you have some fucking hitler 
character over there and you want to 

1586
01:14:46,101 --> 01:14:46,101
assassinate him,
I get it.

1587
01:14:46,101 --> 01:14:46,860
That makes sense to me.
You know,

1588
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:50,770
you want to us in the loop and be like,
look,

1589
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,400
this guy's hitler.
two point.

1590
01:14:53,401 --> 01:14:56,450
Oh,
is black and classified Mrs.

1591
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,120
Martin.
he didn't.

1592
01:14:57,121 --> 01:15:02,121
You work for Russia when you boot on the
ground that continues as a tax against 

1593
01:15:04,381 --> 01:15:05,340
him.
Like john,

1594
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:10,580
he's barely paying attention.
He had his aide do that while you're 

1595
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:10,580
still in the middle of poker.
Yeah.

1596
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,150
He doesn't know how to tweet.
Probably barely.

1597
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,650
Seaweeds.
Do you think he tweets?

1598
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,960
I don't think.
I don't think obama tweet either.

1599
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,520
Tweets now.
It doesn't actually touch this key.

1600
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,400
I would hope he has better shit to do.

1601
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:25,740
That was obama's tweeting emoji.
Smiley face.

1602
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:31,500
Imagine obama tweeted,
just as there's only a smiley face,

1603
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,790
a pile of dog shit.
And uh,

1604
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:34,620
god,
what does that mean?

1605
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:38,100
That's my life.
What does it mean?

1606
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:43,260
Everybody would dissect it forever.
When They look back at us in the future,

1607
01:15:43,261 --> 01:15:44,100
when they,
you know,

1608
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:46,440
civilizations 100,
200 years from now,

1609
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,880
look back at what were,
you know,

1610
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:52,890
when we look back at world war ii,
looking at these people that were 

1611
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:52,890
running towards this bomb,
now we look at him like,

1612
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:54,900
fuck man,
these poor bastards.

1613
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:56,610
You.
What are they going to think about us?

1614
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,980
When is that going to not be the case?

1615
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:00,430
Yeah,
I don't,

1616
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,330
I dunno,
I dunno,

1617
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,080
I was just thinking the other day about 
like,

1618
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,280
you know,
reality tv and how back in the day we 

1619
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,080
had like the fat lady at the circus and 
like the bearded lady,

1620
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:13,330
it's just like we'd still have that.
It's just in,

1621
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:16,750
in the realm Of reality television.
We're trying to empathize with like this

1622
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:21,751
fat lady,
but really we're just watching like a 

1623
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:21,751
giant whale,
live her life and,

1624
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:24,800
and like it's just like the circus and 
it's the same with um,

1625
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:26,020
you know,
horror movies and shit,

1626
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:29,140
like we don't have the coliseum but we 
still like people being ripped limb from

1627
01:16:29,141 --> 01:16:34,141
limb and blood and fucking guts.
It's something about us and,

1628
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,280
and yeah,
it's evolved through technology but it's

1629
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:39,610
still that weird innate human trait that
I don't really understand.

1630
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:42,740
Yeah.
We love oddities and we also love people

1631
01:16:42,741 --> 01:16:45,490
suffering when we're not because we're 
good.

1632
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,340
I'm not there.
Yeah,

1633
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:46,660
right.
Like,

1634
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:51,670
let's wait,
like I'm watching intervention because 

1635
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:53,861
I've watched the sunshine,
the episode of the girls doing the 

1636
01:16:53,861 --> 01:16:54,120
duster and I'm like,
alright,

1637
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,870
I guess I don't feel bad about smoking 
weed because.

1638
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,180
Yeah.
Have you ever seen that?

1639
01:17:02,181 --> 01:17:07,181
Fucking my strange addiction does this 
shit exists in the third world are.

1640
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,060
Fuck,
that's a good question.

1641
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:17,120
I don't know.
It's a very good question.

1642
01:17:17,121 --> 01:17:21,890
I wonder what what it is about human 
beings that when everything is great and

1643
01:17:21,891 --> 01:17:24,500
you have too much resources and it's too
easy to get food,

1644
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,590
we just start getting really fucking 
strange.

1645
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:32,890
I'm addicted to eating dry wall.
I mean that's what I want to know.

1646
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:36,470
I'm wondering,
you know like it almost seems like the,

1647
01:17:36,471 --> 01:17:38,450
my strange addiction one is like almost 
like,

1648
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:42,260
well having worked in reality tv and 
knowing how much of it is bullshit,

1649
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:43,640
how,
how does that work?

1650
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,870
Because it just super shit will.
even when,

1651
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:50,871
when I did that saifai show,
they fucking just fake things like your 

1652
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:51,350
reaction shots and shit.
I always wonder if you're like,

1653
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:56,440
people are like,
they definitely edit things and put 

1654
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:56,440
certain reaction things where they 
don't,

1655
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:01,000
where they didn't belong.
To just have to face the way he's 

1656
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,430
looking at what.
There was one where they did without a 

1657
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:07,080
sci fi show that I did where they.
There's a thing that people believe in 

1658
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,160
called sky quakes,
and this is probably bullshit,

1659
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,440
most likely,
but sounds from the sky,

1660
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:17,441
like a crazy like horns and people 
trying to figure out what these sounds 

1661
01:18:17,441 --> 01:18:17,570
were.
Well,

1662
01:18:17,571 --> 01:18:20,960
they took a video.
This is one guy sending this video where

1663
01:18:20,961 --> 01:18:22,340
he was just.
It was actually,

1664
01:18:22,341 --> 01:18:24,980
it's really hilarious because the one 
guy that they put the video,

1665
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:30,220
he was like a chem trail believer,
so he believes in a different kind of 

1666
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:34,301
bull shit and he was pointing at the sky
and we kind of mocked him for his camp 

1667
01:18:34,301 --> 01:18:36,200
trail beliefs,
but then these fucking dummies that made

1668
01:18:36,201 --> 01:18:41,201
the show that the editors took a chunk 
of this guy's video and then added some 

1669
01:18:41,361 --> 01:18:46,361
sound to it and then put it on the show 
and said that he was pointing to a sky 

1670
01:18:46,361 --> 01:18:46,970
quick,
but he wasn't.

1671
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:50,480
it was just fate and I found out about 
it.

1672
01:18:50,481 --> 01:18:53,330
I freaked out.
I had them remove it from the show,

1673
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:58,420
but it aired the first time it aired.
That was on the show and then after it 

1674
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,680
aired,
when they aired it for a second time,

1675
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:02,210
they removed it.
So disingenuous.

1676
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:05,000
That's what they do and that's what they
do.

1677
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:10,001
That's what those shows are.
Those shows are just bullshit and most 

1678
01:19:10,001 --> 01:19:12,311
of those shows are bullshit.
And saifai at the time had a ton of 

1679
01:19:12,311 --> 01:19:15,971
those.
There was one show that was all about a 

1680
01:19:15,971 --> 01:19:19,180
family that was trapped in a house in 
Maine because there was werewolf's 

1681
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:23,561
outside and it was a whole like fucking 
half hour show about these people just 

1682
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:24,570
will,
you know,

1683
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:29,610
I looked out my salt,
it was standing up and it looked like a 

1684
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:33,131
man,
but it was covenant for just making 

1685
01:19:33,131 --> 01:19:33,131
things up and that was the whole shit.

1686
01:19:33,131 --> 01:19:36,870
They don't give a fuck as long as they 
could get that toyota truck commercial 

1687
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:40,361
on a toyota.
Then we got tied and then we got a 

1688
01:19:40,361 --> 01:19:40,820
fucking hot dogs.
Alright,

1689
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,880
go back to the werewolf stories.
I understand joe because I had an agent 

1690
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,511
for a little while looking for work and 
stuff and every single thing because I 

1691
01:19:49,511 --> 01:19:50,260
guess I come from like the same,
you know,

1692
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:52,700
questioning government narratives and oh
shit,

1693
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:57,701
you're a tinfoil hat where if you 
fucking question where the government 

1694
01:19:57,701 --> 01:19:57,860
tells you,
and so it's always these shows.

1695
01:19:57,861 --> 01:20:02,861
They're like,
we're starting to show to basically 

1696
01:20:02,861 --> 01:20:02,861
dissect like jfk and chem trails and 
like,

1697
01:20:02,861 --> 01:20:05,990
isn't there anything else fucking 
happening other than like that same five

1698
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:09,390
fucking things that you guys want to 
create shows around?

1699
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:10,530
it's so weird.
No,

1700
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:12,270
there's not.
No.

1701
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,850
That's what all these god damn things 
are and it's all just bullshit.

1702
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:19,850
It's like,
why don't we talk about shit that 

1703
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:20,841
fucking matters are like interesting 
stuff that's going on now because those 

1704
01:20:20,841 --> 01:20:20,910
things are like,
they can start fires,

1705
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,620
you know,
it's like you could start fires with the

1706
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:24,090
flint and in a,
you know,

1707
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:25,440
a piece of metal clink,
clink,

1708
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:30,441
clink and they know it works.
So they just keep going to it over and 

1709
01:20:30,441 --> 01:20:30,441
over again.
You can start a fire with bigfoot,

1710
01:20:30,441 --> 01:20:31,950
put big foot on tv and people,
oh look good,

1711
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:35,010
and they're just drawn to it loses a 
ufo.

1712
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:40,011
It says it's real.
There's just certain subjects that 

1713
01:20:40,011 --> 01:20:41,820
people will always want to believe and 
they want to believe in psychics.

1714
01:20:41,821 --> 01:20:46,821
They want to believe in chem trails,
ufo the government experiments,

1715
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:52,230
the mind control.
Don't you know about majestic twirl 

1716
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:56,840
government was there.
I'm sure there's been some mind control 

1717
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,260
experiments.
There was definitely those lsd dude,

1718
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:01,150
mk ultra where they were just watching 
people fucking like a,

1719
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:04,890
like a whorehouse and liked like dosing 
them with acid and then these fbi agents

1720
01:21:04,891 --> 01:21:09,891
would sit behind like one way mirrors 
and just watch him operation midnight 

1721
01:21:09,891 --> 01:21:09,990
climate in that class.

1722
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,600
It must be really cool to be an fbi 
agent during the fucking.

1723
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:18,020
They dose people with acid.
When they went to whorehouses guys went 

1724
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:21,261
to whore houses.
They would slip acid in their drink and 

1725
01:21:21,261 --> 01:21:24,660
you know,
they really didn't really want to sex 

1726
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:24,660
anymore.
Thinking about life,

1727
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:29,870
existential angst is really kind of true
that the us government has like half the

1728
01:21:32,311 --> 01:21:35,050
world is lsd.
Is that,

1729
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:36,630
is that a bullshit?
Well,

1730
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:41,680
it's most likely bullshit.
Here's why it's bullshit because lsd as 

1731
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:42,300
a half life and it doesn't last.
If you have a,

1732
01:21:42,301 --> 01:21:47,301
a vat of lsd and you leave it in your 
house for 10 years and most likely it's 

1733
01:21:47,301 --> 01:21:50,550
not really effective after aWhile,
so them having that,

1734
01:21:50,551 --> 01:21:55,551
they seized a bunch of it.
Really good asset during that whole 

1735
01:21:55,551 --> 01:21:55,551
time,
but I guess yeah,

1736
01:21:55,551 --> 01:21:55,890
sure they did.
Yeah,

1737
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:58,360
but it wouldn't unless they figured out 
some way to contain it.

1738
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:01,530
Vacuum seal it in some special way.
I don't know.

1739
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:03,300
I'm guessing.
No,

1740
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:05,370
as far as I know of,
I don't think like,

1741
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,270
I think a lot of substances or just not.
That's why vitamins,

1742
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:11,280
if you get vitamins,
like most vitamins,

1743
01:22:11,281 --> 01:22:16,281
you look at them,
they're not really effective after like 

1744
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:16,860
six months or a year to become less and 
less effective over time.

1745
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,370
Right.
pretty sure that's the case with lsd.

1746
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,800
Don't quote me on though,
but I know it is with weed I've gotten.

1747
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,920
yeah.
Unfortunately it doesn't last.

1748
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:28,970
It's like life.
You got to get it fresh and young.

1749
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:32,250
Get that carbon in the fucking possible.
Yeah,

1750
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:33,930
even edibles,
they go bad.

1751
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:36,990
Even if they break them down into a 
cookie,

1752
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:39,270
put that cookie in a piece of plastic,
try to eat it.

1753
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:44,271
A couple years from now we'd we just.
So we just took this epic road trip and 

1754
01:22:44,271 --> 01:22:44,730
got back this morning,
which was amazing that I.

1755
01:22:44,731 --> 01:22:48,630
I wanted to tell your audience about the
Utah thing because it was so funny.

1756
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,840
I mean here you are in these fucking 
massive like rock formations carved by 

1757
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,240
millions of years of water,
sandstone,

1758
01:22:55,350 --> 01:23:00,090
fucking whatever.
Like slate all this shit insane.

1759
01:23:00,091 --> 01:23:02,490
Like anyone who has not been to Utah,
you need to go.

1760
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:05,040
Bryce canyon national park is one of the
most absurd things I've ever.

1761
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,000
It's like these things called the

1762
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,350
hoodoos that are just carved over 
millions of years at the stone.

1763
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:13,710
Anyway.
Arches national park obviously that 

1764
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:13,710
iconic,
like all the,

1765
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:16,830
the orange arches that are carved in 
millions of years like we can carbon 

1766
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:21,061
date them.
We know the geological processes very 

1767
01:23:21,061 --> 01:23:23,461
easy to explain through science.
So we're reading the official park 

1768
01:23:23,461 --> 01:23:23,690
literature and I'm just like,
man,

1769
01:23:23,691 --> 01:23:24,940
I'm like so,
so fascinated.

1770
01:23:24,941 --> 01:23:29,941
Like how did this form?
AnD so like crazy and it makes you just 

1771
01:23:29,941 --> 01:23:29,941
like,
appreciate time.

1772
01:23:29,941 --> 01:23:31,360
Like that's what the desert is like.
you fucking appreciate time.

1773
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:36,690
Like that is as you look at that.
And that's the top of the grand 

1774
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:36,690
staircase,
joe.

1775
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:37,540
That's the newest part of the grand 
staircase.

1776
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,660
That's amazing.
So in,

1777
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:42,160
that's fucking ridiculous.
It looks like a standing army.

1778
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:47,590
Yeah.
A few people that are just listening to 

1779
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:47,590
this.
what would it looks like?

1780
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,850
Obviously it's not,
but it looks like something that someone

1781
01:23:49,851 --> 01:23:54,851
has designed.
Looks like something someone carved out 

1782
01:23:54,851 --> 01:23:58,151
of the stone.
Like some of those things look like 

1783
01:23:58,151 --> 01:23:58,151
insane.
Yeah.

1784
01:23:58,151 --> 01:23:58,490
They look like columns in a building.

1785
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,920
It's amazing dude.
Um,

1786
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:03,500
and so in you,
so this is all Utah of course,

1787
01:24:03,501 --> 01:24:06,200
named after some mormon guy named bryce 
who discovered it,

1788
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:07,550
you know,
so anyway,

1789
01:24:07,551 --> 01:24:11,120
there's arches arches that are created 
by just wind and time.

1790
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
That's what you like the most.
The most crazy thing aboUt being out in 

1791
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,000
the desert for as long as you,
you're just like,

1792
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,070
this took millions of years to,
to happen.

1793
01:24:19,071 --> 01:24:24,071
I mean,
it makes you just appreciate fucking 

1794
01:24:24,071 --> 01:24:24,410
time and evolution and like how the 
earth has changed and this is only think

1795
01:24:24,411 --> 01:24:26,570
about how old the earth is.
BillioNs of years old.

1796
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,760
this was only the last couPle of 
million.

1797
01:24:28,761 --> 01:24:30,830
If you look at something called the 
black canyon,

1798
01:24:30,831 --> 01:24:34,160
which is actually way deeper than the 
grand canyon and way more narrow.

1799
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:35,480
I was just like,
oh my god,

1800
01:24:35,481 --> 01:24:37,160
this must have taken billions of years 
to form.

1801
01:24:37,161 --> 01:24:37,880
And it was just like,
nope,

1802
01:24:37,881 --> 01:24:39,620
just the last 2 million years just 
popped up.

1803
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,610
It's like,
what the fuck?

1804
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:45,850
It just makes you,
it just makes you just appreciate like 

1805
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:47,330
time,
time and geology and science.

1806
01:24:47,331 --> 01:24:52,331
So anyway,
and this official park literature and 

1807
01:24:52,331 --> 01:24:53,000
arches,
it explains everything very,

1808
01:24:53,001 --> 01:24:55,070
um,
precisely at the very end of it.

1809
01:24:55,071 --> 01:24:55,970
It's just like,
okay,

1810
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:01,240
we just explained how all this worked.
This is the history of arches national 

1811
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:05,621
park.
And then it says probably all of the 

1812
01:25:05,621 --> 01:25:06,380
evidence is circumstantial.
And I was just like,

1813
01:25:06,381 --> 01:25:07,370
what the fuck?
I was like,

1814
01:25:07,371 --> 01:25:09,260
whaT do you mean?
All the evidence is circumstantial.

1815
01:25:09,261 --> 01:25:11,360
It's like all the evidence is not 
circumstantial.

1816
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:13,820
Evidence is proven.
We know how old these rocks are,

1817
01:25:13,821 --> 01:25:16,790
we know exactly what's carved them.
We can test all the sediments,

1818
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:19,250
we can test all the rocks.
So I was just like,

1819
01:25:19,251 --> 01:25:24,251
holy shit.
Like has the mormon lobby just lobbied 

1820
01:25:24,251 --> 01:25:26,861
all the fucking parks in Utah,
which are the best parks in the country 

1821
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:28,040
and the most amazing state.
And basically forced them to say,

1822
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:29,680
none of this is real.

1823
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:37,740
It was 14 years old.
He found golden tablets containing the 

1824
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:42,161
last work of jesus.
The israeli people came over from the 

1825
01:25:42,161 --> 01:25:45,020
bering strait and siberia.
That's crazy.

1826
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:48,720
That's the narrative for the mormons.
Do you know that,

1827
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:52,970
that the lost tribe of Israel with the 
native americans,

1828
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:59,730
you didn't know that they even tested.
This guy was as rich mormon dude tested 

1829
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:05,550
native american dna to try to prove that
they were israeli and that they were the

1830
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:10,870
lost tribes of Israel.
And turns out that's not true from 

1831
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:18,080
siberia.
They came over from the berIng strait 

1832
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:18,080
and we've known that forever,
but they,

1833
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,010
uh,
they tested it.

1834
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:24,550
But in a of Joseph Smith,
he found magic tablets and he had a 

1835
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:29,890
magic stone and he could.
He had a seer stone and only he could 

1836
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:31,680
read the magic that he wouldn't let 
anyone else see them.

1837
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,250
Trust me.
Well,

1838
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:38,300
not only that,
he got game needed a stone to look at 

1839
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,080
them guys.
Seer stone got it serious.

1840
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:41,780
It's a wonderful story.
A wonderful stone.

1841
01:26:41,781 --> 01:26:46,781
I wish I had one.
Two angels came and took the tablets 

1842
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:46,781
away because the people didn't believe

1843
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,160
the test.
Our faith like dinosaur bones,

1844
01:26:49,161 --> 01:26:54,130
they're just like,
just got to trust in joseph smith's seer

1845
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:56,230
stones.
Fucking batshit crazy,

1846
01:26:56,231 --> 01:26:57,050
dude.
Can you imagine him?

1847
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:02,070
Just wondering,
can you imagine Joseph Smith today 

1848
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,070
walking around with a seer stone being 
like,

1849
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:06,910
I found these golden tablets.

1850
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:12,310
well,
what's really wonderful is that a 

1851
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,310
follower,
this jackass almost became president.

1852
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,430
Got real.
Goddamn.

1853
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:17,710
That's fucking batshit crazy.
The people that don't even know how bad 

1854
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:17,710
shit.
Mitt romney,

1855
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:21,800
mitt romney's family is living in 
Mexico.

1856
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:26,360
His family is all from Mexico.
That's why his dad was never president.

1857
01:27:26,361 --> 01:27:28,220
Mitt romney's dad wanted to be 
president.

1858
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:32,390
Mitt romney's family was one of the 
fucking mormons that escaped America.

1859
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:35,180
When they made polygamy illegal,
they will like,

1860
01:27:35,181 --> 01:27:36,450
look,
I need more than one poser.

1861
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:39,320
Oh god,
it's too much this.

1862
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:42,340
It's true.
That's what happened.

1863
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,290
Do you know that?
Didn't know that.

1864
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:48,460
Mitt romney's family,
they still live in Mexico.

1865
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:51,100
Mitt romney's dad is from fucking 
Mexico.

1866
01:27:51,101 --> 01:27:56,101
He was born in Mexico.
There's a huge white looking will 

1867
01:27:56,410 --> 01:28:01,410
american from the escape back when there
was nO cars.

1868
01:28:01,690 --> 01:28:02,220
Got it.
See,

1869
01:28:02,221 --> 01:28:04,510
there was no cars and back when there 
was no cars.

1870
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:07,810
You're on a horseback in America.
You're on horseback in Mexico.

1871
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:10,810
What difference does it make?
But if you cross this dirt wind,

1872
01:28:10,811 --> 01:28:13,840
you could fuck nine different chicks and
live in a house where you,

1873
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:15,310
you know,
you all have your own rules.

1874
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:17,440
Well,
to this day they're over there.

1875
01:28:17,441 --> 01:28:21,700
There's a whole colony of them and 
they're at war on a regular basis.

1876
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,010
There's mitt romney's cousin over there 
in Mexico.

1877
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:29,220
That's kelly romney.
They're playing golf with fucking armed 

1878
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,110
guards because the cartel kidnaps them 
all the time.

1879
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:31,720
Your wives waiting inside,
well,

1880
01:28:31,721 --> 01:28:35,920
they get kIdnapped by the cartel war.
These people,

1881
01:28:35,921 --> 01:28:38,020
they have these ranches and their arm to
the dick.

1882
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:39,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

1883
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,530
She's aware of it that way.
I don't owe this advice.

1884
01:28:42,531 --> 01:28:47,531
Is shane over their areas wandering 
around in Mexico actually has a really 

1885
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:51,960
interesting story because he at bain 
capital when he ran bain capital,

1886
01:28:51,961 --> 01:28:56,961
um,
he was taken in and trained by monsanto 

1887
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:56,961
executives and he,
he like,

1888
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:01,080
I think he was given his first big loan 
by monsanto executive.

1889
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,580
Then he was like,
all right y'all,

1890
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,530
you guys are fucking toxic chemical 
company,

1891
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,030
fucking agent orange,
all this shit.

1892
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:07,530
Real bad,
real bad.

1893
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:12,531
look,
why don't we shift this over to food 

1894
01:29:12,531 --> 01:29:15,380
now?
So like he basically was behind this 

1895
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:17,190
giant pr push to switch monsanto over 
from chemicals to biotech,

1896
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:21,090
which is really interesting to be like,
why was mitt romney's in the fold?

1897
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:26,360
You know,
it's just like super weird that he was 

1898
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,101
just like right there in the wings kind 
of helping foster this transition is 

1899
01:29:28,101 --> 01:29:29,580
super weird.
People witH money paying capital,

1900
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:34,790
harvesting money.
That's what he says in some commercial 

1901
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:34,790
for bain capital.
He was like,

1902
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:34,790
we harvest and money,

1903
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:35,400
like,
oh my god,

1904
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:40,800
how do you show us where the money tree?
I can't.

1905
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:45,120
It's near the golden tablets.
Need a seer stone to see the magIc money

1906
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:50,121
tree seeds only through this tiny seeds.
We water it with angel tiers and piss

1907
01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:58,380
fuck money tree harvest.
What are you doing?

1908
01:29:58,381 --> 01:29:59,760
Cash.
What are you doing?

1909
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:04,770
mit?
It sounded like he was harvesting human 

1910
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:06,951
beings.
It's like we grow that planned 

1911
01:30:06,951 --> 01:30:10,881
parenthood goes and for us the whole 
thing is ridiculous.

1912
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:12,340
Hilarious.
Yeah.

1913
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:17,360
The planned parenthood thing,
we were talking about it earlier in a 

1914
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,731
different podcast.
We were trying to figure out what the 

1915
01:30:19,731 --> 01:30:21,480
fuck was going on with them.
What are they supposed to fucking do?

1916
01:30:21,481 --> 01:30:23,030
Throw the baby's in the trash case.
What?

1917
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:23,990
I said,
yeah,

1918
01:30:23,991 --> 01:30:26,520
like I would like them to you if they 
are,

1919
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:29,010
if abortion is legal and I think it 
should be.

1920
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,480
What are they going to do with the 
tissue?

1921
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:32,250
Wouldn't it be better if that tissue 
gets used,

1922
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:37,580
but it's a fucking super disturbing 
video when they start going through the 

1923
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,650
parts and you realize what abortion 
really is like,

1924
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:40,500
oh,
this is in canadian.

1925
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:41,050
Yeah.

1926
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:46,940
More convenient for me to think that 
this is a bundle of cells don't really 

1927
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,120
want to see.
The whole thing is just like,

1928
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:53,660
yeah,
it's like abortion is legal and I would 

1929
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:56,931
rather have them utilize the tissue for 
something that's scientific instead of 

1930
01:30:56,931 --> 01:30:57,840
just throwing the garbage can.
So yeah,

1931
01:30:57,841 --> 01:30:58,740
that's.
That's true.

1932
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,810
I think what a lot of people were 
worried about,

1933
01:31:00,811 --> 01:31:05,811
not just this is that they were going to
somehow or another influence people to 

1934
01:31:05,811 --> 01:31:07,470
do it for money influence people to have
abortions for money.

1935
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,610
Oh god,
that's insane.

1936
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:10,680
It is,
but it isn't.

1937
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:13,650
There's got to be people that are 
willing to have an abortion for money.

1938
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,660
What dId they get paid?
Like?

1939
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:19,110
Planned parenthood wasn't the whole 
issue that planned parenthood was making

1940
01:31:19,111 --> 01:31:20,220
money,
selling the tissue,

1941
01:31:20,221 --> 01:31:21,630
but then they said that that wasn't 
true.

1942
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:26,730
Something along those lines.
If there was like some black market 

1943
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:27,270
thing where people can have abortions 
and like sell the tissue,

1944
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:28,380
I just don't.
Yeah,

1945
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:33,590
it's super confusing because the video 
implies that planned parenthood was 

1946
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:36,870
profiting off of it and that this woman 
was trying to say that she could sort of

1947
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:38,820
structure it so they can make more 
money.

1948
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:44,870
Look,
all I know is planned parents fucking 

1949
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:44,870
great.
Okay.

1950
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:44,870
I,
I love it.

1951
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:49,080
I think it gets important.
Right?

1952
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,140
And people wHo want to talk shit.
Um,

1953
01:31:52,141 --> 01:31:53,760
planned parenthood isn't talk about this
baby thing.

1954
01:31:53,761 --> 01:31:58,761
It's just so ridiculous because I didn't
have healthcare for like three months 

1955
01:31:58,761 --> 01:32:00,250
after I quit tea and I

1956
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:02,440
was on birth control and I was just 
like,

1957
01:32:02,441 --> 01:32:07,441
what the fuck would I do?
What would I do if planned parenthood 

1958
01:32:07,441 --> 01:32:09,790
wasn't here,
I wouldn't have helped them control.

1959
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:13,930
How about working for somebody other 
than Russia extends your benefits.

1960
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,550
There's some shit that you need 
prescribed.

1961
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:17,030
You don't have unemployment.
Broken for lunch.

1962
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:19,900
Just go fucking up certain birth 
controls at this,

1963
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:24,901
at the convenient store.
It was rush limbaugh that killed rush 

1964
01:32:24,901 --> 01:32:24,901
limbaugh's career,
wasn't it?

1965
01:32:24,901 --> 01:32:27,710
We was talking about some girl beer.
See that too,

1966
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:32,020
but he was talking about some girl being
a slut because she wanted birth control,

1967
01:32:32,021 --> 01:32:35,260
so college student member,
that was like 2012.

1968
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:38,700
That was the dropoff.
That was where it ended for rush limbo.

1969
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:40,420
Oxy didn't do it.
That did it.

1970
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:45,570
Yeah.
He was seeing a bunch of really rude 

1971
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:47,341
shit.
Boys probably oxford out of his fucking 

1972
01:32:47,341 --> 01:32:47,341
head while you're saying it,
you know,

1973
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:54,460
are coming in your nose,
but that,

1974
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,490
that literally like ended his career.

1975
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,600
That was like aRound 2012,
if I remember correctly.

1976
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:03,580
I'm trying to remember what the story 
was,

1977
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:08,880
but it was some college girl and he was 
calling her a slut and I think it was a 

1978
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:09,690
rape victim or no,
no,

1979
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:13,030
no.
I think it wAs even over the top rush.

1980
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:19,030
Chris commerce.
I think what he wanted to do was he 

1981
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:22,171
wanted to.
He was mocking her because she was 

1982
01:33:22,171 --> 01:33:25,190
saying that a birth control should be a 
part of something.

1983
01:33:25,710 --> 01:33:30,710
See if he could find that rush limbo 
college girl slot birth control.

1984
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,210
Google that,
right?

1985
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,630
Yeah.
It was like he was.

1986
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:38,680
She was saying that it should be a part 
of her health care.

1987
01:33:38,681 --> 01:33:43,540
I think he was calling her a slut 
because she wanted birth control.

1988
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:45,210
Right?
Like what?

1989
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:47,050
Thirty?
What the fuck,

1990
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:48,400
man,
you wanted to get pregnant.

1991
01:33:48,401 --> 01:33:49,150
You dumb.
Fuck.

1992
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,180
Exactly.
Oh,

1993
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:55,660
she shouldn't have sex.
Some state just issued free birth 

1994
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:58,231
control.
Did this radical idea where they gave 

1995
01:33:58,231 --> 01:34:00,340
free birth control to women and portion 
like fucking plummeted,

1996
01:34:00,341 --> 01:34:03,460
like 30 percent,
like teen pregnancy plummeted.

1997
01:34:03,461 --> 01:34:04,300
It's like,
wow,

1998
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:07,480
who fuck it.
Fuck it.

1999
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,460
Airbrushed.
Limo co's,

2000
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:10,180
georgetown student yet let's not get a 
video.

2001
01:34:10,181 --> 01:34:12,430
Let's see what the.
With the actual facts work,

2002
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:18,750
I want to go ahead and play it.
Play the audio good

2003
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:24,410
for two days.
Rush limbaugh has a visceral sandra 

2004
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:25,620
fluke on the radio.
What does it say?

2005
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,250
College coeds.
Susan fluke.

2006
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:35,810
Sandra goes before a congressional 
committee and essentially says that she 

2007
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:38,250
must be paid to have sex.
What does that make her pain?

2008
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:41,370
Eps.
It makes you a slut,

2009
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,980
right?
When you say to a prostitute,

2010
01:34:43,981 --> 01:34:46,620
she wants to be paid to have sex.
fluke.

2011
01:34:46,621 --> 01:34:51,621
A third year law student at georgetown 
is now the flashpoint in a debate about 

2012
01:34:51,621 --> 01:34:54,450
whether employers should be required to 
fully cover contraception.

2013
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,980
Even if they have religious jack.
How truncate she wants to get

2014
01:34:58,090 --> 01:35:01,570
paid to have sex.
That was it.

2015
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:04,510
That was basically it for him.
That fucking killed him.

2016
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:09,520
That guy has done.
It's really fascinating because rush 

2017
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:09,520
limbo was,
oh yeah,

2018
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:09,700
he's darling.
Oh yeah.

2019
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:13,280
His career is dropped off radically.
He's in like third,

2020
01:35:13,281 --> 01:35:15,290
fourth tier markets beheaded.
Whoa.

2021
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:18,130
Comment.
like it was like that bad with that guy.

2022
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:20,940
That guy.
He's always putting sros.

2023
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,760
Yeah,
but yeah,

2024
01:35:22,761 --> 01:35:25,310
that was just.
He was trying to be funny and stupid.

2025
01:35:25,311 --> 01:35:27,950
russia's trying to like push his 
ideology,

2026
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:30,680
but that killed that guy,
that guy,

2027
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:35,000
like advertisers fleed him in mass after
that.

2028
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:40,240
That's what did it.
Not the rampant racism and what is just 

2029
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:44,720
what he was also calling for drug 
addicts to be like.

2030
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:48,710
There was a guy who got prosecuted.
I forget what the story was,

2031
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:53,950
but a guy who got prosecuted for some 
drug related offense and the.

2032
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:59,760
The fucking judge literally told him 
when he was sentencing him that he was 

2033
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,211
listening to rush limbaugh on the way 
over and how Russia was saying that we 

2034
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:09,521
have to give drug abusers a wake up call
and that drug abusers need to know that 

2035
01:36:11,211 --> 01:36:16,211
there's consequences for their actions.
So because of this I'm going to fucking 

2036
01:36:16,211 --> 01:36:16,211
sentence you for x amount of blah blah,
blah,

2037
01:36:16,211 --> 01:36:16,370
blah,
blah.

2038
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,440
And the guy got released because of 
overcrowding.

2039
01:36:18,441 --> 01:36:23,441
I read it online.
I forget where I read it from either 

2040
01:36:23,441 --> 01:36:26,080
drug abusers really,
but this was right before rush got 

2041
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:30,311
popped for julian,
like 90 oxies a day and having his 

2042
01:36:30,311 --> 01:36:33,110
fucking made go out and buy him forum 
under assumed names.

2043
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:37,420
She's wearing a fake mustache.
so good.

2044
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:42,610
And she's buying.
This guy was like talking about this 

2045
01:36:42,610 --> 01:36:45,270
crazy shit on the radio while he was 
popping pill is how it is,

2046
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:45,650
man.

2047
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:49,040
All the anti gay people only have the 
gay prostitutes.

2048
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:50,750
it's like,
why are you so obsessed?

2049
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:53,990
We were playing ted cruz earlier on the 
earlier podcasts and I was like,

2050
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:57,980
I recognize sounds okay.
There's certAin sounds I recognize right

2051
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,600
when you.
When you hear a,

2052
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,310
do you think of a big black man?
Right?

2053
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:06,140
When ted cruz talks,
I hear a gay man.

2054
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,730
I hear a gay man is how he.
Why is he talking?

2055
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:11,240
Let's hear.
Let's hear ted cruz because he's gay.

2056
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:14,570
I think he's gay.
He's super conservative,

2057
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:19,930
super conservative,
but my thought is this guy cannot 

2058
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:22,961
fucking wait to get done talking.
just run up thrawn some women's clothes 

2059
01:37:22,961 --> 01:37:25,340
and suck some cock.
He just sounds gay.

2060
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:26,840
Now.
I don't know if he's gay,

2061
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,480
but I've never met anybody.
That sounds great.

2062
01:37:28,481 --> 01:37:30,740
It's not gay,
so nothing wrong with being gay.

2063
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:33,260
I want to say this again because I sit 
on the earlier podcasts.

2064
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,210
There's nothing wrong.
I'd love gay people,

2065
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,340
but I don't like is people are gross.
We just don't like or homophobes and

2066
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,140
today is that we need to reassemble the 
reagan coalition.

2067
01:37:43,141 --> 01:37:48,141
We need to bring together all of the 
different parts that comprise big 10 

2068
01:37:48,141 --> 01:37:49,140
about liberals who got elected 
president.

2069
01:37:49,141 --> 01:37:50,820
You'd be their president when we can say
to them,

2070
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:51,750
well but,
but listen,

2071
01:37:51,751 --> 01:37:53,340
there are different elements.
So you've got,

2072
01:37:53,341 --> 01:37:58,341
for example,
you've got to bring together and 

2073
01:37:58,341 --> 01:37:58,341
libertarians,

2074
01:37:58,341 --> 01:37:58,350
you've got differing views but shared 
values.

2075
01:37:58,430 --> 01:38:03,430
Okay.
That's about as straight as he's ever 

2076
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:03,430
sounded.
Find a better one.

2077
01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:06,440
But it's same sex marriage ruling 
because there's a same sex marriage 

2078
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,560
ruling.
He's trying to fucking straighten it up.

2079
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:13,190
He's lIke,
I don't want to be confused with any of 

2080
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:15,060
those.
The guy sounds gay.

2081
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,540
I don't know if he is gay.
There's nothing wrong with being gay,

2082
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:21,240
but he sounds gay.
I'm just saying it and people could say,

2083
01:38:21,241 --> 01:38:23,550
I sound gay to go ahead and say it.
I don't give a fuck.

2084
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:27,580
The world is on fire.
Comments to route them.

2085
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,540
Fire.
Here we go.

2086
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,100
And I will tell you,
you are a major celebrity there.

2087
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,900
Yeah.
Well it's a very small state.

2088
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:37,150
I mean it was

2089
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:40,970
impressive.
I mean I was earning major script street

2090
01:38:40,971 --> 01:38:45,971
cred.
I mentioned to a couple of folks I was 

2091
01:38:45,971 --> 01:38:45,971
going to be on your show.
They were blown away.

2092
01:38:45,971 --> 01:38:49,970
That sounds totally.
He sounds totally different than any 

2093
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:54,120
nation.
Being naked with a fucking apron on 

2094
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:54,120
baking.
Wow.

2095
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:58,060
Baking and sucking cock.
That's what ted cruz is best.

2096
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,390
Those two things that he does,
cupcakes and cock suck,

2097
01:39:01,391 --> 01:39:04,520
and that's it should be this campaign.
Get irish.

2098
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,090
Just fucking go for it.
Go for it.

2099
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:07,690
Just I'm tired.
Dude.

2100
01:39:07,691 --> 01:39:09,220
Is enough time.
It's still 2015.

2101
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:14,460
Okay.
November of 2016 is the cupcakes and 

2102
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,960
cocksucker ted cruz.
Hillary's got the pants,

2103
01:39:15,961 --> 01:39:17,430
suits you get the apron,
get in,

2104
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:18,370
get in,
and we're all taught.

2105
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:23,460
A year ago,
caitlin was bruce and no one gives a 

2106
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:23,460
fuck about it,
right?

2107
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:23,460
Right.
Right now he's caitlyn,

2108
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:24,160
right?
And everybody cares.

2109
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:25,740
Everybody loves her,
right?

2110
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:26,650
Right,
right.

2111
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,250
Cupcakes and cock sucking for president 
ted cruz.

2112
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:31,510
Ted.
Oh my god.

2113
01:39:31,511 --> 01:39:35,770
That's what's up.
He looks just he hollow black eyes.

2114
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:39,730
He's just a guy just trying to fucking 
stand down and make.

2115
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:45,030
Just trying to pick himself up as 
bootstraps and make the american dream 

2116
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:47,050
has just always weird.
It's always weird when someone goes,

2117
01:39:47,051 --> 01:39:52,051
they go that route.
AntI same sex marriage going against the

2118
01:39:52,511 --> 01:39:57,511
grain.
It's like I'm in a still prosecute 

2119
01:39:57,511 --> 01:39:57,550
miracle.
There's no place for gays.

2120
01:39:57,551 --> 01:39:59,080
Look at that fucking quote.
This is.

2121
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:03,310
There is no place for gays or atheists 
in my America.

2122
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:06,640
None.
Our constitution makes that clear.

2123
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,880
He said that in fucking march 15 at 
liberty university that has no place for

2124
01:40:15,701 --> 01:40:17,560
gays or ads.
That's so silly.

2125
01:40:17,561 --> 01:40:20,110
That's obviously a gay guy.
I hate to quote myself,

2126
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:25,560
but there's two types of people that 
hate gay marriage or people that are 

2127
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:26,260
really dumb or people that are secretly 
worried that dicks are delicious.

2128
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:29,720
I couldn't look at them.
That is of a john.

2129
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:34,270
Don't stick it in my mouth because I'll 
throw up.

2130
01:40:34,271 --> 01:40:39,271
Go ahead and I'll show it.
Don't put it in my.

2131
01:40:40,361 --> 01:40:45,361
But this is the world we live in.
abby martin.

2132
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:51,130
Is that the empire now?
What does a guy like that fit in?

2133
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:56,290
Where does a guy like that fit in the 
empire is just like some guys 

2134
01:40:56,290 --> 01:40:59,281
scrambling,
trying to get attention and run around 

2135
01:40:59,281 --> 01:40:59,281
the outside of the castle.
What about me?

2136
01:40:59,281 --> 01:41:01,680
I can be keen on that guys.
So you have these.

2137
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:05,380
He's not really.
He's just a side show,

2138
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:10,760
you know?
I know some people just like rick perry 

2139
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,811
Of the nigger had rent.
What branch and what?

2140
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:19,000
What is that ranch?
What are you talking to?

2141
01:41:19,001 --> 01:41:20,800
Rick perry's ranch.
Shut the fuck up.

2142
01:41:20,801 --> 01:41:24,660
His family.
Our family has a ranch called end.

2143
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:28,110
John,
please tell me your kenny.

2144
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:31,020
LIke refuse to take on the people and 
when he was running for president,

2145
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,280
people were like,
are you gonna?

2146
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:35,200
Do like a rebranding effort about like 
the ranch that your family owns?

2147
01:41:35,201 --> 01:41:37,870
And he was like,
it's all like historical.

2148
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:40,180
Oh no,
it's.

2149
01:41:40,181 --> 01:41:40,610
I can't.
You're,

2150
01:41:40,611 --> 01:41:45,611
my mother knows that real.
It's real.

2151
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:48,400
Come on.
Find that.

2152
01:41:50,430 --> 01:41:53,380
Oh my god,
it's true.

2153
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:57,850
Oh my god.
He's got a ranch called nigger head.

2154
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:00,930
Oh my god.
Price yet?

2155
01:42:00,931 --> 01:42:03,030
Yeah.
Oh my god.

2156
01:42:03,610 --> 01:42:06,460
Perry's version of the events difference
in many respects.

2157
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:12,010
Elections of seven people.
They painted the rock when they got the 

2158
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:14,980
offensive word saw the offensive word 
and they painted it over.

2159
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:16,000
Oh,
ever since.

2160
01:42:16,001 --> 01:42:19,570
Anytime I ever saw the rock,
it was painted over.

2161
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:25,830
Oh my god.
My mother and father went to the lease 

2162
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:28,030
and painted the rock.
Went to the least.

2163
01:42:28,031 --> 01:42:33,031
What does that mean?
Went to the release and painted the 

2164
01:42:33,031 --> 01:42:33,031
rock.
Neither 1983 or 1985.

2165
01:42:33,031 --> 01:42:36,670
Took them that long moves,
not until the eighties,

2166
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:41,671
and we realized that it was a bad that 
have really had to start respecting the 

2167
01:42:41,671 --> 01:42:44,410
damn black people around Texas.
ThAt's just what we call folks.

2168
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:50,390
Wait,
and didn't he also keep a dead fetus in 

2169
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:50,390
his fridge?
Oh my god.

2170
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:50,420
Is that really the sign that you showed?
No.

2171
01:42:50,421 --> 01:42:51,160
That's fake,
right?

2172
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:53,440
He kept a dead fetus in his fridge.
For what?

2173
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:55,420
Just because she put them like,
it's good.

2174
01:42:55,421 --> 01:42:57,790
It's good.
You don't want to waste those cells.

2175
01:42:57,791 --> 01:43:02,791
You don't want to throw those in the 
trash truck or used to sell that to the 

2176
01:43:02,791 --> 01:43:06,991
black market.
It would be if it was aborted fetuses 

2177
01:43:06,991 --> 01:43:09,110
that cured the gay q.

2178
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:12,940
Imagine how ironic you needed an aborted
fetus.

2179
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:16,030
Rick santorum's dead baby ritual.
What is that?

2180
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:17,890
Fuck.
I don't want to say that.

2181
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,260
Getting bummed out.
Anyway,

2182
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,880
I got to end this thing in about five 
minutes.

2183
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:23,060
Oh shit.
REally?

2184
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:25,030
Unfortunately.
I got a crazy day.

2185
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:25,840
Oh no.
Wait.

2186
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:29,920
Well,
anything else going on?

2187
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:35,070
Uh,
just everyone check out the grand 

2188
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:35,070
staircase.
What's going on with your art?

2189
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:36,130
You have beautiful art.
When we were in town doing some art.

2190
01:43:36,131 --> 01:43:41,131
Yeah,
I did an art show called cosmos itself 

2191
01:43:41,131 --> 01:43:41,131
and I'm actually doing another one in 
two days.

2192
01:43:41,131 --> 01:43:42,860
Everyone should check it out.
If they live in the la area called ethos

2193
01:43:42,861 --> 01:43:44,770
space,
it's going to be in downtown la.

2194
01:43:44,771 --> 01:43:46,870
Check it out.
Don't tons of freaky spot now,

2195
01:43:46,871 --> 01:43:47,830
isn't it?
It's fucking awesome,

2196
01:43:47,831 --> 01:43:52,831
man.
We're the fashion district and some 

2197
01:43:52,831 --> 01:43:52,831
crazy warehouse.
I don't say where you live.

2198
01:43:52,831 --> 01:43:54,050
I'm moving in three days,
so it's fine.

2199
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:59,080
Now you've got another ghost out.
There's a lot of freaky spots down 

2200
01:43:59,080 --> 01:43:59,470
there.
YeAh,

2201
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:04,570
like you gotta.
Make sure you don't go the wrong way 

2202
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:04,570
there.
Yeah.

2203
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:04,570
Yeah.
Which is great.

2204
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:04,570
It's like,
yeah,

2205
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:07,030
I'm sure that you've seen.
You've traveled a lot of countries.

2206
01:44:07,031 --> 01:44:09,740
I've seen a lot of horrible poverty.
Went to hades,

2207
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:14,770
sob bad things,
but then there's really nothing that 

2208
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:17,771
compares to skid row because it's this 
crazy community living on the fucking 

2209
01:44:18,351 --> 01:44:23,351
street just taking over downtown la,
like excess of huManity that's just 

2210
01:44:23,351 --> 01:44:26,831
spilled out mentally ill drug.
I mean they're just like shooting up in 

2211
01:44:26,831 --> 01:44:26,960
the street,
taking a shit.

2212
01:44:26,961 --> 01:44:29,150
It's fucking nuts.
Thousands of them.

2213
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:31,430
Thousands,
and it's blocks and blocks and blocks.

2214
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:36,170
It's just lIke society is just like 
abandoned this portion of their people.

2215
01:44:36,171 --> 01:44:39,470
It's very surreal and really scary and 
we live right by.

2216
01:44:39,471 --> 01:44:41,150
There is an interesting thing,
you know,

2217
01:44:41,151 --> 01:44:43,610
someone wants to look at them and go,
how do we capitalize on this market?

2218
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:46,880
So many people's trust.
how do we,

2219
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:51,290
how do we nail this homeless market?
I'm glad cans still going.

2220
01:44:51,291 --> 01:44:55,700
Strong body occupies just.
I was just making it work because you're

2221
01:44:55,701 --> 01:44:56,540
just right there.
You're like,

2222
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:57,440
wow.
Oh,

2223
01:44:58,130 --> 01:44:59,060
like,
oh damn.

2224
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:02,210
It's a fuckinG crazy scene.
I remember the first time I was there,

2225
01:45:02,211 --> 01:45:07,010
we were filling fear factory downtown 
and we were real close to it and someone

2226
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:10,130
brought it up and we drove by and how 
you gotta be fucking kidding.

2227
01:45:10,131 --> 01:45:11,510
This is real.
It's real.

2228
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:14,620
It's real.
Super big and there's no one and like,

2229
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:20,140
what do you do?
Most of them are just mentally ill and 

2230
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:20,140
drug addicts,
so it's like you don't.

2231
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:21,590
What can you do other than provide 
services like that.

2232
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:23,500
It's very just.
And then one of the fucking tens.

2233
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:28,510
It's so bizarre.
Has a giant american flag in it and 

2234
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:33,010
you're like,
I'm glad that you are still mirko all 

2235
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:33,590
about America.

2236
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:37,070
Little fucking skid row living america's
fault that I'm out here.

2237
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:39,050
My phone,
I'm the one to smoke the crack.

2238
01:45:39,530 --> 01:45:41,520
Uncle sam didn't put the correct pipe in
my mouth.

2239
01:45:41,521 --> 01:45:43,520
I didn't work hard enough.
Yeah.

2240
01:45:43,521 --> 01:45:48,521
Well the american dream,
there's a lot of mentally ill people 

2241
01:45:48,521 --> 01:45:51,130
during the reagan administration,
they sort of changed the rules for what 

2242
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:54,011
made you're mentally ill and what the 
distinctions were and that's when they 

2243
01:45:54,011 --> 01:45:55,610
sort of opened up the doors and let all 
these people on the street.

2244
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:00,640
I remember it like really,
really clearly when I was a kid because 

2245
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:02,230
there was a big debate like,
oh,

2246
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:03,560
like wait a minute.
You can't eat,

2247
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,490
and there's a lot of people that are 
like,

2248
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:09,491
you can't fucking do with those.
You can't just change the 

2249
01:46:09,491 --> 01:46:12,280
classification.
The classification for people that have 

2250
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:12,560
mental illness,
but they did and all throughout New York

2251
01:46:12,561 --> 01:46:13,310
and boston.

2252
01:46:13,550 --> 01:46:17,660
That was like all these new mentally ill
people wandering around the streets.

2253
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:22,900
it was like a real clear moments there.
I just read the statistic that 

2254
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,390
homelessness has gone up like 25 percent
in the last four years,

2255
01:46:24,450 --> 01:46:29,450
just in la if people homes on freeway 
overpass and jet and I remember like I 

2256
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:33,581
told you the five percent swear to god 
and I remember I posted it and someone 

2257
01:46:33,581 --> 01:46:33,581
was like,
dude,

2258
01:46:33,581 --> 01:46:34,580
just move out.
They can't afford la.

2259
01:46:34,581 --> 01:46:35,750
Just move out.
And I'm like,

2260
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:40,510
I can't afford them.
Once you go homeless,

2261
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:45,520
you don't have any money.
dude speaking really quickly before we 

2262
01:46:45,951 --> 01:46:47,330
wrap it up,
I wanted to tell you I,

2263
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:52,390
we sHould talk about Cuba next time 
because I there and did a whole report 

2264
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:52,390
on

2265
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:52,390
it,
but I'm zero homelessness.

2266
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:54,270
That was the most iconic thing about 
being in Cuba.

2267
01:46:54,271 --> 01:46:59,271
No trash,
no homelessness because everyone has 

2268
01:46:59,271 --> 01:47:01,851
their basiC needs,
the shelter and there's rational system 

2269
01:47:01,851 --> 01:47:06,381
and stuff,
but it was just interesting to see like 

2270
01:47:06,381 --> 01:47:07,850
the low crime rate when people have like
basic shelter and healthcare,

2271
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:11,760
a lot of problems still very interesting
because I.

2272
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:14,940
It was very different than every other 
latin american country.

2273
01:47:14,941 --> 01:47:15,900
I was just like,
holy shit.

2274
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:18,420
There's no homeless people.
Beggars and.

2275
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:20,420
No,
that's interesting.

2276
01:47:20,421 --> 01:47:25,421
Yeah,
it's not an ideal environment because 

2277
01:47:25,421 --> 01:47:27,801
you're forced into certain jobs and they
kind of decide what you do on certain 

2278
01:47:27,801 --> 01:47:27,801
jobs,
you know?

2279
01:47:27,801 --> 01:47:28,970
Nope,
that's bullshit.

2280
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:31,200
What about for athletes when they do 
that for athletes?

2281
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:34,710
So that's what my friend who's an 
economist actually when I came back from

2282
01:47:34,711 --> 01:47:35,190
Cuba,
she was like,

2283
01:47:35,191 --> 01:47:37,200
so how is it like everyone's assigned a 
job?

2284
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:37,800
And I was like,
no,

2285
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:42,801
it's not like a brave new world where 
we're babies are born in incubators and 

2286
01:47:42,801 --> 01:47:42,801
trained to be like,
you're a doctor,

2287
01:47:42,801 --> 01:47:44,250
you're a florist,
your this is not like that at all.

2288
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:46,020
And um,
you know,

2289
01:47:46,021 --> 01:47:48,870
there is a rational system and they do 
get paid very little.

2290
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:51,090
Um,
but it's just interesting because people

2291
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:52,680
just have a completely different 
mindset.

2292
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:54,720
Like I remember I spoke to a bunch of 
doctors and I was like,

2293
01:47:54,721 --> 01:47:56,910
why are you a doctor?
You're not getting paid anything.

2294
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:59,760
Like why would I care about it?
They're like,

2295
01:47:59,761 --> 01:48:02,410
I'm helping my community and family.
It's just like completely.

2296
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:05,370
It's just like a totally like a wall of 
understanding.

2297
01:48:05,371 --> 01:48:10,371
I'm like,
I'm coming from the hub of capitalism 

2298
01:48:10,371 --> 01:48:10,371
and I'm like,
I don't understand the incentive.

2299
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,240
So it's really,
it was really,

2300
01:48:12,241 --> 01:48:14,760
really fascinating.
But I'd recommend everyone check out.

2301
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:19,760
Um,
the Cuba series I did on breaking the 

2302
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:20,550
set if you want to learn more and I'm 
checkout ethos space.

2303
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:25,700
Abby martin.org
is my part that have lived there and 

2304
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:25,860
Cuba really hated it.
They hated the oppression.

2305
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:30,861
They hated the way they were treated.
They escaped because they had more 

2306
01:48:30,861 --> 01:48:31,740
opportunity in America.
You launched the athletes.

2307
01:48:31,741 --> 01:48:36,450
There's three laws that America has put 
into place that coke's defectors.

2308
01:48:36,451 --> 01:48:41,451
So one of them is basically trying to 
subvert cuba's whole medical 

2309
01:48:41,451 --> 01:48:44,421
internationalism.
So Cuba has been forced into this like 

2310
01:48:44,421 --> 01:48:44,970
because of the blockade,
the embargo,

2311
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:48,570
they've been forced into like total 
fucking self,

2312
01:48:48,571 --> 01:48:50,960
like you know what I mean,
like had like all organics and they have

2313
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:55,980
like,
like maintain these old cars and they 

2314
01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:55,980
like don't let anything break down and 
kinda cool.

2315
01:48:55,980 --> 01:49:00,060
And so they've also developed instead of
invading countries and bombing the shit 

2316
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:00,630
out of people,
they've also developed an entire,

2317
01:49:00,631 --> 01:49:03,800
like a medical thing for their income.

2318
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:06,600
So they basically lease out doctors 
around the world,

2319
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,330
even when you go back to the Haiti 
earthquake,

2320
01:49:09,331 --> 01:49:12,150
they were the first country that sent 
out the biggest contingent of doctors,

2321
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:17,210
a bola biggest contingent of.
So they basically leased out like 

2322
01:49:17,210 --> 01:49:18,270
doctors to get oil from Venezuela to 
like get help.

2323
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:23,660
Um,
it's interesting because people are 

2324
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:23,660
like,
oh,

2325
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:23,660
well they're,
you know,

2326
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:24,630
they're like creating doctors to like 
just get oil and shit.

2327
01:49:24,631 --> 01:49:25,140
It's like,
well,

2328
01:49:25,210 --> 01:49:30,210
there,
they're doing what they can with the 

2329
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:31,761
resources that they have.
They're under a very crippling economic 

2330
01:49:31,761 --> 01:49:34,431
embargo.
They have subversion programs going on 

2331
01:49:34,431 --> 01:49:35,430
through usa id every year.
Despite the normalization process that's

2332
01:49:35,431 --> 01:49:38,430
going on.
The usa id is still spending $20,000,000

2333
01:49:38,431 --> 01:49:41,490
a year to subvert cuba's political 
process.

2334
01:49:41,491 --> 01:49:45,060
So we've subverted the hip hop movement 
that we've created a fake hiv program.

2335
01:49:45,061 --> 01:49:50,061
We've created a fake twitter called zoom
zoom that's tried to like get people 

2336
01:49:50,061 --> 01:49:50,061
against castro.

2337
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:55,080
But the most disturbing part is this 
medical internationalism where you have 

2338
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:58,111
like 75,000
doctors working around the world on all 

2339
01:49:58,111 --> 01:50:01,591
these fronts.
And the us has created a law that said 

2340
01:50:01,591 --> 01:50:04,620
you can defect to the us and become a 
doctor here and just leave your posts.

2341
01:50:04,901 --> 01:50:07,540
So it's like,
why are we trying to subvert like actual

2342
01:50:07,541 --> 01:50:10,420
medical missions and humanitarian 
missions that cuba's doing?

2343
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:15,220
Really the only reason is because we 
want to subvert the socialist government

2344
01:50:15,221 --> 01:50:18,670
that survived after the cold war that we
still fucking can't accept.

2345
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:22,990
And there's also the wet foot dry foot 
policy that offers a cuban immigrants.

2346
01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:26,380
No other immigrant in the world has this
where you can just come here and just be

2347
01:50:26,381 --> 01:50:31,381
an american citizen if you're keeping.
Because no questions asked what foot 

2348
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:31,381
drive still?
Yep.

2349
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:33,960
Wow.
That must suck for mexicans.

2350
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:35,310
Like,
what the fuck,

2351
01:50:35,311 --> 01:50:36,020
man?
I'm like,

2352
01:50:36,090 --> 01:50:41,090
what is this bullshit like,
why shut down.

2353
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:44,880
I did not know that.
That's fascinating.

2354
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:47,600
It's really fascinating.
You should have a conversation with joey

2355
01:50:47,601 --> 01:50:48,840
diaz.
He'd be fucking screaming,

2356
01:50:48,841 --> 01:50:50,640
right?
He went to Cuba,

2357
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:53,730
came over on a boat and you know,
a lot of people,

2358
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:53,980
um,

2359
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:56,120
look when you're a cuban and your,
your,

2360
01:50:56,150 --> 01:51:01,150
your honor ration system and you're 
living in this country that's kind of 

2361
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:01,830
isolated and you're like watching 
american movies and you're like,

2362
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:04,710
why the fuck am I here?
Can be there,

2363
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:09,980
you know,
and you're seeing mountains of cocaine 

2364
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:09,980
and the cases and you're like,
why?

2365
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:14,120
But the problem is a lot of doctors 
defect and they come over here and then 

2366
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:17,391
they're,
they're caught for years and years and 

2367
01:51:17,391 --> 01:51:17,391
years they're,
they're licensed,

2368
01:51:17,391 --> 01:51:17,880
doesn't apply like they have to go 
through all day.

2369
01:51:17,881 --> 01:51:20,760
Ended up being like a waitress in a 
restaurant for a decade,

2370
01:51:20,761 --> 01:51:23,690
trying to become a practicing doctor.
But when I was over there,

2371
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:25,950
not only they have free health care 
obviously for everyone in the country,

2372
01:51:25,951 --> 01:51:29,460
but they also have an international 
medical school that trains doctors.

2373
01:51:29,461 --> 01:51:34,461
Whoever wants to train all over the 
world can go and just be a doctor for 

2374
01:51:34,461 --> 01:51:34,461
free.

2375
01:51:34,461 --> 01:51:34,800
So I met like 20 americans who were 
there and I was like,

2376
01:51:34,801 --> 01:51:36,840
why are you here getting your medical 
license?

2377
01:51:36,841 --> 01:51:41,841
And they're like,
because I don't want to fucking be 

2378
01:51:41,841 --> 01:51:41,841
$100,000
in debt in America,

2379
01:51:41,841 --> 01:51:46,820
and they're like,
I'm here to get my medical license so 

2380
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:46,820
then I can go train and be a doctor.
Wow.

2381
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:49,770
Free.
So a lot of shit can be talked about how

2382
01:51:49,771 --> 01:51:54,771
things are run,
but it's a totally different society 

2383
01:51:54,771 --> 01:51:58,371
when you have basic needs met and when 
healthcare and like humans come first 

2384
01:51:58,371 --> 01:52:01,110
out of necessity because of the blockade
because they had to create this.

2385
01:52:01,111 --> 01:52:05,970
Not necessarily of altruism,
but it's evolved in this such an insane.

2386
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:11,460
Just dichotomy of how society has 
functioned super interesting.

2387
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:14,130
What's going to be fascinating now the 
embargo has been lifted.

2388
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:17,040
It's going to be lifted.
It's still not enough.

2389
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:19,290
So now look,
travel restrictions.

2390
01:52:19,290 --> 01:52:24,290
Yeah.
So now they've looked at travel 

2391
01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:25,341
restrictions and now raul has like 
opened up some private enterprise and 

2392
01:52:25,341 --> 01:52:26,610
stuff and that was a whole diplomatic 
process within the country to where they

2393
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:31,670
lifted some economic things.
So now private businesses can flourish 

2394
01:52:31,670 --> 01:52:35,841
and so it's opening up because they've 
realized that they can't obviously have 

2395
01:52:35,841 --> 01:52:36,750
it like that forever.
Especially now that the travels lifted,

2396
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:38,760
but it's gonna be really interesting to 
see what happens,

2397
01:52:38,761 --> 01:52:41,910
especially now that the us still has 
this aversion tactics going on,

2398
01:52:41,911 --> 01:52:45,020
these programs in place that encouraged 
people to defect and then also get.

2399
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:46,160
It's a perpetual

2400
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,800
occupation of fucking Cuba that raul has
said time and again,

2401
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:52,760
give us guantanamo bay.
You leased it under false pretenses.

2402
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:55,790
We really want it back and the us as 
it's off the table.

2403
01:52:55,791 --> 01:53:00,290
So that's the way the empire works back 
basis.

2404
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:03,830
So how has that.
We liked least it 19.

2405
01:53:03,831 --> 01:53:08,831
Oh three.
We leased the guantanamo bay naval base 

2406
01:53:08,831 --> 01:53:09,380
was just a giant swath of land for 
housing,

2407
01:53:09,381 --> 01:53:12,380
but it's connected to Cuba.
It's on Cuba in Cuba.

2408
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,860
So we lease it.
Then what's battista was an alum,

2409
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:20,920
our boy,
but tessa was like a corporate fucking 

2410
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:20,920
lord,
you know.

2411
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:21,690
And so we had all these private 
enterprises in Cuba and,

2412
01:53:21,691 --> 01:53:26,691
and the socialist revolution happened 
and then the lease agreement said this 

2413
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:31,700
has to be agreed by both parties to 
continue or I'm sorry to dissolve.

2414
01:53:31,701 --> 01:53:33,470
And then when the cuban revolution 
happened,

2415
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:38,770
Cuba was like,
give us back guantanamo and the us was 

2416
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:38,770
like,
you know,

2417
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:39,080
we don't agree to that,
so we're just gonna keep it.

2418
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:45,760
And they never accepted a diamond,
never cashed a dime for the rent lease 

2419
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:46,860
after the 1956 or whatever the,
um,

2420
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,260
the revenue.
So yeah,

2421
01:53:48,261 --> 01:53:48,950
it was,
it was,

2422
01:53:50,150 --> 01:53:51,560
that's really disturbing to me because 
I'm like,

2423
01:53:51,561 --> 01:53:53,150
dude,
just fucking go down to a bay.

2424
01:53:53,151 --> 01:53:55,400
Like you can pretend that were normal 
with coupa,

2425
01:53:55,401 --> 01:53:58,400
but it's never gonna be normal unless 
you give them some respect and if you're

2426
01:53:58,401 --> 01:54:03,350
so scared of socialism and if you are so
sure that socialism is a failure,

2427
01:54:03,351 --> 01:54:05,680
then let them fucking fail on their own.
Lift the block caden,

2428
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:08,300
let Cuba just function and let's see 
what happens.

2429
01:54:08,301 --> 01:54:09,860
But right now,
um,

2430
01:54:09,861 --> 01:54:13,520
it's been so crippled in so many ways 
that it's impossible to really know what

2431
01:54:13,521 --> 01:54:15,560
the country would be like without us 
interference.

2432
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:20,590
Well,
it's very bizarre that we're allowed to 

2433
01:54:20,590 --> 01:54:22,420
trade with all sorts of different 
countries that are accused of all sorts 

2434
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:23,300
of different heinous crimes against 
humanity.

2435
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:26,400
But we can't with Cuba.
I mean,

2436
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:31,600
just thinking about all the different 
countries that we're allowed to trade 

2437
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:31,600
with.
It's fun to go to the Congo right now,

2438
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:33,880
hang out with you,
do whatever the fuck you want.

2439
01:54:33,881 --> 01:54:35,090
You know,
Saudi Arabia,

2440
01:54:35,091 --> 01:54:36,490
we go back and forth with them all the 
time.

2441
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:41,680
Chicks just got the right to vote.
You hear that like weeks,

2442
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:44,660
like it was on.
It was in the news yesterday.

2443
01:54:44,740 --> 01:54:46,340
Oh my god.
If my twitter.

2444
01:54:46,341 --> 01:54:47,440
Jimmy.
Yeah,

2445
01:54:47,550 --> 01:54:52,550
it was Saudi Arabia.
Women in Saudi Arabia are going to get 

2446
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:53,260
the right to vote now.
Hallelujah.

2447
01:54:53,330 --> 01:54:54,170
Hallelujah.
Look,

2448
01:54:54,171 --> 01:54:58,170
it's 2015 I guess.
Take off your burqas.

2449
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:59,440
Nope.
Nope,

2450
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:00,310
no,
I'll do that.

2451
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:01,880
We have at liberty than yet.
No,

2452
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:03,320
well,
I live in Iran.

2453
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:08,350
They were just fucking tons of makeup.
They look hot as fuck and I just wear 

2454
01:55:08,350 --> 01:55:09,290
skin tight clothes because you're not 
allowed to show shit,

2455
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:12,110
but they were like yoga pants,
like a total work around,

2456
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:13,580
but they have to have that thing on 
their head.

2457
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:16,790
Woman are allowed to vote in Saudi 
Arabia for the first time in history.

2458
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:19,720
That's August 24th,
2015.

2459
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,740
Bam.
15th,

2460
01:55:22,510 --> 01:55:24,920
15 for the first time in the country's 
history,

2461
01:55:24,921 --> 01:55:25,790
women's,
Saudi Arabia.

2462
01:55:25,791 --> 01:55:30,791
I've been given the right to vote and 
stand as political candidates in the 

2463
01:55:30,791 --> 01:55:30,791
upcoming elections.
Wow.

2464
01:55:30,791 --> 01:55:33,830
But it's just amazing,
but just don't,

2465
01:55:33,831 --> 01:55:36,250
don't drive.
Don't your ankles have your.

2466
01:55:36,650 --> 01:55:41,650
I guess the man needs to escort them to 
the voting booths because they still 

2467
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:41,810
can't do anything without a male 
permission.

2468
01:55:41,870 --> 01:55:43,160
Of course.
It can't even drive.

2469
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:46,830
They can vote and they can't drive.
You have the king,

2470
01:55:47,150 --> 01:55:48,480
the former king.
I'm sorry.

2471
01:55:48,481 --> 01:55:51,630
Praise be with him.
Fucking peace be upon him.

2472
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:53,400
He used to be upon abdula,
but no,

2473
01:55:53,401 --> 01:55:55,530
his daughters are like trapped in a 
dungeon.

2474
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:57,430
Like being starved.
What?

2475
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:02,750
Yeah,
they're like living in underground in 

2476
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:05,091
some bunker that like they're trapped.
They did an interview with someone and 

2477
01:56:05,091 --> 01:56:05,091
saying,
help us.

2478
01:56:05,091 --> 01:56:09,051
We're.
We like disobeyed our father and we're 

2479
01:56:09,051 --> 01:56:09,051
being punished for.
Yeah,

2480
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:10,620
it's super crazy.
You look it up.

2481
01:56:11,820 --> 01:56:13,680
Grand staircase to go to the grand 
staircase.

2482
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:16,560
Every time I talked to abby martin,
she gets more depressing.

2483
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:18,930
Things to look up listening.
Always.

2484
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,230
Awesome.
Talk to me anytime you want.

2485
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:23,220
Anytime.
Anytime my friend.

2486
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:24,750
All right,
that's it for today.
