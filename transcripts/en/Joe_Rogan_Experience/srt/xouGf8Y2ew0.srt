1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,130
Power were full.
Greg fits.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,310
We were reading this bad
ass Abraham Lincoln quote.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,880
It's a quarrel not at all.
No Man.

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,870
Resolve to make the most of himself
can spare time for personal contention.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,370
And there's a lot more of the quote,

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:20,550
but you'll forget it by the
time towards the end of it. Um,

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,900
find that quote and listen to it or
read it rather. Where can I find it?

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,940
A Dane Cook's Instagram page.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,980
I'm Dane headed a posted Dane has a few,
too many,

10
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:36,960
a inspirational post to my likings but
uh, I don't mind this one. It's very good.

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,380
This one's very good. Now I'm just
busting his balls. His aren't that bad.

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,490
They're a little odd. It's pictures
a little odd. He's, he's at,

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,070
he's in very good shape.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,520
We're just talking about what a bad
motherfucker Abraham Lincoln was.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,220
Yeah. I mean when he came up, literally
dirt poor and uh, found his way.

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,280
You know, one of these guys
that like was working nonstop.

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,210
I think he worked in a
pharmacy or something and uh,

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,730
12 hours a day and yet put himself
through law school by reading books.

19
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,680
Like the guy lived in the library,

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,180
he's one of the most well read presidents
of all time and he was a real fucking

21
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:16,650
intellectual, but he, he made his
way based on that quote. He can't,

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,150
he came in and he was attacked and he was
marginalized because all the guys were,

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,890
you know, they were set, the politicians,

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,060
they had the money and the position and
they just kept stripping them down and

25
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:29,250
he kept moving past it,
flowing past it.

26
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:31,950
And then think about what you
do with slavery. He had to,

27
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,450
he had to fucking go to war and you know,

28
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:41,190
basically know that half the country
wants to fucking kill you and you just,

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,950
you go right around that and you go note,
we got a bigger goal here.

30
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,840
If you ever had a conversation, one of
those, uh, southern deniers, but no,

31
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:53,850
that's not what the board was about,
man. The war was about economics. Okay.

32
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,730
The war was about economics and they,

33
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,740
but they usually don't
have the whole story. Like,

34
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:03,090
I don't know the whole story of what
the economic aspect of the civil war,

35
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,990
remember Matt down either. You know
what I mean? Like they just want to,

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,720
they just want to have that to say it.

37
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,210
Yeah. Matt Graham had a joke about that.
Remember Matt Graham? Is that, yeah,

38
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:15,450
they say it's about economics.
Yeah. You weren't paying the help.

39
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,830
Yeah. I mean it was a bad economics in
the sense that cotton was our fucking was

40
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,790
everything in this country. We're just
exporting cotton and without the slaves,

41
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,470
the business model didn't work.

42
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,700
Is that really what it was about? Is that
what the war was about or did it have,

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,520
wasn't there some other economic point
of contention? Wasn't there something?

44
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,473
I don't,
I don't even want to,

45
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,190
well, it was basically about state
states' rights versus federal rights.

46
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:47,340
And states should be able to decide
whether or not slavery was legal.

47
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,030
And then when they got out to the, um, uh,

48
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:55,370
what was the territory that they,
the state it was going to be, um,

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,000
you know, incorporated. And they were,

50
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,510
they were fighting whether or they
should be a Kansas, Nebraska Act.

51
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,590
Once they hit Kansas and Nebraska, that's
when they, that's when they had to, uh,

52
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,580
decide whether or not new states we're
going to be able to have slavery or not.

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,000
Oh, so really was all about slavery.
Yeah. Oh, 100%. Pretty much.

54
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,350
So whatever economic thing,

55
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:18,980
it's just like based on the economics
of you not being able to have slaves

56
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:19,580
anymore.

57
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,880
So it's not really an economic issue
was why do I think it was like something

58
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:27,380
about there was some issue about banking.
I probably should look it up, but uh,

59
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,930
well the banking I think came later.
I think that was with the Hamilton.

60
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,670
Alexander Hamilton created the
National Bank, you know, and uh,

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,580
that was not popular
in the southern states.

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,510
Just imagine that less than 200 years ago,

63
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,920
1865 was when slavery was
abolished. Right, right.

64
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,190
Stop thinking about that.
Right. It's so recent.

65
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,210
I know Grayson to God.
It's terrifying.

66
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,750
It's terrifying to think that we are
just now getting out of the muck of the

67
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:07,340
caveman life.
Barely pull her feet out of the muck.

68
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,980
Great. Any fucking years
ago. I mean, he got so crazy.

69
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,130
He's got black people today. They
can say like, I had a grandparent,

70
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,440
it was a sleigh ride,
so fucking abso-fucking-lutely.

71
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,970
I'm so fucking little way. There's
gotta be a few of those. I mean what,

72
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:26,930
how old would you be?

73
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,680
You were 1865 is 140 50 years.

74
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,680
Right, so that's like if they had a
kid when they're maybe not grandfather,

75
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,010
great grandparents,
great grandparents,

76
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,520
other black people do have kids really
young. Yeah, I could generation is soft.

77
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,363
Rude.

78
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,590
Well that would be bad for it because
you really would want to have kids very

79
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,424
late.

80
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,480
He over there for the kid stay alive
long enough to to be alive to remember a

81
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:01,720
parent or grandparent. It probably,
maybe the grandparent might be possible.

82
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,790
40 40 and 40 right.

83
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,920
If you look at 120 if like a
40 is like about as old as men

84
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,820
usually have kids that would take you
up to 1900 then the next kid would take

85
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:17,540
you up to 1940 1940 yeah.
That's the kid.

86
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,690
Grandkid would be 1980
and that kid still alive.

87
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,740
Yeah, that's totally possible. Would
that be a great crank it one. One One?

88
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,230
Yeah.
Either way.

89
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,920
I was thinking on podcasts when you're,

90
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,640
when you're like going through like
everything I just said about slavery,

91
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,880
big chunk of it probably will be wrong
and like in a regular conversation that

92
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:40,240
would just slide by,

93
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,170
but people that can be listening to
this that like our fucking historians or

94
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:45,070
have Wikipedia.

95
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,340
Okay.

96
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,830
Yeah. And they're going to
annihilate me on Twitter.

97
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,330
Okay.
So I guess there were some issues.

98
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,180
There were some contrasting
economic issues.

99
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,790
The United States was still primarily
agricultural in the years before,

100
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,650
during and immediately
after the civil war.

101
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,730
About three quarters of the population
lived in rural areas including farms and

102
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,930
small towns.
Nevertheless,

103
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:10,370
the industrial revolution that it
hit England decades before gradually

104
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,440
established itself on the former colonies,

105
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,020
factories are built over
the north and south.

106
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:18,170
The vast majority of the
industrial manufacturing was
taking place in the north

107
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,410
south. I'd almost 25% of the
country's free population,

108
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:23,120
but only 10% of the country's capital.

109
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:28,121
In 1860 the north had five times the
number of factories is a south and over 10

110
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,260
times the number of factory
workers. Wow. So the norm,

111
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,100
it was really like a bunch of people
that were adopting or adapting rather to

112
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:38,390
this new way of living.

113
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:42,500
The industrial revolution engines
and cities and urbanization,

114
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,770
and then people that were really rural
and these are the people that had slaves.

115
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,760
The vast majority of them.

116
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,800
The country is really rural.
That's crazy.

117
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,230
And the slave trade was growing
just like wildfire. You know,

118
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,190
they just couldn't bring enough slaves
into the country. That's so crazy.

119
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,750
Yeah. I forget the statistics
on the number of slaves
versus the number of white

120
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,010
people,
but it was going to get,

121
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,820
it was going to get to where there
was going to be a revolution. Anyway,

122
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,970
here what it says, most southern
white families did not own slaves.

123
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,210
Only about 384,000 of the 1.6 million
did just stop and think about that for a

124
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,570
second.
Only one out of four,

125
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,910
but only 384,000 people owned slaves.

126
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,580
Like you're not taught, there's not that
many people alive back then. This is

127
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,270
1.6 million.
That's one out of four and

128
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,190
that's just in,
in the United States.

129
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,020
The people are doing this
all over the world, right?

130
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,700
I mean this is what they did back then

131
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,850
forever. I mean we are,
we're only now in the,

132
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:54,210
in the realm where we come down
on the countries itself, slavery,

133
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:58,380
you know the countries
like Kuwait and Qatar,

134
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,670
but this is a weird statistic.
The way they've got it framed,

135
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,940
only about 384,000 and a 1.6
million did upstairs only no biggie.

136
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,770
Whatever, whatever. No biggie.

137
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,360
Just more than a third of a million.
Yeah.

138
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,130
Hundreds of thousands of
people own people. You know,

139
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:27,160
it's barely just one out of four.
No big deal.

140
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,770
And you know, they probably owned the
average, probably owned at least three,

141
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,820
which means there was a one to one
ratio of slaves to white people.

142
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,710
They just didn't have the gun.

143
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,500
Let me throw this at you.
How many people in dogs?

144
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,550
Everybody?
What do you,

145
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:50,290
what number do you think that of all
the households that have done this,

146
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,970
10% 50% maybe it feels like,
right?

147
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,270
You got a dog, got a dog, you gotta go?

148
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,600
No, Jamie's a solo lone
wolf out there. He is.

149
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,890
The dog gets on top of the
roof in the house at night. Um,

150
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,540
I would say it's probably less than 50%.
I'd say Leicester.

151
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,110
Let's just take guests. You, you say 50

152
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,150
I bet you in rural areas it's higher if
you live in San Francisco on a studio

153
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:17,984
apartment.

154
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,060
What does it say there, Jamie? Pet
ownership. 67 million households had pets.

155
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,900
Yeah, but that could be like a turtle. I
want to know how many people have dogs?

156
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,900
62% include at least one pat.

157
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:33,450
So that could be dogs. Cats. Yeah.

158
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,470
Well that's the 1970s there's
not that many people back then.

159
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,970
Here we go. 70 to 80
million dogs. Wow. Okay.

160
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,050
That was a 37 to 40% of houses have dogs.
Yeah.

161
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,210
So I was right.
Bitch,

162
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,690
I want to see how right we were on all
that other bullshit. Kansas, Nebraska.

163
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:02,390
Act is probably the old that's
probably getting the 70s,

164
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,800
the 1970s I don't know.
I could've been totally wrong,

165
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,730
but it makes sense that it's like 40%

166
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,740
but it's not much different.
I mean,

167
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,010
where they're talking about like 25% is
that what they were saying? Had Slaves,

168
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,190
25% of the population or
somewhere in that neighborhood?

169
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,680
Well, 300 and something thousand
at 1.6 million. So one out of four,

170
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,730
half the number of people that have dogs,
right.

171
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,400
In relationship to the population.
That's madness. That's madness. I mean,

172
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,170
no wonder why black
people are still pissed

173
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,800
and they treat dogs better. Oh, in some
ways. Sure. You are you kidding me? You,

174
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:42,520
him dog sees a dog on TV.
The fucking a ASP sale today for sure.

175
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,030
Down. Yeah, for sure.

176
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,280
That's why the 12 years a slave
really hit me because you know the,

177
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:53,240
the thing that Terentino's did first a,
um, what was it called? Django did Django.

178
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,660
It was like, you know, there
was a comic book element to it.

179
00:10:56,661 --> 00:11:01,040
So they were playing a big buts,
but 12 years a slave was like,

180
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,360
wow. Yeah. They used to fucking
beat and starve and raped them.

181
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,260
It wasn't just that they were owned.
It was a holocaust.

182
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,700
Yeah. It's, it's
terrifying. It's terrifying.

183
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:17,600
The human beings are capable of doing that
just a couple hundred years ago. Yeah.

184
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,650
Less.
Less.

185
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,590
You think we'd ever do it
again? Yes. I think, yeah, just

186
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,000
fell apart.
I think if things fell apart,

187
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,560
what I think is what we got now with
electricity and air conditioning and

188
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:32,390
civilization laws and rules and amp,

189
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,940
a general amount of prosperity,
like as bad as economy is,

190
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,470
is hard as it gets it is to get a job. For
a lot of folks, there's a lot going on.

191
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,430
There's a lot of shit
happening, right? If you,

192
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:47,620
you might be able to find your way into
this crazy mix of humanity that is a,

193
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:47,891
you know,

194
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:52,891
an urban center in Los Angeles
or Chicago or New York or this,

195
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,950
but there's a lot of shit happening,
a lot of shit happening,

196
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,480
but all that stuff needs electricity.
All that stuff needs it.

197
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,350
You have to have,

198
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:05,230
the infrastructure has to be in
place to get the people that food.

199
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,700
That has to be no stress at all.

200
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,310
You have to mitigate their stress
in as many ways as possible.

201
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,570
Give them activities to do so they burn
themselves out then and only then can

202
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:15,580
you have those kind of beautiful civil,

203
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:19,270
and we know that we're moving towards
these kind of beautiful civilizations

204
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:23,620
being everywhere that it's like slowly
but surely we're going to eradicate most

205
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,740
of the violence and the most of the
bullshit that that's involved in being a

206
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:28,060
person in less.

207
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,630
Some shit goes down like a super volcano
or an asteroid impact and there's just

208
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,590
nothing left.

209
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,400
Or video tapes of cop speeding black
people again and again and again

210
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,810
and again and again and again.

211
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,220
The other guy in Texas the other
day just see that the party. Yeah.

212
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,200
Fuck being a cop dude for,
how about that?

213
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,340
How about showing up at a pool party
with a bunch of drunk kids and you've got

214
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:55,250
to fucking wrangled them? Could, do you
remember when you were 17 or 18 or over?

215
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:59,750
The [inaudible] guys are, oh I don't
know how old the pool party people were.

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,430
But you know the young,

217
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:06,020
let's go any age between 18 to 30 and the
cops show up and you're hammered. Fuck.

218
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,080
I remember one time we used to drink up
at the bleachers behind the high school,

219
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,150
typical Norman Rockwell's scene.
And uh,

220
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,620
the cops used to come up and they'd have
to get out of their car and crossed the

221
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:20,880
football field and then we fucking
scattered into the woods by then.

222
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,030
But one time I waited down because it was
so like they came every night and they

223
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,290
went up and I went into the car and I took
the, uh, the hat. It's like a Cobb salad

224
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,170
cause you knew that they were
going to go up the hill. Clarius

225
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,970
Instagram today you can wear pictures,

226
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,650
make a dummy and put the hat on and
beat it. Put the hat over your face.

227
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,310
Look completely cover your face.

228
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,260
You're walking off into a sock while
you're looking at for your hat.

229
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,170
Here's The New York City
Police Department for you.

230
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,560
Whenever you'd fuck your
girlfriend with the hat on Polo Ba.

231
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,060
Yeah. You reenact the whole thing.
You get a siren. Pull her over.

232
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,510
Let me see your license and your vagina.
Do that badly tenant scene. Oh my gosh.

233
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,050
She sucks it. You have to suck
it to get out of the ticket.

234
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,640
Will does she like sucked her thumb,
right? Or did she suck his dump?

235
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:23,160
She didn't speak. She sucked his
thumb. Right. Was one of those right.

236
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,220
Imagine though Europe
board cop down south.

237
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:30,210
You got fucking nothing to do
all day and some daisy Duke,

238
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,340
you pull over some little daisy
Duke. She's scared. She can't chair.

239
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:39,840
She can't have her daddy find out she got
a ticket. She'll do anything. Come on.

240
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,570
It's happened for sure. Your wife's fat
cause you live down south to get fat.

241
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,230
Some of them stayed thin. It's a new day.
This is late. It's the only ones. No,

242
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:55,220
I don't think they get a lot of starchy
foods. Yeah. It's not their fault.

243
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,510
They fry everything. They fry
everything and uh, you know,

244
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:02,450
like doughnuts or kids like we, you
and I, when does that sound muted?

245
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,070
Donut donut recently.
Did you Krispy Kreme about,

246
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,470
we'll say a month ago. They have every
day. Yeah. You can't do that now.

247
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,400
I like a good blueberry muffin though.

248
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,260
I'll allow myself a blue
and I'm on the road.

249
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,770
I eat a blueberry muffin for breakfast.
The curry four days a week. It's so good.

250
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,790
It's so good. And they're really just
cake. Just cake. Tricking yourself.

251
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,810
You want to cook? Okay, so with
the oxidants in here, fresh fruit,

252
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,500
it the accident. It's a
cake. It's a breakfast cake.

253
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,100
It's all sharing shit entity.
I don't eat the bottom part.

254
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,380
I remember Frank Frank Cinderella,
he had a bit, he's like,

255
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,110
I'm losing weight and you
know you gotta be disciplined.

256
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,830
You've got to take it seriously.
When I take the top off that hog and does,

257
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,560
you know how there's always a
little bit ice cream stuck to it.

258
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,540
I throw that right out.

259
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,370
So not only is it funny that
there's barely any on there,

260
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:03,371
but that it implies that he's going to
finish because he doesn't need the top

261
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:04,784
anymore.

262
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,430
Frank Santos? No, Santa's
rally. Santos was the hypnotist.

263
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,850
Frank, Cinderella was a funny
guy. Oh, up to did that.

264
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,690
Nice run the sopranos. And
then, um, I don't know,

265
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,910
man. I know that a very few guys
had to delivery that motherfucker.

266
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,720
What a pro would, uh, in
control. Eloquent guy. Yeah.

267
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:35,550
It was a very powerful performer.
It's white.

268
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:37,040
It's always weird when you
don't hear about a guy.

269
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,310
I looked up what goes under would,
what is he up to?

270
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,763
I don't know.

271
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Put on some weight that fucking the
grind of getting over that initial hump,

272
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,040
you know? So it's like one of
the hardest things for a comic.

273
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,830
The grind of getting over
that initial hump to two.

274
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,520
You become like a known national
act. We work alone. Right. You know,

275
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,980
did you read that book? Uh, I just
got turned on to that book by, um, uh,

276
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,000
Tom Dreesen.
It's called a,

277
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,810
it's about the comedy store back in the
70s. I'm going to get you a copy of this.

278
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,740
What's it called? Somebody brought
it up. Who brought those up?

279
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,750
Called don't make me jump or Jesus Christ
because it's about the guy who killed

280
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:27,800
himself during the con. The comedy.
Strike that. The laugh factory.

281
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,130
You know what the rudest thing I've ever
heard about that guy. What are barriers?

282
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:34,650
Like it wasn't really that good
jump.

283
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,320
Nobody cared if that got a job right.

284
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:44,180
He was just like making it all about
him. Right, right. Big Statement.

285
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,390
That's hilarious. And pay the comics.
The only think I didn't even work.

286
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,980
I'm dying up here. It's called. Oh yeah,

287
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,181
I've heard the name.
Oh,

288
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:56,181
I can't believe it's like literally from
day one it traces the beginnings of the

289
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:59,850
uh, comedy store all the way
through. And the crazy thing is,

290
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,110
here's how they describe it.

291
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
It's a room with a kind of down
and dirty comics got together.

292
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:08,400
There was a back hallway
where people were all talking,

293
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,920
hitting on women that were going
in and out of the bathroom.

294
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,540
Pod smoke everywhere.
I mean,

295
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:16,230
it is to a t from the 1970s to today.

296
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,700
Almost exactly the same.
I mean, that's incredible.

297
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,500
That's amazing. That's
amazing. Did you audition?

298
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,080
Yes. You did. Yes. Yeah. I didn't pass.
Here's what people don't understand.

299
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:36,081
Joe Rogan was a headliner with TV credits
who was headlining all the New York

300
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:39,180
clubs. You come out to La, you
want to work the comedy store.

301
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,830
W W what's the process?

302
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,430
I do five minutes of did five minutes
from Mitzi and she made me a non paid

303
00:18:45,431 --> 00:18:49,720
regular. So what that means is you
get to go on at the end of the show,

304
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,170
which is what time after the last set
was 1230 that could have happened at any

305
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:02,800
time between 1230 the actual time it's
scheduled two one ish depending on who

306
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:03,634
shows up.

307
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,530
It could be one 30 I got on at one 30
many times and I would get on and not get

308
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:11,350
paid and just do the sets
after everybody was done.

309
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,200
And this is history. You were an
established headlining comedic.

310
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,500
I did it every night. I did it every
night. Yeah. I'd said I just want this.

311
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,840
Like I just felt like,

312
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:26,610
I just want her to know that I'm serious
about this and a lot of respect for her.

313
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,830
Totally. That police was Mecca man.
When we were starting out and stitches,

314
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,380
everybody would talk about the comedy
store in La with hushed whispers. Right.

315
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,540
It was more important to me to be a paid
regular than it was to be on a sitcom.

316
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,840
Yeah. I really didn't. The Sitcom
thing was great. I was like, oh great,

317
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:45,750
I've got money now. This
is awesome. I don't have to
worry about my bills anymore.

318
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:50,160
Yeah. But it wasn't what I was really
after. What it was really after.

319
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:54,180
It was a comedy store. I was like, I
gotta be a paid regular here. Right.

320
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:59,181
And so I did those a non paid regular
sets every fucking night until like three

321
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:03,770
or four months later. She sat down
and looked at me again and uh,

322
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,130
there's a dude named the Todd and he's
not around anymore. He got real sick.

323
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,360
He had a like a brain issue, like a tumor
or something like that, like real bat.

324
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:13,860
And he goes,
you get real sick.

325
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,630
It was really sad to watch because that
guy is the reason I got into the comedy

326
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,970
storm. Wait, what's his
name again? The Todd.

327
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,490
And he sat in there right next to Mitzi
and he just laughed really hard at

328
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,230
everything I did. And he told me, he
goes, dude, I hooked you up. He goes,

329
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:31,440
I sat next to Mitzi.

330
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,740
I told her you were brilliant and I
laughed at all your jokes. And he goes,

331
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:35,640
that's how you got to do it.

332
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,970
If you want to get people in that are
good next time when someone comes by,

333
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,300
like you gotta do that to them.
And I was like, you got it perfect.

334
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,440
That's what you gotta do once she likes
you. And once she, she loves you, you,

335
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:48,040
you become family.
Like

336
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,930
you can introduce her to
funny people. She'll, she'll
listen. But other than that,

337
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:56,260
let me, you could fucking, you
could just not catch her. You know,

338
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:57,880
you could just not be there in the night.

339
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:02,170
She wants to come in or her health was
slowly starting to fade at the time she

340
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:06,490
was still mobile and she would talk to
you and she was very lucid, you know,

341
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,280
in 94 when I first started, she
was very there. She was there.

342
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:12,070
She would look at you and talk
to you about comedy and you know,

343
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,390
knew what you were doing right.

344
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,580
And knew what you were doing
wrong and knew where to put you.

345
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,810
But as time went on, you know,
she came around less and less.

346
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,310
So it was harder and harder for the guys
that were trying to get seen. You know,

347
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:27,670
the guys who were trying to get past
now it became someone else besides Mitzi

348
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:29,350
did start pass, you know.
And that was like a,

349
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,360
and this would be like at 1230 on that
she would be looking at people are

350
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,520
shooting? No, no. He chewed up the
schedule. You on an open mic night. Okay.

351
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:42,160
I would go up every other night, every
night I could, I would go, you know when,

352
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,290
whenever I can get up. But I think he get
up every night cause like some nights,

353
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:49,640
like maybe Dane Damon Wayne's will
show up or these other people show up.

354
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,440
Well that was the wrap on the place. Cause
when I first came out I was, I was, uh,

355
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,861
I was always,

356
00:21:54,861 --> 00:21:58,670
I don't know if I was intimidated or
indignant about having to audition for

357
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:01,070
Mitzi, but I sort of got in at the, uh,

358
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,930
the other clubs and then
I just never did it.

359
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:07,290
And part of the reason too is I had heard
that you could get bumped for an hour

360
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:11,780
or buy like a Wayne brother and stopping
in. And I was just like, you know what?

361
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:13,970
I just don't,
I didn't want to do that.

362
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,910
There's this thing that comedians really,

363
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:21,230
some comedians I should say really like
to do and that's like show up at a show

364
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,770
whenever they want and just go on stage.
That's what they do every night.

365
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,970
They show up and they go on stage because
it's a not for 10 minutes and they got

366
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,130
for fucking 45. Some of them do. Yeah.

367
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,530
It becomes this weird carte blanche,

368
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:37,130
like you're not even on the schedule
and you just make it all about you.

369
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,270
And you could do that because you made
it, you know, it's a, it's a very,

370
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,061
it really interesting.

371
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:44,780
I don't think there's any other business
in the entertainment business in the

372
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,500
world. It's quite like that.
Like I think if a band,

373
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,300
like if this band was playing,
uh,

374
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,040
in some local club and they're doing
their set and the black keys showed up and

375
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,030
they just wanted to go up there,
well you can do it after the show's over.

376
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,390
You show,
you know,

377
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,080
I mean I would imagine I'm just
talking about like we'll do a club,

378
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,090
he'll call them on Wednesday and say I
want to do this weekend and I'll pay.

379
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:10,310
He pays out the other acts on the shell.

380
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,180
They can only tweet it and then
it sells out in a couple hours.

381
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,100
But like why not?

382
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:20,450
Like my whole thing is if
you stop by at nine 20,

383
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:25,430
right in the tits spot of the shell and
you do 45 like when did it occur to you

384
00:23:25,431 --> 00:23:26,810
that you might stop by?
What about,

385
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,890
did it happen at noon where you could
have called in and accommodated people a

386
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:35,240
little bit or did you have to just shell
up right before you want to go on the

387
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:38,890
alarm of on walk in and be
the next act on the shelf?

388
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,900
Some people love doing that.
It's not their favorite thing.

389
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:45,880
They don't want to even call in for
spots. That's, they just want to do right

390
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,740
at. Some guys will do it for
10 minutes, which is great.

391
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:52,190
Louis C K wants to stop in on my
show that I'm on and do 10 minutes.

392
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,470
That's fucking great at Jack's.
The crowd up,

393
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,130
it makes it a special night for them and
it's good for the club so I don't care,

394
00:23:58,131 --> 00:23:59,150
but do 10 minutes.

395
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,440
Yeah. Um, it's just,

396
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,230
I think there's the one benefit in it
for them is that if you become like super

397
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:12,210
famous, like fuel, like Louis Ck,
standup comedy famous and you,

398
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:16,530
uh, you have shows places you're
going to get your crowd all the time.

399
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,570
Whereas if you just show up randomly
and no one knows you're going to be at,

400
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:20,980
that's true.

401
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,900
That's the only time you're going to
get an impartial crowd or you know,

402
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,840
semi impartial crowd. Yeah,
no, that's a good point.

403
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,920
I think that's very critical for a
lot of guys in the development process

404
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:35,850
because that's one of the things that
Steve Martin and said we'd like killed him

405
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,710
and made him not want
to do standup anymore.

406
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,390
So he got so big when he was in
that let's get small error that era,

407
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,010
like he was a monster. Lincoln,
maybe people don't know like you,

408
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:49,080
you need to go and uh,
listen to, let's get small.

409
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:53,340
I'm sure it's probably available online
somewhere, but it's an amazing album.

410
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,690
When Steve Martin was just on fire,
he was so good.

411
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,660
He was so funny and so silly

412
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,730
and so specific. He had a voice. Yeah.

413
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,230
That you couldn't really pinpoint
what exactly his character was.

414
00:25:08,231 --> 00:25:11,920
It was just like this kind of dumb,
egotistical guy.

415
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:16,600
But he also had really absurd, almost
Steven. Right. Kind of thoughts, dude.

416
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:18,700
He was amazing. Yeah. He really was.

417
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,050
How amazing he was.
That was his best work by far.

418
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,810
And it almost hurts my feelings that,
I mean,

419
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:27,300
he was a great actor and
he did some great movies,

420
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,920
but it almost hurts my feelings that he,

421
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,640
he didn't stick with standup.

422
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,630
See, I don't think he's a
great actor. I, you know, and,

423
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,190
and I have the utmost respect for him
and I do think he probably affected me as

424
00:25:40,191 --> 00:25:42,320
much as any other comic.
When I first started out,

425
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:45,740
I saw him live and memorized all
his albums, but I don't know,

426
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:48,200
I always found is acting to
be a little self conscious,

427
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,190
little stiff when I've seen him in some
really good things I'd have to go over

428
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:54,830
is I am db to figure out
what the fuck they were.

429
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,350
But nothing was just, we both agree to
that nothing is good as the stem. No Way.

430
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,150
It was so good. Yeah. He
was great in the gym. Yeah.

431
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,720
It's really good in the truck.

432
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,470
But that was the young Steve Martin
there was still doing standup and he had

433
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:13,530
those, we had those little indie
films he made before that there was a,

434
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,750
there was a dead men don't
wear plaid. Oh yeah. Um,

435
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,960
what was the other one then?
Don't wear plaid watches,

436
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:23,930
I think shot in black and white
and they use clips of old,

437
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:27,650
like filmed the lard detective movies.
I'm like the fifties

438
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,620
Damn Lawrence.

439
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,600
That guy was a fucking wizard
man. Yeah, he really was good.

440
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,500
Who was really good when he was on,
when he was in his prime. It was just,

441
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:43,980
I was a little

442
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,980
kid at the time and my parents were in
a comedy albums like my parents had the

443
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,410
Cosby I think is, is it
himself? Bill Cosby himself.

444
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:58,540
That was a big record for
him a long time ago. Yeah.

445
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,140
Yeah. Which has first
one was, yeah. Himself.

446
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,020
That was the first one I think so what?
Whatever it was,

447
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,130
it was like a second one was who would
do with the Noah's Ark fell asleep with

448
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,190
bill Cosby. That's a different
one. Nap Time with bill costs.

449
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,380
You, you look tired, Bill Cosby.

450
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,930
Hey,

451
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,820
has there ever been a public figure that
has gone from being the most one of the

452
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:31,960
most loved of all time?
Like Bill Cosby,

453
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:36,880
pre rape accusations was one
of the most jazz guys. Yeah.

454
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:39,220
But Michael Jackson,

455
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,830
it was never definitive. It was always
weird. Yeah. It was always weird.

456
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:49,690
Bill Cosby was like the voice
of like he was moral. Yeah.

457
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,720
He was like this sweet grandpa type
character that didn't want you using bad

458
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:59,560
language. Like how, how crazy.

459
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,760
He was probably a guy. He's
gotten more of those. He,

460
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:06,490
I'm honorary doctorates.
Yeah,

461
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,670
he's the fee I honorary doctorate guy.

462
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,450
He definitely has at least one of those,
cause I know they were,

463
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,120
he was asking people to
refer to him as doctor Cosby.

464
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,340
I always thought he was
just fucking around. Now

465
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,230
[inaudible] his ego is out of control.
I'm,

466
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:23,190
I know this guy that used to do all of
his, uh, his day to day. Yeah. He's like,

467
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,710
he was the assistant to the agent
who had to actually deal with it.

468
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,810
That dude had three full time houses.
One in Colorado, one in New York,

469
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:31,644
one in La.

470
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Each one had a chef and a
maid and a driver all on call.

471
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,070
Like literally on call because he had his
own jet and he would do a Gig in Saint

472
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,080
Louis and none of the three
houses knew which house,

473
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:47,220
who's going to go to that night.

474
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,080
He would just fucking go and
you had to be ready. Whoa. Yeah,

475
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,280
food stocked. How's clean? Ready
to roll. That's pretty bad.

476
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,650
Yeah. I'm not saying that
whatever live like that.

477
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,560
That's a lot of overhead

478
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,690
be a lot of time,
a lot overhead

479
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,010
kind of houses he's living in
to like Jesus Christ. Right.

480
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:13,510
But I bet he made a shit ton of money on
the Cosby show cause that was his show.

481
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:14,150
He owned that.

482
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,640
She owned it and he also owns fat Albert
right member and he don't, you don't,

483
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,580
you can't even find that anymore.
Which I find fat Albert,

484
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,620
where the fuck is fat Albert? You
never hear about that. Anyway,

485
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,500
he, he didn't fight. He bought
the little rascals, didn't he?

486
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,630
Or was that a rumor? Was that snapped? I
think that might fill in those knowing.

487
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,270
It's like you got to look at the guys
touring schedule. He is never let up.

488
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:41,740
He has done 200 nights a year.

489
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,970
Yeah.

490
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,710
Where he's making what
does cause we could for,

491
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:47,650
I mean in his prime he was
good for a hundred grand.

492
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,500
At least a hundred grand a night.
Right. It at least two shows on a week.

493
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:58,210
He would be in Phoenix one night,
Tucson, the next flying to each place.

494
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,500
Oh, you Snopes it right when I was
Snopes in it. Okay. It's false. Bill.

495
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,910
Didn't we cover this before?

496
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:07,880
I feel like we covered this on an earlier
podcast cause I was remembering it.

497
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,610
I was like, man, I feel like
that's been Snoop's did. Okay.

498
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,760
Yeah, it's false. Totally.

499
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,190
Okay.

500
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,720
I was aware.
Are those fucking videos then?

501
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,790
Where are they? Because they're
weird. They're weird. They're weird.

502
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:29,920
They're a really good slice
of a America. Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,510
I mean it was a fucking, these
were like ghetto kids. Yeah. Yeah.

504
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,940
We're the likable black ghetto kids.

505
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,860
So bill Cosby never owned any
part of the little rascals.

506
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,250
It never aren't any part of
the rights to were rascals.

507
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:48,643
Yeah.

508
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:53,510
Where the fuck are those videos?
Then they should release those.

509
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,150
Those things are time capsules.
Like you're,

510
00:30:56,151 --> 00:31:00,110
you're looking into a different
style of human. Right. You know,

511
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:05,100
like my kids got into Popeye recently.
I've no shit buy form. You really?

512
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,010
Yeah. The really old ones from the 30
days. Some of them sponsored by the NRA,

513
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:13,490
by the way. Yes. The beginning of Popeye.

514
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,800
There's a fucking NRA logo.

515
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,160
No National Rifle Association Helps
Sponsor Popeye 1930s that's hilarious.

516
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:26,960
It is a different era. And Mike, we
were watched New Orleans. Jesus Christ.

517
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:30,800
It's so fucking violent.
Like it's all violence.

518
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:34,130
It's all everyone's trying to steal.
Blew those. Always trying to rape.

519
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,240
Blue is always trying to rape olive Oyl
and Popeye has to beat the fuck out of

520
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:41,300
them. This is, this is every day.

521
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,040
Tell me down below.

522
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,030
He's getting fucking hit in the
head with flower pots and shit.

523
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,770
[inaudible] sailors. Yeah. Is
the sailor world. Yeah, man.

524
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,970
Rapey I've watched in olive
oil getting raped. Holly Shit.

525
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,810
Well she's like rope. It's weird. Like
you can't hold onto her. She's like,

526
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,700
she moves like a snake. Like she
doesn't have any articulating joints.

527
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,380
Everything just moves. It's like
that style of cartoon was so weird.

528
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,310
You know, everybody's arms were like
ropes, like especially olive oil.

529
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,850
There was no like joint,
it wasn't like they bent at the knee.

530
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:20,600
Nothing moved all over the place.
Yeah, she was super anorexic.

531
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,130
Yeah.

532
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,010
The ogling of olive oil.
What do you uh, what do this,

533
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,890
that I don't think that's
the original either.

534
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,130
That seems like much more a recent stuff.

535
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,820
The really old stuff is the black
and white stuff and that's a,

536
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,540
a lot of the stuff that I've been
watching, it's real weird because um,

537
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,950
the way they too

538
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,053
is like,

539
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:46,090
it's real hand animated so like it's
not very smooth and they bounce back and

540
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:50,330
forth. Like while they don't
just stand there and talk,

541
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:51,920
they have like a little
dance that they do.

542
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,690
They lean back and forth and back and
forth and back and forth to create a sense

543
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:59,870
of movement. I don't know why they're
doing it, but it's interesting to watch.

544
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,160
It's like it's such a unique and specific
style of cartooning and you realize

545
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:04,340
like,

546
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,900
well this is the original style films
and only been around for a few decades

547
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:12,030
when they are doing this. Like
this is really, really, really,

548
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,440
yeah. The early Disney stuff, it looks
like they took a a a notebook here.

549
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:19,770
When you write the pictures on each
page, that's what it looked like. Yeah.

550
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,510
That's probably why he
was bouncing around.

551
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,830
Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Yeah. I mean it
was just much less specific. I mean,

552
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:28,250
I don't even know how many people they
had working on those things, but how long

553
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,120
must've taken to make one of
those cartoons, man. Fuck that.

554
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,250
The cells are worth a lot of money.
Oh,

555
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,310
first cells of Disney
probably worth millions.

556
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,080
Probably millions, right?
Yeah. I got a Simpson Sal.

557
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:45,380
They're not that hard to get
really go Simpson. So yeah,

558
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,070
it will because every episode is
made up a fucking thousands of cells.

559
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:54,020
So they sell all of them. I, Sam Simon
gave me one. Oh Wow. That's cool.

560
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,860
Somebody gave me a self in the American
Werewolf in London. Yeah. Yeah. Oh,

561
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,540
that's cool. That's pretty dope.
Just to have a piece of that.

562
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,450
My son is, uh, he's getting
into, he wants my list of movie,

563
00:34:06,451 --> 00:34:10,300
so we watched Scarface together two
nights ago. Really? That was bad ass.

564
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,570
Cause I watched that fucking movie every
Friday night for probably a year and a

565
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,230
half. Me and my buddies
would get together, get high,

566
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,270
drink beer and watch
Scarface and just recite it.

567
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,240
What was that episode of
the, um, Larry David's show?

568
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,570
Curb your enthusiasm or he had a
rapper that he was hanging around with,

569
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:34,060
had a wonky eye. What was the evil
eye? The guy was crazy. I killed her.

570
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:37,840
That's it. And that's all he
did is he watched Scarface,

571
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,380
his car face playing
above his bed, 24, seven.

572
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,710
It's huge. And the rap world, you know,

573
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,630
Scarface is it, what's a bad guy? Was
the winner. He was the hero. All right.

574
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,080
What other movie ever has there been?

575
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:56,081
We're a coke smuggling immigrant who was
a prisoner in Cuba and murderer is the

576
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:00,284
hero of the movie.

577
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,830
Well the Godfather, but that was, uh, you
know, and that's the same thing. I mean,

578
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:09,070
these, these rappers are into the
Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface,

579
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,840
anything gang related. And these are
all the movies and my son wants to see,

580
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,040
because he listens to this hardcore rap.
Like what the fuck?

581
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,720
And I don't want to be the guy who goes
that music, you know? I was just like,

582
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:23,610
all right.
I guess that's what he's listening to.

583
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,910
Nothing I can do about it is the young
white point. He wants to be legit.

584
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:30,870
What are you gonna do? Right?
Rough. It's rough faction man.

585
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,320
Out of his friends are black. None of his
friends now, a lot of his friends are,

586
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:39,180
a lot of his friends are, and it's, his
first girlfriend was black. Oh Shit. Yeah.

587
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:43,210
Oh, so she was cute. Is um,

588
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,920
does your kid want to be a rapper?

589
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:49,380
Like a Tom Hanks' son that
wants to be a rapper? Tom Hanks.

590
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,480
He shows the pistols in his
Instagram. Yeah. It's like, dude,

591
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,380
your dad's Forrest Gump.
Okay. Just shut the fuck up.

592
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:04,960
Don't tell me about the hard life in Bel
Air that you led. Shh. No, you can't.

593
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,050
There's certain shit you can,

594
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,160
you can't be a gangster rapper
when you're Tom Hanks is son. Yeah.

595
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,660
And trying to prove yourself a gangster
rapper. You're gonna wind up in jail.

596
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,160
You better be careful.
Yeah.

597
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,910
He better not try because it's going to
overcompensate. Exactly. Well, what are,

598
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,230
what are will Smith's kids
like? I mean they wrap, right?

599
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Well this in one of his kids like believe
that the world is an illusion or some

600
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:31,630
shit like he sounds about right.

601
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,040
He says ridiculous shit on his Twitter
page that people like a retweet all the

602
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:40,390
time and go l o l w u t and shit,
that kind of shit.

603
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,160
Right Jayden?

604
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:47,161
He just deleted his Twitter yesterday
though because people being mean to him

605
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,980
and the kids got, he's got a creative
imagination and I'm out apparently, um,

606
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,210
you know, from talking to people that
like worked with will Smith and they said,

607
00:36:55,211 --> 00:36:58,960
that guy's a genius. Said he just reads
constantly. It's like stacks of books.

608
00:36:58,961 --> 00:37:01,070
He flies around with everywhere he goes.

609
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:03,760
It's constantly reading is
the consummate gentlemen.

610
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:08,080
Like I never heard a bad word about that
guy. Now. Super, super, Super Nice Guy.

611
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:11,500
Apparently this one dude,
I know Johnny Mack,

612
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,980
he's this real fucking gangster.
He was in jail for a bunch of years,

613
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:16,840
but he's a writer.
He writes on,

614
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:21,760
he wrote on Martin and he wrote
on fresh prince and he said that,

615
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:25,390
uh, they hired him because they wanted
fresh prince to have a little bit more

616
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:26,860
legitimacy in the black world.

617
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:31,390
So they hired he just fucking gangster
to write on the show Johnny back.

618
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,930
And so he comes in and, uh,
I, I forget what happened,

619
00:37:34,931 --> 00:37:38,200
but like a will Smith,
Kate kept shitting on him cause he was,

620
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,190
he was the cool guy and I think he maybe
felt a little threatened by him and uh,

621
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,550
he, he did something and Johnny
Mac just fucking picked him up,

622
00:37:45,551 --> 00:37:49,630
put him against the wall by his neck and
scare the shit out of him and he never

623
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:53,560
said anything to him again.
Wow. Is that true though?

624
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,360
According to Johnny Mac. Hmm.
Who's Johnny? My character.

625
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,260
Great Dude. Love Johnny
Mac. Funniest Shit.

626
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,270
He's one of these guys that like,

627
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:09,010
he's part of Jamie Foxx is crew and like
always has on like $300 sneakers that

628
00:38:09,011 --> 00:38:12,310
he got at one of these Tete de yeah.
We're celebrities. Go to the tent.

629
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,450
Reagan's Free Shit. This guy tents
are glorious. Yeah, they're great.

630
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,020
Okay.

631
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,140
But Johnny works.
Yeah.

632
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,020
Dues will go and stack up those tents.
Oh yeah.

633
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,900
Sometimes they give away watches and shit.
Oh fuck yeah.

634
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,710
Watches trips there.
Those things are weird.

635
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,000
The representatives are all like
super smiling. [inaudible] super

636
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,870
gray shading if you don't
know what we're talking about.

637
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,950
There's these things they do at like
award show sometimes especially, well,

638
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:45,820
they'll have like a tent and all
the celebrity before the award show.

639
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,260
Do they do it the day before?
Well, it depends. Some at
the award show itself, they,

640
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,310
I think they give out baskets,
but um,

641
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:57,330
I know that Nike has a giant tent and
Marina del Rey and it's always the day

642
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,401
before the award show.

643
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:02,210
You come in and you walk in and you
pick out the base shoe that you want,

644
00:39:02,211 --> 00:39:04,810
we'll call his stripes with color laces.

645
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:08,080
And he had a whole place that you could
go to. Well, I guess it was like that,

646
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:09,460
but it was free.
Yeah.

647
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,950
They had a whole place you'd go to that
there would send celebrities there.

648
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,410
This like some talking about, but they
had, that was 24 seven Oh, is that right?

649
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,110
A year round. 24 seven. But
you know, they had hours,

650
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:23,140
but this lady Tracy's to work there,
she was so nice.

651
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,470
She gave me free sneakers for
like most of my time on TV.

652
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,860
All Nike give you free Nike's just show
up. Yeah, they would send them to you.

653
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:32,200
They send you like the latest styles,
you know,

654
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,940
they just want you to be
wearing shit like that.

655
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,940
There was this company up in San
Francisco called upper playground.

656
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,160
You ever heard of them?
No. It's real, real cool.

657
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:42,030
Like I'm Kinda like a Keith Haring,

658
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,960
a graffiti art type of stuff and a little
bit hip hop, but not really, you know,

659
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,760
not oversize and all that.

660
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,910
But they used to outfit a bunch
of the comics and it was great.

661
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:53,620
I'd go on best week ever with a Fucking,

662
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:58,621
you pee on my chest and that would just
get boxes of sweatshirts and shirts and

663
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:00,610
hats. It was crazy. Well,

664
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:04,840
you remember when like von Dutch became
popular because Ashton Kutcher used to

665
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:07,270
wear those hats? Yeah.
Yeah. It was ridiculous.

666
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,650
Like the von Dutch thing was
like a collective hypnosis.

667
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:15,190
Like everybody got hypnotized by like
one of the dumbest looks possible.

668
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,480
A big goofy trucker hat
with the words von Dutch on.

669
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:24,160
It didn't make any sense. Yeah.
But it became super desirable.

670
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,450
Why do you think it did? Maybe because
Avastin Kosher. Yeah. Beautiful Man.

671
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,270
Perfect bone structure. Yes.
They wanted to be like him.

672
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:35,760
Maybe it looked cool on him and his
ironic fashion style of, you know,

673
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,230
having this hat on sideways.
Like he doesn't give a fuck.

674
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,240
He's wearing a trucker hat.
He's not even trying,

675
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,150
he's not wearing the perfect fitted
ball cap and a sequence around the,

676
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,020
the ridge of the brand. No, he's
wearing like a goofy little habit.

677
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:52,630
Shaggy on purpose. Yup. Yup. He
nailed it. Boy Did that guy nail it.

678
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,200
He's good looking enough
that he could look like shit.

679
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,820
Right and still be amazing. Yep. Yep.

680
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:03,550
Trucker hat was like a way
of showing that, you know,

681
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,160
like he didn't give a fuck.
I'll just put this on.

682
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,760
So how worried I am about my looks right.

683
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:12,280
And in wearing that trucker hat would
that von dumps logo like you look good.

684
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:14,560
And so then all of a sudden
these monkeys started buying it.

685
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,650
Monkey see monkey do and everybody's
wearing these God damn shirts.

686
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:21,310
And it was weird and it
lasted for a wild man last.

687
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,290
It was like a frenzy for like a year
or a year and a half or so. Bless you.

688
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,520
Thank you.

689
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,810
And also credit spun out into a whole
style where guys would wear boots,

690
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:34,220
like military kind of
are construction boots

691
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,690
that were already,
you'd buy him,

692
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:40,691
you be up and genes that were beat
up and you know a gas station shirts.

693
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,550
Well that's a big thing with women's
buying pants that are just ripped a shit.

694
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,490
Yeah. Like already. Like
the moment you buy them,

695
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,580
the moment you buy them
at the store or get them,

696
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,560
a lot of people buy things online now.
They don't even go to stores. Yeah,

697
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:00,590
but they're already torn apart. Like
there's holes all over them. Right.

698
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,990
What is that?
What the fuck is that?

699
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,530
Abraham Lincoln? Well it's like a vintage,
like I like vintage concert tee shirts.

700
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:12,110
Yes.
Because I like the bands,

701
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:17,470
but otherwise weathered clothing
that's perf purposefully weathered.

702
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,000
It just feels to me like,
all right, you're spoiled.

703
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,120
You don't work with your hands and you're
trying to make up for it by wearing

704
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:26,510
some work shit. Yeah.
It's weird that it's site.

705
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,890
Let me feel your hands for a second.

706
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:31,160
I want to see if you've got any
fucking callouses on your hand. See.

707
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,580
But on the other hand,
like with a girl,

708
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:39,970
I like it because I like seeing like
the legs poking out all over the,

709
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:44,090
over the pants, you know, it's this big
gaps in it. You see all the skin. Yeah.

710
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:45,920
It's exciting. It's like, Ooh,

711
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,580
look at her legs are right there
underneath all this craziness. Yeah.

712
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,420
He'll let you can see your skin at a bunch
of different areas. Like the same way.

713
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:57,770
I like seeing women in dresses or
skirts, like women in skirts. It's hot.

714
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,930
So basically just the less clothes I just
like, like that's the theme. Jack legs.

715
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,630
Yeah. Girls like reg,
muscular, athletic legs.

716
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,000
I play and then I was telling you
I did this wrong. Right James?

717
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,680
Jamie's getting a hard look at them.
Get the camera and yeah.

718
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,530
Uh,
oh,

719
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,880
I did this. Uh, I told you this charity,

720
00:43:16,881 --> 00:43:20,240
it was a golf tournament yesterday and
I was playing golf with this chick.

721
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:23,240
Her name was Amy Garcia.
And you, you might know her.

722
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:27,740
She was in the George Lopez show and
Dexter and now she's the lead in this

723
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:30,320
Rushmore, uh, show that's coming out.

724
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,820
So she was in my foursome and a man.
She has great legs.

725
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,890
Holy Shit.
All Day long.

726
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:41,470
She's just like 10 feet in front of me
standing over that ball caught damp.

727
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,130
Hey edition that you have to get into
the pot and over a little bit. Yeah.

728
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,450
You got to pick up that ball and
pick up that ball anyway. Cool.

729
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:54,350
More God and coolest Shit like one of
those girls that that's like one of the

730
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:58,370
guys. That was it. And there was a lot
about sports. Yeah. It's always nice.

731
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:02,150
We could find that. Good luck. Amy, what's
the new shell? I hope Rushmore's ahead.

732
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,590
So we see more solutions on your legs.
Great legs.

733
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,230
Craig Simmons is very happy
with your legs, Puerto Rican.

734
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,260
But a dude wearing pants like that.
You want to smack them right in the mouth.

735
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,540
Pants with holes all over
your fucking pants, right?

736
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,790
Why do you get those crazy holes all
over your pants? What are you doing?

737
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,540
You did it on purpose. You bought those
like all the, what do you, what do you,

738
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:27,380
Bon Jovi. Yeah. Are you
bunching? Not Bon Jovi. Right.

739
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,670
And why are you wearing this fucker pants.

740
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,213
Okay.

741
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,810
A brown dude.
You went to one of those concerts once.

742
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,360
Oh, I was, I remember you
telling him I was working alone.

743
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,620
I was working at Great Woods
Center for the performing arts,

744
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:51,070
and I walked into the arena as
I was walking into the arena,

745
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,900
he did that shot through the heart.
That's how they open up the concert.

746
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,380
You never heard anything
like in your life.

747
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,160
The whale of ecstasy at those women
screamed out and a lot of men,

748
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:06,290
a lot of men will to share. They did.
It was just, no, but I'll tell you what.

749
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,460
I was like, it was a
transformative moment. Yeah,

750
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:14,840
I remember that because I remember
thinking very clearly like, wow,

751
00:45:14,841 --> 00:45:18,080
what a wild thing these guys have done.

752
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:23,350
Like they've made a bunch of sounds and
they put it together in a way that like

753
00:45:23,361 --> 00:45:28,361
rhymes and as this rhythm to it and then
they release it and as such an impact

754
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:33,260
on the people that hear it,
that they just played this in this,

755
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,210
this giant arena, great
woods. I don't know what,

756
00:45:35,211 --> 00:45:39,560
it seemed like more than 10,000 people.
I don't think it's a big fucking place.

757
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,550
And the place erupted.
It was just this raw,

758
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:46,100
he could hear it out in the parking lot
and I was walking in with these other

759
00:45:46,101 --> 00:45:50,320
security guys and we're like,
Whoa, Holy Shit. Like people went

760
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:54,380
nuts became a body.
They became beyond themselves.

761
00:45:54,381 --> 00:45:58,130
You become a part of the energy. I mean,
that's a great thing about, first of all,

762
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:01,970
I fucking love music and I'm
so moved by certain music.

763
00:46:01,971 --> 00:46:05,450
Like if I go to a Bruce Springsteen
concert and he starts singing a song,

764
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:09,560
it's meaningful to me and I know that
the other 50,000 people are feeling the

765
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:13,640
same thing. Yeah. That's an incredible
feeling. It's just really transcendent.

766
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:14,431
It is.

767
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:19,431
And it's like any other sort of
performing art that you're witnessing.

768
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,370
If you're witnessing someone who's
really nailing it with a bunch of other

769
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:25,680
people,
it makes it better for some reason.

770
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,380
If you're watching a guy play a guitar
solo and he's just nailing it. Yeah.

771
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,710
And then like you like God damn.

772
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:35,790
Like if you were there when Hendrix
was at the Roxy and you know,

773
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:38,560
1960 whatever, yeah. You would, you would,

774
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,600
you would be with a bunch of people
that were watching something special and

775
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:45,560
it's somehow or another better
than watching it by herself.

776
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,830
Well, it's almost like if it's a band
you really know. It's almost like,

777
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,730
I'm like just now when I sit Bruce
Springsteen, I was like, Huh.

778
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,140
I wonder if Joe Likes Bruce Springs
because some people fucking hate them and

779
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:55,974
just get that

780
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,380
you can, you can't, you can't deny
that. Some of his fucking album,

781
00:47:00,381 --> 00:47:05,350
some of his songs, younger lands as the
greatest song of all time. It's dude,

782
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,120
he had a bunch of fantastic songs.
Yeah.

783
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:12,770
Brilliant disguise when he had married
that really hot chick and it didn't work

784
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:17,330
out. Oh yeah. And he, he put out
that brilliant to sky song. Jesus.

785
00:47:17,331 --> 00:47:22,130
That's a fucking sorrow full
song. I mean, that's a real song,

786
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,820
man. That's that that guy was the,
and still is a bad motherfucker.

787
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:29,440
But what about after after nine
11 he wrote the rising. Yeah.

788
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,330
And they remember they played it with the,
uh,

789
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,160
they had a choir sing it in front
of the White House on I think was an

790
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:39,610
inauguration day.
Jesus Christ.

791
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:43,120
That was powerful.
I might've cried.

792
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,960
Yeah, he's a bad motherfucker. I mean,
he had a bunch of stuff that was just,

793
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,100
you know, like a Anthony Cuneo
would always mock it. You know,

794
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,530
the whole garage.

795
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,680
I'm a blue collar guy down to earth making
ends meet me while he's like a multi

796
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:01,840
multimillionaire. But that was the
type of shit that he's saying. Right.

797
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,010
But if you get past that,
like some of his stuff,

798
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,490
well Dylan was, you know, he's always sang
for the working man. Yes. He's got money.

799
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:14,350
I think it's folk music.

800
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,360
Dylan did it in a way that,
you know,

801
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,140
okay.

802
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,930
It was, I don't know, it was a little
flatter or something like that,

803
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,420
but it was more emotion or the

804
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,970
right, I think it was
more of a nod to, um,

805
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:29,740
felt music like old Hobo
kind of music. Right. And uh,

806
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:34,360
were as Springsteen I think was
more of like a, um, you know,

807
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:38,740
arena rock. He was, he was looking for the
big ballot, the big operatic song, like,

808
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:44,130
like Rosalita thunder road that
you can sing in a fucking wall,

809
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:48,970
you know, the, in a giant stadium and blow
the place out. Wow. About the river man.

810
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,930
Yeah.

811
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,400
And that came out. I was in high
school when that came out. I was,

812
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,610
it was my first year in high
school in [inaudible] 81.

813
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,320
And I remember that
song came out in there,

814
00:48:56,321 --> 00:49:00,220
but it was like everybody's
jaws dropped. Right? Oh my God.

815
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,990
I got married, pregnant and man,
that was all she wrote. Dude.

816
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:05,550
It was for my 19th birthday.

817
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:09,900
I got a union card and a wedding coat.
Yeah,

818
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,790
great line.
Yeah.

819
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,660
Yeah. And this, this is,

820
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:19,870
there was this message from a lot of
his songs and that message was this

821
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,960
confusion and anx that you're having in
your youth literally might be the freest

822
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:29,510
you ever are for the rest of your life.
And from here on out,

823
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:34,570
it's just this horrible struggle to try
to stay sane and try to avoid your vices

824
00:49:35,121 --> 00:49:38,960
and keep your job and keep away
from the heroin and the boots

825
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:41,480
oohs and all the romance
in your relationship.

826
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,840
And almost no one was doing it in his
songs as long as we're all paying. Yeah.

827
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:50,550
That is so true. What you just said,
it's about this moment right now. Yeah.

828
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,250
It always is. It's about, um,

829
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,200
you know that tonight, let's
live for tonight. You know,

830
00:49:57,201 --> 00:50:01,970
more than to run live tonight.
I don't, tomorrow's not
going to be good. Yeah. But,

831
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:05,890
uh, um, what was the line? Uh,

832
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,023
okay.

833
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,543
I can't remember.

834
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:16,910
Born in the USA is probably the
most ironically misuse song ever,

835
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:21,750
right? Like how many people have
used that as like a, a pro America,

836
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,200
Paulo tissue, Republican
politicians. Yeah.

837
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,430
I mean, just, just him singing overpowers

838
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,570
the actual content of the song,
which is very anti war,

839
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,520
which he was. Yup. No,

840
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:40,190
it's about a guy's life falling apart
because of the war and the door was a

841
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:44,240
mistake. Yeah. There's
so many good songs, man.

842
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:47,540
Anybody that doesn't think I'm
looking at his shit. Human touch,

843
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:51,110
tunnel of love streets of
Philadelphia. How, yeah.

844
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,860
God Damn Thunder road. Ooh, fucking song.

845
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,970
Yeah. Jesus. And you go back to
darkness on the edge of town,

846
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:01,630
which was a really dark oh biblical album.
And you know,

847
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:05,820
all of Adam raised a cane and
all of this like, you know, um,

848
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,870
just,
just really about

849
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,270
your relationship to your dad.
A lot of it is,

850
00:51:12,271 --> 00:51:15,150
and you know that whether or not you're
going to take over your dad's life,

851
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:16,230
you're going to lead your own life.

852
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,490
The dancing in the dark held them back.
That's what fucked everybody up.

853
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,420
And he got a little poppy. He got a
little silly. Yup. Got a little silly,

854
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:27,750
started dancing and shit. And everybody
went, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.

855
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:31,500
Where's the fucking river, Bro? Where's
the river? We're going down to the river.

856
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,680
He committed suicide.
Are we dancing in the dark?

857
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:39,010
Right? It's like Billy Joel when he did
uptown girl. Oh, that was the worst.

858
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:40,000
Same thing though,
right?

859
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,350
Well, I think Billy Joel went through a
real hard period when it started getting

860
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:46,860
together with Christie Brinkley because
a man like that is not supposed to fuck

861
00:51:46,861 --> 00:51:48,780
a woman like that in nature.
Okay.

862
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,900
And what happens is when you're fucking
a girl who's just an undeniable 10 and

863
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:58,800
you're this, this very amazingly
talented singer and piano player,

864
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:03,030
but you know that in the wild,
that woman is not going to take you.

865
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:07,140
She's going to be with some viking
or something. Doesn't make any sense.

866
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:12,120
She's this giant supermodel and she's
just stunning and perfect in every way.

867
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,270
And he became a bitch
for a little bit town.

868
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:21,300
She's been living in town. Well, gotta
give the guy some credit though. I mean,

869
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,340
first of all,
as a musician,

870
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:26,850
he's amazing that the songs
that people don't talk about,

871
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:31,230
like the ballot of Billy the kid,
it's a fucking great song.

872
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,190
That's a great song. Scenes from an
Italian restaurant. Yeah. God Damn

873
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:40,120
Way. You are maybe the most beautiful love
song to sing. It's amazing. Yeah, he was.

874
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,810
He's one of the all time greats.

875
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:45,670
He just fell apart when he got a 10
he will eat pork a little bit picky.

876
00:52:45,671 --> 00:52:47,760
Got Sober.
I think he was really member.

877
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:51,070
You got a couple of a couple
of Duis fucking sobriety.

878
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,930
But you know he's selling out Madison
Square Garden once a month every fucking

879
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:59,050
month. Of course he is. He can do that
anytime he wants for the rest of his life.

880
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,810
He takes his car and from his
house takes them 45 minutes.

881
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,990
Then he goes home that night
after selling out the garden.

882
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,760
He's really fucking Joel. He
deserves it. He earned it.

883
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,000
But is that the way to do it? If you make
it that big and you love what you do,

884
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:11,590
but you don't want to travel on the road,

885
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:16,120
just going to go down the street to the
garden once a month. It's amazing. Yeah.

886
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:19,670
He lives unlike long island on
the, on the, on the ocean. Yeah.

887
00:53:19,671 --> 00:53:24,560
He's in the Hamptons. Yeah. He lives like
right on the ocean. So Desi. Yeah, yeah.

888
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,860
That's his thing, man. Like fixing his
motorcycles, riding motorcycles around.

889
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:33,440
He apparently broke his arm. Really
bad writing is motorcycles. Oh really?

890
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,530
Fucked up. You still can play piano. Still
plays a shit out of piano. But he like,

891
00:53:37,531 --> 00:53:40,740
he's, you know, he rides
motorcycles. He's taking chances.

892
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:41,871
He's a risky file.

893
00:53:41,871 --> 00:53:46,370
They say that like the muscles that you
develop when you play piano or guitar,

894
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,440
like your left fingers
when you play guitar,

895
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:53,890
that you actually build up muscles in
your brain that allow it to be stronger

896
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:56,600
and a probably recovers
better because of that. Whoa.

897
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:00,110
I was just reading that because uh,
you know,

898
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,260
you're talking about there was this,

899
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,870
there was this a op Ed piece
in the Times where they were,

900
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:07,100
this woman was talking about,

901
00:54:07,101 --> 00:54:12,101
she resents Caitlyn Jenner for talking
about how she was always in the wrong

902
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:16,310
body and that she's really a
woman because at the same time,

903
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,550
so that's acknowledging that the male
brain and the female brain are different.

904
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,870
But the same feminists will tell
you a few try to say that, uh,

905
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:25,940
that there are different
in the academic world.

906
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:30,970
You'll get fucking annihilated because
they don't want you to distinguish that

907
00:54:31,431 --> 00:54:35,270
there are any different that they
aren't capable of doing what men can do.

908
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:40,260
And so they try to say, you can't,
if you're a fucking, uh, you're a,

909
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:43,970
you're a pig. If you say that women are
different. But then with Katelyn you go,

910
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,570
oh no, she's got the female
brain. Well, which is it?

911
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:51,730
Well, I don't think there's
saying that they're not different.

912
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,290
I think they're saying that they're,

913
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:58,350
whatever differences they have are not
intellectual than might be differences of

914
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,720
philosophies or sexuality or,
or,

915
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:06,850
but not as far as intellectual capacity.
No, that's the issue. That's right.

916
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,710
That's like the big feminist issues
that the treated equal with intellectual

917
00:55:11,711 --> 00:55:14,600
capacity but not necessarily
equal and behavior still,

918
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,650
right? Yeah, the standards. Yeah. I didn't
say better. I said different. Right.

919
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,160
And that's the point of this article is
that you build up muscles as a female

920
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:23,340
because you're,

921
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:26,300
you're not picked on the sports team
and then you're not paid as much.

922
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,510
Then you have to give birth.

923
00:55:27,511 --> 00:55:29,690
Then you have to be afraid
of being raped all the time.

924
00:55:29,691 --> 00:55:31,220
Which is something we
don't even think about.

925
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:36,530
And so you develop muscles in your brain
that make you not really muscles in

926
00:55:36,531 --> 00:55:36,880
your brain.

927
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,270
So I think the neurons just developed
pathways that make it more effective.

928
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:45,290
And so, um, and so, and men
developed their brains differently.

929
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:50,291
And so it's so to say that Bruce Jenner
who had the benefit of being a lauded a

930
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:56,060
athlete and, uh, you know, multimillion
dollar spokesman and whatever else he did,

931
00:55:56,061 --> 00:56:00,830
he got as a man and that to
now say he's a female is like,

932
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,290
no, because you, you don't have all that,

933
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:08,060
those other pathways that we built up
as a woman. You still have a male brain.

934
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,920
But if a female lived a very male style
of life from the time that she was

935
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:16,630
really young,

936
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:21,700
if she grew up in a house with all
brothers in a rural area where she wasn't

937
00:56:21,701 --> 00:56:25,120
really a allowed to express herself in,
you know,

938
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:28,860
your traditional female way,
and she's living with these, uh,

939
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:33,480
men essentially, uh, and boys and, uh,

940
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:37,450
she develops her own pathways in a very
different way. Right. You know, I mean,

941
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:41,040
she's still a woman and so it's like,

942
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,880
I think like making these
hardcore distinctions.

943
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,620
Like I've heard people say both sides,

944
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:49,690
I've heard them argue the
Bruce Jenner's a hero.

945
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,900
I've heard them argue that this is a
freak show and then America is in such a

946
00:56:56,050 --> 00:57:01,050
rush to be more and more progressive that
we're ignoring the f like some really

947
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:03,820
key facts about him and his situation.
First of all,

948
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,870
that he was crazy enough to marry that
woman and and do that reality show and

949
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,370
have that microscope Donna and
slide and it's really disgraceful.

950
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,780
And two that he wasn't paying attention
recently and plowed into a woman's car

951
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:21,430
with his fucking truck center into
traffic and she died because of it.

952
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:26,431
She was killed directly because of him
hitting her and pushing her into oncoming

953
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:27,634
traffic.

954
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:32,320
A person is not on earth anymore because
of this carelessness and no one is

955
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:36,940
talking about that at all.
I mean, that's a real issue
with people. I mean, yeah, we,

956
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,960
we, we hope that it's not us
that makes a mistake like that.

957
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,640
It's a horrible mistake to make.

958
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,790
But how is that not as
important or how it is?

959
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,440
Like why is this a big
thing about gender only?

960
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:54,070
How about about contrition
for this accident?

961
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:59,071
How about saying like how important it
is to pay attention all the time while

962
00:57:59,171 --> 00:58:03,730
you're driving? I'm so sorry that a
life is not here because of my error.

963
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,090
It is my era and I think it could have
been avoided if I was paying attention

964
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,000
and I didn't plow into this lady.
It could have been avoided.

965
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:14,170
It is possible to avoid that haunts me.
Not, you know what haunts me. I'm a woman.

966
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,780
Well, the other thing he hopes
holidays for is the fact that he,

967
00:58:18,781 --> 00:58:20,540
he put out this message,

968
00:58:20,541 --> 00:58:25,541
this car Dashi and message to all young
women to be a fucking stupid Horesh

969
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,900
money-driven uh, you know, and
then dating outside the race,

970
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:37,520
all the things that they're propagating
and those are going to take,

971
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:42,710
you snuck that in there. Good
is people right now, listen,

972
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,510
I knew Fitzsimmons was one of us.

973
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:47,780
If you took all my quotes like
that and you stacked them together,

974
00:58:47,781 --> 00:58:49,460
I would be so fucked.

975
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:54,450
Oh yeah. You know, fortunately we
don't have to worry about that anymore.

976
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,690
No one cares. No one cares
anymore. No one cares anymore.

977
00:58:57,691 --> 00:59:00,900
And you can have a podcast.
You could explain yourself if you,

978
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:03,930
you've got quoted like that a long time
ago when you didn't have a podcast,

979
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:07,800
you couldn't explain yourself in
context of what exactly was going on,

980
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:09,750
how you're fucking around.
Yeah. That's chicken.

981
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:14,950
Oh yeah. I have guests come out all the
time on my podcast and they're just like,

982
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,290
can you cut out that thing? And I'm
like, man, I usually, I usually will,

983
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:21,710
but I try to talk them out of it.

984
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,470
But they, especially people
that are straight actors,

985
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,190
they get very concerned because they come
out and then they realize they have a

986
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:31,580
publicist and that things can be taken
out of context and they all said and get

987
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:35,630
weird. I had, I had this woman on
from, from transparent, you know,

988
00:59:35,631 --> 00:59:40,280
that show transparent. What does that,
it's the key. It's the transgender shell.

989
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,410
Oh, I think it's on Amazon
prime. Who's The star of it?

990
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,200
Uh,
the guy from Jeffrey Tambor,

991
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,820
who's going to win the Emmy this year
for that incredible. The show is great,

992
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:53,990
but you think of all people,

993
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:58,991
we were talking about transgender issues
and she got a little squirmish to any

994
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:03,970
impropriety and you
don't stick to the line.

995
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,640
Shouldn't even say him and her anymore.
He's supposed to say them and they,

996
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,900
yeah. And you're not
supposed to. Some people,

997
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:16,430
some people prefer her and Bruce
Jenner up to recently preferred him.

998
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,370
Yeah.
Really supposed to call them Katelyn.

999
01:00:19,371 --> 01:00:23,750
Now I find that a hard transition
calling him Caitlyn Jenner. Fuck it.

1000
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:27,470
I don't find it hard, but I want
to hear it out of his mouth. Okay.

1001
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,660
I want you to say,
call me Caitlyn.

1002
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:33,230
Just make a video and I'll
start calling you until then.

1003
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,750
I want bus stop signs.

1004
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:40,430
Call me k like it should be on the front
of a magazine. Yeah, call me Caitlyn.

1005
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,950
Well,
so I don't the fucking picture he took,

1006
01:00:42,951 --> 01:00:44,900
that's another thing people
take issue with is like,

1007
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:48,410
did you have to come out as
a way fee model? He chick.

1008
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:51,620
You couldn't have been just a woman,
like a strong woman.

1009
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,630
You had to be this sort of
submissive model type of,

1010
01:00:55,631 --> 01:00:57,590
that's his fantasy.
By the way,

1011
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:00,710
if you didn't know that was Bruce Jenner,

1012
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:05,600
you were left alone at home and you were
left alone in a cabin for a weekend and

1013
01:01:05,601 --> 01:01:09,410
you just turn to it. Well, unless
I turned to it through Photoshop,

1014
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,410
I probably be able to see immediately
what it really looked like.

1015
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,450
Do you think that she looks anything
like that fucking photograph?

1016
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,100
No. No, no, but I, but I could have beat
off to that photograph and that scares me.

1017
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:26,840
Whatever they did to her face.
That's not healed yet. No,

1018
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,540
she's 65 when you're 65 years old.

1019
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:33,710
Takes a long fucking time for
bone shaving to heal. All right.

1020
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:38,390
They did some sort of a 12 hour feminizing
operation on her face, allegedly.

1021
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:42,410
Then I want to hear her say it
until I write. Call me Caitlyn. She,

1022
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,960
I'm going by the last interview.

1023
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:49,990
The last interview said that he preferred
the he pronoun and he preferred Bruce

1024
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:56,000
Bruce Jenner. He's a woman as he
talked about genital mutilation,

1025
01:01:56,001 --> 01:02:00,860
yet it's not that. It's sexual
reassignment surgery. You
fucking CIS gendered ass.

1026
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:05,120
Fuck. Excuse me, everybody.
We're reassigning you. Shit Lord.

1027
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,720
I knew else. They call it, you
don't call it a vagina anymore.

1028
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:13,160
You call it the front hole.
I think you might be making this up.

1029
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:16,760
I swear to Christ the front hole.
Oh fuck me and my front hole.

1030
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:24,000
If a woman who was his fuck him, you,
him, her vagina, he'd biller. But boy,

1031
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:27,390
the Internal Oregon, my internal
organ, that would be really specific.

1032
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,030
Maybe if you're like dating the biologist,
but aren't,

1033
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,860
isn't every single organ internal? No.
Your skin's an organ. Uh, yeah. Right?

1034
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,600
Yeah. Kid went Rogan. Boom. I think,

1035
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:43,710
uh, yeah. Anything other than
postseason acceptable. Eat my pussy.

1036
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,610
That's what you want to hear. So
perfect. Perfect. And most women love it.

1037
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,350
They love sang pussy. They should.
We love it. They love it. You know,

1038
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,470
he says it cray respect. Natasha
Lazaro. She knows how to say pussy.

1039
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,470
I bet she does with that little
character that she does that little,

1040
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:03,840
she's just adorable. She's hilarious.
She's so talented. She's very, very smart.

1041
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,120
Very smart. Very funny. Very
quick. Yeah. I'm choosing to go.

1042
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:12,210
It's not a huge, how did she not get
here? I mean, not that she won't still,

1043
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:16,020
but she should have been huge already.
You knew it was going to be huge.

1044
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:20,900
Tj Miller. Christina
Palicki. Yes, dude. Yeah.

1045
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:25,350
I saw her fucking destroy the other
night at the comedy store and my jaw was

1046
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:26,940
hanging out with all right.
I said,

1047
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,520
I said like you might be one of the
funniest women that's ever walked the face

1048
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:33,090
of the planet.
No Shit for me on Saturday.

1049
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,190
The set that I saw her,
I'm like,

1050
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:38,340
I'm trying to figure out who
has more poignant points,

1051
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:43,290
who has more like big laughs, who
has more energy on stage. I'm like,

1052
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:45,660
she's right up there with,
with anybody I've ever seen.

1053
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:49,380
Now she's fucking funny as
Shit, Dude. She's really funny.

1054
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,710
I got to watch your whole set again.
Fuck, she's coming down. I'm doing a set.

1055
01:03:52,711 --> 01:03:55,030
I'm doing that thing that we did
at the belly room. It's amazing.

1056
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,990
The comedy store Saturday
at 10 30 come on down.

1057
01:03:57,991 --> 01:04:01,830
I think I asked for her to open for me.
I'm not sure if that's confirmed,

1058
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:05,220
but she may be doing it, but I'll
be doing an hour new material. Uh,

1059
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:09,450
go to my website, click on comedy
store and uh, come fill it up. Yeah.

1060
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:14,400
That is the 11th or the 13th that
is the Saturday night. 13th right?

1061
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:18,510
Yeah. You're going to love it,
dude. We got, we did it together.

1062
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,940
I opened for you that. That's
right. Yeah. It's great.

1063
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,340
You're going to love doing it on your own.
Reach out and touch everybody.

1064
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:27,840
It's amazing. 90 seats. Can I share
with my other dates? Fuck yeah.

1065
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,840
Cleveland. I'm common baby. Jesus.

1066
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:34,890
Hilarity is June 18th through 20 how
great is that club? It's great glove.

1067
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,460
Fuck a doctor, grandson,
grand rapids, Michigan.

1068
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:43,410
June 25 through 27 and then I
got dates come up in Houston,

1069
01:04:43,411 --> 01:04:47,900
Boston, et cetera. Fits dog.com.
[inaudible] Dot Com was gentlemen also,

1070
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:52,680
I got a TV show. I'm on true TV season
two, how to be a grownup. It's us.

1071
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:55,680
Christina's on it and Tom Thompson,
her and Christina are on it.

1072
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:59,820
And you like giving advice on yeah,
that's a good idea. Yeah, it's just end.

1073
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:00,930
The best thing is is they give,

1074
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:05,700
they'll send you like 20 pages of topics
that they want you to write jokes on

1075
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:06,600
and then comment on.

1076
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:10,440
So it was like the homework that I should
have been doing anyway because it was

1077
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:12,480
all stuff about like how to,

1078
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:15,900
how to deal with babysitters and
shit that you know is my world.

1079
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,250
And so I just wrote a hundred pages

1080
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:21,440
of jokes and did them on the show and
then I went through and picked the,

1081
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:25,690
the ones that might be good for stand up
and I swear to God I got 40 minutes in

1082
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:29,350
new material at a two seasons of
the show this year. That's awesome.

1083
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,380
Sometimes just forcing yourself in
a position where you have to write,

1084
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:36,670
just forcing, forcing it. We need
to do what we used to do. Me,

1085
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:38,770
you and maybe or somebody else,

1086
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:42,160
sit down at a fucking room
and throw out a topic.

1087
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,980
Everybody write on it for 15 minutes.
Talk about,

1088
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:49,300
we wrote whoever has the best shit gets
the other two guys shit that we used to

1089
01:05:49,301 --> 01:05:53,210
do that. When did we do that? Did
that with Katar? With Tom Connor.

1090
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:55,670
Oh yeah.
God Damn Dude.

1091
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,690
Back in the day we were focused
while we were desperado too.

1092
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:04,250
We're trying to figure out how
to crack the system. Yup. Yeah.

1093
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,930
How do you right now, what do you
do? The majority of you were writing?

1094
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:11,560
I throw a lot of notes in my iPhone
and then I'll tweet. I'm not,

1095
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:15,340
I have no issue with tweeting and then
taking the tweet and turning it into a

1096
01:06:15,341 --> 01:06:19,270
joke. Did I do on stage? I think it's
almost like a good reminder of premises.

1097
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,800
Yeah. I don't have a problem with it
either. People have problem with it.

1098
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,270
They're just looking for
something to have a problem.

1099
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,470
Yeah. They're like, I don't want my
audience to see the same thing twice.

1100
01:06:27,471 --> 01:06:30,350
It's like they're going to see my shit
about five or six times because I'm going

1101
01:06:30,351 --> 01:06:32,310
to do on how to be a
grown up after I tweet it.

1102
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:36,580
The worst is when someone
who is a in the audience,

1103
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:39,700
we'll tweet to you like you talked
about that already on Twitter.

1104
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,060
It's on and 40 characters.
It was a five minute bid on it.

1105
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:47,500
You fuckhead Jesus Christ. Right? Right.
Yeah. That's where the premise came from.

1106
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:49,570
I thought of it. Then I've
wrote it down. I said,

1107
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:52,810
this would be a funny tweet and I said,
no one. I can get a bit out of that.

1108
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,990
People want like it's,
it's really interesting.

1109
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:58,000
Most people appreciate
the creative process,

1110
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:03,120
but there's some people that just want
this constant stream of what they want.

1111
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:04,723
All right,

1112
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,790
and then if it's not good, they
shit on you for that. It's like,

1113
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:08,481
what do you want me to do?

1114
01:07:08,481 --> 01:07:11,570
Stay of 24 hours a day to come up with
tweets that are different than my stand

1115
01:07:11,571 --> 01:07:14,390
up. You know who is
interesting? Woody Allen,

1116
01:07:14,391 --> 01:07:17,720
who first it started off as a standup,

1117
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:22,340
amazing albums. Then he started
writing books like without feathers.

1118
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:24,920
Remember those? They were
like funny short stories. No,

1119
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,910
I wasn't aware of this great book called
without feathers. It's re you will,

1120
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:31,250
it's one of the few books
you will laugh out loud,

1121
01:07:31,251 --> 01:07:35,510
like confederacy of dunces kind of funny.
And then he starts making movies.

1122
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:38,750
But if you go back and you look
at the stories in his standup,

1123
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,590
he also wrote about them and his books
and then they became plot lines in his

1124
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:45,740
movies. That's kind of fascinating
to me to watch that progression.

1125
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:50,710
It is, it's, I, I love
watching the progression of
bits. When I see a guy like,

1126
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:50,971
you know,

1127
01:07:50,971 --> 01:07:55,000
like you come down to the store and you
have some new piece on something you're

1128
01:07:55,001 --> 01:08:00,001
doing and then I'll see it two weeks
later and it's got all this new shit on it

1129
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,590
and I'd love that. Yeah,
I'll see it a month later.

1130
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:07,620
And it's got this rhythm to it now it's
from Japan and that's still the weird

1131
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:12,070
thing about these bits that
when a person finally sees it,

1132
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:16,010
like if you do a Netflix
special and they see this

1133
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,800
chunk that you've been working on
for the past six, seven months,

1134
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,760
that thing sometimes is even remotely
similar to what it started out as.

1135
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,110
The more fun.

1136
01:08:27,111 --> 01:08:31,940
They move and they shift and you push
them together and it's w I love watching

1137
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,100
that process. Some people don't
want to see it. Some people,

1138
01:08:34,101 --> 01:08:37,790
they just want a constant
stream of absolutely new stuff.

1139
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:43,040
The problem with that is I
agree that the more new stuff,

1140
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:46,640
the better. I try to write as
much new stuff as possible,

1141
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:51,700
but bits only get better if you keep
doing them right and to get them to that

1142
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:56,390
Samurai sword, razor sharpness,
hammering that steel,

1143
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:00,560
they have to be done a bunch of times. You
have to, you can't just write them out.

1144
01:09:00,561 --> 01:09:02,600
You have to perform them
in front of the crowd.

1145
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:05,030
You have to figure out what's wrong
with your performance, what's right.

1146
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,530
I the sat and he got to listen to
your tape sats. I, and I'm, I'm,

1147
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:11,580
I've been fanatical about
that for 25 years. I does.

1148
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,180
I think I've listened to probably 20% of
every, of all the sets I've ever done.

1149
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,130
That's very good.
I'm not that high,

1150
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,100
but I have all of them.
Every set that I do,

1151
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:23,770
I tape and I make notes afterwards.

1152
01:09:23,771 --> 01:09:26,230
One of the things I started doing
is right after I get off stage,

1153
01:09:26,231 --> 01:09:30,610
I sit down with a pad and important things
that I remember about that set. Like,

1154
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,990
oh, there was a hiccup in the transition
from this to that. There was a,

1155
01:09:34,991 --> 01:09:36,310
there's a better way to do this.

1156
01:09:36,311 --> 01:09:38,590
I gotta figure out how to
tie these together and all,

1157
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,170
there's a crazy tagline after that
that I came up with on the fly

1158
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,130
or like this bit there's more,

1159
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,670
there's more like you feel like you can
stretch it out more and you got it and

1160
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:49,900
you don't always remember to keep writing
on it and that it's like you say if

1161
01:09:49,901 --> 01:09:54,140
you don't, part of it for me is like I
got to go on stage in the right head.

1162
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:58,220
I have to like fucking take a shower,
I'm going to work, like show up.

1163
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,530
Having looked at my notes and you know,

1164
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:03,740
not get too fucking caught up and
talking to people before I go on,

1165
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:08,120
I want to go on and really like be there
and then I could fuck around after the

1166
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:08,740
show.

1167
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:08,951
Yeah.

1168
01:10:08,951 --> 01:10:13,360
You want to be in the zone that each one
of those bits requires and they're all

1169
01:10:13,361 --> 01:10:14,194
different.

1170
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,330
And that's one of the things about like
knowing where to put a bid in your act.

1171
01:10:18,331 --> 01:10:19,540
You go to like,

1172
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:24,310
I have like these areas in my act when
I think of is like hills and valleys

1173
01:10:24,311 --> 01:10:27,730
where this is like,
this is like slow contemplation,

1174
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:31,210
thinking about how weird something is.
And then there's the big hills,

1175
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:34,930
like we're going to go on sprint and a
sprint and then we're gonna come back

1176
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,510
after this. And you've got to figure
out where to put these things,

1177
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,830
where they all belong and you've
got to move them around. So fun man.

1178
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,600
And that's where it's really like a
jigsaw puzzle is because you're trying to

1179
01:10:46,601 --> 01:10:47,201
take the bit,

1180
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:50,740
you're trying to create those hills and
valleys and then you're trying to take

1181
01:10:50,741 --> 01:10:53,830
the material that's related and
keep it all in the same area.

1182
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:59,020
And then you're also taking, you want to
mix new stuff with old stuff and then,

1183
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,670
and then it's like,
you know,

1184
01:11:00,671 --> 01:11:03,610
at a certain point you go to do a
special and you're like, all right, I,

1185
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,320
I got a lock down on this shit.

1186
01:11:05,321 --> 01:11:08,650
I can't keep moving it around because
then you got to nail down the transitions.

1187
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,670
Yeah. Yeah. Everybody seems to uh,

1188
01:11:11,671 --> 01:11:16,610
agree that there's somewhere
between a year and two years. It's,

1189
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:19,500
that's the,
the far ranging guys say two years.

1190
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:23,460
The guys who really like to turn things
over on a regular basis, say a year,

1191
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:26,940
but after a year or after two
years, it's done. It's done.

1192
01:11:26,941 --> 01:11:30,240
You can never do it again. You got to
throw it onto a DVD and get it out.

1193
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:34,440
So round somewhere around a year is when
you have to start thinking about it.

1194
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,070
You start saying, you know what,
it's September. Come January,

1195
01:11:38,071 --> 01:11:39,480
I want to record my special.

1196
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,810
So then you have to set up the deal
and then you have to set up the venue.

1197
01:11:42,811 --> 01:11:45,420
And a lot of times things are books seven,

1198
01:11:45,421 --> 01:11:46,980
eight months in advance
anyway when it comes,

1199
01:11:46,981 --> 01:11:49,410
especially if it comes to a theater.
If you wanted to do it at a theater,

1200
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:49,920
you have to do it.

1201
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,180
Wayne advanced a lot of times and then
you start prepping for it and start

1202
01:11:54,181 --> 01:11:58,320
building toward and then it's less a
matter of writing new shit than it is a

1203
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:01,740
matter of like sharpening man.
That stuff as much as possible.

1204
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:06,980
That gets weird for me because
then once I get rid of the special,

1205
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:10,050
like I get rid of all that material,
then I start fresh.

1206
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:15,450
Then sometimes it becomes harder because
I haven't been writing as much as I've

1207
01:12:15,451 --> 01:12:16,830
been sharpening.
You know,

1208
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:19,800
I've just been going over the
same material over and over again,

1209
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:23,100
so I got to Kinda like, I may
might have to revamp that. I might,

1210
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:27,630
I might just start just film a
bunch of sets. Like you know,

1211
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:29,770
I was at the Irvine
Improv this past weekend.

1212
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,300
They have a camera that they have set
up in the back of the room and when they

1213
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:36,420
filmed the thing, it's in the,
on the screen in the green room.

1214
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:39,930
So you're watching it in the green
room and it's like, this is perfect.

1215
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:43,200
Just one camera. Just one camera
like this. This is the actual show.

1216
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:45,120
This is what you'd see if you
were in the audience. Right.

1217
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,270
Like you don't have to do this any
other way. As a matter of fact,

1218
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:50,280
this is the least distracting way.

1219
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:55,320
Like literally put out chunks of you
just on one camera. No crowd shots.

1220
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:56,183
Yes.

1221
01:12:56,310 --> 01:13:01,180
One Cameron my other option
a the of two extremes.

1222
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:05,480
The other option is to buy
a fuck load of Gopros. Yeah.

1223
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:09,030
And strapped into people's
heads. Yeah. And uh,

1224
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,960
what did you ever see a hand
them out to people and they,

1225
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,420
it's like you don't want you to go to
Disneyland and you get on the star wars

1226
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:18,630
ride. They give those goggles.
Everybody will get a Gopro. They'll,

1227
01:13:18,631 --> 01:13:21,810
they'll press record on it.
And then at the end of the night,

1228
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:25,050
you throw your Gopro in the bucket. Yeah.
And we'll have somebody edit that shit.

1229
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,880
But did you ever see David Tell,

1230
01:13:26,881 --> 01:13:30,540
did that show the comedy
underground and he would give out?

1231
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:34,140
I think one it was one go
pro he put into the crowd.

1232
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:38,430
Oh see that mix it together on original
will now because yours is like I want to

1233
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:43,290
do, I want to do like 200
Gopros and uh, give people,

1234
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:45,840
cause I figure it's a bunch of people
are not going to turn them on or if they

1235
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:49,080
fuck it up or someone's going to
get drunk and spill booze on it,

1236
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,150
you're not going to
get every single GoPro.

1237
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:54,770
You could also tell people don't
forget to pan around and show,

1238
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,770
show the people at your table
laughing. Yeah. And that's,

1239
01:13:58,771 --> 01:14:02,160
that would be bad ass gay cause it would
be three d you'd have to have a lot of

1240
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:04,870
security. You have to make sure
that nobody leaves the Gopro to,

1241
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:06,360
somebody would try to steal your GoPro.

1242
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,040
Beastie boys filmed

1243
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,880
a movie like this meant two thousands
they gave 50 fans in the crowd.

1244
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:20,910
Digital Cameras and oh did together from
all their views from different angles.

1245
01:14:21,221 --> 01:14:24,580
And the top of the area was it called?
It's called a awesome,

1246
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:26,650
I shot that or something
very close to that. Awesome.

1247
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:31,540
I fucking shot that fucking shot.
That, oh, what a great idea.

1248
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:35,460
Dammit. I'm like seven years
later. I thought it was just
a couple of years later.

1249
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,900
But what if he streamed it every night?

1250
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,790
What if you had like five cameras
and somebody just did the,

1251
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:46,150
did the cutting and it was a stream of
every set that you do from five point

1252
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:46,984
goes down.

1253
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:50,920
Yeah. Then what's the point in releasing
it as a professional? You don't,

1254
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:51,630
you don't,

1255
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:56,270
it's an ongoing thing. If you want
to see Joe Rogan almost like a,

1256
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:00,990
well I guess with that um, periscope
basically periscope your shows, you

1257
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:03,360
know it seems like a bad idea right now,

1258
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:06,820
but ultimately it's probably going to
seem like a good idea like that maybe as

1259
01:15:06,821 --> 01:15:11,340
well how people are going to release
their specials. Just stream them. Yeah.

1260
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:15,150
When you really stop and think about
it like Kinda everything streaming now,

1261
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,060
you know as long as
it's on demand as well,

1262
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:22,920
you know like some sort of like a Netflix
type deal where it's a live stream and

1263
01:15:22,921 --> 01:15:25,590
then it's available for download
anytime you want afterwards.

1264
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:28,650
Can I periscope a little
bit of this if you must,

1265
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:31,363
if you must.

1266
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:35,280
Well this is my thing about those things
are fun every now and again but they

1267
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,810
really do distract,
right?

1268
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:41,100
They distract the like when when a bunch
of people around you and everyone's

1269
01:15:41,101 --> 01:15:42,360
periscoping,
it's hilarious.

1270
01:15:42,361 --> 01:15:45,810
Like it happens at the comedy store
all the time with periscope each other,

1271
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,830
but at the end of the day it
kind of does distract, you know?

1272
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,450
It's like how many like actual
conversations you're having, how many,

1273
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:57,660
how many sit down,
let's talk about some shit.

1274
01:15:57,661 --> 01:16:02,100
Let's fit once you start periscoping
and instagramming and selfieing and

1275
01:16:02,101 --> 01:16:06,960
tweeting this, tweeting that.
There's a balance in that.

1276
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,120
In the last side of that balance,

1277
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:13,200
he comes a very non intimate
interaction between everyone involved.

1278
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:18,201
I've been around like a bunch of like
really techie people and watch them barely

1279
01:16:18,631 --> 01:16:23,580
communicate with words other than talking
about the things they just tweeted,

1280
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,120
talking about the things that somebody
else tweeted. We should tweet this.

1281
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,080
I should get a picture of that. I want
to Instagram this snap chat is going on.

1282
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:35,820
What exactly. Exactly. They're
talking about new filters we need,

1283
01:16:35,821 --> 01:16:39,210
I got this new APP. It's way better
filters and look what it does look good.

1284
01:16:39,211 --> 01:16:41,130
It does and it's like the,
the,

1285
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:46,260
the tech conversation and the tech
related as far like sending and receiving

1286
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:49,470
shit overwhelms the,
the,

1287
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:53,610
the human interaction overwhelms
it to medium is the message. Yeah,

1288
01:16:53,611 --> 01:16:58,050
and there's a lot of that going on.
There's a lot of that.

1289
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,170
You don't think of it as tech related
because you're talking about some real

1290
01:17:01,171 --> 01:17:05,610
life shit that's happening. Not near you,
but it's going through the phone. Right.

1291
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:09,800
That's the whole deal. It's
like you're it, there's not much

1292
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,410
people to people. Communication. Yeah.

1293
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:15,050
Was like this weird
interface that we're sharing.

1294
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:19,670
Whether we do it solo or we look at
each other's stuff that we do it on or,

1295
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:24,830
well, when you think about language
and the fact that it is, um,

1296
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,290
you know, it's a dumbed down
version of our thoughts.

1297
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:29,030
If you have to put your
thoughts into words,

1298
01:17:29,031 --> 01:17:32,390
you're obviously compromising the scope
of your idea and the fullness of your

1299
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:35,780
idea because it's got to
fit into these words. Right.

1300
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:40,580
Then you go to this second level of
digital communication where now you're

1301
01:17:40,581 --> 01:17:45,581
seeing a dumbing down of the words because
you have to limit what you're doing,

1302
01:17:45,921 --> 01:17:48,800
where you're looking, you're your
presence with the other person.

1303
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:53,990
Everything is then taken to an even
simpler place than it was before,

1304
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,150
so it's completely flat.

1305
01:17:59,150 --> 01:17:59,983
Hmm.

1306
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,440
Human interaction is very bizarre,

1307
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:06,250
but just thinking about what you
do for a living, you're your job.

1308
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:06,980
Yeah.

1309
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,860
Is to elicit a very specific
response out of people.

1310
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:14,570
Right. One of all the
range of emotions. We're,

1311
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:19,580
we're like doctors that are specialists
in this one emotion. One area.

1312
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:20,443
Yeah.

1313
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:24,380
And then creating it as
well as delivering it.

1314
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,990
So creepy with a live.
Yeah.

1315
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:31,910
Sick of it. Sometimes the whole idea
of comedy, I just can like, Ugh,

1316
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:36,110
I don't want to be funny. I don't want
to see anything funny for like six hours.

1317
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,970
Definitely going to take time off. Yeah,
but that's a, that's the balance issue.

1318
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,640
That's like as a,
as a comedian,

1319
01:18:42,641 --> 01:18:46,450
I think it's one of the most important
things is to have some sort of a balance

1320
01:18:46,451 --> 01:18:49,570
in your life. Yeah. You're,
you're into other things as well.

1321
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:51,670
Things that are not even remotely funny.
Right.

1322
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:55,810
That those things are the things that
you eventually get humor from. You know,

1323
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,250
like for me,

1324
01:18:57,251 --> 01:19:01,810
I've always had this lifelong fascination
with wild animals and the wildlife and

1325
01:19:01,811 --> 01:19:04,840
I've gotten a lot of material from the,
the natural world,

1326
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:07,870
but a lot of that stuff,
like when I'm washing those things,

1327
01:19:07,871 --> 01:19:10,780
I'm not even thinking for a second
then I'm getting material out of it.

1328
01:19:10,781 --> 01:19:15,130
I'm watching some documentary on
water buffaloes and lions. Yeah.

1329
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:20,190
Engaged in this Ian's long
conflict for survival and all.

1330
01:19:20,621 --> 01:19:23,770
I'm thinking it was just like, what
a crazy, what a crazy thing this is.

1331
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:25,430
You can capture on film.
Yeah.

1332
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:30,590
That we're so insulated and isolated in
these cities that we can't even imagine

1333
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,360
what the fuck is going on on this guy
had this guy on the other day there was

1334
01:19:34,361 --> 01:19:37,120
telling me about the charter
to channel islands. Yeah.

1335
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:41,800
You're the channel islands is just
that water is overflowing sharks.

1336
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:45,940
No Shit. Yeah. That's the sign off Santa
Barbara. Yeah, it's right out there.

1337
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:51,160
Right out there. Those, those waters
are apparently just filled with sharp.

1338
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:55,720
Wow. They catch them. They
caught the world record.
Maaco shark around this area.

1339
01:19:56,170 --> 01:20:00,130
Um, I think somewhere around, uh, I
want to say like Huntington Beach,

1340
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:01,160
somewhere around that area.

1341
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:04,160
She isn't going to become a close
at our sure that the global warming,

1342
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:05,890
are they those out works

1343
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,210
they see there seems
be more science seemed

1344
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,850
to be the ocean is going to get closer
and closer. It's going to rise. Right.

1345
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,260
And here's my theory,

1346
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,460
right around the time the ocean starts
rising as when we figure out how to take

1347
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:21,930
salt out of the ocean and we just
start socking that bitch dry.

1348
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:26,790
Well, like what are you going to rise
up on us as fast as we can use you. Oh,

1349
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:30,820
good luck with that. Have you ever
seen an almond field, sir? Yeah.

1350
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,960
And then we'll just start sucking water
out of the ocean and the ocean will dry

1351
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:37,650
up and then people in Malibu will get
really pissed because their beach front,

1352
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:42,120
they'll be like looking at this like
100 yards of sand till they get to the

1353
01:20:42,121 --> 01:20:46,350
water. Yeah. There's that. There's that
giant river up in northern California.

1354
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:47,550
They just got dried out.

1355
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:52,551
Completely call like the salt
ocean salt sea or something.

1356
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:55,080
What you're talking about the salt
and sea salt and sea, right? Yeah.

1357
01:20:55,081 --> 01:20:57,920
That's not try it out completely.
It's just still exist. Pretty.

1358
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:02,250
It's pretty far gone on the ocean front.
All his ocean front houses there,

1359
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,390
they're looking at nothing.

1360
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:07,920
Well the salt and season inland sea
that was created by the Colorado River.

1361
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:11,960
The Salton Sea was an accident, right?
It was a, they had opened up the, uh,

1362
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:15,930
there's amazing, I think John Waters
did a documentary on, it was at waters.

1363
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:17,610
I think it was him,

1364
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:21,630
but this is an incredible documentary
on how this all happened and it at one

1365
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:25,890
point in time that was like
where these really rich people,

1366
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,290
Hollywood celebrities.

1367
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:31,980
Sonny Bono was a big fan of the place
when Sonny Bono was a congressman.

1368
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:34,170
Is that what it was? Yes, the
center, no. Congress congress,

1369
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:37,950
when he was a congressman before
he died and that skiing accident,

1370
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:43,100
he was working to desalinate that that
whole ocean area and try to revive the

1371
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:46,890
salt and sea because when he was
younger that place was hopping.

1372
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,920
It was hot and it was like giant
resorts and golf courses and mansions.

1373
01:21:51,931 --> 01:21:55,050
And I think a lot of the water
though was runoff from from crops.

1374
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,440
Agricultural runoff was what poisoned did.
That's what fucked it up.

1375
01:21:58,441 --> 01:22:02,430
Plagues and pleasures on the salt
and Sea John Waters. Yeah, that's it.

1376
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:06,690
That's the one. It's amazing. And you
have to watch cause I had no idea.

1377
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,820
I had heard about it from people
like something about salt and sea.

1378
01:22:09,821 --> 01:22:10,470
And I was like,

1379
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:14,210
I thought it was just like an area that
they called the salt and sea, you know,

1380
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:17,010
like the inland empire, right. Some
of the empire, you know what I mean?

1381
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:20,370
But they call it the inland empire.
The empire, the inland empire.

1382
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:22,470
They called the inland empire,
the same dragons there.

1383
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:26,250
Where's the drawbridge is not an
empire. Like this is just a town. Yeah,

1384
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:29,580
we don't have a mayor. We did. So I
thought the salt and sea was like that.

1385
01:22:29,581 --> 01:22:31,110
I thought it was like
this area that was just,

1386
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:33,200
they just named it that there's
no c in the middle of it.

1387
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:36,810
And then I've heard the story and then
I watched this documentary and it's

1388
01:22:36,811 --> 01:22:40,420
insane. So it was a
regionally, just it amazing.

1389
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:43,440
Verdad water from the Colorado
River. Yes. And then they got,

1390
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:48,090
they got fish in there, like a lot
of ocean fish, Tilapia. And um,

1391
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,160
people would catch him and
they would fish for him.

1392
01:22:50,161 --> 01:22:55,161
And now it's so bad that there are shores
of the beach that is completely filled

1393
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:57,084
with dead.

1394
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:01,680
Look at those dead fish completely
filled with dead fish bones.

1395
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:06,040
They have millions. That's
bones. Yeah, they have sand,

1396
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,920
but it's not sand.
It's just dead fish bones.

1397
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:12,060
Right. There's also bird habitats
there that are getting fucked.

1398
01:23:12,061 --> 01:23:13,590
And it is nowhere for the birds to go.

1399
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:18,370
Well we don't, we didn't realize until
recently a lot of folks didn't. Elise,

1400
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:21,040
how much agriculture was
going on in California.

1401
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:24,850
I mean California is all the way up to
San Francisco. If you take the five,

1402
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:28,000
you just run into farms.
It's everywhere.

1403
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:33,030
There's a lot of agriculture
and apparently a lot of
like tomatoes and most of

1404
01:23:33,851 --> 01:23:38,740
the almonds and all this different shit
gets grown in California and California

1405
01:23:38,741 --> 01:23:43,450
is using a lot of fucking water.
Oh yeah. Rice patties up north.

1406
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:48,120
Do we really? Yeah. Whoa. That's a lot
of water. That's a lot of water. Yeah.

1407
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:52,390
Everywhere is a lot of water elements
we're exporting Ahmed's. Yeah, sure.

1408
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:56,170
Alfalfa to they export a fuck
load of Alfalfa apparently.

1409
01:23:56,171 --> 01:24:01,030
And it's using a Chihuahua beef.
Right. I Dunno who use it, but um,

1410
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:04,720
you know, it's a big business.
The agricultural business
in California is giant.

1411
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:08,890
And it's just now because of this
now going on four year drought,

1412
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:12,730
they get to see like what,
how much water they really require.

1413
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:16,780
Cause before it was just sort of, they had
enough water, they used a lot of water,

1414
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:21,810
but they had enough water and now that
they don't use any less and there's none

1415
01:24:22,151 --> 01:24:23,880
coming in,
it's getting weirder.

1416
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:27,830
Well it's all about the Colorado River
and who gets dibs on it first then it's

1417
01:24:27,831 --> 01:24:31,040
all about who had it first.
So you've got,

1418
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:34,460
you've got farms way up north that are
at the mouth of it and they grab all the

1419
01:24:34,461 --> 01:24:36,860
water they want and you can't
tell them how much they can take.

1420
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:41,630
And so as it gets further down and more
and more people are taking more and more

1421
01:24:41,631 --> 01:24:44,570
of the water and also that the,
what do you call the water underground?

1422
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:49,440
The table? Yeah, the table there.
They're pulling from that. Yeah.

1423
01:24:49,441 --> 01:24:54,000
They're making more wells, right? The
Poland from the in in ground water.

1424
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,540
And they say that the earth crust is
going to start collapsing because of it.

1425
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:01,370
Isn't that fucking crazy that we didn't
know that there was water under us all

1426
01:25:01,371 --> 01:25:05,870
the time. Like I remember the first
time I, uh, went to a place that had a,

1427
01:25:05,871 --> 01:25:10,670
well I went wait a minute,
hold on. How does this work?
And the guy was like, well,

1428
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:12,050
everywhere under us,

1429
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:15,890
our rivers and rivers of water and
some of them stronger than other ones.

1430
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:19,190
And which you got to do is you got to
find the right river and do you find the

1431
01:25:19,191 --> 01:25:23,480
right river? You dig down to get to it
and then just pull water from it? I go,

1432
01:25:23,481 --> 01:25:28,100
it's just constantly has water in it.
Yeah. So there's like, this is not solid.

1433
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:31,760
We're on this thing that looks
like it's ground and it's solid,

1434
01:25:31,761 --> 01:25:35,000
but there's rivers under there. Yeah.
Like how far down is this fucking river?

1435
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:40,220
You know, it varies few hundred feet,
a thousand feet, couple thousand feet.

1436
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,070
But if you get down long
enough and the right area,

1437
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,350
you're going to run
into rivers. Yeah. But,

1438
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:48,070
and they never pop up on their own. And
that's the weird thing. You never see

1439
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:52,590
groundwater very rarely, right?
I mean, when you see a spring,

1440
01:25:52,591 --> 01:25:55,830
it's usually coming down from the top of
the mountains from the glacier run off

1441
01:25:55,831 --> 01:25:58,470
or the snow melting. Yeah. But there's,

1442
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:03,030
there's some underground water and
that's what's really become an issue with

1443
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:03,990
farmers that they're suck

1444
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:07,680
in that stuff dry. Right. It's
all becoming an issue and they,

1445
01:26:07,681 --> 01:26:11,210
and the equipment's getting better
and better to suck it out. And uh,

1446
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,360
like you said, the need is just
getting greater and greater.

1447
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,130
I think all I need to do,

1448
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:21,320
figuring out how to get the fucking salt
out of the ocean water and bon voyage,

1449
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,400
that's it.
You're going to have,

1450
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:26,270
you're going to see that shore is
just gonna grow and grow every year.

1451
01:26:26,271 --> 01:26:30,730
We're going to literally suck the ocean
that like a giant Straw able to start

1452
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,590
from one continent to
the next human robot,

1453
01:26:33,591 --> 01:26:37,830
Munster Straw sucking machine
that takes the ocean now,

1454
01:26:37,831 --> 01:26:40,400
which is huge tubes that are
as big as the Holland tunnel.

1455
01:26:40,401 --> 01:26:43,190
Just vole we,

1456
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:45,980
everybody would be pissed cause
that's all you would hear all day.

1457
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:50,390
You'd try to go to sleep each to have a
nice place to Santa Monica for they set

1458
01:26:50,391 --> 01:26:54,290
up the straw. Yeah. Right. Two o'clock
in the morning is when they turn it on.

1459
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:59,980
It's fucking giant machine,
but we need water everywhere.

1460
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:02,120
It just piles of fucking salt.

1461
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,360
They pulled out and they say the other
thing would happen is once we start doing

1462
01:27:05,361 --> 01:27:09,170
that is because they feed the salt
back in is that the oceans we become so

1463
01:27:09,171 --> 01:27:11,270
salinated who would kill all the fish?
Well,

1464
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:13,520
they wouldn't be able to feed it back
in and the more that has to take it to

1465
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:17,510
Utah, dump it in the mountains,
giving them Mormons. No, De Vida,

1466
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:21,140
they take it and they pour it over the
nuclear waste that they left. Right.

1467
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:26,080
Like you're pouring salt and just stay,

1468
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:29,870
I mean this isn't that where they
buried the nuclear waste. Right.

1469
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,600
Open up those tubes and pour it in there.
Fuck it.

1470
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:35,930
You could have a mountain of salt out
there and then people would take your

1471
01:27:35,931 --> 01:27:38,570
mountain assault. You know there's
a mountain of salt in, where was it?

1472
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:43,430
Germany that they've been chipping away
at for years and it's flat at the top

1473
01:27:43,431 --> 01:27:47,630
now because they've literally removed
all the songs. It was assault mountain.

1474
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:48,440
Yeah.

1475
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:51,530
Pull that picture up because it's the
most bizarre thing because it really does

1476
01:27:51,531 --> 01:27:53,060
look like a giant white mountain.

1477
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:57,020
Apparently it's all salt and they
just been eaten away at it. Wow.

1478
01:27:57,830 --> 01:28:01,590
He'll get that thing. No
Shit. Not incredible weight.

1479
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:05,900
That's naturally form. Yeah.
It's a natural salt mountain.

1480
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:11,420
What in the actual fucking shit is that?
Look at that thing.

1481
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:15,700
That's crazy. It's a salt
mountain. Cool. Go to the top. Ooh.

1482
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:19,190
Pulled out one. Everything is lush. No,
no, no. The one looked at. Sorry though.

1483
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:22,300
They'll look down one on the
upper left hand corner. Yeah.

1484
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:27,170
See if you could spread it
out. Whoa dude. What is Damn,

1485
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:30,740
how did that salt pile just pop
up under the ground like that?

1486
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:33,440
It's funny that they're taking it
from the top. They must've, you know,

1487
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:36,500
the Germans,
they even take it from the top first.

1488
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:41,950
We can be here mining salt for
a long time or a short time.

1489
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:48,140
We can make a lot of money
or we can buy up to you.

1490
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:53,300
You must learn from the lessons of the
Futura do not to take on a salt the

1491
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:57,440
mountain on two fronts. If you'll take
on this salt mountain from the bottom,

1492
01:28:57,441 --> 01:29:02,130
you will cut out its legs. It
will fall on you. You will. When

1493
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,680
did the chairman's turn?
Raj? Is that Russian?

1494
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:09,870
I'm just trying to be a Nazi will
fall on you trying to be evil.

1495
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:14,790
Yeah, they get to the top chip away at
it. How long have you been doing that?

1496
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,210
No fucking size of it. It's so weird.
Oh, it's this weird aberration.

1497
01:29:20,211 --> 01:29:23,900
Just popping up out of the ground
just doesn't seem to make sense.

1498
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:28,920
Did Hitler turned around the
economy of Germany? It's crazy.

1499
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:33,000
1976 had been doing it.
Oh my God. Look at this.

1500
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:35,010
As of January,

1501
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:40,010
2014 had covered 230 acres and contained
approximately 188 million tons of salt

1502
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:48,230
with another 90 tons being added every
hour around 6.5 million tons a year.

1503
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:53,430
How's it being added? I don't know. Oh,
so it's a heap, is that what it's saying?

1504
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:57,730
Okay, so it's on a mountain. Oh,

1505
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:01,440
so it's not naturally occurring.
Yeah.

1506
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:05,940
I mean number of sites where KNS
chemical company dumps sodium chloride,

1507
01:30:05,941 --> 01:30:06,990
common table salt,

1508
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:12,180
a biproduct of Topo Tash mining and
processing a major industry in the area.

1509
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:16,650
Oh, we're totally wrong. Yeah. Okay,

1510
01:30:16,651 --> 01:30:21,600
so that's a pile. So they're taking it
from the mines and they're just like,

1511
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:23,490
that's why it's like a pyramid.

1512
01:30:23,491 --> 01:30:26,790
So then they take it off the top of the
pile and then they're processing it.

1513
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:30,730
Beautiful. Wow. The amount of
salt that goes into the region,

1514
01:30:30,731 --> 01:30:34,770
soil and rivers is enormous
due to the high salt levels,

1515
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:39,540
the surrounding soils become
virtually baron and only hallow file.

1516
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:40,710
Hello file.

1517
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:44,670
I will fight halophyte
halophyte plants can grow there.

1518
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:46,230
The Wira,

1519
01:30:46,231 --> 01:30:51,231
w e r r a river has become so
salty that up to 2.5 gallons,

1520
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:54,390
g, l, whatever that means, chloride ions,

1521
01:30:54,391 --> 01:30:56,670
which is salted and
parts of the Baltic Sea,

1522
01:30:57,330 --> 01:31:00,340
that few freshwater organisms
can survive in it. Whoa.

1523
01:31:01,450 --> 01:31:03,270
Fucking hey man,
that's salty.

1524
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:07,940
And they lose their license to keep
dumping salt the facility until 2030 and

1525
01:31:07,941 --> 01:31:12,900
they just toxic. The whole
place is just salt toxic. Wow.

1526
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:16,230
That's nuts. So I thought, wow,

1527
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:20,010
that makes more sense though that it's
a pile than a weird white mountain that

1528
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,950
just didn't make any sense.
Like why is that there? Yeah,

1529
01:31:22,951 --> 01:31:25,770
I guess salt comes from
the sea and as a byproduct,

1530
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,580
no where else salt comes from
it. I don't know. Salt mines.

1531
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:31,470
So there definitely are salt mines,

1532
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:34,320
but like why does it exist
some places and not others?

1533
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:39,240
Like that's the most bizarre thing is
like there are certain plants that grow

1534
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:43,770
over areas that are likely to hold
diamonds. Is that right? Yeah. Like what?

1535
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:48,570
Yeah. Yeah. How the fuck did they figure
that out? How the fuck do you find?

1536
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:51,480
Forget about finding water.
How about finding diamonds?

1537
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:57,310
Some weird byproduct of pressure and Cole.
Yeah.

1538
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,770
What the fuck.
And once you find them,

1539
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,650
it's a fortune.
A fortune.

1540
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:06,400
Just it's dirt or it's a fortune
and there are a girl's best friend.

1541
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:09,280
She doesn't even know these fucking rocks.
They live in Africa.

1542
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:13,270
Can you really talk to
her when you're down?

1543
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:16,060
They've been under the ground
forever and ever and ever.

1544
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:19,660
That's such a hoary statement about women,
isn't it?

1545
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:21,850
Diamonds are a girl's
diamonds or your best friend,

1546
01:32:21,851 --> 01:32:23,650
like you care about more than any human.

1547
01:32:23,651 --> 01:32:26,020
You care about this
fucking expensive rock.

1548
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:30,910
Well that's like the biggest affront to
something like the feminist movement is

1549
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:34,840
the women that are just total sellouts
diamonds.

1550
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:39,660
They're my best friend. Yeah. But if
you want, you want to marry me? Yeah.

1551
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:42,070
I want you to buy a house.
Oh,

1552
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:45,430
I met this girl the other night and she's,

1553
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:49,270
we're shooting this pilot up in Hollywood
hills and we're at this house and it's

1554
01:32:49,271 --> 01:32:51,640
huge and it's got like five units.

1555
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:55,720
That house has been split up into five
units and you can see the Hollywood on

1556
01:32:55,721 --> 01:32:58,870
one side. You can see all of
La. On the other beautiful.

1557
01:32:58,871 --> 01:33:03,400
The house is worth about $4 million.
And the woman that is a, that owns it,

1558
01:33:03,401 --> 01:33:07,240
we're talking to her and I
said, oh, how long have you
had this house? She goes, oh,

1559
01:33:07,241 --> 01:33:11,110
I got it about nine months ago.
And she's got this accent I can't place.

1560
01:33:11,111 --> 01:33:14,110
It's maybe Israeli,
it's maybe Argentinian or something.

1561
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:17,110
And she says that she's been
dating this guy for three years.

1562
01:33:17,111 --> 01:33:22,111
And he started this company with his
wife and the company was worth $200

1563
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:25,480
million.
So then he was divorcing his wife.

1564
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:29,710
So during the divorce the
wife dies and she goes,

1565
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:33,850
so he was only getting out of 100 million.
She goes, but then, uh, the wife died,

1566
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:37,990
so now he gets a hold $200 million. So
I said to him, I want to get married.

1567
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:42,700
And he said, he's not ready. And I
said, well, I'm ready. You need to,

1568
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:45,400
you need something to let
me know that you're serious.

1569
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:50,470
So he bought her a $4 million
house, the car, the whole deal,

1570
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,260
and then she turns around
and rents out all that.

1571
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:57,850
She split it up into five units and rents
them all out and she's hustling good

1572
01:33:57,851 --> 01:34:02,830
for her. Yeah. She used a pussy properly.
That's right. She got herself a victim.

1573
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:07,360
You know, there's a lot of mercy. I
mean, she was, she was attractive,

1574
01:34:07,361 --> 01:34:10,300
but she was not worthy of $1 million.
He was supposed to come by,

1575
01:34:10,301 --> 01:34:13,570
but he didn't come by. I would imagine
he was older. Probably were work. Yeah.

1576
01:34:13,571 --> 01:34:15,090
It's probably wreck.
Just want someone to touch him.

1577
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:18,040
He's worth a fuck load of money. It just
gives her what she needs. It's like that.

1578
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:21,210
The guy that owned the clippers,
sterling,

1579
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:24,820
my girlfriend bought her a bunch of shit.
Yeah. It, everybody was like, you know,

1580
01:34:24,821 --> 01:34:29,740
look how much money spent on alert. He got
off cheap. All right. You know, I mean,

1581
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:33,430
the whole thing, the whole thing was
ridiculous. Yeah. Like what was he doing?

1582
01:34:33,431 --> 01:34:36,730
He's paying for her to be around him.
He's paying,

1583
01:34:36,731 --> 01:34:41,620
he's paying her her mortgage
or got her a place to cars,

1584
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:45,730
Bentley's Ferrari's and shit.
That's what happens.

1585
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:47,200
Like why is that so shocking to people?

1586
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:52,150
It's like when it actually gets exposed
like that, people had no clue. Of course,

1587
01:34:52,151 --> 01:34:55,240
it's a cliche. What do you
spend on a girlfriend? You know,

1588
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:58,460
you got to ask the average person
that proportional to his income.

1589
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:01,130
That's fucking nothing.
It's a cheeseburger.

1590
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:04,510
Proportionally you spend more money to
take your girl to dinner and a movie and

1591
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:09,320
he's a billionaire. A billionaire
is a thousand million dollars.

1592
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:12,260
Yeah, so he probably spent
less than a million on her.

1593
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:16,520
It probably spent a couple million, I
think all told the wife is suing her know.

1594
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:19,070
Oh that. Yeah. It is more cause
he would, there was jewelry.

1595
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:23,360
There was a bunch of shit. Yeah. Did
you are a lot townhouse, a lot of shit.

1596
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:27,710
There's a lot of shit I'd imagine some
cash changed hands to do. You know what?

1597
01:35:27,711 --> 01:35:31,970
I heard this one woman say, she goes,
I bet it wasn't even the wife's idea.

1598
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:33,200
I bet it was his idea.

1599
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,510
Use the wife to sue her to get the money
back and it makes sense. I was like,

1600
01:35:37,511 --> 01:35:40,550
God damn. It does make sense. Yeah.
Follow the paper trail on that.

1601
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:42,150
Then I got nervous talking
to her. I was like, oh,

1602
01:35:42,151 --> 01:35:45,260
I didn't even think
that what Jesus Christ,

1603
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:49,580
can you delete that photo,
that Selfie you took with me?

1604
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:54,590
I think we're playing tic TAC toe in.
This bitch is playing chess play planning.

1605
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:58,610
Many moves ahead like, Whoa, I
guess you could do it that way.

1606
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:01,620
Because the idea was like the CIC
set him up and he was like, Oh,

1607
01:36:01,621 --> 01:36:05,420
do you think you're going to profit from
this? Get us again, right guys again.

1608
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:09,340
All right. Cause if he sues her, it
looks bad and it looks vindictive.

1609
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,060
Looks like he's trying to sue
her for what she did to him,

1610
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:15,050
which I think he has every right to
quite honestly. I mean what he said,

1611
01:36:15,051 --> 01:36:15,441
first of all,

1612
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:19,910
he didn't use a single racial slur or
if people jumped all over that guy for

1613
01:36:19,911 --> 01:36:22,190
that.
But the actual words that he said where,

1614
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:26,570
I don't want you taking pictures
with these guys. That's it.

1615
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:30,860
He didn't say the n word. He literally
even said, I don't mind if you fucked up.

1616
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,470
And that was a part of that conversation.
I don't care if you fucked him,

1617
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:37,670
like he didn't have any exclusive deal
with her and this was a totally private

1618
01:36:37,671 --> 01:36:38,504
conversation.

1619
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:43,780
And so somehow or another she releases
it and of course he should sue her.

1620
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:46,490
Like, like what? Like what kind of,

1621
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:49,970
what kind of you think that was giving
you cars for it was giving you a car is

1622
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:52,160
to shut the fuck up. Well
not only that, like it,

1623
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:55,760
it winds up costing him
literally costing him the team.

1624
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:57,620
Like he had to sell the team.
Yeah.

1625
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:02,030
Like it became such a scandal
and such a PR disaster.

1626
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,670
Such a cluster fuck.
The way the media reported,

1627
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:08,690
the way they didn't talk about the fact
that they obviously had some weird open

1628
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:11,540
relationship where he was saying,
hey, I don't care if you fucked them.

1629
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:15,110
Like everybody concentrated on, don't
take pictures, don't take pictures,

1630
01:37:15,111 --> 01:37:19,800
don't take pictures. Yeah. He's an old
dude with a hot young girlfriend charity.

1631
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:23,780
I don't like the idea that him saying
that he didn't want her to take pictures,

1632
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:27,500
that this should be enough, that you
could take his team. That's insane.

1633
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,221
But you know,

1634
01:37:28,221 --> 01:37:31,250
it goes back to what we were talking
about earlier with like what we can get

1635
01:37:31,251 --> 01:37:34,490
away with on a podcast versus what
somebody else can get away with.

1636
01:37:34,491 --> 01:37:38,360
And you think about what he said
versus what we just sent my joke.

1637
01:37:38,361 --> 01:37:41,540
My joke is more harsh than what he
said and I'm not gonna lose anything.

1638
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:45,140
And I think the argument against him
was that he was a dick. He was a Dick,

1639
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:47,660
he was a dick all the time.
And that people didn't like him.

1640
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:50,390
And so that wasn't a loved guy.
It wasn't like this.

1641
01:37:50,391 --> 01:37:54,890
Like when the Joe Paterno thing happened
and found out that he knew about San

1642
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:55,950
Dusky and the trauma station,

1643
01:37:55,951 --> 01:37:59,040
like people were devastated
because Joe Paterno was like this,

1644
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:02,490
like really loved guy. But
you know, he was the coach,

1645
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,440
obviously 10 you got Kramer.
I mean,

1646
01:38:04,441 --> 01:38:08,640
here's the guy that had a fucking 10 year
run on the biggest sitcoms in history,

1647
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:13,730
most lovable guy on the show and one
buck and three minute interaction.

1648
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:19,140
And that dude is a ghost. He's a
ghost. Have you seen him lately?

1649
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,870
No, I haven't seen him.
No, he doesn't do anything.

1650
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,270
He's probably just eating
through that Seinfeld money.

1651
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:28,800
He doesn't do stand up anymore. Does
he? Doesn't come to the La call.

1652
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:31,410
I haven't seen him at any of the clubs.
I haven't seen him on TV.

1653
01:38:31,411 --> 01:38:32,460
I haven't read about him.

1654
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,320
That was a really tricky situation for
him to try to get into standup because he

1655
01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:39,600
had gone from Seinfeld too.

1656
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:43,710
He had at least one other show
that didn't work. At least one.

1657
01:38:43,711 --> 01:38:46,560
I want to see that too.
Um,

1658
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:49,570
and then he just started
coming to the clubs and,

1659
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:53,000
but he had done standup before
Seinfeld a long time, right? Yeah,

1660
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,540
but he took a long time off,

1661
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:59,010
especially took a long time off the La
clubs and then he would come out there

1662
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:04,250
and really probably should
have done something where
it was more like an evening

1663
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:09,690
with, what was his name again? He's
not Kramer. What the fuck's his name?

1664
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,480
Michael Richard and evening with my

1665
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:19,050
colonized in a lot of ways.
If he just did a laugh factory Gig,

1666
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,220
like an evening with Michael Richards,

1667
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:25,350
this had Michael Richards fans show up
and he tried to work out material until

1668
01:39:25,351 --> 01:39:28,780
he developed a set, then they'd be
in on the context of who he is. Yes.

1669
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:31,110
It wouldn't be offended by that.
Something like that. Not only that,

1670
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:34,800
he would get his audience wipe end.
He W that too.

1671
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:38,930
And you also wouldn't have him competing
with actual real standup. Yeah,

1672
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:41,610
because when you're doing the
laugh factory on a Friday night,

1673
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:45,150
you're doing it with five other people
on the show who might have sitcoms.

1674
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:49,320
They might be out there doing the road
on a regular basis hustling and they're

1675
01:39:49,321 --> 01:39:53,100
throwing heat and they have real jokes
and you go up there and you want to do a

1676
01:39:53,101 --> 01:39:57,000
bunch of pratfalls and you, you, you know,
you don't really have anything to say.

1677
01:39:57,180 --> 01:40:00,810
He tried to be silly and he would like
to ad Lib and it would fail miserably.

1678
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:05,010
Yeah, he'd do concepts and it, the
thing is like that and that wasn't new.

1679
01:40:05,011 --> 01:40:05,791
I went to,

1680
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:10,210
I was at the Improv and Louis C k one
night and Louis' father who he pretty

1681
01:40:10,211 --> 01:40:14,790
estranged from his whole life and he was
kind of like reconnecting with and his

1682
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:16,920
father's from Mexico Jewish guy.

1683
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:21,630
And so Louie invites him to the Improv
to see Louie do stand up for the first

1684
01:40:21,631 --> 01:40:23,370
time.
And so Louise,

1685
01:40:23,371 --> 01:40:28,020
like I've never seen Louie nervous to
go on before and before he goes on,

1686
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:32,760
Michael Richards goes up and there's a
couple in the front row that's Jewish and

1687
01:40:32,761 --> 01:40:35,040
they haven't done anything wrong,
but he starts,

1688
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:38,580
he's doing that character and he
goes, so it's gone. Oh you kikes,

1689
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:43,800
he leaves you big news, big nose. Jube
asked is like saying all this stuff.

1690
01:40:43,801 --> 01:40:48,390
But in the same way that he said
the black stuff, he didn't mean it,

1691
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:51,930
but he had no control of what
he was doing as a performer.

1692
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:54,700
And he thought that it
was all like a calculated

1693
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:59,680
risk and that we'd all get that this
was a character bit. And Louie was so,

1694
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:03,940
his father was clearly like, he's
fucking Jewish. What? And He's thinking,

1695
01:41:03,941 --> 01:41:07,030
this is what my son does. This is
like the environment my son works in.

1696
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:11,710
Wow. Did it fuck with it when you went
into this set now. So that was great.

1697
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:18,490
The problem with the guy was
he, he wasn't skillful. Right.

1698
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:22,240
And he was in the major leagues. Yeah.
And he was really insecure about it.

1699
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:25,840
And that was why had that reaction
to those people that heckled them.

1700
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:31,030
The reason why he called those guys
the n bomb was because those guys were

1701
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:32,980
yelling out the, it wasn't
funny. It wasn't like that.

1702
01:41:32,981 --> 01:41:34,660
He just picked on them for no reason.

1703
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:38,470
They started giving him a hard time
about not being funny about bombing,

1704
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:42,540
but they were right. They
were right. You know,

1705
01:41:42,541 --> 01:41:43,930
and he didn't like it and he didn't,

1706
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:45,910
he was uncomfortable and
didn't know how to handle it.

1707
01:41:45,911 --> 01:41:50,380
And he might've been on the,
yeah, y'all, Sean. He might've,

1708
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:56,110
he might've been on Dat Sun. Yeah.
I hear for things from people mine.

1709
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:59,680
I hear things.
I ain't might've been on that shit.

1710
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:02,110
He would get confident as a motherfucker,

1711
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:05,690
say hello to my little friend,
the n word

1712
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:11,650
that was, that was the first
of those videos. First of
those really viral videos.

1713
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:14,950
This was what I was going to point
this out earlier and I didn't,

1714
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:19,360
but I forgot when those moments
when you're trying to be funny.

1715
01:42:19,361 --> 01:42:21,160
Not that moment, obviously.
Cause I was just,

1716
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:24,960
there was such a poorly thought out
idea. It didn't make any sense. What?

1717
01:42:24,961 --> 01:42:28,180
So you can't just yell at somebody.
You can't just do that. You just can't.

1718
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:29,230
You just can't do that.

1719
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:32,980
You can't expect that people are gonna
think that's really funny and just so out

1720
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:35,830
to left field. So
nonsensical. So retarded.

1721
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:41,160
But there's these moments where people
take chances and they'll try to be funny

1722
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:46,060
and there's a split second between
that idea enters your head and you say,

1723
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:51,010
run with it. Yeah. And you run with it
and it's sucks. And you're like, Shit.

1724
01:42:51,070 --> 01:42:55,300
Especially if you're young or you're
nervous or you're not very good at telling

1725
01:42:55,301 --> 01:42:55,691
jokes.

1726
01:42:55,691 --> 01:42:58,990
Like how many people have said something
they wish they could go back in time.

1727
01:42:58,991 --> 01:43:01,930
And I hold back. Right. Just
cause they're just not skillful.

1728
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:04,210
Well,
and there's only one way to deal with it,

1729
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:08,140
which is to address what just happened.
Yeah. In an honest way. It's hard to do.

1730
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:10,240
It is for a young comic,
forget it.

1731
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:13,600
You just want to get away from that as
quick as possible and you don't realize,

1732
01:43:13,601 --> 01:43:15,580
no, you got to double
back and go into it again

1733
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:18,460
or you're just alienate them.
They know what just happened.

1734
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:19,690
Everybody knows what just happened.

1735
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:21,363
Yeah.

1736
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:24,970
Everybody can feel it and it's not going
to go away unless you go back and let

1737
01:43:24,971 --> 01:43:25,804
the air out of it.

1738
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:31,060
For a guy like him to go from Seinfeld
to essentially be in an open miker who's

1739
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:36,140
super famous is one of the
most bizarre journeys ever.

1740
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:38,270
Yeah.
I mean that guy was essentially,

1741
01:43:38,271 --> 01:43:42,080
he had the skill of someone who is
just beginning in standup comedy,

1742
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:47,020
but yet he's going on at the laugh
factory after dom Irrera. Yeah.

1743
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:47,821
I mean don,

1744
01:43:47,821 --> 01:43:52,490
my rare raw and Dane Cook and all these
guys are killing and and killing and he

1745
01:43:52,491 --> 01:43:56,360
goes up. Yeah. Jesus. It's
a terrible place to be.

1746
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:59,760
The only way to really
do that I think is to to,

1747
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,030
if he had a smart age in a smart manager,

1748
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:04,770
they would cultivate like an act for him.

1749
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,770
Like have someone work with them,
get a guy like you or a guy like,

1750
01:44:09,771 --> 01:44:10,551
um,
you know,

1751
01:44:10,551 --> 01:44:14,510
like Tony Hinchcliffe is great at writing
bits for people and you have a guy

1752
01:44:14,511 --> 01:44:16,220
like come with some premises for you

1753
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:21,350
and send me work like second
tier cities and do, um,

1754
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:25,250
you know, just to sets where
you're not going to be. Absolutely.

1755
01:44:25,950 --> 01:44:28,860
And let people in on what
the fuck you're doing.

1756
01:44:29,010 --> 01:44:31,980
Don't just show up and pretend
you're a real stand up, you know,

1757
01:44:31,981 --> 01:44:33,590
let people in on the fact that you're,

1758
01:44:33,970 --> 01:44:35,730
you're working on some new
bits you're working on,

1759
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:39,320
it's together. You guys are
helping me do this. Well, you know,

1760
01:44:39,321 --> 01:44:44,210
who started from scratch from a
pretty high place is um, chill. Uh,

1761
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,990
what's his name from talk soup.
Oh, Joel Mchale, Joel Mchale.

1762
01:44:48,010 --> 01:44:49,940
And they'd never done standup.
And it was like, you know,

1763
01:44:49,941 --> 01:44:54,100
had gotten huge from that Shell. And then
he just decided to start doing standup,

1764
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:58,380
but he'd go to a theater and he play a
lot of clips from the shell and he kinda

1765
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:02,270
did a, like you said, a one man show
kind of a thing that had stand up in it.

1766
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:06,590
And then I think over time he transitioned
into it just being full because that

1767
01:45:06,591 --> 01:45:10,070
dude,
he could sell 2000 seats out of the gate,

1768
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:12,740
but he didn't really know what to do,
but

1769
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:15,290
it was,
he would do a monologue on a show.

1770
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:19,630
So in a sense it was kind of doing
standard. I like the way Craig, uh,

1771
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:24,080
killed Kilborne does. Right. That was the
other guy though. Irish dude. So yeah.

1772
01:45:24,081 --> 01:45:28,010
Anymore. Ferguson, Craig Ferguson,
that guy. The way that guy does it,

1773
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:31,410
like he does stand up. I mean, I don't
know if he did stand up before, but did,

1774
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:32,120
he did,

1775
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:34,960
but it seemed like it because he does
stand up when he does his own thing.

1776
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:38,150
He did Improv. Oh, did
it? Yeah, he was like, uh,

1777
01:45:39,110 --> 01:45:41,030
I think he might've been part
of whose line is it anyway,

1778
01:45:41,031 --> 01:45:45,800
at some point we're just making shit up,
look it up.

1779
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:49,820
Um, but either either or. He was, uh,

1780
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,720
doing essentially stand up in his
monologues as, as Joel Mchale.

1781
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:58,130
So even though maybe he hadn't done a lot
of standup, like out in the clubs. Yeah.

1782
01:45:58,190 --> 01:46:02,540
He was still kind of doing it
on TV all the time. Yup. Yeah.

1783
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:04,130
He doesn't do it anymore.
Right. Let me stop.

1784
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:08,230
Did he stop? I think he did. I guess he,
he's doing movies. Yeah, he's got that.

1785
01:46:08,231 --> 01:46:09,850
Is that sitcoms still on community?

1786
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:14,840
I think it is. Right? It's on Netflix now,
right? It's done. He's a really nice guy,

1787
01:46:14,841 --> 01:46:19,820
man. He's a great dude. I did a
episode of a show. Yeah. Shit. Yeah.

1788
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:24,430
Really, really nice guy. Super easy
to get along with love standups. Yeah.

1789
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:28,980
There's a lot of respect for Stan. He's
just like very normal, you know, like,

1790
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,040
hey man, what's up? Hey, what's going
on? Thanks for doing this. Like,

1791
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,090
there's no weirdness.

1792
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:35,300
You know the weirdness that
you get sometimes when you
do somebody who's gay or

1793
01:46:35,301 --> 01:46:38,960
something and hanging out
with someone like yeah. Like,

1794
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:45,800
yeah. So he was a genuinely funny
guy. So for a guy like that,

1795
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:48,500
it's like you're so many headstarts.
They're like,

1796
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:50,550
I don't think Richards is a genuinely

1797
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:54,810
funny guy. I think he's just a
really good comedic like committer.

1798
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:58,170
He commits to call son of a guy.
Yeah.

1799
01:46:58,230 --> 01:47:00,600
I mean like when you would
slide into every episode,

1800
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:05,160
apparently Larry David did not like
that. Yeah, I could see that. Yeah.

1801
01:47:05,161 --> 01:47:07,200
Cause it was like so sticky.
Right?

1802
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:10,770
It was so obvious that it was going to
happen in every episode. He would come in,

1803
01:47:10,771 --> 01:47:14,970
it was like, it was too big. It comes
that Linnaean squigy moment. Hello? Yeah.

1804
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:19,500
Always walk in. I'm like,
yeah, but who would be dumb
enough? She's a hell. Exactly.

1805
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:23,920
But I think this, I liked when
he would do that. It's just,

1806
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:25,920
it didn't make the show less awesome.

1807
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:28,760
I mean it was definitely
a more slap sticky.

1808
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:34,030
Yeah. Some rains. That's the
best way of putting it. Yeah.

1809
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:36,820
Comedy Range is important.
I like really stupid jokes too.

1810
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,930
I like things don't have to
be 100% Patton Oswald for me,

1811
01:47:41,110 --> 01:47:44,200
like kidney patents. Hilarious. I
love his writing. I love reading,

1812
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:49,240
well sculpted bits,
but I also worry makes my innards fallout.

1813
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,270
He's so funny.

1814
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:54,410
Jim Breuer talking about his dad shitting
himself was apparently like one of the

1815
01:47:54,411 --> 01:47:57,920
all time funniest things that bill
bird ever seen. It's hysterical.

1816
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:59,840
Yeah. Jim Norton was talking
about it too. He's like,

1817
01:47:59,841 --> 01:48:03,800
you can't believe how funny this bit
is. Yeah. It's like it just, it hurts.

1818
01:48:03,801 --> 01:48:06,890
How funny this bit is. Yeah.
He's such a good dude too.

1819
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:11,750
He's another one was just such
a good dude. Just so nice.

1820
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:13,790
You know,
and you're around that guy.

1821
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:16,850
Like you watch them on stage
like it comes out of him.

1822
01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:20,860
Yeah, that he's like this a long island
guy. Yeah. He now it's all you can say.

1823
01:48:20,861 --> 01:48:25,600
I mean, think about Kevin James and Gary
Valentine and Ray Romano. All these,

1824
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:27,770
all these long island guys, they just, it,

1825
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:31,030
they don't get any better
than that is quality people.

1826
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:35,260
There was a east side comedy club out
there that produced a lot of really good

1827
01:48:35,261 --> 01:48:39,310
talent. Yeah. Brian Regan. He
was Florida. But I think he,

1828
01:48:39,370 --> 01:48:41,920
I think when he came to New York
he was like Johnny Long Island.

1829
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:44,930
Well that was,
I saw Jenny there.

1830
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:50,480
I saw genuine side comedy club when
he was in his prime and I remember um,

1831
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:55,160
one of the guys that works there was
talking about Jenny did a different hour

1832
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:58,730
for each show Friday and Saturday.

1833
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:01,540
He had four different hours all weekend.
They were all like,

1834
01:49:01,790 --> 01:49:03,110
we'd never seen anything like that.

1835
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:05,840
There were all humbled to
like what in the fuck? Yeah.

1836
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:11,210
Like there was a time in the late
eighties where Jenny was just on fire.

1837
01:49:12,230 --> 01:49:15,170
He was on fire and there was,
you know,

1838
01:49:15,171 --> 01:49:19,880
for whatever reason there was not as
much attention on him as some other guys

1839
01:49:19,881 --> 01:49:23,870
that had reached that same level
proficiency. Yeah. He got some attention.

1840
01:49:23,871 --> 01:49:26,720
Like you got some showtime specials
and stuff and he did really well.

1841
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:28,880
He always did really well in the road,
but

1842
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:32,600
I don't think he ever got the
recognition that he deserved.

1843
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:37,370
No, he got that one shot. Platypus
man. And it was on like a second day.

1844
01:49:37,371 --> 01:49:41,600
It was on like WB or one of those
channels and it's, you know,

1845
01:49:41,601 --> 01:49:45,920
it's tough because the guy was like
chiseled out to be a standup comic.

1846
01:49:45,921 --> 01:49:48,520
He was a fucking Formula One standup

1847
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:51,820
comedian, and I don't know how,
I don't remember the TV show,

1848
01:49:51,821 --> 01:49:55,540
but something tells me that maybe he
wasn't the greatest sitcom actor of all

1849
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:58,210
time and that he probably would've been
better suited to be a late night talk

1850
01:49:58,211 --> 01:49:59,240
show host or something like that.

1851
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,360
That was something that I think you
would have been better suited as being a

1852
01:50:02,361 --> 01:50:06,080
fucking awesome stand up comic. That's
what he was. Right. It's like musicians,

1853
01:50:06,081 --> 01:50:08,510
if you're a musician, they don't want
you to be a rockstar. They don't say,

1854
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:12,200
or rather a, I'm a movie
star. They don't say, hey man,

1855
01:50:12,201 --> 01:50:14,980
you know the way you sing and dance,

1856
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:18,410
you should stop doing that and just
start pretending like they don't.

1857
01:50:18,470 --> 01:50:22,730
They don't do that. But to a lot of
stand ups, especially in that era,

1858
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:24,920
it was like he wanted to
get that Seinfeld money.

1859
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:26,930
You want it to be Jerry Seinfeld,
do you want it to?

1860
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:31,670
And there's this thing about
like a guy with a big sitcom,

1861
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:36,020
whether it's a Tim Allen or anyone who
was like that and that day they got a

1862
01:50:36,021 --> 01:50:38,090
certain amount of prestige in Hollywood.

1863
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,370
And when you're on the
outside your whole life,

1864
01:50:40,371 --> 01:50:45,371
which a lot of stand ups are the big
wish other than just actual success,

1865
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,540
not just worrying about paying your bills,
the big wishes that you get inside.

1866
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:54,030
They finally love you. They take him
in, they take you in and who was,

1867
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:58,400
who was you trying to get to take you in
the Big Daddy? Hollywood, the Big Daddy.

1868
01:50:58,401 --> 01:51:01,870
Hollywood takes you into his
embrace, you know, and, and,

1869
01:51:01,871 --> 01:51:04,650
and turns out,
you know,

1870
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,510
one of the great all time sitcoms with
you at the helm of it and you're the new

1871
01:51:08,511 --> 01:51:11,570
Jackie Gleason and you're getting out
there with your wife and you're waving to

1872
01:51:11,571 --> 01:51:14,720
the crowd every day and everybody loves
you and you get the book and juicy

1873
01:51:14,721 --> 01:51:19,310
charge. That's what they want, the inside
charge. Right? And he never got that.

1874
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,310
Now,
I remember watching,

1875
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:25,600
I was in Vegas and I saw him out on the
strip with a camera before there were

1876
01:51:25,601 --> 01:51:29,380
selfies taking a selfie of himself in
front of a big marquee that had his name

1877
01:51:29,381 --> 01:51:33,910
on it, but it was like a second tier
hotel and I was just like, oh man.

1878
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:36,100
Wow, wow. And then you know,

1879
01:51:36,101 --> 01:51:39,040
from what I understand and you know,

1880
01:51:39,070 --> 01:51:44,070
it absolutely breaks my heart that he
took his own life because I think comics

1881
01:51:45,821 --> 01:51:50,800
are very vulnerable. I know I am. I get
very, very effected by, I wish I wasn't,

1882
01:51:50,801 --> 01:51:54,370
but I still like if I'm not getting the
money that I want or I'm not working a

1883
01:51:54,371 --> 01:51:58,720
club that I used to or whatever, it
can fucking really eat me up, you know?

1884
01:51:58,721 --> 01:52:02,440
Because it's so personal. I'm the product.
It's not, I'm not selling paper water.

1885
01:52:02,441 --> 01:52:06,520
It's me. If you're rejecting
an offer for me, it's me and,

1886
01:52:06,580 --> 01:52:08,260
and things go up and things go down.

1887
01:52:08,261 --> 01:52:11,920
But he was at a point where for the
first time, this is what I understand,

1888
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:16,540
his date book was not fold up filled
up for the year by like February and it

1889
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:21,630
always had been and that dude was doing
50 to a hundred corporate dates a year

1890
01:52:22,091 --> 01:52:23,980
at 25 grand a pop.

1891
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:29,560
And those were drying up and he couldn't
handle it because it felt like so much

1892
01:52:29,561 --> 01:52:34,300
of who he was was wrapped up in his
value as a comedian. And as it's,

1893
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:35,830
and I'm not saying it was eroding,

1894
01:52:35,831 --> 01:52:40,480
but in his mind it wasn't going in the
right direction. It was going forward.

1895
01:52:40,481 --> 01:52:43,800
It wasn't going out anymore.
This was it. He passed this peak

1896
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:47,710
and he was in his forties
that what it was pool

1897
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:53,840
and he, he was, his girlfriend
went inside to make breakfast.

1898
01:52:53,841 --> 01:52:58,610
They get out of bed and he just went in
the bathroom and shot himself and didn't

1899
01:52:58,611 --> 01:53:02,620
kill himself either. Oh, is that
right? No, he was still alive. Oh yeah.

1900
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:05,510
They to take him to the hospital. He
died in the hospital and the whole thing.

1901
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:09,710
Yeah.
It's beyond fucked man.

1902
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:14,830
But so strange how you like
a guy like Robin Williams,

1903
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:19,130
you know, you would look at in
sort of the same way like this,

1904
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:23,630
but him even more so because
he's so loved, so loved,

1905
01:53:24,170 --> 01:53:25,820
but he wasn't on the inside anymore,

1906
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:30,590
wasn't on the inside anymore and things
were starting to slip away as far as

1907
01:53:30,591 --> 01:53:33,740
like financial opportunities. He did
that sick call and that didn't work out.

1908
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:38,050
The movies that were interesting to him,
we're all like independent movies,

1909
01:53:38,150 --> 01:53:41,210
barely paid anything, you
know, and the big roles,

1910
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:43,580
they just don't happen that often.
Take them while they can.

1911
01:53:43,581 --> 01:53:45,330
But he had like a lot of overhead.

1912
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:50,110
But apparently when he died he still
had a fuck load of money. Oh Shit. Yes.

1913
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:51,710
Families fighting over right now.

1914
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:55,840
I knew his agent and uh,

1915
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:00,080
he wasn't broke by any
stretch of the imagination.

1916
01:54:00,081 --> 01:54:03,500
Like people would like to
say that, you know, like, oh,

1917
01:54:03,501 --> 01:54:06,050
the guy had just run
dry. Like, no, he hadn't.

1918
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:10,100
He needed to have a picture
for a good four or five movies.

1919
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:13,250
He had to be worth $100 million.
Well,

1920
01:54:13,251 --> 01:54:17,150
he definitely had made a lot of money.
How much it kept.

1921
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:19,970
You know when you're balling like that,
buying this,

1922
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,200
he had to like a $30 million ranch
somewhere like northern California,

1923
01:54:24,201 --> 01:54:28,220
some insane 60 acre fucking thing.
Yeah.

1924
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:32,090
One of the things he was trying
to get rid of before he died, he,

1925
01:54:32,091 --> 01:54:34,440
and I think there's a lot
of jewelry I remember there,

1926
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,970
take it to that liquidating his estate.
There was a lot like,

1927
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:39,050
I think he bought his wife
a shitload of jewelry.

1928
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:44,200
That's interesting to see at alimony
to pay more than once or twice.

1929
01:54:44,241 --> 01:54:47,950
Yeah, twice. That's why his nanny,

1930
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:50,900
he went after that nanny pussy.
Oh that's a trap.

1931
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:55,370
That's a trap because she's always
around, man. She's always around younger.

1932
01:54:55,371 --> 01:54:59,570
She's a better version of
your wife. Essentially. She
takes care of your cat. Yes.

1933
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:00,530
Go with your kids

1934
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:08,720
and at some point she was getting dressed
and he walked in at some point and

1935
01:55:08,721 --> 01:55:12,170
then you think in your head when,
I also think that for a lot of comics,

1936
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:17,200
a lot of guys who like genuinely need
love and acceptance and approval for a lot

1937
01:55:17,631 --> 01:55:21,530
of these guys and shit never turns off.
Nope. It's on all the time and it's,

1938
01:55:21,531 --> 01:55:25,070
it becomes like a demon that
needs to be fed. All right.

1939
01:55:25,071 --> 01:55:28,820
And when you're in a relationship and
things get bored and everything gets

1940
01:55:28,821 --> 01:55:30,500
stagnant,
you take each other for granted.

1941
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:34,010
They're not having it and not having
it. They got to keep moving. Yeah.

1942
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:35,720
They've got to keep
moving to the next charge.

1943
01:55:35,721 --> 01:55:39,140
So got to get the next dangerous
relationship. The next wild Ra. Yup.

1944
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:42,250
That's why drugs are involved
in a lot quick charge.

1945
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:44,160
Divorce was a flaming lunatic

1946
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,120
with riding his bike.

1947
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:48,540
That dude would go out and ride a hundred
miles on his bike every day. Really?

1948
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:51,650
Yeah. He was fucking psychotic
about riding spike. Hmm.

1949
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:53,850
Cause cause he'd stopped
doing all the drugs.

1950
01:55:53,990 --> 01:55:57,740
Oh yeah. That makes
sense. That makes sense.

1951
01:55:57,741 --> 01:56:01,190
Because you definitely get high from
running and you definitely get high from

1952
01:56:01,191 --> 01:56:05,000
any kind of like extreme cardio. Like
then you get that endorphin high, right?

1953
01:56:05,930 --> 01:56:08,990
Yeah. They talk about that being really
similar to the high that you get from

1954
01:56:08,991 --> 01:56:12,680
marijuana with some people because
apparently it's cannabinoids.

1955
01:56:12,681 --> 01:56:13,730
Cannabinoids get,

1956
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:19,240
they get activated by a you were
you doing cardio or doing jogging?

1957
01:56:19,791 --> 01:56:22,700
It's like a very similar thing.
That's why they call it runner's high.

1958
01:56:22,870 --> 01:56:26,650
Well I know guys that get high like on
their way to the gym. Do you ever do that?

1959
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,260
Oh yeah. It's a good
match. Dare you ask me.

1960
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:35,690
He asked me the different way. Do you ever
go to the gym when you're not high? No.

1961
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:39,060
Shit really get high all the time.
Especially before I lift weights.

1962
01:56:39,061 --> 01:56:42,390
What do I want to be sober? How does
it affect your work? Gets better.

1963
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:46,950
I get more into it. Yeah. Yeah. I feel
my muscles better. I feel like my tissue,

1964
01:56:46,951 --> 01:56:48,030
I feel things moving.

1965
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:52,770
I think that one of the things that pot
does that is a really underappreciated

1966
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:56,460
is it heightened sensitivity,
not just your sensitivity,

1967
01:56:56,461 --> 01:57:00,090
like physical sensitivity, like sexual
sensitivity. It definitely does that,

1968
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:02,730
but also like your sensitivity
to people's feelings,

1969
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:08,120
sensitivity to your own feelings and
your sensitivity to like lifting things

1970
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:10,070
when you lift things and,

1971
01:57:10,071 --> 01:57:13,080
and I'm not talking about getting
obliterated where you forget where you put

1972
01:57:13,081 --> 01:57:16,180
your keys. I'm like, God, where's my car?
Oh my God, how did I get here? Oh my God,

1973
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:18,060
I can't even remember walking in the door,
man.

1974
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:22,050
I'm talking about just a little bit high.
Just we know you're a little nervous,

1975
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:26,220
but you know what you're doing. You know?
And when you lift weights like that,

1976
01:57:26,221 --> 01:57:31,221
I feel like I'm more in tune with all
the different fibers of my muscle.

1977
01:57:32,161 --> 01:57:35,820
I'm more in tune with my balance.
I'm more in tune with where the,

1978
01:57:35,821 --> 01:57:38,640
where the weight's going.
It just feels more natural to me.

1979
01:57:38,641 --> 01:57:42,960
I'm more in tune with my body moving
as one unit. It just, I feel like

1980
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,960
we're focusing on the muscles that
you're using and not the other ones.

1981
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:47,820
Well,
focusing also on the,

1982
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:52,510
the entire body is a balanced thing
as opposed to just like if I'm lifting

1983
01:57:52,511 --> 01:57:54,640
something, my arm, just thinking
about my arm when I'm high,

1984
01:57:54,641 --> 01:57:56,890
I'm thinking about wearing
my legs are positioned,

1985
01:57:57,130 --> 01:58:01,580
how my gripping the ground with my toes.
Am I engaging my back and my this,

1986
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:03,160
my posture. Right. You know,

1987
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:06,730
you just get real sensitive to all
the different movements of the body.

1988
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,120
And in Jujitsu it's legendary.
Like very,

1989
01:58:10,150 --> 01:58:14,340
very few of these, uh, especially like,

1990
01:58:14,370 --> 01:58:17,470
like a lot of the Brazilian guys,
they came over and this,

1991
01:58:17,471 --> 01:58:21,280
one of the things that American guys were
shocked at how many Brazilian guys got

1992
01:58:21,281 --> 01:58:25,210
high before they did Jujitsu.
Apparently super,

1993
01:58:25,211 --> 01:58:29,920
super common even back in the day.
And nowadays it's a big part of Jujitsu.

1994
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:34,780
Marijuana in Jujitsu go hand in. I didn't
know that. It's a huge part of Jujitsu.

1995
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:39,490
It's not everybody and there's some
vehemently anti pot people. And uh,

1996
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:40,360
that was,
uh,

1997
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:45,220
one the issues that a lot of the Gracies
had with Eddie Bravo because Eddie

1998
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:49,090
Bravo is like, he's not just pro
pot. He's like an evangelist. I mean,

1999
01:58:49,091 --> 01:58:52,270
he's a guy who got me smoking pot and
he's like, he's not just saying, hey,

2000
01:58:52,271 --> 01:58:56,530
it's not bad for you. He's
saying it's amazing for you,
like you need to try this.

2001
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:01,410
And uh, but those punnets fit, that's
physical as well as mental funk.

2002
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:05,050
Yeah, it's, it's, you have
a heightened sensitivity.

2003
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:08,440
I think you have a heightened sensitivity.
And you also can get into a zone,

2004
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:11,230
like part of Jujitsu is
about getting into a zone.

2005
01:59:11,231 --> 01:59:15,190
You've got to get into like what's called
a flow state and a lot of that comes

2006
01:59:15,191 --> 01:59:18,820
from doing Jujitsu enough to
where it becomes second nature,

2007
01:59:18,821 --> 01:59:20,350
like move to become second nature.

2008
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:24,640
Like as if you make a mistake and you
put your hand in a certain position,

2009
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:27,790
the guy doesn't have to
think, okay, his arms here,

2010
01:59:27,791 --> 01:59:32,560
that means I can shift my hips and throw
my way across his face. It just happens.

2011
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:35,830
It happens before you even think about it.
You make that mistake and he's got it.

2012
01:59:35,831 --> 01:59:38,290
Like as you're making the mistake,
he's real.

2013
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:43,210
He's like literally a half of a second
behind you every step of the way,

2014
01:59:43,211 --> 01:59:45,250
capturing all of your mistakes,

2015
01:59:45,251 --> 01:59:49,330
anticipating them and capturing them and
that happens in this weird flow state

2016
01:59:49,570 --> 01:59:53,770
and it happens better for me
at least when I'm high and see,

2017
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:56,920
I can sense a difference
between boxing and you get to,

2018
01:59:56,921 --> 02:00:01,450
it's like in boxing you could last a
round or two as an unequal opponent,

2019
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:05,350
but in Jujitsu they're going to find the
weakness and exploit it pretty quickly.

2020
02:00:05,410 --> 02:00:09,880
Yeah. You, if you're athletic and fast,
you can do surprisingly well in a boxing,

2021
02:00:09,881 --> 02:00:13,910
right? Surprisingly well. Yeah. If,
especially if you have advantages,

2022
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:16,210
physical advantages like if
you have a really good athlete,

2023
02:00:16,211 --> 02:00:19,660
so he could took a like an
Oto Sinco that Chad Oto,

2024
02:00:19,661 --> 02:00:23,650
Oto Cinco guy like super
athlete fast as fuck, you know,

2025
02:00:23,651 --> 02:00:26,710
and he knows how to throw punches a
little bit. You know what I'm saying?

2026
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:31,180
If you pay a cocky as hell,
cocky and just super athletes so fast,

2027
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:32,470
if you put that guy,

2028
02:00:32,471 --> 02:00:35,140
give him a little bit of time to train
and you put them there with like a

2029
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:37,270
journeymen amateur boxer,

2030
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:40,180
not an amateur boxer that
like wins world championships,

2031
02:00:40,181 --> 02:00:43,090
but a guy who's had a few
amateur fights under his belt,

2032
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:45,730
chill Cinco might fuck that dude up.
You know what I mean?

2033
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:47,980
But just based on his
own physical advantages.

2034
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:53,700
But if you put Ochocinco in ag and put
him on the ground with any Brazilian

2035
02:00:55,571 --> 02:00:58,060
Jujitsu, black belt, he's
going to get fucked up.

2036
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:01,390
Immediate hundred percent he's going to
get wrapped up and here he is right here

2037
02:01:01,391 --> 02:01:05,170
working out. I mean the dude is just,
Oh damn. Actually he's got hands.

2038
02:01:05,590 --> 02:01:09,760
Did some working on a boxing gym. Yeah,
I'll do it. He can throw some punches.

2039
02:01:09,761 --> 02:01:13,610
He's very fast. Yes, that he would
fuck up a lot of people. He really,

2040
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:15,760
his cockiness is a big part of it too.

2041
02:01:15,990 --> 02:01:19,360
We'll also be able to stand in
your shoes and face a guy for sure,

2042
02:01:19,361 --> 02:01:20,890
but also physical ability.

2043
02:01:20,891 --> 02:01:23,590
Like he obviously has the ability
to throw very fast punches there.

2044
02:01:23,591 --> 02:01:26,360
He'd be dangerous to anybody.
But Godfrey,

2045
02:01:26,650 --> 02:01:31,510
the John Jacques Machado is one hand,
one of his hands is a thumb. Okay.

2046
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:35,560
If John Jacques Machado got ahold of the
shadow Sanko he's going to sleep. Yeah,

2047
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:38,260
100% of the time.
Every single time.

2048
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:42,860
Every single time that they clinch up.
I mean if they're striking evolve,

2049
02:01:42,861 --> 02:01:46,610
it can be very differently. If it was, if
was, if he didn't want grapple with them,

2050
02:01:46,910 --> 02:01:49,250
that guy is probably
so strong and so fast.

2051
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:53,600
If he knew a few take down defenses
and knew how to stuff, some of that,

2052
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:57,780
it would take like a really good wrestler
to bring him to the ground. But if uh,

2053
02:01:57,880 --> 02:02:00,110
a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
blackbelt got ahold of him,

2054
02:02:00,111 --> 02:02:03,020
he's going to get tapped every time.
It's just a different thing.

2055
02:02:03,021 --> 02:02:06,220
It's not completely
dependent on athleticism.

2056
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:10,760
Whereas like fighting is a
lot of athleticism. Movement
is a lot of athleticism.

2057
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:12,380
There's some guys that you see,

2058
02:02:12,381 --> 02:02:17,030
they fight in the UFC and even though
they're doing well, it's like, you know,

2059
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:19,620
they're headed towards a cliff.
Like you,

2060
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:23,480
there's a certain aspect they're
missing in their movement.

2061
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:25,640
There's a certain amount of speed.

2062
02:02:25,641 --> 02:02:29,690
They're missing certain amount of
violence that they just can't, they just,

2063
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:33,170
they just can't put out,
they can't do it the way other guys can.

2064
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:36,530
And there's some guys that just
like natural from the jump,

2065
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:39,170
it can do it way better than
you. And a lot of ways. Yeah.

2066
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:42,020
And those guys were always going
to be champions. There's, there's,

2067
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:47,050
this is like this champion body and his
champion mindset and they vary, you know,

2068
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:48,630
the varies by looks.
And some of them,

2069
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:52,910
some of them might actually look like
Chubby, but it's not about what they look,

2070
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,660
it's about what they can do with that
body. And some people just don't have it.

2071
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:57,460
They just don't have,

2072
02:02:57,460 --> 02:03:01,360
well yeah, because it's an
eight. I mean it's, it's the
innate sport. It's survival.

2073
02:03:01,510 --> 02:03:04,450
You know, it's before, before
there were weapons and there was,

2074
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:07,420
there was basically Jujitsu. There
was guys that were just, you know,

2075
02:03:07,450 --> 02:03:11,380
mixed martial arts. That was, that was
survival and there was no training for it.

2076
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:14,910
Well, there was some training for a long
time and they've been training things

2077
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:19,830
thousands. And I'm talking about caveman
man. Okay man, fuck yeah. I think the,

2078
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:24,150
there's, there's like images on the walls
and pyramids of some sort of grappling,

2079
02:03:24,510 --> 02:03:27,290
like people who have been trying to figure
out what's the best way to get people

2080
02:03:27,291 --> 02:03:31,140
to the ground and beat the fuck out
of me for a long time. But it's just,

2081
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:34,860
you know, it's until recently they
didn't really have it down. Right.

2082
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:38,070
They didn't really know what they were
doing until the last hundred years or so.

2083
02:03:38,130 --> 02:03:41,880
Right. And the last 20 has been
more, there's more, more evolution.

2084
02:03:41,881 --> 02:03:45,780
The last 20 years in martial
arts in the last 20,000 yeah.

2085
02:03:45,930 --> 02:03:48,780
As soon as they figured out mixed
martial arts, UFC came along,

2086
02:03:48,810 --> 02:03:50,970
people started figuring out what
works and what doesn't work.

2087
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:53,960
And you realize like there's a lot of,

2088
02:03:54,750 --> 02:03:57,090
there's a lot of shit that people
have been doing for a long time.

2089
02:03:57,091 --> 02:03:58,340
It's just nonsense.
Yeah.

2090
02:03:59,030 --> 02:04:02,870
Well, it all said, Yah. Physical training
is so different. People, you know,

2091
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:07,100
understanding the way muscles work and
you know what kind of aerobic exercise is

2092
02:04:07,101 --> 02:04:08,360
best with,
you know?

2093
02:04:09,190 --> 02:04:09,800
Yeah.

2094
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:12,050
I mean I don't know it look at me,
what do I know?

2095
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:18,960
I get on a fucking elliptical machine
for a half hour and watch CNN and then I,

2096
02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:19,551
I live in,

2097
02:04:19,551 --> 02:04:24,551
I knew that nothing I do about maybe
seven or eight sets of stuff and I'm gone.

2098
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:28,280
I see Callen come in,
he works out in my gym,

2099
02:04:28,610 --> 02:04:32,630
Callin comes in and he does this 25 minute
workout that it looks like he's in a

2100
02:04:32,631 --> 02:04:36,560
fist fight for 25 minutes in the gym.
He's working hard. Oh yeah. Really?

2101
02:04:36,561 --> 02:04:38,370
He works with Guy Lou,
this trainer

2102
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:40,800
and Lou just pushes them
through and he's just like,

2103
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,810
it's this total like
crossfit kind of thing.

2104
02:04:42,811 --> 02:04:47,790
Raise up doing crunches on and then he's
pushups and fucking crazy like kettle

2105
02:04:47,810 --> 02:04:52,410
bells and, and then he's just like
Superbad like the what the fuck was that?

2106
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,290
Cause it's the only 25
minutes and he looks great.

2107
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:59,310
You see that guy's body at his age now?
Seriously,

2108
02:04:59,740 --> 02:05:03,900
cock is delicious. It's not
delicious. But you know,

2109
02:05:03,901 --> 02:05:07,920
you've been staring at the balls.
Offsets the luck real close.

2110
02:05:08,790 --> 02:05:12,360
He um, he works out with
that box and burn place too.

2111
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:14,490
So one of those cardio bus since he moved.
Yeah.

2112
02:05:14,491 --> 02:05:18,600
He's not in my gym as much as he moved.
He used to be on the west side West, so,

2113
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:21,860
so he does boxing training.
Well that's where he was.

2114
02:05:21,861 --> 02:05:25,530
He was doing it down in Santa Monica
with Wayne McCullough. Call Yammer.

2115
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:30,510
World champion, right? Yeah. He teaches
people how to box on there. Wow. Yeah.

2116
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:33,930
But Brian was getting hit in the head for
awhile. I had to talk to him about it.

2117
02:05:33,931 --> 02:05:36,900
I'm like, why? He's sparring with
people. It's getting whacked in the head.

2118
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:39,990
We went to Germany and impulsive,
ridiculous person.

2119
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:45,180
Maybe she shouldn't be getting punched
by random 20 year olds. Protect it.

2120
02:05:45,181 --> 02:05:48,480
You got left asked you if you want
to spar. It's just saying, okay,

2121
02:05:48,481 --> 02:05:52,890
he's sparring with people.
Like, whoa. Yeah. Easy boating.
Yeah. That's not necessary.

2122
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:58,020
Yeah. That's not good for you. He spar
though. You just sparked Jujitsu Jitsu,

2123
02:05:58,050 --> 02:06:00,260
sparring. It's different because you're
not getting hit in the head, right?

2124
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:01,620
You could do it.
Look,

2125
02:06:01,621 --> 02:06:05,670
you could spark as long as you spar with
someone you trust and you're going to

2126
02:06:05,671 --> 02:06:08,850
get hit a few times, but it's not a few
times you really have to worry about.

2127
02:06:08,851 --> 02:06:13,020
It's the accumulation of many,
many gym wars.

2128
02:06:13,090 --> 02:06:17,190
It really winds up fucking
guys up. Right. That's um,

2129
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:21,330
it's more common than you think
you ever grappled with Joey Diaz.

2130
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:25,740
No one Joey on top. You,
you've got a stream that man,

2131
02:06:25,741 --> 02:06:29,880
if you set up a match with you and
Joey Diaz just to see it physically,

2132
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:32,570
what did we know? What if
he dies? What's going to do?

2133
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:40,890
Went away to go, imagine you trying
to give a eulogy at the funeral,

2134
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:45,870
but he was so mad at me. Sorry.
Rogue and you fucking Ozil.

2135
02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:51,420
I would just let them tapping. You
couldn't tell. That's the thing.

2136
02:06:51,421 --> 02:06:56,360
You'd have to kill him.
Kill Joey Diaz. He'd be,

2137
02:06:57,270 --> 02:07:00,960
if he got you inside control a guarantee
you Joey knows how to hold his weight

2138
02:07:00,961 --> 02:07:01,260
down.

2139
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:06,260
He's learned from Hagen Machado and
Machado is a legit world championship

2140
02:07:06,541 --> 02:07:10,920
caliber black belt, and he's teaching
Joey Real Jujitsu. Joey's 300 pounds.

2141
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:14,040
If he gets on top of you and get site
control, good luck getting out of there.

2142
02:07:14,070 --> 02:07:17,100
You think he could hold you? I don't
know. I wouldn't want to find out.

2143
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:19,350
I wouldn't want them. On top of
that should be what the video is.

2144
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:21,000
He starts on top of you.

2145
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:25,680
It's whether or not you can get away from
Joey Diaz that that would get about a

2146
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:29,910
million downloads. Well,
I don't want to do it.

2147
02:07:30,930 --> 02:07:34,590
I'll help. I'm scared. I'll go into
there with you. We can both fit.

2148
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:39,370
I'll bring a knife together. We might
not get out. You know, it will be like,

2149
02:07:39,371 --> 02:07:42,550
we'll be like those two guys at that
prison upstate New York who got the power

2150
02:07:42,551 --> 02:07:46,480
tools to escape. What happened?
You didn't hear about that. Oh,

2151
02:07:46,481 --> 02:07:48,540
this is the greatest
fucking story of the year.

2152
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:53,290
Two dudes in a maximum security prison
in upstate New York. 3000 inmates.

2153
02:07:53,590 --> 02:07:58,590
These dudes got through fucking inch
thick steel walls with power tools.

2154
02:08:00,401 --> 02:08:03,790
They'd stolen from the prison,
went down into the piping,

2155
02:08:03,791 --> 02:08:08,260
like classic old school, like
Birdman, Clint Eastwood movie.

2156
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:12,160
And they went into the sewer pipes and
they came up through a manhole cover on

2157
02:08:12,161 --> 02:08:16,030
the other side. They've been missing
since Friday night. Oh my God.

2158
02:08:16,570 --> 02:08:19,480
Five days they've been gone.
They have no fucking idea where they are.

2159
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:22,800
So they're out in the wild. They were
out in the wild and they, they escaped.

2160
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:27,220
He escaped at night and they didn't find
him until the morning. That's amazing.

2161
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:30,700
And they left a little post it
note, uh, saying see you later.

2162
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:32,200
A little Chinese guy smiling.

2163
02:08:32,930 --> 02:08:33,763
Watch.

2164
02:08:34,030 --> 02:08:36,730
I don't know. I think it was
racist. Whoa. Well it said,

2165
02:08:36,731 --> 02:08:38,650
see you raider didn't really

2166
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:45,940
go to that store. I need to
see more JV. Don't go turn
away. Go Up to the top. Like,

2167
02:08:45,941 --> 02:08:50,200
when is it, when is it loud enough
that you can use fucking power tools?

2168
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:51,730
Power tools in a ruse.

2169
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:54,340
Oh Wow.

2170
02:08:55,470 --> 02:08:57,810
What is, uh, what did,
uh, what was the ruse?

2171
02:08:58,590 --> 02:09:02,600
They left a stuffed up pillows
with a Hoodie. I mean the, the,

2172
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:07,020
the classic stuff. Bed for bed
check. What did these guys do?

2173
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:09,720
Murder one murder to a cop.

2174
02:09:09,890 --> 02:09:10,770
Oh God.

2175
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:14,330
They're looking for them in the wilderness
and rural communities of northern New

2176
02:09:14,330 --> 02:09:19,100
York. Right? Duping wow. It's, it's like
right out of a four in Canada, they had a,

2177
02:09:19,130 --> 02:09:23,720
they had a dummy fashion as sweatshirts
using power tools to drill out of their

2178
02:09:23,721 --> 02:09:25,700
cells.
The Clinton correctional facility,

2179
02:09:25,701 --> 02:09:30,050
the men made their getaway late Friday
or early Saturday emerging on the other

2180
02:09:30,051 --> 02:09:34,310
side of the prisons, 30 foot
tall walls. Wow. How good.

2181
02:09:34,311 --> 02:09:38,990
Must've fell to get out.
How good must that have felt?

2182
02:09:38,991 --> 02:09:41,810
Just troll through that hole.
That's the seat

2183
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:45,230
that, that raising Arizona
moment where your birth memory,

2184
02:09:45,250 --> 02:09:48,760
that moment where John Goodman comes
out of the earth and it's muddy and it's

2185
02:09:48,761 --> 02:09:49,594
like he's being

2186
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:54,130
born.
I wonder how the fuck they could get,

2187
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:57,250
get away with this. Is there a way
to get away with it? Ultimately,

2188
02:09:57,251 --> 02:09:59,320
in this day and age, I mean,
this is a crazy day and age.

2189
02:09:59,830 --> 02:10:02,920
Everyone's got a credit card, you
know, it's hard to just have cash.

2190
02:10:03,050 --> 02:10:07,430
Well also, you know, they're going to put
their, their faces out on digital media.

2191
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:08,570
They would see their faces.

2192
02:10:09,910 --> 02:10:10,743
Hmm.

2193
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:12,003
Uh,

2194
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:15,830
and the other crazy thing is their
cells were next to each other.

2195
02:10:16,130 --> 02:10:20,840
So not only did they tunnel out,
they tunneled in between their two cells.

2196
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:25,530
Dude, there's a, Oh wow, that's
crazy. Employee question.

2197
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:29,050
Yeah. This guy was supposed to maybe
pick them up and then he bailed.

2198
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:31,360
He was going to pick
them up on the outside,

2199
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:33,950
but he went to the hospital
instead and I don't know.

2200
02:10:34,810 --> 02:10:35,410
Yeah,

2201
02:10:35,410 --> 02:10:39,510
I hate cnn.com cause he was launch a
video on it. I don't want the video. Yeah.

2202
02:10:39,511 --> 02:10:44,210
Let me read. I can still
read investigators.

2203
02:10:44,220 --> 02:10:45,780
Think a woman who worked with Richard,

2204
02:10:45,781 --> 02:10:50,700
Matt and David Sweat at the Clinton
correctional facility plan to pick up the

2205
02:10:50,701 --> 02:10:53,730
convicted killers after the escape,
but changed her mind at the last minute.

2206
02:10:54,030 --> 02:10:57,360
So she worked there. She went to a
hospital this weekend because a panicked,

2207
02:10:57,490 --> 02:11:01,330
oh yeah,
there's a little stress.

2208
02:11:02,450 --> 02:11:07,260
Stress. Wow. You managing the stress of
helping murderers get out of the cage.

2209
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:08,310
So what was going on?

2210
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:12,030
Let me see what she looked like because
somebody must've been given her some

2211
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:16,490
Dick. Oh, ah. Prison
guards are really high.

2212
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:21,030
Right to at Jamie. Yeah, that's
exactly what was happening.

2213
02:11:21,210 --> 02:11:25,110
Someone who was slinging some Dick
our way. I would if I was in prison.

2214
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:30,750
Yeah. It looks in, first of all,
that is gold in prison. That woman,

2215
02:11:30,870 --> 02:11:33,090
I mean it's,
it's hard to get any love at all.

2216
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:34,710
It doesn't matter if
she's a little overweight,

2217
02:11:34,711 --> 02:11:37,380
she's kind to you and she's female.
You'd be super psyched.

2218
02:11:37,470 --> 02:11:40,230
I'm trying to think how low the
bar could go if I was in prison.

2219
02:11:40,231 --> 02:11:44,400
It guy really low. Small Guy, Asian.

2220
02:11:44,790 --> 02:11:47,520
Whatever you want.
I'm going to go Asian on this one.

2221
02:11:49,050 --> 02:11:53,470
Look at her poor bitch.
Double Chin classes.

2222
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:58,230
Enormous. Probably food addict.
Can't see she, she was in love.

2223
02:11:58,910 --> 02:12:02,730
She said poop thrown at her for the
last 20 years. What's good? Yeah. Right.

2224
02:12:02,790 --> 02:12:06,510
What's going on now, man?
What's going on with her cheese?

2225
02:12:06,930 --> 02:12:10,800
She must've confessed. Right? The trouble
is that these guy, one was a cop killer.

2226
02:12:10,801 --> 02:12:14,880
So any her helping them in any
way. She's gotta be, she's,

2227
02:12:14,950 --> 02:12:19,620
she's walking by inside.
She's fucked. Yeah. Well not
only she walking dead inside,

2228
02:12:19,621 --> 02:12:22,590
she's going to jail. Well,
we don't know what she did.

2229
02:12:23,430 --> 02:12:27,530
She probably made a deal. She made a
deal, but she didn't do it out of it.

2230
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:32,040
But it doesn't matter. She cries because
she knew that these guys were escaping.

2231
02:12:32,070 --> 02:12:36,420
Right. These guys are free. So if these
guys, these free men look at the creeps,

2232
02:12:36,630 --> 02:12:41,070
look at him. Quavers they look
really creepy. They do. Well,

2233
02:12:41,071 --> 02:12:45,530
they're real murderers. Yeah.
Look at them. If you, um,

2234
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:46,810
okay.

2235
02:12:46,810 --> 02:12:48,940
If you just think about running into them,
I mean if you're,

2236
02:12:48,941 --> 02:12:51,670
if you're someone who runs it to them
and then you get kidnapped or you get

2237
02:12:51,671 --> 02:12:54,400
killed because they're trying to
get a car or something like that,

2238
02:12:54,401 --> 02:12:58,390
that woman is almost directly responsible
for that she could have prevented it.

2239
02:12:58,660 --> 02:13:02,290
Well, and they're going to kill people
because, uh, there is no going back.

2240
02:13:02,770 --> 02:13:03,760
There's no going back.

2241
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:07,060
They'll be in solitary for the
rest of their lives no matter what.

2242
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:10,480
Slane deputies, brother. I
just hope he doesn't come back.

2243
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:12,143
Wow.

2244
02:13:13,870 --> 02:13:16,930
Ooh. Yeah. Cause there's a party
you that, I hate to say this,

2245
02:13:16,931 --> 02:13:19,690
that pulls for them just
because it's so fucking crazy.

2246
02:13:20,020 --> 02:13:23,800
But then you get to remind yourself
that they're pieces of shit. Exactly.

2247
02:13:23,801 --> 02:13:26,470
You got to remind yourself like what
if that was your brother they shot and

2248
02:13:26,471 --> 02:13:28,840
killed, right? Yeah.

2249
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:32,220
But it is easy in because
of all the movies.

2250
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:35,750
You see that to come up with a plan.
Yeah.

2251
02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:41,090
Well people have these fucking cells
and they're in them for 20 hours a day.

2252
02:13:43,590 --> 02:13:46,800
You have time to think.
It's all you're thinking about.

2253
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:49,500
Whereas the guards are thinking
about a thousand things.

2254
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:52,890
They think they've got everything covered.
But you start putting data together.

2255
02:13:52,891 --> 02:13:57,420
Like I know that the guard is at this
spot at two o'clock at two 15 he goes down

2256
02:13:57,421 --> 02:13:58,440
usually to take a piss.

2257
02:13:58,441 --> 02:14:01,620
You know when you have these ideas in
your head of how this is going to plan out

2258
02:14:01,950 --> 02:14:04,020
and when you see a path,

2259
02:14:04,021 --> 02:14:07,200
you see a path and you've been studying
it for years and years and years.

2260
02:14:07,530 --> 02:14:10,530
He just run for it.
Cause run for some weird path.

2261
02:14:10,610 --> 02:14:12,260
Okay, I've got a son. I get it. I,

2262
02:14:12,261 --> 02:14:17,000
cause I know when I was 1314
years old and I was grounded.

2263
02:14:17,690 --> 02:14:22,460
I was fucking out of there. I had my
window, I was on the second story,

2264
02:14:22,461 --> 02:14:23,960
but over a sheer drop.

2265
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:28,400
And there was a ledge outside my window
that was about two feet long at a 45

2266
02:14:28,401 --> 02:14:30,350
degree angle with the old shingles on it.

2267
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:34,690
And I used to have to go out my window
and Shimmy, holding the doorframe,

2268
02:14:34,820 --> 02:14:37,070
holding in the window,
frames of all the other windows,

2269
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:41,360
all the way across to this side of the
house where I could jump down. And uh,

2270
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:46,220
I used to go out every night and I
climbed back in again off a ladder that I

2271
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:51,260
kick over and they never caught me until
one night I came home and I was drunk

2272
02:14:51,321 --> 02:14:55,550
as shit. And uh, and my father, I
remember my father threw a beaten on me.

2273
02:14:55,820 --> 02:14:58,400
So I went upstairs and I was like,
fuck this.

2274
02:14:58,790 --> 02:15:01,670
So I opened up the window and
I guess I was like, you know,

2275
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:03,920
going loud because I was so mad.

2276
02:15:03,980 --> 02:15:06,590
And so I all sudden I looked down in the
back yard and there's my mother and my

2277
02:15:06,591 --> 02:15:10,130
father. My father goes,
Craig, get off the roof.

2278
02:15:10,131 --> 02:15:14,630
You're drunk and I shot like a squirrel
over the top of the roof and onto the

2279
02:15:14,631 --> 02:15:19,010
front yard. Dove down, ran down the
hill, ran away for like three days.

2280
02:15:19,070 --> 02:15:22,580
Oh my God, you rebel.
And uh, did you really?

2281
02:15:22,610 --> 02:15:25,130
Three days and the whole
time I was gone I was like,

2282
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:29,270
they don't fucking know where I am. I'm
a, I met my best friend's house and he's,

2283
02:15:29,271 --> 02:15:29,721
he's got a,

2284
02:15:29,721 --> 02:15:33,290
he lives in like this tenement and as
he's got a single mom and meanwhile she

2285
02:15:33,291 --> 02:15:35,650
had called them [inaudible].

2286
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:38,960
What do you think a parent's not going
to call another parent when their kid is

2287
02:15:38,961 --> 02:15:42,440
staying at their house? I'd literally
didn't occur to me that they were onto me.

2288
02:15:43,330 --> 02:15:46,780
So did they let you stay there for a
few days? A cool off. Was that the idea?

2289
02:15:46,930 --> 02:15:49,750
They wanted nothing to do with
it. They just, they just let,

2290
02:15:49,751 --> 02:15:52,720
and I remember coming
home after three days,

2291
02:15:53,380 --> 02:15:57,220
I cooled down and I remember walking
home was a Sunday night and the sun had

2292
02:15:57,221 --> 02:16:01,270
gone down and I walked through my
backyard and I looked in the living room

2293
02:16:01,271 --> 02:16:05,920
window and my mom was up one light on
reading the newspaper and I just remember

2294
02:16:05,921 --> 02:16:09,820
looking at it thinking she was just so
all alone and it struck me for the first

2295
02:16:09,821 --> 02:16:14,410
time like, wow, she really,
she, she missed me, you know,

2296
02:16:14,411 --> 02:16:17,890
like I was missed because in my mind
the whole time it was like fuck them.

2297
02:16:17,891 --> 02:16:20,110
They were the enemy,
they don't care about me.

2298
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:23,320
And then I came in the house and I was
expecting to get another beating and

2299
02:16:23,321 --> 02:16:28,150
instead she just like very cold. He was
like, go to your room. And I was like,

2300
02:16:28,900 --> 02:16:30,060
how you think this fucking thanks.

2301
02:16:30,060 --> 02:16:34,000
Started before
ladder again.

2302
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:39,700
Very good climate. See my stroll
routine again. I gave it a shot. Right.

2303
02:16:39,790 --> 02:16:43,330
Get 'em done.
Probably 14

2304
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:48,750
there's a lot of people who've left, ran
away from home around that age. Yeah.

2305
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:51,750
That's the age, right? Between 14 and 17

2306
02:16:52,490 --> 02:16:56,360
yeah. My kids 14 now I'm
riding it real, real gentle,

2307
02:16:56,390 --> 02:16:59,400
little loose on the reins.
Give him some space. Yeah.

2308
02:16:59,430 --> 02:17:01,700
You can't just tough though
to then pull it with you.

2309
02:17:02,060 --> 02:17:05,960
CanNot the be upset with you? No,
I'm trying to stay, first of all,

2310
02:17:06,350 --> 02:17:09,680
it's a very existential thing that
my son is bigger than me. He's a,

2311
02:17:09,681 --> 02:17:13,160
he's an athlete. He's in better
shape. He's stronger. He's bigger.

2312
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:18,230
So you can kick your ass. No, he
can't kick my ass now. You sure? No.

2313
02:17:18,290 --> 02:17:22,250
What if he learns he's a black
belt in taekwondo? I told you that.

2314
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:24,110
How come you don't think
you can kick your ass?

2315
02:17:24,620 --> 02:17:26,690
Because I think you're
intimidated by your dad.

2316
02:17:27,110 --> 02:17:29,300
I don't think that you can
let yourself beat up your dad.

2317
02:17:29,301 --> 02:17:31,220
That's my only weapon right now.

2318
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:37,870
I can fuck my dad up. Yeah,
but back then too. Yeah. Yeah.

2319
02:17:39,300 --> 02:17:39,571
Yeah.

2320
02:17:39,571 --> 02:17:44,571
When I was does that my fucking car
find out I had a problem with it before.

2321
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:49,860
Yeah. So how come you never
did? I didn't want to,

2322
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:55,230
but I'm, I wasn't really
physically threatened. Right.
You know, checking shit.

2323
02:17:55,830 --> 02:17:56,430
My,
uh,

2324
02:17:56,430 --> 02:18:00,300
my car went off out here for like an hour
and one night I didn't know it was my

2325
02:18:00,301 --> 02:18:04,560
car. Who's fucking cars going off like
that? Somebody had hit me. Oh fuck.

2326
02:18:04,561 --> 02:18:05,940
Really Dude.

2327
02:18:05,941 --> 02:18:09,090
When you have a parking lot with a
bunch of people out in the parking lot,

2328
02:18:09,091 --> 02:18:10,050
they're always bumping into,

2329
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:15,200
people are half paying attention and
they're texting, they're parking,

2330
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:18,150
doing a really shitty job of
it pulling out. Like I just,

2331
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:20,720
I saw somebody hit somebody the other day,
um,

2332
02:18:21,180 --> 02:18:25,050
with one of these big ass Ford
pickup trucks, big long bed

2333
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:29,770
pickup, chug and axles
just backs up. Come on.

2334
02:18:30,350 --> 02:18:32,360
Well, I mean, I don't
know where this guy lived,

2335
02:18:32,810 --> 02:18:34,820
but I remember watching
him back up going to,

2336
02:18:34,821 --> 02:18:38,030
you know how to drive that
fuck dog fucking dummy.

2337
02:18:39,060 --> 02:18:43,490
He just got way too good in that is a
big ass metal bumper and fucked up some

2338
02:18:43,491 --> 02:18:44,324
guys light.

2339
02:18:45,060 --> 02:18:49,680
Now I'm not a racist or
homophobic. Yeah, I am, but not,

2340
02:18:50,070 --> 02:18:51,420
I wouldn't call myself that,

2341
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:54,900
but I got a problem with people in
cities that drive pickup trucks.

2342
02:18:54,901 --> 02:18:57,600
I find them as a people to be bad people.

2343
02:18:58,110 --> 02:19:02,940
I find them to be closed minded and a
overly aggressive shook night ran over

2344
02:19:02,941 --> 02:19:06,840
this people in a pickup truck. It's
all right. He was in a raptor Waze,

2345
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:09,810
forward raptors and even a
good one. Right. How it is

2346
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:11,750
probably the best one. Oh no shit. Yeah.

2347
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:15,460
It's a pickup truck with like
a real off road suspension.

2348
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:18,580
Like you could drive the people
take those things out into the

2349
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:22,730
sure they do. Yes. 14 people do.

2350
02:19:22,731 --> 02:19:26,840
Most people buy them and they never
leave the fucking pavement. That's,

2351
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:32,330
but if you wanted to, those things
have a main road capabilities.

2352
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:36,980
My neighbor has one. Well I think
about, Oh holy shit. That's the new one.

2353
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:42,000
That's bad ass. Oh, there are
beasts. I want it's got that
plate in the front. Yeah,

2354
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:46,850
yeah, yeah. It's a called again
with plate called splash guard.

2355
02:19:47,070 --> 02:19:49,460
I think it is.
But the thing is,

2356
02:19:49,461 --> 02:19:53,390
when I think about the apocalypse or
some type of gas attack that hits La,

2357
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:56,660
one of those is these, well because
the roads are all going to be closed.

2358
02:19:56,661 --> 02:19:58,160
And when I was a kid,
we used to ride,

2359
02:19:58,161 --> 02:20:00,980
we serve ride motorcycles
underneath there were power lines.

2360
02:20:00,981 --> 02:20:04,360
It ran from New York City all the
way straight, straight up state.

2361
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:08,450
And at any given point you
could get underneath those
power lines cause they had

2362
02:20:08,451 --> 02:20:11,360
a service road because they got a service,
the power lines.

2363
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:15,500
So there's always a dirt path and it's
the greatest for motorcycle riding.

2364
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:17,720
But I'm sure there's the same thing in La.

2365
02:20:17,721 --> 02:20:20,560
There's gotta be a way out
underneath those power lines. So if,

2366
02:20:20,561 --> 02:20:23,690
if the four or five is going
to be shutdown, 10 shutdown,

2367
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:27,470
the only way out is going to be in a
truck like that. On a road like that,

2368
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:32,660
there's gotta be ways that you could get
up to San Francisco without driving a

2369
02:20:32,661 --> 02:20:37,070
road. But I can't imagine them. Hmm. How
could you need some wire cutters? Will,

2370
02:20:37,071 --> 02:20:39,380
you'd have to go through,
you have definitely have wire cutters,

2371
02:20:39,430 --> 02:20:42,130
but you'd also have to go through
something. Some mountains and shit. Yeah,

2372
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:44,210
like you're not going to get through
mountains and that thing right.

2373
02:20:44,390 --> 02:20:47,150
Then you would need one of those
even you wouldn't be able to do that.

2374
02:20:47,151 --> 02:20:50,690
I was thinking you need like one of
those jeeps that you can crawl with and

2375
02:20:50,691 --> 02:20:54,240
they'll rock crawling. You ever see people
do that shit? Right, but what about the,

2376
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:57,590
what about that path that, what's her
name took in wild Reese Witherspoon.

2377
02:20:58,430 --> 02:20:59,330
I think that's real.

2378
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:07,700
That's like saying the titanic
movie. Do you see that? Yeah.

2379
02:21:07,701 --> 02:21:12,130
That's not a sound real. Those,
those fake, the, she never,

2380
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:16,100
all actors are all actors and actresses
and she walk. Yeah, but what do you think?

2381
02:21:16,101 --> 02:21:20,000
You can't take the truck or somebody
can walk. No, you can't. Oh yeah.

2382
02:21:20,001 --> 02:21:22,930
She jumped through some river beds.
Get through those trees, right truck.

2383
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:26,180
Stop down all the trees and make an
obvious path and then to follow you.

2384
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:29,060
Maybe you need a motorcycle.
I won't even work.

2385
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:33,230
You couldn't dig a motorcycle through the
mountains now? No. You'd get to the top,

2386
02:21:33,231 --> 02:21:36,370
it fall, landed on you break your leg,
you die up there wolves and eat, you know,

2387
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:37,940
fuck man,
that's no way to go.

2388
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:41,570
I'll take the gas attack
back in La based their Sushi.

2389
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:46,250
It's hard to figure out whether you would
want to die instantly in apocalypse or

2390
02:21:46,251 --> 02:21:50,150
whether you'd want to be the next
group of survivors that eventually five

2391
02:21:50,151 --> 02:21:54,000
generations later became the new
civilization because the first couple of

2392
02:21:54,070 --> 02:21:58,040
civilization it's going to be fucking
Genghis Khan Times. It'll be mad max.

2393
02:21:58,070 --> 02:22:02,210
It'll be, yeah, it'll be the worst,
the worst aspects of the walking dead.

2394
02:22:02,330 --> 02:22:05,390
They will be only raped.
There will be no consensual sex.

2395
02:22:05,510 --> 02:22:09,100
It's going to be like it is in certain
parts of like the Congo. Right, right.

2396
02:22:09,101 --> 02:22:11,600
You know places right now that
are really remote and fucked up.

2397
02:22:11,810 --> 02:22:15,470
That's why the whole world would
be like, yeah, and but there,

2398
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:18,260
there might be some fun to
surviving and then dying,

2399
02:22:18,290 --> 02:22:21,920
like being a part of the wave of people
that are staggering around with their

2400
02:22:21,921 --> 02:22:26,040
eyes burning, but like you're one of
the ones that that is healthy compared

2401
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,873
to them.
For a while.

2402
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:31,560
So you kind of feel like there's this
ultimate reality show happening and you're

2403
02:22:31,561 --> 02:22:31,660
right.

2404
02:22:31,660 --> 02:22:35,890
You're one of the finalists here.
One of them. You are the survivor.

2405
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:38,860
Congratulations, Greg. The
rest of the world is dead.

2406
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:40,640
He had all the fish and coconut,

2407
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:45,280
and just as you're rounding up all
the coconuts, all of a sudden you go,

2408
02:22:47,420 --> 02:22:48,253
no,

2409
02:22:49,570 --> 02:22:52,870
there's to Jay, you settled a
slightly better immune system.

2410
02:22:52,871 --> 02:22:56,550
You lasted a few extra days,
but I got the go, go nuts.

2411
02:22:57,040 --> 02:23:01,870
It's why that show last was always so
intriguing because everybody wondered

2412
02:23:01,871 --> 02:23:06,370
like, what would you do if you were
removed from the rest of civilization?

2413
02:23:06,371 --> 02:23:09,250
How would you survive?
What would life be like?

2414
02:23:09,990 --> 02:23:12,180
I know when they kind of nailed
it because they humanized it.

2415
02:23:12,181 --> 02:23:14,070
They didn't make every like
planet of the apes and all that.

2416
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:16,020
Everybody's very stoic
and they've got the same,

2417
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:19,080
that was a bunch of real
people reacting in real ways.

2418
02:23:19,190 --> 02:23:22,310
Yeah. Some more weeks I'm
were strong Samad character,

2419
02:23:22,490 --> 02:23:26,480
the fat Guy Somehow to
rise to the occasion. Yeah.

2420
02:23:26,930 --> 02:23:31,910
Some gave their life and sacrifice.
Some became leaders automatically. Yeah.

2421
02:23:32,870 --> 02:23:33,703
Yeah. That was, uh,

2422
02:23:33,970 --> 02:23:38,970
in a lot of ways it explored like one of
the main thoughts that people have when

2423
02:23:41,001 --> 02:23:45,950
they look at the, the, the fragile nature
of society. Like if it falls apart,

2424
02:23:45,951 --> 02:23:49,280
how would I do what would happen?
What would it be like? Yeah.

2425
02:23:49,310 --> 02:23:52,700
And that's what a show like that
covers Gilligan's island, you know,

2426
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:57,870
although no one fucked ginger or Maryanne,
there's no,

2427
02:23:57,890 --> 02:23:59,420
no one fucked at all.

2428
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:02,750
If you want to talk about like one of
the most unrealistic shows of all time

2429
02:24:03,050 --> 02:24:05,600
Gilligan's island had to be
because there was no sex,

2430
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:07,031
there was no sex,

2431
02:24:07,031 --> 02:24:10,030
and yet how old are their basic human
needs are pretty well met because the

2432
02:24:10,031 --> 02:24:14,470
professor built these kick ass huts,
anal lagoons, stuffed with fish.

2433
02:24:14,980 --> 02:24:17,200
It was like they were in Eden,
so they had plenty.

2434
02:24:17,201 --> 02:24:20,620
It's not like they didn't have time to
hit on ginger. No. Make her a fucking,

2435
02:24:20,621 --> 02:24:22,450
make her a necklace out of some coral

2436
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:26,890
and they were always trying to leave
and go back to civilization that all the

2437
02:24:26,891 --> 02:24:30,600
people in civilization would
watch that show going, dude,
you're in paradise. Yeah,

2438
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:34,060
you're this girl. Can't do any better
than you cause there's no one else. Right.

2439
02:24:34,270 --> 02:24:38,980
You're trapped with like the hottest
woman on the world. The movie star,

2440
02:24:39,190 --> 02:24:43,750
the professor and Marianne.
Hey Ron Galella again.

2441
02:24:45,550 --> 02:24:48,880
And the pride for professor was in a bad
looking dude with a handsome bastards

2442
02:24:49,130 --> 02:24:52,060
hush up with either one of those
little cow fucking she wasn't.

2443
02:24:52,061 --> 02:24:56,260
She was an animal. Good Lord. God.

2444
02:24:56,261 --> 02:25:00,730
Look how fucked hot shit. Damn. She
wears skimpy outfits too, didn't she?

2445
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:01,870
Of course she did.

2446
02:25:02,230 --> 02:25:06,340
I love how they pretended she had
like Cheetah skin outfits on. Yeah.

2447
02:25:06,370 --> 02:25:09,490
Where are you killing the Cheetah?
Did you skin that?

2448
02:25:09,491 --> 02:25:13,900
Cido like how the fuck did you make that
day? Really Escalate Marianne now too.

2449
02:25:13,901 --> 02:25:18,280
But they kept her who? She
was at hot Gotti. Fuck, I
thought Marianne was hot. Er.

2450
02:25:18,670 --> 02:25:22,240
I agree. She's more my tech.
Yeah, I mean the, the ginger.

2451
02:25:22,241 --> 02:25:23,920
She just seemed like she a lot of work.

2452
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:28,450
Look how hot Marianne is to say
that Maryann was not the hot one.

2453
02:25:28,480 --> 02:25:33,280
What the fuck man? Yeah.
Really. How's that Pos Marianne
is hot as fuck dude. Yeah,

2454
02:25:33,281 --> 02:25:37,240
she is. She just slightly different.
Just ginger's trying too hard, right.

2455
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:38,770
Marianne's got a straw hat on

2456
02:25:39,470 --> 02:25:42,770
Marianne is she's the girl in
the barn given out hand job.

2457
02:25:43,110 --> 02:25:47,800
No, no, no. You're Mary or
Bro. What the, yeah, no,

2458
02:25:47,850 --> 02:25:49,080
you're married Mrs Howl.

2459
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:53,540
Yeah.

2460
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:57,430
You got to bring her a lot of jewelry,
but you married her look. Oh, look at the,

2461
02:25:57,440 --> 02:26:00,670
you look at Maryanne's body in that house.
Holy Shit.

2462
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:03,770
She had that seventies body
to a little wider in the hips.

2463
02:26:04,230 --> 02:26:05,780
Little thick at the top of the leg,

2464
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:10,010
but the flat ass Peli with
the recess belly button.

2465
02:26:10,070 --> 02:26:12,320
Oh my God.
And he shouts of the feet Kyla.

2466
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:19,120
That old school foot fetish.

2467
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:23,980
How long they weren't high
heeled shoes on a rowboat. Wow.

2468
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:28,150
What a weird, weird, weird show. Yeah.

2469
02:26:28,570 --> 02:26:31,900
What did your dynamic as
far as only three women,

2470
02:26:32,710 --> 02:26:37,270
three women and two of them were
young and stupid. Hot with no suitors,

2471
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:38,890
no obvious suitor.

2472
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:43,960
There wasn't like a football player
that was also on this three hour tour.

2473
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:45,520
Who crashed there with them?

2474
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:50,610
Some big brawny Dick slinging
savage from the Iowa corn fields

2475
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:56,260
doing dead lifts with palm trees and Shit.
Trying to stay fit on the island.

2476
02:26:56,261 --> 02:27:01,180
No and no, there's no one, there was
Gilligan who's ambiguously sexual. Yeah.

2477
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:04,420
Like you didn't know he was a boy child.
He might've been gay.

2478
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:08,020
He did no masturbation.
His shirt was always clean.

2479
02:27:08,021 --> 02:27:11,640
It was red and always like
absolutely squeaky clean. Yeah.

2480
02:27:11,830 --> 02:27:13,690
And he always had that stupid hat on.

2481
02:27:13,691 --> 02:27:17,830
And then there was the professor and then
there was the skipper who is this slob

2482
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:22,690
who just stayed fat despite the fact that,
you know, there's no, there's no pasta,

2483
02:27:22,790 --> 02:27:25,850
there's no bread up there. Where was he
getting all the sugar from? Anywhere.

2484
02:27:25,890 --> 02:27:26,790
Ever lost any weight.

2485
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:30,830
That's incredible that he could keep the
weight on because they also had to be

2486
02:27:30,831 --> 02:27:33,980
rounding shit up.
They had to be active just to survive.

2487
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:36,550
They all had tailored clothes.
Look at the professors. Sure.

2488
02:27:36,570 --> 02:27:38,510
[inaudible] was a j crew catalog.

2489
02:27:38,630 --> 02:27:42,230
His shirt never showed any
sign whatsoever of fatigue.

2490
02:27:42,470 --> 02:27:45,660
Like he's out there with one fucking
shirt in the middle of the jungle. Yeah,

2491
02:27:45,710 --> 02:27:46,880
it looks amazing.
Right?

2492
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:51,590
You like the greatest shirt advertisement
of all time iron. It's iron as fuck.

2493
02:27:51,690 --> 02:27:55,040
Look at recipe, the chorus and
look at the, look at skipper.

2494
02:27:55,130 --> 02:27:56,550
He's get that stupid hat on.
Yeah,

2495
02:27:56,710 --> 02:27:59,150
and makes sure he wears a skipper
hack so everybody knows his rank

2496
02:27:59,860 --> 02:28:04,010
and that's the crazy thing. And Mr.
Howell, who, who has, he's got milk,

2497
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:05,660
he's a millionaire.
Which by the way,

2498
02:28:06,110 --> 02:28:08,510
think back to that actually
meant something back then,

2499
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:13,660
having $1 million meant you had trunks
and trunks of clothes and jewelry and and

2500
02:28:14,471 --> 02:28:18,200
he basically did nothing. He never did
any lifting. He never did any work. You,

2501
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:22,280
I wouldn't be like, motherfucker,
money doesn't mean anything.
This island anymore.

2502
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:25,790
Go rake up the beach. You got to
wonder how did he get that money?

2503
02:28:25,850 --> 02:28:30,830
Did he win the lottery? Was he given
that money? Family, it's family money.

2504
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:35,570
Who was the black and white Gal in the
middle there? Right there. Who's that?

2505
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:40,850
That's Tina Louise.
Like how's that possible?

2506
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:45,150
Wow,
this is what she looks like now.

2507
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:50,190
Whoa. Why did that sound happen at the
exact same time he clicked on that.

2508
02:28:50,730 --> 02:28:54,720
How rude. Go to view image. Blow that
bitch up. This is what she looks like now.

2509
02:28:54,750 --> 02:28:59,160
Well, she's gotta be like
quite old now, right?

2510
02:28:59,370 --> 02:29:02,370
Oh. Time. You Bitch.

2511
02:29:04,620 --> 02:29:06,330
You Bitch.
How dare you?

2512
02:29:06,331 --> 02:29:10,280
2015 they get the Ted style.
Go,

2513
02:29:10,281 --> 02:29:11,850
go big on that view image.

2514
02:29:15,910 --> 02:29:20,380
Age restricted. Whoa. Oh,
that is a goddamn shame.

2515
02:29:20,410 --> 02:29:25,150
Time is a ruthless motherfucker. It's
not like she avoided the knife either.

2516
02:29:25,750 --> 02:29:30,040
I hope they made the money. So sometimes
you find out. No, they did. They did not.

2517
02:29:30,190 --> 02:29:32,320
They did not.
That was a long time ago.

2518
02:29:32,830 --> 02:29:36,490
Probably signing pictures at
conventions and shit. Wow.

2519
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:39,520
Because none of them worked again.
Poor guy.

2520
02:29:39,580 --> 02:29:44,290
I don't remember seeing any of them
in anything else. No. I'm Gilligan.

2521
02:29:44,770 --> 02:29:48,550
He would do like these, uh,
I would love both shins.

2522
02:29:48,790 --> 02:29:50,380
When we would do these fan experiences.

2523
02:29:50,381 --> 02:29:52,480
They'd paid to take photos
with them and she had a family.

2524
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:53,800
But I don't know if he did that.

2525
02:29:53,801 --> 02:29:58,330
But a lot of like a lot of stars wound up
doing that. They do autograph signings.

2526
02:29:58,390 --> 02:30:02,050
They get, what's the range
of conversations you have
at that here? You'd be,

2527
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:04,540
you'd be Gilligan.
I'll be a fan that's coming up.

2528
02:30:04,540 --> 02:30:08,380
People in the line and then like
every conversation is rushed, right?

2529
02:30:08,410 --> 02:30:11,830
Because there's a bunch of people behind
you. Yeah. Hey, I love you as Gilligan.

2530
02:30:11,870 --> 02:30:14,860
Thank you. Thank you. Move
along please. Was there,

2531
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:19,790
did you guys really go to
an island for that? Um, I'm
sorry sir. If you want to, uh,

2532
02:30:19,930 --> 02:30:24,140
answer questions across more.
And what about afterwards?
You Ginger, Marianne hire.

2533
02:30:24,170 --> 02:30:27,940
Just one more thing. We just
do. You can't say that. Why not?

2534
02:30:28,450 --> 02:30:32,710
Because we're at a signing. He just
broke my Maryanne. Maryanne, thank you.

2535
02:30:34,390 --> 02:30:37,030
Here's $20 for the bad conversation.

2536
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:42,990
Hasn't had that same conversation over
and over and over for five hours a day.

2537
02:30:43,391 --> 02:30:45,010
And that's the only way
you can pay your rent.

2538
02:30:45,190 --> 02:30:48,430
But isn't that better than working at
like a Shitty job? Malleable. Mine,

2539
02:30:48,520 --> 02:30:52,300
definitely. So it's just, it
just sucks in perspective.

2540
02:30:52,360 --> 02:30:55,320
Like if you just saw what she looked like,
look, yeah, that's a lady in her seven.

2541
02:30:55,360 --> 02:30:56,140
Right?

2542
02:30:56,140 --> 02:30:59,380
But if you saw what she looked like when
she was in her twenties and then saw

2543
02:30:59,381 --> 02:31:01,510
what she looked like in her seventies,
that's when it hurts her feelings.

2544
02:31:01,570 --> 02:31:06,160
It's tough on women because with Mel, how
she still hot, she said it looks good.

2545
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:09,160
She looks good. Marianne was dawn. Well,

2546
02:31:09,430 --> 02:31:14,110
Marianne was clearly the one cause she's
still very pretty at 74 years old. Yep.

2547
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:17,650
Yeah. Yeah. Tina the was a
lot of makeup and fashion.

2548
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:22,020
Riyadh was just pure.
There's your answer. Yeah.

2549
02:31:22,620 --> 02:31:26,760
Boy. See, let's see a picture
of, um, Killigan today.

2550
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:30,600
Much more forgiving.
I bet you think so.

2551
02:31:32,170 --> 02:31:34,120
Gilligan from Gilligan's island now.

2552
02:31:34,990 --> 02:31:35,600
Okay.

2553
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:40,210
It was still kept it. The professor
looks up top. Do you have a duty still?

2554
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:43,530
This other professor was like, Michael
Kanban is about a hundred years old.

2555
02:31:43,560 --> 02:31:48,420
Who's that? Who's that
guy ran the pressures.

2556
02:31:48,510 --> 02:31:52,110
No, fuck. Yes it is. Oh my God.

2557
02:31:52,111 --> 02:31:56,610
He lost all the weight except the nose
didn't lose the way every other part of

2558
02:31:56,611 --> 02:32:00,870
him did. Is that a real wow,
that's interesting, man.

2559
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:01,711
Yeah.

2560
02:32:01,711 --> 02:32:05,850
It's interesting when someone would get
on a show like that and p a huge star,

2561
02:32:05,851 --> 02:32:10,530
like I dream of Jeannie.
Yeah. Remember that?

2562
02:32:10,740 --> 02:32:15,210
What a piece of ass she was hot as fuck.
But she would go from that,

2563
02:32:15,450 --> 02:32:19,530
from that and like not do
much after that. Right, right.

2564
02:32:19,531 --> 02:32:23,280
And the guy who played her
boyfriend on it, didn't they?

2565
02:32:23,281 --> 02:32:27,980
Sweary Hagman they swapped them out.
Did they? Yeah. Larry Hagman. No,

2566
02:32:27,981 --> 02:32:30,700
they had a different one. Was it?
I dream of Jeannie are bewitched.

2567
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:35,520
I'm being way with two different guys.
Yeah, they were just crazy. Yeah.

2568
02:32:35,521 --> 02:32:39,150
There were a couple shows that swapped
the guy out, the main guy. Right.

2569
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:41,490
And be wished they swapped.
The main guy,

2570
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:45,370
somebody held up on his contract and
they went, really? I'll see Adrian Chang,

2571
02:32:45,380 --> 02:32:48,030
you pal. Larry Hagman one. I'll
do a lot of shit. Hell yeah.

2572
02:32:48,090 --> 02:32:50,190
He did a million different things.
So that's not a good example.

2573
02:32:50,191 --> 02:32:55,170
But I was thinking of troop actually
a few. Richard Dawson went on.

2574
02:32:55,220 --> 02:32:58,170
Yeah. Oh, F troop. A lot of those
guys, we, a lot of those guys went on.

2575
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:01,230
I was confusing bewitched
with a juror and Jeanie. Yeah,

2576
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:06,000
but they were both super hot
women. Oh my God. To be which lady?

2577
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:09,870
What is the name? Tabitha Stevens.
Is that what it was? Bewitched.

2578
02:33:10,290 --> 02:33:14,730
That's also the name of a porn star. Yeah,
I think tabulated Weinstein. He wished,

2579
02:33:17,390 --> 02:33:21,560
what was her name? Yeah, that's right.

2580
02:33:21,561 --> 02:33:25,160
She was a really hot when she was hot
as shit. Oh, there's another picture.

2581
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:29,870
I just love that you could go in and
pitch a g is a genie that this dude locks

2582
02:33:29,871 --> 02:33:32,900
in a bottle, but B, which was a witch,

2583
02:33:32,930 --> 02:33:35,870
she would do that thing where there
are no [inaudible]. Right, right.

2584
02:33:35,990 --> 02:33:38,780
Remember she would do things with their
nose and then she's doing really nice,

2585
02:33:38,781 --> 02:33:41,750
which, and she could do anything,
but he wouldn't let her.

2586
02:33:41,780 --> 02:33:45,050
It was a total fucking
male chauvinist pig shell.

2587
02:33:45,051 --> 02:33:49,550
It was all about a woman's ability to do
things and a man holding her back and I

2588
02:33:49,551 --> 02:33:53,000
dream of Jeannie was the same
thing. Yeah. He wouldn't let her,

2589
02:33:53,030 --> 02:33:55,640
he locked her up layer.
Do reach your powers.

2590
02:33:55,790 --> 02:33:59,690
I wonder which one stole the
money or stole the idea from who?

2591
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:04,490
Because it's kind of the same story
in a way. Yeah. Very archetype.

2592
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:09,150
Archetypal. Right. The typical
right. Archetypical was story.

2593
02:34:09,151 --> 02:34:11,930
His story is very similar. Yeah, but wait,
go back to that picture for a second.

2594
02:34:11,931 --> 02:34:13,610
Controlling man, look at, look at him.

2595
02:34:13,611 --> 02:34:18,611
He's got his hand over her mouth and he's
pointing at her face in an aggressive,

2596
02:34:18,731 --> 02:34:20,350
abusive way,
and she looks scared.

2597
02:34:20,351 --> 02:34:23,090
And that was on a sitcom
before that's fucked up you,

2598
02:34:23,100 --> 02:34:27,100
while she could turn him into a fucking
broom, right? She'd do whatever she wants.

2599
02:34:27,430 --> 02:34:32,050
Turn his dick into Jello. But she
loved him. He knew, he knew. She met,

2600
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:34,680
no matter they were assholes.
He was an asshole.

2601
02:34:34,690 --> 02:34:38,500
And Larry Hagman was such a Douche on
that show. All you could think was like,

2602
02:34:38,590 --> 02:34:42,580
dude, why don't you just get a nice bed
and breakfast with this bitch up in Santa

2603
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:46,210
Barbara? She said, go into the greatest
pussy of all time. Go fuck the gene. You,

2604
02:34:46,211 --> 02:34:48,060
what's wrong with you,
dude? Enjoy the Hamsini,

2605
02:34:48,460 --> 02:34:52,000
the bottomless bucket of blow job that
she's going to offer you and magic.

2606
02:34:53,260 --> 02:34:56,530
She loves you. And she loved him
and he wasn't interested. Nope.

2607
02:34:56,560 --> 02:35:00,040
She lived in a bottle.
Fucking speciesist asshole.

2608
02:35:03,150 --> 02:35:06,820
Which one was the original
Darren? Oh my God. Wait a minute.

2609
02:35:06,821 --> 02:35:10,600
There's two different ones. Okay. That's
the difference between bewitched and I.

2610
02:35:10,601 --> 02:35:13,900
Dream of Jeannie. They're both
Hondas. Janie was beyond hot.

2611
02:35:13,901 --> 02:35:17,680
She was in hottest fall. I
know, but Jeanie was crazy hot.

2612
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:22,450
If there's any upper left
hand corner, you're right.
Look at that right there. Bam.

2613
02:35:22,480 --> 02:35:27,360
There's your answer right there. Yeah.
Barbara Eden was just stunning. Yeah,

2614
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:32,870
they're both hot as fuck. What are you
talking about? Either one of them B,

2615
02:35:32,920 --> 02:35:37,240
which was pretty, she's a 10 Jeannie
was just a fucking splurge monkey.

2616
02:35:37,241 --> 02:35:41,670
She was looking at her with that outfit
to look at that belly of the top man.

2617
02:35:42,030 --> 02:35:46,670
Yeah. Oh, you could kid. You look
at that. Oh, didn't like the face.

2618
02:35:47,980 --> 02:35:51,730
Yeah, the old as fuck. But look at
her body man. Once she got older,

2619
02:35:51,760 --> 02:35:55,240
body was tremendous.
That's nice. Look at her.

2620
02:35:56,650 --> 02:35:58,480
What are you going to do?
You get them.

2621
02:35:58,540 --> 02:36:00,730
You get to marry a woman
that stays in shape.

2622
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:05,650
That's what they make shows
like this anymore. Why do
you think that is? You know,

2623
02:36:05,651 --> 02:36:10,180
they did third rock from the sun and that
had a nice big run and then a fantasy

2624
02:36:10,181 --> 02:36:13,360
sitcoms kind of went
array array after that.

2625
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:16,660
Is it a rare rye?
I always fucked that up.

2626
02:36:17,170 --> 02:36:19,330
I meant away and I fucked up I that array.

2627
02:36:19,430 --> 02:36:22,810
So then you saved me by saying
awry like niche or niche,

2628
02:36:22,990 --> 02:36:26,470
I guess you could say both. Yeah.
Someone said you're not saying it right.

2629
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:27,850
And then I said you sure?

2630
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,610
And then I looked it up and you
apparently you could say both ways,

2631
02:36:31,060 --> 02:36:35,170
niche or niche, right? So there
is no like, is that correct?

2632
02:36:35,350 --> 02:36:37,360
I don't think there's a correct way.
Right.

2633
02:36:38,460 --> 02:36:42,370
You're neesh neesh sounds better though.
Sounds like you're sophisticated.

2634
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:47,980
They're sort of Porsche, Porsche, Porsche
cars. I own one. I have to say it right.

2635
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:51,490
Oh, you can all, you should only be able
to say that way if you have one. Yeah.

2636
02:36:51,491 --> 02:36:55,510
Well No, you should say correctly no
matter what. But my friend Maurice Smith,

2637
02:36:55,540 --> 02:36:58,560
he was the one, the first one to correct
me. I go, yeah, that's a nice poor.

2638
02:36:58,561 --> 02:37:02,710
She was a Porsche Porsche. Say
Porsche. That's what it's called. Okay.

2639
02:37:02,980 --> 02:37:06,520
It's like a white trash thing, you
know. What about Jaguar? Jaguar?

2640
02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:11,320
Is it Jaguar to say John, you all, well
it's not owned by England people anymore.

2641
02:37:11,321 --> 02:37:13,960
We say Jaguar or kind of a
cat. Is it? It's a Jaguar.

2642
02:37:14,350 --> 02:37:17,540
Is that of a cat on the bumper?
Yeah, but it's not jack. It's Jaguar.

2643
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:23,020
Hi. Some American say Jay. You are and it
really is Douche flag number one. Yeah,

2644
02:37:23,160 --> 02:37:26,040
you are. Yeah. The Jaguar in Afghanistan,

2645
02:37:27,510 --> 02:37:32,130
one might say Jaguar. Yeah.
Have you talked to county?
Literally almost just said,

2646
02:37:32,131 --> 02:37:37,050
I bet Calabasas Jaguar is so good
at pronouncing things correctly.

2647
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:38,250
Afghanistan,

2648
02:37:38,250 --> 02:37:42,410
but he grew up in a million different
countries all over the [inaudible].

2649
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:44,400
You are in Chile and Chile.

2650
02:37:44,490 --> 02:37:48,450
I actually say chilay cause I was there
once and it really is like ugly American

2651
02:37:48,451 --> 02:37:52,960
Chile. Chile. Yeah. It's really ugly
American here for Chile. Chile. Hey,

2652
02:37:52,970 --> 02:37:56,880
get a case of deer. Well there's certain
countries where we just named them.

2653
02:37:56,910 --> 02:37:59,850
We don't like your name. We call
you something different. Yeah,

2654
02:38:00,100 --> 02:38:04,770
I like to Deutschland. Germany. We
like Germany better. Yeah. Other Lens?

2655
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:09,750
Nope. Holland. Sorry. Yeah. What's the,
what's the really, there's one really, oh,

2656
02:38:09,960 --> 02:38:14,460
Japan. They don't call Japan. They
didn't, it was Ni Pong. Yeah. Yeah.

2657
02:38:15,060 --> 02:38:18,120
We call it Japan. Like you got your
own name now, bitch. We're like,

2658
02:38:18,300 --> 02:38:21,900
we're like the Ellis island of countries.
We tell you what your new name is.

2659
02:38:22,950 --> 02:38:26,940
These guys that escaped. What part of
the they're, they're an upstate New York.

2660
02:38:27,350 --> 02:38:29,640
And are they near the woods? Is
that, what would their near him?

2661
02:38:29,670 --> 02:38:32,970
This is a good time to do.
It's the northeast corner of New York,

2662
02:38:32,971 --> 02:38:36,030
so they're pretty near Canada. Oh.
So they're just going to go see,

2663
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:38,990
see the fucking note.
Have a nice day.

2664
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:42,420
Racist picture of a Chinese guy
with buck teeth and slanted eyes.

2665
02:38:42,421 --> 02:38:45,990
Do you think they're trying to say
that they're going to China? Ah,

2666
02:38:46,700 --> 02:38:50,580
it is an interesting choice and it looks
like the circle was made with like a

2667
02:38:50,581 --> 02:38:54,960
protractor. Those lines are dead
straight. That wasn't an afterthought.

2668
02:38:55,110 --> 02:38:59,790
Yeah. That's a beautiful line. That's
right. Yeah. The triangles perfect too.

2669
02:38:59,850 --> 02:39:01,890
Yeah.
That's weird.

2670
02:39:02,370 --> 02:39:06,330
Have a nice day and it looks like it's
held on with a magnet or something. Yup.

2671
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:10,080
That's exactly what is. Hold
on one. That's hilarious.

2672
02:39:11,540 --> 02:39:15,060
They are hilarious murderers who carved
into steel pipes and how the fuck did

2673
02:39:15,061 --> 02:39:17,070
they know where that steel pipe went to?

2674
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:22,280
Well, that's where there must have been
people on the inside security thing.

2675
02:39:22,300 --> 02:39:25,210
Again, if you think being
a fucking prisoner is bad,

2676
02:39:25,211 --> 02:39:27,850
being a guard they say
might even be worse.

2677
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:31,240
So now you're going to work every
day having shit thrown at you,

2678
02:39:31,241 --> 02:39:35,560
worried about being killed,
breaking up fights, total monotony,

2679
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:39,070
and then and then on top of it
so you get a chance to maybe,

2680
02:39:39,250 --> 02:39:43,330
maybe these guys are siphoning money to
you from some relatives on the outside

2681
02:39:43,331 --> 02:39:46,750
or a gang on the outside and all of
a sudden you've got an extra 20 grand

2682
02:39:46,751 --> 02:39:50,740
because you got the schematics of the
pipes from the office when the boss wasn't

2683
02:39:50,741 --> 02:39:52,030
looking.
You're going to do it.

2684
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:54,690
Look at this fucking what
they were in jail for.

2685
02:39:55,290 --> 02:39:59,280
Sweat was serving a life sentence for
shooting the sheriff's Deputy 15 times in

2686
02:39:59,281 --> 02:40:02,580
2002 Matt was in prison
for the kidnapping,

2687
02:40:02,581 --> 02:40:06,690
murder and dismemberment of a man
who had fired him from his job.

2688
02:40:06,691 --> 02:40:10,470
At a food warehouse. Well, I was a
food warehouse. That's a tough one.

2689
02:40:10,550 --> 02:40:12,990
It's a good gig. Get it.
You've got to protect.

2690
02:40:13,230 --> 02:40:15,990
You got to kill and
dismember for that one. Whoa.

2691
02:40:16,050 --> 02:40:19,200
So these are sick psychopathic dude's.
Yeah,

2692
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:23,010
his tattoos on his back and
say Mexico forever. Well,

2693
02:40:23,011 --> 02:40:25,260
I guess we know headed.

2694
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:31,980
It's a ruse though. That's the route
they went to Canada. Canada, forever.

2695
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:36,600
That's his, that's going to
be as new tattoo. Well, you
could live in Mexico. Um,

2696
02:40:36,601 --> 02:40:40,800
you're not going to survive in Canada
once it gets cold. You know, if you,

2697
02:40:40,810 --> 02:40:45,240
if you escape into the border and
you go deep, deep, deep into Mexico,

2698
02:40:45,241 --> 02:40:49,410
you might conceivably reach some place
where people never question who you are

2699
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:53,610
and you eat some existence as a
laborer or something like that.

2700
02:40:54,060 --> 02:40:58,170
And they're not on the same websites. If
the Canadians are on the lookout. I mean,

2701
02:40:58,171 --> 02:41:02,890
that whole, if you live within 500 miles
of that escape, you're on high alert. Oh,

2702
02:41:02,950 --> 02:41:06,330
and you're looking at the pictures and
if a couple of dudes wandered to town

2703
02:41:06,331 --> 02:41:11,070
that nobody knows it's over. Yeah. Yeah.
No doubt about it. No doubt about it.

2704
02:41:11,071 --> 02:41:14,190
And anybody that's in the
woods that lives out there,

2705
02:41:14,350 --> 02:41:18,960
you're going to be on high guard
watching out for your supplies. You know,

2706
02:41:18,990 --> 02:41:21,810
maybe having a gun when
you ask people out guns,

2707
02:41:22,900 --> 02:41:26,220
you kind of really worried about being
in Canada too because that's where people

2708
02:41:26,221 --> 02:41:28,320
try to go when they escape.
Yeah.

2709
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:31,440
You know like you're escaping
from literal imprisonment,

2710
02:41:31,441 --> 02:41:36,150
like someone locking you in a cage like
a rat and you get out of that cage just

2711
02:41:36,151 --> 02:41:40,260
as fucking, I've got to
make this work. I'm free.

2712
02:41:40,590 --> 02:41:43,170
And how much food do you have
and how much time do you have?

2713
02:41:43,171 --> 02:41:48,050
And how much of this plan have you
really set into motion? 50% of it.

2714
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:51,200
100% where's the girl? The
girl's not here. Fuck, she's

2715
02:41:55,470 --> 02:42:00,170
calm down. Once you realize, what are we
going to do? What are we going to be in?

2716
02:42:00,171 --> 02:42:03,390
A chubby person didn't get in her fucking
minivan and pick it up at the forest.

2717
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:07,440
Right? I'm going to rip the fucking
whiskers out of her chin. And then,

2718
02:42:07,740 --> 02:42:11,400
and then you got to know how much we
push forward and how much do we just stay

2719
02:42:11,401 --> 02:42:15,870
and hide. It's like a fine line,
right? It's like a chess match.

2720
02:42:15,871 --> 02:42:18,780
You got to make every right move.
You know what you do?

2721
02:42:19,140 --> 02:42:23,490
The guy who killed and dismembered the
probably kills the other guy and starts

2722
02:42:23,491 --> 02:42:25,520
eating them. Right? That's the move. Yeah,

2723
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:29,100
but like you could only keep them for a
few days. It's warm up there. Right now.

2724
02:42:29,910 --> 02:42:32,910
It's June. Now. That is one of the
worst times to try to keep meat.

2725
02:42:32,940 --> 02:42:35,610
Now you get two dinners in a branch
out of them. That's about it.

2726
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:38,760
You got to have to cut
away the rotten spots.

2727
02:42:38,810 --> 02:42:42,960
Get to carry a ham hock with you
and dig into it. Uh, when you're,

2728
02:42:43,360 --> 02:42:47,880
when you're on the first spot,
you eat the well on an animal.

2729
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:51,210
You'd take the Strip of meat
that protects the spine.

2730
02:42:51,210 --> 02:42:54,420
It's called the back strap
on each side of the spine.

2731
02:42:54,421 --> 02:42:58,260
There's a delicious slice of meat.
The loins,

2732
02:42:58,890 --> 02:43:02,880
the backstraps in the loins lines is
the ass. The loins is all the back.

2733
02:43:02,910 --> 02:43:04,800
It's all the inside,
like with lines,

2734
02:43:04,801 --> 02:43:09,510
the spine and then you go to
the hams as the back back legs.

2735
02:43:09,790 --> 02:43:14,720
Hmm. And then the shoulders,
organs, the organs.

2736
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:18,160
It depends on the animal. It probably
don't want to eat a bear liver,

2737
02:43:18,580 --> 02:43:21,760
but you can eat their heart. If he cooked
it well enough, eat a pig's heart. It,

2738
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:25,380
Cook it well enough and you have to cook
it to 160 degrees though. All right.

2739
02:43:25,870 --> 02:43:29,350
Different animals have different
diets and they have different diets.

2740
02:43:29,351 --> 02:43:34,030
They have different parasites. Some
animals like pigs, especially wild pigs,

2741
02:43:34,031 --> 02:43:35,350
bears and things along coastlines.

2742
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:39,010
Got to worry about tricking osis but
if you eat, eat, eat, eat a human,

2743
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:42,610
assuming you go for like the
buttocks first you could.

2744
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:46,600
That's what they did in that movie was
that movie with those guys crashed in the

2745
02:43:46,601 --> 02:43:51,520
Andes and froze and they had to eat each
other's. They the eight ass was alive.

2746
02:43:51,550 --> 02:43:52,630
Yeah.
They dug,

2747
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:57,580
dug out this guy to pass frozen ass
with a spoon as Nina because they were

2748
02:43:57,581 --> 02:44:02,350
desperado. Ooh, that's when she gets ugly.

2749
02:44:03,130 --> 02:44:06,910
That's when shit gets ugly. My
friend. The guys not in shape either.

2750
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:10,690
It's much easier to eat some flabby ass.
Yeah.

2751
02:44:10,691 --> 02:44:13,690
That's why I don't eat that up. Excuse
me. That's why I don't eat that.

2752
02:44:13,691 --> 02:44:17,500
Why goop beef? I feel like I'm eating
like the Chris Christie of cows.

2753
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:20,290
Just some sloppy fuck that's barely alive.

2754
02:44:21,730 --> 02:44:25,990
It's just like gelatinous
shitty cow of marbled up.

2755
02:44:26,140 --> 02:44:28,140
And some people love it though.
Ooh,

2756
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:32,050
I've heard people talk about that kind
of beef like it's the most delicious beef

2757
02:44:32,051 --> 02:44:35,290
they've ever had in their
life. Well that's what
[inaudible] is. It's a lazy cow,

2758
02:44:35,291 --> 02:44:37,780
right? You just string them
up and he doesn't move worse.

2759
02:44:37,900 --> 02:44:42,670
It's a baby too young. They
take a young calf and the, uh,

2760
02:44:42,700 --> 02:44:46,420
sometimes they just leave them in a pen,
a very small pen where they can't move.

2761
02:44:46,660 --> 02:44:51,250
Sometimes they feed him milk and sometimes
they actually bind them so that they

2762
02:44:51,430 --> 02:44:53,710
can't move. Well, is that that stuff,

2763
02:44:53,860 --> 02:44:58,390
why you beef from Japan Wagyu?
How you say it?

2764
02:44:58,670 --> 02:45:02,290
Why do you, will you set the stuff
that's super expensive? Oh yeah.

2765
02:45:02,350 --> 02:45:04,810
It's really expensive.
They feed them Saki and beer.

2766
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:08,050
That what you're looking at is
a dying animal. Essentially.

2767
02:45:08,340 --> 02:45:13,340
A cow is in no way or shape supposed
to have that amount of fat content.

2768
02:45:14,980 --> 02:45:17,530
It just is not.
It's not supposed to be built like that.

2769
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:20,110
It's supposed to be all red lean tissue.

2770
02:45:20,290 --> 02:45:25,290
Now compare that pull up grass fed beef
now completely pure grass fed beef is

2771
02:45:27,011 --> 02:45:31,450
how beef is supposed to look
and it's not nearly as lean,

2772
02:45:31,630 --> 02:45:35,570
like go to like a cut of meat. See
if they have any, that's just a,

2773
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:40,780
that's a Ribeye, which is a pretty
like, yeah, go to like a New York strip.

2774
02:45:41,050 --> 02:45:45,520
Like what you get is okay. The like
scroll down like right there, right there.

2775
02:45:45,521 --> 02:45:48,160
I click on that tenderloin, right. They're
not to the right. Yeah. There you go.

2776
02:45:48,460 --> 02:45:50,780
Look at that. That's what it's
supposed to look like. Right.

2777
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:53,440
With what you're seeing
there is a darker red,

2778
02:45:53,770 --> 02:45:57,610
very little fat content cause
blood flowed through there. Well,

2779
02:45:57,611 --> 02:46:00,730
the only reason why there's fat in those
animals because they're eating these

2780
02:46:01,330 --> 02:46:05,890
really extremely high crawl
at high calorie grains and
grains that their body is

2781
02:46:05,891 --> 02:46:09,860
not naturally designed to process. He,
I think Alfalfa is a big, they feed them

2782
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:14,110
Alfalfa's not bad because it's
just a plant, but the corn, um,

2783
02:46:14,170 --> 02:46:15,870
apparently that they're,
uh,

2784
02:46:15,940 --> 02:46:19,390
they're eating is what really
gets them nice and marbled. Yeah.

2785
02:46:19,420 --> 02:46:23,080
It's the corn that gets him going that,
that fig grain.

2786
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:25,700
I think Alfalfa is like more of, you
know, it's more of like a Veggie,

2787
02:46:25,730 --> 02:46:28,570
a more of like a regular
green plant. Right? Yeah.

2788
02:46:28,630 --> 02:46:30,640
It's not a starchier as thick as a

2789
02:46:30,970 --> 02:46:35,290
now it's so it's like a wheat grass.
Who the fuck he eats Alfalfa though.

2790
02:46:35,350 --> 02:46:39,070
You know what I mean? Like Alfalfa
sprouts. I like Alfalfa sprouts. I salad.

2791
02:46:39,640 --> 02:46:42,490
I wouldn't need it straight on, but thrown
it on a salad. It gives it like that,

2792
02:46:42,491 --> 02:46:46,840
uh, that Crisp Enos. Yeah. It's
got that weird texture, right?

2793
02:46:47,470 --> 02:46:49,150
Yeah. I love salad bars, man. It's, it's,

2794
02:46:49,151 --> 02:46:53,350
so you just said good salad bar where you
just throw on some iceberg and some of

2795
02:46:53,351 --> 02:46:58,330
those mini tiny, uh, corn
ears and some mushrooms. Those
are always pickled, right?

2796
02:46:58,450 --> 02:47:00,340
A kind of understand a little bit pickled.

2797
02:47:01,210 --> 02:47:05,800
And then you throw on shit like
cranberry juice and sunflower seeds.

2798
02:47:05,890 --> 02:47:09,760
Radishes, radishes. Fuck. Yeah, man.

2799
02:47:09,761 --> 02:47:11,410
And you have good radishes are for you.

2800
02:47:11,950 --> 02:47:15,760
I had a really good science
teacher in junior high.

2801
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:19,210
I went to a shitty junior high school
in Jamaica Plain Massachusetts.

2802
02:47:19,420 --> 02:47:23,050
It was not good at all. It was
a, it was real sketchy area.

2803
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:26,440
There was kids that were like 17 years
old that were in the seventh grade when I

2804
02:47:26,441 --> 02:47:30,100
was there. Like they were, you know, it
was a lot of fuck ups, a lot of idiots.

2805
02:47:30,570 --> 02:47:33,130
And I was there for seventh
and eighth grade. And um,

2806
02:47:33,730 --> 02:47:35,560
but I had a really good science teacher.

2807
02:47:36,010 --> 02:47:40,180
This guy was just a super dedicated
to being a science teacher.

2808
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:45,040
He was, um, just who would ask
you questions and he would,

2809
02:47:45,250 --> 02:47:49,180
he would make it. He was the first guy
that made me think about space. Uh,

2810
02:47:49,240 --> 02:47:52,420
but he had radishes and
he grew rashes in his, uh,

2811
02:47:52,630 --> 02:47:56,110
in his garden and he would bring them
in and we'd have radishes at lunch and

2812
02:47:56,111 --> 02:47:58,240
explained that when
you're eating a radish,

2813
02:47:58,660 --> 02:48:01,980
there's so few calories in it'll radish
that you can eat the entire radish,

2814
02:48:01,990 --> 02:48:06,990
the amount of calories it takes you to
process to chew and process and then

2815
02:48:07,061 --> 02:48:11,940
digest that radish is the same amount is
in the rafters, right? It's like, it's a,

2816
02:48:11,950 --> 02:48:16,150
it's a wash like you eat, if you want to
lose wages, eat radishes, like your, your,

2817
02:48:16,160 --> 02:48:17,290
your Bot. And it was like, whoa.

2818
02:48:17,291 --> 02:48:20,890
That doesn't even make sense that you
could eat a radish and the amount it takes

2819
02:48:20,891 --> 02:48:24,040
to process it made me think
about that. But he, um,

2820
02:48:24,370 --> 02:48:26,830
he also made me think about
space. He said, if you want to,

2821
02:48:26,860 --> 02:48:29,890
you want to really make your head hurt.
And this was, you know, seventh grade.

2822
02:48:29,891 --> 02:48:33,250
Like how old are you when you were
in seventh grade? Nine, 13, 13.

2823
02:48:33,251 --> 02:48:38,050
Something like that. Young.
Yeah. 12, 12. He said,

2824
02:48:38,260 --> 02:48:38,530
you,

2825
02:48:38,530 --> 02:48:43,530
you have to think about the
fact that space goes on forever.

2826
02:48:44,411 --> 02:48:47,800
There's no end to it. Like just if
that doesn't make your head hurt,

2827
02:48:47,801 --> 02:48:49,180
then you're not thinking
about it hard enough.

2828
02:48:49,320 --> 02:48:53,860
And I remember him saying that like that
space goes on forever and nobody had

2829
02:48:53,861 --> 02:48:56,470
ever said that to me before.
Like everybody was always do it.

2830
02:48:56,471 --> 02:48:58,140
We talk about space as big.
It's base,

2831
02:48:58,330 --> 02:49:02,380
the big bang happened x amount of billion
years ago and they say it in a way

2832
02:49:02,381 --> 02:49:06,520
that it's, it's very factual and
actual and it's all, you know,

2833
02:49:06,530 --> 02:49:09,930
you're recognized and
memorize that number,

2834
02:49:09,931 --> 02:49:14,190
13.9 billion or whatever the fuck it is.
But when someone says it doesn't end,

2835
02:49:14,430 --> 02:49:15,330
it never ends.

2836
02:49:15,480 --> 02:49:19,770
Like you just keep going and going
and going and going and going forever.

2837
02:49:20,040 --> 02:49:22,770
He's like, do you understand what
forever? It just keeps going.

2838
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:26,160
Like there's not a time when it runs
out of space. It just keeps going.

2839
02:49:26,400 --> 02:49:30,900
That's always my argument against
because I believe in some type of God and

2840
02:49:30,901 --> 02:49:34,380
that's always my argument to people that
absolutely negate any type of a higher

2841
02:49:34,381 --> 02:49:36,360
power is,
is infinity.

2842
02:49:36,630 --> 02:49:41,370
You explain to me even that fucking
glimmer hope of solving infinity to me.

2843
02:49:41,670 --> 02:49:43,560
And I'll give up the whole concept of God.

2844
02:49:43,910 --> 02:49:46,310
Why does,
why do they have to be mutually exclusive?

2845
02:49:46,640 --> 02:49:50,590
Why do you have to be able
to solve infinity? Like what,

2846
02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:55,880
what is it about infinity that
means to you that there's a god?

2847
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:57,720
Well,
cause it's a concept.

2848
02:49:58,300 --> 02:50:02,220
It's a concept and a
reality at the same time.

2849
02:50:02,400 --> 02:50:07,400
It's like the idea that there's a physical
thing that can't be quantified in any

2850
02:50:08,701 --> 02:50:13,701
way means that there has to be some kind
of a force that I wouldn't even call it

2851
02:50:14,701 --> 02:50:16,440
a force.
That there is a,

2852
02:50:17,430 --> 02:50:22,050
there's a paradigm that's
controlled and consistent

2853
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:25,470
and that that's what God is.
There's some,

2854
02:50:25,471 --> 02:50:27,600
there's some type of a
template to all of it.

2855
02:50:28,460 --> 02:50:30,620
I've thought about this a lot.
I'm sure you have to.

2856
02:50:30,920 --> 02:50:33,800
One of the things that I think about
what to think about the universe and like

2857
02:50:33,801 --> 02:50:36,390
the idea of the Big Bang and uh,
I've,

2858
02:50:36,391 --> 02:50:40,010
I've read since some
interesting quantum arguments.

2859
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:45,230
Some were really weird theories about
the birth and death of the universe.

2860
02:50:45,231 --> 02:50:46,730
But one of the big ones to me is like,

2861
02:50:46,731 --> 02:50:50,300
why does it have to have a birth
and a death? Why are we so,

2862
02:50:50,540 --> 02:50:54,890
it's why are we so convinced that
the universe had to have a beginning?

2863
02:50:55,460 --> 02:50:58,490
Like why could not it have
always been there? I mean,

2864
02:50:58,491 --> 02:51:01,100
isn't that an option too when you're
talking about something is absolutely

2865
02:51:01,101 --> 02:51:05,180
ridiculous as infinity? Why is it so
ridiculous that it's been here forever?

2866
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:07,640
Like why does it have to
have a beginning and an end?

2867
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:13,240
And that fucks with my own version of
reality and a lot of ways because my own

2868
02:51:14,121 --> 02:51:19,040
version of reality is birth and death
is what I'm experiencing. It's what,

2869
02:51:19,041 --> 02:51:19,661
uh,
you know,

2870
02:51:19,661 --> 02:51:24,230
like we have these biological limitations
and we impose those sometimes on other

2871
02:51:24,231 --> 02:51:26,310
things. That's what it is. Star,

2872
02:51:26,870 --> 02:51:30,140
the birth of the solar system
has only been alive for, oh, what

2873
02:51:30,620 --> 02:51:32,420
our lives are a narrative.
It's like,

2874
02:51:32,421 --> 02:51:35,780
you know how you'd say every script can
be broken down to a beginning, middle,

2875
02:51:35,781 --> 02:51:38,600
and an end. And the many of the
plot structures are similar.

2876
02:51:38,601 --> 02:51:43,460
Like that whole like Joseph Campbell
thing and uh, and you know, the whole,

2877
02:51:43,461 --> 02:51:48,461
that whole idea of beginning and an end
is so rooted in our lifetime that we

2878
02:51:48,831 --> 02:51:50,390
can't yeah,
we can't see past it.

2879
02:51:50,910 --> 02:51:51,271
Yeah.

2880
02:51:51,271 --> 02:51:55,770
It becomes something that we look for in
other things instead of considering the

2881
02:51:55,771 --> 02:52:00,771
possibility that there might not be a
beginning or it might not actually be a

2882
02:52:00,781 --> 02:52:04,230
beginning, it might be one of an
infinite number of beginnings.

2883
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:05,950
Like there's been a lot of people

2884
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:10,240
that have theorize the possibility
that the expansion of the universe,

2885
02:52:10,241 --> 02:52:14,830
that it will reach some point and then
ultimately collapsed back down to that

2886
02:52:14,831 --> 02:52:18,640
infinite point again and then
start all over again. And there's,

2887
02:52:18,910 --> 02:52:23,910
there's some resistance to that because
they can kind of through some sort of

2888
02:52:24,011 --> 02:52:29,011
radio telescope can pick up the actual
emissions that they believe are the

2889
02:52:29,321 --> 02:52:33,310
signature of the big bang. It's very,
very, very, very, very complicated stuff.

2890
02:52:33,740 --> 02:52:37,570
You tried to summarize it as a standup
comedian and a podcast with two dudes

2891
02:52:37,571 --> 02:52:41,310
that may or may not have smoke
weed. It gets real sketchy, but,

2892
02:52:42,160 --> 02:52:46,000
but even if there was nothing
until 14 billion years ago,

2893
02:52:46,360 --> 02:52:50,320
isn't that like the ultimate
fucking magic trick?

2894
02:52:50,800 --> 02:52:55,090
Like if forget about a god, all
right, even if there is no god,

2895
02:52:55,120 --> 02:52:57,580
if there is or there isn't,
forget about the concept of it.

2896
02:52:57,880 --> 02:53:02,880
How about the idea that everything that
you see in the sky came from something

2897
02:53:03,791 --> 02:53:08,791
that was smaller than the head of a pin
and it did so an impossibly long time

2898
02:53:09,761 --> 02:53:12,760
ago in an instant.
So this is the theory,

2899
02:53:12,960 --> 02:53:16,450
the eve from the people that tell you
that there's no evidence that there's a

2900
02:53:16,451 --> 02:53:20,500
god and that Jesus sounds like a
horse shit story. You know, that was

2901
02:53:20,700 --> 02:53:22,050
forget Jesus has gone by

2902
02:53:22,770 --> 02:53:26,550
traders written on animal
skins at one point in time.

2903
02:53:26,610 --> 02:53:29,820
What everybody agrees is that the
universe was smaller than the head of it.

2904
02:53:30,500 --> 02:53:34,370
Right? And then when it did explode
and created all of this matter, yeah,

2905
02:53:34,430 --> 02:53:39,430
it did it in a way that was all consistent
with the same laws of physics and

2906
02:53:40,280 --> 02:53:44,810
gravity, which they still
can't. They still can't figure
out gravity. You know, why?

2907
02:53:44,811 --> 02:53:46,250
How it can exist in,
in,

2908
02:53:46,460 --> 02:53:50,700
I think it's quantum physics and
gravity still have not been, uh, uh,

2909
02:53:50,750 --> 02:53:52,310
brought together in any way.
Right?

2910
02:53:52,630 --> 02:53:55,350
They try again, I'm an
idiot, so don't listen to me.

2911
02:53:55,351 --> 02:54:00,260
But I think dark matter is a one
of the, uh, the main, the, the,

2912
02:54:00,530 --> 02:54:00,930
the,

2913
02:54:00,930 --> 02:54:03,720
think about all the matter that they're
aware of in the universe and they think

2914
02:54:03,721 --> 02:54:07,590
about the effects of gravity and the
computations don't work unless they add in

2915
02:54:07,591 --> 02:54:09,210
this idea of dark matter.
Right?

2916
02:54:09,240 --> 02:54:12,930
The idea of dark matter being that the
universe consists of a bunch of different

2917
02:54:12,990 --> 02:54:16,740
things and a lot of it, the great
majority of which we can't even see

2918
02:54:17,100 --> 02:54:20,370
because there's an inverse forever
for every particle that's positive,

2919
02:54:20,371 --> 02:54:22,110
there has to be one that's,
that's neutral.

2920
02:54:22,111 --> 02:54:25,620
And for every piece of light there has
to be dark. And for every, you know,

2921
02:54:25,621 --> 02:54:28,890
everything has an opposite in
the universe to balance it.

2922
02:54:29,340 --> 02:54:31,530
And that's what dark matter
is. It's the, it's the,

2923
02:54:32,900 --> 02:54:34,470
I don't know what I'm talking about,

2924
02:54:35,870 --> 02:54:40,870
but just the whole idea behind infinity
and black holes and galaxies and every

2925
02:54:42,531 --> 02:54:46,340
black hole or every galaxy has a black
hole at the center of it. And there's,

2926
02:54:46,930 --> 02:54:48,220
but there was just an article.

2927
02:54:48,221 --> 02:54:51,970
That's what I'm trying to spew is that
I just read an article about this black

2928
02:54:51,971 --> 02:54:53,200
matter thing and how it is,

2929
02:54:53,201 --> 02:54:56,850
it is all that there is a balance to
everything in the universe, which is,

2930
02:54:57,460 --> 02:55:00,700
it makes sense. And that goes to
the spirituality and you know,

2931
02:55:00,701 --> 02:55:03,950
Buddhism and you know,
there's everything opposites,

2932
02:55:04,550 --> 02:55:07,640
the Yin and the Yang Yang in the Yang,
the Rockaways,

2933
02:55:08,720 --> 02:55:12,620
and a lot of ways, you know,
that's what they said, Greg,

2934
02:55:12,740 --> 02:55:17,090
you get out of life what you
put in. Whoa. They were right.

2935
02:55:17,690 --> 02:55:22,200
Fuck. There was this time to reap.
And there was a time to sell to.

2936
02:55:22,201 --> 02:55:25,790
That's so true. And when you only reap
and you never sowed, what'd he get?

2937
02:55:25,791 --> 02:55:28,500
Lottery winners. They
go broke quick. Right?

2938
02:55:28,940 --> 02:55:31,070
Kids who when their
money from inheritances,

2939
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:35,330
people that are squabbling over the
hundreds of millions of dollars at Robin

2940
02:55:35,330 --> 02:55:36,163
Williams left behind.

2941
02:55:36,770 --> 02:55:40,760
They're raping the reaping and so maybe
some of the wives probably did a little

2942
02:55:40,810 --> 02:55:45,610
sewing. They probably had to,
was a lot of work. He had this,

2943
02:55:45,830 --> 02:55:46,131
you know,

2944
02:55:46,131 --> 02:55:49,220
the thing is about inheriting a hundreds
of millions of dollars is the fucking

2945
02:55:49,221 --> 02:55:53,810
backstabbing that it takes. The lawyering
up, the energy, the negative creativity.

2946
02:55:53,900 --> 02:55:58,430
I mean Jesus Christ. You know what
carved me out five mil. I'm God.

2947
02:55:58,670 --> 02:56:01,910
You guys have fun with 100 million.
Yeah, I know she's going to kill you.

2948
02:56:01,970 --> 02:56:04,670
I know some brothers that are
going to war right now over there.

2949
02:56:04,671 --> 02:56:08,600
Mom Railey suing each other.
Shit,

2950
02:56:08,720 --> 02:56:12,890
trying to get a piece of that past
sun. Suddenly I had my moms, Bro,

2951
02:56:15,140 --> 02:56:17,240
let me get a taste.
Let me wet my big.

2952
02:56:17,290 --> 02:56:20,240
Just the idea that you know you're going
to compete with your brother or sister

2953
02:56:20,600 --> 02:56:23,990
for what's left of your mother.
It's just whoa,

2954
02:56:24,260 --> 02:56:27,620
because it all comes down to what you
think is right. That's what the gay,

2955
02:56:27,660 --> 02:56:30,560
you always put under the guise
of what's fair and what's just,

2956
02:56:30,561 --> 02:56:34,560
it's like nothing's fair adjusts. He
didn't earn the fucking money. Yeah.

2957
02:56:35,330 --> 02:56:38,960
It's just when you starting
to think about a loved one,

2958
02:56:38,961 --> 02:56:42,860
that way you start to think about
them as a payday. Yeah. You know,

2959
02:56:42,861 --> 02:56:46,010
and then their postmortem is once
they're in the ground. Okay, okay, okay.

2960
02:56:46,160 --> 02:56:47,150
How are we going to do this?

2961
02:56:47,330 --> 02:56:50,840
Because we're talking about a substantial
amount of money here and the family's

2962
02:56:50,841 --> 02:56:52,130
family businesses business.

2963
02:56:53,050 --> 02:56:56,630
You start getting really creepy
pissy when that parent gets old.

2964
02:56:56,660 --> 02:57:00,710
The older they get, the more that
shit becomes real. And how many,

2965
02:57:00,740 --> 02:57:05,740
how many brothers or sisters spent extra
time with the dying mom trying to get a

2966
02:57:06,561 --> 02:57:10,550
little, yeah, the mom was at
one point in time, you know,

2967
02:57:10,551 --> 02:57:13,760
I've been thinking about this. Well,
it's just not right that Johnny gets,

2968
02:57:13,761 --> 02:57:18,170
which you get, he doesn't even help
me. Johnny's a piece of Shit, Ma.

2969
02:57:18,530 --> 02:57:22,310
I know he was over at your favorite that
I don't resent you for that because he

2970
02:57:22,311 --> 02:57:25,250
was on the football team
and I was doing drugs. Okay.

2971
02:57:25,370 --> 02:57:29,060
But Johnny was always a piece of shit.
And who's here now, mom? I mean, what?

2972
02:57:29,061 --> 02:57:30,390
Your mom rubbing your feet,

2973
02:57:30,410 --> 02:57:35,410
rubbing you stinky feet with your fucking
dried out toenails all curled up in a

2974
02:57:36,081 --> 02:57:39,710
straws. I would like to end on something
better. We only have two minutes.

2975
02:57:39,960 --> 02:57:41,750
Listen to on a positive image.

2976
02:57:42,170 --> 02:57:45,140
Positive image is he takes that
money from his mom and he goes,

2977
02:57:45,141 --> 02:57:49,370
does Iowasca come become centered?
And you know what I heard they're doing,

2978
02:57:49,820 --> 02:57:54,200
they're doing um,
ketamine for people with depression.

2979
02:57:54,320 --> 02:57:55,011
What's ketamine?

2980
02:57:55,011 --> 02:58:00,011
Ketamine is a cat tranquilizer and
extremely psychedelic hallucinogen cat

2981
02:58:01,231 --> 02:58:02,100
tranquilizer

2982
02:58:02,250 --> 02:58:06,210
that they're treating people with
depression for. Yeah, I'll talk,

2983
02:58:06,220 --> 02:58:08,520
I'll talk to you about it
after this podcast is over.

2984
02:58:08,521 --> 02:58:11,430
Cause one of our friends is doing
it. I'll try it. Yeah. I would.

2985
02:58:11,440 --> 02:58:13,320
This one a why I brought it up.
I had to remember,

2986
02:58:13,560 --> 02:58:18,090
apparently it's having an
amazing effect. No friend. Wow.

2987
02:58:18,240 --> 02:58:19,860
It's a psychedelic,
it's like doing an asset.

2988
02:58:20,060 --> 02:58:22,610
See I need the kind of thing where,
you know,

2989
02:58:22,790 --> 02:58:26,740
are she fears got me convinced that
if I take mushrooms in a certain,

2990
02:58:26,741 --> 02:58:30,750
in a certain way that it can change.
Like not ongoing.

2991
02:58:30,770 --> 02:58:32,570
I don't have to keep taking it.
You can just take it.

2992
02:58:32,571 --> 02:58:33,920
And it can change your perspective.

2993
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:34,670
Oh, definitely. Well,

2994
02:58:34,670 --> 02:58:38,120
for a period of time you take enough and
you go into it with the right attitude,

2995
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:42,590
with the right people to write, really
want to be by herself. You know, Shit.

2996
02:58:42,950 --> 02:58:45,380
People will help a little if
they're the right people, but you,

2997
02:58:45,381 --> 02:58:47,630
you're counting on a lot of
people to keep it together. Right.

2998
02:58:48,200 --> 02:58:51,770
I think that a lot of those things,
sometimes the journey,

2999
02:58:51,860 --> 02:58:56,300
the best path is just get by yourself.
I like to do it. Get by herself.

3000
02:58:56,330 --> 02:58:57,500
Like Mckenna used to say,

3001
02:58:57,501 --> 02:59:02,120
silent darkness is the best place to
take them alone in silent darkness,

3002
02:59:02,150 --> 02:59:03,110
darkness.
It's,

3003
02:59:03,111 --> 02:59:06,290
I think it's one of the reasons why I like
the sensory deprivation tanks so much.

3004
02:59:06,690 --> 02:59:09,620
It's because you're forced to
not bounce off of each other,

3005
02:59:09,621 --> 02:59:14,060
but just forced to find what it is about
yourself that you're trying to work on,

3006
02:59:14,090 --> 02:59:16,850
what it is about yourself.
We're out of time. That's it.

3007
02:59:16,940 --> 02:59:20,690
That's the music we worked. I put Simmons.
Greg fits. What's the Fitstar radio

3008
02:59:21,050 --> 02:59:25,910
radio at Fitz,
doug.com follow me at Greg Fitz Shell.

3009
02:59:26,020 --> 02:59:28,750
All right you folks. We'll be
back soon. Much love. Bye Bye.

3010
02:59:31,380 --> 02:59:32,220
Jamie.
Had to hit the news.

3011
02:59:38,540 --> 02:59:39,373
Okay.

3012
02:59:50,700 --> 02:59:50,750
Yeah.
