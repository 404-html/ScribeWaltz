1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,460
Oh,
[inaudible] is bad for your,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,760
for your Wang,
for your Dick.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,430
It's probably bad for a lot of things.
You know what else is bad for it?

4
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:12,180
For me at least personally,
my experience when I got off of it,

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,850
my endurance,
like really?

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,010
Yeah,
like I've felt stronger.

7
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:21,230
Like I felt like physically better.
I go,

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,550
we'll get tired like when I was on that.
Yeah,

9
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:27,150
I heard this terrible side effects.
Ari Shaffir experienced severe

10
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:30,930
depression from propecia and didn't put
the two and two together until after he

11
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,860
got off of it and a,
he had like bad depression and it was

12
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:35,850
all in.
He realized like,

13
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:37,770
Oh my God,
it all started when I started taking

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,530
propecia messes with your sex drive too.
You did.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,150
[inaudible] guys.
My Dick,

16
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:43,950
like a bullet.
I'll be honest with you guys to take it

17
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:46,640
all the time and my Dick is always hard
hard right now.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,350
You're amazing as you always like to
say.

19
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:51,090
It's not testosterone.
I'm just perfect.

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,260
He tells me,
I think might just ask her is too high.

21
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:58,280
Like look at your inbox.
You're built like this dude.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,280
I took my shirt off.
Don't ever say you don't have any.

23
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:02,310
When I took my shirt off,
you went like this,

24
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,540
you go,
you held it in but you went like this.

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,760
You immediately might think I shuttered
and then you were like,

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,030
oh,
you need to get in better shape.

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,770
I was a woman that would be excited.
Yes.

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,670
Did have a pose off.
We had a post hoc just now two 48 year

29
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:19,130
old losers posing off.
Literally I'm on my phone,

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,973
Joe,
go shop.

31
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,130
We were making,
you were making you judge us,

32
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,430
making you jazz.
Are both my friends not be.

33
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,260
Both of you look great about who looks
younger.

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,420
At some point in time you're going to
grow up.

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,750
Like I always assumed that this would,
this would not be funny for me.

36
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,840
It wouldn't be with my friends.

37
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,070
Of course being retarded,
we loved it never ends 80 and doing

38
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:44,904
this.
I think so.

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,490
I think we'll always be attracted to
round soft surfaces.

40
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,180
Fighting's any kind of penetration and
it will get our attention always.

41
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:52,800
Like what happened?
He got punched him in the face.

42
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,100
Well listen to this crazy shit.
Dana White told me that the guy who

43
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:59,530
invented Regena King,
Peter Welling is that his name is in,

44
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:01,470
in Germany.
Dusseldorf.

45
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:05,430
Germany is the one that coby Bryant,
all those guys are flying out to Germany

46
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:08,100
to uh,
this regena keen procedure that

47
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:11,520
regenerate amazing antiinflammatory
properties.

48
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,740
He's figured out a way to regenerate
collagen with an injection with an

49
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:18,930
injection,
your body starts regenerating it's own

50
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:23,931
college and like a 20 year old Danny
saying wrinkles will just go away.

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,140
Your skin will just tighten up.
You are going to look like a much

52
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:31,290
younger person.
And this is all within like the next

53
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:31,410
year.

54
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,280
Really?
Yup.

55
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,210
There on that count.
He did look at my face.

56
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:36,210
You're beautiful.
So tight.

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,600
They're on the brink of doing this.
They're that close.

58
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,760
Like they're setting up the
infrastructure and they're getting rid

59
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,420
of the role with this stuff and when
they do that shit roll.

60
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,320
Hell yeah.
When they do,

61
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:47,910
it's going to be fucking bonkers,
man.

62
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:49,920
That's pretty wild.
You're going to see Barbara Walters

63
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,760
looking hot.
I know.

64
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,990
Whatever.
They're doing crazy stuff with tissue

65
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:57,720
regeneration.
I wonder when they're gonna be able to

66
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:00,430
do that to backs,
because people that have like really

67
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,910
fun,
like I ran into my friend alder was when

68
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,170
Eddie Bravo's black belts last night and
told me he hasn't been able to,

69
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,590
I haven't seen him awhile,
told me has it been able to do Jujitsu

70
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,990
in two years?
His back has been fucked up and it just

71
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:11,730
doesn't get better.

72
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,190
It's,
yes.

73
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,420
Yeah,
yeah,

74
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,470
definitely.
Well,

75
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:16,180
I'm doing a disc degeneration,
you know,

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,010
there are two girls I know who are in
wheelchairs,

77
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,701
you know,
and,

78
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,310
and uh,
they are,

79
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,670
are they going,
is it from Your Dick?

80
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,040
It's from a deck from the deck.
And,

81
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,560
uh,
you dictum they're both actually super

82
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:28,330
attractive.
I have to be honest.

83
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,610
And I,
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have,

84
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,440
so you're talking about spinal injuries
and you know,

85
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,510
obviously the,
the,

86
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,770
there's a long way to go before that,
but there's a guy in San Diego at doctor

87
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,630
who I guess works with electrical
pulses,

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,590
um,
and he has had some success in sort of,

89
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,970
he shoots and electrical sort of,
uh,

90
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,130
I don't know Paul [inaudible] in some
cases.

91
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,151
Uh,
it's,

92
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:54,580
it's given some feeling back on their
legs and stuff.

93
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:55,660
So it's,
it's promising,

94
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,000
but I think,
I think we're way now they're going to

95
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:58,990
fix all that stuff.

96
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,800
They just can't figure out how to
regenerate spinal tissue.

97
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:06,130
They can't figure out how to connect.
Once your cord is severed,

98
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,680
they can't do anything about it.
But they're very,

99
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,690
they're very hopeful.
I don't know what they're doing it with

100
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:13,030
penises.
I mean that you're unable to transplant

101
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,410
a penis.
Not only did the guy that they

102
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,330
transplanted his penis and he was
excited,

103
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:18,130
he got his girlfriend pregnant.
Wow.

104
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,090
That's right.
Yeah.

105
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,950
Yeah.
Craig was the hardest thing for so many

106
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:23,020
veterans is when they get their legs
blown off.

107
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:24,400
The first thing they talked to was
saying,

108
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,800
the first thing young men got to say is,
what's going on with my,

109
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,270
My,
my dad of course.

110
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,370
And of course,
and it's so devastating.

111
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:34,160
It's such a devastating wound.
And one of the things that they were

112
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:35,500
trying to get money for it and they were
like,

113
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:35,971
look,
we,

114
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,990
we legs are more important.

115
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,400
He said,
you have no idea what you're talking

116
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:44,230
about mentally for a young man when he
gets an injury to his groin,

117
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,920
that's fucking more devastating than
almost anything else.

118
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,100
Just to it down sizing.
Also,

119
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,040
when you,
Dick gets blown off with your balls like

120
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,320
you,
you don't have testosterone even

121
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:53,154
planning.
Exactly.

122
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,180
So it's obviously,
there's a lot a lot to say about that.

123
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,050
The horrors of war,
the idea that you can just figure out

124
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,560
how to fix bodies to the point where
anything that's broken can just get

125
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:06,970
repaired.
You know,

126
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:11,971
think about like 105 hundred years ago.
If you got a broken leg like 500 years

127
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:13,630
ago,
you're a dead man.

128
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,610
We're going to have to put you down.
The thing is,

129
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:18,370
you know the one thing,
they can't figure out how to help your

130
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:20,310
brain.
It's the only company kept figuring out

131
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,190
everything else.

132
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,240
You're good.
I feel like.

133
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:24,650
Why don't they just drill a hole and
shoot some stem cells on there?

134
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,021
I don't know,
man.

135
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:29,170
It's this crispr crispr cas nine is
fucking incredible.

136
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,710
That's the new frontier,
and in 10 years we're going to be,

137
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,740
we're going to be literally taking your
DNA and putting a gene in the area.

138
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,050
Apparently just shooting a gene in the
area of that.

139
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,640
When they snip your DNA,
there's this whole,

140
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,900
you know,
do you know how it works?

141
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:47,140
It's kind of wild.
This is a great radio lab podcast on

142
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,700
Chris.
I listened to it twice so I could figure

143
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,750
out what they were saying.
You know what?

144
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:51,220
The con is tall.
This though is the,

145
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:55,930
all this advancement and medical and all
that stuff and we're fixing everyone is,

146
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,890
it's going,
everything's gonna get over populated.

147
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,330
Right Pete,
when to stop dying.

148
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,230
There will always be plain old death.
I think the biggest question is how the

149
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,930
average lives can be way long.
It's already increasing.

150
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,823
Also,
how do you,

151
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,130
how do you pay for like there are
certain cancer treatments that are

152
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,420
$1,000 a pill.
I mean,

153
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,170
you can cure hep c now and it's $1,000 a
pill.

154
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,720
It'll cost you $84,000 but you'll cure
it.

155
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,110
You will for sure.
Take the cap.

156
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:22,700
C is is a curable disease.
It's not.

157
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,890
It's no longer a manageable disease.
Used to be really hard.

158
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:28,190
You'd have to take interferon,
which would only work on northern

159
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,690
Europeans buyer's club.
The look on Brennan shoves faces.

160
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,700
He can still fuck Pamela Anderson
with the bullet.

161
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,870
Hold on with the Collagen.

162
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,620
Sign me up son to it.
You've got to get her to do squats.

163
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,040
I know.
No one has little.

164
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,360
No.
I said no,

165
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,250
nothing.
Oh,

166
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,460
panhell.
I worked with her.

167
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:54,620
She hadn't asked easy.
When did you work with her?

168
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,660
I did stacked the great tv,
so in the 60s it may as well been stack.

169
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:02,030
She was,
she was 14 she was 38 and it's still

170
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:04,820
very hot.
How old is see at the time,

171
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,650
so you're talking about like at least 10
years ago?

172
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,530
About 10 years ago I saw Sydney
Crawford.

173
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,870
I was coming out of yoga in Santa
Monica.

174
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,510
She is jaw dropping.
Gorgeous.

175
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,760
Beautiful.
She had a long conversation with her and

176
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,520
her husband like six months ago at a
party.

177
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,510
Yeah.
She's,

178
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,620
she's loud as fuck.
Fucking,

179
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,110
she's like 50 yes,
51 something like that.

180
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,730
I love it.
She keeps it up baby.

181
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,080
She's in Christie Brinkley.

182
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,830
Yes.
62 have you seen it?

183
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,980
No,
it's hot as fuck.

184
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:33,080
Really?
She seems to have this older lady.

185
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,090
Oh No,
she was the hottest dog.

186
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:40,091
The lady I saw Raquel Welsh when she was
in her sixties and a straight up dime

187
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:41,780
piece,
but some women are beautiful.

188
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,670
They're whole fucking lake and hang in
there,

189
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,780
Barry,
rick and hang in there.

190
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,520
Fucking rare.
How much effort it must take to keep

191
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:50,910
that up.
I mean it's a day.

192
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,640
It's a job.
You don't think it's genetics.

193
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,370
It's probably that too,
but also effort.

194
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,340
I don't think there's any woman who
looks at that fantastic that doesn't do

195
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:03,290
something like either the fillers on
their face or they work out like a

196
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:07,700
fucking demon,
which is a mandatory or they go to,

197
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,150
they have to,
they have to probably do cryogenics like

198
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:14,380
that's Christie Brinkley.
She's 62 that's nuts.

199
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,350
My mom is very similar in age now.

200
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,250
I would go on a date with her too.
She's hot and that's not even a good

201
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,070
picture because like the sun's behind
her or faces in the shade.

202
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,310
Like she's legitimately high definition.
Beautiful.

203
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:31,160
That's crazy.
She might fall off it though when you

204
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:32,420
get in the sec.
You know what I'm saying?

205
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,830
Like bones of which probably just sleeps
all the time.

206
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,230
Just like the
bathtub.

207
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,760
It's filled with blood.
I started noticing,

208
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,190
I started noticing like for me like
about about four years ago,

209
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,540
maybe three years ago.
Like,

210
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,880
I noticed that girls just didn't look at
me the same when I come off stage like

211
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,370
I,
I mean I talk about my wife who's a,

212
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,360
but when when you as a young man like
you're doing standup,

213
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,620
you would always have some female
attention.

214
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,630
It's,
it's died down quite a bit.

215
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,440
Dry it up,
write up a little bit older.

216
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,520
I'm old guy,
I'm 48.

217
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,980
Now if a girl who is 20 and she would
just leave them there,

218
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,890
I'm sure like we were talking about it,
her friends would probably be like how

219
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,740
old is for sure.
Yeah.

220
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,790
Your fans know are more interested in
Bingo and shit.

221
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,630
I'm not very so what does that college
and Shit coming up soon?

222
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,590
I'm shooting national by the gallon,
but the couch catalog,

223
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,980
shoot it right into your face holes.
I'm going to take my shirt off here

224
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:32,260
cause I got cheap phone's off too.
Yeah.

225
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,570
But um,
they just don't like feeble old dudes,

226
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,540
you know,
weird like calling shoes and they don't

227
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,790
look like fuck gravity's winning.
Some guys,

228
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,690
some guys let themselves go.
I've never understood that.

229
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,890
Yeah.
Look,

230
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,260
we were just talking about Christie
Brinkley.

231
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:52,110
She's like way older than us.
Yeah,

232
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,730
but we would all fucker.
Yes.

233
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,590
Give him a chance and the right
circumstance.

234
00:09:56,591 --> 00:10:00,870
I'm taking my sports to a new level.
By the time I'm 60 drugs playing tennis.

235
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,330
What does this tennis thing,
why are you so obsessed with that?

236
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,250
It's always been somebody.
You take them something manly.

237
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,500
Look at Jujitsu I box bro.
Oh yeah,

238
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,720
you do bro.
I go,

239
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,200
I go,
I go four rounds.

240
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,180
Amazing.
Don't why you're looking at his past and

241
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,830
as Chris van Heerden.
That's not the answer.

242
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,630
That's on the answer to that question.
It was about,

243
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,680
I don't have to get out of all the
details stuff going on.

244
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:23,280
Do you have about three?
It was about three weeks ago.

245
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,130
Did you watch the UFC this weekend?
I did.

246
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,880
Did you,
where would I and by the way,

247
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,711
yes,
not to brag,

248
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:33,120
but I called every single fight,
including the Rose Page fight and the

249
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,140
uh,
Frankie Edgar,

250
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:34,860
Edgar,
uh,

251
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,570
well you didn't call the result.

252
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,280
You didn't know.
He just picked those guys.

253
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,960
Pick the winners,
pick the winners.

254
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:42,780
I don't think anybody,
I thought Frankie had a real good shot

255
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:45,090
at decisioning.
Like when my friends ask me like who's

256
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:46,260
going to win?
This was going to win that.

257
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,900
I said Frankie has a real good shot of
decisioning chat.

258
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:51,630
The chat also has a good shot at
knocking Franklin percent.

259
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,080
The only reason I picked so fucking
hard,

260
00:10:55,081 --> 00:11:00,000
I mean he knocked out Ricardo Lamas mean
he bangs and he also loads up.

261
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,140
Yes.
I just figured I,

262
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,790
for me I pick frankie because I,
I knew frankie wouldn't gas and I think

263
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,650
if anything,
I thought if Chad had to keep up with

264
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:09,780
Frankie's pace,
he would gas toward,

265
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,500
we'll chat actually came into this fight
light cause I think he anticipated that

266
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,300
kind of pace that frankie was going to
put on him.

267
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,170
So I was talking about two different
buckles and he said the chat was way

268
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:21,300
later for this fight.
He did a shit ton of cardio.

269
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,750
Like he was embarrassed by the conor
fight that he gassed out so quick.

270
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,580
Right.
Obviously took that fight on two weeks

271
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:28,830
notice,
which is a joke when you're a big guy

272
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:31,050
like him and you've got to cut weight to
get down to one 45,

273
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,930
his entire campus is probably all about
him losing weight,

274
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,580
you know.
But this,

275
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:40,410
this camp you got in real good shape.
I just got clip a lot of these fights or

276
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,200
it's a tossup,
like it's so close to the matches were

277
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,880
so close so he could have went either
way.

278
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:46,890
So many people were so fucking mad at
me.

279
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,330
We're after the fight,
they give suggestions like the UFC says,

280
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,950
um,
the truck will say,

281
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,130
who do you think should get the next

282
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,360
shot in your hair?
Yeah,

283
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,000
they say the golden goliaths.
Okay.

284
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,330
And so,
uh,

285
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,430
they had,
uh,

286
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,440
this,
the footage based up for Frankie Edgar.

287
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,690
And so I said,
um,

288
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,920
I said,
honestly,

289
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,010
I don't think that a rematch is the
right,

290
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,020
well,
you definitely could do a rematch.

291
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,100
The problem with doing a rematch is with
Aldo,

292
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,680
conor mcgregor and Aldo.
The problem with doing a rematch as it'd

293
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:21,610
be so hard to sell when a guy gets
knocked out that quick.

294
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:23,740
When you hype it up for as long as you
did,

295
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,840
you'll hype it up for two separate
events.

296
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,840
It dies off and then the first punch
connor connects with it,

297
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,250
puts him out.
He was a star,

298
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,170
but it's hard.
It's hard to sell that.

299
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,590
But if you want to look at like,
like lineage and you look,

300
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,300
look as history,
you'd say,

301
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:38,250
yeah,
Oh,

302
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,090
the guy was a champion for 10 years.

303
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
He should ever eat.
He wants to,

304
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,110
but does he sees it.
He's the thing.

305
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,810
There's a giant list of people.
People say that Cain got an immediate

306
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:49,210
rematch as a junior,
junior dos Santos knocked him out,

307
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,130
but he didn't.
He thought big foot Silva.

308
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,410
He knocked out big foot Silva and then
he got a rematch.

309
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,310
But traditionally,
traditionally inboxing,

310
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,060
correct me if you're not in box,
but that's the wrong argument.

311
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,470
You'll go off the UFC,
so here's the counter.

312
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,440
I can go,
I'm with you as soon as don't be,

313
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:03,274
we're like rematch.
I'm like,

314
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,340
well he just got murked in 13 seconds.
There's not much of a rematch.

315
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,290
But if you look at the history of the
UFC,

316
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,960
he should get a rematch just based off
the way they usually do things.

317
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,760
So we look at,
we look at Barao,

318
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,750
right,
we'll get brow,

319
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:18,430
he lost immediate rematch.

320
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,550
We look at Anderson Silva,
immediate rematch.

321
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,540
You know there's,
there's tons in the history.

322
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,810
Ronda rousey immediately match all
those.

323
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,550
Yes.
Such a bad ass.

324
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:30,490
He should get immediate rematch
according to what they've done before.

325
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,690
Right.
It make sense.

326
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,120
Not think what they've done before is
based.

327
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,100
I think a lot of it is based on like
what kind of compelling contenders do

328
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:43,090
they have for that title and especially
compelling contenders where you look at

329
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:46,900
their,
their style versus like the style of the

330
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:50,440
guy who is now the current champion and
if you wanted to pick like the most

331
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:54,100
intriguing stylistic matchup.
I think it's Frankie Edgar.

332
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,040
Yes.
Frankie Edgar.

333
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,860
Because I've fought at 55 and one the
title of 55 meet legends and Bj Penn

334
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,500
just knocked out Chad Mendez with one
punch before that.

335
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:04,540
Beat the fuck out of cub.
Swanson shut it out.

336
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,490
I mean he beat Uriah Faber.

337
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,780
He's,
he's fucking,

338
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,930
he's smushed everybody.
They put in front of them for a few

339
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,340
years now.
He's a monster.

340
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:15,580
He deserved.
But how can you give someone say like

341
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,710
Rhonda,
an immediate rematch and make holly

342
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:19,210
weight?
That's a very good question.

343
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:20,710
As you're saying.
I agree.

344
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,930
I'm not saying that Rhonda should get an
immediate rematch.

345
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,251
It's true.
You weren't,

346
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:26,560
but for the most part she's getting
immediate rematch,

347
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:27,850
right?
It's guaranteed.

348
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,210
Well that's the plan,
but she has to pass the medical to make

349
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,340
sure she's healthy and all that.
But the plan is she's going to get the

350
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:38,920
rematch,
but it's only financial.

351
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,240
But financially,
the Holly Holm fight with Ronda is the

352
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:47,170
biggest fight for Holly Holm.
Holly Holmes going to make like $7

353
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,650
million for the Ronda Rousey for her.
If I was Holly Holm,

354
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,950
she doesn't want to wait.
She wants to stay active.

355
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,590
And I totally understand that and I
think,

356
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:56,390
you know,
it should be her prerogative as a

357
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:00,290
champion to kind of choose,
but financially,

358
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,760
that's the smart fight for her.

359
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,140
Like it's good.
She's going to make the most money.

360
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,400
She does.
She wants to fight me.

361
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,630
Should tape before.
Yes,

362
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800
she does.
Her and her camera.

363
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:08,810
Let's do Ameesha one's a fight.
The UFC saying no.

364
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,410
So how can you grow this law?
I'm saying you can't play favorites

365
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,610
because when the,
when the,

366
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,090
when the public smells favorites,
then you're losing credibility.

367
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,190
But does he have one tab for the
marriage?

368
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,990
Is that favorites or is that smart?
Financially was really good.

369
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,520
What about Verdomme cane?
That's comedian Kane and verdomme.

370
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:30,170
We're not going to have an immediate
rematch.

371
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,920
They offered for doom other fights and I
don't know how they came to the

372
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:36,500
conclusion of cane fighting,
but I apparently there was a bunch of

373
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,350
other people in the mix and they came to
settle on cane.

374
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,220
It might have been that it was her dooms
choice because financial reasons like

375
00:15:44,221 --> 00:15:47,540
the f the cane fight will be much more
financially viable.

376
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,373
I get it,
man.

377
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,180
Hanan Barao you know what I'm saying to
you?

378
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,130
Give and morale.
He's not a draw at all.

379
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,270
Right Tj?
Whoops.

380
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:55,430
His asked you like left.
This guy's been a champ for so long.

381
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:57,440
We give him enough.
I see what you're saying.

382
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,520
That there should be consistency.
There has to be,

383
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,550
oh shit.
Hold on.

384
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:02,450
You don't know what you talking about
it.

385
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,240
You can't,
you can't play.

386
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,710
You know what I'm saying,
Joe?

387
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,710
Like you can't play favorites because
you're standing in line for a second.

388
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,380
The whole erupting him.
So,

389
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,900
but you,
there just has to be some sort of

390
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,460
consistent where you just can't play
favorites.

391
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,290
Well this is good here.
This is good here.

392
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,790
You know,
I keep the same with the,

393
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,590
and Damien Meyer brought the sub.
It's a great point.

394
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:25,720
Yeah,
it's the same with the,

395
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,200
the rankings because who the fuck where
the fuck you?

396
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,850
Here's one that doesn't make any sense
to me.

397
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:36,040
How come you Riaa hall knocked out Gay
Garden.

398
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,490
Who?
Saucy but gig massage.

399
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:40,360
He was ahead of him in the rankings,
knocked him out of his last visit.

400
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,200
A bunch like that.
There's a bunch like that.

401
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,000
That's a thing,
so that's the most egregious,

402
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:45,980
in my opinion.
There's been bigger ones that I've seen,

403
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,010
but most of the fighters,
we laugh at the rankings.

404
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,290
We used to laugh in the ring.
It's like one and two,

405
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,310
whatever it takes.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to

406
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:56,210
figure out what to after that.
Who's voting on these?

407
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,610
I don't know about.
It's the same thing with a lot of these

408
00:16:58,611 --> 00:16:59,570
title shots like,
okay,

409
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:02,570
let me ask you won't be taken seriously.
It can't be wwe style.

410
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Let me ask you this.
Do you think there's an inherent problem

411
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:10,601
with the promotion being the UFC also
being the ones who dictate what,

412
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,800
what?

413
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,490
Who fights for title 100% because
normally it's not like,

414
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:19,970
what do you mean by that?
WBC like is a sanctioning body,

415
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:20,870
right?
For Boxing,

416
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,080
the WBC decides who's the mandatory
contender and then Bob Arum or don king

417
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,570
or golden boy.
Those are the ones who promote the

418
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:32,780
fight.
The UFC is both right there,

419
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,540
the sanctioning body,
and they're also the promoters of the

420
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,540
fight.
So they have a vested interest in going

421
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:42,980
with the best financial option.
This is why Tyson fury was just stripped

422
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:44,990
of his heavyweight title,
Tyson Fury,

423
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:49,740
just legitimately outbox Vladimir
Klitschko beat his ass just a hundred

424
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,820
percent.
It's kind of weird,

425
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,590
clunky style.
You have won every round,

426
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,850
every fucking beat Vladimir Klitschko
guys and lost in 10 fucking years.

427
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,560
And they had an immediate,
um,

428
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,520
uh,
defense of the title that they were

429
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,800
imposing on him.
And he passed on.

430
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:05,760
He said,
I'm not doing that.

431
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,110
They stripped him of his title.

432
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,710
This is within weeks of him beating
Vladimir Klitschko to the title.

433
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,490
So this is a drast,
drastic,

434
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,360
drastic contrast to what the UFC has.
The UFC would say,

435
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,051
look,
you,

436
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,810
I don't care what the ratings are,
you're fighting Vladimir Klitschko

437
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,670
again,
because that's where all the fucking

438
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:24,270
money.
Yes.

439
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,100
Right.
And that's what they would do.

440
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,050
Well,
think of the NFL and NBA did this,

441
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,290
or mlb,
if these other major leagues did this,

442
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,540
you'd have the most popular teams.
You'd have to say that he's in the

443
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,840
playoff lot of time you'd have,
it's not a valid comparison.

444
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,520
It is because not because you're talking
about,

445
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:38,851
no,
no,

446
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,320
no.
Because you're talking about teams.

447
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,300
You're talking about teams versus
individuals.

448
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,530
It's not about Harrison,
don't you think disagrees?

449
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,360
I think you need to play for a
championship.

450
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,940
You have to go through a whole season.
You go through a whole season.

451
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,840
You have to win to even be in contention
to play for the super bowl to be in

452
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:57,500
contention to play for the major league,
but it's still not.

453
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,150
It's very black and white when you're
in,

454
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,770
but let me go see.
He's not black and white.

455
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:03,400
I may ask you guys a question about
about,

456
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,590
that's why it's not a valid comparison
because you can't sand junket taking

457
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:08,970
serious.
You're going to have to come up with a

458
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:11,520
formula where people can see the madness
behind your reasons.

459
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,840
I cannot tell her rhythm or something.
Right?

460
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,640
Yes.
That's what Demian Maia was saying.

461
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,730
Damien Maia was saying that after the,
the,

462
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,160
I think he said like,
I don't know how many victories in a row

463
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,620
he's had,
but at welterweight he's been virtually

464
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,500
like flawless.
I mean I think one person might have

465
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:27,600
beaten them at welter weight.
That's crazy.

466
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,370
Who beat Damien Maia at welterweight.

467
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,130
But look,
Damien Maia made a very good point.

468
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:35,700
Damien Maia.
So he's such a fucking respectful

469
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,930
gentlemen and such a,
a perfect representative of martial

470
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:41,880
arts.
That guy is a gym.

471
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,040
[inaudible] quote.
He goes,

472
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,660
I just do punching to set up my take
down so I can do Jujitsu cause I don't

473
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:51,420
want to hurt my opponent.
I want to be able to train the next day

474
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,420
because I just want to get in there and
win by Jujitsu so I can go back,

475
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,480
train.
They can go back to train.

476
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,780
Wow.
He's one of the good ones that he's

477
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,850
amazing.
He's the fucking young guy.

478
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:00,780
Destroy though,
hey,

479
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:04,140
let's quit tossing these young up and
comers and he just raped.

480
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,340
Oh,
but who cares?

481
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,510
I man each gun or just edit it and set
it up and let him choke them all.

482
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,760
Okay.
So Roy McDonald beat him.

483
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:14,580
That was the last guy at welter weight.

484
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,620
Oh.
And right before that was jake shields

485
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:18,790
beat him,
which was a great fucking fire man.

486
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,500
But that was a split decision.
Roy beat them unanimous decision.

487
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,770
Split decisions are so weird because
sometimes they are clear.

488
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,490
You just got an idiot judge and I don't
remember how about Romero and jock

489
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,290
array.
That was a very close fight.

490
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,760
I thought I was going to be a drawl or
split decision have been,

491
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,650
well I thought it could have been a draw
because I think eol definitely got a 10,

492
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:43,350
eight round the first round.
But the question is will they scored a

493
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:46,290
ten eight round when you got a guy
completely on Queer Street,

494
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,920
you spinning back fist him in the jaw,
knock him and John Corey was,

495
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,260
he got up to his,
uh,

496
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,380
after he took a fucking prolonged
beating on the ground,

497
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:59,260
he got,
he got hit with some bombs by Yo el.

498
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,000
He gets up to go to his corner and he is
on wobbly legs.

499
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,860
Like they could have easily stopped the
fight.

500
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,290
And I was thinking that they might
should have stopped that fight.

501
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,400
But jock,
right.

502
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,290
Being the stud that is came back and
reestablish himself in the second round.

503
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,470
Partially because Yo el gassed cause eol
who looks like a fucking superhero.

504
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,780
The most ridiculous history.
Not just for five,

505
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,700
three you mean three minutes.
Exactly.

506
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,210
That's why that's why he fights.
He fights luke rockhold and tries to go

507
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:29,650
five rounds.
This is my aunt Jo.

508
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:31,720
You can't give you,
I thought after that fight,

509
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:34,030
whoever wins,
you can't give those guys a title shot.

510
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,640
There's,
you do Weidman rockhold to you don't

511
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:39,220
give the winner of that bullshit fight
or a title shot.

512
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:39,971
I don't think,
uh,

513
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:41,890
I think you could make a real good point
to that.

514
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,980
Um,
but this sort of contradicts what you

515
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:48,700
said about having a very clear algorithm
as far as like who becomes a number one

516
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,800
contender and who fight too.
But this is the thing,

517
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:53,980
I'm going based off past UFC history.
You know what I think they should do.

518
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,920
I really think this,
I think there should be a way where

519
00:21:56,921 --> 00:22:01,000
people sign in on facebook.
You know like you sign in using your

520
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:04,150
facebook so we know you're a real person
and the public votes.

521
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,800
Then you also have the media vote.
You have the mixed martial arts media,

522
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,230
like the the guys who was like the
Golden Globes almost.

523
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,520
Yeah,
something like that.

524
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,280
And then you have fighters vote.
So you have,

525
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,790
so just like how you have three judges
that score a fight,

526
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,090
you have three sources that you use to
pick who the contenders are.

527
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,210
It's a good idea.

528
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,700
Who the number one contender,
wisdom of crowds.

529
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,680
I think it's a bad idea and I think it's
going to lead to a lot of trouble if you

530
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:34,570
just leave it up to the UFC brass to
make.

531
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,873
I don't,
I don't,

532
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,410
even though I work for the UFC and I've
worked for the UFC forever,

533
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,970
like people ask me questions.
I don't know.

534
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,290
I don't know.
Like when I get,

535
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,480
I don't know who the fuck does it.
I don't know who makes the rankings.

536
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:44,950
I don't know shit.
When I get to work,

537
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:47,530
this is what I do when I get to the UFC,
I say hi to everybody,

538
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:48,364
a hug,
everybody.

539
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,570
I get excited,
I go,

540
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:52,220
I can't believe this.
I start going over the,

541
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:54,220
the matchups.
I um,

542
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,420
I've already watched video on fucking
everybody in the card pretty much by

543
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:00,670
then.
And when I say I don't do research,

544
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,930
I'm kind of full of shit.

545
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,470
But it's not that I don't,
I don't do it as research.

546
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,790
I just do it because like,
oh,

547
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,380
it will be coming to him.
How's he fucking how to handle this

548
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,130
dude's got a nasty,
we re Alvarez kind of fucking wicked

549
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:13,210
good team.
Like if they go,

550
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,190
if he tries to take this kid to the
ground,

551
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:16,660
he's going to shoot for that double is
going to get caught.

552
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,630
Nikea teen,
it's not your job as is a fucking nasty

553
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,280
kickboxer he's gonna want to take this
guy down,

554
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,250
but it is my job sort of,
but I would have,

555
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:26,700
shouldn't know like the rankings and
decide that.

556
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,830
I'm just saying that I would,
I would do everything that I do even if

557
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:33,190
I wasn't working for the UFC just cause
I'm like freaking out about these events

558
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:35,970
and that's just what I get in the past.
But because again,

559
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't know what the fuck is going on
besides that.

560
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,040
When I get there,
when I show up,

561
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,750
I say my highs,
I get my shit.

562
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:46,100
They put the mic on me,
I high five

563
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,330
Goldberg,
we hug each other.

564
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,200
Here we go.
You know what?

565
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:49,870
Don't they know?
I don't know what's going on.

566
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,250
Share more about your opinion and you
know,

567
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:54,050
especially in the public.
Well it's not,

568
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,110
some people are mad though.
This is what we got into the beginning

569
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,970
that I said I don't think that it's
smart to have all doe fight right away.

570
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,530
My opinion is that first of all,
although got knocked dead.

571
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,410
Okay.
When you get knocked dead like that and

572
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:11,570
you need a long time off,
you need at least six months off conor

573
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:13,270
mcgregor fight next Tuesday.
Yes.

574
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,500
And I think that Frankie Edgar could
also fight next to 100% I also think

575
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:22,580
that death fight will be fucking bananas
and for a Fan.

576
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,320
I am so excited to watch that fight
cause I think Frankie has a really

577
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:31,340
dangerous style for a guy like conor
who's taken it down repeatedly by Chad

578
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:32,010
Mendez.

579
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,100
True.
He's a fucking nasty wrestler.

580
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:37,670
His cardio is off the chain.
His footwork is fantastic.

581
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:40,700
He's got Mark Henry in his corner.
They're going to come up with a bad ass

582
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:44,900
game plan between Kenrey Henry and
cavenaugh and Frankie,

583
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,230
who's a fucking winner.
And Connor,

584
00:24:47,231 --> 00:24:50,000
who's a fucking winner.
God Damn.

585
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,810
Let me ask you,
what would you be most excited about?

586
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,800
You ready for this?
Yes.

587
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,780
Cowboy to beat dos Anjos dos Anjos
Connor in Dublin in front 80,000 fans.

588
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,230
Oh yeah,
a hundred percent hundred percent you're

589
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:04,460
right.
Think about more writing.

590
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,770
You're right.
The title Donald Serone.

591
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:12,030
Connor,
let me just say one thing giant if,

592
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,560
yeah.
Hofeld dos Anjos is a fucking beast and

593
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:18,770
I think those two are going to clash and
who knows what's going to happen.

594
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:20,480
Especially since still sun just beat
cowboy.

595
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:23,120
The first fight.
I think it's going to be a wild wicked

596
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,910
fight drug that I'm no longer right.

597
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,090
Oh,
drug testing.

598
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,160
Did you just say there's going to be
that crf but wait,

599
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:30,500
wait,
take me back to a second.

600
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,050
Let me say one thing about you've got to
give Josie Aldo a rematch in my opinion

601
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,310
for two reasons.
One,

602
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:42,410
I think that at the end of the day he
was the champion for 10 years and if

603
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:46,250
anybody's earned a shot too.
I know I believe.

604
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,090
I think conor mcgregor is has a secret
which is he's,

605
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,820
he's watching these guys strike and know
something.

606
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,260
They don't know he's,
he somehow,

607
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,700
I don't know if he sending to doesn't
matter.

608
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:57,830
Hold on Hon because that's just saying
who you think is going to,

609
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:01,280
what I'm saying is this,
when you knock a champion who's been

610
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:06,281
that dominant and that good for 10 years
out in 14 seconds there is the question.

611
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,980
There is a question which is was that in
some ways a fluke,

612
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,140
what did he make one mistake and paid
for it,

613
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,030
which can happen in mma with those small
gloves,

614
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,660
does he get another shot to at least
kind call longer how it goes.

615
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:22,640
He's going to come out extremely
aggressive.

616
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:26,600
I'm going to count and I know that and I
hold it and you see the video of him

617
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:30,920
warming up in the dressing room and then
in contrast like a split screen with him

618
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,410
warming up right next to the actual
fight itself.

619
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,820
He was preparing exactly for that
maneuver and he's making,

620
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,500
he's mimicking all those face first
movement and he does this little slight

621
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:43,980
step to his right hand side.
He makes

622
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,840
an adjustment.
He throws the first left hand,

623
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:47,340
the first land hat and debt doesn't
land.

624
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,290
So if you watch him,
him moving,

625
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:53,010
he throws that sidekick to the leg.
Then he makes a very slight step to the

626
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:57,150
right although moves to the right hand
counters them with the left boom.

627
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,110
Hey know something.
That's what I'm saying,

628
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:03,120
cause I think that he would fight him
again and knock them out of that's real.

629
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,820
I think it's irrelevant.
Champion gets a rematch.

630
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,800
I think he deserves it.
I really do.

631
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,570
But here's the thing,
it ties up the title for a long time and

632
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:14,080
you have all these contenders.
Yeah.

633
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,530
You have an amazing group listed
contenders.

634
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:20,040
How about this?
How about you have Joe's a Aldo fight,

635
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:23,550
Max Holloway and you have a fucking
great fight between one of the top

636
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:25,350
contenders and Max Holloway.
This young,

637
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,450
exciting kid,
24 years old,

638
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,100
Pete and everybody just figure it out.

639
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,660
Jeremy Stevens,
he's elusive.

640
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,820
He slick.
He puts on a fucking show where a

641
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,510
motherfucker,
he has crazy cardio.

642
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:40,800
He's driven and fired up and you can't
quite have them fight for the title yet

643
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,950
because Frankie's ahead of him and it's,
you know,

644
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:46,000
the division is super exciting.
Frankie fucking clear.

645
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:47,850
The way man fight.
Frankie was pissed.

646
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:50,760
He didn't get the shot when Chad got it.
After he beat Uriah,

647
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,560
he,
they thought that Frankie,

648
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,170
his safety first style gets Uriah was
boring.

649
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,390
You want a decision?
He didn't try to finish him.

650
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,330
Chad went out and blew ricardo lamas out
of the water.

651
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,850
Chad gets to shun Frankie's like,
what the fuck?

652
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,010
But I did the cub Swanson.
Look what I did do all these other

653
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:06,540
people.
So then what does he do?

654
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,020
He goes out there and takes it out on
chat.

655
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,080
Merck,
Merck,

656
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:12,450
something.
Put some away in my opinion,

657
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,730
like as a fan,
I'm excited to see that.

658
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,070
I think here's another thing.
I really believe this wholeheartedly and

659
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:24,780
I think this is a very important point.
Fighters should wait a long fucking time

660
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:26,700
after they get knocked out like that.
True.

661
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,480
He got cleaned,
he got flat,

662
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,610
and then he got hammer fist.
As he was out,

663
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,640
he,
he got up and he was asking what

664
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:37,060
happened,
what he was putting his hands up and

665
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,370
going,
I don't know what he's saying because

666
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:40,680
he's speaking in Portuguese.
Because he was shaking his head and they

667
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:42,460
were nodding their head.
They were saying yes and that would be

668
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,771
goes,
no,

669
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:43,081
no,
no.

670
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:43,801
And they were going,
yes,

671
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:44,190
yes,
yes.

672
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,500
Here's the other thing Joe.
A lot of people are talking about,

673
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:50,910
I hate to be a stickler and I took some
fucking shit for saying this.

674
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,830
You're bat shit crazy if you don't think
Josie Aldos body looked different.

675
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,080
You're batshit crazy.
If you think he's going to fight the

676
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:01,740
same also and all these people are
giving me all the shit for it.

677
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,910
His Camp I think is one in seven Oh and
eight since this drug test and came out.

678
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,160
So you're talking about a different
fighter man,

679
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,810
a completely different fighter.
Well,

680
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,920
so for me that's a huge x factor.
There was a leaked audio from inside the

681
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:18,010
truck of me saying that someone got the,
when the,

682
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:20,310
when the audio goes out,
there's an audio feed when the main

683
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:23,280
event happens and when that main event
audio feed goes out,

684
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,160
they,
anybody could listen to it.

685
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:29,220
That is it picking up the feed to it and
broadcast.

686
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,920
And I said that his body looked
deflated,

687
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:34,850
it looks smooth and that,
um,

688
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,710
I felt like he looked really nervous.
I said he looked nervous as fuck and I

689
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:38,970
said,
I don't want to jump to conclusions.

690
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,640
He might just be doing a lot of cardio,
which is possible because one of all

691
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:44,740
those big problems,
and Dana White,

692
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,540
he said this is a perfect way of
describing it,

693
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,360
that all of those,
the very best fighter ever for two

694
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:52,150
rounds.
And then he would always gas and then he

695
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:54,220
would always sorta coast like Ricardo
Lamas.

696
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:55,840
He'd beat the shit out.
Alarmists the first round,

697
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,480
the end of the fifth round,
Ricardo Lamas was on top grounding

698
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:01,000
pounding dominic to mark comics.
Same Goddamn thing.

699
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,530
Well,
he was on the antibiotics with harmonic,

700
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:03,640
but yeah,
for staff.

701
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:05,530
I think so.
That was,

702
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,290
I never heard that he was,
when he fought harmonic,

703
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,710
he had just done,
he'd had staff need done.

704
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,653
Google that,
Jane.

705
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,930
That's true.
Um,

706
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,281
but,
but,

707
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,210
but,
well,

708
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,150
how about Luke rockhold won the fucking
title unbelieved on,

709
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,090
on antibiotics.
Did any protocols when his first match

710
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:23,300
and Ebi yesterday,
um,

711
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,690
he had,
who's dying of staff days in the

712
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:26,200
hospital.

713
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,450
It's their mother and he was in the
hospital for a week.

714
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,590
Like denny was dying on stat from staff
just to come to you surprised by the,

715
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:34,300
by Luke's domination.
Like that.

716
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,090
Totally surprised.
Totally surprised by a lot of thing and

717
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:39,190
we totally should get to that.
But um,

718
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,270
I,
I don't know if Aldo had concentrated

719
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:46,750
more on cardio or if he had gotten off
steroids,

720
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,720
but I do know,
and this is nonspecific,

721
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:55,230
there's a huge problem in mma with
steroids is a huge problem and that

722
00:30:56,441 --> 00:31:01,441
problem is being cut away like cancer by
this new program by Jeff Novitsky.

723
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,460
I also know that they tried to test all
don't camp and all those people had the

724
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:08,920
cops pulled on these people.
They wanted to get him kicked out of the

725
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:10,890
country.
They were trying to de de de,

726
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,660
de port them out of the country.
Then when they finally did give him a

727
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:16,870
urine sample,
he tripped and spilled his pice.

728
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,030
Is this not weird to anyone?
That's insane.

729
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,040
Doesn't take them a true way.
Spilled piss in my entire career.

730
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,910
I have.
The thing is his cups all the time.

731
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,910
It does get feathery.
All there was covering from an

732
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:33,160
undisclosed infection.
It was on antibiotic hall.

733
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:34,390
Callan,
hey guys,

734
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,520
come on guys.
The thing is I should know that it

735
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:39,430
doesn't take away anything that all was
done in his career.

736
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,830
Even if he is,
I'm not saying he's never failed a test.

737
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:42,520
So who knows.
Right.

738
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,410
We needed Lance Armstrong.
There you go.

739
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:48,220
All insane is all I'm saying is it
seemed with Lance Armstrong steam was

740
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:50,470
baseball.
He was exonerated.

741
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,570
He stolen the pitch on some shit.
Yeah,

742
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,080
everyone's on some shit.
Alright,

743
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,990
great.
No matter whether he's honored or not,

744
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:57,450
he's greatness.
This I'll,

745
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,430
Josie Aldo is one of the greatest pound
for pound fighters ever.

746
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,323
For sure.
Ever,

747
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,050
ever.

748
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,890
And to go on a 10 year run like that,
you don't in the UFC has said like,

749
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,930
hey,
you know he'd played it safe and he goes

750
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:09,040
to decisions.
You shouldn't do that.

751
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,360
But you know what else?
He's great.

752
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,970
But here's the thing,
he fucking wins.

753
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:16,300
Yes.
And like him risking losing,

754
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,450
like to unload on somebody like Uriah
Faber did.

755
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,300
Like uriah faber flat,
Frankie signs and your riots sort of

756
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:25,450
faded in that fight.
But the reason why faded is cause he

757
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:28,020
landed a bomb on frankie signs,
rocked them.

758
00:32:28,021 --> 00:32:31,720
And then when after I'm blue as load,
that fucking frankie signs guy,

759
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:36,580
he's tough as shit cause that this is
the 35 year old guy who's got like one

760
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,470
other fight in the UFC.
Maybe two.

761
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,820
Okay.
And then he's fighting Uriah

762
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:42,170
motherfucking favor.
Right.

763
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,780
Okay.
Was this crazy?

764
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,260
It was ranked 13 yeah.
Yeah.

765
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:49,220
I mean it's your why of Faber is like
one of the most experienced guys and one

766
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:51,320
of the best guys ever did not win a UFC
title.

767
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,820
Right?
He's only lost title fight.

768
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,681
Yeah.
So he,

769
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:57,950
he bombs on this guy and then nails him
with a knee to the,

770
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,260
I think it was a temple tart.
Some parts,

771
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:02,780
some bad.
I mean the kids all over the place and

772
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:06,170
your rise unloading on him and that
somehow the guy survives and then your

773
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:07,880
eyes like he's like,
oh boy.

774
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,870
You know,
he's like,

775
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:13,430
she's took a deep breath and kind of
looked at the clock is like you know

776
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:15,950
better than anybody that when you unload
like that,

777
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,010
that's never how anybody fights.
So when you unload like that,

778
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:21,290
you're going all in,
you're pushing all your chips and this

779
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,910
guy just pulls out four aces.
You're like,

780
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,700
boom,
bitch,

781
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,371
Connie,
what happens?

782
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:27,240
That's when you got to use carbon.
No,

783
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,000
perfect one sample palm strike.
You guys never use plumbing skit from

784
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:33,530
the huddle.
How about your eye goes,

785
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,880
our friendships done.

786
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,410
Tj dillashaw,
your Ryan White.

787
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,280
He was saying,
he was saying it's going to be like

788
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:41,740
rocky and the good guys.
Gonna wait,

789
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,620
wait.
Why?

790
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,790
What happened?
Him and Tj,

791
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:46,250
they had a falling out because tj went
to muscle farm.

792
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,790
The muscle farm offered him,
but I don't follow the will.

793
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:52,380
The reason,
one of the reasons why Tj went to muscle

794
00:33:52,381 --> 00:33:54,080
farm is two reasons.
One money,

795
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:55,640
but to Duane Ludwig.
Yeah.

796
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,360
Duane Ludwig and Tj have a fantastic
working relationship.

797
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,340
Duane Ludwig is a fucking,
he's got some crazy mental disorder that

798
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:07,490
makes him concentrate on fighting every
single second of every day.

799
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,300
I think he's got a running thing.
I think he could be hanging out with his

800
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,920
wife,
going to the movies,

801
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:16,070
eating dinner,
talking about baseball in the back of

802
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,900
his head.
He's watching counter,

803
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:19,820
right hands,
leg kicks,

804
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:22,430
movement session.
He looks the rain man of fighting.

805
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,420
He's obsessed,
man.

806
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:25,820
He's obsessed.
And that's exactly what you want from a

807
00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:28,670
trainer.
Tj recognizes that and his personality

808
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:31,880
and Dwayne's personality jive.
Whereas your bias personality and

809
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:34,250
Dwayne's personality,
we're water and oil.

810
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:37,850
They fucking clashed hardcore and you're
Ryan never wanted to have anything to do

811
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:38,511
with that guy.
He's like,

812
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:41,870
fuck this guy.
And dwayne and him didn't get along and

813
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,890
Dwayne was like,
fuck him.

814
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:44,950
And they argued about stupid shit and
you know,

815
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,240
here's something that a lot of people
don't know.

816
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,710
There was a point in time where we were
considering buying that Jim on it and I

817
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:53,060
was going to be on it.
Yeah,

818
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:55,310
we're gonna,
we're gonna buy the ultimate training

819
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:57,690
center.
We were thinking about buying it and

820
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,790
making that team like an audit team and
we were talking to those guys about how

821
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:04,010
to make this work,
but it was right when they were starting

822
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:04,700
to go at it.

823
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,280
When dwayne and Uriah,
we're trying to go at it and we were

824
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:08,150
like,
first of all,

825
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:10,310
it was the like,
I was going to have to figure out like

826
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:12,920
how,
how would I do this and be impartial.

827
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,810
It's very difficult to do.
You know,

828
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,440
you're like,
I love cowboy serone I fucking love that

829
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:19,580
guy.
He's awesome.

830
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,230
I'm I hanging out with them when I'm in
Denver.

831
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,240
He's the best,
the best.

832
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,210
It's just amazing personality.
He's just,

833
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:29,210
I just want to hug them when I see you
want to be around the couch and he's

834
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:33,080
just a true bad ass too.
And I respect,

835
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,260
I deeply respect Hoffeld dosantos I
think he's a great fighter and he's a

836
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:37,280
great guy.
I went to our,

837
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,760
he,
he's very friendly and,

838
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,301
uh,
you know,

839
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:40,134
I was,
um,

840
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,730
who,
who was telling me that,

841
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:42,570
uh,
there were,

842
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,670
um,
oh the fuck was it?

843
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,500
God dammit,
I'm drawing a blank.

844
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,540
Someone was telling me that they,
they were,

845
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,880
um,
hanging out with him somewhere and he

846
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:54,270
was like helping them out and telling
them where the best places top deal with

847
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:55,170
me in Brazil.
That's right.

848
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,080
Thank Jesus Christ.
Oh my God,

849
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,390
I feel like the nicest guy ever.
He's going to do,

850
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,650
you'll see now with them every now and
then.

851
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,470
He's a great guy,
but so I have to be completely

852
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:05,580
impartial.
You know,

853
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,950
I have to,
I have to figure out how to separate

854
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:10,350
myself.
But is it even,

855
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,950
can you even ask,
can I ask myself to do that?

856
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:17,760
If I owned a gym and I had fighters who
were fighting against guys who are a

857
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:20,550
team that you own basically.
And you know what I mean?

858
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:23,190
I don't know man.
Everybody always thinks that they're

859
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:24,870
always gonna feel.
People are always gonna feel like you're

860
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:26,400
biased in some way or another.

861
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,300
If they find,
if they,

862
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:30,180
if you're rooting for,
if they're rooting for someone and

863
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:32,640
you're calling the fight against that
person,

864
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:34,240
that they're rooting for it,
they're going to consider it.

865
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:35,880
It some sort of,
I've never seen,

866
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:39,150
I've never heard you be biased.
I'm todd [inaudible].

867
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,020
You are like,
fuck that Russia shit.

868
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,860
Damn dumb ass down.
No one's ever been harder than you.

869
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,900
It's the hardest,
hardest fights ever to call.

870
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,330
Cause like,
you know,

871
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,010
I can do it when you lost a travis,
like I was

872
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,880
broken up man.
It was hard.

873
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,470
Turns to me he's had at least he didn't
get hurt.

874
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,030
That's the important thing.
It was hard.

875
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,860
That was hard.
Kallan was right behind me.

876
00:37:01,861 --> 00:37:05,430
He was sitting right behind me.
That was a hard [inaudible] he came in

877
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,220
here like close.
Yeah.

878
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,880
Well it was close.
It was super close fight.

879
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,210
But again,
you know it's,

880
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:21,110
it's a tricky but so this is all we were
just talking about Duane and Uriah like

881
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:23,060
they just didn't get along,
which is totes.

882
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,120
It's so,
it's such a fucking bummer because if

883
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:29,910
their personalities did like,
I almost felt like man,

884
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:32,880
if there's a middleman here that comes
in and sorts all this debt,

885
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:34,530
like what did,
I felt like what is the issue?

886
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:37,590
Is this a financial thing?
Personality things,

887
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,870
two Alphas personalities,
guys,

888
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,460
guys who get territorial,
guys who want your [inaudible] really

889
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:49,130
strong personality and he's also like
super organized and successful.

890
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,550
Super successful and super focused.
Like your Riaa is like,

891
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,890
you know,
he's a very admirable person.

892
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,940
Like when you watch like how he conducts
business and also look at the tight knit

893
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:02,300
bond that he's created with his team.
Yeah.

894
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,740
You know,
you only create that kind of a bond when

895
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,430
you are that kind of a leader,
you know,

896
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,240
and that's what he is.
And so for him,

897
00:38:09,241 --> 00:38:12,960
when Tj took off and went to this muscle
farm camp,

898
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:14,670
I'm sure that it was like a knife in his
back.

899
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,510
Fucking devastating.
Well Tj and your I should fight no

900
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:20,520
matter what happens with Tj Dominick
Cruz,

901
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,710
that fight has to happen.
I really think so.

902
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:25,290
I'm so excited about teachers'
excitement of this.

903
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,660
The back story.
We love a good story.

904
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,920
You know what I'm saying?
It'd be so don't we do that dominick

905
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:34,350
Cruz,
tj fight might be one of the greatest

906
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:37,510
fights.
Dominic Dominic would have dominic wins

907
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,410
and then Uriah and Tj fight for a number
one contender status.

908
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,840
But your eye in dominic have a history
too.

909
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,420
That's not a bad story either.
It's not a bad story.

910
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,440
Can you,
can you think of another more compelling

911
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:54,190
contender that would be ahead of your
Riaa besides Tj?

912
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:57,130
Like,
say if Dominic Beats Tj or,

913
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,570
well,
whoever wins that fight,

914
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,780
who would be next in line for the title
instead of Uriah.

915
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,690
Who else?
10 and brow

916
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,570
isn't it?
He'll make the argument,

917
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,610
he could make the argument but he's have
to win again.

918
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,080
He got destroyed and his last fight,
Tj didn't destroyed teenagers,

919
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:16,240
didn't just beat him.
He lit him up like a Christmas tree,

920
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,220
covered them with gasoline and lit them
on fire and drug testing and through him

921
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,930
threw him off a cliff.
I mean it was,

922
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:24,580
no,
there was not a moment in that fight

923
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,240
other than the first initial exchanges
where he was like fired up and it's like

924
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:32,500
bully beach,
Tj and dominick Cruz have such similar

925
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:33,610
styles.
I almost feel like,

926
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,450
like dwayne watched a lot of dominick
Cruz fights and kind of,

927
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,250
I mean as,
am I wrong about that?

928
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,520
Well there's a lot of guys that are
employing that sort of neo footwork

929
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:45,580
movement now,
but I think dominick was the best at it,

930
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:48,460
the earliest he's,
he's so elusive.

931
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:49,480
It's like,
so like,

932
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:54,090
like you get used to a guy like here's a
different weight class but is a

933
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,740
quintessential like Thai style.

934
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,320
The style striker,
like thiago Silva stands right in front

935
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:02,110
of you and he's got that fucking rhythm
and he's,

936
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:02,944
you know,
he's not,

937
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,190
not mobile.
And then you got the complete polar

938
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:07,720
opposite,
which is like connor.

939
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,020
Connor is like,
like when you see conor fighting Aldo,

940
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:14,080
he slide Nin he slide now.
Like he's very difficult to judge,

941
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,660
in my opinion,
the best ever at that is dominic

942
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,800
dominic's all over the place.
Like he's fucking move in a sliding.

943
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:23,110
He's over here,
he's over there and you're trying to

944
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:26,560
figure out when you can uncork a punch,
like a good luck time.

945
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:28,120
And that guy,
have you ever had a conversation with

946
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,170
dominic?
Very,

947
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:32,050
very smart guy.
Have the highest MMA Iq I've ever seen.

948
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,100
Wow.
I agree with you.

949
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,770
I agree with you.
I'm saying it was my favorite out of

950
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:39,060
those guys that breaks down fights and
analyzes what went wrong,

951
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,230
why it went wrong and he's a real
student.

952
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,100
Uh,
one time,

953
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,850
uh,
dominic and chill.

954
00:40:43,851 --> 00:40:47,680
Sonya and myself went to unbreakable gym
and we were trading with jails before

955
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:51,340
Charles fight and Jon Jones and we
training jail and dominic was breaking

956
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:52,270
things down.
I was like,

957
00:40:52,271 --> 00:40:56,140
Holy Fuck,
God gets an oracle can also,

958
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:00,040
he's had all this time,
he's had all his time while he's been

959
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,580
injured to think and work on things and
he's not,

960
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:06,360
it's not like you stopped paying
attention to mma I keys,

961
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,680
he's been focusing on it.
Whereas,

962
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,660
you know,
if he hadn't been injured,

963
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:12,340
he'd be in camps.
Getting ready for fights,

964
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:17,260
like almost might've benefited his MMA
Iq to have that time off and to be

965
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:21,050
obsessed with returning about what he's
gonna have his hands full kcls.

966
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,050
And you've had that surgery.
Can you get,

967
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,770
when you get acl surgery nowadays,
is it,

968
00:41:26,771 --> 00:41:29,560
is your knee as strong?
Because I'm strong,

969
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,830
it's stronger,
stronger,

970
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,440
stronger,
quite a bit stronger.

971
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,010
My,
my right knee has a cadaver graft.

972
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,610
It had a cadaver graft.
And what the cadaver graft does is they

973
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:43,670
take an Achilles tendon,
which is way thicker than a regular acl,

974
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,920
and then they put it in place and then
your body re proliferates.

975
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,030
That acts as a scaffolding and you're
not stem cells.

976
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:57,370
Your body grows like they restat,
they connect it and your body starts

977
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,280
putting blood through it and then
growing new tissue.

978
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,690
Wow.
So your,

979
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,860
your acl becomes your own.
Like I had a,

980
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,650
I had a cadaver graft,
but those cells are not cadaver cells

981
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:10,720
that are in my,
near south.

982
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,670
Those are myself,
but it's way thicker than it would have

983
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:16,160
been.
But Donald 150% stronger than

984
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,023
[inaudible].
So,

985
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,010
so that,
that's the case maybe with Dominic's

986
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,260
knees,
he tore the same one twice and then

987
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:25,460
toward the other one he taught tour one
twice toward the other one and he tore

988
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:28,700
his groin and he broke both his hands.

989
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,291
He's,
he's,

990
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:31,790
he's a fragile God.
Like when I had him on,

991
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,880
I'm one of those UFC interview shows.
He was joking around.

992
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:36,140
I mean,
show me scars in his hands.

993
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:37,370
He's got,
I got a bitch hands.

994
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,460
It's just,
it is what it was like.

995
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,510
This Guy Greg Cook,
this Guy Greg Cook who has full bar,

996
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,280
like the NFL now has what's called a
full body screening or some functional

997
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:48,800
body screening.
The UFC has got that now too with their

998
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:51,410
new camp because they were finding they
would bring him in and he would find

999
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:54,080
that that is all amazing athletes.
And then one guy kept tearing,

1000
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:58,370
he'd run and he kept tearing his groin.
He kept telling the tenant had attached

1001
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:02,390
his like to his pelvis to his quad and
it couldn't figure it out.

1002
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:04,670
And he's the guy who comes in and goes,
I know what the problem is.

1003
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,030
You're off balance.
One side of your body is stronger than

1004
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:10,580
the other and that's a huge issue.
It's really common.

1005
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:13,490
Yeah.
So now the training centers around,

1006
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:17,000
you know,
basically finding out where you're weak

1007
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,150
and you know,
you very common around that with

1008
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,300
pictures cause you know you throw in
with one arm.

1009
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,610
Yeah.
And kickers like nfl kickers,

1010
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:29,060
they have real problems with that.
Like back problems because you're always

1011
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:32,310
kicking that one leg in the same way.
For Dominic though.

1012
00:43:32,311 --> 00:43:35,420
It's years of wrestling and he's a
champion for ever.

1013
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,310
He's only had one loss.
He's up.

1014
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,380
It adds up.
You can chalk it up to inbounds.

1015
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:45,190
Nomad is Uriah.
Uriah caught him with a good team so me.

1016
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:46,700
Well you're right,
it gets your neck.

1017
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,020
You know,
he fucking giant people often get done

1018
00:43:49,021 --> 00:43:50,630
the cruise beat,
Demetrius Johnson,

1019
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,660
he beat Dj dam but they also forget that
was one day they didn't live anywhere

1020
00:43:56,451 --> 00:43:57,320
near Matt Hume.

1021
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,470
He was coming into town once a week.
This is a fact.

1022
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,710
He wasn't training like the,
the Ian Mccall fight was the big

1023
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,710
turnaround for Dj.
And I had him on the podcast.

1024
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:08,030
He talked about it cause he,
you know,

1025
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,130
Ian fucking rattled his cage and it hurt
him.

1026
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,930
He had vertigo after that fight.
It was pretty fucked up and I'm mad

1027
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:16,250
human pulled him aside and said,
look,

1028
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,890
you've got to stop fucking around.
Like we're going to do this.

1029
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:21,740
Or you should maybe get an education.
Like you should figure out what the fuck

1030
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:23,210
you going to do with your life,
but this ain't it.

1031
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,270
Like you've got to figure it out.
And so he went all in,

1032
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:30,080
moved near the the gym and now he's here
five days a week and look at him now.

1033
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:32,180
He's,
I'm just saying dumb dum ba dum

1034
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,330
different one though.
And different weight classes.

1035
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,190
Just shots.
Some different guy now do dimitris at

1036
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:40,130
tiny guy.
He's much smaller than not.

1037
00:44:40,131 --> 00:44:41,940
When it calms tiny too.
He is thin,

1038
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,050
but he's taller and longer and bigger
and like one 35 is a cut for him.

1039
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:49,920
Demetrius Johnson is to put a rock in
his pocket to make one 35 wow.

1040
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,320
They got different fighters.
Completely different.

1041
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:54,510
Totally different fighters.
They're much better now,

1042
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,000
but just seeing them on both of them are
better now.

1043
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,700
I'm fucking so excited for that fight.
I'm going to be there.

1044
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:01,170
It's in January.
Boston.

1045
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,110
Yep.
Tj motherfucker.

1046
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,690
Are You doing the Florida court tomorrow
or next week,

1047
00:45:05,691 --> 00:45:06,000
right?
Yeah.

1048
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,080
Yeah.
This weekend,

1049
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,190
Friday,
Saturday,

1050
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:09,150
whatever it is.
Yeah.

1051
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:10,380
That's a good barn.
That's a good card.

1052
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,330
Really good cuts.
Our lawsky versus a,

1053
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:14,700
I mean not our Lasky Junior dos Santos
vs.

1054
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:19,080
Alistair overeem was on that car to,
Ooh Johnson.

1055
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,560
Michael Johnson versus Nate Diaz.
Juries.

1056
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:24,600
On the flight.
Go to my church.

1057
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,460
I was miles jury down to one 45 now.
Yeah.

1058
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,140
Hafez dos Anjos and the size of those
not just head.

1059
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,780
Look at that head.
Yeah,

1060
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,640
my Lord.
Jury.

1061
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,340
Yeah.
There's Jerry Olivia the fucking fight.

1062
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,130
CB doorway.
Oh my God.

1063
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:43,290
I don't even know.
That was the only card.

1064
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,850
Hey,
nate said it.

1065
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,490
What do you want to tell him?
Stop.

1066
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,550
I love them.
It's been rough watching him.

1067
00:45:50,551 --> 00:45:52,530
The last few fights.
Do you think CBA,

1068
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,490
CBA just chases after him,
puts it to him.

1069
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,570
He kind of got it right.
Yeah.

1070
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:58,610
That's what they do.
They'll tell you,

1071
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,630
beat nate,
get on his back foot and throw bombs.

1072
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:05,930
He just seems like he's absorbed so much
punishment after the law over the last

1073
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,983
few years.
Bomber man.

1074
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,840
It is Obama and he's been on it.
He was on the street until he got dealt

1075
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:11,460
with.
Yeah,

1076
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:16,490
I mean cb the Oto beat him.
I heard him at that body kick bad and

1077
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:17,700
uh,
who else beat him?

1078
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,250
The Doberman Nodo really fucked him up.
That was,

1079
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:22,050
that's what ended his streak.
That left kick,

1080
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:24,930
ma'am,
that left kick of Leah's cards and super

1081
00:46:24,931 --> 00:46:25,500
interesting man.

1082
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,930
Dos Santos over him.
I don't know what to tell you again.

1083
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:31,290
Testing's going to be a mother fucker.
I said what you think a hundred percent

1084
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,790
yeah.
Fight should have happened three years

1085
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,830
ago when it was all fucking the wild,
wild west.

1086
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,170
I don't think.
I thought they didn't.

1087
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:39,120
They fight the fuck.
Is this the person they're fighting?

1088
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:39,990
No.
Brian,

1089
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,700
this is the first time they're not.
He know so much about mark harmonic

1090
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,890
versus Josie.
Hey,

1091
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,310
I'm making a call.
I'll tell you something else.

1092
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,560
I'll tell you something else I'd like to
see.

1093
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:50,760
You're going to,
the guys are gonna Laugh at me.

1094
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,030
I like to see something I'd like to see.
Don't say boyfriend.

1095
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,710
I'm going to say don't say something
stupid.

1096
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,660
I'd like to see my boyfriend and he is
my boyfriend,

1097
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,900
Luke rockhold and my best friend,
cause I've had dinner with them and hung

1098
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:01,734
out with him.

1099
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,250
Uh,
I'd like to see him fight Jon Jones.

1100
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:07,870
I said it,
but he,

1101
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,790
he's just won the middleweight tiny.
I know what he won,

1102
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,400
Bro.
You,

1103
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,920
can you ask him to leave?
Hey John.

1104
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,010
John is fantasy shit that you have in
your head?

1105
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,690
Yeah,
it is fantasy shits a stand on my head

1106
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,060
cause it's turning.
It's,

1107
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:26,430
you know when you see a Weidman versus
rockhold and then Weidman wanted to

1108
00:47:26,431 --> 00:47:28,860
fight Jon Jones for the light
heavyweight title.

1109
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,390
Yeah.
Weidman's movement wasn't the same.

1110
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:34,060
I weidman looked off to loss a lot of
weight.

1111
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:37,280
He was a in the one nineties in Hawaii
biblically on me like that.

1112
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,900
I don't think so.
It was a strategy where he said,

1113
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:41,734
I'm going to,
I'm going to,

1114
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,590
maybe he's on steroids.
Look,

1115
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,980
but that's just not the guy.

1116
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,820
I think what I'm saying,
I come in there,

1117
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:53,590
I'm going to be light.
I'm going to hit them with pace,

1118
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:54,311
uh,
cardio pace.

1119
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:56,610
I'm going to wear him down.
He did.

1120
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,120
I think he did do that.
I think that was,

1121
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,320
I mean he was throwing a lot of like,
not full power kicks to the body,

1122
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:04,030
but a lot of,
a lot of pressure,

1123
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,510
a lot of pressure with his grappling.
He just fucked up throwing that we'll

1124
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:09,760
kick stay in your lane.
Oh my God.

1125
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,550
Fuck you dude.
I was one of the biggest mistakes in the

1126
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:15,540
history of mma championship fights.
100% talking about it like,

1127
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,530
it's not like a mistake.
Like,

1128
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,560
you know,
you go through like throw a or leg kick

1129
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:22,030
and you get countered with the right
hand and get hurt.

1130
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:26,020
That's normal stuff.
This is a crazy acrobatic move

1131
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:29,640
that he's telling beach bar.

1132
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,530
Yeah,
he probably was right because that's

1133
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:35,350
what knocked out rockhold maybe thought
he's a sucker for wheel kicks.

1134
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,160
The grind is working for you when he's
taking him down and starting to work.

1135
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:41,440
Starting to weird lookout.
Especially like we knew luke was on

1136
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:42,620
antibiotics.
Fuck yeah,

1137
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,680
keep doing that.
But he didn't think he knew.

1138
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,650
He knew that Luke's pace was slowing
down.

1139
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:48,670
Right.
You could tell.

1140
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:52,330
I think what happened was he realized
that he was a lot stronger than Chris

1141
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:52,811
Weidman.
He's,

1142
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:54,970
he looked just stronger,
bigger,

1143
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,440
and I think he went,
and you know what?

1144
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,810
I wrestled with Cain Velasquez and,
and uh,

1145
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,980
Daniel Cormier,
I'm stronger and bigger than this guy.

1146
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,820
And that's what happened.
I think he just started.

1147
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:06,190
No,
there's something that happened at all.

1148
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:08,440
He caught him,
he made a mistake and he took him down

1149
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,760
the keys through a wheel kick and
literally gave his fucking body up.

1150
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,480
You get taken down and when rockhold
gets you on the ground,

1151
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:18,360
his fucking top games.
Nasty,

1152
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,590
super nasty.
And you saw it against Leo Machida.

1153
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:23,550
Like I would like to see rockhold in
just straight up Brazilian jujitsu

1154
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,100
competition.
I bet he is at a very high level mother

1155
00:49:26,101 --> 00:49:28,780
fucker.
I just think that that's why I'd like to

1156
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:31,120
see a rematch.
You say that kick doesn't happen.

1157
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:33,760
We've got a hell of a firefighter.
That's a hell of a fight anyway.

1158
00:49:33,761 --> 00:49:35,860
Cause that back kick that happened in
the third round.

1159
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,470
I mean this is a fourth round stop it
and I had at one to one.

1160
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:39,790
Yeah,
I did wonder one.

1161
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,860
It was a really good fight.
It's not like,

1162
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,610
you know,
Weidman came out guns blazing face first

1163
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:48,850
and rockhold connected with straight
left with like conor and Aldo.

1164
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:52,180
This is like a war.
And then at the end of the war,

1165
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,250
you know,
I mean rockhold got that advantage.

1166
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,830
Never let it go.
Adding Weidman in the face more.

1167
00:49:56,831 --> 00:49:59,650
I feel like he was,
I feel as though he was kind of standing

1168
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:02,510
on the edge of that pocket and he was,
he has hands down and I,

1169
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,080
I felt like rockhold seems so confident.
Maybe it was gas,

1170
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:07,780
but he looked,
he was just confident enough to just,

1171
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,630
he knew where the shots were coming in
and they would counter,

1172
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:13,660
he was hitting him in the face.
More Weidman was pressuring him and his

1173
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,690
kingdom,
his body,

1174
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:18,730
it put more pressure on him.
Really paying off to the body is thrown

1175
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,320
a lot of body.
So we're Luke's though.

1176
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,380
In the beginning of the fight,
they were hard.

1177
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:25,330
You're going to have to,
he who you didn't like laying to any

1178
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,820
flushing and cottey kicks hard.
God exert her cane side.

1179
00:50:28,821 --> 00:50:30,650
What does that look like?
It must be just one of the hardest

1180
00:50:30,651 --> 00:50:32,270
kickers in the division for sure.

1181
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,670
Rock holds long.
And you know what's interesting when I

1182
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:36,260
talked to Javier Mendez,
I said,

1183
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:38,450
did he have a traditional martial arts
background?

1184
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:39,140
He goes,
nope.

1185
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,670
He came to me when he was 17 and I'm
like,

1186
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,830
that's crazy.
Yeah.

1187
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,950
Because when you watch like the
flexibility and dexterity,

1188
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:49,910
like the looseness of his legs,
like when he throws that question mark

1189
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:53,840
kick off the front leg,
he's so fucking Lou serone style.

1190
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:54,920
Yeah.
It's like,

1191
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,290
like ceremonies had more time for
fucking years and you look at Rocco's

1192
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,430
genetics,
his dad was a professional basketball

1193
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:03,380
player.
His brother's a professional surfer.

1194
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,510
Have this monster just looming.
Wayne,

1195
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:09,630
do you find something?
He found his calling him and me at 17

1196
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,770
what we get,
I think what we're starting to see is

1197
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:14,330
we're getting guys who are martial
artists,

1198
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:17,240
but they're really good athletes and
that's who's taking over Holly Holm.

1199
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,680
Jon Jones,
freak athlete.

1200
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,940
John Jones [inaudible] think you're
totally right.

1201
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,610
Rockhold freak athlete.
I think you're totally right.

1202
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,040
I think,
um,

1203
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,920
but it's just so shocking to me out of
all those that I see.

1204
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,720
Well,
holly obviously has a long extensive

1205
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:35,540
kickboxing background under winkeljohn
has a fantastic trainer,

1206
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:38,360
but the thing that freaks me out the
most about rockhold is the,

1207
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,280
the,
the flexibility and dexterity of his

1208
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:43,460
legs that takes so long to develop that
kind of whip.

1209
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,560
You know,
like his kicks aren't just hard.

1210
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:49,310
Like Weidman has strong kicks,
there's strong like he throws him,

1211
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:53,120
but there's a stiffness to him that
rockwell doesn't have.

1212
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,880
Rock holds got like a taekwondo thing
going on.

1213
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:57,770
Big,
big fucks up.

1214
00:51:57,771 --> 00:52:01,370
He's a fucking business.
He was just 16 and and San Jose when we

1215
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:02,360
were hanging out,
I said,

1216
00:52:02,361 --> 00:52:03,200
how much do you weigh?
He was like,

1217
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:04,910
sure was 16 of course I did.

1218
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,760
I took them down and in your face I took
him in and I took him in.

1219
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:10,580
But don't kid yourself.
Had My hand on his back couple times.

1220
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:15,470
Talk this track.
Brian came back from hanging out with

1221
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:17,330
Lewis,
had got his haircut just like him.

1222
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:18,620
I went,
the fuck you doing?

1223
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:20,080
He goes,
sounds around luke.

1224
00:52:20,081 --> 00:52:22,580
So I wanted to get my hair cut like
you're 48 copy.

1225
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:26,900
And I look him in the eye and I went
exactly like loop when we go to a bar.

1226
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:29,270
And I looked at my one that is and we
caught eyes and I looked at him,

1227
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,380
I went,
I tell Ya.

1228
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:31,870
And he goes,
he smiling.

1229
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,700
He went six three and I go,
of course you are.

1230
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,930
And I looked at his hair and I go,
I don't want to take you to go deeper

1231
00:52:38,931 --> 00:52:41,420
with your voice.
We had a moment,

1232
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:41,630
guys.

1233
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,400
We had a moment here that I went right
to super cuts for $12 and I go,

1234
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,520
oh my God.
And I looked through the camera picture

1235
00:52:49,521 --> 00:52:53,240
of Luke rockhold that you fucking piss
my and fingers.

1236
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,060
My friend Tarik who trains luke goes,
hey,

1237
00:52:56,061 --> 00:52:58,160
counts here.
I think you'd would suck luke stick.

1238
00:52:58,161 --> 00:53:02,150
We asked them did
you can take I think out of that

1239
00:53:02,151 --> 00:53:04,760
sentence.
All right,

1240
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:06,650
I'll do it just as a goof.
Don't tell anybody.

1241
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,700
What a shocking moment.
What is shocking turn of event that one

1242
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:13,910
wheel kick changes the entire fight.
She see Chris crying.

1243
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,110
Yeah.
It was also the,

1244
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,940
the pressure that rockhold put on him,
I think surprised Weidman,

1245
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:23,090
like when rockhold mounted him and for
sure not gonna eat those on.

1246
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,980
I would never eat those when brock hold
mounted him

1247
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,050
and,
and he couldn't get them off of him.

1248
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:29,790
I think he was fucking shocked,
especially when,

1249
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,830
you know,
lyman has really good Jitsu and when he

1250
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:35,880
felt rock holds pressure,
it's first time he's ever been taken

1251
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:37,800
down.
First Time it's backspin on the mat and

1252
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:38,460
he's like,
no,

1253
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,470
he's strong.
He's stronger than,

1254
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:44,310
he had a technique to stronger t his
technique was superior.

1255
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,640
It was amazing to see.
Yeah,

1256
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,330
it was amazing to see.
He's a fucking beast and I think

1257
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:52,050
there's,
you can't underestimate the benefit of

1258
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:54,660
training with Daniel Cormay and Cain
Velasquez,

1259
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,900
the heavyweight,
the former heavyweight champion and the

1260
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,900
light heavyweight champion.
They're going to ask her if there's a

1261
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:03,360
chance they could have the heavyweight
champ light heavyweight champ,

1262
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:06,150
and now middleweight champ.
All training together all came up

1263
00:54:06,151 --> 00:54:07,680
together.
How crazy is that?

1264
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,860
It is a possibility,
but the light heavyweight,

1265
00:54:09,861 --> 00:54:11,930
you got to put a little asterisk next to
it.

1266
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,080
I'm just saying right now,
son.

1267
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:15,440
I'm just saying right now you gotta pull
astro,

1268
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,690
big astrid analytic.
Especially now.

1269
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:21,710
Now that John's trite,
I thought left and 600 pounds,

1270
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,810
Graham and I watch him.
I watch him throw my phone away,

1271
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,030
run out the door.
I don't want to be around.

1272
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:29,460
It's crazy.
John's a monster right now.

1273
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:31,860
He's,
he's also a monster that's overcoming a

1274
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:34,650
really bad moment in his life and he's
on the straight and now,

1275
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:37,380
now he's on the path.
That's care while he should be.

1276
00:54:37,381 --> 00:54:39,150
And those are good things to happen to
you.

1277
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,350
You know,
sometimes,

1278
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,540
you know I've said this before,
but I'll say it again.

1279
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,600
I love a comeback story.
I fucking,

1280
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,840
I like a guy who,
who does the right thing and gets it all

1281
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:52,650
together and I love that.
But I also like a guy who fucks his life

1282
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:56,790
up and brings it all together and love
those stories though.

1283
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,830
Like I,
I don't think John should be someone who

1284
00:54:58,831 --> 00:55:00,240
is not,
you know what I'm saying?

1285
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,270
Like do all this stuff is great,
but be the heel man,

1286
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:06,630
be the fucking joker,
the UFC and fucks to destroy.

1287
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:09,390
He wants to be Jon Jones.
I don't think John Thinks of himself as

1288
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:11,130
a bad guy and I don't think he is a bad
guy.

1289
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,790
I think he's a young guy who's trying to
have fun and he's made some mistakes.

1290
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,050
That's what I think.
I don't think he's a bad person to

1291
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,800
person.
I don't think he's a bad person.

1292
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:22,830
I think he's a far cry from Holly Holm.
Yeah,

1293
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,640
you're right.
It's a holiday for me.

1294
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,790
Home is the perfect represent.
I talked to her after the fight.

1295
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:33,000
Nice person of all time after the,
oh she might be easily,

1296
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,820
I talked to her after the fight this
weekend and you know we were talking,

1297
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:38,490
hanging out her and her husband,
which I just said congratulations.

1298
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:39,420
How's it feel?
She's like,

1299
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:40,860
it does.
It still feels weird.

1300
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,510
It doesn't feel real.
I'm doing so many.

1301
00:55:42,511 --> 00:55:44,280
She goes,
but I don't even want to think about it.

1302
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:45,780
She goes,
I just want to get back to training

1303
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,540
cause I don't want to get a big head and
you know,

1304
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:50,430
and she's,
she knows the traps and we were talking

1305
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:52,140
about the fight and she was,
you know what I'm saying?

1306
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,033
She said,
look,

1307
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,100
the reality is what happened tonight to
Josie,

1308
00:55:56,101 --> 00:55:58,650
all that could have happened to me.
It can happen to anybody and she goes,

1309
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:00,570
you get caught with a punch and you get
knocked out.

1310
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,300
It's happened.
She's been in the sport too long I think

1311
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:06,360
to get a big head.
I think she realizes the traps and she's

1312
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:09,930
been fighting for world champions before
so she doesn't want to fall in that same

1313
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:11,460
kind of Rut that Rhonda did.

1314
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,640
Also,
if you're going to give this fight to,

1315
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,360
let's say they do do it in July,
July,

1316
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:20,410
whatever the UFC 200 you give holly six
months to know exactly what Rhonda

1317
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:24,520
brings to the table and train for it.
Come up with a better game plan that she

1318
00:56:24,521 --> 00:56:27,610
had before and make sure that her
conditioning is on point,

1319
00:56:27,611 --> 00:56:31,360
makes your body's healthy,
rehabilitate any possible injuries she

1320
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:33,910
might've had assessed to make sure she
doesn't overtrain but you got to

1321
00:56:33,911 --> 00:56:35,380
remember Rhonda shooting movies.
Well,

1322
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:38,260
Holly Kia bud plant,
but when has anybody ever overtrained at

1323
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:41,050
Jackson Winklejohn there's super smart
about that kind of shit.

1324
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,140
Jackson is really fucking smart about
strategy.

1325
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,060
He's really smart about preparation.
They've got some hardcore training

1326
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:50,490
ethics in that gym.
Oh yeah,

1327
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:55,210
and of course you got Winkeljohn who's
Winkeljohn was a fantastic kickboxer.

1328
00:56:55,570 --> 00:57:00,570
He's a really good coach and Jackson is
a really good strategist and they've got

1329
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,380
excellent training partners and you've
got all this motivation about their

1330
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:05,830
lineup.

1331
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:06,940
You got Greg Jackson,
right?

1332
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:10,240
He's like the fucking Yoda of MMA.
He's been doing it forever.

1333
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:12,920
He's a genius game planner.
Then he got winkle John,

1334
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,760
who's a phenomenal coach obviously,
and then he got izzy,

1335
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,680
who does the wrestling,
does Jon Jones,

1336
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:19,940
Israel Martinez.
He's a motherfucker,

1337
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,770
Chicago man,
outstanding wrestling instructor and

1338
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,700
he's good friends with my buddy Justin
Milo's,

1339
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:26,060
who's my trainer.
Yeah.

1340
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,770
With all that experience game planning
for,

1341
00:57:28,771 --> 00:57:30,190
for somebody just to,
you know,

1342
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:33,050
it's becoming a,
what I love about mma now is it,

1343
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:36,760
it really is about your team,
like just the brains behind you as well.

1344
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,130
Just that strata has to be,
it has to be.

1345
00:57:39,131 --> 00:57:41,230
There are no lone wolves.
And you know,

1346
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:45,310
and I had a conversation with John
before he moved to Albuquerque.

1347
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:48,610
We had this conversation with may or may
not have been smuggled marijuana.

1348
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:51,800
And uh,
we were in my hotel room in Montreal and

1349
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:52,690
if he was,
you know,

1350
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,640
before he won the title,
like way before,

1351
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,750
and I said,
look dude,

1352
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,450
I go,
you're an incredibly talented guy,

1353
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,970
but you got to get all the right people.

1354
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,550
The only way to do it right,
you can't do it on your own because

1355
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:07,210
there's going to be a guy like you who's
also incredibly talented and that guys

1356
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:09,730
can have the best team African.
That guy's going to get the best

1357
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:12,580
training partners and that guy's going
to have the best strategist and that

1358
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:14,710
guy's going to beat you.
And you might just beat you by an edge,

1359
00:58:14,711 --> 00:58:18,190
but that edge you could have overcome if
you had all that same coaching.

1360
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:22,330
And I think a guy like John also,
he grew up with two super athlete

1361
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:24,010
brothers,
one older,

1362
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:27,460
one younger freaks.
And I think he recognizes that he's,

1363
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,340
he might be special compared to the
average person to his brother,

1364
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:35,260
not even in his own house.
His brother Arthur was doing mma.

1365
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:39,670
I on the side,
like while he was playing for the NFL

1366
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:40,930
and beaten John's ass job.

1367
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:43,630
John [inaudible],
he's a heavyweight champ in high school.

1368
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:44,230
His brother.
Yeah,

1369
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,890
just pressing the fuck out of John.
And then the youngest brothers,

1370
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,750
one of the best players in the NFL draft
pick.

1371
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,170
So I think I want an,
John had a unique point of view as to

1372
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:56,590
what freak athleticism really is and
about hard work and talent,

1373
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,453
you know?
And it's just,

1374
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:02,700
I think he just was getting by in the
UFC without having to go 100% as far as

1375
00:59:04,061 --> 00:59:07,060
his training and his preparation.
Hundreds going to be horrific.

1376
00:59:07,061 --> 00:59:10,450
If he really does get it really good,
he'll be the best of all time.

1377
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,000
Didn't he say that?
Worst thing that happened to him was not

1378
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:15,100
training for Gustafson and beating him
anyway.

1379
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:18,220
And he said that that's probably,
he said it was trouble.

1380
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,800
He was just like,
God I can do this and still get away

1381
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:22,640
with you said it added and it was like
fuck it.

1382
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,870
I'll just keep doing it.
Just speed.

1383
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:28,070
This guy who trained the best campy that
are had in his life and I did nothing.

1384
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,410
Still beat him.
Such a freak.

1385
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:31,401
I'll tell you what,
how many,

1386
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:35,150
how many fighters going to incorporate a
movement coach now after connor doing

1387
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:39,130
all that shit out of them before I've
been obsessed with the Europa Pitaro for

1388
00:59:39,131 --> 00:59:40,430
I long time.
Well I'm,

1389
00:59:40,431 --> 00:59:44,120
I'm obsessed with him and I'm also
assessed with that guy that I'm Carlos

1390
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:46,580
condit uses.
He does that move nat stuff.

1391
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:48,620
I was watching a video on him training
today,

1392
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,650
see if he could find,
I think I appreciate I retweeted it.

1393
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,140
Um,
but he does all this crazy shit.

1394
00:59:54,141 --> 00:59:57,050
Like he's like doing chin ups with
trees,

1395
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:02,080
like hanging off of trees and he's doing
balance beam stuff and they're throwing

1396
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,420
sticks at him and he's catching them
while he's bouncing on stuff.

1397
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,160
He's Ah,
he's at common for stuff.

1398
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,190
He's even doing training specifically
for bow hunting.

1399
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:14,120
He's got like reps that he does for bow
hunting while he's squatting and

1400
01:00:14,121 --> 01:00:19,121
standing up while holding a bow posture,
like to try to like solidify his balance

1401
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:22,190
in precarious positions on hillsides.
Do that.

1402
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:25,250
Erin make,
here's like some of the weird stuff that

1403
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:29,510
Carlos is doing.
I mean Carlos is a really fucking smart

1404
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:31,220
guy.
Really articulate.

1405
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:34,290
So when he talked like let's play this
so we could hear it brings in the

1406
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:35,900
beginning,
bring it to the beginning.

1407
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:39,470
He's also been doing the same training
for about 20 years.

1408
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:41,840
So this must be nice.
Bring it to the beginning first please.

1409
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:43,510
There you go.

1410
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:46,570
Somebody is watching a fight.
There's the punches,

1411
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,740
the kicks,
the takedowns,

1412
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,070
the grappling.
But what people are less aware of is,

1413
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:54,310
you know,
for a fighter to be in correct position

1414
01:00:54,311 --> 01:00:59,311
to execute a strike effectively,
they need to have mastery of their

1415
01:00:59,741 --> 01:01:01,180
movement,
of their position,

1416
01:01:01,181 --> 01:01:04,990
of their balance.
I think that's really what separates the

1417
01:01:04,991 --> 01:01:07,800
elite fighters from somebody who's,
you know,

1418
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:12,910
good enough.
Irwin and I have been training for about

1419
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:14,920
seven to eight months.
People listening,

1420
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,520
students walking outdoors,
balancing on a log.

1421
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,090
I think one of the most challenging
things about training in nature is the

1422
01:01:22,091 --> 01:01:23,080
unpredictability.

1423
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,140
It's talking about hae suffered an acl,
meniscus tear while signing move.

1424
01:01:29,141 --> 01:01:34,141
Nat definitely accelerated my recovery
in that I was not only doing these

1425
01:01:34,931 --> 01:01:38,320
movements and these different stretches
in physical therapy,

1426
01:01:38,321 --> 01:01:43,321
but also in my training sessions.
When Irwin and myself started training,

1427
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:48,310
he looked at some of my previous fights
and he saw some things that my head

1428
01:01:48,311 --> 01:01:52,300
coach Greg Jackson saw independently.
They saw the same exact thing,

1429
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:56,140
but what was great with working with
Irwin and working in the movement that

1430
01:01:56,141 --> 01:02:01,120
program is he specifically had exercises
and drills to make those changes.

1431
01:02:01,121 --> 01:02:02,170
Whereas,
you know,

1432
01:02:02,171 --> 01:02:05,590
some of my other coaches saw that it
needed to be made but weren't sure how

1433
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:09,340
to get there.
This was extremely challenging for me.

1434
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:15,510
We're trying to relearn something that
we may have lost that as adults having

1435
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,120
sat in chairs or having laid on a bench
to do,

1436
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,990
you know,
very linear stuff like bench press or

1437
01:02:21,991 --> 01:02:23,130
squat or whatever.

1438
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:26,880
We've kind of lost that natural movement
ability and to gain it.

1439
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,860
It takes a lot of focus.
I come home after I trained with Irwin

1440
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:35,700
and I'm exhausted,
but as we go on and I have made these

1441
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:40,701
adjustments in my body has adapted.
It's less and less mentally taxing and

1442
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,860
you know,
more fun today.

1443
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:48,240
You know,
today we had a blast for my last fight,

1444
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,690
meaner when working specifically on
positioning of my body,

1445
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:55,950
lower level stability in a,
in a lower stance position of my feet,

1446
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,590
which helped me move forward and
backward quicker,

1447
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,470
which I think ultimately really helped
me with the victor,

1448
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:05,490
I was able to move in and out of range
effectively and land strikes and

1449
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,340
ultimately get the win.
Wow.

1450
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,720
I think that it's,
it's not just for elite athletes,

1451
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:11,190
it's for,
for anybody.

1452
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:11,731
It's,
you know,

1453
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:12,564
it's,
you know,

1454
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,020
anybody who wants to get in shape.
Anybody who wants to try something

1455
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:18,450
different.
Maybe you were in the lifting or you're

1456
01:03:18,451 --> 01:03:20,730
into yoga or you know,
any different thing.

1457
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,250
I hear all the time.
I'm plateauing,

1458
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,890
I'm strong,
but I can't move.

1459
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,470
I'm flexible,
but I have no power.

1460
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:33,000
Ultimately,
we're trying to be the most functional

1461
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:36,150
able bodied athlete,
person,

1462
01:03:36,151 --> 01:03:37,380
human that we can,

1463
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,770
boom.
Interesting Shit,

1464
01:03:39,771 --> 01:03:40,270
man.
Yeah,

1465
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:41,060
it is.
I'm gonna keep,

1466
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,490
I'm gonna stick with Yoga.
I love that guys ponytail though.

1467
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:47,600
I'm going,
I'm going out as a ponytail to his.

1468
01:03:47,601 --> 01:03:49,610
He does.
What's the fuck can we say?

1469
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,220
Don't ever say his name.
Ida again.

1470
01:03:52,221 --> 01:03:53,330
Like I said,
it is.

1471
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:55,550
He don't eat no pork spelled I d.
D.

1472
01:03:55,551 --> 01:03:58,190
O the ease.
You're calling me though.

1473
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,020
Does he have a ponytail?
She certainly does.

1474
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:02,370
He's a beautiful man.
I'm going to call him.

1475
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,100
Hey,
don't take,

1476
01:04:04,101 --> 01:04:06,850
don't put that his name in your mouth.
Said Itto be respectful.

1477
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:10,550
You don't had idle idle when you put my
second boyfriend name in your mom's

1478
01:04:10,551 --> 01:04:12,200
boyfriend.
I got two boyfriends and by the way,

1479
01:04:12,201 --> 01:04:13,370
cross counters,
the third boyfriend.

1480
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:16,490
It's very hard for me to choose.
You line all those guys up in a jail

1481
01:04:16,491 --> 01:04:17,960
cell.
I have no idea who I got to choose,

1482
01:04:17,961 --> 01:04:19,160
but I would do her laundry.

1483
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:21,620
I don't think you get to choose.
That's part of the program.

1484
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,350
I don't do.
I think that guy's cool.

1485
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,740
I think that stuff is cool.
I don't,

1486
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,700
you know,
for certain guys that you don't know

1487
01:04:28,701 --> 01:04:32,300
unless you're doing it.
I won't train with vegans portal.

1488
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,290
Wow.
Well here.

1489
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:37,110
Oh,
his hair's pretty lucky.

1490
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:39,080
Me Sir.
Pull them up please.

1491
01:04:39,081 --> 01:04:40,790
And show what he does.
Check this out.

1492
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,260
Why does he do,
is there any videos,

1493
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,470
great video know same shit.
No.

1494
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,270
How did,
how did um,

1495
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,320
fullscreen,
how did um,

1496
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,420
uh,
connor get connected to him?

1497
01:04:50,421 --> 01:04:51,620
I wonder,
uh,

1498
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,960
he said that he was very interested in
connor.

1499
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,430
He does some crazy stuff,
man.

1500
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:55,941
Well,
you know what?

1501
01:04:55,941 --> 01:04:59,570
This is really similar to [inaudible] as
far as I'm looking at a movement,

1502
01:04:59,571 --> 01:05:01,660
not your,
all the stuff that Hixon Gracie,

1503
01:05:01,661 --> 01:05:03,740
he was really into.
But watch what he does.

1504
01:05:03,741 --> 01:05:04,880
He,
this is interesting really,

1505
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:07,550
when you go back to,
cause like we thought of it as yoga and

1506
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:09,920
it is yoga,
but wow.

1507
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:11,640
Jesus Christ,
body it up.

1508
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:16,930
This dude is doing handstand pushups on
the edge of a table.

1509
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:17,890
Oh,
he's not,

1510
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:20,410
he's not dropping his head below the
table.

1511
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,360
Oh my God.
Look at these flips and shit.

1512
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:24,520
He's watched it.
It's what the fuck?

1513
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:27,010
Oh my God.
This guy's a super athlete.

1514
01:05:27,011 --> 01:05:28,480
Yes.
He is like what is his,

1515
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,480
uh,
on another video that's called white

1516
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:32,880
people breakdancing.
Oh,

1517
01:05:32,881 --> 01:05:33,270
this.
Oh,

1518
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:34,600
the same video.
It keeps going.

1519
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:37,270
So what is his background?
Is he like age?

1520
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,570
He's from Israel.
Look,

1521
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,510
he was a shit.
He was a couple era guy.

1522
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,180
Oh my God.
This is insane boxes.

1523
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:46,990
He does gymnastics.
He talks about how important rings are.

1524
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:49,000
You got to relax Brendan.
I won't relax.

1525
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,090
I flip that.
He's doing that flickers.

1526
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:53,750
Incredible.
Doing a one handed,

1527
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:54,581
uh,
well,

1528
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:58,650
she's essentially doing like Cirque de
Solei type shit dancing right there.

1529
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,220
Moving.
What he'll do,

1530
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:03,520
what he'll do is he'll make you,
he'll give you something to like,

1531
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:07,000
he'll make you catch a stick and he
gives you a toy and as soon as you get

1532
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:08,590
good at it,
he changed it up on you.

1533
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,960
So he always has you guessing.
He always has you kind of deal.

1534
01:06:10,961 --> 01:06:14,890
He had connor on the balance beam's in
Santa Monica the week before the fight,

1535
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:17,200
doing all sorts of crazy shit on the
beach.

1536
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:20,650
But look at this guy's fucking ability
to move his body.

1537
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:22,180
That's pretty shocked.
Buddied up.

1538
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,160
I'll tell you right now,
cause it movement patterns.

1539
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:26,440
He's right now,
connor wins with or without doing these

1540
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:27,580
moments.
Hey to tell him,

1541
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:30,120
know about that man.
I wonder if he's listen,

1542
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,800
depending on who he's fighting.
I think these benefits,

1543
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:35,410
these movements and learning how to move
your body like that,

1544
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:38,330
we'll definitely benefit him.
And benefits are all the,

1545
01:06:38,331 --> 01:06:41,500
keeps you from winning or losing.
This is incredible.

1546
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:43,060
This guy,
this is nuts,

1547
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:44,560
man.
This kind of physical strength.

1548
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,460
It's ridiculous.
It's a balance.

1549
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:49,300
That's some stupid course.
Or maybe I'm just a hate.

1550
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,380
I am not into this.

1551
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:53,440
I'm us to hold on a second.
What do you mean you're not into it?

1552
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,900
I'm just not into it.
Like what does that mean?

1553
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,510
I'm not saying impressive.
That's cool man.

1554
01:06:58,511 --> 01:06:59,890
I've seen people in Yoga do it all the
time.

1555
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,810
Listen,
you never like him.

1556
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:04,750
He never seen the guy built like him.
It does that shit with that kind of body

1557
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:05,620
mass.
Yeah.

1558
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,740
I've never seen that in a million years.
I've never seen a guy be able to hold

1559
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:12,000
those positions like that.
That's impressive.

1560
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:14,740
Yeah.
I mean that's like a very small

1561
01:07:14,741 --> 01:07:18,640
percentage of the human population is
capable of moving their body.

1562
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:20,350
Like I don't get it.
Like look at this.

1563
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,790
Look what he's doing.
I know.

1564
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:22,541
I'm sure.
That's great.

1565
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:25,420
That looks very hard.
But why do you say you don't get it?

1566
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:28,060
I'm saying I don't get the obsession
with it.

1567
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:30,280
Like how fast you guys are into it.

1568
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,620
One handed one hand Shannon ups,
dude,

1569
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:34,920
you don't think that's incredible.
Yaps insane.

1570
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:35,993
So what?
Why?

1571
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:39,150
Why are you hating?
He gets it gets your

1572
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,550
body.
That's what it is.

1573
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:48,160
Body.
That's good for your shoulder joint.

1574
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:48,980
Yeah,
I agree.

1575
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:52,240
Jesus Christ get Super Mad when I have a
new boyfriend and that's the truth.

1576
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,280
That's gymnasts isn't just a new
boyfriend thing.

1577
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:56,750
It's him looking at this guy's body and
I'm,

1578
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:00,700
and I just don't think it's that
impressive.

1579
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,580
Well all your,
I go to yoga and I've seen gymnastics.

1580
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:06,760
It's not anything new.
You're out of your mind and your mind if

1581
01:08:06,761 --> 01:08:09,250
you don't think that guys impressive.
I was going to say and looking at

1582
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,040
meditating,
that's not impressive.

1583
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,080
I can do that.
The only thing he's done so far that I

1584
01:08:14,081 --> 01:08:14,621
could do,
hey,

1585
01:08:14,621 --> 01:08:15,980
what's up everybody?
The

1586
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,860
only thing that he's done so far though,
see this stuff is all the higgs and

1587
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,290
Gracie type shed.
Hickson was really into this stuff,

1588
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:25,880
super into it now.
Natural natural stuff,

1589
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,000
um,
was essentially like this flowing yoga

1590
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:33,620
style that Hickson was really into that
a lot of other Jujitsu guys get into it.

1591
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:37,400
It's so interesting to see it all come
full circle now with guys like connor

1592
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:40,730
incorporating that.
But this is even another level.

1593
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:43,400
But you're,
you've seen those videos of Hixon doing

1594
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:45,320
those um,
full splits,

1595
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:48,500
standing full splits on a balance beam
20 years ago.

1596
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,150
Yeah.
Holding his foot up in the air.

1597
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:51,450
Yeah.
What do you try?

1598
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:54,560
Why Saint?
You're hating that hixson now.

1599
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:54,951
No,
no,

1600
01:08:54,951 --> 01:08:58,230
I'm sure you'll have to qualify.
Amazing.

1601
01:08:58,231 --> 01:09:00,640
I'm saying Hickson was doing and he was,
well this isn't,

1602
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:02,750
you can't let,
it ain't chanting this route and was

1603
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:03,610
doing camps.

1604
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,660
Bas rutten was doing crazy.
Shavar did that.

1605
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,960
Can't be in chance,
but he was in on chains and like,

1606
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:13,070
fuck with his hair done.
You know what is,

1607
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:16,130
what are you running from?
What are you running from my now?

1608
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,170
Nothing.
I don't think you can give it that guy

1609
01:09:18,171 --> 01:09:19,940
that much credit.
Can I ask you a question?

1610
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:21,470
Can I ask you an honest question?
Not doing that.

1611
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:24,280
We're saying the guy's impressive
physically and that it helped connor to

1612
01:09:24,281 --> 01:09:26,600
train with that guy.
Obviously conor is not stupid.

1613
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,900
He's figured out how to become the world
champion with one punch.

1614
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,610
I mean,
he's not a stupid guy.

1615
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,640
He's,
he's a marketing genius.

1616
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:36,830
Common,
50 fives even more trouble.

1617
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,420
Wait,
he's not cutting.

1618
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,930
I don't know about that because a big
part of what gets him there is he cuts.

1619
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:42,764
Wait,
perfect.

1620
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:43,760
I mean he's,
oh,

1621
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,250
he looks like he looks shit dog shit at
45,

1622
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:48,560
but whatever he does to rehydrate the
next day,

1623
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:49,610
he looks amazing.

1624
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:52,280
And he's done it with no ivy this time.
Yeah.

1625
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:54,770
But think if he doesn't have cut all
that weight so he doesn't deplete his

1626
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:56,730
body,
but it's faster than all of these city

1627
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:59,060
bigger guys,
it's going to take them down like Chad

1628
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,280
did.
Then you've got a moisture problem.

1629
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:05,470
Much bigger problem chat as a tiny guy
in comparison to a lot of 55 or it's

1630
01:10:05,471 --> 01:10:07,790
like dos Anjos dos Anjos gets on top of
you.

1631
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:10,460
That is a totally different world of
physics.

1632
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,050
And wait,
I agree.

1633
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,830
But you look at matchups like co Donald
serone phenomenal match up.

1634
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,120
Oh yeah.
Anthony Pettis.

1635
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,770
Oh,
your best match shows are great.

1636
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:21,170
Match up certain match ups that 55.
You're right,

1637
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,340
you're right.
100%.

1638
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:23,331
But,
um,

1639
01:10:23,331 --> 01:10:26,810
I think if you think of dos Anjos wins,
they'll fight.

1640
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,260
Nope.
No.

1641
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:31,670
It's only if calloway wins really cowboy
winds as the money.

1642
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,200
That's the money.
That's the medical,

1643
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,450
Ooh,
that is a mega fan.

1644
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,660
Why do you guys say that w did not,
if just Sandhya this way.

1645
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:40,160
No,
I'm,

1646
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,360
I'm asking if he's so,
cause I think like Joe mentioned that

1647
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,600
uh,
Dos Anjos can put in that Chad Mendez

1648
01:10:47,601 --> 01:10:51,920
game plan.
We'll also dos Anjos hits fucking hard

1649
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:56,921
and he's got nasty Jujitsu.
He's got a fucking pressuring game.

1650
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,960
But you know,
connor might laugh at it.

1651
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:01,340
Connor might say,
you know,

1652
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:04,160
like I got the solution to that look,
Jeremy Stevens,

1653
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:05,300
doc,
that dude dead.

1654
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:07,720
Yeah.
I mean it's,

1655
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:11,060
it's very possible that connor might
just see holes in his game that we're

1656
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:15,680
not seeing and he might be able to just
don't think a big payday like dos Anjos

1657
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,070
Mcgregor's not a superstar fight.
Right.

1658
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,080
It's really not.
But it is a superstar fight.

1659
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:22,200
Whenever connor fights anybody and if
he's got a big challenge in front of him

1660
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:24,270
fighting for the lightweight title,
it'll be a gigantic,

1661
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:24,990
nope.

1662
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,660
College big,
no matter what color cow bully,

1663
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:31,950
that's the bucket.
If cowboy can win next Saturday against

1664
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:35,850
dos Anjos would become the champion,
the world that is the,

1665
01:11:35,851 --> 01:11:38,460
and I guarantee you they'll probably
call connor out,

1666
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:39,300
right?
Unless they,

1667
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,850
unless it was a crazy war.
Like you want a rematch?

1668
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:42,990
Yeah,
they don't like each other,

1669
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,940
but unless it's a crazy war and you
know,

1670
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:46,470
everybody says like you gotta do it
again.

1671
01:11:46,471 --> 01:11:47,570
And they both said we've got to do it
again.

1672
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,500
The UFC says they have to do again.
But again,

1673
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,830
like this is like when people upset at
me about the Frankie Edgar thing,

1674
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,290
like I don't get to call,
this is not my choice.

1675
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:57,840
I'm not,
my opinion is just an opinion.

1676
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,240
I just see a guy get knocked dead.
I see.

1677
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:02,280
Okay,
that guy can't fight for at least six

1678
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:05,910
months at least and really shouldn't be
fighting probably for a year.

1679
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:08,340
And it wasn't much of a fight I ride
with right away.

1680
01:12:08,341 --> 01:12:08,701
I was like,
yeah,

1681
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:09,481
Joe's right.
There's no way.

1682
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:11,110
There's a rematch.
But then I thought about,

1683
01:12:11,111 --> 01:12:11,431
I'm like,
well,

1684
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:13,310
they gave all these other champs
incident remains,

1685
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,620
but they didn't decane cain got knocked
dead two against junior dos Santos.

1686
01:12:16,621 --> 01:12:17,640
He had a fight.
Big Foot.

1687
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:19,530
Keep people get saying,
I can't get an instant rematch.

1688
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:20,483
No,
he didn't.

1689
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:23,580
It did.
Not More rematches then not.

1690
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,490
But he fought big foot Silva and by the
way,

1691
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:28,920
the Anderson Silva rematch to fucking
soon.

1692
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:31,860
And I said it and he got,
he got lucky that he broke his leg.

1693
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:33,570
How about that?
Not Obviously,

1694
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,210
not really,
but he was getting beaten the fuck up.

1695
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,690
He got hurt real bad and the clinch
Weidman caught him with a punch in the

1696
01:12:39,691 --> 01:12:41,340
clinch.
His legs went rubber.

1697
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:44,190
He went to the ground,
he held on as much as he could and

1698
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:46,530
Weidman beat the fuck out of him for
that first round.

1699
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,020
And then Anderson threw that kick and
broke his leg.

1700
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:52,830
And it was almost fortunate that he went
out like that because why?

1701
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:56,730
Mum's going to beat his ass.
Anderson was not able to take a punch

1702
01:12:56,731 --> 01:13:00,360
anymore the same way he used to.
Anderson used to eat punches.

1703
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,700
Watch the fight.
You want to watch a crazy fucking fight.

1704
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:06,750
Watch his fight with Jorge Rivera where
he lets rivera punch him in the face.

1705
01:13:06,751 --> 01:13:10,710
Really lets him just punch with this.
Good in front of Rivera.

1706
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:12,550
Let them pull it up.
I'm gonna.

1707
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,630
Hey Rivera.
Jorge Rivera versus Anderson Silva in

1708
01:13:15,631 --> 01:13:19,060
cage wars in the UK.
This is before Anderson came to the

1709
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:23,550
dude.
I was a gigantic Anderson Silva Fan long

1710
01:13:23,551 --> 01:13:28,551
before everyone that title I will you
watch my calling the fight against Chris

1711
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,900
Weidman.
I was a kid in a fucking candy store

1712
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:32,850
because he wasn't a,
he wasn't a new guy to me.

1713
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,700
Like you're saying when he fought Chris
Leben who I say Weidman,

1714
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:38,370
I meant [inaudible] sorry.
When he fought Chris Leben,

1715
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:40,260
when he came to central seating,
it was crazy.

1716
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:42,580
I was a kid in a candy store cause I was
like fuck this.

1717
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:45,190
This guy is a different kind of stryker.
Yeah,

1718
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:48,420
this is a whole different animal you're
dealing with like in Lehman's gonna come

1719
01:13:48,421 --> 01:13:49,500
forward.
Face first.

1720
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,590
The tailor made
this.

1721
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:56,910
So Jorge Rivera who was on the left,
who is a fucking hard punch,

1722
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,840
good hand and Anderson standing right in
front of them and there's a one point in

1723
01:14:00,841 --> 01:14:02,610
the fight.
How long does this fight go,

1724
01:14:02,611 --> 01:14:04,560
Jamie?
10 minutes.

1725
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:07,020
There's one point,
the fight before Anderson knocks him out

1726
01:14:07,021 --> 01:14:10,800
where Anderson stands right in front of
them and literally lets him punch him in

1727
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:14,410
the face and Markdale [inaudible] who
was with Jorge was like,

1728
01:14:14,411 --> 01:14:15,300
yeah,
yeah,

1729
01:14:15,301 --> 01:14:16,134
yeah.
And he's like,

1730
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,133
what the fuck?

1731
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,530
You should hear mark talk about it.
Mark.

1732
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:23,200
It's a hilarious mark talks about it,
but I love that guy.

1733
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:24,970
He's so funny.
By the way,

1734
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:28,900
mark was also agreeing with me that all
though look different physically.

1735
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:30,040
He like,
he looks smooth,

1736
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,740
he looks the entire world except for
South America.

1737
01:14:32,741 --> 01:14:33,760
Agreed with you joe.
Well,

1738
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:35,750
there's some people on the underground
that disagree.

1739
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:38,710
We call Zack cody.
It's just when you see a guy,

1740
01:14:38,711 --> 01:14:41,440
it's hard to tell from a a still photo
as well.

1741
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:46,450
A lot of what you see is in movement.
You see like in the like they don't look

1742
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:49,060
as as explosive.
Even the still photo,

1743
01:14:49,061 --> 01:14:51,310
it shows a little bit,
but not much.

1744
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:52,144
It could,
like I said,

1745
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:54,250
it could have been attributable to
cardio.

1746
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,110
I mean is let's say,
let's say,

1747
01:14:56,111 --> 01:14:57,120
well,
there's no evidence at all.

1748
01:14:57,121 --> 01:14:58,180
They'll ever did steroids,
right.

1749
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:02,620
So let's say he never did steroids,
let's say he just did way more cardio

1750
01:15:02,621 --> 01:15:06,340
for that fight and didn't do nearly as
much strength training and that's what

1751
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:07,780
it is.
There's a difference in the way it

1752
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:10,660
looks.
[inaudible] Silva was the biggest,

1753
01:15:10,661 --> 01:15:15,320
that was the big contrast and the door
of course [inaudible] it's public,

1754
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,560
but the tour,
we knew to look for it.

1755
01:15:17,561 --> 01:15:19,690
We knew it was happening.
We knew about the testing,

1756
01:15:19,691 --> 01:15:21,460
we knew about everything with Eric
Silver.

1757
01:15:21,461 --> 01:15:22,810
You're like hall.
Yeah,

1758
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:25,930
he was.
He was so bonded out with that apple

1759
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:30,010
bottom and everything too.
When he walks in and he's taught here,

1760
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:33,820
when he walked into the octagon,
it was literally like a scooby doo sound

1761
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:37,710
all across the globe.
Canny panty drawer.

1762
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:38,823
No,
no,

1763
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,510
no.
That's what I mean.

1764
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:43,190
In the last fight crisis in the last
fight,

1765
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:47,260
last buys,
melted cheese,

1766
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,430
it just didn't make any sense.

1767
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:51,640
But again it could have been that he
changed his approach.

1768
01:15:51,641 --> 01:15:54,290
He decided his gas and out in these
fights like against Matt Brown,

1769
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:58,840
he gassed out and he has all this muscle
and all this power and he's always going

1770
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:01,060
for it and he is a young guys.
I ain't even 30 years old.

1771
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:05,410
It is possible that he just changed his
entire approach.

1772
01:16:05,411 --> 01:16:08,050
No more strength and conditioning,
only just training,

1773
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:12,130
only cardio from a sparring and from you
know,

1774
01:16:12,131 --> 01:16:14,350
repetition.
I mean it's totally possible.

1775
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:17,080
It's totally possible elster over him.
When he got busted,

1776
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:20,320
it was in this protein shake to look how
beautiful Anderson's movement.

1777
01:16:20,321 --> 01:16:20,651
It was like,
oh,

1778
01:16:20,651 --> 01:16:24,110
he checked that kick.
I mean it's all like automatic when he

1779
01:16:24,111 --> 01:16:25,750
was in.
By the way,

1780
01:16:25,751 --> 01:16:28,930
he didn't come to the UFC until,
I think he was like 35 man,

1781
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:30,490
look at him.
He was going to retire with four is

1782
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:31,090
going to retire.

1783
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,260
No,
talked them out of it.

1784
01:16:32,261 --> 01:16:34,520
How old was he when he came to the UFC?
His third tour?

1785
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:37,820
I thought it was 32 you might be right
though.

1786
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:39,920
I know he's going to retire and he might
be right.

1787
01:16:39,921 --> 01:16:42,370
Eggnog talked them out of it.
It was like you have to fight.

1788
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:44,170
While he had had some,
you know,

1789
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,480
crazy tough fights.
He also had a falling out with shoot the

1790
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:47,770
box.
Surprise.

1791
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,170
He's not retiring now.
Why,

1792
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:52,790
why do you think he still went to Moitai
Dream Team and it be like he,

1793
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:55,570
they created a team and he didn't have
good training partners and there was a

1794
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:58,420
lot of shit going on,
but he pulled it together right when he

1795
01:16:58,421 --> 01:17:00,340
came to the UFC.
Traditi ever.

1796
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,080
And will he pull it together in cage
wars?

1797
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:04,340
Really?
And then he came to the UFC after that.

1798
01:17:04,341 --> 01:17:06,880
I remember he was about to fight Roy
Jones and then everyone's like,

1799
01:17:06,881 --> 01:17:09,070
Nah,
that would have been so ridiculous.

1800
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,130
Been awesome.
He got

1801
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,990
lit up.
It would have been awesome.

1802
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:15,290
Oh good.
Wake up call to a lot of MMA fighters.

1803
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:17,030
They think they can box with the garlic
Jones.

1804
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,560
Speaking of John,
she says,

1805
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,450
get knocked down in the fourth round.
Hey,

1806
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,480
stop doing that.
You're a head lead commentate on HBO.

1807
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:25,750
It's not do that.
Yeah.

1808
01:17:25,751 --> 01:17:28,180
And I think that's going to fuck with
his commentary for sure.

1809
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:31,760
Hundred percent not going to be able to
talk that good after that knockout.

1810
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:34,120
I mean,
it'll be a while before he recovered

1811
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:36,440
that he's had like five of those.
I mean,

1812
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:38,060
unless he's getting paid crazy amounts
of money,

1813
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:40,360
I don't get why he does it.
No one really watched it blinked.

1814
01:17:40,361 --> 01:17:41,840
The reason we watched cause he got
highlight,

1815
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:42,780
knockout,
you know,

1816
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:47,090
meanwhile Jorge Rivera did a lot better
than rich Franklin.

1817
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,710
It's interesting.
He sure did.

1818
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:49,750
I figured out how to,
well,

1819
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,490
Jorge's it Moitai guys,
I figured out how to fight Anderson from

1820
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:56,480
the clinch Anderson like at this point
in the fight is sorta just chipping away

1821
01:17:56,481 --> 01:17:57,314
at them.

1822
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:59,780
But uh,
how much more time is in this fight?

1823
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:00,860
How much,
where are we at?

1824
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:03,350
There's a,
the moment before the fights dot.

1825
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:05,200
That nice knee to the body.
See,

1826
01:18:05,201 --> 01:18:07,520
this is Anderson,
like really in his prime.

1827
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:12,100
So you see Anderson,
John Jones shadowbox into yeah,

1828
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,030
it's pretty cool.
Interesting,

1829
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:16,540
right?
Addison against that of rockhold called

1830
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:18,080
Luke rockhold beat him out.
Oh God.

1831
01:18:18,081 --> 01:18:20,750
It's horrible.
Now it's over.

1832
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:22,070
Now.
The champ,

1833
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:24,950
the new crown champions,
the old Anderson Silva.

1834
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:25,771
No,
Anderson's,

1835
01:18:25,771 --> 01:18:26,540
it's,
oh,

1836
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:27,120
look at him.
Let me,

1837
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,910
let me,
yeah,

1838
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:31,530
you're crunk for the Ken Shamrock Holy
Space.

1839
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,900
You fight to Anderson took them down.
Unless you are on testosterone

1840
01:18:35,901 --> 01:18:37,700
replacement,
when you hit your late thirties like

1841
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:40,000
that,
there's just no way you can't compete.

1842
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,620
I compete in it.
Look,

1843
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:44,120
if you got Anderson on the Vito Belfort
Diet,

1844
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:48,070
I think Anderson goes back in there like
a demon and,

1845
01:18:48,071 --> 01:18:50,720
and who knows who he can beat until his,
you know,

1846
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:54,650
40th fucking birthday or whatever it
would be when the wheels fall off.

1847
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:57,590
But Anderson,
now you're talking about a guy who was

1848
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:02,890
brutally owed by Chris Weidman and then
in the second fight had a seriously hard

1849
01:19:03,111 --> 01:19:05,690
time staying conscious from a punch in
the clinch.

1850
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:07,340
You know,
I just don't,

1851
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:10,490
I don't think the body,
I think the body can only take so much

1852
01:19:10,491 --> 01:19:11,720
man.
And I think he took it all.

1853
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,600
Victoria Anderson makes sense.
Here's where it gets,

1854
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:18,440
here's towards the end of the fight.
This is the second round where I'm

1855
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:20,120
pretty sure he stopped him the second
round.

1856
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:21,253
But,
um,

1857
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:24,230
there's a point where it's just fucking,
let me start.

1858
01:19:24,231 --> 01:19:26,810
Show me how much time is left here.
Yeah,

1859
01:19:26,811 --> 01:19:29,390
scoot ahead a little bit and see if we
could find it because it's fucking

1860
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:31,760
preposterous.
Andersen to standing of fraud of them.

1861
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:35,160
Here it is right here.
Watch this and listen.

1862
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,850
Just stands in front of them and let's
Jorge tee off on his face.

1863
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:40,730
Look at this.
Boom,

1864
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,160
boom,
look standard,

1865
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:43,190
right?
Boom,

1866
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:45,850
boom,
boom.

1867
01:19:45,851 --> 01:19:48,290
Blog.
Just just ate.

1868
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:50,100
It just stood in front of him.
And eight.

1869
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:54,500
Now contrast that,
that series of punches that Jorge Rivera

1870
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:58,880
who hits fucking hard to Chris Weidman's
one punch in the clinch.

1871
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:00,280
Oh,
night and day.

1872
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,210
That dropped him.
I understand.

1873
01:20:02,211 --> 01:20:05,780
Just can't absorb shots like he used to.
He used to have a phenomenal chin.

1874
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:07,680
You shut down,
your brain says,

1875
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:08,110
oh,
oh,

1876
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:09,690
here comes to chocolate dental.
Same thing.

1877
01:20:09,691 --> 01:20:13,260
Had a phenomenal chin.
I mean there was times and Chuck's life

1878
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:14,550
where you just weren't going to hurt
him.

1879
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:16,560
Sorry.
Sorry.

1880
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:20,030
I think Dan's Dan Henderson pretty much
until he got killed by Vito.

1881
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:21,360
Same thing.
Yeah,

1882
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,780
you can eat everything.
Who Do you guys have winning the

1883
01:20:24,781 --> 01:20:27,540
Anderson Silva RFC [inaudible] that's
not going to happen.

1884
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:30,890
Veto won't fight them.
I talked to Renzo for teeth.

1885
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:32,170
Why won't he fight him?
Veto it.

1886
01:20:32,171 --> 01:20:34,560
Doesn't want to fight him.
He wants a shot at the title and they're

1887
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:35,221
like,
dude,

1888
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:37,470
you,
you fought for the title and got smoked

1889
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:39,750
in the first round.
You can't beat Dan Henderson and get a

1890
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:42,540
new title shot.
Luke wants to fight him because he wants

1891
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:44,870
to fight.
Vetoer he should.

1892
01:20:44,871 --> 01:20:48,960
They said he goes,
I want LFV tour and the silver platter.

1893
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:50,550
Yeah,
he's going to cause that what?

1894
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:51,240
He said,
yes.

1895
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,910
That's going to be ugly for Vito.
I feel set it up.

1896
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,910
Well look,
you got to do Weidman.

1897
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:00,960
Weidman to Weidman rematch would be very
interesting.

1898
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:01,831
Um,
uh,

1899
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:05,520
rockhold Yoel Romero fight would be very
interesting.

1900
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,870
I think were a marrow is not doing
anything in the fourth and fifth round.

1901
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:12,930
All Jesus.
And remember I was the guy,

1902
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:15,810
Jesus,
he's saying forget.

1903
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,690
He said Fuck Gay.
Do you know that trout just drove me

1904
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:22,620
crazy when the,
whoever interviewed him didn't clarify

1905
01:21:22,621 --> 01:21:23,460
that.
They like,

1906
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:24,900
oh cool.
They didn't know either.

1907
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,430
Well,
fucking knew.

1908
01:21:26,431 --> 01:21:28,920
I was listening to what he's saying.
Forget he's Cuban.

1909
01:21:28,921 --> 01:21:30,900
Don't forget Jesus.
When I speak to them,

1910
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:33,240
you notice when I speak to him,
I looked at him right in the eye.

1911
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:37,200
I speak very clearly and I tried to
clarify everything he says.

1912
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,440
Like when he fought,
uh,

1913
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:41,010
Tim Kennedy,
and there was that moment where you

1914
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:44,490
didn't get off the stool.
I had a long conversation with them.

1915
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,070
I was talking to him nice and slowly.
I'm looking at,

1916
01:21:47,071 --> 01:21:49,890
I'm trying to find out what he's saying.
I'm trying to get to it.

1917
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:53,490
I've known a lot of Cuban people.
I know what they sound like.

1918
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:58,730
They have that way of saying teas.
It's why the t is a why there's not for

1919
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,400
gay.
Jesus

1920
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:05,490
had been the PR team.
If I was interviewing,

1921
01:22:05,491 --> 01:22:09,510
kind of fucked up my saying.
So you're saying don't forget Jesus CCC.

1922
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,980
Don't forget Jesus.

1923
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:13,951
No,
he,

1924
01:22:13,951 --> 01:22:17,540
it sounds like he's saying no for Gay
Jesus.

1925
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:19,390
No,
he's tall.

1926
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,240
He feels like he's like five,
eight,

1927
01:22:21,241 --> 01:22:21,690
five,
nine.

1928
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:22,430
Oh no,
he's,

1929
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:23,870
he's probably,
uh,

1930
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,310
there's how gay Jesus,
no.

1931
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:30,670
Yoel Romero had the flu for the last
four days.

1932
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:31,750
Come on,
Milky.

1933
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:35,160
Don't ever got to show that guy to get
him up here.

1934
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,770
That guy wanted to come on the podcast
with John Jones and he's like,

1935
01:22:37,771 --> 01:22:39,450
I'll say some crazy shit.
John won't say.

1936
01:22:39,451 --> 01:22:40,380
I'm like,
what?

1937
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:42,220
Who's America?
Why would we want youth?

1938
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:45,600
It was Matt,
John John's manager.

1939
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,420
Great guy though,
by the way.

1940
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:53,370
Just fucking around.
But he's the idea of like what your son,

1941
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,170
but he's like,
you're going to talk for John.

1942
01:22:55,171 --> 01:22:56,750
That's exactly what I don't want.
Yeah.

1943
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,710
I want to know what's going on in his
mind,

1944
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:02,070
but go fuck cheese out.
Poor guy.

1945
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:07,330
He got tortured online.
Like people were mad at him like even

1946
01:23:07,331 --> 01:23:11,380
like reputable,
like sports broadcasters were tweeting

1947
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:14,620
at how are horrendous.
What he said was and terrible.

1948
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:18,070
What he said was,
I was fucking yelling at my computer.

1949
01:23:18,071 --> 01:23:18,970
He said,
forget.

1950
01:23:18,971 --> 01:23:22,870
He says the same gags that do the
ranking and they can't even get your oil

1951
01:23:22,871 --> 01:23:23,800
shit straight.
No,

1952
01:23:23,810 --> 01:23:26,190
no,
I don't do tr under the rankings kings.

1953
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:30,570
How's,
there might be an undercut or no,

1954
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,950
let's do the rankings.
I'm pretty sure,

1955
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:34,840
right?
Some some head journalists.

1956
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:40,070
What do you do that
who does it make more sense?

1957
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,840
Yes.
Ryan seacrest who does the ranking?

1958
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:44,590
Oh,
where does that,

1959
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:45,850
like what?
What are the people,

1960
01:23:45,851 --> 01:23:48,160
who are the people?
The reikis aren't that horrible.

1961
01:23:48,161 --> 01:23:52,750
I just think that when you know someone
like Uriah Hall knocks out Gig Arbonne

1962
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,040
Saucy and he's below him on the
rankings,

1963
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:54,910
that's fucking stupid.

1964
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:58,570
Well you know the UFC brass was like we
can't do the rankings because it's some

1965
01:23:58,571 --> 01:24:00,070
bullshit.
Cause whenever they're going to do,

1966
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:02,920
they're going to do pay dictate.
That's based off your ranking.

1967
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,780
And then that was hard.
Then they're like,

1968
01:24:04,781 --> 01:24:06,820
oh fuck,
we can't do that because bill,

1969
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:10,790
he's a huge fan of whoever he's lost
seven in a row and they want to ranking

1970
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:14,050
number 10 do you have any idea,
do you guys have any idea how much a

1971
01:24:14,051 --> 01:24:16,600
veteran makes off a UFC?
I off the robot.

1972
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:19,150
Let's not even talking about it cause
I'll start throwing up on my keyboard

1973
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,310
to,
yeah,

1974
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,230
that's the answer.
You know what?

1975
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,870
Can I do a positive spin though?
I hit on Reebok so much.

1976
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:29,680
Can I do a positive one?
I dug the mcgregor trunks,

1977
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:34,120
the green and gold trunks and all those
black and gold for the first time ever.

1978
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,160
First time ever.
I was like,

1979
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:37,510
those look good.
Well they were there,

1980
01:24:37,511 --> 01:24:39,100
you know,
they're responding to criticism and

1981
01:24:39,101 --> 01:24:41,230
doing a good job of responding to
criticism.

1982
01:24:41,231 --> 01:24:43,780
I disagree.
I think the whole,

1983
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:48,340
the real reality of this whole situation
is that it could have been all been

1984
01:24:48,341 --> 01:24:50,140
handled better.
I think everybody would agree to that.

1985
01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:53,740
And I think the fighters are very
disappointed at their lack of ability to

1986
01:24:53,741 --> 01:24:56,620
be autonomous as far as like how much
money they can make from sponsors.

1987
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,530
And like you're the perfect example.
You know,

1988
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:01,570
I,
and I've used you as an example and you

1989
01:25:01,571 --> 01:25:03,130
know,
people said that you weren't telling the

1990
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:06,520
truth and you know,
now we know that that's not not correct.

1991
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:09,370
You brought me my fund,
your financials,

1992
01:25:09,371 --> 01:25:11,230
and I brought them to the fucking top.
Yes.

1993
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:14,550
And we had a nice conversation about it
and I think that it's,

1994
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:17,440
it's a,
it's an unfortunate reality that we're

1995
01:25:17,441 --> 01:25:18,520
going to have to live with now.

1996
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,850
And I would,
I would like to see out of this is,

1997
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:24,640
I mean the argument against it was like
people are having condom depo on their

1998
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:25,780
trunks on that shit.
I'm like,

1999
01:25:25,781 --> 01:25:28,840
well how about don't have condom depot?
How about you have you,

2000
01:25:28,841 --> 01:25:30,730
you,
you make a very specific like,

2001
01:25:30,731 --> 01:25:32,500
listen,
you can get all the sponsors you want,

2002
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:35,770
but you can't have anything that's going
to be bad for the image of the UFC.

2003
01:25:35,771 --> 01:25:37,390
This is what we think are bad.
I don't know why Khan,

2004
01:25:37,391 --> 01:25:40,420
which is what they did by the way.
I don't know why condoms will be bad.

2005
01:25:40,421 --> 01:25:43,850
Is it bad to not get aids?
Exactly what it was.

2006
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:46,360
It was bandaid depot.
Would that be okay?

2007
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:51,690
But aspirin depot was that okay.
You have to submit your sponsors to

2008
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,540
check them off so you weren't allowed to
alcohol,

2009
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,760
tobacco,
anything competed with the UFC.

2010
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,210
Did anybody,
did it really diminish the entertainment

2011
01:26:01,211 --> 01:26:04,580
value for anybody when someone was
walking with dynamic fastener on their

2012
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:06,680
shirt,
did he give a fuck at all?

2013
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:10,370
I will never give a fuck if Chris
Weidman was walking to the octagon and

2014
01:26:10,371 --> 01:26:14,480
he had muscle farm or fucking fill in
the blank,

2015
01:26:14,481 --> 01:26:16,310
you know,
fucking where all those logos now

2016
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,140
they're on the mat.
That's what bonds.

2017
01:26:18,141 --> 01:26:21,170
Some of them are.
Most of the map looks like a nascar.

2018
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:24,200
The fighters are in black and white.
Unless you're a champ looking like

2019
01:26:24,201 --> 01:26:26,540
assholes get not getting paid.
That's the only issue I have with it.

2020
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:29,360
Well there's,
there's definitely something to be said

2021
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:32,240
about that because none of that money is
going towards the fighters and the

2022
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:34,460
cause.
The only thing that's changed besides

2023
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:37,910
the fighters look in plain as fucking
black and white is the matte looks like

2024
01:26:37,911 --> 01:26:39,380
a fucking toys are us now.

2025
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:41,660
Yeah.
I think there's a real,

2026
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:42,710
uh,
option,

2027
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:47,570
a real possibility for fighters to get
super involved in social media and put

2028
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:50,700
out a lot of videos and get people
excel.

2029
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:54,550
If you put out a lot of content,
people respond and they loved like this.

2030
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:56,140
A lot of people that I follow.
Yeah,

2031
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:58,070
there's a lot of people that I follow.
You know Ross training,

2032
01:26:58,071 --> 01:26:59,870
you know at Ross training guy in
instagram?

2033
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:02,170
No,
he is like some pretty uh,

2034
01:27:02,171 --> 01:27:03,340
intense,
uh,

2035
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:05,690
personal trainer dude.
He's got all these great workout things

2036
01:27:05,691 --> 01:27:08,060
that he does on instagram.
I follow that guy all the time.

2037
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:11,720
If he was a fighter and he had all these
people following him all the time,

2038
01:27:11,721 --> 01:27:14,390
or a lot of other guys that do these
things where girls who do these things

2039
01:27:14,391 --> 01:27:15,530
too,
there's a lot of people that will girls,

2040
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:16,700
they do it.
They won't look at their asses.

2041
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:17,910
Man,
I followed Jeff.

2042
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:22,020
I know you do
get his head.

2043
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,690
[inaudible] the way I talk when I'm
talking about either mortality or voice

2044
01:27:25,691 --> 01:27:28,550
just got too,
but I think that what it gives an

2045
01:27:28,551 --> 01:27:32,750
opportunity for fighters to adjust and
the adjustment is to concentrate or have

2046
01:27:32,751 --> 01:27:34,970
someone that works where you concentrate
on social media,

2047
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,910
put out a lot of content.
I know miles jury does a lot of shit

2048
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:38,930
bomber though.
It is about,

2049
01:27:38,931 --> 01:27:41,300
we shouldn't have to do it.
It would be better if they didn't.

2050
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:44,200
There's so many fighters.
That's why if I'm conor mcgregor rate

2051
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,610
for this,
if I'm coming or greg or I say I'm not

2052
01:27:46,611 --> 01:27:49,190
doing shit to give me 20 million of
fight,

2053
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:51,230
that's how much power I think that kid
has right now.

2054
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,690
He has the most power I've ever seen a
UFC fighter.

2055
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,190
Yeah,
he's a nation behind him.

2056
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:58,400
He could sell out 80,000 okay,
well I'm going to show you what kind of

2057
01:27:58,401 --> 01:28:00,800
power he has behind him because I'm
going to send these to Jamie and we're

2058
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:02,990
gonna Watch what it was like at the mgm
cause.

2059
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:07,990
I have videos of Irish people going
fucking bonkers at a level that you've

2060
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:11,510
never seen in your entire life.
We're talking about climbing on top of

2061
01:28:11,511 --> 01:28:13,580
fucking casino tables,
screaming,

2062
01:28:13,581 --> 01:28:15,500
taking their shirts off.
There's thousands of them.

2063
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:16,920
When he was there,
when he won,

2064
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:20,030
he won.
He's a bigger star than lesnar now.

2065
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:24,320
They stormed the fucking casino and when
they stormed the casino,

2066
01:28:24,321 --> 01:28:27,860
nobody could do anything about it.
Nobody can do anything about the

2067
01:28:27,861 --> 01:28:29,690
security guards are all standing around.
I'm going to show you some.

2068
01:28:29,691 --> 01:28:33,140
We've never seen a star like this,
and for the first time connor's bigger

2069
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,820
than the UFC.
He can go,

2070
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,400
I want this amount of money,
or I'm not doing shit.

2071
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:39,620
And he just backed up everything he
said.

2072
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:40,970
Yeah,
I'm gonna.

2073
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:45,440
I'm gonna say Jamie right now.
You never seen nothing like this.

2074
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:47,240
You never seen nothing like this.

2075
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,260
Irish love him some fighting.
Jamie,

2076
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:53,000
you got your phone on his Tiger Tattoo
bums me out a little bit.

2077
01:28:53,001 --> 01:28:54,020
I'm not going to Lydia.
WHATSAPP.

2078
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:57,440
Jame
airdrops not showing up.

2079
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:59,480
Airdrop is really wonky,
man.

2080
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,270
You need to get one on your computer
airdrop.

2081
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:04,690
Don't you have a phone?
Turn it on.

2082
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:06,620
It's like,
oh yeah.

2083
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:08,340
Should I email it to you?
Is that the better move?

2084
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:09,970
Okay,
let me get you all to you.

2085
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:11,790
Um,
you,

2086
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:13,590
uh,
you wouldn't believe it.

2087
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,870
You're going to,
you're going to look at this and you get

2088
01:29:14,871 --> 01:29:15,820
to go.
What?

2089
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:21,270
The mob to attachments maximum.
All right.

2090
01:29:21,271 --> 01:29:22,530
Don't just sell them.
They use yesware.

2091
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:25,920
I wouldn't be at that casino.
Yeah.

2092
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:28,860
Crowds make me nervous.
Should I get rid of there right away?

2093
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:29,800
I get out of that.
I don't.

2094
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:31,620
Yeah,
you had to get out of there right away.

2095
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:32,270
And I'm like,
mom,

2096
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:33,510
this is so ridiculous.

2097
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:35,820
Nervous.
Am I send you a couple of other ones,

2098
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:37,770
Jamie?
It's just so stupid.

2099
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:39,780
It was so crazy.
It was.

2100
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:43,530
I'm ever seen anything like that.
You know what to pay out of my huge

2101
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:48,150
total,
total new level of chaos and,

2102
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,460
and,
and really it was amazing,

2103
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:51,360
man.
I tweeted,

2104
01:29:51,361 --> 01:29:52,590
right,
right when he knocked him out,

2105
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:53,720
I said,
well ladies and gentlemen,

2106
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:55,800
this is your biggest star in UFC
history.

2107
01:29:56,070 --> 01:30:01,070
How about arguably one of the biggest
stars in the history of all combat

2108
01:30:01,381 --> 01:30:04,470
sports?
Because there's never been anybody that

2109
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:09,471
has won a fight that has had casinos
overrun where the literally the security

2110
01:30:09,961 --> 01:30:11,550
guy watch these videos.
You're going to freak out.

2111
01:30:11,551 --> 01:30:14,790
The security guys can't do shit.
Dudes are jumping up on tables.

2112
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:17,820
They're taking their shirts off their
singing all together.

2113
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:21,030
I mean,
not just one or two thousands and

2114
01:30:21,031 --> 01:30:22,620
thousands of these army guys.

2115
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:24,510
Did it come to you?
It does now.

2116
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,490
He's a special dude,
man.

2117
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:30,270
Yeah.
The thing why I'm just drawn to connor

2118
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:33,330
is cause he's a good person like you see
as soon as it'd be,

2119
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:35,340
although yeah.
Hugged him.

2120
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,370
Done the mic.
Cause like he's a great champion and

2121
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,570
I'll respect picture of them hugging in
the back.

2122
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:40,240
Yeah,
man,

2123
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,310
I saw it.
Yeah.

2124
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:42,820
It's very cool man.
He's an amazing,

2125
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,770
like he's just a good person all change
again.

2126
01:30:44,771 --> 01:30:47,100
If they said it'll route match.
Yeah,

2127
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:48,600
correct.
You're right back up.

2128
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,370
Did you see the picture that he put on
twitter?

2129
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,750
Yes.
That's so rude.

2130
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:55,010
Is a picture of him Jay.
Wait,

2131
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,080
wait until Brian come back.
Cause Brian Well,

2132
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:59,070
how about we do don't do it.
Well Brian,

2133
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:00,630
doable.
Brian's gone.

2134
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:03,390
Brian doesn't declare that as an ex
boyfriend jack off.

2135
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:07,810
But this is a photo of Connor Connor's
looking down and uh,

2136
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,600
the camera's like looking up at him and
says,

2137
01:31:09,601 --> 01:31:10,890
wake up Jose.

2138
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:12,590
It's all over.
God.

2139
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:18,630
He can do what he called Solo bulleted.
It's a marketing thing.

2140
01:31:18,631 --> 01:31:20,240
You know what I'm saying?
It's brilliant.

2141
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:21,780
That's cool.
But it's also real.

2142
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:24,990
It's a mock cause he ain't got a tall
that's on his twitter.

2143
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:28,500
It's cold blood.
It's cold as cold blooded.

2144
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:29,790
That's,
that's like a,

2145
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:33,810
that's cryotherapy blood.
It's so fun stuff.

2146
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:38,790
It's like fucking dilute picture
resurface because he posted that weeks

2147
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:39,601
ago.
Oh,

2148
01:31:39,601 --> 01:31:40,140
did it?
Yeah.

2149
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,950
And then they just re posted it.
He posted,

2150
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:46,220
he repost pickup was brilliance all over
fuck.

2151
01:31:46,221 --> 01:31:49,490
And I seen that photo of him call it.
Did you see that?

2152
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:53,740
He tweeted that came out today and he's
on the bike and Venice going Dadadadah.

2153
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:57,880
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2154
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:58,853
Yeah.
It's,

2155
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,580
it's kind of hilarious.

2156
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:03,790
What are you looking for Jimmy?
Just look it up.

2157
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:05,350
Google it.
You Fuck?

2158
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:06,800
Oh look right here.
Yeah,

2159
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,220
him verse.
Frankie's a motherfucking,

2160
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:09,250
maybe it's on instagram.

2161
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:10,623
I wasn't there either.

2162
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:12,310
No,
wait.

2163
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:14,110
Took it down.
No Way.

2164
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:17,523
Hmm?

2165
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:23,970
You did you look under media,

2166
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:29,270
this picture of this Russian hammer
time.

2167
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,670
How long has that from a go?
How long ago?

2168
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:34,203
Hmm.

2169
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:36,130
There's no way it took it down.
Did he take it down?

2170
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:37,390
Okay.

2171
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:40,440
Tammy's is in square feet from today.
Just one.

2172
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:41,950
Was it an instagram post?

2173
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,063
Let's see.

2174
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,730
Um,
they take it down.

2175
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:52,330
Is that possible?
No,

2176
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:53,480
just found it,
Jamie.

2177
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:56,310
It's right there.
It's it.

2178
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,170
I googled it in three seconds.
How dare you,

2179
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:01,080
how dare you call,
pull it up.

2180
01:33:01,081 --> 01:33:02,850
Google it.
Okay.

2181
01:33:02,851 --> 01:33:06,450
So this is,
let's just play this while we're waiting

2182
01:33:06,451 --> 01:33:07,590
for you to get your shit together.

2183
01:33:09,810 --> 01:33:14,810
Oh,
that's the [inaudible]

2184
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:25,163
now,
um,

2185
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:28,160
show some of the other ones because
there's some other ones in the actual

2186
01:33:28,161 --> 01:33:30,320
casino itself that's in the lobby of the
casino.

2187
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:34,060
Nuts.
It's fucking mad.

2188
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:36,830
That's the same thing.
The second series that I sent you.

2189
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:38,620
Yeah.

2190
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,450
Is Madness,
man.

2191
01:33:40,510 --> 01:33:45,010
Just absolutely madness thing like this
with this following that Irish.

2192
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,170
I mean,
they just love fighting in their blood.

2193
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,670
And then you got this,
fuck the Muhammad.

2194
01:33:48,671 --> 01:33:52,270
I'll leave Ireland now and then some,
right.

2195
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,560
Ireland was always a,
always had battled with itself.

2196
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:59,620
Ireland because of the topography of
Ireland.

2197
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:01,750
It would break up into what they called
to us,

2198
01:34:01,751 --> 01:34:04,720
like clans and villages,
and they would always fight with each

2199
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:05,860
other.
So I don't want to hear a fucking

2200
01:34:05,861 --> 01:34:07,540
history lesson.
So here's the,

2201
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:09,100
here's the image,
see if he can find it.

2202
01:34:09,101 --> 01:34:09,934
Okay,

2203
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:12,960
well,
I was,

2204
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,050
uh,
it says Penn didn't Dot Co.

2205
01:34:16,051 --> 01:34:16,950
Dot.
UK.

2206
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:18,840
You can find it there.
It's a whole thing.

2207
01:34:18,841 --> 01:34:20,070
Wake up chosen.
It's all over.

2208
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:22,830
They've never had an a star like this.
They've always wanted it.

2209
01:34:22,831 --> 01:34:25,740
Even even guys who you know left on
their shield,

2210
01:34:25,741 --> 01:34:27,570
we get knocked out but came back.
They loved them.

2211
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:31,350
They were stars.
Now you have legit fucking superstar.

2212
01:34:31,530 --> 01:34:32,650
A murderer.
Yeah,

2213
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:36,810
I guy was mark and people.
I mean to go through all that,

2214
01:34:36,811 --> 01:34:40,380
the crazy UFC promo where they're
meeting in the middle of the fucking

2215
01:34:40,381 --> 01:34:45,000
strip and the fans behind them and the
million dollar fucking production value

2216
01:34:45,001 --> 01:34:47,730
of the commercial,
the giant world tour.

2217
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:52,500
And then I'll pulls out of the first
fight shows up for the second fight and

2218
01:34:52,501 --> 01:34:55,140
one fucking punch.
Deads them.

2219
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:58,070
I mean that is hit right.
You can't write that

2220
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:00,260
shit crazy.
That is a movie and a half.

2221
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:03,410
That is the greatest superstar that
country has ever known.

2222
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:05,060
An all combat sports.
This is,

2223
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,320
well,
that's just the image.

2224
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,710
If you go to the actual website,
it's right there.

2225
01:35:09,711 --> 01:35:10,820
Jamie.
Come on man.

2226
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,500
I'm Paul.
I just showed you how to get it.

2227
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:16,040
I googled it while I'm talking.
It's ain't hard to do.

2228
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:17,990
You're not mad.
No,

2229
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:19,263
no.
He loves it.

2230
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:24,170
He's no Anita Portafab that whatever it
says right there underneath it.

2231
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:26,000
By the way,
Eve Edwards called me and left me a

2232
01:35:26,001 --> 01:35:26,631
message.
He goes,

2233
01:35:26,631 --> 01:35:27,640
hey dude.
Um,

2234
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,410
I heard something weird.
Did you come out of the closet?

2235
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,420
Are you gay?
And then I've got another call from

2236
01:35:32,421 --> 01:35:33,460
Karen.
Same thing going,

2237
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:34,460
hey dude,
I heard you were gay.

2238
01:35:34,461 --> 01:35:35,960
I was like,
where are you hearing that?

2239
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:40,100
I came around in the candle.
How about you just got done for 20

2240
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:40,370
minutes?

2241
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:44,060
Slobbered over Luke rockhold maybe
people aren't having ido portal.

2242
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:46,130
You think people at first of all ido
portal.

2243
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:48,920
Don't make me say it again.
You know what I'm saying?

2244
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,470
It is.
Wake up Jose.

2245
01:35:51,471 --> 01:35:52,810
It's all over.
Oh,

2246
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:55,100
go back.
So you could see it all the way.

2247
01:35:55,230 --> 01:35:56,063
Look at this.
Oh,

2248
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:00,350
look at that fucking photo.
That is December 1st.

2249
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,780
That is just ridiculous.
Wow.

2250
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,400
So that's an old photo that he reposted.
Yes.

2251
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,500
Cause it came true.
Wow.

2252
01:36:09,501 --> 01:36:11,440
Interesting.
Wow.

2253
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:12,650
That's flat.
Two Tigers.

2254
01:36:12,651 --> 01:36:14,390
Just too real to be cool.
You know what I'm saying?

2255
01:36:14,391 --> 01:36:15,770
It looks like three d.
Yeah.

2256
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:18,310
It's not a good placement.
It's just when it's what you would get

2257
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,900
the apps like that man show the abs off.
He,

2258
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:23,030
I guess he doesn't give a fuck what he
looks like though.

2259
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,160
You know what?
As far as that goes to it doesn't have

2260
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:25,880
to do whatever.

2261
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:28,460
He wants to come bitches out making
money.

2262
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,200
Tell him the UFC.
What the fuck to do?

2263
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:34,370
What is he going to do when he retires?
I mean the amount of y'all some juice,

2264
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:39,371
it's going to be awesome juice and
adrenaline and excitement that's going

2265
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:44,720
through his veins right now.
Just the fucking electricity right now.

2266
01:36:44,721 --> 01:36:46,280
Like a promoter.
There'll be a promoter.

2267
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:49,640
How do you have shut the fuck up.
How do you ever,

2268
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:52,940
how do you ever match that?
It's all downhill from here.

2269
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,980
Down here.
You might go landscape style and dying a

2270
01:36:57,981 --> 01:36:59,510
small plane crash.
He might,

2271
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:00,920
I could see that.
I just don't,

2272
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:05,060
I don't know like a guy like this is
like the level of fame.

2273
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,130
Look at it.
Some guy got on top of the line in the

2274
01:37:07,131 --> 01:37:10,260
fucking Mgo security,
uh,

2275
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:12,590
off the line,
sir.

2276
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:14,030
That's where we draw the line.

2277
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:16,880
They don't give a fuck.
You seem in the streets beforehand.

2278
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:21,700
Did you hear about the Irish guys were
on their way to vegas and they have to,

2279
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:24,230
they kicked off the flight for fighting.
Yeah.

2280
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:25,620
Didn't even make it a lot.
Yeah.

2281
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,820
They didn't even make it to the fight.
Conor mcgregor fan did.

2282
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,690
My buddy went to a soccer game in
Ireland.

2283
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,340
They,
they didn't get to the stadium.

2284
01:37:31,341 --> 01:37:33,080
There were so many fights.
It was nuts.

2285
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:34,880
It's just what they do.
Yeah,

2286
01:37:34,881 --> 01:37:37,630
they're fucking animals.
It could be like a big ass movie stars.

2287
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:39,800
Oh yeah.
He says he's gotten offers.

2288
01:37:39,801 --> 01:37:43,760
He's not hold him for that.
You know what he's doing is smart and

2289
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:46,820
what Rondo did was not smart in that
regard,

2290
01:37:46,821 --> 01:37:49,790
that she got distracted and spread
herself thin.

2291
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,930
Took all of that short money,
you know,

2292
01:37:51,931 --> 01:37:53,900
it's a lot of money,
but took it all.

2293
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:56,730
Whereas Khan or like no danks

2294
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:58,770
I don't think any more than,
I don't think it made a difference.

2295
01:37:58,771 --> 01:38:00,850
I think Holly Holm is a different
fighter.

2296
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:03,450
I think she met a different file.
It's certainly made a difference.

2297
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:05,190
Brian,
when you distract yourself,

2298
01:38:05,191 --> 01:38:07,060
you are distracted.
That I understand.

2299
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:11,670
I understand.
This is what this is Brian standing up

2300
01:38:11,671 --> 01:38:14,010
for distractions.
Holly Holm is a hot,

2301
01:38:14,011 --> 01:38:16,590
much higher level striker and would have
been regardless.

2302
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:17,520
I don't,
I don't think,

2303
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,130
I just don't think,
uh,

2304
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:20,700
you can come meet with somebody like
that.

2305
01:38:20,701 --> 01:38:22,530
Who's that far advanced as a striker?
Well,

2306
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:25,200
certainly not striking and she's
stronger than Rhonda.

2307
01:38:25,201 --> 01:38:27,000
That's what it looked like to me.
He's drunk as fuck.

2308
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:28,050
Yeah.
Well you know,

2309
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:29,790
she's definitely leaner,
you know,

2310
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:34,290
and it looks more muscular and bigger
and she's fought as high as 152 pounds.

2311
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:37,230
And Rhonda,
correct me if I'm wrong,

2312
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:39,090
it's not a big double leg,
single lecture.

2313
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:40,760
She,
she's a junior person who just got to

2314
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:44,220
get her hips close to you.
So when she has people who in her camp,

2315
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:46,890
like this guy is,
he or whoever it is who can neutralize

2316
01:38:46,891 --> 01:38:48,270
that judo,
push your hips away,

2317
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:51,930
drop level when she gets close,
no drop in levels.

2318
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:52,920
Men,
here's the big thing,

2319
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:57,240
they just avoided that left arm.
Rhonda always ties up with that left

2320
01:38:57,241 --> 01:38:57,630
arm.
Yeah,

2321
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:00,960
I mean she does the same approach and
almost all of our fights and it works on

2322
01:39:00,961 --> 01:39:03,930
this amateur and it's not,
that's a good way of putting it.

2323
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,650
It's not to say that like she doesn't
have other approaches,

2324
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:11,100
but that is the approach that she's most
comfortable with and she goes to more

2325
01:39:11,101 --> 01:39:13,080
often.
And when it wasn't working,

2326
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,480
you know,
you fuck you that you had,

2327
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:20,630
you had that camp game planning and
they've seen a lot and I feel like

2328
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:24,390
they've gained plan for very,
very good fighters who are men who have

2329
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:25,740
a lot more complex.

2330
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:29,010
And Rhonda for those guys was probably
much easier to game plan.

2331
01:39:29,011 --> 01:39:30,750
And then they had holly Holm who has
been striking.

2332
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,520
I'm not talking to you,
man,

2333
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:36,520
man,
man.

2334
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:38,750
You know what I mean?
Old men like the guy's eyes.

2335
01:39:38,751 --> 01:39:40,530
I fuck guys like me.
Hey,

2336
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:41,610
hey,
hey,

2337
01:39:41,611 --> 01:39:42,960
you don't know that.
Well,

2338
01:39:42,961 --> 01:39:44,510
I just heard he came out of the closet.
I,

2339
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,760
that's what I heard from eve.
I don't Rhonda doing movies and these

2340
01:39:47,761 --> 01:39:48,930
distractions.
That's,

2341
01:39:48,990 --> 01:39:50,250
that's on her team.
That's not wrong.

2342
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:51,143
Yes.
People go,

2343
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:51,871
you should do this.
No,

2344
01:39:51,871 --> 01:39:54,570
you're fine.
You're so much better than we know that

2345
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:56,580
she's got some shit advice coming her
way.

2346
01:39:56,790 --> 01:40:00,060
But what is from a lot of people?
Yes.

2347
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:01,980
What is her camp like?
You've,

2348
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:03,660
you've been close to her while she's
training.

2349
01:40:03,661 --> 01:40:05,790
Like what is her camp like?
Uh,

2350
01:40:05,890 --> 01:40:07,900
you know,
I'm not gonna go into crazy detail.

2351
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:11,910
All I know she works harder than anyone.
So if she gets with the right people,

2352
01:40:11,911 --> 01:40:14,250
she's going to be a lot better.
If she gets with the right team that

2353
01:40:14,251 --> 01:40:16,350
says,
maybe don't do this movie right now,

2354
01:40:16,351 --> 01:40:18,300
maybe let's save this move after you
beat holly.

2355
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:21,330
Maybe let's do this then.
It's not a problem now too,

2356
01:40:21,331 --> 01:40:23,480
because if she's prepping for the
rematches and she,

2357
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:27,390
we're about to go do that roadhouse
and isn't a problem.

2358
01:40:27,391 --> 01:40:30,500
That roadhouse movie,
like movies are hard to sell when you're

2359
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:33,090
a bad ass.
When the world knows and that your last

2360
01:40:33,091 --> 01:40:34,690
fight,
you got flat lined.

2361
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:38,280
I would suggest it wouldn't be
surprising to me the way Hollywood

2362
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:40,710
Hollywood works there,
where they go.

2363
01:40:40,711 --> 01:40:43,800
A lot of this movie is built on you
being the baddest girl on the planet and

2364
01:40:43,801 --> 01:40:46,800
undefeated.
Don't be surprised if sometimes those

2365
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:50,220
kinds of movies fall through or they
downgrade or maybe they just don't

2366
01:40:50,221 --> 01:40:52,620
happen.
I wonder what kind of contract is

2367
01:40:52,621 --> 01:40:54,100
involved.
She's got like big

2368
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,860
time movie agents,
like a wonder if that was like built in

2369
01:40:56,861 --> 01:40:59,200
protection against that shit.
I would assume there is.

2370
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:01,750
If I'm Dana White,
I go look at me,

2371
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:05,020
you're not doing amy fucking movies,
your contracts with us.

2372
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:06,850
We're not giving permission to do any of
this.

2373
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:10,030
So anyone who says yes,
you can make a movie and still beat

2374
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:12,070
Holly,
I fire right now.

2375
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,860
Anyone who goes,
you can do this and still do and still

2376
01:41:14,861 --> 01:41:17,530
be world champion is full of Shit.
It's just not true.

2377
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:20,710
What do you think about her fighting
holly in July?

2378
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:25,590
Uh,
I don't,

2379
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:28,960
I don't know man.
What the fuck she going to do if you

2380
01:41:28,961 --> 01:41:29,650
shoot,
if she'd make,

2381
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:32,370
if she's filming roadhouse while Holly's
focused,

2382
01:41:32,371 --> 01:41:33,430
like you just talked,
call you the other day,

2383
01:41:33,431 --> 01:41:34,810
right?
Well she wanted to train.

2384
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:36,880
She wants to go right back to the gym
after the fight.

2385
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,130
Yes.
She might have gone to a fucking hotel

2386
01:41:39,131 --> 01:41:43,090
room and hit pads and Rhonda can eat
solid foods and then she's going to make

2387
01:41:43,091 --> 01:41:47,230
a movie and then jump into camp in the
same camp that has been telling her to

2388
01:41:47,231 --> 01:41:48,640
do all this stuff,
you know,

2389
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,170
and the same,
you know,

2390
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:51,730
it's tough man.
God,

2391
01:41:52,330 --> 01:41:55,630
God blessed her.
Hopefully shit works out but it's a

2392
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:57,780
mother fucker man.
It is a motherfucker,

2393
01:41:57,790 --> 01:41:59,440
right?
If you wanted to get ready for a fight

2394
01:41:59,441 --> 01:42:02,800
like that,
you would want to go through a battery

2395
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:06,010
of physical tests like as far as your
brain goes,

2396
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:11,640
cat scans,
Mris like that was a fucking wall up she

2397
01:42:11,711 --> 01:42:13,960
took.
And when you know,

2398
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:16,690
well I've had people on like Doctor
Rhonda,

2399
01:42:16,691 --> 01:42:20,620
Patrick and Dr. Mark Gordon who talk
about the damage to the pituitary gland

2400
01:42:20,621 --> 01:42:24,700
and what happens when you get chaos like
that and how important rest is in

2401
01:42:24,701 --> 01:42:27,850
recovery and how long it takes to
recover from something like that.

2402
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:30,370
And then we saw the,
the Anderson fight that we're just

2403
01:42:30,371 --> 01:42:32,420
talking about how Anderson,
he's take this tremendous punch.

2404
01:42:32,421 --> 01:42:35,110
Then he fought Weidman and you know,
it wasn't the same guy anymore.

2405
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:38,020
Like to jump right back in like this,
look at,

2406
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:41,410
look at Mendez to Mendez,
gets knocked out by connor,

2407
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:43,750
gets right back in there.
We've never seen him get dropped.

2408
01:42:43,751 --> 01:42:46,190
So he's not just drop flatline with one
file.

2409
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:47,020
Yeah,
yeah.

2410
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:48,300
I mean he came back and,
and frank,

2411
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,020
he's not,
you know,

2412
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:53,380
Frankie's a motherfucker man.
He throws combos and he's very active

2413
01:42:53,381 --> 01:42:54,310
and he stays,
you know,

2414
01:42:54,311 --> 01:42:56,650
he's more of a barrage of punches and
Combo Poncho.

2415
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:59,950
But Frank is not a knockout artist by
any means.

2416
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:02,550
And there's also the factor of kind of
getting,

2417
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,500
I wonder,
I would imagine any fighter who gets in

2418
01:43:05,501 --> 01:43:09,130
the ring and realizes that they are
just,

2419
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:11,510
that's a riddle that's very hard to
solve right now.

2420
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:14,100
I would imagine for Ronda,
as great as she is and this athletic or

2421
01:43:14,101 --> 01:43:15,280
she has,
you know,

2422
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:20,400
there's no doubt that Holly Holm looked
like she was just far advanced in how to

2423
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:24,010
dispatch somebody with kicks and she was
disguising her cakes,

2424
01:43:24,011 --> 01:43:26,800
punching and stuff like that.
I would imagine there's an emotional

2425
01:43:26,801 --> 01:43:29,080
factor which is,
can I even do this?

2426
01:43:29,081 --> 01:43:31,090
Can I solve this riddle riddle in six
months?

2427
01:43:31,091 --> 01:43:33,520
That's a,
that's not a lot of time to catch up to

2428
01:43:33,521 --> 01:43:36,820
somebody who's that good.
Also to let all the dust settle.

2429
01:43:36,821 --> 01:43:39,550
As far as like the devastation to your
motions,

2430
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:44,440
your confidence or you know Ron does his
very special kind of pit bull.

2431
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:46,930
Is She chomping at the bit to get back
in there?

2432
01:43:46,931 --> 01:43:49,470
I mean is she like,
she's just straight up spreading.

2433
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,520
She's a special person and don't think
there's a middle ground either.

2434
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:56,750
I think she's going to come back and
just be a fucking demon or we're going

2435
01:43:56,751 --> 01:44:00,020
to see a shell and she's going to get
fucking kicked in the face again and we

2436
01:44:00,021 --> 01:44:01,400
never see her again.
I don't want to see it.

2437
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:04,310
I don't think there's a middle ground.
Even if she comes back in fucking

2438
01:44:04,311 --> 01:44:07,910
phenomenal shape and gets fired up and
motivated and does everything the right

2439
01:44:07,911 --> 01:44:10,400
way and no distractions.
Holly might still mark.

2440
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:12,650
I agree.
Still don't have the skills to stand

2441
01:44:12,651 --> 01:44:13,461
there with,
with,

2442
01:44:13,461 --> 01:44:14,920
and move in.
And she goes,

2443
01:44:15,190 --> 01:44:17,630
she can't take holly down.
She's hot.

2444
01:44:17,690 --> 01:44:19,970
And not only that,
what of Holly's game plans even

2445
01:44:19,971 --> 01:44:21,500
different this time.
What if she moyie ties?

2446
01:44:21,501 --> 01:44:24,020
They'll fuck out of those legs.
Cause let me tell you something about

2447
01:44:24,021 --> 01:44:25,940
Holly Holm.
That girl's got legs like a

2448
01:44:25,941 --> 01:44:29,090
thoroughbred.
See Her bouncing around the Austin and

2449
01:44:29,091 --> 01:44:30,770
do those flip flips.
Well,

2450
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:33,110
who's got Brian Keller Hawks Game Plan
for you?

2451
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:37,890
Greg Jackson right now,
or the ladder over in Glendale.

2452
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:39,380
You know what I'm saying?
You got sick,

2453
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,720
you got six,
you got six months,

2454
01:44:41,721 --> 01:44:42,620
son.
Wow.

2455
01:44:42,621 --> 01:44:45,410
Six months of the mad scientist Greg
Jackson going,

2456
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:47,600
this is what we did this time.
This is where we're gonna do this time.

2457
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:51,200
And Mike Winkeljohn and Izzy and Izzy.
Yikes.

2458
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:52,910
Oh,
and that she has confidence.

2459
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:55,490
Oh and John Jones in her camp and they
trained together.

2460
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,013
I'd fake an injury.

2461
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:00,760
That's what I do.
Yeah.

2462
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:03,890
I mean she wants to fight her.
I mean she thinks she's going to get me,

2463
01:45:03,891 --> 01:45:05,880
she's going to get images.
It's going to get eat.

2464
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,280
She's going to get eaten up by Holly
Holm.

2465
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:10,220
Well,
do you know all due respect and Misha is

2466
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:13,070
not going to fight that way.
She's not going to charge after a

2467
01:45:13,071 --> 01:45:15,110
different animal.
It's a different fight.

2468
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:17,510
It's,
I don't know who would fight me.

2469
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:19,460
She is me.
She's got a different style of

2470
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:22,460
takedowns.
She'll shoot for doubles if she gets to

2471
01:45:22,461 --> 01:45:23,420
clinch,
she'll very,

2472
01:45:23,421 --> 01:45:25,910
her approach.
She's got ricky lundell working with her

2473
01:45:25,911 --> 01:45:28,940
who was also an excellent coach and
coach.

2474
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:34,220
She's got some good things going for it.
And then you know what you're dealing

2475
01:45:34,221 --> 01:45:36,980
with also is when you see a fight or get
into the octagon,

2476
01:45:36,981 --> 01:45:39,350
you don't know what kind of injuries
they've had.

2477
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:42,260
You don't know what they're dealing with
in training camp that they're trying to

2478
01:45:42,261 --> 01:45:44,450
overcome.
Like when Luke rockhold said after the

2479
01:45:44,451 --> 01:45:47,180
fight they had staph infection.
Like I talked to Bob Cook about it.

2480
01:45:47,181 --> 01:45:50,330
Bob Cook right when I go congratulate,
she goes,

2481
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:51,710
he almost fucking pulled out of the
fight.

2482
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:52,340
I go,
what?

2483
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:52,970
He goes,
yeah,

2484
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:55,820
he's just had really bad staff.
He's been on antibiotics for two weeks

2485
01:45:55,821 --> 01:45:58,310
ago.
You fucking kidding me because you never

2486
01:45:58,311 --> 01:46:00,800
know.
When holly fought Raquel Pennington,

2487
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:04,010
she did not look very good.
And that was one of the reasons why I

2488
01:46:04,011 --> 01:46:06,290
didn't think that was a good fight to
have right now.

2489
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:09,560
She had a split decision victory over
Raquel Pennington.

2490
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:11,060
I mean,
Raquel almost beat her.

2491
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:13,490
She came within a hair of beating her.
Let me ask you this,

2492
01:46:13,491 --> 01:46:13,970
Joe,
with,

2493
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:14,870
you know,
with these,

2494
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:18,740
I want to say more well rounded
athletes.

2495
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:22,400
Whenever we see a fighter who charges
like it's almost no skill just to rush

2496
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:24,230
forward,
they get fucked up by the better

2497
01:46:24,231 --> 01:46:25,430
fighter.
See,

2498
01:46:25,431 --> 01:46:28,070
Aldo fucked up,
Rhonda fucked up.

2499
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:30,290
We see these people,
they also fight.

2500
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:33,080
So emotionally come straight forward and
then you see the more talented find it

2501
01:46:33,081 --> 01:46:34,970
like what the fuck pink.
Yeah,

2502
01:46:34,971 --> 01:46:36,400
you can't do that.
Can't do it.

2503
01:46:36,401 --> 01:46:39,110
And it was way more successful than Aldo
at it and she,

2504
01:46:39,111 --> 01:46:41,800
she's fighting less for competitions.
So it worked well.

2505
01:46:41,830 --> 01:46:44,960
Holly's a fucking Hoe for women.
Holly is very high level,

2506
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:47,180
high level it,
well not only didn't work,

2507
01:46:47,181 --> 01:46:50,250
but she ate a lot of shots before one,
it took her ass.

2508
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,360
That's what I'm saying,
the superior athletes who it's like,

2509
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:54,700
you're going to rush forward and do
what?

2510
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:56,010
I'm want to fuck you up.
Right.

2511
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:58,860
Rhonda does have a fucking phenomenal
Chin if you,

2512
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:00,150
I don't,
hopefully still,

2513
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:04,470
but you look at the shots that she took
that fucking elbow at one elbow that

2514
01:47:04,471 --> 01:47:07,420
clean as she's coming after she blasts
or in the job with our mom.

2515
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,490
We ever seen her get hit by a really
good strike.

2516
01:47:10,491 --> 01:47:11,250
Yes.
Yeah.

2517
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:13,080
And you know,
it was one of the things that we were

2518
01:47:13,081 --> 01:47:16,860
discussing before the fight of like what
you got to watch out for holly.

2519
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:18,870
Um,
when we're doing the pre preflight

2520
01:47:18,871 --> 01:47:19,531
breakdown,
I was like,

2521
01:47:19,531 --> 01:47:23,370
she's so good at shielding our kicks
with punches.

2522
01:47:23,371 --> 01:47:25,980
You don't see him coming.
She's hitting you at the end of these

2523
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:27,870
punches.
And then the kicks already coming.

2524
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,360
You know,
when you watch our RFA fight,

2525
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:30,930
it was an RFA.

2526
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:33,120
She fought and we'd watch all her other,
um,

2527
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:36,180
MMA fights and smaller organizations,
those kicks come out of nowhere,

2528
01:47:36,181 --> 01:47:37,200
man.
You know,

2529
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:39,450
and she,
she knows when to land them.

2530
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:41,820
You know,
she doesn't show them until she's ready

2531
01:47:41,821 --> 01:47:44,970
to land them and they'll buy blanks.
You see a parade in Albuquerque,

2532
01:47:44,971 --> 01:47:47,640
20,000 now.
Really?

2533
01:47:47,641 --> 01:47:51,120
20,000 people came out to see her in
Albuquerque.

2534
01:47:51,121 --> 01:47:54,120
She told me,
she told me she's happy to be in vegas

2535
01:47:54,121 --> 01:47:56,010
cause at least it's relaxed.
Gosh,

2536
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:59,120
she can't go anywhere in Albuquerque.
She said she tried to take uh,

2537
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,440
she tries to go to a restaurant and have
a meal.

2538
01:48:01,650 --> 01:48:05,610
There's a line of people at her table
that want to take photos with sauce and

2539
01:48:05,611 --> 01:48:07,260
put food in her mouth.
That's exhausting.

2540
01:48:07,790 --> 01:48:08,461
That,
that's,

2541
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:13,050
that's managing champion ship.
Managing for tension for those people

2542
01:48:13,051 --> 01:48:14,580
are fucking rude.
Don't know.

2543
01:48:14,581 --> 01:48:17,640
Mess with someone when they're eating.
That is what it was later.

2544
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:20,040
Well for tall,
I can't believe I'm seeing you,

2545
01:48:20,041 --> 01:48:21,630
Holly Holm.
I don't care about your state.

2546
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:24,530
What about me?
Oh you think you're too good for me.

2547
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:27,780
Deal with it.
You deal with that in a crazy way.

2548
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,400
Oh,
I don't deal with it like she deals with

2549
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:31,480
it.
I like that 70 people waiting in line to

2550
01:48:31,481 --> 01:48:34,290
deal with some shit you deal with.
Ebi is like,

2551
01:48:34,291 --> 01:48:36,210
good Lord Man.
Are we ever going to get in here?

2552
01:48:36,211 --> 01:48:38,100
Yeah.
It gets a little weird but it doesn't

2553
01:48:38,101 --> 01:48:41,040
get,
it's also different because I'm a man

2554
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:43,320
like there's not a bunch of people
looking to rape me.

2555
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:44,340
Right.
You know what I mean?

2556
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:45,460
Like grape and holly Holm.
She,

2557
01:48:46,110 --> 01:48:47,780
she didn't kick you right in the deck.
The deck.

2558
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:50,120
Go ahead and try and shut pancake that
Dick here.

2559
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:52,350
So a couple of girls,
you don't want to try and read a screen

2560
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,510
and do that hike,
hike,

2561
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:57,130
hike,
that time hitting mitts.

2562
01:48:57,131 --> 01:48:59,040
Now I make the I holly home.
The people are like,

2563
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:00,090
is that Holly Holm?
Nah,

2564
01:49:00,091 --> 01:49:00,750
it's Brian Callen.

2565
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:02,020
Holy Shit.
He's got the same thing.

2566
01:49:02,021 --> 01:49:03,540
I can tell the difference when you hear
the impact.

2567
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:05,430
I don't know man.
I don't know.

2568
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:07,140
I got Chris,
I got crisp,

2569
01:49:07,141 --> 01:49:09,390
crisp strike.
I've seen you kicked the bag and it was

2570
01:49:09,391 --> 01:49:10,650
very sad.
That's not true.

2571
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:12,210
That's not true because I wasn't opening
up.

2572
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:15,060
If I open up when I open up dust or
killed,

2573
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:15,950
well,
when I do this,

2574
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:19,950
but my next duty is going to have a full
like gym set up.

2575
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,110
I'll let you kick it out.
We'll videotape.

2576
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:24,730
It's going to be scary,
but you're gonna let me three quarter,

2577
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:29,400
you're going to kick and then you're
gonna kick trying to do that and I won't

2578
01:49:29,401 --> 01:49:30,420
do that.
I kicked very hard.

2579
01:49:30,421 --> 01:49:32,220
Don't make,
I kicked very hard.

2580
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:34,020
They call me,
they call me Brian.

2581
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,670
My nickname,
when I find them,

2582
01:49:35,671 --> 01:49:37,130
you don't have a dick next.
I do it.

2583
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:40,790
They call me Brian rockhold calendar.
Call me Brian the front.

2584
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:43,200
You don't want to stage.
Well,

2585
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:44,034
they do that now

2586
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,780
when we do the live shows,
but then it goes,

2587
01:49:49,781 --> 01:49:50,800
let's see,
kick.

2588
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:56,130
Oh God.
My wheel kick case say I need to do is

2589
01:49:56,201 --> 01:49:59,170
get you some of these barbell jeans.
He could throw up two kicks with Tom.

2590
01:49:59,171 --> 01:50:01,930
Obsessed with those please.
This is the shit man.

2591
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:04,140
Apparently a diesel diesel makes them
too.

2592
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:07,270
We get to deal.
I need something I have a beautiful

2593
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:09,790
backside get ahold of.
I'm sure they follow you.

2594
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:10,780
All right.
Get Ahold of me.

2595
01:50:10,781 --> 01:50:12,430
Lazy.
Fuck Jesus Christ.

2596
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:15,550
And these chairs can always just order
them these chairs and let's get some

2597
01:50:15,551 --> 01:50:17,560
barbells.
Ergo depot.

2598
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,310
Let me,
let me see what you were called.

2599
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:20,770
Pisco.
Pisco.

2600
01:50:20,771 --> 01:50:21,670
The genes.
Stand out.

2601
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:23,290
Let me see how tight they are.
I know they're not.

2602
01:50:23,470 --> 01:50:24,710
They're not.
They're tight.

2603
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:29,020
Dickerson Rogan has a thing.
I know he does.

2604
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:30,700
That's not bad,
dude.

2605
01:50:30,701 --> 01:50:32,650
They're like sweat pants.
Look like that,

2606
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:33,040
bro.

2607
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,450
You're basically wearing joggers,
dude.

2608
01:50:34,451 --> 01:50:36,040
You're like Addison's job with those
knees.

2609
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:38,350
Like no judges,
no binding.

2610
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,080
Ridiculously flexible.
Like you really,

2611
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:42,610
it's so stupid.
You show off in Yoga.

2612
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:43,960
No,
just do yoga.

2613
01:50:43,961 --> 01:50:46,360
There's girls in my class that are a
hundred times more flexible than me.

2614
01:50:46,361 --> 01:50:48,610
This is one Indian chick and my yoga
class.

2615
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:51,550
He does that.
A bow pose where she gets her foot

2616
01:50:51,551 --> 01:50:54,160
literally up in the air like way above
her head.

2617
01:50:54,190 --> 01:50:55,080
Crazy.
It's insane.

2618
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:56,430
It's crazy like that.
I silly.

2619
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:58,600
I just sit there like this.
You get competitive.

2620
01:50:58,630 --> 01:51:00,880
I don't get comparing.
I don't want to blow my asshole out.

2621
01:51:00,881 --> 01:51:05,881
So I just said,
how often you've been doing this yoga.

2622
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:08,560
Three times a week.
That's awesome dude.

2623
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:10,600
It's so good for your body,
right,

2624
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:11,860
that man.
Do you feel like your body,

2625
01:51:11,890 --> 01:51:14,290
like your back's loosening up and loosen
on everything?

2626
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:16,030
For me it's more of a mental thing.

2627
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:18,700
It's just feel great after I do it.
Me Too.

2628
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:20,450
More compassionate,
relaxed.

2629
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:21,850
I'm bored.
I'm bored.

2630
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:24,730
I don't want to say I'm bored with
Jujitsu,

2631
01:51:24,731 --> 01:51:26,080
but it's,
it's all the same to me.

2632
01:51:26,081 --> 01:51:27,670
You know,
like I'm going to the same guy so I

2633
01:51:27,671 --> 01:51:29,540
wasn't feeling like,
why don't you move around,

2634
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:32,120
go to a different job.
But you go in gear.

2635
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:33,190
I'll know gay.
Uh,

2636
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:34,330
just depends.
I'll do both.

2637
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,520
I'll do both a lot.
A lot of Gnocchi,

2638
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:38,260
but I'll do both.
Just have you thought about doing

2639
01:51:38,261 --> 01:51:40,510
Jujitsu competitions?
Do you let them know we're not finding

2640
01:51:40,511 --> 01:51:44,680
the time to put the proper training into
it and just because of doing the podcast

2641
01:51:44,681 --> 01:51:47,440
or to have a kid?
Everything lot going on.

2642
01:51:47,441 --> 01:51:49,720
Podcast shows everything,
man.

2643
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:51,370
It takes,
it takes a lot of time.

2644
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:54,670
He does dark and dicing and everything
and I wouldn't want to do myself a

2645
01:51:54,671 --> 01:51:56,380
disservice by showing up half ass.

2646
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:57,550
Like,
I would never do that.

2647
01:51:57,551 --> 01:52:01,030
So I can be 100% that there's no way I'd
sign up for one.

2648
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:04,480
What if like Metamorris came at you or
one of those other organizations?

2649
01:52:04,481 --> 01:52:09,481
It's like Ebi,
I would help if Eddie approached me and

2650
01:52:10,530 --> 01:52:12,220
we talked about it at the right timing.
I do it.

2651
01:52:12,250 --> 01:52:15,960
I don't know if I'd do metamorris again,
just cause personal issues,

2652
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:17,131
but with,
with,

2653
01:52:17,131 --> 01:52:19,940
with Eddie,
if like some super fight type deal.

2654
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:20,770
I love Eddie.
If you,

2655
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:21,461
if he said,
hey,

2656
01:52:21,461 --> 01:52:23,950
I want you to do super fight here and it
was the right time,

2657
01:52:23,951 --> 01:52:24,970
I'd do it.
What'd you fight me?

2658
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:26,470
What'd you fight?
Cyborg again.

2659
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,570
Now when I say Cyborg for folks
listening,

2660
01:52:28,571 --> 01:52:30,890
we're not talking about Christina.
Is it Chris?

2661
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:31,960
Christine,
Christina.

2662
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,320
CYBORG females.
Yeah.

2663
01:52:35,470 --> 01:52:38,260
We used to be Santos and Justino I think
it is.

2664
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:39,100
I think you're right.

2665
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:40,940
Um,
she's uh,

2666
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:43,960
uh,
invicta women's 145 pound champion.

2667
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:45,110
We're talking about,
uh,

2668
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:46,520
Ricardo,
Ricardo Abreu,

2669
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:51,910
who's also known as Cyborg and not to be
confused with Cyborg evangelists.

2670
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:55,760
He's also the number one grappling in
the world.

2671
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:56,690
Yes.
Well,

2672
01:52:56,691 --> 01:53:00,230
he's very high.
Is there a number one guy,

2673
01:53:00,231 --> 01:53:02,870
number one,
because he beat booze Shesha last year I

2674
01:53:02,871 --> 01:53:06,800
think in Abu Dhabi.
So he technically he was an absolute,

2675
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:10,400
he's a fucking monster fucking monster
and this tornado guard,

2676
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,180
goddammit man,
you watch that guy's fucking,

2677
01:53:13,181 --> 01:53:13,790
he's,
he's,

2678
01:53:13,790 --> 01:53:15,200
he's amazing.
He's amazing.

2679
01:53:15,201 --> 01:53:18,420
And his strength and conditioning videos
are also super inspirational.

2680
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:21,980
The crazy shit that he does that cause
I'm a fan man and,

2681
01:53:21,981 --> 01:53:25,250
and you know what else I like about him?
He's like a crazy world traveler.

2682
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:27,820
He goes all around the world that goes
on travel,

2683
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:30,230
so see the world and I follow him on
instagram.

2684
01:53:30,231 --> 01:53:31,000
It's really cool.

2685
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,840
Yeah.
Like he's like dude talking about

2686
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:34,380
wanderlust.
Like he loves like going,

2687
01:53:34,381 --> 01:53:36,380
he was in South Africa,
he goes to Africa,

2688
01:53:36,381 --> 01:53:39,680
he goes all these different places like
every couple months is instagram is him

2689
01:53:39,681 --> 01:53:42,890
and some new country like having a good
time doing Jujitsu.

2690
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:44,300
Like he did.
He does.

2691
01:53:44,301 --> 01:53:45,770
He posts pictures of his girl on this.
Graham,

2692
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:48,890
I don't know her ass.
You could sit this fucking coke.

2693
01:53:50,150 --> 01:53:51,470
Rarely she walked by,
I was like,

2694
01:53:51,471 --> 01:53:54,020
God damn,
you might've got a shop shut down.

2695
01:53:54,021 --> 01:53:56,110
But you when my man here,
girl is reading,

2696
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:58,340
he's a big handsome so's yours by the
way.

2697
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:01,300
Both you guys shut them down there too.

2698
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:08,750
It's a double shot shot shot.
Look at that.

2699
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:10,700
Oh Shit.
Neutralize

2700
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:18,110
shop out loud.
That would be fascinating.

2701
01:54:18,111 --> 01:54:21,800
Notice he guys under that rule set to
that Ebi rule set is dope.

2702
01:54:21,801 --> 01:54:24,140
I love the fucking what we're talking
about.

2703
01:54:24,141 --> 01:54:27,470
Eddie Bravo put together this
invitational tournament that Brendan and

2704
01:54:27,471 --> 01:54:30,170
I went to yesterday and Joey Diaz and
um,

2705
01:54:30,171 --> 01:54:34,130
it was fucking sensational.
Best I've ever seen.

2706
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:35,680
So goody this morning I said,
Bro,

2707
01:54:35,681 --> 01:54:37,940
I been a lot of Jews to competitions.
I've been in,

2708
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:39,560
you know,
high level in myself.

2709
01:54:39,561 --> 01:54:41,650
I've never seen anything like that from
start to beginning.

2710
01:54:41,651 --> 01:54:42,950
You're like,
Oh shit,

2711
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:47,120
this is what that's great about it.
It cuts out all of the,

2712
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:49,640
like there's no,
no one's going to be in danger.

2713
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,070
It's going to be,
you know,

2714
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:53,630
like a total stalemate.
Even if it's a total stalemate,

2715
01:54:53,631 --> 01:54:55,970
which some of them were at the end of 10
minutes.

2716
01:54:56,330 --> 01:55:00,650
You go into positions like you remember
in wrestling how you'd start off,

2717
01:55:00,690 --> 01:55:03,350
uh,
behind someone will in this Eddie,

2718
01:55:03,351 --> 01:55:06,260
we'll start you off.
You have a choice of one or two options.

2719
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:07,700
You can take.
Spider web.

2720
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:10,640
Spider web means someone's defending the
arm bar,

2721
01:55:10,641 --> 01:55:13,410
but you have both legs locked on them,
on the ground there.

2722
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:17,360
They're on their back flat.
You're inside control with one arm

2723
01:55:17,361 --> 01:55:19,370
hooked and you are,
you're holding onto the leg.

2724
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:20,600
That's how you're allowed to start.
Ready,

2725
01:55:20,601 --> 01:55:21,434
set,
go.

2726
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,860
Can you start from there?
Or the other position is you take the

2727
01:55:24,861 --> 01:55:26,090
back,
both hooks in,

2728
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:26,721
over,
under,

2729
01:55:26,721 --> 01:55:29,810
not under the Chin but over under it
like this and they're allowed to hold

2730
01:55:29,811 --> 01:55:31,130
on.
They're defending the,

2731
01:55:31,131 --> 01:55:32,450
they hold on your hand,
ready,

2732
01:55:32,451 --> 01:55:33,284
set,
go.

2733
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:36,620
And then it's a battle for their,
so everyone's in fucking danger.

2734
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:38,120
Yeah,
everyone's in danger.

2735
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:41,270
It's really similar to college football
overtime where they built,

2736
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:43,160
you're both in a dangerous position.

2737
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:45,900
Whoever scores first.
And then the cool thing is,

2738
01:55:45,901 --> 01:55:49,090
is whoever got out fastest at the end
and she wants,

2739
01:55:49,170 --> 01:55:51,210
so if there's no,
there's no submission.

2740
01:55:51,211 --> 01:55:53,970
So they'll do like three rounds of it.
Is it three rounds?

2741
01:55:53,971 --> 01:55:56,130
So you bounce back and forth.
One you want,

2742
01:55:56,131 --> 01:55:57,160
you go,
you go,

2743
01:55:57,161 --> 01:56:00,330
there you go.
He gets his manager or whoever taps the

2744
01:56:00,331 --> 01:56:04,710
person first gets it.
But if you go and you tap him,

2745
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:07,680
he has an opportunity to tap you next
cause he gets position.

2746
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:10,260
It's incredible.
It's so good.

2747
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,150
So there is,
we're at the orpheum,

2748
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:14,190
it's sold out.
There's thousands of people.

2749
01:56:14,191 --> 01:56:16,590
They're fucking Jujitsu fans and they're
going crazy.

2750
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,450
We had so much fun.
Wow.

2751
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:21,260
It was so good for Eddie.
Bravo is killing it.

2752
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:22,920
He's fucking killing it.
It's you.

2753
01:56:22,930 --> 01:56:24,900
Any problems?
Got 50 fucking schools.

2754
01:56:24,930 --> 01:56:27,030
Okay.
I think more now I'm saying 50 that's

2755
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:28,530
the last count I know of.

2756
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:31,440
I think he opened up a couple more of
them all across the country has got

2757
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:34,230
affiliates in other countries.
How about an eggshell?

2758
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:36,870
Yeah.
Amazing.

2759
01:56:36,871 --> 01:56:41,070
$50,000 grand prize.
He's going to be a mogul for grappling

2760
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:42,680
for grappling.
50 grand.

2761
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:46,890
It's about if such a geek is about doing
what you do really well and focusing

2762
01:56:46,891 --> 01:56:49,590
just on that though,
it look like I'm loving it and he's got

2763
01:56:49,591 --> 01:56:53,700
the best personality ever.
He's just such a character and he's,

2764
01:56:53,701 --> 01:56:57,870
he's joking around while he's like
referees saying funny things while he's

2765
01:56:57,871 --> 01:56:59,600
referencing but not trying.
Right.

2766
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:01,110
You know,
like something happened and he jokes

2767
01:57:01,111 --> 01:57:02,700
around about it.
It was great.

2768
01:57:04,230 --> 01:57:05,510
We enjoyed the fuck out of it.
Yeah.

2769
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:09,600
It's just so nice to see someone figured
out a way to make grappling really

2770
01:57:09,601 --> 01:57:11,980
excited was planning to leave early.
I'm like in an idea and it was,

2771
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:12,750
I was like,
what?

2772
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:15,690
Like can I get a little depressed?
But that,

2773
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:18,110
you know,
cause usually just who takes forever and

2774
01:57:18,111 --> 01:57:19,960
it's like kind of boring.
Yeah.

2775
01:57:20,030 --> 01:57:23,760
Shit was railing well,
I wasn't going to miss it for the world.

2776
01:57:23,761 --> 01:57:24,460
In fact,
I,

2777
01:57:24,460 --> 01:57:27,450
I flew in from Vegas,
I got up at five in the morning.

2778
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:31,500
I went from Vegas,
I took the airplane to La,

2779
01:57:31,501 --> 01:57:35,040
drove to Disney land,
hung out with my family till four

2780
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:36,720
o'clock.
God in my car.

2781
01:57:36,721 --> 01:57:40,160
Drove to Eddie's thing,
went from five to eight 30 at Eddie's

2782
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:41,003
fucking nuts,
man.

2783
01:57:41,070 --> 01:57:43,020
You know how you,
I think on the Whitney Cummings

2784
01:57:43,021 --> 01:57:45,240
podcasts,
you said you look at Kevin Hart and he

2785
01:57:45,241 --> 01:57:47,070
makes you feel lazy so you want to work
harder.

2786
01:57:47,590 --> 01:57:48,990
Yeah.
I think you mentioned something like

2787
01:57:48,991 --> 01:57:50,460
that.
That's how you,

2788
01:57:50,461 --> 01:57:51,630
what,
this is what you do for me,

2789
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:54,150
like I was talking about it with someone
the other day.

2790
01:57:54,290 --> 01:57:55,200
I was,
I'm sorry to me about it.

2791
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:55,771
Let's do,
yeah,

2792
01:57:55,771 --> 01:57:56,281
I'm like,
dude,

2793
01:57:56,281 --> 01:57:59,040
what don the podcast yet,
because sometimes on a,

2794
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:00,480
I'm,
I'm still in my,

2795
01:58:00,570 --> 01:58:03,360
uh,
fighter kind of mindset where it's like,

2796
01:58:03,361 --> 01:58:04,470
okay,
Monday through Friday,

2797
01:58:04,471 --> 01:58:08,580
do work Saturday takeoff Sunday,
take completely off and then reset on

2798
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:10,410
Monday and then Wednesdays light days.
So,

2799
01:58:10,411 --> 01:58:11,730
you know,
I'm kind of used to that,

2800
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:14,160
but there's none of that in this world.
I'm in now.

2801
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:16,500
Scheduling,
we're doing that web series,

2802
01:58:16,501 --> 01:58:18,000
not when we're doing coming up with
ideas,

2803
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:21,210
but all of this man.
And then I touch you.

2804
01:58:21,211 --> 01:58:21,691
I'm like,
dude,

2805
01:58:21,691 --> 01:58:23,490
you're fucking nuts.
I can't believe you do that.

2806
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:24,630
And you texted me,
he said,

2807
01:58:24,631 --> 01:58:28,020
I don't waste time.
I screenshot that.

2808
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,600
You're like,
I don't fucking waste time.

2809
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:31,890
Like he's fucking,
somebody wanted your number.

2810
01:58:31,891 --> 01:58:32,481
Who was,
you know,

2811
01:58:32,481 --> 01:58:33,314
um,
and uh,

2812
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:34,650
you were like,
you know what?

2813
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:36,390
I don't have time for people like that.
I don't,

2814
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:37,890
I don't want to deal with that with
their dues.

2815
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:39,360
Yeah.
I,

2816
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:42,510
there's,
there's I a lot of things and what I've

2817
01:58:42,511 --> 01:58:45,670
found that the best way to live my life
from me,

2818
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:47,320
I'm not saying you know,
other people,

2819
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:50,440
some people really love their life to
sit around and fuck off.

2820
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:52,600
When I sit around and fuck off,
I don't like me.

2821
01:58:53,050 --> 01:58:55,360
I like to get things done.
But the things that I do,

2822
01:58:55,390 --> 01:58:57,190
the recreational,
they're all fun.

2823
01:58:57,370 --> 01:58:59,380
Like Disneyland was fun as fuck with my
kids.

2824
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:00,740
Um,
Eddie Bravo,

2825
01:59:00,741 --> 01:59:04,150
the invitation was fun as fuck.
The UFC was fun as fuck my show sold

2826
01:59:04,151 --> 01:59:05,500
out.
Show at the coffee it or where they do

2827
01:59:05,501 --> 01:59:09,550
the Cirque de Solei at mgm with Joey
Diaz and Jim Norton.

2828
01:59:09,551 --> 01:59:12,580
Friday night fon is fuck the fuck is fun
as fuck too.

2829
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,650
Those are jobs.
Right?

2830
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:15,730
But those are fun things.

2831
01:59:15,730 --> 01:59:16,780
Yeah.
And you know,

2832
01:59:16,781 --> 01:59:18,460
training,
training is fun.

2833
01:59:18,830 --> 01:59:21,220
Standup comedy couldn't be any fun.
Or you know,

2834
01:59:21,221 --> 01:59:25,330
the only real work work is like got to
discipline myself to sometimes work out

2835
01:59:25,331 --> 01:59:27,400
when I don't want to write when I don't
want to,

2836
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:29,230
but,
but I,

2837
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:32,500
this is,
this is how I feel is harder for me to

2838
01:59:32,501 --> 01:59:35,680
not do what I'm supposed to do then it
is for me to do what I'm supposed to do.

2839
01:59:35,990 --> 01:59:37,540
Because if I don't do what I'm supposed
to do,

2840
01:59:37,541 --> 01:59:40,430
then I deal with regret and doubt.
I don't,

2841
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:43,000
I've done it before.
I've done it a lot of when my life,

2842
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:44,860
I've felt those feelings,
I don't like it.

2843
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:48,730
So what I do is I just don't do that.
I just say,

2844
01:59:48,731 --> 01:59:50,470
well what is the difference?
If I don't do it,

2845
01:59:50,471 --> 01:59:52,810
then I'm gonna have to feel like I
didn't do it and feel like a loser.

2846
01:59:52,990 --> 01:59:56,590
So get after it bitch.
I think it's good for just for people to

2847
01:59:56,591 --> 01:59:58,480
hear it,
to know your schedule cause you're at

2848
01:59:58,481 --> 01:59:59,380
where you're at.
You know what I'm saying?

2849
01:59:59,381 --> 02:00:00,970
Because your work ethic.
So,

2850
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,980
so for me,
like if I look at someone,

2851
02:00:02,981 --> 02:00:03,431
it's like,
God,

2852
02:00:03,431 --> 02:00:05,360
how'd they get there?
Fuck man.

2853
02:00:05,361 --> 02:00:09,250
And the schedule is insane.
It's very rare that someone is

2854
02:00:09,251 --> 02:00:11,410
successful that doesn't have a crazy
schedule.

2855
02:00:11,710 --> 02:00:13,750
And if they are,
they're not going to appreciate it.

2856
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:15,570
They're gonna you know like,
but it's,

2857
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:18,910
it's all like what you,
what is where you're at.

2858
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:20,860
Like is where you're at,
where you want to be.

2859
02:00:20,861 --> 02:00:23,160
Like are you enjoying it?
Because I'm,

2860
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:26,770
what I'm happy about the most is that I
enjoy what I do.

2861
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:29,770
So when I'm doing,
like if I was working as a ceo of some

2862
02:00:29,771 --> 02:00:32,560
fucking corporation or something like
that and I was putting all these crazy

2863
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:33,580
hours,
like the same kind of hours,

2864
02:00:33,581 --> 02:00:37,510
I put it now the same kind of effort,
I'd probably be a miserable drunk pill

2865
02:00:37,511 --> 02:00:41,950
popping psychopath who's just looking to
escape and go bang hookers or something.

2866
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:43,480
I'd be looking for some sort of a
release.

2867
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:46,570
You know why you're doing it.
Like I think you got to get back to the

2868
02:00:46,571 --> 02:00:49,270
why sometimes lose motivation.
You've got it.

2869
02:00:49,271 --> 02:00:52,560
You've got to go back to the why.
What are you really trying to do?

2870
02:00:52,950 --> 02:00:53,390
You know,
it's,

2871
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:55,930
it's like with standup,
I was thinking about this this weekend a

2872
02:00:55,931 --> 02:00:58,480
lot and,
and you get to a point in stand up and

2873
02:00:58,481 --> 02:01:00,880
you know,
this is making a lot of people laugh for

2874
02:01:00,881 --> 02:01:04,660
an hour is not really,
a lot of people can do that.

2875
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:06,820
Are you,
are you growing?

2876
02:01:06,821 --> 02:01:09,370
Are you writing new stuff?
Are you being thematic?

2877
02:01:09,371 --> 02:01:12,130
Are you surprising yourself?
Are you coming up with a whole new

2878
02:01:12,131 --> 02:01:13,450
angle,
a new idea?

2879
02:01:13,690 --> 02:01:15,970
Or are you falling back on your old
tricks?

2880
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:19,750
Even if it's a variation on that theme
and that that challenge never goes away.

2881
02:01:19,890 --> 02:01:21,880
Yeah.
There's that feeling when you don't do a

2882
02:01:21,881 --> 02:01:24,460
new joke because you like,
you're scared of it.

2883
02:01:24,461 --> 02:01:26,440
It's not going so well.
So you go back to some old stuff,

2884
02:01:26,450 --> 02:01:28,760
you know works and it gets a lot of
pills,

2885
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:31,810
but you feel hollow,
feel dead inside and you feel hollow.

2886
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:34,540
Well you can't,
can't fake yourself.

2887
02:01:34,570 --> 02:01:35,930
You can't trick yourself.
No.

2888
02:01:36,070 --> 02:01:39,080
The guys who can or monsters look
terribly,

2889
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:40,033
don't

2890
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:42,860
I feel inauthentic.
And also when you just send them,

2891
02:01:42,861 --> 02:01:46,670
you have people coming back to see you
three times or whatever you owe it to

2892
02:01:46,671 --> 02:01:48,440
them.
I can't come up with the same bag of

2893
02:01:48,441 --> 02:01:50,540
tricks and it's really hard to write new
material.

2894
02:01:50,541 --> 02:01:53,300
It's really hard to have a new hour and
be thematic after a year.

2895
02:01:53,301 --> 02:01:54,530
It's really,
really difficult.

2896
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:59,780
But part of me dies when I go back
sometimes in my [inaudible] old faithful

2897
02:01:59,781 --> 02:02:03,500
just to get that laugh just,
and you also have to be entertaining

2898
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:05,810
you.
One of the things I said talk to Jim

2899
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:06,441
Jefferies about this.
I'm like,

2900
02:02:06,441 --> 02:02:08,360
when you do nudge him,
Jeffrey's Ya Jim Gaffigan.

2901
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:11,660
I like when you do a new specialty,
abandoned all your own material.

2902
02:02:11,661 --> 02:02:13,070
He goes,
yeah,

2903
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:15,290
a lot of it.
But he goes,

2904
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:18,200
it's important for me to do news top,
but it's also important for me to do

2905
02:02:18,201 --> 02:02:21,260
well.
It's like people pay a lot of money to

2906
02:02:21,261 --> 02:02:21,860
come see me.

2907
02:02:21,860 --> 02:02:25,100
I have to make sure the show is really
good and sometimes I get people shout

2908
02:02:25,101 --> 02:02:26,510
out,
they liked some of the old stuff.

2909
02:02:26,511 --> 02:02:27,730
They want to see the old,
the new,

2910
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:30,080
the old songs.
So you'll give it to him and stuff.

2911
02:02:30,081 --> 02:02:31,490
But with Jeffrey says,
or excuse me,

2912
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:32,510
cafe,
and I keep doing that.

2913
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,550
Gaffigan has that,
would that hotpockets thing,

2914
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:38,220
it's almost like can't,
can't do stand up without doing that hot

2915
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:39,570
pocket.
Yeah.

2916
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:42,980
And sometimes Louis C k they'll yell out
the bag of Dicks.

2917
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:45,350
That bag of dicks choke.
Yeah.

2918
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:46,401
Yeah.
Man,

2919
02:02:46,401 --> 02:02:48,860
you missed some of those old beats and
those old songs,

2920
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:53,390
but you,
I think if you're not constantly a

2921
02:02:53,391 --> 02:02:55,880
little bit uncomfortable,
this is gonna sound weird,

2922
02:02:55,881 --> 02:03:00,080
but I was thinking about this.
I go and spar with Chris mannered and he

2923
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:01,310
doesn't beat me up.
He doesn't hit me.

2924
02:03:01,490 --> 02:03:02,031
I mean,
it'll hit me,

2925
02:03:02,031 --> 02:03:03,200
but I say,
just don't break my job.

2926
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:05,570
Don't please don't hit me in the nose.
But I'm nervous.

2927
02:03:05,571 --> 02:03:07,220
I'm always nervous.
I don't want to go spark.

2928
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:10,580
I don't want to do it.
I'm nervous and we move around and we'll

2929
02:03:10,581 --> 02:03:11,780
go four rounds.
I'm exhausted.

2930
02:03:11,781 --> 02:03:13,490
I looked like shit.
I get hit.

2931
02:03:13,491 --> 02:03:13,851
I,
I'm,

2932
02:03:13,851 --> 02:03:14,720
I'm,
I don't feel good.

2933
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:18,110
But when I do that and I feel
uncomfortable and I sit in my car and

2934
02:03:18,111 --> 02:03:19,850
I'm all sweaty and um,
and you know,

2935
02:03:19,851 --> 02:03:20,990
I,
I did a bad job,

2936
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:24,140
but I overcame that fear on a Saturday
and I went and did it anyway.

2937
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:29,090
Something happens where I get more
creative where I just start writing.

2938
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:31,400
I don't know what it is,
but it opens up a different camera.

2939
02:03:31,401 --> 02:03:35,530
It's brain trauma.
Maybe it's also a lack of regret because

2940
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:38,270
you don't have the regret that you
didn't,

2941
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:40,970
you didn't shy away from something that
was challenging.

2942
02:03:41,310 --> 02:03:42,740
Instead,
you embraced it and then you get

2943
02:03:42,741 --> 02:03:43,970
excited.
The fact that he did it.

2944
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:44,823
Yeah,
I did it,

2945
02:03:44,950 --> 02:03:47,840
and being excited about things also is
like creative fuel.

2946
02:03:47,900 --> 02:03:51,860
I think it's so important to do that.
I'm not finding that physically.

2947
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:55,490
I get it mentally from all the shows and
our merchandise and doing all this in

2948
02:03:55,491 --> 02:03:58,890
the podcast,
but as far as physically plus class,

2949
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,790
but you're getting it a little bit out
of 'em.

2950
02:04:01,850 --> 02:04:03,620
I just realized that's a fighter and the
kid tee shirt,

2951
02:04:03,621 --> 02:04:06,440
that metallica shirt,
that's our west coast.

2952
02:04:07,210 --> 02:04:12,210
I can't wait for scrooge mcduck.
There will be a scrooge mcduck slider

2953
02:04:12,371 --> 02:04:14,600
when the kid's shirt.
I will be wearing it on this podcast.

2954
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:17,150
It will be limited edition because
warner brothers,

2955
02:04:17,151 --> 02:04:19,640
we'll find out about it and it will be a
problem.

2956
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:22,630
Let it sit on.
The darkness is going to have to sell

2957
02:04:22,650 --> 02:04:26,420
only with bitcoin so nobody could get
money out of it.

2958
02:04:26,421 --> 02:04:27,560
Hooks to,
Oh,

2959
02:04:27,561 --> 02:04:29,990
I didn't get the money for those.
I got to,

2960
02:04:30,170 --> 02:04:31,810
we're out of here.
I got around four 30.

2961
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:34,820
Come see me in that at the Atlanta
Improv this weekend.

2962
02:04:34,821 --> 02:04:36,020
Thursday,
Friday,

2963
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:36,980
Saturday.
It's a great room.

2964
02:04:36,990 --> 02:04:39,210
It's a great room.
I love Atlanta.

2965
02:04:39,690 --> 02:04:41,900
I'm doing the tabernacle there.
Um,

2966
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:43,860
I in January,
I think sold out.

2967
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:44,430
You,
sorry.

2968
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:47,660
You do theaters firing the kid lives
fighting a kid live.

2969
02:04:47,661 --> 02:04:48,494
Good.

2970
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:51,570
How are we doing what we do?
We've got Seattle.

2971
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:52,351
How are we doing?
Seattle,

2972
02:04:52,351 --> 02:04:53,820
Portland,
Seattle,

2973
02:04:53,821 --> 02:04:54,720
Portland,
Vegas,

2974
02:04:54,721 --> 02:04:56,550
San Diego.
Everyone else sold out.

2975
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:58,740
Fighter and the kid live.com.
Is that what it is?

2976
02:04:58,770 --> 02:04:59,160
Yeah.
Nope.

2977
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:02,250
It's just tea fat k.com.
[inaudible] Improv this weekend.

2978
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:06,780
[inaudible]K and I'm at the Bob Carr
Theater in Orlando on Friday night.

2979
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:07,980
All right.
See you later.

2980
02:05:07,981 --> 02:05:08,814
You're fucked.

2981
02:05:11,170 --> 02:05:11,710
See you later.
