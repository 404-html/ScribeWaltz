1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,810
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,490
two.
Wow.

3
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:07,680
And we're live.
Today is uh,

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,900
Wednesday,
November first,

5
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:12,000
which means sober.
October is over.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,840
I have saved my indulgence to be here 
with you on Benjamin.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,410
It's such an honor.
We're going to drink some,

8
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:20,400
uh,
William Wolff.

9
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:21,900
Bourbon.
It's perfect.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,960
Not sure where I got this.
I believe somebody gave it to me.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,220
I hope it's not poisoned.
Got Trust the wealth.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,070
I have a little list that will spark up 
a dube or it is the party started.

13
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:35,920
Cheers,
brother.

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,200
Grandson,
October man.

15
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:38,034
Thank you.
Thank you.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,280
I had not sober October.
I bet you did.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,940
I saw some tweets.

18
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,410
Benjamin likes to go off.
I appreciate that.

19
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:53,041
But you know what,
man,

20
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,440
that's a fucking.
That's a last thing.

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,543
The ability to go off crazy shit.
Everybody is so God damn scared of 

22
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:00,984
repercussions of being protested.
I mean everybody's being hashtag called 

23
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:08,150
out.
I now and it's just like,

24
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,470
it immobilizes people.
It's like,

25
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,770
that's why like a season to this season 
of stranger things.

26
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:15,890
You're watching that.
I like it.

27
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:16,724
I like hopper,
like the cop because he'll get pissed 

28
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,080
and be like,
sorry.

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,060
It's because I just care so damn much.
You could do that shit in the eighties.

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,003
Oh,
sweet taste of marijuana and marijuana 

31
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:30,490
and 31 days.
All right.

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,260
Well that's nice.
How's it feel?

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,380
It feels good to be back.
It feels good.

34
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,780
I missed it.
I tell you what though.

35
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:42,840
I enjoyed being sober.
Not that I needed to be sober,

36
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,950
not like a junkie with the problem,
but it's nice to take a reset.

37
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:47,784
I'm going to do it every year.
I'm going to do sober October every 

38
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,120
year.
They you heard is good.

39
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,970
So gear yourselves up,
ladies and gentlemen.

40
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,340
Eleven months from now.
Join on in.

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,200
Maybe.
Maybe all in won't.

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,080
What do you think?
Oh No,

43
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:02,820
I'm in man.
Let's do it.

44
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,810
I'll do sober October because this year 
I uh,

45
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:08,240
I just hit my foot with an ax.
He such a.

46
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,410
you're so are living in the boonies men.
I don't know anybody in La that good.

47
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:14,964
Tell me that.
Where I wouldn't call the police and 

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,360
say,
uh,

49
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,710
I don't know why the fuck he swinging an
ax but feet checked.

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,683
Well yeah,
because my brother does tree work so I 

51
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:24,590
usually wear the good the boots,
you know,

52
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,763
but,
but I,

53
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,551
we,
we fire,

54
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:30,720
we have fires every uh,
every night and I really liked tinkering

55
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:31,554
to make the fire good.
And then I cracked some beers and then 

56
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:34,494
my family hangs out and then they go 
inside and a crack more beers and I de 

57
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,200
chops more wood and uh,
I didn't put on the good boots and uh,

58
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,120
my ax just careened off off and hit me 
in the foot.

59
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,560
So.
And I didn't,

60
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,360
uh,
I didn't have time to,

61
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,213
to get stitches,
so I just put a maxi pad on it and it 

62
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:53,040
worked.
How big was the cut?

63
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,890
Is Pretty legit.
They say you should use,

64
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,300
um,
whenever possible.

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,100
If you can't get anywhere you can use 
crazy.

66
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,100
I've

67
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,320
never tried that,
but I know a lot of people who have.

68
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,540
And I know fighters who've gotten cut in
camp and just use crazy glue krazy glued

69
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,850
up to the cut and then made it to the 
fight.

70
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,883
That's awesome.
Didn't let anybody know that they had a 

71
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:16,290
preexisting injury.
Those guys are hard as nails.

72
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,270
There's a lot of them that they'll go 
into the octagon with some crazy shit.

73
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,460
What is this fleet?
What happened to him?

74
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,610
Flee plays doctor with superglue.
Oh,

75
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,380
most people cut themselves.
Bally had the emergency room,

76
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,720
but when red hot chili peppers basis 
flea,

77
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,230
cut his thumb open,
aggressively strumming his guitar during

78
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,670
a show.
He didn't have time for surgery,

79
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,750
so keeping it crafty,
picked up bottle,

80
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:36,584
superglue,
seal that cut like any good shirtless 

81
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,520
rockstar would.
Yeah,

82
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,730
I would do that in a heartbeat.
Like like cuts or wounds.

83
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,740
I'm all about just like doing shit like 
that.

84
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:46,660
It's like broken bones.
Yeah.

85
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,410
That's when I.
I know I've got to set it or so.

86
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,320
Yeah,
that seems like a flea move.

87
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,213
He seems like a psycho.
It was just pulled it out of his sock 

88
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,883
guy.

89
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,203
I remember they did an article once he 
was talking about is how important is 

90
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:03,340
pre-performance shits are,
and I was like,

91
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,300
yeah,
they are important,

92
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:07,300
but why is everybody?
Why are we ashamed of a bowel movements?

93
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,460
Why we shamed a potty?
I don't know.

94
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,890
Maybe we should be honored to get rid of
toxins.

95
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,933
Jamie and I were talking about it openly
because you got some new bathrooms for 

96
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:18,880
the studio that have those Japanese 
toilets at shoot hot water up your butt.

97
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,980
Oh yeah.
And they're warm.

98
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,620
So you sit in the toilet.
It's heated like right away.

99
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,880
It's like a warm,
comforting,

100
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,960
like come in,
come in and shit.

101
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,820
Come in and just release.
Relax those bowels and let it go.

102
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,410
Let it go.
That's awesome man.

103
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:33,244
I'm,
I'm real meat and potatoes with my 

104
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,760
shifts.
I just,

105
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,810
I get in and get out,
but you know if there's another level to

106
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:38,920
it,
like what you're describing.

107
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,753
I want an.
Sometimes I'm disturbed though after it 

108
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:42,844
shoots hot water up my ass for five 
minutes and then I use toilet paper and 

109
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:46,930
wipe it down and it's still.
I see poop.

110
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,630
I'm like,
well what the hell?

111
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,783
I haven't had any of those yet.
It's been all clean every time I'd be 

112
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,120
louder than mine.
Is there like a lot of water?

113
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:58,870
Is it like you can move it around,
you can like five different conditions.

114
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:01,540
It can spread wider general,
or is it like,

115
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,310
oh,
it's just right.

116
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,150
It's just perfect.
It shoots all over the place.

117
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:08,830
You could get it to go all over the 
place.

118
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,130
I forget.
Desires have more than one.

119
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,800
A can an aim to more than one spot.
Like with a button.

120
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:15,361
Yeah,
yeah,

121
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:18,100
you can move it,
but it's the fact yet.

122
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,750
Right.
But then there's also a friendship which

123
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:20,620
is obvious,
so women,

124
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,230
but for know where that fits.

125
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,610
Hammer your boss or you can do a ball 
shot.

126
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,150
I saw some dude on TV.
It got hit no on the Internet.

127
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:31,630
Rather a video clip of someone who he 
the guy in front of,

128
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,464
he was a catcher and the guy in front of
him just barely clipped the ball and it 

129
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:39,510
Corinne to perfectly and it was nuts.
Can you see this fast ball?

130
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,840
As hard as Paul just targeted his nut 
sack bang.

131
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,020
And even though it's a like an animated 
gift,

132
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:48,820
it's only a couple seconds long and as 
soon as that ball hits the ground,

133
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:51,850
you see his body just given like,
oh,

134
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,980
it was like precision.
Like I played lacrosse and that once.

135
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,520
Oh this is that it.
No.

136
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,800
Well I should have said I should have 
retweeted.

137
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,680
That was being selfish with it.
You're being selfish with the ball hit.

138
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,630
No.
Sometimes I don't read tweak things even

139
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,790
though they're good and then I go,
why didn't I retweet that?

140
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,380
And then I killed,
try,

141
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:14,300
go back and find them and they just lost
the sea of replies at replies where they

142
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,530
just get,
I can't.

143
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,940
Here it is.
I think this is it.

144
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,870
Yeah,
that's it.

145
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,550
Watch this and that might have them go 
down.

146
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,413
Oh see Bam.
I mean it doesn't get any more perfect 

147
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,210
because it hits side Dick.
See if you get hit with.

148
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,483
Today's cups are so much better than the
cups we had when we were kids because 

149
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,510
the cups we had.
If you played.

150
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,070
Did you play any contact sports?
Lacrosse.

151
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,520
So when they have to put those cups in 
the jock strap,

152
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,160
those fuckers kind of floated around a 
little bit.

153
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,083
Oh,
they were a terrible where one half the 

154
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:49,010
time I can Lacrosse I stopped wearing a 
cup because it was because I would just.

155
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,970
They would just start hurting my balls,
like that little line part of that,

156
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:53,804
like the edge would sometimes just get 
above the ball and then one time I got 

157
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:57,674
hit by like a 90 mile,
an hour shot and the ball goes 90 miles 

158
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,360
an hour.
Yeah.

159
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,820
And it's just hard rubber.
Ninety miles.

160
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,800
I did.
I use those things for massage.

161
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,940
Uh,
they're crazy.

162
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:08,774
Yeah.
He would take one of those Lacrosse 

163
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,270
Paul's,
you lie on your back folks,

164
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,670
if anybody,
if you have like,

165
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,543
back soreness and like,
especially if you don't want to pay 

166
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,310
someone to massage you,
if you can take the pain,

167
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,263
you can do it yourself.
Take a Lacrosse ball or we have those 

168
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:24,930
other balls.
Uh,

169
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,520
they,
what do they mean?

170
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,880
Who makes them row?
Yes.

171
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,960
Rogue makes some rogue.
Athletics makes them,

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,120
they're fucking awesome.
They're called um,

173
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,060
a wad.
Supernovas Jamie.

174
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,903
Go grab one of those.
We've got it like right outside the 

175
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,130
door.
Do you know what that thing is?

176
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,990
How do these guys can throw like 1:20
right there out of their mind?

177
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,461
Oh,
it's,

178
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:47,660
it's psychotic because it got the 
leverage of it.

179
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,523
And it's also a sport where you get 
super good at and then what you don't 

180
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:53,480
even have a fucking career until if that
guy.

181
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,100
I mean there's guys that are probably 
like just fucking aces at that shit,

182
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,060
but they can't go into the nfl,
nhl or the.

183
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,620
I mean there's nothing.
There was nothing now there Jamie.

184
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,530
Anyway,
so they make them.

185
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:08,620
I think Kelly started invented it,
but they,

186
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,940
I'm sorry if you,
if that's not correct,

187
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,780
but they uh,
I know Kelly star,

188
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:13,614
it was the one of the first guys to 
suggest using a Lacrosse ball and you 

189
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:19,190
take this lacrosse ball,
that's the Wad Supernova,

190
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,080
but you can use a cross ball.

191
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,663
I use one all the time.
I take it with me on the road because 

192
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:24,434
it's super little.
But you take one of those hard little 

193
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:30,620
fuckers and just lay it on the ground 
and then bridge over it like a wrestling

194
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:31,454
bridge.
Just put all your weight into that 

195
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:33,574
recall ball and just roll it up and down
like any kind of not you have in your 

196
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,260
bag as painful as fuck.
I need some backstabbing.

197
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,133
Like that's the six,
seven back is not fun after a certain 

198
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:46,820
age just starts.
Baxter,

199
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:49,100
temporary.
They're like tires.

200
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,263
You could wear those fuckers out.
You have to be careful and you have to 

201
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:56,190
do maintenance work like backs or like 
one of the most

202
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,590
common things that people enjoy and it 
changed their life.

203
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,663
Like if you hurt your hand it sucks,
but it probably isn't going to change 

204
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,264
your life like a back thing.
Will he break your hand if you've ever 

205
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,220
broken a hand?
It's weird.

206
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,513
I broke my arm once.
I remember I was a little kid and I had 

207
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,470
an a cast and I was like,
God,

208
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,323
I didn't learn how to write with my left
hand and it really sunk in my head for 

209
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,810
strokes.
If you,

210
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,693
if you're ambidextrous,
it lowers your chances of having a 

211
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:19,110
stroke.
Really?

212
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,670
Yes.
My uh,

213
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,533
my uh,
uncles and anesthetists or 

214
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,290
anesthesiologists and he was like,
dude,

215
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,300
just write your name with your left hand
a lot.

216
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,453
And he said that there's something about
that that keeps the neuroplasticity 

217
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,494
better.
Is it only writing your name is only 

218
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,230
writing or other things as well?

219
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,690
I think it's just having the skill hand 
switch.

220
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,973
Yeah.
That's funny you say that because they 

221
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:39,924
say that that's one of the best ways to 
get good at a skill is to practice it 

222
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:44,160
with your opposite side.
Interesting.

223
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,340
Yeah.
Like um,

224
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,040
they say that with striking that when 
you learn how to strike,

225
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,580
say like if you stand orthodox means 
your left hand is Ford.

226
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,473
When I say striking him in martial arts,
when you stand with your left hand 

227
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:57,894
forward,
usually guys do that because there are 

228
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:02,550
powerful and the right hand.
But if they switched it,

229
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,600
like if you're a right handed person and
you put the power,

230
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,570
the backhand in the left side,
it comes out super awkward to me.

231
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:13,830
To this day I've been doing martial arts
most of my life and my left hand is just

232
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:14,970
straight dog shit.

233
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,430
Throw a left out of the bag.
It looks so awkward and Clunky,

234
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,220
but my right hand is pretty stout.
I thought.

235
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,001
Yeah,
for piano,

236
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:28,200
it's like that with the melody and the 
guy tried to play songs with melodies on

237
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,034
the lefthand and it's so hard that I 
have to almost relearn piano I would 

238
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:33,900
imagine.
Yeah.

239
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,660
I mean because like you're thinking in a
language,

240
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,603
right?
You just don't think it's all I played 

241
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,750
since I was so young and it's so fast 
that you can't possibly think.

242
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,600
And so then like sometimes I'll forget 
the way,

243
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:49,140
like a box songs going and it's almost 
like that south park with Cartman,

244
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:50,370
like you have to start from the 
beginning.

245
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,530
Yeah.
Because I don't know how to just jump in

246
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,700
because I don't,
it's just,

247
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,590
it's just instinct.
I don't even know what I'm doing.

248
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,000
Well,
you're the only.

249
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,390
The only argument for keeping the piano 
on stage at the Improv.

250
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,483
And Craig Robinson for Craig Robinson,
sometimes it brings keyboards with them 

251
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:05,910
places.
That's a good point.

252
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,980
You're not really,
uh,

253
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,340
bring a keyboard on the road.
Guy.

254
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:09,050
Aria.
I,

255
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,680
if they don't have a piano,
no,

256
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,810
usually they provide it,
but every now and then they just won't.

257
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,360
They're like,
they just forget one when you're in town

258
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,194
or how do you,
how do you work at like the Improv and 

259
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:20,250
funny bones usually do that,
but if I'm doing like an obscure club,

260
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,031
they'll be like,
well,

261
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,140
it's a contract,
you know,

262
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,530
and uh,
and I don't mind because I just,

263
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,300
I usually go to like best buy or 
something and then I'll either return it

264
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:28,134
or give it to a kid or something.
It's funny when someone just doesn't 

265
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,310
honor a contract.
I had a guy once a week for it.

266
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,243
Yeah.
I had a club once and like specifically 

267
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,270
we laid out that everyone has to have a 
seat.

268
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,780
You can have standing room like in the 
back of this place.

269
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,673
And he was like,
well then you're going to make less 

270
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:45,421
money.
I'm like,

271
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,540
that's okay because this way at least I 
know the show will be good.

272
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,700
Like I've,
I went to see doug's.

273
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,350
Dan helped me in a couple of friends and
uh,

274
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:54,160
it was at a place where I had to stand 
long

275
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,140
time ago and I remember going,
Oh,

276
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:57,910
this blows right?
Like,

277
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,340
this isn't even half as good as sitting 
down.

278
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,590
It's terrible.
So from then on,

279
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,940
like I used to go to,
um,

280
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,160
house of Blues,
those are infamous for it.

281
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,003
They'd have a big seating area in the 
front and then to the side they have 

282
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:14,470
this open bar area and you would just go
on stage talking at a bar.

283
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,320
I mean it was like people were just 
talking.

284
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,090
It's like they're moving,
they're standing,

285
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,400
look,
and you can do that by the way.

286
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,600
You can get into that road gig mentality
and go up there,

287
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:28,240
but it's a different thing.
The road gig mentality.

288
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,860
You've got to be prepared for the road 
gig.

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,833
Yeah.
You have to be prepared for not getting 

290
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:32,890
crowd consent.
Yes.

291
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,020
You know,
and I,

292
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:34,854
and I,
I like a lot of crowd can set where I'm 

293
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:36,821
like,
listen,

294
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:38,860
you gotta kiss back or we can't do 
Doggie.

295
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,503
You also have to be willing to.
You have to understand that there's 

296
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,370
going to be like randoms.
John,

297
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:46,960
you want a beer?
You want a shot?

298
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,883
Totally hear that.
You're going to hear that in the middle 

299
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:53,620
of punchlines setups.
If there's anything that requires quiet,

300
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,680
like there's any like weird bit,
we have like a long pause,

301
00:12:56,681 --> 00:13:01,060
like throw that bit out nuance that 
ain't going to work,

302
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,620
but you could do it.
But anyway,

303
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:03,454
this guy,
um,

304
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,713
he just said,
well,

305
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,553
I could sell more tickets this way.
I got there and we make this work 

306
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,650
workout,
right?

307
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:11,110
Signed the contracts the whole deal.
I get there.

308
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:12,190
People are standing.
I mean,

309
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,500
like a hundreds of people.
And I go,

310
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,360
what the fuck dude?
And he goes,

311
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:16,901
well,
you know,

312
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:17,900
when Blah,
blah,

313
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:18,970
blah,
please here.

314
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,020
You know,
she always loves people.

315
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:20,890
Stand in the back.
I go,

316
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:21,640
what does that mean?

317
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,680
We have a contract.
I go,

318
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,640
you know,
we had a contract,

319
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,440
right?
And he just looks at me and I go,

320
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,930
come on man.
What the cause is excused.

321
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,030
He's like,
he just looked at me.

322
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,343
He's like,
we're here.

323
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,730
We're doing this show.
This is what we did.

324
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,020
I sold extra tickets.
I fucked you.

325
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,930
You mother fucker.
You was like,

326
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm not motivated by the same shit as 
human.

327
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,620
I want the audience to have a good 
experience.

328
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,810
You just want more cash.
There was still made plenty of money.

329
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,933
We're still,
we're talking about the difference 

330
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:49,840
between like,
I think it was like 300 to 500 seats,

331
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,110
so 300 seeds,
seeding or you could do 500 years,

332
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:53,944
200 standing.
But they filled the whole back of this 

333
00:13:55,571 --> 00:14:00,160
era because he had a big bar area,
like a big long area and that whole back

334
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:00,560
area too.

335
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,380
To me it's mostly a place they have 
bands right now.

336
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,660
So I've eaten shit with a standing only 
because I wasn't,

337
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:10,670
I didn't make the adjustment pre show,
you know,

338
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,410
so in my mind I'm like I'm doing standup
comedy and I go out there and I'm like I

339
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:15,910
should be a pink floyd cover band 
tonight.

340
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,453
Who wants to hear the wall?
You've got to have a different kind of 

341
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,613
energy.
You have like almost like a carnival 

342
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,130
barker energy.
You know what I mean?

343
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,800
Like you got to get those people 
interested in paying attention.

344
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,753
Yeah.
Like when I was at a renaissance fair 

345
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:31,660
heckler in high school,
that was my job,

346
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:35,380
like in the stock and people would pay 
money to throw tomatoes at me.

347
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:36,214
So it was all just figuring out what 
someone's vulnerability was and just 

348
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:41,340
exploiting it and just,
it was carnival barking too.

349
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,950
I was working with only the guy's name 
was boob and he was a,

350
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,370
a boob full name who you go,
I think.

351
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,213
And he was a,
uh,

352
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,890
just gypsies,
Gypsies,

353
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,733
and I was just trying to beat the joust 
and I get big crowds because it was all 

354
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,700
about letting them win occasionally 
because you couldn't just be like,

355
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,990
oh,
that tomato didn't hurt.

356
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,930
You have to be humiliated.
Right,

357
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,600
right,
right.

358
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,790
Even play it up.
Right.

359
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,830
Did I get hammered and let him slap me 
in the face for like 20 bucks,

360
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,070
17 I drink,
meet and just be out.

361
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,790
Did you get hurt that way?
I know dude knows how to slap good.

362
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,110
Well,
there was this one levels,

363
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,420
that slap game,
but there was a.

364
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:17,690
yeah,
like there'd be like a biker.

365
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:18,201
It'd be like,
no,

366
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,550
I'm gonna throw a rock.
And I'm like,

367
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,140
Shit.
And I'd run to the cornfield.

368
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,233
Oh,
let's talk to some people did knock you 

369
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:27,190
the fuck out with a slop.
We use lab.

370
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,990
It'd be like just some Dick.
And you never know who that dickhead.

371
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:31,160
That's true.
That's true.

372
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,470
That's super.
Like the Diaz brothers.

373
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:34,041
Like you're like,
oh,

374
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,150
you're a normal guy.
Oh,

375
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,150
you're the toughest dude in the world.
Yeah.

376
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,580
You do not want them slapping you.
Right.

377
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,540
Especially if they know they're going to
slap you.

378
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,513
It sounded like an instinct.
Like in the middle you said something 

379
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:44,744
stupid to them.
They're like,

380
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,370
what?
They line up.

381
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:49,070
But if they like line up and get ready,
what is this guy doing?

382
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:51,640
He's letting the guy slap him,
but they haven't got a slap off.

383
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,390
Come on.
These go are pretty big on the Internet.

384
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:56,330
Oh my God.
Everyone gets knocked out.

385
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,193
People get knocked the fuck out.
That guy just got kod because this guy 

386
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:03,740
hit him right on the job.
Oh wait a minute.

387
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,970
So who went the gift that that was?
This was first I come in and.

388
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,170
And so the second,
the second guy killed them.

389
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,350
That's even more impressive.
He took a shot.

390
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,303
Watch this.

391
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,083
Oh my God.

392
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,203
That dude's out fucking cold.
I hope there was a mat behind him or 

393
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,760
someone to catch him.
Probably not

394
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,833
less drama,
just because it's the little button and 

395
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,130
you know,
it still shakes the brain.

396
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,800
Yeah,
that's terrible.

397
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,670
Like that guy's brain got jolted there.
His next spun around.

398
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,490
His brain sloshed back and forth and 
said,

399
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,363
I'm so screwed.
I'm going to get all that shit when I'm 

400
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:38,214
older from the tomatoes.
You probably will a little for real 

401
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,080
tomatoes.
Do you think hit you $10,000

402
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:45,510
a day pool?
Oh No.

403
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:47,430
They miss a lot that somebody was 
thrown.

404
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:50,400
I was hit hard maybe,
but I never got knocked out.

405
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,293
I want to talk to you about this.
Do you think that that might have 

406
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:56,490
something to do with why you're 
impulsive?

407
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,240
You're very impulsive.
I think.

408
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,290
Wait a good way.
I think you're serious,

409
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,490
but you,
you,

410
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,150
you,
what?

411
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,080
You say some shit online on twitter.
You're fucking super impulsive.

412
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,760
Like I laugh at him.
I'm like,

413
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,540
this dude just goes for it.
I don't know about.

414
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,121
I,
I think,

415
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:14,060
uh,
it's just like the art of,

416
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:18,180
I don't know,
there is an art to saying fucked up shit

417
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:20,190
and that's one of the things I really 
appreciate you about you.

418
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,213
So you're a very smart guy,
but you also appreciate the art of 

419
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:26,900
saying fucked up shit.
It's one of the things that we do and it

420
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,773
doesn't,
it doesn't get respected enough because 

421
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,530
especially today,
man,

422
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,150
you are fucking dancing a fine line 
between razor blades and crocodiles.

423
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,270
You offend today.
People are just super,

424
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,690
Super Cali Audi because I just got a 
bull horn sometimes.

425
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,840
I just felt like,
I dunno,

426
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,010
I just wanted,
I just wanted to keep

427
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,200
comedy going mad for myself.
I didn't want to.

428
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
I just think our job is to not have a 
line,

429
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,970
you know,
I try to be kind,

430
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,120
I don't want to like.
But at the same time it's like I have to

431
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:05,040
figure like our job is hyperbole.
Like we work in a truth dungeon and it's

432
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:05,850
like my,
my,

433
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,060
my thing is I might be wrong,
but I'm not lying and I'm wrong a lot.

434
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,940
But in the moment,
yeah,

435
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,720
I think what's super important is that 
you.

436
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,350
You've made a real good distinction that
you try not to be cruel and.

437
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,910
Exactly.
That's I do too.

438
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:19,500
And sometimes you miss.
Right?

439
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:22,700
That's another thing about this working 
without a net shit boy.

440
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,630
Sometimes you miss for sure,
for sure.

441
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,930
Something you shouldn't have said,
especially in live shows you try,

442
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,870
you just the impulse comes into your 
mind and you go for it.

443
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,860
But under careful consideration,
if you sat down and thought about it for

444
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:35,461
a few minutes,
you're like,

445
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:36,294
oh no,
I can't do this bit this and that would 

446
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:38,904
have people misconstrue.
What if someone took it out of context 

447
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:41,664
would.
If someone doesn't understand that this 

448
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,164
is what I'm doing,
I'm just pushing buttons to people who 

449
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,650
know him pushing buttons.
I'm not trying to be cruel.

450
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,590
They're in the game versus just random 
casualties.

451
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:52,530
And also I think that the outrage Ponzi 
scheme people,

452
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,930
I don't even.
I don't even care.

453
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,800
Like I think a lot of people feign 
outrage because they don't understand,

454
00:18:58,801 --> 00:18:59,634
but they still want to retain power.
But then there's people that actually 

455
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,280
like,
I'll hurt them and that's when I'm like,

456
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,143
oh no,
did I?

457
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,170
Because my problem is every now and then
I'll reverse virtue signaling where it's

458
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:14,640
almost like I'll go farther intense that
I normally would have because I'm trying

459
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:17,670
to counteract virtue signaling and then 
I'm like,

460
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:18,504
well I'm throwing a punch at someone 
that other people don't even might not 

461
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:22,450
see.

462
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,430
And then now I just am a crazy guy.
Like super aggressive.

463
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,540
Yeah,
I've been talking about that a lot about

464
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,200
trump that I think that all these people
attacking trump in many ways,

465
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:34,380
they actually kind of ramp up as 
behavior for the.

466
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,041
Yeah,
it's the,

467
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:39,390
it's the if you read up black redneck 
white liberal by Thomas Soul.

468
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,780
No,
it's unbelievable.

469
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,670
We bring this up,
the law.

470
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,160
Why do I feel maybe I think someone else
did well.

471
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:47,530
Cowen recommended it to me.
It might have been so,

472
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,810
uh,
is like one of the most read.

473
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,430
Well read guys.
It's unreal.

474
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,590
He's just always reading books.
Yeah.

475
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,290
And he's getting into wine,
which is one of the hardest hobbies.

476
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,520
I can't do that.
I can't even,

477
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,130
there's not enough time just to,
so like pbr shit,

478
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,820
my foot fucking axe.
But uh,

479
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,580
I can't.
A PBR has a wonderful flavor of it.

480
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,470
So I love keeping.
If pbr was like really respected as some

481
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:15,471
like light ale from like Germany,
like if you've got a good batch of Pbi,

482
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,410
like wow,
it's kind of weird,

483
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:18,720
sort of aluminum me taste.
It sounds like.

484
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:22,170
It's just like they do like the 
condescending for Annunciation.

485
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:23,310
Like they know Mr.
Listen,

486
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,623
pabst blue ribbon with some fucking 
stone crabs and some butter and maybe 

487
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:31,320
some fries with a lot of salt on them.
Come on son.

488
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:32,670
There's nothing better.
I mean look,

489
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:36,750
it's not the same kind of beer.
It's people are flavor snobs.

490
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,530
Like they want you to be in the IPA.
The IPA is,

491
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,770
can you handle the bitter?
What about caviar?

492
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,620
And she like to like stuff that tastes 
like shit.

493
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,350
And they used to feed lobsters to 
prisoners,

494
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:47,920
like not that long.
Well

495
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,791
Dude,
lobsters,

496
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,530
God damn delicious,
delicious.

497
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:52,180
But it's like,
who gets to make the call?

498
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,500
Well,
you know what the difference is?

499
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,453
Lobsters with and without butter.
That's the difference was dealt with 

500
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,330
butter and lobster.
This like butter,

501
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,643
make some shit just way better.
And one of the things that makes way 

502
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,950
better as lobster for sure there is no 
god damn question.

503
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,240
And lobsters are,
you know,

504
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,080
it's essentially a bug.
It's a big old bug.

505
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,410
It's a giant Pete on this shit.
Eating beetle.

506
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,633
They're not much different than bugs 
that walk around on the surface of the 

507
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:23,800
earth.
They're just water bugs.

508
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,663
And I think we also liked the task of 
like cracking and splitting it like 

509
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,410
artichokes.
Tape deliciousness right there.

510
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,210
Crabs.
What kind of grabs those?

511
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,940
Jamie?
Look,

512
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,850
God damn good stipend.
Pbr and crabs and that's it.

513
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,040
A pabst blue ribbon can because nothing 
gets crabs that spice on the outside and

514
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,990
lemon and Ipa can take you for a turn.

515
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:47,883
Like my wife.
This like here have some odd because I 

516
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:52,050
usually come in like if I,
if I get a little buys,

517
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,751
I'll come in,
you know,

518
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:55,200
and she wanted to hang and I'm out there
just drinking the,

519
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:58,870
staring into a fire.
And she gave me this ipa called dog fish

520
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,213
and it's 18 percent alcohol and like 
three beers and I'm like blacked out 

521
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,710
because I was just drinking.
I'm like,

522
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,240
Beers.
And I'm like,

523
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:08,590
Oh,
three beers now come in.

524
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,650
That's so unnecessary.
And it was like to do that to people.

525
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,840
I don't know.
It was like,

526
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,680
it's like spike and someone.
I was like,

527
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,611
roofing,
please.

528
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:16,970
Here's the thing.
Like,

529
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,150
it's you can't.
This is one of my.

530
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,030
I had a bit about this,
about my problem and pot gummy bears.

531
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,023
He said,
one of the problems is it looks like a 

532
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:26,800
regular fucking gummy bear in my brain.

533
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,431
Thinks,
oh,

534
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,510
I could just fucking beat the shit out 
of those gummy bears.

535
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,353
I getting five or 10 of them.
False representation could just Jack 

536
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:35,734
your world.
There's a video I put on instagram of 

537
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,400
Least Siad.
Have you seen that video?

538
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,590
One by one design,
put it up and he's got a,

539
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:46,420
a video that they took from Joey d as 
the Church of what's happening now.

540
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:47,254
And Lisa is literally the physical 
example that you would use if someone 

541
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:54,520
who's too high.
What's too hot?

542
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:56,260
You like this?
This is too high.

543
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:57,790
Like look at him there.
He's got his eyes closed.

544
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,870
Give me some volume,
Jamie.

545
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,043
We're all talking.
They're playing some music and look at 

546
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:03,524
him.
Look at him.

547
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,230
Look at his eyes.
Fade new now.

548
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,193
By the way,
he knew what he was supposed to be at 

549
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,560
the podcast,
not woke them up to do a podcast.

550
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:13,820
He left the camera on himself to himself
and he's just.

551
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,690
He's so paranoid right now.
He's freaking the fuck out.

552
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,480
He throws his head back.
He said,

553
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Jesus,
I can't do this anymore.

554
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:25,550
I can't work.
I can't work with you.

555
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:27,190
Joey Diaz.
He's just thinking right now.

556
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,200
Demons just waiting for him to close his
eyes and go to sleep.

557
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,400
I can't.
I can't keep into the demons over him.

558
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:35,234
Just scratching at the ceiling,
just waiting for the lights to turn out 

559
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:42,350
and his eyes closed and they're going to
go through his fucking mouth.

560
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,980
Penetrate his body.
And I've been that exact guy on

561
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,020
that exact podcast.
Yeah,

562
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,680
Joe,
I couldn't handle it,

563
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,000
man.
He's a different animal.

564
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,740
I love that dude.
He's the best,

565
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,210
but he's a different animal.
You can,

566
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,230
you know,
don't,

567
00:23:57,231 --> 00:24:00,380
don't try to outdo him ever.
I was just trying to hang.

568
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,543
He was the one who had mercy on me,
which I thought was incredible because 

569
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:05,330
I'm like,
Yo,

570
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:06,930
let me just grab another little stores 
done,

571
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,420
and he's like,
no way doc.

572
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,703
You're going to fucking be nice to you.
Put like what you said about the gummy 

573
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:12,981
bears.
It's like,

574
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:13,814
yeah,
it's almost like the false 

575
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:17,100
representation is the thing I don't like
more than the representation.

576
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:17,934
That's enough and that's why I get so 
pissed about certain scandals because 

577
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:23,650
someone's a hypocrite versus other ones 
where I'm like,

578
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,250
ah man,
I feel bad for that guy.

579
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,420
Right.
I know what you're saying.

580
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,343
Yeah,
yeah.

581
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,200
Yeah.

582
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,060
In did you see the hear the podcast I 
had the other day with Jamie Kilstein?

583
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,100
Yes.
He's a good dude,

584
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:33,934
man.
The way he came clean about all that 

585
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:36,424
stuff and just talked about how it all 
got away from him as like a social 

586
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:40,234
justice warrior and describing in like 
really honest and I think super brave 

587
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,443
the way he described like this charge 
that he would get after going after 

588
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:50,374
someone and calling someone a racist and
getting other people to go after and 

589
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,290
trying to get them fired

590
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,203
to gave me a good perspective on myself.
It's like when did the concept of the 

591
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:57,594
attack dog where it's this like an 
understood thing where you're going to 

592
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:01,914
attack for the group and then it's like 
then you start seeking approval from 

593
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:07,890
strangers and how much of it is actually
your own opinion at that point.

594
00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:10,760
And that's a very,
very profound thing to think about.

595
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,713
We,
we have a series in our brain is filled 

596
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:18,370
with the series of reward systems that 
are in place,

597
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,443
right?
Like there's,

598
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,270
there's a need for approval from the 
tribe.

599
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,690
There's the need for,
you know,

600
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,170
sexually reproduce.
There's the need to accomplish tasks,

601
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:31,600
has a need to avoid probation,
and we have all these reward systems,

602
00:25:31,601 --> 00:25:34,150
right?
Where like your body and your,

603
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,133
your,
your organism will reward you with a 

604
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:38,554
positive feeling for reinforcing some of
the patterns of behavior that are 

605
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:44,080
necessary for survival.
Right?

606
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:46,780
Like the ability to run away from 
something when you're scared,

607
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:50,530
when you get scared and you freak out 
that as a jolt of Goji juice,

608
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,870
right?
You'll buy that Geico insurance.

609
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,793
Fuck you ready to run man.
Have you ever been like legitimately 

610
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,520
scared for your life and have that 
feeling?

611
00:25:57,521 --> 00:25:58,810
Fuck yeah man,
it's terrible.

612
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,300
Fine.
Right?

613
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,580
And that's more powerful than,
than desire.

614
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:02,414
And I think that's one thing we're 
facing right now as a society because 

615
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:09,071
it's just planes of Africa running from 
a lion versus towards a banana.

616
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:11,150
Like what's,
what's crazier?

617
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:11,984
So I think that that's a way to 
supercharge a population into buying a 

618
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:15,554
bunch of dumb shit.

619
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,503
Well,
I still think this is a very important 

620
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:18,244
point that I think a lot of us it takes 
a long time to realize is that these 

621
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,460
reward systems that we have set up,
right?

622
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,710
Like these patterns that feel good to 
follow through with like you know,

623
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,450
the way we handle conflict and 
especially at the d,

624
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:34,284
the need to push yourself and stress 
yourself out like some sort of physical 

625
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,823
exercise.
I've really feel like that those things 

626
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,913
like if you can help them,
like if you could give them their fuel 

627
00:26:47,861 --> 00:26:48,694
and a positive way,
you don't get any of the negative 

628
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:52,584
aspects of it,
but you get the positive aspects of it 

629
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,690
because like especially like the 
physical one,

630
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,713
I,
I really believe this from my own 

631
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:01,014
experiences.
We all have physical requirements for 

632
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,954
movement and we don't.
We don't give those physical 

633
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:07,674
requirements.
We don't feed the body correctly with 

634
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:09,954
those movements.

635
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,990
And what happens is it gets angst and it
gets weird.

636
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,970
Everybody gets freaked out and it starts
getting fat.

637
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,823
It starts feeling like shit.
And one of the reasons why it's not 

638
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:20,454
functioning right,
it's because we didn't properly manage 

639
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,113
movement,
like making sure your body is getting 

640
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,023
exercise,
like put some stress on it so that it 

641
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:32,760
can recover and be stronger and maintain
a certain level of strength.

642
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,500
Because if you don't put any stress on 
it,

643
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:36,170
it stops working and if it stops 
working,

644
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,090
you start your.
You start sagging and deteriorating.

645
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,610
And here's the big one.
Maybe you're an intellectual.

646
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:44,070
Maybe you don't want to have anything to
do with physical stuff because you don't

647
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:44,904
think you think of it as a base thing.
That fucking body has a giant influence 

648
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,350
on your mind.
Eight apps,

649
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:52,290
no separation.
There's no separation.

650
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,153
It is,
and it is just a discipline issue and 

651
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:56,580
there's nothing else.
It's.

652
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:58,110
I'm not saying it should be a 
bodybuilder.

653
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,033
I'm not saying you should go out there 
and fucking run marathons or do 

654
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:04,020
anything.
Even the super stressful,

655
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:06,930
but do some sit ups,
do some pushups,

656
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,000
do some chin ups.
If you can do some,

657
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,970
some running up hills,
pickup some heavy stuff.

658
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:14,850
Move it around and do it regularly.
Do it all the time.

659
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,360
And do it even if you have no desire 
whatsoever to look good naked,

660
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,870
just do it to make your body last 
longer.

661
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,160
Yes.
It's natural anti depressant.

662
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,950
Like I used to live in the Czech 
Republic and there was no gems there.

663
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,063
What we do in there studying history and
there is no jams and I would have like 

664
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:33,940
a.
I didn't feel safe in certain areas,

665
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:38,080
jogging because it was just intense so I
would just jump up and down.

666
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,410
That's it.
I would play like disco or something and

667
00:28:41,411 --> 00:28:44,110
just manically jump up and down and I 
feel awesome.

668
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,960
I had this dumb idea once a few years 
back.

669
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,801
I was like,
well,

670
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:51,490
if you just jumped all the time and you 
kept jumping,

671
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,890
wouldn't you get better at trumping like
wouldn't you?

672
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,783
Like you get stronger and stuff.
It's a matter of like how many reps you 

673
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:57,610
do.
You don't like.

674
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,690
How high could you wind up jumping?
Is there a point of no return?

675
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,723
Dude?
You're telling to a six slash seven guy 

676
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:04,264
who can't dunk,
who's jumped a lot to try and get up 

677
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,583
there.

678
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,000
I think I can get really good at long 
distance running,

679
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:14,140
but I don't have the twitch to go up and
I've tried man.

680
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,530
Well I feel like a cement potato.
I can't jump at all.

681
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,900
I can't dunk for shit.
Married little ups.

682
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:25,780
I could endure some video yesterday of 
the highest jump I've ever seen by a guy

683
00:29:25,781 --> 00:29:28,060
that didn't look that tall.
His top of his head.

684
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,530
You know,
the,

685
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:32,350
the verticals thing.
He had the top one that's unreal.

686
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:35,020
Like mosquito eggs and spoke video.
Yeah,

687
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:37,630
I've saw this one dude that was 
practicing on those.

688
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,010
You ever see those?
Uh,

689
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,540
the Plyo bags,
they're the

690
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,023
plyo boxes,
but the top of them is like a very soft 

691
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:46,230
foam mushy.
So they.

692
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,670
Yeah,
this guy was jumping those and it,

693
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,050
it looked like there was like,
there was wires attached to his hips.

694
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,771
I'm like,
what are they doing?

695
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:56,890
A yanking him up to this guy because he 
was jumping like six feet straight up in

696
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:58,150
the air and landing on this things.
It's like,

697
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,560
wait a minute,
you can,

698
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:02,020
people can do that.
It's like you have jumped privilege.

699
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,120
Oh look at this guy.
Whoa,

700
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,550
that must feel so awesome.
That guy is.

701
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,380
That's a four foot vertical,
right?

702
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,440
Is that a forefoot vertical?
Not sure I don't.

703
00:30:12,441 --> 00:30:14,500
I don't know the exact height of the top
of the backboard.

704
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,730
Know the highest vertical than anybody's
ever jumped.

705
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,180
If you had to guess,
let's take 51 inches.

706
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,960
That's a good guess.
I'll say 53 just for the fuck of it,

707
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:29,961
but just based on your guests being 
really good and awesome thing you do for

708
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,300
people is you motivate people to learn 
new shit,

709
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:38,370
which is crucial for a neuroplasticity.
I'm very happy that I do that,

710
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:40,320
but I only do it because I'm interested 
in it myself.

711
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,350
Dude,
you got me into shoe.

712
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,151
I'm like,
yeah,

713
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:43,050
God,
look at this dude.

714
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,420
Sixty.
So you got it.

715
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:47,430
You got it bro.
Goddamn Leo.

716
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:48,264
Now Marshall,
he's a Cuban professional volleyball 

717
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,230
player and it said to have a 50 inch 
vertical jump.

718
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,500
The next guy is a.
The doors Yanni.

719
00:30:55,501 --> 00:30:56,334
He's a professional dunker with slam 
nation did not exist and is set to hold 

720
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,150
the world record in the vertical at 60 
inches.

721
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:06,750
Okay.
Here's what I don't like is said is said

722
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:08,940
is used twice.
It's like legend has it that.

723
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:13,470
See there's some shitty journalism or 
you're not telling me the truth.

724
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,390
You're just telling me some rumor 
bullshit.

725
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,690
Here's a matter of getting it on on 
tape.

726
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:23,691
I guess.
Here's a 63 or whatever the fuck it is,

727
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:24,990
man.
I don't.

728
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,110
Don't diminish this man's accomplished 
or not,

729
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:28,620
but I got up.
Jamie got this.

730
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,050
I know what you want to see this guy do 
it.

731
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:33,210
Hold on.
I will see this guy do it is insane.

732
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,450
He's really gonna.
Jump that high.

733
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:41,210
That's over his head out 63 inches.
That's fucking dude.

734
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,143
You know,
you know you're good at something when 

735
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:44,340
you're.
When you're like,

736
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,470
you have a crowd for like a gym 
movement.

737
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,030
Here he goes,
oh my God.

738
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,450
Oh my God.
That's fucking insane.

739
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,270
What's that dude's name?
Ryan Moodie or is he?

740
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,070
No,
Evan Unger.

741
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,740
60 three point five inch box.
Jump.

742
00:31:58,741 --> 00:31:59,820
World record.
Hold on,

743
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,340
go back please.
May Thirteenth,

744
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:04,080
2016.
That dude's a beast.

745
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,730
That's ridiculous.
By the way,

746
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,670
to put that energy into something 
positive.

747
00:32:08,671 --> 00:32:10,680
Son.
Just jumping up on rubber tires,

748
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,910
being the CEO of a billion dollar 
company kid,

749
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,953
he gets some serious focus.
Said you're putting your all your 

750
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:20,300
interest on jumping high.
It's like a cross.

751
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,560
It's a cross.
Everyone jump highest.

752
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,460
Okay.
You did it.

753
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,830
You've proven now move forth and you 
know there's no struggle.

754
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,930
There's no pro and box jumping goes 
back.

755
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,130
Yeah,
but you said it goes back to the cross.

756
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,473
Look man,
you're talking to a dude who spent most 

757
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:37,590
of his young days doing taekwondo.
There's very few things.

758
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,800
Do you.
Have you got that to us?

759
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,561
Kicked Torque?
Yeah,

760
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:41,394
but I'm saying like as far as like 
putting your energy into something that 

761
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,820
you could do with your life.
Right?

762
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,400
I'll do.
That was a history major.

763
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:50,050
I'm the guy that I have is like conduit 
Constantine.

764
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,990
I get more drinks.
Like what?

765
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:52,824
The House that get me.
I always loved those guys at the bar 

766
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,590
that know way more than me.
Like what?

767
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,600
Hold on.
What book?

768
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,323
It was always like some obscure 
bartender who could tell you some crazy 

769
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:02,750
shit about Napoleon.
You're like,

770
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:03,584
wait a minute.
Like we were talking about Napoleon 

771
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:06,260
before,
like Napoleon wasn't short,

772
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,020
he was short for today,
but he's a,

773
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,630
he's an inch shorter than me,
is five slash seven,

774
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:16,010
which is very tall for a person who is 
starving to death.

775
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:16,870
Right,
right,

776
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,410
right.
Everybody was back then,

777
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,560
like nobody got good food.
It was like North Korea is now.

778
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:24,710
It's like South Korea and North Korea.
The height difference is massive.

779
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,150
It's so sad,
man.

780
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,013
You know,
all those little people from like the 

781
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:30,950
civil war days,
civil war days,

782
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,240
an average man was like 130 pounds.
The really little tiny fellows.

783
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,283
Yeah.
You see the uniforms and like a museum 

784
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:39,770
and it just looks like smurfs.
Yeah man.

785
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,330
You know,
that's all.

786
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:45,020
It's all just about food.
Is it both me up nutrients,

787
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,393
you know,
it's,

788
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,770
it's a dark thing to think of that.
This is cheers my brother.

789
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,320
Just man.
Thanks for having me.

790
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,333
Thank you.
Thanks for being a fan said dark thing 

791
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:57,770
to think that like nutrients held back 
like the physical development of people.

792
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:00,050
Like they had so little food that they 
weren't growing.

793
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,120
Right.
That's so crazy.

794
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,890
It's not like they were,
you know,

795
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,670
like there was supposed to be that 
small,

796
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,980
oh my God,
this guy's a giant.

797
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,480
Leave comments soldier a look at this.
According to historian bell,

798
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:18,440
I Wiley who pioneered the study of the 
civil war common soldier.

799
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,303
The average Yank or reb was a white 
native born farmer protested single 

800
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,644
between 18 and 29.
He said about five foot eight inches 

801
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:29,090
tall and weighed 143 pounds.
Okay.

802
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:31,370
That's not as small as I thought because
that's average.

803
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:32,204
Now I got like five,
five and I think they were saying that 

804
00:34:36,461 --> 00:34:37,294
the average weight was like 125 pounds 
with the average height was much 

805
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:41,900
smaller.
Maybe it wasn't the civil war.

806
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,690
It was the war of 18,
12.

807
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,830
I think.
Civil war,

808
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,490
I mean we're on a dollar a day and 
today's money until like 1890.

809
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,260
They were broke,
man.

810
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:54,200
I mean my mom,
her parents had a dirt floor,

811
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,390
dirt.

812
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:01,390
My parents were born in America,
but my grandparents came over to America

813
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:07,421
from Italy when they were really young.
Like I think my grandpa was a before the

814
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:09,973
teenage years and and he was telling me 
about the brutality of life on a farm 

815
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:16,010
when you're poor,
during the depression,

816
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,483
you know,
about how,

817
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,970
how we learned to kill rabbits with his 
bare hands,

818
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,973
you know,
how you would explain to me a snapper 

819
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,203
rabbits snack and you're looking in the 
guy's eyes that didn't know whether or 

820
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:29,150
not members of his family would starve 
to death exactly like this.

821
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,100
There was a different world back then.
Man.

822
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,540
Stakes.
Yeah.

823
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,533
No one's worried about pronouns.
My grandfather was a very kind and 

824
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:38,580
gentle man,
sort of belied

825
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,420
like almost the rest of my family and,
and,

826
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,030
and his,
his start in life because he,

827
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:47,160
you know,
he was born during a very,

828
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:47,994
very,
very difficult time and he was just a 

829
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:52,890
really kind demand who liked to read 
books.

830
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:55,470
He was like the gentle one of my family.
So cool.

831
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,870
He was like,
I lived with him when I was a kid when I

832
00:35:57,871 --> 00:35:58,704
was just moving to New York when I had 
to leave Boston and I got a manager and 

833
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,193
my manager lived in New York who I'm 
still with this day and I was like 

834
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:13,350
barely out of the open mic days and um,
I couldn't afford to live in New York by

835
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:14,730
myself.
I tried to figure it out,

836
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:15,564
like how much money I had,
very little saved up and I basically 

837
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,094
just went to New York with my car and 
some clothes and my grandpa let me stay 

838
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:23,424
at his place.

839
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,863
And uh,
it was weird man because my grandmother 

840
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:27,024
was dying.
She had a stroke and they gave her 72 

841
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:33,490
hours and she lived for 12 years.
Ice.

842
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,930
They thought she was going to be dead.
That like you say your goodbyes,

843
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:39,460
get the family to fly to her,
you know,

844
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,353
she,
she had a bad aneurysm and she lived 

845
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:43,750
forever.
It's crazy.

846
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:44,584
So your grandpa took care of her.
He took care of her and I was living 

847
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:48,300
with the two of them while that was 
going on.

848
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,220
So like while I was going as transition 
in my life,

849
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:52,054
like the most exciting thing,
like literally that's ever happened to 

850
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:55,494
me,
I get this real legit manager and I 

851
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,770
started thinking maybe I can actually do
this,

852
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,663
like maybe I can actually be a comic 
because when I was living in Boston I 

853
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:09,240
was doing all sorts of other jobs and it
was never like a professional.

854
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,073
I never had a full.
Like I never had enough work where I 

855
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:15,960
could 100 percent be a comic and I've 
only been doing it for like three years.

856
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,220
Right.
So it was just grinding,

857
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:19,200
constantly grinding,
doing a bunch of different day jobs.

858
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,630
And so when this opportunity came,
I was like,

859
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:23,460
Holy Shit,
I can't believe this is real.

860
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,690
And as like my life was starting to go 
into this crazy place,

861
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,703
I spent a good solid three months,
maybe four living with my grandfather 

862
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:36,780
while my grandmother was dying and 
that's where I live.

863
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:38,970
So I'd come home with them and talk to 
them all the time.

864
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,193
And they lived in a neighborhood that 
used to be a predominantly Italian 

865
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:42,744
American neighborhood in Newark.
But it deteriorated slowly but surely 

866
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,440
until it was like a really.
It went from a black people.

867
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,390
It's just like they did a thing called 
blockbusting.

868
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,840
You ever heard that story?
You know a blog post.

869
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,200
They're trying to get them.
Yeah,

870
00:37:58,201 --> 00:38:00,930
they're trying to.
They did that where they would move into

871
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:04,350
neighborhoods and I don't know whether 
or not it was true or there was doing.

872
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,213
They were doing it to capitalize on 
something that was true or whether they 

873
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:08,214
instigated it,
but they would essentially go door to 

874
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:11,970
door and they would say black people are
moving in,

875
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,893
sell your house now.
And most of my grandparents families 

876
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:19,890
around them sold their house.
And my grandfather was like,

877
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,630
I like black people,
fuck off.

878
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,600
Literally just shut his door.
That's awesome.

879
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,434
Man.
Grandfather was one of those guys as 

880
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,980
long as he has a gate and there's a lock
on the gate,

881
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,490
like everything's good in the world.
And he,

882
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,383
he had like.
So when I would visit him like he had 

883
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:36,040
neighbors,
like the next door neighbor right

884
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,500
next door got arrested for selling 
crack.

885
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,840
This kid had an audi parked in the 
driveway.

886
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,730
They broke through his house with a 
battering ram.

887
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:46,840
That was like right before I moved in.
This is awesome,

888
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:47,621
man.
Yeah.

889
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:48,454
But I was watching their transition to 
death essentially in my transition to 

890
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:56,380
life at the same time.
Yeah,

891
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:59,770
I'd tell them somewhat similar.
I mean that that's to me right now,

892
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,080
like,
that's so profound because like now that

893
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:02,914
I'm like,
I have a family and thinking about my 

894
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,800
wife and he watched the notebook and 
you're like,

895
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,180
oh shit.
But like,

896
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:10,600
my best friend died on my birthday that 
year.

897
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:11,434
I was out here a snowboarding and it was
right as I got like punk and the show 

898
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,620
punked and he like is the one who got me
into standup.

899
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,160
And it was like,
that was so bittersweet,

900
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,040
man.
It was like,

901
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:26,041
it was like the fragility of life as 
you're given this weird ego shot.

902
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,380
Just just was like,
it was so intense.

903
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,720
A good friend of mine died of an 
overdose.

904
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,210
Same thing.
Died of an overdose.

905
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:34,960
Like,
really?

906
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,793
Uh,
I can't say I was out here maybe three 

907
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:42,790
or four years.
He died maybe five at the most.

908
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,450
Uh,
I spent New Year's Eve,

909
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,183
y two k on the phone with him because we
were wondering whether or not the world 

910
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:52,714
will.
Then we were just having fun laughing 

911
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,683
and then he died.
He died of a drug overdose and I found 

912
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:02,284
out about it like secondhand.
Somebody found out about it through 

913
00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:07,480
somebody else and they called me up and 
they asked me if I heard and I said,

914
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:09,880
what happened?
Are you sure?

915
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:10,361
And they said,
yeah.

916
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,160
They found his body in a hotel room and 
on.

917
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:17,250
Oh,
on real rough.

918
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,213
It was rough.
That was the hardest one next to my 

919
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:21,544
grandpa.

920
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,800
Those,
that was the hardest one.

921
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:24,923
Well,
Phil Hartman was pretty God damn hard 

922
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:27,700
to.
That was a hard one.

923
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,770
That was a hard one.
I recently lost a,

924
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:33,460
got a heroin.
He was a vet and it was like,

925
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,523
and you saw it coming,
but it was tragic because his ptsd was 

926
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:39,370
so bad,
but it was like,

927
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,980
to.
The story was a,

928
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,900
he was a d one baseball player at 
everything going for him.

929
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:46,750
His Dad dies,
he wants to join the marines.

930
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:49,690
He's unbelievable at being a sniper,
you know,

931
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,870
they go through how in Afghanistan he 
gets on heroin,

932
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:53,704
ends up in my town,
we become like best friends with my 

933
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,570
brother because like a lot of vets want 
to do tree work because they need that.

934
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,370
Every man needs a purpose,
you know,

935
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,450
and it's like a lack of purpose for like
true warrior hero types,

936
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,313
his death and so like that extreme 
nature of climbing up trees and hauling 

937
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,270
lumber and stuff.
We'd all do it together.

938
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:12,104
And,
and that's what I also like comedy 

939
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:14,140
because the honesty of it,
you know,

940
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:14,974
the dude shot tons and tons of people.
So it's like that feeling of constant 

941
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,504
judgment and guilt and pride and guilt.
Comedy was like a relief for him and 

942
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:25,150
then he just died of heroin man and it 
was like,

943
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,433
you get the this because you know,
I got him a gym membership and all this 

944
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:31,900
shit and we were all like rooting for 
him because he's this beautiful man.

945
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,340
But like there's just a moral injuries

946
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,020
that just can take a toll.
And that was,

947
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,820
that was brutal.
Yeah.

948
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,673
There's some injuries of the mind that 
are probably more devastating injuries 

949
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:43,520
to the body,
you know,

950
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:44,354
and I think that's uh,
that's one of the things that we 

951
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,520
overlook,
what we can't see.

952
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,410
We think about what we can see,
like,

953
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,120
oh,
that guy got shot in the shoulder,

954
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,130
but we don't look at,
Oh,

955
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,650
and watch 10 people die in a fire,
you know,

956
00:41:58,651 --> 00:42:00,950
like,
we don't think of that as an injury.

957
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,790
But I mean think about like,
I've,

958
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,600
I've had some friends that were 
paramedics and they'll tell you like,

959
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,853
accents.
They roll up on suicides that they roll 

960
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:13,580
up on and just after awhile you're like,
oh my God,

961
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,473
you feel so vulnerable.
And one of the things that he said is 

962
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:17,084
like,
a lot of people that do that work or 

963
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:23,600
like a very sexually promiscuous,
they just don't give a fuck.

964
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,493
Yeah.
And they also want to develop the 

965
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,590
develop dark humor,
gallows humor,

966
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:28,611
you know,
like,

967
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:29,444
um,
my buddy quinn from the impractical 

968
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:32,570
jokers used to be a New York City 
firefighter.

969
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,540
And so we did one of my podcasts 
together.

970
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:37,310
I mean,
we've been friends since my space.

971
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:38,260
I mean,
these guys are salted,

972
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,640
the earth man,
they're the fucking greatest dude's like

973
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,474
great statements.
Like say we've been friends since my 

974
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,063
budget.
We used to write each other about our 

975
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:49,460
sketches and shit and it's like,
that dude is seeing just kids torched,

976
00:42:49,461 --> 00:42:49,911
you know,
and,

977
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:51,730
and he's like,
and they had to joke about it.

978
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,573
If not,
you're going to just blow your brains 

979
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:54,170
out.
So yeah.

980
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,670
And then you come home to your own 
family,

981
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:56,910
you know?
Yeah.

982
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,000
It's like,
look at England after World War Two.

983
00:42:59,001 --> 00:42:59,631
It's like,
that's,

984
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:01,730
I think that's what spawned so much 
great music.

985
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:02,840
Some great art is,
you know,

986
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:03,973
you know,
their dads all died man and it's like 

987
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:06,523
for their cities are getting bombed and 
out of that comes this like desire to 

988
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:11,414
live in the moment and to just be able 
to say and do whatever the fuck you can 

989
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,110
before you die.

990
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,213
I think you're totally right.
I think that's the case with Roman art 

991
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:19,544
as well,
right?

992
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,850
I mean why is there so much artistic 
expression back then?

993
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:23,703
Why?
Why were people so determined to put 

994
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:26,474
their emotions down on campus?
Those emotions were like hurricane 

995
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:32,990
swirling in your brain,
visions of people getting cut in half by

996
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,824
swords and arrows piercing sternums 
choking to death on their own blood and 

997
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:43,400
fucking hordes of barbarians coming over
the top of the hill with the horses,

998
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,640
swinging axes like,
whoa,

999
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:50,720
that was real shit back then know 
someone with a blue check mark is mad at

1000
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:51,840
me.
In fact,

1001
00:43:51,841 --> 00:43:54,970
then people are just getting their heads
chopped off and you know,

1002
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,813
I've been thinking about this a lot 
lately with this Kevin Spacey thing is 

1003
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,700
that pedophilia is horrific.
We all agree it's.

1004
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,490
It's terrifying.
It's,

1005
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,343
it's,
it's so devastating because as we were 

1006
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:10,880
talking about before,
if someone gets shot,

1007
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,290
you could see the wound.

1008
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:17,650
If someone gets raped by an act or when 
they're 12 years old,

1009
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,040
like how do you fix that?
Right?

1010
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,080
What,
what is that?

1011
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:21,914
What kind of psychic wound is that?
And what I was thinking is it's really 

1012
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,204
fascinating to me that we,
we pretty much acknowledged that 

1013
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,320
pederasts were commonplace in the 15th 
century,

1014
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,310
the Twelfth Century,
the 13th century,

1015
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:41,010
the 14th century,
this way,

1016
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:41,844
way into the 18 hundreds.
And then when you go with the Catholic 

1017
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,103
Church,
I mean it is,

1018
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,483
if you're a Catholic,
you shut your fucking iphone off right 

1019
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:51,210
now.
You know what I'm saying?

1020
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,240
Nobody raised Catholic and that was as 
well.

1021
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,440
Don't get your panties in a bundle.
It is a religion built on kid fucking.

1022
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,413
It is a religion dude.
It's all about as a giant history of 

1023
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:03,910
that and it's because they,
they,

1024
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:04,943
they wouldn't let the priests have 
families based on land ownership and 

1025
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:12,840
some of these moves can take a beautiful
religion and make it really dark.

1026
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,690
And there was more than that.
It wasn't just that they didn't let him,

1027
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:18,870
they didn't want to fuck women because 
they were a God damn rock stars.

1028
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:23,600
The guys who held the Bible and could 
lead literally read it right?

1029
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,480
The average person could relax.
They're all reading German and all these

1030
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:28,440
different languages.
I wouldn't.

1031
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:29,274
Martin Luther.
Have you ever heard the prophets of 

1032
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:31,600
doom?
Yeah.

1033
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,680
Prophets of doom.
Dan Carlin is one of my favorite fucking

1034
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,320
human beings and several lived and his 
podcast.

1035
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:38,154
Hardcore history is a national treasure.
Because I've learned more about history 

1036
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:46,521
and more about like the mon goals and a 
World War II and fucking everything,

1037
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,640
but his podcast on Martin Luther and the
trend,

1038
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:51,503
the first literal translations of the 
Bible that regular common folk could 

1039
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,460
read who've lost their minds.
They're like,

1040
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:57,294
Jesus was poor too.
Guys dependent wars killed hundreds of 

1041
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:01,470
thousands of people.

1042
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:06,300
Imagine a world folks were until.
What was it like the 15 hundreds?

1043
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,270
Yeah,
mid fifties.

1044
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,910
It was round Gutenberg,
so that was like a 15 hundreds,

1045
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,420
mid 15 Sinai when Martin Luther was 95 
theses in deck,

1046
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,460
but the bottom line is what he had done 
was translate the Bible.

1047
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:21,294
He Slang.
A lot of Dick guarantee wasn't doing 

1048
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:27,711
this because he just wanted people to be
free to October 31st,

1049
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:29,250
so.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1050
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:31,680
It was yesterday.
This is crazy.

1051
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,653
Did.
It was after US sober October 500 years 

1052
00:46:34,771 --> 00:46:35,251
ago.
By the way.

1053
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,410
I'm feeling a toasty.
I feel so good right now.

1054
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,940
Filled right back.
I was worried,

1055
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,430
man.
I was worried that if I smoked a joint,

1056
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,080
I'd be like,
Oh my God,

1057
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:47,520
I'm gonna.
Die a worm of paranoia.

1058
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,400
Thinking about girls,
I figured in high school,

1059
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,590
for me it's the adipose man.
I like,

1060
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:55,680
I don't smoke every now and that if like
there's someone I trust,

1061
00:46:55,681 --> 00:46:58,190
I know as good we will like Seattle,
Seattle's that.

1062
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,970
I'm like,
this is just flesh,

1063
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,350
but that should make,
makes me like real.

1064
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,050
Um,
so this was the 15 hundreds,

1065
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:08,280
15,
15 is I would just a 15,

1066
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:09,114
17.
So think about that like before then 

1067
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,013
that we're only talking that we're 
literally only talking about 500 years 

1068
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:17,400
ago.
Yeah,

1069
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,700
exactly.
That was the last information overload.

1070
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:21,563
So think about 500 years in terms of the
life of the human species is mere of 

1071
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,593
mere blip and one of the reasons why the
Catholic Church was able to get away 

1072
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:31,504
with just translating things to people 
where they couldn't read it is because 

1073
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:38,680
that's how fucking everybody did it.
They all did it that way.

1074
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:39,723
You would go to some place and some guy 
would tell you what the sacred stuff 

1075
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:43,720
would be and you'd be like,
okay,

1076
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:44,554
cool.
Like how many people actually got ahold 

1077
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,720
of it and read it all day and,
and studied it.

1078
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,553
And made sure there was no 
contradictions is why is this guy keep 

1079
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:55,960
fucking my wife Jesus.
The Catholics were like the buzzfeed.

1080
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,440
They were banging everybody.
I guarantee you they had money.

1081
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,340
They were allowed to have wives.
Like,

1082
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,060
do you know that like early Pope's ran 
armies?

1083
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:04,923
Oh yeah,
I did.

1084
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:05,763
They were nuts.
They had to go to France for a little 

1085
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:08,520
while to like,
you know,

1086
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,710
because had so much heat on them because
it's what it fused with constantly.

1087
00:48:16,341 --> 00:48:17,174
It's when a fused with the Roman empire,
you got that Empire Shit because 

1088
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:19,834
Christianity is a beautiful.
Religion is more like mellow and 

1089
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:22,890
peaceful.
And,

1090
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,870
and then you got constantine,
you know,

1091
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,773
the Roman Empire is falling apart and 
they wanted to get more favor of the 

1092
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:29,564
people.
So they just fuse the two together and 

1093
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:32,200
they're like,
you know,

1094
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,930
they got,
the pope's gone crazy.

1095
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,673
They ran armies.

1096
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,770
That was one of the things that 
happened.

1097
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:42,160
Apparently there was a conflict.
I hope I'm not fucking this up.

1098
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:43,443
It was from hardcore history.
There was a conflict where one of the 

1099
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:50,000
earlier pope's didn't want to send 
troops to fight gang is con,

1100
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,453
like there was a lot of confusion in the
early days of getting his con because 

1101
00:48:54,221 --> 00:48:55,740
before getting,
Goddammit,

1102
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,690
I've said it in the past,
if you heard it in the past,

1103
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:01,510
I apologize for repeating myself,
but the wrath of Khan,

1104
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:05,500
wrath of the con series of Dan Carlin 
Sunrail streaks on real.

1105
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:10,501
One of my favorite pieces of work,
whether it's a comedy,

1106
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,780
a movie,
one of my favorite creations ever.

1107
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,190
It's unreal.
It's amazing.

1108
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,730
It literally changed my life.
It's like I got like a Harvard education

1109
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:22,450
after paying for a state education for 
free.

1110
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,860
I know that in the game and then if you 
want to get the wrath of the cons,

1111
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:28,600
you could just buy it on itunes.

1112
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:30,070
It's a dollar a show.
That's it.

1113
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:33,250
It's so worth it and I think it's like 
each one of them is at least an hour and

1114
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:33,960
a half long.
Oh,

1115
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,060
some are five.
The blitz or sick to get all of them.

1116
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,913
The whole series,
right?

1117
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,753
The series is fine,
but not an individual podcast like the 

1118
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,093
uh,
recent blitz a was over five about 

1119
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:47,080
nuclear war and the whole podcast by 
itself is fine,

1120
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,960
but yeah,
and then he just had the Gothic,

1121
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,760
a genocide of the gothic Holocaust.
I was another fiber.

1122
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,200
So gangster.
And he,

1123
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:55,060
by the way,
he does this whole himself folks.

1124
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:55,923
He edits it all himself.
So it was like that dollar is so worth 

1125
00:49:57,881 --> 00:49:58,714
it and in my opinion,
he's like one of the most people just 

1126
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:02,610
don't know.
You know,

1127
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,453
you're not hearing about this on CNN,
you not hear about this on Fox News and 

1128
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:08,020
it is a travesty.

1129
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:08,883
It is one of the best ways for you to 
learn about history because you learn 

1130
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:14,710
about it.
He gives you a broad,

1131
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,753
detailed sense of the time.
He does it in a very entertaining way 

1132
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:22,840
that you want to keep tuning in and that
those memories stick to your brain.

1133
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,633
There's an art to saying things 
interesting and he has that old whole 

1134
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:30,490
series for 10 bucks.
It's so worth it.

1135
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,100
That one and a half beers guys,
that's so worth it.

1136
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,480
Whereas that is website Dan Carlin Doc.
Okay.

1137
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,473
Um,
but you can also order it on itunes if 

1138
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:39,920
you have.
I don't have an android phone,

1139
00:50:39,921 --> 00:50:41,600
but if you have an eye I do,
but I don't use it.

1140
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:42,643
But if you have an iphone you can order 
it on itunes and it'll go straight to 

1141
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:47,450
your podcasts.
Yeah.

1142
00:50:47,451 --> 00:50:49,820
And there's another one that goes to the
oster front.

1143
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:50,840
Mm.
Oh.

1144
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:51,683
And he also has that old timey voice,
almost like the joker where he keeps 

1145
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:58,420
hitting you.
It's like what is a monument of?

1146
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:01,063
Yes.
He's a great combination of 

1147
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:08,530
entertainment information and humility.
Like he's really humble.

1148
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:09,970
He's like,
I'm not a historian,

1149
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,813
but most of us think that the real.
And then I'll just the anabaptist 

1150
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:17,180
clearly when they purged wizard wizard,
so,

1151
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,133
so important.
And I mean I've talked about them many 

1152
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:20,654
times in the past,
a point where I backed off because my 

1153
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:23,390
God talk about 10.
Carla too much.

1154
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,613
That was brian red bands and one who got
me into it because I the only podcast I 

1155
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:29,200
listen to yours like maybe five,
four years ago.

1156
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,820
That was the only one I really had and a
and I'm like,

1157
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,380
Yo Redman,
what else should I listen to?

1158
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,560
It just goes,
and I think it was just so fucked up and

1159
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:39,350
he still like,
it was like that.

1160
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,370
Just,
just,

1161
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,320
just set me off a journey,
you know?

1162
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:45,230
One another great one is Danieli Lily's 
history on fire.

1163
00:51:45,231 --> 00:51:46,700
Listen to that.
That's good.

1164
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:49,660
Plus you get a fantastic accent.
I mean,

1165
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,020
Danielle,
he bullied his,

1166
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:51,854
his,
his,

1167
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,340
his accent.
He's like,

1168
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:55,520
Oh God,
like a super Italian accent.

1169
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:56,030
I know.
I'm like,

1170
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:59,660
this is kind of sexy.
So much that after this I'm not even gay

1171
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,580
at all,
but this is why people will say,

1172
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:04,910
and the Roman gods,
because they all talk to each other.

1173
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,133
We were kind of wig red around that,
but it's stunning to me that what we 

1174
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:13,430
were originally talking about was like 
how common being a pedophile was.

1175
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,513
He was like super common.
That until there is history on fire 

1176
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:23,060
profess or about spartacus,
spudding kids.

1177
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,340
He's a beautiful person too.
I love that guy.

1178
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,260
Fucking great dude.
Um,

1179
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,153
but it's,
it's amazing how recent it was where 

1180
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,810
that was taboo,
where you weren't,

1181
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,710
where people like,
hey,

1182
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,200
maybe we should stop fucking kids.

1183
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,410
That's my,
that's my one.

1184
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,393
Like I have a few rules in life,
but the number one is don't fuck the 

1185
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:41,111
kids.
Well,

1186
00:52:41,111 --> 00:52:42,500
it's 100 percent.
Number one,

1187
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:45,150
don't hurt the children.
Don't hurt the children are physically.

1188
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:46,970
Don't hurt them sexually.
Don't hurt him mentally.

1189
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,620
Don't hurt the kids.
That's number one.

1190
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:49,454
Feed.
Protect and teach what you are is the 

1191
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:53,643
result of some crazy shit that happened 
to you and some awesome shit that 

1192
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:57,164
happened to you and your ability to 
manage that fucking the land in between 

1193
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:02,680
the two that causes depression.
Yeah.

1194
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,740
Between chaos and order.

1195
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,200
Law and order.
Yeah.

1196
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,893
I mean that's what our job is,
is to figure out a way to make the best 

1197
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:18,650
people we can and raise those people so 
that those people are going to impact as

1198
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:20,270
many people as they can in a positive 
way.

1199
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,310
And if this can be done,
look,

1200
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,870
you got to realize that the people of 
today,

1201
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,113
we're were basically biologically the 
same as the people that live in the 

1202
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:29,874
gangs con days.
But we couldn't be further apart in 

1203
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:34,470
terms of the way we look at the world.
It's our software programming.

1204
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,670
Yeah,
exactly.

1205
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,520
Think about how you are,
how Jamie is her,

1206
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:39,354
most of the people we know are.
And then think about getting his cons 

1207
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:45,060
mob of savages that were just eating.
People are like,

1208
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:45,894
uh,
Syria.

1209
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,790
Uh,
Carlin gets into that.

1210
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,620
It's a judgement at,
at Nineveh,

1211
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,553
it's like these people were like public 
scannings and burnings and because it 

1212
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:55,614
was just all about just the yoke of 
oppression in your life was just pain 

1213
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:03,510
and you wanted to inflict that pain on 
other people.

1214
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,610
So you agreed to like,
there was like,

1215
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,473
there,
there's like almost like a sort of an 

1216
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:14,150
evolutionary basis and staying as close 
to people as you can while agreeing with

1217
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,510
his little evidence as possible to 
murder them all.

1218
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,213
Just like we're like witch trials.
And one of the things that freaked me 

1219
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:24,774
out about Dan Carlin's history of the 
Mongols thing was he started talking 

1220
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:33,111
about how there's speculation that 
decimation like the term decimation came

1221
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:36,390
from like a 100.
They would eat one of them.

1222
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,600
Oh no way that they need.
Why would eat one?

1223
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:42,900
There was speculation that some of the 
Mongols like decimation,

1224
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:47,340
like decimated and it's like destroying,
but would it really is like a desperate,

1225
00:54:47,341 --> 00:54:50,490
like this 10 people you kill one was run
out of supplies,

1226
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,623
but that the Mongols would pick one 
amongst them and they would eat them so 

1227
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,250
that the rest of the troops would 
survive.

1228
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:59,520
I was like,
that is so crazy.

1229
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:03,390
And the guy was pretty hightest.
Like if you were above a wagon wheel,

1230
00:55:03,391 --> 00:55:05,670
you just cut your fucking head off.
Here's what decimation means.

1231
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:06,504
The killing of one in every 10 of a 
group of people as a punishment for the 

1232
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:13,980
whole group.
But that was just the punishment.

1233
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,810
What Dan Carlin was talking about is 
there's some people and maybe he doesn't

1234
00:55:18,811 --> 00:55:22,110
agree with them or maybe he does,
but some people believe it's possible.

1235
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,750
The Mongols did this practice in order 
to stay alive.

1236
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,601
They definitely did.
They,

1237
00:55:25,601 --> 00:55:28,680
they used to suck the blood out of their
horses and they would add milk to it.

1238
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:29,603
Yeah.
They're just,

1239
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,050
they're hungry.
They're like,

1240
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,370
oh,
I'm just going to suck some blood on his

1241
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,001
horse.
Yeah,

1242
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:36,060
that's how they stayed alive.
They would cut the blood,

1243
00:55:36,061 --> 00:55:36,894
like cut an artery fill like a jug with 
blood and then they would milk them and 

1244
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:42,090
mix the blood and the milk together and 
they would eat that.

1245
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,033
And then their kids started getting soft
because they became quote unquote 

1246
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:48,090
Chinese.
So like they like a Coupla guys.

1247
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:50,640
They used to have to send them back to 
the step to keep their edge.

1248
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:52,410
Jesus Christ,
you know,

1249
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:53,460
it's like,
because I feel like,

1250
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:54,294
uh,
it's like when I call someone like ally 

1251
00:55:55,631 --> 00:55:56,464
of people and some New York people,
I call them a indoor cats warehouse 

1252
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,490
cats.
It's like,

1253
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,343
it's,
it's like the difference between a 

1254
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,733
pigeon and like a bird of paradise with 
the big plumes because they don't have 

1255
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,930
any fucking predators.
Moshe Kasher is a house cat big time.

1256
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,553
I love him,
but he's.

1257
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,930
Yeah,
he's totally.

1258
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:13,651
Yeah,
same here.

1259
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:14,484
It's like I was with it,
but then we'll get into like all this 

1260
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:18,850
shit where I'm like,
it gets all social justice warrior.

1261
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:22,310
Like you don't have any natural 
predators around bear son.

1262
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:22,940
Yeah,
he didn't.

1263
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:26,890
You don't hang out with vets as you drop
trees in fucking try to stay off heroin.

1264
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,870
I would like to take Moshe Kasher peer 
hunting.

1265
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,470
That'd be hilarious.
Take him into Alberta.

1266
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,880
Let him see a grizzly lock.
Eyes the Grizzly for the first time that

1267
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:40,150
quizzy doesn't give a fuck about 
diversity.

1268
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:40,911
It's okay.
Mosha.

1269
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:41,920
That's patriarchy.

1270
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,250
Hang a thousand pound thing.
That just needs to eat.

1271
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,890
How much does the Grizzly bear needed?
Eta a day.

1272
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,290
Again,
let's get the only gays,

1273
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,180
but they eat.
A lot of gangs.

1274
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,440
Started screaming.
They'll eat.

1275
00:56:56,441 --> 00:56:59,650
You will.
Well the stereotype.

1276
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,753
Yeah,
that guy was gay.

1277
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:02,140
Oh,
full blonde.

1278
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,993
Hundred percent grizzly man.
The number one greatest unintentional 

1279
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:10,870
comedy human beings have ever created.
It beats roadhouse.

1280
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:14,500
It beats showgirls.
It beats everything.

1281
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,573
That is awesome,
but still sucks at the same guy did I 

1282
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,630
watched roadhouse at least once a year.
Bad.

1283
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:24,040
I love roadhouse.
Went on a tirade one night on twitter,

1284
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:27,310
I was high as fuck and I was watching 
road house and it was just so ridiculous

1285
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:29,230
how gay it was.
Like I like,

1286
00:57:29,231 --> 00:57:31,750
how did I miss this?
And so I went on this whole,

1287
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:32,940
uh,
I went on like a,

1288
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
like a series of twitter posts of Dalton
and what isn't that guy's named Sam,

1289
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,770
Sam,
Elliot,

1290
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,933
Elliot,
Sam Elliott and Dalton hanging out 

1291
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:46,570
together and like,
this is the gay shit.

1292
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,070
How did I miss this?
Yeah.

1293
00:57:48,071 --> 00:57:49,750
And he never really wanted to get with 
that chick.

1294
00:57:49,751 --> 00:57:50,584
You always just wanting to be like 
shirtless and look cool and like 

1295
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,590
doorways and shit.
Paint on her.

1296
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:54,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

1297
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:56,500
He just wanted to look tough and cool to
her.

1298
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,790
It was amazing.
I know.

1299
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,633
And like,
and like it was the worst bouncer in 

1300
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:02,110
history,
like you're supposed to deescalate.

1301
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,380
And he's like,
oh,

1302
00:58:03,381 --> 00:58:04,550
you spill a drink.
I'm a,

1303
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:09,070
I'm going to beat the fuck out of 30 
people a bear must eat 90 pounds of food

1304
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:10,880
each day.
Yeah.

1305
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,233
If you were telling them to fuck,
they may intake one Ali Wong per day 

1306
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,410
during the winter.
When food is scarce,

1307
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:21,831
oh my God,
no,

1308
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:22,091
no,
no.

1309
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:22,924
Grizzly bears are specialized to adapt 
during warmer months to eat a massive 

1310
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:26,554
amounts of food so they can live off 
during the body fat during the winter 

1311
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:30,760
when food is scarce.

1312
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,740
So yeah,
they don't eat during the winter.

1313
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:34,840
Most of the time they just hibernate.
So they get like super,

1314
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:37,780
super fat intake.
Forty kilograms,

1315
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:40,210
90 pounds of food a day.
That's Alli Ninety.

1316
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,840
Well you were talking about on a podcast
about a when they blueberries.

1317
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:46,750
It's an interesting flavor.
I never experienced it,

1318
00:58:46,751 --> 00:58:48,670
but apparently that's what everybody 
says.

1319
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:49,504
And Steven Rinella had a show about it 
where he shot a bear on a blueberry 

1320
00:58:52,391 --> 00:58:54,770
patch and then when he's opening the bar
up.

1321
00:58:54,771 --> 00:58:56,950
But you see purple,
like a purple.

1322
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,210
Yeah,
it's funny.

1323
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,940
My new specials literally called feed 
the bear.

1324
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:02,600
I saw that.
Yeah,

1325
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:03,434
that's what she decided to call it that 
because like when I get hammered I get 

1326
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,084
like pretty happy and um,
and sometimes and occasionally on 

1327
00:59:10,031 --> 00:59:13,060
several occasions I've been like pretty 
blacked out and just feed them,

1328
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,420
feed the bear,
rather.

1329
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:17,340
It's about like sex with my wife or more
beers or I'm just like,

1330
00:59:17,341 --> 00:59:18,160
yeah,
feed the bear here.

1331
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,210
Come on.
Feed that bear fruit.

1332
00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:20,420
The big old bear.
Good.

1333
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,730
Good name for a special as any feed the 
bear.

1334
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,863
Yeah.
Why not?

1335
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,490
Yeah,
I,

1336
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:26,630
I'm horrible at titling Shit.
I'll like,

1337
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:28,243
I'll come up with like 50 and just 
having no fucking idea and I just have 

1338
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:32,390
to pick something.
Yeah,

1339
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,650
they're tough.
It's tough.

1340
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:38,080
Like you be wacky.
DEB self-indulgent degree.

1341
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,930
Besides Jamie put on the on air light.
It's bothering me.

1342
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,050
The on air light is off.
I feel like there's need to be official.

1343
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,670
This new studio.
Watch that.

1344
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:50,600
That's awesome.
Oh see my Dick just moved a little bit.

1345
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,010
Mine too.
Nice.

1346
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:54,440
I feel better.
I don't know why I need to see that.

1347
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,960
I need to shut it off.
Turn it on when I walk in the room.

1348
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,480
Um,
but yeah man bears.

1349
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,100
Fuck bears.
Fuck them.

1350
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,810
So the reason why we had to build 
houses,

1351
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,570
I'd be living in tents if there is no 
mountain lions and bears and Shit and,

1352
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,910
and black bears are.

1353
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,630
Everyone says,
oh,

1354
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,360
because we have a bunch of black bears,
and they always say,

1355
01:00:10,361 --> 01:00:11,300
I like harmless.
They are,

1356
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:14,030
but they're definitely not.
You can still fuck you out.

1357
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,120
Kid got killed last year in Alaska.
It during a road race,

1358
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,070
race,
a road rage.

1359
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,043
The kid was in a road race.
He was 16 years old and he was running 

1360
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,540
and he called.
His mom,

1361
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:27,230
said that a bear was following him and 
then he might be in trouble and the bear

1362
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:31,220
killed him bear.
When the park ranger showed up,

1363
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:32,054
the bear was trying to shoo them away 
from his cash because he had buried the 

1364
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:41,210
kid,
pulled the kids body into the forest and

1365
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:42,044
was covering up leaves and shit,
and they came and he was defending his 

1366
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:47,370
kill.
Yeah,

1367
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,730
high stakes shit.
Fuck bears.

1368
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,490
Bears.
Bears are not Yogi.

1369
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,200
I'm not saying we should eliminate them.

1370
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,230
I'm not saying we should kill them all 
and make them extinct,

1371
01:00:57,231 --> 01:01:01,370
but don't put them above people.
You are God damn crazy person if they.

1372
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:04,220
If you think about your children,
think about your mother.

1373
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:05,143
Think about people that you love that 
could easily have been eaten by this 

1374
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:08,023
bear and understand that these are these
things or consequence of the natural 

1375
01:01:11,511 --> 01:01:15,560
world that we engage with and you cannot
put them above people.

1376
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,170
It's just you are a trader to your 
species.

1377
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:19,743
Yeah,
of course you're missing the whole 

1378
01:01:21,441 --> 01:01:22,274
lesson that was learned by civilization 
and we miss it to the people that the 

1379
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:28,850
only thing that civilization is the key 
and that fuck the animals,

1380
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:29,893
they miss it too.
But the people that don't understand 

1381
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:33,640
what the animals actually are like,
you,

1382
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:37,580
you're missing a giant wolves will eat 
your family.

1383
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,690
There are a lot of herbivores.

1384
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:39,523
Well,
it's like what you were talking about 

1385
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:40,850
with,
uh,

1386
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:44,060
with the people that used to have to 
break a rabbit's snack to,

1387
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,171
you know,
like my,

1388
01:01:45,171 --> 01:01:46,004
uh,
my mom,

1389
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,100
my uncle,
my mom's brother there were so poor that

1390
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:49,993
he used to hunt for their food and then 
he became wealthy and now he goes to 

1391
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:54,430
Africa to hunt,
you know,

1392
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:58,580
the Cape Buffaloes and you know,
and uh,

1393
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,460
the Cape Buffalo,
those are really dangerous.

1394
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,260
And they call them the black death.
Yeah.

1395
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,540
Though I guess they're more dangerous 
than like lions and shit.

1396
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:08,480
They can rip you apart thousands of 
pounds.

1397
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,900
They're enormous animals and they,
you know,

1398
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,750
like even lions have a hard time taking 
those fucking things out.

1399
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:15,823
There's a,
there's a documentary called relentless 

1400
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:20,100
enemies and it's about this one area of

1401
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,933
Africa that something happened in the 
river shifted course and when the 

1402
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:27,000
river's shifted course created an 
island,

1403
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:32,150
a very large island,
but on this island was lions and buffalo

1404
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,500
and the lions had to get bigger because 
all they could kill was the buffalo.

1405
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:39,630
So these lines,
they.

1406
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:42,540
It's a really fascinating thing because 
they think it only happened,

1407
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,670
man,
I don't want to talk at a school because

1408
01:02:44,671 --> 01:02:47,040
I always do,
but I think it was like 200 years ago.

1409
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:47,903
I think it was like a real recent amount
of time and in that time these lines 

1410
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:52,530
have developed like hulk,
like bodies.

1411
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:56,250
They look freakish.
The average female lion is as big as the

1412
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:59,280
average male lion on mainland Africa 
too.

1413
01:02:59,281 --> 01:03:01,320
It's crazy how fast evolution moves.
It's like,

1414
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:02,154
ah,
there's this type of math in England 

1415
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,640
that was white and it used to hide on 
the,

1416
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,713
on the Birch,
and then when the industrial revolution 

1417
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,660
kicked off,
uh,

1418
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,713
it made everything city in the,
in the fucking mouth was black and like 

1419
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:14,124
30 years because the birds is kept 
picking off all the white ones and then 

1420
01:03:17,731 --> 01:03:20,910
like the only three that were black or 
getting all the pussy.

1421
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,230
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1422
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:25,500
It's like a,
they say a white person becomes black if

1423
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,440
they have to live in African lifestyle 
Subsaharan and 20,000

1424
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:30,990
years like you're totally black.
Yeah.

1425
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,430
Well that's what white is.
What?

1426
01:03:32,431 --> 01:03:35,340
Why does a solar panel for Vitamin d?
Totally.

1427
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:36,290
That's all it is.
Yeah.

1428
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,700
We're just fucking snow monkeys.
Everybody is.

1429
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,250
Everybody's the same.
We would have been way better off.

1430
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,084
We only looked,
we all look the same and the only thing 

1431
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:47,230
that separated us were how fucking 
stupid you were.

1432
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,520
We have been way better off.
That'd be an unbelievable.

1433
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:52,800
We'd be able to categorize people in 
like affective ways,

1434
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,583
but instead you get these white people 
that are only into other white people 

1435
01:03:56,851 --> 01:03:57,181
like,
Hey,

1436
01:03:57,181 --> 01:04:00,270
fuck heads.
It's the least effective categories.

1437
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,280
So bad.
It's such a bad category.

1438
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,290
Like put dummies versus smarties.
That's a good category.

1439
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:06,570
Credit category.
Same with like,

1440
01:04:06,571 --> 01:04:07,404
you know,
I judge people based on like pleated 

1441
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:09,240
pants.

1442
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,000
Whether you can keep a secret,
keep a secret as massive.

1443
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:17,130
Like keep a secret is huge.
It's huge.

1444
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,113
That's why it's like I'll get on boards 
or like I'll get on board with some 

1445
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:24,150
shit's moving around,
but I don't want to.

1446
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,330
I'm not a big reveal guy.
I think that shit's for the birds.

1447
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,673
Big reveal guy.
Like when people just talk shit about 

1448
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:35,000
people or it's I guess what I.
Now I know I'm not like that distraction

1449
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,700
you.
They're like,

1450
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:39,480
if you don't have to do that,
you shouldn't do that.

1451
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:40,314
But the only reason why you want to do 
that is we want to create some 

1452
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:47,260
excitement outside of what you're 
actually doing to progress the.

1453
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,340
The life that you live in,
right?

1454
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,253
Yeah.
Unless do like calling someone out like 

1455
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:53,160
someone committed a crime or something 
like that.

1456
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:55,260
We're not talking about that,
but it's like this idea.

1457
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:57,180
I'm just saying I could keep a secret 
with a crime too.

1458
01:04:57,181 --> 01:05:02,181
If you ever come to the instinct,
the instinct to engage in that is all.

1459
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:04,110
It's all negative.
You know,

1460
01:05:04,111 --> 01:05:04,791
and,
and I,

1461
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:05,624
I think it goes back to that whole 
reward system thing were I think in a 

1462
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:10,104
lot of ways we're very program to not 
just accept but even seek out conflict 

1463
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,403
and to be upset about things and to like
look for those things in the news and 

1464
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,213
look for those things because we don't.
How often do you see conflict with 

1465
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:24,340
humans?
You know,

1466
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:26,110
like if you see like Manhattan,
right?

1467
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,360
And you see all these people that are 
driving their cars,

1468
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,280
walk in,
get on the bus,

1469
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:31,173
get on the train.
The vast majority show no conflict with 

1470
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:39,280
each other.
The absolute vast majority.

1471
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:41,680
It's actually amazing.
It's fucking magnificent.

1472
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,070
Chimps were so peaceful compared to what
we could be,

1473
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:49,510
but now compare that to the vast 
majority of interactions online.

1474
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,000
No comparison.
The online might be 50 percent conflict.

1475
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:57,731
Yeah.
Yeah.

1476
01:05:57,731 --> 01:05:59,140
And it's absurd.
Conflict.

1477
01:05:59,141 --> 01:05:59,974
Yeah.
It's like I'm going to fuck your mouth 

1478
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:01,780
with a gun.
I'm like,

1479
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:03,030
I thought we were talking about 
healthcare.

1480
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,083
Wait a minute.
You can't even do that to someone 

1481
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:07,780
explained to you what fuck is.
You can't,

1482
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,860
you know the one on the chalkboard if 
you fuck my mouth with a gun.

1483
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:15,820
It's like when you reveal that you don't
know something based on an intense.

1484
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:19,060
And so did you see that thing that 
someone wrote about Ivanka trump?

1485
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:19,933
All the different words that she uses 
wrong and like that she doesn't 

1486
01:06:22,421 --> 01:06:23,254
understand English.

1487
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:26,980
I mean,
look man,

1488
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:28,180
how old is she?
Like 30.

1489
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,190
Oh no,
she's not.

1490
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,640
She's not old right now for sure.
For sure.

1491
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:35,620
Don't 36,
36.

1492
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:39,400
I'll give her a pass.
So she is 38.

1493
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:40,383
I just,
you know,

1494
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:42,783
most people don't know how to use words 
correctly and then all of a sudden your 

1495
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:47,200
fucking dad,
the president.

1496
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:47,651
You're like,
wait,

1497
01:06:47,651 --> 01:06:49,750
I thought you were reality show host,
right?

1498
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:52,420
I think I thought it easy road here.
What the fuck?

1499
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,690
I thought I would never reached the 
public guy.

1500
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:59,600
I'd be fucking flying private jets to 
Israel every year if you're like now and

1501
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,950
I need to know what magnanimity means.
What?

1502
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:05,320
What about the yacht on the Caribbean?
That's hilarious.

1503
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,930
That's what I was preparing my 35 years 
for.

1504
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,490
All of a sudden after figuring out the 
correct use of words did I got a massive

1505
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:16,000
verbal skills and horrible spelling.

1506
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,630
I've liked this weird,
like my,

1507
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,620
my ability to hear words,
remember words.

1508
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:23,560
My vocabulary is huge,
but I spent like a fucking idiot.

1509
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,930
My spelling's atrocious.
Like horrible.

1510
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:26,541
Yeah.
My.

1511
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,240
Well,
I rely on that squiggly line,

1512
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:31,360
that red squiggly line.
That's so critical for me.

1513
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:34,810
But what about no suggestions?
I don't play that game man.

1514
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:35,930
That's like,
you know,

1515
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,390
like swinging an ax.
Well,

1516
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:38,224
steel toed boots,
but sometimes I don't realize it's in 

1517
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:43,960
Spanish.
Oh yeah.

1518
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,070
And like as a,
you know,

1519
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:49,220
I'm flying my late night rants and fly.
My thumbs are flying thumbs.

1520
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:51,700
So you do everything 100 percent from 
your phone.

1521
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:52,893
Everything from stronger addiction 
because you're not even pretending you 

1522
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:58,100
might get a productivity done.
Like if you,

1523
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:02,110
if your laptop and you've got Microsoft 
Word Open.

1524
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:02,963
Yeah,
and occasionally you check twitter like 

1525
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:06,510
bitch,
you don't know shit about Beethoven,

1526
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,013
but I'm trying to wind down,
which is crazy because it's like the 

1527
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:14,860
worst way to wind down.
It's just like cyber conflict.

1528
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,130
That's not a way to wind down.

1529
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,023
That's not the way to wine because my 
wife would fall asleep before me and 

1530
01:08:19,341 --> 01:08:22,980
then you know,
I don't want to watch TV and be loud and

1531
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:25,010
sometimes I'll go in other rooms and 
shit.

1532
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:27,290
But you know,
well I think,

1533
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:30,070
I mean this is very pretentious to say 
but,

1534
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,490
but,
but it is true.

1535
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:32,523
But I think that all of us who are 
having a chance to talk about our 

1536
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:38,780
experiences in this life are influencing
each other.

1537
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,240
That includes you.
That includes everybody.

1538
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:45,710
I know the clues red should fear and 
Thompson and Duncan were all influencing

1539
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:50,770
each other and we were all in some way 
helping each other like mitigate all the

1540
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:56,990
weird influences that we experience.
And there's a big one.

1541
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,153
The Big One is our addiction to 
information and that the addiction to 

1542
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:06,050
information can overwhelm your ability 
to process the information.

1543
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,153
Like if you're just reading shit about 
like world news and a breaking news and 

1544
01:09:13,821 --> 01:09:17,990
all the craziness you're doing that all 
day while you're awake.

1545
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,850
Like I say,
if you gave your phone,

1546
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,103
like if somebody had a phone and they 
had won the mophie packs so they can 

1547
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:26,510
keep that bitch run and check the 
Internet all day.

1548
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,580
At the end of the day,
what have you.

1549
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,473
Have you.
Have you even taken the time to 

1550
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:32,504
momentarily reflect about what any of 
this means or are you just taking a 

1551
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,610
fucking guy with a truck killed bikers,
you know,

1552
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,010
oh wait,
fuck that guy's guy.

1553
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,053
Oh,
Dustin Hoffman's a piece of shit to 

1554
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:46,363
retweet.
How much time are you spending where 

1555
01:09:49,911 --> 01:09:54,911
you're thinking about life yourself,
the world around you?

1556
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,170
What are the motivations for all this?
Like this kid that ran over these people

1557
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:01,700
in New York,
what's his motivation?

1558
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,713
Who is he?
Who did the most awful job ever of 

1559
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,500
parenting this fucking monster?
Right?

1560
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,373
We think that Allah wants him to stomp 
on the gas and run over a bunch of dark 

1561
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:13,470
[inaudible].

1562
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:14,303
I like,
I was just on that bike path of my son 

1563
01:10:16,641 --> 01:10:17,474
and I just,
I'm trying to stay objective sometimes 

1564
01:10:19,191 --> 01:10:20,240
and I'm like,
Eh.

1565
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:22,220
And I'm like,
fuck you.

1566
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,910
It's like emotions.
Mac Is Peterson talks about how uh,

1567
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,793
the,
the need for information is the same 

1568
01:10:28,401 --> 01:10:29,234
part of the brain for a foraging food 
and now that we have all this food 

1569
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:36,050
reforging other shit,
and I think it's like all think that's a

1570
01:10:36,051 --> 01:10:39,650
really good point and stressed enough 
now that we have all this food,

1571
01:10:39,651 --> 01:10:42,110
we're foraging other shit.
Yeah.

1572
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:42,973
We're forging outrage or forging the 
need for reform or forging this violent 

1573
01:10:48,351 --> 01:10:49,184
interaction between cultures were 
forging all this fucking craziness 

1574
01:10:53,721 --> 01:10:54,554
online.
Like every day you're seeing more and 

1575
01:10:56,661 --> 01:10:57,494
more craziness.
People telling people they can't wear 

1576
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:02,210
braids.
People tell people,

1577
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:03,063
tells you.
Appropriation is the most insane 

1578
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,083
psychotic thing and it's getting worse.
But my twitter timeline think Jamie 

1579
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,440
Kilstein did us all a giant favor.
I'm not being disingenuous.

1580
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:14,250
I think he did

1581
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,020
and I,
and I don't hate that guy.

1582
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:16,890
Look,
I've had,

1583
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:20,340
I've had bad moments by life,
but I've made dumb decisions.

1584
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:21,743
Owning up to those dumb decisions makes 
you a real character like someone of of 

1585
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,433
real character to me.
I want to say I was going to say a real 

1586
01:11:29,071 --> 01:11:31,200
man,
but it applies to women as well.

1587
01:11:31,201 --> 01:11:32,034
Like owning up to those fuck ups is so 
goddamn huge and Jamie did it and I 

1588
01:11:36,661 --> 01:11:40,380
think we need to understand like when 
someone does do something like that,

1589
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:43,800
you gotta,
you gotta stand up and fucking golf clap

1590
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,150
you gotTa,
you gotTa,

1591
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,984
you gotTa,
you gotTa let people know that and 

1592
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:48,543
there's a lot of other people that also 
could have these revelations in these 

1593
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,210
moments that stand up and,
and,

1594
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,530
and be real with you.
And then I,

1595
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,473
all of us would recognize those moments 
and those feelings in our own self and 

1596
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:01,170
we can move on better.

1597
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:05,070
We can move on better than we're doing 
with Jamie did by coming on this podcast

1598
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:05,904
and talking about his life as a social 
justice warrior and all the nuttiness 

1599
01:12:09,361 --> 01:12:11,940
that he was involved in and all the 
rules and regulations,

1600
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:12,803
what you could and couldn't say and how 
he knew it and even though he thought 

1601
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:16,464
things were wrong,
he couldn't express himself because it 

1602
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:22,541
would be outside of the progressive 
doctrine that they had to all follow by.

1603
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,133
That's giant man.
It's trying for all of us because just 

1604
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:26,904
like Jordan Peterson has expressed that 
we could all be Nazis if we were that 

1605
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:32,100
person insurance circumstance with 
those,

1606
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,350
you know,
those stresses and pressures.

1607
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:39,750
That's what terrifies us about all this 
stuff that you could be that person that

1608
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:40,703
if you were born in Uzbekistan or 
wherever the fuck this terrorist was 

1609
01:12:45,091 --> 01:12:47,430
born,
that ran over these people that have all

1610
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:48,990
the terrible things that happened to 
him,

1611
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:49,920
happened to you.

1612
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,770
You could be.
That guy was hitting that gas.

1613
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,770
Right.
There's no difference between you and me

1614
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:56,604
and Jamie and everybody listening.
We're all just people and we're a 

1615
01:12:59,401 --> 01:13:00,234
combination of biology where a 
combination of life experiences and our 

1616
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:04,854
community and our circumstances and what
we've learned that we have to recognize 

1617
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:10,374
that instead of like trying to appear to
have moral superiority over everybody 

1618
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:15,264
above you because you haven't committed 
murder yet or you haven't run a red 

1619
01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:19,884
light,
were wound up killing someone because 

1620
01:13:20,781 --> 01:13:21,614
you had an impulsive desire to get to 
work on time or you haven't got drove 

1621
01:13:25,411 --> 01:13:26,244
home drunk because you've made a mistake
and your girlfriend left the party and 

1622
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:30,804
you were fucking pissed.
You got in your car and you plowed into 

1623
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:35,940
a car.
All those things we want to.

1624
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:39,990
We want to demonize people because we're
scared to death.

1625
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:40,973
Fuck.
Seeing those ideas in ourselves or 

1626
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:43,740
seeing those actions and ourselves.

1627
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:44,603
Yeah,
and that and that soldier that's in 

1628
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:46,224
line.
The line between good and evil is right 

1629
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:50,070
down the middle of a person's heart.
You know,

1630
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:51,293
that we have that.
None of us are just good or bad and we 

1631
01:13:53,671 --> 01:13:54,580
can't,
uh,

1632
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:58,320
just,
just proclaim someone as bad and as good

1633
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:00,240
unfairly.
Those are the people I root against.

1634
01:14:00,241 --> 01:14:01,074
It's not,
it's not the flawed humans that make 

1635
01:14:02,491 --> 01:14:03,324
mistakes and just our human,
it's the people that demonize everyone 

1636
01:14:06,991 --> 01:14:08,880
but damn,
and you see that they're almost just,

1637
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:11,010
it's projecting.
It's like the biggest homophobes the gay

1638
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:11,853
guy,
you know,

1639
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:13,150
and,
and that's,

1640
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:17,800
and that's what gets me angry and it's 
like when you're trying to get social,

1641
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:18,634
like what happened to me with,
with a defined that kid situation where 

1642
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:21,490
it's like,
well,

1643
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,860
explain that because most people don't 
know what you're talking about.

1644
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,750
Most people don't know the 
circumstances.

1645
01:14:25,751 --> 01:14:26,351
So,
so,

1646
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:27,100
uh,
there is this,

1647
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:32,100
this guy who has a three.
He had a three year old boy did,

1648
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,900
he claimed was transgendered and 
identified as a girl and started,

1649
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,440
you know,
putting dresses on the kid and uh,

1650
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:40,563
treating them like a girl and I was 
planning on giving them hormone therapy 

1651
01:14:43,181 --> 01:14:46,570
so they don't go through puberty and 
this dude has like power in Hollywood,

1652
01:14:46,571 --> 01:14:47,640
you know,
and um,

1653
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:51,240
and I just called them out and I,
I got swarmed and uh,

1654
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:54,040
I just didn't stop because I'm like,
I'll die on this hill.

1655
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:55,720
It's a hill to die on.

1656
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:56,763
When you were deciding that a three year
old has done developing and 

1657
01:14:58,991 --> 01:14:59,824
understanding what drives me crazy when 
you were talking to is akin to like a 

1658
01:15:03,071 --> 01:15:06,820
seance will you find out that you were a
roman emperor from 1700,

1659
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:11,020
that fucking three year old barely 
understands how to express himself.

1660
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:11,841
The,
the,

1661
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:16,841
the idea that a three year old can give 
you a complex definition of their sexual

1662
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:19,384
and gender identity had three and that 
this isn't something that you should go 

1663
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:26,940
in and chemically influence that kids 
sterile,

1664
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:28,300
make them a unit.
Yes.

1665
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,240
And it's like,
and it's fucking insane.

1666
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,910
It's a projection of the father's ego.
It's not even like is it?

1667
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,710
Oh yeah.
The virtue say,

1668
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,573
Oh,
it's just a coincidence that it's a San 

1669
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:39,063
Francisco like npr guy that like 
everyone in Hollywood as his back for 

1670
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:43,900
some fucking reason.
Even as a child,

1671
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,250
it's like,
uh,

1672
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,810
it's just the circumstances.

1673
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,673
Explain what,
what.

1674
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:50,390
So this dude,
John Hodgman,

1675
01:15:50,391 --> 01:15:54,400
who I thought I was cool with a,
I met him doing a morning radio show and

1676
01:15:54,401 --> 01:15:56,740
he was like,
when Mel Brooks set a pc,

1677
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:57,574
shits ruining comedy or something.
All these comedians were like going 

1678
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:03,640
against Mel Brooks and I'm like,
wait a minute,

1679
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,550
are we the bad guys now?
What comedians though,

1680
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,920
Paul have comp time Ken was talking 
about.

1681
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:10,480
Yeah.
And I was like,

1682
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:11,314
dude,
you're like the bad guy from footloose 

1683
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:14,890
now.
And uh,

1684
01:16:14,891 --> 01:16:17,020
and so I'm just being very open about 
this because my,

1685
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:18,840
and,
and am I,

1686
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:21,820
it's like there's a few things I'll 
stand behind.

1687
01:16:21,821 --> 01:16:23,440
Free speech.
Don't fuck the kids,

1688
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:25,150
you know,
don't hurt the kids.

1689
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:26,710
Don't hurt the kids.
Like,

1690
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:29,230
yeah,
just be good to the kids.

1691
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:33,000
You know it because that's you.
That's,

1692
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,380
you mean that's what every,
every child is you,

1693
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,580
all of us.

1694
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:37,413
I know.
Especially when you're a little tiny 

1695
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:39,370
person,
you,

1696
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:40,203
you have this insane responsibility as a
big person when you're dealing with a 

1697
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:46,750
little tiny person.
And now that I have a tiny person,

1698
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,740
that's what it made me more of a,
a,

1699
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:50,610
a man in an adult.
Like I,

1700
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:55,060
I just felt so much more responsibility 
to be good 100 percent on the job too.

1701
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,420
He learned on the job like you realize 
along the way like,

1702
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,313
oh,
I'm like literally dealing with a blank 

1703
01:17:01,361 --> 01:17:05,830
slate and I can't even process this,
that my fucking bizarre,

1704
01:17:05,831 --> 01:17:09,860
ridiculous life of telling jokes.
And in your case,

1705
01:17:09,861 --> 01:17:10,694
playing songs with pianos and ridiculous
shit that you say on twitter this 

1706
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:20,170
somehow or another qualifies you to 
raise a human being so intense.

1707
01:17:20,431 --> 01:17:22,100
It's so it.
And also it's like I,

1708
01:17:22,101 --> 01:17:22,920
uh,
I,

1709
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,753
I've always thought I was a good guy but
not like I ever thought I was like 

1710
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,570
deserving of anything special,
you know.

1711
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:31,520
But then once you see a kid,
you're like,

1712
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,820
he didn't.
He's fucking pure steel a man,

1713
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:35,331
you know,
I'm like,

1714
01:17:35,331 --> 01:17:37,400
I've done some shit,
you know?

1715
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:40,130
So that's why I think just as myself 
younger,

1716
01:17:40,131 --> 01:17:40,964
I wouldn't have been quite as like into,
I've always stuck up for the underdog 

1717
01:17:44,571 --> 01:17:47,300
and people being abused and shit.
But now I'm like,

1718
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:48,973
I have to be better for like the next 
generation because I see him look at me 

1719
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:55,220
like humans can be good.
He's like,

1720
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:56,054
Dad,
Dad,

1721
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:57,230
Dad,
dad,

1722
01:17:57,231 --> 01:17:58,064
you know,
and I'm like,

1723
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,920
Holy Fuck that desk a good guy.
You know,

1724
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:02,690
and like I never really knew if I was a 
good guy.

1725
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:03,613
Right.
And this is a good experience between 

1726
01:18:04,341 --> 01:18:05,270
you and him.
He's,

1727
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:08,590
he's enjoying it immensely,
you know,

1728
01:18:08,591 --> 01:18:11,090
and it's giant and it's just like he 
watches me,

1729
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:13,060
watches me hit my foot with my acts and 
as like,

1730
01:18:13,061 --> 01:18:13,894
don't do it.

1731
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,133
Do you ever think about the fact that,
and this is a conflict that I've 

1732
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:19,303
discussed ad nauseum with some of my 
friends at every one of my friends that 

1733
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:23,264
I know came from fucked up place.
All the people that I'm friends with 

1734
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:31,750
Cowan or Joey Diaz or anybody read band 
or dunk into their childhood was fucking

1735
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:33,944
chaos already.
Should fear like everybody's childhood 

1736
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:37,880
was a mess.
Yeah,

1737
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:40,250
I think it's A.
I think it's to make a good comic.

1738
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:41,600
That's still a good dude.
I think it's a,

1739
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:42,703
it's a combo of like love,
like your grandfather and chaos or else 

1740
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,940
we're just.
Killers were.

1741
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,350
That's the problem,
right?

1742
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:55,250
I think that goddamn comedy and murder 
are so closely related.

1743
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:57,240
I know and we're just on the good side.
Killing.

1744
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,083
Yeah.
I mean,

1745
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:59,383
that is literally Wiley call it because 
my mom listened to our last podcast and 

1746
01:19:02,211 --> 01:19:03,980
she was like,
I love that you're friends with Joe,

1747
01:19:03,981 --> 01:19:04,814
like you guys both have like,
you're kind of fucked up a good guys 

1748
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:11,850
where it's like you experienced a 
traumatic events and,

1749
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,820
and have you experienced damage,
you know,

1750
01:19:13,821 --> 01:19:16,280
and then you have paths in life and 
you're like,

1751
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:18,890
I'm going to seek the good in this,
but we're still,

1752
01:19:18,891 --> 01:19:20,750
you know,
low impulse control comedians.

1753
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,310
But still,
you know,

1754
01:19:22,311 --> 01:19:24,240
we're not just killers,
what were,

1755
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:25,910
were actually nice people.
But we're,

1756
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:26,744
we're realizing we're nice people in the
middle of all of like a life with a 

1757
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:32,910
tremendous amount of momentum,
of chaos behind chaos.

1758
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:33,920
And all the sudden you're like,
whoa,

1759
01:19:33,921 --> 01:19:34,520
whoa,
whoa.

1760
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,940
Bracey that.
Okay.

1761
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:36,651
Yeah,
like,

1762
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:37,880
belly,
that beef shit man.

1763
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:38,451
You know,
it's like,

1764
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:39,284
I might as well,
I've had a viking ship for the last 10 

1765
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:43,550
years where he'd just viking it up and 
it's like,

1766
01:19:43,551 --> 01:19:46,130
yeah.
And then you see that the order you need

1767
01:19:46,131 --> 01:19:47,240
the cast in order,
you know,

1768
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,074
and you see the order with the child and
then you see these people trying to 

1769
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:53,270
exploit children.
And I was just awake,

1770
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,290
you know,
I'm just like,

1771
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,431
you know what?
Fuck you.

1772
01:19:55,431 --> 01:19:56,264
I'm like I don't.
And then people in La that I thought 

1773
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:00,590
were my friends,
not good friends,

1774
01:20:00,591 --> 01:20:02,960
not like comics,
but like middle management.

1775
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:04,940
That's where the evil is.
Well you know what it is man.

1776
01:20:04,941 --> 01:20:07,130
It's like the supporting

1777
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,053
rights eclipses all the logic involved 
in the subtle nuances of human behavior 

1778
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:18,750
and sexuality and the idea that a three 
year old could have any,

1779
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:19,873
any notion of like what it's going to be
like to be eight or what it's going to 

1780
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:24,114
be like to be 16 or whether or not 
hormonal changes is going to affect the 

1781
01:20:28,201 --> 01:20:29,470
way he expresses himself.
So.

1782
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:32,940
And also you're looking at this kid and 
you're deciding that this kid,

1783
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:33,803
because there three is going to be 
transgender and you want to turn them 

1784
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:37,044
into a girl.
What if this kid decides he's a gay man 

1785
01:20:38,911 --> 01:20:41,000
in five years to kill themselves?
Right,

1786
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:41,641
what it.
Well,

1787
01:20:41,641 --> 01:20:45,390
what if they decide that they're 
bisexual in 20 years,

1788
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:46,423
you know,
I can't.

1789
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,900
If you kill,
if you care about that child,

1790
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,093
you don't interfere with that process 
because I'm not the same thing that I 

1791
01:20:52,921 --> 01:20:54,720
was when I was three and you're not 
either.

1792
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:55,723
It is so to inject hormones and 
chemicals and even surgery that we 

1793
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:00,894
really have a very limited understanding
about how much this interaction between 

1794
01:21:03,991 --> 01:21:08,560
the scalpel and a baby body.
How much of an impact that has you.

1795
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:09,453
You're giving someone the green light is
that they're talking about making this 

1796
01:21:12,271 --> 01:21:13,500
kid a unit.
Well,

1797
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:14,334
yeah,
they won't go through puberty and so 

1798
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:17,070
then it's like they saying,
what are they saying?

1799
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:20,340
They were called the hormone blockers 
and I kept asking him directly.

1800
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:21,630
I'm like,
say yes or no.

1801
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:23,670
Are you going to give them hormone 
blockers because it's fine.

1802
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:26,880
If he wants to wear a dress,
have some fun playtime fine,

1803
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:28,860
but you're going to tell him he's a 
girl,

1804
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,440
but here's the thing.
It's not even playtime.

1805
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:31,283
It's like,
what if the kid like feels better when 

1806
01:21:33,571 --> 01:21:34,890
he wears a dress?
Fine.

1807
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:38,640
Like we're all.
We've all decided that pants and a shirt

1808
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,830
is the way to go and if you don't wear 
pants and a shirt,

1809
01:21:40,831 --> 01:21:41,420
I know you're home.

1810
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:46,420
I'll like if you were sitting there 
wearing a big girl skirt,

1811
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,930
why did I.
What do I give a fuck?

1812
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:51,240
If you always learned kilt and I'm like,
ah,

1813
01:21:51,241 --> 01:21:53,490
I love Scotland.
I wouldn't care.

1814
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:55,800
But if you my brothers to piss out of 
each other.

1815
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,910
Well,
she said that out loud.

1816
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,710
I have a horse thing.
Impulse gave Doug Stanhope pissed on the

1817
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,920
fear last week,
a couple of days ago on a podcast.

1818
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:06,150
That's awesome.
Yeah,

1819
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,130
pissing happens.
I didn't mean to cut you off.

1820
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,710
You were talking about the Scottish.
Who gives a shit.

1821
01:22:10,711 --> 01:22:14,340
If you dress like a girl,
what I give a shit as if you step in and

1822
01:22:14,341 --> 01:22:17,970
you in any way interfere with the 
physical,

1823
01:22:17,971 --> 01:22:18,804
sexual,
biological development of a child 

1824
01:22:21,511 --> 01:22:22,344
because you think it's the right thing 
to do progressively that you think is 

1825
01:22:24,811 --> 01:22:26,520
the right way,
right thing to do.

1826
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:31,640
The right way to approach a fucking 
three year old like you are the problem.

1827
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:33,713
There's not this.
We're not talking about one plus one 

1828
01:22:35,221 --> 01:22:38,010
equals two.
We're talking about a super complex,

1829
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:43,080
very nuanced issue and if there's child 
decides when it's x amount years old,

1830
01:22:43,081 --> 01:22:43,914
whatever we decide 30,
whatever the fuck we decide to take the 

1831
01:22:46,231 --> 01:22:49,440
decision to do to get gender 
reassignment,

1832
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,680
that's a 100 percent cool with me 
chorus.

1833
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:52,643
No problem with that,
but that's a person who understands who 

1834
01:22:55,291 --> 01:23:00,291
they are as a fully developed organism,
not off fucking babies.

1835
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,433
Three.
That's a baby dude and part of me it's 

1836
01:23:03,991 --> 01:23:05,950
like this.
I see myself in the,

1837
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:06,823
in the kid where I'm like,
I played classical piano and knitted 

1838
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,060
like I used to like knit cloth.
I used to weave,

1839
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:13,923
I went down,
I used to the thing we your piano 

1840
01:23:16,061 --> 01:23:16,671
teacher?
Yeah.

1841
01:23:16,671 --> 01:23:17,504
Yeah.
Like my.

1842
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:21,100
Like my dad is like a.
my parents are married that have a great

1843
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:21,934
marriage,
but it's like almost like a reverse 

1844
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:23,464
gender marriage in a way.
Or my dad's like a flamboyant opera 

1845
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:27,520
singer,
professor and my mom like six.

1846
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:29,070
One loves sports,
wear sweatpants,

1847
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:31,450
you know,
like my first bit was I was the only guy

1848
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:34,660
in the closet.
I used to be like,

1849
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:36,580
my dad would be like,
let's go see rent again,

1850
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:37,330
son.
And I'm like,

1851
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:39,460
I want to play catch with mom,
you know.

1852
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,640
So I played piano since I was a kid.
I,

1853
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:44,290
uh.
What about your piano teacher?

1854
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:45,163
When I was 11,
my piano teacher became a dude and the 

1855
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,390
bit I tried to work on that,
people don't believe some of the best of

1856
01:23:51,391 --> 01:23:52,840
the way.
That's a long time ago.

1857
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,980
How old are you now?
Oh,

1858
01:23:53,981 --> 01:23:55,360
I'm 37,000.
Ninety one.

1859
01:23:55,361 --> 01:23:56,260
That was the.
Oh Gee shit.

1860
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:57,620
Oh,
that's,

1861
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,260
Oh,
gi surgery.

1862
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,113
Oh,
that's.

1863
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,560
And do my piano teacher right now is 
like owens,

1864
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,990
totally trans friendly.
Like we're friends.

1865
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:07,840
But I don't think he realizes what's it 
become,

1866
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,510
you know,
because it's like now it's like,

1867
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:12,010
oh,
you don't believe in making a three year

1868
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:13,690
old a year full of Hay.

1869
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:14,833
Yeah.
This is,

1870
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:18,870
this is not wise because if you just 
look at it in,

1871
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:21,650
not in terms of like how a child should 
identify,

1872
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:25,550
but in terms of like the biological 
process of a developing human being,

1873
01:24:25,551 --> 01:24:27,320
it's very,
very touch and go.

1874
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:30,230
We don't really understand what it is.
This is what you should try to do,

1875
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:31,064
what a kid,
you just try to give them nutrients you 

1876
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:33,713
should try to give them love and try to 
give them safety and try to give them 

1877
01:24:36,711 --> 01:24:39,050
challenges.
Totally tends to get over,

1878
01:24:39,051 --> 01:24:39,884
but.
But the idea that you are going to 

1879
01:24:40,941 --> 01:24:45,941
decide by your conversation with someone
who just started talking 12 months ago,

1880
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:48,410
they're still shitting themselves.
They don't know how to talk yet.

1881
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,273
They shit in their pants,
but they literally don't know how to 

1882
01:24:51,051 --> 01:24:51,880
talk yet.

1883
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,650
I know it's.
I identify.

1884
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:55,070
It's like,
how the fuck does that work?

1885
01:24:55,071 --> 01:24:58,120
Do you want to be a girl?
Like my son's dances,

1886
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:00,160
like he's always dancing and shit.
He goes to the piano.

1887
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:00,994
He does with dad.
That does and it's like this kid's 

1888
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:06,190
probably trying to impress his dad and 
his dad's this fucking asshole.

1889
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:07,281
It's like,
oh,

1890
01:25:07,281 --> 01:25:08,114
being trans is brave dad.
And then they're gonna make they're 

1891
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:12,820
gonna make moves where the kid can't go 
back,

1892
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:14,730
can't go back.
It's life is over you.

1893
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,520
You literally turned.

1894
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:20,580
I live down a dark path because here's 
the thing,

1895
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:24,780
and this is super unpopular to say,
but the bottom line,

1896
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:27,420
whether you decide to become a 
transgender person,

1897
01:25:27,421 --> 01:25:29,410
whether you decide to,
you know,

1898
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,473
just to suppress those ideas,
it is at this current stage of our 

1899
01:25:34,861 --> 01:25:35,694
understanding of medical science.
Impossible to actually turn you into a 

1900
01:25:38,101 --> 01:25:39,600
warm,
of course six x,

1901
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:40,434
y,
so we're going to do is have some 

1902
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:47,931
reasonable facsimile and it's going to 
be more reasonable in different people.

1903
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,700
And some people they have a slender 
frame,

1904
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:51,723
you know,
some people have built like David tour 

1905
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:54,780
and it's just like,
whoa girl,

1906
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:55,683
okay,
I gotta go like you don't have David 

1907
01:25:57,721 --> 01:26:00,480
[inaudible] was big time heavyweight 
boxer from the nineties

1908
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,393
and you've touched on our body 
dysmorphia with like weight lifters 

1909
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:04,483
where it's like,

1910
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:05,323
you know,
there's certain people that just aren't 

1911
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:08,000
comfortable in their own skin and want 
to alter it.

1912
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:08,863
Like with like fucking rather that's 
bigger boobs or cutting your wiener off 

1913
01:26:10,991 --> 01:26:12,170
or some shit.
And,

1914
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,830
and as a very big personal liberty guy,
I'm all about you doing that.

1915
01:26:15,831 --> 01:26:17,540
But you don't make that decision for the
kids.

1916
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:21,530
You don't make the decision for anyone 
that's under the age of comprehension.

1917
01:26:21,531 --> 01:26:23,510
And here's the thing,
like what is that age?

1918
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:27,390
Because they say that the frontal lobe 
doesn't really fully developed until 25.

1919
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:28,910
Asked Geico.
Yeah.

1920
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,550
Yeah.
They don't show you.

1921
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:32,360
Yeah.
They want to insure you as a male.

1922
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:36,030
The insurance is up until you're 25 
because you're not developing a uh,

1923
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,540
I think it's a little earlier.
I think girls develop little earlier.

1924
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:41,000
I now I.
Now I'm fucking pissed.

1925
01:26:41,001 --> 01:26:43,430
I'm calling some sort of red pill 
organization.

1926
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:44,293
And so long story short,
I make these problematic statements and 

1927
01:26:46,191 --> 01:26:47,600
then my agent drops me.

1928
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:49,063
And uh,
how does your agent drop you for saying 

1929
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:54,880
a three year old shouldn't be given 
chemicals that kill his Dick and balls.

1930
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:56,180
That was rocking the boat,
man.

1931
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:57,890
It's a fucking match if you just put it 
that way.

1932
01:26:57,891 --> 01:27:02,891
So what you are is pro giving kids dick 
killing chemicals.

1933
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,700
Is that what you are?
Just let me know.

1934
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:05,593
Right?
It's kind of like when it's like words 

1935
01:27:06,501 --> 01:27:08,600
are violence.
You hold up your fist and you go word or

1936
01:27:08,601 --> 01:27:10,910
violence like that.
It immediately cuts through this shit,

1937
01:27:10,911 --> 01:27:14,150
but for some reason it's not these days.
Or is there violence?

1938
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:15,710
I mean,
that's a big thing now.

1939
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,371
And it's like,
ah,

1940
01:27:16,371 --> 01:27:17,560
this college,
Yukon,

1941
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,090
drop me,
I'd have like a good gig.

1942
01:27:20,091 --> 01:27:21,770
And they said,
because your views,

1943
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:23,060
uh,
uh,

1944
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:24,530
we can't,
you can't work here.

1945
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:26,660
And then did they specifically talk 
about which views?

1946
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:27,494
Yeah,
I even tweeted the email because I was 

1947
01:27:28,551 --> 01:27:30,980
sick of this shit man views that trans 
kids.

1948
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:32,780
It's only transplants.
That's my whole thing.

1949
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,720
But it's trans babies,
dude.

1950
01:27:35,721 --> 01:27:36,950
It's taught,
they're toddlers.

1951
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:38,540
They're like three,
dude,

1952
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:40,960
it's,
and I'll die in the hillman.

1953
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:43,380
I even asked my brother,
I like my buddy,

1954
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,850
my buddy Mike.
Uh,

1955
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:46,450
Mike,
Mike from a,

1956
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:48,470
a sword and scale.
Like,

1957
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,580
dude,
I literally was like,

1958
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:51,410
I'm,
I'm unemployed.

1959
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:53,080
And he had me like read,
uh,

1960
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,950
that,
that's when you know,

1961
01:27:54,951 --> 01:27:56,120
your friends are mad.
He's like,

1962
01:27:56,121 --> 01:27:56,871
Yo,
will you read this?

1963
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:59,170
You can be like a da in this fucking 
murder podcast.

1964
01:27:59,190 --> 01:27:59,900
I was like,
great.

1965
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,300
He's like arthritis from cash.
I thought I was out.

1966
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,620
I'm like,
brother,

1967
01:28:03,621 --> 01:28:05,860
can I do some more?
Tree work is like $29,

1968
01:28:05,861 --> 01:28:06,651
you got boots.
I'm like,

1969
01:28:06,651 --> 01:28:08,810
fuck yeah dude.
I was prepared man.

1970
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:09,673
But think about that,
that you as a guy who I've known for a 

1971
01:28:12,111 --> 01:28:12,944
long time,
it's been a successful professional 

1972
01:28:14,061 --> 01:28:14,894
comedian or really always that close to 
being pushed aside and not given work 

1973
01:28:19,911 --> 01:28:22,310
anymore over something that's totally 
logical.

1974
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,390
I just got a development deal,
true TV and shit.

1975
01:28:26,391 --> 01:28:28,500
It's not even like I was doing badly.
Did they?

1976
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:32,300
The True TV keep the development deal.
They did not even have reps anymore.

1977
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,930
But do you talk to Tru TV?
No,

1978
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,200
they're cool people.
I just had,

1979
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:38,590
I've just been so,
like,

1980
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:42,680
so the reps all bend you by saying that 
you don't think three year olds?

1981
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:43,110
Well,
yeah.

1982
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,390
And trannies.
Yeah.

1983
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:46,690
And also I guess I was,
I was saying it's a process.

1984
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:48,720
It was problematic.
I was uh,

1985
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:49,813
I was,
I was uh,

1986
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:50,953
too many,
too much.

1987
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,793
I was just,
I was poking people that aren't allowed 

1988
01:28:52,881 --> 01:28:55,340
to be poked at this,
these powerful middle managers,

1989
01:28:55,341 --> 01:28:56,690
you know,
what were you doing?

1990
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,480
Just saying you're wrong dude.
When they're like,

1991
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:00,650
oh,
you poking them about what?

1992
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,770
That shit like that's good.
Are we at Man,

1993
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,190
can't do that shit.

1994
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:06,683
I don't do he tweets man.
And then the Shaun King Shit where I'm 

1995
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:11,490
like making a joke that I think it'd be 
hilarious of slavery.

1996
01:29:11,491 --> 01:29:15,300
Came back because he'd have to admit 
he's white and that's fucking funny man.

1997
01:29:15,301 --> 01:29:17,610
I'm not going to back down on humor.
I'm just not.

1998
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:19,350
And then he calls me a white 
supremacist.

1999
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:22,320
Actual people with like blue check marks
are like,

2000
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,810
I never knew you are racist.
I'm like,

2001
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,340
you know,
I'm not man,

2002
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:28,320
you know,
it's a joke about him lying about who he

2003
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:29,154
is and uh,
and I'm not going to explain to people 

2004
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:32,514
who he is and what that whole story is 
because I don't know whether it's true 

2005
01:29:34,471 --> 01:29:35,304
or not,
but I know what I've seen online and I 

2006
01:29:36,961 --> 01:29:41,370
know what a lot of Milo exposed but 
files Rachel dolezal right now.

2007
01:29:41,371 --> 01:29:44,340
I'd be fucking pissed dude.
And it's like,

2008
01:29:44,341 --> 01:29:47,750
even if I'm wrong,
let's say he is a black guy with like,

2009
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:49,830
well even if he is,
let's be honest,

2010
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,040
like I'm not,
I'm not Irish,

2011
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,840
but I'm a quarter Irish.

2012
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:56,370
Right?
But if you look at me,

2013
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:58,830
I look like a Guinea look like an 
Italian.

2014
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,013
You know why?
Because I'm three quarters Irish or 

2015
01:30:02,011 --> 01:30:03,270
three quarters Italian.
So fight.

2016
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:04,680
If someone says,
are you Irish?

2017
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:08,130
If I was going on TV,
identifying as Irish man,

2018
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:12,920
right?
What people are infinitely more part.

2019
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,970
How much are Irish?
Are you?

2020
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:18,150
I mean people would say that's 
disingenuous because no one can tell,

2021
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:22,290
nor does anyone care about the 
distinction between Irish and Italian.

2022
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,120
You would just a European,
hey,

2023
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:25,470
you are in America.
You know,

2024
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,060
third generation,
no big deal.

2025
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:28,313
But there's a reality to that because 
like what percentage black do you have 

2026
01:30:31,861 --> 01:30:33,300
to be where you say,
I'm a black man?

2027
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:34,770
Well,
because he wants the points.

2028
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,570
That's why it's not even about pride.
And you don't.

2029
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:38,431
You will,
will,

2030
01:30:38,431 --> 01:30:38,761
will,
will,

2031
01:30:38,761 --> 01:30:39,330
will.
Here we go.

2032
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:43,620
You don't want is this shit right there?
You don't choose to be trans black.

2033
01:30:43,621 --> 01:30:45,360
It chooses you.
This is my life.

2034
01:30:45,361 --> 01:30:48,090
My struggle is real.
Hashtag wrong skin.

2035
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,410
Yeah.
Is that real?

2036
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,760
That's real.
That's real.

2037
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,430
That is essentially it talks about all 
the time.

2038
01:30:56,431 --> 01:30:59,170
Real tweet from Owen's thing that I was 
looking,

2039
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,093
okay,
we did some shit that I've been tricked 

2040
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:05,070
about so I could create that.
It was a guy,

2041
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:09,780
there was a guy that I was following for
a while that had a parody account and he

2042
01:31:09,781 --> 01:31:10,614
was going by Hashtag wrong skin.
He was a comedian and he was always 

2043
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:17,040
talking about himself as being trans 
racial,

2044
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:21,170
but he was doing it like completely 
preposterous and he would be like,

2045
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:22,023
you take like the ultra progressive 
really ridiculous approach to like 

2046
01:31:24,961 --> 01:31:28,680
almost every argument and then always 
write like Hashtag wrong skin.

2047
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:30,960
Hilarious.
Because it all started because that dude

2048
01:31:30,961 --> 01:31:31,794
poked at me because I had this bit that 
I want to be a progressive slave owner 

2049
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,820
where I'm like,
I'm like,

2050
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:38,610
the reason slavery is wrong is because 
it's only black people.

2051
01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:40,020
That's not right.
That's racism.

2052
01:31:40,021 --> 01:31:41,340
I want all the people.
And I'm like,

2053
01:31:41,341 --> 01:31:43,140
if you can't outrun the nuts in the 
harpoons.

2054
01:31:43,141 --> 01:31:43,974
Yeah,
welcome to the club and that's a joke 

2055
01:31:45,271 --> 01:31:48,870
about the absurdity of certain 
progressive ideals.

2056
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:51,420
And then he poked at me somehow and then
I was like,

2057
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:53,610
this guy's fucking.
Well,

2058
01:31:53,611 --> 01:31:56,490
if I can be really honest about that,
I saw fit and I was like,

2059
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:58,140
hmm,
I see your point,

2060
01:31:58,141 --> 01:32:00,400
but I think that's like first draft

2061
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:01,743
of an idea of like,
because I bailed on the joke because it 

2062
01:32:05,171 --> 01:32:06,850
doesn't,
it only works in certain cities,

2063
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,550
but this is why.
I mean this is how I felt.

2064
01:32:09,551 --> 01:32:10,384
I'm like,
okay,

2065
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,433
no,
because I don't want anybody to be 

2066
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:13,414
slaves.
Like so like the joke is like it's kind 

2067
01:32:15,251 --> 01:32:16,084
of cruel in a way.
Like we're not talking about real 

2068
01:32:19,361 --> 01:32:20,210
people.
Of course,

2069
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:23,440
the sentiment behind it is people who 
run slow.

2070
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:25,680
Anybody who can't get away,
she'd be a slave.

2071
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:26,910
No,
no read,

2072
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:27,813
but you don't really feel that way.
You're saying that because you want to 

2073
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:32,350
poke people.
Well,

2074
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:34,690
it was extremely.
It was honestly,

2075
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,150
of course,
I don't want any slaves.

2076
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:39,640
Of course.
It was always the upside down,

2077
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:41,370
upside down.
Satire.

2078
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:42,330
Weird.
Because that was.

2079
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:45,970
I was.
I know that it wasn't right.

2080
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:48,100
It wasn't quite there.
It was like you,

2081
01:32:48,101 --> 01:32:50,830
you were in the neighborhood,
but that's what our job is.

2082
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,690
Yes.
That's the whole thing.

2083
01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:56,470
It's like everyone thinks that you can,
you start knowing the bit,

2084
01:32:56,890 --> 01:32:57,723
you know,
uh,

2085
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:58,713
freedom of speech is all about way 
overshooting then pulling back then 

2086
01:33:01,181 --> 01:33:02,014
fine,
you know,

2087
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:04,140
and I was overshooting like that's what 
I do.

2088
01:33:04,141 --> 01:33:09,040
Why don't they laugh where it's like,
look at how this one phrase hurts people

2089
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:12,280
and then how you make it not hurt people
based on information I didn't previously

2090
01:33:12,281 --> 01:33:13,140
know.
Yeah.

2091
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,140
You know,
and it's like,

2092
01:33:14,141 --> 01:33:16,980
I'm like,
my wife gave me info about.

2093
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:17,823
I was doing some bit about how vampires 
or cultural appropriation for Romanians 

2094
01:33:20,981 --> 01:33:24,640
and I don't even understand what the 
point was,

2095
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:26,320
but it's something to do with Harry 
Mexicans,

2096
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:28,270
women.
What is this?

2097
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:30,550
W Jamie woody.
You trying to find it?

2098
01:33:30,551 --> 01:33:31,384
He was one in looking for it.
He apparently had hit it or deleted 

2099
01:33:35,171 --> 01:33:36,004
those tweets.
Now Shaun King is cranking out a 

2100
01:33:38,651 --> 01:33:39,484
boatload of original tweets in a 
continued effort to dilute last week's 

2101
01:33:43,271 --> 01:33:44,104
Hashtag,
trans black and Hashtag wrong skin 

2102
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:46,954
tweets.

2103
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:47,943
Oh,
so you got a bad response to the know 

2104
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:54,670
tweeting about that whole thing for 
weeks and going on into 2016 and a bunch

2105
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:54,971
of.
You know,

2106
01:33:54,971 --> 01:33:56,860
I don't give a fuck man,
if you want to,

2107
01:33:57,170 --> 01:33:58,003
I feel the same,
literally the same way as you feeling 

2108
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:04,870
that you are a woman or you feeling 
anything,

2109
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:05,763
anything,
but the real problem is like the 

2110
01:34:07,631 --> 01:34:12,631
insisting on that definition in a very 
specific manner that's disingenuous with

2111
01:34:14,141 --> 01:34:18,610
your actual background because everyone 
is essentially.

2112
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:20,313
We all came from Africa.
That was the original human beings and 

2113
01:34:23,621 --> 01:34:24,454
like we said before,
being white is solar panels for vitamin 

2114
01:34:27,671 --> 01:34:28,870
D.
that's all it is.

2115
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:30,003
It's.
We moved to a place that had a lot of 

2116
01:34:30,851 --> 01:34:31,684
clouds and it wasn't anything like 
Africa and slowly over who knows how 

2117
01:34:34,421 --> 01:34:38,920
many fucking years people changed and 
you develop paler and Paler skin.

2118
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,140
That's it.
Yeah,

2119
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:42,040
so it doesn't matter.
I don't care,

2120
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:44,590
but just here's,
here's a better way to do it.

2121
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:45,783
Just act the way you feel like you'd 
like to act and don't lie about what 

2122
01:34:50,471 --> 01:34:51,580
your background is.
Totally.

2123
01:34:51,581 --> 01:34:54,070
And you can be the exact same person.
No one will give a fuck.

2124
01:34:54,071 --> 01:34:58,040
And the irony is he's trying to get 
victim status when he's

2125
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,873
not part of a group and because there is
the reason American slavery is so 

2126
01:35:01,521 --> 01:35:02,354
fucking dark is because it was one of 
the only slave systems based on one 

2127
01:35:06,171 --> 01:35:07,004
race.
And that's why like Carlin did an 

2128
01:35:08,541 --> 01:35:09,374
unbelievable.
Everything's car like dude Carlin's 

2129
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:13,010
covered it.
He has a blitz episode called,

2130
01:35:13,011 --> 01:35:14,280
uh,
addicted to bondage.

2131
01:35:14,281 --> 01:35:15,200
Dan Carlin.
Yeah.

2132
01:35:15,201 --> 01:35:18,350
Dan devcon covered a lot of thought.
You were talking about it did.

2133
01:35:18,351 --> 01:35:22,550
I got some of the wolf in May,
but like Dan Carlin addicted to bondage.

2134
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:24,760
We're all related to slaves and slave 
owners.

2135
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:25,461
It's like,
it was,

2136
01:35:25,461 --> 01:35:28,130
it was actually progressive because of 
genocide.

2137
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:29,413
That's the irony.
It's like back in the day and army 

2138
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:32,060
winds,
they kill everyone.

2139
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,980
And then some Bernie Sanders guy was 
like,

2140
01:35:33,981 --> 01:35:35,690
let's keep something alive.
And I was like,

2141
01:35:35,691 --> 01:35:37,570
you're such a fucking lefty,
you know.

2142
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,040
And uh,
and so we grew out of that.

2143
01:35:40,041 --> 01:35:40,760
Thank God.

2144
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,920
Of course I don't like slavery.
I think I'm,

2145
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:43,813
I'm almost in this position where like,
I'm a little freaked out that some 

2146
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:49,700
givens aren't given any more.
Like what?

2147
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:52,820
Like like that Hitler is bad or I don't 
like slavery where I'm like,

2148
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,650
it's just a given.
It's a given.

2149
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:56,900
Like who the fuck?
Like slavery.

2150
01:35:56,901 --> 01:35:57,734
It's like owning a human.
There's still a bunch of retards out 

2151
01:35:59,661 --> 01:36:02,030
there that think it's a good idea to be 
a white nationalist.

2152
01:36:02,031 --> 01:36:02,940
Right?
Yeah.

2153
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,353
Like Charlottesville,
like when you see that guy got pepper 

2154
01:36:05,841 --> 01:36:06,860
sprayed,
takes his shirt off,

2155
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:09,050
you see a swastika on his chest like,
okay,

2156
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:10,093
what about the Nazis is awesome to you?
Is it just fucking gassing random 

2157
01:36:14,211 --> 01:36:15,044
children?
Like,

2158
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,690
sit down,
tell me what do you think is awesome?

2159
01:36:17,691 --> 01:36:18,524
A bad war plan and Russia,
the idea that are you so fucking stupid 

2160
01:36:21,711 --> 01:36:22,544
that you really think the only people of
Merit have a genetics that come from a 

2161
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:27,080
certain patch of dirt?

2162
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:31,550
Because that was one of the.
That's one of the most toxic ideas.

2163
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:34,040
So toxic man share and it,
it's,

2164
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:37,760
it's toxic in the same way that some of 
the left shit is toxic too and they both

2165
01:36:37,761 --> 01:36:41,360
have this toxic element where like 
unless you look at merit and character,

2166
01:36:41,361 --> 01:36:43,220
you're fucked.
Like if you're like,

2167
01:36:43,221 --> 01:36:44,054
I'm rather or not,
you think white people are special and 

2168
01:36:46,641 --> 01:36:48,890
then you should keep them down or boost 
them up.

2169
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:49,783
It's both toxic.
I think like when it comes to Rachel 

2170
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:53,503
Dolezal like her,
her problem is not that she wants to be 

2171
01:36:56,211 --> 01:36:57,044
black and she's not.
Her problem is that people give a fuck 

2172
01:36:59,901 --> 01:37:03,170
about what she wants.
She just didn't have that land.

2173
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:07,460
It just didn't like.
Imagine her whole world could be exactly

2174
01:37:07,461 --> 01:37:11,030
the same.
The way she behaves could be exactly the

2175
01:37:11,031 --> 01:37:13,550
same.
The way she dresses her actions,

2176
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,413
everything.
If she didn't utter a few words that 

2177
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:19,130
like I'm actually black and people like,
wait what?

2178
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:21,230
Like,
and then they go into her history.

2179
01:37:21,231 --> 01:37:21,381
No,
no,

2180
01:37:21,381 --> 01:37:21,570
no,
no,

2181
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:22,403
no,
you,

2182
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:25,460
you want it to be black but you weren't 
black.

2183
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:27,510
You look right.

2184
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,040
And that just quick,
quick,

2185
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:32,000
quick.
It's just eyeballs.

2186
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:32,863
Shaun king,
I mean he was a part of black lives 

2187
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:35,750
matter obviously.
He wanted to do good.

2188
01:37:35,751 --> 01:37:39,740
Obviously he wanted to spread good ideas
and help people.

2189
01:37:39,741 --> 01:37:41,510
The people that he really identified 
with,

2190
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:45,530
if those tweets are real and I don't 
know if they are Hashtag [inaudible] and

2191
01:37:45,531 --> 01:37:48,920
Hashtag trans racial and all that stuff,
then that's literally how he felt.

2192
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:51,020
He didn't feel it because he hated those
people.

2193
01:37:51,021 --> 01:37:51,854
He felt because he identified with them 
and they're more attractive to him than 

2194
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:54,923
than what he actually was.
So if he just Paul Walden and never 

2195
01:37:59,881 --> 01:38:00,930
said,
I mean Paul Wall,

2196
01:38:00,931 --> 01:38:02,430
right?
The wrapper with the grill.

2197
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:03,473
I mean,
isn't that essentially he's a deep love 

2198
01:38:06,091 --> 01:38:08,370
of black American culture,
right?

2199
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:12,510
Mean there's a lot of people that just 
just be themselves and go in.

2200
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:14,340
Just go in is what I appreciate more.

2201
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:18,120
There's a lot of black people at golf 
clubs with fucking Polo shirts on.

2202
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:19,350
Right?
Why?

2203
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:21,810
Because they identify with that culture.
It's appealing to them.

2204
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:24,460
We'll just let people,
fucking cultures,

2205
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,580
everything man.
That people.

2206
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:29,520
And the irony is is Joey Diaz,
he's going to get us grills.

2207
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:30,773
You heard about that.
And the irony is is like inner city 

2208
01:38:32,881 --> 01:38:33,714
black culture,
like things like comes to my shows and 

2209
01:38:35,551 --> 01:38:38,490
thinks I'm funny because they liked that
crazy shit.

2210
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:40,290
Like man,
you fucking funny,

2211
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:43,110
you free to talk about things.
They just think it's funny.

2212
01:38:43,111 --> 01:38:44,100
I,
I think uh,

2213
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:46,580
when I say they,
it's annoying because it's like,

2214
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,810
of course not all black people finding 
funny,

2215
01:38:48,811 --> 01:38:51,740
but like that culture,
that black redneck white liberal culture

2216
01:38:51,741 --> 01:38:56,240
where it's like I'm from a culture 
that's more similar to American southern

2217
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:57,083
or urban black culture than a lot of the
liberals calling me names and it's just 

2218
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:03,120
this type of culture that,
that bonds through shit talking,

2219
01:39:03,121 --> 01:39:05,490
you know,
like Boston where it's like if you talk,

2220
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:06,361
if someone's like,
oh,

2221
01:39:06,361 --> 01:39:08,210
you're dead,
you're dead x like a home.

2222
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:08,680
I'm like,
well,

2223
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,350
is my dad's didn't kill himself,
you know?

2224
01:39:10,351 --> 01:39:11,184
And then your friends because it's like 
you've hit the darkest shit and then 

2225
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:14,611
you're like,
oh,

2226
01:39:14,611 --> 01:39:15,444
we'll make it through a winter.
A winter is a big thing to make it 

2227
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:21,180
through.
The people in the west coast have like a

2228
01:39:21,181 --> 01:39:22,014
way easier,
like the idea of what the possibilities 

2229
01:39:25,591 --> 01:39:27,290
are.
Then the people that the,

2230
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,253
the east coast people in the East Coast 
are regularly confronted with potential 

2231
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:34,050
death if they're dressed wrong.
Dude,

2232
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:36,590
I live in the adirondack mountains man.
It's like dude.

2233
01:39:36,591 --> 01:39:39,420
And that's like class.
Class doesn't exist in my town.

2234
01:39:39,421 --> 01:39:41,280
It's you got to fucking shovel.
Yeah.

2235
01:39:41,281 --> 01:39:42,114
What time?
Like what time of the year does he get 

2236
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:48,100
to where you could die outside timber.
July.

2237
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:53,160
Like by December,
January.

2238
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:54,850
We hit negative 40.
Yeah,

2239
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:55,883
no minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit,
which is exactly the same as 40 degrees 

2240
01:40:00,781 --> 01:40:01,614
Celsius.

2241
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,980
That's where it comes to its clients and
its,

2242
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:04,973
that's where they embrace.
And do we have this tiny town in like w 

2243
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:08,610
what do they do?
They get mad.

2244
01:40:08,611 --> 01:40:10,540
No,
we build ice palaces and shit.

2245
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:16,080
Do they stock up on firewood in July and
August and September and there's none of

2246
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:17,430
this pc shit.
It's like,

2247
01:40:17,431 --> 01:40:18,264
except for one issue I got a little piss
in my town about because like this year 

2248
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:23,970
the winter carnival was going to be a 
fiesta themed about Hispanics,

2249
01:40:23,971 --> 01:40:26,370
but there's like the only Hispanics are 
my wife and child,

2250
01:40:26,371 --> 01:40:29,070
you know?
And then they're like,

2251
01:40:29,071 --> 01:40:30,850
oh no,
we don't want to like be bitch.

2252
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:31,823
Right.
I'm like,

2253
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,810
it's not.
Do you know,

2254
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:36,420
I'm like,
we could do a lumberjack theme.

2255
01:40:36,421 --> 01:40:37,890
You fucking idiots,
right?

2256
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,550
Exactly.
There's no one vikings me.

2257
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,980
You could show on Vikings all day long.
All Day long.

2258
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:46,250
Nobody cares.
Big fucking helmet.

2259
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:47,193
You big horns.
Nobody took calls you a cultural 

2260
01:40:50,221 --> 01:40:53,940
appropriate or if you were like Viking 
garb or like a

2261
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,530
st patty's Day.
It's a midget looking for a rainbow.

2262
01:40:56,531 --> 01:40:57,950
Trying to get gold.
Yeah.

2263
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,440
No,
trying to fight everybody.

2264
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:01,660
You can wear green all day on St 
Patrick's Day.

2265
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:02,673
What else?

2266
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:05,810
What will this will this umbrella for 
me,

2267
01:41:05,811 --> 01:41:10,050
it's like he's got an nfl tattoo on his 
bicep.

2268
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:12,000
That guy's pretty intense.
Lose that guy.

2269
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:14,970
My new shadow.
Someone would say,

2270
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:16,830
oh,
it was a fan guys.

2271
01:41:16,831 --> 01:41:19,980
Jacked guys do it right.
Too fanatical.

2272
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:22,890
He works out all year just for that 
fucking scene.

2273
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:24,840
Yeah.
You can be a Minnesota Viking and nobody

2274
01:41:24,841 --> 01:41:26,760
gives a shit,
but the Cleveland Indians,

2275
01:41:26,761 --> 01:41:29,310
everybody's like,
this is the end of civilization.

2276
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,620
I know in Vikings were like worse than 
Isis.

2277
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:34,620
Like they would show up and just kill 
and fucking bail.

2278
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:35,513
They were the wrong thing to see if you 
went to the beach to try to catch some 

2279
01:41:37,951 --> 01:41:42,630
fish and you saw a boat pull up.
There was no satellite radio back then.

2280
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:43,733
You didn't know what was coming.
If you saw a boat in the distance and 

2281
01:41:46,021 --> 01:41:48,330
that boat and a dragon head at the front
of it and you're like,

2282
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:49,380
oh fuck.

2283
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:50,090
It's like,
do.

2284
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:52,740
They just wrote a across an ocean and 
there were giant,

2285
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:53,783
giant time.
My ancestors probably a little smaller 

2286
01:41:57,571 --> 01:41:59,070
because it didn't get proper food.
Right.

2287
01:41:59,190 --> 01:42:00,820
I got better at giant back then was like
six,

2288
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:02,580
two.
I did breastfeed for awhile.

2289
01:42:02,910 --> 01:42:05,580
Those.
The thing about Jack Johnson,

2290
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:09,030
Jack Johnson,
who was the Galveston giant,

2291
01:42:09,031 --> 01:42:09,864
that's what they called him,
but you find out Jack Johnson's 

2292
01:42:11,461 --> 01:42:14,060
Asheville height.
He was the heavyweight champion.

2293
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:16,740
The were the first black heavyweight 
boxing champion of the world.

2294
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:18,580
I don't think he was any taller than 
six.

2295
01:42:18,581 --> 01:42:19,520
Three.
Well,

2296
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:21,250
that's a way better height.
How tall is he?

2297
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:22,080
Six.
One.

2298
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,240
Six months.
That's the best male height because six,

2299
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:25,560
seven bloods.
Yeah,

2300
01:42:25,561 --> 01:42:27,690
but the Galveston giant.
Think about that.

2301
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:31,170
Think about calling a guy a giant who 
only six one,

2302
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,710
but in 18,
78 he was a fucking giant.

2303
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,020
Yeah.
It's almost like the Middle Ages.

2304
01:42:37,170 --> 01:42:39,360
Professors like the guy that can read 
one word.

2305
01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:41,100
He had three wives.
Even back in the day.

2306
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:41,970
Go,
go,

2307
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:45,450
go back to that.
Please leave that back to the wives.

2308
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:47,910
Where's his wikipedia page?
He just had it.

2309
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:53,090
You go to his whatever it was just if 
you just go back,

2310
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:56,060
it showed the three wives.
There it goes.

2311
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:57,050
Okay.
Yeah.

2312
01:42:57,051 --> 01:42:58,070
See spouses.

2313
01:43:00,110 --> 01:43:03,890
He got tired of given the Deq to Irene 
and then he moved out of the lease.

2314
01:43:03,950 --> 01:43:05,960
Lucille is,
they're all white ladies by the way.

2315
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:09,140
Get tired given the dicta her moved on 
to Eta.

2316
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:12,920
Gave the Dick to her.
He's like an ll cool j song.

2317
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:15,080
Bam.
That's crazy.

2318
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:16,580
I was looking for overlap.
Hold on,

2319
01:43:16,581 --> 01:43:19,580
go back please.
Jamie's just a click and feet.

2320
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:22,190
He loves clicking.
Look at that.

2321
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:26,630
I'm the last one is I read was last one.
I guess 1946.

2322
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:28,190
Didn't what?
How did he die?

2323
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:31,070
He died in some strange way,
but uh,

2324
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:34,160
he was only 200 pounds to.
There was a giant back then.

2325
01:43:34,230 --> 01:43:36,290
Imagine that.
That's so intense.

2326
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:37,371
Yeah.
That's nuts.

2327
01:43:37,371 --> 01:43:38,630
I mean,
you've got to be like 2:40,

2328
01:43:38,631 --> 01:43:40,100
right?
How much you want to 50?

2329
01:43:40,101 --> 01:43:41,270
I'm like,
I'm like 15.

2330
01:43:41,271 --> 01:43:43,010
Over two because the beers and the 
fires.

2331
01:43:43,070 --> 01:43:44,810
Beers and fires everyday.

2332
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:46,940
Shit Buddy.
Fire doesn't put weight on you.

2333
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:47,803
I know it'd be a drink the beers and it 
also makes me cook a lot at meet with 

2334
01:43:51,531 --> 01:43:53,780
like fucked up sauces.
What does it say?

2335
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,073
Does it say his death?
It was a really interesting thing 

2336
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:00,194
because it's pretty widely believed that
he took a dive when he lost the title 

2337
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:07,423
and then he was just tired of getting 
arrested constantly and harassed and he 

2338
01:44:11,031 --> 01:44:12,410
just wanted out.
He was sick.

2339
01:44:12,411 --> 01:44:15,350
A crushing sick of white people,
you know,

2340
01:44:15,351 --> 01:44:18,110
he's banging a little white chicks.
That was the heat.

2341
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:20,450
That was some heat back then to it that 
I could get you killed.

2342
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:25,040
That was way before [inaudible] dot com.
Like we didn't have your bag.

2343
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:25,760
Him.
What is.

2344
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,380
He died in a car crash on US highway one
near Franklin,

2345
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:32,990
North Carolina.
Wow.

2346
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:33,973
After racing,
angrily from a diner that refused to 

2347
01:44:36,141 --> 01:44:36,974
serve him.

2348
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:38,853
Pissed dude.
He's like the opera closest black 

2349
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:42,463
hospital sake.
St Agnes Hospital in Raleigh and he was 

2350
01:44:47,001 --> 01:44:50,310
68 years of,
uh,

2351
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:55,700
of age at the time of his death.
He was buried near at a WHO's,

2352
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:59,750
I guess his last woman has grave,
was initially unmarked,

2353
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:04,100
but a stone that bears on named Johnson 
now stands above the plots of check at a

2354
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:05,450
Anne Irene.
Wow,

2355
01:45:05,451 --> 01:45:07,880
that's dark man.
It's really crazy.

2356
01:45:07,881 --> 01:45:08,714
I mean,
that guy was just born in the wrong 

2357
01:45:11,271 --> 01:45:13,340
fucking time.
That was bain man.

2358
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:14,443
That guy was born in darkness.
Like imagine being black in the fucking 

2359
01:45:17,211 --> 01:45:20,030
early 20th century.
Like Holy Shit.

2360
01:45:20,031 --> 01:45:24,720
And he just rose champion.
He became the champion and a,

2361
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:27,230
an interesting style.
If you watch the way he fought,

2362
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:29,570
he fought different if different than 
other people.

2363
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:31,730
What did he do?
Well,

2364
01:45:31,731 --> 01:45:32,564
he just had,
he just had a long reach and had really 

2365
01:45:34,761 --> 01:45:37,190
good power for the time and he was just 
very smart.

2366
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,250
He knew what a drag guys that deep water
and beat the fuck out of him,

2367
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:41,383
but he fought like a murderous puncher 
who's a middleweight champion named 

2368
01:45:44,331 --> 01:45:47,880
Stanley Ketchel.
It's a fascinating fight because Stanley

2369
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:51,110
Ketchel only weighed like 160 pounds,
this tiny little dude,

2370
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:53,870
but it was just a little savage.
Stanley Catcho,

2371
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:55,783
Jack Johnson on the Chin and fucking 
dropped him and it was like a big deal 

2372
01:45:59,061 --> 01:45:59,894
at the time because everybody wanted a 
white guy to beat the heavyweight title 

2373
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:05,180
holder and the White Guy was way 
smaller.

2374
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:06,710
Like,
look how small catchall is.

2375
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:07,903
I mean,
he's fucking way smaller than Jack 

2376
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:13,220
Johnson.
But Jack Johnson overestimated him.

2377
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:17,120
And Stanley catcho caught him with a 
murderous righthand.

2378
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:18,193
Stanley Catcho was a savage.
He was the middleweight champion of the 

2379
01:46:21,531 --> 01:46:22,940
world.
Ideas at him.

2380
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:23,833
Sorry this says,
Tom Burns to like Mike Tyson's punch 

2381
01:46:26,931 --> 01:46:28,640
out,
beat the shit out of Tommy Burns.

2382
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:30,680
Go see if you can fight any.

2383
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,860
Slowly tortured him and beat him up.
See Find Stanley Ketchel.

2384
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:37,250
Stanley Catcho was the guy who was the 
middleweight champion.

2385
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:38,533
And uh,
it was a really interesting thing 

2386
01:46:41,451 --> 01:46:42,284
because Jack Johnson seems like it's 
taking it easy with them for a little 

2387
01:46:44,301 --> 01:46:47,210
bit and then capital catches him with a 
bomb.

2388
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,580
Oh,
is that it?

2389
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:51,030
This is like,
look,

2390
01:46:51,031 --> 01:46:51,864
they had like warmup stuff.
They were warming up and they showed 

2391
01:46:54,421 --> 01:46:56,310
them training,
like how they would train back then.

2392
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:58,680
It's really interesting.
Nobody knew what the fuck do.

2393
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,020
I'll just run through the streets and 
shit.

2394
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:02,670
I shouldn't be run.
That's awesome.

2395
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:03,743
They're just trying to figure it out.
You know that Stanley catchall way 

2396
01:47:05,911 --> 01:47:09,420
smaller.
Just waste more than Jack Johnson.

2397
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,220
Johnson might've been 30 pounds heavier 
than him.

2398
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:14,213
Maybe even more.
Do you think like a mighty mouse could 

2399
01:47:15,511 --> 01:47:16,920
take that dude right now?
Oh yeah,

2400
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:18,900
for sure.
No,

2401
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:20,730
he wouldn't.
Not Boxing.

2402
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:23,350
But in mma you would never hit him.
He wears.

2403
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:24,613
I mean,
unless you figured out some way to stop 

2404
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:29,520
him from moving and him in.
He's so fast.

2405
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:30,533
He would anticipate your movement and he
would just slowly dragged these fucking 

2406
01:47:33,061 --> 01:47:34,080
guys to the ground.
He's like,

2407
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:35,070
Neil,
for Matrix.

2408
01:47:35,071 --> 01:47:38,040
It's like I started watching a bunch of 
clips based on your indoor,

2409
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:38,903
like talking about,
you were talking about how he's like 

2410
01:47:40,051 --> 01:47:42,870
pound for pound.
Just the craziest fighter ever.

2411
01:47:42,871 --> 01:47:43,704
So my best.
It's not the craziest because he 

2412
01:47:46,231 --> 01:47:47,940
doesn't,
he doesn't fight crazy.

2413
01:47:47,941 --> 01:47:49,500
Fight Smart,
you know,

2414
01:47:49,501 --> 01:47:50,334
see if he could find were canceled,
drops them because it's a big deal 

2415
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:54,083
because nobody expected it.
I think this is already will catch us 

2416
01:47:56,161 --> 01:47:57,630
getting fucked up.
You see his face.

2417
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:05,040
Oh look at that.
He got jacked just back it up.

2418
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,270
Just a hair so we can watch that again.
This is a back of the time.

2419
01:48:09,271 --> 01:48:10,104
This is a giant deal because Stanley 
Catcho was a white guy and they were 

2420
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:15,354
like,
finally we got a black guy down on the 

2421
01:48:18,031 --> 01:48:21,270
ground and it wasn't even a big white 
guy that did it,

2422
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:22,920
you know,
and everybody wanted Jack,

2423
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,050
Jack Dempsey to come back

2424
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:29,733
there still there.
We're still in denial at the point that 

2425
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:33,610
like black people.
That's a serious right hand now.

2426
01:48:33,611 --> 01:48:35,470
I think Jack Dempsey actually was after 
this.

2427
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:36,760
Now that I'm thinking about that,
I'm like,

2428
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:39,610
I'm wrong.
They wanted Jim Jefferies,

2429
01:48:39,670 --> 01:48:42,990
I think no clue.
Was it that they want he beat?

2430
01:48:43,110 --> 01:48:45,810
Who did he beat towards the end of his 
title reign man,

2431
01:48:45,970 --> 01:48:48,000
my boxing histories.
Terrible dude.

2432
01:48:48,001 --> 01:48:49,830
After he got knocked down,
it was almost like he was like,

2433
01:48:49,831 --> 01:48:50,581
ah,
fuck this.

2434
01:48:50,581 --> 01:48:51,414
And he just,
he just went crazy and just took them 

2435
01:48:52,321 --> 01:48:53,154
out.
Literally it was going down before you 

2436
01:48:54,021 --> 01:48:54,854
got hit.
I was weird.

2437
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:56,013
So that again,
it might have been that he got caught 

2438
01:48:57,601 --> 01:49:01,080
with his legs tied up.
Watch this step on the foot.

2439
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:02,240
Nope.
Hmm.

2440
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:03,240
One more time.
One more time.

2441
01:49:03,241 --> 01:49:06,900
Please watch your step forward.
He.

2442
01:49:06,901 --> 01:49:10,740
Yeah,
he was almost like going down because he

2443
01:49:10,741 --> 01:49:15,060
knew the power of the punch.
He definitely got clipped though as well

2444
01:49:15,061 --> 01:49:19,260
as also ducking his head and got clipped
on the way down,

2445
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:20,094
but he was ducking way down where he 
might've fallen down or at least fallen 

2446
01:49:22,441 --> 01:49:26,130
off balance even if you didn't get hit,
but who is this?

2447
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:27,623
Who's the main do that?
He went back and forth with go to the 

2448
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:31,074
web to is wikipedia.
James Jeffreys may think it is James 

2449
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,273
Jeffreys.
Yeah,

2450
01:49:37,330 --> 01:49:42,330
but at the time when this was going on 
to have a black heavyweight champion,

2451
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:44,373
I mean,
I don't think we can even fathom the 

2452
01:49:47,531 --> 01:49:50,230
level of racism this guy experience 
unreal.

2453
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:54,340
I mean literally every day worrying for 
his life.

2454
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:58,000
Meanwhile throwing hot dick at white 
chicks,

2455
01:49:58,750 --> 01:49:59,583
but it's almost like the gang kind of 
thing where it's like that environment 

2456
01:50:02,441 --> 01:50:05,680
of just darkness made him such a fucking
diamond.

2457
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:10,920
J Neil still lived 20 years old and 
Ralphie may as I bought her man,

2458
01:50:10,961 --> 01:50:12,640
I was a good dude.
He wasn't good dude.

2459
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:13,330
What?
I mean,

2460
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:16,030
think about the life of a person that 
lived back then.

2461
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:16,893
He made it 68,
died in a car crash because he was mad 

2462
01:50:18,671 --> 01:50:21,480
that a bleachers wouldn't serve him.
That's cool.

2463
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:24,850
That's good way to go out though.
I guess it's not the worst way.

2464
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:26,053
It's quick.
It's better than being hung by some 

2465
01:50:27,071 --> 01:50:28,480
racist for sure.

2466
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:30,910
I do.
Being hung with suck.

2467
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,500
That sucks.
If you're going to be executed well,

2468
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:35,420
what do you pick?
Are we really doing this kind of stuff?

2469
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:37,690
What do you want to talk to them guys?
Come on,

2470
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:40,660
try and do bits.
Guy Hangs people.

2471
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,390
Um,
what's the worst now?

2472
01:50:43,391 --> 01:50:44,224
How would you want to go out?
Like let's say you're actually are your 

2473
01:50:45,911 --> 01:50:46,744
sentences daddy quick.
You want a quick bullets are quick 

2474
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,630
bullets for sure.
I used to say lethal injection,

2475
01:50:52,631 --> 01:50:55,510
but that shit's all bullets.
If someone knows what they're doing,

2476
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,030
you know,
you get someone to shoot you.

2477
01:50:58,031 --> 01:51:00,670
That actually knows how to shoot people.
What if you just get hit in the deck and

2478
01:51:00,671 --> 01:51:03,340
they understand that?
That's a bad way to Dan to end like that

2479
01:51:03,341 --> 01:51:04,420
catcher?
Yeah.

2480
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:06,820
Just get hit right in the deck.
Like the head of the Dec.

2481
01:51:06,821 --> 01:51:08,350
Not even like the ball is just no more.

2482
01:51:08,350 --> 01:51:11,470
Dick.
How loNg is it going to be before if you

2483
01:51:11,471 --> 01:51:14,050
got shot in the foot and your foot blows
off,

2484
01:51:14,110 --> 01:51:16,480
they could take you to a lab and they 
grow you a new foot.

2485
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:18,760
I think it's soon.
I feel like it's soon.

2486
01:51:19,150 --> 01:51:19,983
I feel like it's within 20 years.
I feel like within 20 years they're 

2487
01:51:22,901 --> 01:51:24,070
going to be like,
if you,

2488
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:26,440
if your hand got mashed and some sort of
advice,

2489
01:51:26,470 --> 01:51:27,760
they're going to be able to give you a 
new hand.

2490
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:30,640
I think it might even be sooner.
It might be,

2491
01:51:31,030 --> 01:51:33,160
but I'm given to 20 years,
so I look smart when it comes.

2492
01:51:33,161 --> 01:51:34,120
True.
Yeah.

2493
01:51:34,121 --> 01:51:35,800
like you called it you were like,
yeah,

2494
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:38,380
I feel like in 20 years and be like,
yeah,

2495
01:51:38,381 --> 01:51:40,170
you called it for.
I'm more.

2496
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:43,120
I'm all about brains where it's like,
I just don't want to go crazy.

2497
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,400
Yeah.
Well they,

2498
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:47,590
well not only that,
we want to be able to repair people that

2499
01:51:47,591 --> 01:51:49,800
have been injured,
like car accidents.

2500
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:51,940
Yeah.
Do you know the story of sam kinison?

2501
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:52,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

2502
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:53,833
Yeah.
About how.

2503
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:55,300
Yeah.
Go tell the story though.

2504
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:56,134
He,
he was one way as a child and then his 

2505
01:51:57,911 --> 01:52:01,360
mom says that he got hit by a car and 
then after that he was wild.

2506
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:03,490
Just crazy.
I mean he really got hit,

2507
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:04,990
like to the point of,
you know,

2508
01:52:05,230 --> 01:52:06,063
they were worrieD he's going to live.
He survived and he became a fucking 

2509
01:52:09,131 --> 01:52:09,964
maniac.
And tHis was talking about you with 

2510
01:52:10,781 --> 01:52:14,710
tomatoes he got on twitter and just lost
his representation.

2511
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:16,040
No,
but I think that,

2512
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:21,430
I think that about myself a lot of times
because I got hit in the head a lot when

2513
01:52:21,431 --> 01:52:22,330
I was young and I'm like,
well,

2514
01:52:22,331 --> 01:52:26,260
how much does that affect me?
Affect my rational thinking?

2515
01:52:26,410 --> 01:52:29,230
How much does it affect my ability to 
control my impulses?

2516
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:30,221
You know,
like,

2517
01:52:30,221 --> 01:52:31,660
um,
I was,

2518
01:52:31,661 --> 01:52:32,494
I'm on a flight once with michael irvin 
and michael irvin who's a really good 

2519
01:52:35,441 --> 01:52:38,920
guy,
was talking to me about kids who grow up

2520
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:42,280
in terrible environments in that these 
kids,

2521
01:52:42,281 --> 01:52:46,160
if they're in the room,
the womb and their mother

2522
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:50,810
is experiencing violence or stress or 
domestic violence or you know,

2523
01:52:50,811 --> 01:52:51,644
she sees crazy shit that those impulses 
go through her body and they directly 

2524
01:52:56,811 --> 01:52:57,644
affect the way the fetus develops.
And the children who grow up with 

2525
01:53:00,801 --> 01:53:01,634
violence around them,
like literally they're conceived and 

2526
01:53:03,951 --> 01:53:06,770
they have,
they develop inside the womb of a mother

2527
01:53:06,771 --> 01:53:07,604
is experiencing all that.
They have a higher propensity for 

2528
01:53:09,921 --> 01:53:11,510
violence,
a shorter fuse.

2529
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:16,010
They're more worried about things going 
badly and it was more intense.

2530
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:20,660
More quick to pull the trigger and that 
all of that is a direct response,

2531
01:53:20,661 --> 01:53:21,494
like a biological support system,
like your body's trying to keep you 

2532
01:53:24,021 --> 01:53:29,021
alive and that the more you encounter 
that sort of reinforces that.

2533
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:33,200
The more times you get hit,
the more times things hit you,

2534
01:53:33,410 --> 01:53:34,243
the more times you get hurt,
the more times you know you crash heads 

2535
01:53:36,981 --> 01:53:40,190
as a football player,
you get punched in the face as a boxer.

2536
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:43,790
The more times a tomato hits your 
fucking dome at 90 miles an hour by some

2537
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:46,460
kid who thinks it's funny,
but whatever it is,

2538
01:53:46,461 --> 01:53:47,294
like what?
Whatever things that are rattling your 

2539
01:53:48,531 --> 01:53:52,880
skull,
those things reinforce your brain's idea

2540
01:53:52,881 --> 01:53:57,630
that violence can come at any moment and
you have to be prepared and that's that.

2541
01:53:57,890 --> 01:54:01,010
That quick alive.
It's the scorpion and the frog.

2542
01:54:01,011 --> 01:54:01,844
Shit.
It's like your nature keeps you alive 

2543
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:03,733
and that quick trigger I think 
translates to various aspects of your 

2544
01:54:06,951 --> 01:54:07,784
life,
not just to things where there's a real 

2545
01:54:08,961 --> 01:54:10,940
situation you have to deal with.
Like,

2546
01:54:10,941 --> 01:54:11,774
you know,
you have to be able to react quickly 

2547
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:14,480
because your body is programmed to be.
Oh,

2548
01:54:14,630 --> 01:54:15,950
I get hit a lot.
I'm ready.

2549
01:54:15,951 --> 01:54:18,050
When things come to me,
I'm going to fucking fight him off.

2550
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:20,600
I'm gonna fight them.
I'm ready for somebody.

2551
01:54:20,601 --> 01:54:21,440
Talked some shit on twitter.

2552
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:22,900
I'm going to say something,
kevin shit to you,

2553
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:24,640
you fucking piece of shit.
I'm gonna.

2554
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:26,420
Say something that's going to allow me 
to call myself a white nigger.

2555
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:27,403
I'm reading,
like I said at first drives drive crazy 

2556
01:54:33,471 --> 01:54:34,304
verbal nuclear weapon on people.
It's like I knew a lot of girls that 

2557
01:54:37,401 --> 01:54:39,710
were like a sexually abused kids.
His kids,

2558
01:54:39,711 --> 01:54:41,420
it became promiscuous because they're 
like,

2559
01:54:41,421 --> 01:54:42,950
I'm going to fuck you before he fucked 
me.

2560
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:44,421
You know what I mean?
Like,

2561
01:54:44,421 --> 01:54:45,380
that's,
that's common.

2562
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:46,430
Well,
there is that,

2563
01:54:46,431 --> 01:54:47,264
but I think there's also something that 
happens with people that were sexually 

2564
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:52,370
abused as kids where they become 
hypersexual as they get older.

2565
01:54:52,371 --> 01:54:53,900
For sure.
It's not,

2566
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:55,610
it's not good.
I mean,

2567
01:54:55,611 --> 01:54:57,140
we're not looking at this in a positive 
way,

2568
01:54:57,141 --> 01:55:01,700
but I think course activity where we're 
talking about when it comes to,

2569
01:55:01,701 --> 01:55:03,620
um,
through a history,

2570
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:04,693
human beings molesting children,
that it was insanely common and it 

2571
01:55:08,601 --> 01:55:12,290
probably wasn't until like what,
what year?

2572
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:14,510
So people realize that it's a horrible 
thing to do.

2573
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:15,463
Was it like the 18 hundreds?
It's just one dude's like this is crazy 

2574
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,390
because did they did the same thing with
violence?

2575
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:21,323
Like infantry comes from infant,
like they would send the infantry was 

2576
01:55:24,681 --> 01:55:25,514
always like 12 year olds.
What tree comes from Infants for cannon 

2577
01:55:30,171 --> 01:55:31,004
fodder man.
They used to just send out the kids to 

2578
01:55:32,631 --> 01:55:33,920
get fucked up.
Really?

2579
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:35,510
Yeah,
like right now in africa.

2580
01:55:35,511 --> 01:55:36,344
Glad these,
like little militias like the kids is 

2581
01:55:38,361 --> 01:55:41,750
when you get the sociopath because if 
you don't raise them right,

2582
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:44,160
they'll fucking kill anybody.
God damn.

2583
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:46,680
Oh dude.
It makes me so because I like,

2584
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:47,813
my town was riddled with like pedophile 
priests and shit and so it had a real 

2585
01:55:51,961 --> 01:55:55,710
bad situation with riddled because we 
had a mon senior,

2586
01:55:55,711 --> 01:55:59,190
there was messed up.
I'm long dead shit so it doesn't matter.

2587
01:55:59,191 --> 01:56:02,360
But like he would bring in other ones 
and then they were just.

2588
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:04,680
Do you think he talked about it?
Yeah,

2589
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:06,083
for sure.
What do you think that I said I can't 

2590
01:56:09,031 --> 01:56:09,864
even imagine man lays there.
I bet it was some kind of code and just 

2591
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:13,990
kid pushes back.
Dude.

2592
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,690
I was always an I.
I never,

2593
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:16,693
I never think they talk like girls like 
guys talk about girls like guys talk 

2594
01:56:19,630 --> 01:56:23,460
about girls like girls.
She loves coke and she's down to fuck.

2595
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:24,623
Like do you think they literally talked 
about abusing kids the same way a man 

2596
01:56:27,271 --> 01:56:28,740
would talk about or a woman even?

2597
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:29,573
We talked about hooking up with a guy 
he's got a big deck is going to be 

2598
01:56:31,411 --> 01:56:32,244
awesome.
You talked about It like in an openly 

2599
01:56:33,601 --> 01:56:34,770
sexual way.
I can't,

2600
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:35,731
I,
I don't.

2601
01:56:35,731 --> 01:56:39,080
I don't even know fuck.
Like it's just like is there some.

2602
01:56:39,330 --> 01:56:42,540
Did they use that code but it like it 
crippled.

2603
01:56:42,541 --> 01:56:45,970
My town is full of like there's some 
weird shit going on there with that.

2604
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,450
Like not the town I live in now,
but the other like where I'm from,

2605
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:49,523
great people love where I'm from,
a lot of pride where I'm from great 

2606
01:56:51,631 --> 01:56:54,540
town,
but like there's some shit going down,

2607
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:55,433
you know,
crazy that you'd be in this great area 

2608
01:56:57,870 --> 01:57:01,290
and just one element makes the whole 
thing chaos.

2609
01:57:01,291 --> 01:57:02,124
Just raw and everybody accepts that 
element because in some perverted way 

2610
01:57:06,150 --> 01:57:10,290
you really think all that kid fucking is
connected to god through it.

2611
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:12,990
And It always was the kid with no dad 
and shit.

2612
01:57:12,991 --> 01:57:15,600
That's why I'm fucking,
I have this hyper like,

2613
01:57:15,710 --> 01:57:17,640
like you were talking about that 
response shit.

2614
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:21,470
That's mine where I'm like,
if you're going after vulnerable people,

2615
01:57:21,471 --> 01:57:23,940
it makes me insane.
well that was the sandusky thing,

2616
01:57:23,941 --> 01:57:24,774
right?
Like he would always go after kids that 

2617
01:57:25,921 --> 01:57:26,754
didn't have a family and he would help 
them and he created all these 

2618
01:57:29,971 --> 01:57:32,930
organization,
this organization rather to uh,

2619
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:36,000
you know,
like a charity organization.

2620
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:37,113
Yeah.
To help these young kids and he's just 

2621
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:39,833
do it.
And that's why I get furious about the 

2622
01:57:41,730 --> 01:57:44,150
people that misrepresent themselves a 
lot more than the.

2623
01:57:44,570 --> 01:57:46,790
Like there's all these scandals in 
hollywood now and,

2624
01:57:46,791 --> 01:57:47,624
and you know,
the spaces in the weinsteins of the 

2625
01:57:49,621 --> 01:57:52,500
world are so much more dark and evil 
than like,

2626
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:53,633
you know,
there's that scan with andy dick and I 

2627
01:57:54,690 --> 01:57:55,470
like andy dick.

2628
01:57:55,470 --> 01:57:56,303
I'm like the dudes and obvious dick 
robber and he feels bad about it and he 

2629
01:57:59,071 --> 01:58:02,040
fucking just wants to get punched.
When they asked him what did he,

2630
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:05,010
what was his initial,
what was his initial comment?

2631
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:07,980
Was something like a kissing and licking
his.

2632
01:58:07,981 --> 01:58:08,814
What he does,
he's been doing it for something like 

2633
01:58:09,361 --> 01:58:10,280
that.
No,

2634
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,153
ma misbehaviors.
His middle name or misconduct 

2635
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:17,450
misconduct.
They're signing up for something.

2636
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:18,540
yeah.
Yeah.

2637
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:19,650
That,
you know,

2638
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:20,543
they were upset because they fired him 
from an indie film because of sexual 

2639
01:58:23,731 --> 01:58:24,840
misconduct.
By the way,

2640
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:26,933
I hate to be cynical because I don't 
want to say that anybody who wasn't 

2641
01:58:30,091 --> 01:58:30,924
victimized,
but if I was running an indie film that 

2642
01:58:33,901 --> 01:58:35,970
was so fucking stupid,
I hired andy dick.

2643
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:41,410
I might be the type of guy that would 
make a statement about andy being andy,

2644
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:43,240
just like we're going to put our foot 
down.

2645
01:58:43,410 --> 01:58:48,410
he enough capital and you ever have 
enough and then,

2646
01:58:48,671 --> 01:58:49,750
hey,
if you want to see this film,

2647
01:58:49,751 --> 01:58:52,480
it's going to be appearing at the sunset
plaza and blah,

2648
01:58:52,481 --> 01:58:52,891
blah,
blah.

2649
01:58:52,891 --> 01:58:53,724
It's a good move.
At least gets people talking about 

2650
01:58:55,361 --> 01:58:58,810
something that they would never have 
talked about because andy dick hops into

2651
01:58:58,811 --> 01:59:01,750
the river of speculation as to who's a 
molester.

2652
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:03,100
Yeah.
But like for me,

2653
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:06,130
he's so much law,
like he's just,

2654
01:59:06,210 --> 01:59:07,410
he's not going to make.
Yeah.

2655
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:09,430
It's not like the snake in the grass 
where you like,

2656
01:59:09,431 --> 01:59:11,210
oh,
that guy's misrepresenting himself,

2657
01:59:11,211 --> 01:59:12,720
don't cosby.
Exactly.

2658
01:59:13,050 --> 01:59:14,410
It's,
it's a dude is like,

2659
01:59:14,411 --> 01:59:16,150
oh,
I grabbed the deck and got knocked out.

2660
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:20,920
He's always just like a deep rabbit.
He tried to grab my dick.

2661
01:59:20,921 --> 01:59:23,920
I knocked them down and then he 
apologized and I was like,

2662
01:59:23,921 --> 01:59:26,320
you're all good man.
I know that you're just freaked out.

2663
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:29,080
You get excited about weans man.
And rita was like,

2664
01:59:29,081 --> 01:59:29,914
oh,
thanks for not really fucking up any 

2665
01:59:30,731 --> 01:59:31,540
dag.
And I'm like,

2666
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:33,970
he's vulnerable.
it's vulnerability,

2667
01:59:33,971 --> 01:59:34,804
dude.
It's like some people are just these 

2668
01:59:36,131 --> 01:59:40,570
vulnerable people and like I'm a giant,
like he's not trying to.

2669
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:43,460
It's not about power,
he just blacks out and grabs winners,

2670
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:47,830
but he's also like in a different way 
than you.

2671
01:59:47,831 --> 01:59:48,664
He's a perpetual button pusher but it's 
not necessarily like the worst thing in 

2672
01:59:52,271 --> 01:59:55,540
the world to be that button pusher.
But that is what he is.

2673
01:59:57,070 --> 02:00:01,330
He's not,
he's not as competent with it as you.

2674
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:04,270
He doesn't navigate the waters grabbing 
dick's,

2675
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:05,340
andy's,
but like,

2676
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:06,213
you know,
there's hills and valleys to like your 

2677
02:00:08,441 --> 02:00:11,150
interactions with people and like 
there's certain hills where you like,

2678
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:11,993
you go,
you could just get way too crazy with 

2679
02:00:13,181 --> 02:00:15,730
it.
You bring it down and he tried to figure

2680
02:00:15,731 --> 02:00:17,500
out what's,
what's a good middle ground?

2681
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,570
Andy just,
it's all spikes.

2682
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:24,900
It's all like ah,
the ground and that's what I have a hard

2683
02:00:25,331 --> 02:00:26,164
time judging people.
Like the pr person I've always been is 

2684
02:00:29,231 --> 02:00:30,760
trying to not be judgemental.
It's the,

2685
02:00:30,761 --> 02:00:33,340
it's the snakes that I'm like,
oh you're,

2686
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:35,860
you're telling everyone about global 
warming in your private jet.

2687
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:37,990
Like you can go fuck himself,
you know?

2688
02:00:37,991 --> 02:00:39,520
And it's like,
it's the same with like andy,

2689
02:00:39,521 --> 02:00:40,354
I'm like,
andy has never acted like not a train 

2690
02:00:42,761 --> 02:00:45,190
wreck dick grabber.
And lIke when my friend died,

2691
02:00:45,191 --> 02:00:48,490
the dude wrote me a fucking sweet email.
Like he's a sweet man.

2692
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:51,010
He just blacks out,
tries to grab wieners,

2693
02:00:51,011 --> 02:00:52,600
gets sober,
no more winter grabs.

2694
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:54,550
And so when I see them getting pulled to
the mock,

2695
02:00:54,551 --> 02:00:55,384
I'm like,
you can't associate him with these like 

2696
02:00:57,490 --> 02:00:58,323
power fucked up guys that are like,
you want to watch me whack off on a 

2697
02:01:02,290 --> 02:01:03,040
ficus?

2698
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:05,380
But here's the thing,
like the park guy,

2699
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:09,910
can zack I ever make it back now because
no one's for them anyway.

2700
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:11,500
You know,
It's,

2701
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:13,210
it's not like a iron man.
it's like,

2702
02:01:13,211 --> 02:01:13,671
yeah,
that dude,

2703
02:01:13,671 --> 02:01:14,504
he used to do a lot of fucking drugs,
but we're still rooting for him because 

2704
02:01:15,931 --> 02:01:17,130
he's vulnerable.
You know?

2705
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:17,973
It's like no one's.
No one relates to the guy whacking off 

2706
02:01:19,661 --> 02:01:21,430
on a fucking plant in front of gwyneth 
paltrow.

2707
02:01:21,431 --> 02:01:22,390
You're like,
bro,

2708
02:01:22,391 --> 02:01:23,290
you're out,
man.

2709
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:24,070
You're out.
You're out.

2710
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:27,040
You're out of the tribe.
That's why the dude didn't.

2711
02:01:27,041 --> 02:01:28,810
You just Interviewed a kill scene or 
whatever.

2712
02:01:28,811 --> 02:01:29,644
Like he has a way in,
he has a way back in because everyone 

2713
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:36,820
relates to reward it.
He's not like actually raping.

2714
02:01:36,821 --> 02:01:39,980
People just got mixed up and like,
like likes on twitter

2715
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:40,813
and shit,
but this is the idea that I want to 

2716
02:01:41,571 --> 02:01:42,830
explore because I think it's 
fascinating.

2717
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:46,310
is there a point where a guy fucks up 
too many times?

2718
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:50,180
Like say if harvey weinstein jerked off 
into one plant.

2719
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:51,073
One time he was on coke,
he got crazy and he's hanging out with 

2720
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:58,730
someone.
She's like one of the naked vampires and

2721
02:01:58,731 --> 02:01:59,564
dusk till dawn,
but she doesn't get to talk to snake on 

2722
02:02:03,201 --> 02:02:04,034
her and she's so hot and he's so fat and
so gross and he's so coked up and so 

2723
02:02:08,691 --> 02:02:11,890
drunk and he also has a billion dollars 
in the bank and he started saying,

2724
02:02:11,891 --> 02:02:13,000
well,
I can put you in a fucking movie.

2725
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:14,153
I can put you in.
If I could give him benefit of the 

2726
02:02:16,401 --> 02:02:16,821
doubt.
I'm like,

2727
02:02:16,821 --> 02:02:19,400
that guy loves photosynthesis.
He loves it.

2728
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:20,470
Like,
dude,

2729
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:22,550
get synthesis.
He's whacking on a plant.

2730
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:23,091
He's like,
yeah,

2731
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:24,150
you take fucking carbon.

2732
02:02:24,150 --> 02:02:29,150
You know what photosynthesis is 
convicting can changing sunlight,

2733
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:30,463
sunlight into food.
RIght now we're talking about whacking 

2734
02:02:31,851 --> 02:02:32,684
on a plant,
but that's not photosynthesis in the 

2735
02:02:33,891 --> 02:02:35,030
plant making shit.
Yeah.

2736
02:02:35,031 --> 02:02:38,660
But photosynthesis is like the specific 
process of,

2737
02:02:38,690 --> 02:02:39,511
uh,
of,

2738
02:02:39,511 --> 02:02:42,290
of a plant converting sunlight into 
energy.

2739
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,180
No emphasis.
I have no impulse control.

2740
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:46,820
Let's find out what that is because I 
could easily be wrong,

2741
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:49,280
but I thought that photosynthesis meant 
converting.

2742
02:02:49,290 --> 02:02:50,130
Turning light.
Light.

2743
02:02:50,150 --> 02:02:51,410
Yeah.
That's sugar,

2744
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:52,850
right?
Just not come.

2745
02:02:54,170 --> 02:02:56,830
so turned out bro.
He's like,

2746
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:59,030
look aT you making sugar out of sight.
Oh,

2747
02:02:59,031 --> 02:03:00,020
I get it.
Oh,

2748
02:03:00,021 --> 02:03:02,960
okaY.
So he got excited by the photosynthesis.

2749
02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:04,063
See,
that's the thing is now people are 

2750
02:03:04,611 --> 02:03:08,060
starting to treat me like I'm this like 
moral high ground guy and I don't wait,

2751
02:03:08,061 --> 02:03:10,250
hold on.
Who is doing that because of the fucking

2752
02:03:10,251 --> 02:03:11,450
standing up for three year oLds.

2753
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:12,411
And I'm like,
dude,

2754
02:03:12,411 --> 02:03:16,060
I wouldn't judge one plant whack.
I'm not as the difference between the,

2755
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:17,263
you know,
like transgender three year olds and 

2756
02:03:19,130 --> 02:03:22,640
some coked up studio executive course.
Here's the thing,

2757
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:23,653
I don't want to excuse anybody's 
behavior that's done anything to 

2758
02:03:25,791 --> 02:03:26,624
victimize other people,
but it is a fascinating aspect of 

2759
02:03:29,271 --> 02:03:32,330
hollywood culture that forever,
if you wanted to get a part,

2760
02:03:32,510 --> 02:03:36,410
you had to go to the casting couch and 
everybody knew it and there was a lot of

2761
02:03:36,411 --> 02:03:41,411
those guys that had disproportionate 
relationships like they were disgusting.

2762
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:45,830
He's disgusting and his wife is fucking 
smoking.

2763
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:46,873
Ever seen harvey's wife.
She's smoking and no need to bring her 

2764
02:03:52,371 --> 02:03:53,204
into this at all,
but I'm just explaining like this is a 

2765
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:55,843
consistently disproportionate 
relationship that exists throughout 

2766
02:03:58,161 --> 02:03:58,994
hollywood.
Like there's the guy who was insanely 

2767
02:04:00,951 --> 02:04:01,784
wealthy but physically vial and he 
somehow or another managed to dunk his 

2768
02:04:06,141 --> 02:04:10,100
dick and attends before he coaxed 
himself into an early grave.

2769
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:14,060
That is a fucking common common common 
theme.

2770
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:15,043
Yeah,
and I'm not judging that guy who's just 

2771
02:04:16,551 --> 02:04:19,580
getting tans when he's a two.
That's the american dream.

2772
02:04:19,581 --> 02:04:21,260
How would you do it though?
Exactly?

2773
02:04:21,261 --> 02:04:23,390
It's about hating limit.
It's about it is about him,

2774
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:24,553
but thIs is my point.
It's like you do not get to dunk your 

2775
02:04:27,201 --> 02:04:31,310
dick intends unless you do all the 
things that that guy did.

2776
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:33,260
He produce shakespeare in love.
That's a dictum.

2777
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:35,240
I'm not.
I'm not excusing him.

2778
02:04:35,241 --> 02:04:40,241
I'm not exonerating him and I'm like,
women do not naturally feel attracted to

2779
02:04:40,981 --> 02:04:43,480
obese guys with bad skin.
It isn't.

2780
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:44,333
This is not a common thing.
like in order for him to force the 

2781
02:04:47,461 --> 02:04:48,294
outcome that he desires,
he has to cross cultural inappropriate 

2782
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:52,553
boundaries.
You know like this is just like we're 

2783
02:04:54,091 --> 02:04:57,210
dealing with like mathematics or 
literally,

2784
02:04:57,211 --> 02:04:58,800
and I'm not exonerating him.
Again,

2785
02:04:58,801 --> 02:05:01,410
I can't believe I have to say this,
but I don't want anybody taking this out

2786
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:02,244
of context.

2787
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:04,440
If you are dealing with this as a 
system,

2788
02:05:04,710 --> 02:05:05,543
as a biological system,
like say if you're looking at it from 

2789
02:05:07,141 --> 02:05:09,390
afar and you had no connection to 
culture,

2790
02:05:09,530 --> 02:05:11,730
no connection of civilization,
you'd be like,

2791
02:05:11,731 --> 02:05:12,510
well,
what is this?

2792
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:13,343
How does this system working?
Like how is this one like extremely 

2793
02:05:16,741 --> 02:05:21,741
flawed biological entity oozing its way 
into these perfect shapes?

2794
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:23,213
A good finds,
a way to penetrate these perfect shapes 

2795
02:05:25,141 --> 02:05:25,974
with thin waist and perfect asses and 
beautiful faces and his face is just 

2796
02:05:29,881 --> 02:05:30,714
this pile of slava numbness and just 
discussed and is growing hair on top of 

2797
02:05:37,111 --> 02:05:37,944
it and a little fat dick and just shoots
incompetent sperm into the mouths of 

2798
02:05:42,061 --> 02:05:43,290
tens.
LIke what?

2799
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:44,910
What?
What is happening here?

2800
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:45,773
What is happening here?
What's happening here is there's no way 

2801
02:05:49,141 --> 02:05:50,610
he would've been able to do it any other
way.

2802
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:53,310
It's like so like he's not thor,
right?

2803
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:56,400
He's not a,
he's not some fucking Ryan Reynolds type

2804
02:05:56,401 --> 02:06:00,050
character with perfect cheekbones.
He's just like blah.

2805
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:01,073
And he's just feeding that back with 
coke and fucking booze and blow jobs 

2806
02:06:05,491 --> 02:06:06,324
and,
and constantly trying to put out more 

2807
02:06:07,741 --> 02:06:10,530
things that allow us to buy the biggest 
fucking house,

2808
02:06:10,531 --> 02:06:11,364
the highest sales.
And I mean this is literally the only 

2809
02:06:16,021 --> 02:06:19,140
way he can do that.
We can do that as to be disgusting.

2810
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:21,600
Like girls aren't just going to line up.
I loved,

2811
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:25,830
I loved your movies and I'm just like,
do it to me what you want.

2812
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:28,380
You'll get one out of a million that do 
that,

2813
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:29,393
but that's not enough like they have to.
They would have to find him through the 

2814
02:06:31,411 --> 02:06:32,910
crowd.
That's not gonna work.

2815
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:37,590
It's not going to work.
It's almost like that crazy mindset,

2816
02:06:37,591 --> 02:06:39,030
and again,
not exonerating,

2817
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:43,170
not excusing,
but that mindset of like,

2818
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:45,810
look,
what is the mindset of someone who wants

2819
02:06:45,811 --> 02:06:47,670
to run the fastest race?

2820
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:52,760
What is the mindset of someone who wants
to make the fastest jet bike zero to 100

2821
02:06:55,021 --> 02:06:57,200
time we fucking hanging onto these 
handlebars.

2822
02:06:57,300 --> 02:06:59,490
What is the mindset of that?
I don't know,

2823
02:06:59,491 --> 02:07:02,240
but it seems to be some sort of bizarre 
croissant,

2824
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:07,560
competitive biological environment where
people are chasing some strange,

2825
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:09,660
unattainable,
highest ground,

2826
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:10,171
right?
Yeah.

2827
02:07:10,171 --> 02:07:12,150
It always comes from a,
like a slight flaw,

2828
02:07:12,151 --> 02:07:15,630
lIke the sand makes the pearl.
The calla comedians are little flood.

2829
02:07:15,631 --> 02:07:19,410
Like somebody come at it and I like.
They were talking shit,

2830
02:07:19,411 --> 02:07:21,600
but I was like,
you're so right to go,

2831
02:07:21,601 --> 02:07:24,000
dude.
Owen is the tallest do with the napoleon

2832
02:07:24,001 --> 02:07:26,550
complex I've ever seen,
and I was like,

2833
02:07:26,551 --> 02:07:30,480
you're fucking right man.
It's like ambition comes from this weird

2834
02:07:30,481 --> 02:07:34,670
like feeling of threat where you're like
at any moment I like,

2835
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:36,160
I gotta try,
I gotta work really

2836
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:36,993
hard.
I was trying to work on this bit but it 

2837
02:07:38,681 --> 02:07:39,514
just never went anywhere about like um,
civilizations based on cock size where 

2838
02:07:42,701 --> 02:07:43,534
you got the japanese and the english 
took over the whole world because 

2839
02:07:45,641 --> 02:07:47,830
they're,
their chick is like we need more,

2840
02:07:47,831 --> 02:07:48,550
you know,
your dick.

2841
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:49,383
No good.
and then like sub saharan africans have 

2842
02:07:51,491 --> 02:07:54,280
these monster hammers and their chicks 
like you're not taking over shit.

2843
02:07:54,281 --> 02:07:55,114
You got that big old caulk and they just
stay put exactly where it's almost like 

2844
02:07:57,940 --> 02:07:59,920
ambition sometimes can come from 
insecurity,

2845
02:07:59,921 --> 02:08:03,400
which I am riddled with and a lot of 
ambitious people are totally.

2846
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:04,333
Which is the point that I was making is 
like you have to be disgusting to want 

2847
02:08:06,791 --> 02:08:07,624
to chase down,
tail to the point where you're willing 

2848
02:08:08,771 --> 02:08:11,350
to rape as like at that level.
Right.

2849
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:14,170
And it's like,
and I think like that guy gets a billion

2850
02:08:14,170 --> 02:08:16,000
dollars and he realizes chick still 
don't want to fuck him.

2851
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,580
And he spirals.
Why don't think it matters.

2852
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,030
I think he's constantlY caught up in the
pursuit of doing it,

2853
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:23,433
you know,
and I think probably it was like super 

2854
02:08:24,371 --> 02:08:27,400
exciting to get the young starlet who 
like didn't know any better,

2855
02:08:27,401 --> 02:08:28,190
didn't,
didn't,

2856
02:08:28,190 --> 02:08:29,023
you know,
wasn't really 100 percent sure she was 

2857
02:08:30,311 --> 02:08:31,144
gonna make it in hollywood and having 
that threat of like controlling her 

2858
02:08:34,661 --> 02:08:37,450
career over her,
like a giant vampire.

2859
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:42,760
And then that Was the horrific nature of
it for those women.

2860
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:45,550
That's what's getting people 
particularly angry about this.

2861
02:08:45,551 --> 02:08:48,010
Not that he was a fat gross guy trying 
to get laid.

2862
02:08:48,011 --> 02:08:51,610
Like we've seen those throughout the,
throughout human history has always been

2863
02:08:51,611 --> 02:08:52,444
people trying to get laid,
but is that he was doing it in a way 

2864
02:08:54,161 --> 02:08:56,050
that was victimized.
Exactly.

2865
02:08:56,380 --> 02:08:58,450
Costing psychic scars.
Yeah.

2866
02:08:58,451 --> 02:09:00,890
Because like what does this,
brett ratner,

2867
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:01,770
same stuff today?

2868
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:04,330
Well now it's just getting crazy.
It's just like,

2869
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:07,240
it's going to be like kermit the frog.
It's under control,

2870
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:09,010
but it's like a,
like I'm the opposite.

2871
02:09:09,011 --> 02:09:11,020
I need like a ton of consent.
Like I'm like,

2872
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:11,921
it's like,
oh,

2873
02:09:11,921 --> 02:09:12,930
I like your dick six,
but,

2874
02:09:13,030 --> 02:09:13,863
but you don't love the dick.
Have you ever seen people like there's 

2875
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:17,223
been people that have said that you 
should have a consent form and that you 

2876
02:09:19,721 --> 02:09:22,120
should videotape the signing of the 
consent form?

2877
02:09:22,121 --> 02:09:26,080
I was watching this youtube thing with 
this guy was talking about consent forms

2878
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:27,183
and like that you should get people to 
sign a consent form and like what 

2879
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:30,263
Michael Jordan does that shit.
I think if you're like a billionaire 

2880
02:09:32,111 --> 02:09:33,610
maybe,
but like that's fucked up.

2881
02:09:33,611 --> 02:09:36,910
That takes away the whole thing.
Well it's definitely a different thing.

2882
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:38,093
It's like what a consent form.
It's like a merger and acquisition of 

2883
02:09:40,890 --> 02:09:45,040
two companies like your dick,
dick ink and pussy corp was like,

2884
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:46,330
are you cool with this?

2885
02:09:46,330 --> 02:09:48,430
And you gotta sign that shit.
Well,

2886
02:09:48,610 --> 02:09:49,443
I mean you're seeing things where people
didn't feel cool about it many years 

2887
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:55,750
later,
but in the moment maybe they just let it

2888
02:09:55,751 --> 02:10:00,490
happen and then you decide that that 
letting it happen was way worse.

2889
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:02,093
You know?
Then they were thinking about it at the 

2890
02:10:03,281 --> 02:10:04,114
time and then decided some sort of a 
sexual assault and then it spirals 

2891
02:10:07,421 --> 02:10:08,660
onward and outward.
It's like,

2892
02:10:09,950 --> 02:10:10,783
you know,
it would be really nice if people were 

2893
02:10:12,581 --> 02:10:14,710
just attracted to each other.
I know,

2894
02:10:14,711 --> 02:10:15,544
but like,
it's like someone pasted some of these 

2895
02:10:17,021 --> 02:10:20,050
people though when they're talking about
like eye contact being some shit.

2896
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:22,900
Like I had a friend like this is,
this is dark,

2897
02:10:22,901 --> 02:10:24,260
but whatever.
Uh,

2898
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:25,880
there was um,
you know,

2899
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:28,380
she was kidnapped and like gang raped 
and nothing.

2900
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:29,450
Yeah,
dude,

2901
02:10:29,450 --> 02:10:34,080
it's like there's so false or

2902
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:34,913
like stupid accusations that like,
it clogs up the system to the point 

2903
02:10:38,421 --> 02:10:40,070
where I'm like,
you know,

2904
02:10:40,071 --> 02:10:41,690
I wanted to just kill these people,
you know?

2905
02:10:41,691 --> 02:10:45,240
And like the wolf is getting in me,
the wolf will,

2906
02:10:45,241 --> 02:10:46,074
that the boost urban.
I'm talking about how I want to kill 

2907
02:10:48,340 --> 02:10:49,173
people.
Standard on this podcast goes up once 

2908
02:10:50,721 --> 02:10:51,800
every couple weeks.
But uh,

2909
02:10:52,070 --> 02:10:55,610
yeah,
it made me really a fear infrastructure.

2910
02:10:55,611 --> 02:10:56,361
Like where I'm like,
oh,

2911
02:10:56,361 --> 02:10:58,850
the cops come with a pencil.
It's not that csi shit.

2912
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:00,073
And it's like there's peace,
there's people out there that 

2913
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:04,310
legitimately hurt women and I,
I want them to die.

2914
02:11:04,790 --> 02:11:06,200
And it's like,
you know,

2915
02:11:06,201 --> 02:11:09,590
there's a nine month wait,
I'm like a rape kit because fucking some

2916
02:11:09,591 --> 02:11:10,424
chick regretted some shit when she was 
like texting and coming over with 

2917
02:11:13,041 --> 02:11:13,611
condoms,
you know,

2918
02:11:13,611 --> 02:11:14,444
I'm like,
we got to start triaging some of this 

2919
02:11:16,071 --> 02:11:16,820
shit,
you know?

2920
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:19,670
Well,
you gotta we have to be very,

2921
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:23,990
very strict on both sides of what we 
tolerate,

2922
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:25,220
you know,
and we,

2923
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:25,661
we,
we,

2924
02:11:25,661 --> 02:11:26,494
we cannot tolerate real rape.
But we also cannot tolerate false 

2925
02:11:30,651 --> 02:11:35,651
accusations to 100 percent.
Cannot tolerate indulgences where people

2926
02:11:35,661 --> 02:11:36,494
have distorted perceptions of reality 
and they paint what they know somewhere 

2927
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:45,440
at least subconsciously to be some very 
inaccurate interpretation of the events,

2928
02:11:45,470 --> 02:11:47,120
of course.
And we also can't,

2929
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:48,733
can we,
we can't condone the cosby type shit 

2930
02:11:51,381 --> 02:11:53,900
that went on for years.
We can't condone rape.

2931
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:58,050
We can't condone people who drug people 
or abuse people.

2932
02:11:58,110 --> 02:12:00,110
We can't condone that shit.
Don't either.

2933
02:12:00,111 --> 02:12:00,944
One of those things.
But I think more importantly is there's 

2934
02:12:03,741 --> 02:12:07,670
something going on right now where 
there's a hypercharged environment where

2935
02:12:07,671 --> 02:12:11,840
people are terrified of being called out
and people are like waiting,

2936
02:12:11,841 --> 02:12:13,490
like looking around like what's gonna 
happen next?

2937
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:14,473
And then people are thinking about some 
shit that happened to him a long time 

2938
02:12:16,761 --> 02:12:17,211
ago.
Well,

2939
02:12:17,211 --> 02:12:20,010
you know what?
This has been fucking sitting in my craw

2940
02:12:20,011 --> 02:12:22,640
for 18 years.
Dustin hoffman.

2941
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:25,970
It's time.
The world knows and not like hard boiled

2942
02:12:25,971 --> 02:12:26,780
eggs.
Dustin,

2943
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:29,510
I don't know what's true and I don't 
know what's not true.

2944
02:12:29,511 --> 02:12:32,720
I do not know.
I cannot comment and no one can,

2945
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:33,793
but it's this.
There's something that's going on where 

2946
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:39,290
this I would hope and I.
This is what I always hope.

2947
02:12:39,530 --> 02:12:43,460
I always hope that any wave that goes 
this way eventually goes that way.

2948
02:12:43,580 --> 02:12:46,970
And I hope that any outrage leads to 
more understanding.

2949
02:12:47,090 --> 02:12:49,760
Yeah man,
all of this stuff and all of this,

2950
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:50,833
especially this fucking rape shit,
that I feel like there's more rape talk 

2951
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:55,363
today and more understanding of how many
girls get approached or fucked with or 

2952
02:12:59,901 --> 02:13:00,734
harassed or even actually raped or 
drugged than we ever thought before 

2953
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:05,413
that.
I'm hoping this conversation leads to 

2954
02:13:08,450 --> 02:13:09,283
more understanding early on in people's 
lives before they formed this idea of 

2955
02:13:12,891 --> 02:13:14,570
what is and isn't acceptable.

2956
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:15,523
Yeah.
Because that's a good thing from it is 

2957
02:13:16,511 --> 02:13:19,490
it is making people be like,
you can't treat women this way,

2958
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:20,080
especially

2959
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:20,913
young kids here at early for sure,
but hear it when you're young so that 

2960
02:13:23,911 --> 02:13:24,744
you don't ever grow up in some sort of 
an environment where the people around 

2961
02:13:27,091 --> 02:13:31,040
you tell you it's okay that it's us 
versus them and fuck those bitches.

2962
02:13:31,510 --> 02:13:32,343
Whoa.
There's a lot of people grow up with 

2963
02:13:33,931 --> 02:13:35,280
that.
I know and it's like,

2964
02:13:35,281 --> 02:13:37,830
you want to be so good that women want 
to fuck you.

2965
02:13:37,831 --> 02:13:40,180
That's what makes civilization grows.
It's the.

2966
02:13:40,240 --> 02:13:41,160
It's the move.
Dude.

2967
02:13:41,161 --> 02:13:42,900
You know what?
I can say beethoven by ear.

2968
02:13:42,930 --> 02:13:46,020
You think it wasn't for someone to take.
I had a great penis.

2969
02:13:46,050 --> 02:13:46,561
No,
I'm just kidding.

2970
02:13:46,561 --> 02:13:48,030
I started when I was three.
I didn't know what I was doing.

2971
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:52,470
You did somehow knew that you were a 
male identified as a piano player.

2972
02:13:53,190 --> 02:13:57,180
I always say be the man that you pretend
to be when you're trying to get laid.

2973
02:13:57,270 --> 02:13:59,280
That's awesome.
Just be that guy.

2974
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:01,020
We can all do that.
And by the way,

2975
02:14:01,170 --> 02:14:05,040
if you weren't that guy two weeks ago 
and someone keeps sticking to your face,

2976
02:14:05,190 --> 02:14:07,530
it doesn't mean you're not that guy now.
Alright,

2977
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:08,453
relax.
Everybody relaxed with the finger 

2978
02:14:09,781 --> 02:14:10,614
pointing.
Like if some dude make some sort of a 

2979
02:14:12,991 --> 02:14:13,824
terrible mistake,
goes off the rails a month ago or 

2980
02:14:15,901 --> 02:14:19,760
whatever it is,
just it doesn't mean that he's not.

2981
02:14:19,950 --> 02:14:22,620
He's,
he's an ineffective process.

2982
02:14:22,770 --> 02:14:23,603
He's a trial and error process and you 
can't judge someone tiredly by the 

2983
02:14:26,851 --> 02:14:28,500
errors,
forgiveness and growth.

2984
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:31,310
It's also like you gotta,
you gotta,

2985
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:35,130
judge the whole thing as a big picture.
You can't say,

2986
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,113
you know,
in 2001 arnold schwartzenegger pulled 

2987
02:14:39,061 --> 02:14:40,790
out his dick and a sauna.
Yeah.

2988
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:41,713
AnD he was jacked up.
He's trying to beat some people in 

2989
02:14:43,681 --> 02:14:46,620
weightlifting that was probably trying 
to have a psychological and intimidates.

2990
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:48,930
I went to.
I made love to hook this.

2991
02:14:48,931 --> 02:14:51,720
You want to touch the deq word goal 
happen.

2992
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:52,613
You think you can clean and press.
You think you can fit this in your 

2993
02:14:54,931 --> 02:14:56,490
mouth.
You're less of a man.

2994
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:57,633
And the woman is a woman.
And another thing is we can't keep 

2995
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:02,153
calling men like toxic because men,
good men keep these fucking shitty 

2996
02:15:07,681 --> 02:15:08,514
rapist men beaten down.
Somebody put this on a fucking poll the 

2997
02:15:11,041 --> 02:15:13,290
other day and they Sent it to me.
Somebody put,

2998
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:17,130
they saw a photo of it or they saw an 
image of it and they send it to me.

2999
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:18,780
Whether they tooK it themselves.
It said,

3000
02:15:19,140 --> 02:15:21,480
eliminate masculinity.
Ah,

3001
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:27,280
listen,
when the vikings come and do that,

3002
02:15:27,451 --> 02:15:28,284
good a need.
Men in the most masculine guys I know 

3003
02:15:30,421 --> 02:15:32,550
are the least likely to fucking rape 
anybody.

3004
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:34,770
They're the ones that defend women.
Well,

3005
02:15:34,771 --> 02:15:36,500
there's a few women are attracted to.

3006
02:15:36,610 --> 02:15:37,443
Yeah,
there's,

3007
02:15:37,810 --> 02:15:40,290
there's some dark law.
And you know what?

3008
02:15:40,350 --> 02:15:42,090
Here's the thing about a lot of those 
dark people,

3009
02:15:42,260 --> 02:15:44,020
the dark,
like the color.

3010
02:15:44,110 --> 02:15:45,840
I mean he meant pigment john.
I didn't,

3011
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:46,733
I didn't,
I didn't.

3012
02:15:47,170 --> 02:15:48,750
The dark mindset,
the,

3013
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:49,593
the predatorY rapist mindset.
There's a ton of those people that come 

3014
02:15:54,841 --> 02:15:59,310
directly from trauma that come from 
being violated themselves.

3015
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:00,293
TheY come from being in bad situations.
They come from being programmed 

3016
02:16:03,241 --> 02:16:05,070
incorrectly and exempt.
Again.

3017
02:16:05,071 --> 02:16:07,710
I'm not exonerating them.
I'm not excusing them.

3018
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:08,753
I'm just thinking that it would do us 
all a world of good if we could look at 

3019
02:16:11,851 --> 02:16:14,070
these people from afar.
I didn't experience that.

3020
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:16,320
I didn't grow up in a familY filled with
crime.

3021
02:16:16,350 --> 02:16:19,570
I didn't grow up in a family filled with
violence and murder and,

3022
02:16:19,590 --> 02:16:19,990
and,
and,

3023
02:16:19,990 --> 02:16:22,650
and I did a neighborhood filled with 
people robbing people left and right.

3024
02:16:22,651 --> 02:16:23,484
I didn't grow up with thAt.
So my looking at it as a complete third 

3025
02:16:26,791 --> 02:16:30,430
party outsider.
but I'm thinking I try

3026
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:35,430
to pretend to imagine what it was like 
to grow up in watts in the 19 sixties.

3027
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:36,633
Yeah.
Try to pretend what it was like to be 

3028
02:16:38,220 --> 02:16:40,360
incompetent in the nineties.
TrY to pretend.

3029
02:16:40,361 --> 02:16:41,194
Well this is where I think transcends 
that is still cruelty because like all 

3030
02:16:43,991 --> 02:16:47,560
hang with legit gang members and feel 
safe when you're hanging with cameras.

3031
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:48,433
Well I'll do like cleveland and bravo 
and then afterwards I'm smokinG blondes 

3032
02:16:51,911 --> 02:16:53,710
with like dudes that I,
you know,

3033
02:16:53,711 --> 02:16:57,430
have leveland improv has gang members 
waiting for some fucking people.

3034
02:16:57,431 --> 02:16:58,264
Man.
It's like,

3035
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:00,310
you know,
someone's wearing a bulls hat and a city

3036
02:17:00,311 --> 02:17:01,144
without red or like someone's got 
teardrop tattoos and like I don't feel 

3037
02:17:05,201 --> 02:17:07,960
scared because I don't like if they have
a body count,

3038
02:17:07,961 --> 02:17:08,794
it's because of threats and business.
It's not like cruelty and I think that 

3039
02:17:12,371 --> 02:17:14,890
there's even in like fucked up 
environments,

3040
02:17:14,891 --> 02:17:18,070
you still have the cruel man and the 
good man,

3041
02:17:18,071 --> 02:17:22,330
even if they like do things that you 
don't agree with in your social economic

3042
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:22,790
area.

3043
02:17:22,790 --> 02:17:24,070
THat's the hero's journey,
right?

3044
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:28,780
The strong person that's kind enough to 
take care of the people that are weak.

3045
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:30,640
That's what the,
what everybody wants,

3046
02:17:30,641 --> 02:17:31,474
right?
As someone who is a strong person that 

3047
02:17:32,261 --> 02:17:33,094
looks out for the week person,
which is why everybody like the term 

3048
02:17:36,311 --> 02:17:38,410
bully,
which I think it's overused,

3049
02:17:38,550 --> 02:17:41,290
like sometimes bullying gets used when 
people are equals in.

3050
02:17:41,291 --> 02:17:42,670
When someone is critiquing someone,
oh,

3051
02:17:42,671 --> 02:17:43,960
you're a bully.
I go,

3052
02:17:44,830 --> 02:17:46,480
listen,
I just think that's stupid.

3053
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:49,140
That doesn't make me a bullet.
You're using it wrong.

3054
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:51,160
This is not.
We're not talking about children.

3055
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:53,650
We're not talking about people that are 
physically weaker than me.

3056
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:54,753
Like let's,
let's be clear about what the fuck we 

3057
02:17:56,051 --> 02:17:58,270
mean when we say this very polarizing 
word,

3058
02:17:58,500 --> 02:17:59,333
but that word is polarizing because we 
absolutely don't want to be the person 

3059
02:18:02,771 --> 02:18:05,740
that's in the position of physical,
moral,

3060
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:07,390
ethical,
economic,

3061
02:18:07,391 --> 02:18:08,224
whatever it is,
superiority who has influence over the 

3062
02:18:09,941 --> 02:18:12,820
other person's life and steps in and 
fucks with it.

3063
02:18:12,940 --> 02:18:14,200
yeah,
that's what it.

3064
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:15,970
That's what a bully is.
Spine,

3065
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:17,800
okay.
With passion can be like,

3066
02:18:17,801 --> 02:18:20,200
fuck these people and people are like,
okay,

3067
02:18:20,201 --> 02:18:24,070
even if you're a little off the mark,
you're not trying to hurt people to make

3068
02:18:24,071 --> 02:18:25,960
yourself feel better for your own 
inadequacies.

3069
02:18:25,961 --> 02:18:27,790
That's what's evil.
Or if you are,

3070
02:18:27,791 --> 02:18:29,770
you need to understand that that's what 
you're doing,

3071
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:30,880
right?
because we're all equal.

3072
02:18:30,881 --> 02:18:32,830
We're all evil and good.
Just make the move.

3073
02:18:32,860 --> 02:18:36,100
But also just to have someone like 
pointed out makes you go,

3074
02:18:36,340 --> 02:18:37,990
am I like and think about it?
You,

3075
02:18:37,991 --> 02:18:42,250
you're not necessarily your words and 
your actions,

3076
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:43,203
which you are as how you've dealt with 
your past words and actions and make 

3077
02:18:47,591 --> 02:18:48,401
corrections.
I mean,

3078
02:18:48,401 --> 02:18:49,690
that's,
that's really what you are.

3079
02:18:50,140 --> 02:18:50,973
I mean that's.
And that's what's really important 

3080
02:18:52,060 --> 02:18:53,920
because if we don't give people that 
leeway,

3081
02:18:53,921 --> 02:18:56,650
they don't ever learn from their 
mistakes.

3082
02:18:56,820 --> 02:18:57,653
they don't ever learn from their 
mistakes than we were essentially 

3083
02:19:01,241 --> 02:19:05,530
committing to a future with no one 
learning anything.

3084
02:19:05,830 --> 02:19:06,960
Right?
Yeah.

3085
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:11,110
And it's like I gave on dave smith and 
steven crowder both this a compliment.

3086
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:11,973
It's like,
because even if you disagree with 

3087
02:19:12,491 --> 02:19:14,860
someone,
the thing I love about people is like if

3088
02:19:14,861 --> 02:19:15,694
you make a good point,
they look excited and happy versus 

3089
02:19:18,461 --> 02:19:19,294
threatened.
Even if you're not on the path that I'm 

3090
02:19:21,521 --> 02:19:22,354
on,
you're still trying to like carve your 

3091
02:19:24,011 --> 02:19:28,190
fucking sculpture with it to look 
beautiful and not a threatening posture.

3092
02:19:28,230 --> 02:19:29,570
Yeah.
And that has nothing to do with the left

3093
02:19:29,571 --> 02:19:31,610
or the right.
I mean it's really Just how you approach

3094
02:19:31,611 --> 02:19:32,540
information.
Yeah.

3095
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:33,890
To all 100 percent.
Yeah.

3096
02:19:33,891 --> 02:19:34,724
Because I think a lot of times people 
from the right do not want to accept 

3097
02:19:38,481 --> 02:19:41,300
good ideas from the left and vice verse.
I think that's just a,

3098
02:19:41,301 --> 02:19:42,950
that's a real issue that people have.

3099
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:46,910
And that's a weakness too.
It is a weakness and I've experienced it

3100
02:19:46,911 --> 02:19:50,150
from my own mind and I'm sure you have 
from yours,

3101
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:51,350
bro.
You've seen my twitter.

3102
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:52,723
Everybody has.
It's important that we realize like 

3103
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:56,144
what,
what is that reaction that we had and 

3104
02:19:57,681 --> 02:19:58,514
how do we,
how do we mitigate the negative aspects 

3105
02:20:00,171 --> 02:20:01,004
of it and how do we figure out how we 
got to that point where we said 

3106
02:20:03,291 --> 02:20:05,480
something maybe we didn't believe or we,
we,

3107
02:20:05,481 --> 02:20:06,121
you know,
we,

3108
02:20:06,121 --> 02:20:10,670
we reacted to something in a way where 
if given time to reconsider our,

3109
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:12,890
you know,
the potential going this way with it are

3110
02:20:12,891 --> 02:20:15,020
that way with it,
we'd probably come up with a better idea

3111
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:17,960
and a cool thing you do for men,
especially men,

3112
02:20:17,961 --> 02:20:18,794
because I could speak on behalf of men 
because I identify with the winter and 

3113
02:20:20,031 --> 02:20:20,840
balls.
Thank you.

3114
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:21,730
It's like you,
you,

3115
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:24,470
you make people think about their 
actions where it's like,

3116
02:20:25,030 --> 02:20:27,500
but I think about mine,
think about yours too,

3117
02:20:27,501 --> 02:20:30,020
which is why we gravitate to each other 
100 percent where it's like,

3118
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:31,340
is this good?

3119
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:33,680
Is this,
is this productive for me,

3120
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:37,160
my family society?
Like what exactly am I doing right now?

3121
02:20:37,161 --> 02:20:39,260
And it's like,
and with my recent shit,

3122
02:20:39,261 --> 02:20:40,490
like some people are like,
oh,

3123
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,960
how's your wife feel about your spiral?
I'm like,

3124
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:44,650
spiral.
I'm like,

3125
02:20:44,660 --> 02:20:47,540
she's never wanted to fuck me more.
Do you tribute your twitter numbers?

3126
02:20:47,541 --> 02:20:49,730
Keep going up to I know my where's the 
spiral?

3127
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:50,870
I know and I'm like,
oh,

3128
02:20:50,910 --> 02:20:53,570
I'm representing a group of people that 
they keep writing me emails.

3129
02:20:53,571 --> 02:20:57,080
Like thank you so much for not calling 
me just evil for my,

3130
02:20:57,340 --> 02:20:58,610
like what I,
you know,

3131
02:20:58,611 --> 02:21:02,720
my basic beliefs because I'm not 
supporting racist,

3132
02:21:02,721 --> 02:21:03,710
sexist,
bigoted,

3133
02:21:03,711 --> 02:21:05,390
homophobe kay kay kay,
you know,

3134
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:07,790
it's fucking crazy dude.
And it's like,

3135
02:21:08,050 --> 02:21:09,570
and I'm not going to fall in that trap 
either.

3136
02:21:09,571 --> 02:21:10,210
where I'm like,
oh,

3137
02:21:10,210 --> 02:21:12,080
I'm jewish grandmother,
my wife's hispanic,

3138
02:21:12,081 --> 02:21:13,280
my piano teacher's fucking trans.

3139
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:14,390
It's like,
no,

3140
02:21:14,391 --> 02:21:15,224
my idea is strong and I don't need to 
justify it with my association with 

3141
02:21:18,291 --> 02:21:21,620
people that you fucking could have 
justified it.

3142
02:21:21,650 --> 02:21:24,350
And with good reason like it really 
does.

3143
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:25,960
It is a trump card.
When you say,

3144
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:27,530
look,
my dad's probably gay.

3145
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:28,250
Hey,
look,

3146
02:21:28,250 --> 02:21:30,200
my dad wears outfits that are 
questionable,

3147
02:21:30,201 --> 02:21:31,520
but he's a loving man.
Hey,

3148
02:21:31,550 --> 02:21:34,550
look,
my my piano teacher used to be a dude,

3149
02:21:34,590 --> 02:21:36,860
a woman as a woman.
Now dude.

3150
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:38,270
Yeah,
I became aware of same thing.

3151
02:21:38,420 --> 02:21:39,460
It's all good.
it's all there.

3152
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:43,170
Like,
like hispanic and crane.

3153
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:45,370
Spanish like home depot,
mexican.

3154
02:21:45,380 --> 02:21:47,210
Yeah.
Anybody,

3155
02:21:47,890 --> 02:21:49,700
anybody that calls you a white 
supremacist like,

3156
02:21:49,730 --> 02:21:52,430
okay,
I see what you're trying to do and it is

3157
02:21:52,431 --> 02:21:56,210
so transparent that it minimizes 
everything you're ever going to say ever

3158
02:21:56,211 --> 02:21:58,370
from this point on,
on this subject,

3159
02:21:58,490 --> 02:22:00,050
because I always have to think,
well,

3160
02:22:00,051 --> 02:22:02,100
you're intentions are disingenuous.
Well,

3161
02:22:02,101 --> 02:22:05,240
you're trying to do is divert people 
from tHe actual reality.

3162
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:08,270
so this shaun king guy,
maybe he's a really good guy.

3163
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:10,250
He's just a white guy,
is a dickhead.

3164
02:22:10,310 --> 02:22:14,320
Well he's a white guy.
Maybe he's a good guy.

3165
02:22:14,321 --> 02:22:15,154
It could be an albino nigerian.
I don't think he's that and I don't 

3166
02:22:17,031 --> 02:22:17,864
think so either.
It looks just like his dad and his 

3167
02:22:18,711 --> 02:22:22,570
brother.
Maybe he's a really good guy and this is

3168
02:22:22,571 --> 02:22:23,404
just.
He hangs out with the wrong people and 

3169
02:22:24,960 --> 02:22:26,040
as the wrong ideas in his

3170
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,873
head and he's followed the wrong 
operating system to a in a logical 

3171
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:32,993
perspective where the only way to 
disagree with is to call you a guy 

3172
02:22:36,631 --> 02:22:39,900
married to a home depot mexican or white
supremacist.

3173
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:44,760
It's okay.
I know you love your wife joe.

3174
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:45,623
Of course.
I know like she doesn't work at home 

3175
02:22:47,491 --> 02:22:48,660
depot.
She works at lowe's.

3176
02:22:48,680 --> 02:22:49,830
I know.
Listen,

3177
02:22:49,831 --> 02:22:52,770
I've known you for a long time.
You're the opposite of a racist.

3178
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:53,910
You're just not.
Yeah.

3179
02:22:53,911 --> 02:22:56,250
It's so fucked up.
Like right now in 2070.

3180
02:22:56,251 --> 02:22:57,084
It's like if you're truly not,
you sound almost racist because you're 

3181
02:22:59,791 --> 02:23:00,900
like,
you're like,

3182
02:23:00,901 --> 02:23:02,470
if I'm going to make fun of the why's,
that make it fun.

3183
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:05,010
Everybody knowing that.
Like if you stand up and say,

3184
02:23:05,011 --> 02:23:05,844
hey,
you can't just openly make fun of all 

3185
02:23:06,991 --> 02:23:09,060
white people,
that's fucking racist.

3186
02:23:09,061 --> 02:23:10,830
Too stupid to do.
I'm going to talk about,

3187
02:23:10,831 --> 02:23:12,250
you know,
your employment record.

3188
02:23:12,250 --> 02:23:13,083
Dude.
I saw this lady's tweets and I did not 

3189
02:23:14,701 --> 02:23:16,560
retweet it.
I thought about retweet and I'm like,

3190
02:23:16,561 --> 02:23:18,650
I should fucking turn some fire on this 
bitch.

3191
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:20,070
Bitch,
well thAt's what I'm for it.

3192
02:23:20,490 --> 02:23:21,870
no doubt.
Turn up the heat.

3193
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:22,341
Well,
okay.

3194
02:23:22,341 --> 02:23:23,174
I don't want to do.
I don't want to be the guys dms get 

3195
02:23:24,511 --> 02:23:28,080
discovered and finds out up and secretly
plotting against radical feminists,

3196
02:23:28,410 --> 02:23:33,250
but this lady wrote,
she wrote all white cisgendered.

3197
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:36,000
If you don't know what cis gender it is,
it's not real,

3198
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:37,013
but with heterosexual men who are 
actually heterosexual today is the way 

3199
02:23:41,971 --> 02:23:44,010
to marginalize normal people.
That's another mcdonald's.

3200
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:49,610
All white cis gendered men are shit 
unless proven otherwise.

3201
02:23:50,540 --> 02:23:51,373
Okay honey,
you might be a cut cut and I know you 

3202
02:23:54,751 --> 02:23:57,470
don't want to be a con,
but you probably like,

3203
02:23:57,630 --> 02:23:58,463
I don't.
Maybe it's the geometry of your nasal 

3204
02:24:00,991 --> 02:24:04,350
passage to cheekbone,
to chin structure.

3205
02:24:04,350 --> 02:24:05,183
Maybe you got crooked teeth,
maybe you're on athletic and guys don't 

3206
02:24:08,401 --> 02:24:09,234
want to fuck you.
Maybe you've dealt with all the wrong 

3207
02:24:10,681 --> 02:24:12,210
guy.
maybe a perfect genetics.

3208
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:16,380
Maybe your brain is accelerated.
Maybe you look at me like I'm stupid ape

3209
02:24:16,381 --> 02:24:18,210
that I am.
I don't know what the answer is,

3210
02:24:18,250 --> 02:24:22,610
but you can't say that now have no 
repercussions for your actions.

3211
02:24:22,611 --> 02:24:23,444
You can't say all white straight men who
identify as men are shit until proven 

3212
02:24:29,491 --> 02:24:32,710
otherwise because that is crazy.
Was racist,

3213
02:24:32,711 --> 02:24:33,770
sexist,
racist,

3214
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:34,613
homophobic,
and it's stupid because if that was the 

3215
02:24:36,781 --> 02:24:37,950
case,
if we were all shit,

3216
02:24:38,130 --> 02:24:43,130
it would be a damn rape festival in the 
streets of every major city all over the

3217
02:24:43,951 --> 02:24:44,784
world.
If you really thought that we were all 

3218
02:24:46,111 --> 02:24:48,990
bad,
let me tell you what all bad looks like.

3219
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:50,213
All bad looks like the world filled with
coked up vikings just running through 

3220
02:24:55,201 --> 02:24:57,540
this tree mouth.
Fucking everybody you've ever met.

3221
02:24:57,780 --> 02:25:00,900
That's what men can do,
and I'm not bragging,

3222
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:02,820
but that's what if you're.
If you,

3223
02:25:02,910 --> 02:25:03,743
if you have lingerie on and you can 
close your eyes and walk through a 

3224
02:25:07,711 --> 02:25:10,440
football field in front of a large 
crowd,

3225
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:15,840
one of them cheerleaders for like 
football and no one just tackles you and

3226
02:25:15,841 --> 02:25:19,440
starts fucking you in front of when that
is,

3227
02:25:19,441 --> 02:25:24,130
because most people don't want that to 
happen.

3228
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:25,150
That's why.
Well,

3229
02:25:25,151 --> 02:25:25,984
I'm convinced that's why they keep 
coming at like white american dudes 

3230
02:25:28,961 --> 02:25:31,300
because we were some of the most chill 
guys name,

3231
02:25:31,301 --> 02:25:33,340
but we've done some know.
There's some fucked up shit,

3232
02:25:33,341 --> 02:25:34,174
but they're,
they're coming at us for a reason and I 

3233
02:25:35,290 --> 02:25:38,050
want to say us now,
we don't have a rape culture though.

3234
02:25:38,051 --> 02:25:38,570
We,
we,

3235
02:25:38,570 --> 02:25:40,570
we see a rapist.
We go fuck that guy,

3236
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:41,633
but there is a lot of rape,
but the problem is uNtil now there 

3237
02:25:45,491 --> 02:25:50,390
wasn't enough of an ability to express 
what written and on both sides,

3238
02:25:50,391 --> 02:25:52,210
like some people call things raped.
That's like,

3239
02:25:52,211 --> 02:25:53,044
wait a minute window.
You were both drunk and it was 

3240
02:25:54,311 --> 02:25:55,990
consensual,
but It's rain say ruin.

3241
02:25:55,991 --> 02:25:56,824
A dude's life falls for.
That's happened and I had fattiest 

3242
02:25:59,111 --> 02:25:59,944
russell on.
He was talking about the incident 

3243
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:04,630
occidental college where a man and a 
woman it technically,

3244
02:26:04,631 --> 02:26:06,660
they're both lIke over 18.
They di,

3245
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:09,430
they got drunk,
they decided to have sex.

3246
02:26:09,431 --> 02:26:11,180
the girl called,
the guy texted him,

3247
02:26:11,181 --> 02:26:12,700
you have condoms.
The whole deal.

3248
02:26:12,850 --> 02:26:13,683
They agreed to get together and after 
the fact the girls friends decided that 

3249
02:26:19,151 --> 02:26:21,730
it was sexual assault because she was 
intoxicated,

3250
02:26:21,880 --> 02:26:25,270
not even taking into account.
They were both intoxicated,

3251
02:26:25,290 --> 02:26:26,123
right?
Both agreed and there was text messages 

3252
02:26:27,581 --> 02:26:28,414
back and forth.

3253
02:26:30,160 --> 02:26:34,100
Remorse does not equal rape.
Having a bad experience.

3254
02:26:34,101 --> 02:26:34,934
Percent.
yeah.

3255
02:26:35,230 --> 02:26:39,700
Both for the guy and the girl.
I mean it's just like people fuck up and

3256
02:26:39,701 --> 02:26:40,534
they make mistakes so you get it.
You got to figure out what is and what 

3257
02:26:42,791 --> 02:26:43,624
isn't.
And with thaddeus was talking about was 

3258
02:26:45,431 --> 02:26:47,920
that the girl went back to school with 
no repercussions,

3259
02:26:47,921 --> 02:26:52,000
but the boy was sober.
Life is over cross.

3260
02:26:52,060 --> 02:26:52,893
there were two people who are attracted 
to each other who were exchanging text 

3261
02:26:56,171 --> 02:26:57,004
messages,
who were influenced by the ideals and 

3262
02:26:59,410 --> 02:26:59,921
the,
the,

3263
02:26:59,921 --> 02:27:00,754
the ideology of all the people around 
them do it and how the media just like 

3264
02:27:07,210 --> 02:27:08,043
hits trump so hard that sometimes I'm 
like back off so I can mock them a 

3265
02:27:10,661 --> 02:27:14,800
little where it's like.
Because I have that instinct of like,

3266
02:27:14,801 --> 02:27:16,000
dude,
I can't market guy.

3267
02:27:16,001 --> 02:27:18,430
Everyone's fucking unfairly calling 
shit.

3268
02:27:18,431 --> 02:27:19,600
he's not.
But it's like,

3269
02:27:19,601 --> 02:27:22,210
look at this guy who in occidental 
college,

3270
02:27:22,211 --> 02:27:23,044
I don't remember his name,
but look at this kid and then compare 

3271
02:27:24,491 --> 02:27:25,420
them to bill cosby.

3272
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:26,051
Exactly,
dude.

3273
02:27:26,051 --> 02:27:28,030
Exactly.
Real snakes.

3274
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:29,313
Let's call real rapist.
Real rapist and call an 18 year old kid 

3275
02:27:32,261 --> 02:27:34,120
who was drunk or I don't know how old he
is,

3276
02:27:34,150 --> 02:27:36,430
maybe he's 20 and a 20 year old gIrl 
who's drunk.

3277
02:27:36,580 --> 02:27:37,413
Call them kids,
call them kids who it's not like this 

3278
02:27:40,121 --> 02:27:42,860
guy drugged her and duct taped her.
Like let's,

3279
02:27:42,861 --> 02:27:43,694
let's look at what it really.
Is it really just two kids that got 

3280
02:27:46,331 --> 02:27:47,164
intoxicated and had intercourse with 
each other and then one of them felt 

3281
02:27:49,931 --> 02:27:50,980
bad.
god damn.

3282
02:27:50,981 --> 02:27:52,540
How many times do you feel bad about 
sex?

3283
02:27:52,750 --> 02:27:54,340
Because a lot.
Because It's almost like that,

3284
02:27:54,341 --> 02:27:54,850
that,
that,

3285
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:59,850
that thing of like the leprechaun,
like he got caught the leprechaun.

3286
02:28:00,130 --> 02:28:02,350
It's like an old parable.
It's real short.

3287
02:28:02,351 --> 02:28:03,184
I'm not going to drag on a parable,
but like elaborate guy got caught and 

3288
02:28:05,501 --> 02:28:06,170
he's like,
yeah,

3289
02:28:06,170 --> 02:28:07,120
I'll give you the treasure.

3290
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:11,110
It's under the tree with a ribbon on it.
So he put the ribbon on all the trees.

3291
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:14,320
So now the ribbon doesn't mean shit.
So everything's rape.

3292
02:28:14,321 --> 02:28:16,420
Rape isn't rape.
It's like if everything is racist,

3293
02:28:16,421 --> 02:28:18,160
racism isn't racism.
And you're like,

3294
02:28:18,161 --> 02:28:18,994
you're now taking away our ability to 
identify predators and it's a dude's 

3295
02:28:22,521 --> 02:28:23,360
like us.
It's like,

3296
02:28:23,390 --> 02:28:25,190
I promise ladies,
I promise you,

3297
02:28:25,191 --> 02:28:26,024
if,
if a guy breaks about rape will fuck 

3298
02:28:27,441 --> 02:28:30,020
that dude.
It's like no one likes that guy.

3299
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:32,930
You're in a small enough community where
people feel responsibility.

3300
02:28:33,350 --> 02:28:36,320
That's the big problem.
I read about this once.

3301
02:28:36,321 --> 02:28:37,154
This is a phrase called diffusion of 
responsibility that happens in a large 

3302
02:28:40,551 --> 02:28:42,230
group of people that see something 
happen.

3303
02:28:42,530 --> 02:28:43,363
Like there was a picture it genevieve,
where she got killed in front of 40 

3304
02:28:45,441 --> 02:28:47,360
people in New York city.
Exactly,

3305
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:51,890
exactly.
There was a picture of video rather from

3306
02:28:51,891 --> 02:28:52,724
chicago.

3307
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:54,770
Really recently.
See if you can find jamie.

3308
02:28:54,980 --> 02:28:59,540
We're a guy assaults a woman and he did 
it on a security camera.

3309
02:28:59,570 --> 02:29:04,130
He had kicked her and knocked her out.
I mean it was fucking awful.

3310
02:29:04,250 --> 02:29:07,550
I don't know what led to it,
but this guy punched her.

3311
02:29:07,640 --> 02:29:11,930
And then I mean like still skillfully 
head kicked her.

3312
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:14,780
Like he took martial arts before.
It's kod.

3313
02:29:14,930 --> 02:29:17,930
She falls down and a bunch of people 
walk over and start filming her.

3314
02:29:18,170 --> 02:29:20,420
She's as.
So this is one that I,

3315
02:29:20,421 --> 02:29:23,510
I don't think I retweeted because I 
think I'm not,

3316
02:29:23,610 --> 02:29:25,790
I'm not entirely sure if I remember 
correctly,

3317
02:29:25,791 --> 02:29:27,740
but I think I thought about retweet and 
I'm like,

3318
02:29:27,741 --> 02:29:29,360
look,
people don't need to see this.

3319
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:33,110
This is not something I want to promote.
And support was someone wrote,

3320
02:29:33,230 --> 02:29:34,063
this is like an episode of black mirror 
because this guy kicked this girl and 

3321
02:29:38,121 --> 02:29:41,210
instead of calling nine one one,
these people are filming this girl while

3322
02:29:41,211 --> 02:29:44,070
she's curled up in a.
Did you find it this,

3323
02:29:45,380 --> 02:29:45,680
it's.

3324
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:47,910
I don't even know if I want you to find 
it this,

3325
02:29:48,250 --> 02:29:49,083
but this girl curls up into a fetal 
position on the sidewalk and they're 

3326
02:29:51,951 --> 02:29:53,450
standing around her filming it.
Well,

3327
02:29:53,451 --> 02:29:54,284
I think,
I think a big political divide isn't 

3328
02:29:57,020 --> 02:29:58,520
good evil,
blah blah blah.

3329
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:02,030
It's population density.
It's like cities like what we're talking

3330
02:30:02,031 --> 02:30:03,710
about,
all these monkeys going by each other.

3331
02:30:03,711 --> 02:30:04,544
No one's eating each other's faces.
You want a powerful government to keep 

3332
02:30:07,011 --> 02:30:07,844
it chill.
But if you live in a place with a 40 

3333
02:30:09,231 --> 02:30:12,140
minute police response time,
it's about individuality.

3334
02:30:12,141 --> 02:30:15,680
And that's when he started going more 
libertarian because it's like,

3335
02:30:15,770 --> 02:30:18,500
well I have a gun in chickens,
you know,

3336
02:30:18,530 --> 02:30:19,363
versus like a big city where it's like,
we need a powerful government to keep 

3337
02:30:22,701 --> 02:30:23,920
everyone relaxed.
You know,

3338
02:30:23,930 --> 02:30:27,050
you can't always rely on daddy,
daddy,

3339
02:30:27,170 --> 02:30:28,003
daddy,
all dude.

3340
02:30:28,010 --> 02:30:30,350
I've seen what happened.
Fucking daddy doesn't do shit.

3341
02:30:30,350 --> 02:30:32,450
Daddy's a guy.
Wanted a job being daddy.

3342
02:30:32,810 --> 02:30:34,590
Yeah,
that's what police daddy is,

3343
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:35,451
please.
Daddy is.

3344
02:30:35,451 --> 02:30:38,760
I mean sometimes you get great guys and 
sometimes you get fooled.

3345
02:30:39,250 --> 02:30:40,083
It's like across the board.
Like you might run into the best guy 

3346
02:30:42,110 --> 02:30:46,220
ever when you're shopping at walgreens 
and you might run into a fucking moron.

3347
02:30:46,420 --> 02:30:47,750
You know?
And exactly man.

3348
02:30:47,751 --> 02:30:51,110
It's like a job needed to be filled.
And you might've hit the perfect guy.

3349
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:52,333
And I love the way you describe govs.
It's like it's the hardest job in the 

3350
02:30:54,861 --> 02:30:55,880
world,
the hardest,

3351
02:30:55,881 --> 02:30:57,360
the hardest soldier.
And then you,

3352
02:30:57,361 --> 02:30:59,150
you,
you meet cops are like,

3353
02:30:59,210 --> 02:31:00,890
god bless you man.
You're the greatest.

3354
02:31:00,891 --> 02:31:01,970
And anemia cops capture.
I'm like,

3355
02:31:02,360 --> 02:31:03,590
oh,
you wanted power.

3356
02:31:03,591 --> 02:31:04,940
Fuck you man.
And it's like,

3357
02:31:05,140 --> 02:31:06,920
it's,
it's such a hard job.

3358
02:31:06,921 --> 02:31:08,660
it's like teacher,
you know,

3359
02:31:08,661 --> 02:31:10,490
it's like all my family are teachers and
it's like,

3360
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:11,353
oh,
these are like,

3361
02:31:11,390 --> 02:31:12,223
oh,
throw away a job and it's going to be a 

3362
02:31:12,801 --> 02:31:13,371
teacher.
It's like,

3363
02:31:13,371 --> 02:31:14,204
oh,
you're going to educate the youth and 

3364
02:31:14,781 --> 02:31:17,690
cops are going to keep us safe.
Those are our fucking warrior heroes.

3365
02:31:17,691 --> 02:31:19,350
You know it.
You know what I mean?

3366
02:31:19,351 --> 02:31:20,160
THis is a very

3367
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:20,993
easy thing for me to say when I say I 
haven't had a bad experience with cops 

3368
02:31:24,540 --> 02:31:26,550
because I haven't,
I really haven't.

3369
02:31:26,551 --> 02:31:29,010
I mean I've had cops get mouthy with me 
before,

3370
02:31:29,011 --> 02:31:30,930
but I've always said,
no sir,

3371
02:31:31,260 --> 02:31:33,190
thank you very much.
So I've always been like,

3372
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:35,910
I've always like immediately try to 
diffuse the situation,

3373
02:31:35,911 --> 02:31:38,410
but I'm a white guy.
I,

3374
02:31:38,750 --> 02:31:41,520
you know,
I speak pretty calmly.

3375
02:31:41,521 --> 02:31:43,530
I am a comedian,
I'm an entertainer.

3376
02:31:43,531 --> 02:31:45,240
A lot of them know me from the ufc at 
this point.

3377
02:31:45,241 --> 02:31:47,640
It's almost like I'm out of the game 
right this point.

3378
02:31:47,641 --> 02:31:48,474
Like cops run into me,
like almost all cops are fans of the 

3379
02:31:50,371 --> 02:31:52,470
ufc.
So if I run into a cop,

3380
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:54,900
the cops like,
oh joe rogan,

3381
02:31:54,930 --> 02:31:55,621
hey,
what's up man?

3382
02:31:55,621 --> 02:31:56,071
I'm like,
hey,

3383
02:31:56,071 --> 02:31:57,660
what's up man?
And he realized like,

3384
02:31:57,690 --> 02:31:58,321
oh,
this is a guy,

3385
02:31:58,321 --> 02:32:00,510
I'm not a terrorist.
Like I'm not,

3386
02:32:00,511 --> 02:32:01,344
I'm not a criminal.

3387
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:02,600
I'm out of the,
the,

3388
02:32:02,610 --> 02:32:03,443
the confusion.
Like he doesn't have to worry about me 

3389
02:32:05,161 --> 02:32:06,690
shooting him in the head.
Oh totally.

3390
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:08,370
And shake his hand.
I'm like,

3391
02:32:08,371 --> 02:32:09,360
what's up brother?
How you doing?

3392
02:32:09,580 --> 02:32:10,650
Every.
And they were all good.

3393
02:32:10,651 --> 02:32:14,550
So I'm almost looking at it like a 
privileged outsider,

3394
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:17,430
but even when I was young,
because,

3395
02:32:17,431 --> 02:32:20,850
you know,
my actual biological dad was a cop.

3396
02:32:20,910 --> 02:32:22,110
I don't know him,
I never knew him,

3397
02:32:23,110 --> 02:32:26,700
knew him until I was like six got great 
genes and umbro but that.

3398
02:32:28,020 --> 02:32:28,853
But I,
when I was a kid I remember thinking 

3399
02:32:31,051 --> 02:32:31,884
like,
what a crazy job like he has to go out 

3400
02:32:32,641 --> 02:32:35,370
and that is fear,
fear,

3401
02:32:35,371 --> 02:32:36,204
fear.
It's also probably one of the reasons 

3402
02:32:37,531 --> 02:32:39,990
why that led him to be so fucked up,
you know?

3403
02:32:39,991 --> 02:32:42,330
And I never really like let him off the 
hook for that.

3404
02:32:42,331 --> 02:32:43,164
But I saw a lot of dark shit from my 
actual biological dad when I was a 

3405
02:32:46,051 --> 02:32:47,760
little kid,
like violent stuff.

3406
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:48,541
And I was like,
well,

3407
02:32:48,541 --> 02:32:53,541
of course he's lit.
He's a cop in New Jersey in 1967.

3408
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:57,480
Like how do you,
how do you not be fucking violent?

3409
02:32:57,510 --> 02:32:58,170
Like,
totally,

3410
02:32:58,170 --> 02:32:59,940
you're not going to live.
You're not going to survive.

3411
02:32:59,941 --> 02:33:01,280
You're,
you're on the front line.

3412
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:04,560
And then going from that to a martial 
arts,

3413
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:05,573
from the time I was 15 years old,
I was completely immersed in martial 

3414
02:33:08,911 --> 02:33:12,540
arts and I ran into a ton of cops and 
they were all like regular guys.

3415
02:33:12,700 --> 02:33:14,490
And it made me think like,
okay,

3416
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:15,870
this.
When I think of a cop,

3417
02:33:15,871 --> 02:33:18,480
I don't think of someone that I'm 
running into the trying to lock me up.

3418
02:33:18,630 --> 02:33:19,463
I think at some poor guy who has this 
position in life where he's the guy who 

3419
02:33:23,191 --> 02:33:24,024
has to put the badge on and hold the gun
and wear the stupid hat and stand in 

3420
02:33:27,331 --> 02:33:29,070
front of the criminal and go put your 
hands up.

3421
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:33,060
I hope he doesn't get shot by a guy 
behind him that he doesn't know exists.

3422
02:33:33,300 --> 02:33:34,133
And this is his life.
Twenty four slash seven all day long 

3423
02:33:36,601 --> 02:33:37,434
comes home to his kids their sleep and 
he kisses him on the head and he thinks 

3424
02:33:39,721 --> 02:33:43,400
about the kid that he saw shot in the 
apartment building in the bronx to it is

3425
02:33:43,410 --> 02:33:44,243
to think about that stuff.
It's like I'm boy with a lot of cops 

3426
02:33:46,111 --> 02:33:46,944
where I live and a lot of them are 
troopers who were really well trained 

3427
02:33:49,111 --> 02:33:51,810
and they're like the coolest dudes ever.
And they just,

3428
02:33:52,050 --> 02:33:52,883
it's almost like the cops emotion is 
just like where it's like you just 

3429
02:33:57,211 --> 02:33:59,100
microwave your fucking baby dude.
Yeah.

3430
02:33:59,150 --> 02:33:59,983
You know,
where it's like they see this shit and 

3431
02:34:01,651 --> 02:34:02,484
then like I do a benefits for like a 
tour de force and shit for like fallen 

3432
02:34:05,311 --> 02:34:08,820
officers and because I have so much 
compassion for that shit,

3433
02:34:08,821 --> 02:34:09,654
man.
It's like they are the watchdogs of our 

3434
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:15,330
area.
But then you get the bad seed or you get

3435
02:34:15,331 --> 02:34:18,010
someone who makes her horrific mistake 
and justice isn't

3436
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:21,490
given and that's why it's complicated.
And you know,

3437
02:34:21,491 --> 02:34:24,250
sometimes it's about like lawsuits where
it's like,

3438
02:34:24,251 --> 02:34:25,084
you know,
someone fucks up and no one wants to 

3439
02:34:26,591 --> 02:34:27,424
admit they're wrong.
And then the community that witnessed 

3440
02:34:29,561 --> 02:34:31,520
that,
it's like they want their,

3441
02:34:31,530 --> 02:34:33,640
like they would just want justice,
but let's also,

3442
02:34:33,641 --> 02:34:35,830
the punishment of fucking up is so 
extreme.

3443
02:34:36,010 --> 02:34:36,843
Oh my god.
Imagine if we bomb and we fucking 

3444
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:39,850
gilligan back.
You know,

3445
02:34:39,851 --> 02:34:43,300
it's like one of our jokes bombs and 
someone fucking kid dies.

3446
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:44,860
Oh,
that's why dude,

3447
02:34:45,070 --> 02:34:48,400
cops deserve a lot of respect to do it.
It's like it's a crazy job.

3448
02:34:48,430 --> 02:34:49,263
It's a crazy job and you're dealing with
pressure that most of us could never 

3449
02:34:52,061 --> 02:34:52,894
possibly imagine.
And the life and death decisions that 

3450
02:34:55,420 --> 02:34:56,253
happen at the blink of an eye and you 
are responsible for those decisions for 

3451
02:34:59,651 --> 02:35:00,484
the rest of your life.
And this is something that I talk about 

3452
02:35:02,501 --> 02:35:03,770
too much.
I got to piss so bad.

3453
02:35:04,180 --> 02:35:05,013
Jamie,
can you keep a conversation with owen 

3454
02:35:05,681 --> 02:35:07,060
benjamin?
I'm a lightweight.

3455
02:35:07,061 --> 02:35:10,930
I don't know how to hold mY pee anymore.
Bareback and malcolm gladwell's blink,

3456
02:35:11,330 --> 02:35:13,300
blink book.
Hold onto that thought.

3457
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:14,700
I will.
Hey jamie.

3458
02:35:14,701 --> 02:35:15,580
What's going down?
What's going on,

3459
02:35:15,581 --> 02:35:16,361
man?
Man,

3460
02:35:16,361 --> 02:35:18,030
he's about to pee out of his car and I

3461
02:35:18,220 --> 02:35:20,620
first time he's had to do this during a 
podcast.

3462
02:35:20,621 --> 02:35:22,150
I think so.
Rocktober fucked him up.

3463
02:35:22,180 --> 02:35:23,410
Yeah.
He never has to piss.

3464
02:35:23,470 --> 02:35:24,303
Never.
It's a three and a half hours or we're 

3465
02:35:25,650 --> 02:35:26,483
two and a half hours in to.
I think this one's going to go for 

3466
02:35:28,220 --> 02:35:29,410
awhile.
Yeah,

3467
02:35:29,411 --> 02:35:31,060
I was going to get you guys some more 
ice if you needed it.

3468
02:35:31,061 --> 02:35:32,890
So I fucking love rogan,
man.

3469
02:35:32,891 --> 02:35:36,790
He's such a good dude.
What are you looking at?

3470
02:35:37,270 --> 02:35:38,103
I had a couple of things pulled up to 
talk to you guys about talking to me 

3471
02:35:39,761 --> 02:35:40,940
about anything man.
Uh,

3472
02:35:41,090 --> 02:35:42,760
we were talking about south park before 
this.

3473
02:35:42,761 --> 02:35:44,320
Two of the greatest show ever made.
What's,

3474
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:45,233
what was goIng on?
And you said the halloween episode just 

3475
02:35:47,411 --> 02:35:48,244
happen.

3476
02:35:48,890 --> 02:35:50,100
Yeah,
it's about.

3477
02:35:50,310 --> 02:35:51,860
No,
It's a,

3478
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:53,660
you got to see the new south park.
It's a,

3479
02:35:53,780 --> 02:35:56,180
the,
the dudes drink jack and smoke crack.

3480
02:35:56,720 --> 02:35:58,190
That's not a,
that's not a spoiler.

3481
02:35:58,191 --> 02:36:00,560
It's the first act of the episode,
but definitely check it out.

3482
02:36:00,980 --> 02:36:03,780
I just think that sometimes people ask 
me where I,

3483
02:36:03,810 --> 02:36:04,643
where I land politically and I usually 
just tell them south park because it's 

3484
02:36:07,341 --> 02:36:08,174
like,
it's just as objective as you can 

3485
02:36:09,381 --> 02:36:13,940
probably get to the point where trey 
parker is like a fucking genius.

3486
02:36:14,710 --> 02:36:16,390
Awesome.
Such a big fan.

3487
02:36:16,391 --> 02:36:19,450
I wish he would come talk to us here one
time.

3488
02:36:19,550 --> 02:36:20,610
Um,
I got tripped.

3489
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:23,270
Tripped parker if you're listening,
you did hire me once.

3490
02:36:23,271 --> 02:36:25,520
A comic con in san diego.
I don't know if you remember that.

3491
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,070
Uh,
to host a thing.

3492
02:36:28,071 --> 02:36:30,110
So why don't you coMe on the rogan 
podcast?

3493
02:36:30,690 --> 02:36:31,523
Yeah.
They just had the new video game came 

3494
02:36:31,981 --> 02:36:32,814
out.
I don't know if I was trying to explain 

3495
02:36:33,811 --> 02:36:35,590
that to you that you were talkIng about 
that,

3496
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:38,040
about taking not taking shit.
The game's called fractured,

3497
02:36:38,041 --> 02:36:40,500
but whole.
Not butthole but the word,

3498
02:36:40,501 --> 02:36:43,710
but in the w,
h o l e o butthole.

3499
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:44,560
Exactly.
Play on.

3500
02:36:44,580 --> 02:36:48,000
It's profound,
but you have to take a shit.

3501
02:36:48,001 --> 02:36:52,440
And everybody's house all over the city 
to be mark making your mark

3502
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:53,433
did.
The thing I love about south park is 

3503
02:36:54,191 --> 02:36:57,940
that they go after everybody and that's 
why I have so Much respect for them,

3504
02:36:58,510 --> 02:36:59,343
you know,
they tried to go after islam as much as 

3505
02:37:00,461 --> 02:37:02,530
they want to after the mormons and 
that's why I'm lIke,

3506
02:37:02,531 --> 02:37:04,480
you guys are great,
you know,

3507
02:37:04,481 --> 02:37:05,314
because it's all about just like no one 
gets a pass because that's when you 

3508
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:09,370
create martyrs and shit.
You know?

3509
02:37:09,820 --> 02:37:13,690
I like doing podcasts way better,
high and stoned and drunk too.

3510
02:37:13,691 --> 02:37:15,740
This is fun.
Way more fun.

3511
02:37:17,060 --> 02:37:20,930
Sober october is important.
You know why just like running up a hill

3512
02:37:20,931 --> 02:37:22,850
is important because it makes you 
appreciate naps,

3513
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:26,810
dude,
in ways as I miss my weight fast.

3514
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:30,170
Yeah.
You got to do chin ups,

3515
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:34,130
weight vests if you important.
Champs more than pull ups a day.

3516
02:37:34,131 --> 02:37:36,980
They're both the same to me.
I just need pulling exercises.

3517
02:37:36,981 --> 02:37:38,000
I mean there's a bunch of different 
ones.

3518
02:37:38,001 --> 02:37:42,080
I actually have these things where the 
handle's rotate so we'll watch different

3519
02:37:42,081 --> 02:37:42,914
ways,
but it's just a matter of lifting your 

3520
02:37:44,661 --> 02:37:45,950
body weight.
I think,

3521
02:37:45,960 --> 02:37:48,380
uh,
when I talked about movement before,

3522
02:37:49,010 --> 02:37:49,843
it's one of the things that I got from 
this whole month of doing yoga and I 

3523
02:37:53,241 --> 02:37:57,170
knew I've been doing yoga pretty,
um,

3524
02:37:57,980 --> 02:38:00,350
pretty extensively or this guy's a 
switching back and forth.

3525
02:38:00,351 --> 02:38:01,310
That's a good move.
That tough.

3526
02:38:01,311 --> 02:38:02,510
I to ask you about that.
Yeah,

3527
02:38:02,511 --> 02:38:03,920
it's hard to do.
Yeah,

3528
02:38:03,980 --> 02:38:04,400
it's hard.

3529
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:07,370
It's hard to release.
It's because you're essentially throwing

3530
02:38:07,371 --> 02:38:09,860
yourself up and then exploding to catch 
yourself.

3531
02:38:10,100 --> 02:38:11,790
I wonder if he whacks off like that.
He says,

3532
02:38:11,900 --> 02:38:14,540
why not?
Why wouldn't you just keep switching?

3533
02:38:14,570 --> 02:38:16,370
What I learned from the yoga thing 
though,

3534
02:38:16,810 --> 02:38:18,560
and I've learned over the last few 
years,

3535
02:38:18,570 --> 02:38:21,020
is like,
it's a balance issue.

3536
02:38:21,050 --> 02:38:23,090
Like what yoga does is balance 
everything out,

3537
02:38:23,330 --> 02:38:26,420
not just balanced in terms of your 
ability to stand on one foot,

3538
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:30,890
but also balance the difference between 
the strength of your major muscle groups

3539
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:35,920
and then your tendons and your back and 
your core and the connecting things like

3540
02:38:36,021 --> 02:38:36,854
your knees and your hips and all these 
things that you never taken into 

3541
02:38:40,711 --> 02:38:41,544
consideration.
Like you don't really put a lot of 

3542
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:46,370
emphasis on when you do other things.
But when you do yoga,

3543
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:47,271
you realize,
oh,

3544
02:38:47,271 --> 02:38:49,250
my feet are giving out first,
huh?

3545
02:38:49,460 --> 02:38:51,470
Oh,
like my hips are getting sore when I get

3546
02:38:51,471 --> 02:38:52,550
into triangle pose,
like,

3547
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:53,570
oh my,
you know,

3548
02:38:53,660 --> 02:38:58,190
and all that different stuff that you do
that I'm like,

3549
02:38:58,191 --> 02:39:02,680
it leads to like the strength and the 
strengthening of uh,

3550
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:05,330
ignored aspects of the entire system

3551
02:39:05,660 --> 02:39:06,493
and it also keeps you off your phone.
Like I've been doing hot yoga with my 

3552
02:39:08,551 --> 02:39:13,551
wife and it's like,
it's so hard and she's so good at it and

3553
02:39:13,740 --> 02:39:14,573
like it's so funny because she'll do,
we'll do hot yoga together like once a 

3554
02:39:17,101 --> 02:39:17,934
week,
maybe twice a week and she'll get real 

3555
02:39:19,321 --> 02:39:22,490
horny and I'm getting real dehydrated.
So it's like that.

3556
02:39:22,650 --> 02:39:23,483
It's the most frustrating combination 
because it's like she gets really in 

3557
02:39:26,641 --> 02:39:29,460
touch with her body and she's so fucking
hot and it's like awesome.

3558
02:39:29,461 --> 02:39:30,271
But then I'm like,
oh,

3559
02:39:30,271 --> 02:39:32,250
I need about a gallon of water to make 
my cock.

3560
02:39:32,251 --> 02:39:33,084
Like,
awesome.

3561
02:39:33,510 --> 02:39:36,420
Well just drink that gallon of water.
I work on it.

3562
02:39:36,480 --> 02:39:39,240
But I usually,
I usually under bring water into the hot

3563
02:39:39,250 --> 02:39:39,430
air.

3564
02:39:39,430 --> 02:39:43,170
The key to the the yoga is you got to 
drink the water beforehand.

3565
02:39:43,530 --> 02:39:45,900
I'm usually hung over from the fucking 
pbrs.

3566
02:39:46,020 --> 02:39:47,430
Yeah,
you gotta drink,

3567
02:39:47,700 --> 02:39:49,400
especially the hot yoga.
You gotta drink.

3568
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:52,770
Try to drink like a leader,
like a leader of water,

3569
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:57,870
like maybe an hour before and even more.
I tried to drink.

3570
02:39:57,900 --> 02:40:01,510
What is 64 ounces.
How much does that have happened ago?

3571
02:40:01,720 --> 02:40:03,660
Ounces to leaders.
It's all confusing.

3572
02:40:03,930 --> 02:40:04,763
God,
I wish we would switch over to the 

3573
02:40:05,131 --> 02:40:05,964
metric system.

3574
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:10,070
It's way better than english fucking 
king.

3575
02:40:10,071 --> 02:40:12,700
That just screwed it for everybody.
Yeah,

3576
02:40:12,730 --> 02:40:13,563
I did it

3577
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:15,233
with his foot,
but we tried it again in the United 

3578
02:40:18,330 --> 02:40:21,810
States and I want to say the seventies 
or the eighties?

3579
02:40:21,930 --> 02:40:24,310
Two point seven liters per day.
Hold on.

3580
02:40:24,330 --> 02:40:26,880
Ninety one out.
Sixty four ounces of water per day.

3581
02:40:28,020 --> 02:40:30,510
Recommended we consume 91 ounces.
Okay,

3582
02:40:30,511 --> 02:40:31,344
so two point seven liters is 91 ounces,
so 64 liters is probably somewhere in 

3583
02:40:34,831 --> 02:40:37,380
the neighborhood of two leaders.
Oh yeah.

3584
02:40:37,410 --> 02:40:38,550
One point eight.
One point eight,

3585
02:40:38,551 --> 02:40:40,860
nine liters.
I think that's.

3586
02:40:41,060 --> 02:40:43,980
That's what I bring to yoga.
I bring a 64 ounce thing.

3587
02:40:44,190 --> 02:40:48,090
I think you can get that in the before 
class,

3588
02:40:48,091 --> 02:40:51,510
like if you could get up early and drink
water with lemon in it,

3589
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:54,570
you'll have a better performance because
there's literally like,

3590
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:55,473
like an.
I see it a lot from guys that get 

3591
02:40:56,881 --> 02:40:59,090
dehydrated and try to make weight.
You're,

3592
02:40:59,180 --> 02:41:00,013
you're literally dealing with the 
electrical signals that go to your 

3593
02:41:03,481 --> 02:41:06,510
muscles are not going to fire and brain 
and brain.

3594
02:41:06,510 --> 02:41:09,000
Yeah.
Like I got a camel pack and I crush it.

3595
02:41:09,010 --> 02:41:09,843
Why mowing my lawn?
Do you like a water bladder and with a 

3596
02:41:13,561 --> 02:41:14,700
straw?
Yeah,

3597
02:41:14,790 --> 02:41:15,720
I love it.
Yeah,

3598
02:41:15,721 --> 02:41:17,090
because they usually when I cross 
country skiing,

3599
02:41:17,091 --> 02:41:19,110
because if I pull my hand out of my 
glove,

3600
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:21,760
my hand freezes that.
Those are great for hiking too.

3601
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:23,430
Yeah.
And hot.

3602
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:27,300
If you're at a hot or cold weather at 
high climates,

3603
02:41:27,301 --> 02:41:30,210
at high altitudes,
I'll get dehydrated shit.

3604
02:41:30,220 --> 02:41:31,053
Like an aspen at the aspen comedy 
festival back in the day that day I'd 

3605
02:41:34,450 --> 02:41:37,440
have like three beers and be like,
I'm king of the world.

3606
02:41:37,470 --> 02:41:41,040
I did a show with lewis black and they 
had oxygen backstage for us.

3607
02:41:41,560 --> 02:41:42,330
Really?
I was like,

3608
02:41:42,330 --> 02:41:44,510
louis,
what the fuck is the oxygen for?

3609
02:41:44,650 --> 02:41:45,483
I guess if one of us goes to horror,
they slapped that fucking mask on your 

3610
02:41:48,631 --> 02:41:49,680
face.
I was like,

3611
02:41:49,681 --> 02:41:51,840
that's crazy to training up there.

3612
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:54,270
That's like where the olympics train and
shit sometimes.

3613
02:41:54,420 --> 02:41:57,600
Yeah,
because it's like a fucking dime for it.

3614
02:41:58,080 --> 02:42:00,340
Anytime you can get it high altitude,
it's just they,

3615
02:42:00,370 --> 02:42:05,220
they say you should actually work out at
low altitude but lived most of your life

3616
02:42:05,280 --> 02:42:07,320
at high altitude.
I'm at like 3000.

3617
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:08,950
That's good.
Thousands.

3618
02:42:09,180 --> 02:42:11,250
Definitely better than zero,
you know?

3619
02:42:11,251 --> 02:42:14,070
And um,
if you can get accustomed to that,

3620
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:14,933
they say,
I talked to a dude once when I lived in 

3621
02:42:16,171 --> 02:42:17,004
boulder and he told me that it takes 
three years for you to fully acclimate 

3622
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:21,113
to a high altitude,
but that once you do fully acclimate 

3623
02:42:23,731 --> 02:42:26,430
those like extreme,
like cardiovascular benefits,

3624
02:42:26,460 --> 02:42:28,650
well,
but you get a sweet boner.

3625
02:42:29,310 --> 02:42:31,980
Maybe not,
maybe that's the trade off.

3626
02:42:32,070 --> 02:42:34,610
You're going to run forever,
but your dick is always recorded mast.

3627
02:42:35,490 --> 02:42:39,920
That's what I miss about la is the beach
runs and then the people like dudes like

3628
02:42:39,930 --> 02:42:40,763
you and like just really brilliantly 
creative people and also the beach runs 

3629
02:42:44,911 --> 02:42:45,160
and shit.

3630
02:42:45,160 --> 02:42:48,120
It's the physical beauty ir.
I don't miss that entertainment industry

3631
02:42:48,121 --> 02:42:50,520
and the traffic was a different kind of 
beauty.

3632
02:42:50,521 --> 02:42:51,660
Right?
like you're in the mountains.

3633
02:42:51,830 --> 02:42:53,370
It's so gorgeous.
But I missed those.

3634
02:42:53,371 --> 02:42:58,371
Like the oxygen's zero fucking feet 
above sea level just running.

3635
02:42:58,381 --> 02:42:59,214
I,
we used to live in marina del rey and 

3636
02:43:00,481 --> 02:43:01,314
that path I just listened to dan carlin 
just listen about fucking genghis khan 

3637
02:43:05,131 --> 02:43:08,700
is I just run with my fucking camel pack
and that was a blast.

3638
02:43:08,890 --> 02:43:09,723
That's,
that's the thing about la that I think 

3639
02:43:10,621 --> 02:43:11,454
is really beautiful.
It's like the amount of biomes like 

3640
02:43:13,091 --> 02:43:14,710
mountain,
you know,

3641
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:18,250
there's some desert.
This I'm a beach or ocean.

3642
02:43:18,490 --> 02:43:19,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

3643
02:43:19,751 --> 02:43:21,670
I think you're right.
But I think um,

3644
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:24,910
you know,
if you have the ability to travel to all

3645
02:43:24,911 --> 02:43:25,990
of them,
you'll.

3646
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:26,853
Well I think you appreciated probably 
where you moved when you first moved 

3647
02:43:30,581 --> 02:43:30,730
there.

3648
02:43:30,730 --> 02:43:31,301
Right?
Yeah.

3649
02:43:31,301 --> 02:43:32,610
And I still love it though,
man.

3650
02:43:32,630 --> 02:43:33,510
Like now I'm like,
I'm,

3651
02:43:33,540 --> 02:43:35,770
I always miss it when I'm,
when I'm away from it,

3652
02:43:36,190 --> 02:43:37,990
but I know what you're saying.
Yeah,

3653
02:43:37,991 --> 02:43:39,160
it's easy,
right?

3654
02:43:39,190 --> 02:43:40,023
It's easy to get like real accustomed to
what you see right in front of your 

3655
02:43:43,031 --> 02:43:44,230
face.
Yeah.

3656
02:43:44,231 --> 02:43:47,260
And like I have so many memories now 
with my family there and my chicken just

3657
02:43:47,261 --> 02:43:48,094
giving me food everyday.
They just keep shooting out eggs and 

3658
02:43:50,860 --> 02:43:52,150
wolves up there either.
Right?

3659
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:54,300
We got coyotes and I've learned a lot 
about guide.

3660
02:43:54,301 --> 02:43:56,740
Who's from your podcast?
Dan flores.

3661
02:43:56,800 --> 02:43:57,541
Do you kill them?
They,

3662
02:43:57,541 --> 02:43:59,250
they multiple,
either like gremlins.

3663
02:43:59,290 --> 02:44:02,410
You can't kill coyotes.
So actually the worst thing you can do.

3664
02:44:02,690 --> 02:44:05,500
Well,
the things spread their range to me.

3665
02:44:05,670 --> 02:44:06,503
Uh,
there's a type of cat phisher fisher's 

3666
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:11,600
fisher cats to keep jacking my shit.
And uh,

3667
02:44:11,650 --> 02:44:13,600
foxes and raccoons are my enemies.

3668
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:17,170
Coyote is not so much.
Coyotes will get a chicken if they can,

3669
02:44:17,171 --> 02:44:20,500
but coyotes are smart.
There are oddly clever,

3670
02:44:20,770 --> 02:44:22,720
like they figured out how to avoid 
people.

3671
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:23,783
You know,
one of the things that I found most 

3672
02:44:24,791 --> 02:44:25,624
fascinating about dan flores book,
iod America was the mythology that the 

3673
02:44:31,091 --> 02:44:31,924
native americans had about coyotes,
that the coyote who was essentially a 

3674
02:44:35,321 --> 02:44:38,800
god and the kid was a god that was 
watching over you,

3675
02:44:38,830 --> 02:44:42,190
like watching what you did all the time,
constantly judging you and try.

3676
02:44:43,250 --> 02:44:44,083
It was really weird.
Like the native american and some 

3677
02:44:47,330 --> 02:44:48,163
tribes,
their interpretation of what a coyote 

3678
02:44:49,290 --> 02:44:50,560
was,
it was really fast.

3679
02:44:50,561 --> 02:44:51,394
I mean,
they're pretty powerful if like if they 

3680
02:44:52,631 --> 02:44:53,464
jack your chickens,
like sometimes like we were talking 

3681
02:44:54,761 --> 02:44:55,594
about empathy,
like what's it like to live a different 

3682
02:44:56,561 --> 02:44:57,490
life?
I'm like,

3683
02:44:57,491 --> 02:44:58,324
what if I needed these chickens?
Like I got more chickens but we had one 

3684
02:45:00,851 --> 02:45:04,150
chicken holocaust and I'm like,
we're fucked now.

3685
02:45:04,390 --> 02:45:07,240
Imagine if that was like the winter and 
like the chickens are gone.

3686
02:45:07,300 --> 02:45:09,220
It's like what do we eat?
But here's the thing,

3687
02:45:09,221 --> 02:45:11,700
you weren't fucked.
But the coyote is like,

3688
02:45:11,701 --> 02:45:12,534
this is.
I had a weird come to jesus moment when 

3689
02:45:14,591 --> 02:45:15,424
it came to coyotes when a coyote stole 
one of my chickens and I watched her 

3690
02:45:17,291 --> 02:45:21,510
talking about a tricky trick.
My dog called is a honeybee.

3691
02:45:21,650 --> 02:45:22,483
Does Johnny Cash?
Johnny cash is my mass mast if and 

3692
02:45:25,780 --> 02:45:29,610
Johnny Cash is a tank.
This is how fucked up Johnny Cash Johnny

3693
02:45:29,610 --> 02:45:32,100
Cash got into the chicken coop just like
honey.

3694
02:45:32,150 --> 02:45:34,810
A couple of months ago,
just a couple of months ago,

3695
02:45:34,811 --> 02:45:39,811
Johnny Cash tore through the chicken 
wire with his paws and got in and it was

3696
02:45:41,111 --> 02:45:43,400
a chicken holocaust in there.
Killed.

3697
02:45:43,480 --> 02:45:44,490
Who's eating them?
Yeah,

3698
02:45:44,500 --> 02:45:46,390
he killed like four chickens in one 
setting.

3699
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:49,180
It was a disaster and I saw him in my 
underwear.

3700
02:45:49,210 --> 02:45:50,043
I went outside.
I was like looked out the window and I 

3701
02:45:52,151 --> 02:45:52,984
looked.
I saw the fuck and I ran downstairs in 

3702
02:45:55,211 --> 02:45:57,520
my underwear,
yanked him out of the chicken coop.

3703
02:45:57,521 --> 02:46:01,180
I pick them up and throw him outside.
He's fucking 12.

3704
02:46:01,450 --> 02:46:03,160
He's an old man.
Good for him.

3705
02:46:03,161 --> 02:46:06,670
But he's still getting after it.
Just getting that.

3706
02:46:06,671 --> 02:46:08,880
Did you do like name your chickens and 
get bumbling?

3707
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,033
Well,
I don't but my wife fucking clunky and 

3708
02:46:12,621 --> 02:46:13,454
fucking meredith and shit.
Prince's petunia princess between you 

3709
02:46:16,351 --> 02:46:21,351
got jacked by Johnny Cash a little fyi.
Dubai what names?

3710
02:46:21,471 --> 02:46:23,410
Like deer and shit,
like one spot.

3711
02:46:23,411 --> 02:46:24,244
And I'm like,
I think my brother wants to kill spot 

3712
02:46:25,281 --> 02:46:26,390
dude.
Fuck,

3713
02:46:26,420 --> 02:46:28,310
spot up.
Don't do that.

3714
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:29,240
You know?
But that's,

3715
02:46:29,240 --> 02:46:30,430
that's the thing.
It's like I,

3716
02:46:30,770 --> 02:46:32,660
if they were in my neighborhood I would,
I would,

3717
02:46:32,790 --> 02:46:33,623
I would probably name them too,
but I'm on the road a lot and that's 

3718
02:46:36,531 --> 02:46:38,420
what I know she misses me when she's 
like,

3719
02:46:38,690 --> 02:46:39,950
oh here comes david.

3720
02:46:39,950 --> 02:46:41,990
I'm like the raccoon,
raccoon.

3721
02:46:42,020 --> 02:46:47,020
It's always just a fucking animal spot.
Might have to go.

3722
02:46:47,360 --> 02:46:48,193
David might ask to go yet because my 
brother's getting into hunting now and 

3723
02:46:50,151 --> 02:46:54,040
like I think he wants to kill spot.
So you have taught you,

3724
02:46:54,100 --> 02:46:54,933
you talked about it before,
the podcast that you thought about 

3725
02:46:56,330 --> 02:46:58,670
actually getting into hunting yourself,
but you don't want to wound down.

3726
02:46:59,330 --> 02:47:02,680
It has to be a quick kill because I 
would love to hunt and,

3727
02:47:02,700 --> 02:47:03,533
and my wife wants me to hide because uh,
because my uncle hunts a lot and 

3728
02:47:06,561 --> 02:47:07,394
whenever we stay with him he's always 
got like pheasant and shit and like it 

3729
02:47:09,591 --> 02:47:12,050
gets me pretty jacked up like natural 
animals.

3730
02:47:12,051 --> 02:47:15,440
I think there is some juice in it.
It's like there's something different.

3731
02:47:15,441 --> 02:47:16,274
There's something going on.
Does anybody around you hunt and is 

3732
02:47:20,301 --> 02:47:21,134
willing to take you?
And literally everybody didn't want to 

3733
02:47:23,511 --> 02:47:24,020
mentor you.

3734
02:47:24,020 --> 02:47:26,270
Fuck yeah.
All you have to do is learn how to shoot

3735
02:47:26,271 --> 02:47:27,480
a rifle.
Right?

3736
02:47:27,560 --> 02:47:28,393
And here's the mean,
there's a lot you could read about 

3737
02:47:31,251 --> 02:47:32,910
shooting,
um,

3738
02:47:33,080 --> 02:47:33,913
but you,
you have to get someone who sets up the 

3739
02:47:34,971 --> 02:47:37,700
scope correctly,
sets up the rifle correctly,

3740
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:38,743
and then you just have to.
Someone have someone teach you the 

3741
02:47:40,431 --> 02:47:44,840
proper form and how to just only move 
your finger.

3742
02:47:44,841 --> 02:47:45,651
Just pull,
pull,

3743
02:47:45,651 --> 02:47:46,221
pull,
pull,

3744
02:47:46,221 --> 02:47:47,840
pull,
pull and get a surprise shot.

3745
02:47:48,120 --> 02:47:51,350
You can't go.
You try to shoot because you'll flinch.

3746
02:47:51,351 --> 02:47:52,184
And the,
a minor movement left or right over 100 

3747
02:47:55,731 --> 02:47:56,564
yards could equal.
It can be the difference between a 

3748
02:47:58,461 --> 02:47:59,294
lethal shot and shooting an animal in 
the butt and anybody who's shot a rifle 

3749
02:48:03,201 --> 02:48:05,510
including me has done that before.
It's not good.

3750
02:48:05,630 --> 02:48:08,270
And we shoot a lot,
you know like oh well we have will shoot

3751
02:48:08,271 --> 02:48:10,300
like ar air fifteens and shit.

3752
02:48:10,310 --> 02:48:12,470
Like in the we'll,
we'll get a nice section of land.

3753
02:48:12,471 --> 02:48:15,650
Like my brother has 40 acres in this 
beautiful area and it's like.

3754
02:48:15,980 --> 02:48:17,450
And by the way,
it's so cheap up there,

3755
02:48:17,480 --> 02:48:19,490
dude.
You can get an acre for like 800 bucks,

3756
02:48:19,910 --> 02:48:21,260
you know,
and you just get this,

3757
02:48:21,290 --> 02:48:23,040
this,
you can wait.

3758
02:48:23,090 --> 02:48:23,923
You can get an acre of land for 800 
bucks and it's the most beautiful shit 

3759
02:48:27,261 --> 02:48:29,300
you've ever seen.
Is it a direct flights?

3760
02:48:29,930 --> 02:48:32,420
There's a,
there's a airport and fucking sarah,

3761
02:48:33,360 --> 02:48:34,193
I'm not going name.
You have to fly like you have to fly 

3762
02:48:37,041 --> 02:48:41,440
like syracuse or some shit and then take
a puddle jumper that killed somebody.

3763
02:48:41,540 --> 02:48:42,840
Some lethal.
There's some weeds.

3764
02:48:42,980 --> 02:48:45,740
Flights like body holidays.
There's enough,

3765
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:46,993
there's enough like super wealthy people
there that we have like a pretty legit 

3766
02:48:49,791 --> 02:48:51,680
airport and this little area because 
it's a.

3767
02:48:51,700 --> 02:48:54,110
But they fly their own jets in those 
fuckers.

3768
02:48:54,310 --> 02:48:55,143
They do,
they fly their private jets into your 

3769
02:48:56,361 --> 02:49:00,050
little funky town and then they just sit
there and then we are always like,

3770
02:49:00,051 --> 02:49:01,380
well,
you pay us to hunt for you.

3771
02:49:02,870 --> 02:49:03,990
But dude,
you do like it up there.

3772
02:49:04,020 --> 02:49:06,650
My brother's like,
dude wants to hunt because it's like,

3773
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:09,360
how many animals do you have up there?
What kind of animals?

3774
02:49:09,610 --> 02:49:11,340
We have moose,
deer.

3775
02:49:11,840 --> 02:49:14,850
It's probably hard to get a moose tag 
though right now.

3776
02:49:14,851 --> 02:49:18,060
It's not that hard.
It's hard to miss.

3777
02:49:18,600 --> 02:49:20,280
Yeah,
they're talking about shooting a house.

3778
02:49:20,310 --> 02:49:22,020
They're like an ancient logan animal 
man.

3779
02:49:22,021 --> 02:49:24,510
It's so crazy looking and they're 
fucking vicious.

3780
02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:25,493
Oh,
well they do.

3781
02:49:25,530 --> 02:49:26,363
They are rare in the deer family.
Like all deer will fuck you up if they 

3782
02:49:30,451 --> 02:49:32,040
have to.
Especially when they're in rut.

3783
02:49:32,041 --> 02:49:33,060
They're just like,
yeah,

3784
02:49:33,090 --> 02:49:33,923
but a moose will try to fuck you up.
There's a difference because they're 

3785
02:49:36,541 --> 02:49:37,374
constantly dealing with grizzly bears 
and brown bears and they can fuck you 

3786
02:49:40,021 --> 02:49:40,790
up.
They can.

3787
02:49:40,790 --> 02:49:44,140
Their big dude.
I saw him once up there and it was like.

3788
02:49:44,670 --> 02:49:46,440
It was like a come to jesus moment.
I'm like,

3789
02:49:46,470 --> 02:49:47,250
oh,
I'm not,

3790
02:49:47,250 --> 02:49:49,500
I'm a guest in this area.
Dude.

3791
02:49:49,501 --> 02:49:52,600
I shot one that was young.
He was like,

3792
02:49:52,950 --> 02:49:53,783
he had like a little fork on the left 
and the fork in the right and each one 

3793
02:49:56,161 --> 02:49:56,994
of his legs was over 100 pounds.
I had a scoop his leg up and throw it 

3794
02:49:59,641 --> 02:50:01,830
over my shoulder bigger than alwan.

3795
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:07,650
It's almost like a stone in england 
where it's like how many ali wongs way.

3796
02:50:10,320 --> 02:50:11,153
There's a.
I did a cover for peterson's hunting 

3797
02:50:13,321 --> 02:50:14,154
magazine and on the cover I'm holding a 
moose leg over my shoulder and it's a 

3798
02:50:18,121 --> 02:50:18,954
crazy picture.
Like you look at how big that fucking 

3799
02:50:20,251 --> 02:50:21,084
leg is and that's not a big moose.
The moose that I shot was only like 

3800
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:28,140
maybe 900 pounds.
It was fairly small for a moose,

3801
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:31,470
but that's like the entire offensive 
line of the dallas cowboys.

3802
02:50:31,890 --> 02:50:33,180
Yeah,
right there.

3803
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:37,050
That's awesome.
That moose would've fucked me up.

3804
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:40,710
Like there's not a way in hell you could
have stopped.

3805
02:50:40,711 --> 02:50:42,660
That moves from stomping a hole in your 
chest.

3806
02:50:43,350 --> 02:50:44,700
Yeah,
and they want to.

3807
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:48,480
It's like a lot of prey animals get is 
almost as vicious as the predators.

3808
02:50:48,960 --> 02:50:51,570
Uh,
even though I don't feel as much empathy

3809
02:50:51,571 --> 02:50:54,900
for the prior,
so like if I wounded a fucking cat,

3810
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:55,770
yeah,
it'd be like,

3811
02:50:55,771 --> 02:50:57,120
yeah,
you learn your lesson brow.

3812
02:50:57,220 --> 02:51:00,000
Like my,
my brother recently hit A raccoon with a

3813
02:51:00,030 --> 02:51:02,580
pitchfork and lived.
And uh,

3814
02:51:02,581 --> 02:51:06,210
I didn't feel bad at all.
Well he lived as far as you know.

3815
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:07,530
Yeah,
he's definitely dead now.

3816
02:51:07,860 --> 02:51:10,440
But that's happens.
come in the henhouse definitely had some

3817
02:51:10,441 --> 02:51:11,790
like leakage.
Yeah.

3818
02:51:11,791 --> 02:51:15,120
That was the man that was the weinsteins
coming in and trying to get our hands.

3819
02:51:15,121 --> 02:51:16,860
we fucking stabbed his ass.
No,

3820
02:51:16,861 --> 02:51:18,720
he was more ethical.
Like what he's doing,

3821
02:51:18,721 --> 02:51:22,310
he's just trying to eat.
He just found a way to eat and we starve

3822
02:51:22,320 --> 02:51:26,940
and he's in that hardscrabble life of 
the wilderness and there's,

3823
02:51:27,540 --> 02:51:30,420
there's a lot of food up there.
Like it's a beautiful area.

3824
02:51:30,450 --> 02:51:33,900
There's no supermarkets for raccoons now
they just got to do.

3825
02:51:33,950 --> 02:51:35,430
They have a whole foods recommends up 
there.

3826
02:51:37,430 --> 02:51:41,490
So a lot of chemo for raccoons.
Keen was young.

3827
02:51:42,190 --> 02:51:44,220
Soy isolate.
I love pea protein.

3828
02:51:44,710 --> 02:51:46,370
Does this,
does that.

3829
02:51:46,410 --> 02:51:50,890
Give you boobs too much soy.
You you would know that shit.

3830
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:51,953
It's like I'm extraordinary amounts.
I think it's one of those things where 

3831
02:51:56,521 --> 02:52:01,521
people like really over exaggerate the 
impact of it to emphasize the femininity

3832
02:52:04,170 --> 02:52:05,600
of going vegan.
Right.

3833
02:52:05,750 --> 02:52:06,583
Her.
I don't think it really makes you a 

3834
02:52:10,181 --> 02:52:12,040
woman,
but I think that,

3835
02:52:12,041 --> 02:52:13,550
you know guys like,
hey,

3836
02:52:13,730 --> 02:52:17,630
and you could just eat bison duke good 
harder.

3837
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:24,730
You start planting flowers.
So lactating.

3838
02:52:24,910 --> 02:52:27,280
Yeah.
You start speed walking to bisons.

3839
02:52:27,281 --> 02:52:28,930
Good shit.
Good shit.

3840
02:52:29,980 --> 02:52:33,670
They were almost gone.
Does soi really caused man boobs?

3841
02:52:34,210 --> 02:52:38,460
Let's find out where on a website is 
it's fitness.

3842
02:52:38,550 --> 02:52:41,930
It's just never trust doctors with dr.
Name now.

3843
02:52:41,980 --> 02:52:43,240
Dr stacy.
Legit.

3844
02:52:43,241 --> 02:52:44,074
He's legit.
He's a friend of mine who's on sirius 

3845
02:52:47,621 --> 02:52:49,120
satellite radio.
I got to get him on,

3846
02:52:49,121 --> 02:52:50,680
man.
He's supposed to be on a million times.

3847
02:52:50,710 --> 02:52:52,060
We never.
We never put it together.

3848
02:52:52,061 --> 02:52:54,040
Dr steve.
Let's make it happen.

3849
02:52:54,780 --> 02:52:55,613
That you're steve mann.
Dr steve focuses on very bizarre 

3850
02:52:57,940 --> 02:53:00,760
venereal diseases.
He talks about them in depth.

3851
02:53:00,761 --> 02:53:01,241
You're like,
wait,

3852
02:53:01,241 --> 02:53:02,320
what?
Huh?

3853
02:53:02,500 --> 02:53:04,330
like syphilis.
you can die from that.

3854
02:53:04,660 --> 02:53:07,540
Like is there ones we don't know about?
Not yet,

3855
02:53:07,541 --> 02:53:08,374
but for sure they're coming.
It sounds like there was no herpes and 

3856
02:53:10,691 --> 02:53:12,970
all of a sudden there was herpes and 
that's it.

3857
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:13,833
That's why I like being married.
It's like I don't have to worry about 

3858
02:53:15,071 --> 02:53:16,450
that shit now.
So think you don't.

3859
02:53:16,480 --> 02:53:18,340
What about toilet seats?
That's.

3860
02:53:18,480 --> 02:53:19,313
That's a good point.
What about sneezing and I like to whack 

3861
02:53:20,890 --> 02:53:21,723
off on toilet seats.
What about what if plants fight back 

3862
02:53:24,641 --> 02:53:28,600
like a fucking shama lama.
Ding dong that shit.

3863
02:53:29,140 --> 02:53:31,030
That's what I'm saying.
Like what if they fight back?

3864
02:53:31,031 --> 02:53:34,260
We whack off on him and weinstein.
Imagine if,

3865
02:53:34,510 --> 02:53:39,510
if a weinstein's bars didn't just extend
to him sexually abusing actresses,

3866
02:53:42,341 --> 02:53:46,990
but that his calm when harvey shot loads
on those branches,

3867
02:53:47,130 --> 02:53:49,900
that does branches like morphed because 
of the.

3868
02:53:49,901 --> 02:53:54,901
The vile hatred for the female organism 
was in his dna and those,

3869
02:53:56,370 --> 02:53:57,203
those trees like found human babies and 
female babies and smothered him to 

3870
02:54:02,051 --> 02:54:02,681
death.
yeah,

3871
02:54:02,681 --> 02:54:03,790
just started.
Harvey's come.

3872
02:54:03,810 --> 02:54:04,643
It's start producing movies.
It's like produced by a is harvey is 

3873
02:54:08,500 --> 02:54:09,010
what it was like.

3874
02:54:09,010 --> 02:54:13,210
His ges contacted the bark of the tree 
and created the new plague.

3875
02:54:13,420 --> 02:54:16,030
Whoa.
It's totally legit.

3876
02:54:16,031 --> 02:54:16,864
Possible.
Who the fuck knows what causes the 

3877
02:54:18,131 --> 02:54:18,964
plague?
I was reading something about the black 

3878
02:54:20,321 --> 02:54:24,220
death is spreading because people like 
Arizona or some shit,

3879
02:54:24,221 --> 02:54:25,030
right?
No,

3880
02:54:25,030 --> 02:54:27,610
no.
It was somewhere in some place I'm never

3881
02:54:27,611 --> 02:54:28,820
going to visit,
and it was.

3882
02:54:29,960 --> 02:54:30,793
They were talking indie or some shit.
They were talking about how there's a 

3883
02:54:34,571 --> 02:54:38,500
problem with a culture where people pull
the bodies out of the ground,

3884
02:54:38,501 --> 02:54:39,400
the zoom,
the bodies,

3885
02:54:39,401 --> 02:54:40,234
and we're dancing around them and it was
literally causing the black death 

3886
02:54:42,740 --> 02:54:44,470
display.
Dancing with death.

3887
02:54:44,590 --> 02:54:45,423
Madagascar.
Plague is spreading because relatives 

3888
02:54:47,711 --> 02:54:48,544
are digging up their black death corpses
and dancing as part of an ancient fama 

3889
02:54:54,190 --> 02:54:58,450
de haan a ritual.
I mean that's commitment to dance.

3890
02:54:58,540 --> 02:55:00,670
That's commitment to stupidity.
where if someone's like,

3891
02:55:00,671 --> 02:55:01,960
oh,
you're gonna die if you do that.

3892
02:55:01,961 --> 02:55:02,321
It's like,
no,

3893
02:55:02,321 --> 02:55:03,830
I fucking loved dancing.
Did

3894
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:06,020
the website from the sun.
Oh,

3895
02:55:06,021 --> 02:55:08,870
it's not real because this unreal or the
males not real.

3896
02:55:08,871 --> 02:55:11,210
One of them was not really both.
I think they both have questionable.

3897
02:55:11,440 --> 02:55:12,770
They're not the onion,
right?

3898
02:55:12,800 --> 02:55:13,920
They're not done,
so they're not.

3899
02:55:14,030 --> 02:55:15,140
They're not honorable.
more.

3900
02:55:15,141 --> 02:55:15,974
I think like that.
The fake old fake news thing from the 

3901
02:55:18,141 --> 02:55:20,200
grocery store that you'd always see,
oh wait,

3902
02:55:20,220 --> 02:55:21,053
that kind of thing.
Almost like newsy is almost like legit 

3903
02:55:26,031 --> 02:55:26,864
news at this point.
What is fake news and what is real news 

3904
02:55:29,060 --> 02:55:30,500
anymore?
I have no idea.

3905
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:31,633
It's almost like the opium wars where 
it's like we're just flooded with 

3906
02:55:33,711 --> 02:55:35,810
fucking info at this point,
which said jeremy.

3907
02:55:35,811 --> 02:55:37,140
So that's what those hearings are about 
to.

3908
02:55:37,160 --> 02:55:37,993
I was just reading.
There's something tim cook gave a talk 

3909
02:55:39,771 --> 02:55:41,240
this afternoon.
The apple guy?

3910
02:55:41,320 --> 02:55:42,530
Yeah,
based off of the.

3911
02:55:42,560 --> 02:55:43,393
He said is that the fake news spreading 
is probably the bigger problem than the 

3912
02:55:45,981 --> 02:55:46,700
russian ads.

3913
02:55:46,700 --> 02:55:47,533
He says the ads is probably like a point
one percent of the actual problem and 

3914
02:55:51,710 --> 02:55:52,543
the ability for fake news to spread,
manipulate people through social media 

3915
02:55:55,381 --> 02:55:58,370
is problems one through 10 and you can 
be fixed.

3916
02:55:58,510 --> 02:56:01,400
It's a judge that that was almost like a
martin luther catholic church thing.

3917
02:56:01,401 --> 02:56:02,000
It's like,
oh no,

3918
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:02,833
no,
no.

3919
02:56:02,960 --> 02:56:04,760
It's not.
Who gets to judge.

3920
02:56:04,820 --> 02:56:05,653
It's whether or not it's fake.
Like concentrating on who the person is 

3921
02:56:08,930 --> 02:56:11,330
that gets the judge.
That's not helping anybody,

3922
02:56:11,540 --> 02:56:13,820
but what?
What's fake and what's not fake?

3923
02:56:13,910 --> 02:56:17,450
There's gotta be a way to differentiate.
This should be like a pregnancy test

3924
02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:22,340
for stories plus or minus and you're 
like,

3925
02:56:22,341 --> 02:56:24,020
oh mine.
It says that for a second.

3926
02:56:24,021 --> 02:56:24,854
Before you tell me this story.
I want you to lick this piece of paper 

3927
02:56:26,750 --> 02:56:28,820
is mother fucker.
That's hilarious.

3928
02:56:29,090 --> 02:56:29,970
What does it say where there is

3929
02:56:30,200 --> 02:56:34,670
cook?
Apple ceo says that,

3930
02:56:35,030 --> 02:56:38,450
scroll up.
There's a greater issue than russian.

3931
02:56:38,451 --> 02:56:43,451
Facebook didn't have that big hearing 
going on today and yesterday.

3932
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:46,780
Were there people from facebook,
twitter.

3933
02:56:46,781 --> 02:56:48,470
Why does everybody have to be number 
one?

3934
02:56:49,550 --> 02:56:51,380
Why does it have to be the number one 
problem?

3935
02:56:51,610 --> 02:56:56,200
Number one problem is Russia is not ads.
It's fake news.

3936
02:56:56,440 --> 02:56:57,273
Why is there a goddamn competition 
between what sucks the most listened to 

3937
02:57:01,271 --> 02:57:02,290
me,
tim cook,

3938
02:57:03,220 --> 02:57:06,610
they both suck.
The ads suck.

3939
02:57:06,970 --> 02:57:08,840
The stories that are fake,
stuck.

3940
02:57:09,470 --> 02:57:13,630
Everything sucks.
Stop making it about what?

3941
02:57:13,720 --> 02:57:15,820
Woo.
The number one problem is.

3942
02:57:15,821 --> 02:57:18,760
Not that it's trends.
Babies.

3943
02:57:19,070 --> 02:57:20,280
No,
no.

3944
02:57:21,100 --> 02:57:21,970
Yeah.
Like why kid?

3945
02:57:21,971 --> 02:57:24,730
Multiple things sucks.
Why don't we have a contest?

3946
02:57:24,880 --> 02:57:28,090
What is there a top 10 list of the 
suckiest things about life.

3947
02:57:28,540 --> 02:57:29,800
how about things?
Just suck.

3948
02:57:29,860 --> 02:57:30,693
Yeah,
like me and my bro,

3949
02:57:30,700 --> 02:57:31,810
you know,
a fortune,

3950
02:57:31,811 --> 02:57:33,150
a comedian,
fortune.

3951
02:57:33,400 --> 02:57:34,690
Very funny.
Oh,

3952
02:57:34,691 --> 02:57:35,610
she's,
she's a,

3953
02:57:35,620 --> 02:57:37,840
she's a buddy of mine and we like,
we'll talk on twitter.

3954
02:57:37,841 --> 02:57:40,900
She's like,
who offer dissenting opinion,

3955
02:57:40,901 --> 02:57:41,734
but we're like buds.
So like we go back and forth and I was 

3956
02:57:43,691 --> 02:57:46,570
like ripping on some fucking wine scene 
type psycho.

3957
02:57:46,570 --> 02:57:47,231
And she was like,
yeah,

3958
02:57:47,231 --> 02:57:49,540
but what about the fact trump did this?
I'm like,

3959
02:57:49,900 --> 02:57:51,490
yeah,
both sucks.

3960
02:57:51,550 --> 02:57:54,310
Both suck.
Like the hold line in the sand.

3961
02:57:54,311 --> 02:57:58,240
Like you only can fucking say one thing 
sucks is the end of our civilization.

3962
02:57:58,450 --> 02:58:00,730
And I think the one good thing,
the time.

3963
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:02,220
Wait a minute.
What did I read?

3964
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:04,230
I read a headline.
I didn't read the story,

3965
02:58:04,590 --> 02:58:09,590
but that weinstein said that this 
happened to him to change humanity.

3966
02:58:10,610 --> 02:58:12,880
See if we could find that.
He might've been.

3967
02:58:12,890 --> 02:58:15,360
That's a fucking angle.
It's good angle.

3968
02:58:15,420 --> 02:58:17,940
If that's a great buddy.
And we were doing mushrooms together.

3969
02:58:17,941 --> 02:58:18,870
I was,
listen to me bro.

3970
02:58:19,730 --> 02:58:21,640
You just handle this right?
Good.

3971
02:58:22,440 --> 02:58:24,350
It's a good thing that you jerked on 
that fight.

3972
02:58:25,590 --> 02:58:27,370
Not that part.
The fight.

3973
02:58:27,640 --> 02:58:29,550
The most forgivable part.
The part,

3974
02:58:29,780 --> 02:58:30,950
yeah,
that's uh,

3975
02:58:31,020 --> 02:58:32,460
he didn't say that.
Who said it?

3976
02:58:32,790 --> 02:58:34,410
It's a point of weinstein.

3977
02:58:34,410 --> 02:58:37,260
Pals said that his pals.
What?

3978
02:58:37,700 --> 02:58:39,870
Okay.
Weinstein tells pals.

3979
02:58:39,990 --> 02:58:40,823
Oh,
there you go.

3980
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:42,390
Jamie.
Hey.

3981
02:58:42,420 --> 02:58:44,430
Well,
I mean this is secondhand information.

3982
02:58:44,490 --> 02:58:48,360
He wasn'T loaded.
he tells pals is a scandal happens so he

3983
02:58:48,361 --> 02:58:50,490
could change the world.
That's what I said.

3984
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:53,760
So I'll make it larger.
It's the hero's journey for perverts.

3985
02:58:54,150 --> 02:58:54,983
It says disgraced.
Harvey weinstein has been telling what 

3986
02:58:57,960 --> 02:58:58,793
friends he has left.
If there's a bigger reason that he's 

3987
02:59:01,681 --> 02:59:02,514
embroiled in the ever wielding a 
widening sexual harassment scandal to 

3988
02:59:06,361 --> 02:59:09,120
change the world.
Sources tell page six.

3989
02:59:10,020 --> 02:59:13,620
I hate when they say sources say he's a 
savior.

3990
02:59:13,760 --> 02:59:15,510
A hollywood insider says,
okay,

3991
02:59:15,850 --> 02:59:18,120
this is all bullshit.
Every swing,

3992
02:59:18,390 --> 02:59:20,580
but it's an interesting angle.
So let's keep going.

3993
02:59:21,120 --> 02:59:23,670
A source adds that.
The pervy wow.

3994
02:59:23,671 --> 02:59:25,890
That's rude.
Former weinstein.

3995
02:59:27,920 --> 02:59:30,540
Miramax,
miramax.

3996
02:59:30,570 --> 02:59:31,710
Matcher.
What's?

3997
02:59:31,970 --> 02:59:34,870
Some might have left out a word or the 
letter word?

3998
02:59:35,300 --> 02:59:36,510
Miramax.
Marcher.

3999
02:59:36,570 --> 02:59:37,530
Mocker.
I don't know.

4000
02:59:38,010 --> 02:59:39,320
Oh,
like big mock.

4001
02:59:39,360 --> 02:59:41,410
Mock her.
Is that like a.

4002
02:59:41,440 --> 02:59:46,440
You never heard it used acidic word big.
I know there's like big maka,

4003
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,550
but I don't think it's my her person who
gets things done.

4004
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:55,440
Yeah,
it is big monster.

4005
02:59:55,940 --> 02:59:57,450
Nice yiddish.
There we go.

4006
02:59:57,890 --> 02:59:58,723
Has been telling a confidence that he 
was born to take the fall for his 

4007
03:00:02,821 --> 03:00:03,654
behavior in order to change the world.
He is resigned to his punishment as a 

4008
03:00:07,681 --> 03:00:10,140
martyr for social change.
But here's the thing,

4009
03:00:10,340 --> 03:00:13,740
a comment.
A rep for weinstein commented.

4010
03:00:13,950 --> 03:00:16,050
That's absurd.
it is absurd.

4011
03:00:16,200 --> 03:00:17,970
But.
But here's the thing.

4012
03:00:19,020 --> 03:00:19,853
I think that's true.
I don't think that there's like some 

4013
03:00:21,961 --> 03:00:22,794
crazy fucking destiny that he has the 
golden ring and he was supposed to take 

4014
03:00:26,791 --> 03:00:30,090
the fall,
but through his own folly,

4015
03:00:30,420 --> 03:00:31,253
through his own greedy fat chubby dick 
trying to pump his ineffective lowe's 

4016
03:00:37,321 --> 03:00:40,350
into the mouths of tens,
he really is going to change the world.

4017
03:00:40,380 --> 03:00:42,300
Yeah,
but he doesn't get to say it though,

4018
03:00:42,350 --> 03:00:44,760
like the other people have to feel it.
I don't know if he did.

4019
03:00:44,761 --> 03:00:45,361
It's,
it's,

4020
03:00:45,361 --> 03:00:47,430
it's one of these insiders that don't 
exist.

4021
03:00:47,880 --> 03:00:50,130
They Might've been real,
but they might've been fake.

4022
03:00:50,460 --> 03:00:53,220
Jamie,
what do you do if you were a writer,

4023
03:00:53,300 --> 03:00:54,133
and I'm not saying this person did that,
you could have made that quote up and 

4024
03:00:56,131 --> 03:00:56,964
just wrote an article,
but of course juicy headline that gets 

4025
03:00:58,561 --> 03:00:59,680
talked about podcasts.

4026
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:03,000
Sources could be like your horses.
I mean that was a.

4027
03:01:03,110 --> 03:01:07,630
I mean I hate to exonerate him,
but trump has said that many times about

4028
03:01:07,631 --> 03:01:10,030
some of the stores.
Is it the stories written about him?

4029
03:01:10,270 --> 03:01:12,640
They keep saying according to sources,
he's like,

4030
03:01:12,641 --> 03:01:13,474
you don't have any sources.
The sources do need to be protected for 

4031
03:01:15,551 --> 03:01:16,840
journalists.
You're right,

4032
03:01:16,870 --> 03:01:20,470
so is a really weird sort of gray area.
You're right.

4033
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:21,830
Yeah,
I mean there's.

4034
03:01:21,830 --> 03:01:26,500
There's only one way that someone's 
going to give you information that could

4035
03:01:26,501 --> 03:01:28,900
possibly threatened their life if they 
are.

4036
03:01:28,950 --> 03:01:30,730
There's no financial benefit.
No.

4037
03:01:31,630 --> 03:01:35,830
No societal benefit for them.
They have to be anonymous.

4038
03:01:36,550 --> 03:01:37,960
Right.
We've always been.

4039
03:01:38,220 --> 03:01:42,010
That was one of the main problems that I
had with the obama administration.

4040
03:01:42,310 --> 03:01:44,230
You know,
people sort of let them slide on that,

4041
03:01:44,231 --> 03:01:47,260
but it was one of the worst with whistle
ever.

4042
03:01:48,220 --> 03:01:51,280
There was a part of the hope and change 
website,

4043
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:56,600
a part of the hope and change website 
that was later redacted or a deleted was

4044
03:01:57,281 --> 03:01:58,114
that they were talking about expanding 
protection for whistleblowers who are 

4045
03:02:02,591 --> 03:02:03,424
exposing someone breaking the law,
which is exactly what edward snowden 

4046
03:02:08,831 --> 03:02:09,140
did.

4047
03:02:09,140 --> 03:02:09,640
Yeah.
That,

4048
03:02:09,640 --> 03:02:12,530
like obama trick me,
he tricked the trick me,

4049
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:14,630
man.
I've already checked himself $2,

4050
03:02:14,631 --> 03:02:18,920
like this is going to unite the races of
America and he's going to be transparent

4051
03:02:19,160 --> 03:02:19,993
and he's such a good speaker.
He's made me cry like literally with 

4052
03:02:22,941 --> 03:02:25,410
hope and then I see what the,
what he's,

4053
03:02:25,490 --> 03:02:26,810
what he does.
And I'm like,

4054
03:02:26,870 --> 03:02:28,910
dude,
you know,

4055
03:02:28,911 --> 03:02:29,744
seventy seven cents is bullshit man.
And it's like those little things where 

4056
03:02:32,241 --> 03:02:33,290
I'm like,
what that is.

4057
03:02:33,650 --> 03:02:34,483
Oh the uh,
they say the wage gap between men and 

4058
03:02:36,141 --> 03:02:37,730
women is seventy seven cents on the 
dollar.

4059
03:02:37,731 --> 03:02:39,770
And he said that publicly,
publicly.

4060
03:02:39,771 --> 03:02:41,450
Right?
And it's one thing if it's buzzfeed,

4061
03:02:41,451 --> 03:02:45,430
it's the president of United States and 
that is completely bullshit.

4062
03:02:45,431 --> 03:02:48,560
It's been debunked by the female 
president of harvard.

4063
03:02:48,830 --> 03:02:51,230
Like this is not reality at all.
It's like.

4064
03:02:51,830 --> 03:02:54,230
And so when I see claim what it really 
is though,

4065
03:02:54,320 --> 03:02:56,750
okay,
it really is more like a four cents.

4066
03:02:56,751 --> 03:02:58,900
Maybe it's uh,
uh,

4067
03:02:59,070 --> 03:02:59,903
they,
they don't include a factors such as 

4068
03:03:02,211 --> 03:03:03,044
quitting for having a children or 
dangerous jobs or all this shit that's 

4069
03:03:06,531 --> 03:03:07,364
just a rough average.
But if you look at this man and a woman 

4070
03:03:10,281 --> 03:03:13,340
with the same job for the same amount of
years with the same education,

4071
03:03:13,580 --> 03:03:15,920
it's basically the same.
It's very close

4072
03:03:16,480 --> 03:03:17,313
jobs.
A man makes more and they have 

4073
03:03:19,231 --> 03:03:22,510
attributed that,
although there's no real way to tell,

4074
03:03:22,570 --> 03:03:23,150
but they,
uh,

4075
03:03:23,150 --> 03:03:23,983
they believed that's attributable to man
is more aggressive in negotiating his 

4076
03:03:29,171 --> 03:03:32,050
initial salary total and subsequent 
raises.

4077
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:32,993
And,
and the,

4078
03:03:33,080 --> 03:03:36,780
the interesting thing is women are 
better at negotiating for other people.

4079
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:39,060
Like I've had female female agents that 
are like,

4080
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:42,180
vicious and awesome because they're 
like,

4081
03:03:42,181 --> 03:03:44,010
it's almost like their baby cops where 
they're like,

4082
03:03:44,011 --> 03:03:44,970
no,
they deserve more.

4083
03:03:44,971 --> 03:03:47,040
That's my baby.
But for themselves point.

4084
03:03:47,220 --> 03:03:48,360
Yeah,
for themselves.

4085
03:03:48,361 --> 03:03:49,194
They're not as alpha because I think 
their attractiveness isn't bret 

4086
03:03:52,141 --> 03:03:54,660
weinstein shit where it's like,
their attractiveness is.

4087
03:03:54,661 --> 03:03:55,494
So given that they don't have to,
like most men didn't fucking procreate 

4088
03:03:58,881 --> 03:04:02,090
for most of human civilization,
so we're always just trying to be like,

4089
03:04:02,300 --> 03:04:03,770
look dude,
I got a car,

4090
03:04:04,260 --> 03:04:07,280
you know,
that's an interesting point because like

4091
03:04:08,150 --> 03:04:12,690
if you have a view like there's two 
girls and one girl is like kind of gross

4092
03:04:13,010 --> 03:04:15,440
and overweight and the other girl is 
really pretty.

4093
03:04:15,560 --> 03:04:20,000
The gross overweight girl will protect 
that pretty girl,

4094
03:04:20,030 --> 03:04:22,520
like a fucking german shepherd.

4095
03:04:22,550 --> 03:04:23,383
Totally shielded,
but that the gross overweight girl will 

4096
03:04:29,541 --> 03:04:34,400
fuck.
And then tire bus load of willing men of

4097
03:04:34,401 --> 03:04:35,550
course.
yeah.

4098
03:04:35,590 --> 03:04:38,720
Like men are like super excited about 
her.

4099
03:04:38,870 --> 03:04:39,703
All the standards get out the window.
She has a couple of shots of vodka and 

4100
03:04:42,381 --> 03:04:46,890
she's like fucking taking her bra off as
she's walking through those ills.

4101
03:04:46,910 --> 03:04:50,910
Expanding school bus doors for us 
though,

4102
03:04:50,980 --> 03:04:53,540
tourists,
they call desert roses where it's like,

4103
03:04:54,050 --> 03:04:55,700
you know,
a is a 10,

4104
03:04:55,730 --> 03:04:57,710
but that doesn't happen the other way.
Like if,

4105
03:04:57,730 --> 03:05:00,350
if there's a bunch of women on a desert 
island,

4106
03:05:00,351 --> 03:05:03,860
there's some fucking weinstein with no 
movie credentials,

4107
03:05:04,240 --> 03:05:06,830
they don't read them.
They can just be like,

4108
03:05:06,831 --> 03:05:08,870
dude,
we can just hang out with each other and

4109
03:05:08,871 --> 03:05:11,480
just kind of cuddle and fuck anybody.
RighT.

4110
03:05:11,481 --> 03:05:14,120
But like dudes are like as low as it 
goes,

4111
03:05:14,121 --> 03:05:17,450
we will potentially meet that standard 
and that's.

4112
03:05:17,840 --> 03:05:20,280
And that's why it's like men can highly 
spa,

4113
03:05:20,600 --> 03:05:21,433
get specific with their skillset,
but we're more susceptible to brain 

4114
03:05:24,681 --> 03:05:25,514
damage.

4115
03:05:25,670 --> 03:05:26,503
But it's interesting.
We're talking about like a woman 

4116
03:05:27,980 --> 03:05:31,320
protecting that other woman.
Oh,

4117
03:05:31,321 --> 03:05:32,154
100 percent.
Like I do a bit about how women are 

4118
03:05:33,321 --> 03:05:35,810
socialist mentor capital.
That's where it's like women,

4119
03:05:35,811 --> 03:05:36,321
it's like,
oh,

4120
03:05:36,321 --> 03:05:38,810
she's having a bad night.
We all have to go home,

4121
03:05:38,811 --> 03:05:40,400
you know,
a linker tiers.

4122
03:05:40,401 --> 03:05:43,070
Ice cream man.
Or like he's been a buzzkill fucking cut

4123
03:05:43,071 --> 03:05:43,904
the week.
Yeah.

4124
03:05:44,180 --> 03:05:47,210
And the opposite is true.
We have to go home for debbie.

4125
03:05:47,270 --> 03:05:48,200
Yeah.
But the opposite is true.

4126
03:05:48,201 --> 03:05:50,330
Where it's like he's the fastest.
So it's like he's the funniest.

4127
03:05:50,331 --> 03:05:52,070
Let's make him king.
And women are like,

4128
03:05:52,071 --> 03:05:53,720
she has herpes tell everyone or.
No,

4129
03:05:53,730 --> 03:05:54,970
she's the,
she's the prettiest.

4130
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:58,730
Everyone she has herpes.
It's the tallest nail gets hammered down

4131
03:05:58,731 --> 03:05:59,564
because in a galitary in societies like 
the gatherers have to be like the same 

4132
03:06:02,421 --> 03:06:04,700
and the hunters value skill,
so it's like,

4133
03:06:04,701 --> 03:06:06,710
can you shut your mouth and shoot a 
fucking gun?

4134
03:06:06,710 --> 03:06:07,543
Great.
You're in versus like berry picking 

4135
03:06:09,710 --> 03:06:11,600
there.
Like everyone's great.

4136
03:06:11,601 --> 03:06:12,261
Right?
Let's share.

4137
03:06:12,261 --> 03:06:15,850
Babies are shared berries.
I don't want to talk shit about debbie.

4138
03:06:16,070 --> 03:06:18,140
I just realized while drunk.
you're definitely drunk.

4139
03:06:18,170 --> 03:06:19,580
Yeah,
but the point I made is still valid.

4140
03:06:19,610 --> 03:06:20,443
The were good for awhile,
but he didn't know how to get off the 

4141
03:06:22,341 --> 03:06:24,890
horse.
I said babies instead of berries.

4142
03:06:24,920 --> 03:06:25,790
That happens,
man.

4143
03:06:25,791 --> 03:06:28,850
You get to a certain point in your free 
wall and you're like,

4144
03:06:28,851 --> 03:06:31,070
oh my god.
I'm like skiing down a hill that I.

4145
03:06:31,140 --> 03:06:33,140
I don't know how to stop it.
I just started winging it.

4146
03:06:34,250 --> 03:06:37,340
We've done enough.
This is three hours and 20 minutes,

4147
03:06:37,400 --> 03:06:38,630
right?
How many minutes?

4148
03:06:40,600 --> 03:06:41,150
Sweet.
Dude.

4149
03:06:41,150 --> 03:06:42,680
It's been a blast.
I love you man.

4150
03:06:42,940 --> 03:06:44,370
I love you too buddy.
Matt,

4151
03:06:44,800 --> 03:06:45,720
we did this.
He did.

4152
03:06:45,740 --> 03:06:46,573
I'm glad I was with you for the first 
alcohol and the first marijuana hadn't 

4153
03:06:49,671 --> 03:06:54,671
31 days and I'm here to tell you so 
brighty as fucking highly underrated and

4154
03:06:56,310 --> 03:06:57,143
overrated at the same time.
It's overrated when it comes to 

4155
03:06:58,981 --> 03:07:00,150
podcasts.
That's good.

4156
03:07:00,210 --> 03:07:01,260
Good.
Take a month off.

4157
03:07:01,550 --> 03:07:02,550
I like it.
It's respect.

4158
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:04,110
Respect.
I feel good about it.

4159
03:07:04,200 --> 03:07:06,480
I'm excited.
I'm good to be back on the horse.

4160
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:09,090
She take them on twitter to show her 
fucking willpower.

4161
03:07:09,150 --> 03:07:10,410
No,
that's not worth it.

4162
03:07:10,740 --> 03:07:11,970
Well,
you have to promote gigs.

4163
03:07:11,971 --> 03:07:14,840
I think a month off interacting with 
people.

4164
03:07:14,841 --> 03:07:15,674
It's not the worst idea in the world.
Just send some love out there and then 

4165
03:07:18,091 --> 03:07:19,420
just walk away,
you know?

4166
03:07:19,590 --> 03:07:23,550
But do send some good positive feelings.
Don't worry about being sappy.

4167
03:07:23,780 --> 03:07:24,613
Why?
Why is sincerity sappy like what 

4168
03:07:26,551 --> 03:07:27,384
happened?
Well,

4169
03:07:27,420 --> 03:07:30,120
are we so fucking cynical that someone 
can say,

4170
03:07:30,150 --> 03:07:31,740
can't say much loved everybody.
Oh,

4171
03:07:31,860 --> 03:07:32,693
good pussy.
Sincerity became sappy somewhere along 

4172
03:07:37,261 --> 03:07:38,870
the line.
Let's turn that around.

4173
03:07:38,910 --> 03:07:42,160
Turn it around.
Let's turn it around and all you bitches

4174
03:07:42,161 --> 03:07:44,880
out there that think that all white 
cisgendered men are shit.

4175
03:07:45,360 --> 03:07:48,450
fuck that shit.
I pray for you to get some good dick.

4176
03:07:48,830 --> 03:07:50,250
Good,
good friends.

4177
03:07:50,520 --> 03:07:51,170
And so I'm happy

4178
03:07:51,170 --> 03:07:54,410
times to change your ways.
Same way.

4179
03:07:54,411 --> 03:07:59,411
Jamie kilstein did the same way.
I hope we all do.

4180
03:08:00,330 --> 03:08:02,010
I hope we all do.
God dammit.

4181
03:08:02,140 --> 03:08:02,973
All right.
We'll see you fucking freaks of the ice 

4182
03:08:04,611 --> 03:08:08,120
house and a few hours,
but to keep this train rolling.

4183
03:08:08,420 --> 03:08:10,610
And then next week.
God damn young.

4184
03:08:10,611 --> 03:08:11,444
Jamie.
We've got a ton of fucking podcast next 

4185
03:08:13,010 --> 03:08:15,500

monday.
Oh jesus.

4192
03:08:36,290 --> 03:08:38,450
We might have marilyn manson called that
dude.

4193
03:08:38,451 --> 03:08:42,410

Work this out mark and it makes it.

4197
03:08:51,950 --> 03:08:54,830
Jesus christ.
Fucking week.

4198
03:08:55,360 --> 03:08:57,200
Alright,
