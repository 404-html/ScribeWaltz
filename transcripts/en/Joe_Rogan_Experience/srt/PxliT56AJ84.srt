1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,833
One of the things,

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,080
yeah,

4
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,220
about being,

5
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:04,760
um,

6
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,590
a comic in Boston is that,

7
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:06,890
uh,

8
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,600
there was a lot of craft too.

9
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,201
I mean you,

10
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:10,040
you came along,

11
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,490
it's a little bit after me about after uh,

12
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,030
my generation of open makers.

13
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:14,750
Uh,

14
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,830
but there was a,

15
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,630
there was a lot of emphasis put on the
craft of like the use of the word fuck.

16
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:21,530
Like you know,

17
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:22,850
you could use the word fuck,

18
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:23,900
but don't over fuck.

19
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:25,070
Don't break the fuck meter.

20
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:26,060
That's what you guys would say.

21
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,601
I remember that.

22
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:28,620
I try to keep it to three,

23
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,760
three to five fucks.

24
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,570
Yeah.

25
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,490
Like Donovan used to say it.

26
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,680
Donovan was a genius man.

27
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,210
Donovan Donovan is one of those,

28
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,323
the g

29
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,840
one of my favorite lines ever is,

30
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:39,180
he's talking about uh,

31
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,420
being at work and your boss breaking
your balls about going on break.

32
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,590
And one of my favorite,

33
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:49,510
like most one of those blue collar details
that I never heard anybody bring up

34
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:50,140
on stage.

35
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,230
He was imitating given shit to his boss.

36
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:53,501
He said,

37
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,630
I'll take a 20 minute shit
on the clock if I want.

38
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,800
And I was just like,

39
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,521
oh my God.

40
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:01,630
I used to work with a guy who did
that everyday just dogging it.

41
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:02,500
Just hated his life.

42
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,820
He would grab the newspaper.

43
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,620
It was just like he got,

44
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:06,670
we just had a break.

45
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:07,720
The Roach coach pulled up.

46
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,750
We just had the break
and he used it to get,

47
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,740
he was so fucking miserable to get
from the break to get to lunch.

48
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,110
He had this routine where
he would go and he's like,

49
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:19,660
I have to go to the bathroom and
we would all break his balls.

50
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,021
It's like,

51
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:20,221
Joe,

52
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:20,541
you get,

53
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,360
you fucking went in that like nine hours,

54
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:23,170
you know?

55
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,300
And he would just laugh
and he would just walk in,

56
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,940
sit down and just read the newspaper.

57
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:29,290
I don't think he was taking his shit.

58
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,650
He would just sit on this
bowl just to have this like,

59
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,970
I never forget that shit.

60
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:35,770
Like how lucky my life was to tell jokes.

61
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:39,340
Let's just say that like your game plan
is you ain't your job so bad that you

62
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:44,320
pretend to take a shit but 20 minutes
every day just to get to lunch.

63
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,770
It's a lot of guys that
can get fired for that.

64
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:48,661
Oh,

65
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:50,470
now a days with all the
cameras and everything.

66
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:53,260
They can literally break down exactly
when you cause back in the day that fuck

67
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:54,130
he was six minutes.

68
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,040
Yeah,

69
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,020
they wouldn't let me have a hernia.

70
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:57,220
How quick am I supposed to take a shit?

71
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,880
They bring it to a diet counselor,

72
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,980
tried to get you.

73
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,000
We have to figure out,

74
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:05,930
figure out some sort of a way to optimize
your time better here at performance

75
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:06,460
inc.

76
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:06,990
Setting

77
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,760
the people in the cubicles
that you're walking by.

78
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,660
As you go to the,

79
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:10,410
uh,

80
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,550
as you go to the toilet there,

81
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,690
they're pulling your load
while you're shifting.

82
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,140
That was one of the dumbest things.

83
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:16,591
We have a dead.

84
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:16,891
We used to,

85
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:19,740
we used to ship out like
this computer software.

86
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,310
We are the middleman between like
software companies and people ordering

87
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:23,761
software.

88
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:24,571
This is like the 80,

89
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:25,440
so there's no internet.

90
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,630
So people would come to our company,

91
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,720
I mean the company I worked for where
they had all this software at Lotus one,

92
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:30,901
two,

93
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:31,734
three,

94
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,461
Dbas,

95
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:32,701
three,

96
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:33,750
all this old school shit.

97
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,980
And,

98
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,220
uh,

99
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,230
one day we got into this stupid guy,

100
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,930
competitive thing like fucking morons.

101
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:42,090
We didn't realize it like who
was shipping out the most.

102
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,590
So we started saving them,

103
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,410
competing with one another and uh,

104
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:47,940
this guy shipped out a hundred packages.

105
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:49,260
So the next day I did one 20,

106
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:52,260
and then he did one 60 move fighting
and then the fucking management got room

107
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:52,990
for it.

108
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,361
They're like,

109
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:53,661
oh yeah,

110
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:56,240
why don't you start keeping a,

111
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:56,820
an uh,

112
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,381
a number.

113
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:00,550
And then they figured out who is being
the most and guys started losing their

114
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:00,911
jobs.

115
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,350
So I even back then I was like,

116
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:02,790
dude,

117
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,790
stop fucking doing it.

118
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,910
Stop doing it because we're,

119
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:07,420
we're literally cutting our own fucking,

120
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,871
well,

121
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,390
you're making yourself put
yourself in a race that's,

122
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,220
there's no way.

123
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,130
We didn't know any better.

124
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:12,970
Yeah,

125
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,500
we didn't know any better idiots.

126
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,940
We like 1920 that we,

127
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,770
we used to fucking go out and drink like
a 12 pack of beer and eat McDonald's at

128
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,431
one in the morning.

129
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:23,680
And by like eight o'clock
we were unloading trucks,

130
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,543
fine,

131
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,800
laughing and then we would work.

132
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,783
We do all this shit.

133
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And then during lunch hour we would go
out and play basketball and like just

134
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:37,360
regular sneakers and like five o one
blues member that the black and fly and

135
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:38,140
you'd be that.

136
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,630
You'd come back and pouring
sweat and then just keep,

137
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,420
unless it's the greatest
shape I was ever in my life.

138
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:47,590
And then in the end of work I would
then go lift and go ride a bike,

139
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,750
do them at one time I
want a bike ride hammered.

140
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,420
I was so into working
out fucking bike ride.

141
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:55,060
I'm on like a 12 speed bike that
I bought when I still have it,

142
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:55,690
by the way,

143
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,291
am I garage,

144
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,330
I refuse to throw shit out and a,

145
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:01,720
I remember being hammered on the bike
and I'm sweating so I'm becoming more

146
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:02,554
hammered.

147
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,410
I was going to do this 11 mile loop.

148
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,980
Then it became oh seven and then I just
kind of came back and I was like on the

149
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:13,981
bike laughing and I was like 2021 and
was only beginning to understand the

150
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:15,190
fragility of life.

151
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,950
And I knew that what I
was doing was stupid,

152
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:18,784
but I couldn't get,

153
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,200
I,

154
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,630
I,

155
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,960
I just kept picturing my friends laughing
at me and I was literally by myself

156
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:23,651
riding this bike,

157
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:24,640
laughing drunk,

158
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,290
driving up the street.

159
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,250
And I'm in here for two and a half hours.

160
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:32,590
Like I'm just taking snippets
from fucking the eighties I got,

161
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:33,424
I got nothing left

162
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,580
used to be able to bounce back.

163
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:36,821
So,

164
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:37,331
well,

165
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:38,140
when you're young,

166
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,980
it's amazing.

167
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:40,030
When you're 20 years old,

168
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,590
you'd get hammered the next day.

169
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,640
You barely feel anything.

170
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,953
Dude,

171
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,850
Donald's and tear down that place.

172
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,590
I would get to quarter
pounders with cheese,

173
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,670
a large fry,

174
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,680
a six piece mcnugget
and I never liked him.

175
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,760
I never liked him.

176
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:53,890
I never thought it an ice
to try the different sauces.

177
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:55,060
I used to go with the mustard,

178
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,200
never tastes good.

179
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,730
I just wanted something to fill the void.

180
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,380
And then I would get like a
couple of cheeseburgers and uh,

181
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,720
I think it just a giant coke and just
throw that down and wake up the next day

182
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:08,590
with a flat stomach.

183
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:09,430
And I had already drank like,

184
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:09,730
you know,

185
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:09,911
eight,

186
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,744
nine beers.

187
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,023
We've got to fight.

188
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,990
We got into a fight one time right under
the Golden Arches and the next town

189
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:17,824
over.

190
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,301
I don't know what happened.

191
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:20,320
These guys came in drunk,

192
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,340
classic Boston shift.

193
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,560
They just come walking in and
they give everybody the finger.

194
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,690
Of course we respond to it and next
thing you know we're out underneath the

195
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:29,471
golden arches.

196
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,930
There's like five of us and two of them.

197
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,100
And uh,

198
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,551
my buddy,

199
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:34,151
we always fought,

200
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:36,430
he starts swinging on the big
one and then the little one,

201
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,730
he sort of jumped in and just became
this big and it looked like wrestling,

202
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:39,911
you know,

203
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:42,670
when like they all come running out of
the dressing to help each other on snow.

204
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:44,170
Everybody's drunk just fallen down.

205
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,520
We so fucking drunk.

206
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,000
The cops were there like sort
of misting mace for like,

207
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,050
and I don't know how long,

208
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,310
like we didn't even see him pull up.

209
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,300
There's this that I like
being in the flight.

210
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,320
Then all of a sudden everybody's like,

211
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,980
eyes are like up and shit.

212
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,190
And then what was hilarious was they
just broke us up and they fuck it.

213
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,410
And then like two seconds later we're
back in our car and the same two guys we

214
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:09,890
were fighting come and back up to the car.

215
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:10,101
It's like,

216
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:10,970
where does the cops go?

217
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,810
I thought it was over.

218
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,190
And the guys like that
was a bullshit pajamas.

219
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:15,024
I the little one goes,

220
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,591
I still remember,

221
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:15,920
he goes,

222
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,630
we laugh at you a shit.

223
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,260
It was fucking nuts.

224
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:25,011
I got to give it up to him.

225
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:25,310
And it was,

226
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:25,491
it was,

227
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:25,790
you know,

228
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,260
fucking four on two or whatever.

229
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,040
And uh,

230
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,940
they didn't give a shit.

231
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,201
They laughed.

232
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:31,580
They definitely laughed at our shit.

233
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:31,680
They,

234
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,480
they didn't care.

235
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,350
They hate that Mason.

236
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,071
They came right back.

237
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:37,250
They were ready right up to our faced,

238
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,960
right up to our Ford escort.

239
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,230
They did not give a fuck if
you're still in into the fighting,

240
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,280
you just got maced.

241
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,903
That's what he needed.

242
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,310
Something happened cause I don't,

243
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,990
nobody got it full on.

244
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,040
Like it was just like you're,

245
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,990
I thought we thought it was the snow.

246
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,330
Like they had thrown a rock salt
cause we were on the ground.

247
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:53,500
I don't,

248
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,333
I don't know what it was,

249
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,870
but it was just like
unbelievably fucking Arab.

250
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:57,704
But we were hammered,

251
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,010
I sounds like a fucking police
car pulled up and nobody noticed.

252
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,590
That's hilarious.

253
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:02,721
Like,

254
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:03,411
Hey,

255
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:04,700
you gotta got to whatever was going on.

256
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:14,880
Okay.
