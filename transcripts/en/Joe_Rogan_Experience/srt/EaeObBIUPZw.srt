1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,181
Bum,

2
00:00:00,181 --> 00:00:00,361
bum,

3
00:00:00,361 --> 00:00:00,571
bum,

4
00:00:00,571 --> 00:00:00,781
bum,

5
00:00:00,781 --> 00:00:01,614
bum bum.

6
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,470
Three,

7
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,303
two,

8
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,373
boom.

9
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,250
Can you lower it?

10
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,130
Ladies and gentleman,

11
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,270
Mauro run Allo big John McCarthy.

12
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,980
Uh,

13
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,280
Eddie Bravo rocking the old
school Elio Gracie shirt.

14
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,990
I love that shirt and respect.

15
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,050
Deep respect Brendan motherfucking shop.

16
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,321
Oh,

17
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,940
and I got to sugar Sean O'Malley shirt.

18
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,200
I might strip down later
and put his mother fucker.

19
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:27,630
I was that the best shirt Reebok's ever.

20
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,250
Maybe it might be one of the dopest.

21
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:29,441
Sure.

22
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:30,274
It's pretty great.

23
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,141
It's pretty great.

24
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:31,760
Reebok.

25
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,581
Reebok is getting better,

26
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,090
man.

27
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:33,923
I'll give it to him.

28
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,430
I'm wearing a pair of Reeboks right home.

29
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,740
I thought it was not,

30
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,650
I thought I was [inaudible] earlier today.

31
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,230
Reebok send me a bunch of sneakers,

32
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,790
but that's a dope shirt right there.

33
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,331
You know what I mean?

34
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,070
I was super critical on them for a while.

35
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:47,910
They're getting way better,

36
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:48,450
man.

37
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:48,930
Way Better.

38
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,760
This is good that they,

39
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,720
when they posted that,

40
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:53,370
I got my boy who works at Reebok,

41
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:54,050
I send a screenshot.

42
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,440
I went,

43
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:54,931
God damn,

44
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,250
you guys hit this one out of the park.

45
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,180
They're embracing it.

46
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,040
They're embracing the
fact that he's a stoner,

47
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,480
like heavy duty.

48
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,081
Yeah,

49
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:02,160
it's just a fun shirt.

50
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,550
Talks about what go.

51
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:06,480
Does Instagram dude's
getting high all day?

52
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,160
Did you see him on the last fight?

53
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:08,941
Well,

54
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:10,200
he just takes time off.

55
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,790
I mean you don't have to
take much time off anymore.

56
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:12,980
No.

57
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,470
Two weeks.

58
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,221
Two days.

59
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:14,851
Two days.

60
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,684
Days.

61
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,693
Yeah.

62
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,010
Yeah.

63
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,150
New Usada rules.

64
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:20,730
You just can't be high when you fight
depending where you fight though.

65
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:21,120
Right.

66
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,800
Cause there there's some issues coming up.

67
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,720
I forget which state they do it different.

68
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,970
Probably Texas commissions are haters.

69
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:29,040
So Dylan,

70
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,130
Dennis,

71
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,870
this is not as MMA debut.

72
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,350
Oh against Kyle Walker and Eddie.

73
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:36,050
Tell us about Dylan's Jujitsu.

74
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,020
He's pretty high level.

75
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,191
Yeah,

76
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:38,790
he's one of the best around for sure.

77
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:43,791
He had an amazing match with
Gordon Ryan at 2017 Abu Dhabi.

78
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,290
I mean the fight was really close.

79
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,710
It could've went either way and they
gave it the judge's decision gave it to

80
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,710
Gordon and Gordon when I
went on to win his division.

81
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,520
So He's,

82
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,440
he's top of the food chain and you know,

83
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:56,670
he was with Marcello Garcia.

84
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,470
He got his black belt
from Marcella Garcia.

85
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:58,651
Yeah.

86
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,750
Marcello kicked him out for shit talking.

87
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:01,170
Right.

88
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,220
It's not the deal for,

89
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:02,460
you know,

90
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:02,651
he,

91
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:06,360
he started hanging out with Conor McGregor
and Marcella Garcia is the opposite

92
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,490
of that kind of shit.

93
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,343
Her humble.

94
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,700
Incredibly humble.

95
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,730
Yeah.

96
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:10,860
Yeah.

97
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,170
You would think though that Marcello
and him would work it out though.

98
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,710
And I have a guy and the
guy's a high level black belt,

99
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:18,570
like obviously it's just too much drama.

100
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,280
But Dylan in real life,

101
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,660
he's a super great guy.

102
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,130
He's just trying to make some money.

103
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,461
He,

104
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:23,940
uh,

105
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,820
he's smart talking.

106
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,280
He got shit to Jon Jones and I,

107
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,060
and here we go.

108
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,151
Oh,

109
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:27,960
that's stupid.

110
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,840
I know all these guys talking shit that
John John's are eventually going to have

111
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,870
to meet him and they will get slapped.

112
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,840
When I saw Dylan,

113
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,460
when the Conor and Floyd fight,

114
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:36,420
me and him sat next to each other,

115
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,910
he was the nicest guy in the world,

116
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:38,250
man.

117
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,541
Look at him.

118
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,121
His fans,

119
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:40,400
he's very Conor McGregor.

120
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,910
Ask With that same coaching.

121
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:42,900
So coaching,

122
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,733
same camp.

123
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,693
Oh Dude.

124
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,690
He's got real problems with just striking.

125
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,260
That dude just stepped in and
cleaned him with that left.

126
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,580
Oh Shit.

127
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,720
He got some problems.

128
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,670
His standup is super rudimentary.

129
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,160
Takedowns are they better be good.

130
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,010
Well it's Kinda,

131
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,320
he's Kinda like the Mackenzie dern,

132
00:02:58,321 --> 00:02:59,154
right of,

133
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,711
well,

134
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,330
he's obviously closing the distance too,

135
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,150
which is a problem because
it's obvious you're calming in.

136
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,230
The guy could just wait on you.

137
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,090
His distance control several times.

138
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:08,440
He's been clipped by that left hand.

139
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,333
Oh Dude.

140
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,250
If this guy can keep this fight stand.

141
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:12,670
Okay.

142
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,001
Yeah.

143
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,020
His kicks are stiff.

144
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,370
Yeah,

145
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:16,830
it's,

146
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,370
but his Jujitsu is this shit.

147
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:22,000
If he gets his fight to these kind of
like an alley cat version of Connor,

148
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,530
like super alley cat.

149
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,730
I don't real rough.

150
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,270
He pulls back with his chin straight
up in the air to get a clinch.

151
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:28,540
Yeah,

152
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,373
for sure.

153
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:29,910
For sure.

154
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,743
Yeah.

155
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,213
Let's jump to God.

156
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,080
I like,

157
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,790
it doesn't happen enough fatty now.

158
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,540
It doesn't happen if
you get the skills down,

159
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,390
if he can't take the guy down and you
have your dangerous off your back.

160
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,200
Pulling Guard is great.

161
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,710
Right?

162
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,090
He's hooking it and he's about to
get them in an arm bar right here.

163
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,091
This is good.

164
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:46,900
This guy's in trouble.

165
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,010
If this guy is gonna sweep,

166
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,963
this guy knows the game.

167
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,750
I was gonna pull out of this shit.

168
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,580
Oh No,

169
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,510
he's gonna.

170
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,171
He's gonna heal her.

171
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:56,004
Come watch him.

172
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,003
He's got him.

173
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,790
It's in deep.

174
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,623
It's over.

175
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,150
Yes.

176
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,160
That was fun for sure.

177
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,970
There he goes.

178
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,103
And that's a wrap.

179
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,943
I think he's okay.

180
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,650
He pulled guard and she got to heal hook.

181
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,260
Pretty sweet.

182
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,860
Beautiful.

183
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,290
Yeah.

184
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,123
It was a suite here.

185
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:11,860
Opponent.

186
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,630
I don't have a problem
giving them a warm up fight,

187
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:15,010
like the source first one first.

188
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,450
MMA fight your belt door.

189
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,500
He's still getting worse.

190
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,400
Could be in Pico,

191
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,091
your first fight.

192
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:19,750
You know what I'm saying?

193
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,650
Just so things,

194
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:20,891
man,

195
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:23,140
when I see a dude get his
knee ripped apart like that,

196
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,850
like that dude's fucked.

197
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,241
Look at him.

198
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,074
He's in pain.

199
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,620
You could get your shoulder ripped
apart and come on the exact same way.

200
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:30,311
So I know,

201
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:30,601
but it's,

202
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:31,181
it's weird,

203
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:31,510
right?

204
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,751
I mean,

205
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,390
I'm not saying it makes sense to tap.

206
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,170
That's it.

207
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:34,510
Yeah.

208
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,690
I think the problem is guys aren't too
familiar with what goes on with the leg

209
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:37,891
legs.

210
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:39,730
So by the time they're
tapping it's too late.

211
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,001
Yeah.

212
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,680
But what I'm saying is
for whatever reason,

213
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,101
for me,

214
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:42,911
when I watch it,

215
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,560
I cringe McCurry with Lego.

216
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,370
I agree.

217
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,050
Like if I see a guy get his arm broken,

218
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:47,980
it doesn't bother me.

219
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,100
Like I see a guy get his knee ripped
apart cause we're not used to seeing it.

220
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,091
I don't know,

221
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:52,331
man.

222
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,100
I maybe it's because I
know that tap you like,

223
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,080
you only have so much time to tap.

224
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,970
Like your shit's gonna explode.

225
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,493
Maybe it's just,

226
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,753
I dunno.

227
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,420
I Dunno.

228
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,880
But when a guy is really good at it,

229
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,041
you know,

230
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,240
if you fuck up an ankle,

231
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,740
he's out for a grip.

232
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,430
Yeah.

233
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:06,820
Yup,

234
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,300
Yup.

235
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,811
Oh Dad.

236
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:08,370
I said no asked.

237
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:08,950
He won't tell.

238
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,530
Oh,

239
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,450
nasty toehold.

240
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,430
I had a bad angle as a tone.

241
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,780
That was a heel hook initially.

242
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,621
Yeah.

243
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:15,400
I thought so too.

244
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,450
But they didn't really show it.

245
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,990
They couldn't see his
back was to write it.

246
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,853
He can't see it.

247
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,810
Well,

248
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,291
you know what,

249
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:20,651
man?

250
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:21,070
I mean,

251
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,290
I liked the fact that he's in there,

252
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,430
but man,

253
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:27,560
I feel like w just watching
him move with his standup,

254
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,480
I'd like to see him.

255
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,770
That's his first fight.

256
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:30,100
Brother.

257
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,611
I know,

258
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,550
but I'd like to see him to get
some more standup training.

259
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,110
Just it seems like,

260
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,311
I mean,

261
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:36,551
look,

262
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:37,660
if he gets guys to the ground,

263
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,340
they're there in a world of shit,

264
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,190
but you could see from his standup,

265
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,330
it's like rudimentary super amateur,

266
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:43,991
but how's that?

267
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:46,840
Any different than Michael
Bennett page was zero Jujitsu,

268
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:48,250
so much as zero Jujitsu.

269
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,060
You know what I'm saying?

270
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,140
That starts on the fee.

271
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,340
Michael [inaudible].

272
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,970
He's a straight up black belt as they get,

273
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:55,804
when it comes to the ground,

274
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,311
it doesn't matter.

275
00:05:57,311 --> 00:05:58,940
Nickel then and pages tap people.

276
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,860
He's tapped people.

277
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,500
Shit.

278
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,060
I don't,

279
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't think his Jujitsu
is as bad as you think so.

280
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,320
Well,

281
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,153
so that light,

282
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,460
not Michael Dubin page.

283
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,650
He's no Dylan Dennis,

284
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,493
but no,

285
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,423
Paul Daley.

286
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,720
That's,

287
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:11,961
yeah,

288
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:12,480
that's a good cause.

289
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,313
It's just use off.

290
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah.

291
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,880
If you're high level at one aspect.

292
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,150
Yeah.

293
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,901
Whether it's wrestling,

294
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,190
Jiu Jitsu or striking.

295
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:22,610
If you're super high level worldclass
you can suck at the other two.

296
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,241
It doesn't matter.

297
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:23,451
I mean,

298
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,040
look at Green Melvin Manhoef.

299
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,420
He's so dangerous on his feet.

300
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,280
He doesn't really have any Jujitsu,

301
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:28,941
but it's okay.

302
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:29,390
It's true.

303
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,560
People still want to see him fight.

304
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,431
We get Damien Meyer,

305
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,210
Jake shields.

306
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,961
My thing is though,

307
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:36,500
when I see a guy like Dylan
Dannis who so good on the ground,

308
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:41,501
I really want them to achieve a certain
level of striking proficiency before he

309
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:42,041
fights.

310
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:42,650
He fights.

311
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,483
Yeah.

312
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,031
Yeah.

313
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:45,980
I just feel like we're going
to pay rent the wrestler,

314
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,960
but it's going to put
him in a world of Joe.

315
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:50,300
He's never been in that
in that cage before.

316
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,570
Right.

317
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,480
So maybe in training he's putting it
all together like you're ready to go.

318
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,210
Man Gets in these.

319
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,970
He's like damn.

320
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,710
Hate his nerves.

321
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,530
Never felt those nerves inside the age.

322
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,770
They took those shots to
took those shots on the chin.

323
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:01,550
Well,

324
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,160
you got hit with a couple of good
clean left hands and he adjusted.

325
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,290
I'm sure I'm,

326
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,540
I'm a,

327
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,260
I'm about a million percent sure the plan
wasn't to go out there and pull guard.

328
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,640
The fact that he realized,

329
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,001
Oh shit,

330
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:14,840
this guy's tagging me and he was kind
of hesitant to get in tight to get a

331
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,260
takedown pulling guard
show that he can adapt.

332
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:18,950
Yeah.

333
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,970
I'm not mad at it at all.

334
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,260
Yeah,

335
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,130
I'm sure that was probably in the plan,

336
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,400
you know,

337
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,181
Plan B,

338
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,110
plan c.

339
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,333
But uh,

340
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,750
if he gets guys the
ground there in the world,

341
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,460
most,

342
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,420
most fighters,

343
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,450
they don't have it in their
plan to pull guard most down.

344
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,230
Not the ones that,

345
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,063
that I've talked to.

346
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,450
It's never part of the plan.

347
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,370
Like this doesn't work
or that doesn't work.

348
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:38,061
I'm going to pull guard.

349
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:38,141
Yeah,

350
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:38,850
that's too bad either.

351
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,110
It's either I'm going to try to
take him down until the bitter end.

352
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,160
Speak a pulling guard,

353
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:43,370
you know,

354
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,380
Camaros months fighting Damien Maia.

355
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:45,891
Yes.

356
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:47,360
Damien Maia to got short notice.

357
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,560
How's that weight cuts on?

358
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,310
That's not good.

359
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,290
Was he supposed to be
fighting ponds and Obo?

360
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,124
Yes.

361
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,000
Uh,

362
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,290
you got hurt and knee injury,

363
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,420
right ma'am?

364
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,370
That car take has taken
a hit because then our,

365
00:07:58,371 --> 00:07:58,641
uh,

366
00:07:58,641 --> 00:07:59,121
our boy,

367
00:07:59,121 --> 00:07:59,954
no time,

368
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,920
um,

369
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,890
isn't fighting shogun so that
to move it because of his,

370
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,610
he,

371
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,810
since he lives here in Germany,

372
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,411
I chose,

373
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:09,560
well because of his things
going on in Florida with a,

374
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,700
with a felony or whatever these
he's waiting on [inaudible].

375
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,701
So yeah.

376
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,590
So he can travel to Chile
so they have to do it.

377
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,100
Oh,

378
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,933
he beat somebody up.

379
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,690
I'm still on,

380
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,790
but they had to take it off Chile.

381
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,883
Oh,

382
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,070
that cards taking the hit.

383
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,000
Who's,

384
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,930
mine's a monster.

385
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,793
He's a monster.

386
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,500
But you know Damien Maia is a
monster on the ground and oops.

387
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:29,090
Mons.

388
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,830
Most of his game is the ground.

389
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,400
Yeah.

390
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,233
It's ground and pound.

391
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,440
Most of his game.

392
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,370
It's going to be very interesting to see
or to do other things because of a fun,

393
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,291
it'd be honest,

394
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,090
the big John McCarthy is a big
motherfucker to be interviewing people.

395
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,531
You know what I mean?

396
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:44,470
Look like I seen him
interviews with flyweights.

397
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,601
Yeah,

398
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:45,141
he's a big dude.

399
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:45,974
Like yikes.

400
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,510
Dan is about to drop some
fire on this mic cause he,

401
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:48,651
he,

402
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:48,891
you know,

403
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:49,191
he takes,

404
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,690
he takes after Connor a little too much.

405
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,100
Dropped some purifier.

406
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,993
What is he saying?

407
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,421
We got some volume,

408
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,254
Jamie.

409
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,840
Okay.

410
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,673
It's not working.

411
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,381
Okay.

412
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:19,370
Back to the drawing board.

413
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,743
A little work.

414
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,281
Dylan,

415
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:26,360
come at a seminar one.

416
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:27,380
Don't forget the seminar.

417
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:28,400
Walk Home Samurai.

418
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,590
I've heard that before.

419
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:30,751
Yeah,

420
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:31,551
never heard that before.

421
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:32,121
Come find me,

422
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:32,300
bro.

423
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,140
I'll give you some tips.

424
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,920
We need some work on that shit talking.

425
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,313
You

426
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,610
tighten it up.

427
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,190
Maybe find a diet and
find a doll in the back.

428
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:43,770
Yeah.

429
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,120
Well,

430
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,230
you know he's all fucking,

431
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:46,580
that may have been Connor's line.

432
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,810
Maybe he wrote it for him.

433
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,003
Could be

434
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,770
willing to die.

435
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,970
You're willing to die in that.

436
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:56,120
It might give them a free seminar.

437
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,200
Well,

438
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,220
Dylan dance can be a beast.

439
00:09:58,221 --> 00:09:59,054
A beat though.

440
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,620
Well,

441
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,850
especially if the bell torque
gives them the right matchup.

442
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,591
Why wouldn't you though?

443
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:04,424
It's his first year.

444
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,591
He's a wrestler too.

445
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:09,360
He wrestled and wrestled four
or five years growing up.

446
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,460
There's some good fights on this card.

447
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,380
Okay.

448
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,060
Hofeld Lavato versus Gerald Harris.

449
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:18,100
I liked that fight.

450
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,620
That's a fight.

451
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,790
That's an interesting fight,

452
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,624
man.

453
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,330
Nelson versus Mirko Cro cop.

454
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:28,040
They'd been given him the test in
some had been giving him the test and

455
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,480
apparently do you,

456
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:30,650
but do you believe their testing?

457
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,210
When I hear a bell tars testing,

458
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,170
I always like wink wink.

459
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,670
That's like the Olympia Auto Mall.

460
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,500
Oh really?

461
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,383
What do you do?

462
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,010
You give him like a written test?

463
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,350
Did you take today

464
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,660
just to rich dudes are fucking eating
hay and snort and they're on so much echo

465
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,494
poise.

466
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,590
That's like a Canelo.

467
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,051
He came back,

468
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,480
he did the hair falls,

469
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:57,314
we'll say,

470
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,910
but people are saying bullshit though.

471
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,833
Why?

472
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,121
I guess the the,

473
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:01,911
the way it was done,

474
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,260
like how do we know what's his hair?

475
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:05,570
It's coming from his camp exclusive load.

476
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:05,850
Is it?

477
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,590
Yeah,

478
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,061
it's true.

479
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:07,311
I was like,

480
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:08,360
come on man.

481
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:08,721
Yeah.

482
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:09,240
It's his kid.

483
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,750
He tested positive for
being a 55 year old trainer.

484
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,900
That's a bummer man.

485
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:21,980
That that fight is down because now
he's fighting want to Edmonds boys.

486
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,230
He's fighting a triple g's.

487
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,840
[inaudible] took that fucking fun.

488
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,763
Wild Ass.

489
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,630
How Fun would that,

490
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,493
he's got a,

491
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,390
he's got an Indian name.

492
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:32,841
One of them.

493
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:33,540
Armenian.

494
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,790
That brother and characters.

495
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,653
Enjoy that man.

496
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,100
Yeah.

497
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,590
Well what are you going to do?

498
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,010
Glendale in the house.

499
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,880
Enjoy that.

500
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,440
Fucking Armenians love to fight,

501
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:45,730
man.

502
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:45,840
Yeah,

503
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,431
there's tough.

504
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:47,264
As they come,

505
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,040
I let them fade or 36 and five Frank Mir.

506
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,160
18 wow.

507
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,911
Yeah.

508
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:55,630
I'm a favor.

509
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,710
He looked Kinda tick thick.

510
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,240
Yeah.

511
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,110
You don't look good.

512
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,330
They need to let him find Japan again.

513
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,140
Get him on the right
mixture is looking good.

514
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,370
I said frank was like,

515
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,110
you were jacked right now.

516
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,850
I was talking about fit or I said I would.

517
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,700
I was jumped to half guard.

518
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,061
He's like,

519
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:13,451
what would you do?

520
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:13,691
I was like,

521
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,220
I went play that striking
down on the first round.

522
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,780
Jumped to half guard if
I had your half guard.

523
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,640
He's like getting good on the
ground and just around town.

524
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,513
There's no death.

525
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,383
I know,

526
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,680
I know,

527
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:23,901
man.

528
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:26,800
I remember the way Dritan
O'gara oh for sure.

529
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:27,320
This Day.

530
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,180
Some of the best.

531
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,590
However a different game though.

532
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:29,981
Yeah,

533
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:33,070
I'm super suspicious about all
those old fights now though.

534
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,930
You know I'm super suspicious.

535
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,410
Breach brothers super suspicious because
then he comes here and just get fucking

536
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:39,244
ran soon.

537
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,630
Super sororities

538
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,390
that those weren't fake.

539
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:43,721
No,

540
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:43,931
no,

541
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:44,141
no.

542
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:45,100
And that's not what I mean.

543
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,091
That's not what I mean.

544
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:47,140
I mean steroids,

545
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,550
I mean performance enhancing drugs.

546
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,640
I mean we're looking at a different human.

547
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,481
That's what I'm thinking.

548
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:52,680
Yeah.

549
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,513
It comes in the state,

550
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,120
aren't you guys just saying Bella tour?

551
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:58,750
Don't really check with joking
around or they do some check in.

552
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,510
They do have state athletic commission,

553
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,001
Russia.

554
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:01,900
We know that date.

555
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,150
Well then within Japan,

556
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,580
Japan was encouraging 100% you know,

557
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:09,340
and who knows who was doing
what and who wasn't doing what.

558
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:12,640
But when you talk to the guys who
were over there like ants and anyway,

559
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,360
and he'll tell you they had it in
capital letters in the contract,

560
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,660
we will not test you for steroids.

561
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,850
And then you look at Vander Lee when he
weighed two 18 when he fought cro cop,

562
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,310
he was heavier than cro
cop when he fought cro cop.

563
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,740
I mean that is just fucking bananas.

564
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:30,881
But if you look at that,

565
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:31,031
Joe,

566
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:33,570
you cannot say that about the
UFC till you saw that came in.

567
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:34,404
You definitely can.

568
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,590
You definitely can.

569
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,090
But you can.

570
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,540
Up until the point I think it's a hair
less because they cannot test days.

571
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,600
The courage to not TRT days.

572
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:46,090
You're right about TRT
days like Trt v tour,

573
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,950
we always ran yard that was leak.

574
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:48,720
All those boys.

575
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,420
Yeah.

576
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,650
The guys who were on TRT,

577
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,740
including Frank Frank
was on TRT for awhile.

578
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,020
They were telling fighters
to go up a weight class.

579
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:55,241
They're like,

580
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:55,660
you don't want it.

581
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,493
You need to go up.

582
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,540
Well,

583
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,970
they were also telling
fighters that will let you win.

584
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,051
You know,

585
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:02,884
we know guys.

586
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,770
That was k one same shit.

587
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,970
It's Japan.

588
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,910
He was talking some
dark web shit right now.

589
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,460
Qa now share.

590
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,560
You ruined my childhood.

591
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,000
Cow died tonight.

592
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,133
Listen,

593
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,590
there's,

594
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,160
there was just a lot of shenanigans going
on back in the day and a lot of it was

595
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:21,850
also,

596
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,030
they were just trying to compete with
the UFC and they were trying to do a big

597
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,260
business and it was awesome.

598
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:26,951
It was awesome.

599
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:27,610
It was awesome.

600
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,420
It was awesome.

601
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,253
I mean,

602
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,750
they were superheroes.

603
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,750
One name for you,

604
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,920
Bob Sapp.

605
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,580
Oh fuck.

606
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,361
Come on son.

607
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:34,691
Come on.

608
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:34,991
Sap.

609
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,180
What is 375 pounds with ABS?

610
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,253
I loved that.

611
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,600
He was so jealous.

612
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,230
Three 70 with ABS.

613
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,420
Three 70 and like not bad.

614
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:45,250
Cardio wasn't bad.

615
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:45,940
Not Bad.

616
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,091
Oh,

617
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,380
he was on everything though,

618
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:48,214
bro.

619
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,210
Everything.

620
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:53,370
They made all the EPRs and
the pis and the EPA is,

621
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:56,090
and if he was on the
Environmental Protection Agency,

622
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:56,751
Dea,

623
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:57,441
the FBI,

624
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:58,274
the CIA,

625
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,290
he was so big,

626
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,980
he stood out so big in Japan.

627
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,180
He couldn't go anywhere.

628
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:05,331
Well,

629
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:08,630
you remember when he was like a
super duper star over in Japan.

630
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,710
But then,

631
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,370
um,

632
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,770
there was a situation with,

633
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:14,260
I believe it was k one,

634
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:14,810
they,

635
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,170
they wanted him to sign a
contract after he fought.

636
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:18,981
And he was like,

637
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,320
I wanted to contract before fucking fight,

638
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:21,890
man.

639
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,640
Like we got us,

640
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,140
I got to see the contract.

641
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,011
And they like,

642
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:25,311
you know,

643
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,860
you fight and then contract.

644
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,290
He's like,

645
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,280
fuck you.

646
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,121
This is crazy.

647
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:32,390
So he walked out of the fight
and he was done after that.

648
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,380
He was the main event.

649
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,880
So he's doing dope.

650
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,830
He's lucky he didn't get Yakuza.

651
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,850
Who's a style?

652
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,330
I think there's 57% child thinks.

653
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,980
How about jail has to
fight the winner of this.

654
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,290
That's crazy dude.

655
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,101
How good it chilled.

656
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:47,030
Look against rampage.

657
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,200
He looked good.

658
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,910
His wrestling is always good.

659
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,893
He prepares,

660
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,793
he's smart.

661
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,800
I mean say what you want about shale son,

662
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:55,970
and you know that guy is always prepared.

663
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,020
Neiman Gracie.

664
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,913
Ooh,

665
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,360
this is interesting.

666
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,150
I don't know anything about Javier Torres.

667
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:03,650
Don't anything about Javier Torres.

668
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,910
Hopefully it's Jujitsu is good.

669
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,773
Yeah.

670
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,880
Probably not as good as even Gracie's.

671
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,283
Hm.

672
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,120
Interesting.

673
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,900
I mean,

674
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,220
no one could say anything.

675
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,301
Look,

676
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:16,070
whatever everybody was on back then.

677
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:18,020
Fado was still beating everybody's ass.

678
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,520
So if they were all on the same shit,

679
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,390
Fado was still beating everybody up.

680
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:25,670
At the caveat to that is when he came
over to the u s he got dealt with with our

681
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:26,180
guts.

682
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:26,870
Yes.

683
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,703
Pretty quickly.

684
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,640
He struggles.

685
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,361
Brett Rogers,

686
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:29,920
right?

687
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,070
She'll a little bit with him.

688
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,020
Gets dealt with with Dan Henderson.

689
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:35,300
Anderson beat the fuck out of him.

690
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,210
[inaudible] foot Silva some up.

691
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,451
Yeah.

692
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:39,080
He beat her loss.

693
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,750
Tim Silvia,

694
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,830
Alaska Laskey.

695
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,560
He beat her Lawsky and affliction.

696
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,270
There was no testing and affliction.

697
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,220
That affliction thing was the wild,

698
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:47,054
wild west.

699
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,930
They were the,

700
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,390
I mean that was their teacher
does guys on a huge event.

701
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:50,960
Yeah.

702
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,120
Wasn't there when he got hit,

703
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,250
he was winning the fight.

704
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,870
He was whooping his ass
through a flying knee.

705
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,421
He was,

706
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:59,420
he was dealing with them in the standup,

707
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,600
and then he did something real stupid
and he got clipped with a haymaker.

708
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,390
That was such a crazy
knockout was such a cool,

709
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,440
cause I lost you front.

710
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:07,460
Kicked him to the gut.

711
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,840
It was a box in the mob.

712
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:09,591
He looked good.

713
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:10,760
Our Lawsky look good,

714
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,410
but he did something really nutty.

715
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,010
And then all of a sudden,

716
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,030
boom,

717
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,550
bom.

718
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,090
So fader Tim Silva under Lawsky,

719
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,560
Tim Silvia fight was amazing.

720
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,933
That was amazing.

721
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,080
But he looked like fate
or in that forever.

722
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:22,890
Like that was the,

723
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,020
and then the strike force.

724
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,360
Then you got a lead XC,

725
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:25,700
right?

726
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,870
And you got Brett Rodgers,

727
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,670
Dan Henderson for doom.

728
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:29,991
It was,

729
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:30,080
it,

730
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,580
was it a lead?

731
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,820
XC was in a,

732
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,440
was it an aliyah?

733
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,530
I see when he fought.

734
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,000
Uh,

735
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Brett Rogers or no,

736
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:36,490
it was that strike a strike force.

737
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:36,940
I think it,

738
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,773
Strikeforce.

739
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,100
I think elite x was just Kimbo.

740
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,053
I don't think,

741
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,500
I don't think Fred Rogers was
the lead Xc Miko and crazy.

742
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:47,540
You think you're going
crazy because remember,

743
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,370
strike force,

744
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:48,541
uh,

745
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,530
Brett Rogers thought Overeem
when Overeem was ubering,

746
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,200
maneuver him.

747
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,290
Fuck hit him.

748
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,170
He didn't just,

749
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,450
he hit him with a leg kick like 15,

750
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,650
20 seconds into the fight.

751
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,970
One of those studding Hollins style
leg kicks and AC breaded Roger's face.

752
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:03,240
Like,

753
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,200
Oh shit,

754
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,063
that's not a snowflake.

755
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,650
No,

756
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,500
but Overeem hit him with some tech.

757
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,540
Nick hit him at that real technique that
that's why the argument for Steve Bay

758
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:16,440
being the best heavyweight of all time
is legit argument cause he's fought

759
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:17,250
clean.

760
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,300
He's never been,

761
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:18,960
you know,

762
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,320
it's my,

763
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,700
well he's defended the most,

764
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,540
the,

765
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,291
the UFC title,

766
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,880
which is the hardest title to defend
in terms of like historically no one's

767
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,090
defended it more than him.

768
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,320
He defended it three times.

769
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,790
Nobody else out beat too.

770
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,350
The only issue with that,

771
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,090
if you want to argue against the Bin,

772
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:33,421
I'm not,

773
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:35,130
I think he's the best
of all time hemmer cane.

774
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,600
But if you want argue
that you're going to say,

775
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:38,520
well the guy's he's beat
aren't in their prime.

776
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,870
That's a good point.

777
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,853
That's a good point.

778
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,060
I think that's true.

779
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,340
What does a Scientology network,

780
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,110
what curious.

781
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:46,980
I just started everything.

782
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,660
Get the fuck out of here and there are,

783
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,610
they're advertising it on paramount.

784
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,800
Holy curious.

785
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,220
Do you have a pub?

786
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,330
Despots paramount.

787
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,910
Well they might be paid.

788
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:56,340
They got,

789
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:56,940
that's time.

790
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,240
Whose money or drive by
Scientology building.

791
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,230
I drove by last night.

792
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,040
Oh,

793
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,680
I got the test.

794
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,540
I want it in there.

795
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,410
I got the test.

796
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,000
I went to one of those
things that you did.

797
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:06,840
I held the cans.

798
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:07,440
Yeah,

799
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,440
I was a film and a TV show for CBS and
we were outside in San Diego and a while

800
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:13,860
we had some downtime.

801
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,700
They had this thing set up like a stress
test and you go and you hold onto these

802
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,260
cans and ask your questions.

803
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,170
I think I want to say Brian
did stand up in there,

804
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,760
so one asks me to go up there and do,

805
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,930
I either did stand up or like a Ted talk
or some shit in Scientology building

806
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,361
really?

807
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:29,790
And he did something weird to talk.

808
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:30,601
Well,

809
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:31,470
he was taken,

810
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,710
he was taken acting lessons with a guy
who was a rabid scientologist and then I

811
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:42,681
went to see Brian's acting
teachers sing songs from musicals,

812
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,780
not even a musical,

813
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,230
just the songs from the musical seconds.

814
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,620
Oh,

815
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,210
it was amazing.

816
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,021
It was great.

817
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:53,500
Me and Brian were high.

818
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:55,620
Is Jesus on the space shuttle?

819
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,030
I mean we were gone.

820
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,800
We were hugging each other.

821
00:19:58,801 --> 00:19:59,760
Why it was going on.

822
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,710
We couldn't believe how ridiculous it was.

823
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,070
Like oh,

824
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,990
he either did like a motivational
talk or stand up there though.

825
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,160
Well he was,

826
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,640
you know,

827
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,070
which is a thing about acting classes.

828
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,200
A lot of my ex girlfriend,

829
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,010
one of her acting classes when I first
moved to La and I started dating,

830
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,030
this chick was an actress.

831
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,590
Her acting class was assigned technology
based act in class and apparently it's

832
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:23,550
really common.

833
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,301
There's a lot,

834
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:26,010
or at least it was at the time.

835
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,770
They get kind of up with
everything coming out with that.

836
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:30,270
Leah Ramy or whatever her name is.

837
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,700
Leah Remini.

838
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,931
Yeah.

839
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,430
It should be like the gigs up.

840
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,990
There's the internet,

841
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,570
you know,

842
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,360
podcasts when I'm with full of Shit.

843
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:36,900
It is.

844
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,480
Some people are just dying to get took.

845
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,770
They're just dying.

846
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,271
So I was like,

847
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:42,421
Yo,

848
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:42,720
Brendan,

849
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,720
you can be the next
fucking expendable seven.

850
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,740
You just got to jump into the,

851
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,790
I'd probably check it out.

852
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,010
What happens with girls with girls?

853
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:52,270
Apparently they come to them,

854
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,360
then they'll arrange like
boyfriend situations and weddings.

855
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,760
What happened was Tommy Cruz,

856
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:58,060
right?

857
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,500
Allegedly Katie Holmes,

858
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,281
allegedly,

859
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:00,641
she said,

860
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:01,410
fuck that noise.

861
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,470
Now she's with Jamie Foxx.

862
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,830
I worked for it.

863
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,140
He was was up to do,

864
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:07,490
do,

865
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:07,770
do,

866
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,031
do,

867
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:08,210
do,

868
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,670
do shit.

869
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,390
Yeah.

870
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,500
Fox Lake down.

871
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,420
Damn.

872
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,840
I know she had fucking,

873
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,563
yeah,

874
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,530
Tom Cruise's laying low right now.

875
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,070
He apparently did some crazy ass stunt
for mission impossible where they had a

876
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:28,570
film at like a hundred times.

877
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:29,740
Did you see it now?

878
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:31,300
I heard Jamie hit it.

879
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,381
You didn't see it.

880
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:36,130
He jumped from a bit from building to
building that he does all his own stunts.

881
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:36,231
He's,

882
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:37,090
he is a bad ass.

883
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah.

884
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,890
He does all his own stunts.

885
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,220
It even when he's flying out of the hell
copies that he doesn't let anyone else

886
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:43,054
do it.

887
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,180
He's jumping from building to
building and he just barely misses it.

888
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,960
And from another building going
down is he lands flip first,

889
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,910
like into the building
and it's fucking ankle.

890
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,110
He broke his shit and he's like cut.

891
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,530
He's still like finishes the,

892
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,520
the take.

893
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:57,710
Yeah.

894
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,270
He's like [inaudible] [inaudible]
they had to cop going,

895
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,360
I need to see this.

896
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,470
He's a bit of a bad ass.

897
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,600
53.

898
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,370
I don't know man.

899
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:07,210
It's not young.

900
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,931
It's not young.

901
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:08,950
Kind of killing it though.

902
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:09,971
Listen,

903
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:11,560
that Scientology shit is real.

904
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,903
It's got him.

905
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,993
Vince.

906
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,980
We need to see this.

907
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:16,920
That el Hubbard shit got him caught.

908
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,640
They have so much power in Hollywood.

909
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,420
Uh,

910
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,991
how does that work?

911
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:23,500
Just Tom Cruise [inaudible] him and
John Travolta got this cord to get this.

912
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,310
Boom.

913
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,930
Oh Shit.

914
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,290
Oh,

915
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,590
that is crazy.

916
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,150
But you're Tom Cruise.

917
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:31,984
Look at this.

918
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,023
Yeah.

919
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,330
Oh,

920
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,610
she snapped his shit son.

921
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,693
Dan.

922
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,180
Mama see mission impossible.

923
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,310
Fuck is just because of that shit.

924
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,580
The kid finishes though.

925
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,670
Like a baller that's top gun.

926
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:50,170
So down.

927
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,490
Well you take the big bucks.

928
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,200
That's quite a jump to,

929
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,640
that's a quite a distance.

930
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,680
You know all of the scenes in
the helicopter and all that.

931
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:57,670
Where these hanging out?

932
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:57,880
Yeah.

933
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,890
That's all him and he's white,

934
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,550
white.

935
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,383
So that jump

936
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,550
man came one time camp camp.

937
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,290
They can get a rope.

938
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,050
Definitely had a that to,

939
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,060
that rope wasn't there.

940
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:13,894
He would have lived.

941
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:14,890
Right.

942
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:15,640
He made it.

943
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,473
He actually made it.

944
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,890
I help him.

945
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,240
You don't think they kind of like,

946
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:19,391
no,

947
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:19,511
no,

948
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:19,691
no,

949
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:19,811
no,

950
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:20,050
no.

951
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,680
Watch it again.

952
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,460
Play it again.

953
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,970
I don't know if there's no rope and
he makes that this is the rope kind of

954
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:27,280
holding back the rubs.

955
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,114
Carrying them.

956
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,361
Oh,

957
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:29,490
so the rubs assisting him.

958
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,620
Yeah,

959
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,040
for sure.

960
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,221
All right.

961
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:30,670
Let me see.

962
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:30,881
Yeah,

963
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:31,714
for sure.

964
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,430
Look like the rope was behind him.

965
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,300
Yeah.

966
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,300
I thought the rope was just to catch
him cautionary because the rope,

967
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:41,680
like that's a weird thing that
the rope is assisting him.

968
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:41,891
Like,

969
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:42,191
man,

970
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:43,540
how do you even plan that?

971
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,591
That's kind of cool.

972
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,730
The real kind of catapult,

973
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,720
maybe assistant system
behind the rubs behind him.

974
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:50,570
No rope is not helping.

975
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,900
Oh,

976
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,733
and there's one above.

977
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,873
There's two.

978
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,340
Yeah.

979
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,560
Yeah,

980
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,040
you're right.

981
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,560
Yeah,

982
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:55,751
yeah,

983
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:55,901
yeah,

984
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:56,091
yeah.

985
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:56,561
That's what it catches.

986
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,280
Mysteries and fall all
the way down and die.

987
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,550
Yeah.

988
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,600
Well that's what it's for.

989
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:00,770
That's what my point was.

990
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,140
I still think he has a
little bit of likability.

991
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,860
Achilles tendon tore off.

992
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,850
Yeah.

993
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,310
That looks like the ropes carrying him.

994
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,490
I bet he has drugs that we
don't even know about fixing it.

995
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,671
Yeah,

996
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:14,690
they get that from Mars.

997
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,020
Yeah.

998
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,940
Get that shit from they,

999
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,740
they pull it out of the fake
rocks that they pull out a Mars.

1000
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:19,791
Here's another one.

1001
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,081
Let me see.

1002
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:21,560
The other ones hung on
the side of the plane.

1003
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,603
Well that's fun.

1004
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,980
And as he attached with a rope to yeah,

1005
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:25,431
a little bit,

1006
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:28,640
but still felt like shit.

1007
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,620
He still really gets taken off.

1008
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,850
He's hanging there.

1009
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,750
That's nuts.

1010
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,220
That's fucking niceness.

1011
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,810
That's bananas.

1012
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,610
That man's crazy rope though.

1013
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:37,940
Right?

1014
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,530
You know,

1015
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,720
you taste surprised.

1016
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,880
You'd be surprised at how hard it
is to hang for long periods of time.

1017
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,720
You know,

1018
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,150
when I hurt my shoulder
and I started hanging,

1019
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:47,541
you know,

1020
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:49,010
just holding onto a bar and hang.

1021
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,710
I was stunned at how little weak you are.

1022
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:52,160
How,

1023
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,460
you know,

1024
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,360
I do a lot of chips,

1025
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,370
but I can't hold on for
more than like two minutes.

1026
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:57,470
Something you have to condition for sure.

1027
00:24:57,471 --> 00:24:58,910
Really conditioned the
shit out of yourself.

1028
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,570
You think you're going to like save
your ass and like hang on the side of a

1029
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:03,321
plane for like,

1030
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:03,830
you're screwed.

1031
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,951
No,

1032
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:04,784
you're dead.

1033
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,840
You can't do it.

1034
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,750
Oh Damn.

1035
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,583
Lady pushed Kendall and said,

1036
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,271
get out of my face,

1037
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:08,880
bitch.

1038
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,190
He got the camera too close to me.

1039
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,410
But shokes on outside.

1040
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,200
Um,

1041
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,100
we had a fear factor episode
once where people had hang from.

1042
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:16,430
Um,

1043
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,120
there was a bridge and there was a bar
on the bridge was men and women and you

1044
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:23,720
hung as long as you could hold it until
he dropped into the water and the girls

1045
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:24,560
beat the guys.

1046
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,890
How long were they hold lighter?

1047
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,410
Not Very Long.

1048
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,520
Not very minutes.

1049
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,450
No,

1050
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,200
no,

1051
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,531
no.

1052
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,810
I don't think anybody
beat like two minutes.

1053
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,370
20 seconds or some shit.

1054
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,573
Here we go.

1055
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,790
Neiman Gracie ready to choke him,

1056
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:39,500
mother fucker.

1057
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,000
That's how I saw him fight was on that.

1058
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:41,630
Uh,

1059
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,260
uh,

1060
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,850
Newark,

1061
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,160
uh,

1062
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,210
Med square garden card.

1063
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,031
I think it's hens.

1064
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:46,864
Those nephew.

1065
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,300
Yes.

1066
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,720
Correct.

1067
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,350
Yeah.

1068
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,520
He looks hyper aggressive.

1069
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,050
He looks like a hen zone nephew.

1070
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,270
Big Kid man.

1071
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,370
And so the other guy has a hobby.

1072
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:55,490
Oh,

1073
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,690
tour Javier Torres.

1074
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:57,524
Is that his name

1075
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,033
to say Jane?

1076
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,950
Yeah.

1077
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,783
Yeah.

1078
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,320
Did you see Roy McDonald ask him
about Astra to sign with Delta?

1079
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:07,000
Yeah.

1080
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,400
And Ben asked her wants to do it to

1081
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,570
Ben asked her and still owes
fights with one fc though.

1082
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,970
So they would have to do some
sort of a contract with him.

1083
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,241
Yeah.

1084
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,410
He owes two fights.

1085
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,640
He goes two fights.

1086
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:20,450
One MFC.

1087
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,820
I know you're listing do us all a solid,

1088
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:24,140
do all the hardcores assault,

1089
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,060
let them out.

1090
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,750
And so he had never going to let them out.

1091
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,590
What they would do is they would cope
promote and it's possible you're not,

1092
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,730
if he wants to fight in the UFC,

1093
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,510
it's possible.

1094
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,343
Oh hell.

1095
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,580
Co-Promote with one FC,

1096
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:35,271
you would have to,

1097
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:39,470
it would have to be favorable conditions
with the UFC where like they just,

1098
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,160
you know,

1099
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,680
you can make some sort of a deal with
one of seeking stream at assumption.

1100
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,840
They would have to be something or
they get them a piece of the revenue,

1101
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,700
but it would have to be a very small,

1102
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,920
the odds are already against them.

1103
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:52,830
The sign with the assignment,

1104
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,190
I know you gotta make this deal with
one FC and Dana is my kick rocks.

1105
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,340
He should do is he should
get out of that contract.

1106
00:26:59,341 --> 00:26:59,810
That's what he did.

1107
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,380
Just smoked two dude's real fast.

1108
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:02,550
Just smash two dudes.

1109
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,810
Just gimme two cans.

1110
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:05,580
But he's the can crusher over there.

1111
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,361
Rich Franklin's,

1112
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:07,650
the guy who does the,

1113
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,810
how dare you call him king crusher.

1114
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,960
Matt Hume is to Matt Hume's
a part of when I was fellow.

1115
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,780
What's up,

1116
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,490
let's get this one of the
greatest fights all the time.

1117
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:15,324
Role and my man.

1118
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,030
Well who would you have in fight Woodley?

1119
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,470
He's friends with,

1120
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,910
with their trading partners.

1121
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,000
I'd have them fight GSP first
and they'll have a fight.

1122
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,570
Could be.

1123
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,520
Do you think to GSP would take that fight

1124
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,070
but nobody knows who asks.

1125
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:33,030
Her name is outside of the core fans.

1126
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:33,541
He said he would.

1127
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:33,910
Could be.

1128
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,940
Could be seven months ago.

1129
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,793
70 yeah,

1130
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,130
cause people start at 70 oh shit.

1131
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,690
That is the fight I want to see.

1132
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,070
It could be.

1133
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,820
I want to be and no ass grin.

1134
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,150
Oh me too screen Khabib is
what I would want to say.

1135
00:27:44,151 --> 00:27:47,910
That's my number one fight
because good luck taking GSP down.

1136
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,820
Just good luck and good
luck standing with them too.

1137
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,621
You know the,

1138
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:52,291
the standup,

1139
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:55,920
there's a big gap between
Ben Asker in Standup at GSP,

1140
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:58,380
so this isn't a big gap
between Ben astrons grappling.

1141
00:27:58,381 --> 00:27:59,840
Just scrapping cap.

1142
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,540
It's true.

1143
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,410
It's amazing fight.

1144
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:01,980
Wow.

1145
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,720
There's a big gap between what has
grins is grappling and GSPS grappling.

1146
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,070
Really big gap.

1147
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,323
There's a big gap.

1148
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,980
Then ask her shit.

1149
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,590
Olympian legitimate and GSP.

1150
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,010
Yeah.

1151
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,850
GSP and aspirin.

1152
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,450
Big Gap.

1153
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,283
Yup.

1154
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,280
If they wrestled,

1155
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,113
that's great.

1156
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,170
Okay.

1157
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:20,820
[inaudible] out.

1158
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,391
Good Woodley.

1159
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:26,391
[inaudible] Woodley like GSP has
more takedowns in UFC history.

1160
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,100
You're right.

1161
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,300
I never had a guide at the level of
aspirin when it comes to wrestling,

1162
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,210
he's a black belt in Jiu Jitsu.

1163
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:33,660
No,

1164
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,230
you're right.

1165
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,220
If it gets to the ground,

1166
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,280
the best,

1167
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,600
the best guy he fought as
far as wrestling credentials,

1168
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,280
who probably Josh Koscheck my,

1169
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:41,760
yeah.

1170
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,310
My thought would be that
GSP would never let,

1171
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:46,710
oh,

1172
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,850
he's doubled up to,

1173
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,250
okay,

1174
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,580
this dude's in trouble.

1175
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,020
That's dudes in trouble.

1176
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,130
It's crazy how leg locks are now making
their way much more prominently in in

1177
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,880
MMA now you've seen much more leg lock
action unless you're focused on it.

1178
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:03,361
I feel like,

1179
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:03,661
okay,

1180
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:04,494
you're fighting.

1181
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,960
Dylan Dannis would have six
weeks to get ready for that.

1182
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,600
You're not going to learn
the lace lock games.

1183
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,443
That fear.

1184
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,850
There's no way to know.

1185
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,370
He got just can't get down
against a high level leg locker.

1186
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,910
It's going to take you
four years to catch him.

1187
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:15,590
Right.

1188
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,080
These guys,

1189
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,070
they're so far behind.

1190
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:17,281
They're like,

1191
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:17,821
Fuck Dylan.

1192
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:19,220
Dance leg locked.

1193
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:19,860
There's two ways.

1194
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,693
Here it is.

1195
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,290
Oh,

1196
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,220
he's doing the right thing.

1197
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,083
Yeah,

1198
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,770
but his both legs are tied up.

1199
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:25,921
Man.

1200
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,390
He's so stuck.

1201
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,730
That's such a gross feeling.

1202
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:30,780
You can do it in two years.

1203
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,670
It doesn't have to be four years average,

1204
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,013
two years if you're with,

1205
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,550
if you're with a good coach.

1206
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:37,380
And I try to battle someone at like,

1207
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,640
you know Henzel Gracie guy leg lock level,

1208
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,420
it's going to take you at least two years
to to stalemate and least and he got

1209
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:47,820
to be trained on every got out.

1210
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,071
Yeah.

1211
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:49,660
You got to post guys
guys aren't doing that.

1212
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:49,810
Yeah.

1213
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,350
And that's the thing with them and may
is a generally in MMA leg locks were

1214
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:53,981
thought of as a,

1215
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:54,340
as a,

1216
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,001
as a technique.

1217
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,570
You don't really ever need to even
focus on cause it just an MMA,

1218
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:02,000
there were too many people have
gotten knocked out going for leg lock.

1219
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:05,560
So the general consensus is don't
really worry about leg locks and MMA.

1220
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:06,940
They're too dangerous anyways,

1221
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,710
but there are um,

1222
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,110
there you can't get knocked out.

1223
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:11,831
It is dangerous.

1224
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:12,281
And in my,

1225
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:13,240
but they still work.

1226
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:18,270
You just got to know which leg locked
positions are the safest and nothing else

1227
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:19,234
is working out.

1228
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,650
If you can't take the guy down,

1229
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,550
he's beating your ass and it's the third
round you lost the first two rounds is

1230
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:27,310
the last round that you
know going for a heel hook.

1231
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,940
It might be a great idea and if you
practice them and if you're good at them,

1232
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,160
you have hope in that last round.

1233
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,203
You know what I mean?

1234
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,660
Don't necessarily go for leg locks
right away because it is risky.

1235
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:40,480
See if you could take them down first
so you can get on top and passed his

1236
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:40,740
guard.

1237
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,710
See if he can get his back.

1238
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,390
If you can't and it's too dangerous,

1239
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,960
then at some point your coaches and you,

1240
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:46,721
you got to decide,

1241
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:47,290
okay,

1242
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,060
it's time to go to plan B.

1243
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,820
Plan C and leg locks should
always be the last resort.

1244
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,110
You know to remember Marco,

1245
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:54,370
who else against Gary Goodrich?

1246
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,850
Gary Goodrich was beaten
his ass the whole fight.

1247
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,110
Last 45 seconds.

1248
00:30:59,111 --> 00:30:59,430
Marco,

1249
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,610
who was pulled out a heel hook.

1250
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,410
That's what we used to call them member.

1251
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,080
I called Mary.

1252
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,600
Who else looks well?

1253
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,300
That's what we used to call heel hooks.

1254
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,450
Hail Mary Helix,

1255
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,251
the last resort.

1256
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:10,084
It was last resort.

1257
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,360
Paul Harvey's Kinda was the one that
really made it famous for a while,

1258
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:14,460
but then he was getting fucked up.

1259
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:15,370
When you thought Allen belts,

1260
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,860
black belts,

1261
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,261
it was just like,

1262
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:19,130
I'm gonna sit down on this and
just punch you in the food.

1263
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,250
You're really prepared for that.

1264
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,061
He's also a black,

1265
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:24,280
when you get to the point with
your leg locks where you can,

1266
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,680
when you've been in the
fire for a couple of years,

1267
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:26,870
two,

1268
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,703
three or four years,

1269
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,580
and you're really good at leg locks and
you're going against someone else at

1270
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:31,414
that same level,

1271
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,340
leg locks probably are,

1272
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,950
aren't going to be the
deciding factor in that fight.

1273
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:37,030
They're going to nullify so,

1274
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,480
and then if you're going against a guy
who's really good at defending and he has

1275
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,860
good wrestling and good punches,

1276
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,610
shit,

1277
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,180
that's your mind.

1278
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,990
You might stay,

1279
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,720
you might want to stay
away from leg locks.

1280
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,030
Yeah,

1281
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,863
it all depends.

1282
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,560
It's the Matcha who did Belcher bring
in for his leg lock training because he

1283
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:53,440
brought in someone really
dobby Ramos and dean lister,

1284
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,470
Dean listers who brought him in and had a,

1285
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,341
you know,

1286
00:31:57,341 --> 00:31:59,200
he said it was just two months,

1287
00:31:59,201 --> 00:31:59,711
one month,

1288
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,180
two months of every day.

1289
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:03,130
Them attacking his legs and that's all in,

1290
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,083
that's all I needed.

1291
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,013
You Know

1292
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,070
Dobby Ramos is fighting 55 in the UFC,

1293
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:09,610
right,

1294
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,420
isn't he?

1295
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,253
I believe he's funny things.

1296
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,093
So five,

1297
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,220
that's a bad motherfucker,

1298
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,500
right?

1299
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,333
That motherfucker,

1300
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,020
his Jujitsu is top of the food chain.

1301
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,921
Abu Dhabi.

1302
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:22,921
In 2015 he had a sick flying arm bar and
one of his matches that were tourists

1303
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,791
just fell down.

1304
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,950
It makes me think that
his knee might be jacked

1305
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:28,721
isn't,

1306
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:28,811
he?

1307
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:29,740
Might be a little shaky.

1308
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,020
He looked like wobbly.

1309
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,921
He fell down.

1310
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:33,551
It looked weird.

1311
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,110
Bill tour ratings have been rough.

1312
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:35,850
Rough lately.

1313
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,611
I haven't been rough,

1314
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:36,881
rough,

1315
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:38,110
so hopefully this one's better.

1316
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,320
It's good for general.

1317
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:40,940
You know when,

1318
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,820
when bell toy and then UFC is
doing good for MMA in general.

1319
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:44,480
It's good.

1320
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,610
Well for MMA in general,

1321
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:48,110
we need big cards.

1322
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,441
I mean,

1323
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:53,390
it really needs to get more people
watching and these are entertaining fights

1324
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,820
and there's no reason why more
people shouldn't be watching.

1325
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,690
I think they got a real problem with
her name and was just said this forever.

1326
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,070
The name is stupid,

1327
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,050
but even that's a nice c,

1328
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,070
which is a great name.

1329
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:05,210
Their rating suck too.

1330
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:05,820
Sometimes.

1331
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,360
Sometimes the name matters.

1332
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,440
I don't think it matters at all.

1333
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:11,450
I don't think it matters
it with bands and music.

1334
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:11,601
Oh,

1335
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:12,434
how did you,

1336
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:13,821
you're like,

1337
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:14,430
who do you in the boat?

1338
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:14,930
Blowfish.

1339
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,530
You liked that name?

1340
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:15,690
Yeah,

1341
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,130
I do.

1342
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:16,431
Yeah.

1343
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:17,270
Where are they today?

1344
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,440
Flogging Molly.

1345
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:19,130
You like that?

1346
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:19,640
I do.

1347
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,470
It doesn't bother me fish

1348
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,080
because it works.

1349
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,160
Smashing pumpkins.

1350
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,150
If you weren't used to it,

1351
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,070
you would think if they never existed in,

1352
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,020
it's a great ball out of all of us.

1353
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,950
Don't realize that I'm with you.

1354
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:38,951
I wish you a flogging Molly pumpkin smash
brothers is one of my favorite bands

1355
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:39,860
of all time.

1356
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,310
I know,

1357
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,870
but if they never existed,

1358
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:44,630
and I told you my new bands
called smashing Pumpkins,

1359
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,261
you would say,

1360
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:45,620
dude,

1361
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,400
you got to change your mind.

1362
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,581
Oh,

1363
00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:47,414
I would love it.

1364
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,560
I fuck fucking love

1365
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,130
Billy Corgan to cool motherfucker.

1366
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:52,400
Man.

1367
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:52,860
Let me tell you,

1368
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,570
I had him on the pot.

1369
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:53,691
Yeah,

1370
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:54,530
he was great on the punch.

1371
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:55,364
So normal.

1372
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,293
I love that guy.

1373
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,681
The form.

1374
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,330
We should go that the form in October.

1375
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,223
Let's do it.

1376
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,050
Let's make it happen.

1377
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,840
You know texting,

1378
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:05,750
can you text me?

1379
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,800
You Texted Billy Corrigan.

1380
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,703
Buck.

1381
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,140
Are you able to take some assistant?

1382
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,000
Damn.

1383
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,400
You know that's one podcast.

1384
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,440
I wish I would have been here for God
that went in the Paul Stanley one.

1385
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:17,274
Shit,

1386
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,320
I wish I could have been here.

1387
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,790
Was that you had tool fan.

1388
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,530
Do you ever even meet
Maynard diver in shoes?

1389
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:21,770
Your man?

1390
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,180
I never met Maynard.

1391
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:27,410
Not they would get along cause he's
a Jujitsu trainer's a Jujitsu freak.

1392
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,790
I know his face belt but I'm
pretty sure he's got his brother.

1393
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,400
Yeah,

1394
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,670
he's a pro bono long time ago,

1395
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,371
but he's a,

1396
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:35,810
he comes in town for seminars.

1397
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,850
He goes to dynamics like Henry Akins,

1398
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:38,230
his place.

1399
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,063
Yeah he does.

1400
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,240
He goes to seminars down there.

1401
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,143
Jim.

1402
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,190
I know his friends very well.

1403
00:34:43,191 --> 00:34:44,001
I just don't know him.

1404
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:44,811
He's a great guy.

1405
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:46,300
Maynard is one of the
smartest people I know,

1406
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,580
man.

1407
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,860
Wicked smart wrestling league.

1408
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:49,640
No,

1409
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:49,881
no.

1410
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:50,750
That's Billy Corgan.

1411
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,613
Billy Corgan,

1412
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,420
the Nwa.

1413
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,650
He's said it.

1414
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,110
He's balls deep into loves progress.

1415
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,250
Does he own t and t?

1416
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,060
One of those?

1417
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,570
He wrote,

1418
00:34:59,570 --> 00:34:59,751
Oh,

1419
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:00,201
look at this.

1420
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:00,591
Look at this.

1421
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:00,880
I said,

1422
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,710
brother,

1423
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,340
it game over.

1424
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:04,070
That's it.

1425
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,880
That's a rap song.

1426
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,713
Tappity tap.

1427
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,850
I'm telling you that we're
getting all submissions tonight.

1428
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,393
That's guys,

1429
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:09,891
whoa.

1430
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:12,290
Lavato and Gerald Harris is
going to be a difficult one.

1431
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,730
I bet you it's all super excite.

1432
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,680
They're very good.

1433
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:20,390
Yeah,

1434
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,020
I'm good too.

1435
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,070
I might be over good.

1436
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,330
The whole frickin.

1437
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,163
Oh No.

1438
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,431
Billy Corgan,

1439
00:35:26,431 --> 00:35:26,640
he was,

1440
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,860
he was digging wrestling.

1441
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,360
I just got the pro wrestling.

1442
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,223
Loves it.

1443
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,190
He's a funny guy,

1444
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:31,461
man.

1445
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:32,720
He's a really smart dude.

1446
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,110
He's such a such a mom's
Mainers on into progress on,

1447
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:37,380
but what Mainer is into

1448
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,580
his own.

1449
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,170
He owns a vineyard and a restaurant.

1450
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,130
He's fucking crazy into why they talked
about wine for a solid hour on your

1451
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:44,410
blog.

1452
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,243
Just

1453
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,410
like God damn it,

1454
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:49,244
Bro.

1455
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,970
I thought you were going to
say the nice thing and say,

1456
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:57,804
yeah,

1457
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,733
it was interesting.

1458
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,690
That's a fascinating guy,

1459
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:04,830
but I'm all set on what?

1460
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,551
He's got.

1461
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:06,210
The clamp.

1462
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:06,331
Oh,

1463
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,081
you're screwed man.

1464
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:07,231
Yeah,

1465
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,100
that's a tight one,

1466
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:08,934
baby.

1467
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,550
You see how he manipulates those legs?

1468
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,900
That guy's done that too.

1469
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:14,670
A lot of fucking people when this point.

1470
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:15,001
He could've,

1471
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:15,510
he could've,

1472
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,020
he could've defended right here if you
would have just brought us a legs up and

1473
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:20,910
hooked his own left leg and turn away.

1474
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:21,180
Yeah.

1475
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,200
He could've just went like this.

1476
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,323
Just to annoy you.

1477
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,190
When guys do that though.

1478
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:27,120
You go to the,

1479
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,073
you have to go to the bank.

1480
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:28,830
Yeah,

1481
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,150
it,

1482
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,200
but you've got to do
that before he grabs you.

1483
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,490
But when a guy grabs his legs,

1484
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,050
do you still go to the impaler?

1485
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,563
I've seen you.

1486
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,233
I,

1487
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,490
I rarely do an arm triangle.

1488
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,570
Not Mounted.

1489
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,430
Rarely I stay in them out.

1490
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,740
Why do you stay in the
mountain on one side your side?

1491
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,660
Because that one defense
I was just telling you,

1492
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,170
you can't do it from the mind
that stops all arm triangles.

1493
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:52,920
There's,

1494
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,600
you're forced to go to another submission,

1495
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:55,860
which you're forced to take the back.

1496
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:56,820
You're kind of give up your back.

1497
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,640
But the guy who was about to get top wins,

1498
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:01,950
he gets another chance guys on your back.

1499
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,660
But that choke was in deep.

1500
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,800
When you um,

1501
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,670
when you tap a guy from the mount or
when you go to the arm triangle from the

1502
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,523
mount,

1503
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,500
what percentage of effectiveness do
you think it is in comparison to go on?

1504
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:12,960
Like,

1505
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,920
like a clock,

1506
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:14,850
like fully out.

1507
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,710
You May,

1508
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,170
there may be some added
Torque and the twist,

1509
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:20,340
but if you go butter mount,

1510
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:22,920
which is putting your butterflies
on top and you extend,

1511
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,023
you get,

1512
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,931
you don't need it,

1513
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:26,130
you don't need to get on the side.

1514
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,491
So it,

1515
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:29,010
is it just a new movement
that you have to master?

1516
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,360
Well it all depends,

1517
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:30,601
you know,

1518
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:30,851
on the,

1519
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:31,591
on your opponent,

1520
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:32,910
if he knows this defense,

1521
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,170
someone puts you in a arm triangle.

1522
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,004
Like this is caught,

1523
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,590
I would all have to do is
just bring this leg up.

1524
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,160
Like dude,

1525
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,430
get inverted and Gopro and there's
no way you're going to tap.

1526
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:42,300
See this is a thing.

1527
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:47,130
I've seen you separate guy's legs when
you were really into the impaler and I

1528
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,440
know I've done it to guys
that aren't very good,

1529
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,850
but I've seen you when you were
really into the impaler for awhile.

1530
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,840
No one did that though.

1531
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,693
The inhaler being,

1532
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,491
do you know when dibs?

1533
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:57,570
No one did the defense?

1534
00:37:57,571 --> 00:37:58,404
The defense is,

1535
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,270
yeah,

1536
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,450
the defense of grabbing your leg.

1537
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,780
Nobody did that and not back in the day
because everybody was laying down the

1538
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,810
way he did the arm triangle where he's
like laying inside control flat on his

1539
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:07,290
back.

1540
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,450
You obviously works.

1541
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:10,284
People are tapping,

1542
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,920
but it's easy to defend
if the guy knew it.

1543
00:38:13,921 --> 00:38:15,060
If the guy sees it coming,

1544
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,931
it's like as soon as,

1545
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:17,340
as soon as this arms in trouble,

1546
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:17,940
boom.

1547
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,660
You're right here.

1548
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,411
That's an interesting,

1549
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:22,410
maybe I'm confusing you with
somebody else I had because I know,

1550
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,060
I know during your,

1551
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,160
when you,

1552
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,970
there was a whole run when a lot of us
were into the impaler and then you also

1553
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:33,750
started putting it down where you would
put the Shin to the hip and really

1554
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:34,740
stretch a guy out.

1555
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,020
But

1556
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,930
Jesus,

1557
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:37,690
what?

1558
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,250
Jesus said,

1559
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,083
get that cut.

1560
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,571
Oh Shit.

1561
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,660
Who's cut is that damn cage
warriors earlier today?

1562
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,501
Oh my God,

1563
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:45,281
that's crazy.

1564
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,180
That's an eyebrow.

1565
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,060
That's full iron t his skull.

1566
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:49,840
That's,

1567
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,550
that's one of the biggest I've ever seen.

1568
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,710
Um,

1569
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,640
Jesus Cruz.

1570
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:58,210
I remember arguing with somebody
about it when someone was saying that,

1571
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,103
um,

1572
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,850
you can't separate a
guy's hands like that.

1573
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:01,031
I'm like,

1574
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:02,830
how long do you think
you can hold your hands?

1575
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,140
We need Mattson here and now we do.

1576
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,330
You can put Matt,

1577
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:06,860
Matt,

1578
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,571
but here's the thing.

1579
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:10,720
I have new Matt's coming so
we can do that right here.

1580
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,890
All you need is cameras that when
he done straight the defense dot,

1581
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:16,240
you could dive right in the middle of map.

1582
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,050
He says,

1583
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,550
because you don't know
what we're talking about.

1584
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,970
We want to understand if
you're going to have that,

1585
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,510
because there's new mats coming in
because the mats a that I'm getting from

1586
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,383
Fuji,

1587
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,780
the grappling ones are too slippery.

1588
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,441
They're,

1589
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:29,910
they're not,

1590
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,210
they don't have any texture to them.

1591
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,050
Zebra,

1592
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,040
I'm getting new zebras,

1593
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,970
best I Z,

1594
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,220
but have zebra in my office

1595
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,220
getting all new zebras.

1596
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,700
But Fuji makes a real good one
with a texture for striking.

1597
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,170
So for kicking and stuff,

1598
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:45,430
I need some texture.

1599
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,420
I can't,

1600
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,440
but on the ground it's fine.

1601
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,830
So I'm going to take the ones from the
ground and you need the texture for

1602
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:51,670
passing too.

1603
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,810
If you get all sweaty,

1604
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:53,644
you need the texture.

1605
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,130
Because at the mats I have now no tabs,

1606
00:39:56,131 --> 00:40:01,131
nobody complains that they purchased
slippers for wrestling cause the maths I

1607
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:04,810
have met are made for wrestling
shoes and wrestlers have shoes.

1608
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,813
So it's not an issue.

1609
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:11,050
When you're going barefoot
and doing Jujitsu and it
gets sweaty after like three

1610
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:11,920
or four rounds,

1611
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,450
passing becomes impossible.

1612
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:14,590
It's like passing on ice.

1613
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,450
Is it hot in here?

1614
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,390
So having a heart attack,

1615
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,760
cause it's harder than you guys are
sweating to having a heart attack.

1616
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,200
But if you feel the zebras they're made,

1617
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,490
they're made for barefoot,

1618
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,420
uh,

1619
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,050
traction.

1620
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,500
We've got a thermostat
in here seeking glory.

1621
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,270
Hebrews is what they put in my,

1622
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,123
my gym.

1623
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,153
But um,

1624
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,023
my gym at home.

1625
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,390
Yeah.

1626
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,010
But these out here,

1627
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:37,450
the Fuji is the smooth ones.

1628
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:38,230
Man.

1629
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,940
It's not good for kicking.

1630
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,571
Like Gwen,

1631
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,171
I'm kicking,

1632
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:42,460
I'm slipping around a lot.

1633
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,343
Like I don't,

1634
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,910
well for specially for
spinning and I spin,

1635
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,451
I need,

1636
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:47,320
I need traction.

1637
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,300
I have to have something where
I could push my foot off.

1638
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,080
I can't,

1639
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,190
like with round kicks,

1640
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:53,440
you can kind of get away with
it because of your foot slips.

1641
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,900
Your whole body's just kind of
moving and we're kind of match.

1642
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:57,370
You got to come in and you
already got it all hooked up.

1643
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,581
Yeah.

1644
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:58,361
It's already that they're out there.

1645
00:40:58,361 --> 00:40:59,030
I'll show him.

1646
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,530
Yeah.

1647
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,590
The other Fujis full of she's,

1648
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,860
but they're tatami mats.

1649
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,690
So they have,

1650
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,470
it's a pretty strong texture.

1651
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:06,220
It's a strategy.

1652
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,490
Decide,

1653
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:06,650
go.

1654
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,960
Those were the over zebra.

1655
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,533
Um,

1656
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,983
Jimmy Pedro.

1657
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:11,380
Oh,

1658
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:11,641
got you.

1659
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:13,350
Me Pedro went over to there and uh,

1660
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,620
he did my first place.

1661
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:14,911
He,

1662
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:15,744
you know,

1663
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,760
Olympic judo master is a bad motherfucker.

1664
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,800
He did my other place and so,

1665
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,220
you know,

1666
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:21,851
when he moved there,

1667
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:22,810
I just went with him there.

1668
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:23,770
Um,

1669
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,580
I liked him.

1670
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,460
I just don't think they're
the right thing for what I do.

1671
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,110
But the tatami ones with the heavy
texture is perfect for kickboxing.

1672
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,170
I mean you really,

1673
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,003
I need,

1674
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,690
especially if I'm really sweaty and I'm
throwing like spin kicks and shit like

1675
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:38,841
that,

1676
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,880
I am not in the mood to blow my knee out.

1677
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,720
A lot of wine.

1678
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,730
A lot of my students play the word blame.

1679
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:47,840
The mats when they have a bad day and I'm
sitting there and they're having a bad

1680
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:47,841
day.

1681
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,160
They're like these fucking maps.

1682
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,063
These maps,

1683
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,550
they all get together in the corner.

1684
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:52,811
Yeah.

1685
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:53,301
It's the maps,

1686
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:53,481
right?

1687
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:54,290
Yeah.

1688
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,030
When are we getting new
maps coach or shoes,

1689
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:56,864
bro.

1690
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,730
Guilty too fucking mad brawls.

1691
00:41:58,731 --> 00:41:59,660
He's fucking Matt.

1692
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,250
They'd make fun of the HQ.

1693
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:01,760
Matt.

1694
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,593
That's funny.

1695
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:03,973
I used to,

1696
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,630
but now no more.

1697
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,020
In two weeks I get new mats were everyone.

1698
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,990
I just had um,

1699
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,860
pads put down with a cloth strap,

1700
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,650
a nylon top stretched across a member.

1701
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,750
We've got those dudes to do it.

1702
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,291
Yeah.

1703
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:19,300
Those atoms are switched.

1704
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:20,134
We're done.

1705
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:20,690
Yeah.

1706
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,590
Those can get slippery.

1707
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,430
Super slippery.

1708
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:23,450
It was loose too.

1709
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:23,991
It's like,

1710
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:25,670
the problem with that was it wasn't tight.

1711
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So like remember the old headquarters
for a Gracie Jujitsu in Torrance?

1712
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,720
Yes.

1713
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,280
They had that massive floor.

1714
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:35,583
The green

1715
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,040
tarp tighten up the top.

1716
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,520
That's exactly what I had.

1717
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:41,120
So it was like,

1718
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,740
it's never told so slippery.

1719
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,633
Never tight.

1720
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,260
It's never really tight.

1721
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:46,581
Dude.

1722
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:49,910
Am I crazy to think but baders the
dark horse to win the heavyweight.

1723
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,190
He when it book Bader is still very,

1724
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:54,230
very good and not the king.

1725
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:57,770
Most non king mo can fucking punch and
he at one point in time at least was a

1726
00:42:57,771 --> 00:42:58,790
world class wrestler.

1727
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,130
Chemo was a beast of a wrestler.

1728
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,310
I still is fun.

1729
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:03,590
One of the best I've ever seen.

1730
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,371
But he's,

1731
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:06,470
he's had some injuries
man and he had really,

1732
00:43:06,471 --> 00:43:07,670
really bad staff.

1733
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,210
Yeah,

1734
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,760
I think the staff got them at least twice.

1735
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:11,270
I want to,

1736
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,350
I know he got it once.

1737
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,570
I want to say he got it twice real bad.

1738
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,180
He had a real bad staff like come on man.

1739
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,630
Baders probably at the top of his
game right now is in his prime.

1740
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:21,890
When he beat Phil,

1741
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,251
I was like,

1742
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:22,881
Holy Shit.

1743
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:25,870
He beat Phil Davis and he took
them down a bunch of times.

1744
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:26,210
It's like,

1745
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:26,510
look,

1746
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,860
he's the top of his game.

1747
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,060
He's at the top of his game.

1748
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,560
You look at the heavyweight division,

1749
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,740
the tournament baders my
dark horse man Bader is a,

1750
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,800
he is a legit world class fighter that
is actually probably add is best right

1751
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:39,530
now.

1752
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,320
I would say that Ryan Bader
right now is in his prime.

1753
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,430
Here's the thing though,

1754
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,260
even in his prime,

1755
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,920
he's not at the level of John and that
was over in the UFC and the UFC who is,

1756
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,480
well maybe Danielle's spin,

1757
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,240
I mean DC,

1758
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,360
DC's,

1759
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,470
DC's clothes,

1760
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:57,951
you know,

1761
00:43:57,951 --> 00:44:01,820
DC put up a good fight the first time
and the second time it was a good fight

1762
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:03,410
until John had put up a better fight.

1763
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,520
He did.

1764
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,820
The speculation is a John barely
trying on train for two hours,

1765
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,260
literally show at all.

1766
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,430
That's how good he is.

1767
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:10,850
Correct.

1768
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,740
But when John Fought Ryan,

1769
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:13,131
you were like,

1770
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:13,461
okay,

1771
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:14,540
this is a gap.

1772
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,890
He was able to him like a baby,

1773
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,450
there's a gap that you go,

1774
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:17,840
Ooh,

1775
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,280
how are you going to cross that gap?

1776
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,031
You know what I mean?

1777
00:44:20,031 --> 00:44:21,050
Even if you're a DC,

1778
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,891
you gotta be thinking,

1779
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:22,131
you know,

1780
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:22,821
I love DC.

1781
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:23,610
Even with dcs,

1782
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,081
we thinking,

1783
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:25,130
how can I cross that gap?

1784
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,800
Ice 40 it's true.

1785
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:27,711
He's going to be for,

1786
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:28,460
it's true.

1787
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,080
It's true.

1788
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,700
I look,

1789
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:29,940
oh,

1790
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,220
I'm,

1791
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,320
I can't disagree with you,

1792
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,050
but

1793
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:36,330
DC at least was competitive in that
fight before he got head kicked.

1794
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,440
It was a competitive fight.

1795
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,240
He was putting a lot of pressure on John.

1796
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,320
It was interesting.

1797
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,160
It was interesting.

1798
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,871
This is a good card,

1799
00:44:41,871 --> 00:44:41,941
right?

1800
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:43,020
But John set them up.

1801
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,040
It is a good card.

1802
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:44,610
Ooh,

1803
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,140
Paul daily versus John Fitch.

1804
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,160
Jesus Christ.

1805
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:48,570
That's a good fight,

1806
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:49,404
man.

1807
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,330
Holy Shit.

1808
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,520
Aaron Peko juicy.

1809
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,440
His last winter when that
left hook to the chin,

1810
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,580
it was like a shovel hook.

1811
00:44:56,581 --> 00:44:57,390
Fucking.

1812
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,223
He's a beast.

1813
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,453
He's a beast.

1814
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,380
He's so God damn.

1815
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:01,740
I think losing that first fight,

1816
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,890
it's probably the best thing that
could've ever happened to him.

1817
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,080
He doesn't train with you.

1818
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,710
Does he hear that first fight he did.

1819
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,090
He's a 10th Planet Guy,

1820
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:09,390
right?

1821
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,223
Not Anymore.

1822
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,860
Oh no,

1823
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,530
he was.

1824
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,900
He then after he lost,

1825
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,030
I think they blamed it on the talent.

1826
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:15,331
Dennis,

1827
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:15,690
I was like,

1828
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:16,100
I don't know,

1829
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,850
200 I just never came back.

1830
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,230
Dylan,

1831
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:19,231
Dennis,

1832
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,150
his tattoo is fucking sweet.

1833
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,710
Like whoever did that.

1834
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:24,390
That's like a real artist.

1835
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,100
They nailed that dragon.

1836
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:26,431
Yeah,

1837
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:27,450
it's really good,

1838
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:28,050
man.

1839
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,630
That's like Aaron Dellavedova style.

1840
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,100
Like look how good that dragon is.

1841
00:45:32,101 --> 00:45:37,050
My like what I'm talking about too is
not just the image but the way it's lined

1842
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:37,650
up.

1843
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,170
Like the,

1844
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:38,481
the,

1845
00:45:38,481 --> 00:45:39,960
the use of space.

1846
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,050
Like when you see a
real good tattoo artist,

1847
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,120
one of the things they do is they really,

1848
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:45,690
they,

1849
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,290
they fill up the space the right way
with the right amount of darkness.

1850
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:49,501
Right.

1851
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:50,311
Amount of lightness.

1852
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:51,360
That good contrast.

1853
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:51,690
Yeah.

1854
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:52,980
Body they are of the body.

1855
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,210
It fits perfect.

1856
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:55,440
Sometimes I wish I could go back.

1857
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:56,274
Cause now pet,

1858
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,620
I feel like tattooers are so much better.

1859
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,401
They're so good.

1860
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:00,900
The styles are so much different.

1861
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,130
It just hit like the Prius
of tattoos instead of,

1862
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:04,681
you know,

1863
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,930
it's way better than laser that shit off.

1864
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:07,401
You know?

1865
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:07,761
Fuck that.

1866
00:46:07,761 --> 00:46:08,594
I don't know.

1867
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:09,450
I wouldn't go.

1868
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,290
I'd go with none.

1869
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,100
I'd go with none.

1870
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,630
None.

1871
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:12,120
None.

1872
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,290
I love tattoos man.

1873
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,213
I do too.

1874
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:14,611
I do too.

1875
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:15,690
I feel like I have to cover him.

1876
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:16,500
I believe you.

1877
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,041
I don't know why,

1878
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:17,874
but I do.

1879
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,360
I love that Dylan Dannis style of Tattoo.

1880
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,540
That's a dope tattoo.

1881
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,140
That's my favorite style of those
big ass modern Japanese looking.

1882
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,370
I always cover my man.

1883
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,950
I mean I run if I'm doing stand up,

1884
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,360
I always cover.

1885
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,850
I do for standup ashamed.

1886
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,280
Yeah.

1887
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,250
Probably the only time people see
and when I'm not is on this podcast.

1888
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,293
Honestly,

1889
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,400
if it's one of them,

1890
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:40,771
well no.

1891
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:42,100
Even during my shows I cover him.

1892
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,500
Wayins Wayne's,

1893
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:44,334
I'll wear a tee shirt.

1894
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,620
That's one thing that UFC has been doing.

1895
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:50,220
It's bold cotton making cool t
shirts for each Rebekah maker.

1896
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:52,200
Cool t shirt for each place you go to,

1897
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:53,663
you know.

1898
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,470
Have you been wearing those?

1899
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:55,280
Sometimes they won't.

1900
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,950
Usually more of the pasta on time usually,

1901
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:00,090
but I wore the Boston one.

1902
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:00,491
Boston,

1903
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:04,260
they made a dope one was green like a
bumblebee looked like a bumblebee with

1904
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:05,780
gloves on at the UFC.

1905
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,900
He's like backstage who is like
the head Honcho walking around.

1906
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:13,540
Is there someone above Dana that's walking
around and hanging out backstage or a

1907
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,550
statement that the 12 Dana's
always running the show for sure,

1908
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:18,330
but because they're like,

1909
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:18,901
oh shit,

1910
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:20,160
that's the Golden Snitch,

1911
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:20,670
right?

1912
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,570
Novitsky he's the guy.

1913
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:22,320
Everyone's kind of like,

1914
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,760
well,

1915
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:22,940
no,

1916
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,151
no,

1917
00:47:23,151 --> 00:47:23,271
no.

1918
00:47:23,271 --> 00:47:23,551
He's mean.

1919
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:24,600
He's like running the show.

1920
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:25,770
No,

1921
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:25,921
no,

1922
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:26,040
no.

1923
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,060
Just walking around,

1924
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:27,541
hanging out.

1925
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:28,170
No,

1926
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,890
there's nobody above Dana walking around,

1927
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:30,340
hanging out.

1928
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:30,581
No.

1929
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:31,270
Dean street,

1930
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,260
President's man.

1931
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:35,710
An Ari is so busy that bitch on backstage.

1932
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:35,981
Oh No,

1933
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:36,190
no.

1934
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,660
But when he comes there,

1935
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:40,690
it's very brief and he comes for the
fights or he comes to the weigh ins.

1936
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:41,620
He goes,

1937
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,120
do you out fucking busy.

1938
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:44,050
That dude must be,

1939
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,033
he's in and out.

1940
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,820
You're just still,

1941
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,990
the UFC says side chick.

1942
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:47,680
Yeah.

1943
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,460
Not even.

1944
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,610
He just gets it.

1945
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,090
It's a big company.

1946
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:52,601
It's a,

1947
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:53,680
it's a business.

1948
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:57,070
They put together with a bunch of
celebrities bought into it and you know,

1949
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:58,300
it's a real big deal,

1950
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,433
but

1951
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:03,130
a lot of people bought into it.

1952
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,930
I would have to look at it and athletic.

1953
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,410
A lot of code is part owner of the UFC.

1954
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:09,350
Well,

1955
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:09,790
I don't,

1956
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:10,870
I don't ask questions,

1957
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,440
honestly.

1958
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,840
I really don't ask a lot of quick.

1959
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,260
I also make chair.

1960
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,000
I've been working there forever.

1961
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,130
I ask almost no questions.

1962
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:19,930
This is what I asked.

1963
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,010
What are you gonna do with this guy?

1964
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:21,931
What are you gonna do with it?

1965
00:48:21,931 --> 00:48:23,410
And he wanted to latch
up and he'll be like,

1966
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:24,550
you can't tell anybody this.

1967
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,091
This is where ward.

1968
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:25,451
And I'm like,

1969
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:26,320
Oh shit.

1970
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,483
Oh Shit.

1971
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,080
That's the questions I asked for data.

1972
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:32,470
I never asked questions about
business or who bought this.

1973
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:36,850
Or I don't have enough room in my brain
to give a fuck about other people's

1974
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:37,330
business.

1975
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:41,170
I have zero interest in
the people's business.

1976
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,370
I mean literally zero,

1977
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,750
especially with the UFC.

1978
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,190
I don't give a fuck.

1979
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,660
I just want to know who's fighting,

1980
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,470
who was fighting knew,

1981
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,303
what are you going to do?

1982
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,120
I'm not like,

1983
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,140
how much is this Guy gonna make?

1984
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:51,730
What percentage is he owned and who is he,

1985
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:52,361
what's he doing?

1986
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:53,890
And how's he gonna make us money back?

1987
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:55,190
And what kind of financial returns,

1988
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,170
investments you're going to go,

1989
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,610
I don't give a fuck about you.

1990
00:48:58,611 --> 00:49:00,250
But when they see those
celebrities or owners,

1991
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:01,180
it's just like a business.

1992
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:01,630
But if they don't,

1993
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,890
they might even not be into the UFC.

1994
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:04,090
It's just as far as money,

1995
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:09,100
like estimate people are into getting
famous people to invest in shit too.

1996
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:10,570
It's a fun thing.

1997
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,141
Oh cool.

1998
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:14,140
Jay is that ll cool Jimmy Kimmel?

1999
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,333
I mean it's just,

2000
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,300
there you go.

2001
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,240
There's Mike Dot Trend.

2002
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:18,940
He owns it too.

2003
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,920
They don't have any sense.

2004
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,500
Mike Bell Trout and get the best
fucking mustache in the game at 11.

2005
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:25,540
Owns a piece of the pie.

2006
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,090
How cow about nick knew we'll get a shot.

2007
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:29,471
Anthony Kiedis.

2008
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:30,250
There we go.

2009
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,083
Calvin.

2010
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,400
Dan's a piece of the UFC.

2011
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,140
Damn Damn.

2012
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:36,603
Damn.

2013
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:36,911
Um,

2014
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:39,040
so a lot of people bought into it

2015
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,810
like what the fuck is she
doing in the fight game?

2016
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,070
So what they do is they,

2017
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:45,461
you know,

2018
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:46,061
they probably,

2019
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:47,560
everybody chips in a little bit.

2020
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,070
So strengths give them stock.

2021
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,000
They just give them stock.

2022
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,373
Michael Bay,

2023
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,120
pretty sure he showed that didn't chip in.

2024
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,300
I don't think they chip
it up and get his dog,

2025
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,220
nor will they give them stock
for cause they own the business,

2026
00:50:00,221 --> 00:50:00,910
right?

2027
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,300
They're not.

2028
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,710
Then I can cast from those guys.

2029
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:03,544
I don't think,

2030
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:03,821
well,

2031
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:04,361
what then?

2032
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:05,640
Why would they do that?

2033
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,780
Why would they give him a piece
of the business for no reason?

2034
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,420
They'd have to give them money.

2035
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,111
I don't know.

2036
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:11,261
See,

2037
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:12,470
this is why I don't want them to do this.

2038
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,643
This is why I don't do,

2039
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,970
I don't like doing it.

2040
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:16,883
We're doing

2041
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:19,190
now,

2042
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,510
but what I'm saying is I don't like
wondering who's paying what or how they're

2043
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:24,430
doing and wanting to hear about it.

2044
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:24,811
Now we,

2045
00:50:24,811 --> 00:50:25,644
we'd like it.

2046
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,550
You know what?

2047
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:31,000
That's one of the things I've
found as I've gotten older.

2048
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:36,010
Specialty is to concentrate on
less things like God bless you.

2049
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,121
Other things,

2050
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:38,954
just put them aside,

2051
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,710
put it aside.

2052
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,910
Concentrate on less things.

2053
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,100
You can get better at the
things that you really enjoyed.

2054
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,870
There's only so many
things you could think of.

2055
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,160
There's only so many things.

2056
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,400
If you spend your time worrying
about other people's nonsense,

2057
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,260
you're robbing yourself.

2058
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,370
You think it's fun,

2059
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:54,200
but it's really a big fat distraction.

2060
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:54,980
You know what it is.

2061
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,000
It's not even to your life,

2062
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:56,211
right?

2063
00:50:56,211 --> 00:50:58,460
So you're thinking about things that
are going on in other people's lives and

2064
00:50:58,461 --> 00:51:03,290
you're doing it because you're
not giving 100% to your life,

2065
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,120
and there's some stress involved in that.

2066
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,160
And so distract yourself from that stress.

2067
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:08,480
You concentrate on other people's lives.

2068
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:09,800
It's a very common thing.

2069
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,420
Do you like you can have arguments.

2070
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,980
You have a fake arguments with myself.

2071
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:13,161
Oh,

2072
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:14,030
he used to do that all the time.

2073
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,800
I used to pretend someone
would say this back to me.

2074
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:16,070
I was to be,

2075
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:16,221
well,

2076
00:51:16,221 --> 00:51:16,551
I will.

2077
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:17,384
I fuck you.

2078
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,470
I'm going to say this back to you.

2079
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:24,430
And then sometimes it would be with a
dude and then I would run into him to talk

2080
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:24,771
to him,

2081
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:25,900
thinking we're going to
have this big audience.

2082
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:26,270
I'll say,

2083
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:26,451
man,

2084
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:29,990
I'm sorry I fucked up all this shit.

2085
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,210
And then I abandoned it immediately.

2086
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,060
I think there's so much of how
people interact with each other.

2087
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,680
It could be just way different with just
a little shift in how we talk to each

2088
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:41,140
other and how we think about it.

2089
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:43,410
You did that last night I was
doing to set the laugh factory in,

2090
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:43,770
uh,

2091
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:46,520
we were talking about
Santiago and Theo Vaughn.

2092
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,601
I was going,

2093
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:48,020
you know,

2094
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,840
in between them I had this whole
dialogue in my head cause they were like,

2095
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:51,990
oh we got to stay on what you said,

2096
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,270
that'd be cool.

2097
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:54,590
And as soon as I got done I was like,

2098
00:51:54,591 --> 00:51:54,910
God,

2099
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:59,030
that fucking Santino thought that sucked
and this and I'm like literally go and,

2100
00:51:59,031 --> 00:51:59,721
and you come to the back.

2101
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:00,740
He was a nice guy ever.

2102
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,420
Santina was a very nice guy.

2103
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:04,040
He's fucking destroyed last night.

2104
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:07,790
He's a funny dude because like the
young guys that are coming up that I go,

2105
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:08,990
oh look at you.

2106
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,550
He him him and feel last night,

2107
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:11,630
bat back to back.

2108
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:12,200
I was like,

2109
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,880
you motherfuckers are monsters.

2110
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:14,531
Have you seen his bid?

2111
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:15,470
He does about the rock.

2112
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,510
You've got to ask him to Contino yes.

2113
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,540
Cause he doesn't,

2114
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,180
he's,

2115
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,260
he's has so much material
that he stopped doing it.

2116
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:22,160
I guess he'll do it,

2117
00:52:22,161 --> 00:52:22,994
but if you bring it up,

2118
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:23,903
he'll do it.

2119
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,070
I asked him to do it one night.

2120
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:26,720
He did it for us in the or.

2121
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,583
Dude,

2122
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,390
he,

2123
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:29,223
I don't know who said,

2124
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:29,601
Oh,

2125
00:52:29,601 --> 00:52:30,320
you got to see him.

2126
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,220
He's so,

2127
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,300
he does a lot of my shows.

2128
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,880
Well,

2129
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,753
redhead,

2130
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,440
redhead.

2131
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,273
Okay.

2132
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:37,130
Um,

2133
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,030
he's um,

2134
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,140
he's fucking funny guy.

2135
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:39,861
He's,

2136
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:40,730
I'm doing,

2137
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,980
I think he's on my show
on the 24th in Chicago.

2138
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:45,180
Yeah,

2139
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,360
he's doing that with me in Chicago.

2140
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:48,640
Him and Tony hit him.

2141
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:49,683
His elbow header.

2142
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,290
That's a ridiculous show.

2143
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,280
Him and I walked from laugh factor,

2144
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:56,420
the comedy store last night
and he's a chatty Cathy.

2145
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:58,490
She clearly could talk really good dude.

2146
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:59,660
I'd love that guy.

2147
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,970
I love Santinello and Theo Vaughn,

2148
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:02,721
I love him too.

2149
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,710
He's so original.

2150
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:04,550
Two killers,

2151
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:04,970
man.

2152
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:05,450
So,

2153
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:10,450
so death when they go home last night
and the CEO I was supposed to do as

2154
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:11,241
podcasts,

2155
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:11,631
but it just,

2156
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:12,464
it never,

2157
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,120
I dunno when I connect you guys,

2158
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:14,901
he wanted you on there.

2159
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:15,890
We went back and forth.

2160
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,320
I still want to do it,

2161
00:53:17,321 --> 00:53:17,730
but it just,

2162
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:18,563
it just didn't,

2163
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:19,610
it just didn't help him.

2164
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:20,001
I'll get,

2165
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:21,310
I'll get ahold of the last few weeks.

2166
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:23,420
We've been fucking crazy.

2167
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:24,980
So with your knee operation and all that,

2168
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,030
they have each other's numbers.

2169
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:27,480
Yeah.

2170
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,313
Yeah.

2171
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,371
He's so funny,

2172
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:30,204
man.

2173
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,200
Ask him better too.

2174
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:31,620
How about,

2175
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,210
how about his boy was with him last night.

2176
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,680
I don't think he knows as much about Theo.

2177
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:39,681
Stand up and feels just sucking every
fucking breath out of that place.

2178
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:41,790
Just destroying.

2179
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:42,660
And he goes,

2180
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,021
man,

2181
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:43,830
he's good.

2182
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,300
Like Theo.

2183
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:45,571
He's like,

2184
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:45,721
yeah.

2185
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:46,220
He's like,

2186
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,460
and he's doing really good down there.

2187
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:48,030
I'm like,

2188
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:48,870
yeah man,

2189
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:50,000
he's a fucking killer.

2190
00:53:50,001 --> 00:53:50,131
Well,

2191
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:50,521
you know,

2192
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:51,181
the thing is,

2193
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:54,570
Theo has really come into his
own over the last two years.

2194
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:55,440
Uh,

2195
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,040
and that's,

2196
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,810
I met him right around the time
it was really pop in for him.

2197
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:02,790
He was always really good.

2198
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,770
Like everybody thought
he was always funny,

2199
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,491
but he,

2200
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:07,260
he hit some new level.

2201
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,700
I remember me and Adam,

2202
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,550
the booking agent at the comedy store.

2203
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:11,041
Yeah,

2204
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:16,041
we were in the hallway and Theo
was murdered or ring and w we,

2205
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,180
he got offstage and I went up to Adam.

2206
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:19,500
I go duties on another level.

2207
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,421
He hit some new stride.

2208
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:20,821
He goes,

2209
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:21,001
yeah,

2210
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:21,630
right.

2211
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:26,430
Like we remember like recognizing this
moment where Theo was in some new space.

2212
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,910
He was in some weird like
original space everywhere I go,

2213
00:54:29,911 --> 00:54:31,650
like I was just in Calgary and uh,

2214
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,041
they go,

2215
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:33,120
who else is good out there?

2216
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:36,370
I went have you feel everyone
I give three Oh Vons.

2217
00:54:36,371 --> 00:54:36,961
Like No.

2218
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:38,130
I'm like how do you guys not,

2219
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,360
he should be just shit rolling talent.

2220
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:40,970
You can sales.

2221
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,780
It's one of those things too.

2222
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,560
My God,

2223
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,071

2224
00:54:44,071 --> 00:54:45,450
Not just people are gonna know.

2225
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:48,360
Yeah keep an eye on those two dudes
are like the next Thompson Guerra.

2227
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,420
You guys didn't know Michael Che is.

2228
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:51,930

It's called Michael chain matters dude.

2233
00:54:58,441 --> 00:55:02,400
He's got this Jesus bit where he
talks about how Jesus was a carpenter.

2234
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:04,640
I'm not going to ruin the bib.

2235
00:55:04,641 --> 00:55:05,920
And he's saying he like he,

2236
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:09,600
he must've sucked cause cause if he
would have been good that would have been

2237
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,770
pieces of furniture.

2238
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:11,623
I mean might do is big.

2239
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,690
He's really good.

2240
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,633
He's really good.

2241
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,500
He does the high level high.

2242
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:19,170
Last night just released
a special on Netflix.

2243
00:55:19,171 --> 00:55:20,550
I didn't know you still doing standup.

2244
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,480
Uh,

2245
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,313
James,

2246
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,560
your boy come James.

2247
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:24,821
Yeah.

2248
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:25,040
Yeah,

2249
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:25,621
he just did.

2250
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:26,270
Yeah.

2251
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:26,490
Yeah.

2252
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,480
He's been doing standup.

2253
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:30,000
He does like I know you
used to be on a killers.

2254
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,330
I didn't know that.

2255
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,570
We basically were amateurs together.

2256
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,110
We're basically just starting to get paid.

2257
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:42,290
And I signed with my manager and I got
my manager to sign with Kevin and w like

2258
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:43,290
I have a,

2259
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:47,130
I'm in a small management company and
he has a few clients that have been with

2260
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:49,830
them for more than 20 years and
two of them are me and Kevin.

2261
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:50,521
Is this,

2262
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:51,291
you and Kevin is this,

2263
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:51,431
sorry,

2264
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,530
I'm in Boston or la.

2265
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,520
It was in New York.

2266
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,280
Oh,

2267
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,940
from Boston to New York
because of my manager.

2268
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,120
And then I hooked my manager up with
Kevin and then Kevin and I are pretty

2269
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:03,030
close.

2270
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,151
Yeah,

2271
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:03,691
I know that.

2272
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:05,010
That's what I watched his special,

2273
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,540
cause I think Bryant told me,

2274
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:06,721
he's like,

2275
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:06,901
dude,

2276
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:07,680
he was killed.

2277
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,431
He was a killer.

2278
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:09,870
And I think you told me that too.

2279
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,980
So I've never seen a stamp.

2280
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:11,121
I've,

2281
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:13,650
I've watched it on youtube
but then his special,

2282
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:14,610
it's good with,

2283
00:56:14,611 --> 00:56:15,121
you know what it is,

2284
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:15,331
man.

2285
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:17,610
It's like at this point he's just so busy.

2286
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,121
You know,

2287
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:22,440
he's got his TV show and he's
always doing before Kevin can wait.

2288
00:56:22,441 --> 00:56:24,040
He was always his other TV

2289
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,360
show that went on forever,

2290
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:25,961
you know?

2291
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:26,400
That's,

2292
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,200
and he was like a main guy on that show.

2293
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,580
So no,

2294
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:30,790
no.

2295
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:31,810
I mean as an actor,

2296
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:32,710
I mean as a writer.

2297
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,381
Oh.

2298
00:56:33,381 --> 00:56:34,680
So it wasn't just,

2299
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:35,501
Oh dude.

2300
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:38,770
He wrote everything with those
guys and he's super wrote a lot.

2301
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:39,760
He rewrote a lot.

2302
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:40,840
He went over all the scripts.

2303
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:42,670
And the reason why the show was so good,

2304
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,710
it's because it was a talent
that staff are writers,

2305
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:45,640
talented actress,

2306
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:46,101
Leah Remini.

2307
00:56:46,101 --> 00:56:46,760
He was very funny.

2308
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,460
There was a lot of funny
people on the Shell.

2309
00:56:48,461 --> 00:56:49,840
Patton Oswald was really
going on the show.

2310
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:50,450
He's great.

2311
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:54,820
But more than anything it was
like Kevin is like a driven dude.

2312
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:55,240
Like he,

2313
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,190
he gets super obsessed
about doing the right.

2314
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,041
Like he would,

2315
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,360
he would go over lines
but he eats it like this.

2316
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:01,831
Like he's,

2317
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:02,830
he's a craftsman.

2318
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,360
Like he's trying to break it down.

2319
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,901
You know,

2320
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:08,290
he's trying to figure it out but he just
doesn't do the amount of standup now

2321
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,270
that he used to when he was a start.

2322
00:57:10,271 --> 00:57:11,650
Now how could you can't,

2323
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:12,880
there's no way we could,

2324
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,690
that's why you didn't think that he was
doing it anymore because there's no way

2325
00:57:16,691 --> 00:57:19,630
he could do the kind of standup where
you'd be everywhere all the time.

2326
00:57:19,631 --> 00:57:20,620
He just didn't have that time.

2327
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:20,850
Yeah,

2328
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:21,730
you're doing a sitcom.

2329
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:22,940
It's your sitcoms switched.

2330
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,780
We were writing.

2331
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,491
Fuck Dude,

2332
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:25,450
that's so much work.

2333
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,670
Hey Shannon talked about that too
cause he would write everything,

2334
00:57:27,671 --> 00:57:28,830
overlook every episode.

2335
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,730
Then she can't do both.

2336
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:31,240
Think,

2337
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,370
think about some of the
shit that we've done.

2338
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:37,460
Like that cartoon about you getting
kidnapped by the Mexicans and then we'll

2339
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:39,640
fill you up with drugs and
turn it into a sex slave.

2340
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,510
But Dick's pump that we
didn't write a goddamn thing.

2341
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:43,960
No,

2342
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,880
we were just two friends refund,

2343
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,510
giggling,

2344
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,500
being ridiculous.

2345
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,700
And it turns into a cartoon
and it's fucking hilarious.

2346
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:51,790
Like you watched that cartoon.

2347
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:52,624
It's hilarious.

2348
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,280
We have it so much easier.

2349
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:55,660
If they were doing a sitcom,

2350
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:57,010
we'd had meetings,

2351
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,960
we'd have to do a run
through for the network.

2352
00:57:58,961 --> 00:58:00,700
The network would give a stupid notes.

2353
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,263
We did a,

2354
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:03,250
I know,

2355
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:03,860
and it was insane.

2356
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,540
It was a nightmare.

2357
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,950
Fucking nightmare from day one.

2358
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,030
It's not a nightmare.

2359
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:11,200
I have to deal with a little bit of a
little bit now because my showtime show

2360
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:11,850
and below the belt,

2361
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:13,630
you're shouts at least not scripted.

2362
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:14,680
No.

2363
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,550
See that's the thing.

2364
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:16,390
So with the animal,

2365
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:17,590
when things are scripted,

2366
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,610
it's shit gets weird.

2367
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:18,971
See,

2368
00:58:18,971 --> 00:58:22,030
because what they're doing with
you is very talent dependent.

2369
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,710
They're dependent upon your personality.

2370
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:24,731
That's what people want to see.

2371
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:25,930
The more they let you go,

2372
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:26,920
the better the show is going to be.

2373
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,701
They realize that.

2374
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:28,720
And you see it in the show now,

2375
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:28,911
right?

2376
00:58:28,911 --> 00:58:29,380
Yeah.

2377
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:29,860
But if you're,

2378
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,310
if you're on us a show where
they're creating the dialogue,

2379
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,210
everybody's got to say it was in there
and everybody's got their own little

2380
00:58:37,211 --> 00:58:39,970
fucking opinion about how this should
go and that should go and you don't want

2381
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:43,600
to hear their shit and they think you
suck and everybody's going back and forth

2382
00:58:43,601 --> 00:58:46,330
and then the network comes in and they
don't want to get their greasy pause on

2383
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:46,630
it.

2384
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,760
Everybody wants to get their
fucking just in the soup.

2385
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,580
They all want to get their flavor flavor,

2386
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:53,620
a little bit of flavor.

2387
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,860
Everybody literally wants to
add their DNA to the script.

2388
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:57,011
I've,

2389
00:58:57,011 --> 00:59:01,090
I've seen people try to change
things just to justify their job.

2390
00:59:01,091 --> 00:59:02,290
They have to have an opinion.

2391
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:03,670
Everybody has to have an opinion.

2392
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:05,680
Like I just think she's
not dressed hot enough.

2393
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:06,910
They have these conversations.

2394
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:07,540
We need to,

2395
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,410
we need a black guy,

2396
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,810
we need a black guy and noise.

2397
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:13,330
And then you listening to some executive
that doesn't know shit about writing.

2398
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:14,590
They're not writers.

2399
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:19,510
They just decide they want to have some
sort of say and they think they know the

2400
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:22,310
business because they'd
been working as an executive

2401
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,930
fucking up shows for about five,

2402
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:24,710
six years,

2403
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:27,620
so they've got to experience fucking
up shows so they think they can fuck up

2404
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:28,640
your show and fix it.

2405
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:31,580
It'd be a nightmare to do
all that and do stand up.

2406
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:32,870
We need a gay neighbor.

2407
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,980
We have to advocate and kind of get
a gauge for to me to stay neighbor.

2408
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,471
Big,

2409
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:37,071
silly,

2410
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:37,904
bold.

2411
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,500
Well now it's going to transgender.

2412
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,910
Transgender.

2413
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,380
Have you heard of transracial?

2414
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:43,670
All do.

2415
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,260
Thank God you guys remind me of this.

2416
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:47,270
There's a new podcast,

2417
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:52,460
there's a new documentary on Netflix
about that lady who was white.

2418
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:53,450
Black?

2419
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:53,840
Yes.

2420
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,770
And it is at,

2421
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:55,663
what's it called?

2422
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:56,810
What's it called?

2423
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:57,650
I forget,

2424
00:59:57,651 --> 00:59:58,540
but you watch it.

2425
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:59,190
Poor Lady.

2426
00:59:59,190 --> 00:59:59,300
No,

2427
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,961
you feel bad.

2428
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:02,510
The Rachel Rachel Dozer,

2429
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,220
right to call it the racial divide.

2430
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,230
The Rachel Dolezal is her name.

2431
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:08,660
Dozzle Doughlas though her name now.

2432
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:11,570
She changed her name to like some
soup and she still want to be black.

2433
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,160
Super African sounding names.

2434
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,190
No spoiler alerts.

2435
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:15,381
I mean,

2436
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:16,280
you can look this shit up,

2437
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,660
but they basically like,

2438
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:18,201
she goes on,

2439
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:19,910
she writes a book sales 500 of them.

2440
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:22,940
It goes terrible stress to make money
because the black community doesn't accept

2441
01:00:22,941 --> 01:00:23,050
her.

2442
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,230
The white community doesn't Septa.

2443
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,130
So she writes this book and then at the
end you see her taking her braids out

2444
01:00:28,131 --> 01:00:28,400
and like,

2445
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:28,851
oh damn,

2446
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:30,020
she's going back to white.

2447
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,720
But she doubles down with Conda style.

2448
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,870
Comes out with like an Afro Change.

2449
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,820
A name like fucking what's

2450
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,550
the racial divide?

2451
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,590
What is her a new name?

2452
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,790
It's something crazy.

2453
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,350
Like from the motherland.

2454
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,233
Yes.

2455
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,680
Cherice Gerald Harris
was always super jacked.

2456
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:51,911
He's,

2457
01:00:51,911 --> 01:00:52,744
it looks good.

2458
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,730
It looks like he's a good choice.

2459
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,021
Shit.

2460
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:54,950
There's going to be a great fight,

2461
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:55,330
man.

2462
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:55,810
Yeah.

2463
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:56,810
Carol Harrison,

2464
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:57,710
Rafael Lovato.

2465
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:58,520
There it is.

2466
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,330
The a married Diallo.

2467
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:00,590
Oh,

2468
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,400
that's the chain.

2469
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:01,961
That's syrup soup.

2470
01:01:01,961 --> 01:01:02,620
Campbell.

2471
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:02,810
Yeah.

2472
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:03,560
That's super normal.

2473
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,520
That makes sense for a white girl.

2474
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:05,210
Um,

2475
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:06,760
do you know Gerald Harris does stand up?

2476
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:07,701
Apparently.

2477
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:08,240
It's really fun.

2478
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:08,660
Oh yeah.

2479
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,120
Yeah.

2480
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:09,951
I haven't seen,

2481
01:01:09,951 --> 01:01:13,640
I saw like a very short clip of
him when he was first starting out.

2482
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,533
Oh yeah,

2483
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,620
he's a funny guy.

2484
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,660
Did something that could be
like an eminent comedy tour.

2485
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:19,400
You Gerald Harris.

2486
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:20,560
Yeah.

2487
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,260
Maybe.

2488
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,093
Who else is,

2489
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,900
what else is doing it?

2490
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:24,793
Adam Hunter.

2491
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:25,910
Adam Hunter.

2492
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:26,743
He's like,

2493
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:27,560
no,

2494
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,393
he's a cowboy.

2495
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,070
He was a really good restaurants,

2496
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,430
but he's still in the MMA community.

2497
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:31,571
Yeah,

2498
01:01:31,571 --> 01:01:32,390
he's in the community.

2499
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:32,720
His,

2500
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,490
his show was fucking good man.

2501
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,560
And he's a hilarious comic.

2502
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,000
He's a really good joke writer.

2503
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,560
Like a one liner type dude.

2504
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,670
Very good at that.

2505
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,010
He's a good dude too.

2506
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,260
So that would be him.

2507
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,880
And he wrestled.

2508
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,310
I think he coaches wrestling too.

2509
01:01:48,311 --> 01:01:49,760
It doesn't need to do
some shit with Einstein.

2510
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,440
Einstein,

2511
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,610
I think they to do a podcast together
and then they don't even want to workout

2512
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,510
and then hand out.

2513
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,373
They'll started doing it

2514
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:00,680
and that's what caused the trouble.

2515
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,710
Always caused the trouble.

2516
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,183
I've never met him.

2517
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,760
And that's the is for you,

2518
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,730
I'm sure know.

2519
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:11,564
Ran into him.

2520
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,293
He

2521
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:15,380
brings you up though.

2522
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:17,480
He calls you Brendan Schwabie.

2523
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:18,583
That makes sense.

2524
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:20,280
Your big

2525
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,113
back.

2526
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:21,900
No,

2527
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,733
I've never met him.

2528
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,290
One of the funniest guys to ever live.

2529
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:25,950
It's a funny,

2530
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:26,870
still fuzzy.

2531
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:27,540
Oh,

2532
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,373
have you seen this?

2533
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,870
That hand up on the Rhonda
Show when he does the sketches,

2534
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,153
Robert Deniro,

2535
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,600
he does the heat scatch.

2536
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,990
He's got the rocky three sketch.

2537
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,270
He's got an incredible hulk.

2538
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,350
Sketch the statutes off the chart.

2539
01:02:38,351 --> 01:02:39,184
This is brilliant.

2540
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:42,040
This the one is to take on snow.

2541
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,680
Michael Bisping,

2542
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,450
Michael Bisping and him in a,

2543
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,140
in a fucking parody of snatched

2544
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,670
it is hilarious.

2545
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:52,463
Don't channel.

2546
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,300
He had his own show and eat.

2547
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:55,340
It's a talk show where he brought,

2548
01:02:55,341 --> 01:02:58,110
he's brought it and he's
had a Henner Henner Gracie,

2549
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,003
frank shamrock.

2550
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:00,120
He's the time.

2551
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,900
He's the host,

2552
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,590
but it's not a race.

2553
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:02,430
It's like a podcast,

2554
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:03,264
but at the show.

2555
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,670
And he rushes his guests.

2556
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:07,710
He's the premise of the show.

2557
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,850
If he's better than the guests and he's
going to crush it and he smashes you.

2558
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:15,630
He had frank shamrock on and I asked him,

2559
01:03:15,631 --> 01:03:15,841
I go,

2560
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:16,230
did you,

2561
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,230
did you bring up his snaggletooth not,

2562
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,080
you know,

2563
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,913
and uh,

2564
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,090
and he's,

2565
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,650
he brought it up for 30 minutes.

2566
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:30,660
I love Frank Shamrock,

2567
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:31,771
but he fixed it though.

2568
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:32,371
He's got braces.

2569
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:32,971
I got braces,

2570
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:33,804
my teeth look like

2571
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:36,323
freights braces.

2572
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,000
My teeth were just as bad as frank,

2573
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:42,540
so I had to get braces as
an old man to Invisalign.

2574
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,770
Brian's doing Invisalign.

2575
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:44,760
They're not getting better.

2576
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,280
Brian's had Invisalign
for like four months now.

2577
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:47,701
Check this out.

2578
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:48,121
Took him out.

2579
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:49,020
His teeth are fucked up.

2580
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:49,860
Tell him snatching,

2581
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:50,813
tell him a letter.

2582
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,690
Let it go.

2583
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:51,791
Oh,

2584
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:52,300
here it is.

2585
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,133
Snatching.

2586
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,960
Can we play this on the podcast?

2587
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:56,490
And that's uh,

2588
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:56,920
who's the other?

2589
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,210
Kip.

2590
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,300
Kip Cole.

2591
01:03:58,550 --> 01:03:59,383
Kip.

2592
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:00,773
He's a grappler.

2593
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,340
Dale Kit Dale.

2594
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:06,323
This is great.

2595
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:11,860
Shakes himself.

2596
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,780
When you put them in a range,

2597
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,780
they're like a dog fight.

2598
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,653
I,

2599
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,480
we've lost Vinnie.

2600
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,393
Magallanes.

2601
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,380
Shh.

2602
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,240
You're going to have to repeat that.

2603
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:31,711
He's good,

2604
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:31,981
right?

2605
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:32,880
You need McElfresh.

2606
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:33,961
Well,

2607
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:35,460
where the fuck did you lose him too?

2608
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:39,300
And I as if he's a fucking pair of Khakis
and I asked him if he's not his fights

2609
01:04:39,301 --> 01:04:40,134
going on.

2610
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,890
We'll come back to this long sketch.

2611
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:44,581
That's a long sketch.

2612
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:45,414
We'll come back to it.

2613
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,400
Let's watch like it's 40 minutes long.

2614
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:49,620
This fight on the show is 40 minutes.

2615
01:04:49,621 --> 01:04:51,120
Lavato and Gerald Harris here,

2616
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,770
this shit's going down.

2617
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,050
This is an interesting fight to me.

2618
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:59,370
Lavato was one of the best
Jujitsu guys right now in MMA.

2619
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:03,720
I love Oklahoma money can fuck dudes
upstanding and speaks Portuguese,

2620
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:04,110
right?

2621
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:04,860
Oh,

2622
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,191
crazy.

2623
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:06,024
Flying knee.

2624
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,170
Do you go to the ground with them?

2625
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,940
It's probably not a good idea.

2626
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,620
Let's see what happens here.

2627
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,450
You might get tied it up.

2628
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,130
I thought Joe Retired.

2629
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,440
He did for a bit and I,

2630
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:16,741
but he's back.

2631
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:20,240
This is is coming from the
EOC and then Simon Belt Tours.

2632
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,380
I do not remember.

2633
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,320
[inaudible] has got a
really good guard too,

2634
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:24,000
so he's in here.

2635
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,741
He's in danger,

2636
01:05:24,741 --> 01:05:24,841
right?

2637
01:05:24,841 --> 01:05:25,010
Yeah.

2638
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:26,260
I mean he's got his legs closed.

2639
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:27,580
Don't cheer was playing this game.

2640
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:29,830
This is not a wise move maneuver.

2641
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,360
It's probably going to end right here.

2642
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:31,811
Yeah.

2643
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:33,640
You don't realize what is left.

2644
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:34,091
Elbows out.

2645
01:05:34,091 --> 01:05:34,450
He's good.

2646
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:35,283
He's safe right here.

2647
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:39,960
His legs are tied around the triangle,

2648
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:40,631
man.

2649
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:41,464
If he puts in that,

2650
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,730
if he triangles his legs,

2651
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,900
even with both arms and,

2652
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:44,111
oh,

2653
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:44,944
there it is.

2654
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:45,700
It's over.

2655
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,320
It's done.

2656
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,153
That's done.

2657
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,123
Tapped.

2658
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:48,951
What the fuck was,

2659
01:05:48,951 --> 01:05:49,784
you know what I'm saying?

2660
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:50,830
But they don't know.

2661
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:51,730
They don't know.

2662
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,080
They'll know this guy's level of Jujitsu.

2663
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,120
They have an idea.

2664
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:56,710
They think they can survive.

2665
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:58,023
You can't.

2666
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:59,470
He has knockouts too though.

2667
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,590
Does she was upset.

2668
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,240
It was kind of bummed out that
he didn't get the choke him,

2669
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,980
but he could show that he does.

2670
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,120
He can do that too.

2671
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,000
But the level on the ground is so high.

2672
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,310
When's the last time you saw
this many high level Jujitsu Guy?

2673
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:14,170
Just submit first round,

2674
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:14,680
right?

2675
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:14,980
Boom,

2676
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,400
boom,

2677
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:15,760
boom,

2678
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,300
boom.

2679
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,420
Crazy good on beltway.

2680
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:19,270
Now frank just kept the nine off.

2681
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,201
Jumped to half guard,

2682
01:06:20,201 --> 01:06:20,381
Bro.

2683
01:06:20,381 --> 01:06:21,430
Like a pageant.

2684
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,650
If he snapped faders arm too.

2685
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,580
Shit.

2686
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,970
Think about that friend Sylvia Nogueira.

2687
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:32,050
What if he breaks faders arm and
we'd go get the fuck Outta here.

2688
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:36,400
He has arguably one of the best cars in
the history of the heavyweight division.

2689
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:37,990
Got Night Guards,

2690
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:38,550
right?

2691
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:39,190
Yeah.

2692
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,860
Frank.

2693
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:40,190
Yeah.

2694
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:41,023
Frank journals.

2695
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:42,370
Guard it is.

2696
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,263
It is better.

2697
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:46,630
But Frank's got a wicked fucking
guard man at that beautiful swing.

2698
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,990
Ooh Bam.

2699
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:48,701
He just let him know.

2700
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:50,260
He wraps it up to God.

2701
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:50,651
Damn.

2702
01:06:50,651 --> 01:06:51,311
That was tight.

2703
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:52,144
Can Filthy.

2704
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:52,930
Beautiful.

2705
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:54,490
Do you like the smell and
look at the swim right here.

2706
01:06:54,491 --> 01:06:55,324
Boom.

2707
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,550
Perfect.

2708
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:57,383
Perfect.

2709
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:58,060
Um,

2710
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,080
do you like this way?

2711
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:00,400
I think that all the time,

2712
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,390
that's often arm crush.

2713
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,310
That's how your legs will be often failed.

2714
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:04,330
I'm crushed to the arm bar.

2715
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:05,050
Right.

2716
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:05,883
It's perfect.

2717
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,040
Do you prefer it like that
or do you know for the legs,

2718
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,820
that's when the legs are,

2719
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,100
the legs aren't perfect,

2720
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:20,310
meaning ankles are crossed
over the far elbow or shoulder.

2721
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:21,600
Um,

2722
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,540
that's perfect.

2723
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:22,850
Right.

2724
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:23,240
Dot.

2725
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,850
Sometimes you just can't have it perfect.

2726
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:29,150
So that is if Gerald Harris
would have had a good corkscrew,

2727
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,010
a good hitchhiker,

2728
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,120
he could've got out.

2729
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:31,940
But uh,

2730
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:36,730
you gotta have that and then chamber
ready to go and you got to rep it a couple

2731
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:37,151
thousand times.

2732
01:07:37,151 --> 01:07:39,250
That's a very technical move.

2733
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:42,280
Rembert remember when Carl
prissy and fought Matt Serra?

2734
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,713
Remember that?

2735
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,190
And Carl prison,

2736
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:47,410
one of them almost had an armbar.

2737
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,790
Carl almost had Matt.

2738
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,720
And then Matt hit a perfect
corkscrew hitchhiker out of it.

2739
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,480
So if you have those in
the chamber ready to go,

2740
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:56,560
uh,

2741
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,910
the legs need to be perfect.

2742
01:07:57,930 --> 01:07:58,690
Yeah,

2743
01:07:58,690 --> 01:07:59,570
that's what I was thinking,

2744
01:07:59,571 --> 01:08:04,110
that the left shoulder had more mobility
than it would if you had a cut over.

2745
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:05,590
But it was so tight.

2746
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:06,613
Yeah.

2747
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:07,670
Oh,

2748
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,700
it's interesting how some guys like chew,

2749
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:14,701
they get a certain way of doing it like
that and then they choose that over the

2750
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:15,380
other way.

2751
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,660
They'll just sign it.

2752
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:17,690
Yeah,

2753
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:18,141
right there.

2754
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:18,780
There was no,

2755
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:21,110
if he want to try to get it perfect first,

2756
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,130
he would have lost it.

2757
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:23,750
But you know how some guys do that though.

2758
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:28,130
Some guys will choose like a specific
way to lock up an arm bar or an arm

2759
01:08:28,131 --> 01:08:31,100
triangle and it might not even
be like the most effective,

2760
01:08:31,101 --> 01:08:32,720
but they do it that way so much.

2761
01:08:32,721 --> 01:08:34,070
They get it locked down.

2762
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:37,220
There's so many variations
that you can hit that armbar.

2763
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,083
You know,

2764
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,700
you could hit it belly down on your side,

2765
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,600
on your back.

2766
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,463
You know,

2767
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:45,110
ideally if you're controlling the action,

2768
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,990
you're going to get that arm bar and
you're going to be on your back and he's

2769
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:49,550
going to be on his back and spider web.

2770
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,620
If you're controlling everything but shit,

2771
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:53,750
the guy's a beast and starts moving.

2772
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:58,100
You got to move with them and you gotta
you gotta make sure that you have the

2773
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:03,101
skills to get that arm bar in any
of the positions in the scramble.

2774
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:07,760
Do you remember when people were almost
always doing the rear naked choke with

2775
01:09:07,761 --> 01:09:08,900
the palm on the back of the head?

2776
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:11,840
It was almost always of hiding it.

2777
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:13,480
You're saying instead of
doing the chronic away,

2778
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,510
it was always palm to the back of the
head and then it switched and everybody

2779
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:17,810
was like,

2780
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:18,770
Oh yeah,

2781
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:23,240
that's way better if you can get it in
the gloves and sometimes it's hard to get

2782
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:28,241
the gloves fate or Nick Emelianenko
tracked down by FBI agents at Bella

2783
01:09:28,741 --> 01:09:32,720
[inaudible] 98 what they've been in and
out of his hotel room for the last few

2784
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,500
days apparently to why is the former
owner of Bella tour was Michael Cohen.

2785
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,011
What?

2786
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:40,610
And there might be some Russian collusion.

2787
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:44,250
They're going to find pictures
of him and Trump has this real,

2788
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:45,630
holy shit this,

2789
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,670
we reported it from here.

2790
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:46,911
I mean,

2791
01:09:46,911 --> 01:09:47,730
I'm not digging it.

2792
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:51,230
So your other places had it too.

2793
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:55,070
What if Trump and fit fade or colluding?

2794
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:56,863
That's crazy.

2795
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,700
Boy Or fade or in Putin?

2796
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,220
No Cutler boys.

2797
01:10:00,221 --> 01:10:02,420
You were saying before about Invisalign.

2798
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:03,800
Invisalign does work.

2799
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,600
The thing is no,

2800
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,320
he probably,

2801
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,460
he probably takes him out.

2802
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:10,610
You got to keep him in and once
you take them out for life,

2803
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:11,421
you got at night,

2804
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:12,730
you got to sleep with the routine.

2805
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:14,230
Yeah,

2806
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:14,990
you got to,

2807
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,651
people get lazy.

2808
01:10:15,651 --> 01:10:16,251
I get lazy.

2809
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:17,960
So you're supposed to do it every night.

2810
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:18,500
Um,

2811
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,470
if you go three or four nights
without using the retainer,

2812
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,300
your teeth go back to the eye.

2813
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,100
They used to be shit.

2814
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,910
Just go with the metal
for like three months.

2815
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,190
Even with when you're
done with the metal ones,

2816
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,210
you still need to wear retainers,

2817
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:29,991
your teeth,

2818
01:10:29,991 --> 01:10:30,501
we'll go back.

2819
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:31,251
It's like muscle memory,

2820
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:31,671
your teeth.

2821
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:32,540
We'll go back easily.

2822
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:33,710
So he got to keep wearing a,

2823
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:35,530
Richard got veneers,

2824
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:37,143
my teeth,

2825
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:40,010
my teeth were really fucked up.

2826
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,510
I had some shitty ass teeth.

2827
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:43,190
Would you care to Joe?

2828
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,460
Barely want to get him.

2829
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:50,300
I don't know if my bottom ones are
like a fucking city skyline man.

2830
01:10:50,301 --> 01:10:53,570
I know a girl got him and she was saying
she's an actress and she was saying it

2831
01:10:53,571 --> 01:10:56,420
was really freaky when they
were sawn or teeth down.

2832
01:10:56,421 --> 01:10:58,480
Like she got to look at them
before they put the caps on.

2833
01:10:58,510 --> 01:10:59,343
He's like,

2834
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:01,940
what have you done to
my [inaudible] back now?

2835
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:04,010
Put those caps on

2836
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:06,420
herbs.

2837
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,760
I'm showing to step my game up.

2838
01:11:07,761 --> 01:11:08,240
Man,

2839
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,410
you look great on,

2840
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,330
you don't need so much coffee.

2841
01:11:11,331 --> 01:11:12,620
My teeth looked like corn nuts.

2842
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:14,140
Here's the problem.

2843
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:14,600
Your teeth,

2844
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:14,851
there's,

2845
01:11:14,851 --> 01:11:19,510
there is a problem in trying
too hard a problem with veneers,

2846
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:22,180
like how much are you trying to teach?

2847
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,640
You're trying too hard.

2848
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:25,080
That's not good.

2849
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:26,860
That's not good.

2850
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,220
That's just watch that snatching.

2851
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:29,100
Yeah.

2852
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:29,933
Let's watch that.

2853
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:31,440
The vato son

2854
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,321
so far,

2855
01:11:35,321 --> 01:11:35,800
Jujitsu,

2856
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,410
kicking ass when Bella tours.

2857
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:40,280
What is designed for
tonight is Jujitsu shifts.

2858
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,170
You know strain partners?

2859
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:43,023
A Justin wren.

2860
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:43,860
Yeah.

2861
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,060
Yeah.

2862
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:44,561
They're boys.

2863
01:11:44,561 --> 01:11:45,070
They're close.

2864
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:48,250
Justin went down there to
a tight up his game and he,

2865
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,250
he hit some submissions now he hit
an arm triangle in one of his fights.

2866
01:11:51,251 --> 01:11:52,600
He's the one that's always been his thing.

2867
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,100
I'm trying.

2868
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,220
It's always been Justin's thing.

2869
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,081
He's in Africa.

2870
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:56,320
I know we climbed the tallest mountain.

2871
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,710
Look at the swim saving
kids while I'm gone.

2872
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,260
Belly down that arm.

2873
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:01,951
It's perfect.

2874
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:02,980
It's that wrist locks out.

2875
01:12:02,981 --> 01:12:03,461
Leg over.

2876
01:12:03,461 --> 01:12:04,294
Boom.

2877
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,490
Supernet hips exchange.

2878
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:10,390
We could have went over that course.

2879
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,310
We will want to shut it woulda,

2880
01:12:12,311 --> 01:12:12,611
Shoulda,

2881
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:13,120
coulda.

2882
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,960
But we have run this plenty of room.

2883
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,900
We'll set up another
camera or you know what

2884
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:21,461
testing would be?

2885
01:12:21,461 --> 01:12:23,890
Probably because it's
Jujitsu and you need it.

2886
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,180
You need to get oh angles.

2887
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:28,020
Two guys do the techniques
and the third guy coaches,

2888
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:29,900
coaches it up.

2889
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,530
It follows with that row like a uh,

2890
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,690
a remote camera counts here
when I can any of that done,

2891
01:12:34,691 --> 01:12:36,450
he's just going to be
fucking messing around.

2892
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:36,790
Shit.

2893
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:38,120
What if I do got a blue belt,

2894
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:38,281
right?

2895
01:12:38,281 --> 01:12:39,114
Do this.

2896
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:41,290
Carol does a blue belt and
he wrestled in high school.

2897
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:41,590
Right?

2898
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,390
Does he have a blue belt?

2899
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,223
I don't think so.

2900
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,261
From hands off.

2901
01:12:44,261 --> 01:12:45,094
That's what he says.

2902
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:48,430
You wouldn't lie about a blue belt.

2903
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:50,330
We'd have to ask Enzo.

2904
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,210
Got It.

2905
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:51,650
He got up.

2906
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:52,630
I remember a long time ago.

2907
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,200
He told me that.

2908
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:53,650
Yeah.

2909
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:54,640
I believe he's a blue belt.

2910
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:54,940
Yeah.

2911
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:55,720
Yeah.

2912
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,950
I've seen him roll.

2913
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,100
We used to do a Carlson Gracie's together.

2914
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:01,150
I've seen him around at first.

2915
01:13:01,151 --> 01:13:01,770
Met Him.

2916
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:01,960
No,

2917
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,910
he's definitely both white.

2918
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:03,783
I've seen them row.

2919
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:08,380
Does those little sketches he does
on Instagram with the two phones,

2920
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:10,540
iPad beside his head?

2921
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:10,781
No.

2922
01:13:10,781 --> 01:13:11,530
And uh,

2923
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:13,570
that other comedian Delea oh yeah,

2924
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,930
those guys are fucking hilarious.

2925
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:19,210
We're deleting,

2926
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:19,631
that's his name,

2927
01:13:19,631 --> 01:13:19,820
right?

2928
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:20,653
Yeah.

2929
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,410
That guy is basically uh,

2930
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,020
acting like Brian Callan and Brian.

2931
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:26,381
You know,

2932
01:13:26,381 --> 01:13:28,330
he's like super confident.

2933
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:29,460
Like they did that one bit.

2934
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:31,390
I think this,

2935
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:31,510
yeah,

2936
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,560
I've seen this one is a good one.

2937
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:34,330
Crystal isn't Denver at this is the video.

2938
01:13:34,331 --> 01:13:36,160
He send me other both endeavor right now.

2939
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:36,690
Hi.

2940
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:38,070
Maybe my main man,

2941
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:38,630
my baby.

2942
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:39,010
And My,

2943
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:39,900
a question for you.

2944
01:13:39,901 --> 01:13:41,370
I know you're in Denver.

2945
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:41,641
Well,

2946
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:42,710
the answer is no.

2947
01:13:42,711 --> 01:13:42,991
I mean,

2948
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:43,381
Denver,

2949
01:13:43,381 --> 01:13:44,080
I'm downtown.

2950
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,120
How much shitty folk
phones are like you're a,

2951
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:49,590
I'm so loud.

2952
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:52,840
You're doing shows that he
knows that I'm doing shirt.

2953
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:55,410
If there's anything I can do to
help you out to sell some tickets.

2954
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:58,470
I'm doing a show.

2955
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,043
Two shows.

2956
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:01,013
Okay.

2957
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:02,973
This

2958
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:05,510
is neck,

2959
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,040
teen hundreds,

2960
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,410
so that's more of a fleet.

2961
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,280
Nuclear,

2962
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,113
Cobra,

2963
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:16,420
Cobra.

2964
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,880
I'll punch your cobras face if you

2965
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,690
just are flat and your nose and I'm
going to want to have this coat.

2966
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:25,780
I'm going to turn you into a call,

2967
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:26,561
but you don't have a face.

2968
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:27,460
That's fine as a cobra,

2969
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:28,443
that's what's going to happen.

2970
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:30,400
I'll flattens Cobra face.

2971
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,073
I'll turn it

2972
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:33,960
deleted.

2973
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,340
Kellen,

2974
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,450

That's awesome.

Already on a show.

He is.

2980
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,390
He was the coach on Goldberg,

2981
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:44,221
but he's got his own show.

2982
01:14:44,221 --> 01:14:45,230
He has his own spinoff.

2983

Yeah.

2988
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:53,580
That's awesome man.

Super happy for him.

2991
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:57,970

01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,603
Main event.

2995
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:03,410
Oh,

2996
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:04,420
isn't a hobby.

2997
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:05,030
Yeah.

2998
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:05,821
I mean the man is this.

2999
01:15:05,821 --> 01:15:07,470
The right now should be,

3000
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:09,420
oh shit.

3001
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,633
I kind of went,

3002
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:12,901

3006
01:15:20,061 --> 01:15:22,560
How does the catch,

3007
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:24,780
because they figured man quick.

3008
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:26,130
This is a good card.

3009
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,630
This is a good card.

3010
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:28,650
Like we're entertained.

3011
01:15:28,651 --> 01:15:32,160
It's a bunch of Mitch mismatches
little sure a little bit,

3012
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:33,830
but it's,

3013
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:34,560
it's good miss.

3014
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,320
It's good.

3015
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,031
It's good.

3016
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,440
Entertaining matchmaking.

3017
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:38,303
Jujitsu.

3018
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:41,710
This is a seminar dealing.

3019
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:42,631
Dennis said,

3020
01:15:42,631 --> 01:15:43,500
this is a seminar.

3021
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:47,820
I saw terrible video of this Jujitsu guy
trying to take down this guy with a gun

3022
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:51,270
and the guy shot him and then got off
of him and shot him twice in the head at

3023
01:15:51,271 --> 01:15:51,990
close range.

3024
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,240
I was like,

3025
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,220
why were you watching that?

3026
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:53,941
Exactly.

3027
01:15:53,941 --> 01:15:57,450
Why was I watched it now if
you seen that crazy video,

3028
01:15:57,451 --> 01:15:58,620
the crazy crazy one,

3029
01:15:58,621 --> 01:15:59,310
which was a crazy,

3030
01:15:59,310 --> 01:15:59,770
crazy,

3031
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:00,410
crazy,

3032
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:01,243
crazy,

3033
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,120
crazy,

3034
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:03,481
crazy,

3035
01:16:03,481 --> 01:16:04,261
crazy or crazy,

3036
01:16:04,261 --> 01:16:04,620
crazy,

3037
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:07,110
crazy town cartel killing of a car.

3038
01:16:07,111 --> 01:16:10,350
I can't watch you do watch that on video.

3039
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:11,243
I mean they,

3040
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:12,450
they record on their phone.

3041
01:16:12,451 --> 01:16:16,200
They basically slice the
skin off on a dead person.

3042
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:17,450
There's already a dead person there.

3043
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:17,720
Okay.

3044
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,370
The cop and the slices skin all the way.

3045
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:21,510
They scan them alive,

3046
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:22,470
pull out his heart,

3047
01:16:22,471 --> 01:16:23,304
cut his heart out,

3048
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,810
show it to him,

3049
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:26,700
show it to the camera and worn any,

3050
01:16:26,701 --> 01:16:29,600
but it's fucking dark.

3051
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:30,960
It would really,

3052
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,060
it's ruined my night.

3053
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,330
I'm not interested.

3054
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,790
It's the darkest thing I've ever seen it.

3055
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:40,880
The only thing worse would be watching
that happen to a baby or you went super.

3056
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:41,700
That's it.

3057
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,533
Yeah.

3058
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:43,301
Let's change the site.

3059
01:16:43,301 --> 01:16:44,250
Can't watch that stuff.

3060
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:48,030
It's floating around in the crazy to know
that that's happening somewhere in the

3061
01:16:48,031 --> 01:16:48,864
world.

3062
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:49,510
Right.

3063
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:49,770
You know,

3064
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:50,603
two hours away.

3065
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:50,970
Yeah.

3066
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:54,720
It's right there on the
border of California and
texting because of organized

3067
01:16:54,721 --> 01:16:57,840
crime and that organized crime is they've,

3068
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,640
they're surviving and thriving because
drugs are illegal and they got everyone

3069
01:17:02,641 --> 01:17:02,971
paid off.

3070
01:17:02,971 --> 01:17:05,070
Have you seen that
documentary cartel land?

3071
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:05,761
Yes.

3072
01:17:05,761 --> 01:17:06,400
Jesus.

3073
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,890
Christ's best part of that.

3074
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:08,820
That one guy was like,

3075
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:09,310
cannot.

3076
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:10,070
He's going against

3077
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,590
the cartel then gets his dick
sucked by his mistress and he goes,

3078
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:13,011
boy,

3079
01:17:13,011 --> 01:17:13,850
ain't no boy.

3080
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:14,684
You know?

3081
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:18,171
You know it's funny.

3082
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:20,270
Is it halfway during
through that documentary?

3083
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:23,780
It looks like everyone
being armed as the solution.

3084
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,550
So halfway through the documentary,

3085
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:27,240
I'm already texted people called Shit,

3086
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:27,981
you gotta watch this.

3087
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:29,900
Look what happens when
everyone has machine guns.

3088
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:31,063
But then it uh,

3089
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:31,810
it,

3090
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:33,260
it slowly go south.

3091
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:34,670
Have you seen it Joe?

3092
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:35,030
No.

3093
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,930
Like the main star.

3094
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:36,773
I haven't seen it.

3095
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:37,460
No.

3096
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,300
The main star of it.

3097
01:17:38,301 --> 01:17:42,440
He's like fighting back against the cartel
and he's married and he forgets he's

3098
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:45,500
miked up and sees his
mistress and there's subutex.

3099
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,490
He's getting his Dick Second.

3100
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:47,630
You see the subjects?

3101
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:48,471
Bueno.

3102
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:49,304
Boy.

3103
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:52,483
Everyone good.

3104
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,473
Let's do it.

3105
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:55,183
Yeah,

3106
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,120
that's hilarious.

3107
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:56,810
Hero.

3108
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,140
And he had a lot of groupies
and he took and you know,

3109
01:17:59,150 --> 01:17:59,540
he forgot.

3110
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,770
He forgot they were filming.

3111
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:03,710
It was Mike and he had a lot
of group laid the law down.

3112
01:18:03,711 --> 01:18:04,490
Sorry.

3113
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:05,330
Jump on them.

3114
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:08,700
I need to see that.

3115
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,200
I was telling you about,

3116
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:10,700
uh,

3117
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:15,700
American made the seals movie with Tom
Cruise and other bad ass Tom cruise

3118
01:18:16,051 --> 01:18:16,380
movie.

3119
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,213
Oh yeah.

3120
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,450
See he's on the airplanes.

3121
01:18:18,451 --> 01:18:19,470
He was just jumping around.

3122
01:18:19,471 --> 01:18:19,780
Yeah,

3123
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:20,040
do.

3124
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:20,730
It's good.

3125
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:21,470
It's really good on me.

3126
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:22,400
It's a good me.

3127
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:22,981
They look,

3128
01:18:22,981 --> 01:18:26,490
I know a lot of the Barry seal
story and they covered a lot of,

3129
01:18:26,491 --> 01:18:28,830
you can only cover so much
of it in a 90 minute movie.

3130
01:18:28,831 --> 01:18:29,664
But yeah,

3131
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:29,971
look,

3132
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,100
I mean they did not pull any punches.

3133
01:18:32,101 --> 01:18:34,350
They made look like Bill
Clinton got him off.

3134
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:35,790
Bill Clinton called the prosecutor.

3135
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:38,700
They caught him with millions of
dollars and cocaine and money.

3136
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:40,720
Phone call.

3137
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,250
Nope.

3138
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:41,610
Nope.

3139
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:43,650
They have her on the
phone with Bill Clinton.

3140
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:44,401
Bill Clinton,

3141
01:18:44,401 --> 01:18:45,020
who like,

3142
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,250
he's telling her I'm going to walk.

3143
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:48,150
Whether or not he said that,

3144
01:18:48,151 --> 01:18:49,110
I don't know cause he's dead.

3145
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:49,741
No one knows.

3146
01:18:49,741 --> 01:18:50,490
Right.

3147
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:51,840
And he's telling her it was,

3148
01:18:51,841 --> 01:18:52,321
trust me,

3149
01:18:52,321 --> 01:18:53,340
I'm going to walk right out of here.

3150
01:18:53,341 --> 01:18:54,540
And they're all laughing and she's like,

3151
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:55,440
you're not going to walk anyway.

3152
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:56,483
And they're like,

3153
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:57,810
Mrs Prosecutor,

3154
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,360
Bill Clinton's on the phone
and it's governor Clinton.

3155
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:01,050
Yes.

3156
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:01,231
Yeah.

3157
01:19:01,231 --> 01:19:02,064
And you see her go,

3158
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:02,970
you see her,

3159
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:03,930
just get pissed off.

3160
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:04,501
The next thing you know,

3161
01:19:04,501 --> 01:19:06,270
they're uncuffing him and he's leaving.

3162
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,630
So they're letting you
know that Bill Clinton.

3163
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:10,740
And if they,

3164
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:14,650
if the only way you could put that
in a movie is there has to be truth,

3165
01:19:14,651 --> 01:19:14,820
right?

3166
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:16,710
Some truth to him,

3167
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,011
they're like,

3168
01:19:17,011 --> 01:19:20,160
there's gotta be some sort of a
documented record of him making that call.

3169
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:20,820
Right.

3170
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:21,960
He made that call.

3171
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,730
He had to have made that call.

3172
01:19:23,731 --> 01:19:25,200
You couldn't switch defamation,

3173
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:28,530
which of course Clinton
and he is the governor.

3174
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:31,140
So there's probably a
record of him saying,

3175
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:32,340
let that guy go.

3176
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:37,050
And so the reason they think
is because in the film,

3177
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,320
this is what they're saying is that he
was tied in with the CIA and somehow or

3178
01:19:40,321 --> 01:19:44,430
another through the CIA using him for
reconnaissance photos and stuff like that.

3179
01:19:44,431 --> 01:19:47,370
And they eventually got hooked up these
drug dealers and started selling drugs.

3180
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:51,270
The CIA was in on it and
they were allowing him to do
it and he was getting them

3181
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,620
photographs and Intel from all
these different drug places.

3182
01:19:55,621 --> 01:19:59,040
And in return they were letting him do
whatever he did and taking a piece of it

3183
01:19:59,041 --> 01:19:59,430
problems,

3184
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:00,870
which you mentioned Mena Arkansas.

3185
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:01,440
Yeah,

3186
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:01,681
yeah.

3187
01:20:01,681 --> 01:20:02,341
They mentioned all the,

3188
01:20:02,341 --> 01:20:02,641
all the,

3189
01:20:02,641 --> 01:20:04,740
I mean that's where Bill Clinton
was the governor of nature.

3190
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,780
The only found out about all
this stuff cause two kids were,

3191
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:12,690
they were murdered and they told the
parents that the kids had gotten high and

3192
01:20:12,691 --> 01:20:14,370
fell asleep on the train tracks.

3193
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:18,220
But the parents did an independent
autopsy and found stab wounds in the kids.

3194
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,141
So like,

3195
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:19,831
oh Jesus,

3196
01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:20,940
what the fuck happened here?

3197
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,790
And then slowly but surely
the whole thing unravels.

3198
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,920
They witnessed a drug drop.

3199
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:26,400
Yeah.

3200
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,330
And uh,

3201
01:20:27,331 --> 01:20:29,400
well they couldn't have any witnesses,

3202
01:20:29,401 --> 01:20:30,234
dude.

3203
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,450
They made me like it
was lit case who killed,

3204
01:20:33,451 --> 01:20:36,240
go to youtube and just punch in a CIA,

3205
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:36,870
Mena,

3206
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:37,560
Arkansas,

3207
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,900
cocaine blow and you get the host.

3208
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:40,734
It's a sitter.

3209
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:41,933
So he kills those.

3210
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:43,140
It could be a two kids.

3211
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:44,580
We don't know.

3212
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,290
We don't know somebody who was in our,

3213
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:47,420
assume the cin.

3214
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:51,420
The kids must have seen the drugs be
dropped and whoever was selling the drugs,

3215
01:20:51,421 --> 01:20:52,081
moving the drugs,

3216
01:20:52,081 --> 01:20:54,750
they just decided to kill these kids
cause they couldn't take a chance.

3217
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:55,890
The kids keeping their mouth shut.

3218
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,083
So they killed them.

3219
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,770
And apparently that was just one thing.

3220
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:00,870
Now in the movie,

3221
01:21:00,871 --> 01:21:02,760
the way they haven't made up is like that.

3222
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:05,880
That was just one thing that's sort
of straw that broke the camel's back.

3223
01:21:05,881 --> 01:21:06,601
They don't even have that.

3224
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:08,520
And I don't even remember if
they had that in the movie.

3225
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:09,301
The kids,

3226
01:21:09,301 --> 01:21:10,140
did they have that in the movie?

3227
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:10,471
The murder?

3228
01:21:10,471 --> 01:21:11,460
They didn't have the murder of the kids.

3229
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:12,294
No they didn't.

3230
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:14,580
But what they did have
is these people were,

3231
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,590
I mean everybody was rich.

3232
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:19,560
There were all coming in and
buying things and everyone's like,

3233
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:21,300
where the fuck is all
this money coming from?

3234
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,193
Who was rich?

3235
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:23,490
The people that we're working with,

3236
01:21:23,491 --> 01:21:25,780
Barry seal's like his brother-in-law,

3237
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:27,820
like his wife's brother apparently.

3238
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:28,890
I don't know if that was a real person,

3239
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,461
but in the,

3240
01:21:29,461 --> 01:21:30,450
in the movie he's,

3241
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,820
he's balling out of control and he's a,

3242
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:36,420
he's got some fucking ridiculous souped
up car and he's got money coming out of

3243
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:39,180
his pockets and he stuffed in his
pocket and he gets caught by a cop.

3244
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,201
You know,

3245
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:42,150
and I dunno if that happened in real life,

3246
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:45,180
but in the movie they made it
seem like everybody was just,

3247
01:21:45,181 --> 01:21:46,710
there was so much money flowing around,

3248
01:21:46,711 --> 01:21:47,670
it didn't make any sense.

3249
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,680
They were burying it in his backyard.

3250
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:49,800
They,

3251
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,760
when they busted him,

3252
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,470
it was like in the movie.

3253
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:53,311
Now again,

3254
01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:56,820
I don't know if this was real because
you know what fucked me up man.

3255
01:21:56,821 --> 01:22:00,420
That Mark Schultz movie [inaudible] yes,

3256
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:05,600
because I know Mark Schultz fought one
time in the UFC because I watched it.

3257
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,370
He fought big daddy Goodrich.

3258
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:11,690
He took big daddy Goodrich down and beat
the shit out and they didn't use good.

3259
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:12,511
No,

3260
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:12,851
not all.

3261
01:22:12,851 --> 01:22:13,160
I'm saying.

3262
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:13,900
Dot.

3263
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,210
Pick daddy and then movies.

3264
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:21,520
Some random guys fighting a white
guy also the also Schultes hadn't,

3265
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:24,120
there's no gay relationship there.

3266
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:24,781
That's the other one.

3267
01:22:24,781 --> 01:22:25,250
He's like,

3268
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:26,300
look man,

3269
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:29,780
the bleached his hair and made him look
like he was and I can't coach culture

3270
01:22:29,781 --> 01:22:31,950
like that was weird man.

3271
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:32,641
Weird man.

3272
01:22:32,641 --> 01:22:36,330
That Hollywood Shit Schulz told me
that that movie is full of Shit.

3273
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:36,560
Well,

3274
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:36,830
it's,

3275
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:40,830
it's a super set of a shit because he
doesn't fight Gary Goodrich at the end.

3276
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:42,750
Why would you change history?

3277
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:46,050
Like this is what we're
talking about in the soup.

3278
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:47,490
No fucking way.

3279
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:48,780
No fucking way.

3280
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:52,110
Check cause I can't trust anything.

3281
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,110
I can't trust anything in a movie
like Hollywood doesn't know.

3282
01:22:55,111 --> 01:22:55,944
Find me.

3283
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:56,850
The movie was great.

3284
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:59,280
Steve Carell's could ask
[inaudible] amazing as a nose on.

3285
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:00,300
He's amazing.

3286
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,390
But I know what really happened.

3287
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,500
I know that he fought big daddy Goodrich.

3288
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:07,880
Why isn't he fighting big Daddy
Gorge in your fucking movie?

3289
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:08,870
We'll over the next it.

3290
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:12,310
You can't overlook that she fought once.

3291
01:23:12,311 --> 01:23:13,270
It's a part of the move.

3292
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:14,030
I hear you man.

3293
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:14,150
It's,

3294
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:14,983
it's a very,

3295
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:16,990
it's really easy.

3296
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:17,980
Just get a black guy.

3297
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:18,843
So what?

3298
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,000
Sign off on his likeness
or it doesn't have to,

3299
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,590
he doesn't have to its history.

3300
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,790
There's a reality to it.

3301
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,440
You don't have to have him say his name.

3302
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:28,720
You show big daddy
Goodrich across from them.

3303
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:29,740
You show him,

3304
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:31,890
you know you have mark Scholz,

3305
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:35,350
you'd just cut into it right when they're
introducing and have a black and then

3306
01:23:35,351 --> 01:23:37,280
have the guy and you know
have them where the Geeky,

3307
01:23:37,281 --> 01:23:39,000
just like big daddy Goodrich had a key on.

3308
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:40,370
It's kind of navigate through.

3309
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,411
This is stupid.

3310
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:42,610
You can't change history.

3311
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,800
This is a real historical moment.

3312
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:49,750
It was a moment when one of the best
wrestlers on the fucking planet earth,

3313
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:50,681
a legit,

3314
01:23:50,681 --> 01:23:55,510
super high level Olympian fought in the
UFC and he only fought once and you got

3315
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:59,410
to see how easy he took an elite MMA
fighter down and just dominated him.

3316
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,170
That was an important
historical moment in MMA.

3317
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:02,570
That's right.

3318
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:02,891
Range.

3319
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:05,860
They miss the changing who
breaks Jackie Robinson's record,

3320
01:24:05,861 --> 01:24:07,990
a Babe Ruth's record or or Mickey Mantle.

3321
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,820
You changing his,

3322
01:24:09,821 --> 01:24:11,980
you could never do that with
baseball and nobody would let you.

3323
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:15,250
You don't think that because those are
major sports in a lot of people would

3324
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:16,540
know that with MMA there's like,

3325
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:16,731
yeah,

3326
01:24:16,731 --> 01:24:17,564
whatever man.

3327
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:19,360
They might have done that,

3328
01:24:19,361 --> 01:24:22,330
but that makes me not trust
everything else in the movie.

3329
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,030
Because if you did that
with a very important point,

3330
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,410
let's a very important point,

3331
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:27,190
because people to go,

3332
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:31,630
which is a legend that the Paul Herrera
knockout and Paul Herrera had him like a

3333
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:35,650
fireman's carry and he hit him with all
those LDLs and that's probably the most

3334
01:24:35,651 --> 01:24:40,130
brutal Kale and so history kind of them.

3335
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:41,111
It's certainly,

3336
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:42,250
certainly one of them.

3337
01:24:42,251 --> 01:24:43,600
I mean that was a terrifying,

3338
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:44,660
terrifying Kao.

3339
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,660
How easy is that for them to fix too?

3340
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:50,710
If you just put some sort of reference
to Gary Goodrich to big daddy Goodrich,

3341
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:52,900
he had kicked on fry,

3342
01:24:52,901 --> 01:24:54,370
remember that he's a monster.

3343
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:55,710
Kicked him and Kayo them.

3344
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:56,591
You know,

3345
01:24:56,591 --> 01:25:00,520
big daddy Goodrich's an important
historical figure in MMA.

3346
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:03,280
You can't just change the name of the guy.

3347
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:05,440
Mark Schultz fights can movie though.

3348
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,513
I lost,

3349
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,820
I lost faith in a,

3350
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:11,230
based on a true story movies
when the Dragon came out,

3351
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,370
the Bruce Bruce Lee movie,

3352
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,470
but Jason Scotland,

3353
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:13,990
he did a,

3354
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:14,380
he was,

3355
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:18,850
he played Bruce Lee and I love
so much bullshit in there.

3356
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,080
Oh my God.

3357
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:24,670
I love filled with
bullshit it in the movie,

3358
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:25,721
in the movie,

3359
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:29,470
he had a real fight at
the long beach arena.

3360
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:30,490
He was just,

3361
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:31,031
in reality,

3362
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:32,320
he was just doing demonstrations,

3363
01:25:32,321 --> 01:25:33,220
but in the movie they had him.

3364
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:34,660
He didn't have a real fight though.

3365
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:36,080
He didn't have a real fight there.

3366
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:39,250
And then a movie it during the fight,

3367
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,270
his opponent,

3368
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:40,660
bro,

3369
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:44,980
like broke his back with a
sidekick in the movie he was in.

3370
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:47,080
The hospital's heartbreaking in reality.

3371
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:47,861
Fucked his backup.

3372
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:48,310
Lifting,

3373
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,143
lifting weights.

3374
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:52,390
He was lifting weights
is back in that fight.

3375
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:53,000
No,

3376
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,600
he never had to redeem
himself mostly to death.

3377
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:57,490
But he never had a professional fight.

3378
01:25:57,491 --> 01:25:58,060
Ever,

3379
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:58,391
ever.

3380
01:25:58,391 --> 01:25:58,620
Right.

3381
01:25:58,620 --> 01:25:58,841
Never.

3382
01:25:58,841 --> 01:25:59,650
Not One fight.

3383
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:00,483
Never.

3384
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:00,941
No.

3385
01:26:00,941 --> 01:26:02,290
I don't think he ever competed.

3386
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:04,100
I don't think he had an amateur

3387
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,560
fight.

3388
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,590
He fought like he had on the streets,

3389
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:08,451
on the streets,

3390
01:26:08,451 --> 01:26:13,451
and he fought in the YMC Aa for the
right to teach Non-asians Kung Fu in San

3391
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:14,811
Francisco.

3392
01:26:14,811 --> 01:26:15,840
That'd be a flower was a thing.

3393
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:16,140
Yeah.

3394
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:16,980
That he had real fights,

3395
01:26:16,981 --> 01:26:17,721
that he was a real fighter,

3396
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:19,670
but he didn't have a
real professional fight.

3397
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:21,200
He didn't have anything like that.

3398
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:23,210
He broke his back lifting weights.

3399
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,010
Not in a professional fights.

3400
01:26:25,011 --> 01:26:25,844
Was He lifted?

3401
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:27,651
When I saw that,

3402
01:26:27,651 --> 01:26:28,221
I thought okay,

3403
01:26:28,221 --> 01:26:31,560
I can't trust any Hollywood movies now
based on a true story and gains because

3404
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:32,394
it's a little bit,

3405
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:33,291
they got,

3406
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,390
they got a paint a narrative a little bit.

3407
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:36,403
No,

3408
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,190
no.

3409
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:38,023
Well no you can't.

3410
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:39,050
No,

3411
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:39,201
no,

3412
01:26:39,201 --> 01:26:39,400
no,

3413
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:39,541
no.

3414
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:40,220
Now it's,

3415
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:42,350
now it's inspired by true events.

3416
01:26:42,351 --> 01:26:42,791
Files.

3417
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:42,920
Yeah,

3418
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,671
I dig that Shit.

3419
01:26:43,671 --> 01:26:44,960
Can't entertain stuff.

3420
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:45,980
You can't add stuff.

3421
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:47,430
You can't add a gay relationship.

3422
01:26:47,431 --> 01:26:49,280
You can't add a karate kick to the back.

3423
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:50,250
That fucks you up.

3424
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:50,961
Puts in the hospital.

3425
01:26:50,961 --> 01:26:51,740
You can't add that.

3426
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,391
Oh in,

3427
01:26:52,391 --> 01:26:52,670
in the,

3428
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:53,030
in the,

3429
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:55,070
in reality he had to fight,

3430
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:55,730
uh,

3431
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:56,031
if he,

3432
01:26:56,031 --> 01:26:58,010
if he beat this guy out of y Ymca,

3433
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:01,700
he had the right to teach non agents
cause that was an issue back then.

3434
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:02,653
It was the 60s.

3435
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:03,420
Yeah.

3436
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:06,380
They're like why are you
teaching in Americans are shit.

3437
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:07,191
And he's like,

3438
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:08,480
I'll teach anybody who the fuck I want.

3439
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:12,050
So he had to fight and went to
wine at a YMCAs in the movie.

3440
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:13,011
In the movie.

3441
01:27:13,011 --> 01:27:17,840
It was in an underground cavern with like
elders and these little spots and the

3442
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:19,250
scratchy did these,

3443
01:27:19,251 --> 01:27:23,510
did he scratch his chest and then the
guy put this back up again as he kicks

3444
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:23,780
him?

3445
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:24,141
Yes,

3446
01:27:24,141 --> 01:27:27,230
but it's like it was in
a weird like Illuminati.

3447
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,580
I love that part though.

3448
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:29,990
I hate when they do that.

3449
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:30,201
Yeah,

3450
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:31,034
it was all bullshit.

3451
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:33,053
It was a great room.

3452
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:36,020
Can't do that about a
real watch of documentary.

3453
01:27:36,021 --> 01:27:36,760
You fuck.

3454
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,680
That's like when Abraham
Lincoln fought the vampires.

3455
01:27:39,681 --> 01:27:41,990
It was obvious it wasn't
really that good ass movie.

3456
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:46,190
That's a good movie though.

3457
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,190
What if that was real?

3458
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:50,570
Hey,

3459
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:51,260
we don't know.

3460
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,330
Maybe he killed them all and that's
why we could sleep good at night.

3461
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,770
That movie is so underrated.

3462
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:57,560
We do know a lot of people out
there are drinking baby blood.

3463
01:27:57,561 --> 01:28:01,460
Maybe after a while you turn in like to
into like little like a vampire or kind

3464
01:28:01,461 --> 01:28:02,300
of person.

3465
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:03,740
You imagine if vampires or something.

3466
01:28:03,741 --> 01:28:04,790
You really had to worry about.

3467
01:28:04,791 --> 01:28:06,290
Oh my God.

3468
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,330
Might be out there.

3469
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,810
We're so funny.

3470
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:13,220
Imagine if there was dudes out there
sucking people's blood and a bunch of

3471
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:14,800
people found with like the,

3472
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:17,390
their juggler veins
tapped into by those two,

3473
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:18,530
two prongs to,

3474
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:22,210
isn't it weird that it's kind of romantic
like chicks think pedantics things

3475
01:28:22,211 --> 01:28:25,070
that you buy at a girl's new blood,

3476
01:28:25,071 --> 01:28:25,570
but you could.

3477
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:26,410
Why Two?

3478
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:29,450
Because it's the guy loves you so much.

3479
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:30,380
You're willing,

3480
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:31,640
you love him so much.

3481
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:36,790
You willing to be the undead and you'll
go for attorney like the best one ever

3482
01:28:36,891 --> 01:28:38,690
by far.

3483
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,660
Twilight Gary Oldman and Wynona Ryder,

3484
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,640
Bram Stoker's Dracula.

3485
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,790
Fuck shit is so Ben tasks.

3486
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:51,290
I made a music video interview with the
vampire is fucking good to very good,

3487
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:53,380
but it's a different
hat and put top girls.

3488
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,290
Yeah,

3489
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:54,621
Dude.

3490
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:55,371
Tom Cruise killed it.

3491
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:59,280
And that two killed in that to look
good in that with that little girl.

3492
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,830
That little girl was fucked up.

3493
01:29:01,831 --> 01:29:02,150
What's

3494
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:02,911
that little girl's,

3495
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:03,600
uh,

3496
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,560
Kristen Dunst.

3497
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:05,180
Yes.

3498
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,630
She's amazing.

3499
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:08,340
She's amazing in that movie.

3500
01:29:08,341 --> 01:29:12,180
She's fucking fantastic and she's like
10 and she's killing it as a little bit

3501
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:15,000
back a little bit to them was
terrifying too because you believe it.

3502
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:15,630
I know.

3503
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:18,630
And she would like dress those people
up after they were dead and people were

3504
01:29:18,631 --> 01:29:18,711
like,

3505
01:29:18,711 --> 01:29:19,830
what the fuck you killed them.

3506
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:22,790
And even top crews like you gotta
chill out cause she was killing it.

3507
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,030
Couldn't help but she could kill him.

3508
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:24,873
See that now?

3509
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:25,531
Fuck yeah.

3510
01:29:25,531 --> 01:29:27,000
I want to smell other large pizza.

3511
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:27,900
I'd watch that.

3512
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:30,000
She might've been the
scariest vampire ever.

3513
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:31,343
That little girl,

3514
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:32,431
she's up there.

3515
01:29:32,431 --> 01:29:32,880
Right?

3516
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,960
Cause she's so fucking cute and so vicious
because she was like 300 years old,

3517
01:29:36,961 --> 01:29:37,770
but she was 10.

3518
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:41,640
You know who's not a bad vampire is
calling Farrell in a neither living dead.

3519
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:42,480
Not Bad at all.

3520
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,050
Not Bad.

3521
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:43,560
Not Bad.

3522
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,760
It's not night of the living dead.

3523
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:45,953
It's um,

3524
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,040
I know what you're talking about.

3525
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:47,910
It's the newest one.

3526
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:48,850
The yeah,

3527
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:49,531
the kid who died,

3528
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:50,430
what is it called?

3529
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:51,601
The fuck is it called?

3530
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:52,051
It's not night.

3531
01:29:52,051 --> 01:29:52,920
And I live in dead.

3532
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:53,880
I don't think so.

3533
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:55,680
No,

3534
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,210
it's like from dusk till dawn.

3535
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:58,320
Now that was good.

3536
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:00,630
Do Friday night.

3537
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:01,231
That's it.

3538
01:30:01,231 --> 01:30:01,711
That's it.

3539
01:30:01,711 --> 01:30:02,544
Fright night.

3540
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:03,180
Um,

3541
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:04,013
dusk till dawn.

3542
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:04,310
Good.

3543
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:07,110
[inaudible] our movies have there been,

3544
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:08,280
I watch them all.

3545
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:10,780
I really want to push those things.

3546
01:30:10,781 --> 01:30:11,614
I love them.

3547
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,870
Jesus Christ.

3548
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:14,340
Why light ones the most with them?

3549
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,870
They could live in the Seattle area
because it never was sunny shit.

3550
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,270
They had the makeup on fucking,

3551
01:30:21,271 --> 01:30:24,870
they don't burn when the sun hits
them and that was an empire movie,

3552
01:30:24,871 --> 01:30:25,150
right?

3553
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:26,130
Blades a fucking good.

3554
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:28,140
That's a good no call
pharaoh was a beast in that.

3555
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:30,830
That's a good movie or a vampire movie.

3556
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:31,800
Movies and space.

3557
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:32,530
Louise.

3558
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:32,960
No,

3559
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:33,800
no,

3560
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:34,171
no,

3561
01:30:34,171 --> 01:30:35,004
no.

3562
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:35,820
I think,

3563
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:37,050
I think there are no,

3564
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:40,530
no star wars aliens.

3565
01:30:40,531 --> 01:30:41,730
Star track.

3566
01:30:41,731 --> 01:30:44,790
You can just keep going on event
horizon been going on and on.

3567
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:46,403
Green home,

3568
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,373
boy.

3569
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:50,971
Hey,

3570
01:30:50,971 --> 01:30:53,010
if you guys seen lost in space on Netflix,

3571
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,060
if you heard anything about it.

3572
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:54,331
No.

3573
01:30:54,331 --> 01:30:55,500
And he didn't hear anything about that.

3574
01:30:55,501 --> 01:30:57,450
Jamie Lawson space
supposed to be any good.

3575
01:30:57,710 --> 01:30:58,171
I look good.

3576
01:30:58,171 --> 01:30:59,380
I didn't hear good reviews so,

3577
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,273
oh,

3578
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:01,410
I know they did it.

3579
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:05,130
They got a new show they're doing with
that chick from Battlestar Galactica.

3580
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:06,630
Katie,

3581
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:08,160
how do you see her name's sack off?

3582
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,440
She's bad ass nasty.

3583
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:11,670
Ever see Battlestar Galactica.

3584
01:31:11,671 --> 01:31:16,290
The PSI five version wasn't Battlestar
Galactica with old school John Travolta,

3585
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:17,460
the worst movie of all time.

3586
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:18,020
No,

3587
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:18,320
no.

3588
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,800
Got Battlefield Earth.

3589
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:20,340
There you go.

3590
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:20,521
Yeah,

3591
01:31:20,521 --> 01:31:20,761
you're,

3592
01:31:20,761 --> 01:31:21,594
you're fucking,

3593
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:27,720
Trump gave NASA a whole
shit load of money,

3594
01:31:27,721 --> 01:31:29,190
like $19 billion and said,

3595
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:29,881
okay,

3596
01:31:29,881 --> 01:31:30,421
here's the money,

3597
01:31:30,421 --> 01:31:31,590
but we're going to fucking know.

3598
01:31:31,591 --> 01:31:32,371
Let's go to the moon.

3599
01:31:32,371 --> 01:31:32,880
So they,

3600
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:37,140
they started a campaign to go to the
moon and they just canceled the mission.

3601
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:37,481
Why?

3602
01:31:37,481 --> 01:31:37,681
Oh No,

3603
01:31:37,681 --> 01:31:37,831
no,

3604
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:37,981
no.

3605
01:31:37,981 --> 01:31:38,910
They didn't cancel the mission.

3606
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:40,170
They canceled the Moon Rover.

3607
01:31:40,610 --> 01:31:41,460
You canceled it.

3608
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:43,350
They canceled the,

3609
01:31:43,351 --> 01:31:45,630
the construction of the moon
and everybody's confused.

3610
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,690
They don't know how they did that because
this is like the last moon rover that

3611
01:31:48,691 --> 01:31:48,800
they,

3612
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,110
unless they have some new top secret
moon rover that they don't want to let

3613
01:31:52,111 --> 01:31:52,861
anybody know about it.

3614
01:31:52,861 --> 01:31:54,510
Maybe they found some new cool shit.

3615
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:55,350
Maybe.

3616
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:56,183
Probably.

3617
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:58,950
Yeah.

3618
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:00,220
Maybe they can't go.

3619
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:00,821
Well actually,

3620
01:32:00,821 --> 01:32:03,400
if we really did go in and like,

3621
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:03,730
okay,

3622
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:04,563
give us the money.

3623
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:05,403
Let's figure it out.

3624
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:05,771
Okay,

3625
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:06,461
we'll figure it out.

3626
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:07,450
We got 19 billion.

3627
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:09,490
If we really didn't find out,

3628
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,080
nobody else is working on it.

3629
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,000
Putting a the rover on the moon,

3630
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:13,660
but,

3631
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:13,950
and the,

3632
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:16,570
and the NASA wasn't
either until Trump said,

3633
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:17,404
here's the money,

3634
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:18,490
let's go to the fucking moon.

3635
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:19,480
And then we're going to Mars.

3636
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:20,211
She matched.

3637
01:32:20,211 --> 01:32:23,590
If Trump goes on TV and says
there's a lot of things talk about,

3638
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,670
one of them is,

3639
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:25,840
it's terrible tragedy.

3640
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:26,950
We've never been to the moon.

3641
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:27,784
Ladies and gentlemen.

3642
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,930
That's some shit he would do.

3643
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:30,350
Yeah.

3644
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:30,740
Oh yeah.

3645
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:31,290
Yeah.

3646
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:32,123
He doesn't know.

3647
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,070
He doesn't know.

3648
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:37,140
How do you know he doesn't let him know
he's too busy with us friends with Alex

3649
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:37,320
Jones.

3650
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:40,600
He's a really talked that
much cause you can't,

3651
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:41,081
they can't.

3652
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:41,681
Everywhere they go,

3653
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:42,431
the wearing wires,

3654
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:43,270
everyone's wearing a wire.

3655
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:44,390
Their phones are being tapped.

3656
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:47,470
Q a nine is Qa and I've heard about that.

3657
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:48,520
It's crazy shit.

3658
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:49,603
What is it?

3659
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,800
Qa non is someone in the
Trump administration,

3660
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:58,630
but people think it's someone
in intelligence in the
military who's dropping all

3661
01:32:58,631 --> 01:33:00,850
these clues on four Chan and eight Chan.

3662
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:01,781
So the whole thing is,

3663
01:33:01,781 --> 01:33:02,441
is it real?

3664
01:33:02,441 --> 01:33:03,460
Is it disinformation?

3665
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:04,600
If someone playing a trick,

3666
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:05,790
but it's he,

3667
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,280
he legally can't say what's
going on behind the scenes.

3668
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:10,210
Nothing leg lock.

3669
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:11,043
Look at this.

3670
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,950
He legally can't say he's getting
it because it's against the law.

3671
01:33:14,951 --> 01:33:15,340
So he,

3672
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,320
he's dropping all these clues and it's a,

3673
01:33:17,321 --> 01:33:21,160
it's someone named Q Anan and it's been
going on for about three months and

3674
01:33:21,161 --> 01:33:22,960
there's all these people
in the underground.

3675
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:23,800
Uh,

3676
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:28,180
basically he's saying trust the president.

3677
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:32,890
It's going to take a while to take down
all these corrupt people at the top of

3678
01:33:32,891 --> 01:33:34,990
the FBI and the Department
of Justice and all the shit.

3679
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:36,490
We're going to take them down one by one.

3680
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:39,160
So He's been dropping all these
clues on how they're going to do it.

3681
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:40,450
It's pretty interesting.

3682
01:33:40,451 --> 01:33:42,520
You listen to it every day
has drops every day and it's,

3683
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:43,331
it's like,

3684
01:33:43,331 --> 01:33:44,164
uh,

3685
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:45,070
it gets addicting,

3686
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:46,900
but you don't know if it's real or not.

3687
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:47,441
Like is it,

3688
01:33:47,441 --> 01:33:48,700
is it disinformation?

3689
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,500
It's called Q Anan and Pete,

3690
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:53,800
he makes drops every day and leaves all
these clues of what's going on behind

3691
01:33:53,801 --> 01:33:54,190
the scenes.

3692
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:56,560
No one can trace back to find out
who he is or anything like that.

3693
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:57,070
No,

3694
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:59,380
I think on four Chan or eight Chan,

3695
01:33:59,410 --> 01:33:59,771
isn't it?

3696
01:33:59,771 --> 01:33:59,980
Like,

3697
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:00,730
if you can,

3698
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:02,920
you can hackers know
how to drop information,

3699
01:34:02,921 --> 01:34:04,360
information without being tracked,

3700
01:34:04,361 --> 01:34:04,561
right?

3701
01:34:04,561 --> 01:34:05,140
For sure.

3702
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:05,560
Right?

3703
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,130
Is that,

3704
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:07,680
that's what's going on and on.

3705
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:08,171
I know you have,

3706
01:34:08,171 --> 01:34:08,430
right?

3707
01:34:08,430 --> 01:34:08,601
Yeah.

3708
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:09,670
There's a bunch of posts about it,

3709
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:10,504
but again,

3710
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:11,860
who knows if it's real or not,

3711
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:13,660
but the people that,

3712
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:13,931
I mean,

3713
01:34:13,931 --> 01:34:14,860
there's people who who,

3714
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:15,150
uh,

3715
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:18,430
there's a guy named Jerome
Corsi who works for Alex Jones,

3716
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:22,510
who that's his job is to analyze what's
all of these clues of what's going on,

3717
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:24,190
what Trump is doing behind the scenes,

3718
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:25,940
because he's got the media all the time,

3719
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,470
media,

3720
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:27,303
Hollywood,

3721
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:28,150
FBI,

3722
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:32,920
and what they're finding out is they're
finding text messages and emails going

3723
01:34:32,921 --> 01:34:33,970
back and forth,

3724
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:35,183
uh,

3725
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:38,170
between key people,

3726
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:39,340
uh,

3727
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:43,180
running the government
colluding to destroy Trump.

3728
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:44,651
That's what's going on.

3729
01:34:44,651 --> 01:34:46,840
So for sure it's a crazy shun him around.

3730
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:47,650
No,

3731
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:51,490
none of those people that have been
in politics but politics forever.

3732
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:53,110
They didn't think he was going to win.

3733
01:34:53,111 --> 01:34:55,540
So they did all this shit
thinking Hillary was gonna win,

3734
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:56,980
but now that he won,

3735
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,830
they're going back and looking at all
the text messages from all of these super

3736
01:35:00,831 --> 01:35:01,880
powerful people.

3737
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,040
People are are are resigning.

3738
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:05,770
It's crazy shit going on
and most people don't know.

3739
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,270
It's like game of Thrones for real.

3740
01:35:08,271 --> 01:35:12,740
You're not game of Thrones has like 50
characters and it would take you about a

3741
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:16,520
month to to to catch up on what's going
on and it's just so much going on.

3742
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:17,750
That's what's going on.

3743
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:22,910
There's a game of Thrones going on right
now but the media is only going to tell

3744
01:35:22,911 --> 01:35:27,670
you their side and then Qa non is dropping
the behind the scenes clues but it's

3745
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:28,460
pretty fascinating.

3746
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,510
Arm Triangle here.

3747
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:31,650
There's another seminar.

3748
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:37,490
This is 100% it's all a hundred percent
it's over a hundred percent the camera,

3749
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:39,930
oh go back to the camera.

3750
01:35:39,931 --> 01:35:40,670
He's talking to it.

3751
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,800
You should jump to full guard
and she jumped the full guard.

3752
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:44,300
Why do you think this is definitely done?

3753
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,141
It's so deep in,

3754
01:35:45,141 --> 01:35:46,640
the guy's not doing
anything with his left hand.

3755
01:35:46,641 --> 01:35:47,474
While he wasn't,

3756
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:49,240
if he just jumps down,

3757
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:50,390
there you go.

3758
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:50,601
Okay,

3759
01:35:50,601 --> 01:35:51,434
it's over now.

3760
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,233
It's no way.

3761
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:53,631
No Way.

3762
01:35:53,631 --> 01:35:54,464
He's going to

3763
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:57,610
four five for submission,

3764
01:35:57,770 --> 01:35:59,120
arm triangle in full guard.

3765
01:35:59,121 --> 01:35:59,780
His bet.

3766
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:03,830
And how about the arm triangle from
standing position drags him to the ground

3767
01:36:03,831 --> 01:36:04,191
stage.

3768
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:04,540
Is it?

3769
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:04,710
Yeah,

3770
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:05,310
that was sick.

3771
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:06,350
That happens every now and then.

3772
01:36:06,351 --> 01:36:09,570
You see it every now and then when
you gotta you gotta you gotta,

3773
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,900
you gotta be tapping people so
much with your arm triangle.

3774
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:15,320
You have so much faith in it and it's
gotta be a Goto to take a chance like

3775
01:36:15,321 --> 01:36:15,740
that.

3776
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:16,910
If it's not your go to.

3777
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:19,700
That's why you don't really see it
because there's not that many fighters

3778
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:22,790
overall in MMA that are known
for amazing harm triangles.

3779
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:24,050
It's kind of popular.

3780
01:36:24,051 --> 01:36:24,884
It is probably,

3781
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:25,490
you know,

3782
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:30,490
I would say 25% of MMA fighters
have high level arm triangles.

3783
01:36:31,521 --> 01:36:33,170
I would say maybe that's a little high,

3784
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:36,560
but you know about 2020 5% well,

3785
01:36:36,561 --> 01:36:39,980
what he did there that was
special was get sideways.

3786
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:42,260
He was doing like a rear
naked choke from the side.

3787
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:44,060
Is that a Brazilian or a Mexican?

3788
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:44,901
What is his name?

3789
01:36:44,901 --> 01:36:45,734
Jamie

3790
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:47,693
fought Samsung.

3791
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:50,420
The Brazil flag on the short.

3792
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:51,283
This is dope.

3793
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,090
Look how it clamps has shit down.

3794
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:54,110
Very interesting.

3795
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:55,101
Very interesting.

3796
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,690
Cause he look out tidy gets hit man.

3797
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,250
He gets it super tight.

3798
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,350
Will Sanchez Manual Sanchez

3799
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:03,493
Mexicans.

3800
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:04,483
They got hard.

3801
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:04,820
Dude.

3802
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:05,840
This is phenomenal.

3803
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:07,040
Do you know who needs to make it?

3804
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,200
Come back to full guard.

3805
01:37:09,201 --> 01:37:09,740
Look at this.

3806
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:11,030
See what he's doing with his left hand.

3807
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:13,010
He's not really protecting anything.

3808
01:37:13,011 --> 01:37:14,980
So that shows me that uh,

3809
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:17,390
he kind of doesn't know
how to get out of it.

3810
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:18,650
Wow.

3811
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:20,450
Super Snuggie that's amazing.

3812
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:22,430
The Mexican that we need to come back.

3813
01:37:22,431 --> 01:37:23,410
Does Yoyo Rodriguez.

3814
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:24,170
Oh,

3815
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:27,260
he was offered Yair
Rodriguez that beat correct.

3816
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:31,610
Magwell bed shower actually
came into my gym last week.

3817
01:37:31,611 --> 01:37:32,444
A couple days.

3818
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:33,840
He's a did.

3819
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,220
Yup.

3820
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,110
She came in with Kelvin.

3821
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:37,110
They've been hanging out all,

3822
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:38,323
he's phenomenal.

3823
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:39,283
Phenomenal.

3824
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:41,420
You don't want to see him versus IB.

3825
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:41,810
No.

3826
01:37:41,810 --> 01:37:42,643
Why not?

3827
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,200
Hold hold.

3828
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:47,690
Don't want someone to lose
the only amazing fight.

3829
01:37:47,691 --> 01:37:47,841
Yeah,

3830
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:49,420
you're just fought Frankie Edgar.

3831
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,350
Well his last fight with frank get lost.

3832
01:37:51,351 --> 01:37:51,561
Right.

3833
01:37:51,561 --> 01:37:52,790
Got dismantled.

3834
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,830
So you got to toss him fucking beat.

3835
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,230
Who could probably beat
the top five right now.

3836
01:37:58,530 --> 01:37:59,450
So for a kid,

3837
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:00,613
why not?

3838
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:01,950
Who wouldn't want to see that?

3839
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:02,850
The heart we do.

3840
01:38:02,851 --> 01:38:03,481
But if you're,

3841
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:04,141
if you care about,

3842
01:38:04,141 --> 01:38:04,351
yeah,

3843
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:06,420
here the heart chords knows I beat,

3844
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,740
but he's not a huge name.

3845
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:09,690
So for a year it's a huge risk.

3846
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:10,960
So you can stop,

3847
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,750
get back in the [inaudible].

3848
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:13,643
I think you beat them.

3849
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,250
It's a tough fucking fight for a man.

3850
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:17,670
I have to Frankie Edgar,

3851
01:38:17,730 --> 01:38:18,390
right?

3852
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:19,223
True.

3853
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:22,030
Do you want to buy different fight?

3854
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:27,890
I'd like to see it because a year and my
opinion has the most dynamic standup in

3855
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:30,930
all of MMA cause he
throws so much crazy shit.

3856
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:31,980
He's done the wild shit.

3857
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:32,843
I love it.

3858
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:33,331
Listen man.

3859
01:38:33,331 --> 01:38:34,200
So does that beat,

3860
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:35,363
that's why I want to see it.

3861
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:35,960
I want to see it.

3862
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,190
It looked like a beats rest
like a Jackie Chan fight.

3863
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:39,690
Sabina is a,

3864
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,010
he's got a bunch of like really
solid fundamental movements.

3865
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:45,630
Like when he lands,

3866
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:49,260
like he'll throw something
and even if he liked he's off.

3867
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:52,890
He'll shuffle and adjust and
always be in perfect position.

3868
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:57,210
Like he's really good at like throwing
kicks and throwing punches or elbows or

3869
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:57,901
knees.

3870
01:38:57,901 --> 01:38:58,734
Anything he does,

3871
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:59,340
he's,

3872
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:00,960
he hits you and then boom,

3873
01:39:00,961 --> 01:39:01,471
he's in prep.

3874
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:02,340
Doesn't have any holes.

3875
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:02,551
Yeah,

3876
01:39:02,551 --> 01:39:02,791
he didn't,

3877
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:04,920
he never say him stumble or look weird.

3878
01:39:04,921 --> 01:39:07,590
He's never like off balance
or the same team as could be.

3879
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:08,740
No.

3880
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:09,030
Awesome.

3881
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:10,020
Mark Henry Guy,

3882
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,310
he's Mark Henry Guy,

3883
01:39:11,311 --> 01:39:11,941
New Jersey mark.

3884
01:39:11,941 --> 01:39:12,960
Cause they're talking about them.

3885
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,070
They're kind of fair friends.

3886
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:16,180
They're all from Dagestan place.

3887
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,460
Maybe they trained,

3888
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:21,540
maybe they came up together in the
same club because I see this pretty big

3889
01:39:21,570 --> 01:39:22,021
Khabib.

3890
01:39:22,021 --> 01:39:23,250
Khabib is always reach.

3891
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:24,093
We treating,

3892
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:24,751
we tweeting,

3893
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:25,584
retreating,

3894
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:27,480
retreating from the motherland.

3895
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,970
But zombied is a very different game.

3896
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:31,930
I mean he's not a wrestler per se.

3897
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:32,211
He's,

3898
01:39:32,211 --> 01:39:33,360
he's got really good Jujitsu.

3899
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:34,223
He's got very good,

3900
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,560
he's good at everything.

3901
01:39:35,561 --> 01:39:38,310
So if your guy here
and you're a young kid,

3902
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:40,710
you just get your ass whooped
by Frank Jase taking a year off.

3903
01:39:40,711 --> 01:39:42,990
He's trying to figure things
out and you're going to fight.

3904
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:43,531
Is that beat?

3905
01:39:43,531 --> 01:39:46,200
Who could I think could hang
with the top five right now.

3906
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:47,820
You want to find right
now and he's ranked what?

3907
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:48,690
Maybe 14th.

3908
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:49,490
13th.

3909
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:49,880
Um,

3910
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:50,580
she gonna find them.

3911
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:52,680
We'll let him fight when he's like five,

3912
01:39:52,681 --> 01:39:53,011
three,

3913
01:39:53,011 --> 01:39:54,120
two eight when he was the champ.

3914
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:54,540
Not now.

3915
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:54,901
I know.

3916
01:39:54,901 --> 01:39:56,670
Is that beats people
want to check the site.

3917
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:58,590
I don't know if they
made that fact though.

3918
01:39:58,630 --> 01:39:59,463
I don't know cause I know,

3919
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:00,211
I know.

3920
01:40:00,211 --> 01:40:00,391
Yeah.

3921
01:40:00,391 --> 01:40:01,224
Buyer's agent.

3922
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,060
Congrats on a great winds up beat.

3923
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,830
It'd be an honor to fight you one day.

3924
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:09,060
We'll have to meet each other in the top
10 which I know you'll make quickly my

3925
01:40:09,061 --> 01:40:10,200
next fight coming up.

3926
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:11,310
So stay tuned.

3927
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:12,030
I know.

3928
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:13,770
Jaegers agent really well and they're not,

3929
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,040
there's no way they take that fight.

3930
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:15,940
That's what it is.

3931
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:19,770
You think they made a conscious decision
now's not the right time to find them.

3932
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:22,520
Wait till his top 10 and I agree
with you on the top 10 or Heidi.

3933
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:23,383
Right.

3934
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,500
In my opinion and my opinion.

3935
01:40:25,501 --> 01:40:25,751
Yeah,

3936
01:40:25,751 --> 01:40:28,470
I watched him against Bochniac and again,

3937
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:29,730
you know Boq Nats,

3938
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:30,720
super tough guy.

3939
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:36,750
Kyle Bachman Magomed Sharapov fla.

3940
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,100
It's not even happening for me.

3941
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:38,963
Damn.

3942
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,160
I'm a been three years ago.

3943
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:44,610
I stumbled through ruined a
couple of times at the weigh ins.

3944
01:40:44,611 --> 01:40:45,444
I stumbled through it.

3945
01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:46,530
Did you have to track this?

3946
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:47,610
Will you read it?

3947
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:48,990
Like if I read it like I,

3948
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:49,310
I've,

3949
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:52,380
I've watched him fight but when I
watched him fight it says this is a beat,

3950
01:40:52,381 --> 01:40:54,100
whatever the fuck his last
name is [inaudible] and then,

3951
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:57,010
but it wasn't until I have to call it,

3952
01:40:57,390 --> 01:41:01,450
I got to remember here it like if I
hear you say it like multiple times,

3953
01:41:01,451 --> 01:41:02,284
then I pick it up

3954
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:04,630
mega med.

3955
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:04,961
Sure.

3956
01:41:04,961 --> 01:41:07,430
Paul Magomed Chicago Edge.

3957
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:08,343
That's not that hard.

3958
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:09,760
But they want you to just,

3959
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:14,080
is that beat because like for American
fans like that's a hard sell when Norma

3960
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:17,050
got Madoff is hard but everybody calls
him could be in for the most part.

3961
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:17,590
Yeah.

3962
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:19,390
Does that beat is super high level man.

3963
01:41:19,391 --> 01:41:22,900
I was so impressed with his striking
the way many of the broken arm or broken

3964
01:41:22,901 --> 01:41:27,901
fist into the fight entered the fight
with her hitting the pads I got mucked up

3965
01:41:27,971 --> 01:41:31,190
is Mark Henry told me he's
the most talented guy he's
ever seen come through as

3966
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,580
Jim Rez Barboza.

3967
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,300
Frankie Edgar says the beat
by far the most talented guy.

3968
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:37,290
That's how bad is it?

3969
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:39,130
Credible fight with Barboza.

3970
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,360
Oo dammit.

3971
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:41,260
He's a beast.

3972
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:43,263
Kevin Leila.

3973
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:44,471
Kevin.

3974
01:41:44,471 --> 01:41:46,930
See I think Kevin Lee
Kobi was a great fight.

3975
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:47,720
Great Fun.

3976
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,110
Because I think at two down,

3977
01:41:49,170 --> 01:41:49,401
see,

3978
01:41:49,401 --> 01:41:51,120
I think Kevin Lee does things better.

3979
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:53,770
Some things better than
Khabib does and could be,

3980
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:56,200
does some things better than Kevin,

3981
01:41:56,201 --> 01:41:57,270
but I think Kevin's better.

3982
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:58,690
The more important things.

3983
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:00,580
It's hard to tell who does what better.

3984
01:42:00,581 --> 01:42:02,920
It really is because they're
both so good at everything.

3985
01:42:02,921 --> 01:42:05,790
Not only comes to quick
strike showing him no,

3986
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,540
no.

3987
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:07,090
Kevin.

3988
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:07,411
Kevin,

3989
01:42:07,411 --> 01:42:08,420
we have by a long shot.

3990
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,273
Yeah,

3991
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:10,270
he's good.

3992
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:10,550
Yeah.

3993
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:11,383
Can bebes good.

3994
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:11,880
Kevin.

3995
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:12,880
Kevin to stretch.

3996
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,360
It'd be better standing up there.

3997
01:42:14,361 --> 01:42:18,100
The real question is going to be in the
wrestling because Khabib's it's number

3998
01:42:18,101 --> 01:42:18,251
one.

3999
01:42:18,251 --> 01:42:20,620
Goal's not stand up and have
a kickboxing match with you.

4000
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,110
It's no one goes to mall year
and whoever gets the take down,

4001
01:42:24,111 --> 01:42:26,800
it all comes down to how good
the guy on the bottom is.

4002
01:42:26,801 --> 01:42:27,580
Office cat.

4003
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:28,650
Kevin's a better cop.

4004
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:29,920
Kevin's a better grappler.

4005
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,780
He's better at finishing from the back.

4006
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:32,201
Correct?

4007
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:33,034
I can't say.

4008
01:42:33,070 --> 01:42:37,090
And I get his mouth and his past and
his finished his passing in that fight,

4009
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,230
the passing and the first row.

4010
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:38,561
First of all,

4011
01:42:38,561 --> 01:42:41,070
I took Barboza down quicker
than could be did it could beep,

4012
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:41,740
struggled.

4013
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,510
Barboza shook him off a couple of times,

4014
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,630
but cubby breaks everybody.

4015
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:48,220
Everybody that grapples with them,

4016
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,330
you find out,

4017
01:42:49,331 --> 01:42:49,541
you know,

4018
01:42:49,541 --> 01:42:51,820
Kevin has a higher takedown success.

4019
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:52,151
Right?

4020
01:42:52,151 --> 01:42:53,530
But Khabib,

4021
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:55,630
even against guys that are really good,

4022
01:42:55,631 --> 01:42:56,500
like dos Anjos,

4023
01:42:56,501 --> 01:42:58,060
he mauls those fuckers.

4024
01:42:58,061 --> 01:42:58,930
He knows people.

4025
01:42:58,950 --> 01:42:59,060
No,

4026
01:42:59,060 --> 01:42:59,920
it's a great fighter.

4027
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:00,670
Great.

4028
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:01,503
Like Kevin,

4029
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:03,250
he's getting,

4030
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:05,320
he's new to the 25 years old.

4031
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:08,320
So in 25 he's smart.

4032
01:43:08,321 --> 01:43:08,480
It's,

4033
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,810
who knows who can take
Kevin Lee as smart as fuck.

4034
01:43:10,811 --> 01:43:11,471
John and Kevin.

4035
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:15,160
Kevin Lee could beep to me is the most
interesting fight beside as soon as he

4036
01:43:15,161 --> 01:43:15,994
gets out.

4037
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:18,640
Tony itself get about dre.

4038
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,400
He's out for a little bit and
that's why Tony Tony could be about,

4039
01:43:23,410 --> 01:43:25,240
I'd love to see that but I go see Tony,

4040
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:25,780
Nate Diaz.

4041
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:29,530
But however with Tony being hurt so I
don't put them in the discussion right

4042
01:43:29,531 --> 01:43:30,364
now.

4043
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:31,900
Kevin Lee Khabib's the fights fair,

4044
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:34,660
that surgery that that stitches the side,

4045
01:43:34,661 --> 01:43:38,320
the size of the fucking wound ever seen
anything like that in my life was like a

4046
01:43:38,321 --> 01:43:41,650
motorcycle accident was whole
LCL came off that poor dude.

4047
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:46,700
I've never seen anybody with horrible
or horrific like surgical wound on their

4048
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:47,250
knee.

4049
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:47,741
That's hard.

4050
01:43:47,741 --> 01:43:49,600
That's like some 1980 shit.

4051
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:53,900
Like when they used to have to open you
up and like a suitcase and check around

4052
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:56,300
and replace Shit and he's
not a guy I'm worried about.

4053
01:43:56,301 --> 01:43:58,750
You know some guys when they get
an injury I'm like Oh fuck the,

4054
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,320
I'm not worried about
Tony for some reason.

4055
01:44:00,321 --> 01:44:01,310
Look at that though dude.

4056
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:02,810
Do you know how big that is?

4057
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,110
That's a giant ass wound that
looks like a 12 inch wound,

4058
01:44:06,150 --> 01:44:07,640
had to reattach the whole thing.

4059
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:10,130
That's a rare knee operation right there.

4060
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:14,990
The fact that that happened while he was
just walking and tripped is so fucking

4061
01:44:14,991 --> 01:44:18,140
crazy that a guy with his kind of balance,

4062
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,180
he must've been exhausted.

4063
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,470
That's the only thing that makes sense.

4064
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:25,520
He must've been just run ragged doing all
these interviews and then like peaking

4065
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:26,390
during training.

4066
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:27,480
Just a freak accident way.

4067
01:44:27,481 --> 01:44:27,651
Yeah.

4068
01:44:27,651 --> 01:44:28,730
I'm just making things up.

4069
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:29,900
I don't know what the fuck happened.

4070
01:44:29,901 --> 01:44:30,320
Fuck,

4071
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,610
but it's such a bummer.

4072
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:32,001
Oh,

4073
01:44:32,001 --> 01:44:34,280
we should [inaudible] I've
talked about this before.

4074
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:35,270
We should talk about it again.

4075
01:44:35,271 --> 01:44:36,770
He was not wearing sunglasses.

4076
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:39,620
That was something he misspoke.

4077
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:43,340
He said he was wearing prescription
sunglasses to Ariel Helwani.

4078
01:44:43,341 --> 01:44:44,174
Is that what he said?

4079
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:45,260
It was a mistake.

4080
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:46,790
So everybody's repeating this,

4081
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:48,680
including me and Dana and
all these other people.

4082
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:51,920
We thought he was wearing sunglasses
inside like he does when he does so stare

4083
01:44:51,921 --> 01:44:52,550
downs.

4084
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:53,690
It's not what was going on.

4085
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,560
Even if he was,

4086
01:44:54,561 --> 01:44:57,810
I don't think regular
glasses and sunglasses.

4087
01:44:57,811 --> 01:44:58,641
It had nothing to do with it.

4088
01:44:58,641 --> 01:44:59,330
He just tripped.

4089
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:02,000
I don't care what some
people were mocking him.

4090
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:02,863
Oh really?

4091
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:04,071
You know,

4092
01:45:04,071 --> 01:45:07,810
especially when the guy's like half
the door and most important part of his

4093
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:09,360
career thought anyway.

4094
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,330
I know he was going to fight anyway.

4095
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:12,110
Crazy.

4096
01:45:12,110 --> 01:45:12,840
In a good way.

4097
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:13,081
He was.

4098
01:45:13,081 --> 01:45:13,491
He was,

4099
01:45:13,491 --> 01:45:14,150
he didn't care.

4100
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:18,080
You guys remember pride when Sakuraba
would literally wrap his legs up like a

4101
01:45:18,081 --> 01:45:18,470
mummy.

4102
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:19,550
That's what Tony was going to get.

4103
01:45:19,630 --> 01:45:21,110
The doctors wouldn't let him.

4104
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:23,330
So he went to two
different documents can be,

4105
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:25,340
it's not fine for a
while because of Ramadan.

4106
01:45:25,341 --> 01:45:26,150
Right?

4107
01:45:26,150 --> 01:45:26,850
I don't know.

4108
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:28,850
He can't fight to Ramadan.

4109
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:32,330
He's out for a few months
because of his religion.

4110
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:34,333
Yeah.

4111
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:34,911
Yeah.

4112
01:45:34,911 --> 01:45:35,990
So then you do what?

4113
01:45:35,991 --> 01:45:36,824
Eddie Alvarez,

4114
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,810
who fought through Ramadan,

4115
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:40,850
went through his train
clamp through Ramadan,

4116
01:45:40,851 --> 01:45:42,080
is a below Muhammad.

4117
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:47,780
He figured out a way to do it and the way
to do it is to train it til nighttime.

4118
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:50,800
Make sure he eats first and
then trains at nighttime.

4119
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:51,710
But he did it.

4120
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:51,980
I thought,

4121
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:52,310
well,

4122
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:52,461
no,

4123
01:45:52,461 --> 01:45:53,150
he did it.

4124
01:45:53,150 --> 01:45:53,481
He did.

4125
01:45:53,481 --> 01:45:53,931
And he fought.

4126
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:54,111
Well,

4127
01:45:54,111 --> 01:45:55,040
he just adjusted his,

4128
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:56,030
did he try to camp?

4129
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:57,470
I forget.

4130
01:45:57,470 --> 01:45:58,670
I don't remember who we follow.

4131
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,310
I'm saying at a championship level,

4132
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:03,230
I would hold off too
if I'm could be right.

4133
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:04,100
I see what you're saying.

4134
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:04,670
I see what you're saying.

4135
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:05,330
But you can do it.

4136
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:06,740
But I remember he fought a good guy.

4137
01:46:06,741 --> 01:46:09,080
I don't remember who
it was was interesting.

4138
01:46:09,081 --> 01:46:09,261
Yeah.

4139
01:46:09,261 --> 01:46:11,360
He figured out his schedule
where he could pull it off.

4140
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:13,290
He can't be the best way to go about it.

4141
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:14,130
The best way to go.

4142
01:46:14,130 --> 01:46:15,380
It was a bad ass do it.

4143
01:46:15,381 --> 01:46:16,460
If it wasn't for your religion,

4144
01:46:16,461 --> 01:46:17,510
there's no way I'd do it.

4145
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:18,860
Just be for performance.

4146
01:46:18,861 --> 01:46:19,880
There's no way you would do it,

4147
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:21,440
but you could do it.

4148
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,960
It could be done because you
just got to wait until dark.

4149
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:24,260
Right.

4150
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:25,130
If I'm compete though,

4151
01:46:25,131 --> 01:46:26,870
I just saw on down,

4152
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:27,650
it's not that hard.

4153
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:28,483
It's not ideal.

4154
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:29,533
It's not ideal.

4155
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:29,961
Well,

4156
01:46:29,961 --> 01:46:31,150
it's fascinating and it's ideal.

4157
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:32,900
Apparently these days it's the best thing.

4158
01:46:32,901 --> 01:46:33,111
No,

4159
01:46:33,111 --> 01:46:33,411
but it,

4160
01:46:33,411 --> 01:46:34,550
but it's not the way,

4161
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:35,420
first of all,

4162
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:36,620
if you're going to do it,

4163
01:46:36,621 --> 01:46:38,180
you wouldn't do it like that.

4164
01:46:38,181 --> 01:46:41,600
Like he wouldn't do it during the
dude like that and you you wouldn't,

4165
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:45,320
you would do it where you stop eating
and like five in the afternoon and then

4166
01:46:45,321 --> 01:46:47,870
you would go off if you
want to have like a long,

4167
01:46:47,871 --> 01:46:49,620
some people argue that's good.

4168
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,120
Who argues that sound good?

4169
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:52,650
Well just from your,

4170
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:57,030
from our human genetics that
you can be hungry at night.

4171
01:46:57,150 --> 01:46:57,600
Right,

4172
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,710
so you don't get as good a sleep.

4173
01:46:58,740 --> 01:46:58,981
Yeah,

4174
01:46:58,981 --> 01:47:01,290
but it depends on what
kind of foods are reading.

4175
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:03,030
That's a big part of what it is.

4176
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:04,980
If you're eating a lot
of refined carbohydrates,

4177
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:06,780
you're going to get really
hungry at night for sure.

4178
01:47:06,781 --> 01:47:08,010
And you're going to want to eat again.

4179
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:11,400
But if you're on more of a fat based Diet,

4180
01:47:11,401 --> 01:47:12,750
you could pull that off for sure.

4181
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:14,580
100% a hundred non stop man.

4182
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:14,940
Yeah,

4183
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:16,020
you could pull it off for sure.

4184
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:17,340
The real question is,

4185
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:21,600
is that the best thing to do for physical
performance and it's most likely not

4186
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:22,410
say no.

4187
01:47:22,410 --> 01:47:23,243
I don't think so.

4188
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,350
We had Zack bitter in here the other day.

4189
01:47:25,351 --> 01:47:26,200
He's a he,

4190
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:27,840
he all ready for this record.

4191
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:33,080
This motherfucker ran a hundred
miles in 11 hours and 40 minutes.

4192
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:38,300
He was averaging a seven minute
mile shit for almost 12 hours.

4193
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:40,320
He weighs four pounds.

4194
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:41,573
Yeah,

4195
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:43,410
Ebay's a buck 40.

4196
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:44,041
He's,

4197
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,240
but he's a very thin guy.

4198
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,150
He's on a fat based Diet.

4199
01:47:48,151 --> 01:47:49,740
He's on a Keto Diet essentially.

4200
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:52,910
But when he goes to race he
takes a lot of carbohydrates,

4201
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:54,210
sugars and everything.

4202
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:55,103
No white guy.

4203
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:55,801
Super Smart.

4204
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:56,240
Kevin.

4205
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:56,791
Super Smart.

4206
01:47:56,791 --> 01:47:57,480
White Dude.

4207
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,320
Really Nice Guy.

4208
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:58,830
Um,

4209
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:02,250
but imagine that shit happened strong.

4210
01:48:02,251 --> 01:48:04,710
Your fucking mind has to be strong.

4211
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:07,710
Your mind has to be to run
11 hours and 40 minutes.

4212
01:48:07,711 --> 01:48:08,360
Is that a word?

4213
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:08,670
A minute.

4214
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:09,200
Yup.

4215
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:09,650
That's it.

4216
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:10,830
Or the U s record us,

4217
01:48:10,831 --> 01:48:15,480
record us American record who
holds the record so he probably,

4218
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:19,470
Mexicans can run marathons.

4219
01:48:19,710 --> 01:48:21,390
We don't play football or basketball,

4220
01:48:21,391 --> 01:48:22,170
but shit,

4221
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:26,480
she didn't run for a long ass time and
though the mountains of Mexico City,

4222
01:48:26,481 --> 01:48:28,430
Him and well that's what part of that um,

4223
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:30,580
book born to run that
she loves us mountain.

4224
01:48:30,581 --> 01:48:31,200
Yeah.

4225
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,330
Those guys who ran like
basically barefoot.

4226
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,193
Yeah.

4227
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:36,810
There's some boys in a New Mexico too.

4228
01:48:36,811 --> 01:48:38,420
They're like the number
one cross country team.

4229
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:39,450
All the Mexicans there

4230
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:41,640
oil,

4231
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,473
the white kids.

4232
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:44,070
Mexicans are really known for Cardio.

4233
01:48:44,071 --> 01:48:44,910
It's very interesting.

4234
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:45,803
Heart,

4235
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:47,760
heart and cardiac hook to look at that.

4236
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:48,750
Look at the boxers.

4237
01:48:48,751 --> 01:48:49,950
Look at the MMA fighters.

4238
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:50,910
MMA fighters,

4239
01:48:50,911 --> 01:48:51,511
boxers.

4240
01:48:51,511 --> 01:48:51,771
Yup.

4241
01:48:51,771 --> 01:48:52,620
No one for cardio.

4242
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:53,311
How about Julio?

4243
01:48:53,311 --> 01:48:54,150
Cesar Chavez.

4244
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:55,020
Ah,

4245
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:55,531
fucker.

4246
01:48:55,531 --> 01:48:57,450
Just was overwhelming.

4247
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:59,580
He never stopped coming at you.

4248
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:00,450
He was,

4249
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:03,090
he was so beautiful when
he was in his prime.

4250
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:05,670
When he would throw
combinations like to the body,

4251
01:49:05,671 --> 01:49:06,300
to the head,

4252
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:07,650
upper cuts stepped to the side,

4253
01:49:07,651 --> 01:49:08,161
right hand,

4254
01:49:08,161 --> 01:49:08,581
left hook,

4255
01:49:08,581 --> 01:49:09,600
right hand to the body.

4256
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:11,520
He was just nonstop.

4257
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:16,290
His volume was so impressive in his
placement just to fucking amazing.

4258
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:16,471
Hey,

4259
01:49:16,471 --> 01:49:17,304
what's going on here?

4260
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,940
It's so fast to just toss.

4261
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:21,570
Fatal is not ready.

4262
01:49:21,690 --> 01:49:25,440
The record is held by a
25 year old Russian ship.

4263
01:49:25,730 --> 01:49:26,690
Powerful EPO.

4264
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:33,370
11 1128 I can't trust
anything after ICARUS.

4265
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:34,441
You like,

4266
01:49:34,441 --> 01:49:34,920
wait,

4267
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:35,400
what?

4268
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:37,830
I hit rush and I assume
you can't trust them.

4269
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:38,270
I mean,

4270
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:41,430
isn't all countries different
show shirt for sure.

4271
01:49:41,431 --> 01:49:44,730
A hundred percent hundred percent
they just got busted once.

4272
01:49:44,731 --> 01:49:45,630
You watched ICARUS though.

4273
01:49:45,631 --> 01:49:46,170
Yeah,

4274
01:49:46,170 --> 01:49:46,920
I saw it.

4275
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:47,050
Well,

4276
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:49,210
even when Zach was
talking about the testing,

4277
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:52,210
when Zach was talking to me
about testing for these things,

4278
01:49:52,211 --> 01:49:52,541
he was,

4279
01:49:52,541 --> 01:49:53,830
he was kind of led on that.

4280
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:58,120
One of the things that's different is the
culture of the guys that run a hundred

4281
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:58,420
miles.

4282
01:49:58,420 --> 01:49:59,800
Like it's not in the culture,

4283
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,540
whereas like in the cycling culture,

4284
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:02,980
it's a big part of the culture.

4285
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:04,210
Like everybody does it.

4286
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:04,981
But in the,

4287
01:50:04,981 --> 01:50:05,290
the,

4288
01:50:05,290 --> 01:50:08,170
that ultra marathon
world is a brain world.

4289
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:10,630
That's a world of like
how much can you take?

4290
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:12,370
Like you can physically do it.

4291
01:50:12,490 --> 01:50:14,020
They're not doing
anything crazy physically,

4292
01:50:14,021 --> 01:50:17,790
like Usain bolt or someone who
would not get the genetic right.

4293
01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:18,580
But they're there.

4294
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:19,600
They're all small though.

4295
01:50:19,601 --> 01:50:19,841
Right.

4296
01:50:19,841 --> 01:50:20,674
I would love to do them.

4297
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:21,460
Another sound,

4298
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:22,750
another fucking sob.

4299
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:24,880
God Damn Bar.

4300
01:50:25,090 --> 01:50:25,923
It's a seminar.

4301
01:50:27,110 --> 01:50:27,943
Cash.

4302
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,060
Dylan's rash.

4303
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:30,400
High Level Jujitsu.

4304
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:31,080
Tonight's 17.

4305
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:31,840
Nice.

4306
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:32,080
Yes.

4307
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:32,980
Hairlines out to,

4308
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:33,600
um,

4309
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:34,270
um,

4310
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:35,230
what we're just saying.

4311
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:35,470
Well,

4312
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:35,770
we just,

4313
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:35,951
Oh,

4314
01:50:35,951 --> 01:50:37,330
I was saying those guys are small though.

4315
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:37,621
Genetically.

4316
01:50:37,621 --> 01:50:38,740
They're not like freaks.

4317
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:39,940
I wish I could do it,

4318
01:50:39,941 --> 01:50:41,170
but I'm just to gut ambig.

4319
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:41,621
Yeah,

4320
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:42,454
it's a shame.

4321
01:50:42,610 --> 01:50:42,821
Well,

4322
01:50:42,821 --> 01:50:45,160
you'd have to lose weight for sure.

4323
01:50:45,161 --> 01:50:46,510
You'd have to dry yourself out.

4324
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:47,000
Oh,

4325
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:47,740
it's to honor.

4326
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:48,573
Love it that much.

4327
01:50:48,610 --> 01:50:49,450
Even when Cam,

4328
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:51,700
when he does like the big ones,

4329
01:50:51,701 --> 01:50:56,701
like when he did the Moab to 40 he got
down to sick to one 60 rather once 65 I

4330
01:50:57,641 --> 01:50:58,810
think he's a big dude.

4331
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:01,260
Usually weighs about one 85 be mighty.

4332
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:05,650
Got To one 60 you might actually got
right below one 60 but he sowed so

4333
01:51:05,651 --> 01:51:06,010
hardcore.

4334
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:06,843
You know how he did it?

4335
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:09,970
He just worked out burn 4,000 calories,

4336
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:10,271
eight,

4337
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:11,950
3000 skus doing that.

4338
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:12,950
He did that.

4339
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:15,520
Something hard to piece your mind.

4340
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:17,440
I wish they would show that again,

4341
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:19,200
but the way he set that arm bar up,

4342
01:51:19,201 --> 01:51:24,201
it was he a remember the teepee crossing
your ankles and you extend your legs

4343
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:25,744
instead of leg curl.

4344
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:27,520
When the extended him,

4345
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:30,880
it put everything in a in a right
angle and then he upped it over.

4346
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:33,790
Then he hit or guest tattoo too.

4347
01:51:33,791 --> 01:51:34,960
That's in game of Thrones shit.

4348
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:36,401
Do you know what?

4349
01:51:36,401 --> 01:51:37,780
I've been watching vikings.

4350
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:39,580
I can't get into Viking.

4351
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:39,911
Dude.

4352
01:51:39,911 --> 01:51:41,200
It's a good God damn show.

4353
01:51:41,201 --> 01:51:42,820
You got to get four episodes in.

4354
01:51:42,950 --> 01:51:43,783
I uh,

4355
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:47,290
no I haven't watched it
gets too complicated.

4356
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:49,190
Now I saw that.

4357
01:51:49,390 --> 01:51:50,400
I saw first episode.

4358
01:51:50,401 --> 01:51:50,621
I'm like,

4359
01:51:50,621 --> 01:51:51,370
shit,

4360
01:51:51,370 --> 01:51:52,203
what's going on guys?

4361
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:55,640
Refresh any of the old ones before he
started the new one because it's been a

4362
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:55,950
swell.

4363
01:51:55,950 --> 01:51:57,670
The preview is like three minutes long.

4364
01:51:57,671 --> 01:51:59,590
They kind of give you a
good background of it.

4365
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:00,483
I never got into

4366
01:52:02,170 --> 01:52:03,820
the opening as all the,

4367
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:04,420
uh,

4368
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:06,280
the robots don't tell me anything.

4369
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:06,760
Okay.

4370
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:08,620
Don't tell me how dare
you find out right away.

4371
01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:10,980
I'm just waiting for game
of Thrones star alert.

4372
01:52:10,981 --> 01:52:11,800
Where are you confused?

4373
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:12,940
Don't get confusing.

4374
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:15,250
And kind of the first
season was very confusing.

4375
01:52:15,251 --> 01:52:15,790
Also.

4376
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:16,623
It took a while to fit.

4377
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:17,470
They're saying that what?

4378
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:17,770
Caesar,

4379
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:19,450
they and now three second,

4380
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:20,600
they're saying it's so confusing.

4381
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:22,240
They're losing subscribers.

4382
01:52:22,241 --> 01:52:23,530
Like ratings are just fucking,

4383
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:27,670
but how do they know it's one
episode that I just read that Bro,

4384
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:29,383
you know what?

4385
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:33,910
We'll just write shit like that
just to be assholes I think today.

4386
01:52:33,930 --> 01:52:34,210
Yeah.

4387
01:52:34,210 --> 01:52:35,920
I think there's maybe
the writers confused.

4388
01:52:35,921 --> 01:52:37,210
So like everyone's confused.

4389
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:38,590
You talked about it,

4390
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:39,360
so you already talked,

4391
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:40,060
not validated.

4392
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:43,030
You talked about it because it's a
thing that you want to hear and go,

4393
01:52:43,031 --> 01:52:43,481
Oh man,

4394
01:52:43,481 --> 01:52:44,500
look what's going on over there.

4395
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:44,680
No,

4396
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:45,040
I don't.

4397
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:45,751
Too complicated.

4398
01:52:45,751 --> 01:52:46,700
I like West Hall.

4399
01:52:46,701 --> 01:52:48,110
I heard the loosened subscribers.

4400
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:49,183
Maybe

4401
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:54,860
if you're going to sell magazines or an
article and you want to appeal to that

4402
01:52:54,861 --> 01:52:56,600
mindset that we're just
talking about earlier,

4403
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:57,351
that's what you would,

4404
01:52:57,351 --> 01:52:57,980
right.

4405
01:52:57,980 --> 01:52:58,813
You're right,

4406
01:52:59,170 --> 01:53:02,530
but I'm saying is that last thing
I read was that on Westworld.

4407
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:03,680
I don't watch Westworld.

4408
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:05,600
I'm not sure if people dig it.

4409
01:53:05,601 --> 01:53:06,260
He never watched it.

4410
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:06,920
No.

4411
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:08,240
You've got to start from scratch.

4412
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:09,560
I'm telling you it's a good show.

4413
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:10,640
I know people love it,

4414
01:53:10,641 --> 01:53:10,850
man.

4415
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:11,683
You can't do it.

4416
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:12,351
I don't know.

4417
01:53:12,351 --> 01:53:13,480
You seem like you're never going to do it.

4418
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:14,390
I talking to you right now.

4419
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:15,171
He'd be like,

4420
01:53:15,171 --> 01:53:15,320
yeah,

4421
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:15,521
yeah,

4422
01:53:15,521 --> 01:53:15,840
yeah.

4423
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,180
Just same way with game of Thrones,

4424
01:53:17,181 --> 01:53:18,390
but then you guys talked me into it.

4425
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:19,610
This is my favorite show of all time.

4426
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:20,300
There you go,

4427
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:20,721
telling you,

4428
01:53:20,721 --> 01:53:21,380
dude,

4429
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:23,150
get season one of Vikings.

4430
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:23,991
These dudes.

4431
01:53:23,991 --> 01:53:25,700
Fuck people up.

4432
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,750
It's fun.

4433
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:27,591
It's on history.

4434
01:53:27,591 --> 01:53:27,921
Could,

4435
01:53:27,921 --> 01:53:32,921
I think it's basically a historical
reenactment of the Viking days based on a

4436
01:53:33,951 --> 01:53:34,401
true story.

4437
01:53:34,401 --> 01:53:35,170
Yeah.

4438
01:53:35,170 --> 01:53:36,650
Ragdar Loft Brook,

4439
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:39,230
who was a real viking like real shit.

4440
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:41,790
If they know that they
wrote down every word,

4441
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:42,621
they listen to me,

4442
01:53:42,621 --> 01:53:42,980
man.

4443
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:45,890
They wrote down every word they
said all throughout the day,

4444
01:53:45,891 --> 01:53:46,790
his whole life.

4445
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:47,900
So they got it.

4446
01:53:47,901 --> 01:53:51,090
They got there by fuck.

4447
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,150
You even get the can read Viking.

4448
01:53:53,690 --> 01:53:55,460
You know who knows what
the guy said and did,

4449
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:57,350
but it's a really well made show.

4450
01:53:57,380 --> 01:53:59,540
It's the acting is fucking amazing.

4451
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:02,180
I think they have five seasons.

4452
01:54:02,181 --> 01:54:02,931
What are they trying to do?

4453
01:54:02,931 --> 01:54:04,490
They're just trying to
go from town to town.

4454
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:05,031
Dude,

4455
01:54:05,031 --> 01:54:05,840
I don't want them to take it.

4456
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:06,680
I don't want to fuck it up,

4457
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:10,480
but it's based on real sieges that
they did when they patent was oil.

4458
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:12,380
Harris history attacked England.

4459
01:54:12,381 --> 01:54:15,110
They went and they attacked west six
they killed a fuck load of people.

4460
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:18,680
They showed up on boats and just jumped
out with axes and just start fucking up

4461
01:54:18,681 --> 01:54:19,514
villages.

4462
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:19,901
It's,

4463
01:54:19,901 --> 01:54:21,540
it's based on that Barrick shit,

4464
01:54:21,650 --> 01:54:23,330
but it's really well done,

4465
01:54:23,331 --> 01:54:23,690
man.

4466
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:24,080
I,

4467
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:24,290
you know,

4468
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:25,220
I was skeptical.

4469
01:54:25,221 --> 01:54:27,080
I never heard anything about
it and someone was saying,

4470
01:54:27,081 --> 01:54:28,520
you got to watch Netflix.

4471
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:29,060
Hulu.

4472
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:29,391
No,

4473
01:54:29,391 --> 01:54:30,350
I got it on an apple.

4474
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:31,450
It's probably on Netflix.

4475
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:32,720
It's a history channel.

4476
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:33,950
It was a history channel show.

4477
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:35,930
I just subscribed to it on iTunes.

4478
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:37,640
I got a that apple,

4479
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:38,060
what is it?

4480
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:38,691
I home.

4481
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:39,650
What does that shit called?

4482
01:54:39,651 --> 01:54:40,430
Apple TV.

4483
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:40,850
Yeah,

4484
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:42,020
I heard frontiers good too.

4485
01:54:42,021 --> 01:54:44,570
It's about the fur trading
business with your boy.

4486
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:46,940
The Jason Momoa heard.

4487
01:54:46,941 --> 01:54:47,630
It's really good to,

4488
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:48,440
hmm.

4489
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:49,273
Interesting.

4490
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:50,443
I don't watch any of them

4491
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:52,221
Viking,

4492
01:54:52,221 --> 01:54:53,420
so I'm hooked.

4493
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:54,651
I'm hooked.

4494
01:54:54,651 --> 01:54:55,760
I just finished season three.

4495
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:56,840
Damn your ass.

4496
01:54:56,840 --> 01:54:57,860
It's fucking good,

4497
01:54:57,861 --> 01:54:58,610
man.

4498
01:54:58,610 --> 01:54:59,600
It's a good show.

4499
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:01,580
It's one of those
underrated shows you like.

4500
01:55:01,581 --> 01:55:02,870
How do I not know about this one?

4501
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:03,971
I've heard about it.

4502
01:55:03,971 --> 01:55:04,940
I'm just not vikings.

4503
01:55:04,941 --> 01:55:05,774
They're like,

4504
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:06,531
yeah,

4505
01:55:06,531 --> 01:55:07,220
you do like that.

4506
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:07,881
I love that shit.

4507
01:55:07,881 --> 01:55:08,930
I watch teen mom does.

4508
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:10,970
Did you guys watch wild,

4509
01:55:10,971 --> 01:55:11,804
wild country?

4510
01:55:12,910 --> 01:55:13,743
I'm scared.

4511
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:15,830
[inaudible] wild country.

4512
01:55:15,831 --> 01:55:18,980
It's a dock you a series.

4513
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:20,331
It's on that guy.

4514
01:55:20,331 --> 01:55:21,590
The the sex cult guy,

4515
01:55:21,591 --> 01:55:22,424
right?

4516
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:22,850
Yeah.

4517
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:24,830
It's more of a like an Indian dude.

4518
01:55:24,831 --> 01:55:25,050
His,

4519
01:55:25,050 --> 01:55:25,940
his name is,

4520
01:55:25,941 --> 01:55:26,774
um,

4521
01:55:27,650 --> 01:55:28,700
he has like three different names,

4522
01:55:28,701 --> 01:55:29,720
but his,

4523
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:32,630
his religion was half Buddhists,

4524
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:35,290
half a capitalist.

4525
01:55:35,330 --> 01:55:36,163
Like I'm in,

4526
01:55:36,490 --> 01:55:37,323
like

4527
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:40,070
I'm in the spirit.

4528
01:55:40,071 --> 01:55:41,120
You can be spiritual,

4529
01:55:41,121 --> 01:55:42,820
but you want to add luxury too?

4530
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:43,590
Yes.

4531
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:43,771
Yeah,

4532
01:55:43,771 --> 01:55:44,040
he could

4533
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:44,430
do both.

4534
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:45,990
I'm in jail son.

4535
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:46,590
And he said,

4536
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:47,250
he says,

4537
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:48,780
I believe in luxury.

4538
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:51,420
I believe we all should live in luxury,

4539
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:53,370
but if you can't live in luxury,

4540
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:55,530
I'm going to live in luxury myself.

4541
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:58,290
Is he a bad guy?

4542
01:55:58,291 --> 01:55:59,124
That guy right there.

4543
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:00,593
Oh yeah.

4544
01:56:00,610 --> 01:56:02,810
He's super pimped out all these roles.

4545
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:04,140
Make sure built.

4546
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:06,090
So what happens is they
get kicked out of India,

4547
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:09,990
so he has all these rich followers
and they built a city in Oregon,

4548
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:12,270
that coalition in the middle of nowhere.

4549
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:15,330
They built this gigantic
city in Oregon in the 80s.

4550
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:19,290
And all these people from all over
the world ended up moving there.

4551
01:56:19,291 --> 01:56:22,890
And the surrounding towns are
just like old white people.

4552
01:56:23,190 --> 01:56:23,551
They,

4553
01:56:23,551 --> 01:56:23,701
uh,

4554
01:56:23,701 --> 01:56:25,560
they go to war and a,

4555
01:56:25,561 --> 01:56:26,730
that's what the documentary is about.

4556
01:56:26,731 --> 01:56:27,690
It's pretty awesome.

4557
01:56:27,810 --> 01:56:28,740
It's an awesome,

4558
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,660
what was he having sex
with everyone or what man,

4559
01:56:31,890 --> 01:56:32,820
it's not about that.

4560
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:37,590
It's about him starting a new city with
that got tens of thousands of people in

4561
01:56:37,591 --> 01:56:40,800
the middle of Oregon and they got all
these old white people out there going,

4562
01:56:40,801 --> 01:56:42,240
what the fuck is going on?

4563
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:44,040
So it wasn't about a sex cult.

4564
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:45,140
They,

4565
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:45,390
you know,

4566
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:47,370
they believed in free
sex and all that stuff,

4567
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:48,940
but it wasn't,

4568
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:52,690
doesn't it's the cold leads
just focusing on that,

4569
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:53,940
that it's more about,

4570
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:57,860
they had to find out a culture.

4571
01:56:57,990 --> 01:57:01,950
They had the finances to literally
build a high level city in the middle of

4572
01:57:01,951 --> 01:57:02,610
nowhere.

4573
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:04,230
And when did this all go down?

4574
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:05,303
In the 80s.

4575
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:05,640
Okay.

4576
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:06,473
I'm going to watch it.

4577
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:07,460
I'm going to watch it.

4578
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:08,293
Uh,

4579
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,110
I can't watch it this weekend.

4580
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:11,610
It's really good.

4581
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:13,080
It's really good,

4582
01:57:13,081 --> 01:57:13,560
man.

4583
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:14,730
You won't regret that one.

4584
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:15,593
Okay.

4585
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:17,093
Yeah.

4586
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:17,860
Beautiful.

4587
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:20,960
The cult leaders always charismatic and
they're always trying to fuck everyone.

4588
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:22,150
Wild.

4589
01:57:22,150 --> 01:57:22,983
Did you start a cult?

4590
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:23,870
Why else?

4591
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:24,390
Why else?

4592
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:24,550
Well,

4593
01:57:24,550 --> 01:57:26,330
you just want everybody just listen to,

4594
01:57:26,331 --> 01:57:27,164
you know,

4595
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:30,710
and then you want the poster correct.

4596
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:31,490
Come on.

4597
01:57:31,490 --> 01:57:32,323
Every time.

4598
01:57:32,450 --> 01:57:36,110
Called the personality and the type of
person that would want to have all those

4599
01:57:36,111 --> 01:57:36,800
people.

4600
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,180
Ladies and gentleman,

4601
01:57:38,181 --> 01:57:39,800
we're going to move to Oregon.

4602
01:57:39,801 --> 01:57:40,730
We found a spot.

4603
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:41,091
Yes,

4604
01:57:41,091 --> 01:57:41,721
exactly.

4605
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:42,770
That's exactly what it was.

4606
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,900
Went to white people
from all over the world,

4607
01:57:44,901 --> 01:57:45,710
but they were rich.

4608
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:48,350
I know someone whose family
was involved in that.

4609
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:48,890
Oh yeah.

4610
01:57:48,890 --> 01:57:49,723
Yeah.

4611
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:52,070
Get the sake of things about it.

4612
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:55,130
It's interesting to see how it
all comes crashing down though.

4613
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:55,590
That's,

4614
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:58,460
that's the interesting part is like
how does it come crashing down?

4615
01:57:58,461 --> 01:57:58,950
Because it's,

4616
01:57:58,950 --> 01:57:59,783
it doesn't exist.

4617
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:00,520
I don't know.

4618
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,180
Mine's a friend of mines,

4619
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:05,210
ex girlfriend from like 20 plus years ago.

4620
01:58:05,211 --> 01:58:08,060
She grew up in that
and that one in Oregon.

4621
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:09,230
She think it's that one.

4622
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:10,640
I'm pretty sure it's that one.

4623
01:58:10,641 --> 01:58:12,440
She was afraid I'd have to ask him.

4624
01:58:13,310 --> 01:58:14,390
I don't know how I'd bring that up.

4625
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:15,921
Really.

4626
01:58:15,921 --> 01:58:16,754
Can't just text him.

4627
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:17,361
Hey Bro,

4628
01:58:17,361 --> 01:58:18,440
watching this dog.

4629
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,240
Was it your old girlfriends?

4630
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:24,653
Yeah.

4631
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:25,781
Imagine that,

4632
01:58:25,781 --> 01:58:26,020
man.

4633
01:58:26,020 --> 01:58:29,980
Imagine like you being in one of them
called and like being like 10 years old

4634
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:31,210
and I'm like looking around going,

4635
01:58:31,690 --> 01:58:32,920
what is going on?

4636
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:33,240
If,

4637
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:36,310
why is the Maharaja keep fucking my mom?

4638
01:58:36,311 --> 01:58:37,360
Like what's happening here?

4639
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:38,590
You're not going to grow up normal.

4640
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:39,170
Yeah.

4641
01:58:39,170 --> 01:58:40,330
You can be pretty damaged.

4642
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:40,990
Um,

4643
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:41,561
mom,

4644
01:58:41,561 --> 01:58:42,280
what are you doing?

4645
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:43,050
Well,

4646
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:47,230
the sacred one brings to me blessing on
duty at all these rolls Royces in the

4647
01:58:47,231 --> 01:58:48,640
middle of eastern Oregon.

4648
01:58:48,641 --> 01:58:48,790
Yeah.

4649
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:53,790
He would just why multiple like
endless rolls Royces fallen.

4650
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:55,420
I believe in luxury.

4651
01:58:56,980 --> 01:59:00,370
The line is if I can't manage to
make everybody live in luxury,

4652
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:03,730
at least I can manage to
live in luxury myself.

4653
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:06,490
Just for Shit didn't,

4654
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:07,324
um,

4655
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:09,970
didn't fucking r Kelly
get in trouble recently.

4656
01:59:09,971 --> 01:59:10,990
They think he's running a call.

4657
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:13,030
He has kind of,

4658
01:59:13,031 --> 01:59:14,140
he has to be a sex slave.

4659
01:59:14,141 --> 01:59:15,550
So he has won the house.

4660
01:59:15,551 --> 01:59:18,370
Kind of what he does is he has,

4661
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,020
he has one house where he
stays and he is a next door.

4662
01:59:21,021 --> 01:59:21,880
He bought the house.

4663
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:23,710
He's a bunch of flock a bitches in there.

4664
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:25,720
And so the parents of those kids are like,

4665
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,160
he's holding them hostage.

4666
01:59:27,370 --> 01:59:28,360
There's sex slaves.

4667
01:59:28,570 --> 01:59:30,880
These taken away their
confidence when really it's just,

4668
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:31,330
you know,

4669
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:31,780
pimp it.

4670
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:31,921
Yeah.

4671
01:59:31,921 --> 01:59:32,170
He's,

4672
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:32,891
he's pimping,

4673
01:59:32,891 --> 01:59:33,341
pimping,

4674
01:59:33,341 --> 01:59:35,410
pimping r Kelly.

4675
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:39,100
Part of his inner circle resign amid sex.

4676
01:59:39,101 --> 01:59:42,100
Pet allegations does this
today and heard about the pets.

4677
01:59:42,230 --> 01:59:42,851
It was last week.

4678
01:59:42,851 --> 01:59:47,680
This is what we saw Tony about to hope
high profile women have resigned their

4679
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:52,150
roles after new revelations emerged
and a BBC three documentary.

4680
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:53,291
Oh,

4681
01:59:53,291 --> 01:59:54,124
that's what we're talking about.

4682
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:55,870
Some girl from a small vil.

4683
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:57,220
Did you hear about that?

4684
01:59:57,610 --> 01:59:58,510
Fuck is going on.

4685
01:59:59,370 --> 02:00:01,630
What in the fuck?

4686
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:04,510
Like she's trying to recruit
actresses to be in the sex cult.

4687
02:00:04,830 --> 02:00:05,680
When did she,

4688
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:07,121
when did she do,

4689
02:00:07,121 --> 02:00:08,170
is this from the past?

4690
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,870
I don't know that the last few
years from the past a little bit,

4691
02:00:10,871 --> 02:00:13,060
but also I think it's just she got up,

4692
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:18,370
she was trying to get Emma Watson
to take join or something like that.

4693
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:19,000
I don't know.

4694
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,920
This is just stuff that's
coming on the mainstream medium.

4695
02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:22,030
Maybe it's all bullshit.

4696
02:00:22,030 --> 02:00:22,590
I Dunno.

4697
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:23,860
Well she's got to prison though.

4698
02:00:23,861 --> 02:00:24,430
Yeah.

4699
02:00:24,430 --> 02:00:25,630
Why would she do that?

4700
02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:26,650
And they would,

4701
02:00:26,650 --> 02:00:27,190
they would have,

4702
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:27,701
they would have,

4703
02:00:27,701 --> 02:00:28,534
uh,

4704
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:29,321
they had,

4705
02:00:29,321 --> 02:00:29,650
um,

4706
02:00:29,650 --> 02:00:30,431
they would have parties.

4707
02:00:30,431 --> 02:00:30,750
This,

4708
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:31,000
this,

4709
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,260
this thing that she was involved in
at adapt Richard Branson's island.

4710
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:35,831
Look at this.

4711
02:00:35,831 --> 02:00:40,630
It says she's accused of being a
leader in a pile for a sorority.

4712
02:00:40,631 --> 02:00:41,380
Ask Right?

4713
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:46,380
Young women who were manipulated into
serving as slaves for male masters.

4714
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:52,090
She's facing 15 years to life imprisonment
on the charge of sex trafficking,

4715
02:00:52,091 --> 02:00:55,990
conspiracy and conspiracy
to commit forced labor.

4716
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:56,471
Okay.

4717
02:00:56,471 --> 02:00:57,730
Now let me ask you this.

4718
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:01,000
If you run into a bunch of girls,

4719
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:05,650
say you're this girl and your
thing is like being in a,

4720
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:09,910
a cult with one master who gets
to fuck all these women whose,

4721
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:13,330
whose to say that you shouldn't
be into that if you're her,

4722
02:01:13,390 --> 02:01:13,631
right?

4723
02:01:13,631 --> 02:01:14,110
You know,

4724
02:01:14,110 --> 02:01:18,700
and now who's to say if she goes and
talks to a bunch of other girls and talks

4725
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:21,550
them into having sex with this guy,

4726
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:23,350
why is that bad?

4727
02:01:23,470 --> 02:01:24,460
That's what I'm saying.

4728
02:01:24,490 --> 02:01:27,040
We should get what you
want your daughter to do.

4729
02:01:27,070 --> 02:01:28,930
It's not what you want your sister to do.

4730
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:34,200
But we all know people that like getting
tied up 100% we know people that like,

4731
02:01:34,930 --> 02:01:38,170
like smacking each other and like
being sent shit and like being,

4732
02:01:38,410 --> 02:01:39,500
well not really,

4733
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:40,340
maybe slaves,

4734
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,210
but whatever.

4735
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:42,350
People like Kinky Shit.

4736
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:43,041
Let's just say that,

4737
02:01:43,041 --> 02:01:43,281
right?

4738
02:01:43,281 --> 02:01:44,300
They like Kinky Shit.

4739
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,450
Why is it that we can decide
that that's too kinky?

4740
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:50,660
Because is she bringing those girls there
and then they're keeping them right?

4741
02:01:50,661 --> 02:01:51,321
That's the question.

4742
02:01:51,321 --> 02:01:51,951
If that's the case,

4743
02:01:51,951 --> 02:01:54,880
of course it says forced labor labor,

4744
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:55,221
right?

4745
02:01:55,221 --> 02:01:56,011
If you scroll right,

4746
02:01:56,011 --> 02:01:58,880
but if you turn someone into
your slave and you said slave,

4747
02:01:58,881 --> 02:02:00,140
you're going to clean my kitchen.

4748
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:01,071
And they're like,

4749
02:02:01,071 --> 02:02:01,341
yes,

4750
02:02:01,341 --> 02:02:01,761
master.

4751
02:02:01,761 --> 02:02:03,830
And it's like part of some
weird kinky shit you do.

4752
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:07,340
And then after they cleaned your
kitchen then then you mouth fuck them.

4753
02:02:07,450 --> 02:02:07,750
Yeah.

4754
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:09,800
Like if you just decided
like you have some words,

4755
02:02:09,970 --> 02:02:14,970
she have some weird weird like
that and some people like it,

4756
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:16,760
some people like weird shit.

4757
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:21,320
And then there's some people that get
talked into joining a cult and they get

4758
02:02:21,321 --> 02:02:23,180
talked into these horrible situations.

4759
02:02:23,180 --> 02:02:24,650
They actually do become sex slaves.

4760
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:26,270
So how do you know which is which?

4761
02:02:26,390 --> 02:02:31,390
How do you know like which is a consenting
of age adult who really loves being a

4762
02:02:31,941 --> 02:02:33,650
part of some super kinky shit.

4763
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:34,190
I know.

4764
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:39,190
Versus someone who's coerced into
joining a sex cult and who is like held

4765
02:02:39,801 --> 02:02:40,700
against their will.

4766
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:41,750
Like there's a line there,

4767
02:02:41,751 --> 02:02:42,230
right?

4768
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:45,890
Like they seem kind of similar from
the outside but there is a line,

4769
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:46,041
right.

4770
02:02:46,041 --> 02:02:48,080
I don't know what the fuck
happened in this situation.

4771
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:49,280
I literally don't know anything.

4772
02:02:49,281 --> 02:02:50,114
I do know,

4773
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:51,560
I know what happens.

4774
02:02:51,561 --> 02:02:55,220
So she would get these girls and then
the shoot dude get them naked and she

4775
02:02:55,221 --> 02:02:57,390
would take pictures and hold
it as a brand somewhere.

4776
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:59,930
Like if they didn't fuck the leader.

4777
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:00,940
Oh,

4778
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:01,220
okay.

4779
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:02,180
Well that got dark.

4780
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:02,330
Uh,

4781
02:03:02,330 --> 02:03:02,871
just hit me.

4782
02:03:02,871 --> 02:03:03,591
I remember that.

4783
02:03:03,591 --> 02:03:04,520
That's why she's fucked.

4784
02:03:04,530 --> 02:03:05,211
Okay,

4785
02:03:05,211 --> 02:03:05,600
good.

4786
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,050
No,

4787
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:06,883
but,

4788
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:10,130
but it would be interesting we're
talking about that other guy with all the

4789
02:03:10,131 --> 02:03:11,180
money in the Oregon.

4790
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:12,830
Like if someone did that today,

4791
02:03:12,831 --> 02:03:14,360
like some are Kelly type guy.

4792
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:16,640
I'm not saying our Kelly's a good guy.

4793
02:03:16,641 --> 02:03:18,140
I'm not saying what he's doing is legal.

4794
02:03:18,141 --> 02:03:21,140
But what I am saying is it is possible.

4795
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:23,360
I don't think this is the
case in this situation,

4796
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:28,480
but just as a what if it is possible
that you get together with a bunch of

4797
02:03:29,961 --> 02:03:34,961
people who are really ended
that slave dominatrix type deal.

4798
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:39,710
Like some people are really
into being dominatrices.

4799
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:43,980
Some people are really into
being submissive and they
get together like with it,

4800
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:44,960
as long as it's men and women,

4801
02:03:44,961 --> 02:03:45,800
we don't have a problem with it.

4802
02:03:45,801 --> 02:03:46,350
Right?

4803
02:03:46,350 --> 02:03:50,960
Like if as long as it's some guys like a
CEO that hire some mistress to kick him

4804
02:03:50,961 --> 02:03:53,540
in the balls and stomp on
them and do it happens.

4805
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:54,710
If we were totally cool with that,

4806
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:55,730
people survive that.

4807
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:57,081
That's a good question.

4808
02:03:57,081 --> 02:03:57,914
Just take the pain.

4809
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:02,060
Some people like getting kicked in the
balls and need in a bones like repeatedly

4810
02:04:02,070 --> 02:04:03,350
and it's hard as you can.

4811
02:04:03,410 --> 02:04:06,860
I know they used to come into the club
and I used to work at and girls used to

4812
02:04:06,861 --> 02:04:09,510
get paid to knees in the lap dance.

4813
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:11,720
They would just need the
shit out of their bubble.

4814
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:14,180
I don't get it.

4815
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:15,500
Maybe that pain,

4816
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:17,390
that feels like death to most people.

4817
02:04:17,391 --> 02:04:19,340
It feels different to other people that,

4818
02:04:19,341 --> 02:04:19,750
that,

4819
02:04:19,750 --> 02:04:23,180
that that's like a rush can imagine if
that when you get hit in the balls into

4820
02:04:23,181 --> 02:04:24,470
that intense pain.

4821
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:25,790
It's like a saying,

4822
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:27,950
it's not like nothing else like stomach.

4823
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:28,221
Yeah.

4824
02:04:28,221 --> 02:04:29,150
It's a unique pain.

4825
02:04:29,330 --> 02:04:33,030
But there might be people that take that
unique pain and turn it into like just

4826
02:04:33,031 --> 02:04:34,130
this high for you.

4827
02:04:34,230 --> 02:04:34,670
Yeah,

4828
02:04:34,670 --> 02:04:35,503
you're right.

4829
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:37,980
It'd be a real why psychos people

4830
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:41,040
that are into it Pumpkin to
watch that shit on Youtube.

4831
02:04:42,990 --> 02:04:43,920
Frank had a good point.

4832
02:04:43,921 --> 02:04:47,340
We came to fade or the time that is his
losses and we come to the states saying

4833
02:04:47,370 --> 02:04:48,750
how he never trains in a cage.

4834
02:04:49,230 --> 02:04:50,063
It's true.

4835
02:04:50,210 --> 02:04:50,460
Yeah.

4836
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:54,850
It was the cage a factor in any of his
losses because two of them relative to

4837
02:04:55,450 --> 02:04:55,770
how,

4838
02:04:55,770 --> 02:04:58,860
what happened the do with fight Henderson,

4839
02:04:58,861 --> 02:04:59,760
he couldn't get out of the way.

4840
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:01,171
The Henderson fight.

4841
02:05:01,171 --> 02:05:04,050
You couldn't get out of the
way in the Purdue fights maybe,

4842
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:09,470
but Henderson fight Reese control
the ring ring is more fluid thing.

4843
02:05:10,110 --> 02:05:10,591
That's right.

4844
02:05:10,591 --> 02:05:11,161
The Henderson fight,

4845
02:05:11,161 --> 02:05:13,330
he hadn't been so I control
and Henderson and uh,

4846
02:05:13,331 --> 02:05:15,570
under them popped out with the under hook.

4847
02:05:15,571 --> 02:05:16,770
He wasn't careful with that.

4848
02:05:16,830 --> 02:05:17,551
With the under hook,

4849
02:05:17,551 --> 02:05:18,690
he had them side control.

4850
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:21,390
If you don't have that under hook and the
guy on the bottom shoots the under can

4851
02:05:21,391 --> 02:05:22,150
get the dog fight.

4852
02:05:22,150 --> 02:05:23,550
It's true from side control.

4853
02:05:23,551 --> 02:05:25,200
You don't even need
quarter Gardner half car.

4854
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:27,810
But if I'm fade or that's like a
tennis player only playing on grass.

4855
02:05:27,811 --> 02:05:29,910
So he's going to play on
clay with the fuck you dude.

4856
02:05:29,911 --> 02:05:30,770
What the fuck is going on?

4857
02:05:30,771 --> 02:05:34,620
18 can you not find the goddamn kitchen
rush was times where he didn't want to

4858
02:05:34,621 --> 02:05:35,454
fight anymore.

4859
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:36,510
So the question is,

4860
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:38,310
is he fighting now because of money?

4861
02:05:38,610 --> 02:05:41,820
Is he fighting now because he doesn't
know what else to do or is he fighting now

4862
02:05:41,821 --> 02:05:46,821
because he's got to reignited feeling
about competition and he likes it again to

4863
02:05:47,071 --> 02:05:48,720
go work security for Putin.

4864
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:49,770
Get paid bro.

4865
02:05:49,950 --> 02:05:51,050
They're bull shit.

4866
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:52,610
That's a good call.

4867
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:53,623
Good call.

4868
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:54,960
He's your right hand man.

4869
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:57,450
He's gonna fuck with
freight or rush doors there.

4870
02:05:57,451 --> 02:05:58,200
Yeah,

4871
02:05:58,200 --> 02:05:59,100
I mean that would be,

4872
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:00,421
I mean,

4873
02:06:00,421 --> 02:06:02,280
he's got to be a hero and rock dude.

4874
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:06,240
Did you think of it going
on or in war with Russia?

4875
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:08,570
Syria strikes.

4876
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:10,430
No thoughts for a second.

4877
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:13,850
I didn't think were going to war
with everybody thought I'm scared.

4878
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:15,300
Anytime bombs dropped though.

4879
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,553
Anytime bombs,

4880
02:06:17,030 --> 02:06:19,740
you're opening up the possibility
of bombs dropping back.

4881
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:20,843
It's just like,

4882
02:06:21,090 --> 02:06:21,421
you know,

4883
02:06:21,421 --> 02:06:21,721
I mean,

4884
02:06:21,721 --> 02:06:23,370
even if what happened,

4885
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:26,370
what did the people on the other side
of the dropping the bombs on deserve it?

4886
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:27,061
It's still like,

4887
02:06:27,061 --> 02:06:27,960
Holy Shit,

4888
02:06:27,961 --> 02:06:28,794
we're in a fight.

4889
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:30,540
You know anytime that happens,

4890
02:06:30,541 --> 02:06:34,080
if you're not legitimately concerned
that horrible things come out of it,

4891
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:36,720
but the idea of us going
to war with Russia,

4892
02:06:36,721 --> 02:06:37,260
I'm like,

4893
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:38,160
probably not.

4894
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:39,653
Fuck man,

4895
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:40,530
I just crazy.

4896
02:06:40,590 --> 02:06:41,760
I was in New York for that.

4897
02:06:41,761 --> 02:06:42,090
I got to,

4898
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:42,923
Holy Shit.

4899
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:45,600
I don't know what is going on
when it comes to foreign policy.

4900
02:06:45,601 --> 02:06:48,180
I would be a joke if I pretended,

4901
02:06:48,181 --> 02:06:49,530
which I have many times in my life.

4902
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:51,841
You don't know.

4903
02:06:51,841 --> 02:06:52,021
I mean,

4904
02:06:52,021 --> 02:06:55,050
who the fuck knows what's happening
with Russia or with China?

4905
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:56,920
I've been talking about this a while,

4906
02:06:56,921 --> 02:06:57,840
way thing.

4907
02:06:58,370 --> 02:06:59,140
Um,

4908
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:04,140
Huawei is a big time cell phone or
electronics company in Japan or in China

4909
02:07:04,351 --> 02:07:05,130
rather.

4910
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:05,760
And uh,

4911
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:10,470
the State Department has
recently recommended you
don't buy Walway products and

4912
02:07:10,471 --> 02:07:13,800
that they might be a
bad actors and you know,

4913
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,180
spying on the people that own their phone.

4914
02:07:16,181 --> 02:07:16,600
So they,

4915
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:21,600
they canceled deal with Huawei to be
an 18 t and Verizon and all these other

4916
02:07:21,930 --> 02:07:22,763
cell phones,

4917
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:24,293
you know,

4918
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:26,400
providers here in the
United States and they,

4919
02:07:26,401 --> 02:07:26,551
there,

4920
02:07:26,551 --> 02:07:28,140
they literally issued a warning.

4921
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:29,131
I was like,

4922
02:07:29,131 --> 02:07:30,480
I've never heard of that before.

4923
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:32,340
And then there was something about,

4924
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:33,233
um,

4925
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:34,980
some sort of hacking that they,

4926
02:07:35,290 --> 02:07:35,771
they did,

4927
02:07:35,771 --> 02:07:38,560
they're going to take them to
court prosecuting for something.

4928
02:07:38,561 --> 02:07:39,520
They deal with Iran.

4929
02:07:39,730 --> 02:07:40,660
This is another thing about it,

4930
02:07:40,661 --> 02:07:44,110
but then I've heard people online say
that they're suspicious that what this is,

4931
02:07:44,111 --> 02:07:49,111
is trying to squash China from entering
into the electronics market is like the

4932
02:07:49,151 --> 02:07:51,700
top three people in cell phones are apple,

4933
02:07:51,701 --> 02:07:52,534
Samsung,

4934
02:07:52,630 --> 02:07:54,820
and Huawei is number three worldwide.

4935
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:56,290
That's a thing to stop.

4936
02:07:56,300 --> 02:08:00,310
Wowway in America would
be like an economic thing
because they're worried about

4937
02:08:00,311 --> 02:08:02,650
China increasing the
amount of money they have.

4938
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:03,903
Who can they believe?

4939
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:08,740
But you know it's hard if
you're interested in following
Q a on a lot of people

4940
02:08:08,741 --> 02:08:09,640
analyzes drops,

4941
02:08:09,641 --> 02:08:12,340
but there's a youtube
channel called just informed,

4942
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:13,863
uh,

4943
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:15,061
Justin form.

4944
02:08:15,061 --> 02:08:15,970
Something just informed,

4945
02:08:15,971 --> 02:08:17,320
but he breaks it down every day.

4946
02:08:17,380 --> 02:08:18,610
He talks about all that stuff.

4947
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:22,990
So it's all interesting because you got
to know that if Justin for coming to me

4948
02:08:22,991 --> 02:08:23,920
is that big.

4949
02:08:23,921 --> 02:08:25,030
And here's the thing that the,

4950
02:08:25,031 --> 02:08:28,630
the super dorks like Jamie and I've been
going back and forth about this because

4951
02:08:28,631 --> 02:08:29,920
the super dorks online,

4952
02:08:29,921 --> 02:08:33,100
I say that with all due respect to
dudes are really understand cell phones.

4953
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:35,290
They're calling bullshit
because they're like,

4954
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:36,610
if they were spying on you,

4955
02:08:36,611 --> 02:08:39,310
these guys who develop
apps and understand phones,

4956
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:39,701
these,

4957
02:08:39,701 --> 02:08:41,990
these like super type dudes,

4958
02:08:42,170 --> 02:08:43,390
they'd be able to find the code.

4959
02:08:43,690 --> 02:08:44,111
They'd be like,

4960
02:08:44,111 --> 02:08:44,231
Yo,

4961
02:08:44,231 --> 02:08:44,740
this shit,

4962
02:08:44,740 --> 02:08:46,000
this shit spying on you.

4963
02:08:46,001 --> 02:08:46,720
It's listening to you.

4964
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:46,990
Here's,

4965
02:08:46,990 --> 02:08:47,741
here's what the code,

4966
02:08:47,741 --> 02:08:48,574
this is what it's doing.

4967
02:08:48,700 --> 02:08:53,620
Microphones set to one set of design
is as good as the Russian hackers are.

4968
02:08:53,621 --> 02:08:55,780
Wherever in the world
the best aren't America.

4969
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:56,711
Whatever they can do,

4970
02:08:56,711 --> 02:08:58,300
we can fuck best everything.

4971
02:08:58,430 --> 02:08:58,581
Right.

4972
02:08:58,581 --> 02:09:00,760
So that's why I was or
what the fuck it is.

4973
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:02,650
We're best at suck America.

4974
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:05,290
Drop a bomb eaten steak,

4975
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:08,210
American drag and bear frag mayor.

4976
02:09:08,230 --> 02:09:09,063
Well it's got to go

4977
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:15,630
get in the book but just informed talk
is the youtube channel than breaks down

4978
02:09:17,231 --> 02:09:18,520
Killeen on if you are interested.

4979
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:19,301
It's really good.

4980
02:09:19,301 --> 02:09:21,220
It's very interesting
predictions whether this fight,

4981
02:09:21,290 --> 02:09:22,210
that's a good question.

4982
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:22,990
Um,

4983
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:23,823
man,

4984
02:09:24,810 --> 02:09:25,240
um,

4985
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:28,000
I think they're both at very
similar places in their career,

4986
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:30,130
which is one of the reasons
why this fight is interesting,

4987
02:09:30,210 --> 02:09:30,390
frank.

4988
02:09:30,390 --> 02:09:31,450
It's been up for a hot minute.

4989
02:09:31,570 --> 02:09:34,070
Sometimes when you get in
there and you fed lung left,

4990
02:09:34,071 --> 02:09:35,770
just say fucking throw
caution to the wind.

4991
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:37,240
So it could be super quick.

4992
02:09:37,270 --> 02:09:39,250
Why did frank get released from UFC?

4993
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:40,840
What happened?

4994
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:41,673
Do we know?

4995
02:09:42,190 --> 02:09:44,470
Didn't he do some tests positive?

4996
02:09:44,530 --> 02:09:45,191
He tests positive.

4997
02:09:45,191 --> 02:09:46,024
His last one,

4998
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:47,200
how long ago was that?

4999
02:09:47,290 --> 02:09:48,101
That was a while ago.

5000
02:09:48,101 --> 02:09:49,640
He's been off for.

5001
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:53,110
He got compensated as a common state.

5002
02:09:53,130 --> 02:09:54,400
Wanted to kill Brock Lesnar.

5003
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:55,473
Literally Kill Them.

5004
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:56,290
Yes.

5005
02:09:56,290 --> 02:09:57,123
Fair enough.

5006
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:58,850
He was a really good commentary,

5007
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:00,220
great commentator who was really good.

5008
02:10:00,221 --> 02:10:01,600
It's compensating now for ACB.

5009
02:10:02,740 --> 02:10:03,970
What's ACB like that?

5010
02:10:04,010 --> 02:10:04,990
That Russian league.

5011
02:10:05,170 --> 02:10:05,560
Oh,

5012
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:05,950
okay.

5013
02:10:05,950 --> 02:10:06,071
Yeah.

5014
02:10:06,071 --> 02:10:06,461
He's the head.

5015
02:10:06,461 --> 02:10:07,150
Come to NBC.

5016
02:10:07,150 --> 02:10:07,983
Be Interesting.

5017
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:09,130
Interesting.

5018
02:10:09,130 --> 02:10:10,520
But we went to Frank's last fight.

5019
02:10:10,521 --> 02:10:13,180
He got knocked up by
Mark Hunt and then he,

5020
02:10:13,181 --> 02:10:14,050
they let him go.

5021
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:16,960
I remember when he knocked
out Todd Duffy though.

5022
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:18,550
Oh whoa.

5023
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:19,480
That was crazy.

5024
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:19,781
Great.

5025
02:10:19,781 --> 02:10:24,370
Great near still showed in that fight
that against a dangerous guy like Duffy

5026
02:10:24,370 --> 02:10:25,910
Frank's fall in love with his box and man,

5027
02:10:25,911 --> 02:10:26,860
I hate hearing that.

5028
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:27,941
Well,

5029
02:10:27,941 --> 02:10:28,271
I mean,

5030
02:10:28,271 --> 02:10:29,560
he's a smart dude.

5031
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:30,490
If you,

5032
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:33,590
if you got to think his
Jujitsu is on point.

5033
02:10:33,591 --> 02:10:34,610
He's so smart.

5034
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:36,020
He's very smart.

5035
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:36,891
Very well read.

5036
02:10:36,891 --> 02:10:37,850
Him and Josh Barnett,

5037
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:40,190
I think are the two smartest
heavyweights that I've ever met.

5038
02:10:40,370 --> 02:10:41,270
It's a good call.

5039
02:10:41,690 --> 02:10:42,410
Josh Barnett.

5040
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:43,041
Very smart.

5041
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:43,820
Very cerebral.

5042
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:44,121
How's it?

5043
02:10:44,121 --> 02:10:44,954
Good fight.

5044
02:10:45,110 --> 02:10:45,890
Yup.

5045
02:10:45,890 --> 02:10:46,840
Josh Barnett Mirror.

5046
02:10:47,110 --> 02:10:47,943
Oh,

5047
02:10:48,150 --> 02:10:49,240
I'm a Josh Barnett.

5048
02:10:49,241 --> 02:10:49,430
Had it,

5049
02:10:49,430 --> 02:10:50,330
had him against the fence.

5050
02:10:50,331 --> 02:10:53,210
He was had great head position and forum.

5051
02:10:53,230 --> 02:10:54,160
Josh Schwab is out.

5052
02:10:54,161 --> 02:10:55,460
Oh yeah,

5053
02:10:55,490 --> 02:10:56,270
that's right.

5054
02:10:56,270 --> 02:10:57,440
It's a great fight for you Josh.

5055
02:10:57,441 --> 02:10:58,370
But yeah,

5056
02:10:58,371 --> 02:10:59,204
that's what I'm saying.

5057
02:11:01,170 --> 02:11:02,570
Just overall it was a five rounder,

5058
02:11:02,571 --> 02:11:03,290
wasn't it?

5059
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:04,190
I believe it was fine.

5060
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:05,293
Ended pretty quick.

5061
02:11:05,670 --> 02:11:06,260
Josh whooped.

5062
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:06,540
Is that,

5063
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:06,891
oh no,

5064
02:11:06,891 --> 02:11:07,041
no,

5065
02:11:07,041 --> 02:11:07,221
no.

5066
02:11:07,221 --> 02:11:10,190
I'm thinking of another top speed is Josh
beat his ass and knocked him out with

5067
02:11:10,191 --> 02:11:10,551
a neat,

5068
02:11:10,551 --> 02:11:10,920
right.

5069
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:12,680
Josh fucked him up and fucked him up.

5070
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:17,180
I'm thinking of another fight
where Josh went five hard rounds.

5071
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:19,670
Was it against DC when unbroken ahead?

5072
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:19,981
No,

5073
02:11:19,981 --> 02:11:20,091
no,

5074
02:11:20,091 --> 02:11:20,271
no.

5075
02:11:20,271 --> 02:11:22,850
He beat somebody in a
very impressive fight.

5076
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:23,713
Oh,

5077
02:11:24,380 --> 02:11:25,940
it was Roy was big country.

5078
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:26,811
Oh yeah.

5079
02:11:26,811 --> 02:11:27,644
He took him down.

5080
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:28,401
But he kept,

5081
02:11:28,401 --> 02:11:29,270
he kept taking down.

5082
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:29,870
Yeah.

5083
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:30,410
That was it.

5084
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:31,690
That was a long shit out of Roy.

5085
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:33,800
He beat the shit out of Roy
and it was a long fight,

5086
02:11:33,801 --> 02:11:34,130
right?

5087
02:11:34,130 --> 02:11:35,300
Wasn't it like a five rounds?

5088
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:35,750
Uh,

5089
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:36,700
I don't know if it's five rounds.

5090
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:37,910
Three rounds of an ass whooping though.

5091
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:38,181
See,

5092
02:11:38,181 --> 02:11:39,770
if you find that jam is a month,

5093
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:40,880
he's a bad motherfucker.

5094
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:42,020
He's bad mouthing him.

5095
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:44,240
Him and frankly the most
cerebral I think to ever.

5096
02:11:44,290 --> 02:11:49,290
That's why Travis Brown's elbows are so
fucking impressive that he put him out.

5097
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:50,930
He gets Josh out.

5098
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:52,030
It's weird when Josh Russia,

5099
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:54,380
because Salt Gonzaga to
get stopped like that.

5100
02:11:54,381 --> 02:11:55,340
Then he did the same thing.

5101
02:11:55,370 --> 02:11:57,650
I think he got clipped with
a punch before he rushed.

5102
02:11:58,910 --> 02:12:00,560
I think if I remember correctly,

5103
02:12:00,590 --> 02:12:01,670
I don't remember correctly,

5104
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:03,920
but I remember those fucking elbows.

5105
02:12:04,130 --> 02:12:06,580
We to this day we call that
position the Travis Browne.

5106
02:12:06,581 --> 02:12:07,414
Yeah.

5107
02:12:07,660 --> 02:12:08,870
Is he done Josh?

5108
02:12:09,170 --> 02:12:09,740
Sorry.

5109
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:10,190
I Dunno.

5110
02:12:10,190 --> 02:12:11,023
Um,

5111
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:12,320
Josh Barnett and Roy Nelson.

5112
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:13,340
He has a five round fight.

5113
02:12:13,550 --> 02:12:14,383
Five rounds.

5114
02:12:15,080 --> 02:12:15,710
No,

5115
02:12:15,710 --> 02:12:16,041
no.

5116
02:12:16,041 --> 02:12:17,660
I'm saying that kind of
fight made a main event.

5117
02:12:17,661 --> 02:12:17,850
Yeah,

5118
02:12:17,850 --> 02:12:18,410
it's crazy.

5119
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:18,531
Yeah.

5120
02:12:18,531 --> 02:12:19,370
I was amazed at van.

5121
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:19,990
Yeah,

5122
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:20,381
that's right.

5123
02:12:20,381 --> 02:12:21,214
It was overseas.

5124
02:12:21,530 --> 02:12:21,741
Yeah.

5125
02:12:21,741 --> 02:12:22,670
It was a beating man.

5126
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:23,290
It was eating.

5127
02:12:23,290 --> 02:12:26,570
I was very impressed as cardio
and you'd pass forwards gun like,

5128
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:27,410
yeah,

5129
02:12:27,410 --> 02:12:28,940
to frank does not look fat.

5130
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:29,590
Right.

5131
02:12:29,590 --> 02:12:30,423
Just jacked man.

5132
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:31,011
Why did I see,

5133
02:12:31,011 --> 02:12:33,920
I saw a photo of must have been
from in the past where he was heavy,

5134
02:12:34,070 --> 02:12:38,990
like maybe while they were setting this
fight up because like looking at him now

5135
02:12:39,010 --> 02:12:40,340
and he looks very fixed.

5136
02:12:40,341 --> 02:12:40,760
Great.

5137
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:41,541
It looks very fit.

5138
02:12:41,541 --> 02:12:42,300
He's in studio with me.

5139
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:42,621
I told him,

5140
02:12:42,621 --> 02:12:42,801
I said,

5141
02:12:42,801 --> 02:12:42,951
man,

5142
02:12:42,951 --> 02:12:44,210
you look shredded.

5143
02:12:44,211 --> 02:12:44,571
He's like,

5144
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:45,404
I'm ready to go.

5145
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:46,393
Wow.

5146
02:12:46,580 --> 02:12:47,413
I'm impressed.

5147
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,100
He does look very fit,

5148
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:51,560
so he must have been heavy
when he started at camp.

5149
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:53,343
It's really heavy.

5150
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:53,830
That's what it is.

5151
02:12:53,830 --> 02:12:56,400
He didn't fight for a little bit so you
know he's been commentating and flying a

5152
02:12:56,410 --> 02:12:57,201
Russia shit.

5153
02:12:57,201 --> 02:12:57,741
Interesting.

5154
02:12:57,741 --> 02:12:58,041
Here.

5155
02:12:58,041 --> 02:12:58,874
Here we go.

5156
02:12:59,860 --> 02:13:00,950
This is the only three rounds.

5157
02:13:00,951 --> 02:13:03,770
They don't do five round
main event only title fights.

5158
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:04,633
Here we go.

5159
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:06,320
What do you think about that?

5160
02:13:06,860 --> 02:13:07,820
I kind of agree with that.

5161
02:13:07,850 --> 02:13:08,050
Yeah.

5162
02:13:08,050 --> 02:13:08,900
I'm not mad at it.

5163
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:09,920
I like firing rounds.

5164
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:10,810
Three rounds.

5165
02:13:10,810 --> 02:13:11,660
That goes too quick.

5166
02:13:11,750 --> 02:13:12,571
I liked five round,

5167
02:13:12,571 --> 02:13:13,970
20 smaller weight classes,

5168
02:13:13,971 --> 02:13:14,804
so good point.

5169
02:13:14,890 --> 02:13:15,740
My thing would be,

5170
02:13:15,741 --> 02:13:16,490
man,

5171
02:13:16,490 --> 02:13:18,110
five round fights are beatings,

5172
02:13:18,111 --> 02:13:18,500
man.

5173
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:19,220
I mean you really,

5174
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:22,310
oh clipped him clover.

5175
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:24,410
Oh said we're in trouble.

5176
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:25,850
Not only surviving now.

5177
02:13:26,330 --> 02:13:27,230
Oh,

5178
02:13:27,610 --> 02:13:28,900
shit down.

5179
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:30,350
He didn't frank.

5180
02:13:30,410 --> 02:13:31,860
He didn't have the under hook right there

5181
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,640
again.

5182
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:33,960
That's why frank stood up.

5183
02:13:35,650 --> 02:13:37,170
Oh,

5184
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:38,000
Burgess.

5185
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,470
Oh holy.

5186
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:39,760
Oh Wow.

5187
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:40,650
This can be a quick one.

5188
02:13:40,651 --> 02:13:41,670
I thought was gonna be a decision.

5189
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:44,760
This is phenomenal.

5190
02:13:45,570 --> 02:13:46,460
If it's on.

5191
02:13:46,780 --> 02:13:47,613
Oh.

5192
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:48,773
Oh.

5193
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:50,110
Oh Shit.

5194
02:13:52,230 --> 02:13:53,063
It's over.

5195
02:13:53,490 --> 02:13:54,323
That's it.

5196
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:55,380
Oh,

5197
02:13:57,060 --> 02:13:59,490
what a war dance.

5198
02:13:59,590 --> 02:14:01,120
Whew.

5199
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,590
Oh Wow.

5200
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:05,660
You ready for this fade or chill?

5201
02:14:05,661 --> 02:14:06,560
Sewn in snacks.

5202
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:07,330
Oh my God.

5203
02:14:07,330 --> 02:14:08,163
That's sinking.

5204
02:14:08,270 --> 02:14:09,530
Oh my God.

5205
02:14:09,950 --> 02:14:10,970
Oh my God.

5206
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:11,610
Yeah.

5207
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:12,950
That's actually fun.

5208
02:14:12,980 --> 02:14:15,470
That's fucking Kodak into happen.

5209
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:15,861
Wow.

5210
02:14:15,861 --> 02:14:16,694
Frank Mirrors.

5211
02:14:17,290 --> 02:14:17,601
You know,

5212
02:14:17,601 --> 02:14:18,500
and he almost had him.

5213
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:19,993
Almost had him.

5214
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:21,290
What a great throat.

5215
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:23,870
That is a great fuck fucking hip toss,

5216
02:14:23,871 --> 02:14:24,230
Huh?

5217
02:14:24,230 --> 02:14:25,020
That was beautiful.

5218
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:28,910
Bottom some time dude
fade or chail sewn in.

5219
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:29,990
Wow.

5220
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:31,430
When was the last time fade?

5221
02:14:31,431 --> 02:14:33,770
Or one Maldonado,

5222
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:35,690
but he really lost and Russia lost.

5223
02:14:36,230 --> 02:14:36,830
Yeah.

5224
02:14:36,830 --> 02:14:38,120
He got hurt and that fun.

5225
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:38,461
Yeah.

5226
02:14:38,461 --> 02:14:39,380
That was crazy.

5227
02:14:39,390 --> 02:14:39,740
Flat.

5228
02:14:39,740 --> 02:14:40,640
I forgot about that one.

5229
02:14:40,641 --> 02:14:41,200
Yeah.

5230
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:42,260
So let's,

5231
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:42,771
I agree.

5232
02:14:42,771 --> 02:14:43,491
Won that fight.

5233
02:14:43,491 --> 02:14:44,031
He won it,

5234
02:14:44,031 --> 02:14:44,780
but he lost it.

5235
02:14:44,780 --> 02:14:45,380
So let's,

5236
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:46,730
let's take it in Russia,

5237
02:14:46,731 --> 02:14:47,330
right?

5238
02:14:47,330 --> 02:14:48,020
Yes.

5239
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:49,550
Let's take that one out of the equation.

5240
02:14:49,780 --> 02:14:49,941
He,

5241
02:14:49,941 --> 02:14:51,410
she damn,

5242
02:14:51,411 --> 02:14:51,921
that's right.

5243
02:14:51,921 --> 02:14:52,610
So Toshi,

5244
02:14:52,610 --> 02:14:53,840
which his last fight,

5245
02:14:53,990 --> 02:14:58,150
his retirement fight in his last run and
then decided to come back after that.

5246
02:14:58,400 --> 02:14:59,233
I'll do this

5247
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:02,791
please.

5248
02:15:02,791 --> 02:15:04,180
All wild and loose.

5249
02:15:04,181 --> 02:15:04,480
Huh?

5250
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:05,170
Boom.

5251
02:15:05,170 --> 02:15:05,411
Wait,

5252
02:15:05,411 --> 02:15:06,250
the left both.

5253
02:15:06,251 --> 02:15:07,330
Both hands down.

5254
02:15:07,870 --> 02:15:08,320
Damn.

5255
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:09,670
What cloud this must be.

5256
02:15:09,940 --> 02:15:10,401
Oh,

5257
02:15:10,401 --> 02:15:11,470
they're the left hand.

5258
02:15:11,471 --> 02:15:12,304
Right on the chin.

5259
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:12,761
Oh,

5260
02:15:12,761 --> 02:15:13,480
boom.

5261
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:14,313
Boom.

5262
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:15,490
Crazy hard shot.

5263
02:15:16,230 --> 02:15:16,991
Just swinging.

5264
02:15:16,991 --> 02:15:18,640
They're swinging wild going.

5265
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:20,830
Oh Shit.

5266
02:15:20,980 --> 02:15:22,940
I feel like he caught them
earlier than that too,

5267
02:15:22,941 --> 02:15:24,250
but just that was the,

5268
02:15:24,280 --> 02:15:25,330
that was the big one.

5269
02:15:25,390 --> 02:15:26,740
The one that really hurt them.

5270
02:15:27,970 --> 02:15:28,960
Perfect stoppage.

5271
02:15:30,130 --> 02:15:30,821
God Damn,

5272
02:15:30,821 --> 02:15:31,210
there it is.

5273
02:15:31,210 --> 02:15:31,781
Oh,

5274
02:15:31,781 --> 02:15:32,680
it was the left.

5275
02:15:32,830 --> 02:15:33,880
Perfect left hand.

5276
02:15:34,990 --> 02:15:35,823
That was nice.

5277
02:15:36,410 --> 02:15:36,941
It's crazy.

5278
02:15:36,941 --> 02:15:40,330
This is fate or his first win
and take out the Maldonado fight.

5279
02:15:40,331 --> 02:15:41,520
She's how many years then?

5280
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:42,011
How many years?

5281
02:15:42,011 --> 02:15:43,630
It's been a rough go for my man.

5282
02:15:43,660 --> 02:15:44,101
When was he?

5283
02:15:44,101 --> 02:15:44,890
She,

5284
02:15:44,890 --> 02:15:47,420
you felt beat seeing Jack Deep,

5285
02:15:47,590 --> 02:15:48,720
all that shit.

5286
02:15:49,660 --> 02:15:50,440
My brain,

5287
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:51,071
my brain goes,

5288
02:15:51,071 --> 02:15:51,281
no,

5289
02:15:51,281 --> 02:15:52,630
that was when 15

5290
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:53,241
new years eve.

5291
02:15:53,241 --> 02:15:54,910
2015 he also be Pedro his,

5292
02:15:54,911 --> 02:15:55,101
Oh,

5293
02:15:55,101 --> 02:15:57,140
on January 21st,

5294
02:15:57,140 --> 02:15:57,830
2012 that was,

5295
02:15:57,830 --> 02:15:58,300
yeah,

5296
02:15:58,300 --> 02:16:01,800
2012 shows after the
issue was 2012 oh yeah,

5297
02:16:01,810 --> 02:16:02,021
the,

5298
02:16:02,021 --> 02:16:02,890
the Pedro,

5299
02:16:02,891 --> 02:16:03,341
his Oh,

5300
02:16:03,341 --> 02:16:05,040
fight was a crazy knockout man.

5301
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:05,950
That must have been in Europe.

5302
02:16:05,951 --> 02:16:06,784
So my rule,

5303
02:16:06,790 --> 02:16:11,790
a leg kick and then faked a leg kick
and landed a punch fade or started out

5304
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:14,800
against,

5305
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:18,340
I mean a guy we think about who's
got better leg kicks and Pedro,

5306
02:16:18,341 --> 02:16:19,600
his m one.

5307
02:16:20,260 --> 02:16:21,310
It was a Russian fight.

5308
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:23,020
It was a ruthless knockout man.

5309
02:16:23,110 --> 02:16:23,980
See if you could find one.

5310
02:16:23,981 --> 02:16:24,251
One,

5311
02:16:24,251 --> 02:16:24,491
two,

5312
02:16:24,491 --> 02:16:25,324
three,

5313
02:16:25,480 --> 02:16:26,171
pull up Pedro,

5314
02:16:26,171 --> 02:16:28,670
his versus fate or John,

5315
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:30,490
do you notice if you notice

5316
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:32,080
anything or failures record there?

5317
02:16:32,081 --> 02:16:33,190
So he went on that fight,

5318
02:16:33,191 --> 02:16:34,024
fight winning streak.

5319
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:38,920
It's none of it in the states before
that three in states states loses.

5320
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:39,700
Is this,

5321
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:40,870
this first one in the states?

5322
02:16:42,790 --> 02:16:44,380
Maybe Brett Rogers was his first.

5323
02:16:44,381 --> 02:16:44,600
Yes.

5324
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:46,330
Was this was look at this.

5325
02:16:46,390 --> 02:16:47,200
Boom,

5326
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:47,800
boom.

5327
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:49,270
He threw a leg kick.

5328
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:50,950
And before that did you,

5329
02:16:50,951 --> 02:16:53,600
was this the whole fight or
just a highlight real quick.

5330
02:16:54,070 --> 02:16:54,810
They edited it.

5331
02:16:54,810 --> 02:16:54,940
Yeah.

5332
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:55,773
The video,

5333
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:57,970
Jesus is still explosive.

5334
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,780
He hit him with a leg kick first and then
he faked the leg kick and came in with

5335
02:17:01,781 --> 02:17:02,520
that punch.

5336
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:03,850
If you came at that right hand and left,

5337
02:17:03,851 --> 02:17:04,760
took behind it and he's,

5338
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,330
he's still explosive man.

5339
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:07,901
Oh yeah man.

5340
02:17:07,901 --> 02:17:09,070
Tonight he was explosive.

5341
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:09,701
Look,

5342
02:17:09,701 --> 02:17:10,534
he's still,

5343
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:13,230
he's still fucking fade
or I mean you still,

5344
02:17:13,880 --> 02:17:16,090
he's a legend for sure,

5345
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:20,260
but you're tapping him in the jaw
and he'll go down like a regular guy.

5346
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:22,660
He is a regular guy in that regard.

5347
02:17:22,661 --> 02:17:24,840
Now all the fights that he's had,

5348
02:17:24,850 --> 02:17:25,631
all the wars,

5349
02:17:25,631 --> 02:17:27,670
the fact that he's in
his late thirties right?

5350
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:29,680
41 he's 41 wow.

5351
02:17:29,681 --> 02:17:30,660
I thought it was flood.

5352
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:32,200
I'd love to see that some never happening.

5353
02:17:32,201 --> 02:17:36,160
So it's stupid for me to say it
Francis and gone and or oh my God.

5354
02:17:36,161 --> 02:17:37,180
Why would you want to see that?

5355
02:17:37,390 --> 02:17:39,880
Cause they both just slamming them things,

5356
02:17:40,370 --> 02:17:42,040
but how do you think that fight would go?

5357
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:42,730
I think,

5358
02:17:42,730 --> 02:17:46,480
I think Francis knocked his head
into Russia or Brock Lesnar fate.

5359
02:17:46,481 --> 02:17:47,314
Or

5360
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:49,240
if I was,

5361
02:17:50,030 --> 02:17:50,670
if I could,

5362
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:51,730
if I had,

5363
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:54,400
if I had like a willy Wonka golden ticket,

5364
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:56,680
like just gave it to you
and I gave it to you,

5365
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:58,660
I would say Brock Lesnar versus who,

5366
02:17:59,700 --> 02:18:01,810
who finances in Ghana

5367
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:04,901
and the posters.

5368
02:18:04,901 --> 02:18:05,734
Just old school.

5369
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:07,750
It'd be so sick.

5370
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:09,063
I liked that.

5371
02:18:09,430 --> 02:18:09,971
I liked that.

5372
02:18:09,971 --> 02:18:12,280
A thing about Brock can win
if he lands a take down,

5373
02:18:12,281 --> 02:18:16,030
but good luck not getting clipped
coming in such a dynamic fight.

5374
02:18:16,570 --> 02:18:17,920
It's nice scene fade or wind man.

5375
02:18:17,921 --> 02:18:18,754
I gotta say,

5376
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:19,060
I mean,

5377
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:19,960
I love Frank Mir.

5378
02:18:19,961 --> 02:18:22,210
I'm a Frank Mir fan and somebody had a,

5379
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:24,290
when she was kind of Nice hail him,

5380
02:18:24,310 --> 02:18:24,880
he door.

5381
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:25,600
I like it.

5382
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:26,500
I liked that a lot.

5383
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:28,420
The biggest fight Beltour history.

5384
02:18:28,660 --> 02:18:29,680
It's a very good fight,

5385
02:18:29,681 --> 02:18:30,250
man.

5386
02:18:30,250 --> 02:18:33,960
It's a very good fight and chills going
to talk some mad shit fade or doesn't

5387
02:18:34,020 --> 02:18:34,920
sell fights and wars.

5388
02:18:34,930 --> 02:18:35,980
He's just off his name.

5389
02:18:35,981 --> 02:18:36,791
That's what frank was saying.

5390
02:18:36,791 --> 02:18:37,001
He goes,

5391
02:18:37,001 --> 02:18:37,450
dude,

5392
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:38,111
the media tour,

5393
02:18:38,111 --> 02:18:39,540
I have to do everything fatal.

5394
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:40,860
Refuses to do interviews now.

5395
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:41,831
He doesn't do interviews.

5396
02:18:41,831 --> 02:18:42,490
Yeah,

5397
02:18:42,490 --> 02:18:43,330
well I get it.

5398
02:18:43,990 --> 02:18:44,950
He doesn't speak English,

5399
02:18:44,951 --> 02:18:45,784
they call it.

5400
02:18:46,650 --> 02:18:46,960
Yeah,

5401
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:47,570
I figured it out.

5402
02:18:47,570 --> 02:18:47,950
Motherfucker.

5403
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:49,030
The new fans like who,

5404
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:51,010
who while they know him now.

5405
02:18:51,430 --> 02:18:51,851
I see.

5406
02:18:51,851 --> 02:18:53,920
I think even amongst the,

5407
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:55,480
the new fans,

5408
02:18:55,510 --> 02:18:56,290
this is like,

5409
02:18:56,290 --> 02:18:59,650
I mean he's essentially like a
Reggie Jackson type character.

5410
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:01,210
If you know baseball,

5411
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:02,350
you know who Reggie Jackson,

5412
02:19:02,351 --> 02:19:03,910
even if you don't know a lot about them,

5413
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:05,950
you know who Reggie Jackson
and if you're new to the sport,

5414
02:19:05,951 --> 02:19:06,220
you're like,

5415
02:19:06,220 --> 02:19:08,680
this guy's the best of all
time seeing this stuff,

5416
02:19:08,681 --> 02:19:10,450
but they don't realize it's days.

5417
02:19:10,510 --> 02:19:11,050
Well,

5418
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:13,440
you got to go back and watch
the first Nogueira fight.

5419
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:14,081
Father Cro,

5420
02:19:14,081 --> 02:19:16,240
cop fight or you know,

5421
02:19:16,270 --> 02:19:18,370
even the Kevin Randleman
by when he got clipped,

5422
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,091
the Kevin Random,

5423
02:19:19,091 --> 02:19:23,050
one's a great one suplex and then I just
a few moments later catches his arm.

5424
02:19:23,290 --> 02:19:24,123
Nasty.

5425
02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:25,893
Yeah man.

5426
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:26,741
Very,

5427
02:19:26,741 --> 02:19:27,170
very,

5428
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:28,040
very interesting.

5429
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:28,520
She's,

5430
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:32,350
she's been translating for fade
order for 20 it just flies her.

5431
02:19:32,530 --> 02:19:33,363
Yeah.

5432
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:34,880
Maybe that's his girl.

5433
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:35,691
She goes out back.

5434
02:19:35,691 --> 02:19:37,550
She puts a make America
great again hat on.

5435
02:19:40,030 --> 02:19:42,820
They catch her a or his locker
after where she's wearing the mag.

5436
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:46,400
If I was a manager,

5437
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:49,850
I would make everybody a camp
where it just for the press be too.

5438
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:50,421
I'd be like,

5439
02:19:50,421 --> 02:19:50,841
put it on,

5440
02:19:50,841 --> 02:19:50,991
man.

5441
02:19:50,991 --> 02:19:52,040
He's the president United States.

5442
02:19:52,041 --> 02:19:53,210
What's the fucking problem?

5443
02:19:53,570 --> 02:19:55,610
Awareness about Kanye.

5444
02:19:56,220 --> 02:19:57,053
He's crazy.

5445
02:19:57,530 --> 02:19:58,450
He weird it,

5446
02:19:58,610 --> 02:19:59,060
but I mean,

5447
02:19:59,060 --> 02:19:59,541
come on man.

5448
02:19:59,541 --> 02:20:03,590
How good would that be if all of fate
doors camp including fade or had those

5449
02:20:03,591 --> 02:20:04,880
read Maga hats on?

5450
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:07,010
That shit would be hilarious.

5451
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:10,100
So bad if they were trolling,

5452
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:11,263
that'd be great.

5453
02:20:14,060 --> 02:20:14,900
Tell you what man.

5454
02:20:14,901 --> 02:20:16,220
Your boy mitre own.

5455
02:20:16,550 --> 02:20:18,980
I mean that's a giant wind for him.

5456
02:20:19,130 --> 02:20:21,470
That was a giant when when
he came I would fade or,

5457
02:20:21,480 --> 02:20:21,561
well,

5458
02:20:21,561 --> 02:20:25,250
now Matt fights the winter of Bater Chemo.

5459
02:20:25,590 --> 02:20:26,423
That's a tough fight.

5460
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:27,200
Tough fight.

5461
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:27,891
It's a tough fight.

5462
02:20:27,891 --> 02:20:28,520
Fight for Matt.

5463
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:28,970
Matt,

5464
02:20:28,970 --> 02:20:31,820
you know if he's got an issue at all,

5465
02:20:32,030 --> 02:20:34,760
it's not in his foot work or
as knockout power is movement.

5466
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:36,980
It's if the fight goes the
ground like it was resting.

5467
02:20:36,981 --> 02:20:37,311
Here we go.

5468
02:20:37,311 --> 02:20:38,390
I want to hear what channels to say.

5469
02:20:38,391 --> 02:20:39,141
Crank that shit up,

5470
02:20:39,141 --> 02:20:39,974
Jamie.

5471
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:41,090
This can be great.

5472
02:20:41,450 --> 02:20:42,283
Look at it.

5473
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:50,560
Say someone who'd be in Russian,

5474
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:52,230
it will not be bored.

5475
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:54,103
His trash talking.

5476
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:55,190
So old school,

5477
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:56,990
it's very pro wrestling.

5478
02:20:57,470 --> 02:20:58,610
It's just not very good.

5479
02:20:58,850 --> 02:21:01,250
How do the Russian thing in is for this

5480
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,680
damn Chilson is pretty fucking big.

5481
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:06,021
Yeah,

5482
02:21:06,021 --> 02:21:07,220
failure is a small dude.

5483
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:08,360
Okay.

5484
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:09,041
That's why was a heavyweight.

5485
02:21:09,041 --> 02:21:09,620
He goes,

5486
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:10,453
yeah,

5487
02:21:10,730 --> 02:21:11,780
very interesting.

5488
02:21:12,810 --> 02:21:13,100
God.

5489
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:13,580
I thought,

5490
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:13,861
you know what?

5491
02:21:13,861 --> 02:21:14,900
I expect more chill.

5492
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:15,690
I thought he'd be like,

5493
02:21:15,690 --> 02:21:17,590
just one thing I hate more
than being this gauge.

5494
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:19,910
Do it's all Russian in this gauge.

5495
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:22,040
The Trump,

5496
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:23,540
yes.

5497
02:21:23,540 --> 02:21:24,450
It pulls out a Mac.

5498
02:21:24,451 --> 02:21:25,284
Got Married.

5499
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:27,693
Wait,

5500
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:30,070
when is a fighter going
to come out with a,

5501
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:30,471
I mean,

5502
02:21:30,471 --> 02:21:33,230
has there ever been a time where you
get more shit for liking the president?

5503
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:35,360
Never even close.

5504
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:36,830
Not even close.

5505
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:38,420
I mean at the very least,

5506
02:21:38,630 --> 02:21:40,520
even if you didn't want him to win,

5507
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:42,110
now that he's the president,

5508
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:44,210
would you not want him to succeed?

5509
02:21:44,530 --> 02:21:45,171
What do you want?

5510
02:21:45,171 --> 02:21:46,400
Why do if he succeeds,

5511
02:21:46,401 --> 02:21:47,240
it means we succeed.

5512
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:50,570
You want everything to be a catastrophic
failure because your guy didn't win,

5513
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:55,370
or do you want him to get better at the
job and be really good at what he does

5514
02:21:55,490 --> 02:21:58,770
and be the best president that he can be
and pull a bunch of shit on what he did

5515
02:21:58,790 --> 02:21:59,600
with North Korea?

5516
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:00,433
What's up with that?

5517
02:22:00,710 --> 02:22:01,543
Maybe he did.

5518
02:22:01,780 --> 02:22:03,050
I mean maybe it was a part of it.

5519
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:07,700
We're both North Korea and South Korea
giving Donald Trump all the credit.

5520
02:22:07,740 --> 02:22:08,370
That's amazing.

5521
02:22:08,370 --> 02:22:08,901
If that's true,

5522
02:22:08,901 --> 02:22:10,490
that's amazing on CNN.

5523
02:22:10,491 --> 02:22:10,541
He,

5524
02:22:10,541 --> 02:22:15,541
that alone shows you that his unorthodox
style that you might be terrible if

5525
02:22:15,621 --> 02:22:18,980
you're married to them or terrible if
you're doing business with them are

5526
02:22:18,981 --> 02:22:20,960
terrible if you're his
lawyer or terrible whatever,

5527
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:24,800
but that unorthodox style
might have value to it,

5528
02:22:24,801 --> 02:22:26,250
but no one wants that value

5529
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:29,900
because you don't want him to win
because it's a fucking weird time.

5530
02:22:29,901 --> 02:22:30,734
It's like routine.

5531
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:34,950
It's almost like you're rooting against
America because you feel so strongly

5532
02:22:34,951 --> 02:22:35,784
about the press.

5533
02:22:36,090 --> 02:22:36,681
Like to your point,

5534
02:22:36,681 --> 02:22:37,710
would you rather have him out?

5535
02:22:37,711 --> 02:22:38,620
You want the economy,

5536
02:22:38,621 --> 02:22:39,454
you better.

5537
02:22:39,650 --> 02:22:40,560
Here's he's the other thing.

5538
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:42,000
You want Mike Pence to be president.

5539
02:22:42,030 --> 02:22:43,440
Are you sure you don't
know what you just said?

5540
02:22:43,490 --> 02:22:46,650
You don't know what you're saying
like that is not a smart choice.

5541
02:22:46,651 --> 02:22:48,030
That's not what you voted for.

5542
02:22:48,090 --> 02:22:48,930
It's now what you want.

5543
02:22:49,230 --> 02:22:52,440
What you should want is even
if you don't like Donald Trump,

5544
02:22:52,441 --> 02:22:56,040
what you should want is that
he does a great fucking job.

5545
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:57,900
He turns the economy around,

5546
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:00,060
he goes after child pedophiles,

5547
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:02,130
he goes after like whatever,

5548
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:02,611
whatever,

5549
02:23:02,611 --> 02:23:03,630
fill in the blanks,

5550
02:23:03,631 --> 02:23:05,220
whatever thing you would like them to do.

5551
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:10,140
Even if he talks crazy shit about and
it gets on Fox and friends and says a

5552
02:23:10,141 --> 02:23:11,010
bunch of nutty shit,

5553
02:23:11,430 --> 02:23:15,660
wouldn't you still want that guy to
do the best job running the country?

5554
02:23:15,810 --> 02:23:18,390
This is where things get weird
cause I think most people say no.

5555
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:20,280
I think if they say yes,

5556
02:23:20,281 --> 02:23:22,710
they're lion what they want
and they want them to fail,

5557
02:23:22,770 --> 02:23:24,890
they want them to be the worst
ever because they watched.

5558
02:23:24,930 --> 02:23:25,763
That's what they want.

5559
02:23:26,190 --> 02:23:27,390
That's what they want to flaw.

5560
02:23:27,860 --> 02:23:29,070
That's a crazy way of thinking.

5561
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:31,170
But I didn't vote for Donald Trump,

5562
02:23:31,410 --> 02:23:35,670
but I want him to do great because
he's the fucking president.

5563
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,500
Like either someone else comes along
that's better and wins and takes over,

5564
02:23:40,501 --> 02:23:41,334
or why would I,

5565
02:23:41,550 --> 02:23:45,510
why would I want everything to go bad
even if I didn't vote for so retarded?

5566
02:23:45,540 --> 02:23:46,090
Everybody,

5567
02:23:46,090 --> 02:23:47,730
if you had a doctor,

5568
02:23:47,731 --> 02:23:49,020
this is a good example.

5569
02:23:49,050 --> 02:23:49,291
Not,

5570
02:23:49,291 --> 02:23:49,480
not,

5571
02:23:49,480 --> 02:23:49,710
maybe,

5572
02:23:49,710 --> 02:23:50,543
maybe it sucks,

5573
02:23:50,670 --> 02:23:53,250
but if you had a doctor and
the doctor was a Dickhead,

5574
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:54,480
the doctor's fucking annoying,

5575
02:23:54,481 --> 02:23:55,440
but he had to fix your knee.

5576
02:23:57,090 --> 02:23:58,710
But you know he's the
best at fixing knees.

5577
02:23:59,170 --> 02:24:00,090
Like this guy's a Dick dickhead.

5578
02:24:00,091 --> 02:24:01,260
I hope he fucked my knee up.

5579
02:24:02,990 --> 02:24:04,370
And people are,

5580
02:24:05,350 --> 02:24:08,550
you can never say that it's only
hurting you is the only guy can do this

5581
02:24:08,551 --> 02:24:09,580
operation for any of you.

5582
02:24:09,581 --> 02:24:10,410
Got to listen to me.

5583
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:11,640
I know the guy's an asshole.

5584
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:12,760
Let him operate on your knees,

5585
02:24:12,770 --> 02:24:13,800
going to do a great job.

5586
02:24:13,950 --> 02:24:15,000
He's going to talk shit.

5587
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:16,260
He's going to try to fuck your mom,

5588
02:24:16,380 --> 02:24:17,630
but he's going to do,

5589
02:24:19,390 --> 02:24:20,610
here's a video.

5590
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:23,100
Get it to people that hate Trump,

5591
02:24:23,190 --> 02:24:28,190
accused them of being racist and there's
a video of ice Q 50 said Shaquille

5592
02:24:29,220 --> 02:24:29,370
O'Neal,

5593
02:24:29,370 --> 02:24:32,820
like five or six celebrities
and now Kanye West that a,

5594
02:24:32,821 --> 02:24:33,780
they don't think he's racist.

5595
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:35,580
Donald Trump is bad ass.

5596
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:36,530
He's well,

5597
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:37,590
he tells it like it is.

5598
02:24:37,630 --> 02:24:39,180
The question is like,

5599
02:24:39,181 --> 02:24:40,080
was he,

5600
02:24:40,110 --> 02:24:42,600
when he talked about Mexicans
on the campaign trail,

5601
02:24:42,601 --> 02:24:47,010
was he playing to people that are white
supremacists and what does he understand

5602
02:24:47,011 --> 02:24:50,250
that he has a base in those people
and does he defend that base?

5603
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:53,520
That was about Charlottesville to correct
because he was saying that on both

5604
02:24:53,521 --> 02:24:54,390
sides there's,

5605
02:24:54,391 --> 02:24:56,070
there's problems on both sides.

5606
02:24:56,071 --> 02:24:58,140
Both the protesters and the KKK,

5607
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:00,180
you gotta just and sometimes,

5608
02:25:00,181 --> 02:25:02,550
and he was right there on was problems on,

5609
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:03,570
on both sides,

5610
02:25:03,571 --> 02:25:06,660
but they were there because
of a white supremacy rally.

5611
02:25:06,661 --> 02:25:10,770
And the most important point is that
that alone is a ridiculous way to think.

5612
02:25:10,771 --> 02:25:11,700
And that as Americans,

5613
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:16,050
we can't tolerate someone who only likes
people that come from the same part of

5614
02:25:16,051 --> 02:25:19,530
the world is dam or people that only have
the same color skin is then where the

5615
02:25:19,531 --> 02:25:20,850
white race or the pure race,

5616
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:21,870
because that's stupid.

5617
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:24,790
It doesn't even fit up with
what we know about Iq standards.

5618
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:28,510
If we really wanted the master race
we would be all trying to be Asian.

5619
02:25:28,810 --> 02:25:29,111
Okay.

5620
02:25:29,111 --> 02:25:31,960
Cause they dominate in Iq to the
point where they're suing Harvard.

5621
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:33,610
Right now there's Asian,

5622
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:36,910
there's an Asian American group that's
suing Harvard because the standards for

5623
02:25:36,911 --> 02:25:40,750
Asians to enter Harvard are more
stringent than even white people.

5624
02:25:41,140 --> 02:25:42,850
They're harder because they're
better because they get,

5625
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:45,760
they get in more because their
brains work better than yours.

5626
02:25:47,020 --> 02:25:48,640
But see this is not,

5627
02:25:48,670 --> 02:25:50,050
this is not a popular narrative.

5628
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:50,321
You know,

5629
02:25:50,321 --> 02:25:51,950
like people don't talk about this but,

5630
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:52,360
but,

5631
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:53,620
but no one,

5632
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:54,910
no one's saying that.

5633
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:55,540
You know.

5634
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:55,991
So if you're,

5635
02:25:55,991 --> 02:25:58,570
if you're out there saying that
the white race is superior,

5636
02:25:58,660 --> 02:26:00,700
you're not even paying attention
to the facts this term.

5637
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:02,073
No,

5638
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:02,771
no.

5639
02:26:02,771 --> 02:26:04,720
But you got Lysol for sure not.

5640
02:26:04,750 --> 02:26:05,583
But the whites premise is,

5641
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:10,810
and they want general population
think that Trump thinks like that too.

5642
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:11,320
There's,

5643
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:12,041
that's not true.

5644
02:26:12,041 --> 02:26:12,970
There's no evidence of that.

5645
02:26:13,590 --> 02:26:14,291
That's what they thought.

5646
02:26:14,291 --> 02:26:18,640
There is evidence that he understands
that he has a base and that his base is

5647
02:26:18,850 --> 02:26:19,690
white people.

5648
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:23,020
There's a big part of it is white
people that are fed up about political

5649
02:26:23,021 --> 02:26:23,800
correctness.

5650
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:27,160
Why people that are fed up about being
said they're racist just because they're

5651
02:26:27,161 --> 02:26:29,370
white and he knows black
people that want to hand out.

5652
02:26:29,371 --> 02:26:33,220
Like there's a lot of racists that have
a welfare prob problems that people that

5653
02:26:33,221 --> 02:26:34,090
are on welfare,

5654
02:26:34,091 --> 02:26:34,960
they're taken our money,

5655
02:26:34,961 --> 02:26:35,794
they've taken our jobs.

5656
02:26:35,830 --> 02:26:38,140
There's a lot of that going on
and he knows that those people,

5657
02:26:38,141 --> 02:26:40,630
there's a percentage of those
people that I'm sure support him.

5658
02:26:40,810 --> 02:26:42,070
So you gotta be real careful in the sand.

5659
02:26:42,071 --> 02:26:43,060
He plays to that side.

5660
02:26:43,061 --> 02:26:43,480
Yeah.

5661
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:45,100
But no one's saying he's got,

5662
02:26:45,130 --> 02:26:46,780
there's any evidence that he's like that.

5663
02:26:46,781 --> 02:26:49,180
But he did say racist shit about Mexicans.

5664
02:26:49,630 --> 02:26:49,991
Right.

5665
02:26:49,991 --> 02:26:52,460
When he was talking about how the
rape and murder and the like the,

5666
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:55,600
you know like someone's doing the
raping and murdering the crime,

5667
02:26:56,320 --> 02:26:57,880
the crime of course out of control.

5668
02:26:57,910 --> 02:26:59,200
But he's not being honest about that.

5669
02:26:59,290 --> 02:26:59,651
Okay,

5670
02:26:59,651 --> 02:27:02,560
so if one that's obvious
that he's trying to win,

5671
02:27:02,561 --> 02:27:02,741
right?

5672
02:27:02,741 --> 02:27:03,970
Cause if it's being honest about that,

5673
02:27:03,971 --> 02:27:07,690
what he would say is the reason why
there's so much crime is because drugs are

5674
02:27:07,691 --> 02:27:08,524
illegal.

5675
02:27:08,530 --> 02:27:09,790
If we may drugs legal,

5676
02:27:09,791 --> 02:27:13,510
we could sell these drugs to these people
in America would be run by businesses

5677
02:27:13,630 --> 02:27:15,380
instead of being run by the mob that did.

5678
02:27:15,420 --> 02:27:17,140
The demand is undeniable.

5679
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:17,831
It's undeniable.

5680
02:27:17,831 --> 02:27:19,210
There's a demand for cocaine,

5681
02:27:19,390 --> 02:27:20,170
heroin.

5682
02:27:20,170 --> 02:27:23,200
There's also a demand for alcohol
is also a demand for plenty.

5683
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:25,180
Plenty of things that are
bad for you in America.

5684
02:27:25,690 --> 02:27:30,690
Zr once you go about go buy 770 horsepower
corvette zero one that goes zero to

5685
02:27:30,851 --> 02:27:35,020
60 in 2.9 seconds and just drink
all the fucking red bulls you want.

5686
02:27:35,050 --> 02:27:38,290
Get on the highway and stomp the
gas and you're in a space ship.

5687
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:39,310
That's crazy too.

5688
02:27:39,820 --> 02:27:40,631
That's all crazy.

5689
02:27:40,631 --> 02:27:45,010
So is doing heroin or you probably
might die more driving a zr one like an

5690
02:27:45,011 --> 02:27:45,551
asshole.

5691
02:27:45,551 --> 02:27:46,990
Then you would be doing coke,

5692
02:27:47,050 --> 02:27:48,430
but just going to kill more people in.

5693
02:27:48,431 --> 02:27:49,030
That's the other one.

5694
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:49,841
You might look,

5695
02:27:49,841 --> 02:27:51,040
you might look,

5696
02:27:51,070 --> 02:27:54,310
there's still a lot of ways people can
fuck up their life and other lives around

5697
02:27:54,311 --> 02:27:55,690
them that are absolutely illegal,

5698
02:27:56,040 --> 02:27:59,440
but we just make this decision
that once something is illegal,

5699
02:27:59,441 --> 02:28:01,210
like drugs and I don't
think you should do coke.

5700
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:02,500
I don't think you should do heroin,

5701
02:28:02,710 --> 02:28:03,840
but I don't think you should.

5702
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:06,490
I don't think you should fucking
drink til you're dead either.

5703
02:28:06,491 --> 02:28:07,780
And people are doing that every day.

5704
02:28:07,781 --> 02:28:07,991
We're,

5705
02:28:07,991 --> 02:28:09,460
we're hypocrites in that regard.

5706
02:28:09,730 --> 02:28:13,780
And this idea that the only reason why
these people were over there raping and

5707
02:28:13,781 --> 02:28:15,430
murdering is because they're Mexican.

5708
02:28:15,670 --> 02:28:17,260
That's racist.

5709
02:28:17,710 --> 02:28:18,430
That's what you're saying.

5710
02:28:18,430 --> 02:28:19,630
It's a 20 Mexico.

5711
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:20,980
Someone over there is doing it,

5712
02:28:20,990 --> 02:28:22,280
but why are they doing it?

5713
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,151
I'll tell you why.

5714
02:28:23,151 --> 02:28:25,130
And you know why they're doing it.

5715
02:28:25,131 --> 02:28:26,840
Because drugs are illegal.

5716
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:28,820
That's how the cartel makes their money.

5717
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,250
What do you think about building a wall?

5718
02:28:31,251 --> 02:28:31,850
Crazy.

5719
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:32,690
We shouldn't build a wall.

5720
02:28:32,750 --> 02:28:33,860
You shouldn't have secure borders.

5721
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:36,320
We should do is help Mexico.

5722
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:37,070
We should.

5723
02:28:37,070 --> 02:28:39,890
We should figure out some way and one
of the best ways to help them would be

5724
02:28:39,891 --> 02:28:40,491
make drugs.

5725
02:28:40,491 --> 02:28:42,000
Legal could be one of
the best ways to talk.

5726
02:28:42,410 --> 02:28:43,680
Not the one would recognize that.

5727
02:28:43,980 --> 02:28:45,660
What Mexico is just like,

5728
02:28:45,960 --> 02:28:50,360
like how is Mexico in terms of
like the amount of distance,

5729
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:51,470
how were they?

5730
02:28:51,650 --> 02:28:53,210
It's close as they are to us.

5731
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:54,560
Not Us,

5732
02:28:54,890 --> 02:28:56,810
but New York is us.

5733
02:28:57,410 --> 02:28:59,510
You can get to it in Mexico in two hours.

5734
02:28:59,511 --> 02:29:00,320
Dude,

5735
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:04,310
you could drive to Mexico
from La in two hours,

5736
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:06,830
but that's the eyes are not a country.

5737
02:29:06,830 --> 02:29:07,663
I didn't even us,

5738
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:10,730
but we decided that Maine is us.

5739
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:12,950
That shit is way the fuck over there.

5740
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:14,600
These people are tagged to us.

5741
02:29:14,870 --> 02:29:15,980
They're right there.

5742
02:29:16,070 --> 02:29:17,150
They're connected.

5743
02:29:17,300 --> 02:29:18,650
You could walk there.

5744
02:29:18,860 --> 02:29:21,910
It's not outrageous to
match up more mess sources.

5745
02:29:22,050 --> 02:29:22,883
The right

5746
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:25,513
people.

5747
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:27,740
Nations are ridiculous.

5748
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:29,070
Nations are ridiculous.

5749
02:29:29,250 --> 02:29:30,590
One one world government.

5750
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:31,131
No,

5751
02:29:31,131 --> 02:29:32,480
not even a government man.

5752
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:35,390
We should have rules that we all agree on.

5753
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:38,870
Our problems are as the boys
teams go against other teams.

5754
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:41,060
But if we're all on the same team,

5755
02:29:41,180 --> 02:29:44,390
then we compete against each other
economically the way we do in cities.

5756
02:29:44,391 --> 02:29:46,100
That's why we don't have wars in cities.

5757
02:29:46,310 --> 02:29:47,540
We don't have city wars.

5758
02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:47,931
Right.

5759
02:29:47,931 --> 02:29:50,030
The reason why we have
wars with other countries,

5760
02:29:50,180 --> 02:29:52,550
because we think of each other
as being on another team.

5761
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:54,350
There's crime in cities,

5762
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:55,790
but there's crime and countries.

5763
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:59,720
But we really need is to abandon this
idea that we're all in these fucking

5764
02:29:59,721 --> 02:30:00,440
tribes.

5765
02:30:00,440 --> 02:30:02,270
And I'm not saying I support
one side or the other,

5766
02:30:02,271 --> 02:30:02,900
but it,

5767
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:03,890
when Trump was saying that,

5768
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:05,810
isn't the law,

5769
02:30:05,820 --> 02:30:09,620
the violences from the Mexican cartels
and stuff in America and the some of it,

5770
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:10,100
yeah,

5771
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:10,380
a lot.

5772
02:30:10,380 --> 02:30:11,180
Salvadorians no,

5773
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:12,200
it's 100% real,

5774
02:30:12,350 --> 02:30:17,150
but it's propped up by trucks and until
you address the root of what gives them

5775
02:30:17,151 --> 02:30:17,780
money,

5776
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:18,710
causes the violence,

5777
02:30:18,711 --> 02:30:20,360
and I'm just talking nonsense.

5778
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:25,250
So the primitive way to approach it is
to say this team is going to go against

5779
02:30:25,251 --> 02:30:25,821
that team.

5780
02:30:25,821 --> 02:30:26,960
So we're going to put up a wall of heat.

5781
02:30:26,961 --> 02:30:28,280
That team from coming over here.

5782
02:30:28,310 --> 02:30:29,143
That's not going to help.

5783
02:30:29,180 --> 02:30:29,990
They're still going to drink.

5784
02:30:29,990 --> 02:30:33,740
If you want to look at the entire
future of people the entire future,

5785
02:30:33,770 --> 02:30:37,100
it's eventually going to come to a point
where there's going to be an easy way.

5786
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:38,121
You know there's,

5787
02:30:38,121 --> 02:30:38,460
there's,

5788
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:41,000
they have these pixel and
the Google Pixel phone.

5789
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:45,280
They have these ear buds that allow you
to translate someone's language in real

5790
02:30:45,281 --> 02:30:45,710
time.

5791
02:30:45,710 --> 02:30:47,330
So if you were talking to me in Spanish,

5792
02:30:47,331 --> 02:30:50,240
I could hear it through these ear
buds for the Google Pixel phone,

5793
02:30:50,241 --> 02:30:54,110
the Pixel two and it would
translate so I could go to Mexico,

5794
02:30:54,111 --> 02:30:56,510
I could talk to some
cat who knows Spanish.

5795
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:58,370
He and I could talk and he could,

5796
02:30:58,460 --> 02:30:59,960
I could understand what he's saying.

5797
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:04,000
It's going to come a point in time
where that is way simpler language.

5798
02:31:04,530 --> 02:31:05,750
It's going to be all the same language.

5799
02:31:05,751 --> 02:31:06,380
And then it's like,

5800
02:31:06,380 --> 02:31:07,280
why is,

5801
02:31:07,281 --> 02:31:11,540
why is there a war with Mexico
and not a war with North Dakota?

5802
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:12,231
Why?

5803
02:31:12,231 --> 02:31:17,150
Why am I not on the same team
as someone in fucking Tiawana,

5804
02:31:17,151 --> 02:31:18,200
which is right there.

5805
02:31:18,230 --> 02:31:18,990
Why am I not,

5806
02:31:18,990 --> 02:31:20,790
not just like those people?

5807
02:31:20,791 --> 02:31:24,330
Why are we on different
teams says who says why?

5808
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:25,170
What benefit is that?

5809
02:31:25,170 --> 02:31:27,290
This is some old school
shit that we only needed,

5810
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:29,760
cause he didn't know what the fuck people
are doing because it was like vikings.

5811
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:32,280
They would show up in both
start raping and murdering two,

5812
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:35,130
but they're not doing that to the
people that are in their village.

5813
02:31:35,131 --> 02:31:35,371
Right.

5814
02:31:35,371 --> 02:31:36,540
They're not doing that to each other.

5815
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:36,911
Well,

5816
02:31:36,911 --> 02:31:38,910
they do it because they
think people or the other.

5817
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:41,190
So this idea of the other
and the idea that tribe,

5818
02:31:41,191 --> 02:31:42,300
it's an outdated idea.

5819
02:31:42,570 --> 02:31:44,310
It's an outdated idea that it may be.

5820
02:31:44,311 --> 02:31:45,031
It's not time.

5821
02:31:45,031 --> 02:31:46,230
It's times not done now,

5822
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:48,990
but its time has done in a
hundred years or a thousand years.

5823
02:31:49,350 --> 02:31:50,970
The future is people,

5824
02:31:50,971 --> 02:31:51,840
just people.

5825
02:31:51,930 --> 02:31:55,950
It's not Germans versus the French
versus the Russians versus the Italians.

5826
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,450
That shit is retro.

5827
02:31:57,540 --> 02:31:58,373
It's stupid.

5828
02:31:58,620 --> 02:31:59,453
It's just like,

5829
02:31:59,570 --> 02:32:03,690
it's just like tribes of fucking ancient
hominids just sneak it in when they

5830
02:32:03,691 --> 02:32:06,360
didn't even speak languages and club
at each other and raping each other and

5831
02:32:06,361 --> 02:32:07,920
doing all the shit that
people have done forever.

5832
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:09,180
Plus California,

5833
02:32:09,181 --> 02:32:09,691
Arizona,

5834
02:32:09,691 --> 02:32:11,460
and Texas were Mexico.

5835
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,740
How about California's trying
to separate into three spots.

5836
02:32:13,890 --> 02:32:14,723
I know.

5837
02:32:15,190 --> 02:32:15,780
Yes.

5838
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:16,860
That's going to be on the ballot.

5839
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:17,820
It's going to be on the ballot in what?

5840
02:32:17,821 --> 02:32:19,230
2020 is that what it is?

5841
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:21,470
They can cause wins.

5842
02:32:21,660 --> 02:32:22,171
What happens?

5843
02:32:22,171 --> 02:32:22,561
There's going to be,

5844
02:32:22,561 --> 02:32:24,830
it's going to be fucking California south.

5845
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:25,200
Really?

5846
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:26,150
This is going to be la.

5847
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:29,220
He was going to be one that's going to
be like California and then there's going

5848
02:32:29,221 --> 02:32:30,900
to be like southern California,

5849
02:32:30,901 --> 02:32:32,820
like San Diego way up to like,

5850
02:32:32,821 --> 02:32:34,320
you know like Bakersfield or some shit.

5851
02:32:34,321 --> 02:32:36,390
It makes sense though if you're,

5852
02:32:36,391 --> 02:32:36,960
if you're gonna do,

5853
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:38,910
if you're going to go
off the old game plan,

5854
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:39,870
the old map,

5855
02:32:39,870 --> 02:32:42,330
it makes it so big.

5856
02:32:42,360 --> 02:32:43,560
This is why it makes taxes.

5857
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:46,170
If you drive from La to San Francisco,

5858
02:32:46,171 --> 02:32:47,400
you drive through Kentucky.

5859
02:32:47,401 --> 02:32:48,540
I don't know how it happens,

5860
02:32:49,050 --> 02:32:49,501
but the,

5861
02:32:49,501 --> 02:32:49,931
the you,

5862
02:32:49,931 --> 02:32:53,400
you drive by God is great
signs and don't have abortions.

5863
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:56,220
Here's a doctor or this
is Jesus loves you.

5864
02:32:56,370 --> 02:32:57,690
It's farm land.

5865
02:32:57,840 --> 02:33:00,750
It's not what you think it is and
it's nothing wrong with Kentucky.

5866
02:33:00,751 --> 02:33:01,550
I'm talking about it's,

5867
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:02,383
it's rural.

5868
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:03,241
It's rural.

5869
02:33:03,241 --> 02:33:03,691
Beautiful.

5870
02:33:03,691 --> 02:33:03,991
Yeah,

5871
02:33:03,991 --> 02:33:04,170
it's,

5872
02:33:04,170 --> 02:33:05,070
but it's rural.

5873
02:33:05,071 --> 02:33:06,270
It's farm land.

5874
02:33:06,390 --> 02:33:09,450
Like there's a big part of
California that's farms.

5875
02:33:09,451 --> 02:33:09,601
Yeah.

5876
02:33:09,601 --> 02:33:10,410
But isn't it,

5877
02:33:10,410 --> 02:33:11,230
isn't it?

5878
02:33:11,230 --> 02:33:14,850
The South is the one struggling in
the north is killing it right now.

5879
02:33:15,090 --> 02:33:15,900
We sending another,

5880
02:33:15,900 --> 02:33:16,980
it's political man.

5881
02:33:17,010 --> 02:33:17,880
It's all political.

5882
02:33:17,881 --> 02:33:18,150
Right?

5883
02:33:18,150 --> 02:33:19,710
But it's not that anybody's killing it.

5884
02:33:19,711 --> 02:33:20,281
It said the,

5885
02:33:20,281 --> 02:33:21,810
the con they don't feel represented.

5886
02:33:21,811 --> 02:33:22,230
See,

5887
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:27,230
there's more people in San Francisco and
in Los Angeles by far than the rest of

5888
02:33:27,331 --> 02:33:27,811
the state.

5889
02:33:27,811 --> 02:33:29,670
But the state is huge.

5890
02:33:29,990 --> 02:33:30,240
Like,

5891
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:30,541
you know,

5892
02:33:30,541 --> 02:33:31,260
it takes,

5893
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:32,190
you drive from,

5894
02:33:32,260 --> 02:33:35,760
everybody thinks it's San Francisco
is northern California the fuck it is.

5895
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:36,570
There's a,

5896
02:33:36,570 --> 02:33:39,780
there's hours of driving
until you hit more northern.

5897
02:33:39,781 --> 02:33:43,650
How many hours did it take to
drive from San Francisco to Oregon?

5898
02:33:43,770 --> 02:33:45,190
I want to say four.

5899
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:45,840
I think so.

5900
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:46,950
I'll say three somewhere.

5901
02:33:46,951 --> 02:33:47,910
I'll say a little bit more.

5902
02:33:47,911 --> 02:33:49,140
I'm going to say to four and a half.

5903
02:33:49,530 --> 02:33:51,030
I'm gonna say two and a half hours.

5904
02:33:52,400 --> 02:33:53,233
Was it Saint James?

5905
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:56,033
Okay.

5906
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:56,903
Um,

5907
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:57,291
I,

5908
02:33:57,291 --> 02:33:59,850
I'm saying for sticking
to for you might be right.

5909
02:33:59,910 --> 02:34:00,690
I'm just guessing,

5910
02:34:00,690 --> 02:34:01,680
but it's fucking,

5911
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:03,300
it's a grip of space.

5912
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:04,740
Five hours.

5913
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:05,401
Five hours.

5914
02:34:05,401 --> 02:34:10,080
See there's a lot of fucking space up
there and those people are all rural.

5915
02:34:10,140 --> 02:34:14,290
It's like that's where like the Green
Emerald Triangle is and Humboldt and a

5916
02:34:14,291 --> 02:34:15,700
grown all the fucking weed.

5917
02:34:15,740 --> 02:34:17,170
Beautiful as beautiful up there.

5918
02:34:17,171 --> 02:34:18,310
It's like a rain forest

5919
02:34:18,750 --> 02:34:18,940
dude.

5920
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:19,661
I've been to many,

5921
02:34:19,661 --> 02:34:21,220
many parts of northern California.

5922
02:34:21,221 --> 02:34:23,480
It doesn't even remotely
resemble Southern Cal.

5923
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:24,011
Hell No.

5924
02:34:24,011 --> 02:34:25,960
So these people didn't feel represented.

5925
02:34:26,230 --> 02:34:27,550
Alleys all goofy.

5926
02:34:27,551 --> 02:34:28,001
It's just,

5927
02:34:28,001 --> 02:34:28,350
you know,

5928
02:34:28,350 --> 02:34:32,740
they feel like this is just some liberal
delusional hotbed and they also don't

5929
02:34:32,741 --> 02:34:34,030
like a lot of the laws,

5930
02:34:34,270 --> 02:34:39,270
the laws in regards to wildlife
management mosques is like if he live in

5931
02:34:39,341 --> 02:34:42,160
Sacramento wiping the same tax
as someone that lives in Malibu.

5932
02:34:42,250 --> 02:34:42,820
Yes,

5933
02:34:42,820 --> 02:34:44,500
the taxes are off the charts here.

5934
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:47,350
They were saying that 500,000 people
this year going gonna move out of

5935
02:34:47,351 --> 02:34:50,890
California in New York because
of taxes just because of tax.

5936
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:54,250
But say he was a bit more than if you
live in Oxnard should be paying the same

5937
02:34:54,251 --> 02:34:55,084
tax zone,

5938
02:34:55,140 --> 02:34:56,140
beach front property.

5939
02:34:56,830 --> 02:34:57,700
How fucked up is that?

5940
02:34:57,701 --> 02:34:57,960
No,

5941
02:34:57,960 --> 02:34:58,793
it makes no sense.

5942
02:34:58,840 --> 02:34:59,673
But you aren't.

5943
02:34:59,860 --> 02:35:02,170
You paying more if you live in
Malibu because you're paying more,

5944
02:35:02,171 --> 02:35:03,010
you make more money.

5945
02:35:03,090 --> 02:35:03,461
So you're,

5946
02:35:03,461 --> 02:35:05,290
you're a higher percentage
of your property.

5947
02:35:05,291 --> 02:35:05,640
You know,

5948
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:05,820
your,

5949
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:07,030
your property's worth more.

5950
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:07,191
Yeah.

5951
02:35:07,191 --> 02:35:07,460
But still,

5952
02:35:07,460 --> 02:35:09,210
you're still a high fucking ready to feed,

5953
02:35:09,230 --> 02:35:10,710
not to live in California.

5954
02:35:10,711 --> 02:35:11,560
The rates ridiculous.

5955
02:35:11,561 --> 02:35:12,100
Crazy.

5956
02:35:12,100 --> 02:35:12,370
Well,

5957
02:35:12,370 --> 02:35:12,701
you know,

5958
02:35:12,701 --> 02:35:13,061
also,

5959
02:35:13,061 --> 02:35:15,580
it's ridiculous when you realize
you don't have to pay that rate.

5960
02:35:15,581 --> 02:35:16,600
If you go other places,

5961
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:18,820
like I know guys who've moved,

5962
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:19,793
what's the,

5963
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:21,160
Florida is pretty good.

5964
02:35:21,190 --> 02:35:21,761
Texas.

5965
02:35:21,761 --> 02:35:22,361
Florida is good.

5966
02:35:22,361 --> 02:35:23,230
If you have a business,

5967
02:35:23,260 --> 02:35:23,501
you know,

5968
02:35:23,501 --> 02:35:27,100
like I know guys that have businesses
that move to Florida because if they sell

5969
02:35:27,101 --> 02:35:27,611
their business,

5970
02:35:27,611 --> 02:35:31,510
they don't want to pay
13% to the government in
California and they can't text.

5971
02:35:31,511 --> 02:35:32,690
This is good thing happens.

5972
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:33,623
Um,

5973
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:35,380
there's a lot of places
we don't pay state tax,

5974
02:35:35,381 --> 02:35:36,041
Washington,

5975
02:35:36,041 --> 02:35:36,221
you know,

5976
02:35:36,221 --> 02:35:37,054
pay state tax,

5977
02:35:37,070 --> 02:35:37,661
Nevada,

5978
02:35:37,661 --> 02:35:37,991
you don't pay.

5979
02:35:37,991 --> 02:35:38,980
State tax might be,

5980
02:35:40,180 --> 02:35:43,780
I think when I'm reading right now says
this is not just the plan to split the

5981
02:35:43,781 --> 02:35:44,140
state.

5982
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:48,160
It's the split away from the United
States to make it so much of that plan.

5983
02:35:49,420 --> 02:35:50,253
Some wacky dude.

5984
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:53,170
I love,

5985
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:57,100
definitely luxury.

5986
02:35:57,101 --> 02:35:57,850
I can have,

5987
02:35:57,850 --> 02:35:59,020
I believe in luxury.

5988
02:35:59,100 --> 02:35:59,900
That's not,

5989
02:35:59,900 --> 02:36:00,611
that's not happening.

5990
02:36:00,611 --> 02:36:02,320
So that's how the Lord of the texts,

5991
02:36:02,321 --> 02:36:04,930
the big one where the business people
or people that want to save the money,

5992
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:09,460
but the United States is fascinating in
a way that you could find out where the

5993
02:36:09,461 --> 02:36:10,360
laws are best for you.

5994
02:36:10,361 --> 02:36:10,661
And you go,

5995
02:36:10,661 --> 02:36:10,871
look,

5996
02:36:10,871 --> 02:36:12,910
we're just going to fucking take
a chance and moved to Montana.

5997
02:36:13,390 --> 02:36:13,601
You know,

5998
02:36:13,601 --> 02:36:13,841
you,

5999
02:36:13,841 --> 02:36:14,710
you live in Montana,

6000
02:36:14,711 --> 02:36:17,830
you're living in a place where like 3
million people instead of 30 million

6001
02:36:17,831 --> 02:36:18,400
people.

6002
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:19,780
You live in a place where you're like,

6003
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:19,900
uh,

6004
02:36:19,900 --> 02:36:23,230
butted up against the fucking Yellowstone
park and looking at mountains and

6005
02:36:23,231 --> 02:36:23,511
shit.

6006
02:36:23,511 --> 02:36:24,610
And yet we're just at night.

6007
02:36:24,730 --> 02:36:28,660
Is it true that you could take the world's
population and fit them all in Texas,

6008
02:36:28,661 --> 02:36:29,710
all in their own house?

6009
02:36:29,740 --> 02:36:29,950
Yes,

6010
02:36:29,950 --> 02:36:30,401
that's true.

6011
02:36:30,401 --> 02:36:31,210
That's really true.

6012
02:36:31,210 --> 02:36:31,750
That's true.

6013
02:36:31,750 --> 02:36:31,960
Yeah.

6014
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:33,760
How crazy is the Texas is gigantic.

6015
02:36:33,850 --> 02:36:34,150
Well,

6016
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:38,800
but we're talking about all of China
and all of Africa in Texas with everyone

6017
02:36:38,801 --> 02:36:39,131
else.

6018
02:36:39,131 --> 02:36:42,100
There's some things about and saying
there's something about Texas where,

6019
02:36:42,101 --> 02:36:42,930
is that true?

6020
02:36:42,930 --> 02:36:43,330
Yeah,

6021
02:36:43,330 --> 02:36:43,761
that's true.

6022
02:36:43,761 --> 02:36:45,490
I amount of European countries,

6023
02:36:45,491 --> 02:36:46,570
you fit in Texas.

6024
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:47,590
It's kind of crazy.

6025
02:36:47,960 --> 02:36:48,290
You know what?

6026
02:36:48,290 --> 02:36:51,400
The whole world can fit in
Texas with their own house.

6027
02:36:51,670 --> 02:36:52,690
Everybody with their own house.

6028
02:36:53,190 --> 02:36:54,550
That seems unbelievable.

6029
02:36:54,551 --> 02:36:56,200
8 billion a billion people.

6030
02:36:57,220 --> 02:36:58,600
People in Texas and their own house,

6031
02:36:58,630 --> 02:37:00,370
a billion houses in Texas.

6032
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:01,031
You know,

6033
02:37:01,031 --> 02:37:02,880
Texas is a different state man.

6034
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:04,400
It's not like any other state.

6035
02:37:04,650 --> 02:37:08,320
They were Alaska Kulik you could do the
same thing in Alaska if everyone lived

6036
02:37:08,321 --> 02:37:09,550
in a 10 by 10 room.

6037
02:37:09,551 --> 02:37:09,850
Yeah.

6038
02:37:09,850 --> 02:37:10,091
Well,

6039
02:37:10,091 --> 02:37:11,290
Alaska is the biggest,

6040
02:37:11,291 --> 02:37:13,030
and Texas is the second pig is right,

6041
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:13,930
isn't it?

6042
02:37:13,930 --> 02:37:14,763
Yeah.

6043
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:15,713
Doesn't it seem,

6044
02:37:16,120 --> 02:37:17,240
if that's the case,

6045
02:37:18,380 --> 02:37:21,380
then the overpopulation is a myth.

6046
02:37:21,390 --> 02:37:22,430
It's gotta be no,

6047
02:37:22,431 --> 02:37:24,920
it's not a myth because it's
about the resources in space.

6048
02:37:24,921 --> 02:37:26,270
You could jam everybody in Texas,

6049
02:37:26,271 --> 02:37:27,620
but it would be like Mad Max.

6050
02:37:27,830 --> 02:37:29,510
There'll be funnel Carolyn still,

6051
02:37:29,511 --> 02:37:31,410
it'd be like there's no,

6052
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:33,360
and the rest of the world is,

6053
02:37:33,370 --> 02:37:36,350
you'd have to grow food in the rest of
the world and people would be socking it

6054
02:37:36,351 --> 02:37:39,060
out and truck loads each other.

6055
02:37:39,061 --> 02:37:40,370
That'd be on top of each other.

6056
02:37:40,430 --> 02:37:41,030
I don't know.

6057
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:41,241
No.

6058
02:37:41,241 --> 02:37:42,620
Overpopulation is not a myth.

6059
02:37:42,621 --> 02:37:44,500
Eddie overpopulation is right.

6060
02:37:44,540 --> 02:37:45,530
Everybody in Texas,

6061
02:37:45,531 --> 02:37:46,060
it's a math.

6062
02:37:46,060 --> 02:37:46,370
No,

6063
02:37:46,370 --> 02:37:46,640
no,

6064
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:46,860
no,

6065
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:46,991
no,

6066
02:37:46,991 --> 02:37:47,151
no.

6067
02:37:47,151 --> 02:37:47,870
Here's the thing.

6068
02:37:47,870 --> 02:37:48,351
First of all,

6069
02:37:48,351 --> 02:37:49,370
it's not sustainable.

6070
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:51,440
This is the problem with
overpopulation right now.

6071
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:53,600
We're okay if we just kept this number.

6072
02:37:53,810 --> 02:37:55,040
The human race could survive.

6073
02:37:55,370 --> 02:37:58,040
The real problem is we're
not keeping this number sign.

6074
02:37:58,040 --> 02:37:58,460
No,

6075
02:37:58,460 --> 02:37:59,570
this number's going to grow.

6076
02:37:59,571 --> 02:38:01,070
This number was 2 billion.

6077
02:38:01,071 --> 02:38:04,490
Whatever the fuck it was in
1950 and it's 7 billion now.

6078
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:05,000
The voice,

6079
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,070
it's the resource having less kids though.

6080
02:38:07,071 --> 02:38:09,920
Now I have so many friends in
the forties and have no kids.

6081
02:38:10,010 --> 02:38:13,250
It's not like it wasn't the fifth
shiner swirled swirling countries.

6082
02:38:13,251 --> 02:38:14,810
That's one of the things
about the rest of the world.

6083
02:38:14,811 --> 02:38:17,630
They're outbreeding US radically will not.

6084
02:38:17,631 --> 02:38:18,540
In Japan there's,

6085
02:38:18,570 --> 02:38:19,430
there's been studies.

6086
02:38:19,460 --> 02:38:20,450
Every time I'm on a plane,

6087
02:38:20,451 --> 02:38:22,730
I see emptiness in barren wasteland.

6088
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:23,451
Everywhere I go,

6089
02:38:23,451 --> 02:38:24,261
I don't see like over,

6090
02:38:24,261 --> 02:38:25,070
it's true relation.

6091
02:38:25,070 --> 02:38:26,940
I see emptiness everywhere had that.

6092
02:38:26,941 --> 02:38:27,840
He has a point here,

6093
02:38:28,530 --> 02:38:30,140
people and you fly over the country,

6094
02:38:30,141 --> 02:38:32,060
but there's places where
you can't grow shit.

6095
02:38:32,061 --> 02:38:32,660
Eddie,

6096
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:34,580
like you're flying over
Nevada and you're looking down

6097
02:38:36,460 --> 02:38:37,251
and you got to look.

6098
02:38:37,251 --> 02:38:39,920
What they did with Vegas is they
tricked everybody to thank you.

6099
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:40,910
You could live in Nevada,

6100
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:43,340
don't pay fucking fucking made that.

6101
02:38:43,370 --> 02:38:44,630
They made Henderson,

6102
02:38:44,660 --> 02:38:45,500
they made Vegas.

6103
02:38:45,501 --> 02:38:48,920
They basically built these places in a
place they shouldn't have built places.

6104
02:38:49,070 --> 02:38:50,900
They found they had a crazy rule.

6105
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:52,530
They could do whatever
the fuck they want there.

6106
02:38:52,650 --> 02:38:53,490
There's the loss.

6107
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:56,330
What's weird about Nevada is
Nevada has two weird things.

6108
02:38:56,450 --> 02:38:57,770
One nuclear testing.

6109
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:01,430
They did a fuck load of nuclear testing.

6110
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:02,510
You see the fucking,

6111
02:39:02,511 --> 02:39:05,990
there's a map or a video rather that shows
you the map of the earth and it shows

6112
02:39:05,991 --> 02:39:10,991
you all the nuclear bombs they set off
in Nevada and you're just like Macaulay

6113
02:39:11,240 --> 02:39:12,650
Culkin from alone by the end of the video.

6114
02:39:12,651 --> 02:39:15,220
Like what do you remember those old uh,

6115
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:15,770
uh,

6116
02:39:15,770 --> 02:39:18,830
nuclear test videos where they
show like a building and then like,

6117
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:22,850
I like this hurricane of
nuclear energy going through it.

6118
02:39:22,940 --> 02:39:25,220
Like what everybody remembers now,

6119
02:39:25,250 --> 02:39:25,670
right?

6120
02:39:25,670 --> 02:39:28,070
Like how did they film that?

6121
02:39:28,100 --> 02:39:29,240
They set cameras up.

6122
02:39:29,270 --> 02:39:31,020
How does the camera's dialed?

6123
02:39:31,021 --> 02:39:33,560
They had to be seen as they've
set kind of cameras are those,

6124
02:39:33,561 --> 02:39:34,010
listen,

6125
02:39:34,010 --> 02:39:37,760
they're very far away when all the
shit is going down and here's the,

6126
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:38,070
the,

6127
02:39:38,070 --> 02:39:41,930
the scariest thing is not those buildings
blowing and parts they do because they

6128
02:39:41,931 --> 02:39:42,920
got hit so hard.

6129
02:39:43,220 --> 02:39:46,430
The scariest thing is the ones when
you see the bombs and the distance that

6130
02:39:46,431 --> 02:39:48,180
miles away and these guys jump on,

6131
02:39:48,680 --> 02:39:51,080
they jump up at the shit
goes over their head,

6132
02:39:51,081 --> 02:39:54,410
they're in these ditches and they jump
up and run towards it because they didn't

6133
02:39:54,411 --> 02:39:56,690
know shit about radiation back then.

6134
02:39:56,810 --> 02:39:59,420
So they had these soldiers practice with.

6135
02:39:59,421 --> 02:40:02,630
The idea was that you would drop the
nuclear bomb on people and then they would

6136
02:40:02,631 --> 02:40:06,830
run towards the bomb because the people
would be so fucked up and disoriented

6137
02:40:06,831 --> 02:40:07,970
that you just take over the city,

6138
02:40:07,971 --> 02:40:08,930
Jesus Christ.

6139
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:09,350
But meanwhile,

6140
02:40:09,350 --> 02:40:13,260
these people were running right into
radiation grown like three eyeballs walk

6141
02:40:13,270 --> 02:40:14,103
them.

6142
02:40:14,230 --> 02:40:16,710
People in Vegas aren't
born with three heads.

6143
02:40:16,960 --> 02:40:17,581
What's not vague?

6144
02:40:17,581 --> 02:40:18,240
Some are,

6145
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:18,761
it's still,

6146
02:40:18,761 --> 02:40:20,070
it's not as big.

6147
02:40:20,310 --> 02:40:21,150
Nevada's big.

6148
02:40:21,560 --> 02:40:21,780
Yeah.

6149
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:25,520
But those nuclear test sites are
not that far from Vegas where it,

6150
02:40:25,521 --> 02:40:28,080
they're blowing up these
nuclear bombs all the time.

6151
02:40:28,320 --> 02:40:32,930
People in Vegas should be growing
fucking three dicks for the next thousand

6152
02:40:32,930 --> 02:40:32,931
years.

6153
02:40:32,931 --> 02:40:33,740
You know there,

6154
02:40:33,740 --> 02:40:38,730
there is a story about John Wayne
that John Wayne was filming a movie.

6155
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:40,560
Now when you're going
to need you on this one,

6156
02:40:40,561 --> 02:40:41,160
Jamie,

6157
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:45,780
the John Wayne was filming a movie in
like the 1950 [inaudible] whatever the

6158
02:40:45,781 --> 02:40:46,291
fuck it was.

6159
02:40:46,291 --> 02:40:50,430
He was doing those westerns
and that during that time
they were in an area where

6160
02:40:50,431 --> 02:40:51,900
they were doing tests,

6161
02:40:51,930 --> 02:40:52,763
nuclear tests,

6162
02:40:52,860 --> 02:40:55,290
and everybody on that
movie set got cancer.

6163
02:40:55,590 --> 02:40:57,780
Everybody say that again.

6164
02:40:57,810 --> 02:40:58,230
What does it,

6165
02:40:58,230 --> 02:40:59,063
what does it say there?

6166
02:40:59,070 --> 02:41:00,180
The movies so toxic.

6167
02:41:00,181 --> 02:41:01,140
It killed John Wayne.

6168
02:41:01,141 --> 02:41:02,520
The tragedy of the conqueror.

6169
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:03,270
Yeah,

6170
02:41:03,270 --> 02:41:04,103
that was about him.

6171
02:41:04,130 --> 02:41:06,630
It wasn't that king is how to
know that movie killed them.

6172
02:41:06,631 --> 02:41:09,510
I mean like how would they know when
people are getting cancer all the time?

6173
02:41:09,630 --> 02:41:09,841
No,

6174
02:41:09,841 --> 02:41:11,870
but I think a bunch of people got cancer.

6175
02:41:11,871 --> 02:41:14,100
We're getting cancer
from the polio vaccine,

6176
02:41:14,101 --> 02:41:14,940
like all of them.

6177
02:41:14,941 --> 02:41:15,774
Got It.

6178
02:41:15,790 --> 02:41:20,410
Did you know that that like a million
people for the vaccine from the polio,

6179
02:41:20,411 --> 02:41:21,320
let's to say Jamie.

6180
02:41:22,230 --> 02:41:23,063
I'll find the more,

6181
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,170
I don't even know if this is a truth.

6182
02:41:25,230 --> 02:41:26,730
You know that you know
that and you've heard that?

6183
02:41:26,750 --> 02:41:27,210
Yes.

6184
02:41:27,210 --> 02:41:28,500
I don't know if this is a true story.

6185
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:29,200
I need to,

6186
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:32,580
I need to drop some knowledge
to not drop the no knowledge.

6187
02:41:33,290 --> 02:41:34,890
I'm keeping it fun today.

6188
02:41:35,460 --> 02:41:35,761
I know,

6189
02:41:35,761 --> 02:41:37,890
but it's good points when you're flying.

6190
02:41:37,891 --> 02:41:42,090
I fly nonstop flat population.

6191
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:42,911
No Lou Shit.

6192
02:41:42,911 --> 02:41:43,744
It's the price.

6193
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:47,970
You'd have to turn all that shit into
farmland to females as people don't know

6194
02:41:47,971 --> 02:41:48,600
about that.

6195
02:41:48,600 --> 02:41:49,110
I don't know.

6196
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:49,943
Just dirt.

6197
02:41:50,730 --> 02:41:51,563
It's just dirt.

6198
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:54,360
There's definitely room.

6199
02:41:54,570 --> 02:41:56,730
The question is for how long and how much,

6200
02:41:56,760 --> 02:41:59,190
how many people can
you feed off that dirt?

6201
02:41:59,580 --> 02:42:00,630
Like if you're in Nevada,

6202
02:42:00,631 --> 02:42:01,890
how many farms are in Nevada?

6203
02:42:01,950 --> 02:42:02,551
Was the cocker,

6204
02:42:02,551 --> 02:42:03,384
what does it say?

6205
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:04,230
Scroll up.

6206
02:42:04,230 --> 02:42:04,620
Conquer.

6207
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:06,210
Filmed on a nuclear test site.

6208
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:08,033
Good move.

6209
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:09,173
Yeah.

6210
02:42:09,570 --> 02:42:10,110
Howard Hughes,

6211
02:42:10,110 --> 02:42:14,430
the Director and Bill Powell knew of the
dangers and had written assurances from

6212
02:42:14,431 --> 02:42:16,410
the Atomic Energy
Commission that it was safe.

6213
02:42:16,770 --> 02:42:19,730
But apparently that's even John
Wayne supposedly brought a Geiger,

6214
02:42:20,190 --> 02:42:20,650
I don't know.

6215
02:42:20,650 --> 02:42:22,110
This might have been too
long ago to get accurate.

6216
02:42:22,490 --> 02:42:25,700
John would con yellow face terrible.

6217
02:42:25,701 --> 02:42:26,534
Super Racist.

6218
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:27,650
It's so terrible.

6219
02:42:27,830 --> 02:42:28,840
You watch it and he's like,

6220
02:42:28,841 --> 02:42:28,991
Oh,

6221
02:42:28,991 --> 02:42:29,960
I'm gang guys caught

6222
02:42:32,330 --> 02:42:37,330
[inaudible] bout that takeover
that China to I hate old movies,

6223
02:42:38,020 --> 02:42:38,890
man.

6224
02:42:40,270 --> 02:42:45,270
I'm fighting so bad for John Wayne's

6225
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:49,190
the winds the best move all the time.

6226
02:42:49,220 --> 02:42:50,053
Fuck.

6227
02:42:51,800 --> 02:42:52,220
Hold on,

6228
02:42:52,220 --> 02:42:52,730
hold on,

6229
02:42:52,730 --> 02:42:53,563
hold on.

6230
02:42:54,590 --> 02:42:54,920
Hold on.

6231
02:42:54,920 --> 02:42:55,371
What does it say,

6232
02:42:55,371 --> 02:42:55,850
Jamie?

6233
02:42:55,850 --> 02:42:57,380
A lot of people got cancer on the set.

6234
02:42:57,790 --> 02:42:58,251
Oh Wow.

6235
02:42:58,251 --> 02:42:59,084
How many people?

6236
02:42:59,270 --> 02:43:01,610
90 of the 220 person crew did.

6237
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:03,620
46 of those people died.

6238
02:43:04,030 --> 02:43:04,760
Uh,

6239
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:05,121
some of the,

6240
02:43:05,121 --> 02:43:08,720
all the main actors apparently all died
of cancer within 25 years of the movie

6241
02:43:08,721 --> 02:43:09,554
coming out.

6242
02:43:09,690 --> 02:43:10,950
You might be able to say that about any,

6243
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:11,540
no.

6244
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:11,771
I mean,

6245
02:43:11,771 --> 02:43:13,120
so many people die of cancer.

6246
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:14,980
Isn't cancer the number one killer?

6247
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:18,450
Isn't everybody the cancers out there?

6248
02:43:19,810 --> 02:43:20,860
That's a high break,

6249
02:43:20,861 --> 02:43:21,270
dude.

6250
02:43:21,270 --> 02:43:22,230
That's not like this,

6251
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:23,650
like go back Jurassic Park.

6252
02:43:23,651 --> 02:43:24,550
Everyone's still alive.

6253
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:26,000
Those that may amaze,

6254
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:27,513
you know,

6255
02:43:27,880 --> 02:43:29,440
it'd be a lot of people like now,

6256
02:43:29,441 --> 02:43:30,101
even today,

6257
02:43:30,101 --> 02:43:33,170
these nuclear bombs were
going off in the 50s it's,

6258
02:43:33,310 --> 02:43:38,020
I don't understand who's always a
conspiracy guy doesn't recognize this

6259
02:43:38,021 --> 02:43:42,010
conspiracy that these dummies didn't
understand what the fuck they were doing.

6260
02:43:43,380 --> 02:43:43,841
They did.

6261
02:43:43,841 --> 02:43:48,841
Is conspiracy because they buddy up about
this on youtube.com was that how stuff

6262
02:43:50,961 --> 02:43:51,794
works?

6263
02:43:52,070 --> 02:43:53,740
That's mainstream right there.

6264
02:43:53,770 --> 02:43:54,461
That's the stuff.

6265
02:43:54,461 --> 02:43:56,500
works.com that's as
mainstream as you can get.

6266
02:43:56,760 --> 02:43:57,431
What does that mean?

6267
02:43:57,431 --> 02:43:58,360
You know what's mainstream?

6268
02:43:58,570 --> 02:43:59,403
The jre.

6269
02:43:59,700 --> 02:44:00,461
This is mainstream.

6270
02:44:00,461 --> 02:44:01,294
It's fun.

6271
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:02,500
As mainstream as fuck.

6272
02:44:02,501 --> 02:44:03,191
So what does that mean?

6273
02:44:03,191 --> 02:44:04,240
Downloads a day.

6274
02:44:07,240 --> 02:44:08,200
What does this mean?

6275
02:44:08,330 --> 02:44:09,610
Like what does mainstream mean?

6276
02:44:09,611 --> 02:44:10,810
It doesn't mean it's not real.

6277
02:44:10,950 --> 02:44:11,783
Just because,

6278
02:44:12,300 --> 02:44:15,540
you know what I'm saying is you said it
was a conspiracy theory and I'm like,

6279
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:15,701
no,

6280
02:44:15,701 --> 02:44:15,851
no,

6281
02:44:15,851 --> 02:44:16,684
no,

6282
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:17,753
that's not what I said.

6283
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:18,640
I said,

6284
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:21,010
the conspiracy to keep this quiet,

6285
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:25,660
the fact that the government's nuclear
tests most likely killed John Wayne and a

6286
02:44:25,661 --> 02:44:30,070
shit load of actors from
fucking cancer in the desert.

6287
02:44:30,280 --> 02:44:31,660
They were dropping bombs,

6288
02:44:31,661 --> 02:44:33,130
not knowing what the fuck they were doing.

6289
02:44:33,220 --> 02:44:35,020
And there's plenty of evidence that
they didn't know what the fuck they were

6290
02:44:35,021 --> 02:44:35,590
doing.

6291
02:44:35,590 --> 02:44:38,320
If you've watched the videos
of old nuclear test site,

6292
02:44:38,321 --> 02:44:42,670
which soldiers running towards the blast
and have you seen those fucking insane

6293
02:44:42,671 --> 02:44:44,170
thing that looks like it looks like,

6294
02:44:44,410 --> 02:44:45,080
I don't know.

6295
02:44:45,080 --> 02:44:48,430
It just like all that old footage
looks like it doesn't look authentic.

6296
02:44:48,431 --> 02:44:50,230
It looks like they faked all that shit.

6297
02:44:50,260 --> 02:44:51,093
What about

6298
02:44:54,160 --> 02:44:55,150
nuclear bombs or fake?

6299
02:44:55,180 --> 02:44:56,200
Is that what you're saying to me?

6300
02:44:56,350 --> 02:44:56,711
I,

6301
02:44:56,711 --> 02:44:57,041
you know,

6302
02:44:57,041 --> 02:44:59,890
there's a conspiracy theory that uh,

6303
02:44:59,950 --> 02:45:00,783
um,

6304
02:45:01,900 --> 02:45:04,120
nuclear bombs actually don't exist.

6305
02:45:04,500 --> 02:45:06,850
That they never actually figured it out,

6306
02:45:06,880 --> 02:45:11,140
but they realized that the threat
of nuclear bombs as good enough,

6307
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:11,661
the Eddie,

6308
02:45:11,661 --> 02:45:12,780
you can see the bottom,

6309
02:45:13,100 --> 02:45:18,100
but how do you ever see the one where
they dropped the bomb in the ocean and

6310
02:45:19,001 --> 02:45:22,270
they didn't know how much
of a blast it would create?

6311
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:26,260
What I'm saying is this
fake this when they did it,

6312
02:45:26,290 --> 02:45:29,380
but all I'm saying is how do you know
it wasn't just a regular powerful bomb?

6313
02:45:29,381 --> 02:45:30,250
Like how do you know?

6314
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:32,200
How do you know by watching a bomb go off?

6315
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:37,390
How do you know what's nuclear nuclear
nuclear bomb looks like when it blows up?

6316
02:45:37,420 --> 02:45:38,100
I don't know.

6317
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:40,480
There's irregular but don't
know how we listen to him.

6318
02:45:41,830 --> 02:45:42,300
Eddie,

6319
02:45:42,300 --> 02:45:43,120
Eddie,

6320
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:43,630
listen to him.

6321
02:45:43,630 --> 02:45:45,250
We have things that can test nuclear,

6322
02:45:45,530 --> 02:45:46,600
but I'm saying how do you,

6323
02:45:46,601 --> 02:45:47,710
how can you tell?

6324
02:45:47,740 --> 02:45:48,580
I know that you can do,

6325
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:50,500
you can do tests with those.

6326
02:45:50,501 --> 02:45:51,430
Insurance has never done.

6327
02:45:52,760 --> 02:45:53,600
I don't know.

6328
02:45:56,150 --> 02:45:57,340
Your studied in.

6329
02:45:57,790 --> 02:45:58,960
I'm saying I don't know.

6330
02:45:58,961 --> 02:45:59,261
I know,

6331
02:45:59,261 --> 02:46:00,310
but I'm saying I don't know.

6332
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:03,400
Telling you how can people look at a bomb?

6333
02:46:03,460 --> 02:46:05,410
You're saying someone else figured it out.

6334
02:46:05,530 --> 02:46:08,680
How can you look at a bomb and
thinking about shit the wrong way?

6335
02:46:08,860 --> 02:46:09,410
Really do.

6336
02:46:09,410 --> 02:46:09,531
No,

6337
02:46:09,531 --> 02:46:12,170
I'm just saying if there was
videos of 20 bombs going off,

6338
02:46:12,171 --> 02:46:14,030
would you be able to pick
out the nuclear bombs?

6339
02:46:14,090 --> 02:46:14,401
Eddie,

6340
02:46:14,401 --> 02:46:16,550
they make these giant mushroom clouds.

6341
02:46:16,551 --> 02:46:17,660
They're very unusual.

6342
02:46:17,661 --> 02:46:19,100
It's not like a regular bomb.

6343
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:22,430
I'm not saying pull that video
at the bottom of the ocean.

6344
02:46:22,431 --> 02:46:25,400
How can anybody tell like a
regular piece of that question?

6345
02:46:25,401 --> 02:46:28,490
I think you should probably
talk to a nuclear physicist.

6346
02:46:28,700 --> 02:46:29,630
Does asking questions.

6347
02:46:29,810 --> 02:46:30,530
I don't know,

6348
02:46:30,530 --> 02:46:32,390
but to question it like it's not real.

6349
02:46:32,391 --> 02:46:33,141
It's ridiculous.

6350
02:46:33,141 --> 02:46:37,190
They killed how many fucking
people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima?

6351
02:46:37,390 --> 02:46:38,760
How do you know what kind of bomb that,

6352
02:46:38,761 --> 02:46:39,594
watch this,

6353
02:46:39,650 --> 02:46:41,360
watch this bomb aren't they're still app.

6354
02:46:41,360 --> 02:46:42,193
Look at this.

6355
02:46:43,250 --> 02:46:43,820
I don't know.

6356
02:46:43,820 --> 02:46:47,750
How do you know if that's kind of bomb
that that is the craziest amount of power

6357
02:46:47,751 --> 02:46:48,980
you could ever imagine.

6358
02:46:49,250 --> 02:46:54,250
I could never imagine something that can
blow the ocean a mile into the sky and

6359
02:46:54,981 --> 02:46:56,330
that's just one video of it.

6360
02:46:56,331 --> 02:46:58,630
There's another one of those videos
where they do it from a distance.

6361
02:46:58,690 --> 02:47:00,650
You look at the water
where it's falling from.

6362
02:47:00,740 --> 02:47:01,251
I get,

6363
02:47:01,251 --> 02:47:02,031
see if he could find,

6364
02:47:02,031 --> 02:47:02,990
what do you understand?

6365
02:47:02,991 --> 02:47:04,010
It could be a nuclear bomb.

6366
02:47:04,011 --> 02:47:05,000
I'm saying all I'm saying.

6367
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:07,220
How can you know for sure?

6368
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:08,120
How can you,

6369
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:09,860
how many whales died in this?

6370
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:10,071
Oh,

6371
02:47:10,071 --> 02:47:10,820
everything died.

6372
02:47:10,820 --> 02:47:11,600
Everyone.

6373
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:12,411
They all the fish.

6374
02:47:12,411 --> 02:47:14,370
They made some tuna salad
out of that motherfucker.

6375
02:47:14,420 --> 02:47:15,140
All the fish.

6376
02:47:15,140 --> 02:47:15,470
Fuck.

6377
02:47:15,470 --> 02:47:16,161
Look at the water.

6378
02:47:16,161 --> 02:47:16,641
Come down.

6379
02:47:16,641 --> 02:47:17,660
How crazy that is.

6380
02:47:17,710 --> 02:47:19,250
What the that boat's fuck though.

6381
02:47:19,251 --> 02:47:20,084
Huh?

6382
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:20,953
Look at that.

6383
02:47:21,230 --> 02:47:21,980
Look at that.

6384
02:47:21,980 --> 02:47:22,251
Yeah.

6385
02:47:22,251 --> 02:47:22,651
I don't know.

6386
02:47:22,651 --> 02:47:24,050
If they don't know,

6387
02:47:24,650 --> 02:47:25,483
look at that.

6388
02:47:25,660 --> 02:47:25,851
That's,

6389
02:47:25,851 --> 02:47:26,684
that's high.

6390
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:27,921
That's high.

6391
02:47:27,921 --> 02:47:28,341
That's big.

6392
02:47:28,341 --> 02:47:30,710
But I don't know why
quest inventional bombs.

6393
02:47:30,740 --> 02:47:30,921
It's,

6394
02:47:30,921 --> 02:47:31,101
well,

6395
02:47:31,101 --> 02:47:31,341
what it,

6396
02:47:31,341 --> 02:47:32,174
what differences?

6397
02:47:32,290 --> 02:47:33,580
Because Eddie's Eddie's sand.

6398
02:47:33,590 --> 02:47:36,470
The reason why they threaten nuclear
bombs keep everyone kind of chill,

6399
02:47:36,471 --> 02:47:37,760
but we might not have the,

6400
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:38,790
they did.

6401
02:47:38,790 --> 02:47:40,100
They've got you don't to do that dude.

6402
02:47:40,101 --> 02:47:41,360
That would wipe out a fucking city.

6403
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:44,480
But maybe you could do that with
just regular conventional bombs.

6404
02:47:44,481 --> 02:47:45,290
Maybe he just,

6405
02:47:45,290 --> 02:47:46,550
maybe that's like 10.

6406
02:47:47,350 --> 02:47:47,991
What you're saying is,

6407
02:47:47,991 --> 02:47:48,824
I don't know.

6408
02:47:49,030 --> 02:47:49,190
Well,

6409
02:47:49,190 --> 02:47:49,971
you should find out.

6410
02:47:49,971 --> 02:47:51,880
I don't know by this is,

6411
02:47:51,881 --> 02:47:52,970
this is a nuclear bomb.

6412
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:53,350
Okay.

6413
02:47:53,350 --> 02:47:57,170
And the scientists all agree there's no
conspiracy conspiracy's amongst idiots

6414
02:47:57,410 --> 02:47:58,940
because people that are
talking about it online,

6415
02:47:58,941 --> 02:48:01,910
they literally have no idea what they're
talking about and they're spreading

6416
02:48:01,930 --> 02:48:02,650
this.

6417
02:48:02,650 --> 02:48:03,080
Don't know.

6418
02:48:03,080 --> 02:48:03,651
I understand.

6419
02:48:03,651 --> 02:48:04,430
I don't understand.

6420
02:48:04,430 --> 02:48:04,761
You don't know,

6421
02:48:04,761 --> 02:48:05,390
but don't even bother.

6422
02:48:05,390 --> 02:48:05,721
Question.

6423
02:48:05,721 --> 02:48:06,620
It's a waste of time.

6424
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:07,150
It's a,

6425
02:48:07,150 --> 02:48:07,430
it's a,

6426
02:48:07,430 --> 02:48:09,470
you're going down a
rabbit hole for no reason.

6427
02:48:09,700 --> 02:48:10,491
It wastes all his time.

6428
02:48:10,491 --> 02:48:11,001
How do you know?

6429
02:48:11,001 --> 02:48:11,451
How do you know?

6430
02:48:11,451 --> 02:48:12,050
How do you know?

6431
02:48:12,050 --> 02:48:13,160
I don't need to know.

6432
02:48:13,190 --> 02:48:13,981
What do you care about me?

6433
02:48:13,981 --> 02:48:14,814
What's going on?

6434
02:48:15,160 --> 02:48:15,690
I go away.

6435
02:48:15,690 --> 02:48:17,210
I could waste my time on whatever.

6436
02:48:17,211 --> 02:48:17,431
Why?

6437
02:48:17,431 --> 02:48:18,290
Because I'm concerned.

6438
02:48:18,560 --> 02:48:20,070
Why are you so concerned
about me and wasting money?

6439
02:48:20,071 --> 02:48:21,980
Because you waste our time to why?

6440
02:48:22,040 --> 02:48:24,720
It's an interesting conversation
whether or not nuclear bombs,

6441
02:48:25,790 --> 02:48:26,650
we don't have to talk about.

6442
02:48:26,710 --> 02:48:28,130
Why don't you want to
find the answer to it?

6443
02:48:28,190 --> 02:48:29,270
Why did you just want to question it?

6444
02:48:29,390 --> 02:48:30,223
You could look up,

6445
02:48:31,180 --> 02:48:32,000
you could look up.

6446
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:32,211
Yeah,

6447
02:48:32,211 --> 02:48:33,160
you could look up anything.

6448
02:48:33,161 --> 02:48:33,994
It's not going to look up.

6449
02:48:34,250 --> 02:48:36,800
If you will really want to know the
answer to this particular question.

6450
02:48:36,890 --> 02:48:37,960
You could look it up and I'm going,

6451
02:48:37,980 --> 02:48:38,220
no,

6452
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:39,500
no library.

6453
02:48:40,180 --> 02:48:40,310
No,

6454
02:48:40,310 --> 02:48:40,820
no.

6455
02:48:40,820 --> 02:48:41,900
You could go to college.

6456
02:48:42,440 --> 02:48:43,580
You could get a professor.

6457
02:48:43,730 --> 02:48:46,490
You could find any number of
people that have the answers,

6458
02:48:46,820 --> 02:48:48,100
could show you how to study them.

6459
02:48:48,500 --> 02:48:49,430
Could prove the test too.

6460
02:48:49,431 --> 02:48:50,780
You could lay it out.

6461
02:48:51,050 --> 02:48:53,930
It could give you all of
these instructions so you
could go do it on your own

6462
02:48:53,931 --> 02:48:55,940
without anybody else
care about it that much.

6463
02:48:56,390 --> 02:48:56,870
Then why?

6464
02:48:56,870 --> 02:48:57,231
Then why?

6465
02:48:57,231 --> 02:48:58,300
Again and Joe's Joe's point.

6466
02:48:58,301 --> 02:48:58,880
I just,

6467
02:48:58,880 --> 02:48:59,713
I just,

6468
02:49:00,020 --> 02:49:02,600
I just don't trust anything
I can verify for myself.

6469
02:49:02,950 --> 02:49:04,540
You don't have to get mad
at you because of that.

6470
02:49:04,610 --> 02:49:05,151
Why you mad?

6471
02:49:05,151 --> 02:49:06,680
Because you're getting mad right now.

6472
02:49:07,170 --> 02:49:08,640
I don't trust shit from the government.

6473
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:11,310
You can verify this.

6474
02:49:11,311 --> 02:49:12,031
You just said you can't,

6475
02:49:12,031 --> 02:49:12,864
but you can.

6476
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:13,590
That's,

6477
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:15,630
that's the issue on some of
these things with science.

6478
02:49:16,020 --> 02:49:16,860
They are fair.

6479
02:49:17,240 --> 02:49:18,073
Yes.

6480
02:49:18,570 --> 02:49:21,390
I went to fucking
physics class at college.

6481
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:22,253
I got an a,

6482
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:25,600
so that proves the nuclear bombs.

6483
02:49:26,940 --> 02:49:28,110
I didn't make it to that fireworks.

6484
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:29,071
I quit college.

6485
02:49:29,071 --> 02:49:30,690
I didn't keep going down the nuclear club.

6486
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:33,570
That's farther in than physics
one 11 and one 12 at Ohio state.

6487
02:49:33,571 --> 02:49:36,560
They don't give it to
the freshmen high lows.

6488
02:49:38,610 --> 02:49:39,120
That's it.

6489
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:39,451
I mean,

6490
02:49:39,451 --> 02:49:40,320
if you want the answers,

6491
02:49:40,321 --> 02:49:41,101
you can go get them.

6492
02:49:41,101 --> 02:49:42,390
It's not just question the world.

6493
02:49:42,391 --> 02:49:42,661
Why?

6494
02:49:42,661 --> 02:49:45,070
It's frustrating because
you don't want the answers.

6495
02:49:45,090 --> 02:49:49,290
You just want to question everything
that in air quotes government says

6496
02:49:52,590 --> 02:49:53,550
it's frustrating.

6497
02:49:53,640 --> 02:49:54,150
Why?

6498
02:49:54,150 --> 02:49:59,100
Because the world being flat because
nuclear bombs being fake because dinosaurs

6499
02:49:59,101 --> 02:49:59,934
not being real.

6500
02:50:00,050 --> 02:50:01,320
All those things are crazy.

6501
02:50:02,220 --> 02:50:04,440
They're a giant waste of time for who?

6502
02:50:04,500 --> 02:50:05,333
For us.

6503
02:50:05,700 --> 02:50:06,970
When we're talking to
talking about something,

6504
02:50:06,971 --> 02:50:07,620
no.

6505
02:50:07,620 --> 02:50:07,891
Okay,

6506
02:50:07,891 --> 02:50:09,840
but you will bite talking
about those things.

6507
02:50:09,900 --> 02:50:10,051
Hey,

6508
02:50:10,051 --> 02:50:11,130
I didn't bring up nuclear bombs.

6509
02:50:11,131 --> 02:50:11,964
You guys did.

6510
02:50:12,340 --> 02:50:13,051
I didn't bring it up,

6511
02:50:13,051 --> 02:50:15,900
but you really argued it for a while.

6512
02:50:15,930 --> 02:50:18,180
I'm just bringing up questions
and you're getting angry.

6513
02:50:18,181 --> 02:50:19,130
Not Angry at e.

6514
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:19,440
Okay,

6515
02:50:19,440 --> 02:50:20,130
good.

6516
02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:21,670
Do you hear me being angry right now?

6517
02:50:22,050 --> 02:50:23,160
You guys sounded angry.

6518
02:50:23,161 --> 02:50:24,150
You said you were frustrated.

6519
02:50:24,151 --> 02:50:26,550
Frustration usually is,

6520
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:27,840
is in there with anger.

6521
02:50:27,870 --> 02:50:28,350
Anger.

6522
02:50:28,350 --> 02:50:29,183
I'm just saying it.

6523
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:31,860
The one fun point and
he was making is like,

6524
02:50:31,861 --> 02:50:32,100
man,

6525
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:34,950
I don't know nuclear science
or anything like that,

6526
02:50:34,951 --> 02:50:37,050
so how do you know those that
I'm bumps a real computer,

6527
02:50:37,051 --> 02:50:37,884
regular bomb.

6528
02:50:37,890 --> 02:50:39,240
It was a fun conversation.

6529
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:41,500
That's it just makes up a,

6530
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:42,840
you're fucking calves.

6531
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:45,570
Jamie got named seven tomorrow morning.

6532
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:47,620
Turn in game seven the game.

6533
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:51,060
You can look into a lot of this
stuff and you can't find the answers.

6534
02:50:51,330 --> 02:50:51,761
That's all I,

6535
02:50:51,761 --> 02:50:53,850
that's my only point and
when you're talking over me,

6536
02:50:53,851 --> 02:50:55,110
that's where the frustration comes from.

6537
02:50:55,111 --> 02:50:55,530
That's it.

6538
02:50:55,530 --> 02:50:56,610
You're angry.

6539
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:57,480
I'm not angry.

6540
02:50:57,480 --> 02:51:00,630
You get angry at bed Stuy
town people to not get angry.

6541
02:51:00,631 --> 02:51:04,230
You using that as a defensive tactic
because he's making a good point because

6542
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:05,850
saying people are angry.

6543
02:51:06,210 --> 02:51:07,043
Okay,

6544
02:51:07,210 --> 02:51:07,590
you,

6545
02:51:07,590 --> 02:51:08,070
you got,

6546
02:51:08,070 --> 02:51:09,030
you say it's frustrating.

6547
02:51:09,031 --> 02:51:09,841
So as we can say,

6548
02:51:09,841 --> 02:51:12,570
it's my angry because you don't
believe in the government.

6549
02:51:12,570 --> 02:51:13,231
You're angry.

6550
02:51:13,231 --> 02:51:14,280
I don't trust the government.

6551
02:51:14,550 --> 02:51:15,360
You could say that.

6552
02:51:15,360 --> 02:51:15,661
We can say,

6553
02:51:15,661 --> 02:51:16,494
why are you angry?

6554
02:51:16,670 --> 02:51:17,503
Do say that.

6555
02:51:18,300 --> 02:51:19,950
Now we could say that to you.

6556
02:51:20,550 --> 02:51:21,780
We can say why you angry.

6557
02:51:21,781 --> 02:51:23,190
That doesn't get anybody anywhere.

6558
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:26,430
We're just talking about
the reality of these facts.

6559
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:28,410
You guys can believe whatever you want.

6560
02:51:30,240 --> 02:51:31,073
Okay.

6561
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:32,220
All right.

6562
02:51:32,220 --> 02:51:32,970
I will.

6563
02:51:32,970 --> 02:51:33,600
Okay.

6564
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:35,670
I believe everything I've
been taught and learned,

6565
02:51:36,330 --> 02:51:37,230
go right ahead.

6566
02:51:37,290 --> 02:51:39,720
I think that doesn't frustrate me.

6567
02:51:39,960 --> 02:51:40,890
I don't care what you think,

6568
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:42,780
but am I wrong then?

6569
02:51:42,870 --> 02:51:43,703
No,

6570
02:51:44,070 --> 02:51:45,220
you can believe whatever you want to.

6571
02:51:45,221 --> 02:51:46,690
Why would you continue to question that?

6572
02:51:47,010 --> 02:51:47,700
Hey Brennan,

6573
02:51:47,700 --> 02:51:48,533
that's a nice shirt.

6574
02:51:48,570 --> 02:51:48,791
Hey,

6575
02:51:48,791 --> 02:51:50,360
does that kind of goes in right?

6576
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:53,490
Cheryl is flowers.

6577
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:54,900
Floral is in right now.

6578
02:51:54,901 --> 02:51:56,040
Like Hawaii's track.

6579
02:51:56,070 --> 02:51:56,890
If you go to Hawaii,

6580
02:51:56,890 --> 02:51:58,500
make sure you wear a nice Hawaiian print.

6581
02:51:58,560 --> 02:51:59,301
It's in floral.

6582
02:51:59,301 --> 02:52:02,670
Joe and I ended up
wearing a Hawaiian shirt,

6583
02:52:02,671 --> 02:52:05,680
like with the buttons because it was
the only time you should wear soldiers.

6584
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:06,910
They're in right now.

6585
02:52:07,050 --> 02:52:07,883
They're in right now.

6586
02:52:08,050 --> 02:52:10,000
I used to wear those on
stage like an asshole.

6587
02:52:10,030 --> 02:52:11,440
Did you really thought they were cute,

6588
02:52:11,530 --> 02:52:11,801
Tommy,

6589
02:52:11,801 --> 02:52:12,640
but they're back now,

6590
02:52:12,641 --> 02:52:13,330
so he'd be good.

6591
02:52:13,330 --> 02:52:13,810
Oh,

6592
02:52:13,810 --> 02:52:14,290
they're back.

6593
02:52:14,290 --> 02:52:15,550
You know what's in.

6594
02:52:15,551 --> 02:52:15,880
Do you know?

6595
02:52:15,880 --> 02:52:17,770
Do you have any idea at
all what's fashionable?

6596
02:52:17,830 --> 02:52:18,663
Not at all.

6597
02:52:18,870 --> 02:52:22,740
No chance from 10 years
ago and the fact like,

6598
02:52:23,020 --> 02:52:23,890
I liked fashion,

6599
02:52:23,910 --> 02:52:24,820
but why are you into fashion?

6600
02:52:24,850 --> 02:52:25,301
I don't know.

6601
02:52:25,301 --> 02:52:25,991
Since I was a kid,

6602
02:52:25,991 --> 02:52:27,100
I was super into fashion.

6603
02:52:27,370 --> 02:52:28,450
I just love fashion.

6604
02:52:28,770 --> 02:52:29,290
Huh?

6605
02:52:29,290 --> 02:52:29,621
I don't know.

6606
02:52:29,621 --> 02:52:33,280
I couldn't tell you why collect
shoes like the trendy shit,

6607
02:52:33,310 --> 02:52:34,450
whatever's going on,

6608
02:52:34,451 --> 02:52:36,160
but you're one of the rare straight guys.

6609
02:52:36,161 --> 02:52:36,731
It's really,

6610
02:52:36,731 --> 02:52:38,650
I know you'd think I'd suck a ton of debt.

6611
02:52:39,180 --> 02:52:40,550
You conspiracy theory,

6612
02:52:40,660 --> 02:52:42,070
you really do enjoy it.

6613
02:52:42,130 --> 02:52:42,640
Love it.

6614
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:44,380
Like you like funky shoes.

6615
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:45,960
I said I got a job on either.

6616
02:52:45,980 --> 02:52:46,241
They're like,

6617
02:52:46,241 --> 02:52:46,410
well,

6618
02:52:46,410 --> 02:52:47,530
you're not gambling.

6619
02:52:47,531 --> 02:52:47,771
No,

6620
02:52:47,771 --> 02:52:48,850
I'm just super into fashion.

6621
02:52:50,380 --> 02:52:55,090
Girls like this that are in the fashion
generally and genuinely likes it.

6622
02:52:55,220 --> 02:52:55,410
Yeah,

6623
02:52:55,410 --> 02:52:55,980
I love it.

6624
02:52:55,980 --> 02:52:56,860
You like looking good?

6625
02:52:56,890 --> 02:52:59,080
I read about a Gq magazine,

6626
02:52:59,081 --> 02:52:59,890
all that stuff.

6627
02:52:59,890 --> 02:53:00,723
Oh Shit.

6628
02:53:01,510 --> 02:53:02,343
Oh

6629
02:53:03,360 --> 02:53:03,690
Shit.

6630
02:53:03,690 --> 02:53:04,960
You're special in Boston.

6631
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:07,540
I raised the texts cause
I was gonna be like,

6632
02:53:07,541 --> 02:53:07,781
dude,

6633
02:53:07,781 --> 02:53:08,531
what are you going to wear?

6634
02:53:08,531 --> 02:53:09,190
And I was like,

6635
02:53:09,190 --> 02:53:10,410
I'm not going to send that to him because

6636
02:53:12,800 --> 02:53:13,633
that's funny.

6637
02:53:13,900 --> 02:53:14,800
That goes through my head,

6638
02:53:14,801 --> 02:53:15,310
man.

6639
02:53:15,310 --> 02:53:17,170
I've outfits picked out weeks before.

6640
02:53:17,171 --> 02:53:17,470
If I've,

6641
02:53:17,470 --> 02:53:19,970
if I have a show in a wait a minute,

6642
02:53:21,790 --> 02:53:22,660
shows in Minnesota,

6643
02:53:22,661 --> 02:53:23,860
have my outfits already picked up?

6644
02:53:24,040 --> 02:53:24,570
Damn.

6645
02:53:24,570 --> 02:53:25,040
Yeah.

6646
02:53:25,040 --> 02:53:25,250
Yeah.

6647
02:53:25,250 --> 02:53:25,961
Just terrible.

6648
02:53:25,961 --> 02:53:26,794
Always.

6649
02:53:26,860 --> 02:53:26,981
No,

6650
02:53:26,981 --> 02:53:27,521
it's your stuff.

6651
02:53:27,521 --> 02:53:28,271
It's not terrible.

6652
02:53:28,271 --> 02:53:28,810
It's not,

6653
02:53:28,810 --> 02:53:29,980
you don't dress like an asshole.

6654
02:53:30,010 --> 02:53:30,850
You make an effort.

6655
02:53:30,940 --> 02:53:31,750
Thank you very much.

6656
02:53:31,750 --> 02:53:32,260
Yeah.

6657
02:53:32,260 --> 02:53:32,680
I work.

6658
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:33,940
Shirts are too big for me.

6659
02:53:35,080 --> 02:53:35,650
They don't,

6660
02:53:35,650 --> 02:53:36,580
they don't fit me right.

6661
02:53:36,760 --> 02:53:38,230
I just wear a 10th planet shirts.

6662
02:53:38,310 --> 02:53:39,143
That's a good agency.

6663
02:53:39,190 --> 02:53:41,860
Sure that your business shirts,

6664
02:53:42,220 --> 02:53:42,910
they're free.

6665
02:53:42,910 --> 02:53:46,210
What do you do when your style dies off?

6666
02:53:46,270 --> 02:53:47,290
Do you get rid of the clothes?

6667
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:48,520
Salvation Army.

6668
02:53:48,521 --> 02:53:49,240
You got to get coffee.

6669
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:49,691
I'd get rid of,

6670
02:53:49,691 --> 02:53:50,800
I'd give it to salvation army.

6671
02:53:51,370 --> 02:53:52,030
I knew it.

6672
02:53:52,030 --> 02:53:53,650
So you're not even
stockpiling the old shit.

6673
02:53:53,651 --> 02:53:55,160
You don't be caught dead
with the most house,

6674
02:53:55,590 --> 02:53:56,423
your house?

6675
02:53:57,120 --> 02:53:57,953
Hell No.

6676
02:53:58,360 --> 02:54:01,400
How many pairs of shoes and
sneakers do you keep it at any time?

6677
02:54:02,170 --> 02:54:03,500
Probably have around 150 right.

6678
02:54:03,501 --> 02:54:04,334
I know

6679
02:54:05,230 --> 02:54:09,070
what young Jamie can relate to
that a hundred hundred 50 shoes.

6680
02:54:09,071 --> 02:54:09,450
Yeah,

6681
02:54:09,450 --> 02:54:10,283
that is so,

6682
02:54:10,650 --> 02:54:14,280
and then now you know what's happening
is I post on my Instagram story like sh

6683
02:54:14,320 --> 02:54:16,120
look kicks of the day or you know,

6684
02:54:16,121 --> 02:54:17,840
studio kicks and they'll come to me.

6685
02:54:17,841 --> 02:54:18,940
They're sending me shoes.

6686
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:19,990
So I post on there.

6687
02:54:20,170 --> 02:54:21,310
It's a vicious cycle.

6688
02:54:21,730 --> 02:54:22,650
This Ninja warrior,

6689
02:54:22,960 --> 02:54:23,920
it's ridiculous.

6690
02:54:24,390 --> 02:54:27,600
It's Ninja Warrior Shit is going on
in between Scientology commercials.

6691
02:54:27,640 --> 02:54:28,660
When you guys are gonna look up earlier.

6692
02:54:28,661 --> 02:54:28,961
Fleas.

6693
02:54:28,961 --> 02:54:29,794
Herring.

6694
02:54:30,010 --> 02:54:30,150
Well,

6695
02:54:30,150 --> 02:54:30,960
how'd she do?

6696
02:54:30,960 --> 02:54:31,830
She didn't do good.

6697
02:54:32,290 --> 02:54:33,070
It's tough.

6698
02:54:33,070 --> 02:54:33,881
Unless it's your thing.

6699
02:54:33,881 --> 02:54:36,910
It's fucking tough man digging.

6700
02:54:36,911 --> 02:54:38,380
I'm sure it's not very,

6701
02:54:38,381 --> 02:54:39,430
you guys aren't gonna dig it.

6702
02:54:39,431 --> 02:54:40,210
Your wife wells,

6703
02:54:40,210 --> 02:54:41,290
that Peloton bike.

6704
02:54:41,770 --> 02:54:42,510
You liked that?

6705
02:54:42,510 --> 02:54:44,310
I fuck I on the couch.

6706
02:54:44,320 --> 02:54:46,210
I can do as good 45 minute class.

6707
02:54:46,490 --> 02:54:48,100
I only fuck with Robyn Nyc.

6708
02:54:48,101 --> 02:54:49,120
She's a little beast on there.

6709
02:54:49,121 --> 02:54:51,350
I refer refuse to use anyone else seated.

6710
02:54:51,370 --> 02:54:52,320
People love those things.

6711
02:54:52,330 --> 02:54:53,051
It's fun man.

6712
02:54:53,051 --> 02:54:53,884
I love him.

6713
02:54:53,890 --> 02:54:56,380
I still box and shit like that's
quit looking at me like that.

6714
02:54:56,381 --> 02:54:57,040
Any but I,

6715
02:54:57,040 --> 02:54:58,150
I jumped on a bike man.

6716
02:54:58,600 --> 02:54:59,410
Nothing wrong with that.

6717
02:54:59,410 --> 02:55:00,243
Yeah.

6718
02:55:00,700 --> 02:55:01,720
I like being outside,

6719
02:55:01,721 --> 02:55:02,100
man.

6720
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:04,490
I like running hills so much.

6721
02:55:04,510 --> 02:55:05,181
My Cardio,

6722
02:55:05,181 --> 02:55:07,800
I try to do all outside that.

6723
02:55:07,880 --> 02:55:08,420
Um,

6724
02:55:08,420 --> 02:55:11,660
I have that rowing machine
thing and then the air bike,

6725
02:55:11,940 --> 02:55:14,420
my problem is like fuck
me on set at seven.

6726
02:55:14,421 --> 02:55:18,890
Let me until you leave the house at five
45 so I'll get up at four 30 knocked

6727
02:55:18,910 --> 02:55:19,490
that out.

6728
02:55:19,490 --> 02:55:20,520
So just someone else.

6729
02:55:22,310 --> 02:55:24,080
How often do you do fighter and the kid?

6730
02:55:24,620 --> 02:55:25,453
Twice a week.

6731
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:29,060
And then big brown breakdown
below the belt podcast.

6732
02:55:29,061 --> 02:55:32,060
Monday mornings then shoot
brown breakdown anymore.

6733
02:55:32,061 --> 02:55:33,290
It's below the belts on.

6734
02:55:33,350 --> 02:55:34,183
Why'd you change it?

6735
02:55:34,770 --> 02:55:35,020
Uh,

6736
02:55:35,020 --> 02:55:38,630
they get a shot from time the
government came to forced,

6737
02:55:39,620 --> 02:55:40,453
they forced him.

6738
02:55:40,850 --> 02:55:42,980
I just made it all in sync
with the show on showtime.

6739
02:55:43,010 --> 02:55:43,611
First of all,

6740
02:55:43,611 --> 02:55:46,220
using big brown is now
cultural appropriation,

6741
02:55:46,250 --> 02:55:47,083
correct.

6742
02:55:47,940 --> 02:55:48,260
That.

6743
02:55:48,260 --> 02:55:49,430
I know they called you big brown,

6744
02:55:49,431 --> 02:55:50,510
but you can't use it anymore.

6745
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:51,270
No.

6746
02:55:51,270 --> 02:55:52,280
Cause you're not brown enough.

6747
02:55:52,460 --> 02:55:54,260
Not Brown enough shame that a DNA test.

6748
02:55:54,260 --> 02:55:56,750
You get some 23 and me and find
out you got something menu.

6749
02:55:56,780 --> 02:55:58,730
Did you really get in trouble
for you as in big browns break?

6750
02:55:58,840 --> 02:56:00,620
Right then you might have some
you just didn't like it no more.

6751
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:00,930
No,

6752
02:56:00,930 --> 02:56:01,640
I liked it.

6753
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:02,271
I liked it,

6754
02:56:02,271 --> 02:56:03,440
but I was doing uh,

6755
02:56:03,530 --> 02:56:03,690
the,

6756
02:56:03,690 --> 02:56:04,730
I got my show on showtime.

6757
02:56:04,731 --> 02:56:05,301
Blow the bell.

6758
02:56:05,301 --> 02:56:05,891
So you kill him.

6759
02:56:05,891 --> 02:56:07,040
So the pot I didn't kill.

6760
02:56:07,041 --> 02:56:08,240
It's the exact same show.

6761
02:56:08,241 --> 02:56:09,800
I just want it all the same brand.

6762
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:12,770
What if you had like
with rock below the belt?

6763

03:00:30,910 --> 03:00:33,970
Cause all he says the word all the time.

6934
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:34,833
All the time.

6935
03:00:35,140 --> 03:00:35,591
All the time.

6936
03:00:35,591 --> 03:00:36,041
It's okay.

6937
03:00:36,041 --> 03:00:37,120
No one's kicking his ass.

6938
03:00:37,150 --> 03:00:37,400
Yeah,

6939
03:00:37,400 --> 03:00:40,950
it's totally a quarter Puerto Rican so
they can do that up there and do it.

6940
03:00:41,200 --> 03:00:43,650
He looks like a regular
Mexican guy from loose la.

6941
03:00:44,040 --> 03:00:44,501
It means,

6942
03:00:44,501 --> 03:00:45,071
can't say that,

6943
03:00:45,071 --> 03:00:45,881
but put her Riggins Ken,

6944
03:00:45,881 --> 03:00:46,714
how weird is that?

6945
03:00:47,030 --> 03:00:47,290
Have you,

6946
03:00:47,290 --> 03:00:48,123
have you seen him?

6947
03:00:48,370 --> 03:00:49,151
Have you seen him before?

6948
03:00:49,151 --> 03:00:49,720
He went on.

6949
03:00:49,720 --> 03:00:53,260
He has songs were in the courses where
he's using the and it's part of the

6950
03:00:53,261 --> 03:00:53,711
music.

6951
03:00:53,711 --> 03:00:54,340
Yeah.

6952
03:00:54,340 --> 03:00:57,340
He said he's going to do that
if you Puerto Rican down.

6953
03:00:57,580 --> 03:00:58,010
Yeah.

6954
03:00:58,010 --> 03:00:58,571
I think guys,

6955
03:00:58,571 --> 03:01:00,030
they got through some

6956
03:01:00,050 --> 03:01:03,340
rail grays law six
number one hits in a row.

6957
03:01:03,370 --> 03:01:04,203
He's killing it.

6958
03:01:04,450 --> 03:01:05,680
He has rainbow hair.

6959
03:01:05,980 --> 03:01:07,150
He's got Rainbow Grill,

6960
03:01:07,180 --> 03:01:08,390
he's going to rainbow grill now.

6961
03:01:08,840 --> 03:01:13,840
New Tattoo was 69 on his face and he
has done and also that monster from saw

6962
03:01:14,750 --> 03:01:19,750
that he has 69 [inaudible] 69 towards
Jamie forced me into watching him.

6963
03:01:21,610 --> 03:01:22,090
He has,

6964
03:01:22,090 --> 03:01:24,880
he has 69 tattooed 69 times on his body.

6965
03:01:24,881 --> 03:01:26,110
Is that the ones who
was the one who told me?

6966
03:01:26,140 --> 03:01:28,160
I think let me see his face.

6967
03:01:28,840 --> 03:01:29,710
The new grill.

6968
03:01:29,980 --> 03:01:32,290
Cause the new grill is off the charts.

6969
03:01:32,320 --> 03:01:35,080
It looks like a dude from east La
and me while we're talking about him.

6970
03:01:35,081 --> 03:01:35,914
So he wins.

6971
03:01:36,020 --> 03:01:36,770
Yeah he does.

6972
03:01:36,770 --> 03:01:38,470
But he's a terrible follow dude.

6973
03:01:39,370 --> 03:01:40,810
I watch every post.

6974
03:01:40,870 --> 03:01:41,380
What?

6975
03:01:41,380 --> 03:01:42,041
He's in trouble for.

6976
03:01:42,041 --> 03:01:42,251
What?

6977
03:01:42,251 --> 03:01:43,001
For pedophile?

6978
03:01:43,001 --> 03:01:44,080
For 13 year old.

6979
03:01:44,110 --> 03:01:44,620
Come on.

6980
03:01:44,620 --> 03:01:44,771
Yeah,

6981
03:01:44,771 --> 03:01:45,730
he's catching a case.

6982
03:01:45,790 --> 03:01:46,391
How old is he?

6983
03:01:46,391 --> 03:01:47,150
That's what my friends say.

6984
03:01:47,150 --> 03:01:47,860
Catching case.

6985
03:01:47,860 --> 03:01:48,581
Catching a case.

6986
03:01:48,581 --> 03:01:49,540
You're like down the street.

6987
03:01:49,780 --> 03:01:49,961
Look,

6988
03:01:49,961 --> 03:01:53,750
he's got a spiderweb tattoo
and I was faced with that saga.

6989
03:01:53,950 --> 03:01:57,700
What's that saw guy's name
pinwheel or something like that.

6990
03:01:57,720 --> 03:01:58,250
Pinhead.

6991
03:01:58,250 --> 03:01:59,110
Scary Shit though.

6992
03:01:59,320 --> 03:02:00,610
Did anyone see the new salt?

6993
03:02:00,700 --> 03:02:01,720
Would that just that guy.

6994
03:02:01,721 --> 03:02:02,554
Jigsaw.

6995
03:02:02,650 --> 03:02:03,131
Jigsaw.

6996
03:02:03,131 --> 03:02:03,964
Jigsaw.

6997
03:02:04,030 --> 03:02:04,211
Look,

6998
03:02:04,211 --> 03:02:07,390
he's got 69 on his belly that
looks like markers on him.

6999
03:02:07,540 --> 03:02:11,190
He just lost is a $5 million headphone
yo cause of what happened at the Broner

7000
03:02:11,200 --> 03:02:11,740
fight.

7001
03:02:11,740 --> 03:02:12,520
What happened?

7002
03:02:12,520 --> 03:02:14,530
He was in a beef with Adrian Broner.

7003
03:02:14,710 --> 03:02:15,430
Who's that?

7004
03:02:15,430 --> 03:02:16,540
The kind of fight a boxer,

7005
03:02:16,640 --> 03:02:21,400
boxer bet and I guess somebody in his
crew and there was a beef with another

7006
03:02:21,401 --> 03:02:21,600
fee,

7007
03:02:21,600 --> 03:02:23,140
a rapper and a gun went off.

7008
03:02:23,230 --> 03:02:23,531
Oh,

7009
03:02:23,531 --> 03:02:24,750
it's the backstage lost.

7010
03:02:24,780 --> 03:02:25,100
He lost.

7011
03:02:25,100 --> 03:02:28,190
I said fun deal because damn it and how
many million dollars was hell phone,

7012
03:02:28,250 --> 03:02:33,130
$5 million for a headphone he does is
get on Instagram and just throw money.

7013
03:02:33,160 --> 03:02:33,730
I saw.

7014
03:02:33,730 --> 03:02:34,241
It's crazy.

7015
03:02:34,241 --> 03:02:36,430
It makes me watch and
he makes hits though.

7016
03:02:36,490 --> 03:02:37,151
That's what he's getting.

7017
03:02:37,151 --> 03:02:37,510
His money.

7018
03:02:37,510 --> 03:02:38,040
His fame.

7019
03:02:38,040 --> 03:02:38,590
Yeah.

7020
03:02:38,590 --> 03:02:40,930
Six number one songs in a row.

7021
03:02:40,980 --> 03:02:41,830
It's crazy world.

7022
03:02:41,831 --> 03:02:43,720
We live in a bravo fucking nuts.

7023
03:02:44,110 --> 03:02:45,070
It's crazy world.

7024
03:02:46,030 --> 03:02:46,301
Yeah,

7025
03:02:46,301 --> 03:02:46,680
go ahead.

7026
03:02:46,680 --> 03:02:48,160
Go to that middle one with his grill.

7027
03:02:48,940 --> 03:02:49,773
Look at that.

7028
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:51,220
Click on that video.

7029
03:02:51,630 --> 03:02:52,121
Listen to them,

7030
03:02:52,121 --> 03:02:54,430
listen to them to that.

7031
03:02:54,530 --> 03:02:55,940
I want to show off these.

7032
03:02:57,630 --> 03:02:58,700
How can you chew what they got?

7033
03:02:58,701 --> 03:03:00,080
Like Shari by Jimmy boy.

7034
03:03:00,081 --> 03:03:00,591
You know what I'm saying?

7035
03:03:00,591 --> 03:03:01,730
He flexed up one on one,

7036
03:03:02,240 --> 03:03:05,420
but I want to make a public service
announcement freeze past couple of days.

7037
03:03:05,421 --> 03:03:09,860
I seem like there's a couple of females
that are trying to expose me as some

7038
03:03:09,861 --> 03:03:10,161
shit.

7039
03:03:10,161 --> 03:03:13,910
Like there's a lot of you like
I can't even name is a lot of,

7040
03:03:13,911 --> 03:03:15,700
you know,

7041
03:03:15,710 --> 03:03:19,190
like how a little bit more respectful
to ourselves and I say that in a,

7042
03:03:19,191 --> 03:03:22,580
in a way because I need to get past that.

7043
03:03:22,580 --> 03:03:24,230
It was just like a one day thing,

7044
03:03:24,260 --> 03:03:25,093
you know what I'm saying?

7045
03:03:25,190 --> 03:03:25,470
Okay.

7046
03:03:25,470 --> 03:03:26,100
I can't,

7047
03:03:26,100 --> 03:03:28,040
can you imagine if your
dollar brought that home?

7048
03:03:29,080 --> 03:03:29,421
You like,

7049
03:03:29,421 --> 03:03:30,770
what the f where'd you find that?

7050
03:03:31,070 --> 03:03:31,970
Go to home depot.

7051
03:03:32,020 --> 03:03:32,990
Is this music good?

7052
03:03:33,260 --> 03:03:33,760
I never,

7053
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:34,010
no.

7054
03:03:34,010 --> 03:03:35,290
I've listened to clips of like,

7055
03:03:35,320 --> 03:03:35,610
you know,

7056
03:03:35,610 --> 03:03:36,200
I'm second.

7057
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:36,590
Oops.

7058
03:03:36,590 --> 03:03:38,330
I'm old enough now where I don't know.

7059
03:03:38,750 --> 03:03:39,181
You'd have to.

7060
03:03:39,181 --> 03:03:40,014
It's not for me.

7061
03:03:40,020 --> 03:03:40,853
Go to home depot.

7062
03:03:40,890 --> 03:03:41,720
People are loving it.

7063
03:03:41,720 --> 03:03:43,860
They're eating it up door,

7064
03:03:44,090 --> 03:03:44,923
dude.

7065
03:03:45,200 --> 03:03:46,220
Get to do the music.

7066
03:03:46,810 --> 03:03:48,060
It's a whole error.

7067
03:03:48,680 --> 03:03:49,513
It's fucking,

7068
03:03:49,640 --> 03:03:51,050
you'd have to call the doctor.

7069
03:03:51,051 --> 03:03:52,400
You'd have to get a psychiatrist.

7070
03:03:52,410 --> 03:03:53,180
Is this a song?

7071
03:03:53,180 --> 03:03:54,013
Oh my God.

7072
03:03:54,380 --> 03:03:54,600
No,

7073
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:54,850
no,

7074
03:03:54,850 --> 03:03:55,150
no,

7075
03:03:55,150 --> 03:03:55,370
no,

7076
03:03:55,370 --> 03:03:55,740
no,

7077
03:03:55,740 --> 03:03:56,330
no,

7078
03:03:56,330 --> 03:03:56,481
no,

7079
03:03:56,481 --> 03:03:56,920
no.

7080
03:03:56,920 --> 03:03:57,410
I,

7081
03:03:57,410 --> 03:03:57,980
I can't,

7082
03:03:57,980 --> 03:03:58,521
we can't play it.

7083
03:03:58,521 --> 03:03:59,600
It'll get us take it off of Youtube.

7084
03:03:59,650 --> 03:04:00,410
Okay.

7085
03:04:00,410 --> 03:04:00,920
I can't,

7086
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:01,910
I can't afford that anymore.

7087
03:04:03,590 --> 03:04:04,371
It might be great.

7088
03:04:04,371 --> 03:04:05,160
You never know the,

7089
03:04:05,160 --> 03:04:05,993
here's my question.

7090
03:04:06,050 --> 03:04:07,100
If this is ridiculous,

7091
03:04:07,101 --> 03:04:07,430
right.

7092
03:04:07,430 --> 03:04:07,911
What is,

7093
03:04:07,911 --> 03:04:09,650
what is the next thing after the shit?

7094
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:10,860
Look at this mother flush robot.

7095
03:04:10,880 --> 03:04:11,080
Yeah,

7096
03:04:11,080 --> 03:04:12,170
and this guy is an engine.

7097
03:04:12,171 --> 03:04:14,030
That shit out of this stuff is hard.

7098
03:04:14,910 --> 03:04:16,010
We still look at it for a while.

7099
03:04:16,011 --> 03:04:16,780
We'll keep going.

7100
03:04:16,780 --> 03:04:18,530
Look at this motherfucker
on Ninja Warrior man.

7101
03:04:18,531 --> 03:04:21,790
I'm super impressed with the way
this dude is traversing this.

7102
03:04:22,660 --> 03:04:26,140
I think there are people that called
cultural preparation on this to Kashi sex

7103
03:04:26,150 --> 03:04:26,840
nine guy.

7104
03:04:26,840 --> 03:04:27,673
Oh really?

7105
03:04:28,200 --> 03:04:29,750
What do they call everything on everybody

7106
03:04:30,170 --> 03:04:31,003
making,

7107
03:04:31,210 --> 03:04:31,900
I don't know.

7108
03:04:31,900 --> 03:04:33,250
I don't know who's behind him either.

7109
03:04:33,310 --> 03:04:35,770
Like the managers at behind him and it's
a couple of other guys that are making

7110
03:04:35,771 --> 03:04:37,080
a shit load of money like them.

7111
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:38,161
Is it a,

7112
03:04:38,161 --> 03:04:39,630
is it a producer project?

7113
03:04:39,660 --> 03:04:40,740
Is My planned,

7114
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:42,130
did they pluck this guy and go,

7115
03:04:42,131 --> 03:04:42,331
okay,

7116
03:04:42,331 --> 03:04:43,440
this is perfect for our,

7117
03:04:43,650 --> 03:04:45,660
like he'd have to really get a God.

7118
03:04:45,661 --> 03:04:47,160
It's willing to tattoo his face.

7119
03:04:47,760 --> 03:04:48,061
You know?

7120
03:04:48,061 --> 03:04:49,560
I mean that's a metal fucking deck.

7121
03:04:49,590 --> 03:04:50,423
Crazy right now.

7122
03:04:51,180 --> 03:04:52,740
So many people have tattooed faces.

7123
03:04:53,810 --> 03:04:56,330
That's some serious
commitment tattoo on your mug.

7124
03:04:57,380 --> 03:04:58,250
Millions of dollars.

7125
03:04:58,910 --> 03:04:59,091
Yeah.

7126
03:04:59,091 --> 03:05:02,840
But I mean it might not work and you're
stuck with 69 I think tastes like an

7127
03:05:02,841 --> 03:05:03,340
asshole.

7128
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:06,260
I think they probably might wait until
they get that first big check and they

7129
03:05:06,261 --> 03:05:07,160
may be getting in.

7130
03:05:07,230 --> 03:05:08,000
Did he wait?

7131
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:11,320
I don't know about him particularly
if there's a controversy between uh,

7132
03:05:12,260 --> 03:05:15,860
is he a blood or is he a crip
and he's claiming he's both.

7133
03:05:15,861 --> 03:05:16,250
He does.

7134
03:05:16,250 --> 03:05:18,350
I'm friends with both of
them or something like that.

7135
03:05:18,680 --> 03:05:23,330
But he wears an awful lot of red
so people think that he's a blood.

7136
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:25,490
What a weird weird were.

7137
03:05:25,491 --> 03:05:26,810
Cut that shit off.

7138
03:05:26,850 --> 03:05:27,531
Shot it off.

7139
03:05:27,531 --> 03:05:27,951
Stop.

7140
03:05:27,951 --> 03:05:29,210
We can't do this any more Jamie.

7141
03:05:29,730 --> 03:05:31,400
She makes me watch this car all the time.

7142
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:36,680
Jamie's got his thumb on the pulse of
the Straits and he tells me my shit on

7143
03:05:36,681 --> 03:05:37,400
Instagram.

7144
03:05:37,400 --> 03:05:38,420
I find him fascinating.

7145
03:05:38,810 --> 03:05:40,850
Well there's a lot of
fascinating people today man.

7146
03:05:41,130 --> 03:05:44,120
That's Jamie also shows me
these girls with giant buts.

7147
03:05:44,410 --> 03:05:44,700
That's,

7148
03:05:44,700 --> 03:05:45,370
he knows all,

7149
03:05:45,370 --> 03:05:46,850
all know the real ones.

7150
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:47,833
Real ones.

7151
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:50,020
Real giant ass.

7152
03:05:50,110 --> 03:05:50,943
Cause they got the,

7153
03:05:51,140 --> 03:05:53,360
you can tell the not
because of the diaper,

7154
03:05:53,361 --> 03:05:56,420
but caper bud is a real
thing that looks real.

7155
03:05:56,930 --> 03:05:58,100
That's real as fuck,

7156
03:05:58,101 --> 03:05:58,491
dude.

7157
03:05:58,491 --> 03:05:59,600
Jesus Christ.

7158
03:06:02,030 --> 03:06:03,080
That makes me uncomfortable.

7159
03:06:03,710 --> 03:06:04,543
It's hot in here.

7160
03:06:05,780 --> 03:06:06,471
You know what's here?

7161
03:06:06,471 --> 03:06:06,591
See,

7162
03:06:06,591 --> 03:06:10,520
here's a fascinating thing to ask
was not a big deal for a long time.

7163
03:06:11,300 --> 03:06:12,133
For a long time,

7164
03:06:12,380 --> 03:06:14,210
he'd go back to like Linda
Carter and wonder woman.

7165
03:06:14,211 --> 03:06:17,660
You never saw her ass ever
asked was not a thing,

7166
03:06:17,661 --> 03:06:19,460
man ass Farrah Fawcett.

7167
03:06:19,490 --> 03:06:21,200
You never saw Farrah Fawcetts ass.

7168
03:06:21,620 --> 03:06:22,450
Right.

7169
03:06:22,450 --> 03:06:25,190
But now if a girl's
going to be a hot chick,

7170
03:06:25,250 --> 03:06:27,290
she's got to have a banging ass.

7171
03:06:27,620 --> 03:06:29,780
If a girl's like in a
movie as a hot chick,

7172
03:06:30,010 --> 03:06:33,410
there's going to be a point in the movie
where you see her in a pair of tight

7173
03:06:33,411 --> 03:06:33,771
jeans.

7174
03:06:33,771 --> 03:06:34,220
You Go,

7175
03:06:34,220 --> 03:06:34,930
whoa.

7176
03:06:34,930 --> 03:06:35,450
Yeah,

7177
03:06:35,450 --> 03:06:35,870
right.

7178
03:06:35,870 --> 03:06:36,410
Yeah.

7179
03:06:36,410 --> 03:06:39,080
That's an excellent set
that like when you did,

7180
03:06:39,610 --> 03:06:40,361
I like the,

7181
03:06:40,361 --> 03:06:42,040
I think he probably below big buts.

7182
03:06:42,130 --> 03:06:43,060
That's like all right here.

7183
03:06:43,070 --> 03:06:43,270
Yeah,

7184
03:06:43,270 --> 03:06:44,410
he's definitely dumped in.

7185
03:06:44,411 --> 03:06:45,290
There's definitely it up.

7186
03:06:45,300 --> 03:06:46,210
It's definitely a moment,

7187
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:49,840
but always in the Mexican
community and the black community,

7188
03:06:49,930 --> 03:06:51,360
we were always into big butts.

7189
03:06:51,670 --> 03:06:52,330
We didn't need,

7190
03:06:52,330 --> 03:06:53,830
we didn't need society to tell us that.

7191
03:06:53,831 --> 03:06:55,000
We didn't know what the hell it was,

7192
03:06:55,050 --> 03:06:56,160
were just like big.

7193
03:06:56,170 --> 03:07:00,300
If scientific ground bots in the future
and they're studying the size of asses,

7194
03:07:01,050 --> 03:07:01,621
they'd be like,

7195
03:07:01,621 --> 03:07:05,850
well this is a noticeable jump in
women's asses at a certain point in time.

7196
03:07:05,851 --> 03:07:06,690
The 20th century.

7197
03:07:06,691 --> 03:07:07,530
Like what is that?

7198
03:07:07,620 --> 03:07:10,500
I saw this documentary once
called the history of sex.

7199
03:07:10,530 --> 03:07:15,530
It was on the science channel or something
was a five part documentary and they

7200
03:07:15,991 --> 03:07:17,640
were getting into why we,

7201
03:07:17,820 --> 03:07:22,820
we like certain things from the
opposite sex and the but apparently uh,

7202
03:07:23,400 --> 03:07:24,000
the reason,

7203
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:25,500
well obviously like tits,

7204
03:07:25,530 --> 03:07:26,280
we like tits.

7205
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:27,113
If they're big,

7206
03:07:27,160 --> 03:07:31,380
like we'd like them because we know
they're going to be able to feed the baby.

7207
03:07:31,670 --> 03:07:35,760
So we get a little endorphin rush big
because a woman can have birth give birth

7208
03:07:35,761 --> 03:07:36,181
easier.

7209
03:07:36,181 --> 03:07:36,460
So you,

7210
03:07:36,460 --> 03:07:39,750
you're attracted to that symmetry
according to this documentary,

7211
03:07:39,780 --> 03:07:40,710
the fat and the,

7212
03:07:40,711 --> 03:07:44,340
but it during the third
trimester of pregnancy,

7213
03:07:44,520 --> 03:07:45,900
that's when the brain develops.

7214
03:07:46,050 --> 03:07:46,700
And,

7215
03:07:46,700 --> 03:07:47,070
and,

7216
03:07:47,070 --> 03:07:47,221
uh,

7217
03:07:47,221 --> 03:07:48,690
the brain is developed from,

7218
03:07:49,080 --> 03:07:49,900
uh,

7219
03:07:49,900 --> 03:07:50,670
uh,

7220
03:07:50,670 --> 03:07:50,850
uh,

7221
03:07:50,850 --> 03:07:53,280
fat from the ass according
to this documentary.

7222
03:07:53,760 --> 03:07:58,760
So I guess we're looking at big round
asses for a smarter babies married.

7223
03:07:59,820 --> 03:08:01,200
That's what the documentary said.

7224
03:08:01,201 --> 03:08:01,500
I don't,

7225
03:08:01,500 --> 03:08:01,801
you know,

7226
03:08:01,801 --> 03:08:02,320
who knows.

7227
03:08:02,320 --> 03:08:02,431
Well,

7228
03:08:02,431 --> 03:08:05,820
they definitely know the shape of a woman
that's attractive to us because that's

7229
03:08:05,821 --> 03:08:06,900
the most fertile women,

7230
03:08:07,080 --> 03:08:11,250
the women that's going to be most likely
to hold a baby to term and raise the

7231
03:08:11,251 --> 03:08:12,084
child.

7232
03:08:12,390 --> 03:08:14,580
And that's why all those
qualities that you like.

7233
03:08:14,580 --> 03:08:15,031
And I'm like,

7234
03:08:15,031 --> 03:08:19,050
what a lot of men are really attracted
to nurturing women and he really

7235
03:08:19,051 --> 03:08:21,270
attracted to a woman who
wants to cook you dinner.

7236
03:08:21,480 --> 03:08:21,721
You know,

7237
03:08:21,721 --> 03:08:24,030
a woman who wants to
like give you a massage.

7238
03:08:24,031 --> 03:08:25,050
Like to a lot of guys,

7239
03:08:25,051 --> 03:08:29,670
that's a big deal because that's like a
nurturing type woman that would be not

7240
03:08:29,671 --> 03:08:30,630
just that way to you,

7241
03:08:30,631 --> 03:08:32,070
but that way to your children too.

7242
03:08:32,100 --> 03:08:37,100
We're talking about why scientifically
are men into big disease shapes or we're

7243
03:08:37,531 --> 03:08:39,450
also talking about how back in the day,

7244
03:08:39,600 --> 03:08:41,730
asses weren't a big deal
with Farrah Fawcett.

7245
03:08:41,940 --> 03:08:43,270
He never saw Farrah Fawcett task,

7246
03:08:43,320 --> 03:08:44,160
wonder woman.

7247
03:08:44,260 --> 03:08:45,093
Maryland

7248
03:08:46,200 --> 03:08:47,870
was curvy.

7249
03:08:49,390 --> 03:08:49,740
Nobody,

7250
03:08:49,740 --> 03:08:51,260
which wasn't sticking her ass out.

7251
03:08:51,630 --> 03:08:52,820
She was curvy though,

7252
03:08:52,821 --> 03:08:57,310
weren't you knew where it might've
happened in Wa [inaudible] Guerra girls

7253
03:08:57,340 --> 03:08:58,420
before they Amos,

7254
03:08:58,830 --> 03:09:01,530
but she was famous just for her ass.

7255
03:09:01,980 --> 03:09:03,540
Just stress with no Internet,

7256
03:09:03,900 --> 03:09:05,370
no Internet dude magazines.

7257
03:09:05,370 --> 03:09:06,750
Everybody knew who she was.

7258
03:09:07,430 --> 03:09:11,190
Rera mammas the all time ass queen.

7259
03:09:11,191 --> 03:09:11,401
Yo,

7260
03:09:11,401 --> 03:09:12,840
this was pre internet,

7261
03:09:12,940 --> 03:09:13,290
right?

7262
03:09:13,290 --> 03:09:14,280
Pre social media.

7263
03:09:14,300 --> 03:09:15,250
She was a bad son.

7264
03:09:15,460 --> 03:09:19,980
Get best but as fuck out of dodge
with that ass and that was end.

7265
03:09:20,190 --> 03:09:21,750
It was DNA and earned.

7266
03:09:21,900 --> 03:09:22,490
That wasn't,

7267
03:09:22,490 --> 03:09:23,920
he's a human or something chat.

7268
03:09:23,970 --> 03:09:24,180
Yeah,

7269
03:09:24,180 --> 03:09:25,230
that's exactly what she was.

7270
03:09:25,880 --> 03:09:28,310
[inaudible] guy fat and stuffing in it.

7271
03:09:29,440 --> 03:09:30,540
I dated her.

7272
03:09:30,850 --> 03:09:31,350
He was,

7273
03:09:31,350 --> 03:09:32,400
he was not into her.

7274
03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:36,960
He just likes dudes,

7275
03:09:38,640 --> 03:09:39,920
you know?

7276
03:09:41,460 --> 03:09:41,910
I don't know,

7277
03:09:41,910 --> 03:09:42,511
but he just,

7278
03:09:42,511 --> 03:09:43,770
he says just aim.

7279
03:09:43,771 --> 03:09:45,120
There was nothing to talk about with her.

7280
03:09:45,150 --> 03:09:45,571
Hey Man.

7281
03:09:45,571 --> 03:09:47,720
Sometimes I naturally talk with,

7282
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,520
sometimes you just want to have
a conversation bro and snuggle.

7283
03:09:50,550 --> 03:09:51,600
She's a singer too.

7284
03:09:51,630 --> 03:09:52,100
Hey Dude.

7285
03:09:52,100 --> 03:09:54,200
Well sometimes just
want [inaudible] album.

7286
03:09:54,330 --> 03:09:55,330
She put out an album.

7287
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:55,901
You know,

7288
03:09:55,901 --> 03:09:58,840
sometimes with a gal you
give her a book and you say,

7289
03:09:58,841 --> 03:09:59,380
Hey,

7290
03:09:59,380 --> 03:10:00,640
before we do anything physical,

7291
03:10:00,641 --> 03:10:02,860
you read this and I want to
read it and now let's talk.

7292
03:10:02,880 --> 03:10:03,640
Let's talk,

7293
03:10:03,640 --> 03:10:04,600
let's talk about the book.

7294
03:10:04,730 --> 03:10:07,390
To check out was a
great fucking reference.

7295
03:10:07,391 --> 03:10:07,750
Joe,

7296
03:10:07,750 --> 03:10:08,850
I forgot about Griffith.

7297
03:10:09,050 --> 03:10:10,300
She was my favorite.

7298
03:10:10,420 --> 03:10:11,710
I had a poster in my college,

7299
03:10:11,711 --> 03:10:12,131
dorm,

7300
03:10:12,131 --> 03:10:12,500
liver.

7301
03:10:12,500 --> 03:10:16,510
I would see what's impressive is
her ass superseded the Internet.

7302
03:10:16,750 --> 03:10:17,920
It like bypass.

7303
03:10:18,100 --> 03:10:18,933
It was before the end.

7304
03:10:19,020 --> 03:10:23,890
Thank was was there but it
wasn't why she got famous,

7305
03:10:23,891 --> 03:10:25,730
she got famous from magazines.

7306
03:10:25,900 --> 03:10:27,770
She was in low rider talk.

7307
03:10:27,830 --> 03:10:30,070
That low rider with that APP for sure.

7308
03:10:30,071 --> 03:10:30,600
She,

7309
03:10:30,600 --> 03:10:32,350
she had a push from the Internet.

7310
03:10:32,470 --> 03:10:35,790
There was dudes passing her picture around
and showed been way bigger if she was

7311
03:10:35,890 --> 03:10:36,940
current now what it,

7312
03:10:36,950 --> 03:10:37,091
yeah.

7313
03:10:37,091 --> 03:10:38,320
What I should say is,

7314
03:10:38,410 --> 03:10:39,760
well there's a lot of girls like her now.

7315
03:10:39,790 --> 03:10:40,840
She'd get lost in the shuffle.

7316
03:10:40,841 --> 03:10:44,560
What I'm saying is like then she was one
of the few girls that people would pass

7317
03:10:44,561 --> 03:10:46,750
or photos around pre social media.

7318
03:10:46,780 --> 03:10:47,230
Correct.

7319
03:10:47,230 --> 03:10:51,280
So wasn't like it was like this girl on
an Instagram page and she had 10 million

7320
03:10:51,281 --> 03:10:52,480
followers because of her ass.

7321
03:10:52,481 --> 03:10:54,160
It was like guys like you would go,

7322
03:10:54,161 --> 03:10:54,581
dude,

7323
03:10:54,581 --> 03:10:56,800
look at this and you would
send it to me and I'd go,

7324
03:10:56,801 --> 03:11:00,760
Jesus hung up posters and
people emailed each other.

7325
03:11:00,820 --> 03:11:03,040
The FHM maxim.

7326
03:11:03,340 --> 03:11:04,350
What year is this gender?

7327
03:11:05,110 --> 03:11:07,120
It doesn't say the bottom of the Barcode.

7328
03:11:08,080 --> 03:11:10,120
He's probably done 500 magazine,

7329
03:11:10,121 --> 03:11:13,540
2005 this is pre social media
dating Nicholas Shay or some shit.

7330
03:11:13,980 --> 03:11:14,813
My space,

7331
03:11:15,670 --> 03:11:16,570
my space time,

7332
03:11:16,571 --> 03:11:19,090
but that wasn't the same as like Twitter.

7333
03:11:19,091 --> 03:11:19,924
Facebook.

7334
03:11:20,440 --> 03:11:22,600
She had a tremendous my space.

7335
03:11:22,630 --> 03:11:23,110
Right?

7336
03:11:23,110 --> 03:11:23,231
Oh,

7337
03:11:23,231 --> 03:11:24,880
probably a hundred more questions.

7338
03:11:25,240 --> 03:11:27,190
Do you think she had Tom right
in the upper left hand corner?

7339
03:11:28,240 --> 03:11:28,780
What?

7340
03:11:28,780 --> 03:11:29,613
Tom?

7341
03:11:30,810 --> 03:11:33,850
Tom was always your first four
speed friend fucked up though.

7342
03:11:34,240 --> 03:11:37,240
He always had them in your fucking
top eight or whatever it was.

7343
03:11:38,650 --> 03:11:39,430
Yeah,

7344
03:11:39,430 --> 03:11:40,120
she is.

7345
03:11:40,120 --> 03:11:41,950
She still relevant on Instagram now?

7346
03:11:42,320 --> 03:11:44,520
She all old and weathered or she like,

7347
03:11:46,460 --> 03:11:47,070
well,

7348
03:11:47,070 --> 03:11:48,070
tome girl's name.

7349
03:11:48,580 --> 03:11:50,020
Who's the dime piece?

7350
03:11:50,080 --> 03:11:51,250
Who's on modern family.

7351
03:11:52,790 --> 03:11:52,990
Oh,

7352
03:11:52,990 --> 03:11:53,980
she's still killing it.

7353
03:11:54,190 --> 03:11:55,090
She's still looks good.

7354
03:11:55,780 --> 03:11:56,620
Congratulations.

7355
03:11:56,810 --> 03:11:57,531
I'm not mad at her.

7356
03:11:57,531 --> 03:11:58,410
At all.

7357
03:12:00,550 --> 03:12:01,150
Hey,

7358
03:12:01,150 --> 03:12:03,310
let's see if you find an actual,

7359
03:12:03,370 --> 03:12:04,203
there it is

7360
03:12:05,470 --> 03:12:06,400
still strong still.

7361
03:12:06,401 --> 03:12:07,120
Donut girl.

7362
03:12:07,120 --> 03:12:07,953
Strong,

7363
03:12:08,260 --> 03:12:09,130
strong gay.

7364
03:12:09,580 --> 03:12:10,413
Oh,

7365
03:12:10,570 --> 03:12:11,403
that,

7366
03:12:11,810 --> 03:12:12,550
that's some,

7367
03:12:12,550 --> 03:12:14,890
that's some DNA that's
from the motherland.

7368
03:12:15,160 --> 03:12:16,330
I Dunno where the motherland is,

7369
03:12:16,331 --> 03:12:18,460
but wherever it is that's
from the rover she's from.

7370
03:12:18,461 --> 03:12:19,120
That's another,

7371
03:12:19,120 --> 03:12:20,110
she tapped into that shit.

7372
03:12:20,111 --> 03:12:20,944
Like Maple Syrup,

7373
03:12:21,550 --> 03:12:22,990
God doggy.

7374
03:12:23,050 --> 03:12:24,760
Then she dates someone really famous.

7375
03:12:25,150 --> 03:12:25,983
I hope so.

7376
03:12:26,520 --> 03:12:27,740
I hope you found the show shows.

7377
03:12:30,910 --> 03:12:33,220
Congratulations doin good for it.

7378
03:12:33,230 --> 03:12:35,170
You still doing it was in this with her.

7379
03:12:35,590 --> 03:12:36,423
I'm getting hot.

7380
03:12:36,750 --> 03:12:37,750
You were saying it was hot earlier,

7381
03:12:37,751 --> 03:12:38,584
right?

7382
03:12:39,320 --> 03:12:41,590
I'll fill in all weird fellows.

7383
03:12:41,591 --> 03:12:42,100
Funky.

7384
03:12:42,100 --> 03:12:42,970
Sorry Dude.

7385
03:12:42,971 --> 03:12:43,840
So we got through this.

7386
03:12:43,870 --> 03:12:46,390
She's gonna have a million
followers after this podcast.

7387
03:12:46,450 --> 03:12:47,330
People though she is,

7388
03:12:47,430 --> 03:12:47,700
oh,

7389
03:12:47,700 --> 03:12:49,270
this was our first fight companion.

7390
03:12:49,300 --> 03:12:49,511
Uh,

7391
03:12:49,511 --> 03:12:51,740
other than kickboxing outside the UFC.

7392
03:12:51,770 --> 03:12:52,161
That's right,

7393
03:12:52,161 --> 03:12:52,460
man.

7394
03:12:52,460 --> 03:12:52,990
It's good.

7395
03:12:52,990 --> 03:12:53,551
It's been fun.

7396
03:12:53,551 --> 03:12:54,630
I'm sorry about the nuclear

7397
03:12:57,360 --> 03:12:57,670
bombs.

7398
03:12:57,670 --> 03:12:58,503
Good.

7399
03:12:58,680 --> 03:13:00,420
I was just getting to
the point you're making.

7400
03:13:00,740 --> 03:13:02,830
I get you just get a little caught up.

7401
03:13:02,840 --> 03:13:03,500
Doesn't spirits.

7402
03:13:03,500 --> 03:13:03,751
He's in.

7403
03:13:03,751 --> 03:13:04,700
Sometimes it's just,

7404
03:13:05,340 --> 03:13:07,010
I think dinosaurs are real,

7405
03:13:07,011 --> 03:13:07,490
bro.

7406
03:13:07,490 --> 03:13:08,323
That's all I'm saying.

7407
03:13:08,460 --> 03:13:09,710
I did something.

7408
03:13:09,760 --> 03:13:12,320
So I'm in Minnesota this weekend,

7409
03:13:12,350 --> 03:13:13,070
Friday,

7410
03:13:13,070 --> 03:13:13,071
Saturday,

7411
03:13:13,071 --> 03:13:13,904

House of Commons Mall America.

7413
03:13:15,560 --> 03:13:16,100
Beautiful.

7414
03:13:16,100 --> 03:13:17,090
And now I'm in West Nyack.

7415
03:13:17,091 --> 03:13:17,740
The following note,

7416
03:13:17,740 --> 03:13:18,560
that Trivia,

7417
03:13:18,560 --> 03:13:19,490
that's where ours should fear.

7418
03:13:19,491 --> 03:13:21,560
Got arrested or was
almost getting arrested.

7419
03:13:21,810 --> 03:13:22,940
Drop it off edibles,

7420
03:13:23,920 --> 03:13:24,271
wasn't it?

7421
03:13:24,271 --> 03:13:24,570
Yeah.

7422
03:13:24,570 --> 03:13:27,680

03:13:30,290 --> 03:13:30,760
cops.

7426
03:13:30,760 --> 03:13:31,250
Oh Shit.

7427
03:13:31,250 --> 03:13:32,083
