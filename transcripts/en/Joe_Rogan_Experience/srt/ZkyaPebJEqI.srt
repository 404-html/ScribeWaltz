1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,161
Oh yeah.

3
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:03,360
I want you to do more movies,

4
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:03,630
man.

5
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,100
I really enjoyed Freddy got fingered.

6
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,760
Oh yeah,

7
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,100
yeah,

8
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,360
yeah,

9
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:06,600
yeah.

10
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,071
Thank you.

11
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:08,370
You went out there with that man.

12
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,630
You took a crazy chance.

13
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:09,841
Yeah.

14
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:11,430
I think it shocked a lot of people.

15
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:12,510
They didn't know what to do with it,

16
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:12,780
you know,

17
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,770
because it was so out there,

18
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:16,980
but it's like it was one of
the ultimate stoner movies.

19
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,150
If you're a stoner,

20
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,540
what?

21
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,291
Go get Freddy.

22
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,880
If you mean people like you know,

23
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:21,714
a lot of people haven't,

24
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,880
haven't really heard an
enough good reviews of it.

25
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,630
It's really fucking funny girl.

26
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,000
Thank you.

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,720
Voted that all day.

28
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,090
I do that scene with the
baby when the giving birth.

29
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,640
It's fuck I want to say anymore.

30
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,400
I don't want to ruin it.

31
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,670
I don't know.

32
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,200
A very similar in a way to your comedy.

33
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,750
Yeah,

34
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,420
no.

35
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:36,780
Let me,

36
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,171
let me tell you.

37
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:37,651
It's a thing.

38
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:37,781
The,

39
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:40,020
thank you for saying that
because you know when you,

40
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,893
when you,

41
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,190
you get thrust into this situation where
all of a sudden I had an opportunity to

42
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:46,110
make a movie to write.

43
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:46,750
I wrote it,

44
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,730
it was obviously was this trying to make
the stupidest movie we could think of

45
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,061
right now.

46
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:52,500
Let's make it the stupidest thing ever.

47
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,753
And then,

48
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,330
you know,

49
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,250
the studio at the time,

50
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:57,630
I had all this opportunity to make this,

51
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:57,991
they said,

52
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:58,231
okay,

53
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,300
they had all these directors
I said I want to direct it to,

54
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,260
so then they let me do it,

55
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:01,860
right?

56
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,040
So now I'm swinging blooding
babies around and you know,

57
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,260
jacking off elephants
and stuff and you know,

58
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,400
getting insight here,

59
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,900
carcasses and doing all this stuff.

60
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:10,470
Right?

61
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:10,831
And then,

62
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:11,041
you know,

63
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,870
you're working on this
thing for like a year,

64
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,500
right?

65
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,010
You know,

66
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,530
you're working on this
thing for a year nonstop.

67
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,370
Uh,

68
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:17,701
you know,

69
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:18,720
you're casting it,

70
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,700
you're picking all the props,

71
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:24,460
you're making sure all the way the guts
that come out of that deer carcass look

72
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:25,800
like rubber to me.

73
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:26,341
And then the,

74
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:27,151
the prop guys like,

75
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:27,430
well,

76
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,140
we're going to put some blood
on it and it's going to,

77
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:30,421
and I go,

78
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:30,541
well,

79
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,440
let's see what that looks like.

80
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:31,921
And they do it.

81
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:32,910
And you look at it and you're like,

82
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:33,601
no,

83
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:34,710
it still looks like some rubber.

84
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,000
We've got to get some real guts.

85
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:36,271
And they're like,

86
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:36,421
well,

87
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:38,760
we don't know how we're going to make
real guts come out of the carcass when you

88
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:39,121
cut it.

89
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:39,551
And then they go,

90
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:39,750
well,

91
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,750
they go off and these are like
people that are professionals,

92
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:42,991
you know,

93
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,360
and they go off and they come
back the next day and to go,

94
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:45,541
okay,

95
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,720
we've rigged up this compressed air that
we're going to put in the back of the

96
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,860
taxidermy dear.

97
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,660
You're going to run your
knife down the slit.

98
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,160
It's gonna shoot out real pig guts that
we've got at the butcher shop and I'm

99
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,900
draped and pig guts and
I'm doing all this stuff,

100
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,161
all this stuff right?

101
00:01:59,161 --> 00:01:59,641
And you're thinking,

102
00:01:59,641 --> 00:01:59,851
okay,

103
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:00,571
this is crazy.

104
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,470
This is going to look crazy.

105
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,820
Then the movie comes out,

106
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,870
everybody like,

107
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,440
you know,

108
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,273
basically,

109
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:05,700
you know,

110
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,030
reams you like,

111
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,311
uh,

112
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:07,591
you know,

113
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:09,900
you've never been reamed before
in your life at this point.

114
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,760
I mean,

115
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,070
local papers and people and you and you,

116
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,300
and you feel completely
kind of confused about it,

117
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:15,491
right?

118
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:16,324
Because you're thinking,

119
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,241
shit,

120
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,560
I thought it was pretty fucking funny.

121
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:20,640
I don't know what's wrong with me.

122
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,030
Right.

123
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,750
So then the,

124
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,830
the fun thing about it is after that
initial weekend and the whole sort of

125
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,190
everybody talking about your
movie being crazy and you know,

126
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,800
disgusting and all this stuff,

127
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,731
you a,

128
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:33,031
you know,

129
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:36,300
I've been on tour this year doing
standup and it's been so much fun because

130
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,081
there's a lot a,

131
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,330
of a nut jobs out there
in the world that like,

132
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,790
that let that love the movie and there,

133
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,030
and then it's part of my show now.

134
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,990
And when I do my standup,

135
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,230
I do a little guitar at my show in
the middle and I seen a couple like,

136
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:46,501
Daddy,

137
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,580
would you like some sausage?

138
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,960
I sing that with everybody,

139
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,863
sings it with me.

140
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,930
And then people start shouting
out some of their favorite pets.

141
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,540
But I'm surprised I went
all across Australia,

142
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,940
Canada.

143
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,310
Uh,

144
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,800
next month I'm going to
be in a Toronto Bellville,

145
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,850
um,

146
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,120
uh,

147
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,110
Hamilton and London,

148
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:02,944
Ontario.

149
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,461
And,

150
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,060
uh,

151
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,040
people come to the shows and,

152
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,730
uh,

153
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,001
you know,

154
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:07,340
are,

155
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,830
are shouting out all
these things from Freddie.

156
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:09,430
Got To saucing.

157
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,263
It feels a lot.

158
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,380
I guess what I'm saying is,

159
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,430
thanks for bringing it up,

160
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:16,180
but this is great to be out and actually
getting all this positive feedback

161
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:19,540
about the movie because I was made to
feel like this is word or somebody who,

162
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,850
this is what I know.

163
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,100
You're a victim of a
pre-internet review system.

164
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,270
It was a bunch of fogy old douche bags
and you know the way people looked at

165
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:29,104
things was,

166
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,321
you know,

167
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,550
you couldn't just when,

168
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,690
what year was Freddy got fingered?

169
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,010
It was 2001 yeah.

170
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,450
Who the fuck was on
the Internet back then?

171
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:34,901
You know what I'm saying?

172
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,690
It wasn't the same as 2010 and
the thing that doesn't attend,

173
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,160
you get your reviews from,

174
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:39,671
ain't it cool.

175
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,650
Dot news.com like that kind of shit.

176
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:43,660
Like I always go to Fandango or something.

177
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:45,490
I get my reviews online.

178
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,750
I want to use this moment as a,

179
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,210
as a real,

180
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,050
there's a real opportunity for me to
actually talk about this for a second.

181
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:50,500
Okay.

182
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,240
I directed this movie,

183
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,040
but he wrote this whole thing.

184
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,780
Everybody freaks out on it.

185
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:56,560
It's Pre-internet,

186
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,070
right?

187
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,221
I,

188
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:59,950
the other day I went and
I looked at a Netflix.

189
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,341
Okay.

190
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:00,670
At the,

191
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,930
of the reviews of the movies,

192
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:02,170
right?

193
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,050
So I did this just two days ago and I
looked at the review as a pretty good

194
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:05,650
finger.

195
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,010
And the point of making that movie
was to kind of like be polarizing,

196
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:09,370
right?

197
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,260
It was supposed to be ridiculous.

198
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,070
It was done in a way where I think
that 50% of the people who watch it are

199
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:18,820
definitely going to hate it more than
anything they've ever seen in their entire

200
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:19,360
life.

201
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,680
And that was the goal to,

202
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:21,080
you know,

203
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,430
and the Joe is obviously the other 50%
of the people are laughing at the 50% of

204
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,121
the people that hate it.

205
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:25,341
And it's,

206
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:25,551
that's,

207
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:26,201
that's the joke,

208
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:26,770
right?

209
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,220
So yeah,

210
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,260
I went on Netflix and you're
reading the reviews and it's,

211
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,870
it's pretty much 50 50
people are giving it either,

212
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,201
you know,

213
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:36,310
a good review or the worst review you've
ever read in your life back and forth,

214
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:36,940
back and forth.

215
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,220
And these people are just
arguing with each other about it.

216
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,203
And I'm looking at it.

217
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,540
Here we are 10 years later after I made
this thing and looking at these people,

218
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,230
having these passionate
arguments completely on
opposite ends of the spectrum.

219
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,430
That's pretty funny.

220
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,110
So I like that.

221
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,600
Go read the reviews on this sequence.

222
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,511
I really,

223
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:54,490
truly believe that if
that movie came out today,

224
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,230
it would be an internet phenomenon.

225
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:57,340
People would be so into it.

226
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,370
I think it's a,

227
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,470
it was a fucking fun,

228
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,980
crazy.

229
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,813
Make it three d

230
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,080
[inaudible].
