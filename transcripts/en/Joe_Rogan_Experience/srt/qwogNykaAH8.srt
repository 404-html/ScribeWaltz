1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,351
Well,
you know,

2
00:00:01,351 --> 00:00:04,110
alcoholics anonymous was created by a 
guy who was in the LSD.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,430
Yeah.
Bill W

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,260
baller.
Jamie,

5
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,094
I'm going to show you through your 
sweater and saw bad sweater sweatshirt 

6
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:18,000
you're wearing.
It's very cool.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,283
But this is a,
this is a symptom of everything is 

8
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,750
wrong.
Miss,

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,800
go ahead.
Are we all in yet?

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,663
Yeah,
we're on,

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,810
it's got fake short sleeves.
It's got fake short sleeves,

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,270
over long sleeves.
So the,

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,960
the short sleeves or sewed in?
Not so it's not attached.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,640
How has it worked then?
This,

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,560
the short sleeves,
it comes apart.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,220
This sleep part not attached at all.
It's separate.

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,930
So it's two pieces.
Yeah.

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,320
I didn't know that when I bought it 
either.

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,260
But when you pull the sleeve up,
what happens?

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,480
Nothing can come off.
Oh it goes all the way over the top.

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,351
Oh,
I see.

22
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:56,100
Like a separate hood.

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,960
So do you where the two of them together
are?

24
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,820
They I just saw it on,
I just bought it.

25
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:00,654
There's a whole rocky thing that this 
company did it a whole bunch of pieces 

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,680
and I was like,
oh that's Kinda cool.

27
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,240
So I'm Sylvester Stallone is slated to 
come on the podcast.

28
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:12,120
You will wear that correct.
And He's here please.

29
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:13,110
Okay.
All right.

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,513
So is that,
but that the upper shirt is just laid 

31
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,200
over the tops,
shorts,

32
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:22,140
long sleeve shirt.
So you could wear one without the other.

33
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,550
Like you could wear the short sleeve 
one.

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,331
Oh,
okay.

35
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,440
It's just two sweatshirts,
you know.

36
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:28,140
But it's the training montage.
Oh,

37
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:29,530
it comes,
it comes as a,

38
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,490
as a team.
Is it heavy or is it light?

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,473
It is not light at all.
I'm starting to sweat right now and let 

40
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,770
me shut this door.
But that'll make you stronger if you got

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,530
a heavy shirt.

42
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,420
I think that's the idea.
So,

43
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:41,520
uh,
we are here and if uh,

44
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,413
some shit goes down,
I may have to bolt from the podcast 

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,780
because a,
there's mandatory evacuations all around

46
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:49,980
here.
Really?

47
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

48
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,830
What does it mean to live all in Ventura
County?

49
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,550
There's all these mandatory of bees.
Honey bees.

50
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,431
Is it really?
Yeah,

51
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:57,510
they're making too much.
Honey,

52
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,140
what is it?
Let's have mudslides.

53
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,640
Oh Wow.
I didn't know that.

54
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,610
I had to pull off loss at one time.
They a bunch of bs on there.

55
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,280
What really huge hives,
man.

56
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,360
Wow.
You see,

57
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:11,400
you know a lot of homeless people and 
they don't do anything,

58
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,770
but when be show up they fucking get to 
do and shit.

59
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,700
You know?
That's one thing I noticed quickly.

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,671
Yeah.
Yeah.

61
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,920
Isn't it an interesting,
how'd they get motivated by bees?

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,950
Bees will motivate anybody,
you know,

63
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,320
you're not all cracked out once the 
bee's show up,

64
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,363
dude,
I watched bees communicate with each 

65
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:28,044
other once I was on the set of fear 
factor and we covered these people with 

66
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:34,980
bs and then a neighboring colony,
a colony that actually lived there.

67
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,920
Local colony came and were like,
what are you guys doing here?

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,780
And the bees all flew up in the sky 
together and sorted it out in the sky.

69
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,310
Really?
It was wild.

70
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,130
We had,
the guy told us like the beekeeper,

71
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:48,480
he's like,
everybody's got to stand down.

72
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,220
We've got to back up,
get out of the area.

73
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,054
And was like,
what?

74
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,590
So yeah,
they have to communicate.

75
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,390
I thought he was joking.
Let them do it,

76
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:54,751
Huh?
Yeah.

77
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:56,070
It's like they have to talk it out.
I'm like,

78
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:57,000
whoa.
They talk.

79
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,200
Wow,
what are they going to say?

80
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,190
There's something

81
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,740
going on with them that we,
you know,

82
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:07,690
we just kind of subtly,
we sort of get what they do.

83
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,210
Yeah.
They're kinda like little,

84
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,240
little kind of liaisons it seems like.
Like I wonder from the future we'll know

85
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:18,240
that like certain animals can like,
you know,

86
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,353
take messages around for us and like if 
you told an animal something that could 

87
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:22,751
go tell,
you know,

88
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,420
like a wonderful start using animals 
more because animals are,

89
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,254
we don't use them that much.
I mean there sitting around most of the 

90
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:29,020
time.
Right.

91
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:29,854
I've read something about,
they were trying to encode information 

92
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,114
in DNA.
We could ask Mike Tyson about his 

93
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:37,090
pigeons.
Yeah.

94
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,830
I think that's different though.
Carrier Pigeons,

95
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,950
pigeons.
Just to carry for a long distances.

96
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,130
How about game of thrones?
Duesberg for,

97
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,210
yeah,
for sure.

98
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,044
But whatever,
for whatever reason it makes more sense 

99
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,010
with birds.
Yeah.

100
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:51,940
Right.

101
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,280
Like a bird seems like you should be 
able to train it a little bit.

102
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,081
Oh,
Berg,

103
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:56,914
you could train some birds.
I think some birds I think would do 

104
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:00,100
their own thing.
Then I'll ask you this.

105
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:02,380
If you had an important message,
would you just send one raven?

106
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,423
That's what I hadn't never got you.
How about you send a flock of these 

107
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,893
mother fuckers?
What are you crazy live that God damn 

108
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:08,644
thing gets eaten?
What if an Eagle Jackson one along the 

109
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,190
way,
the fate of your kingdom is at hand,

110
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:13,210
sir.
Yeah.

111
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,190
You can't put that on the back of one 
bird did.

112
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:16,900
I would send a bird.
Nobody would expect,

113
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,460
you know,
like a little warbler or something or in

114
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,300
nightingale.
Oh,

115
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,390
that's a good move.
Yeah.

116
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,360
You gotta send a bird that nobody wants 
to shoot though.

117
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,500
Shoot.
Birds will al too,

118
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,950
dude.

119
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,610
We had al two Thanksgiving's ago.
We had two hours at my sister's house.

120
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,050
Yeah,
I saw one last night actually.

121
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,720
Did you?
Yeah.

122
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,521
It was pretty,
no,

123
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:35,680
not last night before last.
It was pretty fucking cool.

124
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,110
I pulled into the driveway and an owl 
took off.

125
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,910
It was big too.
It's gross.

126
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:43,690
I think owls,
the meet the uh oh you ate them,

127
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:44,381
you saying?
Yeah.

128
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,230
But you guys eight hours.
Yeah,

129
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,403
that's legal.
He's probably shouldn't say that on the 

130
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:51,010
podcast.
Well,

131
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,283
I didn't have a lot.
I used to have a joke about it and I 

132
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:56,381
didn't have a lot.
Man.

133
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:57,214
I have no job.
They got even spit it out and I'm not 

134
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,374
even joking.
Yeah.

135
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,293
Clinton,
when you smoked that weed and they had 

136
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:02,560
to,
they didn't have all the things.

137
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,840
They don't have a lot of meat on him.
I fucking know.

138
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:07,240
Like owls.
They're predators.

139
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,074
They're important.
That's why you don't have rats 

140
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,790
everywhere.
Yeah.

141
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,624
But I'd rather,
you know,

142
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,513
they're,
I think they're violent and they're 

143
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,220
dirty and they get this.
Alice,

144
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:16,054
whoever did their pr,
you notice everybody thinks they're 

145
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,240
smart and they can read and they're 
like,

146
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,400
yeah,
they had a good pr.

147
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,234
Yeah.
Right.

148
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,440
Yeah.
Look at that.

149
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,640
We only got one up,
Jim,

150
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,610
but see how much little meat is on him.
You think there's more?

151
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,670
Look at,
he's kidding.

152
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,010
He's kidding folks.
He's not eating owls.

153
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,290
The one in the middle,
it looks like it's from another planet,

154
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,330
you know?
Yeah.

155
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,190
Yeah.
And that's what,

156
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,200
that's what it really looks like.
That's what it looks like.

157
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,573
Fluff.
That's a little bit a little alien 

158
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:46,390
raptor creature.
I was like a crab.

159
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,550
It looks like a crab.
I was driving home on one,

160
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:52,240
was flying above me on the road and 
dropped a rabbit.

161
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,493
He had got a rabbit and jacked it.
It's flying with the rabbit and as he 

162
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:58,250
was flying,
just decided

163
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,083
like maybe decided the car was too close
to him or it was too loud or something 

164
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,194
like that.
I just dropped that rabbits at fuck it 

165
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,380
and I stopped the car and to check it 
out.

166
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:07,280
I was like,
whoa.

167
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,620
That's flirt and really it sounds like 
flirting.

168
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,200
LFL drops a rabbit at your feet.
A bitch.

169
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,360
It's ready to fuck.
Probably.

170
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,710
Yeah,
like an offering.

171
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,150
Look,
that guy for you more.

172
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:22,151
With that came maybe
predators.

173
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:24,440
Men.
They,

174
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,110
we never thought of him growing up as 
predators.

175
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah,
that's all they told us.

176
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,180
They were wise.
They had that,

177
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,250
that Monica like fucking like Budd 
Friedman.

178
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,240
You'd need the Improv.
I remember that.

179
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,760
I'll like that.
Planter's peanut,

180
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,790
but Friedman from evening at the Improv.
His whole deal was yet I loved evening.

181
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:46,010
At the Improv when I was a kid.
Oh Man.

182
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,740
That was like one of the reasons why I 
got into standup comedy.

183
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,573
I still watch these TV shows.
They had syndicated TV shows that they 

184
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:54,140
would do,
you know,

185
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,860
vh one had one mtv at the half hour 
comedy hour.

186
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,620
And what time did it come on it?
I don't remember man.

187
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,880
I don't remember.
That was bud,

188
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:04,460
but it was probably the last night.
He looks like that planters nut.

189
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,400
But Daniel,
one of the owners,

190
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,210
uh,
he sold it eventually and Chitchatting,

191
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,680
cashed out about from Brian Friedman in 
the left corner.

192
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,240
That's a different dude.
Yeah.

193
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,730
Interesting.
A lot of freedoms out there.

194
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,170
Um,
but anyway,

195
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,080
Bud ran,
uh,

196
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,800
he was the host of evening at the Improv
and he would come out with that monocle.

197
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,850
Go back to that Monica picture again,
lower left.

198
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,830
Bam.
That was him.

199
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,000
See Google Budd Friedman evening at the 
Improv.

200
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,350
That's widget.
Okay.

201
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,670
Yeah.
Nice guy.

202
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,930
Real,
real nice guy.

203
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,970
And Yeah,
he was real nice guy.

204
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,410
Always,
always a sweetheart to me.

205
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,150
Always very,
very friendly.

206
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,600
He was a very gregarious guy and he um,
uh,

207
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,483
basically he was one of the original 
owners of the evening of the Improv and 

208
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,440
evening at the Improv.
I don't know.

209
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,540
I don't know the full history of the 
Improv.

210
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,540
I probably should,
but I think I want to say it started out

211
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,680
in New York.
Yeah.

212
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,113
Cause I know there were wars,
there were ones everywhere at one point 

213
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:02,804
in time.
They had one in Boston for a little bit 

214
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,420
and Improv.
Yeah.

215
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:06,254
Yeah.
They had one in Boston and then they 

216
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:12,521
changed it to a different name.
I started hell's kitchen and 1963.

217
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:16,070
Yeah.
So that was probably one of the original

218
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:19,610
standup comedy clubs.
Probably one of the top two or three.

219
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,970
Do you have a favorite like a club when 
you were like doing clubs more?

220
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:23,804
Do you have like a favorite one?
I was just happy to get on stage back 

221
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:27,410
then,
you know.

222
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,243
I mean I had favorite ones like nick's 
comedy stop was always a favorite in 

223
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,180
Boston.
Right.

224
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,910
Stitches but stitches moved a couple of 
times.

225
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,390
Stitches moved twice.
What about any of the funny bones or did

226
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:40,490
you go to any of those places?
Yeah,

227
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,353
well,
but the,

228
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,253
for the Boston club,
the comedy connection was the big one 

229
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,653
and now that's the Wilbur theater.
It's really weird because it used to be 

230
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,120
the smallest club in town.
Everybody wanted to work at,

231
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:53,480
it was like a hundred Ooh,
I want to say they get stuff,

232
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:56,190
maybe 150 people in there,
but I mean he'd stuffed,

233
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,330
I mean this room,
this,

234
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,250
this ceiling was low,
you know,

235
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,340
I mean I'm five,
eight and I remember I could,

236
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,290
I'm pretty sure I could touch the 
ceiling.

237
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,170
So this shit is low.
So if you were like,

238
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,700
Oh and Smith or you know,
so and tall it along on,

239
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,000
yeah,
that's a big ass stage for you.

240
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,970
Like big people would look real weird on
that stage,

241
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,160
but the laughs would be so contained.
It was so low.

242
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:22,320
Ceiling and tight.
I love that.

243
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,380
Great.
I saw Hicks there for the first time.

244
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,410
First Time I ever saw him was there.
I was like,

245
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,290
whoa.
He was doing this bit about Jimi Hendrix

246
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:35,800
meeting a tiffany at the mall.
Tiffany the arm sanger here.

247
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,430
Cause she was real popular then.
Yeah.

248
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,603
Yeah.
Oh that song I'm making you just be a 

249
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,504
wreck.
I remember being on the school bus so 

250
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,430
fucking wrecked bro.

251
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,640
Dude,
I remember that Shit Bro.

252
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,130
Did I love being erect and I was young 
man.

253
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,590
Now it's whatever.
Now it's whatever.

254
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,950
I have to do something now.
What are you,

255
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,580
you know what does my Dick need me to 
do?

256
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,930
Right?
It's like eat now.

257
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,350
So
I'll tell you this.

258
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,190
If you want to feed a family of four,
you can't just have one hour.

259
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,053
I will say that though.
Well if you look at what it looks like 

260
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,100
without the feathers,
it looks like saying fucking demon.

261
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,503
You know it's a real bait and switch.
I feel like that's when the gods hidden 

262
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:15,924
agenda.
So I was talking to someone about 

263
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:17,754
peacocks about this and I started 
talking about it on stage that like 

264
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:21,570
peacocks are pretty,
but if you took their feathers off,

265
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:24,290
you'd want kill it with a hammer.
Like what is that thing?

266
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,950
Fuck is that.

267
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,380
He wouldn't let that thing anywhere near
your kids.

268
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,510
Look,
peacocks have their feathers on you.

269
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:32,610
Let your kids get right close to him.
Oh yeah,

270
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,470
but beautiful.
No feathers.

271
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Dark skin like charcoal covered scary 
and the little nubs all over it.

272
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,180
I'll look.
Hey,

273
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,210
fuck.
Look at that.

274
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,143
It looks like lane murderer.
It looks like a little twink out on the 

275
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,290
town.
A little creepy murder.

276
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,343
A little bit.
Probably a little gray and pink 

277
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:52,560
murderer.
Who is that what?

278
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:53,394
It looks like?
What?

279
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,740
Whoa.
Is that a real,

280
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,750
I'm like duck face.
I don't know.

281
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,501
Yeah,
that's a duck,

282
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,210
bro.
It says peacock.

283
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,063
That is something else that a minute 
think they'll go back up to the peacock 

284
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:05,070
picture.
They have a different head.

285
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,170
Go back to that peacock picture that you
just had.

286
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,210
Oh my God.
That's a totally different head.

287
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,500
Like the beak shape different.

288
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,560
That's the problem with the Internet.
Yeah,

289
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,180
you can't,
it's so hard to tell.

290
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:17,930
That's a duck son.
Who is is a duck.

291
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,770
Maybe it's on that page or something 
like that.

292
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,761
Well,
it says right there,

293
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:24,990
it said feathers ripped from live birds.
Didn't ripping the feathers off.

294
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:27,330
Peak car hits a nice guy.
What was he like?

295
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:28,170
Did you meet him?
Meet him?

296
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:30,500
I met him like hi,
like hey,

297
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,640
so I was,
I wasn't open.

298
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:33,850
Miker oh yeah.
Oh,

299
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,610
he ain't going to talk to me.
Yeah.

300
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,810
It's like,
you know,

301
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,530
I say hi to everybody.
I run into like door guys.

302
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:44,250
I always try to say hi to everybody 
because I remember what it was like when

303
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:47,160
I was an open miker and seeing these 
guys where I couldn't even talk,

304
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:49,440
couldn't even imagine that we were the 
same thing.

305
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,350
Couldn't talk to them.
You know what I mean?

306
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,830
Like the big Comedians,
you mean?

307
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,950
Fuck yeah,
like Bill Hicks would come into town.

308
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,700
I didn't want to say hi to him.
It'd be super annoying.

309
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,370
Right.
Cause then what do you back it up with?

310
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:03,130
That was always my thing.
I was so stupid back then too,

311
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,430
and I'm pretty dumb now,
but it was really dumb back then.

312
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,313
Yeah,
there was no way I had anything to say 

313
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:09,424
to that dude.
And you think there was a time of your 

314
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:11,434
life,
you are the dumbest that you'd ever 

315
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:14,230
been?
Probably a couple of weeks ago.

316
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,300
Let me know.
I don't know Matt,

317
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,400
but I definitely have more data to work 
with now,

318
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:22,234
but I've forgotten a lot of shit too.
But like you think there's generally a 

319
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:28,580
time in people's lives when they,
what they should know kind of.

320
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,414
And the,
there's like a kind of like a middle 

321
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:31,504
ground where maybe it doesn't.
Well for sure when I was in my early 

322
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,600
twenties for sure when I was in my 
twenties like deep into my,

323
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,330
you know,
it took me into my thirties to f kind of

324
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:41,164
fucking shit.
Shake my head loose and figure out what 

325
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:44,860
the fuck I was doing.
Yeah.

326
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:47,960
Do your 20 bro,
when you think about twenties right?

327
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,360
No direction.
No idea whether or not this comedy thing

328
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:53,740
was going to work out.
I'm like,

329
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:55,990
what am I doing?
I'm telling jokes.

330
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,980
Jesus Christ and yeah,
and then telling people when you go back

331
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:02,110
home and they've never seen you,
they've never heard of you.

332
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,440
They think you're gay.
Like they're like,

333
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,274
you keep flying home,
you don't have any money and you're not 

334
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:09,240
bringing a girl home.
You have.

335
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,470
Yeah.
You're hiding from Samsung,

336
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,180
you know,
just come out.

337
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:14,014
I remember my Stepdad is yelling at me 
in the yard one time told you to come 

338
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:16,571
out.
Yeah.

339
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:17,680
I was like,
I'm not fucking gay,

340
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:18,514
Bro.
Like I'm just not flying some girl home 

341
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:21,890
that I just met,
you know?

342
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,090
Just approved to catch it.
Catch it.

343
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:27,420
A lie.
Yeah.

344
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,430
He thought maybe he was going to leave a
a yeah.

345
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:32,080
Like a going to set a trap.
Yeah.

346
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:34,080
It's going to set a trap.
Setting the trap.

347
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,800
Yeah.
He's like a slick boxer.

348
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,410
I said,
boy,

349
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,030
what the fuck?
That's one of the reasons why young boys

350
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,590
would always accuse each other being 
gay,

351
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:52,720
because it's so hard to prove.
You're not,

352
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:53,960
yeah,
so hard.

353
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,900
But someone says you're gay.
Like you take that off me.

354
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,363
It's crazy.
The worst has gotta be if someone says 

355
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:07,090
you gay and you are,
but you don't want to know.

356
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:07,924
Yeah,
that'd be sick.

357
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,330
Yeah.
You changed your clothes.

358
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,164
The next day he'd come dressed like an a
mafi outfit or something like something 

359
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:16,360
to totally take them hot off the trail.
You know,

360
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,730
you just wish you could say you were,
you know,

361
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:21,330
you wish you could tell you were.
I think now you can.

362
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:23,980
I think it,
I think still can a lot of places.

363
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,631
It is.
I mean,

364
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,450
I would love to think that everybody's 
like the people that are around us where

365
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:32,500
they literally don't give a fuck if 
you're Justin Martindale or look,

366
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,530
our language is funny and after that 
it's cool to be around.

367
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,090
Those are the things that are most 
valuable in our world.

368
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,940
Funny and cool to be around.
Those two things.

369
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,430
Someone's funny and cool to be around.
We don't give a fuck if you're a guy,

370
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:48,460
a girl,
trans,

371
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:50,620
gay,
funny ghost.

372
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,231
Cool.
The bureau.

373
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:52,064
You can be heroes.
Yeah.

374
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,480
Do you think this goes to the comedy 
store?

375
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,090
I,
I don't know.

376
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,983
I have some friends that are,
the other day I was trying to give them 

377
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:01,694
the whole tour and tell them how it used
to be Ciro's nightclub bugs and them 

378
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,290
downstairs to own it.
I didn't take them all the way,

379
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:10,580
but I showed them,
you know you go through the back room of

380
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:11,414
the main room.
Did that used to be like their hide out 

381
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,010
and shit?
I told,

382
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,460
I told them about all the ghost stories 
that had been filmed there,

383
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,280
but I don't believe it.
I don't think it's real.

384
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,490
Well I think I'm surprised we don't have
more ghosts to animals.

385
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,500
You know what I think,
I think it's you.

386
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,920
This is what I think for real.
I think when you,

387
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,980
I think you can probably tune in to 
something that happened in a place.

388
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,280
That's what I think.
And I think if you trip yourself out,

389
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,770
you could see things that aren't really 
there.

390
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,800
And I think that it is entirely 
possible.

391
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,970
The ghosts aren't real,
but that you seeing a ghost is real.

392
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,860
But I think that you can get your body 
into like such a frenzied,

393
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,430
terrified state.
And if you are open to the idea that the

394
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:01,070
ghost is a real thing,
your mind can fuck with you.

395
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,253
Like the ghetto boys,
your mind's playing tricks on you and 

396
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,910
me.
Yeah,

397
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,740
that's what I think.
I think legitimately.

398
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,590
And I also think that if you hit the 
right frequency,

399
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,693
I bet you get hold up like a,
just a ghost of a memory of someone 

400
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:15,650
getting killed in a place or something 
horrible happening.

401
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:17,930
Just a ghost of a memory.
Oh,

402
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:18,764
I think that's next.
That's one of the next things you're 

403
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,040
gonna be able to do,
like a gang sign in the air,

404
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,874
a special gang sign and then a fucking,
the truth is going to pop out right in 

405
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:25,370
front of you.

406
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,203
Like I think we're going to start to 
learn like Harry Potter type shit or 

407
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,463
like maybe a song.
What if the cer a certain like playing 

408
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:32,354
of us lyrics or our notes in a row would
reveal like the past right in front of 

409
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:37,260
you.
Like I wonder if there's some Ma,

410
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,470
you know,
magic little warp poles or something.

411
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,930
Well,
we'll think about what music does.

412
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:45,860
Do music literally changes the way your 
body feels like a drug.

413
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,660
Like if you were a kid,
okay.

414
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,020
And you heard that rocky song 
[inaudible] you could run faster,

415
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,100
you would get more fired up.
You'd be able to do more pushups,

416
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,490
Chin ups,
Stepdad.

417
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,160
Don't say it.
Do it yet,

418
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:03,560
but you will probably a lot of dudes 
probably.

419
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,880
But the point is you would for sure get 
energy from that.

420
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,050
Like a drug.
Yeah,

421
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:10,400
cause that was a cup of coffee.
You'd be like,

422
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:13,410
Woo,
this coffee coffee's good.

423
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,590
Right?
You hear that song

424
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,680
put up that video the other day.
Oh yeah,

425
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:21,260
that got video that I repost it.
Vibration sand.

426
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,123
Yeah.
If you look deep into this topic of 

427
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:27,380
vibrations and symbols that come out and
like what we're talking about,

428
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,210
it's kind of difficult card.
Yeah.

429
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,343
I posted it on my instagram.
I re posted it because it's really 

430
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:33,494
fascinating.
It seems like it's just a mat that's 

431
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:37,784
charged yet being vibrated.
So let's explain what's happening for 

432
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:41,294
the people that you just listen,
I'm going to play this video cause 

433
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:43,850
they're probably get taken down.
It's got a lot of views.

434
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:46,430
There's lots of different versions of 
this online.

435
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,100
It says amazing,
amazing,

436
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,560
amazing resonance experiment.
So they put some,

437
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:53,520
Sam,
is it Sam?

438
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,260
This is probably salt.
Okay.

439
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,143
They put some sort of powdered stuff,
sand or salt onto a black mat that's 

440
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,370
charged and then they send certain hurts
through it.

441
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,213
This one's 3,835 hertz.
And then it makes a different patterns 

442
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,333
on the,
look at this 3,975 like every time they 

443
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:14,934
changed the hertz,
it has a different penalty that 4,049 

444
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,900
look at this pattern.
So these hurts are waiting.

445
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:21,750
It's unbelievable.

446
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,810
Uh,
you can take these numbers and these can

447
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:26,800
also be,
um,

448
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,090
notes that you're seeing on a piano or 
you used to hearing her singing.

449
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,080
So these can also be recreated and other
ways in are probably happening.

450
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,880
And to us that's how like maybe one of 
those,

451
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:41,230
uh,
ear warmer here,

452
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,450
like Victoria,
you're in the back of your neck,

453
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,180
vibrators

454
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,013
like that.
What if a certain hertz just spelled 

455
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:49,310
your like your grandparents name?
Well,

456
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:53,150
what's interesting is that each one of 
them are different geometric patterns.

457
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,970
They're these beautiful patterns.
They're gorgeous.

458
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:59,300
And as you change the hurts,
the patterns morph immediately.

459
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,050
Yeah.
And,

460
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,990
but the thing is they're kind of 
fractal,

461
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,020
like not fractal,
but they seem to be,

462
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,070
uh,
what's the word?

463
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,310
Equal on both sides that this is what 
I'm looking for.

464
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,470
Parallel.
No,

465
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,373
no,

466
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,900
I think you are,
you're on the right topic.

467
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,833
If the numbers a little more a round,
like a round number of these are not 

468
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,030
specific hurts.
Like if you do a specific yeah,

469
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,190
different than identical.
But anyway,

470
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,490
they're both sides are exactly the same 
and it's separated in this one.

471
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,500
They're not,
it's not separated in a half.

472
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,281
It's,
it's,

473
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:33,540
it's all like the circle is a center and
it all goes out from there.

474
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,930
But they're different every time.
But they're all even like see it lifts,

475
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:37,764
the only thing that's keeping it from 
being perfect is that they run out of 

476
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,074
sand and it looks like the power is 
centered around the center part where 

477
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,900
the wires are connected to.
So that's the most potent.

478
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,320
But so that can beautiful.
So that may like if you think about that

479
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,154
like in a shake,
maybe if there's a certain hertz going 

480
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:53,334
through the air like in space,
then it would form like a solar system 

481
00:19:58,471 --> 00:19:59,304
against one better.
The feeling that you get from like 

482
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:02,460
rocky,
right.

483
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:04,770
The feeling that you get from that song,
not the duck,

484
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,770
that things going through your badass.
Yeah.

485
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:10,720
It literally could be like a little drug
look.

486
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:14,490
Think about why people like music so 
much.

487
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,670
Cause that musician is your drug dealer.
Yeah.

488
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,810
Okay.
You hear like some old Elton John,

489
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,950
like you're in your car and Saturday 
night comes on your fucking goosebumps.

490
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,120
If you haven't heard that song in a long
time and you don't expect it.

491
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,703
Oh fuck yeah.
JSC had friend that would make you want 

492
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:38,850
to,
you know that's a good song too,

493
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,320
but that vibe is good.

494
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,320
This was done with my,
like I was saying with musical notes.

495
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:44,970
Wow.

496
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,040
On water.
We're looking at the thing,

497
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,130
it says the Saima

498
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,010
scope.
Is that how you say that c.

499
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,853
Y m a scope uses a high definition 
camera to monitor the effects of an 

500
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:57,550
individual.
Sounds particular vibrations on purified

501
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:01,000
water revealing for the first time.
What piano notes look like.

502
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,080
There are people out there so much 
smarter than you and me.

503
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,480
Oh yeah.
Oh God.

504
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,423
It's,
it's amazing that we're considered the 

505
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,980
same thing.
You know what?

506
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:13,690
Smart people,
really smart people.

507
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:16,020
They're going to have someone like Shawn
Carolyn,

508
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:21,030
the physicist and he has to break down 
particle physics and shit to you.

509
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:22,330
You like,
is it hard?

510
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,720
It doesn't even get in,
does he?

511
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,370
I I can repeat what he said.
Yeah,

512
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,403
don't the fuck it means like when people
start talking about quantum quantum 

513
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:34,600
things and quantum theory and quantum 
particles as danger.

514
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,820
Dude,
I don't get,

515
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,480
I don't trust that kind of stuff.
A lot of it.

516
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,560
Well,
how about,

517
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,393
you know what superposition is,
is the ultimate what the fuck we're a 

518
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,750
particle can be in a state of motion and
be still at the same time.

519
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,000
I like,
well good luck with that.

520
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,000
Good luck.
This magic world that you've created.

521
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,150
Crazy scientist that I don't understand.
Yeah.

522
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:57,130
I would rather do something more chill 
than that.

523
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,200
What the fuck?
Something can stay now.

524
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,223
Sign up like or go for a run or 
something being rather than study that 

525
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:05,620
are rather than be that particle.
Oh,

526
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,020
rather than study that and be,
yeah,

527
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:08,560
I it like,
I just think,

528
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,440
but don't you want someone to know cause
don't,

529
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:13,720
you'd benefit from cell phones.
Well what about the,

530
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,640
the th th th such few people know that 
if they all want it to lie to us,

531
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,950
then they could,
they would have to be conspiracy.

532
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,450
Now you starting to sound like some 
other people.

533
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:23,284
I know.

534
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,730
Let's go get some tin foil.
But

535
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,620
while I didn't know that,
that,

536
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,961
that,
that,

537
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:34,870
so that's funny that,
that your body would do that.

538
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,733
The reason why they would never do that 
is because scientists whole deal is 

539
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,410
figuring out shit that other scientists 
didn't figure out.

540
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:46,030
That's like the best thing they can do.
The best thing is scientists can do is a

541
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:50,260
real honest to goodness breakthrough.
Would you have sex with a scientist,

542
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:51,440
you think?
Yeah,

543
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,920
like a movie scientists.
Like she keeps the glasses on.

544
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,143
Yeah.
They're always blonde in the movies 

545
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,720
right now.
Sometimes a dark black hair too.

546
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,400
Stereos.
I bet they're clean too.

547
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:04,510
If you fuck a scientist yet,
I bet they have a clean apartment maybe,

548
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,493
but maybe not.
Maybe their fucking brain is like that 

549
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:10,700
chalkboard with all the squiggly alien 
mathematics are high.

550
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,543
That's Cherry la getting tattooed.
It's a bunch of dirty math tattooed or 

551
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:15,790
on their posts.

552
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,623
I was reading this there,
but I was reading this thing about 

553
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,143
Richard Fineman.
You knew who fineman was fine was a 

554
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,950
scientist.
He was a physicist and a,

555
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,210
there was an article about him,
like was fineman and abuser,

556
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,203
but,
um,

557
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,460
it was,
it was talking about Richard Fineman and

558
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:34,510
how,
you know,

559
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:36,300
he used to,
he just,

560
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
his wife said he's just do nothing but 
calculations all day.

561
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,834
And then he wanted to play the bongos 
and he didn't want anybody to bother 

562
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,560
him.
But like,

563
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,620
he had a quote from one of his,
uh,

564
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,330
one of his books and it's crazy reading 
it.

565
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:51,620
It's like,
uh,

566
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,860
I just,
uh,

567
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,710
but see if he could find it because it's
a really,

568
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,950
it's a crazy quote calling women 
bitches.

569
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,900
And I'm like,
what?

570
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,570
Like that there were that,
that,

571
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:03,560
you know,
I just,

572
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,394
uh,
I don't want to paraphrase it because I 

573
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:05,781
was like,
I don't want to,

574
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:06,141
I don't,
I,

575
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:07,850
I can't deal with these bitches around 
here.

576
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,750
So I think he was a funny guy,
right?

577
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,653
Is what I think it's hard.
It's hard when you see things in text 

578
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:14,510
because you think,
okay,

579
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,000
maybe he's like a really mean terrible 
person.

580
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,133
See,
I adopted the attitude that those bar 

581
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:22,820
girls were all bitches,
that they aren't worth anything and that

582
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:23,654
they're all in the,
all they're in there for is for to get 

583
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:30,050
you to buy him a drink and they're not 
going to give you a God damn thing.

584
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,710
I'm not going to be a gentleman to such 
worthless bitches and so on.

585
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:34,491
He writes,
see,

586
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:36,470
but I feel like,
and so on when someone says,

587
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:37,304
and so on,
that implies that this is taken out of 

588
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:43,220
context in my mind is I want to know 
what does that mean and so on.

589
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,950
That means to me,
what I'm getting out of this,

590
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:46,983
if I,
if I was going to guess is that he goes 

591
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:49,880
on,
he elaborates,

592
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,043
he might say,
this is how I felt back then and 

593
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:54,260
obviously I changed my mind.

594
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,070
I mean he could have been 18 when you're
talking about this or 16.

595
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,670
I don't know what the fuck is this is 
about.

596
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,850
But he also could be very funny because 
he was apparently a very funny guy.

597
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,193
So his,
the title of his book is surely you're 

598
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,740
joking Mr Fiman.
Aww,

599
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,620
that's nice then.
But if it,

600
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,180
so like if one,
if someone said that,

601
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,243
but I dumped it,
all these bar girls are bitches and say 

602
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:19,430
said it funny.
Could you see those,

603
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,323
those same,
I thought they had all these balls 

604
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,963
bitches,
but it's all different depending upon 

605
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:27,050
how old he is too.
Or it could be that,

606
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:29,480
that's really how he was.
And maybe he got married,

607
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:31,370
maybe got in trouble,
his wife and he had to say this.

608
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,470
You know,
I don't think that's it.

609
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:34,820
I think he's talking about when he was 
younger,

610
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,680
but it's,
um,

611
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,670
I could see that though.

612
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,503
Do.
You're at the bar if you don't like 

613
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:41,900
we're loud music and all the girls are 
just drinking with a bunch of,

614
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,861
I'll be like,
oh,

615
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:44,450
these girls are a bunch of bitches.
Probably.

616
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,950
Yeah,
but that's a lazy way.

617
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:47,690
If it is a lazy way thing and it just 
makes it,

618
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,120
it's you can judge and you can control 
the scenario.

619
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,020
Yeah.
Thing is,

620
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,853
look,
if you go into a room and 10 girls are 

621
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:57,950
in there and seven of them are fucking 
super annoying and you say these bitches

622
00:25:57,951 --> 00:25:58,784
are all annoying,
you're being super rude to those three 

623
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:04,100
that aren't and there might be some 
decent girls,

624
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:04,934
but that's why it's weird.
It's like it's weird to hear like high 

625
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:09,074
level famous scientists probably.
I think in the article they were saying 

626
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:14,810
the second fee.
Yeah.

627
00:26:14,811 --> 00:26:17,930
Beyond uh,
beyond Einstein.

628
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,570
He's the second famous most famous 
physicist.

629
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,000
Especially a scientist.
Because you think a scientist would know

630
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:25,470
that there's a couple of these bitches 
could be variables.

631
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,670
I'm thinking this might have been a 
quote from him when he was young.

632
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,680
Yeah.
That's crazy.

633
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:34,160
Then I think that he said that or him 
criticizing himself when he was young,

634
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,630
but I don't know.
I'm just guessing.

635
00:26:35,631 --> 00:26:38,840
I was hoping that it would be that bad.
It's crazy to read that.

636
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,050
Do it a lot.
Sometimes I miss being young man.

637
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:46,080
Don't you miss it sometimes?
Well no and yes.

638
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,153
Like it looks like fun to have no 
responsibility and to be 22 and be 

639
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:51,534
backpacking around the world are doing 
something silly and not having a place 

640
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,400
where you have to go or a bunch of 
bills.

641
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:57,234
But on the other hand,
I feel so fucking ridiculously lucky 

642
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,183
that I get to be a comedian.
Like I don't want to try to do this 

643
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:09,930
again.

644
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,763
Yeah.
Why would I try to do this when I'm 

645
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:13,750
doing this?
Like,

646
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,870
but yeah,
but to go back out of Smith's,

647
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:16,704
being young and like member a nat man,
we took a nap and you were young and 

648
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:20,144
could last.
He fucking getting care could last for 

649
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:22,320
three days.
Yes.

650
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:23,154
But I think one of the secrets to 
happiness is to never look back at any 

651
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:30,960
point in your life and wish you were 
back there because a,

652
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:32,490
it's not possible.
Right,

653
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:34,260
and B,
if you didn't go through that,

654
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:37,980
you wouldn't be you.
If you would go back now and be 22 again

655
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:40,740
and broke and fucked up with all the 
information you have now,

656
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:41,610
he'd be like,
shit,

657
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,430
y'all don't know.
I had a fucking Netflix special.

658
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,320
You guys don't know how I was killing it
out there.

659
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,380
I decided to start over like an asshole.
Now here I am.

660
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,011
Yeah,
I'm young,

661
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:51,870
but I'm broke.
I can't even afford vitamins.

662
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,740
What the fuck?
I don't want to be.

663
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,910
That guy gets a birthing.
Joe Wants.

664
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:59,730
It's a good,
I work out hard,

665
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:01,400
man.
I got to take care of my body.

666
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,510
You're right.
Feed it the right food.

667
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:05,870
I can't afford a ramen noodle and eating
ramen noodles everyday.

668
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,530
I'm going to get started breaking 
joints.

669
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,460
Yeah,
whenever was tear muscles and shit.

670
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,180
Then you're going to be now let me 
fucking catching squirrels in my yard.

671
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:16,014
That's when it gets bad.
I'm not sure what to do when y'all done 

672
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:18,564
either.
I missed my body being young dude and 

673
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:21,390
like,
how old are you?

674
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,700
I'm 38 shut your mouth.
You're fine.

675
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,140
You just got to work out.
Yeah.

676
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,070
He didn't work out.
Huh?

677
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,930
I just started getting back into it.
Yeah.

678
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,793
That's all it is.
Doing some yoga and I want to go travel 

679
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,170
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

680
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,320
Downtown's slow down with that.
You carry yourself in shape first.

681
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,030
Yeah.
That's what I'm realizing my,

682
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,003
yeah,
my advice because you're trying to 

683
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:40,770
explode and get out of things that look,
don't listen to me.

684
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,250
You can start Jujitsu and be in terrible
shape and get in shape through Jujitsu.

685
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,111
You can.
Yeah,

686
00:28:45,111 --> 00:28:49,140
absolutely.
But if I was going to advise someone,

687
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,380
I would say if you're going to do 
something that's his physical,

688
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:53,214
his Jujitsu,
I believe that you should arm or your 

689
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:57,600
body.
What I mean by that,

690
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:00,300
it's like your shoulders,
your knees,

691
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,860
your back,
your neck.

692
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,830
Those are all areas that if you don't 
work out at all,

693
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,430
they could break susceptible.
They're susceptible,

694
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:12,150
so I would always advise that someone 
does a bunch of calisthenics,

695
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,940
particularly like,
like the classics,

696
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:16,260
pushups,
sit ups,

697
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:18,450
bodyweight squats,
chin-ups,

698
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,460
those,
all those classics.

699
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Do a lot of those get you just get your 
body accustomed to resistance training.

700
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,800
Do that first.
Then I would move from the,

701
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,990
I would always start with the,
with calisthenics.

702
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,260
Always start with that and then from 
that move into weights.

703
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,720
Do like some kettlebells take a couple 
of months.

704
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:37,554
You could take a couple months before 
you just jump right into Jujitsu if you 

705
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,194
don't have,
but if you're an athlete then you could 

706
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:42,184
just jump right in.

707
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,590
If you're a guy already does basketball,
you already wrestled.

708
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,640
Oh yeah,
jump right in.

709
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,130
But a guy who doesn't do any exercise at
all.

710
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,150
Yeah.
Jujitsu.

711
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:50,740
So rough on you.
Yeah.

712
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:52,630
I used to do extra as him and I used to 
do,

713
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,840
did we shoot up steroids and the side of
the interstate when I was growing up?

714
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,030
Shoot on the side of the road.
Why wouldn't you go home?

715
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,670
I was more of an outdoor thing.
I felt like,

716
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,883
you know,
I didn't want to bring that sit in the 

717
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:04,450
house forever,
but we would,

718
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:05,284
uh,
me and a buddy of mine is do billy 

719
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:10,360
confort toe actually,
and he passed away our Ip and he died.

720
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:13,030
He had a bunch of pills and actually 
drove into an embankment one time.

721
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:14,670
But,
um,

722
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,020
oh yeah.
Can you imagine?

723
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:18,580
It's about where to go.
And He,

724
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,414
uh,
but he was a busboy and I was a busboy 

725
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,670
and he would,
uh,

726
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,730
and yet we both like to go to the gym 
and he was like the first gay man that I

727
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:28,564
ever met.

728
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,040
And then he,
um,

729
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,210
you know,
he,

730
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:34,300
one time he got us some steroids or 
something,

731
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:35,920
I don't know.
I think everybody was doing them.

732
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,380
And then we just,
yeah,

733
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:41,440
we'd pull over and do them and then just
go to the gym.

734
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,410
You know,
do one time a guy in New York said,

735
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:45,850
I'm going to get some drugs.
The middle of the night,

736
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:48,280
he went and came back three hours later 
it was steroids.

737
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,870
He's like,
you want to fucking party?

738
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:50,840
Wow.
Whose party?

739
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,630
It was still raw.
Like fuck no bro,

740
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,460
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I was there for about eight months.

741
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,383
How come?
So I was just kind of trying out the 

742
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:01,270
comedy scene there and seeing what it 
was like.

743
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,600
Why did you decide to leave?
I don't know.

744
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,760
I guess I just wanted like a new,
here's what it was.

745
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:07,594
I'd never want it to get old and say 
that I didn't try it to go to La to try 

746
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:11,974
New York.

747
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,930
Oh,
I see.

748
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,830
Right.
To never have even just six months.

749
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,810
Even just have like an experience there,
you know?

750
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,883
Well it's a hotbed for sure.
The two hot beds right now or here and 

751
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:22,390
there.
Yeah,

752
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,750
those are the two hot beds and there's 
all this debate as to like,

753
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,820
which one's better or whatever.
It's silly.

754
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,350
That's,
that's a great hotbed.

755
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,753
No denying that.
There's some world class comedians over 

756
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:35,140
there and then there's ones that show up
there and here,

757
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:36,970
like Chappelle.
He's always bounce,

758
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,823
bounce it back and forth.
Chris Rock was always bouncing back and 

759
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:41,200
forth.
Louie would news working in here,

760
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,230
but when Louise working again,
he's working at the Improv right now.

761
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,060
Who is he came to San Jose.
Yeah.

762
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,530
Oh Wow.
That's cool.

763
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,560
I think he's going to sell it a world 
tour and like a year for sure.

764
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,880
For sure.
Her next month.

765
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,870
Even if we want it to.

766
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,070
Yeah,
for sure.

767
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,390
You know,
I mean it's,

768
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:58,480
it's interesting this whole bit about 
the parkland shooting.

769
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,600
Oh yeah.
Saw that stirred up all this controversy

770
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,440
that is so,
it's such a Louis ck bit.

771
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:07,960
It's interesting.
It's almost like people don't understand

772
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:09,940
what kind of comedy he did.
Right?

773
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,913
Yeah.
It's like suddenly they forget who he 

774
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:12,211
was.
We,

775
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:13,044
if you look at his comedy,
you're not even surprised that he was 

776
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:15,010
jerking off,
you know,

777
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,080
kind of room service sorta deal,
you know?

778
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,570
But he's,
he's,

779
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:22,960
his style has always been like that.
I mean that he's,

780
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,530
his style is always very irreverent.
Yeah.

781
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,393
Saying fucked up shit.
You can't believe he's saying and you 

782
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:32,500
know,
well written and well thought out stuff.

783
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,530
This is stuff he's working on and this 
is people like,

784
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:36,430
you know,
how could he joke?

785
00:32:36,431 --> 00:32:38,250
It wasn't even that good.
He's just,

786
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,980
he probably wrote that day

787
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,203
two days before.
Who knows how many times has done that 

788
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:44,084
bit.
But I guarantee you the guy takes 10 

789
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:48,950
months off of stand up and then he 
started to do it again.

790
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,810
I don't,
he was scared.

791
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:51,644
I bet.
I don't think I would ever joke around 

792
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:54,710
about that.
I definitely wouldn't joke around about,

793
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,280
but you can.
Yeah.

794
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,050
I don't know if I would.
It just wasn't,

795
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,990
wasn't as best stuff.
It wasn't good.

796
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,700
It's like it wasn't ready.
Yeah.

797
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,623
But maybe he could have come up with a 
different turn on it where it wouldn't 

798
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:10,970
be as offensive and it will be way 
funnier.

799
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,100
That's what working on a bid is all 
bout.

800
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,150
Right.
Like fuck,

801
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,460
look Holtzman,
Brian Holtzman.

802
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,950
If he had said that exact same thing 
that Louie said,

803
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,510
we would be howland.
Yeah.

804
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,440
We'd be in the back of the room.
Slap the table howling laughing.

805
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,230
Yeah.
It on span.

806
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,080
You don't get the talk cause you'll put 
the fucking fat kid in the way.

807
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,153
That literally,
that's a bit that if Holtzman said we 

808
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:36,920
will be crying,
we'd be slapping the table.

809
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:40,180
We'd all gather around and watch him on 
late nights anyway.

810
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:40,911
An issue.
Right.

811
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:44,330
It wouldn't be an issue at all because 
we know that it's humor is it?

812
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,950
Yeah,
it's a fucked up thing to say.

813
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,813
That's kind of the point.
The whole art form is about saying 

814
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:51,014
things that are funny sometimes saying 
things that are funny or self 

815
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:55,010
deprecating.
Sometimes they're fucked up.

816
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,980
There are always different sometimes 
saying things is,

817
00:33:57,981 --> 00:33:59,690
they're funny.
It's really adorable.

818
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,693
Sometimes someone will say something 
that's really adorable but also 

819
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,840
hilarious or your act.
This is odd,

820
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,480
odd and hilarious.
Just very,

821
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,200
very uh,
Theo Vaughn.

822
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,130
If I had to describe your act that say 
it's very theo Vaughn,

823
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,670
really?

824
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,570
Eh,
it's you,

825
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,720
you know how to do it,
but it's like everybody does it.

826
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:19,310
Different folks.
And you know,

827
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,173
you take a a set from someone who's just
working stuff out and you pretend that 

828
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:25,664
this is done.
He's probably half those words he's 

829
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:30,230
saying he's probably trying to be in the
moment.

830
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,423
He's probably got a place to go.
Kind of got some punchlines and hoping 

831
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:38,090
that he'll see something in it while 
he's doing it and working it out.

832
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,640
And then you listen to the recording and
you go,

833
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:41,900
oh,
why did I say it that way?

834
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,973
Why did I do this?
And you change that and add this and 

835
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:47,420
it's his to learn.
Yeah.

836
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,500
And then you know,
it just can't expect them all to be good

837
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:53,150
either.
Like immediately,

838
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,520
especially when the guy's been on trial,
like you know,

839
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:56,354
or Ben,
you know,

840
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,510
under that social pressure and are just 
like,

841
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:00,344
you know,
in,

842
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,183
you know,
probably been dealing with remorse and 

843
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:03,010
go to self.

844
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:03,470
How,
I don't know.

845
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,420
I mean who knows what he's been doing.
This is my,

846
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,570
this is my take on a lot of this and I 
think this is an important thing to say.

847
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,610
We can't lose our empathy.
We can't lose our compassion.

848
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,444
We Ha we,
we should be compassionate towards 

849
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,350
victims.
We could,

850
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,450
we should be compassionate towards each 
other.

851
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,284
We should beat this,
this tendency to want to stop people 

852
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:25,214
from working and being like,
there's a certain amount of time where 

853
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,973
it passes and it starts to look like you
don't want anyone to have a path to 

854
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:35,690
redemption.
Right?

855
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,070
Which is,
everyone's got to have a path to

856
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,680
a day have cause we're all faulty,
all human.

857
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,753
But there was an article about it that I
just retweeted today from a Nick 

858
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,840
Christakis who was a professor at Yale.
I,

859
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:49,890
um,
uh,

860
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:51,530
retweeted it today,
uh,

861
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,423
earlier.
It's about call out culture and the 

862
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:57,750
these people that got called out for 
things and how it destroyed their lives.

863
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,100
People that you don't even know.
And like,

864
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,270
yeah,
one small s uh,

865
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,113
a punk scene where these,
these two people got called out for 

866
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:05,700
stuff,
but it's like,

867
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,890
oh,
the subscription,

868
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,290
the goddess with a subscription to 
subscribe to the New York Times.

869
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,730
Bro,
you got to pay for good journalism.

870
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,890
I pay,
I'm having this account actually,

871
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:15,280
if you want to use,
you have a,

872
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,090
you have a time account.
I think I do.

873
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,400
I had one,
but uh,

874
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,353
I,
I tried to renew the other day and I 

875
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:23,424
couldn't because these cunts stole my 
fucking American Express card and I 

876
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:27,390
didn't get my new one yet.

877
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,540
Who did?
The people were on an some fucking piece

878
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:31,500
of shit.
Criminals.

879
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,230
Yeah.
Fucking crazy.

880
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,780
Charged up shit.
One of them was toys r us in India.

881
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,990
Oh Wow.
Okay.

882
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,353
Good.
I love seeing what people charge when 

883
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:41,490
they do steal from it.
It's kind of fun,

884
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,170
isn't it?
Isn't it crazy or like piss it,

885
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:44,010
they stole over.
You're like,

886
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,350
oh wow.
It was $1.

887
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,440
I got an Ottoman.
A lot of it was a $1 and I was like,

888
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,274
what are you doing?
If you bang that maybe they bang the 

889
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:56,010
card out for like $101 or maybe it just 
got a snack.

890
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,480
Sometimes you run in place just to get a
snack,

891
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,020
get a gum.
It was all,

892
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,910
it was all online about a receipt or 
something.

893
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:04,920
The other day was 88 cents.
Yeah.

894
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:07,020
That would be a stupid thing to hit 
someone's card for.

895
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,190
You'd want to get a jewel.

896
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,560
Yeah.
Gas is really expensive.

897
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:15,561
Vape pen
for that 29 bucks.

898
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,960
How crazy though that,
that,

899
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,590
that's the future that now it's like 
that.

900
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,600
Like I was thinking the other day that 
having a baby inside of your body,

901
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:26,620
this is going to be like the last,
yeah,

902
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,030
that's becoming retro.
They're going to take it out for sure.

903
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,840
There was a baby that was born today 
inside the amniotic sac.

904
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,420
Did you see that?
And that's a damn goldfish.

905
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:36,871
It,
no,

906
00:37:36,871 --> 00:37:37,704
it's crow.
Raisie you're seeing delicacy places 

907
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,560
inside the sack.
I mean,

908
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:47,820
I don't know what the story was because 
I'm a notorious headline reader.

909
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,680
I read headliners,
googled it,

910
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:52,530
and it's theirs.
It's not a thing.

911
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,140
It had its happens apparently.
Well,

912
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:57,210
I don't care if it happens all the time.
I want,

913
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:59,190
wanted to take incredible photos of 
babies born,

914
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,820
but it was an article that was going 
around the internet today.

915
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,820
Baby born in,
it's a video of the baby.

916
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:08,280
Move it around inside this,
uh,

917
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,900
this sack.
It's very weird.

918
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,870
It's a damn about it.
On Youtube.

919
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,980
That's a dumpling dude.
If you're downtown,

920
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,260
what is that?
Oh,

921
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,010
it's a dumpling.
It's a,

922
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:19,290
they're very small.
It's not a wow.

923
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,230
See if you can find it.
It was on.

924
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:24,690
I saw it.
I believe I saw it on instagram.

925
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,133
Let me see that baby man.
Do you think maybe when babies are born 

926
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:30,750
right when they're born,
look at that though.

927
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:33,930
That's the thing.
That's the baby inside the sac.

928
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,060
That's one of the things they us eat 
sometimes on those games shows.

929
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,043
Oh,
so I'm guessing this is a Sicilian 

930
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,310
section.
It happens once every 80,000 births.

931
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,150
That is amazing that you could see what 
the baby looks like when it's in there.

932
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,570
Holy Crap.
That's incredible easy,

933
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,381
Bro.
Oh,

934
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:51,760
it's Spanish.
It was in Spain.

935
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:53,950
Do human beings making human beings.

936
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,580
Okay,

937
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,500
that's crazy.
This is exactly what I saw.

938
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,910
This is,
this one is the exact,

939
00:38:57,911 --> 00:38:59,710
when I saw how crazy is that?

940
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,020
Okay.

941
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,853
Might be upsetting for some.
You're about to see the amniotic sac 

942
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:06,990
being opened.
It's like a old man upsetting.

943
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,700
That's how we exist.
Yeah,

944
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:09,990
but people aren't ready for life.

945
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,730
Yeah.

946
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,790
We're going to keep you from life.
We're going to keep you from everything.

947
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:14,810
There it is.
Bam.

948
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:16,370
The SAC.
Oh Shit.

949
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,293
Kids free.
Now we could see a little bit of butter 

950
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:20,210
on that one.
Oh,

951
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:21,044
Lordy.

952
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,980
Yeah.
I can't believe.

953
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,560
Do you ever think that maybe if a Bray B
is born a certain way,

954
00:39:27,561 --> 00:39:28,394
like missionary or doggy style,
that it could affect the way that they 

955
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:33,320
lived their life?
I thought about that before.

956
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,333
Well,
you should probably understand how 

957
00:39:35,151 --> 00:39:37,160
babies are born.
They have to come out ahead first.

958
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:37,994
It's your baby comes a doggy style.
You've got to spin around inside the 

959
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:40,334
womb,
literally.

960
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,353
Okay.
But what if the person is doggy style 

961
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:44,660
when they have the baby though?
Oh,

962
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:46,130
different thing.
Uh,

963
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:47,990
yeah.
You kids probably going to be a freak.

964
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,830
Yeah.
Doggy style.

965
00:39:51,831 --> 00:39:53,480
It's like we're not making love.
We're fucking,

966
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,243
yeah.
Doggy style is basically just kind of 

967
00:39:55,971 --> 00:39:56,331
pay.
Yeah.

968
00:39:56,331 --> 00:39:58,820
It's like getting to know each other 
quickly.

969
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,580
Well,
it's just a different kind of fucking,

970
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,563
yeah,

971
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,050
okay.

972
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:03,441
It's like,
oh,

973
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:05,240
this is dirty shit.
Yeah.

974
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:06,074
It's fast or slow.
Sometimes it depends on how you're 

975
00:40:08,451 --> 00:40:09,284
feeling.
Sometimes I'm a sex when I was a young 

976
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:13,610
man,
sober sex is for fucking kit is for what

977
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,800
does this with you missing your youth?
I just loved to slug me.

978
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,523
What are you doing?
I don't want to watch the lady give 

979
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:20,580
birth.
You set up a bit.

980
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,720
It's not video.
It's just like get outta here.

981
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,580
She sent it river.
She's given birth in a river.

982
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,740
It's called in the river.
You crazy bitch.

983
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,930
That's melted glaciers.
Wim Hoff birth right here.

984
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:34,640
You can get born into that for a little 
kid and if it's not warm,

985
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,720
if it's not,
then it's warm.

986
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,190
If it's warm,
it's filled bacteria.

987
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,670
Get the fuck.
Hey,

988
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,090
go hippie.
No,

989
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,343
no.
You can't have a baby in your bath tub 

990
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:51,511
if you live in fucking Brooklyn
Goddamn hospital down the street.

991
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,020
Don't you love your kid?
Yeah,

992
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,120
he figured out a better way.
Look at this.

993
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:56,954
His lady,
first of all she is is she's an 

994
00:41:00,881 --> 00:41:01,640
Australia.
Well,

995
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,473
the spiders that are going to crawl into
her pussy right now and kill the baby 

996
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:05,714
before it even comes out.
They have a seven of the eight most 

997
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:09,680
dangerous snakes in the world or in 
Australia.

998
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:11,880
He's trying to tell my friend Adam Green
tree yesterday.

999
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:13,580
He does want to believe me.
Very.

1000
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:14,414
The brown snake.
The Australian Brown snake dude killed 

1001
00:41:16,011 --> 00:41:16,844
the shit out of you all.
Kill that little fucking creek bitch 

1002
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:21,410
speaking Australian Brown snake.
That's how she got pregnant in the first

1003
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:24,280
place.
You see what I did there?

1004
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,520
Did a lot of land.
My sister once got knocked up by brother

1005
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:29,354
once,
man.

1006
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,350
All over.
No.

1007
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,620
Yeah,
almost high.

1008
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,100
What's almost he fucked?
I mean,

1009
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:35,840
I don't know if they fucked,
but they will.

1010
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,940
That's all most they were thinking about
baby names,

1011
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:40,250
so it assume that they had had some type
of interaction.

1012
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,200
Oh,
so they were going to do it on purpose?

1013
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,200
I don't know.
I think that they're thinking about baby

1014
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:46,950
names in case they fucked up.
Boy,

1015
00:41:46,951 --> 00:41:48,410
that's weird.
Planning ahead.

1016
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:51,260
How much wear a condom or,
but I think that's a dude's move.

1017
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,094
If you think you might've knocked the 
girl up and you're still want to stay 

1018
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:54,381
with her,
you'd be like,

1019
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:55,690
Oh,
let's talk about baby names t.

1020
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,650
You know what I'm saying?
Until you ride out that,

1021
00:41:57,651 --> 00:41:59,400
until you bail that menstrual cycle.
No,

1022
00:41:59,401 --> 00:42:02,340
until you know that the menstrual cycle.
Oh yeah.

1023
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,130
You know?
Yeah.

1024
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,680
Can people will cycle on a full moon or 
not?

1025
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,543
It's a weird thing if you are,
you having sex with somebody and you 

1026
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:13,400
like having sex with them but you don't 
like hanging out with them.

1027
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,580
Yeah.
That happens for guys and girls.

1028
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,920
Yeah.
Happens for a lot of guys.

1029
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:19,850
I know,
dude,

1030
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,790
it happens and girls too.
It happens.

1031
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,580
I've heard girls say that like I don't 
even like hanging out with them anymore,

1032
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:26,414
but I liked fucking them.
It's changing now and a lot more girls 

1033
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:32,780
are being very much like guys used to 
be.

1034
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,270
Well they can be the,
the first,

1035
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:37,460
the birth control pill,
then dating apps,

1036
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,450
they can get ahold of people and money.
They know they have options.

1037
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,523
Yeah.
But the,

1038
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,360
the thing about this,
um,

1039
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,510
about uh,
uh,

1040
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,130
dating apps,
it's like,

1041
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,050
that's kind of be just as weird as 
dating for girl.

1042
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,083
Yeah.
It was weird or maybe right because 

1043
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,590
Pete,
you can't even see the person,

1044
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,570
right?
I mean you can see pictures of them.

1045
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:00,763
Yeah.
But you don't see them when they're 

1046
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:03,350
looking at your profile and the right.

1047
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,390
You should be able to see how they look 
at your profile,

1048
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,610
how many people are looking at your 
profile and any given moment,

1049
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:08,571
you know,
that's a,

1050
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:10,680
that's a nightmare in and of itself.
Yeah.

1051
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,360
We think about that.
Imagine like just people just looking at

1052
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,820
you and saying no and you're in the 
distance all the time.

1053
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,970
It has to be bad for us.
Somebody will say yes.

1054
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,833
Then the odds,
the thing things you're playing the 

1055
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:22,514
numbers maybe in that sense it's better 
because the only people that get ahold 

1056
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,170
of you,
the people that say yes,

1057
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:28,650
right,
so you missed all the notes.

1058
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:31,670
It's true.
But what I was gonna say is that haven't

1059
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,070
had a baby with someone that you don't 
really like.

1060
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,170
Yeah.
That's a possibility.

1061
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,350
If you just like to have sex with them 
and then when you're done you're like,

1062
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,333
I gotta go.

1063
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,713
Yeah,
P and you can't go because the babies 

1064
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:43,604
around.
I was coming off fuck buddies that all 

1065
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,690
everyone has,
guys and girls have fuck buddies.

1066
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,280
Yeah.
I'm almost,

1067
00:43:49,281 --> 00:43:53,570
everyone I know has had one in the past 
where you weren't in a relationship with

1068
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:54,404
them.
Really drive over and fuck and bang and 

1069
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:57,381
then,
all right,

1070
00:43:57,381 --> 00:43:58,580
bye.
Yeah,

1071
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,380
bye.
But you kiss at the end.

1072
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:01,214
That's a lot of checks these days.
I think they didn't even want to kiss 

1073
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:03,760
you.
They don't want to kiss.

1074
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,230
You only want to see you.
Sometimes you'll open the door.

1075
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,243
The girls,
they're ready to fuck and then just 

1076
00:44:08,151 --> 00:44:09,610
walks off in the other direction.
When you're done,

1077
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,610
it puts a blindfold on bird boxes.
You're done with us,

1078
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:14,540
man.
They're done.

1079
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,490
I feel like they're done.
Do you feel like that?

1080
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,353
I think it's a precarious time.
A lot of chicks are probably going 

1081
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,773
lesbos this week.

1082
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,290
Oh Dude.
I would be with trump.

1083
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,940
I think the more days that the the 
government shutdown,

1084
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:29,803
the more women are going to go lesbian.
They gonna hate men so much because of 

1085
00:44:32,831 --> 00:44:34,440
trump.
They just didn't go gay.

1086
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,660
People always say people.
Right now.

1087
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,220
That's not how I remember what I said 
earlier about jokes,

1088
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,830
but what's funny to me is gay guys are 
always like,

1089
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:46,620
I'm going to turn this guy out,
and that always sounds alarming.

1090
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,020
That does work,
but that sounds alarming.

1091
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,330
It does sound alarming,
but it does work.

1092
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,553
I have,
I don't want to say I almost said his 

1093
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:54,570
name.
Uh,

1094
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,090
he worked on,
she wasn't,

1095
00:44:57,091 --> 00:45:01,830
he was not an actor,
but he worked in the world of acting and

1096
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:05,910
he told me that he blew a lot of 
straight guys.

1097
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,430
That was just something that happened.
They'd would have a couple of drinks in,

1098
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:13,830
pretend they'd never done it before.
And next thing you know,

1099
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,120
la La.
Yeah,

1100
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:17,970
I got that delicious mouth.
That's what a lot of gay dude say.

1101
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,290
It was either him doing them or them 
doing him,

1102
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,330
but he's like,
you'd be amazed at how many,

1103
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,440
you know,
air quotes.

1104
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,320
Straight guys are out there.
My Woo.

1105
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,940
Yeah.
And he's just knows how to swing it.

1106
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,470
But will you,
do you think,

1107
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:37,460
is it less homosexual to jerk a golf 
with your left hand?

1108
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:39,090
What are you left handed or right 
handed?

1109
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:41,190
Right handed?
He jerks you off to your left hand.

1110
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,223
It's gay.
Or to do it with your right mind is 

1111
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:44,863
geared to do with my left hand.
The one that doesn't work as well 

1112
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:48,000
because it'll take longer.
You have a,

1113
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:50,190
you don't really have,
but it's understandable.

1114
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,890
I feel like it's understandable if you 
do it with your left hand because that's

1115
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,980
barely even your hand.
No,

1116
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,010
it's my hand,
Bro.

1117
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,930
You're not going to feel that much of it
though.

1118
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:01,773
She jerk him off with your right hand so
you should be effective and get it done 

1119
00:46:04,081 --> 00:46:04,914
with.
Unless you like holding on Dick's 

1120
00:46:05,731 --> 00:46:07,610
longer.
Don't come yet.

1121
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,650
No.
Hey Buddy,

1122
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,300
I'm right here.
I'm your pal.

1123
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,800
I know what's going to happen.
You're going to come then.

1124
00:46:14,801 --> 00:46:16,350
You're not going to want to hang out 
with me anymore.

1125
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:17,610
No,
no.

1126
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,250
I wouldn't do that.
Just go fast and go back.

1127
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,660
No,
I don't believe you.

1128
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,000
I think not.
I think you.

1129
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,910
I think you,
I think you said that left hand.

1130
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:28,530
Is that red?
That's the party move.

1131
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:31,800
You know because it's not,
you can still use this hand and to be on

1132
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:33,510
your phone.
You can do other stuff,

1133
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,230
but then you're not concentrating on the
jerk and the guy off.

1134
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:38,920
Like once you commit to doing something 
gay,

1135
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:39,960
just get it done,
son.

1136
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,730
Just get after it.
That's true.

1137
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:42,953
You don't want to be out there halfway 
jerky and I got off while you're 

1138
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:48,700
pretending that you're looking at your,
mentioned your email,

1139
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,900
but also what about this though?
If you are aggressively very effectively

1140
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:57,090
jerk and the guy off and then you can 
barely use your phone,

1141
00:46:57,091 --> 00:46:59,210
it looks like you're just like Ugh,
maybe uh,

1142
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,103
you know,
gay or bi gentleman that's on some dope 

1143
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:03,270
or something.
You're doing gay shit.

1144
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:04,104
Whether you're on your phone and not as 
like a sound like it acts as a condoms 

1145
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,313
prevent you would gain is struck.
You're doing gay things mean you're 

1146
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:11,214
holding onto a dick.
You just got to accept that and keep 

1147
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:13,720
moving.
There's a lot of,

1148
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,880
yeah,
you're right.

1149
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:15,714
Just take the next right action.
There's gay people doing shit that's 

1150
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:19,560
gay.
There's straight people doing shit.

1151
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:21,300
That's gay changing now.

1152
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,730
Jerk that man off.
Once you commit to that project,

1153
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:26,130
just keep going and yeah,
it's the payoff.

1154
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:27,360
What do you got out of drinking them 
off?

1155
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,440
I don't know.
I don't think I,

1156
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:31,180
let me ask you this.
Here's a question.

1157
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,200
If there was a place,
does this conversation seem gay?

1158
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:36,034
Or if life was free,
if you could really do whatever you 

1159
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:40,060
want,
if you're a grown adult,

1160
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:40,894
you can do whatever you want.
That's one of the interesting things 

1161
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:44,014
about society is that we set up these 
rules and cultures and we decide what 

1162
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:48,784
you can do and what we decide is 
different with a deciding Hollin is 

1163
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:53,510
different when they say,
yeah,

1164
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,150
everybody's got different rules.
Yeah.

1165
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,330
But once we set those rules,
it's very hard to buck those rules.

1166
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,820
It,
let's just pretend there was no rules.

1167
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:02,163
What if there was a place where guys 
would go and guys would jerk them off 

1168
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,050
and New Jersey?
Yeah.

1169
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,910
Like if there was a place where guys,
straight guys got a job Jerkin guys off,

1170
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,490
but you,
it cha you,

1171
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:21,040
you get paid $1,000 an hour.

1172
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,190
Okay.

1173
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,430
You don't think the straight guys would 
take that job straight struggling guys,

1174
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:27,350
then you would,
would,

1175
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,640
they would morph and figure out a way.
Oh,

1176
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:32,730
just over a generation or two.
Just a generation or two.

1177
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,610
If you could make $1,000 an hour beaten 
guys off.

1178
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,473
Yeah.
It started as like a best you can each 

1179
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:39,660
job.
If you could wear an oven Mitt while you

1180
00:48:39,661 --> 00:48:40,494
do it,
I wouldn't do it.

1181
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,390
Just do we.
Do we figure that out?

1182
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,950
If he could wear an oven Mitt while you 
do it?

1183
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:45,530
Oh No,
no,

1184
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:46,140
no,
no.

1185
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,310
Warm oil in your bare skin.
That's the only way to jerk guys off.

1186
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,830
You got to do,
Bro.

1187
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,990
Dude,
there's way other ways,

1188
00:48:54,991 --> 00:48:57,720
man.
You could definitely do.

1189
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,000
One way you could do is even you even 
wrap your head.

1190
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:00,834
You just do like that.
Release a sideways Kentucky Fried 

1191
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:04,770
Chicken.
There's only one batter.

1192
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,420
Crispy batter is bullshit.
Nobody likes that crispy batter.

1193
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,313
The Fuck Outta here.
I'm trying to think if I had to 

1194
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,940
[inaudible] w one thing about jerking 
off to me,

1195
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,360
I feel like there's not as much calm in 
your body is there could be.

1196
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,520
You know what I'm saying?
You don't get that much at,

1197
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,580
well,
it depends on what you're jerking off to

1198
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:25,740
and you know how focused you are on the 
task.

1199
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:27,420
If you're jerking off while you're 
looking at your phone.

1200
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,311
Yeah.
But you're,

1201
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:29,144
you know,
you're checking your twitter and your 

1202
00:49:29,611 --> 00:49:30,444
also beaten.
Yeah.

1203
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,433
You have multitask,
but you're not going to get a lot no 

1204
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:33,561
matter how much you know,
how,

1205
00:49:33,561 --> 00:49:33,941
how,
how,

1206
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:34,591
how,
how,

1207
00:49:34,591 --> 00:49:35,790
how you do it.
Really.

1208
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,230
Yeah.
How much do you get?

1209
00:49:37,231 --> 00:49:39,930
You get like a little bit,
how much do you get?

1210
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:41,893
I get like,
like if you had compare it to something 

1211
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:45,803
like a quarter?

1212
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,920
No,
probably like maybe a,

1213
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,520
like an 11th of a handful,
I guess.

1214
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,370
I don't know.
How big is your hand,

1215
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:56,611
dude?
I can't even,

1216
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:59,710
do you still masturbate as an adult?
No,

1217
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,680
I do it as a child.
I mean,

1218
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,930
we'll just say I put a diaper on and it 
makes me feel like rejuvenating myself.

1219
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,360
I feel like you'd rip your Dick off.
He tried.

1220
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,030
I feel like I hold my kids' hands.
I know how to hold things gently.

1221
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,871
Yeah,
that's true,

1222
00:50:15,871 --> 00:50:16,471
man.
I,

1223
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,120
uh,
I don't know,

1224
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:18,830
man.
I,

1225
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:21,540
I actually masturbated yesterday and I 
feel bad about it sometimes,

1226
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:23,940
but why?
How does,

1227
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:25,300
I don't know.
For some reason I feel bad.

1228
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:27,090
That's the thing.
It's a cultural thing.

1229
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,160
They got us when we're

1230
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,960
young,
like think about it this way.

1231
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,680
What if the culture was all stand up 
comedy culture?

1232
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,543
Because arguably standup comedians have 
a different culture and a different way 

1233
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:39,890
of looking at things.
Yes.

1234
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:40,783
And definitely a good,
very deep camaraderie between fellow 

1235
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:45,080
practitioners.
Right?

1236
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:45,914
Yeah.
If that was the culture was the standup 

1237
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:49,124
comedy culture was the whole world,
you wouldn't give a fuck if you beat 

1238
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:52,274
off.
Right.

1239
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,350
You wouldn't even be slightly 
embarrassed.

1240
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,050
Tell,
tell people where it's at.

1241
00:50:57,051 --> 00:50:58,970
Sure.
Ari would tell me all the time,

1242
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,820
how many times beat up towards to oh,
talk to all.

1243
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,940
We all tell each other how we beat off 
of what we beat off two.

1244
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:05,973
I'd have,
I don't like it as much as I used to 

1245
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,590
when I was young.
Well,

1246
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,340
that's my thing.
You're probably a healthier,

1247
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:11,540
yeah.
You know,

1248
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,970
it's like you got an older,
you're more comfortable,

1249
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:15,020
you're successful.

1250
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,313
Yeah.
It just feels like,

1251
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,990
yeah,
it feels like a novice move.

1252
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:18,824
It comes still jerk and office 2019 it's
certainly a distraction to do something 

1253
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:23,960
about.
Uh,

1254
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,850
especially looking at porn,
there's,

1255
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:28,580
there's,
I'm not anti porn.

1256
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,860
I don't want anybody to get me wrong.
I think she'd be able to do whatever you

1257
00:51:30,861 --> 00:51:32,270
want to do.
Ultimately.

1258
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,133
And I think a lot of why people have bad
opinions about people doing certain 

1259
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:38,804
things is that we judge people when they
do certain things and we have these 

1260
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:45,830
ideas about them that we sort of impose 
on them.

1261
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,950
Right.
But I think for some people,

1262
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,430
torn is very useful,
but you have to have discipline.

1263
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,121
Yeah.
See,

1264
00:51:53,121 --> 00:51:53,954
the thing is if you watch porn and you 
watch two people have sex and you get 

1265
00:51:57,801 --> 00:51:58,634
excited and you jerk off,
you just took care of like some sexual 

1266
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:02,780
needs that you had.

1267
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,880
Yeah.
What could possibly be wrong with that?

1268
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:05,923
The only thing that can be possibly 
wrong with it is that there's something 

1269
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,120
wrong with these two people having sex 
and filming it.

1270
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,490
Well,
is there like,

1271
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,380
but doesn't everybody want to fuck?
I'm like,

1272
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:19,430
I don't want to film myself fucking,
but doesn't everybody want to have sex?

1273
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:20,264
People love to have sex.
It's like one of the most important 

1274
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:24,800
motivations that we have.
Oh Yeah,

1275
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,753
look,
people leave the house every day cause 

1276
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:28,730
they might have a chance to fuck.
That's for sure.

1277
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,020
I mean,
why do people,

1278
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,780
why did they get involved in romantic 
relationships in the first place?

1279
00:52:32,781 --> 00:52:35,030
To not just,
not just be nice to each other,

1280
00:52:35,031 --> 00:52:36,740
but to fuck eventually.
Sometimes.

1281
00:52:36,741 --> 00:52:38,240
That's part of the whole thing.
Yeah.

1282
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,860
So what is it about two people fucking 
on film that's so distasteful?

1283
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:43,760
Well,
you know,

1284
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,380
you didn't want people to see your 
special thing maybe.

1285
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:49,870
Or like what you don't,
you know,

1286
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:53,240
you want to keep it private.
I get all those fancy though.

1287
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,130
It's high def though.
You can't,

1288
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:57,170
your brain,
you keep it real life can't compete with

1289
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:58,460
it.
So then it's so sad.

1290
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,150
It's not always the case.
I say stuff is just right there.

1291
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,820
But it's not real life though.
It's not as good.

1292
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,630
It's not as good as real life.
But I think that it's visually,

1293
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:09,464
it starts to get that it's better and it
starts to get where like sometimes like 

1294
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:15,260
I like I'm 40 days off pornography right
now.

1295
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:15,981
Right.
Oh really?

1296
00:53:15,981 --> 00:53:16,341
Yeah.
Oh,

1297
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:18,580
so you're like on a pornography detox,
Huh?

1298
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,810
I don't ever want to see it again.
Really?

1299
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,673
Yeah.
If somebody tries to get their pussy 

1300
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:22,821
out,
I'm like,

1301
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:23,970
you stop.
But let me,

1302
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,110
let me say this to you though.
You also had the same kind of issue with

1303
00:53:28,111 --> 00:53:29,640
drugs and alcohol,
right?

1304
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,890
So you have like an addictive 
personality.

1305
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:32,521
Yeah,
that's a good point.

1306
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:33,354
So having to take their personality and 
what I was saying earlier that I think 

1307
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:35,994
that the thing of it,
the thing itself is not necessarily bad 

1308
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:42,810
and for some people can actually provide
a service,

1309
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,450
right?
Like it helps them to jerk off.

1310
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,970
I don't understand why that would be 
bad.

1311
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,640
The only thing that would say is,
and this is a,

1312
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,390
I don't know how factual this is cause I
haven't done any surveys,

1313
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,433
but what I've read is that a lot of the 
people that get involved in that are 

1314
00:53:58,471 --> 00:54:00,200
victims of abuse.
Hmm.

1315
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,130
That's disturbing.
Right?

1316
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,520
You don't want to hear that.
But then some of them aren't.

1317
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:08,280
Some of them do it because they want to 
do it.

1318
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,720
Yeah.
Like it's not,

1319
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:11,760
okay.
That seems more okay.

1320
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,623
And someone who's doing it because 
they're a victim of abuse and they're 

1321
00:54:14,641 --> 00:54:17,190
desperately seeking love and attention 
and they don't know how,

1322
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,150
how to do it.

1323
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,700
That's a good point.
So then you look at it like in terms of,

1324
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:24,150
but you're just,
that's looking at that is like,

1325
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:26,400
well then don't laugh at comedy,
right?

1326
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,160
Because you laugh at comedy.
Almost everybody that's Comedians fucked

1327
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:31,230
up or been fucked over.
I mean that's,

1328
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,320
that's really why they get into it in 
the first place because they desperately

1329
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:36,210
need attention.
They want to be special,

1330
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:37,470
they want to be something.
And they're like,

1331
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:38,670
look at me,
look at me.

1332
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,880
So they figured out how to be funny.
But usually those are victims of abuse,

1333
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:43,440
like in some way,
shape or from,

1334
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:45,570
not all of them because they need the 
affection.

1335
00:54:45,571 --> 00:54:47,490
They need that they need something from 
people.

1336
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,170
Maybe six out of 10,
right?

1337
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:49,951
Yeah,
maybe.

1338
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:51,810
And now I'm being real jars.
Yeah.

1339
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:54,810
Yeah.
So there's so many things that you could

1340
00:54:54,811 --> 00:54:55,644
look at that like that w you know,
like something good comes out of stand 

1341
00:54:58,961 --> 00:54:59,310
up.

1342
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,480
Right?
So we just accept that.

1343
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:02,930
That's okay to laugh at these fucked up 
people.

1344
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,243
But you know what I mean,
like kind of like joey is that guys 

1345
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,320
lived everything.
He's seen everything,

1346
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,250
but it's okay.
It's okay to laugh at the chaos that his

1347
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:16,680
life was because the jokes are so funny.
Yeah.

1348
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:17,460
You know,
it's,

1349
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,151
it's weird,
right?

1350
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:21,480
But it's not okay to look at,
uh,

1351
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,363
like even if the girls enjoying porn,
if you find out that at some point in 

1352
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:26,124
time she was molested and that possibly 
it was one of the motivating factors 

1353
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:32,580
that led her into porn,
then you get super weird about it,

1354
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,640
then you get to think about it.
They should put that on the thing,

1355
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:38,220
like percentage chance of somebody that 
was molested in the video.

1356
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:40,920
And I think that that would deter people
from watching us.

1357
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,853
Do you think so?

1358
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:42,511
Yeah,
man.

1359
00:55:42,511 --> 00:55:46,020
My thing is just,
I started to think of sex then in frames

1360
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:46,854
like,
okay,

1361
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,320
I got to meet the girl and then we have 
to walk over by us.

1362
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:50,210
You know,
we have to,

1363
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:52,680
I have to see this and have to see that.
Then that happens.

1364
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:55,230
And then and now and that sec,
so I started to,

1365
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:56,783
you know,
like interpret it that way and I don't 

1366
00:55:59,281 --> 00:56:00,270
know,
sex is just fun.

1367
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:01,081
When you were young,
men were,

1368
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:04,240
when you were fucking imagine being 16 
and fucking somebody else.

1369
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:05,880
That was 16 bro.
You know what?

1370
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:06,714
I want to hear in the background.
We sing this song live and let die when 

1371
00:56:10,391 --> 00:56:11,380
you were,
yeah,

1372
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:18,320
they used to say
who is that?

1373
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:19,400
Diana Ross.
He's things.

1374
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,280
Paul Mccartney and wings motherfuck 
rings Bruh.

1375
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,580
That was from James Bond.

1376
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,200
Oh,
that's right,

1377
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:27,940
that's right.
Guns n roses.

1378
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,450
That was one time where the fucking 
remake is so good.

1379
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,180
That was,
you kind of put a wasn't their own song

1380
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:44,363
and dance and I hear some only we hear 
it has actually been on your podcast 

1381
00:56:48,971 --> 00:56:49,631
show.
No,

1382
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:52,060
I definitely have him on man.
Wow.

1383
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,510
I definitely have that going on.
I can't imagine.

1384
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,600
Seems to have come back from the brink.
Yeah,

1385
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,100
right.
Yeah.

1386
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,583
Who knows what kind of ego happened and 
what all happened whenever they went 

1387
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:02,494
gimme some volume so I can hear it.
At least I want to hear him say that to 

1388
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:06,740
be any,
yeah,

1389
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:07,391
we go,
here we go.

1390
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:08,224
Here we go.

1391
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:12,880
Yeah,
look out.

1392
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,110
So he was for years.
He went crazy.

1393
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,033
Yeah.
Vanished was trying to make that one 

1394
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,550
album forever.
Right.

1395
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,780
Took many,
many years.

1396
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:24,970
And everybody's like,
God damn an axl rose went crazy.

1397
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,950
I need to see him.
He like Dan was a shame.

1398
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,600
Guns and roses was so good,
so good.

1399
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,493
And then slowly but surely he fucking 
came back like really came back like 

1400
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:39,310
he's fucking back like that dude tours 
with AC DC now.

1401
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:42,970
I mean he crushes it.
I saw some videos of him on stage.

1402
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:45,040
He's a fucking animal again.
He looks like a heart.

1403
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,960
A little bit like one of the people from
heart buddy.

1404
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,720
But that's just age and time,
you know?

1405
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,800
Oh,
I don't think it's agent time.

1406
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,873
I think there's a lot of other 
ingredients could be shrunk down to 

1407
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:57,050
throw some shit onto that mix will solve
was shriven.

1408
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,320
Yeah,
but just slash looks the same.

1409
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,540
A slash looks the same,
but that's what I'm saying.

1410
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:05,380
They're both the same age.
You started out together or close to the

1411
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,460
same age at least.
Dude,

1412
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:10,930
how much fun must that paid position?
I think it's too much fun.

1413
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:12,003
This is my theory.
I think it's too much fun and I think 

1414
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:15,484
they don't even have to write new shit 
so because they don't have to write new 

1415
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:18,724
shit and it's too much fun.
They're out there just fucking smashing 

1416
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,170
every night.
Fucking smashing.

1417
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:30,670
Smashing shows,
smashing tour buses and hotel raking.

1418
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,350
Cheson just smashing each other.
Shouldn't pussy just smashing.

1419
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:36,363
They probably be crazy.
He probably didn't even notice who you 

1420
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:39,400
fuck a dude.
If you're that famous break,

1421
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,200
you notice.
I think you're wrong.

1422
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,370
I beg to differ.
Oh,

1423
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:45,050
he's got to have a teleprompter.
What about a fast dude?

1424
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:48,210
There's no actual Rosetta teleprompter 
desperate,

1425
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:49,613
but I guess you want that.
If you're on all the drugs and you want 

1426
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,160
all the junk,
not only do I want to teleprompter,

1427
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:56,560
I want it to be highlighted.
What am I supposed to say?

1428
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,340
I mean,
he's wearing hot pants.

1429
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,013
He is so close.
He's very hot pants with a high cowboy 

1430
00:59:06,491 --> 00:59:10,810
boots with socks
and a mesh top and tidy.

1431
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:11,644
Whities is,
so what is it that makes somebody so 

1432
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:17,810
famous that they get close to being 
almost like a bisexual?

1433
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,653
What you think?
Do you keep bringing up all this gay 

1434
00:59:20,111 --> 00:59:22,130
stuff you guys do?
Tell me was your Stepdad,

1435
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:23,750
right?
No Bro.

1436
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:25,490
I've never been gay man.
Never,

1437
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:26,220
ever.
No.

1438
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:26,881
Never,
ever,

1439
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:27,714
ever,
ever.

1440
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,900
I mean,
maybe when I'm 60 or 70,

1441
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:31,520
I'll bust out,
you know,

1442
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:34,550
I'll come on somebody,
but I'm not doing anything now.

1443
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:34,970
Gay.

1444
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:35,803
I want a family and everything.
I think there are so for re with their 

1445
00:59:39,531 --> 00:59:40,364
expression,
right that they wear whatever the fuck 

1446
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:44,600
they want.
And I think that's a part of the culture

1447
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,660
of really huge musicians is that they 
get very free with the looks.

1448
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:52,220
There's sexuality.
Like look at him with his,

1449
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,653
with his ripped up pants.
Axl rose backward is a cutie pie or 

1450
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,120
David Bowie.
David Bowie,

1451
00:59:59,121 --> 01:00:02,720
when he was in his androgynous state of 
Prince,

1452
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,420
uh,
I mean you can go on and on and on about

1453
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:09,890
men look fucking Mick Jagger.
Mick Jagger would swing his hips,

1454
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,580
puff his lips as well.
Elvis is no stay,

1455
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:16,770
pretty straight manly thing.
Women's clothing.

1456
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,290
Women's like,
you know,

1457
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,183
stuff from like,
he wore stuff from like scarves and 

1458
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:23,090
shit.
Is that what you're saying now?

1459
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:23,924
What's that women's clothing store 
that's in every like little sort of 

1460
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,870
secrets?
No,

1461
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:29,300
it's for like kind of more,
you know Lane Bryant.

1462
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,740
Oh,
where the big fat lady stuff.

1463
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:31,470
Well,
I mean,

1464
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:35,060
tell me about what you're saying
dude.

1465
01:00:35,061 --> 01:00:38,270
Close door for fat guys.
Big and tall.

1466
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,280
They call it,
but that's like,

1467
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:40,870
some of them are.
It's called dot.

1468
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,860
It's over there on Pico Boulevard.
He didn't hit her.

1469
01:00:42,861 --> 01:00:45,890
J Anthony always sells those suits over 
there on stage.

1470
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:50,631
What's up?
Oh,

1471
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:52,310
there he is.
Is that him now?

1472
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,530
That's him.
That could be the lady.

1473
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,560
Is it Sheryl swoopes?
He's,

1474
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,870
he's a,
that's,

1475
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,010
that's his sister.
Looks Weird like that.

1476
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,940
It's like he went to spring break,
but that's axle from younger days.

1477
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:10,370
So that's when he advantaged for awhile.
Right.

1478
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,850
Oh.
But when he did that,

1479
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:16,250
like he did a big concert in Brazil too,
right?

1480
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:17,243
Yeah.
I remember listening to that and his 

1481
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:21,340
voice was kind of struggling a little 
bit because he has such a script,

1482
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,600
such a scratchy voice,
you know,

1483
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:26,780
you've got to think like that voice is 
probably very difficult to maintain,

1484
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:32,890
but that primal fucking
dude that was this shit when I was,

1485
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:36,590
that was like right when I was 
graduating high school.

1486
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:37,424
I remember I worked out this shitty 
little gym and I'd be on the leg press 

1487
01:01:39,351 --> 01:01:40,560
machine,
listen to wow,

1488
01:01:40,561 --> 01:01:41,394
come Janette.

1489
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,910
What kind of headphones did you have?
A whatever.

1490
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:48,140
They had the big ones out.
I had a walkman with a cassette.

1491
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,970
It might've been a disc player.
Well,

1492
01:01:50,971 --> 01:01:52,820
okay.
That one's ridiculous.

1493
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,080
That one makes,
Oh,

1494
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:55,880
who is that recent?
Is that Holly Hunter?

1495
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,520
That's him now.
No,

1496
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,920
it's not holly hunter.
You son of a bitch.

1497
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:03,440
I don't even know who Holly Harris 
supposed to lead singer guns and roses.

1498
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,630
I loved guns and roses.
Did you call him?

1499
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:07,420
My brother and I used to beat each other
in our room.

1500
01:02:07,421 --> 01:02:09,620
We'd fist fight in the yard to fucking 
guns and roses.

1501
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,470
AC DC.
It was a music of my childhood was,

1502
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:17,620
was was gnr alison chains.
That's a weird look.

1503
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:19,260
The,
the,

1504
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:23,040
the thermal or the flannel shirt tied 
around the waist.

1505
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:27,030
What's that look
right,

1506
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:30,470
but that's a weird look like on purpose 
as a weird look.

1507
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,790
I said Darlene comics,
like,

1508
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,633
Hey,
I know I'm not going to wear this 

1509
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:35,760
flannel shirt,
but I'm going to tie it around my waist,

1510
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,740
but hey,
it's not really a skirt.

1511
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,113
Right?
It's just like an accoutrement to my 

1512
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:43,590
outfit of fake ripped pants.
Yeah,

1513
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,970
right.
That's a weird look.

1514
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:45,840
Isn't it?
A weird look.

1515
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:49,680
Would you think you'd rather have like a
little skirt or like be naked,

1516
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:50,514
you think skirt.
I don't want people judging me really 

1517
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,890
looking at my deck.
It's making me self conscious.

1518
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:56,903
But what if you had like a little dick 
hide or like a little thing that you 

1519
01:02:58,681 --> 01:03:01,360
could still did look at how big is your 
dick hide or

1520
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,573
you can't get new escape?
Would you ever wear a fake Dick so that 

1521
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:10,140
people thought your Dick was bigger?
If I did,

1522
01:03:10,141 --> 01:03:12,810
it would be not worrying wrapped around 
my waist.

1523
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,720
Talk to the front.
I'd have it tucked in my sock

1524
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,920
and it would be green,
like

1525
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:25,350
a dark green,
like people would know.

1526
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:26,550
It's fake though.
Kale,

1527
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:28,970
Dick.
He was like,

1528
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,470
oh,
that guy's is fake bro.

1529
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:33,740
Like,
why are you looking at my deck?

1530
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,213
Fuck away from my desk?
I think when people see me and a have 

1531
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:38,274
dicks in the future,
it just seems like everything's going 

1532
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,870
away so fast,
man.

1533
01:03:40,871 --> 01:03:42,240
Or they're trying to do that with this 
new,

1534
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:44,970
a Gillette commercial.
I've seen that Gillette commercial,

1535
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,000
I heard about it that you can shave your
buddy or something.

1536
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:48,834
Now all these years really mad because 
it's like an anti unmasculine Gillette 

1537
01:03:51,781 --> 01:03:52,614
commercial.
It makes like every man looks like a 

1538
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:57,090
massage and it's piece of shit.
It's such a disturbing commercial.

1539
01:03:57,091 --> 01:03:59,850
It's like over and over again.
Men doing douchey shit like,

1540
01:03:59,851 --> 01:04:00,684
hey bro,
aren't you selling razors and you 

1541
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:08,040
changing the world with your shitty 
fucking advertiser based philosophy.

1542
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:10,470
What are you doing?
Like what are you doing?

1543
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,230
Who fucking greenlit this?
How's that Lana?

1544
01:04:13,231 --> 01:04:13,711
But like,
Yo,

1545
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:14,550
Yo,
Yo guys,

1546
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,320
people get hair.

1547
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:20,380
They want to fucking shave it.
You're not going to fix.

1548
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:21,243
Imagine if you're a sexist rapist piece 
of shit and you see that Gillette 

1549
01:04:26,221 --> 01:04:27,150
commercial like,
damn,

1550
01:04:27,151 --> 01:04:30,120
I gotta switch my game mode.
I've been too much of a dick.

1551
01:04:30,121 --> 01:04:34,380
Like does anybody think that Gillette 
commercials or somehow or another in any

1552
01:04:34,381 --> 01:04:36,450
way,
shape or form going to affect culture is

1553
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:39,690
bad?
You're selling razors is bad,

1554
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:41,280
bro.
It's just a razor.

1555
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,770
I'd rather break my fucking face here.
Them by Gillette.

1556
01:04:43,771 --> 01:04:47,580
Again,
body wants to be lectured to wear a tie.

1557
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:49,920
Your heard of that.
So sick of that.

1558
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:51,443
You don't have your shit together.
Nobody has their shit together and you 

1559
01:04:53,131 --> 01:04:57,640
telling people how to get their shit 
together in a fucking razor blade at,

1560
01:04:57,641 --> 01:04:58,411
yeah.
Yeah.

1561
01:04:58,411 --> 01:04:59,790
Don't be racist.
We know.

1562
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,440
Don't be a sexist.
Yeah,

1563
01:05:01,441 --> 01:05:02,310
we know.
We know.

1564
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,990
Most people aren't.
Yeah.

1565
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:06,800
It's like you got it.
Like most people are the videos,

1566
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:08,070
like most people are.
It's not.

1567
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:08,904
Most people are crazy.
That's a disproportionate amount of 

1568
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:12,480
people that are,
that's what I hate about it.

1569
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:13,340
A lot of the,
this,

1570
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,990
a lot of these ideas,
the ideology today,

1571
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,410
it's like,
like they say,

1572
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:18,070
everybody where I'm

1573
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,800
from is racist.
Everybody's like,

1574
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,370
uh,
you know,

1575
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,240
some Christian Bible thumping and that's
not true.

1576
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:28,870
So many of the people I know are not 
that at all that it's unbelievable,

1577
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,320
but so many of the people in some 
[inaudible] and these other places,

1578
01:05:32,321 --> 01:05:36,610
they don't even know anybody from there.
So it's like they have no idea.

1579
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,950
But they immediately stereotyped because
of your accent too.

1580
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,380
Yeah.
You have a southern accent.

1581
01:05:41,381 --> 01:05:43,180
People assume you're not bright.
Yeah.

1582
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,550
It's so stupid,
but it's also,

1583
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:48,370
it's indicative of what the place used 
to be like,

1584
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,253
like what the world used to be like was 
like a lot of the rural edge areas were 

1585
01:05:52,271 --> 01:05:53,560
less educated.
Yeah.

1586
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,410
Now that there's the internet,
the world is a different place,

1587
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,930
man.
You can meet cool people in Wichita,

1588
01:05:58,931 --> 01:06:01,390
Kansas.
You meet cool people everywhere.

1589
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,820
Everywhere you go,
you're going to run into pockets of cool

1590
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:04,654
people.

1591
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,070
Cool people are everywhere,
man.

1592
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,610
And good people.
Good people are everywhere and they have

1593
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:13,000
different values and a lot of them are 
more community oriented,

1594
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:14,220
more friendly.
We,

1595
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,230
we on this side and those on the east 
side,

1596
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,340
everybody gets this idea that everybody 
is like the people that live all stacked

1597
01:06:21,341 --> 01:06:24,850
on top of each other fucking like bees 
swarm and in the high,

1598
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:29,800
most people don't live like that man.
Most people live somewhere where there's

1599
01:06:29,801 --> 01:06:31,480
less folks.
You got to relax.

1600
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:33,880
They can throw a Frisbee and not fucking
hit anybody.

1601
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,500
That's that.
Most people,

1602
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,570
you look at,
the vast majority of the country,

1603
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,840
there's what is there 300 and how many 
people?

1604
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,690
Billion.
Why does it three 50 already?

1605
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:48,310
What does it,
billion million bro million.

1606
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,670
You are guessing billion so I'm glad 
it's not billion.

1607
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:52,653
I think there's a,
you imagine that right then I would say 

1608
01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:54,934
three 20 if I had to guess,
I'd say three 20 but I'd say it's three 

1609
01:06:58,811 --> 01:06:59,644
25 right.
But that's like how do they know about 

1610
01:07:01,781 --> 01:07:03,540
illegals?
Oh,

1611
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,930
who knows?
Probably 2 billion.

1612
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:07,690
If they knew how many illegal aliens you
wouldn't you be pissed.

1613
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:08,920
But like how do you know how many of 
them?

1614
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:10,660
What are you doing?
You counted them.

1615
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:15,790
How were they still here?
Then what that was like,

1616
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:18,280
Yo,
dude,

1617
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,230
but you can't even raise your voice in 
it.

1618
01:07:20,231 --> 01:07:22,660
Like I have to drive to riverside.
Even fucking raise my voice.

1619
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:25,420
I feel like,
like that's how too tight it is in La.

1620
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:26,343
308 million people in the United States 
in 2010 but that's 2010 2000 it was 281 

1621
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:34,960
million.
Whoa.

1622
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:38,110
Look at that dude.
Think about,

1623
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:41,080
just think of that 20 fucking million 
people,

1624
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:44,860
28 29 27 million people and who's 
fucking the most?

1625
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:46,480
Are they saying is it whites?
Oh,

1626
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:47,314
it's all whites.
Is it really you thing fucking every 

1627
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:49,750
race now,
bro,

1628
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
it's new.
No,

1629
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:53,290
we've decided.
We decided to take back our country.

1630
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,330
Oh fuck no,
man,

1631
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,393
we're,
we're on our way to white people are on 

1632
01:07:57,581 --> 01:07:59,640
their way to being a serious minority.
Yeah.

1633
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,720
That's going to happen.
Beige power,

1634
01:08:01,721 --> 01:08:02,590
bro.
That's what I say.

1635
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,270
Everybody.
I look,

1636
01:08:04,271 --> 01:08:06,940
I love all the variety,
but you know what it's like.

1637
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:09,220
It's like we have nice things.
We can't,

1638
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,670
we can't have nice things.
We keep breaking things so we can't,

1639
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,373
because of racist people,
you can't have all this wonderful 

1640
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:17,624
diversity.
So we're eventually all going to be 

1641
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:20,354
gray.
We're going to be like those fucking 

1642
01:08:21,171 --> 01:08:22,004
aliens with the giant heads and we're 
going to have no dicks and we're all 

1643
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:25,904
going to be the exact same thing.
So no one can criticize anyone on 

1644
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,293
anything other than your thoughts and 
they're gonna be able to bring your 

1645
01:08:32,331 --> 01:08:34,220
actions and they be able to read each 
other's minds.

1646
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:35,151
Yeah,
that's what I think.

1647
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:36,620
And I think we're going to ruin the 
environment.

1648
01:08:36,621 --> 01:08:39,710
So they have builtin eyeglasses.
When you're born,

1649
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:41,870
they just fucking glue these bitches 
onto your head.

1650
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:44,600
Sort of like chicks with fake eyelashes.
You just,

1651
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,360
you just have these lenses that you put 
on when you're indoors,

1652
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:50,030
you peel the lenses off and otherwise 
you can just see nature.

1653
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:50,863
You can walk outside,
but you can't really go far and it's 

1654
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:52,814
just,
you see he could press a fern button in 

1655
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:54,920
ferns.
We'll papa.

1656
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:56,750
Why farm?
Well,

1657
01:08:56,751 --> 01:08:58,160
just you know,
foliage or something,

1658
01:08:58,161 --> 01:08:59,270
you know,
fallen a foley,

1659
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:01,460
maybe a deer runs by,
be hit that side button.

1660
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:02,383
I think nature in the future we'll 
probably be contained in these gigantic 

1661
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,460
dome,
like places like one of them,

1662
01:09:10,461 --> 01:09:11,294
Stephen King books.
And that's where you'll go to get into 

1663
01:09:13,311 --> 01:09:14,001
the nature.
Yeah,

1664
01:09:14,001 --> 01:09:17,450
like a biodome with pauly shore and uh,
Stephen Baldwin.

1665
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,220
I think that's what it's going to be 
like.

1666
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:20,054
This is going to be,
there's going to be nature places and 

1667
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:22,784
the rest of the world would be city.
The rest of the whole plant we'll be 

1668
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:28,250
sitting in our wildlife would be a 
bullshit wildlife.

1669
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,530
It'll be like a,
you know,

1670
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,590
a few thousand acres or something like 
that.

1671
01:09:33,591 --> 01:09:35,390
About a bunch of animals living 
together.

1672
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:37,510
That's all that's left.
It'd be like a cat,

1673
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:41,420
like a rabbit with like a little story,
like a story on its back or something.

1674
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,313
Because if you look at overpopulation,
and I'm not one of those doom and gloom 

1675
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:47,060
people when it comes to overpopulation.
You know why?

1676
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,030
Because I like people when people like,
you know,

1677
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:51,710
there's too many fucking people you 
don't like.

1678
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,930
I've good friends that think,
you know,

1679
01:09:53,931 --> 01:09:55,610
you want to help the world.
Don't have any kids.

1680
01:09:55,611 --> 01:09:57,110
My okay.
Yeah.

1681
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,830
I get why you'd say that,
but don't you like people?

1682
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,680
I love people.
People are awesome.

1683
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,300
It's all I know.
I mean,

1684
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,770
some of them aren't awesome,
but the vast majority are pretty cool.

1685
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,633
Yeah.
Work at least capable of being pretty 

1686
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:15,090
cool.
If you're cool to them and you establish

1687
01:10:15,091 --> 01:10:16,820
sort of a community being cool with each
other,

1688
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,540
the vast majority of people are great.

1689
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,330
People are Nice.
People are friendly.

1690
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,220
Yes,
the vast majority.

1691
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,760
So what's the problem?
The problem is was too many of us,

1692
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,710
and we're not going to stop,
right?

1693
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:31,670
They're going to plug,
oh I want to fuck somebody right now.

1694
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:33,710
You know,
we're going to make people the,

1695
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:37,580
the question is they will they say stop.
Stop.

1696
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:38,663
The study size scientists say that as 
people come more affluent and as they 

1697
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:44,624
become more educated,
they're less likely to have children or 

1698
01:10:46,731 --> 01:10:47,564
they have less children.
So they think that the best way to stop 

1699
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:53,180
overpopulation is actually equity in the
world.

1700
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:54,023
Like equality rather in the world make,
make the whole world basically like 

1701
01:10:57,981 --> 01:11:02,150
America where everybody's just got a 
chance to get ahead and everybody has an

1702
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,013
awesome education.
And everybody has access to the best 

1703
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:06,680
information.
It can't happen.

1704
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:07,693
But if that does happen,
that's what's going to curb 

1705
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,010
overpopulation.

1706
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,530
Otherwise,
the people that are the least educated,

1707
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,280
um,
uh,

1708
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:18,690
they're not going to have the same 
access to like look in,

1709
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:22,260
in countries where people are poorer.
Like for instance,

1710
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,200
they want to have more kids because they
want the kids to take care of him too.

1711
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,490
Yes,
that's a big thing,

1712
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,390
right?
That's a big thing.

1713
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:29,670
And traditional communities and you 
know,

1714
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:31,800
they're,
they're tighter and you,

1715
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:33,120
if,
here's the weird thing,

1716
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,223
if you talk to scientists,
they will tell you that arguably those 

1717
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:38,410
are happier people.
Yeah.

1718
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,690
He's happy people and they live in these
villages and stuff and they all in enjoy

1719
01:11:42,691 --> 01:11:43,524
each other's company.
Even though in our mind it's a hard 

1720
01:11:45,111 --> 01:11:46,580
scrabble life.
You know,

1721
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,360
they're living in a third world country 
in a village.

1722
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:49,194
But if they have access to food,
like say if they live in the Amazon or 

1723
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,014
something,
like they have much food you can get in 

1724
01:11:52,681 --> 01:11:53,040
there.

1725
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,030
You've got a lot of food,
man.

1726
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:57,240
Like I know how you would say,
Hey,

1727
01:11:57,241 --> 01:12:00,660
I don't want to live that way.
So these people live in the wrong way.

1728
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:01,201
They,
you know,

1729
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:03,680
they have fucking 10 kids laying on them
and shit and they're all,

1730
01:12:03,681 --> 01:12:04,514
yeah,
they're all community in this hut 

1731
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:07,440
together and you're like that.
That looks terrible.

1732
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:08,453
Hotbox and that base to a lot of times 
you see the whole family isn't there 

1733
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:14,820
like a fucking dope.
But meanwhile those people could be like

1734
01:12:14,821 --> 01:12:15,654
really happy.
They can arguably be happier than a 

1735
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:19,503
comparable group of people in Western 
civilization that you would just grab 

1736
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,710
100% and why is it black homes?
A lot of black families are still in the

1737
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:27,420
woods.
You notice that a lot of the tribes,

1738
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,180
they're kind of [inaudible] I guess 
maybe not black,

1739
01:12:30,181 --> 01:12:32,820
but it's like how Latino or dark or mid 
like a not,

1740
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,600
I don't know what had,
I guess it's like a more universal shade

1741
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:37,420
almost.

1742
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,630
Kind of like a sofa color.
Well,

1743
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,970
if you're in the jungle,
you're,

1744
01:12:41,971 --> 01:12:44,550
you're obviously in a hot climate.
If you're in a hot climate,

1745
01:12:44,551 --> 01:12:46,480
you better develop some fucking melanie.
Yeah,

1746
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:47,700
that's what it is,
is melon.

1747
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:49,260
And they got more Melanin and family.
I mean,

1748
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:52,180
if you look at it,
I'm Italian mostly if you look at it,

1749
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,033
and I have some Irish in me too,
but if you look at Italians who were in 

1750
01:12:55,441 --> 01:12:58,350
the sun all the time,
do they get dark as fuck?

1751
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,593
You know,
and if you were severed a seven plus 

1752
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:07,200
generations of people living in this one
area,

1753
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,200
we are exposed to like tropical sunlight
all the time.

1754
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:11,063
Oh,
and you had brown the fuck up or you 

1755
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:13,890
wouldn't make it.
Yeah,

1756
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:14,724
it's true.
I go to Costa Rica or even for a couple 

1757
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,190
days and I'm fucking,
you know,

1758
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:19,830
Brown down and my face is all,
you know,

1759
01:13:19,831 --> 01:13:21,690
kind of has pus in it from the sun.

1760
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:23,240
But I think people,
uh,

1761
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:24,173
evolving in a place like that,
like being there hundreds and hundreds 

1762
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,460
and hundreds of years,
maybe thousands of years.

1763
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:32,080
Like you adapt to that environment or 
you,

1764
01:13:32,081 --> 01:13:32,631
you know,
the,

1765
01:13:32,631 --> 01:13:33,464
the preferential,
the preferable genes are the ones that 

1766
01:13:36,001 --> 01:13:38,070
make it through and there's,
people have joy.

1767
01:13:38,071 --> 01:13:38,904
There's families have a lot of joy 
because they had to have their family 

1768
01:13:40,261 --> 01:13:41,430
around.
You know,

1769
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:43,980
like if somebody,
if somebody dies,

1770
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,053
they have them write day.
It's like everything's just a lot more 

1771
01:13:46,651 --> 01:13:48,750
communal.
I think there's just a lot more love.

1772
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:53,520
The only problem is they don't have like
ways to save each other the way we do.

1773
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,440
Right?
Like they don't have cars,

1774
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,490
they don't have modern weapons,
so they have to hunt with these bows and

1775
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:01,140
arrows.
They make themselves,

1776
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,420
but they do have pots,
they have some things,

1777
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:04,254
you know,
but also depending on what tribe 

1778
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:06,594
obviously,
and also your life expectancy is 

1779
01:14:08,101 --> 01:14:08,934
probably not as long.
So if you do die and you believe in a 

1780
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:12,420
higher power,
then get to go see them quicker.

1781
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,380
You probably have reincarnation,
your,

1782
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:15,453
you know,
your friend that died could now be a 

1783
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:19,990
plant or a coyote that you made or 
something.

1784
01:14:19,991 --> 01:14:22,060
You know what I'm sure in a lot of their
cultures it's a lot of,

1785
01:14:22,061 --> 01:14:23,330
uh,
you know,

1786
01:14:23,331 --> 01:14:25,420
there's just,
things are more just all intertwined,

1787
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:26,254
you know,
human in nature without was big with 

1788
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:28,840
native American cultures.
Right?

1789
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:32,140
Like they thought that a coyotes were,
I mean,

1790
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:34,300
in many different,
uh,

1791
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,200
different tribes,
the way they looked at coyotes,

1792
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,170
almost like they had some magic to them 
or something.

1793
01:14:38,171 --> 01:14:39,540
Yeah.
Or wise.

1794
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:40,630
They're up all night.
I mean,

1795
01:14:40,631 --> 01:14:41,950
I could see that.
Yeah.

1796
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:46,740
You were in that tent sleeping,
sleeping off that Hashi shy.

1797
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:52,790
So

1798
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:53,623
a coyote got trapped in a bathroom.
I want to say it was in South Carolina 

1799
01:15:00,281 --> 01:15:04,210
or North Carolina.
There were wild man in this bathroom and

1800
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:07,300
these guys have to get it out of the 
bathroom and sitting on the sink.

1801
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:08,134
It's crazy.
And they had to use one of them long 

1802
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,580
poles that the Jack Dogs,
you know,

1803
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,570
like grammar on the neck.
You see it.

1804
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,560
I knew it was one of those places in 
Nashville.

1805
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,530
Yeah,
I could see that.

1806
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:23,710
Dude.
It's a cool little video,

1807
01:15:23,711 --> 01:15:26,890
but it's weird.
Like those little fuckers are everywhere

1808
01:15:26,891 --> 01:15:28,510
now.
They are everywhere.

1809
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,820
Well,
raccoons are really dangerous.

1810
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:33,070
They're always doing,
you know,

1811
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:33,904
Jerry,
the salad,

1812
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,170
the Nashville Music Hall.
Oh,

1813
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:39,004
this beautiful southern in this hall.
A boat show or the coyote in the 

1814
01:15:42,281 --> 01:15:43,150
bathroom.
Look at him,

1815
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:45,630
make sure he's chilling.
He's,

1816
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,473
they're very photogenic.
Coyote wild life will continue pushing 

1817
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:50,053
to how weird.
So what they did was they captured it 

1818
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:54,850
and they said that if they brought it to
an animal shelter,

1819
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:56,020
they would have euthanized it.

1820
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:56,893
Hmm.
So instead they captured it and let it 

1821
01:15:58,601 --> 01:15:59,434
loose in the woods.
Which school do you have any animals 

1822
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:03,040
that you don't tell people that you 
have?

1823
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:04,030
Like any secret?
And I'm like,

1824
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:07,320
keep a lot of giraffes night.
You really though.

1825
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:12,250
They keep him under leading shit.
I can see you having something now.

1826
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,180
No.
Have you thought about it?

1827
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:17,350
I used to have paranas allegedly.
And what do they keep in a tank?

1828
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:19,090
Yeah,
you keep me in a tank.

1829
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:20,283
You know,
you used to be able to buy a human 

1830
01:16:21,581 --> 01:16:22,414
skeleton online is,
have a human skeleton at the bottom of 

1831
01:16:25,211 --> 01:16:27,420
my parada tank.
Really Weird.

1832
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:30,580
Is that you buy a skeleton and what can 
you do with it?

1833
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:33,220
I don't think you can anymore.
I bet you can't buy them anymore.

1834
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:35,140
But you used to be able to just by human
skeleton.

1835
01:16:35,141 --> 01:16:36,430
How long can you keep it the whole time?

1836
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,380
Forever.
Fuck.

1837
01:16:38,381 --> 01:16:39,600
Who Was it?
Um,

1838
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:42,100
here's the funny thing.
I got rid of it and we'll get rid of it.

1839
01:16:42,101 --> 01:16:42,491
I'm like,
man,

1840
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:43,930
I'm gonna throw away this human 
skeleton.

1841
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,100
This,
it's a question.

1842
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:45,943
It's might come with this.
You would think it'd be like a cabbage 

1843
01:16:48,401 --> 01:16:48,851
patch doll.
Look,

1844
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:50,380
it comes with a little birth 
certificate.

1845
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:51,243
We buried it,
which is even worse probably because 

1846
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,260
then people are going to be like,
what the fuck is someone?

1847
01:16:56,261 --> 01:16:57,990
Someone got killed here?
Yeah.

1848
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,620
Someone's going to find it someday.
Go,

1849
01:16:59,621 --> 01:17:01,600
what the fuck?
It's going to be a giant mystery.

1850
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,550
That sounds fun.
I always love mystery,

1851
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:06,580
man.
The thing is somebody might've died like

1852
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:07,414
they might've.
Somebody might've killed somebody and 

1853
01:17:08,651 --> 01:17:09,740
sold bones.

1854
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,300
It's probably one of those real,
how am I?

1855
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:15,380
Is that,
what does it say?

1856
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:17,150
Is that,
let me look at this.

1857
01:17:17,151 --> 01:17:22,151
Say Male from India in good condition,
12 teeth present.

1858
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,413
The rest broken missing.
There is lipping on the lumbar 

1859
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:28,670
vertebrae.
What?

1860
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:33,140
That's $5,000.
You could buy a fucking human skeleton.

1861
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:35,450
Holy Shit,
dude.

1862
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:40,451
There's several of them for sale,
so the lumbar vertebrae lipping.

1863
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:41,323
You know what that means?
I think that means that her biz back's 

1864
01:17:44,571 --> 01:17:46,970
fucked up.
Excuse me.

1865
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:49,250
And what happens is the discs 
themselves,

1866
01:17:49,251 --> 01:17:50,084
the lumbar vertebrae,
the actual vertebrate dog bone piece 

1867
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:54,643
from waring against each other,
it starts to spur and develop like a 

1868
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,830
curve to the bottom line.
I think they're calling that lipping.

1869
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:06,400
See if that's what that means.
Lipping lipping on the Lumbar Vertebra.

1870
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:08,750
Lipping living on it.
Yeah,

1871
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:11,210
yeah,
yeah.

1872
01:18:11,211 --> 01:18:12,440
I got bad.
Let's see that.

1873
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:13,580
Yup.
That's what it is.

1874
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,770
Yeah,
I see that image upper left,

1875
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,220
left right there.
Yeah.

1876
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,410
See how it curves over the top.
Oh yeah.

1877
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,110
Osteo,
Osteo fight.

1878
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:26,510
Osteophyte grading or lipping.
Yeah.

1879
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:27,523
See as your disc get smashed your bones 
trying to protect themselves and they 

1880
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:33,570
grow this extra bone tissue.
And sometimes that,

1881
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:36,230
obviously I'm not a doctor and if you 
are a doctor,

1882
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:38,090
stop yelling.
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1883
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,340
But uh,
sometimes people,

1884
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:43,310
that shit causes sly Attica.
Oh.

1885
01:18:43,311 --> 01:18:44,144
Either inflamed disks poke out and poke 
into the nerves or the bone pokes it or 

1886
01:18:47,391 --> 01:18:50,720
it causes inflammation in the area.
Eddie Bravo has that.

1887
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,643
He does.
Yeah.

1888
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:52,660
He Bravo had had his,
uh,

1889
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,720
he got his whole disc replaced with all 
five s one disc.

1890
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:56,990
Yeah.
Wow.

1891
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,900
He gained an inch in height too.
Did he really did,

1892
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:01,363
was backs all fucked up.
So like you gotta think like your discs 

1893
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,550
are these things,
right?

1894
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:05,383
These little gel things and there's 
probably a bunch of them and they bust 

1895
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,910
when they smash and get smashed down to 
nothing.

1896
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:13,250
I mean,
he was basically bone on bone.

1897
01:19:13,251 --> 01:19:14,084
He had almost no disc.
And so he was in a constant state of 

1898
01:19:16,941 --> 01:19:18,860
inflammation that still horrible.
I need a text.

1899
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,750
Like he couldn't,
he couldn't sit down.

1900
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:23,630
Sometimes he'd have to stand up and he 
would have to hold his lower back and he

1901
01:19:23,631 --> 01:19:27,680
does dealt with the pain forever,
but it was like almost nothing there.

1902
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:30,680
So they replaced,
so it's bones were on top of each other.

1903
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:31,723
They a place that and put his thing,
they shove it in their fucking two 

1904
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:35,870
story.
Ettie suddenly he's like,

1905
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:38,030
I'm buying new shirts.
He's,

1906
01:19:38,031 --> 01:19:40,400
um,
but he actually is no longer in pain.

1907
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:41,263
That's what's amazing.
And this is an articulating titanium 

1908
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:44,414
disk.
So they used to have to fuse your 

1909
01:19:46,071 --> 01:19:47,000
vertebrae together.
Yeah,

1910
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:49,700
that's what I've heard of.
They don't have to do that in every case

1911
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:50,534
anymore.
Sometimes they still do it for some 

1912
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:52,754
reasons,
you know,

1913
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:54,980
doctors that know what they're talking 
about.

1914
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:55,814
But for many people now this 
articulating titanium disk is now an 

1915
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:01,300
option.
I don't know.

1916
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:02,863
Yeah,
I know.

1917
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:05,690
All five s one surgery,
part of it taken out.

1918
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:07,410
How bad is it?
Was it hurt?

1919
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,070
It hurt bad.

1920
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,060
Yeah.
Now it's better.

1921
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:09,961
No,
it's better now.

1922
01:20:09,961 --> 01:20:12,540
But sometimes I have sciatica though.
Um,

1923
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:13,890
do you ever stretch it out?
Yeah.

1924
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,320
Do you ever use one of those teeter 
inversion tables?

1925
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:17,763
Um,
now I just got something free from you 

1926
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,320
guys though,
in the lobby.

1927
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:21,390
What's that thing called?
Pro formas or whatever.

1928
01:20:21,391 --> 01:20:21,781
Right?
Oh,

1929
01:20:21,781 --> 01:20:22,710
that's a so,
right.

1930
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:25,830
That's so awesome.
So awesome massager.

1931
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,050
Isn't that great?
So,

1932
01:20:27,051 --> 01:20:29,390
uh,
that's this muscle here.

1933
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,560
I'm going to come on that thing and 
thing feels fucking good,

1934
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:32,640
bro.
Sorry Bro.

1935
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,450
And thinking feels good.
You are so horny today.

1936
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:39,150
Either I had to dry.
It's like 20 minute drive up right here.

1937
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:41,700
Get hyman,
nothing like driving,

1938
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,620
you know,
I'll say this,

1939
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:47,790
things that get me a rec these days,
driving being on planes,

1940
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:51,660
you know that uh,
bumpy roads

1941
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:57,750
killing those bumpy roads owners.
There's a real,

1942
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,760
you asked me one time ever they had a 
lady,

1943
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:01,590
uh,
I felt like I got an erection on a plane

1944
01:21:01,591 --> 01:21:03,450
and she got pissed.
She told the,

1945
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:06,210
she told the flight attendant to get me 
a blanket.

1946
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,940
Well did you have it out?
No,

1947
01:21:08,941 --> 01:21:09,774
I was asleep and it was in my pants.
It was in your pants and she saw it 

1948
01:21:12,871 --> 01:21:13,704
somehow.
Yeah,

1949
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,020
she saw my pants cause I wear lean 
pants.

1950
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,730
Lean pants are,
you know,

1951
01:21:17,731 --> 01:21:20,370
I wasn't wearing like a,
like a fat suit canvas or anything,

1952
01:21:20,371 --> 01:21:21,770
you know,
textiles,

1953
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:23,503
shower.

1954
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:30,990
That's crazy that she's looking over it 
crazy though.

1955
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:34,470
But I guess if I was a woman and a dude 
had a rock hard boner,

1956
01:21:34,471 --> 01:21:35,820
just like a couple of fee,
I would know.

1957
01:21:35,821 --> 01:21:37,640
That's like a ticking time bomb.
Like,

1958
01:21:37,641 --> 01:21:38,960
Hey,
all right,

1959
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,800
but I'm on a plane.
I'm going home.

1960
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:41,970
Yeah,
but what if you're a pervert?

1961
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,770
Yeah,
I am a pervert,

1962
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:46,650
but I'm still just going home and not 
using my Dick went on him.

1963
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:47,484
What kind of scale of a pervert are you 
if like 10 is jerking off in front of 

1964
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:52,284
people on the subway with a true,
not that I have a friend that's a 

1965
01:21:55,531 --> 01:21:57,350
flasher though.
Well,

1966
01:21:57,351 --> 01:21:59,790
you this flashes and those flashes at 
jerk off on Pete.

1967
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:00,624
He doesn't do that.
That's,

1968
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:01,493
that's 10 and then nine is a flasher 
that just pretends to jerk off in front 

1969
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:09,360
of you.
It doesn't finish or can't get hard,

1970
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,120
and then you've got to go back from 
there.

1971
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,620
A softball five.
What do you look at?

1972
01:22:13,621 --> 01:22:14,700
Three?
No,

1973
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:19,350
I think,
I mean I guess perverted tendencies like

1974
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,270
would,
I guess it's like what is perverted?

1975
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,111
Yeah,
well,

1976
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:22,944
it goes back to the porn talk.
Like you said that you had a problem 

1977
01:22:25,201 --> 01:22:26,790
with porn,
you were watching too much porn.

1978
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:28,860
It became a habit for me.
That's what I didn't like.

1979
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:29,694
It became a,
instead of me wanting to watch 

1980
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:32,940
pornography became,
oh,

1981
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:34,890
I'm used to watching pornography at 
night,

1982
01:22:34,891 --> 01:22:37,710
so I'm going to do it right,
jerk off and get a little bit of rest.

1983
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:40,170
I didn't like the habit,
but it created a bad habit.

1984
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:40,921
Well,
you,

1985
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:43,470
uh,
you get real,

1986
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:45,870
uh,
intense thinking about things.

1987
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:46,763
Yeah.
Like even when we're talking about like 

1988
01:22:47,821 --> 01:22:49,740
business stuff,
like you can tell like you get,

1989
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:52,500
you focus on things,
which is good.

1990
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:54,320
If it's good thing,
you know.

1991
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,330
But sometimes that kind of thinking can 
get away from you.

1992
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:59,090
Yeah.
I think it does sometimes for now,

1993
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:00,053
the same kind of focus that can get you 
really excited about something that's 

1994
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:06,190
productive in your life can also get you

1995
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,380
obsessed with something that's not 
productive.

1996
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:09,743
It's the sec,
the kind of person that you are and a 

1997
01:23:11,651 --> 01:23:14,470
lot of performers,
you're an impulsive,

1998
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:16,270
creative person,
impulsive,

1999
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:18,520
creative.
People sometimes get caught in ruts,

2000
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:21,070
you know?
And there's a bunch of different reasons

2001
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:23,620
I think for,
for addictions.

2002
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:26,500
I think there psychological addictions,
it's physical addictions.

2003
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:28,720
Some of them are undeniable,
like physical addictions.

2004
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:32,200
Some of them will kill you.
Like you get off of alcohol too quick,

2005
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:33,220
you'll die.
Yeah.

2006
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,000
It's a physical addiction that is real.
And to your point,

2007
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:38,380
you can't pretend it's not real.
That shit will kill you.

2008
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,790
Right.
So it's obviously real,

2009
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:42,370
but then there's other ones like washing
your hands too many times,

2010
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,230
like some people are addicted to washing
their hands.

2011
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,320
I know,
Dude.

2012
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,170
It doesn't go anywhere without purell 
everywhere.

2013
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:48,910
Wash his hands.
He's putting pray.

2014
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:49,893
It's crazy.
She's hands is linked to touch door 

2015
01:23:50,741 --> 01:23:51,560
knobs,
put touches,

2016
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,380
doorknob,
purell back to the hands.

2017
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:54,820
It's weird.
And you,

2018
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:58,180
you fuck up your skin flora like it's 
not good.

2019
01:23:58,420 --> 01:23:59,253
Yeah.
We had a dude that used to lick both of 

2020
01:24:00,281 --> 01:24:01,980
his shoulders for,
he'd start talking to me.

2021
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:02,900
Oh,
that's good.

2022
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:03,733
That's good.
That's a let motherfuckers know your 

2023
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:06,700
serious.
Oh yeah.

2024
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:09,310
That's an Irish.
Hello.

2025
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:11,200
Right.
Well whoa.

2026
01:24:11,201 --> 01:24:13,450
Wait,
where were in crazy town.

2027
01:24:13,451 --> 01:24:15,940
You're the mayor.
Lucky doing you lick your shoulders.

2028
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,240
We had to do it in our town.
He put like a chocolate on your shoulder

2029
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:21,020
and you try to get it off the heat it 
off.

2030
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,140
That's not right.
That guy's going to grab you one day and

2031
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:24,070
fuck you.
Well,

2032
01:24:24,071 --> 01:24:26,050
he did get in trouble for something.
I don't remember what it was.

2033
01:24:26,051 --> 01:24:27,240
I had grown up,
but he's,

2034
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,800
he's like one of those angler fish.
He's tricking you.

2035
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:31,570
Yeah.
He's getting you to look at that,

2036
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:32,404
huh?
It's going to get you had come looking 

2037
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:36,520
for that chocolate.
You did it off my shoulder,

2038
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,193
my shoulder.
Boom.

2039
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:40,110
He looked down.
He's got a bat in his hands.

2040
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:43,420
Well,
if you said it's like you on that play,

2041
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,530
get your chocolate.
Come get you shot.

2042
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:51,010
Just chuck this.
But here's the thing.

2043
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:55,630
Here's the thing is if you put it pops 
with Stevie wonder movie,

2044
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:57,500
just did it.
Just kind of get my neck better.

2045
01:24:58,210 --> 01:24:59,043
I'm trying to get my neck longer,
but I'm wearing a little bit of a neck 

2046
01:25:00,281 --> 01:25:02,260
brace sometimes at night.
Stretching it out.

2047
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:04,660
It's just tight.
My neck feels kinda are not tight.

2048
01:25:04,661 --> 01:25:05,800
It feels short.
Yeah.

2049
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,053
Have you used those things?
The harness that goes on under the Chin 

2050
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:11,770
and you attach it to the top of the door
and you pull on it.

2051
01:25:11,771 --> 01:25:12,121
Click,
click,

2052
01:25:12,121 --> 01:25:12,511
click,
click,

2053
01:25:12,511 --> 01:25:13,360
click.
I've seen those.

2054
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:14,830
Those are great.
Oh yeah,

2055
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,450
yeah.
If you have a tense neck.

2056
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:19,870
I'm a big believer in that kind of 
spinal decompression.

2057
01:25:19,871 --> 01:25:21,150
Yes.
There's a lot that,

2058
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:22,270
yeah,
you can get that.

2059
01:25:22,271 --> 01:25:23,104
And I got a really good one out here to 
two really good ones from that teeter 

2060
01:25:26,381 --> 01:25:27,214
company where you put your waste on one 
of them and you lean forward and it 

2061
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:31,780
stretches your lower back.

2062
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:33,310
And the other one you hang from your 
ankles.

2063
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:36,250
It's really good for it.
It feels good to it alleviate cause it's

2064
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:38,500
just like that compression of life.
Sick of it.

2065
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:40,240
Yeah.
Smushing you down.

2066
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:41,253
And it's very rare that you'd do 
anything that like I have a terrible 

2067
01:25:43,421 --> 01:25:44,440
problem.
Slumping.

2068
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:46,510
I've always slumped.
I've always been,

2069
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:50,530
I've always had shit posture for 
whatever reason and it's not good.

2070
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:53,000
Like you're supposed to sit up straight.
Yeah.

2071
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,033
You know you're supposed to your back.
It's supposed to be straight so he can 

2072
01:25:56,051 --> 01:25:57,580
be like a,
sometimes I like,

2073
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,760
I sit like this so I'll talk to people 
and I'd be like that.

2074
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:04,490
Like my head is forward.
It's like just very bad for your back.

2075
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:05,523
Like you're making your,
your disks carry your weight in an 

2076
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:10,310
uneven way.
What you want to do is have everything,

2077
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:13,310
everything up and strong.
Obviously this is exaggerated,

2078
01:26:13,311 --> 01:26:16,530
but most people like you get lazy.
So what,

2079
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:18,410
what,
what good posture is,

2080
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:23,000
is like a constant state of exercise.
That's what good posture is.

2081
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:25,850
Cause you want to just slump.
I slump all the time man.

2082
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,440
But yeah,
but doing posture all the time,

2083
01:26:27,441 --> 01:26:30,440
it feels like you're always like,
you know about to graduate.

2084
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,890
I feel like you always have to be like 
kind of like,

2085
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:35,840
you know what I'm saying?
That that's why it's what it's like,

2086
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:38,570
but you don't have to be exaggerated,
but you really should.

2087
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:42,230
And I've been trying over the last few 
years really hard to do that.

2088
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:45,980
Just to see straight.
I need to get an alarm for my spine.

2089
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:47,510
That's it.
That's the Shit I love.

2090
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:50,690
That's called the,
the teeter decks inversion.

2091
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:51,853
That's uh,
one of my favorite things ever for a 

2092
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:57,830
loosening up your lower back.
Really decompressing and yeah,

2093
01:26:57,831 --> 01:26:58,670
I've got one right here,
man.

2094
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,620
And it's not prohibitively expensive 
either.

2095
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,570
I'll hop on that before I leave.
Yeah,

2096
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:05,900
that thing right there,
that thing when you go down,

2097
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:06,763
when,
when it a press play so you can see how 

2098
01:27:09,051 --> 01:27:09,884
it works.
You hang down like that and when you 

2099
01:27:11,781 --> 01:27:12,614
hang down like that,
it just lengthens everything and 

2100
01:27:14,721 --> 01:27:15,554
straightens it out.
And that's the one where you hang by 

2101
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:17,960
your ankles.
I love that too.

2102
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:19,940
Although it's cad,
it looks good.

2103
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:23,140
Right?
I cannot even imagine they have that.

2104
01:27:23,141 --> 01:27:24,440
Oh good for you.
I've got one right here,

2105
01:27:24,441 --> 01:27:27,410
but really it felt like something you 
would do to kill a deer or something.

2106
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,130
No,
that's,

2107
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:29,570
that's a different kind of thing,
man.

2108
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,430
That's wild man.
I need some stuff.

2109
01:27:31,431 --> 01:27:34,190
I don't think I need to get more,
you know,

2110
01:27:34,191 --> 01:27:35,024
bars and stuff like that to hang off of.
I've got to alleviate some pressure for 

2111
01:27:37,311 --> 01:27:38,990
your shoulders.
Like Chin up bars,

2112
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:41,150
grab a hold of a chin up bar and just 
hang.

2113
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:42,243
Hanging is really good for your 
shoulders because everything gets 

2114
01:27:44,151 --> 01:27:44,984
compacted,
everything gets like bunched in and 

2115
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:51,170
nothing's stretches out.
They'll look a conestoga wagon brother,

2116
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:52,530
you know,
that can still go out again.

2117
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,620
Conestoga.
What does it Conestoga wagon?

2118
01:27:54,621 --> 01:27:57,710
It's like a wheel base is really 
questionable.

2119
01:27:57,711 --> 01:27:59,810
It's like six by six,
you know?

2120
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:03,470
Like I'm not that far.
You don't move that good.

2121
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,570
I mean,
I think I used to be able to,

2122
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:07,670
but I got to go on to the past,
Bro.

2123
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:10,520
You're still young enough to move like 
that right now.

2124
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:11,670
Yeah.
I need to think.

2125
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:12,573
Oh,
that's a conestoga wagon cheese like 

2126
01:28:13,761 --> 01:28:14,594
that.
Imagine if you just decided that's how 

2127
01:28:15,861 --> 01:28:17,600
you're going to rocket from now on.
You're on the highway.

2128
01:28:17,601 --> 01:28:19,850
People are beeping at you.
Get Your Mobile,

2129
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:22,340
Ronnie.
He had a wooden wheel,

2130
01:28:22,341 --> 01:28:26,000
the wagon dragging behind your ram 
pickup truck.

2131
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:30,680
A fucking a bar goal just falls out the 
bag.

2132
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:35,870
You got a Silverado Chevy Silverado 
pulling a fucking covered wagon.

2133
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,450
They'd be like,
you can't do that.

2134
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,160
Why not?
Cars registered?

2135
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:42,230
This is all legal.
Ooh,

2136
01:28:42,231 --> 01:28:45,140
fuck is buying wagons these days.
People will find them today.

2137
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:46,860
Oh,
the wagons coming back is this,

2138
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:49,670
these fucking assholes that want to 
reenact the civil war.

2139
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:54,680
Want to get out there and a wagon and 
pretend there's still slavery.

2140
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:55,940
Well,
here's the thing though.

2141
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:58,940
I understand.
Reenacted it in the winter,

2142
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:01,010
but they do it in the summer,
man.

2143
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,170
Do they really?
Yeah.

2144
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,270
You don't want to do in the winter,
you'll die in the south.

2145
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:06,550
Always wins the reenactment too,
which is wild.

2146
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:08,440
No,
it doesn't really.

2147
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:11,350
Yeah,
and so real.

2148
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:13,570
I think there's a little bit of,
you know what they should do?

2149
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:16,000
They should reenact the civil war and 
killed themselves.

2150
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,850
Not In real life,
but in the,

2151
01:29:18,851 --> 01:29:21,250
in the fake.
You mean pretend hey man,

2152
01:29:21,251 --> 01:29:23,980
I don't want to fight for slavery and 
just all pretend to kill themselves.

2153
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:25,090
Yeah.
Oh,

2154
01:29:25,091 --> 01:29:26,050
that's interesting.
Yeah.

2155
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:27,190
They would say,
hey,

2156
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,930
we're going to,
we're going to do it the right way,

2157
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:29,793
or we're going to toss down our guns and
suck all the Dicks of the guys in the 

2158
01:29:32,051 --> 01:29:36,550
north that they would one that did have 
one.

2159
01:29:36,551 --> 01:29:40,180
If they have said that
they don't want,

2160
01:29:40,181 --> 01:29:41,650
if that,
it'd be like a,

2161
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:46,680
if they catch us [inaudible] be like,
here's what you want you to feel good.

2162
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:47,674
And then one,
apologize because they need the 

2163
01:29:48,521 --> 01:29:49,354
nutrients.

2164
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,520
They're out there starving.
But I was thinking about this.

2165
01:29:51,521 --> 01:29:54,900
Do you think that so slave rewrite,
right?

2166
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,830
They had it.
Do you think that would,

2167
01:29:57,831 --> 01:30:00,500
if I had this thought of one day,
what if computers,

2168
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:02,510
artificial intelligence happens.
Okay.

2169
01:30:02,511 --> 01:30:06,260
Takes over and then they're all going to
know that we had,

2170
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:11,280
we own these phones.
Yeah.

2171
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:14,900
Just like people like they were saying 
like this was a slave,

2172
01:30:14,901 --> 01:30:17,450
like remember when you owned my little 
buddy.

2173
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:21,350
You're emotional about that.
I see where you're going with that.

2174
01:30:21,351 --> 01:30:22,184
But I disagree.
I don't think that'll be an actual 

2175
01:30:24,231 --> 01:30:26,220
factor.
I don't know.

2176
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:27,950
I got the rose gold one now.
I do none of that.

2177
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,230
But you've got a black case on it.
That's ridiculous.

2178
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:30,980
Yeah,
that's true.

2179
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:31,813
If you go in rose gold,
I think you have to go case list like a 

2180
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:35,760
brown,
like a sap.

2181
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,250
I'm not going caseless man,
look,

2182
01:30:38,251 --> 01:30:42,020
get Jamie caseless.
Jamie's a case was barbarian.

2183
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:43,093
Wow.
I bet he jerks off of this fucking his 

2184
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:47,960
natural hand.
I got a cute case.

2185
01:30:47,961 --> 01:30:49,280
My,
my kid drew on it.

2186
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:50,301
Oh,
that's nice.

2187
01:30:50,301 --> 01:30:51,150
Huh?
Adorable.

2188
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:53,480
Um,
do you see your kids every day?

2189
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,060
Yeah,
sometimes I keep my eyes closed.

2190
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,650
This is,
that seems fun.

2191
01:31:02,651 --> 01:31:03,560
And having kids style,
oh,

2192
01:31:03,561 --> 01:31:06,610
podcasts is it nurse did.
Were you nervous at first to have him?

2193
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:08,070
Yes.
Yeah.

2194
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,033
Nervous to be vulnerable.
Nervous to love something that much 

2195
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:13,510
nervous to have that kind of 
responsibility.

2196
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:17,360
Nervous about all those things.
Yeah.

2197
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:20,860
Changes you change as you like nothing 
else.

2198
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:23,590
But did you feel like the changes would 
be for like a,

2199
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:26,620
that you won't like the changes and then
you did like,

2200
01:31:26,621 --> 01:31:27,910
I'm like,
did you have reservations?

2201
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:28,773
Well,
I didn't have a relationship with my 

2202
01:31:31,661 --> 01:31:34,990
father growing up,
so for me it's very,

2203
01:31:34,991 --> 01:31:37,750
it was very,
very important that I did whatever I had

2204
01:31:37,751 --> 01:31:42,751
to do to have a relationship with them,
to be as present as I can be till I took

2205
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:47,110
whatever,
whoever I was beforehand them to,

2206
01:31:47,111 --> 01:31:50,190
to evolve to get better.
Like it's,

2207
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,060
it's,
it's a very,

2208
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:53,463
when you have kids,
it's a very weird thing what happens to 

2209
01:31:55,571 --> 01:32:00,460
you because you all the sudden it's,
you're not alone anymore.

2210
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:01,930
Like you,
like you,

2211
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:04,240
you don't just have responsibility.
Like you have a dog,

2212
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:05,074
you have to feed or a plant.
You have a little person and you don't 

2213
01:32:08,651 --> 01:32:09,484
want to fuck up that little person.
You're like shit and it feels 

2214
01:32:12,251 --> 01:32:14,680
overwhelming and then the world feels so
dangerous.

2215
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:17,140
Change the view of the world.
God,

2216
01:32:17,141 --> 01:32:17,974
there's so much threat.
There's so much out there that could 

2217
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:21,610
stop signs,
planes,

2218
01:32:21,611 --> 01:32:26,110
stories to you read stories about 
terrible people and terrible things that

2219
01:32:26,111 --> 01:32:27,250
happen.
Oh,

2220
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:28,084
and then you're like,
fuck,

2221
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,073
I don't have to worry about,
this just happened to me afterward when 

2222
01:32:29,971 --> 01:32:32,150
this happened to know somebody else to 
then your little,

2223
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,570
your little daughter,
you know?

2224
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:36,310
Yeah.
That's wild bro.

2225
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:37,203
That's crazy world and you,
you think of people differently because 

2226
01:32:40,991 --> 01:32:41,824
you think of people as a project that 
developed instead of being in a static 

2227
01:32:44,981 --> 01:32:46,810
state.
That's interesting.

2228
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:47,913
Did you,
did,

2229
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:48,753
did,
do you think that something like a 

2230
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:54,040
emotionally happens to you like at a 
level that the DNA level?

2231
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:55,690
Yeah,
the love you have.

2232
01:32:55,691 --> 01:32:56,524
Like Dave Chappelle said,
this best goes not only to do increase 

2233
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,553
my love,
it increased my capacity for love and 

2234
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:03,970
that's a great way of putting it.
I would,

2235
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:07,150
I would agree 100%.
It increases your capacity.

2236
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,160
You become an eye,
at least me,

2237
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:12,640
I became a nicer person,
but I've seen it not work too.

2238
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:13,773
I've seen people that just reject it.
I've seen men and women that just don't 

2239
01:33:16,181 --> 01:33:17,014
want to be parents.
I've seen women move away from their 

2240
01:33:18,851 --> 01:33:19,684
kids.
They don't want to take care of their 

2241
01:33:20,201 --> 01:33:23,020
kids.
I've seen men abandoned their families.

2242
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:25,270
They just don't want to do it.
It's crazy.

2243
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:31,350
I don't know if it's a mental health 
issue or if it's just,

2244
01:33:31,391 --> 01:33:33,820
some people just can't take it.

2245
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:35,023
He never like,
there's like attitudes and this is not 

2246
01:33:38,111 --> 01:33:42,490
just about raising children's about 
pretty much anything difficult in life.

2247
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:46,750
There's some people that have a very low
quit point,

2248
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:49,870
very low.
They just quit everything.

2249
01:33:49,871 --> 01:33:51,040
They quit.
It gets tough,

2250
01:33:51,041 --> 01:33:51,874
quit,
quit.

2251
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:54,790
There's a lot of people that just quit.
And uh,

2252
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,910
when you have a little like say if you 
have a little theo in front of you,

2253
01:33:57,911 --> 01:33:58,744
when you think about your life and your 
childhood and like how important it is 

2254
01:34:01,301 --> 01:34:02,134
for you to,
to raise this little person and give 

2255
01:34:05,981 --> 01:34:09,880
them love and teach them about life and 
protect him and keep him safe.

2256
01:34:09,881 --> 01:34:11,540
And give them good lessons in life.
Yeah.

2257
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:14,200
It just changes.
Everything,

2258
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:17,560
changes,
everything changes everything.

2259
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:20,530
But it also has to brave.
Overwhelming.

2260
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,393
It's overwhelming.
People get serious anxiety when they 

2261
01:34:23,681 --> 01:34:24,514
have kids.
They start thinking about the 

2262
01:34:25,391 --> 01:34:28,750
responsibility and the weight of it all 
or they don't.

2263
01:34:28,751 --> 01:34:29,584
Some people just fucking take pills and 
lay on the couch and let their kids 

2264
01:34:31,691 --> 01:34:32,524
suck.
Fucking carpet glass and the fucking 

2265
01:34:35,141 --> 01:34:39,890
stick forks into the wall sockets and 
play with knives.

2266
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:41,980
People just don't.
Some people don't give a fuck,

2267
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:44,350
but some people are dumb.
That's a,

2268
01:34:44,351 --> 01:34:45,460
that's a thing too,
man.

2269
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:46,031
I,
you know,

2270
01:34:46,031 --> 01:34:46,864
people don't want to say this,
but there's folks out there that just 

2271
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:53,740
aren't equipped for life.
I really believe that.

2272
01:34:53,741 --> 01:34:56,290
I think dee come the dumb brother.
That's what I'm saying.

2273
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:57,320
Take the semen of him.

2274
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,660
You know what I'm saying?
Like at a certain point,

2275
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:01,900
but here's the problem.
You're dumb compared to physicists.

2276
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:05,930
So who's the WHO's to judge and who's to
say that this person is really stupid?

2277
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:08,360
Couldn't have a brilliant child that 
happens to men.

2278
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:11,200
A lot of times,
brilliant people come out of stay,

2279
01:35:11,201 --> 01:35:13,910
need adversity.
Man Who knows what they need,

2280
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:14,744
but it's like,
it's not our job to decide who's stupid 

2281
01:35:18,501 --> 01:35:21,490
and who's not because it gets slippery.
Yeah.

2282
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,393
You,
you could get boxed into that stupid 

2283
01:35:24,561 --> 01:35:27,500
corner in a different metric.
If you're hanging around with a bunch of

2284
01:35:27,501 --> 01:35:30,030
people from Stanford and they're looking
steel,

2285
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:30,831
vons,
the neighborhood,

2286
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:32,270
and they know there's 10 people in the 
neighborhood,

2287
01:35:32,271 --> 01:35:33,104
but only nine can survive.
It's only resources for nine paying to 

2288
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:36,380
get rid of me.
Probably.

2289
01:35:36,930 --> 01:35:38,630
It depends on how good you are digging 
ditches

2290
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,140
all it could be better than him at that 
though.

2291
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,090
Yeah.
So suddenly I have a different scale.

2292
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:46,010
I Dunno.
It's a,

2293
01:35:46,011 --> 01:35:47,660
have you thought about having kids?
Yeah,

2294
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:48,523
I think about it a lot more.
Like as I get a little bit older and I 

2295
01:35:49,821 --> 01:35:50,660
just,
yeah.

2296
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:52,640
The thing for me is just like about 
being brave,

2297
01:35:52,641 --> 01:35:53,474
I think,
and just being willing to have my life 

2298
01:35:54,501 --> 01:35:58,220
just be totally different and be okay 
with that and just being like willing to

2299
01:35:58,221 --> 01:36:00,380
know that I will be okay in that space,
you know?

2300
01:36:00,850 --> 01:36:01,870
Um,
I think it's our,

2301
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:02,661
uh,
it's like,

2302
01:36:02,661 --> 01:36:03,494
I just,
it's like I'm just starting to manage 

2303
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,134
this space that I'm in like as just as a
regular person and then to get to that 

2304
01:36:09,021 --> 01:36:10,760
point where now it's like,
fuck,

2305
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:13,250
you have another ball,
you have two balls in the air,

2306
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,690
you know,
wife and a kid or,

2307
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:16,213
yeah.
And then what we were talking about 

2308
01:36:17,031 --> 01:36:17,864
earlier,
like sometimes people fuck people that 

2309
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:21,440
they don't really like to hang out with.

2310
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:22,820
Yeah.
I'm not doing that anymore,

2311
01:36:22,821 --> 01:36:23,654
man.
That's where it gets slippery because 

2312
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:28,010
sometimes that sex is fun,
man.

2313
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:31,100
I was just talking to a buddy of mine 
about this.

2314
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:32,690
He's got a,
a Gal,

2315
01:36:32,691 --> 01:36:34,980
he's a single guy and he's got a gallery
Fox.

2316
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:38,690
Every now and again they get together 
and they both kind of know what it is.

2317
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,553
Yeah.
They get it together and they whack one 

2318
01:36:40,911 --> 01:36:43,250
out and then they see ya.
That's it.

2319
01:36:43,370 --> 01:36:45,020
And his,
his take on it is interesting.

2320
01:36:45,021 --> 01:36:45,591
He's like,
yeah.

2321
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:48,470
And some people you just don't want to 
see him that often.

2322
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:50,210
Like that's okay.
That's okay.

2323
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:52,700
But the problem is it's not always 
mutual.

2324
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:54,063
Sometimes the guy wants to see the girl 
more than she wants to see him or vice 

2325
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:59,180
verse and then it become some weird 
thing.

2326
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:02,060
One person starts talking the other 
person's facebook.

2327
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:04,490
You know,
people start getting weird with people,

2328
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,353
you know,
like that's,

2329
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,040
that's actually an addiction too.

2330
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:07,903
People get addicted to each other just 
as much as they get addicted to 

2331
01:37:09,951 --> 01:37:10,784
pornography.
Just as much as they get addicted to 

2332
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:13,513
wash their hands or anything else.
People absolutely get addicted to 

2333
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:16,874
certain people.
And when that person doesn't want to 

2334
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:18,993
have sex with you anymore,
like it's like they're taking away your 

2335
01:37:20,571 --> 01:37:21,890
drugs,
you know,

2336
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,610
and really dumb men and in those cases 
get very dangerous.

2337
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:26,990
Cause Daca is.
Yeah,

2338
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,873
they,
they start thinking this person's done 

2339
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:31,670
something to them because they don't 
want to be with them anymore.

2340
01:37:31,671 --> 01:37:33,950
And really dumb men are dangerous right 
there.

2341
01:37:34,110 --> 01:37:35,420
That's where you know,
you,

2342
01:37:35,421 --> 01:37:36,254
you,
you hear about women getting stalked by 

2343
01:37:37,431 --> 01:37:39,990
their axes and murdered and that's where
that should come straight.

2344
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:40,873
That really dumb men who are angry now 
that the person that they loved doesn't 

2345
01:37:44,421 --> 01:37:46,550
want to be around them anymore.
Yeah.

2346
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:47,443
And they can't look at themselves and 
they're probably mentally ill and they 

2347
01:37:49,251 --> 01:37:50,210
might be on medication.

2348
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:55,210
Who the fuck knows what trifecta or what
conglomeration of factors is making them

2349
01:37:55,891 --> 01:37:57,930
be that piece of shit,
but yeah,

2350
01:37:57,931 --> 01:37:58,621
they just feel,
yeah,

2351
01:37:58,621 --> 01:37:59,454
I want you to,
yeah.

2352
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:00,713
He may get a feeling they get,
they feel rejected and then you just 

2353
01:38:02,971 --> 01:38:04,110
want to,
yeah,

2354
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:04,944
you don't know what to do.
Sometimes you get addicted to somebody 

2355
01:38:06,481 --> 01:38:09,930
else's love or lust or saks,
all those things.

2356
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,400
Women to men.
It's dangerous.

2357
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:13,273
It too.
I was talking to a gal who was going 

2358
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:18,600
through this with another Gal,
a couple of lesbians,

2359
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:20,610
couple of lesbian scene.
I'm talking about,

2360
01:38:20,611 --> 01:38:21,444
boy,
the Lez one lesbian was mean to the 

2361
01:38:22,651 --> 01:38:25,200
other lesbian.
Apparently I was referring at furniture,

2362
01:38:25,201 --> 01:38:26,490
you know what I'm saying?
Boy,

2363
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:27,353
domestic abuse.
There was some article about domestic 

2364
01:38:30,481 --> 01:38:32,740
abuse.
It's growing and lesbian community.

2365
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:34,980
Yeah.
It's disturbing.

2366
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:36,780
It's a dark arts man and those women 
are,

2367
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:39,150
and some of those women are tough.

2368
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:42,660
You think tough as nails.
What'd you find?

2369
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:44,670
A lesbian for?
An undisclosed amount of money.

2370
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:47,310
Yeah.
Really?

2371
01:38:47,311 --> 01:38:48,780
You don't even have to hear that.
The number.

2372
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,333
What is undisclosed?
Do I get to hear it or I don't know 

2373
01:38:54,271 --> 01:38:57,240
until it's over.
You're just ready to fight women?

2374
01:38:58,170 --> 01:38:58,801
No,
I'm not.

2375
01:38:58,801 --> 01:39:02,100
Can I train for hearst?
I wouldn't like Amanda Nunez.

2376
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:03,790
I wouldn't let you find out.
No.

2377
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:04,860
Yeah,
it has to be a woman.

2378
01:39:04,861 --> 01:39:06,210
At least.
I've seen a couple pictures of them.

2379
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,560
You know,
like I,

2380
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:10,110
they don't want to be able to make sure.
Yeah,

2381
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:10,973
I've seen like a couple of images of 
them or at least being able to scroll 

2382
01:39:13,471 --> 01:39:16,350
through their instinct.
You see that video of that grown man who

2383
01:39:16,351 --> 01:39:19,020
punched out 11 year old girl in the face
of the mall.

2384
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:21,420
That shit makes me mad.
[inaudible] he's so crazy.

2385
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:25,200
There's a bunch of kids apparently that 
were involved in some sort of a scuffle.

2386
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,680
This guy comes over to break it up.
He's yelling at them,

2387
01:39:28,681 --> 01:39:29,514
break it up or get up.
One kid pushes him and then he says 

2388
01:39:33,031 --> 01:39:37,110
something and then pushes the girl.
She goes flying.

2389
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:39,750
She's a little tiny person.
He's a big dude.

2390
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:44,460
She comes at him with her dukes up and 
he just fucking way laser.

2391
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:45,383
I didn't see it hits her with a straight
left right in the mug and he's a big 

2392
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,310
grown man like a,
he looks like a big man.

2393
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:55,770
Who knows how to throw a punch.
I'm not going to play the video.

2394
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:56,773
Do you want to find it?
Go find out what I want to see it 

2395
01:39:58,021 --> 01:39:59,790
fucking disturbing.
But two things.

2396
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:00,624
Did she tell you one?
That guy definitely shouldn't have done 

2397
01:40:02,101 --> 01:40:02,934
that but to,
she shouldn't have fucking run at that 

2398
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:07,110
big giant man with their dukes up like 
God,

2399
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:11,040
I know she's 11 I know I get it.
She didn't know she's a kid and sat down

2400
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:13,740
to teach kids and some 11 kids are 
hardy.

2401
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:14,574
Some 11 year olds are like,
what if you get a Ho like I knew at 12 

2402
01:40:16,471 --> 01:40:17,550
year old that snow.
No,

2403
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:18,630
she's this big.
Oh,

2404
01:40:18,631 --> 01:40:19,950
she's little.
She's tiny.

2405
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:22,410
She's like nipple high on him.
Oh yeah.

2406
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:25,080
Kaos her.
You want to see it?

2407
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:26,430
No,
you do.

2408
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:28,680
You do want to say it.
Draw it for me on a Napkin.

2409
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:30,683
I don't want to see it.

2410
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,100
Yeah,
those are the old days,

2411
01:40:35,101 --> 01:40:35,934
man.
I remember they had a guy who chiseled 

2412
01:40:38,011 --> 01:40:39,000
some tits and new,
uh,

2413
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:41,400
um,
had a pint.

2414
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:42,283
You may,
maybe a birch or something and people 

2415
01:40:43,251 --> 01:40:47,040
would go out there and you're a cough 
drop off at the base of the tree.

2416
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:47,874
He,
I think he used like a step stool or 

2417
01:40:48,691 --> 01:40:49,524
something or sound on a barrel.
That's when you found all the magazines 

2418
01:40:52,051 --> 01:40:53,390
in the woods.
Oh yeah.

2419
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,333
We used to have that.

2420
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:55,563
But as you go out another tree and 
somebody will be using the tree and be 

2421
01:40:57,531 --> 01:40:58,450
like,
Oh fuck,

2422
01:40:58,570 --> 01:41:02,470
I've got to walk back home now.
It's 100% real.

2423
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,940
You're making this up.
You have a photograph?

2424
01:41:03,941 --> 01:41:05,470
This tree?
No.

2425
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:07,780
Why not?
Do you know where it is?

2426
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:10,150
Could you take us back there with a film
crew?

2427
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:11,620
I could take you back there with a film 
crew.

2428
01:41:11,621 --> 01:41:13,990
I bet.
I bet it's devolved now though.

2429
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:15,473
A trade live,
go back there and touch the thing and 

2430
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:18,340
all of a sudden you can't find your way 
back.

2431
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:20,680
Where the fuck are we?
How does,

2432
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,390
we're going in a circle.

2433
01:41:25,290 --> 01:41:26,123
Like it turns out that the tree got 
tired of people jerk off on it so it 

2434
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:34,020
evolves some sort of a neuro toxic.
Then when you touched it,

2435
01:41:34,691 --> 01:41:37,810
it got into your bloodstream.
It distorted your perception of distance

2436
01:41:37,811 --> 01:41:41,220
and time.
Then they go scale,

2437
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,860
but do what if you would've come,
could divide.

2438
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:46,000
They would have semen,
could defy gravity.

2439
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:47,830
What do you think about that?
I don't,

2440
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:49,210
but you know what?
I do think.

2441
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:54,430
Imagine if it wasn't,
if come didn't just get humans pregnant.

2442
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,600
Yeah.
No.

2443
01:41:58,610 --> 01:42:03,570
That's what I think of.
Imagine from frogs to chickens.

2444
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:05,860
I give every way you went.
You found God.

2445
01:42:05,861 --> 01:42:07,030
Just do it.
Fucked a turtle.

2446
01:42:07,031 --> 01:42:09,150
You followed some turtle person.
He got fucking,

2447
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,833
you can't think about that man.
If anything could get anything pregnant 

2448
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:18,670
and a new combination was born turtle 
people too.

2449
01:42:18,671 --> 01:42:20,330
That's what's next.
Coy People.

2450
01:42:20,331 --> 01:42:23,380
Some do fucked a coy Boston's that cory 
mom.

2451
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:27,430
Not that we imagine you're out there 
throwing bread on your Koi pond.

2452
01:42:27,431 --> 01:42:28,264
You're like,
hey,

2453
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:30,760
it has legs.
What the fuck,

2454
01:42:30,761 --> 01:42:32,980
man?
Somebody fuck one eat fish.

2455
01:42:34,110 --> 01:42:36,730
People signed up on the shore.
It's got a sign for you

2456
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:39,493
to,
people see people see you at the pet 

2457
01:42:41,141 --> 01:42:42,730
store shopping and they're like,
Whoa,

2458
01:42:42,731 --> 01:42:43,564
this guy's shady is smashing.
If Ari fucked it and it came out and we 

2459
01:42:46,481 --> 01:42:47,314
knew it because that always knows.
So it's like always knows on a Koi fish 

2460
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:52,540
with legs and it comes out and you're 
like,

2461
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:57,070
no,
your business.

2462
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,480
I'm going to Bali.
You Imagine?

2463
01:43:01,481 --> 01:43:02,314
Yeah,
I'm going to,

2464
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,230
can we go find where my turtle babies on
the other side of the world.

2465
01:43:05,231 --> 01:43:06,670
But if you had to make love to an 
animal,

2466
01:43:06,671 --> 01:43:07,504
what would it be?
If he think he had to go in and they'll 

2467
01:43:08,441 --> 01:43:11,770
be something I could brag about.
Yeah.

2468
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:12,933
I'm not fucking anything sedentary.
I'm not fucking anything that's like a 

2469
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:16,690
basic,
something ends up in the poultry section

2470
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:18,880
or anything like that.
No beat half to be a female.

2471
01:43:18,910 --> 01:43:20,620
What have you had gay sex with an 
animal.

2472
01:43:20,621 --> 01:43:22,600
Which animal would it be?
That's not gate a fucking animal,

2473
01:43:22,601 --> 01:43:23,500
Bro.
It's not,

2474
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:27,480
I don't think that applies to your 
fucking an animal that's more important.

2475
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:31,150
If it's like a male gorilla,
I think it's both hot dude.

2476
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,690
Gay and beastiality.
Nobody's seen to be like,

2477
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,060
oh,
remember when you get,

2478
01:43:36,061 --> 01:43:37,870
they would then have been let you off.

2479
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:39,130
The people are mean.
They're going to go.

2480
01:43:39,131 --> 01:43:39,964
Not only did he fuck a chip,
he fucked a mail chimp and everybody 

2481
01:43:43,581 --> 01:43:44,770
would be like,
Jesus,

2482
01:43:44,771 --> 01:43:47,610
theo,
bro,

2483
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:50,170
you would never buy a beer again.
You put you on a break,

2484
01:43:50,171 --> 01:43:51,004
the Internet.
You put a fucking video of me sneaking 

2485
01:43:53,151 --> 01:43:56,000
up on a Cheetah and fucking it.
Well,

2486
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,033
I will wrap it.
A noose around its neck and you're 

2487
01:43:58,641 --> 01:44:02,780
banging it while it's clawing on yet.
Let's try to get away and you nut.

2488
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:03,733
Nah,
I'm talking about putting on some Eddie 

2489
01:44:04,951 --> 01:44:08,780
levert or some Gerald levert and playing
some sweet music and just lay in there.

2490
01:44:09,550 --> 01:44:12,170
How do you plan on holding it in place 
while that's all happening?

2491
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:14,210
I think if you're good enough and 
general enough,

2492
01:44:14,211 --> 01:44:16,310
it'll stay.
Wow.

2493
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:17,533
You don't think so?
Think about it to you for a managing it 

2494
01:44:19,371 --> 01:44:21,410
though.
I love to look at the world through your

2495
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:24,080
eyes,
right to the hospital,

2496
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:27,230
whatever medication where on.
We got to change it.

2497
01:44:27,410 --> 01:44:28,790
We've got to fix this,
bro.

2498
01:44:28,791 --> 01:44:30,770
You shouldn't beat yourself then,
Bro.

2499
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:34,280
You are extra terrestrial man.

2500
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:39,210
This is the most,
I smiled all week though.

2501
01:44:39,211 --> 01:44:40,610
So good.
Oh Dude.

2502
01:44:40,611 --> 01:44:41,720
We always have a good time,
bro.

2503
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:43,490
That's funny.
Are you working tonight?

2504
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,940
You do in Tripoli shows?
Yeah,

2505
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:45,930
yeah,
yeah,

2506
01:44:45,931 --> 01:44:46,730
yeah,
yeah.

2507
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:48,110
That's fine.
Those are good times.

2508
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:49,700
Do what a fun job,
man.

2509
01:44:49,701 --> 01:44:51,350
I just started really realizing it this 
year.

2510
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:52,583
That's what I was saying.
Like your idea of like looking back on 

2511
01:44:54,441 --> 01:44:55,730
your youth.
Are you crazy?

2512
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,620
We're alive.
We're alive.

2513
01:44:57,621 --> 01:45:00,530
Doing the most fun job you could have.
Yeah.

2514
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:02,540
Well how would we change that?
You want to get busy?

2515
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:03,171
I want to like,
you know,

2516
01:45:03,171 --> 01:45:05,690
get busy live in this year and just try 
more things and just,

2517
01:45:05,691 --> 01:45:07,100
you know,
enjoy my time.

2518
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:08,480
That I,
that I am alive.

2519
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:10,340
That's what's up.
I really do the,

2520
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:11,253
the whole thing about life is all that.
I wish I was doing this or I wish I was 

2521
01:45:15,201 --> 01:45:18,410
doing that is only good if you're 
working towards something,

2522
01:45:18,710 --> 01:45:20,240
but I wish I was young again.

2523
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:23,480
Let that go.
That is not happening.

2524
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:25,700
Yeah.
I wish I was eight foot tall.

2525
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,650
That's not happening.
I wish I could fly.

2526
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:30,890
I wish I could breathe underwater like 
aqua man.

2527
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:31,873
It's not happening.
I could see paying to get Gill's 

2528
01:45:33,831 --> 01:45:36,200
installed though.
I could see you coming up one day.

2529
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:40,250
They get come up with some gene editing 
some gills like damn man.

2530
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:41,084
Fuck scuba diving.
It takes you to the side and shows you 

2531
01:45:42,861 --> 01:45:44,960
his gills.
I don't like snorkeling bro.

2532
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:45,843
Yeah,
that shit.

2533
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:48,950
I snorkeled a little bit when I was in 
Hawaii.

2534
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:51,890
It's fun man.
It's wild.

2535
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:53,143
You're out there looking down.
You watched all these fish swimming 

2536
01:45:54,861 --> 01:45:57,470
around like did we went near this coral 
reef.

2537
01:45:58,010 --> 01:46:02,200
It's crazy cause it's just this world 
down there to post.

2538
01:46:02,201 --> 01:46:04,240
And how easy was it for you to black 
ops?

2539
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:06,830
Like sharks or something?
Just not out of the blue.

2540
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:08,240
We're not easy.
No,

2541
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:09,133
no.
This real like you're always thinking 

2542
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,440
like what if one of those motherfuckers 
is here?

2543
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:13,610
Oh,
and you look like a Dell,

2544
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:18,640
like a damn delectable event to a shark 
who definitely thinking like a mouthful.

2545
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:20,211
Oh,
but yeah,

2546
01:46:20,211 --> 01:46:20,961
I mean,
you know what I'm saying?

2547
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:22,460
If,
if joe's out there,

2548
01:46:22,461 --> 01:46:24,500
that's a,
that's a real snack.

2549
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:28,240
How many famous people that have been 
killed by sharks senator happened?

2550
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:29,323
That'd be crazy.
I feel like ll cool j got killed by a 

2551
01:46:31,821 --> 01:46:33,050
shark and Malibu.
You'd be like,

2552
01:46:33,051 --> 01:46:34,010
what the fuck?

2553
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,280
He know.
He'd be like,

2554
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:38,510
well,
how was that real?

2555
01:46:38,780 --> 01:46:41,030
How could it happen?
Right?

2556
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:42,103
What if Oj Simpson got Jack by a shark?
Can you imagine how many Haas would 

2557
01:46:46,551 --> 01:46:48,660
break out across the country?
Ha.

2558
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:54,600
If you could see Oj Simpson Info,
it would have to be Florida.

2559
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,250
He'd be,
he's in Florida.

2560
01:46:56,251 --> 01:46:58,510
A lot of her,
of course I was white trash girl.

2561
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:00,600
I'll fucking,
he's waving,

2562
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:04,380
waving to the beach and you just see the
Finn like 15 feet away from him.

2563
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:09,650
If he go under and then they yank the 
blood in the water.

2564
01:47:10,350 --> 01:47:11,183
Like no way
did I miss Oj Simpson and Dennis Rodman 

2565
01:47:15,871 --> 01:47:17,700
and fucked a lot of the same chicks,
Bro.

2566
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:21,330
When you think about that,
what if,

2567
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:22,200
what if the kid,
well,

2568
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:24,210
I don't think Oj Simpson's allowed to 
leave the country,

2569
01:47:24,211 --> 01:47:25,320
right?
I was saying,

2570
01:47:25,321 --> 01:47:27,310
what if Kim Jon wound starts partying 
with Oj?

2571
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:31,500
It's like,
I don't care.

2572
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,830
I don't care what he did to the Jews did
loose.

2573
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:40,470
A buddy of mine was doing cocaine with 
Oj Simpson one time and and in Miami.

2574
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:43,260
How long ago?
This is like 15 years ago.

2575
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:44,700
Posted murder then?
Yup.

2576
01:47:44,730 --> 01:47:46,830
After the murder and the guy goes,
hey,

2577
01:47:46,831 --> 01:47:49,380
does anybody have a car key?
And an ease hits Oj.

2578
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:49,861
He's like,
Hey,

2579
01:47:49,861 --> 01:47:50,694
you have a car key or a knife?
That's what he asked him for to do the 

2580
01:47:53,011 --> 01:47:54,420
cocaine off of.
Oh,

2581
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,350
she knows.
She's like,

2582
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:58,920
this guy's a fucking knife.
Was He laughing?

2583
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:00,420
Yeah.
That's pretty funny.

2584
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:01,523
I think it's funny.
I mean if you didn't get in trouble for 

2585
01:48:04,081 --> 01:48:05,070
it,
even if you did it,

2586
01:48:05,071 --> 01:48:07,050
I think having a sense of humor about it
still important.

2587
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:08,333
The way he reacted every step of the way
did not seem like a guy who was being 

2588
01:48:14,610 --> 01:48:17,020
accused of something.
He didn't do every step right.

2589
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,920
Every step of the way,
so I wouldn't do that.

2590
01:48:20,170 --> 01:48:21,740
Oh,
I couldn't do hard.

2591
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:22,583
Don't even matter.
That is not what you'd say if your wife 

2592
01:48:25,531 --> 01:48:26,580
got killed.
Right.

2593
01:48:26,581 --> 01:48:27,414
He would not be thinking like that.
You'd be hard for a freaking the fuck 

2594
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:30,940
out.
I know you what does exist,

2595
01:48:30,941 --> 01:48:33,800
but you should watch this one multi.
Oh,

2596
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:34,800
Sasha Baron Cohen.

2597
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:35,703
The very,
very end of the show is almost like a 

2598
01:48:37,331 --> 01:48:38,164
bonus scene.

2599
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:39,163
Oh,
I didn't know he got this deep with the 

2600
01:48:40,401 --> 01:48:41,820
a outfit.
You spent a cow.

2601
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:44,260
It's just,
it's part of his is like cell.

2602
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:45,900
She's like a girl that's supposed to be 
with them.

2603
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:50,400
He's like this uh,
extravagant millionaire billionaire type

2604
01:48:50,401 --> 01:48:51,234
character.

2605
01:48:51,430 --> 01:48:53,140
Oh.
And he's got Oj and yeah,

2606
01:48:53,141 --> 01:48:53,974
I need to see this show period.
I think he spent like three or four 

2607
01:48:55,991 --> 01:48:56,830
hours with them.
He said,

2608
01:48:57,010 --> 01:49:00,010
did you hear that?
They might have uncovered a pedo ring.

2609
01:49:01,210 --> 01:49:03,670
He might have uncovered a Pedo ring when
he was doing this.

2610
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:04,151
Oh,
Jane.

2611
01:49:04,151 --> 01:49:04,990
Dan?
No,

2612
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:06,700
Sasha Baron Cohen.
Oh Wow.

2613
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:07,630
Oh yeah.
Did you see it?

2614
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:11,080
I read a headline that says find what 
the exact specifics of it were,

2615
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:14,410
but like they decided not to air it,
but it's like what dude?

2616
01:49:14,411 --> 01:49:15,244
You know what,
when you said that about Oj and made me 

2617
01:49:16,331 --> 01:49:19,240
think I met Buzz Aldrin from the moon.
Yes.

2618
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,940
And he's,
and when I met him,

2619
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:24,820
it didn't seem like he'd been to the 
moon.

2620
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:27,150
You know what I'm saying?
That Colin,

2621
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:28,270
yeah.
Hold on a second.

2622
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,800
Uh,
sent cut.

2623
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:33,400
Who is America interview to FBI over 
fears of Las Vegas.

2624
01:49:33,401 --> 01:49:36,940
Pedophile around but not surprised.
Whoa.

2625
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:38,253
Said the sub sub said the interview led 
him to believe there could be a 

2626
01:49:42,341 --> 01:49:45,670
pedophile ring in Las Vegas.
Holy Shit.

2627
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:48,310
Could you imagine of a pedophile ring in
Las Vegas

2628
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:49,143
was exposed by Sasha Baron Cohen and a 
comedy movie and they find out it's 

2629
01:49:53,201 --> 01:49:55,350
real.
I wonder if this is all,

2630
01:49:55,351 --> 01:49:57,370
this is a setup for some other type of 
film,

2631
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,120
but let's look at objective.
Okay.

2632
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,033
Okay.
There has to have been pedophile rings 

2633
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:03,220
in the past.
Undeniable.

2634
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:05,710
Right.
I would think if you go back,

2635
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:09,400
you go back to like the 50s or the 
forties and the 30s,

2636
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:12,010
there has to be something like that easy
back then.

2637
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:14,350
Yeah.
They take orphans and they molest him.

2638
01:50:14,351 --> 01:50:17,560
All that Sandusky type shit that has 
been going on.

2639
01:50:17,650 --> 01:50:18,483
Yeah.
So how often has it been going on and 

2640
01:50:20,561 --> 01:50:22,870
what happens now to the same type of 
people?

2641
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:25,150
Like if that's no longer available for 
them,

2642
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:30,720
is there some way they get it,
some super fucking super tightly watched

2643
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:33,483
circuit ring of people who still engage 
in this activity and figured out a way 

2644
01:50:37,331 --> 01:50:37,900
to do it?

2645
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,610
I hope not.
I hope not too.

2646
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,930
Everybody hopes not,
but the idea that it's impossible.

2647
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:48,370
The idea that it's impossible is 
unlikely.

2648
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:49,600
Yeah.
There's probably a market for it,

2649
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:50,520
sadly.
Well,

2650
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:53,110
you think about it all the time when you
think about other countries,

2651
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:55,030
right?
They're doing it there for sure.

2652
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:56,260
Yeah.
Most of our guys,

2653
01:50:56,261 --> 01:50:58,840
it seems fly over these other countries 
and be dirty over there.

2654
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:02,200
The idea of like going over there and 
there's a ring,

2655
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:04,090
a pedophile ring.
Ooh,

2656
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:07,810
that's scary dude.
Who wants to fuck some kid?

2657
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:09,573
That's crazy.
They think it's mostly people who have 

2658
01:51:13,371 --> 01:51:15,580
been abused like that themselves.
Yeah,

2659
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:16,510
it's mostly,
yeah.

2660
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:17,343
That's one of the things that Kevin 
Spacey's brothers said about Kevin is 

2661
01:51:21,071 --> 01:51:21,904
that Kevin is basically like their dad 
and their dad sexually abused them and 

2662
01:51:26,111 --> 01:51:28,690
now Kevin is acting that out and there 
was,

2663
01:51:28,691 --> 01:51:29,411
uh,
an interview.

2664
01:51:29,411 --> 01:51:30,244
His Dad,
his brother rather give her see Kevin 

2665
01:51:31,950 --> 01:51:36,950
Spacey's brother and I never met Ron 
Stewart on the strongest acid available.

2666
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:39,190
Oh,
he's crazy looking.

2667
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:40,233
This is so weird looking guy with wacky 
hair and he wears funky glasses and 

2668
01:51:43,481 --> 01:51:44,710
weird clothes.
Donnie,

2669
01:51:44,711 --> 01:51:46,450
what's his name?
I don't know what his name is,

2670
01:51:46,510 --> 01:51:47,980
but he looks like he's wearing a 
costume.

2671
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,350
Donny space it.
That's not it,

2672
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:50,410
is it?
No,

2673
01:51:51,090 --> 01:51:54,220
but here it took a look at them.
Just look at this.

2674
01:51:54,221 --> 01:51:55,150
That's,
that's his brother.

2675
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,710
God Dang Man.
It looks like Nice.

2676
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:02,170
Scott seemed like an English scientist 
and Rod Stewart.

2677
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,400
I can't believe Kevin's one of they got 
banged by the day.

2678
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:07,510
I think they both did.
I think you saying they both did.

2679
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:09,370
I can't believe I even said that.
It's messed up.

2680
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:11,590
Yeah,
I'm sad man.

2681
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:13,780
They said their dad was a monster.
Yeah.

2682
01:52:13,870 --> 01:52:14,920
Look at his dad like,
look,

2683
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:16,180
look at this.
His brother,

2684
01:52:16,181 --> 01:52:17,014
how he dresses up.
Let me get that crazy rod stewart 

2685
01:52:18,641 --> 01:52:19,474
outfit.
Yeah,

2686
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:19,960
I bet.

2687
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:20,793
Like one chick or one dude fucked him 
because he thought it was rod stewart 

2688
01:52:24,461 --> 01:52:24,911
and he's like,
look,

2689
01:52:24,911 --> 01:52:27,330
I'm just going to ride this boat riding 
into the rock,

2690
01:52:27,331 --> 01:52:28,000
right,
stuart.

2691
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,620
Huh?
This is outfit.

2692
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:30,840
That's crazy.
Outfit.

2693
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:32,890
That has a crazy,
crazy outfit.

2694
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:33,933
He's got rings on every finger.
He's got a wallet chain across his 

2695
01:52:36,491 --> 01:52:37,990
Pecker.
Wow.

2696
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:40,270
Those dicks keeping time brother.
Yeah.

2697
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:45,170
Look at that shirt at fluffy shirt with 
the crazy ass neck accouterments.

2698
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:46,783
Yeah.
If you're not trying to get fucked by 

2699
01:52:47,661 --> 01:52:49,390
somebody,
you shouldn't wear all this at them,

2700
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:52,130
but think about how much effort it took 
to do all this.

2701
01:52:52,131 --> 01:52:54,830
Now go up to his teeth,
son.

2702
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:55,881
Yeah,
son.

2703
01:52:55,881 --> 01:52:58,460
What's up with that Mug at Scotland row?
Clean that shit up.

2704
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:01,490
Is he from Scotland?
It's Kevin Spacey from Scotland.

2705
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:04,250
I think they're from Britain.
I think they're from America.

2706
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:05,143
Really?
Yeah.

2707
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:07,010
Where'd,
where was Kevin Spacey?

2708
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:08,480
Boring.
Fuck.

2709
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:11,990
If you know you're googling it.
Well now over a year.

2710
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:14,270
Now you're the guy.
He's got the Google in front of you,

2711
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:17,720
but no.
What about this?

2712
01:53:17,721 --> 01:53:19,280
Do you think he would have been as 
talented,

2713
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:22,160
but if he didn't have this affliction,
where does it say?

2714
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:24,430
Does it say worries from Orange,
New Jersey?

2715
01:53:24,431 --> 01:53:25,041
You see,
there you go.

2716
01:53:25,041 --> 01:53:25,874
Perfect dump.
And one of the most talented men of our 

2717
01:53:29,151 --> 01:53:31,220
time,
I think people look in New Jersey.

2718
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:32,300
Fuck you bro.
Hey,

2719
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:35,330
I was born there.
He is very talented.

2720
01:53:35,410 --> 01:53:40,410
He's also very crazy and I think uh,
in his day you could get away with a lot

2721
01:53:41,210 --> 01:53:43,370
if you're were a movie star,
I think,

2722
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:44,263
you know,
they just,

2723
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:47,630
they ran those sets like,
oh yeah,

2724
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:48,493
they were crazy.
Well they have that are Kelly thing now 

2725
01:53:49,731 --> 01:53:52,280
and in that hook guy his whole life,
he got to do whatever you wanted.

2726
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,170
It seemed like that's a different 
animal.

2727
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,880
Right?
Cause he's a musician.

2728
01:53:55,881 --> 01:53:58,760
But yeah,
it seems like he's the underage,

2729
01:53:58,850 --> 01:54:02,480
the under age thing with him is like 
Aaliyah married,

2730
01:54:02,481 --> 01:54:03,314
Aaliyah underage sex with her underage,
and it was till I remember we just grew 

2731
01:54:05,991 --> 01:54:07,550
up listening to his music.
It was,

2732
01:54:07,830 --> 01:54:11,160
these girls are coming out about him 
doing that to then when they're here.

2733
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:13,220
But a lot of people new 13,
14,

2734
01:54:13,221 --> 01:54:16,130
they're saying 15 w but I can't believe 
more people aren't comes up.

2735
01:54:16,131 --> 01:54:16,964
Let's say there was a video of it.
You know that more people aren't 

2736
01:54:20,541 --> 01:54:22,310
complicit in that.
It was unbelievable.

2737
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:25,010
What about the people that are like,
well here's what's crazy.

2738
01:54:25,490 --> 01:54:26,323
Did the video is out of him,
peanut on people and then years later 

2739
01:54:29,421 --> 01:54:31,120
people are still making music with them.
Yeah.

2740
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:35,330
Wow.
That's crazy.

2741
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:38,300
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2742
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:40,630
That's crazy.
When you find out how many people were,

2743
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:41,450
what was it?

2744
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:44,630
Was it the breakfast club?
What show was it that they,

2745
01:54:44,631 --> 01:54:45,464
uh,
they started reading off a list of all 

2746
01:54:46,881 --> 01:54:51,200
the people that worked with our Kelly 
post video.

2747
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,570
So the video was out,
Lady Gaga,

2748
01:54:53,571 --> 01:54:58,550
all these people and like a giant number
of people.

2749
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:00,460
Do you think we'll ever be able to 
eradicate that?

2750
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,360
The fact that people do that too,
like,

2751
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:03,253
ah,
ha the pedophile or had that vibe for 

2752
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:08,390
them first to sexual sexualized children
or young people.

2753
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:09,493
Hopefully scientists will figure out a 
way to isolate that part of human 

2754
01:55:16,341 --> 01:55:17,870
thinking someday.
Like,

2755
01:55:17,871 --> 01:55:21,260
hopefully there'll be something 
researchers,

2756
01:55:21,620 --> 01:55:22,730
doctors,
scientists,

2757
01:55:22,731 --> 01:55:23,564
psychologist,
whoever it is figured out a way to stop 

2758
01:55:25,281 --> 01:55:26,114
that.
But in the meantime what it has gotten 

2759
01:55:28,161 --> 01:55:30,440
is way more difficult for them to get 
away with it.

2760
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:31,333
Right,
right.

2761
01:55:31,610 --> 01:55:34,850
And it's going to get more difficult 
still.

2762
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:37,190
I think people are going to be 
connected.

2763
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:39,440
I mean we're connected right now with 
cell phones.

2764
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:41,900
Like this is how weird the connection 
is.

2765
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:43,263
Um,
you know Adam Green tree who was here 

2766
01:55:44,281 --> 01:55:46,560
yesterday when we were talking about 
Toyota Tundras,

2767
01:55:46,930 --> 01:55:51,060
he said after we were talking about it 
and he said all of his ads on his phone,

2768
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:54,180
like when he would look at a website,
it would all be Toyota ads.

2769
01:55:54,210 --> 01:55:55,830
No Way.
It's like they're listening.

2770
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:58,290
Yeah.
They're listening to his phone.

2771
01:55:58,440 --> 01:55:59,273
Like the word Toyota Tundra came up over
and over and over again in his search 

2772
01:56:02,911 --> 01:56:04,290
searches.
Toyota trucks,

2773
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:06,450
cause we were talking about Toyota 
trucks,

2774
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,900
Toyota trucks.
I'm a say that bacon draw,

2775
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:11,010
Toyota Tacoma.
Say it over and over again.

2776
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:12,233
But whenever the fuck process of,
I mean I don't know if he actually 

2777
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:20,530
accidentally googled Toyota trucks that 
day too,

2778
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:23,680
but they found out who he is.
He's there.

2779
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:29,010
My point is like saying something in a 
conversation and it's being connected to

2780
01:56:29,011 --> 01:56:30,330
these internet searches.

2781
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:31,613
Like these little things are starting to
happen and it's going to get more and 

2782
01:56:34,771 --> 01:56:36,570
more prevalent.
It's over for us.

2783
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:38,263
We're going to be like way more 
connected now than we were going to be 

2784
01:56:42,481 --> 01:56:44,820
way more connected rather than 10 years 
and we are now,

2785
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:45,713
fuck man,
we got to figure out what would that be 

2786
01:56:46,681 --> 01:56:50,940
like because no one saw this comment.
No one saw us being disconnected.

2787
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:54,150
So what the fuck is it going to be like 
if we're connected much,

2788
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:57,090
much more than that in the future,
what's that going to be?

2789
01:56:57,270 --> 01:56:58,103
And it's going to be,
it's going to be something unimaginable 

2790
01:57:00,781 --> 01:57:02,460
cause it's this was unimaginable.
Right.

2791
01:57:03,250 --> 01:57:04,083
That's what I'm thinking.
It's going to be some next plane that 

2792
01:57:05,461 --> 01:57:06,294
we're going to get to.
There has to be some next level of 

2793
01:57:08,161 --> 01:57:11,630
intuition.
Maybe that comes into it or I,

2794
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:13,500
when I was really high,
I thought this up.

2795
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:16,170
Yeah.
My really high thought was,

2796
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:17,483
you know how kids learn things really 
easily are they will just learn things 

2797
01:57:20,071 --> 01:57:22,110
way easier.
They can learn a language really easy.

2798
01:57:22,111 --> 01:57:25,290
They're gonna if very soon in the 
future,

2799
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,153
a universal language is developed that 
coincides with artificial artificial 

2800
01:57:32,131 --> 01:57:33,810
intelligence,
technology,

2801
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:37,470
virtual reality,
and augmented and augmented reality.

2802
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:42,480
And so this universal language allows 
people of all languages.

2803
01:57:42,510 --> 01:57:43,343
They can learn it and they can learn it.
And this was coming off of something 

2804
01:57:45,661 --> 01:57:50,661
that Jamie said once we're talking about
emojis being almost like hieroglyphs.

2805
01:57:51,410 --> 01:57:52,243
I'm like,
wow,

2806
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:55,320
that seems so weird because they seem so
cute and Corny,

2807
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:56,273
but,
but someone could send you a whole 

2808
01:57:57,990 --> 01:58:02,990
series of them like eggplant water,
a smiley face,

2809
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:04,500
high five,
and that's like,

2810
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:05,520
oh,
someone wants to fuck.

2811
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:06,383
Oh yeah.
Right.

2812
01:58:06,710 --> 01:58:08,700
That's my right.
Meet time to meme.

2813
01:58:08,701 --> 01:58:10,100
A picture could sell.
Sure.

2814
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,393
Jack's all those things.
Well while I was thinking that I was 

2815
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:13,351
like,
okay,

2816
01:58:13,351 --> 01:58:14,184
well what would stop once they develop 
augmented reality or artists or or a 

2817
01:58:19,501 --> 01:58:23,400
virtual reality in some sort of a easily
digestible form,

2818
01:58:23,401 --> 01:58:24,234
whatever it is,
whether it's a chip that you have in 

2819
01:58:25,471 --> 01:58:27,600
your body that sends signals directly to
your brain,

2820
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:28,770
allows you to communicate with each 
other.

2821
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:29,963
If we developed a language and we can 
send and receive images in a way that 

2822
01:58:33,031 --> 01:58:33,864
may be even more effective than the 
language that we assume that English is 

2823
01:58:37,801 --> 01:58:40,500
the best way to talk cause we only know 
how to talk English.

2824
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:43,690
Maybe if we could speak Chinese,
we could express ourselves clear.

2825
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:48,010
Maybe if we speak Turkish or Arabic,
maybe there's a better one.

2826
01:58:48,011 --> 01:58:49,630
I don't know.
I only know one language.

2827
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:55,140
But what if w sound languages are far 
inferior to visual languages and what of

2828
01:58:56,621 --> 01:58:57,454
these visual languages allow people that
even can't even see to see because they 

2829
01:59:00,311 --> 01:59:01,900
could send it directly into their mind.

2830
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:02,733
They can see these things with their 
eyes closed and I've been using her 

2831
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:07,960
eyeballs and everybody can communicate 
on an even plane.

2832
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:11,200
So there's no language barriers.
And when I was thinking this,

2833
01:59:11,201 --> 01:59:11,771
I was like,
well,

2834
01:59:11,771 --> 01:59:13,120
that's gotta be this impossible.
No,

2835
01:59:13,121 --> 01:59:15,700
it's not impossible because there's more
than a hundred languages.

2836
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:16,990
I mean,
how many languages are there?

2837
01:59:16,991 --> 01:59:17,824
If you had to guess,
I would have bet there's probably a 

2838
01:59:19,451 --> 01:59:23,080
hundred and maybe 15 yeah,
I bet you're right.

2839
01:59:23,110 --> 01:59:26,100
I'll say 130 let's go crazy.
I'll say 130 locations.

2840
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:29,130
There's probably a thousand who the fuck
knows language bob?

2841
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:30,340
One language,
Bob.

2842
01:59:30,370 --> 01:59:31,960
More.
More than a thousand okay.

2843
01:59:31,961 --> 01:59:35,140
I'm going to go then.
I would like to have a separate guest.

2844
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:40,170
I want to go with 1800 I would like to 
go with 1060

2845
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:43,713
that says there are roughly,
this is number of spoken languages in 

2846
01:59:47,491 --> 01:59:49,620
the world today.
6,500

2847
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:55,210
whoa.
What were home out to about 2000

2848
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:58,070
those have less,
fewer than a thousand speakers,

2849
01:59:58,071 --> 02:00:00,320
so even if we count those off,
it's still for over 40

2850
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:01,653
well,
you know those people on that central 

2851
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:05,230
north central island,
I think they have a dead language.

2852
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:08,650
There's only 39 really?
Where that guy got killed was only 39 of

2853
02:00:08,651 --> 02:00:10,150
them.
4,000.

2854
02:00:10,210 --> 02:00:12,310
So even if you take off that 2,500,
right,

2855
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:13,173
if you take those off,
the ones that he said that only less 

2856
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:16,510
than a hundred people or you have,
but they're using it.

2857
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:17,291
Right.
Good point.

2858
02:00:17,291 --> 02:00:18,940
Well,
here's the thing that's really crazy.

2859
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:20,040
Um,
the,

2860
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:20,750
the,
the,

2861
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:21,583
the indigenous people of Australia,
my friend Adam Green tree who was here 

2862
02:00:24,491 --> 02:00:25,420
yesterday,
he,

2863
02:00:25,421 --> 02:00:26,980
uh,
he works with a lot of these people.

2864
02:00:26,981 --> 02:00:30,400
He doesn't like a mining company and one
of his,

2865
02:00:30,401 --> 02:00:32,560
uh,
like a bunch of the people that you work

2866
02:00:32,561 --> 02:00:33,394
with wood explained to him these 
different languages that they're not 

2867
02:00:37,631 --> 02:00:38,464
written down and you and your mob,
like they would call the aborigines 

2868
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:44,380
would call themselves up.
Like it's,

2869
02:00:44,390 --> 02:00:46,930
it's not like a clan,
it's called a mob there.

2870
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:47,763
A term for it would have a totally 
different language than someone who 

2871
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:53,650
lives just a few miles away.
So they'd be a different mob.

2872
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:55,660
It was a few miles away.
Totally different language.

2873
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,280
You can't understand what the fuck 
they're saying.

2874
02:00:57,430 --> 02:00:58,540
They don't know what the fuck you're 
saying.

2875
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:00,880
Then there's another one over here and 
there's never no one of the one.

2876
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:02,740
I'm like,
how many do you think there is?

2877
02:01:02,741 --> 02:01:03,071
He's like,
oh,

2878
02:01:03,071 --> 02:01:05,230
it was probably hundreds,
like hundreds.

2879
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:06,333
Hundreds of different languages.
Nobody knows what the fuck anybody say 

2880
02:01:08,751 --> 02:01:09,584
it.
It's almost like they don't want the 

2881
02:01:10,031 --> 02:01:11,920
other one to know because it's like 
they'll get their secrets.

2882
02:01:11,921 --> 02:01:12,754
Maybe.

2883
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,793
How many do you think there's another 
report that says there's this number of 

2884
02:01:16,981 --> 02:01:21,290
languages that are spoken in us homes as
of this as of 2015 ooh.

2885
02:01:21,710 --> 02:01:23,130
It's a smaller number,
but

2886
02:01:24,990 --> 02:01:29,990
303 50 wow.
At least it says at least 300 if you had

2887
02:01:30,061 --> 02:01:32,760
asked me before this conversation,
I said 13 yeah,

2888
02:01:32,810 --> 02:01:33,643
me too.
So I was going to guess actually I was 

2889
02:01:34,411 --> 02:01:36,780
going to guess 11 fuck,
that's a lot of languages.

2890
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:39,280
That's so crazy.
Awesome.

2891
02:01:39,850 --> 02:01:40,920
We're fuck no,
no,

2892
02:01:40,921 --> 02:01:41,754
no,
we're okay.

2893
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:42,673
That makes my point.
I think the next stage is a universal 

2894
02:01:46,761 --> 02:01:47,900
language.
Yeah.

2895
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:51,170
Universal language would like think 
about the aborigines there.

2896
02:01:51,171 --> 02:01:52,004
That's how fucked up situation to be in.
Nobody knows what the fuck anybody 

2897
02:01:53,961 --> 02:01:55,700
saying and none of those things are 
written down.

2898
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:59,750
So you have to be in that clan to 
understand that language or that mob and

2899
02:01:59,751 --> 02:02:02,780
then they die off.
And the third thing in small,

2900
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:03,853
small ball,
well they didn't think it's not planned 

2901
02:02:05,301 --> 02:02:07,310
out well,
but we are connected.

2902
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:08,203
Everyone is interconnected.
And I think through a universal 

2903
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:12,374
language,
it's entirely possible that we could 

2904
02:02:14,361 --> 02:02:16,610
reshape civilization.
Yeah.

2905
02:02:16,970 --> 02:02:19,970
Through a universal language that every 
kid picks up in school.

2906
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:22,070
You teach them bing,
bong,

2907
02:02:22,310 --> 02:02:22,971
right?
Upside,

2908
02:02:22,971 --> 02:02:25,070
uh,
English or Chinese or anything else.

2909
02:02:25,071 --> 02:02:26,430
But being bong is the,
the,

2910
02:02:26,431 --> 02:02:30,320
the Internet language and this Internet 
language that everybody understands.

2911
02:02:30,321 --> 02:02:31,850
Everybody just starts communicating 
through bing,

2912
02:02:31,851 --> 02:02:33,440
bong and nobody,
yeah,

2913
02:02:33,441 --> 02:02:36,080
nobody's using regular language anymore.
He just,

2914
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:38,120
you occasionally talked like when you're
in bed,

2915
02:02:38,121 --> 02:02:38,990
he'd talk,
you had bitch,

2916
02:02:38,991 --> 02:02:39,824
remember dirty talk,
English and English to talk [inaudible] 

2917
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:44,680
French dirty talking to Israel,

2918
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:47,820
185 that are spoken just in Los Angeles.

2919
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:49,443
Ooh,
wow.

2920
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:52,040
That's a lot.
But that makes sense.

2921
02:02:52,310 --> 02:02:54,220
If there's 300 in the country,
I would,

2922
02:02:56,450 --> 02:02:59,020
I would think all of them would be here.
I'm more shocked at all the money.

2923
02:02:59,021 --> 02:03:00,050
He was pretty multicultural.

2924
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:04,530
There's a group in 2,500 people or so 
that speak Dutch at home in Riverside.

2925
02:03:05,140 --> 02:03:06,500
Oh yeah,
that makes sense.

2926
02:03:06,950 --> 02:03:07,940
But only Dutch.

2927
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:08,701
No.
Well,

2928
02:03:08,701 --> 02:03:10,740
not only,
but that mostly.

2929
02:03:10,741 --> 02:03:11,520
Maybe I can.

2930
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:14,010
That's riverside.
Dutch are so aerodynamic.

2931
02:03:14,670 --> 02:03:16,110
They move good.
No,

2932
02:03:16,111 --> 02:03:17,790
you ever seen a Dutch?
There really are dynamic.

2933
02:03:17,791 --> 02:03:20,390
They're the what?
What are you doing with your hands?

2934
02:03:20,391 --> 02:03:21,990
Lean face.
Lean headed.

2935
02:03:22,470 --> 02:03:25,170
Tell it not four inches.
Cheek to cheek or big people,

2936
02:03:25,171 --> 02:03:26,004
man.
Dude.

2937
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:28,130
Do you know how big they are?
The datto,

2938
02:03:28,170 --> 02:03:30,220
they're very tall,
but they're very,

2939
02:03:30,221 --> 02:03:32,140
or dynamic.
Very aerodynamic.

2940
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:33,720
Downhill people.
They call him dude.

2941
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,870
Pulled up a dud.
Okay.

2942
02:03:36,871 --> 02:03:40,080
Pull up or Nesto.
Who's Ernesto?

2943
02:03:40,081 --> 02:03:41,940
Who's getting gander at this cell right 
here.

2944
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:44,520
Miss Dutch.
Kickboxer Mr. Perfect.

2945
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:46,373
I bet you it's hard to kick them in the 
sides of his head because he has a 

2946
02:03:48,691 --> 02:03:50,790
little less than others.
Scott,

2947
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,520
Dan with Donna's.
That's him later in his career too.

2948
02:03:54,030 --> 02:03:55,940
If you get earlier in his career,
he's more jacked.

2949
02:03:55,990 --> 02:03:57,590
Get earlier in his career when it's 
right there.

2950
02:03:57,660 --> 02:03:59,460
Bam.
Take that picture right there.

2951
02:03:59,670 --> 02:03:59,881
No,
no,

2952
02:03:59,881 --> 02:04:00,714
no.
The one above it where your cursor was 

2953
02:04:02,130 --> 02:04:05,520
to write to the right,
to the left of that one or right.

2954
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:08,620
I'm sorry of that photo you just pulled 
up the right of the photo.

2955
02:04:08,621 --> 02:04:10,350
You just pulled up that one right there.
Bam.

2956
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:11,880
That's what he looked like when he was 
in his prime.

2957
02:04:12,930 --> 02:04:13,763
Can we,
let's get a basic Dutch that guys in 

2958
02:04:14,851 --> 02:04:17,490
advanced though,
which I feel like advanced Dutch.

2959
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:18,211
Look at him.
Yeah,

2960
02:04:18,211 --> 02:04:19,044
that guys.
Okay.

2961
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:24,120
How about rob came in.
Rob K,

2962
02:04:24,121 --> 02:04:26,640
a m.
E.

2963
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:26,640
N.
R.

2964
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:27,160
A.
N Rather,

2965
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:29,580
while the greatest kickboxers of all 
time and there we go.

2966
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:32,790
Aerodynamic and
narrow.

2967
02:04:32,791 --> 02:04:35,490
His head is,
he's looking at you sideways.

2968
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,980
What up about basic Dutch got not look 
like a guy

2969
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:38,970
with a narrow head,
bro.

2970
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:40,251
Yes,
it does.

2971
02:04:40,251 --> 02:04:41,960
It get that mind.
Ah,

2972
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:44,420
their head was next to his head.
You,

2973
02:04:44,421 --> 02:04:45,160
you,
he,

2974
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:47,100
his head would eclipse your head.
No.

2975
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:49,500
Yes it would.
It'd be nothing behind you.

2976
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:52,230
Look how long net hit his narrow,
his head got in front of you.

2977
02:04:52,231 --> 02:04:55,560
I wouldn't even know you're there by 
deals that you back there.

2978
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:59,420
I'd see the bottom.
I feel like I'm back.

2979
02:04:59,421 --> 02:05:01,880
You're jerking off with my nondominant 
hand brother.

2980
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:06,920
It doesn't count.
Did you think it's what?

2981
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:08,450
I bet if be crazy in this.
I know.

2982
02:05:08,451 --> 02:05:09,420
I don't know.
I'm thinking about this,

2983
02:05:09,421 --> 02:05:12,360
but to watch people from different,
uh,

2984
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:14,790
ethnicities jerk off,
you know,

2985
02:05:14,791 --> 02:05:17,700
back to this again.
But you know what I'm saying though,

2986
02:05:17,701 --> 02:05:20,100
because everybody probably should watch 
a little point and get the study.

2987
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:20,980
Man.
I'm not.

2988
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:24,900
Why you checking off from memory now a 
younger gal from memory now,

2989
02:05:25,650 --> 02:05:26,820
do you find that your,
um,

2990
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,410
fantasies become more elaborate?

2991
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:29,333
100%.
They're more excited it up and just set 

2992
02:05:31,171 --> 02:05:32,580
it up in your head?
Oh No.

2993
02:05:32,581 --> 02:05:37,480
It's how many days a week he'd beaten it
more than four.

2994
02:05:37,481 --> 02:05:39,060
And you got a problem?
No,

2995
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:42,810
two days a week.
And I'm disappointed at that.

2996
02:05:44,130 --> 02:05:45,770
I'm just trying to turn over a new leaf,
you know,

2997
02:05:46,890 --> 02:05:49,360
I want to not be morning some.
Yeah.

2998
02:05:49,361 --> 02:05:52,530
I want to be confused.
I think that's a,

2999
02:05:52,531 --> 02:05:54,230
that's look,
there's a [inaudible].

3000
02:05:54,490 --> 02:05:55,323
There's a,
if you just look at sexual desire and 

3001
02:05:58,561 --> 02:05:59,420
lust,
yeah,

3002
02:06:01,170 --> 02:06:04,920
there's a reason why you become more and
more desperate as time goes on.

3003
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:06,143
It's like your,
your sights are set too high or you're 

3004
02:06:08,581 --> 02:06:11,280
not being ambitious enough.
You got to spread your seed.

3005
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:12,413
If you think about how ridiculous it is 
that people didn't know that having sex 

3006
02:06:15,901 --> 02:06:18,140
with people has consequences.
Uh,

3007
02:06:18,380 --> 02:06:21,000
and,
and by that I mean you can get pregnant,

3008
02:06:21,001 --> 02:06:24,630
you can get diseases if there was no,
and it was cultural limitations,

3009
02:06:24,631 --> 02:06:25,470
people frown upon it.

3010
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:26,453
But if there was none of those,
and imagine how much people would be 

3011
02:06:28,291 --> 02:06:29,190
fucking,
oh yeah.

3012
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:31,700
It would be insane.
The,

3013
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:33,690
or if there was no such thing as 
masturbating,

3014
02:06:33,691 --> 02:06:35,460
you could forget a gas station.
People be fucking,

3015
02:06:35,461 --> 02:06:36,294
yeah.
If there was no such masturbation was 

3016
02:06:38,111 --> 02:06:39,510
impossible,
first of all,

3017
02:06:39,511 --> 02:06:43,980
you know what would happen?
What women would rule everything 100%,

3018
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:45,263
but it was the,
would have so much cheap built up in 

3019
02:06:46,591 --> 02:06:47,424
him.
Nope.

3020
02:06:47,730 --> 02:06:48,870
Nope.
That'd be bitches.

3021
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:51,000
They'd be given in every chance they 
could.

3022
02:06:51,001 --> 02:06:53,580
Cause the women would own it would be 
worth so much more.

3023
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:55,120
That's true.
Yeah.

3024
02:06:55,500 --> 02:06:57,660
Because women would be able to decide 
whether or not you came.

3025
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:00,390
There's the only way.
If that was the only way,

3026
02:07:00,990 --> 02:07:04,170
if women were the rulers and whether or 
not you came,

3027
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:05,790
if there was no way to come without 
them,

3028
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:07,050
oh my God,
they would dominate.

3029
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:09,450
We're fucked dude.
I know that's going to be the next law.

3030
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:10,313
If they're really smart.
That's how they would take over top our 

3031
02:07:13,591 --> 02:07:18,591
arms off
telling me though.

3032
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:25,260
You wouldn't watch like a little Chinese
guy jerk off from like 30 feet away.

3033
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:26,670
Back to this again.
No,

3034
02:07:26,671 --> 02:07:29,730
but just to train accidents.
I don't want them to happen.

3035
02:07:30,070 --> 02:07:31,990
But Jamie pulls up a video of a train 
accident.

3036
02:07:31,991 --> 02:07:33,420
Oh my God,
you got to see this one shit.

3037
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:35,740
Okay,
go ahead and watch it.

3038
02:07:35,820 --> 02:07:35,990
Oh,

3039
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:37,610
I don't watch that kind of stuff,
you know?

3040
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:40,090
But tell me about this.
How close do you get?

3041
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:42,370
Like there's a Chinese guy jerking off 
in a park.

3042
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:44,190
Okay.
And he's Ma,

3043
02:07:44,230 --> 02:07:46,630
he's depends on who I am.
He's Cantonese,

3044
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:48,160
Cantonese,
my me.

3045
02:07:48,161 --> 02:07:50,440
Right now you're you,
right now you're jogging,

3046
02:07:50,441 --> 02:07:51,370
right?
Jogging.

3047
02:07:51,450 --> 02:07:54,380
You guys beating off.
Depends on how close you see,

3048
02:07:54,410 --> 02:07:56,740
like you stopped to tie your shoe right 
and you see him in the park.

3049
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:57,191
You're like,
oh,

3050
02:07:57,191 --> 02:08:00,370
that guy's definitely beating off and 
you're about 200 yards away.

3051
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:02,860
I probably would stay there.
How close would you walk to it?

3052
02:08:02,861 --> 02:08:03,694
I don't know.
When someone's jerking off in public 

3053
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:06,143
[inaudible] sir,
you have an obligation to do one of two 

3054
02:08:07,481 --> 02:08:08,400
things.
You have an obligation.

3055
02:08:08,401 --> 02:08:10,780
It depends on what he's doing.
Is he looking at you and jerking off?

3056
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:12,400
He's looking at you and Jurgen off.

3057
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:15,010
If he's doing it out in the open,
he might be sick,

3058
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:17,620
but he's turned enough towards you that 
you're kind of invited I think.

3059
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:18,371
No,
no,

3060
02:08:18,371 --> 02:08:19,300
no.
Yeah,

3061
02:08:19,330 --> 02:08:21,070
you're right.
If you're in the park,

3062
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:24,430
this is just,
I mean,

3063
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:26,250
being 100% serious.
Yeah.

3064
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:27,890
If I'm running in the park,
okay,

3065
02:08:27,930 --> 02:08:28,990
I see,
you know,

3066
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:32,200
five yards over to the side,
right next to a tree.

3067
02:08:32,201 --> 02:08:33,820
There's a guy beaten off.
Okay,

3068
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:34,713
I'm going to stop running and I'm going 
to look at him and I'm going to look at 

3069
02:08:37,661 --> 02:08:38,494
all the people around him and I'm going 
to keep an eye on him and I'm probably 

3070
02:08:40,631 --> 02:08:41,464
either going to call the cops or I'm 
definitely gonna stand there because 

3071
02:08:44,711 --> 02:08:49,270
what if some person is jogging and he 
just decides this is the time to jump on

3072
02:08:49,271 --> 02:08:51,270
this person?
Yeah.

3073
02:08:51,370 --> 02:08:52,203
What if some kid is walking by and he 
snatches that kid and drags him in the 

3074
02:08:54,671 --> 02:08:55,060
bushes?

3075
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:55,893
This guy is so crazy.
He's beaten off in public and he's 

3076
02:08:58,061 --> 02:08:59,330
looking at you.
Yes,

3077
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:00,183
true.
I don't think I would go over and be 

3078
02:09:01,571 --> 02:09:02,404
violent with them,
but I would definitely keep an eye on 

3079
02:09:04,001 --> 02:09:04,960
him.
I'm not going to let,

3080
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:06,633
what if he's a fucking sexual Predator 
and he's looking to do something to 

3081
02:09:09,101 --> 02:09:12,430
someone and you could be like Peter 
Parker in Spiderman.

3082
02:09:12,460 --> 02:09:13,810
Save your uncle.
Yeah.

3083
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:14,681
Right.
You know,

3084
02:09:14,681 --> 02:09:16,690
that's what made Peter Parker became 
spiderman.

3085
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:18,100
He saved his uncle.
Well,

3086
02:09:18,101 --> 02:09:18,934
he had the power and he didn't save his 
uncle and a robber ran past him and he 

3087
02:09:22,121 --> 02:09:23,470
didn't feel he had to do anything about 
it.

3088
02:09:23,471 --> 02:09:25,630
And the robber got into the elevator and
he killed his uncle.

3089
02:09:25,950 --> 02:09:26,920
I didn't even know that.
Yeah,

3090
02:09:26,921 --> 02:09:27,660
that's just,
or no,

3091
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:30,550
it wasn't an elevator.
I forget what the actual story was,

3092
02:09:30,551 --> 02:09:34,180
but the Robert did something to his 
uncle and killed him.

3093
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:36,580
His uncle was everything to him.
His uncle took care of him.

3094
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:37,533
So then he decided he could never let 
evil people do anything bad again and 

3095
02:09:40,331 --> 02:09:42,340
they became spiderman.
I like that superhero.

3096
02:09:42,910 --> 02:09:43,760
I think,
uh,

3097
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:46,440
you have an obligation,
especially if you're,

3098
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:49,180
if you're a man,
especially,

3099
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:52,090
yeah.
If I was a small woman and I was in that

3100
02:09:52,091 --> 02:09:54,340
same situation,
I would say call the cops immediately.

3101
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:55,810
You know,
don't try to be a hero.

3102
02:09:56,170 --> 02:09:58,870
Get the fuck away from that guy,
but called the cops immediately.

3103
02:09:59,590 --> 02:10:04,420
But I'm pretty sure most dudes that are 
beaten off in the forest like that,

3104
02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:05,283
they're not looking for me.
Rather they're looking for a woman or a 

3105
02:10:08,261 --> 02:10:09,790
child.
Yeah,

3106
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:11,140
that's true.
They're probably not looking to meet.

3107
02:10:11,150 --> 02:10:11,983
Another would tell another dude.
If I saw another dude at grabbing out 

3108
02:10:14,041 --> 02:10:15,550
the dude for sure to help me,
like,

3109
02:10:15,551 --> 02:10:16,810
let's get this dude.
I'd be like,

3110
02:10:16,811 --> 02:10:17,171
Hey,
hey,

3111
02:10:17,171 --> 02:10:18,004
hey,
come here man.

3112
02:10:18,010 --> 02:10:20,260
This fucking guy is just beaten up 
scanner.

3113
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:23,350
And most men would be like,
oh Jesus,

3114
02:10:23,351 --> 02:10:24,940
what do we do?
We'll call the cops,

3115
02:10:25,030 --> 02:10:26,620
keep an eye on him.
I'm going to call the cops.

3116
02:10:26,890 --> 02:10:29,560
Don't let them get away.
Call Sony runs by.

3117
02:10:29,590 --> 02:10:31,030
Tell them to,
oh yeah,

3118
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:33,620
that's a c when someone's

3119
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:35,563
really crazy.
What's the ones really crazy like that 

3120
02:10:38,631 --> 02:10:41,930
kind of crazy like some guy got arrested
for trying to abduct the kid,

3121
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:44,930
trying to drag kid in his house and he 
had horns on his head.

3122
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:46,213
He's got horns,
he's a sexual Predator and he's got 

3123
02:10:47,751 --> 02:10:49,220
those,
those uh,

3124
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,113
implants in his head.
It looks like some kind of demon and is 

3125
02:10:53,330 --> 02:10:56,120
his ears hang down to like,
it's fucking chin.

3126
02:10:56,290 --> 02:10:57,600
Okay,
great.

3127
02:10:57,650 --> 02:10:59,690
That guy's out there.
That's a real guy.

3128
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:01,220
Just got caught.
Right?

3129
02:11:01,790 --> 02:11:04,320
So if you run into that sort of a 
situation,

3130
02:11:04,321 --> 02:11:06,440
you know,
like you have to add as a person,

3131
02:11:06,441 --> 02:11:09,520
you can't just run away.
I feel like you got to stand,

3132
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:11,690
you've got to stand around and make 
this,

3133
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:14,810
you know,
maybe make people aware of say,

3134
02:11:14,950 --> 02:11:15,783
Hey,
this guy's coming over trying to come 

3135
02:11:16,641 --> 02:11:19,340
over here,
or this guy is jerking off or yeah,

3136
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:19,640
yeah.

3137
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:20,473
I think getting somebody else to help,
but there's less of that than there's 

3138
02:11:23,481 --> 02:11:24,314
ever been before,
but there's always going to be some of 

3139
02:11:25,071 --> 02:11:25,904
it.
So if you were talking about with 

3140
02:11:26,451 --> 02:11:29,000
pedophiles,
like how do you stop that forever?

3141
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:31,850
How's that possible to stop that 
forever.

3142
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:33,690
And we had a dude in school when I was 
growing up,

3143
02:11:33,710 --> 02:11:35,660
this guy big Richard Wright,
and he ended up,

3144
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,260
I mean big Dick,
that's what you call them now.

3145
02:11:38,261 --> 02:11:38,991
This yet,
well,

3146
02:11:38,991 --> 02:11:41,720
we didn't know this was before.
We were old enough to know that Dick and

3147
02:11:41,721 --> 02:11:43,190
Richard were the same hour.
Dick,

3148
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:44,900
how about this?
How has Jack,

3149
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:48,500
John,
how was short for John Jack?

3150
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:49,730
Is it really?
Yeah,

3151
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:51,350
I didn't even know that.
JFK,

3152
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,240
John F.
Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy.

3153
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:55,670
Jack Kennedy.
Oh Wow.

3154
02:11:56,190 --> 02:11:58,580
I didn't know who Jack Kennedy was.
The fuck is that.

3155
02:11:58,790 --> 02:12:00,410
Yeah.
There's some other weird ones,

3156
02:12:00,411 --> 02:12:00,820
right?
Yeah.

3157
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:01,653
We're never going to get a universal 
language if we can't even get that 

3158
02:12:03,321 --> 02:12:03,620
right.

3159
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:05,650
It's from Iris.
It's how you say Jack and Irish.

3160
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:07,340
You got to look this up.
Really John,

3161
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:10,170
since their irs that it makes a whole 
lot more sense each other way.

3162
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:11,070
Say John.
I believe it.

3163
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:12,950
I guess if you said it fast and from far
away,

3164
02:12:12,951 --> 02:12:15,020
it could sound like Jack.
Yeah,

3165
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:19,280
come up short for Barbara is babs.
Yeah,

3166
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:22,660
I know a babs actually.
Is that my babs?

3167
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:24,110
That's weird.
Short for Barbara.

3168
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:27,890
Barb is a rough name though.
I think farm like a hook.

3169
02:12:28,370 --> 02:12:29,880
Yeah,
like and who wants to go weed?

3170
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:32,120
Fuck Barb.
Barb means cute barbies.

3171
02:12:32,121 --> 02:12:33,770
Key.
Huh?

3172
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:36,680
Sal is like a man's name,
but of a tour.

3173
02:12:37,070 --> 02:12:38,200
What?
That's a short for a while.

3174
02:12:38,201 --> 02:12:39,034
This other weird ones with men.
I know there's some other weird ones 

3175
02:12:40,701 --> 02:12:42,350
that I forget.
Big Sal.

3176
02:12:42,890 --> 02:12:44,720
I know a lesbian named big sale.
Whoa.

3177
02:12:45,110 --> 02:12:47,510
What's her real name?
Sally model now.

3178
02:12:47,570 --> 02:12:48,403
So I used to be called Sal,
but one time she bought a man's bathing 

3179
02:12:50,361 --> 02:12:51,194
suits and go swimming with us.
And I thought that was pretty 

3180
02:12:52,371 --> 02:12:55,640
impressive.
No top or top no top dad.

3181
02:12:55,641 --> 02:12:56,570
Hey,
let's go.

3182
02:12:56,571 --> 02:12:59,900
She's fucking selling.
And she was in the shallow end to Daddy,

3183
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:01,550
you know?
And that's a man.

3184
02:13:01,580 --> 02:13:04,220
That's a healthy gal.
But yeah,

3185
02:13:04,221 --> 02:13:06,470
I think if somebody,
I was in Germany one time,

3186
02:13:06,471 --> 02:13:07,304
I was on a bike ride and they had a man 
swinging his dick in a big circle and I 

3187
02:13:10,011 --> 02:13:13,700
thought that that was,
but it was a nudist area of a park.

3188
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:16,130
Well,
if you've got a new this area,

3189
02:13:16,131 --> 02:13:18,680
that's what you're going to encounter.
People swinging dicks.

3190
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:19,850
Yeah.
I guess I was kind of,

3191
02:13:19,851 --> 02:13:21,660
I was just sped off,
Eh,

3192
02:13:23,390 --> 02:13:24,590
uh,
you know,

3193
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:27,980
I think about it sometimes about big 
sal.

3194
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:30,230
Nope.
It's about that guy in the park and what

3195
02:13:30,231 --> 02:13:31,470
he was doing.
Why he's doing that.

3196
02:13:32,670 --> 02:13:34,650
You know what I used to think?
I used to think,

3197
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:37,380
oh,
look at that piece of shit now I think,

3198
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:38,940
oh,
that was a baby.

3199
02:13:39,250 --> 02:13:39,630
Yeah,

3200
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:40,463
right.
That was a baby that night became this 

3201
02:13:41,761 --> 02:13:43,890
helicopter Dick Weirdo.
What?

3202
02:13:43,891 --> 02:13:46,800
Standing on the street pointing to his 
hog,

3203
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:52,070
spinning around spinning like that.
It's fucking weird and crazy.

3204
02:13:53,610 --> 02:13:56,340
It's fucking weird.
It's weird that there are people that do

3205
02:13:56,341 --> 02:13:57,174
that.
And how much of that is because of 

3206
02:13:58,630 --> 02:13:59,463
repression like that would,
if you went to the most sexually 

3207
02:14:02,131 --> 02:14:05,580
liberated country,
they have more or less perversion.

3208
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:07,320
That's the question.
Right.

3209
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:08,183
And how much of it is important?
Like if you went to the most sexually 

3210
02:14:10,711 --> 02:14:11,710
liberated place,
like

3211
02:14:12,620 --> 02:14:13,100
yeah.

3212
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:13,933
And how many of the people that come in 
or people from out of town that are 

3213
02:14:17,091 --> 02:14:19,460
weird that want freaky shit and then it 
becomes an economy.

3214
02:14:19,610 --> 02:14:20,443
Yeah.
And how many people did you just leave 

3215
02:14:21,351 --> 02:14:24,280
them to their own?
Just be chill.

3216
02:14:24,340 --> 02:14:26,110
Yeah.
Cause we're pretty caged up.

3217
02:14:26,111 --> 02:14:28,390
They say here in America it's pretty,
you know,

3218
02:14:28,391 --> 02:14:29,224
everything's kind of taboo and you can't
see nipples and stuff on television and 

3219
02:14:32,650 --> 02:14:33,281
yeah,
it's weird.

3220
02:14:33,281 --> 02:14:33,900
But

3221
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:34,230
yeah,

3222
02:14:34,230 --> 02:14:36,750
I wonder if that's also why we get so 
much done.

3223
02:14:37,230 --> 02:14:38,370
Yeah.
You know,

3224
02:14:38,371 --> 02:14:39,090
like,
uh,

3225
02:14:39,090 --> 02:14:40,050
do we,
I mean,

3226
02:14:40,051 --> 02:14:40,884
maybe it's just,
maybe it's my perception that we get 

3227
02:14:42,691 --> 02:14:44,730
more done than other that were more 
productive.

3228
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:46,140
I mean,
it's,

3229
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:48,300
I think we focus on it a lot.
Yeah.

3230
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:50,310
A lot of things have definitely come 
from here,

3231
02:14:50,770 --> 02:14:52,050
but I think that's changing,
right?

3232
02:14:52,410 --> 02:14:53,243
Yeah.
But I think pedophile is going out of 

3233
02:14:54,691 --> 02:14:55,524
style too.
I think there was a time where more 

3234
02:14:57,690 --> 02:14:59,610
people got away with it easier,
that's for sure.

3235
02:14:59,670 --> 02:15:00,960
Yeah.
It's hard to get away with it,

3236
02:15:00,961 --> 02:15:02,460
but God,
that fucking,

3237
02:15:02,490 --> 02:15:06,120
that whatever that is,
that makes a person do that just doesn't

3238
02:15:06,121 --> 02:15:10,310
seem like we've eradicated that.
It must just be a loose wire.

3239
02:15:10,311 --> 02:15:11,144
And I'm,
I imagine that the thing about that is 

3240
02:15:12,890 --> 02:15:17,890
if they could one day figure out a way 
to get certain traits and breed them out

3241
02:15:18,801 --> 02:15:21,350
of people or engineered them out of 
people,

3242
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:24,420
like we're fucked then.
Well what,

3243
02:15:24,590 --> 02:15:26,750
what,
what would you leave in?

3244
02:15:27,170 --> 02:15:27,460
Yeah.

3245
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:28,860
Like what,
what'd you leave in?

3246
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:29,430
Yeah.

3247
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:30,263
Emotional outbursts.
Would you leave in the ability to have 

3248
02:15:32,371 --> 02:15:34,860
an emotional outburst?
Like what the fuck?

3249
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:35,723
Yeah,
I would leave that.

3250
02:15:35,730 --> 02:15:36,990
What'd you leave that in?
That's fun.

3251
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:38,070
Yeah.
It's fun for me.

3252
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:41,130
But maybe you and I wouldn't be the ones
who decide.

3253
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:43,350
Would you leave sneezing in?
No.

3254
02:15:43,351 --> 02:15:47,520
I mean behavior,
male emotional outbursts.

3255
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:49,830
Okay.
Like fucking cunts.

3256
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:51,440
Yeah.
Real fucking assholes.

3257
02:15:51,450 --> 02:15:53,190
Like that kind of shit.
That kind of shit.

3258
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:54,210
Yes.
I would leave that in.

3259
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:56,100
I will leave that into not a lot of it 
though.

3260
02:15:56,101 --> 02:15:58,020
I turned it down a little.
I wouldn't fuck with it.

3261
02:15:58,260 --> 02:15:59,610
I don't think it's our job to fuck with 
it.

3262
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:02,100
Okay.
Cause you need that if a war breaks out,

3263
02:16:02,250 --> 02:16:02,881
right?
Yeah.

3264
02:16:02,881 --> 02:16:06,120
You can't have beat some guys like,
oh you don't need that and going to war.

3265
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:07,013
Yeah.
You're going to need that energy you're 

3266
02:16:07,651 --> 02:16:08,484
going to need,
it was like that whole like male 

3267
02:16:10,021 --> 02:16:13,860
eruption fucking crazed aggression that 
you don't like.

3268
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:15,053
Well,
when an invading village is headed over 

3269
02:16:17,281 --> 02:16:20,220
the top of the hill,
you want that in a dude with an ax.

3270
02:16:20,221 --> 02:16:21,240
Yeah.
You want that.

3271
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:23,410
You want that to be available.
Yeah,

3272
02:16:23,411 --> 02:16:24,244
I agree.
Unless we get to a point where we don't 

3273
02:16:25,231 --> 02:16:27,720
have any war anywhere ever again,

3274
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:30,750
but until then,
like what?

3275
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:33,610
But what if we engineer it out,
but the Russians say they're going to,

3276
02:16:33,611 --> 02:16:34,444
but they don't.
They don't.

3277
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:37,390
They would do that probably.
We would do that also.

3278
02:16:37,570 --> 02:16:39,490
We would definitely do are so fucking 
sneaky.

3279
02:16:39,580 --> 02:16:41,320
Do you think that we will have another 
war?

3280
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:45,300
I hope not,
but that's always the fear,

3281
02:16:45,301 --> 02:16:45,751
right?
I mean,

3282
02:16:45,751 --> 02:16:48,900
we're in the middle of two right now.
You know,

3283
02:16:49,380 --> 02:16:50,213
I think there could be,
you think there could ever be another 

3284
02:16:50,911 --> 02:16:55,230
state warrant in America of the civil 
war states?

3285
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:57,660
Well,
some people were worried about that.

3286
02:16:57,750 --> 02:17:00,840
Some people state government,
some people want state run government.

3287
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:01,913
Well,
some people were worried about that as 

3288
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:08,700
hate for the Republicans and hate for 
trump in particular,

3289
02:17:08,701 --> 02:17:09,534
ramps up and that they're really worried
that there'll be some sort of a violent 

3290
02:17:13,770 --> 02:17:14,603
outbreak between the right and the left 
and that this could actually really 

3291
02:17:17,611 --> 02:17:19,860
happen.
Man,

3292
02:17:21,150 --> 02:17:21,983
it's not impossible.
It's not impossible that at least 

3293
02:17:23,701 --> 02:17:27,330
battles could break out because people 
are fucking polarized,

3294
02:17:27,331 --> 02:17:28,080
Matt.
Yeah.

3295
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:28,913
Yeah.
But I think what's interesting to me is 

3296
02:17:30,751 --> 02:17:33,420
that more and more people,
it seems like,

3297
02:17:33,421 --> 02:17:35,610
at least from my perspective on the 
right,

3298
02:17:35,970 --> 02:17:37,560
are now coming out against trump.

3299
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:39,990
It seems more common,
more common,

3300
02:17:39,991 --> 02:17:41,540
especially with this government 
shutdown.

3301
02:17:41,610 --> 02:17:43,980
People like what the fuck?
You know?

3302
02:17:44,010 --> 02:17:46,710
There's so many videos of people going,
what are you talking about?

3303
02:17:46,711 --> 02:17:47,544
What this wall like?
We need money like people or government 

3304
02:17:50,071 --> 02:17:51,900
people.
A lot of them are living check to check.

3305
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:53,153
You're shutting down there,
but this is the only way you can 

3306
02:17:54,271 --> 02:17:55,104
negotiate this wall.
Does the only way you can fund this 

3307
02:17:56,761 --> 02:17:57,870
wall.
This is crazy.

3308
02:17:58,560 --> 02:18:00,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

3309
02:18:00,121 --> 02:18:01,860
I mean it's,
I don't know.

3310
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:04,260
I mean,
people always say the government sucks.

3311
02:18:04,261 --> 02:18:05,940
Fucking shut it down and then it shuts 
down.

3312
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:07,530
Everybody gets mad.
You know?

3313
02:18:07,590 --> 02:18:08,423
It's like,
it's makes an argument that the 

3314
02:18:10,021 --> 02:18:13,230
government should be doing less things.
This is the real argument.

3315
02:18:13,350 --> 02:18:16,650
The argument is some of those things 
that the government does.

3316
02:18:16,890 --> 02:18:20,670
Why does the government have to do it?
Why can't it be privatized?

3317
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:23,310
Why?
Why can't it become a business?

3318
02:18:23,490 --> 02:18:24,323
It would probably run better if some of 
those things we're not run by the 

3319
02:18:27,301 --> 02:18:28,134
government like airport security or like
road maintenance or like a lot of other 

3320
02:18:33,001 --> 02:18:35,340
things like don't have the government do
it,

3321
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:38,190
have private contractors do it.
Cause I'm read,

3322
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:42,630
okay.
Strong standards and strong competition.

3323
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:48,200
And a John Stossel actually has a video 
about it right now.

3324
02:18:49,250 --> 02:18:52,080
Um,
it's on his a twitter page.

3325
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:55,260
It's a long video.
But explaining how,

3326
02:18:55,261 --> 02:18:56,094
one of the things people were realizing 
from this government shutdown is that 

3327
02:18:59,761 --> 02:19:02,160
the government does a lot of things that
they don't have to do.

3328
02:19:02,220 --> 02:19:03,053
Yeah.
It would be probably better for 

3329
02:19:03,781 --> 02:19:07,080
everybody if some of these things were 
streamlined.

3330
02:19:07,081 --> 02:19:10,830
Some of these things were done by the 
private sector.

3331
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:13,173
I don't think that's a bad idea.
I think there's a lot of things that 

3332
02:19:14,831 --> 02:19:15,664
could be done better if there was 
competition as soon as the government 

3333
02:19:17,921 --> 02:19:20,380
controls certain businesses.
I mean,

3334
02:19:20,381 --> 02:19:22,450
maybe they do it really well and maybe 
they don't.

3335
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:23,760
You know,
I think the,

3336
02:19:23,860 --> 02:19:25,660
I think there's certain things that 
were,

3337
02:19:25,670 --> 02:19:30,530
socialism works really well.
Like here's one fire department.

3338
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:33,320
Fucking,
you gotta pay for the Fire Department.

3339
02:19:33,321 --> 02:19:34,970
Everybody wants to fund the fire 
department.

3340
02:19:34,971 --> 02:19:39,110
Don't you cut the fire budget man.
What if my granny house?

3341
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:40,580
Yeah.
And we once fire,

3342
02:19:40,581 --> 02:19:42,410
man,
we got to pay for the fire department.

3343
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:44,690
Pay For that shit.
Pay for the police.

3344
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:45,230
Yup.
Pay.

3345
02:19:45,230 --> 02:19:48,080
And everybody says pay you shouldn't be 
rich.

3346
02:19:48,081 --> 02:19:50,240
People only get cops and poor people 
don't get comps.

3347
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:52,550
That's crazy.
Everyone would say that's crazy.

3348
02:19:52,551 --> 02:19:53,384
Yeah.
Right.

3349
02:19:53,510 --> 02:19:55,910
Well why is that not the case with 
education to them?

3350
02:19:56,060 --> 02:19:57,290
Well,
right.

3351
02:19:57,470 --> 02:19:58,303
Don't you want people to learn things,
but when did education becomes such a 

3352
02:20:00,711 --> 02:20:02,300
big business?
Why is that a business?

3353
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:05,830
It should be our goal as patriots.
Right?

3354
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:08,390
To make less losers,
more happy,

3355
02:20:08,391 --> 02:20:10,610
successful people.
More aware people,

3356
02:20:10,611 --> 02:20:12,870
more educated people,
you know.

3357
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:13,753
But instead it's like subsidized by the 
government and that makes it even 

3358
02:20:16,731 --> 02:20:17,564
weirder.
And then you have student loans you 

3359
02:20:18,591 --> 02:20:19,430
can't escape.

3360
02:20:20,110 --> 02:20:21,550
Yeah.
A lot of that is pretty bizarre,

3361
02:20:21,610 --> 02:20:22,301
dude.
It's bizarre.

3362
02:20:22,301 --> 02:20:24,190
It's fuck,
it should be free.

3363
02:20:24,250 --> 02:20:26,000
But there's also like,
there's another like a lot,

3364
02:20:26,020 --> 02:20:29,110
some people don't want to do anything.
They just true want to be alive and they

3365
02:20:29,111 --> 02:20:30,610
just,
they just,

3366
02:20:30,670 --> 02:20:31,503
they don't want to contribute and really
have any sort of life and they have no 

3367
02:20:35,231 --> 02:20:36,064
desire for that.
And there's generation and generation 

3368
02:20:37,961 --> 02:20:38,794
and generation of them

3369
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:42,860
dead is true.
But what if you ever,

3370
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:44,870
do you ever look at universal basic 
income?

3371
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:46,423
It's a weird idea.
I flatly rejected it when I first heard 

3372
02:20:49,851 --> 02:20:50,684
it.
We have it.

3373
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:51,830
No,
we don't have it.

3374
02:20:51,950 --> 02:20:53,570
They've tried it out in a couple of 
places,

3375
02:20:53,571 --> 02:20:55,010
but I don't think it's really worked out
that well.

3376
02:20:55,011 --> 02:20:59,120
But the idea behind it,
I'm having a guy who comes on soon,

3377
02:20:59,121 --> 02:20:59,954
his name is Andrew Yang.
[inaudible] is a proponent of universal 

3378
02:21:02,121 --> 02:21:04,970
basic income.
And the idea is you give people x amount

3379
02:21:04,971 --> 02:21:05,804
of dollars per month,
whether it's $1,000 per month and 

3380
02:21:07,311 --> 02:21:11,900
everybody gets it no matter what.
And by doing that,

3381
02:21:11,901 --> 02:21:15,710
you take care of all of the burden of 
survival.

3382
02:21:16,310 --> 02:21:19,520
Like we take care of everyone in the 
civilization.

3383
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:21,800
Everyone gets food,
everyone gets shelter.

3384
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:26,030
So that eliminates a lot of crime and a 
lot of strife just right away,

3385
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:26,250
right.

3386
02:21:26,250 --> 02:21:28,490
Questions are laid back.
Where's all that money come from?

3387
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:33,520
There's $1,000 a month.
308 million.

3388
02:21:34,401 --> 02:21:36,020
Is that what it was?
Plus,

3389
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:39,290
you know that was 2010 it's probably 
more now let's slate.

3390
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:41,930
Let's say three 20 that is a lot of 
money.

3391
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:47,290
320 million thousand.
So that's 320 billion.

3392
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:49,850
Gee,
isn't that what it is?

3393
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:50,743
I have no clue.
320 billion a month when that would be 

3394
02:21:54,290 --> 02:21:55,123
the,
if you gave a thousand people $1 

3395
02:21:57,770 --> 02:21:58,760
million,
isn't that what it would be?

3396
02:21:58,820 --> 02:22:00,560
A thousand million is a billion,
right?

3397
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:03,950
Just do it in the calculator,
Bro.

3398
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:06,370
Don't do it in your head.
1,000.

3399
02:22:06,380 --> 02:22:07,190
1 million.
Yeah.

3400
02:22:07,190 --> 02:22:09,500
So that's right.
So it must be so that,

3401
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:12,170
that's so much money.
So three.

3402
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:13,490
So the,
the wall,

3403
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:16,430
like him talking about building a wall,
isn't he asking for 5 billion?

3404
02:22:16,870 --> 02:22:18,210
Five Bill.
Okay.

3405
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:19,550
It's not that much,
I don't think.

3406
02:22:19,610 --> 02:22:21,200
Well,
that's to build a wall once.

3407
02:22:21,410 --> 02:22:26,010
This is every month you would need all 
those billions.

3408
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:30,410
That's all a lot of fucking shut up.
And so that means everybody would be,

3409
02:22:30,450 --> 02:22:31,880
have their basic needs met.
Yes.

3410
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:34,230
Everybody get a thousand bucks where 
that money comes from.

3411
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:35,940
This is what I need to talk to this guy 
about.

3412
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:38,970
Obviously I'm not a mathematician or any
sort of an economist,

3413
02:22:38,971 --> 02:22:42,710
so I don't have any idea what they've,
how they feel like they can do this 3000

3414
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:45,600
it got that 3000 or more every adult in 
the country.

3415
02:22:46,570 --> 02:22:48,820
That's a lot to stipend of two 50 a 
month.

3416
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:51,220
Is that Andrew Yang?
It's not from him specifically,

3417
02:22:51,221 --> 02:22:54,370
but it's a different guy from like a guy
that was talking bad about it actually.

3418
02:22:54,371 --> 02:22:55,930
He was just giving you what people were

3419
02:22:56,410 --> 02:22:58,670
someone talking,
talking,

3420
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:00,310
talking bad about it.
Well,

3421
02:23:00,311 --> 02:23:01,400
yeah.
3000 a month.

3422
02:23:01,401 --> 02:23:02,234
There's a lot.
Yeah.

3423
02:23:02,740 --> 02:23:04,270
That's crazy.
That's almost,

3424
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:06,640
that's crazy.
But yeah,

3425
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:08,890
$36,000 a year.
That's,

3426
02:23:09,330 --> 02:23:12,610
I mean that would be nice.
Right then you'd be in the top 1% of the

3427
02:23:12,611 --> 02:23:16,030
world.
Everybody over 34 30 30 to 40,000 yeah,

3428
02:23:16,031 --> 02:23:16,864
$34,000 I think is 1% of the was it 
would cut the nations poverty rate in 

3429
02:23:19,841 --> 02:23:20,720
half.
Yeah.

3430
02:23:21,130 --> 02:23:21,963
But where's the money coming from?
And also do you lose incentive at that 

3431
02:23:26,081 --> 02:23:27,580
point?
That's a good question.

3432
02:23:27,970 --> 02:23:30,340
Is that bad?
Is it bad to lose incentive?

3433
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:31,193
Yes.
Why?

3434
02:23:31,450 --> 02:23:35,820
Because that's what it's like the drive.
It's the only reason otherwise you,

3435
02:23:35,890 --> 02:23:37,840
nobody ever comes anything.
Nobody achieved.

3436
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:39,310
There's no,
is that true?

3437
02:23:39,880 --> 02:23:41,440
Is it,
is the drive,

3438
02:23:41,441 --> 02:23:42,274
does the drive always have to be for 
survival or can the drive be the drive 

3439
02:23:47,291 --> 02:23:48,700
to succeed and better yourself?

3440
02:23:48,850 --> 02:23:50,590
So say,
look at it this way.

3441
02:23:51,190 --> 02:23:54,880
If you have $35,000 a year,
would you think you'd be cool?

3442
02:23:55,270 --> 02:23:56,620
You'd be like,
I don't need a tour.

3443
02:23:56,770 --> 02:23:58,190
I got 35 grand coming.
No,

3444
02:23:58,191 --> 02:23:59,650
I'd want to work harder.
Right.

3445
02:24:00,190 --> 02:24:01,023
I think a lot of people would want to 
work harder because I think your 

3446
02:24:02,591 --> 02:24:03,424
motivation would be different.
Your motivation would be to do better 

3447
02:24:05,861 --> 02:24:10,210
than $35,000 but that $35,000 would take
care of you.

3448
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:11,193
Look,
if money was free and economy didn't 

3449
02:24:12,701 --> 02:24:14,830
make any sense and you could just fix it
like that,

3450
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:15,641
I would say,
yeah,

3451
02:24:15,641 --> 02:24:16,710
fix it like that.
Right?

3452
02:24:16,711 --> 02:24:18,790
Where the fuck is all that money come 
from.

3453
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:21,220
That's a crazy amount of money.
We couldn't do it.

3454
02:24:21,221 --> 02:24:23,160
We can,
I mean no,

3455
02:24:23,170 --> 02:24:26,050
and that means a lot of Richard would 
have to give up some of their money.

3456
02:24:26,051 --> 02:24:31,051
People aren't doing all of that too.
That would be $900 billion every month.

3457
02:24:32,990 --> 02:24:33,640
Yeah.
Right.

3458
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:35,500
We see when that am I right about that

3459
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:38,030
300 billion.
It's for every adult.

3460
02:24:38,031 --> 02:24:40,540
It's not to give it to every person.
Oh,

3461
02:24:40,700 --> 02:24:41,533
oh,
okay.

3462
02:24:41,660 --> 02:24:43,790
Every adult.
Oh don't have to raise your kids.

3463
02:24:44,090 --> 02:24:45,350
They get the money.
Fuck it.

3464
02:24:45,410 --> 02:24:48,020
They get a car.
3000 no bills.

3465
02:24:48,110 --> 02:24:49,400
That's true.
That's true.

3466
02:24:49,401 --> 02:24:51,680
So how many people were dealing with,
how many people are adults?

3467
02:24:51,710 --> 02:24:52,543
It changes too.
I,

3468
02:24:52,630 --> 02:24:56,960
this is the argument they make does that
you would end some of the subsidies that

3469
02:24:56,961 --> 02:24:57,794
are already going on like Medicare and 
some social security and maybe welfare 

3470
02:25:00,471 --> 02:25:01,304
in some cases because people would have 
money that they're spending or they're 

3471
02:25:04,401 --> 02:25:05,660
getting now.
So that money,

3472
02:25:05,710 --> 02:25:06,543
like,
I don't know,

3473
02:25:07,610 --> 02:25:07,810
I

3474
02:25:07,810 --> 02:25:11,760
think it'd be worth a shot.
But how long do you try to make,

3475
02:25:11,761 --> 02:25:13,200
you know,
cause then people are going to be like,

3476
02:25:13,210 --> 02:25:16,740
I needed more time in a right.
Well that would be,

3477
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:18,780
they wouldn't ever get their shit 
together.

3478
02:25:18,810 --> 02:25:20,610
There's some people that will definitely
do that.

3479
02:25:20,790 --> 02:25:21,623
There's some people that will never get 
their shit together and I don't believe 

3480
02:25:25,361 --> 02:25:26,194
that this is a simulation.
I don't believe that that were in some 

3481
02:25:27,731 --> 02:25:28,564
sort of a video game,
but if we're in something that was low 

3482
02:25:30,310 --> 02:25:32,140
that you would,
it was a learning environment.

3483
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:33,573
You would want both to have your own 
opportunities for failure and to see 

3484
02:25:36,911 --> 02:25:40,030
examples of failure around you.
You would want to see that.

3485
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:41,103
Like I'm not happy that Artie Lange that
his nose is caved in and then he's got 

3486
02:25:46,300 --> 02:25:48,460
all these problems with drugs.
I'm not happy with that.

3487
02:25:48,461 --> 02:25:50,800
I love already laying and Artie Lange to
be clean.

3488
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:53,080
I think he's hilarious.
I think he's a great guy.

3489
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:54,723
The one thing that could be good that 
comes out of that for anyone other than 

3490
02:25:59,621 --> 02:26:00,454
already lang and Artie Lang's loved ones
and friends is someone that's just 

3491
02:26:03,821 --> 02:26:07,080
looking at him online and sees what he's
done and goes,

3492
02:26:07,130 --> 02:26:07,963
fuck that inspiration.
I don't want to ruin this guy's in and 

3493
02:26:10,091 --> 02:26:12,490
out of court.
He's always getting arrested.

3494
02:26:12,670 --> 02:26:15,130
He keeps pissing hot.
They kind of cheesy.

3495
02:26:15,220 --> 02:26:17,550
I was reading something today.
Well the thing is that it's,

3496
02:26:17,820 --> 02:26:19,420
it's,
it's sad,

3497
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:22,640
it's sad and people love the guy and 
you,

3498
02:26:22,641 --> 02:26:25,750
you see this is dangerous.
Drugs are dangerous.

3499
02:26:25,870 --> 02:26:26,703
Some people it hits them this way and 
for whatever host of factors are these 

3500
02:26:32,261 --> 02:26:33,340
got it bad,
right?

3501
02:26:33,341 --> 02:26:34,174
We love already.
So someone on the outside seeing that 

3502
02:26:36,251 --> 02:26:37,084
could be like wow.
And that now is a thought in their head 

3503
02:26:40,450 --> 02:26:42,310
if somebody offers them those same 
trucks,

3504
02:26:42,330 --> 02:26:42,790
right?

3505
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:47,770
And so I don't need to make my life hit,
hit rock bottom.

3506
02:26:48,100 --> 02:26:48,933
I can look at this guy or that guy or 
maybe someone in the neighborhood or 

3507
02:26:52,181 --> 02:26:54,250
people around you that don't get their 
shit together.

3508
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:55,203
You could see what happens when they 
don't chase their dreams and follow 

3509
02:26:57,971 --> 02:26:59,260
their ambitions.
They don't.

3510
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:00,993
They don't take the time to let the 
people around them know that they loved 

3511
02:27:04,571 --> 02:27:05,404
them.
They don't do those things and you get 

3512
02:27:06,131 --> 02:27:06,964
to see that.
That's a little bit of your own 

3513
02:27:08,441 --> 02:27:10,570
education too.
It's not ideal.

3514
02:27:10,690 --> 02:27:11,523
Right.
Ideal would be everybody is doing great 

3515
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:17,500
and we would all have this big old 
fucking happy community,

3516
02:27:18,010 --> 02:27:19,780
but yeah,
some education comes from that.

3517
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:22,210
You get education from that and also,
but do you start to,

3518
02:27:22,211 --> 02:27:26,460
even specifically with already lang,
do you ever think that when that started

3519
02:27:26,461 --> 02:27:29,290
to become such a big part of his life 
that I like,

3520
02:27:29,291 --> 02:27:33,010
I've worried that that I wonder will it,
does he,

3521
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:34,113
is he going to fault her with drugs and 
stuff because it keeps his name in 

3522
02:27:38,231 --> 02:27:39,070
people's minds?

3523
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:40,120
No,
I don't think so.

3524
02:27:40,430 --> 02:27:42,160
I don't think,
I wouldn't think people was,

3525
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:46,840
he was always a successful guy anyway.
When I met him,

3526
02:27:46,841 --> 02:27:47,674
he was on mad TV.
I met him in 1994 the same time I met 

3527
02:27:50,411 --> 02:27:54,550
Collin I became friends with already.
We did a scene together where I played a

3528
02:27:54,551 --> 02:27:59,050
boxer and he was a boxing manager.
I didn't even know that.

3529
02:27:59,051 --> 02:28:01,360
I didn't know he did that Shell.
Yeah man.

3530
02:28:01,361 --> 02:28:03,820
It's probably online somewhere.
It's wow.

3531
02:28:03,821 --> 02:28:05,770
He looks so young.
I was like,

3532
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:09,700
I think I was 27.
Wow.

3533
02:28:09,730 --> 02:28:10,840
Yeah.
And he was,

3534
02:28:10,841 --> 02:28:12,640
uh,
probably the same age as me.

3535
02:28:12,641 --> 02:28:15,180
We're real close as well as Callan.
Callan is just a,

3536
02:28:15,970 --> 02:28:19,200
that's me right there.
That is crazy.

3537
02:28:19,201 --> 02:28:20,410
As a boxer.
Yeah.

3538
02:28:21,710 --> 02:28:22,160
Dude,
that

3539
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:24,600
is crazy.
It's a joke.

3540
02:28:24,601 --> 02:28:26,060
Get Yard.
Come on.

3541
02:28:26,061 --> 02:28:28,220
I can't see that on my shoulder,
so.

3542
02:28:28,221 --> 02:28:30,070
Huh.
Thank you.

3543
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:31,640
Cause it wasn't few old and never got 
this.

3544
02:28:31,650 --> 02:28:32,483
Fuck God damn atrocious.
What does it feel like to look at your 

3545
02:28:35,571 --> 02:28:37,070
young body like that?
Weird.

3546
02:28:37,250 --> 02:28:38,330
Is it?
Yeah,

3547
02:28:38,570 --> 02:28:40,460
it's weird.
It's like a different person.

3548
02:28:40,580 --> 02:28:41,540
Yeah,
it doesn't,

3549
02:28:41,610 --> 02:28:43,880
it doesn't feel like it was me.
Yeah,

3550
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:46,640
yeah,
yeah.

3551
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:48,680
Well you,
you look at yourself,

3552
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:51,050
you know from the past.
Fuck Bro.

3553
02:28:52,030 --> 02:28:52,863
Already handsome guy.
Even already fucking handsome and did I 

3554
02:28:55,251 --> 02:28:56,900
had hair,
all that hair.

3555
02:28:57,140 --> 02:28:59,530
It's kind of an illusion was it,
you know,

3556
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:01,670
it was falling out.
It was definitely on the way.

3557
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:03,950
Did you know you were going to lose your
hair?

3558
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:06,410
Terrified.
Yeah.

3559
02:29:07,130 --> 02:29:09,200
It's weird seeing my body would know 
tattoos too.

3560
02:29:10,010 --> 02:29:10,940
Oh,
that's interesting.

3561
02:29:10,941 --> 02:29:14,720
I bet that wasn't even like a 
weightlifting days.

3562
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:16,340
That was all martial arts days.

3563
02:29:16,460 --> 02:29:19,580
Dang Bro.
Strange.

3564
02:29:20,970 --> 02:29:21,803
But yeah,
the first time I ever heard it already 

3565
02:29:22,870 --> 02:29:25,430
was just through a drug.
So maybe my perception of that is that,

3566
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:27,740
you know,
well already,

3567
02:29:27,741 --> 02:29:29,690
um,
you know,

3568
02:29:29,691 --> 02:29:31,820
he was a very successful comedian for 
sure,

3569
02:29:31,821 --> 02:29:35,780
from the Howard stern show,
from doing dirty work that norm McDonald

3570
02:29:35,781 --> 02:29:38,540
movie and a bunch of other things,
mad tv,

3571
02:29:38,541 --> 02:29:39,374
so many different things that he did.
He was always very successful and very 

3572
02:29:41,631 --> 02:29:44,330
well liked in the comedy world.
If you don't like,

3573
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:46,820
like if someone says fuck already line,
you'd be like,

3574
02:29:46,821 --> 02:29:48,550
why?
It's really cool.

3575
02:29:48,551 --> 02:29:51,620
Fuck are you what you don't like rd.
Yeah,

3576
02:29:51,621 --> 02:29:53,570
that's wrong.
He's the nicest guy ever.

3577
02:29:54,050 --> 02:29:55,580
It's just one of those things,
man.

3578
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:59,240
You don't want to see it go down like 
that.

3579
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:01,340
You don't want to,
but you learn from it.

3580
02:30:01,341 --> 02:30:02,174
Yeah.
Other people learn from the people do 

3581
02:30:02,841 --> 02:30:03,410
learn from it.

3582
02:30:03,410 --> 02:30:06,710
Other people learn from all kinds of 
things that people do wrong.

3583
02:30:07,220 --> 02:30:09,050
You know,
you don't want those things to happen.

3584
02:30:09,051 --> 02:30:11,150
But man,
they're educational for all of us.

3585
02:30:11,151 --> 02:30:14,360
We're all in this constant state of 
evolving this,

3586
02:30:14,361 --> 02:30:18,890
this culture that we're in right now.
The civilization is rapidly changing.

3587
02:30:18,891 --> 02:30:21,200
Everything is shifting and moving and 
growing.

3588
02:30:21,620 --> 02:30:23,810
It's out of control man.
I mean it really is.

3589
02:30:23,930 --> 02:30:25,760
I went to a lot of elements even like,
um,

3590
02:30:25,970 --> 02:30:29,180
I was listening to when you and Bill 
Berg were talking last time,

3591
02:30:29,181 --> 02:30:31,310
he's done what he's talking about like 
flying around and stuff like that.

3592
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:33,620
And then he was talking about doing a 
comedy special and he's like,

3593
02:30:33,621 --> 02:30:35,150
I don't even know what to do with it 
these days.

3594
02:30:35,151 --> 02:30:37,370
Do I just do clips?
Do I put it like,

3595
02:30:37,930 --> 02:30:39,620
yeah,
things just change so fast.

3596
02:30:39,621 --> 02:30:41,510
Whereas like a year ago or two years ago
have been like,

3597
02:30:41,511 --> 02:30:42,940
oh this is exactly what you do.

3598
02:30:42,960 --> 02:30:44,000
Make a special.
It's like,

3599
02:30:44,001 --> 02:30:46,370
no,
it's like do I well used to be,

3600
02:30:46,371 --> 02:30:47,970
you didn't have an option.
You know,

3601
02:30:47,990 --> 02:30:51,350
the first guy who actually introduced it
as an option was Louie,

3602
02:30:51,650 --> 02:30:55,580
cause Louis decided to put a special on 
his website and you buy it for like five

3603
02:30:55,581 --> 02:30:56,414
bucks,
which is a really reasonable amount and 

3604
02:30:58,791 --> 02:31:01,100
it was a really good special and it 
killed.

3605
02:31:01,130 --> 02:31:02,780
He made a shit ton of money,
right?

3606
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:03,793
And then people realized that he made a 
shit ton of money and then people 

3607
02:31:06,501 --> 02:31:07,334
realize how good he was and then people 
realize how famous he really actually 

3608
02:31:09,591 --> 02:31:10,424
was.
And then everything started booming and 

3609
02:31:11,601 --> 02:31:12,434
taking off for him.
I mean it was already in the process of 

3610
02:31:14,031 --> 02:31:16,040
happening,
but it happened even more because he did

3611
02:31:16,041 --> 02:31:18,470
that.
Then Netflix came along,

3612
02:31:18,530 --> 02:31:20,430
right?
That's the ideal.

3613
02:31:20,490 --> 02:31:23,490
They shook it as nothing better than 
that situation,

3614
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:25,320
that situation.
They just set it up.

3615
02:31:25,321 --> 02:31:26,490
So they put,
they're like,

3616
02:31:26,491 --> 02:31:30,420
we're going to get everybody.
We have a fucking trillion dollars.

3617
02:31:30,630 --> 02:31:33,360
We're going to get everybody.
We're going to get all the greats,

3618
02:31:33,390 --> 02:31:35,550
we're going to get Chappelle and Chris 
Rock.

3619
02:31:35,580 --> 02:31:37,970
Everybody fill in the blank.
Sebastian,

3620
02:31:37,990 --> 02:31:39,350
they're just going to cry.
Bill Burr.

3621
02:31:39,390 --> 02:31:43,440
They're going to just crush it and keep 
crushing it.

3622
02:31:44,250 --> 02:31:45,360
And then,
um,

3623
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:46,373
anything else now,
like if someone has a special on comedy 

3624
02:31:48,391 --> 02:31:49,710
central,
you go,

3625
02:31:49,711 --> 02:31:52,890
oh,
guess a netflix wouldn't hook him up.

3626
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:54,113
You got to go to comedy central.
That's how you look at it in the comedy 

3627
02:31:56,401 --> 02:31:57,280
community.
Right.

3628
02:31:57,870 --> 02:32:02,490
But I think I'm a real player is going 
to be Amazon because a,

3629
02:32:02,491 --> 02:32:06,120
this Amazon show,
the Marvelous Mrs Maizel people love it.

3630
02:32:06,300 --> 02:32:08,540
It is fucking good,
isn't it?

3631
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:10,770
It's good.
As a comic,

3632
02:32:11,070 --> 02:32:11,640
I watch it.

3633
02:32:11,640 --> 02:32:12,473
I get nervous.
I get anxiety when she's about to go on 

3634
02:32:15,411 --> 02:32:16,980
stage.
I got to watch it,

3635
02:32:17,010 --> 02:32:18,750
dude.
It's fucking good.

3636
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:22,650
The Guy who plays Lenny Bruce kills it,
kills it.

3637
02:32:22,910 --> 02:32:26,430
He seems like a less seedy,
less problematic.

3638
02:32:26,431 --> 02:32:28,920
Lenny Bruce.
But he seems a lot like Lenny Bruce.

3639
02:32:28,921 --> 02:32:29,580
I mean,
he's,

3640
02:32:29,580 --> 02:32:30,860
you know,
you can only do so much with it.

3641
02:32:30,870 --> 02:32:33,840
He's written in as a,
he's like a,

3642
02:32:33,930 --> 02:32:38,400
someone who helps the marvelous Mrs 
may's Linny CD was lenny bruce cd man.

3643
02:32:38,490 --> 02:32:39,181
A little bit.
I mean,

3644
02:32:39,181 --> 02:32:40,014
it's just,
I just,

3645
02:32:40,350 --> 02:32:42,600
I,
he doesn't see the guy.

3646
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:45,900
This is just the way it's written.
It doesn't seem like a guy who died of a

3647
02:32:45,901 --> 02:32:47,190
heroin overdose.
Right.

3648
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:48,393
Dot.
Yeah.

3649
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:51,210
He seems like more together and the TV 
show.

3650
02:32:52,070 --> 02:32:52,903
So mostly it seems like in the sheet tv 
show he seems like a victim of the 

3651
02:32:55,890 --> 02:32:59,250
censorship of the circumstances involved
in that point in time.

3652
02:33:00,030 --> 02:33:03,210
More like in the future,
like he went mad,

3653
02:33:03,330 --> 02:33:05,100
you know,
if you ever see any of the ancient,

3654
02:33:05,790 --> 02:33:06,623
one of the things that I noticed when I,
when I really started getting into 

3655
02:33:08,701 --> 02:33:09,660
standup,
I used to start,

3656
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:10,733
I would watch some of the old stuff and 
one of the things that I've found is 

3657
02:33:13,321 --> 02:33:16,350
that you can,
I think I bought it as a vhs,

3658
02:33:16,351 --> 02:33:17,790
I forgot,
I don't think it was online.

3659
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:22,200
I think it was way before youtube and 
the stuff was available online.

3660
02:33:22,201 --> 02:33:23,034
You could get old performances and I 
watched Lenny Bruce and this videotape 

3661
02:33:26,820 --> 02:33:29,880
that I bought.
It's basically they're filming him going

3662
02:33:29,881 --> 02:33:33,420
over his court case in front of a group 
of people.

3663
02:33:34,410 --> 02:33:36,790
It's really weird because he's not 
really telling stand up,

3664
02:33:36,810 --> 02:33:37,643
he's just reading off of his court case.
It's kind of interesting and it's 

3665
02:33:40,651 --> 02:33:41,550
interesting.
It's not.

3666
02:33:41,580 --> 02:33:43,140
It's not.
It's like he's going mad.

3667
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:45,450
It's going crazy because they're trying 
to bring them into jail.

3668
02:33:45,451 --> 02:33:46,284
They're finding him and arrested him and
they're locking him up in jail and 

3669
02:33:48,361 --> 02:33:52,200
they're ruining his career because he's 
swearing onstage and what he's trying to

3670
02:33:52,201 --> 02:33:53,640
just say is like,
you know,

3671
02:33:53,641 --> 02:33:54,474
no,
this is,

3672
02:33:54,510 --> 02:33:57,000
I'm trying to point things out that I'm 
swearing.

3673
02:33:57,030 --> 02:34:00,000
If I say something,
if I say a naughty words for a reason,

3674
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:01,800
it's to express myself.
I'm not,

3675
02:34:01,801 --> 02:34:02,634
I'm not just just saying things because 
they're illegal and I want you to lock 

3676
02:34:05,191 --> 02:34:06,630
me up.
He went on trial for that.

3677
02:34:06,660 --> 02:34:07,620
Oh yeah.
Oh,

3678
02:34:07,621 --> 02:34:10,470
he went to jail for that.
He got arrested many times.

3679
02:34:10,890 --> 02:34:13,260
Many times him and George Carlin.
Look,

3680
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:17,710
the reason why we can do it at the way 
we do it now has a,

3681
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:18,130
there's

3682
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:18,963
a direct,
you could trace the path as a direct 

3683
02:34:20,831 --> 02:34:24,190
path to lenny bruce.
Lenny Bruce started it all off.

3684
02:34:24,430 --> 02:34:26,140
I had to read,
I need to do some more work.

3685
02:34:26,170 --> 02:34:30,010
He opened the door for guys like Carlin 
and prior his,

3686
02:34:30,630 --> 02:34:32,380
you know,
there's mort Sahl back then too,

3687
02:34:32,381 --> 02:34:37,381
but lending in particular,
he had an irreverence to him and,

3688
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:39,430
and uh,
this,

3689
02:34:39,970 --> 02:34:40,803
this,
uh,

3690
02:34:41,050 --> 02:34:41,883
notion to buck the current yeah.
Standard of what you could and couldn't 

3691
02:34:45,761 --> 02:34:47,050
say.
You know,

3692
02:34:47,051 --> 02:34:50,970
he just changed.
He changed what comedy was brave dude.

3693
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:51,970
He was a,
you know,

3694
02:34:51,971 --> 02:34:53,560
there's people like that,
that have these,

3695
02:34:53,561 --> 02:34:57,190
these figures,
whether it's Nikola Tesla for technology

3696
02:34:57,191 --> 02:34:58,630
and innovation,
whether it's,

3697
02:34:58,810 --> 02:34:59,643
you know,
there's a bunch of people like that in 

3698
02:35:00,161 --> 02:35:01,090
this world.
Yeah.

3699
02:35:01,180 --> 02:35:04,240
They just change one dude's like Elon 
Musk is another one,

3700
02:35:04,241 --> 02:35:05,260
one dude,
pow,

3701
02:35:05,470 --> 02:35:06,790
just whoa,
look at this.

3702
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:08,500
Jesus Christ,
these,

3703
02:35:08,501 --> 02:35:09,790
these,
these people that are like,

3704
02:35:09,791 --> 02:35:13,540
that one guy just goes off in a 
direction and as a,

3705
02:35:13,570 --> 02:35:14,403
I think like,
I wonder if say if they went to the 

3706
02:35:16,670 --> 02:35:18,340
universal,
um,

3707
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:20,380
money for everybody,
right?

3708
02:35:21,050 --> 02:35:21,883
You be bi or whatever.
Don't necessarily think it's the worst 

3709
02:35:24,581 --> 02:35:26,920
thing in the world.
But then when you have as much adversity

3710
02:35:26,921 --> 02:35:28,900
for people,
like would you get a Nikola Tesla?

3711
02:35:28,901 --> 02:35:31,420
Would you get us George Carlin?
Would you get people?

3712
02:35:31,421 --> 02:35:32,254
If they didn't have to look at the world
that they're born into and see not the 

3713
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:40,180
things be uneven and give spark some 
desire.

3714
02:35:40,181 --> 02:35:41,380
You're not just one.
Or if we get that,

3715
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:42,273
I don't know.
I think you would only have your needs 

3716
02:35:45,041 --> 02:35:47,350
met.
I think you would still have your desire

3717
02:35:47,351 --> 02:35:49,330
to improve.
I think that's an inherent thing,

3718
02:35:49,570 --> 02:35:54,100
but I think it would be more beneficial.
This is just a wild guess.

3719
02:35:54,101 --> 02:35:56,710
I might be wrong.
It might be totally wrong,

3720
02:35:56,711 --> 02:35:57,520
and it might be,
it might,

3721
02:35:57,520 --> 02:36:00,070
you might be right.
It might ruin people's ambition,

3722
02:36:00,100 --> 02:36:03,100
but it might raise the base level,
right?

3723
02:36:03,101 --> 02:36:03,934
So what we're,
where we're operating from is never the 

3724
02:36:05,531 --> 02:36:06,820
same level of desperation.

3725
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:08,200
So maybe we're not as mean to each 
other,

3726
02:36:08,230 --> 02:36:09,063
right?
But maybe the innovation still takes 

3727
02:36:10,721 --> 02:36:13,840
place because people are always going to
want to be challenged and maybe it's,

3728
02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:15,640
it comes from a good place,
right?

3729
02:36:15,641 --> 02:36:18,940
Instead of from this constant place of 
desperation,

3730
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:19,953
right?
So somebody goes from a zero to a 10 in 

3731
02:36:21,101 --> 02:36:22,120
their life,
which would it be,

3732
02:36:22,121 --> 02:36:22,954
you know,
somebody that does something unique and 

3733
02:36:23,891 --> 02:36:24,724
special in outstanding.
If everybody are all automatically has 

3734
02:36:27,011 --> 02:36:27,844
given a three their base,
then now that person's going to get us 

3735
02:36:29,861 --> 02:36:34,330
to a 13 or maybe you just don't have as 
much violence.

3736
02:36:34,680 --> 02:36:37,570
You don't have as much sadness.
Oh that's true because people,

3737
02:36:37,571 --> 02:36:38,404
yeah,
people are violent when they see they 

3738
02:36:39,671 --> 02:36:41,180
want stuff from other people.
If your,

3739
02:36:41,570 --> 02:36:42,403
if your food,
if your food and your shelter is always 

3740
02:36:44,921 --> 02:36:47,410
met,
like we don't have that.

3741
02:36:47,411 --> 02:36:48,244
Right.
And we've talked about earlier about 

3742
02:36:48,791 --> 02:36:52,840
like cultures have standards and these 
standards there are different everywhere

3743
02:36:52,841 --> 02:36:53,674
and those communities except them and 
they don't like it when you try to 

3744
02:36:55,601 --> 02:36:56,434
change the standards.
If our standards here where that all of 

3745
02:36:59,771 --> 02:37:01,020
our needs are met,
we just,

3746
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:01,893
we decide as a community if we're going 
to stick together and call ourselves 

3747
02:37:04,241 --> 02:37:06,100
America,
we should treat ourselves as a family.

3748
02:37:06,430 --> 02:37:08,950
We treat ourselves as a family.
We shouldn't ignore neighborhoods.

3749
02:37:09,220 --> 02:37:12,670
We shouldn't ignore communities that are
downtrodden.

3750
02:37:12,671 --> 02:37:16,160
We shouldn't ignore any kind of poverty.
We shouldn't ignore a lack

3751
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:19,010
of education or lack of nutrition.
We shouldn't ignore those things.

3752
02:37:19,250 --> 02:37:20,083
So if we take care of all those things,
all of those things first before we do 

3753
02:37:23,811 --> 02:37:26,300
anything else,
I've yet to reengineer America.

3754
02:37:26,450 --> 02:37:27,980
Would you think,
hey,

3755
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:28,903
well we have to do is ramp up the 
military budget by $94 billion because 

3756
02:37:31,761 --> 02:37:35,390
we're basically arms dealers and we're 
going to make these deals with Syria and

3757
02:37:35,391 --> 02:37:37,850
Saudi Arabia or wherever the fuck we 
could sell rockets too.

3758
02:37:37,970 --> 02:37:38,810
It's a lot.
Yeah,

3759
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:41,180
but that's what we do.
That's what we did is what we do.

3760
02:37:41,181 --> 02:37:43,700
But if instead someone came along and 
said,

3761
02:37:43,701 --> 02:37:45,390
no,
the way to make this country stronger is

3762
02:37:45,391 --> 02:37:48,920
not make the arms industry bigger.
The way to make this country stronger is

3763
02:37:48,921 --> 02:37:50,930
to make the human industry better.
Right.

3764
02:37:51,110 --> 02:37:52,340
Make it better.
That's fine.

3765
02:37:52,341 --> 02:37:53,390
Tune humans.
Fine.

3766
02:37:53,410 --> 02:37:56,270
Tuna has done that.
Less losers.

3767
02:37:56,290 --> 02:37:57,123
Yeah.
2024 I liked Diovan Front for president 

3768
02:37:59,450 --> 02:38:00,980
less.
That'd be the best.

3769
02:38:00,981 --> 02:38:02,510
I'll be your vice president,
Mike Pence.

3770
02:38:02,511 --> 02:38:04,010
I don't do anything.
I like that man.

3771
02:38:04,011 --> 02:38:05,480
Hang back and eat chicken.
Nice.

3772
02:38:05,481 --> 02:38:09,380
And all of the weird hair.
I gotta pee so bad.

3773
02:38:09,381 --> 02:38:09,711
Yeah,
it was that.

3774
02:38:09,711 --> 02:38:11,210
It kept us in your name.
Go ahead.

3775
02:38:11,260 --> 02:38:12,093
Good.
I'd say we're probably almost done 

3776
02:38:12,561 --> 02:38:13,640
anyway.
It's already three o'clock.

3777
02:38:13,641 --> 02:38:14,474
Go Pee.

3778
02:38:14,820 --> 02:38:16,300
Cool.
Infographic on it.

3779
02:38:16,900 --> 02:38:18,220
The uh,
the UBI,

3780
02:38:18,221 --> 02:38:19,054
it's because there are the argument for 
the positive or wanting it is a lot of 

3781
02:38:22,031 --> 02:38:23,740
jobs are going to be replaced by robots 
soon,

3782
02:38:23,770 --> 02:38:24,690
right?
Yeah.

3783
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:26,800
These are some of the jobs there that 
are at risk.

3784
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:27,570
Um,
yeah.

3785
02:38:27,570 --> 02:38:28,310
No,

3786
02:38:28,310 --> 02:38:31,190
they think automation automation is 
going to kill most jobs.

3787
02:38:31,220 --> 02:38:35,030
So insurance underwriter,
99% of jobs are at risk.

3788
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:38,450
Farm laborer,
97% of jobs are list.

3789
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:40,310
Wow.
Fast Food Cook,

3790
02:38:40,311 --> 02:38:44,360
97% of jobs at risk construction 
laborer,

3791
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:49,080
88% truck drivers,
79% mail carriers,

3792
02:38:49,081 --> 02:38:50,210
68%.

3793
02:38:51,220 --> 02:38:52,750
Wow.
They recently had a,

3794
02:38:52,751 --> 02:38:54,940
uh,
a robot cooking food,

3795
02:38:55,270 --> 02:38:57,330
I think it was called flippy.
They,

3796
02:38:57,340 --> 02:38:58,173
I don't remember where they put,
I think it was summer of the United 

3797
02:38:59,770 --> 02:39:01,840
States maybe,
but they just fired it was the word they

3798
02:39:01,841 --> 02:39:03,160
use because it was doing too good.

3799
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:05,360
Whoa.
Yeah.

3800
02:39:05,480 --> 02:39:07,250
Fired it.
Cause he was doing too good.

3801
02:39:07,370 --> 02:39:09,020
Yeah.
That doesn't,

3802
02:39:09,050 --> 02:39:09,970
I get,
I believe it.

3803
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:13,610
Yeah.
That's a stupid ass ended way of looking

3804
02:39:13,611 --> 02:39:16,040
at it.
I don't understand that stupid shit.

3805
02:39:16,110 --> 02:39:20,300
Nobody's called Kelly Berger.
It was too good.

3806
02:39:20,330 --> 02:39:21,920
That's so,
so stupid.

3807
02:39:23,390 --> 02:39:25,280
That's so dumb.
It's been sidelined.

3808
02:39:25,281 --> 02:39:26,114
At least temporarily.
It turns out the automated fast food 

3809
02:39:27,201 --> 02:39:28,034
worker created by me.
So robots would a victim of its own 

3810
02:39:29,811 --> 02:39:32,630
success.
What drives 50 burgers an hour.

3811
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:34,200
Wow.
So yeah.

3812
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:36,260
Why is that bad?
It's better.

3813
02:39:36,590 --> 02:39:37,820
It's way better.
Better than you.

3814
02:39:37,821 --> 02:39:38,990
You don't want to work that job.
No.

3815
02:39:39,110 --> 02:39:40,370
Right.
That's suck at that job.

3816
02:39:40,970 --> 02:39:42,590
If we can find some other things for 
people to do,

3817
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:45,140
but you know I'm,
I'm good at a couple of things.

3818
02:39:45,141 --> 02:39:47,720
I'm not good at flipping burgers.
What?

3819
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:48,583
You're not good at that.
You don't want to fucking mindlessly 

3820
02:39:50,241 --> 02:39:52,010
flip burgers.
It doesn't even need a mind.

3821
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:54,950
Why not leave the mindless things to the
things with no mind.

3822
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:56,173
So this is the idea behind it.
But the problem is where's the money 

3823
02:39:57,801 --> 02:40:01,520
come to take care of all the people with
the universal basic income.

3824
02:40:01,550 --> 02:40:06,550
And Are you saving enough money with the
robots to make it actually profitable to

3825
02:40:07,071 --> 02:40:08,480
pay for people hard on it

3826
02:40:08,670 --> 02:40:09,503
that he's sick.
Like you save more money and make more 

3827
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:14,300
implementation.

3828
02:40:14,700 --> 02:40:16,920
Well,
Andrew Yang is going to come in here and

3829
02:40:16,921 --> 02:40:17,754
he's going to explain all this stuff to 
me in a way that supposedly gonna make 

3830
02:40:21,121 --> 02:40:21,954
sense.
He seems really smart and he was on Sam 

3831
02:40:25,470 --> 02:40:27,270
Harris' podcast and that worked over 
there.

3832
02:40:28,690 --> 02:40:30,150
Man,
as most you're I've ever held,

3833
02:40:30,151 --> 02:40:32,490
I think congratulations.
Elicit.

3834
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:35,010
How much can you hold?
What kind of car you drive?

3835
02:40:35,011 --> 02:40:38,460
Theo van?
I drive a BMW,

3836
02:40:39,220 --> 02:40:40,053
but I'm trying to get rid of it.
Figure you more for a muscle car type 

3837
02:40:42,301 --> 02:40:43,230
fellow.
Really?

3838
02:40:43,290 --> 02:40:44,123
Yeah.
I used to own a 1984 ford escort and 

3839
02:40:46,591 --> 02:40:48,000
somebody stole my passengers.
See,

3840
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:49,230
God dammit.
Yeah.

3841
02:40:49,530 --> 02:40:51,150
What are they gonna do with a passenger 
seat?

3842
02:40:51,960 --> 02:40:53,010
I don't know.
Probably put,

3843
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:54,900
you know,
put it in the living room.

3844
02:40:54,901 --> 02:40:58,420
I'll be guests at the time.
Put in the forest and jerk off they can

3845
02:41:00,290 --> 02:41:01,123
do.
And how much comes out in the fucking 

3846
02:41:02,191 --> 02:41:03,000
forest,
Bro?

3847
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:04,920
A lot.
That's where the next,

3848
02:41:04,921 --> 02:41:07,590
no wonder swamp thing happened while I 
was thinking this,

3849
02:41:07,591 --> 02:41:08,424
once they found out that in some plants 
some plants contain DNA from salmon 

3850
02:41:14,190 --> 02:41:18,690
because the salmon were used as 
fertilizer by the plant.

3851
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:19,913
As it decomposed,
it got into the actual plant itself and 

3852
02:41:22,351 --> 02:41:23,184
you can actually somehow or another 
through some certain scientific process 

3853
02:41:25,651 --> 02:41:26,484
that I'm too stupid to understand.
They can actually detect salmon in the 

3854
02:41:29,551 --> 02:41:31,680
actual plant itself.
We're close.

3855
02:41:31,681 --> 02:41:34,500
So if you were whacking off on that tree
and that tree,

3856
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:36,060
it's every day.
That's your spot.

3857
02:41:36,061 --> 02:41:36,894
You went down to that titty tree and 
whacked off on the roots and then like 

3858
02:41:40,970 --> 02:41:45,000
after a while he did an analysis and you
found in your DNA,

3859
02:41:45,030 --> 02:41:47,400
in the tree itself,
Imagine,

3860
02:41:47,490 --> 02:41:48,323
Oh v great man.
If it maintains the information of 

3861
02:41:50,041 --> 02:41:50,874
everything that whacked off on it,
you have a little son made out of wood 

3862
02:41:52,861 --> 02:41:53,694
one day your dad,
a kid in our town one time does he got 

3863
02:41:57,501 --> 02:41:59,520
made his son a wooden shirt that I'd 
tell you that.

3864
02:41:59,880 --> 02:42:00,840
Oh,
wouldn't shirt.

3865
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:01,703
Yeah,
he made his son a shirt out of plywood 

3866
02:42:02,551 --> 02:42:03,790
for Christmas.
What?

3867
02:42:03,810 --> 02:42:05,430
Yeah.
Who wanted a kid to wear it.

3868
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:06,750
Oh yeah,
he did.

3869
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:08,730
And I remember I was,
um,

3870
02:42:08,790 --> 02:42:09,623
wait a minute,
is it a stiff shirt or is it he make it 

3871
02:42:11,521 --> 02:42:15,060
like little itty bitty tiny pieces of 
plywood and weave it all together.

3872
02:42:15,450 --> 02:42:17,010
Oh No,
I was pretty stiff.

3873
02:42:17,430 --> 02:42:19,250
And the dad was a,
um,

3874
02:42:20,490 --> 02:42:22,230
yeah,
like an Elvis impersonator,

3875
02:42:22,231 --> 02:42:23,064
you know.
But Dad was an Elvis impersonator at a 

3876
02:42:25,501 --> 02:42:28,440
casino or did he do it at carnivals?
Not as locally.

3877
02:42:28,740 --> 02:42:30,040
Oh.
Um,

3878
02:42:30,210 --> 02:42:32,310
but we didn't even need him that,
no,

3879
02:42:32,340 --> 02:42:34,590
no money in it really.
I think he's probably an alcoholic,

3880
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:36,353
but he had a,
he had four kids and one of them he 

3881
02:42:39,241 --> 02:42:41,790
made,
I was going walking home one night and I

3882
02:42:41,791 --> 02:42:43,920
heard him in the garage and he's making 
like a son,

3883
02:42:44,490 --> 02:42:45,241
like a sh,
like,

3884
02:42:45,241 --> 02:42:46,950
uh,
for Christmas,

3885
02:42:46,951 --> 02:42:47,970
like a wooden shirt,
like,

3886
02:42:47,971 --> 02:42:50,060
uh,
you know,

3887
02:42:51,500 --> 02:42:52,680
uh,
not as nice.

3888
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:55,020
That one is nice wooden shirt.
Yeah.

3889
02:42:55,021 --> 02:42:56,120
Can you get what's word?
Oh,

3890
02:42:56,130 --> 02:42:57,720
but that's a,
like a sculpture.

3891
02:42:57,780 --> 02:42:59,070
Yeah.
That's nice.

3892
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:01,560
Can you get one more?
That's like a,

3893
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:06,630
like if you go over someone's house and 
they have a wooden shirt on a hanger,

3894
02:43:07,110 --> 02:43:08,340
like,
and they think that's cute.

3895
02:43:08,430 --> 02:43:11,380
Just leave now it's people are assholes 
now.

3896
02:43:11,381 --> 02:43:13,130
This kid needed it cause people used to 
speak.

3897
02:43:13,810 --> 02:43:15,240
Is that salmon sculpture?
Yeah.

3898
02:43:15,400 --> 02:43:17,140
Yeah.
It's a framed wouldn't shirt.

3899
02:43:17,350 --> 02:43:19,210
It looks like we used to beat him up 
because of his wooden.

3900
02:43:19,211 --> 02:43:19,730
Sure.
Know.

3901
02:43:19,730 --> 02:43:21,520
People used to beat him up anyway on the
bus.

3902
02:43:21,550 --> 02:43:22,181
Well the wouldn't.
Sure.

3903
02:43:22,181 --> 02:43:25,630
It would protect you from a lot of shots
and an idea and it helped.

3904
02:43:25,660 --> 02:43:26,740
He didn't wear that,
wouldn't sure.

3905
02:43:26,741 --> 02:43:28,840
You better shut the fuck.
I swear to God he did.

3906
02:43:28,890 --> 02:43:31,720
That kid is not walking around with wood
over his body like that.

3907
02:43:31,750 --> 02:43:33,070
Not Today.
That would be,

3908
02:43:33,250 --> 02:43:34,083
yeah.
This was her pads inside of it looks 

3909
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:37,750
heavy.
Fuck no dude.

3910
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:41,730
I think his dad is essay loss lady.
Yeah.

3911
02:43:41,731 --> 02:43:44,280
See there's some lady went in there.
Okay.

3912
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:48,550
But this was early.
It might've been teak teeds way too much

3913
02:43:48,551 --> 02:43:51,250
attention or opposing pretending to be 
aloof.

3914
02:43:51,251 --> 02:43:54,280
Short hair by the ocean.
We're in a wooden shirt.

3915
02:43:54,310 --> 02:43:56,890
How about a big no,
that's a big no for me.

3916
02:43:57,130 --> 02:43:58,630
Hey,
do you want to meet my friend Michelle?

3917
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:02,500
She's channeling with her fucking 
geometrically patterned.

3918
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:05,320
Wouldn't shirt on what?
No,

3919
02:44:05,350 --> 02:44:07,360
I like regular people.
This kid's name was Eddie.

3920
02:44:07,361 --> 02:44:09,520
Can you look up teak wood is teak look 
like?

3921
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:11,680
Imagine if someone was trying to set you
up with that Gal.

3922
02:44:11,830 --> 02:44:14,410
You'd be like,
well I'm torn cause obviously she's very

3923
02:44:14,411 --> 02:44:16,300
pretty.
You sure she's not crazy.

3924
02:44:17,080 --> 02:44:17,913
So desperate.
She might have a splinter that her tits 

3925
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:22,570
dude,
it was one photo shoot.

3926
02:44:22,571 --> 02:44:24,120
She doesn't wear that.
Yeah.

3927
02:44:24,220 --> 02:44:25,810
Except when she worships the ocean.

3928
02:44:29,220 --> 02:44:31,990
Now that's something a little more 
malleable teak or something like that.

3929
02:44:32,050 --> 02:44:34,330
What are the kind of wood,
did they have over print shirt?

3930
02:44:34,690 --> 02:44:38,710
Now we're talking print this system.
So it was like that,

3931
02:44:38,711 --> 02:44:39,544
but a little bit more but more real.
And he wore this for what reason did I 

3932
02:44:44,300 --> 02:44:47,320
section
look a chest plate?

3933
02:44:47,350 --> 02:44:50,820
Like a Roman soldier that,
okay.

3934
02:44:51,610 --> 02:44:55,390
Was it like how was it a connected on 
the waste on the sides rather?

3935
02:44:55,900 --> 02:44:56,733
It was just kind of like a long square.
It was almost like a kind of a cereal 

3936
02:44:58,961 --> 02:44:59,794
box.
Kinda.

3937
02:44:59,820 --> 02:45:02,200
What did he put his arms like?
Rest his arms on the side.

3938
02:45:02,230 --> 02:45:03,000
In the side?
Yeah.

3939
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,290
Fuck your armpits up.
Oh,

3940
02:45:04,291 --> 02:45:05,620
is limiting.
I mean,

3941
02:45:05,621 --> 02:45:06,460
look man,
these weren't,

3942
02:45:06,490 --> 02:45:10,480
I mean the man that made it
not a real,

3943
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:12,730
you can't do that.
My people would find out.

3944
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:13,900
They would call him out.

3945
02:45:14,430 --> 02:45:16,330
We had to do when I was younger.
You could do anything you wanted to.

3946
02:45:17,230 --> 02:45:19,000
You know people.
People were,

3947
02:45:19,300 --> 02:45:20,410
I don't know,
just more fun.

3948
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:22,450
It use your imagination more.
When I was young,

3949
02:45:22,451 --> 02:45:23,284
you have more fun.
How many kids you see beaten when you 

3950
02:45:25,421 --> 02:45:27,790
were a kid?
People used to beat their kids.

3951
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:30,340
Yeah.
Probably like at least 20 I bet.

3952
02:45:30,460 --> 02:45:32,830
Oh yeah.
But people will fight in the street.

3953
02:45:32,831 --> 02:45:34,100
Beat their kids.
Yeah.

3954
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:36,820
Yeah.
You'd see people beat people up.

3955
02:45:36,970 --> 02:45:37,803
It's been way more common,
but I guess it's maybe we moved out of 

3956
02:45:40,631 --> 02:45:42,790
those areas too,
but that's true.

3957
02:45:42,850 --> 02:45:44,200
People back in those areas.
Like Bro,

3958
02:45:44,201 --> 02:45:46,520
I'm on the front line.
Shit's still going down the mall.

3959
02:45:49,450 --> 02:45:50,061
Did I?
Yeah.

3960
02:45:50,061 --> 02:45:51,430
He used to see people fight.
Man,

3961
02:45:51,431 --> 02:45:54,340
I saw this old man get thrown into a 
fire one time in a ditch fire though.

3962
02:45:54,350 --> 02:45:55,183
People were burning leaves right in.
This guy was in his eighties to Mr 

3963
02:45:57,761 --> 02:45:58,760
Pollito.
My God.

3964
02:45:58,780 --> 02:46:01,330
Why did they throw him in a ditch?
He was fighting a bus driver.

3965
02:46:01,331 --> 02:46:05,560
He was fighting our bus driver and the 
bus driver was dreaming it ditch.

3966
02:46:05,590 --> 02:46:06,300
Yeah.
I Dunno.

3967
02:46:06,300 --> 02:46:08,740
Why was he swinging on the bus driver?
I don't know.

3968
02:46:08,860 --> 02:46:10,310
Whose fault was it?
Both of them.

3969
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:11,450
Both of them.
I think.

3970
02:46:11,570 --> 02:46:12,121
I mean,
when I'm,

3971
02:46:12,121 --> 02:46:13,430
you know,
they were both adults.

3972
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:15,230
I mean,
look man,

3973
02:46:16,610 --> 02:46:18,650
I'm not surprised they were doing it.
Oh,

3974
02:46:18,920 --> 02:46:20,270
you know,
if humans,

3975
02:46:20,330 --> 02:46:21,163
yeah,
yeah,

3976
02:46:21,630 --> 02:46:22,770
yeah.
If you saw him,

3977
02:46:22,771 --> 02:46:24,240
you wouldn't be shocked.
They were fist fighting.

3978
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:26,330
Right.
What do you do with people like that?

3979
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:29,780
Once universal basic income rolls around
and there's some stupid people that just

3980
02:46:29,781 --> 02:46:30,710
ain't getting any better.

3981
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:31,810
Basic needs met.
Okay,

3982
02:46:31,820 --> 02:46:34,220
so then after that,
after you do a couple of years universal

3983
02:46:34,221 --> 02:46:35,480
basic income,
then what do you do?

3984
02:46:35,780 --> 02:46:37,310
Wolves in the woods.
Yeah,

3985
02:46:37,490 --> 02:46:40,100
let wolves loose.
You got to thin the herd.

3986
02:46:40,510 --> 02:46:41,343
It's insane,
man.

3987
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:42,313
Cut some dude out there,
Jurgen off thinking he's hanging out 

3988
02:46:45,051 --> 02:46:45,884
behind a bush.
He just turns and sees six wolves look 

3989
02:46:48,071 --> 02:46:51,290
at up
and they just know what to do.

3990
02:46:51,700 --> 02:46:53,440
They said,
well,

3991
02:46:53,460 --> 02:46:55,750
you think a wolf would attack you while 
you were jerking off or now,

3992
02:46:55,950 --> 02:46:57,440
fuck yeah,
you're all pink.

3993
02:46:57,800 --> 02:47:00,200
Everything's pink.
He has pink Dick.

3994
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:02,440
It looks delicious.
When you wearing clothes,

3995
02:47:02,450 --> 02:47:03,320
it's like,
can I eat that?

3996
02:47:03,321 --> 02:47:04,154
I guess I can eat that.
I got to get through all that fucking 

3997
02:47:05,690 --> 02:47:09,110
bullshit plywood tee shirt.
Once I get through that,

3998
02:47:09,111 --> 02:47:09,944
I'll beat the fuck out of that dude.
But if they catch you out there with 

3999
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:13,490
just all pink,
Oh yeah.

4000
02:47:13,491 --> 02:47:14,990
They beat the fuck out of you.
Yeah.

4001
02:47:15,770 --> 02:47:18,080
Yeah.
I hope I don't do anything bad like that

4002
02:47:18,081 --> 02:47:21,170
and they in any of them seeing me,
you know,

4003
02:47:21,171 --> 02:47:24,030
I don't want to be having that kind of 
ending you get into by an animal.

4004
02:47:24,140 --> 02:47:24,973
I'm going to say,
I don't think that you're going to be 

4005
02:47:26,211 --> 02:47:27,860
jerking off in the woods and eaten by a 
wolf.

4006
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:29,270
I might be wrong.
Yeah,

4007
02:47:29,450 --> 02:47:31,040
but I would say that's not how you're 
going to go.

4008
02:47:31,370 --> 02:47:33,320
Thanks man.
I like don't see that in you bro.

4009
02:47:36,740 --> 02:47:40,720
I see better things for you.
I like the attitude naked.

4010
02:47:40,980 --> 02:47:41,813
You're packer in your hand.
Imagine if like you were about to come 

4011
02:47:44,271 --> 02:47:46,700
and the first wolf built your cat bit,
your calf and you're like,

4012
02:47:46,701 --> 02:47:47,690
look,
they're going to get me anyway.

4013
02:47:48,010 --> 02:47:50,510
Let me just keep going and shit on the 
edge.

4014
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:54,330
Maybe the bite and the pain cause you're
about to cum.

4015
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:58,760
You bus more than usual.
Yeah.

4016
02:47:58,761 --> 02:47:59,630
And you're like,
wow.

4017
02:47:59,690 --> 02:48:02,240
At least I died.
Biggest load ever.

4018
02:48:02,890 --> 02:48:03,723
Like hey,
that's one thing I've always been 

4019
02:48:04,941 --> 02:48:06,050
disappointed by.
Right,

4020
02:48:06,110 --> 02:48:08,750
because the sheer volume of your loads.
Well it's not much.

4021
02:48:08,751 --> 02:48:11,630
If you look at it takes that next sank 
and magnesium.

4022
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:14,450
Yeah.
Allegedly egg whites.

4023
02:48:14,510 --> 02:48:17,270
I do have zinc at the house.
Actually sank.

4024
02:48:17,271 --> 02:48:19,610
Supposed to be good for raising 
testosterone.

4025
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,090
Oh,
I want that bus,

4026
02:48:21,100 --> 02:48:23,120
Bro.
The neighbors,

4027
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:29,690
the more you save it up to Oh yeah,
we gather up more,

4028
02:48:29,810 --> 02:48:31,460
but I like to do that.
Not turn off.

4029
02:48:31,490 --> 02:48:33,970
I want to ride.
I want that dream bus that used to get

4030
02:48:40,080 --> 02:48:42,400
super bus.
Khafra Dude,

4031
02:48:42,401 --> 02:48:43,234
I want that dream bus.
Remember we knew would bust in a dream 

4032
02:48:45,430 --> 02:48:48,940
[inaudible] those don't happen anymore,
but they can if you search for it,

4033
02:48:48,941 --> 02:48:50,050
if you seek it out,
yeah,

4034
02:48:50,051 --> 02:48:52,240
but you have to not beat off for a long 
time.

4035
02:48:52,241 --> 02:48:53,074
To the point we bought it bodies like 
this dumb mother fucker can't even jerk 

4036
02:48:55,811 --> 02:48:56,644
off.
I'm just going to have to jerk off for 

4037
02:48:57,911 --> 02:48:59,110
him.
Unconscious.

4038
02:48:59,300 --> 02:49:02,320
Your brain fucking church you all asleep
for,

4039
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:05,710
what do you think?
Do you think that you're learning things

4040
02:49:05,711 --> 02:49:06,544
while you're dreaming?
Because some people you'd learn things 

4041
02:49:07,921 --> 02:49:08,754
when new treatments.
I think that'll be one of the next 

4042
02:49:09,781 --> 02:49:11,880
hurdles that we get over where people 
are able to,

4043
02:49:11,881 --> 02:49:12,714
uh,
be able to take in information while 

4044
02:49:15,421 --> 02:49:16,920
they're asleep.
This is what I mean.

4045
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:19,080
Like they say,
if you have a problem,

4046
02:49:19,130 --> 02:49:21,300
something's bothering you,
you should sleep on it.

4047
02:49:21,570 --> 02:49:24,240
And when you wake up in the morning,
you'll have a clear perspective.

4048
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:25,530
I believe that.
Yeah,

4049
02:49:25,531 --> 02:49:26,364
I think so too.
I think that's real because I've done 

4050
02:49:28,651 --> 02:49:29,484
that before.
That seems to actually be a good 

4051
02:49:30,781 --> 02:49:32,550
strategy.
If you can go to sleep.

4052
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:34,460
The problem is if something's really 
bothering you,

4053
02:49:34,490 --> 02:49:35,700
like damn,
I got to figure this out.

4054
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:38,910
Like you might stay up all night and be 
exhausted and then you might not be able

4055
02:49:38,911 --> 02:49:41,760
to sleep and think through it.
You've got to get a higher power to help

4056
02:49:41,761 --> 02:49:42,530
you out,
man.

4057
02:49:42,530 --> 02:49:43,363
Yeah.
She got to get you just kind of case 

4058
02:49:44,190 --> 02:49:47,340
where a higher power comes into place.
Do you think you see yourself ever going

4059
02:49:47,341 --> 02:49:48,780
to church again?
Yeah,

4060
02:49:48,781 --> 02:49:49,680
I would think so.
I did.

4061
02:49:49,681 --> 02:49:52,920
Church is kind of evolving over our time
and stuff like that.

4062
02:49:52,921 --> 02:49:55,560
And um,
would you go to Justin Bieber's preacher

4063
02:49:56,290 --> 02:49:58,260
Carl Lentz.
You know who he is?

4064
02:49:58,410 --> 02:49:59,250
Hey,
whoa.

4065
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:01,780
He texted me actually.
Whoa.

4066
02:50:01,781 --> 02:50:04,010
He's trying to groom you,
trying to pull you in.

4067
02:50:04,150 --> 02:50:05,710
How's your dark arts?
How low?

4068
02:50:05,780 --> 02:50:06,890
Low.
Do you wear your shorts?

4069
02:50:06,950 --> 02:50:08,240
Huh?
Oh,

4070
02:50:08,241 --> 02:50:09,560
I saw you guys making a kind of this 
room.

4071
02:50:11,860 --> 02:50:13,090
Yeah,
that was a little while.

4072
02:50:13,470 --> 02:50:15,840
So you know him never met him?
No.

4073
02:50:15,841 --> 02:50:17,460
He just text each other back and forth.
Yeah.

4074
02:50:17,461 --> 02:50:22,461
We communicate sometimes sad root 
Hashtag Dick Route and he,

4075
02:50:22,950 --> 02:50:24,300
uh,
it looks good.

4076
02:50:25,050 --> 02:50:26,570
Yeah,
they're both camera too.

4077
02:50:26,580 --> 02:50:31,580
I think it's good,
but I've never met him.

4078
02:50:33,090 --> 02:50:33,923
But I would go to each other.
It has to try to meet you and you're 

4079
02:50:36,301 --> 02:50:37,020
like,
not tonight,

4080
02:50:37,020 --> 02:50:40,400
Bro.
You think he's homoerotic?

4081
02:50:40,650 --> 02:50:41,730
No.
Oh,

4082
02:50:42,710 --> 02:50:46,390
that's a weird way of putting it.
You're homoerotic

4083
02:50:50,620 --> 02:50:52,730
you always,
every time I'm here,

4084
02:50:52,731 --> 02:50:57,731
he's talking about jerking off the 
magical about that problem.

4085
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:02,720
It's like you came in here with like gay
expectation didn't dude,

4086
02:51:03,240 --> 02:51:04,073
I jerked off yesterday.
I'm not going to plan on coming again 

4087
02:51:05,851 --> 02:51:06,684
for a couple of days.
Do you have a time where like if you've 

4088
02:51:09,630 --> 02:51:11,670
jerked off and it's been like four days,
like man,

4089
02:51:11,940 --> 02:51:12,840
maybe I should do something.

4090
02:51:13,020 --> 02:51:15,030
Uh Oh,
I get that feeling inside of me.

4091
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:18,620
So it's like a vulture then wants to fly
on my fucking kicker.

4092
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:19,463
My brain.
You don't want to be like two sex 

4093
02:51:21,841 --> 02:51:22,710
obsessed.
No,

4094
02:51:22,880 --> 02:51:24,060
like there's a balance,
right?

4095
02:51:24,090 --> 02:51:25,420
You don't want to beat off every day.
No,

4096
02:51:25,460 --> 02:51:28,140
but you don't want to not beat off 
either because then it'll consume you.

4097
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:29,980
But I think I'm gonna start hunting that
dream.

4098
02:51:29,981 --> 02:51:31,780
They don't want that fucking nocturnal 
bust.

4099
02:51:32,530 --> 02:51:37,530
They don't to start a group.
I'm hunting that the l and d's Row.

4100
02:51:38,930 --> 02:51:41,040
There's late night busters brother's 
dream,

4101
02:51:41,310 --> 02:51:43,020
dude.
How funny is that expression?

4102
02:51:43,021 --> 02:51:45,750
I'm hunting that dream.
I want that nocturnal bus.

4103
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:48,060
That's what I want.
Hunting the dream.

4104
02:51:48,480 --> 02:51:50,990
But Dude,
imagine you Jessica,

4105
02:51:54,620 --> 02:51:57,140
would you,
have you ever come common dice,

4106
02:51:57,141 --> 02:52:01,310
claim noises?
Have you?

4107
02:52:01,640 --> 02:52:04,710
That guy's a fucking movie man.
I never liked him.

4108
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:06,190
Every time I see him at the comedy

4109
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:07,330
store,
he's never been nice.

4110
02:52:07,400 --> 02:52:08,680
He's never nice to you?
No,

4111
02:52:08,681 --> 02:52:10,450
that doesn't make any sense.
I don't know why.

4112
02:52:10,930 --> 02:52:11,763
No.
Have you said hide him if you had a 

4113
02:52:12,881 --> 02:52:14,500
conversation with them?
I've tried.

4114
02:52:14,530 --> 02:52:16,360
I feel like I've tried to engage with 
them and he,

4115
02:52:16,480 --> 02:52:16,871
and then,
well,

4116
02:52:16,871 --> 02:52:19,060
one time he brought me up on stage and 
he kept like,

4117
02:52:19,210 --> 02:52:21,250
they told him my name a million times.
He never got it.

4118
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:23,890
It just got to the point where it felt 
like he was being rude,

4119
02:52:23,891 --> 02:52:24,840
you know?
Like make him fun.

4120
02:52:24,940 --> 02:52:27,310
He might just be having fun.
He's a good guy.

4121
02:52:27,370 --> 02:52:28,091
Is He?
Yeah,

4122
02:52:28,091 --> 02:52:29,680
he's a good guy.
I'm a fan.

4123
02:52:29,890 --> 02:52:31,810
Maybe I need to see another side of him.
I mean,

4124
02:52:31,811 --> 02:52:33,770
I would give him scouted.
It gets a gnome man.

4125
02:52:33,860 --> 02:52:37,000
He's going to get to know him.
When I was a kid,

4126
02:52:37,001 --> 02:52:39,190
I was at giant Qinetiq dice clay fan.

4127
02:52:39,620 --> 02:52:40,453
I mean,
when I first started meeting him at the 

4128
02:52:41,381 --> 02:52:41,891
store,
I was like,

4129
02:52:41,891 --> 02:52:45,110
I can't even believe he's healer.
But once you got to know him as an adult

4130
02:52:45,111 --> 02:52:46,930
and mean,
being a famous always been cool.

4131
02:52:46,950 --> 02:52:47,860
Yeah,
yeah.

4132
02:52:48,220 --> 02:52:49,750
Maybe I just need to have a new 
experience with him.

4133
02:52:49,990 --> 02:52:50,640
He's,
he,

4134
02:52:50,640 --> 02:52:51,431
you know,
he just,

4135
02:52:51,431 --> 02:52:52,990
he's dice.
He's crazy.

4136
02:52:53,140 --> 02:52:55,750
Like half of his thing.
Like if you go to his instagram page,

4137
02:52:56,050 --> 02:52:58,690
half of it as like a put on,
he's always fucking around.

4138
02:52:58,720 --> 02:53:00,190
Oh yeah.
Always be in funny.

4139
02:53:00,490 --> 02:53:01,323
Yeah,
that's true.

4140
02:53:01,420 --> 02:53:04,060
But he gave me very good.
He's the reason why I started touring.

4141
02:53:04,360 --> 02:53:06,800
He gave me very good advice and I was,
you know,

4142
02:53:06,801 --> 02:53:08,410
it's was like in the 90s man,
he's like,

4143
02:53:08,411 --> 02:53:10,570
you should go fucking tour.
It was like,

4144
02:53:10,571 --> 02:53:11,500
you're funny.
He's like,

4145
02:53:11,501 --> 02:53:13,180
you won't want to hang around here all 
the time.

4146
02:53:13,260 --> 02:53:13,540
Yeah.

4147
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:14,171
And I was like,
yeah,

4148
02:53:14,171 --> 02:53:15,004
he's right.
I don't want to hang around here like I 

4149
02:53:16,151 --> 02:53:17,980
should do clubs,
I should make a living.

4150
02:53:18,360 --> 02:53:19,840
And this is what he was basically 
saying.

4151
02:53:19,841 --> 02:53:20,674
It was like,
don't get roped into only working in 

4152
02:53:24,461 --> 02:53:28,090
Hollywood doing television shows and 
stuff like that because then these other

4153
02:53:28,091 --> 02:53:29,230
people,
you control your destiny.

4154
02:53:29,260 --> 02:53:32,800
You could tour and this is from him 
obviously coming out of,

4155
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:38,350
he had the most insane epic success of 
any comedian ever.

4156
02:53:38,410 --> 02:53:39,520
Yeah.
He was a rocket ship.

4157
02:53:39,550 --> 02:53:42,490
He was,
he had sold out hundreds of arenas,

4158
02:53:42,760 --> 02:53:44,470
arenas,
giant ass places.

4159
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:46,150
Oh,
why are everyone is DVD or his seat,

4160
02:53:46,151 --> 02:53:48,100
whatever.
We hit the neighborhood and whenever all

4161
02:53:48,101 --> 02:53:50,380
the kids were watching it and haven't 
even allowed to watch it.

4162
02:53:50,560 --> 02:53:52,780
So I thought when I was listening to him
talk,

4163
02:53:52,781 --> 02:53:53,800
I was thinking,
oh yeah,

4164
02:53:53,801 --> 02:53:54,634
of course.
Like this guy probably made more money 

4165
02:53:56,621 --> 02:53:59,460
than anybody ever did on a sitcom ever 
Malia.

4166
02:53:59,530 --> 02:54:01,870
And he did it just doing whatever the 
fuck you wanted to do.

4167
02:54:01,871 --> 02:54:02,830
And he was basically saying,
hey,

4168
02:54:02,831 --> 02:54:05,710
don't get wrapped up in this.
Only you could tour.

4169
02:54:05,740 --> 02:54:07,150
You can make money.
I mean,

4170
02:54:07,151 --> 02:54:09,010
even if I never made money the way he 
did,

4171
02:54:09,011 --> 02:54:09,844
you could still make a living.
Whereas if you don't tour and you just 

4172
02:54:12,371 --> 02:54:17,050
do sitcoms or just work in television,
especially if you work as a writer,

4173
02:54:17,380 --> 02:54:18,213
that's the dark path,
the great standup comic that becomes a 

4174
02:54:21,941 --> 02:54:25,390
writer.
They never tour and they never develop a

4175
02:54:25,391 --> 02:54:27,370
crowd and they never,
does that happen.

4176
02:54:27,430 --> 02:54:28,630
Yes,
it happens a lot.

4177
02:54:28,780 --> 02:54:31,420
But why warrant they to supposed to be a
writer then?

4178
02:54:31,460 --> 02:54:31,901
No,
no,

4179
02:54:31,901 --> 02:54:32,381
no,
no,

4180
02:54:32,381 --> 02:54:32,850
no,
no.

4181
02:54:32,850 --> 02:54:33,683
And they gave in to the writing.
They could have when we know great 

4182
02:54:36,821 --> 02:54:37,654
comedians who mostly work as writers and
it doesn't make any sense when they 

4183
02:54:40,541 --> 02:54:41,374
don't want to,
they want to be a comic out there 

4184
02:54:44,110 --> 02:54:49,110
performing and the level of their 
material is far better than the level of

4185
02:54:50,411 --> 02:54:52,390
their notoriety.
You know?

4186
02:54:52,450 --> 02:54:53,320
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.

4187
02:54:53,321 --> 02:54:54,061
That's what it is.
Oh,

4188
02:54:54,061 --> 02:54:56,170
and Smith is a perfect example.
Oh,

4189
02:54:56,171 --> 02:54:57,610
and Smith,
in my opinion,

4190
02:54:57,790 --> 02:55:00,040
is one of the best comedians on the 
planet.

4191
02:55:00,220 --> 02:55:04,580
He's a killer.
That dude makes me cry funny and he's so

4192
02:55:04,610 --> 02:55:06,560
good.
His timing,

4193
02:55:06,561 --> 02:55:11,561
his stage presence is delivery is 
material.

4194
02:55:12,021 --> 02:55:15,620
The subject matter's excellent.
It's top shelf comedy.

4195
02:55:15,640 --> 02:55:17,870
Yeah.
But most people don't know who he is.

4196
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:18,980
Right.
And that's because he's made,

4197
02:55:19,090 --> 02:55:20,930
I mean he's made a great living as a 
writer,

4198
02:55:20,931 --> 02:55:23,630
but he's still,
he should,

4199
02:55:23,750 --> 02:55:24,583
you know,
he should be recognized as a comic as 

4200
02:55:26,181 --> 02:55:27,110
well.
Yeah.

4201
02:55:27,740 --> 02:55:28,573
That's how I look at it.
So basically what dice was telling me 

4202
02:55:31,011 --> 02:55:32,720
back then was like,
get out,

4203
02:55:32,780 --> 02:55:33,980
go,
go someplace,

4204
02:55:34,340 --> 02:55:36,140
go do the road,
do comedy out there.

4205
02:55:36,141 --> 02:55:38,960
You could headline clubs on gratefully.
Yeah.

4206
02:55:38,961 --> 02:55:39,794
I mean I'm going,
I'm glad he did that because if we'd 

4207
02:55:41,121 --> 02:55:44,630
wait and get you that you might not be 
the same comedian if he didn't say that.

4208
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:45,980
Yeah,
I'm sure.

4209
02:55:46,610 --> 02:55:47,930
And uh,
I don't know.

4210
02:55:47,960 --> 02:55:48,793
You know,
it's easy.

4211
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:53,000
Like it's easy to just decide someone's 
an asshole or you know,

4212
02:55:53,180 --> 02:55:55,820
if one interaction with someone you want
to shit on them.

4213
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:59,390
I just think you should be,
and I'm trying to do this myself.

4214
02:55:59,750 --> 02:56:02,360
It'd be very careful when you shit on 
somebody.

4215
02:56:02,810 --> 02:56:06,440
When is it,
when is it valid and when is it just you

4216
02:56:06,441 --> 02:56:08,100
looking for something to shit on?
Right.

4217
02:56:08,310 --> 02:56:10,500
When are you showing no empathy?
Yeah.

4218
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:12,410
What is it now?
I think,

4219
02:56:12,411 --> 02:56:13,010
I mean,
I,

4220
02:56:13,010 --> 02:56:13,611
yeah,
you're right.

4221
02:56:13,611 --> 02:56:14,480
I mean,
I'm willing to have a new,

4222
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:17,180
a new experience too late.
You're fucked up.

4223
02:56:17,181 --> 02:56:18,410
Fuck.
Said his name.

4224
02:56:18,440 --> 02:56:19,610
He said move.
It's over.

4225
02:56:20,240 --> 02:56:21,500
Oh,
well I don't care about that.

4226
02:56:21,530 --> 02:56:23,380
I mean he's going to get mad.
Boy,

4227
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:27,800
he was an asshole.
So it's okay if I,

4228
02:56:27,801 --> 02:56:29,160
if uh,
they,

4229
02:56:29,161 --> 02:56:30,170
he just,
they kept

4230
02:56:31,670 --> 02:56:33,530
their,
like he was on stage before me,

4231
02:56:33,531 --> 02:56:35,810
so I was going to go up after him.
He was probably joking around,

4232
02:56:35,811 --> 02:56:36,381
man.
Yeah.

4233
02:56:36,381 --> 02:56:39,080
But at a certain point it was,
uh,

4234
02:56:39,620 --> 02:56:40,453
it was just rude.

4235
02:56:41,750 --> 02:56:42,583
No,
it was just like he kept not getting it 

4236
02:56:43,911 --> 02:56:44,930
and then like,
ah,

4237
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:46,040
fuck it,
you know,

4238
02:56:46,041 --> 02:56:49,160
is this like it at a certain point?
To me it was just rude.

4239
02:56:50,150 --> 02:56:50,983
I see.
Because you were probably a little bit 

4240
02:56:53,661 --> 02:56:54,494
anxious.
You're going on after him and then he's 

4241
02:56:57,471 --> 02:56:59,180
not saying your name right.
You feel like,

4242
02:56:59,240 --> 02:57:00,620
oh,
he doesn't know who I am.

4243
02:57:00,740 --> 02:57:03,560
So this is kind of disrespectful.
There could have been,

4244
02:57:03,561 --> 02:57:04,221
there could have been.
Yeah.

4245
02:57:04,221 --> 02:57:05,054
I think that that,
that certainly could have been my part 

4246
02:57:06,151 --> 02:57:06,984
in it.
That could admit and ego and it Bundy 

4247
02:57:07,920 --> 02:57:10,030
9.9% fucking around.
Yeah.

4248
02:57:10,120 --> 02:57:12,830
He thought it was funny.
Maybe what he would do that if it was,

4249
02:57:13,160 --> 02:57:14,510
if he knew you.
Yeah.

4250
02:57:14,690 --> 02:57:15,523
He'd be like,
Oh,

4251
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:17,270
who?
Bobby Lee.

4252
02:57:17,390 --> 02:57:18,650
Right.
He's alive.

4253
02:57:20,690 --> 02:57:22,310
I mean,
that's part of who he is.

4254
02:57:22,340 --> 02:57:23,173
Right.
Well maybe I'll and maybe I'll have an 

4255
02:57:24,711 --> 02:57:26,570
opportunity to get to know him better.
Um,

4256
02:57:26,590 --> 02:57:28,790
him and donald were hate each other.
They do.

4257
02:57:28,791 --> 02:57:29,624
I'm great friends with both of them now.
I loved watching him at Mitzi shores 

4258
02:57:32,150 --> 02:57:36,920
when he performed at the Mitzi shores 
reunion or deaths party.

4259
02:57:37,250 --> 02:57:39,920
But I remember I liked watching them 
there,

4260
02:57:39,921 --> 02:57:40,754
you know,
I don't,

4261
02:57:41,300 --> 02:57:42,133
I mean,
I think that he's a great comedian and 

4262
02:57:42,951 --> 02:57:44,480
stuff.
You know who,

4263
02:57:44,481 --> 02:57:45,950
what does he like now though?
I don't know.

4264
02:57:45,951 --> 02:57:49,270
Who would you have liked to have seen 
live that you can never go to church?

4265
02:57:50,930 --> 02:57:55,220
I got to see him live when he was really
old and sick,

4266
02:57:55,820 --> 02:57:57,500
unfortunately.
I love him,

4267
02:57:57,501 --> 02:58:00,170
man.
He's from near where my mother's from.

4268
02:58:00,171 --> 02:58:02,550
It in Illinois.
Peoria in the house.

4269
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:06,510
I at least got a chance to see,
be in his presence and see him live.

4270
02:58:07,110 --> 02:58:08,490
Yeah.
And he had this kind of,

4271
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:11,250
he kind of had this head Bob thing that 
was very,

4272
02:58:11,460 --> 02:58:13,050
you know,
who I think could come back and

4273
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:17,850
order stand up right now for his hand.
Eddie Murphy.

4274
02:58:18,270 --> 02:58:19,103
Yeah.
I think if Eddie Murphy came back right 

4275
02:58:20,671 --> 02:58:21,840
now,
he would murder,

4276
02:58:21,841 --> 02:58:23,470
stand up,
murder it.

4277
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:25,770
Somebody said that the other day they 
were thinking he might come back.

4278
02:58:26,220 --> 02:58:27,053
He did a a thing one day.
Well he was talking about bill cosby 

4279
02:58:31,110 --> 02:58:31,943
about them taking awards away from Bill 
Cosby and he did this bill cosby 

4280
02:58:35,521 --> 02:58:36,990
impression and he did it.
We this,

4281
02:58:37,260 --> 02:58:38,580
what does that say?
What happened?

4282
02:58:38,710 --> 02:58:41,970
Popups come mother the fuckers.
He's coming back for that.

4283
02:58:42,030 --> 02:58:43,980
The movie.
Oh really?

4284
02:58:44,510 --> 02:58:46,980
Well is our CEO in it too?
I don't know.

4285
02:58:47,500 --> 02:58:49,620
He just,
he just had his 10th kid.

4286
02:58:50,490 --> 02:58:51,720
Wow.
Shoot.

4287
02:58:51,721 --> 02:58:55,320
Just shooting mad loads.
Now there's a guy who needs a birch tree

4288
02:58:55,321 --> 02:58:56,730
in the yard,
57 years old.

4289
02:58:56,731 --> 02:58:58,170
He's 57 yeah.
Damn.

4290
02:58:58,171 --> 02:58:59,004
It's amazing.
He's only six years older than me or 

4291
02:59:00,271 --> 02:59:02,310
dose or a,
yeah,

4292
02:59:02,370 --> 02:59:04,450
six years old than me.
There's a guy hazing,

4293
02:59:06,870 --> 02:59:08,610
Eddie Murphy's.
It's been around forever.

4294
02:59:08,910 --> 02:59:09,743
Is it a new movie coming out on Netflix?
He was killing it when he was like 18 

4295
02:59:11,671 --> 02:59:13,030
years old.
He was on sight line,

4296
02:59:13,050 --> 02:59:15,090
but he was like 18 or something.
It's crazy.

4297
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:18,960
You forget how young he was when 
delirious rolled around.

4298
02:59:19,830 --> 02:59:20,663
Good Lord.
He was probably 22 years old or 

4299
02:59:22,291 --> 02:59:24,750
something.
Would you?

4300
02:59:25,500 --> 02:59:27,740
I bet he can come pretty far.
How far are you thinking about,

4301
02:59:27,790 --> 02:59:32,790
wait a foot.
Wait,

4302
02:59:34,900 --> 02:59:36,450
this guy,
we went over the world.

4303
02:59:37,080 --> 02:59:39,720
Jim or Jim.
Jim Carrey can come 30 feet,

4304
02:59:39,721 --> 02:59:40,554
grow back out.
It looks like a lot of dudes out there 

4305
02:59:42,601 --> 02:59:46,110
that have broken the world record in 
distance coming and nobody wants to give

4306
02:59:46,111 --> 02:59:48,660
him any credit for it because it's like 
an impromptu thing,

4307
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:50,570
you know?
Like you don't know.

4308
02:59:50,650 --> 02:59:55,180
I think decided you pull out.
I'd never,

4309
02:59:55,210 --> 02:59:57,720
Peter North was known for,
he was known for volume.

4310
02:59:57,780 --> 02:59:58,710
Oh yeah,
yeah,

4311
02:59:58,920 --> 03:00:00,480
they call it.
That's a crazy thing.

4312
03:00:01,530 --> 03:00:05,430
Loads are so hectic that you're known 
for them.

4313
03:00:05,490 --> 03:00:07,200
Like tick,
like if you say big loads,

4314
03:00:07,201 --> 03:00:09,060
you say Peter North,
everybody knows.

4315
03:00:09,540 --> 03:00:10,980
Think about that.
Oh yeah.

4316
03:00:11,070 --> 03:00:11,903
All the fucking substantial loads and 
all the porn stars of dumped on all 

4317
03:00:15,301 --> 03:00:18,090
those,
all those maidens all over the land.

4318
03:00:18,330 --> 03:00:21,220
And then one dude is known for the 
highest volume of calm.

4319
03:00:21,221 --> 03:00:22,770
Like you gotta be known,
known.

4320
03:00:23,010 --> 03:00:25,200
You know what I'm saying?
To let it be known.

4321
03:00:25,280 --> 03:00:26,490
Known.
No.

4322
03:00:27,720 --> 03:00:28,553
Time after time again,
you got to fucking bring that gravy 

4323
03:00:31,081 --> 03:00:32,120
boat.
Yeah.

4324
03:00:32,210 --> 03:00:33,043
You gotta be like,
you gotta be like the Kanye west of 

4325
03:00:35,161 --> 03:00:35,994
loads.
You have to be coming and also probably 

4326
03:00:37,501 --> 03:00:40,080
look at your watch or your phone during 
it and you're still coming.

4327
03:00:40,081 --> 03:00:43,410
When you look back at your day,
you gotta be the mascot of loads.

4328
03:00:43,430 --> 03:00:44,850
Yeah.
You gotta be,

4329
03:00:44,940 --> 03:00:49,940
you gotta be low like Michael Jackson.
Undeniable.

4330
03:00:50,490 --> 03:00:51,271
You think?
No,

4331
03:00:51,271 --> 03:00:56,271
he had very little coming here.
Bank probably zero but dancing prodigy.

4332
03:00:56,510 --> 03:00:59,200
Like he's the Michael Jackson of dance.
Yeah,

4333
03:00:59,320 --> 03:01:01,000
but you don't come much when you're 
doing all that.

4334
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:05,440
What activities do you think you do when
you come?

4335
03:01:05,441 --> 03:01:06,274
A lot?
Like the kind of people that like power 

4336
03:01:08,321 --> 03:01:10,150
lifters probably shoot giant loads.
Right?

4337
03:01:10,510 --> 03:01:13,210
I think you would think they do,
but for their size and stuff,

4338
03:01:13,211 --> 03:01:15,820
they're not doing that much.
I think she's the biggest loads.

4339
03:01:15,880 --> 03:01:17,620
Oh,
I think a guy that's in space,

4340
03:01:17,650 --> 03:01:21,310
I think a guy that's on a cliff,
like a cliff climber.

4341
03:01:22,810 --> 03:01:24,400
Yeah.
But is that the biggest loads?

4342
03:01:24,460 --> 03:01:25,293
I mean that guy shooting some fucking 
just cause he has the balls to climb up 

4343
03:01:27,900 --> 03:01:30,490
that he's busted somebody else.
Maybe that's what it is.

4344
03:01:30,491 --> 03:01:31,630
Like he,
he's got balls,

4345
03:01:31,750 --> 03:01:32,583
right?
Those guys shoot bigger loads like bmx 

4346
03:01:34,931 --> 03:01:37,180
jumpers and they jumped three times in 
the air and then land on the bike.

4347
03:01:37,240 --> 03:01:39,010
Yeah.
Maybe they have the biggest loads.

4348
03:01:39,430 --> 03:01:40,263
Um,
also guys who like fake put a sign on 

4349
03:01:42,881 --> 03:01:43,714
their car and they don't pay a meter.
It's like meters broken that he's put 

4350
03:01:45,431 --> 03:01:47,620
that on their car and if I can still 
park there,

4351
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:50,560
those dudes bust some of the loads,
bro.

4352
03:01:51,940 --> 03:01:54,280
I think there's other things too,
like pickpockets.

4353
03:01:54,580 --> 03:01:55,413
Oh,
people that were up turtlenecks do not 

4354
03:01:56,801 --> 03:01:57,634
come very much or far know.
What is it about wanting to keep your 

4355
03:02:00,311 --> 03:02:01,750
neck warm?
It's not very manly.

4356
03:02:01,840 --> 03:02:03,080
It's just a bitch.
Move on.

4357
03:02:05,290 --> 03:02:10,290
It's a French thing too.
And I don't care about the French.

4358
03:02:10,630 --> 03:02:11,201
Wow.
But you,

4359
03:02:11,201 --> 03:02:12,640
have you been there or you just,
I've been there.

4360
03:02:13,420 --> 03:02:15,370
I'm probably prejudice to have you been 
to France?

4361
03:02:15,510 --> 03:02:16,780
Yeah,
he'd been to Montreal.

4362
03:02:17,230 --> 03:02:17,991
I've been,
I'm on the trail.

4363
03:02:17,991 --> 03:02:19,180
You know.
You didn't love the French.

4364
03:02:19,210 --> 03:02:21,250
I love the Canadians.
French Canadians.

4365
03:02:21,790 --> 03:02:22,623
Yeah.
I'll take them.

4366
03:02:23,110 --> 03:02:24,610
You love Canadians,
period.

4367
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:25,750
I love Canadians,
period.

4368
03:02:25,930 --> 03:02:28,420
But do you love French Canadians?
Yes,

4369
03:02:28,750 --> 03:02:31,090
because they are Canadian,
but French bro.

4370
03:02:31,720 --> 03:02:34,930
Not into French and nobody is.
They make great wine.

4371
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:35,531
Yeah.
It's not true.

4372
03:02:35,531 --> 03:02:37,300
People go to Paris every year.
Yay.

4373
03:02:37,301 --> 03:02:38,134
But they leave.

4374
03:02:40,570 --> 03:02:42,700
It's not the kind of place people are 
milling around,

4375
03:02:42,701 --> 03:02:43,534
man.
I think people go there and they decide 

4376
03:02:46,571 --> 03:02:49,630
that it's better than America sometimes.
Didn't Johnny Depp move there?

4377
03:02:50,640 --> 03:02:51,670
Yeah.
Poor Johnny.

4378
03:02:51,880 --> 03:02:54,490
You know who else moved there?
Um,

4379
03:02:55,420 --> 03:02:58,360
fuck the guy from law and order.
Uh,

4380
03:02:58,450 --> 03:03:00,010
Mandy Patinkin.
No,

4381
03:03:00,790 --> 03:03:02,200
Richard Belzer.
Richard Belzer.

4382
03:03:02,260 --> 03:03:05,350
Richard Belzer moved to France.
He met a woman poly then.

4383
03:03:05,880 --> 03:03:07,980
Yeah,
I would think we,

4384
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:11,500
I mean read love,
but Ed,

4385
03:03:11,980 --> 03:03:14,890
I bet you bust and France break.
If he know,

4386
03:03:15,130 --> 03:03:19,000
imagine Siemens cruising down the street
in that city.

4387
03:03:21,430 --> 03:03:23,980
Roads are slippery of it.
It's all on scooters

4388
03:03:26,830 --> 03:03:28,390
roads.
A slick with loads.

4389
03:03:30,230 --> 03:03:34,150
Welcome to
go sideways.

4390
03:03:34,151 --> 03:03:38,800
Even just everywhere through the air.
Out of the bushes.

4391
03:03:38,801 --> 03:03:43,801
DNA fucking manhole covers like the 
clown pennywise dude,

4392
03:03:45,611 --> 03:03:48,470
this shit is getting gay bro.
Sorry.

4393
03:03:49,470 --> 03:03:52,510
It's just very dick oriented today.
I won't say it's gay.

4394
03:03:52,540 --> 03:03:53,530
Well,
it's that time of year.

4395
03:03:53,531 --> 03:03:55,340
It's spring.
People are refresh.

4396
03:03:55,630 --> 03:03:58,240
It's middle of the winter.
It's freezing cold out.

4397
03:03:58,241 --> 03:04:00,720
It's just January.
Whatever you guys are.

4398
03:04:01,160 --> 03:04:02,150
You guys aren't open minded.

4399
03:04:05,360 --> 03:04:09,650
It doesn't get more winter.
January groundhog's day yet.

4400
03:04:09,710 --> 03:04:11,600
Why don't you say it's August?
Okay,

4401
03:04:11,850 --> 03:04:13,920
why this is lie.
Hey Man.

4402
03:04:13,921 --> 03:04:17,120
It's like it's August outlet.
It's spraying.

4403
03:04:17,510 --> 03:04:22,510
I have the best calendars,
dude.

4404
03:04:24,441 --> 03:04:25,274
We just did three hours.
It's three 30 but this is the longest 

4405
03:04:28,131 --> 03:04:31,250
time we had ever been in my life.
Now we know we've done this before.

4406
03:04:31,370 --> 03:04:33,470
Not this much.
My think we did well.

4407
03:04:33,471 --> 03:04:36,590
How long was the last one?
I think a lot of them were three hours.

4408
03:04:36,740 --> 03:04:37,573
I'm gonna have to get on some pills or 
something to be able to go through this 

4409
03:04:39,171 --> 03:04:39,980
again.
So you just drink,

4410
03:04:39,980 --> 03:04:42,740
drink.
Lenny's Nitros these really caffeinated,

4411
03:04:42,790 --> 03:04:45,320
yeah,
there's big juicy up plus.

4412
03:04:45,321 --> 03:04:47,000
It was fun.
It was fun.

4413
03:04:47,001 --> 03:04:48,170
Actually.
The last one was longer.

4414
03:04:48,500 --> 03:04:51,050
Oh,
minutes longer than the moon then.

4415
03:04:51,051 --> 03:04:54,530
We've not gotten him a fucking limited 
bust on this one,

4416
03:04:55,450 --> 03:04:56,910
I think is the right time to end it 
though.

4417
03:04:57,320 --> 03:04:58,310
We did it.
Um,

4418
03:04:58,880 --> 03:05:00,320
thanks for having me.
My pleasure,

4419
03:05:00,321 --> 03:05:01,154
brother.
Anytime you got a new podcast out with 

4420
03:05:02,481 --> 03:05:03,650
Brendan Schaub.
Yup.

4421
03:05:03,651 --> 03:05:05,700
Called the king and the sting and it 
comes out.

4422
03:05:05,720 --> 03:05:07,520
How'd you become the rat king?
What is that?

4423
03:05:08,240 --> 03:05:10,730
He just made fun of me.
One time they called me a rat.

4424
03:05:10,850 --> 03:05:11,683
Oh,
did you see that video of a bunch of 

4425
03:05:13,731 --> 03:05:17,210
rats connected together to pretend that 
they're a snake?

4426
03:05:17,250 --> 03:05:18,083
Oh yeah.
There was Whitney Cummings sent it to 

4427
03:05:19,821 --> 03:05:21,710
me.
That's trickery.

4428
03:05:22,010 --> 03:05:24,100
I found it on twitter.
You've seen that?

4429
03:05:24,450 --> 03:05:26,210
Yeah.
It's on my,

4430
03:05:26,211 --> 03:05:27,044
on my twitter.
There's a bunch of rats that connected 

4431
03:05:29,571 --> 03:05:33,080
themselves and they're running together 
to pretend that they're a snake.

4432
03:05:33,800 --> 03:05:35,870
It's a rat came confuse.
Well,

4433
03:05:35,871 --> 03:05:38,990
racking is when they all get bundled up 
together and they get stuck and they get

4434
03:05:38,991 --> 03:05:39,824
their tails twined up.
How the fuck does that ever happened to 

4435
03:05:42,030 --> 03:05:43,310
disgusting creatures already?

4436
03:05:43,560 --> 03:05:45,080
Yeah,
they die that way too.

4437
03:05:45,081 --> 03:05:48,740
They find them all caked up and fucking,
this is a trap.

4438
03:05:48,741 --> 03:05:49,650
Hardy him,
Bro.

4439
03:05:49,850 --> 03:05:51,200
But spring break,
dude,

4440
03:05:51,230 --> 03:05:53,930
it's burning man.
That's burning man for rat.

4441
03:05:53,990 --> 03:05:55,370
Yeah.
Look at this.

4442
03:05:55,400 --> 03:05:56,740
Watch this part of this.
We at this,

4443
03:05:57,080 --> 03:05:57,913
those are all rats all completely 
bundled up together to look like a 

4444
03:06:00,711 --> 03:06:01,544
snake.
So Mama Rats in the front and the all 

4445
03:06:02,991 --> 03:06:07,991
the baby rats stay connected to each 
other to pretend they're snakes,

4446
03:06:08,140 --> 03:06:10,760
so they avoid predators.
And I if you,

4447
03:06:10,761 --> 03:06:12,470
and I saw that from far away,
we think of as a snake.

4448
03:06:12,520 --> 03:06:14,280
100% yeah.
How crazy is,

4449
03:06:14,281 --> 03:06:15,740
it's amazing,
Mother Nature is amazing,

4450
03:06:15,741 --> 03:06:17,600
man.
Mother Nature's a motherfucker.

4451
03:06:17,690 --> 03:06:18,920
Yeah,
we're limited time.

4452
03:06:18,921 --> 03:06:20,930
I think humans,
you think,

4453
03:06:21,020 --> 03:06:22,690
oh,
this is part time brothers.

4454
03:06:22,691 --> 03:06:24,380
There's no way to let us out of here.
Fuck around forever.

4455
03:06:24,381 --> 03:06:27,890
Those dumb motherfuckers could do is 
pretend to be a snake and you could make

4456
03:06:27,891 --> 03:06:29,690
snakes.
We can make robots,

4457
03:06:29,691 --> 03:06:32,330
snakes,
shoot them to Mars out of our robot.

4458
03:06:32,331 --> 03:06:33,950
Dick.
We can't beat an avalanche though,

4459
03:06:34,850 --> 03:06:35,720
Ken,
if you're not there.

4460
03:06:35,750 --> 03:06:39,620
Oh,
don't go near where it gets avalanchey

4461
03:06:43,310 --> 03:06:47,360
in the sting.
