1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,910
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,331
Well,

3
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:05,160
it's like we were talking
about virtual reality.

4
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:05,521
We're like,

5
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:07,230
how long before they made a porn,

6
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,490
I mean when the moment
they came up with Oculus,

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,950
we knew like it's a matter of time,

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,091
matter of time,

9
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,300
and they did it and they did it.

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,560
Oh,

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,560
it is going to create some
fucking hilarious earthquakes
and a lot of different

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,270
relationships and marriages because
people are going to have to uh,

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,880
define whether or not fucking a
Hologram is a form of infidelity.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,110
Like you're going to have
to make a rule for that in,

15
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,410
in your relationship.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,210
Is it okay to fuck a Hologram?

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,470
Not Alive,

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,580
not a person,

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,030
but looks like it's fucking you
looking you right in the eyes,

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,830
right in the fucking eyes.

21
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,101
Oh my God,

22
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:02,460
Dude.

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:02,910
Yeah.

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,770
It's pretty weird because your brain,

25
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:08,250
when a Hologram is looking at
you in the eyes in a loving way,

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,650
your brain doesn't reject it.

27
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:11,130
It's like,

28
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,611
oh wow.

29
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:12,900
I think this girl really likes me.

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,381
Oh wait,

31
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,370
it's a hologram.

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,580
But in one millisecond you get this
feeling of like strange connection,

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,760
which is a,

34
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:21,391
and again,

35
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:24,000
we're in the most rudimentary parts of Vr,

36
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,530
only apparently only,

37
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:26,221
I just read this,

38
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:27,630
it might've been a dated article,

39
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,920
but only 100,000 people
or so on and HTC vive,

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,840
if that's drastically off you guys.

41
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:34,351
I'm sorry,

42
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:37,620
but not a lot of people
have VR goggles right now.

43
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,240
So not a lot of people.

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,420
And there's a lot of us who are fucking
ear beating people at parties who

45
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,970
clearly just don't want to hear about
it anymore than you want to hear about

46
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,500
someone talking about it dream.

47
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,490
But there's a huge group of people right
now that are having some of the most

48
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:57,960
psychedelic mind bending
experience is through technology.

49
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,650
And they can't even talk about it or
describe it to people because when you

50
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:02,281
describe it,

51
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,870
it's like you're talking about a dream,

52
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,531
but you're like,

53
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:04,741
no,

54
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,710
this is happening to
a lot of us right now.

55
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:12,711
We're going into alternate dimensions
via technology and hanging out there,

56
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,310
enjoying it,

57
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,190
experiencing the freedom,

58
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,820
uh,

59
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,820
from the confines of being constantly
in an infinitely located in whatever

60
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:30,390
physical space your body happens to be
inhabiting to suddenly remove that weight

61
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:35,391
and how I can pop these things on and
instantly translocate to some art universe

62
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:39,420
that some geniuses created.

63
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,530
Fuck around.

64
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,790
Shoot Arrows,

65
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,440
wander through Minecraft,

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,510
have sex with two,

67
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,230
uh,

68
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,710
girls who I always apparently going to
throw out of my house if they didn't fuck

69
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,130
me.

70
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,240
That's what the porn is.

71
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:52,510
I have

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,520
never do that.

73
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,750
But in this universe,

74
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:58,920
I guess that's what I do.

75
00:02:59,470 --> 00:02:59,890
Yeah.

76
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,100
So the kind of rapey what
is not rapey it's just like,

77
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:03,461
please,

78
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,600
I don't have money for the rent.

79
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,710
Can I suck your Dick?

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,490
Oh,

81
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:06,971
you know,

82
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,110
it's her idea.

83
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:08,800
Oh yeah.

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,390
You're not saying you're not raping her.

85
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:11,111
It's not like,

86
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:11,351
look,

87
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:13,310
you gotta you gotta give
up some pussy otherwise,

88
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,530
otherwise I'm kicking you in the street.

89
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,920
You could say it if you want.

90
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:16,661
And to the porn.

91
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:16,901
I mean,

92
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,160
you could say whatever you want.

93
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:18,994
Wait a minute.

94
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,020
You have a microphone?

95
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,160
Yeah,

96
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,891
I'm a microphone,

97
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,870
but you can talk to it if
you want to be a Weirdo.

98
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,763
Is there,

99
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:24,941
but,

100
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:25,301
okay.

101
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,800
How long before you can talk to it,

102
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,390
how long before it talks back to you?

103
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,470
Well that's,

104
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,131
you're going to look,

105
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:31,350
you're looking at like a,

106
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,450
so we got to figure out a way to either,

107
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:39,451
I mean I imagine that probably exists
in some rudimentary way for some kind of

108
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:41,470
CGI style porn,

109
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:46,120
but to be able to like instantaneously
communicate with live video porn,

110
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:49,690
you're going to need some kind of AI
that I don't think we probably have just

111
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,190
yet or we are probably on the PR,

112
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,671
but yes,

113
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:52,504
that will happen.

114
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,201
Oh,

115
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,340
that's definitely gonna happen.

116
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,010
I've watched x Mckenna again
on the plane the other day.

117
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,570
I watched it for the second time.

118
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,111
That's cool.

119
00:03:59,111 --> 00:03:59,771
It's just as good.

120
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:00,604
The second time.

121
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,470
That movie freaks me out,

122
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:03,280
man.

123
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,910
Why?

124
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,670
Because the girl's so
beautiful and she's so,

125
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,170
she's so attractive.

126
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,071
Like you,

127
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,090
you know that guy.

128
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,780
You could see as much as he
knew that she was a robot.

129
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:17,040
As much as he knew that
he wasn't a robot as much,

130
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,880
as much as he knew that
she was artificial,

131
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,320
he was in love with her and she was
amazing and it seemed like she cared about

132
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,420
him and when she was
talking to him for real,

133
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:27,430
like when the lights went
out and the camera was down,

134
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,264
spoiler alert,

135
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,051
and she was like,

136
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:29,884
don't trust him.

137
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,491
I'm like,

138
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,600
this is like a real person.

139
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,680
It's a real person.

140
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,850
She's thinking like a person.

141
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,200
It's a person and he's like completely
locked into this idea that it's a person.

142
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,190
He's hitting a time.

143
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,060
It's a person.

144
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,110
I mean I don't,

145
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,760
this whole distinction between artificial
intelligence and intelligence is the

146
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:49,210
same as the distinction between
virtual reality and reality.

147
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,410
It's just like another human attempt
to be in control of something.

148
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,070
You want to,

149
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,581
you want to say,

150
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:54,731
Oh,

151
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,440
I'll tell you if this is
fucking reality or not.

152
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,010
Oh,

153
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,690
this is virtual reality.

154
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,220
This isn't reality reality.

155
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:00,580
But it's like,

156
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,400
oh really?

157
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,960
So realities compartmentalized
into places where there's,

158
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,840
if something is created by a human,

159
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,441
oh no,

160
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,850
that's not real reality.

161
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,320
Even though humans are reality.

162
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,880
Reality is reality.

163
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,220
Intelligence is intelligence because
the intelligence is inhabiting something

164
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,570
that isn't the human vessel.

165
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,820
It goes back to what we
were talking about earlier,

166
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,331
what,

167
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:26,680
because it's not in a fucking meat
body now it's artificial intelligence.

168
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:29,080
How is why intelligence is intelligence,

169
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,840
but here's my weirdness about all this.

170
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,800
You know we were talking about language
and the limitations of language and the

171
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,310
eventuality of a virtual reality and I
wonder how we're going to digest data and

172
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,670
information in a virtual world.

173
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,940
Like if people decide like what if you
decide that you want to read books in a

174
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:52,570
virtual world,

175
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,400
this is how you want to read books.

176
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,560
The way you want to read books is
what your feet up on the couch in your

177
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:58,400
mansion,

178
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,540
in your virtual world.

179
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,890
All these girls around you like finger
banging themselves with a high heels on

180
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:05,510
and Queens fat bottom girls,

181
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:06,530
you make a rock in the world,

182
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,030
go round plays in the background share,

183
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,310
and you get to sit down and
read books in a virtual world.

184
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,653
What happens then?

185
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,500
Like what?

186
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,810
What happens when you're watching
movies in a virtual world?

187
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,970
Well then that's probably,

188
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,313
that'd be stupid.

189
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,940
I think the movies would be,

190
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,930
they would exist.

191
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,990
I think movies in a virtual world,

192
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,050
they're definitely coming.

193
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:24,231
Right?

194
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:24,741
And they're going to,

195
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:26,000
you're going to exist in the world.

196
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,410
Like you're not gonna sit
down and watch a movie.

197
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,060
Oh No.

198
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,660
They have a great theory theaters
in Vr now you can sit down,

199
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,040
put on a movie and watch it on the,

200
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,450
unlike a massive screen
in VR there I went to,

201
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:38,284
don't you think,

202
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,620
why do they do that as their limitations
in the medium where they can't have it?

203
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,310
Uh,

204
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,960
the movie play out in front of you.

205
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,550
Like if you went to see jaws,

206
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,340
right?

207
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,451
Oh,

208
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:47,090
I know.

209
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,570
It's kind of Nice to watch
a movie floating in space.

210
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,480
I don't mind that the virtue of you,

211
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,610
there's an app called virtual
desktop where you like,

212
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,060
you put on your VR goggles and suddenly
your desktop is wrapped around you,

213
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,500
a giant screen,

214
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:08,530
giant screen wrapped around you that you
then can like pull up any kind of movie

215
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:10,820
you might want to watch.

216
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,400
And so you just like can
sit in there and why.

217
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,720
And if you look down,

218
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,240
you see space.

219
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,530
Yeah.

220
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,041
That's it.

221
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,110
Virtual desk that now the problem with Vr,

222
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,130
when you look at that,

223
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,120
the problem with Vr,

224
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,450
like people looking at it on the Internet
is it you cannot convey how fucking

225
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:32,000
cool it looks from looking at it that way.

226
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,590
Like it is suddenly there's this
massive thing in front of you.

227
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:37,640
The space look real.

228
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,960
What the space will grill.

229
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,710
Um,

230
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,543
it,

231
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,100
it looks real enough pretty.

232
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,910
I wouldn't say that.

233
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,210
I mean,

234
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,640
I wouldn't say really realistic.

235
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
I think there are probably some,

236
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:52,330
there's got to be by now some three
60 videos that are actually from that,

237
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:53,864
from Hubble.

238
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,940
But it looks good enough
where you're like,

239
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,840
this is fucking awesome.

240
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,500
Incredible.

241
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,651
Well.

242
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:00,650
What's the benefit of like they're
just watching you play a video game.

243
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:04,070
What's the benefit and playing a video
game on a screen in a virtual world

244
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:06,740
instead of playing the video
game in the virtual world?

245
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,250
Well,

246
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:07,850
I think,

247
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,710
but honestly in that case,

248
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:10,191
I don't know,

249
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:10,610
like I've,

250
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,170
I started a game up in
there and just like,

251
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:12,750
fuck this,

252
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,940
but do you hear what you
see what I'm saying here?

253
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:15,770
Because like he's clicking
and menus and stuff.

254
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,000
He's using it like a computer.

255
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,320
Yeah.

256
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,131
I think it's a,

257
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,940
I don't know if the benefit is
the right thing to look for there.

258
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:23,630
It's just,

259
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,630
it's just bad ass to like suddenly be
completely immersed in a new environment

260
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,400
doing like whatever the work is that you
want to do that with virtual desktop.

261
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,310
I just use it to watch documentaries

262
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,500
about bleeding,

263
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,510
but what I'm thinking is like,

264
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,740
would you rather like,

265
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,130
okay,

266
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,180
like they're perfect example.

267
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:45,110
You're looking at a screen,

268
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:45,291
right?

269
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:45,370
Yeah.

270
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,230
Clearly a floating screen if you
watch jaws and that floating screen,

271
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,090
that would not be as good as if you were
sitting in your living on when you're

272
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:51,720
looking down,

273
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,450
you were on the boat with Roy Scheider.

274
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:53,931
Well he was like,

275
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:54,764
we're gonna need a bigger one.

276
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,210
Oh mean like if there was like a VR jaws,

277
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,840
yes.

278
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,171
Oh yeah,

279
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:58,981
that'd be fucking cool.

280
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:00,120
It just doesn't exist yet.

281
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,480
Right.

282
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,500
But that's what I'm saying,

283
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,180
like that's going to happen.

284
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,510
Right?

285
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,290
Of course.

286
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:04,621
Yeah,

287
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,630
that'll definitely happen for sure.

288
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,530
No question.

289
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,450
And when they do things like that,

290
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,560
like will you be able to enjoy
other things in that world?

291
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,090
Like will you be able
to go into that world?

292
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:16,110
Like here we're in the Swiss Alps,

293
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:17,970
where the fuck we are in a fake world?

294
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,990
Would you be able to go to this
place and put on a an an a,

295
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,940
a podcast?

296
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,700
Like would you be able to
like look down at your phone,

297
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,790
find the Duncan Trussell family hour and
start streaming it live on your phone

298
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,830
while you're skiing down the
side of this virtual hill?

299
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,853
Be able to do.

300
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:36,630
There's,

301
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,463
you could already do,

302
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,850
you could already do that.

303
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,331
Yeah.

304
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:39,571
Look,

305
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:39,841
I mean,

306
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:40,321
look man,

307
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:45,321
this is like Rick and Morty is video
game is in Vr is accepting that you're in

308
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,470
VR and they're there.

309
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:49,801
Yeah.

310
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:51,450
There's like there's a,

311
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:53,110
there's all kinds of shit
you could do in there.

312
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,851
Like for example,

313
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:54,061
man,

314
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:54,451
there's a,

315
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:55,284
um,

316
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,080
in one of these games called
fantastic contraption,

317
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,870
which is one of the most site dude show,

318
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:02,130
split reality,

319
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:03,360
fantastic contraption.

320
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:07,220
If you looked at this where people have
managed to put up a green screen so that

321
00:10:07,221 --> 00:10:10,230
and interpolate the two videos.

322
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:12,120
So it looks like you're
actually in the game.

323
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,470
That's the clothes show.

324
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:15,420
That fantastic contraption is this.

325
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,060
Everything in there is
fucking psychedelic.

326
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,051
But check this out.

327
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,420
When you see people in the,

328
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,010
in the reality itself,

329
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:23,851
yeah.

330
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:24,660
There you go.

331
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,260
Whoa.

332
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,130
Watch what he does.

333
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:27,290
So this guy's walking around.

334
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,350
This is what he's seeing.

335
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,760
So what we're looking at and where we,

336
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,350
he seen does this gonna
we're gonna kicked off.

337
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,430
Use Youtube for this.

338
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,900
You don't need the audio.

339
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,370
Don't know audio please.

340
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,683
I'm worried.

341
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,170
So this guy's moving around
and while he's moving around,

342
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,640
he's doing a bunch of stuff.

343
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,650
He's got a battery on this one though,

344
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:44,101
for sure.

345
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:44,934
There's like,

346
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,280
well it takes to explain to the people
that are listening what we're saying.

347
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,010
Oh yeah,

348
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,580
you're just seeing like
in fantastic contraption.

349
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,241
What is that?

350
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:52,490
What is fantastic contraption?

351
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,250
You're in this like weird putting green
and you'd have to build these amazing

352
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,130
devices to um,

353
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:58,890
Eh,

354
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,370
the way,

355
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,450
unfortunately these videos,

356
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,450
you're not seeing the guy
actually form the shit.

357
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:04,284
Like watch this.

358
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,601
What am I watching?

359
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,160
Dunkin people are listening.

360
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,150
Uh,

361
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,870
sorry.

362
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,351
You're seeing,

363
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:10,741
look at this.

364
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:11,340
Look at this.

365
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,340
You have to stretch out these like tubes
to build this weird device that you

366
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:19,590
like then automates itself to try to,

367
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,040
I mean,

368
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,611
honest to God,

369
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:21,211
talking about it,

370
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:22,620
you feel like a fucking,

371
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:25,750
you're listening to an eight year old
talk about a drawing that they made.

372
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,310
Like what?

373
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,750
What are you talking about?

374
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,090
It's impossible to convey.

375
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,030
It's a game and it's a game
where this guy is moving.

376
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,920
He's got devices in his hand and then
devices move things in the virtual world.

377
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,440
He's holding onto these
two like a controllers.

378
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,400
But this is not a good,

379
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,690
if you look up car doesn't matter.

380
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:44,730
It's pretty fucking fucking cool.

381
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,480
Yeah.

382
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,560
You'll see it on Friday.

383
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:47,131
I'll show you.

384
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:49,080
I've got us and what we
need to talk about his porn.

385
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,150
What's that like Duncan?

386
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,410
What's it like in this world?

387
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,513
What's it like?

388
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,401
So,

389
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:55,234
um,

390
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,760
I mean it's like I'll tell you
something even better than porn man.

391
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,533
Um,

392
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,040
here's what's really cool about VR
that I don't think a lot of people have

393
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:06,551
caught onto.

394
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:07,690
Maybe a few of them have.

395
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,860
Cause the porn of course is amazing.

396
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,903
It is.

397
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,081
It is.

398
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:18,370
If anything is going to drive VR
and I hope everything drives Vr,

399
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,550
it's going to be the fucking porn because
the porn that is shot for Vr is very,

400
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:31,270
very close to like experiencing
having sex with someone,

401
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,340
obviously minus the body,

402
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:33,910
right?

403
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,750
There's nobody there.

404
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:35,680
There's nobody there.

405
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,980
But it's amazing and it's going to cause
a lot of great and hilarious problems.

406
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,900
And I'm excited to hear the outrage that
comes from the world when people start

407
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:51,901
realizing that every single person on
earth now has access not just to in a

408
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,430
voyeuristic way witnessing,

409
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,410
uh,

410
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,000
Ooh,

411
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,450
that,

412
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,880
that I'm telling you man,

413
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,570
that is,

414
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,403
that's

415
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,870
this girl's acids and sane and
so she's right in front of you,

416
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:03,261
but this is,

417
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:05,330
they're not doing a good job
with us cause it's got to,

418
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,540
oh,

419
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,380
that's just how it,

420
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:07,951
yeah,

421
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:08,191
you,

422
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:08,490
you,

423
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,910
you have to use virtual desktop to
bring those two things together.

424
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:16,911
Like the porn that you download
is broken up and stereoscopic.

425
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,620
So the VR goggles bring it together

426
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,221
to kill you.

427
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:23,450
You have to get specific programs
that are designed for this,

428
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:24,284
right?

429
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,270
Yeah.

430
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,260
Like a,

431
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:26,621
yeah,

432
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:28,240
just Google search reddit.

433
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,460
How not to watch VR porn

434
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,850
guys that are watching it.

435
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:34,550
Like we're watching this guy who
is sitting on his bed and like,

436
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:37,130
he's looks like he's doing everything
to keep from coming in his pants.

437
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,241
He's lab like,

438
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:39,650
I don't ever watch porn like that.

439
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,770
There's like sheer joy and
him watching that porn,

440
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,780
like what you're talking
about is something that's
very different than watching

441
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,810
a two dimensional screen.

442
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,310
It's,

443
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,360
it's as different as sax and
watching a two dimensional screen,

444
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,880
except there's no body there.

445
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:55,091
I mean,

446
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:56,800
you are in,

447
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,311
you look,

448
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:58,690
or you can look around,

449
00:13:58,691 --> 00:13:59,524
you can like,

450
00:13:59,560 --> 00:13:59,981
you know,

451
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:00,940
like for example,

452
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,650
let's say there was a,

453
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,671
and by the way,

454
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:05,080
I'm not doing this shit.

455
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,730
A friend of mine watches it,

456
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,630
but let's say,

457
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,820
let's say that there was a,

458
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:10,450
um,

459
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,620
let's say that there was a,

460
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:12,290
uh,

461
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:12,520
uh,

462
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,060
in a,

463
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,770
in a VR porn experience,

464
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,671
there's a girl,

465
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:20,650
he's giving you a blow job while another
girl is shoving her pussy in your face.

466
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,430
You can actually look
up and see her pussy,

467
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,390
not her pussy.

468
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,880
You can look around
her pussy and see that,

469
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,740
see your face looking down at you,

470
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,510
just like it was really happening.

471
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,550
So that's Vr porn.

472
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,713
That's what it's,

473
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,640
you can look at her pussy and then you
can go back to the other girls talking.

474
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:38,001
Your Dick,

475
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:38,834
you give,

476
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,681
you can move anywhere.

477
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,240
You could stare at her
feet if you're a Weirdo

478
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,600
or not,

479
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,250
if you just were a fan of feet

480
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,063
either way,

481
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,000
either way.

482
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,481
Either way.

483
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:48,870
It's,

484
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,440
it's,

485
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,711
it's,

486
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:50,910
and it's a game changer.

487
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:51,950
It's a game changer,

488
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:52,191
man.

489
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:56,090
It's a game changer and it's one of
the many freedoms the virtual reality's

490
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,050
offering people.

491
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,700
It's like you are saying,

492
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,440
who wants to,

493
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,691
you know,

494
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:04,520
like even just watching a movie in
two D in your virtual reality room,

495
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,110
it's pretty awesome.

496
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,210
Maybe you don't have
the greatest apartment,

497
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:08,840
right?

498
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,840
But you put on VR goggles and suddenly
your apartment has transformed into a,

499
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,460
into a massive,

500
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,830
beautiful space.

501
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,390
And the HTC vive,

502
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:24,170
it comes with like Vr home and
there's two different versions.

503
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:26,360
But when you go into this space,

504
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,960
you feel that same sense of expansiveness
that you get from being in a big

505
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,014
space.

506
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:33,471
It's,

507
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:34,730
your body's still like,

508
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:35,750
feels like it's,

509
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,710
you know,

510
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,400
you're in a,

511
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,400
you still feel that weird sense of
freedom that you feel when you're in a big

512
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,940
space and you're not there.

513
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,230
It's beautiful,

514
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:45,501
man.

515
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:48,020
It's like one of the most liberating,

516
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,120
incredible technologies.

517
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,690
I think that a lot,

518
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,490
some people are giving it a little bit
of a hard time right now because they see

519
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:59,900
the game from Youtube and they
think those graphics look like Shit.

520
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,891
But let me tell you,

521
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:01,724
man,

522
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,740
do Minecraft and Vr like I,

523
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,250
they,

524
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,860
I did Minecraft in Vr.

525
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,140
I play my graft at VR regularly now.

526
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,390
But you do Minecraft and Vr and when
suddenly you're perched on the edge of a

527
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:19,391
cliff looking down on some
hyper colored underground river,

528
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,070
your body initially reacts in the same
way or reacts to being at the edge of a

529
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:25,904
real cliff.

530
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,170
Your balance gets weird.

531
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:27,411
You're like,

532
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:27,801
fuck,

533
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:28,160
fuck,

534
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,940
fuck.

535
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,320
It's that real.

536
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,400
That's the vive.

537
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:35,900
The HTC vive is in fucking saying,

538
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,770
Jesus,

539
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,000
I can't wait to show you man.

540
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:38,834
It's like,

541
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,100
it just works.

542
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,610
It doesn't,

543
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,600
it doesn't mess up.

544
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,390
Like anytime I want to now I can go.

545
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:44,840
Like I've,

546
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,840
I've made a room in my house where now
I can just put on these goggles and I'm

547
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,980
instantly in.

548
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,010
Oh fucking,

549
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,840
there's a game called Hover junkers,

550
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,430
which is so fun.

551
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,021
So you,

552
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:57,854
um,

553
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,090
you,

554
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,390
you could,

555
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,230
you could probably pull it up.

556
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,360
You ride around like it knows how big
the spaces that what's called your place

557
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:06,920
space that knows how big it is.

558
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,220
So you're riding in a craft in this place,

559
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:15,221
space shooting weapons at people
flying around in these other things.

560
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,390
Yeah.

561
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,510
It's so you could like,

562
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:20,390
you could all go in your
garage and you could,

563
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:20,661
uh,

564
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:24,320
the garage would become the environment
where you're playing your game.

565
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:24,891
Oh yeah.

566
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:25,191
Man,

567
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:26,690
you're not in your garage anymore.

568
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,420
You're flying around in that
fucking thing shooting at people,

569
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,790
which means you actually
have to be good at shooting.

570
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,590
Like you have to be able to aim,

571
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,480
this isn't like pressing buttons.

572
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:38,690
Like you need to know how to
fire at least at some Sunday.

573
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,580
What are you holding
you holding a fake gun?

574
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:40,821
No,

575
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:44,120
you're holding these controllers
that feel exactly like a fucking,

576
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:47,450
they feel very close to a gun
and it's got haptic technology.

577
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,590
So when you're shooting,

578
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:49,424
it's,

579
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,620
I wonder if this would actually
teach you how to shoot better.

580
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,200
They have a,

581
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
they have a great archery program.

582
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:55,640
Is,

583
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,030
is it making your art tree better?

584
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,080
Uh,

585
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,430
it's making me not do
archery because just do it.

586
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,970
It's way easier.

587
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,150
Are you good at it?

588
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,280
Are you good at this archery?

589
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,540
Yeah,

590
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,500
it me doing real archery jet definitely
translated into me playing look up the,

591
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,030
I'm sorry to keep asking
you to look up stuff.

592
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:12,510
Jamie.

593
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,190
Look up,

594
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,650
uh,

595
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,483
archery.

596
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,650
The lab VR.

597
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,750
This is one of my
favorite archery programs.

598
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,970
They also have a VR boxing,

599
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:22,080
which I haven't tried yet,

600
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:26,670
but which I'm excited about because
that seems like you could really train

601
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,230
people to learn how to box.

602
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,191
Let's see.

603
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm just,

604
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,020
I don't know if this is,

605
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,201
yeah,

606
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:36,531
that's,

607
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:40,900
that's a different archery program
than the one that look up the lab.

608
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,140
Ah,

609
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,531
fuck.

610
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:43,660
It's,

611
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,750
it's valve look up valve archery.

612
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:46,584
Vr.

613
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,571
Now there is,

614
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:48,721
yeah.

615
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:50,550
This one's a really fucking fun man.

616
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:51,741
Yeah,

617
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:53,750
this one is fucking cool.

618
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,951
You just shoot it.

619
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:56,850
These little guys who were
trying to infiltrate your,

620
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,180
oh,

621
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,020
so you're shooting at things.

622
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:00,590
Yeah.

623
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,120
And it's so game.

624
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,510
Yeah.

625
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,231
My God.

626
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:04,820
And you are you pulling a bow back?

627
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:04,941
Like,

628
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:05,840
what are you doing in your head?

629
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:07,250
So you have two controllers,

630
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,390
you're pulling them back.

631
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:09,131
There's haptics,

632
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,080
so it vibrates according to this,

633
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,040
the tension of the bow string.

634
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,390
And then when you want an Arrow,

635
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:18,290
you're reaching behind your back and
pulling it from behind your back.is nuts,

636
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:18,471
man.

637
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:18,771
Yeah,

638
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:19,620
it's so fun.

639
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:23,120
I wonder if it actually could
help your archery skill for sure.

640
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,390
The only problem is it's really
weird because you get used to like,

641
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,410
um,

642
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,050
it's different because
you use a compound bow,

643
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:29,421
but you know,

644
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:29,721
you get,

645
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:29,901
you know,

646
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:30,061
it's,

647
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:30,681
it's kind of same.

648
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:31,760
You get used to like,

649
00:19:31,761 --> 00:19:34,820
I have a place on my cheek
where I put my point.

650
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,020
The anchor point changes cause
the goggles right up here.

651
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,950
So you have to get new anchor point.

652
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,320
But it's still pretty fucking fun.

653
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,041
I mean,

654
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:47,420
how often you get to shoot at things
in and like an archery range like this?

655
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:47,811
Yeah,

656
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,830
this is wild.

657
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:49,640
And I wonder,

658
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,270
that means they should definitely be
able to do something like this for a like

659
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:54,170
compound balls.

660
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,710
Oh yeah,

661
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,180
definitely go deer hunting with it.

662
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,120
There's another archery program
that you can get on steam.

663
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,500
That looks pretty cool.

664
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,100
Uh,

665
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,420
I can't remember the name of it though,

666
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:04,550
but it looks a little bit more,

667
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,241
I guess,

668
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:06,074
realistic.

669
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:06,321
Well,

670
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:07,580
they have an archery program.

671
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,450
See if he could find his archery program
where you shoot at us a virtual screen.

672
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,000
You actually shoot a real bow at uh,

673
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,370
these images on a screen and this,

674
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:17,030
uh,

675
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,600
like you,

676
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,410
you go to like in front of like a giant
movie theater type thing and you stand

677
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:23,420
in front of this thing and
these animals walked by.

678
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:23,541
Oh,

679
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,021
that's cool.

680
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:27,560
And they run from you and they hide and
you got to sneak up on them and shoot

681
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,394
arrows at them.

682
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:28,761
I mean,

683
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,830
I'm sure this will be translated into VR.

684
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:31,341
And I'll tell you,

685
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:32,120
Joe,

686
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,720
if I was,

687
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,590
if I were a young man,

688
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,570
I would be developing shit for Vr.

689
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:35,840
Right?

690
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,650
Developing.

691
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,161
Yeah.

692
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:37,881
God Damn it.

693
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:38,900
It's not a developer.

694
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,913
I would,

695
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,300
there's so many ideas that you will
have when you try these goggles on where

696
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:44,781
you're going to be like,

697
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:44,931
this.

698
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:45,140
Ha,

699
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,700
this needs to exist in the world.

700
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,820
Get this shit developed man,

701
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:50,230
because it's going to like,

702
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,710
there's so many things that once
you experience it where like,

703
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:53,891
oh,

704
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:55,090
someone needs to build this.

705
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,800
Someone like for example,

706
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,370
a fucking boxing game,

707
00:20:58,371 --> 00:21:00,010
he's nodding in the,

708
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:00,850
in the one hour,

709
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:02,500
I think I got a demonstration of it.

710
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,580
I was just sitting there asking the guy,

711
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:05,290
so what about when we're,

712
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,140
someone gets a hold of this and they
start thinking about doing this thing and

713
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,380
what about when rockstar gets it and then
they start thinking about making grand

714
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,010
theft auto this way.

715
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,221
It's like,

716
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:12,590
yes,

717
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,261
you're exactly,

718
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:14,350
your brain just take,

719
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,423
well,

720
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,200
fallout is coming for the vive,

721
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:18,700
which is going to be pretty fucking cool.

722
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,050
But dude for the,

723
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:24,670
and they have like a a boxing program
that looks like it's still in development,

724
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:29,930
but a fucking a real boxing
program because it tracks
the controllers perfectly

725
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:31,720
in real time.

726
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,280
So you could actually learn how to box.

727
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,143
Yes,

728
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,030
someone needs to build a real,

729
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,620
not only learn how to box,

730
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,250
but you could train with the great
boxers like you could throw kicks to.

731
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:42,641
Well,

732
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,200
you would have to have
something on your foot.

733
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,550
You'd have to have another edition.

734
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:47,710
It was like that could
be done boots right?

735
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,060
Easily man.

736
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,440
Easily kind of sneakers.

737
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,510
You get a great fucking workout too.

738
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:52,781
Oh,

739
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:53,181
I'm sure.

740
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:55,390
Remember when people were
doing dance dance revolution,

741
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,230
they lost tons of weight.

742
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,680
Yeah,

743
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,680
there was a huge thing a lot of guys lost
and gals lost a ton of weight off that

744
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:03,290
dance dance revolution again,

745
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,480
cause it was so fun to do.

746
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,051
Well,

747
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:08,950
that's what's funny about Vr is that
right now when people think of a video

748
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,823
Gamer,

749
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,510
they don't,

750
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,770
you're not going to hear someone say,

751
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:14,440
oh they are lean and Tan
and they like her deck.

752
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,700
They have such dexterity.

753
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,870
But now when you think of
someone who's great at Vr,

754
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,880
they're gonna.

755
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,060
You gotta be in fucking jail.

756
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,650
There's the box and program.

757
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,730
I'm going to download it.

758
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:27,250
The creators of this or seem
like they're super cool.

759
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,620
I think I could get a
good workout with this.

760
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,730
They have VR pool top.

761
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:31,210
Good.

762
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,850
Well I don't want that pools for real.

763
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,571
But see,

764
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:37,930
the thing about this is this is something
that you could do on your own and get

765
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:38,621
a workout in.

766
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:38,940
What I,

767
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,850
what I find interesting about this too
is you could tune a dude up and you don't

768
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:45,520
feel bad about it right now.

769
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,990
What you need to do eventually is they're
going to have something that looks

770
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:50,351
like this,

771
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:51,161
but it's a robot.

772
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,090
Like both things.

773
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,940
Like you have an a thing
that you can actually hit.

774
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,930
Well now you could just,

775
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:56,860
you could already,

776
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,300
I'm sure there's a way that
you could hang a bag and um,

777
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:01,690
cause like,

778
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:01,931
okay,

779
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:02,980
so when I,

780
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:03,814
um,

781
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,100
when I'm talking about southern,

782
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,943
the hits back,

783
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,551
well,

784
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:06,940
yeah,

785
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,480
that's,

786
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:07,810
that,

787
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,430
that's going to be something that

788
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,770
it doesn't have to have a lot of power.

789
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,040
They could have like a really mushy
arm and it knows how to move the way,

790
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,460
the way you move,

791
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,390
like it's actually a
throwing punches at you.

792
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:21,530
So if it hits you,

793
00:23:21,531 --> 00:23:22,540
it's not hurting you.

794
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,391
You know what that could be,

795
00:23:23,391 --> 00:23:23,810
man,

796
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:28,810
it could be like a haptic face mask
that registers the punch and vibrates so

797
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,860
that you could feel it,

798
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,371
you know,

799
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:31,491
and,

800
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:32,810
and wherever it hits you.

801
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:38,550
But it also could be like some sort of
a robot that has inflatable arms and the

802
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:42,190
inflatable arms move with the program.

803
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,070
So as you're looking at
Apollo creed in front of you,

804
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,180
when he snaps his jab out at you pop,

805
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,810
he is,

806
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,870
he's throwing this like spongy,

807
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,340
almost like a inflatable raft balloon arm.

808
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:55,581
You know,

809
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:56,540
like when you're little kids.

810
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,230
Yeah.

811
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,760
Inflatable balloon toys.

812
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,270
Yeah.

813
00:23:59,270 --> 00:23:59,750
Like that.

814
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,740
Like it's not gonna hurt you at all.

815
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:01,990
It's just going to touch your face.

816
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,170
It'd be fucking incredible.

817
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,610
And,

818
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,700
and what's in,

819
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:05,421
what you're going to see,

820
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:05,720
man,

821
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,640
is people are going to get
really good at this shit.

822
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,930
Like if you're good at shooting and VR
minus like the half to the gun and the

823
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:15,590
real kick of whatever gun in the real
world are you using [inaudible] it's going

824
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:16,424
to translate.

825
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:26,470
Okay.
