1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,640
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,840
Do you being famous?

3
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:05,750
Do you compare it to not being
famous very much anymore?

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,063
Um,

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,760
meaning like do you go like fuck,

6
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,160
do you want today to go fuck,

7
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:11,330
I wish I could just,

8
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:15,460
I wish it were 1990 I wish I
had the identity of 1990 no,

9
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:16,510
you know how I look at it,

10
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:19,510
it's just a bunch of people
being nice for the most part.

11
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,920
It's like what are you putting out there?

12
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,880
How I have opinions about things and I
joke around about things like the last

13
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:28,300
bad energy that I got was when I was
making fun of some dude in the country

14
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:29,134
music awards,

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,960
but homeboy was standing
in front of a jet plane,

16
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:35,680
a country music song with jeans
that had like cut rips on them,

17
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,750
like on purpose,

18
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:38,620
like all over them.

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,251
And I was like,

20
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:39,731
come on,

21
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:40,210
that's,

22
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,930
that's fucking ridiculous there.

23
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,100
Right?

24
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,370
You were none of them on a,

25
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,351
on Twitter.

26
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:47,440
I couldn't stop goofing on him
goofing on those genes and that.

27
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:50,920
I was even admitted that I wear a fanny
pack and I have a wallet chain and I'm

28
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:51,970
still goofing on that.

29
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,210
Like that's the stupidest fucking jeans
were like one day we're going to look

30
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:55,841
back at those genes.

31
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:56,890
This is country music,

32
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:57,370
man.

33
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,320
Country Music is supposed
to be Merle haggard,

34
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,250
Johnny Cash.

35
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:02,860
And you know that that's
like real country music.

36
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:03,731
This is like,

37
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,211
this is not,

38
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:05,200
that's not real country.

39
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,580
You're standing in front of a jet.

40
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,620
The fuck are you doing in front of a jet?

41
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,360
What are you doing like in a hanger?

42
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,590
Like he's playing overseas,

43
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:16,060
like mere for overseas with the boys I'm
getting from the Jetta supports troops.

44
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,013
Oh,

45
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,480
like an f 15 and something.

46
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,260
Exactly.

47
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,290
And it's like what?

48
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,690
What are you doing there?

49
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,460
I don't know if the whole
show was in front of a jet.

50
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:26,800
They might've done the whole country
music awards in front of a jet,

51
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,060
which would have been awesome.

52
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,980
I don't know if the sets changed,

53
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,461
you know?

54
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:31,420
I really have no idea.

55
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:32,770
I only watched it for a little bit,

56
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:33,400
but it was,

57
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,690
I made a joke that country music
awards hates black people so much.

58
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,010
They won't even use black microphones
cause it was a red microphone,

59
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,700
a lawyer.

60
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,130
I was like,

61
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,840
it was last time you saw a red microphone.

62
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,190
Funny Cause I will shit on
stuff online and I'm like,

63
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:52,180
well am I at a certain like we're comics
and then a certain point it's like

64
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:52,991
Wendy and go,

65
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:53,510
I don't,

66
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,830
I don't want to make fun
of that or I don't know.

67
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,891
It's hard man.

68
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:00,950
Because I always want to say what's
funny and what I would say amongst my

69
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:02,590
friends who wouldn't judge me like that,

70
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,280
that we could all be talking like,

71
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,830
like per perfect example,

72
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:07,461
Amy Schumer,

73
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,130
when Amy Schumer's on yesterday
and we were talking to her,

74
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,300
we were,

75
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,060
we were joking around about her
mother possibly being a cunt.

76
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:14,930
And I'm like,

77
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,880
how often do you,

78
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,271
are you,

79
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:16,551
you know,

80
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:19,700
you could just always go there
when you're with a bunch of comics,

81
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,830
you're all just sitting
around shit on each other.

82
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:24,860
You could always go to some terrible
place and we don't really think you mean

83
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:25,310
it.

84
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,660
I'm not going to call you on it.

85
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:27,980
I know you're just trying to be funny,

86
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,480
but saying something fucked up.

87
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,250
That's,

88
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:30,431
yeah,

89
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:32,260
that's like with the,

90
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,570
we talked about the n word last time,

91
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,404
but I was,

92
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,570
I was thinking about how comics,

93
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:40,420
I was thinking today how
my brother Kevin Comedian,

94
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,450
Kevin Brennan and a tell when I was like
in high school had a joke where if they

95
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,590
would like be on the
phone and they go like,

96
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:47,711
hey,

97
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:48,640
what's the weather like?

98
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:49,600
And he'd be like,

99
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,350
terrain and that'd be
like fucking daggers.

100
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,150
But somehow the blast,

101
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,640
I remote control the weather.

102
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,550
Oh and Hilarious,

103
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,413
right?

104
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,101
No,

105
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,090
of course you don't mean it.

106
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:05,290
And also the ID,

107
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,190
you're making fun of the idea
that most people just don't,

108
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,213
and that's how I got hired.

109
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,670
They just don't get hired and they won't,

110
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,940
they're not able to look
at life with layers.

111
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,240
Right.

112
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,890
And they can't see that
at the bottom of it.

113
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,210
It's supposed to be about intent,

114
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:19,841
you know,

115
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:20,470
and this is,

116
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,710
this is not just about white
guys that are throwing nay.

117
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,061
Yeah,

118
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:25,301
no,

119
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,021
it's just like,

120
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,630
or like you'll just go like water.

121
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,870
Cont yeah,

122
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,030
you got to know when someone is joking,

123
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,580
when it's obvious there's,

124
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,041
I mean there's certain people,

125
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,960
but some people will say
things in a crowd and like,

126
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,180
you'll be the only one that laughs and
there'll be like eight or nine people

127
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:41,290
that are really pissed off.

128
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,633
Come on.

129
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,430
He said something like Gilbert with the,

130
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:45,850
with the,

131
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,840
with the Geico ads and all the
Gilbert's jokes about the tsunami.

132
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,610
We're fucking hilarious.

133
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,340
They were like,

134
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:52,420
oh,

135
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,890
that was as he was fought by,

136
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,810
I was watching them in
real time going like,

137
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:55,991
boy,

138
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,550
these are fucking funny.

139
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,880
And then he'd gotten in trouble.

140
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,371
Oh,

141
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,170
well he went too quick,

142
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,390
too quick.

143
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,660
You couldn't even do that now.

144
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,120
You can't do tsunami too soon.

145
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,000
But they,

146
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,710
if you couldn't do it now,

147
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,080
because people don't remember it.
