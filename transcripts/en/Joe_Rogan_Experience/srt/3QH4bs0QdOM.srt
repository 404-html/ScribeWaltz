1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,230
We're sneaking this in on people.
They didn't even know.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,440
I just tweeted it just now.
Yeah,

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,810
we're sneaking it in.
Duncan trussell best way to do it.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,580
He thinks so that way for for people 
that didn't expect it and then just like

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,460
going through their little computer in 
the twitter comes up like,

6
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:25,461
oh my God,
I could watch a podcast with Duncan 

7
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:25,461
trussell now that's too sweet right 
there,

8
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:27,930
and he's got a solo hunter shirt on.
By the way,

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,460
don't get.
Duncan has gone.

10
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:33,960
Gangster poser,
poser hunter.

11
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:37,220
I'm wearing a hat and a hunting shirt 
and I had you been hunting?

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,150
I've been hunting more than.
Well,

13
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:43,080
I've been running a few times and I.
This is a controversial statement.

14
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:48,081
I think fishing is a form of haunting so
that it is now it's hunting for aliens.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,090
They don't even breathe our air.
I know they're weird.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,500
They breathe air or the water.
Yeah,

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,120
and you.
You know you got it.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,150
We just went fishing and we had those 
popping corks where you got to make the 

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,751
sign of a fish eating so that it's truly
trying to communicate with an alien 

20
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,550
because they hear that,
oh,

21
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:09,120
like a lure popper,
sal pop.

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,940
It sounds like when their grip grabbing 
bugs out this surface,

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,180
see you're communicating to them,
you're making their noises and then 

24
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,081
renting them out of their dementia and 
holding them and taking a picture with 

25
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,220
him because the ones we got were too 
small and throwing them back in.

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,410
Yeah.
I was with Ari and we,

27
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:27,390
uh,
went on the salmon run.

28
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,450
We caught some salmon in Alaska and it 
was one of the most bizarre experiences 

29
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:34,620
ever because you know that these 
animals,

30
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:39,621
they're going to die essentially.
They're swimming there so they can fuck 

31
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:39,670
and then die and you're,
you know,

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,910
you're taking part of it and they're all
over the place.

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,850
They were giant,
like we caught some like 30 pound,

34
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,460
40 pound salmon,
which is so fun.

35
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,200
I Love Sam and Matt.
That's the,

36
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,110
those are the,
that's the worst marathon of all time.

37
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,050
Which is you,
you fuck.

38
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,440
At the beginning of it,
right?

39
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:57,300
That's what it is.
You're fucking at the beginning and then

40
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:58,710
you're just running.
Don't fuck.

41
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,810
They never fuck.
They just come on eggs,

42
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:03,690
so you're just.
You're going upstream to jerk off,

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,960
jerking off all the way up while being 
ripped out of your universe by bears and

44
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,220
humans in birds.
Raptors are coming down.

45
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,730
Snap you out of the water.

46
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,810
Fucked up.
Can you imagine the last thing you hear 

47
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,410
is like the whoosh of air and slobbering
sound of a bear eating.

48
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,190
Just hearing your body crunched.
That's it.

49
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,420
And you flip it up.
This river trying to go up this little 

50
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,420
embankment,
just trying to get up to sort of 

51
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,700
waterfall,
just doing your best flopping around and

52
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:46,701
you get caught in midair by a monster 
wild dog that weighs 2000 pounds.

53
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,370
I bet there's salmon.
I bet there's like inspirational salmon 

54
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:52,950
speakers who was everyone's running.
They're like,

55
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:53,730
wait,
can do it.

56
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:58,731
You can do it.
Just believe in yourself and we'll get 

57
00:02:58,731 --> 00:02:59,470
to the top of the stream where there is 
heaven.

58
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
No,
it's a mad genetic dash.

59
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
That's all it is.
Just a mad dash of genes trying to get 

60
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,981
through this weird pipeline where these 
giant bears live to the biggest bears in

61
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:11,710
the world.
By the way,

62
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,160
the biggest barriers in the world in as 
far as like brown bears,

63
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,710
it's between Kodiak bears and polar 
bears.

64
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,890
Polar bears eat seals and shit,
but the brown bears the biggest brown 

65
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,301
bears in the world.
They didn't live on near the salmon 

66
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:27,301
rivers because they just fatten up.
Oh yeah.

67
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:28,290
That's.
I love watching the bears.

68
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,360
That seems like a great incarnation.
The incarnation is to get a bear is one 

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,711
of the good ones,
especially one of those bad ass salmon 

70
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:37,711
bears.
They just lay around.

71
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:42,510
They fight each other.
They're always dirty and covered in 

72
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:42,510
flies,
but they don't care.

73
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,710
I would say yes,
except they're almost 100 percent 

74
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,710
cannibals.

75
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,000
I mean,
who are we to judge?

76
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,300
Have you?
Maybe they.

77
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:54,780
It's delicious to eat another bear ceos.
By the way,

78
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:59,781
I know you probably saw this,
but it does need to be mentioned that 

79
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,270
just hit the Internet.
You've seen the seals raping the 

80
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,270
penguins,
right?

81
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,270
I heard about it.
I didn't watch it.

82
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,970
To watch it,
man,

83
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,570
I can't watch it online because it'll 
fucking get us pulled from youtube.

84
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,840
That's like a statement.
Now get us pulled from youtube so you 

85
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:11,840
can play it up there and it's not 
online.

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,730
We're going to try the new thing.
What if it's on Youtube?

87
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,330
We're going to try the new thing.
This is so nice,

88
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:20,250
man.
Yeah.

89
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,790
We have some new setup that we just 
started looking at.

90
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,190
Sam kinison louder than hell.
What to watch.

91
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,370
You could watch on youtube now.
That's incredible.

92
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,350
My greatest hits.
Yeah,

93
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:36,351
so what's going on is that seals are 
sexually harassing and raping penguins.

94
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,490
This is what it says.
Now.

95
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,620
This is not.
This is not harassing.

96
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:43,590
This is rape.
I didn't see any pinching.

97
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:46,200
Their assets are like,
hey sweetie.

98
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,040
No,
they're.

99
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,960
They're raping them.
Listen,

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
like if,
if you're saying sexually harassing 

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,390
isn't interest attempted rape,
it's just they weren't successful 

102
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,520
because it's not like they're 
communicating.

103
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:59,010
So how else can be the.
That could be sexually harassing.

104
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Harassing is like.
I think that's putting way too much 

105
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,290
intelligence on these seals.
Well,

106
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,540
once,
once someone's trying to rape you,

107
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,090
that's assault sexual assault at the 
very least.

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,150
So even if you don't fuck you that 
sexual assault,

109
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,210
these aren't.
These seals aren't eating on the 

110
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,101
penguins man.
They're not like texting them to march 

111
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,720
there.
They're climbing on top.

112
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,240
And what?
You got to see this man,

113
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,200
look at that.
Oh this,

114
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,920
this is crazy.
This fucking poor penguin just listening

115
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:38,301
to this.
This poor penguin just sits in the seal 

116
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:39,210
and starts trying to fuck it.
It's awful.

117
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,700
It's awful.
It's no,

118
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,570
there's no scale.
Rather sits in the penguin.

119
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,520
All the other penguins are kind of 
watching and is embarrassed,

120
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:52,521
sad way because they could be next.
They can't do anything about it in this 

121
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:53,550
seal.
Just holding this penguin down.

122
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:54,950
Look at it,
trying to peck at them.

123
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,220
And is Paul Simon playing

124
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,440
to this?
This is so fucked up,

125
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,030
man.
This is so fucked up.

126
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,130
And this is like the,
you know,

127
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,340
this is like when monkeys figured out 
how to use tools.

128
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:12,341
There's no going back man.
Once they've been living with these 

129
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:15,431
penguins for so long,
horny not knowing what to do and that 

130
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:19,631
seal is the equivalent of Tesla seals 
because he figured out that you can fuck

131
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:25,241
the pink ones ever.
No.

132
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,490
Here's the big question.
When it comes to animals,

133
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,670
we,
we're,

134
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,710
we're attaching our idea of what it 
would be like to be fucked by that seal,

135
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,840
this humiliation,
the,

136
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,310
you know,
the social ostracism,

137
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,010
the word ostracization,
the horror that the trauma of all that,

138
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,140
but do they register those things the 
way we interpret them,

139
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:56,710
like we're interpreting them and then 
sort of a social contract construct.

140
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,440
Right.
We're interpreting if that was us,

141
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,810
that was me and I was on the beach and 
there was a grizzly on top of me raping 

142
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,921
me,
which is essentially the physical 

143
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:07,921
equivalent.
Right.

144
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:08,740
Your friends kind of marching by would 
be super upset.

145
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,770
Your friends just standing there 
watching you get fucked by this grizzly 

146
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:13,770
bear.
I would be really upset.

147
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,450
Hang in there joe.
But I mean,

148
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,860
once they,
once this,

149
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,250
what's the seal that's a penguin dot.
He's probably like the penguins just 

150
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:22,390
psyched to be up.
Like I don't,

151
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,180
I,
he probably just happy lived,

152
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,870
you know,
I bet they don't really feel 

153
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,870
embarrassed.
I bet they're just like,

154
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,050
they don't want to get fucked,
but they deal with it.

155
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,900
We don't know,
man.

156
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,940
It's one of the great mysteries of the 
universe.

157
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,510
What do you think?
I mean,

158
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,690
it probably doesn't even care if it's a 
male or a female.

159
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:43,950
Penguin is like,
fuck you,

160
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:45,120
you're all girls.
To me,

161
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,170
goddamn giant seal,
warm and oily.

162
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:54,030
That's all it needs.
We attach all these ideas to animals.

163
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,550
We love to do that.
And one of the big ones that we attached

164
00:07:56,551 --> 00:08:01,551
to animals,
it's like our own interpretations of 

165
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:01,551
what something means.
Our own versions of it.

166
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:01,840
Well,
yeah,

167
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:05,980
and it all goes back to the idea that 
the big question is,

168
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:10,981
is our,
our brains the things producing our 

169
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:14,941
sense of awareness and self or is there 
some other disembodied awareness that 

170
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:20,101
sort of goes through organic matter when
it has the right kind of nervous system 

171
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:24,271
and creates the sense of self.
But if you believe in the mechanical 

172
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:24,430
idea,
uh,

173
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,940
the materialist view that it's just a 
bio computer,

174
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,210
uh,
then the penguins experience is probably

175
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,820
just a very,
something is hot and warm,

176
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:36,340
pushing it down.
It wants to get away.

177
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,550
And when it gets away,
it's not like waking up at night 

178
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,161
screaming or avoid seals that are,
it's like the most kinky penguin of all 

179
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,620
time.
Maybe

180
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,200
he's just playing hard to get,
oh look,

181
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:53,580
there's something wrong with flipper.
Get a fuck me again.

182
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:56,310
You asshole.
He gets really

183
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,230
into it.
He just like,

184
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,980
starts leaving himself by the shore,
falls

185
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,470
sleep by the shore,
hoping the CEO finds him.

186
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,340
He falls in love with the seal.
It turns out that that's what he wanted 

187
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,340
all the long.
You know,

188
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,900
he always thought he was a top,
but what he was just a really good,

189
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:18,060
strong bottom.
You just needed to seal to show him the 

190
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,330
way.
It's like that terrible intent.

191
00:09:19,331 --> 00:09:21,730
That website stopped prison rape.org.

192
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,480
We talked about that.
Fun Terrible website man.

193
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:28,940
But that's the one where it's got that 
poem,

194
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,270
the Ninth One,
ninth one who raped me.

195
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,460
You know,
how much of that is trolling,

196
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,800
you know,
you know what I'm saying?

197
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,950
Who is performed at the battle of the 
roast battle?

198
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,410
I have a CD in my car,
the singer,

199
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,770
uh,
find out who it is.

200
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,730
Find out who is the guy who played that 
song,

201
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:53,790
that awesome song at the roast battle.
Yeah.

202
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,830
Find out who that is.
He was fucking hilarious.

203
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:02,831
Anyway,
his song that he played at the roast 

204
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:02,831
battle,
which was unbelievably funny,

205
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,750
was based on a guy falling in love with 
anyone.

206
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,080
I shouldn't probably tell the premise.
I probably,

207
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:11,360
she probably stopped right there.
It's just really funny.

208
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,880
And,
but it's obviously fiction.

209
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,030
Total fiction,
right.

210
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,710
Whereas we,
we're reading the prison rape thing.

211
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:23,711
We're assuming these are actual stories.
It could very well be somebody that's 

212
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:23,711
funny.

213
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,970
It's like that South Park.
I don't know,

214
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,980
I think it just came out the one with 
the south park kids try to get their 

215
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,690
parents to stop watching what they call 
murder porn,

216
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,390
which is like forensic files and stuff.
You know,

217
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:41,391
like you lay in bed.
No one is watching forensic files 

218
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,030
because they're like,
I really want to gather more information

219
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:43,980
about this case to see if I can solve 
it.

220
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,350
People aren't watching Nancy grace 
because they're like,

221
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm going to help find this missing 
child.

222
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,480
People are watching these shows because 
they're getting off and a deep visceral 

223
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:58,581
way at other people's suffering and that
website stinks that it's that kind of 

224
00:10:58,891 --> 00:10:59,120
like

225
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,640
there's one arm.
That's one option.

226
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,150
The other option is feeding paranoid,
right?

227
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,680
Like if you go over grandma's house and 
she's constantly,

228
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,060
as you know,
those wanted,

229
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:09,040
chose on and when the guy's face come,
hold on,

230
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:14,041
hold on.
She shushes everybody trying to get a 

231
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,590
look at the screen,
trying to memorize the student's face.

232
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,450
You know,
if I ever see him,

233
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,010
boy,
I'm going to call that guy.

234
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

235
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,190
Wanted.
He's wanted.

236
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,540
Yeah.
I don't know man.

237
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,390
I think whenever I watch forensic files,
it's just,

238
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,450
there's this kind of like a terrible 
pleasure that comes from realizing that 

239
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:33,810
this world is like that and I'm safe in 
this nice hotel.

240
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,850
You Watch it and you get this kind of 
like,

241
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:37,800
wow,
that's fucking crazy.

242
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,130
It's like that.
It's like that showed,

243
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,210
what do you call it,
showed in Freud or whatever.

244
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:47,211
It's like that for whatever reason,
human beings and the deepest part of 

245
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:48,540
themselves,
if you're really honest with yourself,

246
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,880
when you watch some awful thing on the 
news,

247
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:56,030
it's not like your heart explodes 
initially with all this sweet 

248
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,030
compassion.
You're like,

249
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,730
what the fuck?
Wow.

250
00:11:57,731 --> 00:12:00,370
Look at that explosion.
That's intense,

251
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:05,371
but it's not like you're weeping.
It's not like tears are falling out of 

252
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:09,241
your eyes.
You're just sort of in awe and then 

253
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:09,580
weirdly excited way about shit blowing 
up.

254
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,010
Carlin's got a great joke about it,
but it's.

255
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,220
This is like a bell curve,
a show.

256
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,300
There's a bell curve created where when 
something close to you is suffering,

257
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:24,590
like if you're in a.
If you see an animal that's sick or if 

258
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:24,880
you're something awful happened around 
you,

259
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,560
you would be like,
fuck,

260
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,150
that's awful,
and try to help.

261
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:30,310
You wouldn't be like,
this is weird and kind of cool,

262
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,460
but somehow this bell curve happens.
Where if that very same thing is 

263
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,301
happening outside of a certain proximity
to where you're at outside your 

264
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:43,711
neighborhood.
Usually in another country it goes from 

265
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:46,381
being this kind of morning hard,
a weird kind of creepy enjoyment and 

266
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:51,781
that's what the news is making money on 
because if people watch the news and 

267
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:52,270
felt terrible when they watched 
disaster,

268
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,720
nobody would watch the news would make 
any money.

269
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:01,270
People like to sit and stare into the 
apocalypse because it's entertaining to 

270
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,510
entertain apocalypse.

271
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,330
There's definitely something to that for
sure.

272
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,360
There's definitely some draw a part of 
it where we get this weird charge about 

273
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,000
watching inevitable destruction.
Yeah,

274
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,410
just not ours.
Yeah,

275
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:16,900
just not ours don't want that,
but when you see it,

276
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:22,110
whenever it's somebody else,
you kind of feel like you dodged a 

277
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,110
bullet.
I mean it's like it's.

278
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,960
It's,
it's a terrible thing,

279
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:27,961
but it is true.
People don't want to watch stuff that 

280
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:28,330
makes him sad.
Like the humane society commercial,

281
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:31,500
you know the thing that pops on when the
eyes of the angel in the arms,

282
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:36,501
the angel song,
you can barely watch that because it's 

283
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:38,080
so terribly sad.
People don't want that,

284
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,230
but somehow the anesthetized war 
reporting the anesthetized or the sort 

285
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:48,451
of like foamed down aerial shots of a 
fucking drone strike with that kind of 

286
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:51,370
weird flash of smoke.
You see the shapes.

287
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,370
Oh those are,
those are trucks with people and um,

288
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,580
but you don't see that like smoldering 
twitching human corpse or the guy 

289
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:03,430
limping away with his femur jutting out 
as he's like,

290
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,820
one of his eyeballs is out and he's 
thinking about his wife and he's 

291
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,460
wondering if he's ever going to see her 
again.

292
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,820
You don't see that.
You just see this like gone.

293
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:17,821
And Zoe that you see in the shade,
that's nothing like a shade that you 

294
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:18,100
would ever seen.
Real love.

295
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:21,300
You seen that weird gray greenish,
like,

296
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,570
you know what I mean?
When you,

297
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,800
the,
the representatives,

298
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,980
they'll heat signatures.
So all the people were just as sort of 

299
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,620
white and then they're like,
it's the weirdest,

300
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:33,790
most abstract thing.
If you think about like how advanced our

301
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:38,791
ability to film things is in 2014.
Why is all the footage in this like 

302
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,950
weird black and white?
You know,

303
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,200
radar,
dish looking fucking footage,

304
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:49,201
like you don't really see video of those
exact same things and hd,

305
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,100
I don't know if it's because you can't 
get it

306
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,810
or because they're doing it at night.
I mean I don't.

307
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,490
I don't know.

308
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Well,
I think probably they don't want people 

309
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:00,620
to be like,
Hey,

310
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:00,960
this is just terrible.
That stopped that.

311
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,170
Like when they show that drone strikes,
imagine if they did start playing Sarah 

312
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,960
Mclaughlin or something.
They don't do that.

313
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,850
The military doesn't put that kind of 
music.

314
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:11,880
Did their drone strikes?
I feel when you,

315
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:17,090
when you smash a bug,
like if you smash a bug in your house,

316
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:22,260
if I smash a bug in my house,
I feel there's more of a sadness.

317
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:22,980
When I'm like,
God,

318
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,780
I'm sorry,
but you're a roach.

319
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,970
I got to take you out,
my friend.

320
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,340
Do you have to go into the next 
incarnation now?

321
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,710
And I kill it.
Sometimes I take them outside.

322
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:36,711
I feel more intense about that.
Then when they show humans being 

323
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:40,641
exploded because they do it in such a 
quick packaged sweet way that we're all 

324
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:45,891
numbed out to it.
We're all numbed out to the fact that 

325
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:48,770
those fucking explosions that are 
evaporating people or a hundred percent 

326
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,001
being funded by the money that is 
siphoned off of is every time we buy 

327
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:57,681
lattes or whenever we sell our life 
energy to other people that is being 

328
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:02,001
converted by some invisible power into 
human evaporating devices.

329
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,370
We know that that doesn't occur to us at
all.

330
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:06,450
It's just like,
yeah,

331
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:07,910
well it's more I guess.
Oh

332
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,010
look,
they fight for freedom so that we can 

333
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,350
have freedom over here.
It's true.

334
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,540
It's true,
but the problem is some of them do,

335
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,740
man.
Some of them do.

336
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,650
And,
and,

337
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:19,000
and,
and the real heroes,

338
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,830
they go over there with real good 
intentions and there's also,

339
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:27,831
it's not as simple as black and white 
because there's a real issue with all 

340
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:28,950
sorts of spots in the world with this 
human conflict.

341
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,770
It's not like if we weren't involved in 
Afghanistan,

342
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,100
all the shit that's going on in Africa 
wouldn't be going on right now.

343
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,250
What?
It's not like any of the conflicts that 

344
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,251
exists all over the world.
The conflict between North Korea and 

345
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:43,251
South Korea,
like all these,

346
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:46,170
there's everywhere you look,
the Russians were invading Ukraine.

347
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,200
There's everywhere you look.
People are fucking with people 

348
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,720
everywhere you look.
It's been going like that since the 

349
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,570
beginning of time.
So this idea that like if we weren't 

350
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:56,570
involved it wouldn't exist.

351
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,280
I don't know.
I don't know about that,

352
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,530
you know?
I mean it would be nice if everybody was

353
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:03,160
Canada.
That's what it had been.

354
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,150
If everybody was Canada,
we wouldn't have to worry about shit.

355
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,450
Everybody would just chill the fuck out.
Canadians aren't pussies,

356
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:14,451
but they're nice.
They're nice and I think in smart 

357
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,900
they're smart as shit.
I think one of the problems,

358
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,990
one of the,
one of the things that's going on with 

359
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,941
Canada is a candidate doesn't have his 
history of trying to conquer the world 

360
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,050
with all this history of like being 
involved.

361
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:30,051
Like if you get involved in a conflict 
then you're involved in reverberations 

362
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:31,660
of the conflict,
the rebound from the conflict,

363
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:36,030
the post conflict,
rehabilitation of the area.

364
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,400
You're involved in a bunch of shit back 
and forth,

365
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:43,401
back and forth.
It takes a long time to not get to not 

366
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:46,810
be financially and socially and 
culturally entwined in that contract.

367
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,960
That's crazy.
People never think about that.

368
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,900
Once you get in twined in any sort of 
conflict,

369
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:53,970
you set a whole process in motion.

370
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,060
That's not.
Yeah,

371
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:57,250
not just in war.
In life in general.

372
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,640
Whenever you get in a conflict with 
somebody these terrible.

373
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,790
It's like.
It's like when you're fucking ear buds 

374
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:05,790
get tangled.

375
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,360
Gotcha.
Why resolving conflict feel so good.

376
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,920
He realized just we both just got 
untangled from some stupidity that 

377
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,480
didn't have to be there in the first 
place,

378
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,030
but when your whole fucking nation has 
been doing that for 200 years,

379
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,690
man,
it's,

380
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,030
it's hard,
you know,

381
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,110
and noble wars,
you know,

382
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,120
like getting involved in world war two 
and try and stop the Nazi Empire,

383
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:31,230
which was legitimately in like an evil 
empire run by a madman.

384
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,760
I mean,
if you really want to think about how 

385
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,871
crazy war was in the 19 forties,
you have to take into consideration that

386
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:44,301
this was for everyone knew that they 
were working towards some ultimate 

387
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:44,790
weapon.
Okay.

388
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,850
Everyone knew this.
Everyone knew this was one of the first 

389
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,760
wars ever that was fought with 
airplanes,

390
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,680
but world war one,
world war two,

391
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,040
they figured out they could fly over to 
places and start bombing them.

392
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,890
So people in other continents.
We're at war with people.

393
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,190
I mean there was some high scale shit 
really for the first time in human 

394
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,990
history because before that it's like 
everybody had to come over on a boat.

395
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,360
It took fucking forever to get here.
When they got here,

396
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:12,030
they got scurvy fucking pick them off at
the beach.

397
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,250
It's like no big deal.
Oh,

398
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:17,100
we brought our canon,
so good luck getting to the shore,

399
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:19,620
which is just fucking sink you before 
even get close to us.

400
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:21,330
We had canons over here too.
Stupid.

401
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,380
Right?
And you gotta take your boat and go far 

402
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,180
where the canons can't shoot you.
I mean it was a really short place,

403
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,390
a short distance warfare.
Then all of a sudden it becomes the 19 

404
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,161
hundreds and people can fly fucking 
planes and they're just flying in and 

405
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:41,001
dropping bombs.
Not just dropping bombs but dropping a 

406
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:44,970
fucking nuclear bomb on two cities.
So they're just saying,

407
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:49,080
fuck military,
fuck military know we're at war,

408
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,670
war,
war,

409
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:54,330
war means it's not like we shoot your 
plans and you shoot our planes.

410
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:57,660
No,
we're just gonna drop an annihilator.

411
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,690
Have a bomb,
a bomb that doesn't give a fuck who it 

412
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,571
hits.
We're not thinking about collateral 

413
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,870
damage.
We know we're going to kill 100,000

414
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:09,730
women and children at least.
And we're,

415
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:10,770
we're,
we're willing to do that.

416
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:14,640
We're willing to go thank press that 
button to stop this bullshit.

417
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,660
Woo.

418
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Yeah.
That was a big leap in the direction of 

419
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,340
the apocalypse.
They're fair.

420
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,040
That's a timer.
You know,

421
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,730
man,
I was just talking to Matt stags not two

422
00:20:28,731 --> 00:20:32,540
hours ago because I was trying to get 
him to explain the.

423
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:37,580
What the fuck is that called the Fermi 
paradox.

424
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,480
You know the idea that if.
So there's two,

425
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,910
there's the drake equation,
the Fermi paradox.

426
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,370
The drake equation is the equation that 
a bunch people at said he came up with,

427
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:53,371
which is like,
these are the components we would need 

428
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:53,860
for there to be extraterrestrial life 
and the universe.

429
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:58,861
Let's gather all this shit up and we can
get an idea of some random number of 

430
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:04,681
where this could be.
It's kind of a shitty equation or 

431
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,770
because there's,
it's based on one sample which is us,

432
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,010
but still it's an idea of like how many 
civilizations are there out there and I 

433
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:12,760
can't remember which guy it was.

434
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,720
One of these guys said he,
I think drake said he,

435
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:21,721
and this is before kepler discovered all
these other planets in the goldilocks 

436
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:22,300
zone.
This is before that.

437
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:26,020
He said 10,000
civilizations equivalent to ours.

438
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,710
And then that gave birth to the Fermi 
paradox,

439
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:30,310
which is,
wait,

440
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:32,740
if there's 10,000
civilizations just in our,

441
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,020
uh,
I think in the Milky Way,

442
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,630
then that must mean in an infinite 
universe there's that,

443
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,310
you know,
exponentially more.

444
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:44,550
Why haven't we seen them yet?
And so there's all these reasons of why 

445
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,301
maybe civilizations don't make it into a
turning into Canada,

446
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:51,640
which would be a class two association.
Uh,

447
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,910
and that is because like,
I'm sure we've all talked about this 

448
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,750
before we blow it,
we blow our fucking ass is up.

449
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,140
And that was when,
that's when the clock started ticking 

450
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,700
right there when humans started dropping
nuclear bombs on other people.

451
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,910
That's the beginning of that ticking 
clock that sets this terrible truth in 

452
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:17,071
motion,
which is that here we have invented 

453
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:18,961
these devices,
have absolute destruction and we're 

454
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:22,210
believing that our civilization,
our society is going to last long enough

455
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:26,110
to keep these things in our hands and 
not in other people's hands.

456
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,470
And so in Pakistan,
India,

457
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,470
North Korea,
Russia,

458
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,740
all these tumultuous areas have these 
devices that evaporate human beings in 

459
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:40,510
mass.
And clearly,

460
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:45,511
if you look at the world right now,
you could see with these masked 

461
00:22:45,511 --> 00:22:48,640
fundamentalist psychopaths,
but heading people,

462
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,050
uh,
and the,

463
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,810
you know,
what just happened in fucking Jerusalem,

464
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,110
uh,
with that hatchet looney coming in and 

465
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,780
just hacking up people while they're 
praying.

466
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,750
And then that'll be followed by an 
insane attack on them.

467
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,990
You see,
we are existing in such a tumultuous 

468
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,901
civilization that there is a very high 
probability that nukes are going to get 

469
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:13,960
out into the world and that it could 
shut the civilization down.

470
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,440
The implication being this happens in 
all developing civilizations,

471
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:21,340
moving from type one or class one to 
two,

472
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,520
which is what we're doing right now,
and that's why we should be putting a 

473
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,870
fuck load more energy into exploring 
just how important are all these various

474
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:37,621
cultures everyone's adhering to that's 
making them feel like it's okay to 

475
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:41,520
evaporate other people.
How important is a culture that says 

476
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,050
it's okay to to kill these people 
because they're of a different religion 

477
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,270
or they live another country or 
wherever.

478
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,450
Like this is a mental disease man.
We are already candidate where Canada 

479
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,770
filled with a bunch of different colored
people who have a mental contaminants in

480
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:59,771
their brain that makes them believe in 
various version of as if an invisible 

481
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,970
Megla maniacal doom god,
you know,

482
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:05,480
and so that's creating all this problem.
That's the big frustration,

483
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:06,950
man.
Here's devil's advocate though.

484
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,270
Of course.
Yes.

485
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,390
Devil's advocate is just because we are 
involved in all these conflicts all 

486
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:19,601
throughout the world and just because 
United States is definitely done some 

487
00:24:19,601 --> 00:24:21,800
shit that most people would agree would 
be horrific.

488
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,390
Yes.
Most people,

489
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:24,770
most reasonable people.
Sure.

490
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,090
If there was no military,
if we had no involvement whatsoever,

491
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:36,851
we could just pull out in a race all of 
our contacts with anyone all over the 

492
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:40,781
world.
Would we really trust that some new 

493
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:43,810
crazy fuck wouldn't rise to some extreme
Kim Jong Il type of power?

494
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:44,960
Yeah.
Right.

495
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:46,790
Like if we're like suddenly like,
okay,

496
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,730
no more military,
everybody go home melting this,

497
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,970
we're going to turn all of the guns and 
all the military bases and a utopian 

498
00:24:55,701 --> 00:25:00,701
civilization or human beings can have 
access to infinite marijuana and float 

499
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:05,291
tanks.
Like what you offer me when I moved in 

500
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,840
with you that time.
Let's imagine that that happened.

501
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,010
Right?
Right.

502
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:11,780
And that happens just in the United 
States.

503
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,270
Meanwhile,
I mean all these people,

504
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:15,230
man,
that too,

505
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,750
they're a little butt hurt to put it 
lightly.

506
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,220
So they're going to be like,
oh great.

507
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:26,030
So now you guys have your super 
telescopes in your Utopian civilizations

508
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:31,031
and your beautiful palatial gardens that
used to be military structures,

509
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,260
but you remember the time you 
accidentally killed my entire family and

510
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:40,010
everyone I know because you dropped the 
bomb in the wrong place because I do.

511
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,410
I just can't seem to forget it guys.

512
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:47,240
I can't seem to forget it and there's a 
lot of people that feel like that and so

513
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:50,230
now we've created this terrible,
terrible pendulum,

514
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,420
a chain reaction.
This bouncing back and forth of war.

515
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,780
There's the essence of the problem.
Israel in Palestine.

516
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,780
How the fuck you just hacked up my 
grandfather,

517
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:04,781
mother fucker.
He was praying and you fuck two of you 

518
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:08,300
psychotic fundamentalists motherfuckers 
game and hacked up my grandfather and my

519
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:11,660
grandmother while they were praying 
right after my wedding.

520
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,730
You just did that to the rest of my 
life.

521
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,890
I'm not going to forget about that 
motherfucker.

522
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,390
And over there they're like,
oh,

523
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,710
oh,
that makes you sad.

524
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:23,711
How about you?
The time you guys devastated my entire 

525
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:23,711
city.
I just this.

526
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:25,160
I sell fruit.
That's my job.

527
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:30,161
I sell fruit.
You guys turn my fucking family and a 

528
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:30,161
hamburger meat.
So I'm not forgetting it either.

529
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,000
Back and forth,
back and forth.

530
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,660
Infinite war,
infinite wars.

531
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:38,661
So the.
The question is how do we fix that 

532
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:39,290
question?
Well,

533
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,420
yeah,
but I agree.

534
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,890
It seems like the only way.
Well,

535
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:46,020
it seems that.
Here's the scary problem,

536
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:51,021
man.
This is scary shit that makes a lot of 

537
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:51,021
peoples that will make a lot of like 
can,

538
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:55,590
would make if you're a conspiracy 
theorist for some reason this scares 

539
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:55,650
people,
but if you do look at that,

540
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,920
obviously the Israel Palestine thing,
I don't see how that's going to fix 

541
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
itself and if you read zealot by Reza 
Aslan,

542
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,840
which you fucking show because you would
love it.

543
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,140
That fucking con,
that place is just to that places like 

544
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,710
been having flare ups for thousands of 
years,

545
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:17,781
just these terror that's the part of the
human bio mass that has got some really,

546
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,430
really sensitive hemorrhoids,
man,

547
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:25,140
and one slight little friction the wrong
way and that shit flares up with war.

548
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,000
Oh,
the time.

549
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,860
Well,
we've talked about this before.

550
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,200
That's the cradle of civilization.
Yeah.

551
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,950
I think they're the townies of the 
world.

552
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,220
Those are the people that never went.
Civilization evolved in Mesopotamia,

553
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:40,580
in the Sudan,
Iraq and Sumir and all that.

554
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,640
That whole area is like the oldest stuff
that we know have really written 

555
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,160
language and mathematics and all that 
shit.

556
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:52,430
They called Jerusalem.
The Romans called Jerusalem a hole in 

557
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:58,101
the corner,
that's what they called it because they 

558
00:27:58,101 --> 00:28:00,501
just thought it was at,
this isn't this great book and it's so 

559
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:00,501
good,
but you know,

560
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:01,050
yeah,
that's what they thought of them too.

561
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,390
And they invaded them and they thought 
it was like quaint what the,

562
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,110
what was called the Jewish cult,
which is that the Jews.

563
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,840
So good man,
that description of the temple,

564
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:13,170
you know,
the,

565
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,360
where the Wailing Wall is now that got 
destroyed.

566
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,750
It's so beautiful describing how that 
religion worked and the way he so good 

567
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:25,230
at articulating the,
a strangeness of it,

568
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:30,231
which is that you have this structure 
with all these levels that you are 

569
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,920
different people are allowed access 
into.

570
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:35,910
So like you've got like this outer area 
which anyone can be at,

571
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:39,090
and that's where everyone sells shit.
That's where the money changers are.

572
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:44,091
Because if you were going to a buy 
animal sacrifices in the temple,

573
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:46,420
you can only do it with the,
uh,

574
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Jewish money shekels.
You couldn't do it with any other 

575
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,901
currency.
So you had to change money there to buy 

576
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,721
whatever animal it was that you're going
to sacrifice and you'd give that money 

577
00:28:56,721 --> 00:29:00,150
to the priest who had purchased their 
position from the Romans,

578
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,930
and so you would give that money to the 
priests and the priests,

579
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,760
uh,
you would be able to,

580
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:07,950
if you were to be able to get into 
certain areas.

581
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,010
But there was one area,
the holiest of holies,

582
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:16,190
where once a year a priest is allowed 
into this place with a rope tied around 

583
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:21,891
his body in case God strikes him down,
they could pull his body out of the 

584
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:26,541
holiest of holies.
And the idea was that the spirit of God 

585
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:30,021
on earth was just blasting out of there 
like some kind of nuclear reactor of 

586
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:35,871
spiritual energy.
And so that place was constantly,

587
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:39,510
constantly being invaded,
constantly being overthrown,

588
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,550
constantly probing problems,
man,

589
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,880
always having problems.
And Jesus,

590
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:50,881
this book,
it's called Zealot and it's about the 

591
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:51,400
historic Jesus.
He usually gets pretty boring to me,

592
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:56,401
but this is real.
Jesus was one of so many people back 

593
00:29:56,401 --> 00:29:58,420
then who was saying it was the end of 
the world.

594
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,720
And he wasn't saying it was the end of 
the world because he literally thought 

595
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,121
it was the end of the world.
They just couldn't accept the fact that 

596
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:08,350
they worship the greatest God on earth 
and that the Romans had invaded.

597
00:30:08,351 --> 00:30:11,230
So therefore the answer was,
it's must be the apocalypse.

598
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,280
The world must be ending.
So it's just this incredible place,

599
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:20,281
man.
It's fucking always in that state of 

600
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:20,281
target.
It's out of balance.

601
00:30:20,281 --> 00:30:22,240
The places out of fucking balance,
you know,

602
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,280
it's always this.
They're always getting invaded

603
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,950
there it seems like.
I mean,

604
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:30,951
if you think about countries that are 
far removed from war as like Norway,

605
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,740
Iceland,
Greenland,

606
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,650
people live in Greenland,
they should.

607
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:39,750
It sounds like a beautiful place.
Probably not really green.

608
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,930
I think it's getting greener,
which is global warming,

609
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,690
California.
That's going to be an amazing Hawaii in 

610
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,151
the future.
I think it's called white land right 

611
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:50,151
now.
Yeah.

612
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:50,151
Well,
you know,

613
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:53,801
there was,
they found a map of greenland from like 

614
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:56,210
the $1,500
or some shit where we didn't even know 

615
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,080
that greenland was a continent 
apparently until 18 hundreds,

616
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,500
like the western Western civilization.
But they found this crazy map unbelief.

617
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,170
It was greenland,
am I right?

618
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,510
Or was it Antarctica?
It was one of those,

619
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,990
but they found this really ancient map 
that seems to suggest that there was 

620
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,471
some people from a long time ago that 
knew a lot more about making maps and 

621
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:17,940
about where continents were and then 
maybe the continents were different,

622
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,680
you know,
at once we know about like,

623
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,360
you know,
we know about the stone age for like 

624
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,360
10,000
years ago where the,

625
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,590
uh,
the ice age or other were like 10,000

626
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:27,630
years ago in North America was like 
covered in ice.

627
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,960
While they think that it's possible that
some time before then people got good 

628
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:36,780
enough so they can make a map and then 
they sort of pass these maps down.

629
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,530
There's the map.
Is this cool?

630
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,880
It's,
it comes up when ai starts greenland,

631
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,520
ancient map.
No,

632
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:48,530
it's fuck was just,
it was like,

633
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,080
it was just of the continent.
And it was really unusual because the 

634
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,800
continent up until that point had been 
like covered in ice.

635
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,950
Forget the story.
God dammit.

636
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,590
I hate when I have a half a fucking 
story in my head like that,

637
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,110
but it's something along those lines,
but point being when you,

638
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,210
when you talk about Israel and Palestine
and you talk about the Saudi Arabia and 

639
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,410
Iran,
that those ideas to America and 

640
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,291
sometimes seems so abstract.
It seems like that shit is just over 

641
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,890
there,
but like if that was your neighbor,

642
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,950
can you imagine if the dirt was closer 
and your neighbor was just fucking 

643
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,780
lighten your neighbor up with bombs?
Yeah.

644
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,970
People were flying in with flying jets.
Yeah,

645
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,700
man that don't even have people in them.

646
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,200
You know,
this is the thing.

647
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,700
I.
When I worked at a summer camp,

648
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,940
if a bunch of kids,
by the way,

649
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,050
every great story starts with when I 
worked at a summer camp,

650
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,810
kids were getting these fucking fights,
man.

651
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:52,811
They're getting these ridiculous fights 
and they begin like they become like 

652
00:32:52,811 --> 00:32:56,740
arch enemies.
It's amazing how much venom can spring 

653
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,281
up between two to 12 year olds,
but they will become arch enemies.

654
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:06,491
And so one of the things that you would 
do after they'd gotten in a fight is he 

655
00:33:06,491 --> 00:33:09,020
make them sit together on a bench for 
two hours.

656
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,220
You just,
there's a bench.

657
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,960
You guys have to go sit on the bench 
together.

658
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:17,170
Nobody's around them.
And inevitably over that course of two 

659
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,591
hours,
they usually will make up and they'll 

660
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:20,591
become best friends for the rest of the 
summer.

661
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:22,760
They'll talk and like they whatever the 
fuck the thing was,

662
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:24,710
it just naturally heals itself.

663
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,350
Right?
So now God forgive me,

664
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,580
I'm,
I know that that is one of the most 

665
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,080
awful naive oversimplifications of a 
thing,

666
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:38,410
but eventually the people who aren't 
blowing each other up on a daily basis 

667
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:43,280
who are sharing a planet with the people
who are blowing each other up on a daily

668
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:48,281
basis.
And it's a planet where nuclear weapons 

669
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:50,861
exist and we're all so deeply connected 
and getting more and more connected 

670
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:54,610
every single fucking day.
At what point does the planet say,

671
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,580
guys,
we got to put you on the fucking bench,

672
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:00,740
man.
We've got to stop this war.

673
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:01,790
We just have to say,
when,

674
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,790
when does this civilization wake up and 
realize we are not Americans,

675
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,980
Canadians.
We're not a.

676
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,920
we're not based on the landmass,
Ron,

677
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:17,921
we're earthlings,
we're earthlings and we're all living 

678
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:21,461
together,
sharing the same resources and somebody 

679
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:22,610
has got to recognize that we can give 
them longer that we play around with.

680
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,880
We're all different and that's great.
We're all different and we just are 

681
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,671
going to celebrate our own cultures.
We're just gonna celebrate our own 

682
00:34:30,671 --> 00:34:33,791
cultures into infinity and part of our 
cultures involves worshiping God damn 

683
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:39,350
warmongering death.
God's that somehow make it seem okay for

684
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:41,870
us to murder other people in the name of
it.

685
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,340
Eventually you got to be like,
guys,

686
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,740
sorry,
we're not doing that game anymore.

687
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:51,050
Well,
it drives me crazy when people start 

688
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,160
talking about religions is something to 
be respected,

689
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,920
you know,
respecting other people's religions.

690
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,520
There's a lot of shit in religion that 
you can't respect if you're a rational 

691
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,181
person.
There's a lot of shit like stoning for 

692
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:03,181
adultery.
Yeah,

693
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:07,250
I mean if you're really,
if you're really advocating stone 

694
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,950
stoning people,
hitting them with rocks until they die 

695
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,770
for having sex with someone,
they want to have sex with your fucking 

696
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:13,770
crazy.
Yeah.

697
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,040
Do you ever seen those videos?
I can't watch seeing the links.

698
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,060
I'll never watched as a father and his 
daughter and it was so awful and he was 

699
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,120
treating his daughter,
you know?

700
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,470
I mean it was,
it was sick.

701
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,790
It was crazy.
It was.

702
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,660
He,
he wouldn't talk to her.

703
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,950
Wouldn't say that she was his daughter.
He wouldn't look at her.

704
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,840
He wouldn't,
wouldn't touch her.

705
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,880
She wanted to hold her hand.
He wouldn't hold his hand.

706
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,360
She wouldn't touch him or he wouldn't 
touch her rather.

707
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,520
I mean I'm getting flustered talking 
about it because it's hard to watch 

708
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,690
because you realize this is a father.
He's going to kill his daughter with a 

709
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:47,280
rock because they both got trapped in 
some crazy ideology.

710
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,220
This is his baby.
This is his baby.

711
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:55,370
He's going to kill his baby with a rock 
to show his love for an angry God that 

712
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,070
he's never lived.
Exactly.

713
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,360
Exactly.
Yeah.

714
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,800
No,
no.

715
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,700
Yeah,
no,

716
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,570
but how?
How do you enforce it and how do you do?

717
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,630
You can't enforce anything with people.
You've got to let people know what it 

718
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:08,880
really is.
It's not the word of God.

719
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:13,020
There is no word of God out there.
What if there is a word of God?

720
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,240
It doesn't belong to one fucking group.

721
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,500
That's for God damn sure.
The idea that God came down and talked 

722
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,550
to one fucking group and his knowledge 
is the only true knowledge in this group

723
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:26,700
only has anybody who tells you that is 
full of shit.

724
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,320
Okay,
so let's just start there.

725
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:33,770
Let's start there.
There's God's going to talk to 

726
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,991
everybody,
going to talk to Chinese people who's 

727
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:38,120
going to talk to black people.
Everybody's going to have a universal 

728
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,120
message and if it's not a universal 
message,

729
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,411
everybody needs to sit the fuck down and
talk this through because we might be 

730
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,920
getting some mixed signals here.
We're not at war with each other.

731
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:48,921
We're just humans.
We're just a bunch of humans and this 

732
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:51,831
idea that you have to be at war because 
somebody wrote some shit down on animal 

733
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:55,671
skins or you have to be the chosen one,
or you have to be the people that have 

734
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:55,671
the truth.

735
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,050
You know?
Why is the other religion saying this?

736
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,560
It's simple because we are the truth.
Everybody claps.

737
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:05,610
I've seen that man.
I've seen that in Islam videos.

738
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,440
I've seen that in Christian videos.
I've seen them say in Christian videos,

739
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:14,040
these online things because who will the
Lord?

740
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:19,550
The Bible is the only true work of the 
Lord and everybody will go crazy on how 

741
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,800
do you know?
How the fuck do you know?

742
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,890
You don't know,
and it doesn't mean there's no god.

743
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,880
It doesn't mean there's no god.
It means that you don't know.

744
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,290
You're pretending,
you know,

745
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:31,260
because it makes you feel better and 
you're fucking with everybody else.

746
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:31,890
When you do that.

747
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:37,080
Most people I know who are the most 
radical atheists are,

748
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:42,310
are,
have been raised in those 

749
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,851
fundamentalists households and in that,
I mean I consider that to be a form of 

750
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:46,240
child abuse,
which is a.

751
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,460
it's a psychic child abuse where you 
get,

752
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:55,150
you get your will you get one plus one 
equals three for your entire life.

753
00:37:56,181 --> 00:38:01,181
Did I?
I told you about the time where I was 

754
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:01,181
hanging out with Christian is right.
Did I ever tell you about that?

755
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,910
And one of the Hari Krishna says,
when I was saying to the Hari Krishna in

756
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,160
the Bhagavad Gita as it is,
is the Bhagavad Gita with these reports 

757
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,030
by proper pot,
the founder of the Hari Krishna's,

758
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,800
and there were some things in their 
private pod said,

759
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:18,810
I just didn't agree with.
It didn't make sense to me.

760
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:20,660
It didn't make sense.
So I said to me,

761
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,380
I don't agree with this here.
And he goes,

762
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,910
we don't say that we don't agree with 
proper pod.

763
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,570
We say that we don't understand what 
prop pod means.

764
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:35,540
Just

765
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,810
stupid.
It's not that easy.

766
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,820
It's not that you have the ability to be
logical enough to look at whatever the 

767
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,961
particular mythology that's getting 
diarrhea it all over your fucking brain 

768
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:45,961
and be like,
no,

769
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:48,060
this is wrong.
It's that you're stupid or you're,

770
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,910
you're possessed by Satan.
Demons have taken hold of you.

771
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,080
It's so when you're one of the most 
theoretically one of the most 

772
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,240
intelligent beings on earth,
which human beings are and you're having

773
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:03,241
this shit thrown at you.
Then the fundamental one fundamental 

774
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:03,280
component of being human being,
which is a part of you are like,

775
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:04,660
nope,
that's wrong.

776
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,940
That gets subverted.
That gets diverted.

777
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,040
If that's not child abuse,
I don't know what it is,

778
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:14,250
which is why a lot of people are so a 
lot of many radical,

779
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:16,180
radical,
angry atheists.

780
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:17,380
They should be angry,
you know,

781
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,560
and therefore that God that they are 
trumpeting,

782
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:23,140
that doesn't exist.
They should be trumpeting it.

783
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:28,170
They should be doing tap dances on it's 
moldering grave and cheering and joy.

784
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:33,430
You know,
another problem with religion is that 

785
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,960
it's very regressive in nature.
Not that it's not progressive in some of

786
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:38,870
its ideas because like a lot of 
Christianity,

787
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,540
it sounds like really good advice.
If you want to live a happy life,

788
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:46,541
there's a lot of it,
but the stuff that's regressive in its 

789
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,271
nature,
it what it does is it basically goes 

790
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:52,511
against all of the known laws of culture
and awareness that we have ever been 

791
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:55,670
subjected to,
so our entire lives of reading books,

792
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,730
our entire lives of interacting with 
people on the Internet,

793
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:03,731
interacting with people in real life,
experiencing films and experiencing art 

794
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:08,530
and experiencing all the different 
things that people have created and 

795
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,571
noticing that it's getting better and 
better and smarter and smarter all the 

796
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:13,661
time.
That science is getting more and more 

797
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:13,661
aware,
more and more capable technology.

798
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,370
It's fucking exploding at this 
unbelievable increasing rates.

799
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,560
Everything is newer,
better,

800
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:19,670
faster,
smarter,

801
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:21,380
more advanced,
more intuitive,

802
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:26,530
more interconnected except religion.
Religions like hit the brakes.

803
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:33,070
We're going to go back to the time or 
writing shit down on animal skins and 

804
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,850
they're like hanging onto this wild 
stream of information and digging their 

805
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:42,020
heels in the dirt and saying that women 
shouldn't be allowed to drive.

806
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:47,210
Right?
They're essentially what they're doing 

807
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,170
is keeping us stuck on this fucking 
planet and not flying into space.

808
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,220
Interstellar ships,
no,

809
00:40:52,221 --> 00:40:57,221
it's true.
It's true because it's such a divisive 

810
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,760
thing and it's based on such idiocy.
Most of it.

811
00:40:58,761 --> 00:41:00,890
It's been not idiocy.
It's based on very colorful,

812
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:05,891
beautiful symbols which represent arche 
typical aspects of the human experience 

813
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,660
and that you can use to like help 
yourself wake up,

814
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,780
but the literal interpretation of the 
motherfucker that's keeping us stuck on 

815
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,191
the planet,
and that's weird when you consider the 

816
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:20,681
idea that Graham Hancock talks about,
which is the notion of the demiurge or 

817
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:23,210
the fact that indeed there is an 
interdimensional nemesis.

818
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,360
That these people are worshiping the 
Jehovah God who appeared in the garden 

819
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,541
of Eden and said to Adam and eve,
don't eat the fruit that makes you know 

820
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:31,760
the difference between good and evil.

821
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,310
Don't become human.
That God,

822
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,160
that Satan,
that God was trying to keep a stupid and

823
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:42,161
dumb.
It's like a really advanced alien 

824
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:44,081
consciousness that's like,
let's keep the monkeys is diamond 

825
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:47,350
divided as we possibly can because then 
we can extract that delicious fear for 

826
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:51,821
them that we like to eat.
And so now if you look at Graham 

827
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:55,720
Hancock's version of it,
it's kind of scary to think that the 

828
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,440
direct result of all these various world
religions that have at their core,

829
00:41:57,441 --> 00:42:00,020
this mega maniacal doom God,
they're,

830
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:05,021
that they,
they're the very things keeping us from 

831
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:05,390
being free from the gravity well that 
we're stuck in.

832
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,670
So it is almost as though there were 
some kind of dark force.

833
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:13,010
It's like keeping you trapped on this 
planet so we can keep eating them.

834
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,570
It's our food source.

835
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:19,730
I don't keep them trapped,
trapped,

836
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,890
live off fear.
Yeah.

837
00:42:22,891 --> 00:42:27,000
They live on the air with a straw like a
coconut.

838
00:42:27,001 --> 00:42:28,500
When you drill a hole in it,
coconut,

839
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:33,530
they just tap it in fear.
Keep them scared.

840
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,580
Oh,
have you tried earth yet?

841
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:37,320
It is so filled with fear.

842
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,960
Oh,
you should go over to earth.

843
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:42,550
It's good.
They're terrified.

844
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:47,551
Those monkeys are terrified.
They don't realize how powerful they 

845
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:47,551
are.
They never will.

846
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:48,520
That Jehovah has done such a good job 
over there.

847
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:53,570
I have a less supernatural idea.
My idea of why it's like this is that 

848
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,520
it's a communication issue and that the 
old communication,

849
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:04,521
the old information is still getting 
fucking bounced around over in the spot 

850
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:08,001
where they figured out communication 
first and that here we are in 2014.

851
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:10,660
The further we get away,
the more you know,

852
00:43:10,661 --> 00:43:13,530
like look,
the West Coast is the furthest spot from

853
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,170
the east coast,
which is where everybody landed and it's

854
00:43:16,171 --> 00:43:21,171
just pretty commonly known that the West
Coast is more progressive people more 

855
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:22,790
relaxed.
It's like the California lifestyle.

856
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:27,600
People talk about it all the time.
It's not just a matter of,

857
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,370
oh,
the beach is here.

858
00:43:29,371 --> 00:43:30,180
Everything's cool.
It's no,

859
00:43:30,181 --> 00:43:32,970
it's everybody got as far away from the 
bullshit as possible.

860
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:38,270
The bullshit was like my family were 
Italian and Italian and Irish immigrants

861
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:44,210
and all those people that landed there,
they all landed there within decades or 

862
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,540
generations was all these crazy 
immigrants that escaped Europe,

863
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,720
which has even more fucked up and you 
know,

864
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,050
you go further,
further,

865
00:43:52,051 --> 00:43:53,820
further,
you're going to get to Iraq,

866
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,390
you're going to get to sue mayor.

867
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,350
You're going to get to the fucking epic 
of Gilgamesh.

868
00:43:58,351 --> 00:43:59,420
I mean,
that's what you're getting to.

869
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:04,430
It's all mapped out for us.
It's all real obvious where everything 

870
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:08,301
got pop and everything got started.
The people that stayed were assholes 

871
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:12,830
that were assholes with ridiculous ideas
and everybody tried to revise your 

872
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:12,960
ideas.
The further we got away.

873
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,960
It's like Noah's Ark is essentially the 
epic of Gilgamesh,

874
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,270
right?
And there's Hercules.

875
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:20,280
You can compare Hercules with Jesus.
I mean,

876
00:44:20,281 --> 00:44:22,500
there's a lot of these fucking stories 
that are super similar,

877
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,720
right?
There's a lot of them.

878
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:29,721
When you compare the,
the actual core origin of like the like 

879
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:31,360
what was what was actually said,
what?

880
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,160
What actually

881
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,910
are you saying happened?
The virgin gave birth to a god like,

882
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:37,760
okay.
All right.

883
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,680
Just want to be clear.
How many of these are there?

884
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,720
There's a lot of these are,
and you think about people just sitting 

885
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,941
around campfires.
If they fucking shot or Ram with some 

886
00:44:46,941 --> 00:44:48,900
homemade catapult and they're eating 
this meat over the fire,

887
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:53,901
telling stories for thousand years 
before anybody writes anything down,

888
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,580
you're dealing with the echoes of 
savages.

889
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:05,030
That's really what you're dealing with.
Literally sitting in front of a fire 

890
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:08,930
eating meat that they cooked.
They killed with some fucking flint 

891
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,150
knife.
Their ideas still hot.

892
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:15,390
Our modern minds.
That is so cool.

893
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,360
No crazy at goes of savages.
I love it.

894
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:19,320
Yeah.
What it is,

895
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:23,670
it's a ghost story.
It's like everyone's brain is haunted by

896
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:27,030
this ancient goes story.
They still floating around in there.

897
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:29,770
We believe it so much and we're so good

898
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:34,810
terrified of abandoning it.
That even now some part of me is I talk 

899
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:39,701
about rising beyond religion.
Some part of me that grew up mildly 

900
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:43,100
religious might still a little part of 
me is like,

901
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:43,430
Ugh,

902
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,990
you're going to curse yourself.
If you talk about Jehovah,

903
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:52,020
be careful.
It's still get to your man.

904
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,210
It'll get to you because

905
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:58,620
for what?
We're just getting our heads up out of 

906
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,910
the goddamn water of delusion here and,
but you know,

907
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:05,970
not all religions,
it's important to note that not all 

908
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:05,970
religions have got their feet in the 
mud.

909
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,810
Got To stick up for Buddhism.
It does not have.

910
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,550
It's not kicking digging its heels in 
and point.

911
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,420
It mutates.
It's not about believing in,

912
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,630
not all of it's got so many different 
forms,

913
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:20,500
but it's about believing in certain 
fundamental truths in the universe.

914
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,700
Not also doesn't seem very greedy.
They're never asking you for money.

915
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:28,701
You never see a Buddhist late night 
televangelists with fucking robes on or 

916
00:46:28,701 --> 00:46:31,150
rolex telling people.
Every time you write a check to me,

917
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,700
Buddha,
I become very happy,

918
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:34,220
very happy.
Come with they check.

919
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:37,920
All of a sudden he's Italian,
Father Guido Sarducci.

920
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:38,790
Yeah,
you're right.

921
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:39,540
You know what I mean?
I mean,

922
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:44,541
they don't have a late night TV shows.
They don't have slicked back hair and 

923
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:45,890
wives with plastic faces.
They don't drive rolls royces.

924
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,630
They're just,
they're just trying to figure out life.

925
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:50,310
They're just trying to get through 
guaranteed.

926
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:55,311
There's still sect of Buddhism that have
the same kind of built in guilt 

927
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:55,920
principles course,
right?

928
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,140
Whenever people getting control of 
anything.

929
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,270
Yeah,
yeah,

930
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,560
but,
but the,

931
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,340
the,
the,

932
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:04,640
uh,
Buddhism as an example of,

933
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,410
of a religion that can radically 
transform your life,

934
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:14,411
minus at God just by the,
the focused processed or not processed,

935
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:21,521
the focus,
disciplined assimilation of certain 

936
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:24,101
basic principles through meditation.
You'll start losing the conception or 

937
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,100
the idea of where you stop and the 
universe starts.

938
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,580
That's what Buddhism does.
It dissolves that membrane between what 

939
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,831
you think you are and what everything 
else is through these meditative 

940
00:47:37,831 --> 00:47:41,581
practices and contemplations and you 
really can pop out of your little I and 

941
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,970
get into the big I through Buddhas are 
and that's pretty bad ass,

942
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:51,030
but and I think other forms of 
Christianity that invite you to lose 

943
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:56,221
yourself and love or lose yourself and 
selflessness or the idea of just like 

944
00:47:56,801 --> 00:48:00,490
going from a receiver to a transmitter 
permanently.

945
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:05,910
That's pretty bad ass too and that can 
radically transform your life and that 

946
00:48:06,221 --> 00:48:08,190
God that they're talking about the god 
of love.

947
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:12,520
He's a god that we're in right now,
but both of those two things are various

948
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:17,521
ways of losing your little I and merging
into the big guy and those are two 

949
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:20,980
that's very beautiful and I don't know 
enough about Islam to understand all the

950
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:25,981
varying types of it,
but I guarantee there's some version of 

951
00:48:25,981 --> 00:48:28,921
Islam based on the poetry of Rumi and 
the mistakes that also points to this 

952
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:31,690
same.
A dissolution of the idea or the concept

953
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:36,691
of the little eye and merging into the 
big eye and that that thing that shift 

954
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:42,930
in the human in human society.
If that happened,

955
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,640
that's how we could get off the planet,
but it for that.

956
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,020
Do we want to get off the planet?

957
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,700
God,
look at the fucking universe.

958
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:53,140
It's beautiful.
Awesome.

959
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:58,260
Yeah.
I'm fucking missing this here and we're 

960
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,680
going to do it.
We're going to go somewhere else and get

961
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:02,620
hit by a meteor there.
Weightlessness brother.

962
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,960
We're just going to experience 
weightlessness.

963
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:06,480
Think about that either.
Listen,

964
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,330
he's not like Manson.
Listen brother.

965
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,310
What are you listening?
Man?

966
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:14,470
Weightlessness.
So you get to experience the.

967
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:19,530
The you get to as you get to take.
I know I sound out of my business is 

968
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:19,770
terrible for your body.
You know,

969
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:24,820
you get osteoporosis and shit.
You know what else is terrible for your 

970
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:24,860
body?
Weight,

971
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,800
weight being stuck on a fucking planet.
We can,

972
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:29,810
but your body's designed for this.
It's true,

973
00:49:29,811 --> 00:49:33,530
but a lot of people say that.
The reason they say that the majority of

974
00:49:33,531 --> 00:49:37,190
our DNA or the information in there now 
I'm starting to lift from Timothy Leary,

975
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:42,191
it's so bad ass,
but that the DNA inside of us is not the

976
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:47,201
information there hasn't even been like 
barely used yet because encoded within 

977
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:51,731
it is exactly the same step encoded 
within whatever makes a caterpillar 

978
00:49:51,731 --> 00:49:52,590
turning into a butterfly.
And that,

979
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:57,850
uh,
right now our brains are based on not 

980
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,391
being able to fly.
Our brains are based on being able to 

981
00:50:01,391 --> 00:50:01,610
walk North,
south,

982
00:50:01,611 --> 00:50:02,360
east and west.

983
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,230
But most people,
they don't.

984
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,810
When they're giving directions,
they don't talk about altitude,

985
00:50:05,811 --> 00:50:06,710
you know,
that's not in,

986
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,440
that's not built in the way that we move
around.

987
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:14,441
So the idea of how much more our brains 
would evolve if we removed the planet 

988
00:50:14,991 --> 00:50:19,991
earth from the equation and now realize 
that we exist in an infinite space where

989
00:50:20,481 --> 00:50:24,440
there is one day where there is just one
day happening right now.

990
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:27,440
We think that there's this day that 
keeps happening over and again,

991
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:32,441
just because the goddamn planet goes 
from a light side to a dark side over 

992
00:50:32,441 --> 00:50:33,080
and over again.
And it gives us incredible illusion.

993
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:35,390
It kind of metronome of time that we 
think,

994
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,700
oh yeah,
there's days and because there's days,

995
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:42,701
there's years and all these years fold 
together to create a lifetime when the 

996
00:50:42,701 --> 00:50:43,430
truth of matter is,
there is not a day.

997
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,850
There were either not a bunch of 
different days there just one day or no 

998
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:48,850
day.

999
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:49,400
There's no time,
there's no space,

1000
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:53,000
there's infinite beingness.
That's what we're in right now.

1001
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:55,790
But because of our current situation on 
this fucking gravity,

1002
00:50:55,791 --> 00:51:00,791
well,
it's given the illusion of days and 

1003
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,521
minutes and seconds and then want whole 
lives become a race to fill those days 

1004
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:08,890
and minutes and seconds and,
and be on places on time and get mad 

1005
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:11,531
because people aren't there on time.
And the whole fucking thing is just a 

1006
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:11,531
wreck.
It's just a wreck.

1007
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:15,130
So one reason that would be nice to fly 
with this gravity where?

1008
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,210
Well,
aside from the fact that would be fun to

1009
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:18,710
float in space,
there's.

1010
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:19,610
I mean,
come on man,

1011
00:51:19,611 --> 00:51:21,140
there's so many things that you could 
do.

1012
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,550
So like it's Disneyland,
zero who'd be amazing.

1013
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:27,050
You could go,
there's this ride,

1014
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:32,051
there's that Rod.
Can you imagine what fucking UFC would 

1015
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:34,550
look like in zero gravity?
Everybody would turn to soup.

1016
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,320
What do you mean?
Bones would break?

1017
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:41,350
Everybody's body would dissolve.
You're assuming that they haven't 

1018
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:45,460
clearly in this equation,
this ridiculous fantasy I'm having of 

1019
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,200
floating in space.
Uh,

1020
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,530
they've developed ways to like early too
generate gravity.

1021
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,160
Since I'm fantasizing here,
I get to say they've developed what?

1022
00:51:55,161 --> 00:52:00,161
Fuck it was true.
Then do it like a double gravity that 

1023
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:00,910
will you come back to Earth.
You're strongest where you go.

1024
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,160
If you wanted him,
shit.

1025
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,570
That would be like the new thing that 
UFC guys would get popped doing.

1026
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,430
Dude,
he was hanging out in double gravity.

1027
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,020
Oh,
that motherfucker.

1028
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:10,640
That bitch.
Yeah.

1029
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:13,430
He's got double strong bones.
It's fucking head.

1030
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:18,431
Got An inch wider Joe.
We got to go into space because it's 

1031
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:22,871
like,
I think it's just built into human 

1032
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:22,871
beings to want to migrate.
It's we came,

1033
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:25,370
we virus flirt with.
Yeah we are,

1034
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:25,820
but what?

1035
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:30,820
But you know,
they're finding out now that you can re 

1036
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,020
code viruses to fight cancer.
They're finding out now that viruses can

1037
00:52:33,021 --> 00:52:38,021
actually be transformed into things that
are good instead of things that are 

1038
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:41,651
destructive and that is my hippie 
ideology in my naive belief that there 

1039
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:48,041
is a way that human beings can be re 
coated through technology and 

1040
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:52,700
psychedelics and through some uninvented
thing that hasn't happened yet,

1041
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,880
that creates a kind of state of 
technologically enhanced empathy that 

1042
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,710
allows us to transcend these invisible 
brain boundaries created by the echoes 

1043
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:04,580
of the savages,
as you said,

1044
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,940
and once that happens,
one of the byproducts of that,

1045
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:12,941
and by the way,
you don't have to leave the planet and 

1046
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:12,941
whenever I start yapping about optimum,
appreciate it.

1047
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:14,330
I'll be here.
You want to go fishing,

1048
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,530
you don't have to leave the planet,
but a lot of us would like to experience

1049
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:21,140
what that's like and that's one of the 
byproducts,

1050
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:26,141
but maybe another part of the byproduct 
of this kind of merging or fusion is 

1051
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:28,830
give a fuck about going into the 
universe

1052
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,650
because you realize you are the 
universe.

1053
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,970
Yeah.
That's where I'm at,

1054
00:53:31,971 --> 00:53:33,630
Bro.
Cool.

1055
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:39,290
I think space travel is a.
It sounds awesome.

1056
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:44,380
It sounds like a really fun thing and I 
bet perspective wise getting above the 

1057
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:48,221
earth would be magnificent for you.
It'd be probably be life changing 

1058
00:53:48,221 --> 00:53:49,790
because a lot of those guys like Edgar 
Mitchell,

1059
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,530
whilst astronauts,
the Apollo guys,

1060
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,130
they talked about the experience being 
like transcendent.

1061
00:53:55,230 --> 00:54:00,230
If there was something about being above
the earth and I think if we could get 

1062
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,480
everybody to just fucking fly above the 
earth to.

1063
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,900
That's what we really could shift a lot 
of consciousness.

1064
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:09,930
We get everybody to go into like near 
Earth orbit and just see like,

1065
00:54:09,981 --> 00:54:14,981
look at this thing that we're on and 
look at all this silly bullshit we're 

1066
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:18,371
involved in now.
Look at all that because that doesn't 

1067
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:22,901
have a roof that goes on forever,
so we're down here tripping out about 

1068
00:54:22,971 --> 00:54:26,280
this guy believes in that book and that 
God leaves in this bucket.

1069
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,480
It looks so stupid.
It's like you ever been in an argument 

1070
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,411
with like a brother or sister and then 
your parents come over and we'll you're 

1071
00:54:35,411 --> 00:54:37,130
arguing about just instantly seems so 
fucking dumb will either.

1072
00:54:37,131 --> 00:54:39,920
Like what are you finding about.
She's used my pay approach.

1073
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,530
It's not European brush like,
oh my God,

1074
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:46,180
we're fooled like I want to pretend to 
be like older now.

1075
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:49,460
Want to pretend to be more mature,
but I'm still six.

1076
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:53,150
You know what I mean?
When you look up and you're looking down

1077
00:54:53,151 --> 00:54:54,530
at our conflicts,
all of them,

1078
00:54:54,531 --> 00:54:57,440
every single one of them and you compare
it to infinity,

1079
00:54:57,441 --> 00:55:02,441
it looks so fucking stupid that we're 
wasting our time worrying about getting 

1080
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:07,100
rid of the word bossy.
We're wasting our time with stupid shit.

1081
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,670
We just constantly distracted by stupid 
shit.

1082
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,970
That's right.
Yeah.

1083
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:12,870
That's it,
man.

1084
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,900
That's it.
That's the kind of epiphany that the 

1085
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,190
planet needs in mass and then once that 
epiphany happens,

1086
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,740
who knows the end result,
but is it in,

1087
00:55:22,741 --> 00:55:26,400
you know,
the skeptic and the cynic would be right

1088
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,220
up until not very long ago,
it'd be like,

1089
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:30,660
well,
that's never going to fucking happen.

1090
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,770
See,
I don't like those words.

1091
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,510
I don't like.
That's never gonna happen.

1092
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,400
I like.
That would be difficult,

1093
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:37,900
but amazing.
If it can happen.

1094
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:43,320
That's what I guess what everything that
we do today never happened before.

1095
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:47,650
So that whole it's never going to happen
is horse shit.

1096
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:52,860
If you go back to 500 fucking years ago 
and you bring them into a podcast 

1097
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,680
studio,
take someone,

1098
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:58,681
throw them in a time machine,
throw him here in 2014 sitting in that 

1099
00:55:58,681 --> 00:56:01,180
chair and explain to them what the fuck 
is going on right now.

1100
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:06,450
They wouldn't even be able to grab it.
It would be nothing about what you were 

1101
00:56:06,671 --> 00:56:08,920
saying.
Even if you could speak their language,

1102
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:12,870
even if you could explain to them 
conceptually what a computer is the.

1103
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:17,740
There was no fucking way they would ever
be able to imagine that this is real.

1104
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:21,760
Do you could just download movies on 
Netflix and watch them,

1105
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,160
Pam flying through the air

1106
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,800
on why fly?
Like what the fuck are you saying?

1107
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:32,050
It's not even connected anything.
You have a magic box in front of you 

1108
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,230
that's watching people fuck on it.
This isn't the most insane thing ever.

1109
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,480
No one ever saw this coming.
Okay?

1110
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:40,190
So whenever it's like,
Eh,

1111
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,480
it'll never happen.
Anything can happen.

1112
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,890
Almost anything.
Yeah.

1113
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:49,540
And eventually anything,
almost anything.

1114
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:54,541
We're going to get some fucking 
molecular control over this universe on 

1115
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:55,600
some really deep level.
At one point,

1116
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:57,700
if,
if technology keeps evolving,

1117
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:00,220
it's not going to be just that we can 
blow things up.

1118
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:05,490
We might be able to build things.
We might be able to create fucking 

1119
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:08,191
universes.
We might literally have a universe 

1120
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,621
button that someone advanced one day 
where we can walk by the Science Museum 

1121
00:57:10,621 --> 00:57:11,440
and create your own universe.
Do you want to do that?

1122
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,400
Okay.
Press that button.

1123
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,350
Boom.
And we hear it.

1124
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:19,351
Some of them from throughout the fucking
cosmos because a new universe bubble 

1125
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:22,470
just got shoved into that fucking,
you know,

1126
00:57:22,471 --> 00:57:27,471
those,
those basketballs when you like the 

1127
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:29,161
buzzer goes off and you're at a carnival
and you gotta throw basketballs and the 

1128
00:57:29,161 --> 00:57:32,190
basketball to just bounce it around that
little pit of basketballs and your 

1129
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:32,190
truck.
And um,

1130
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,580
that's universes and every,
every you press that button.

1131
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,240
You just made a universe.
Debbie,

1132
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Debbie Landia,
and we're just going to have fucking 

1133
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,540
universe buttons all over the universe 
app on your phone.

1134
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:44,290
Fuck it.
I feel it.

1135
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:49,291
Create a couple of universities today.
People being competition to see who 

1136
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:50,110
created more universes while they were 
at work.

1137
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,030
Yeah,
man,

1138
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,800
that's beautiful.
Yeah.

1139
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:54,180
That,
that

1140
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:57,230
this universe brought to you by Yahoo.
Oh my God.

1141
00:57:57,231 --> 00:58:01,760
How much better you can make your own 
fucking universe better songs.

1142
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:03,230
You listened to the five second

1143
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,180
sponsor.
Yeah.

1144
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,730
See,
I love that semen.

1145
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,900
What you just said is so beautiful 
because even as ridiculous as it may 

1146
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,041
sound,
it's still acknowledges and accepts the 

1147
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,760
principle of novelty and the idea that 
you don't know what's going to happen 

1148
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,460
and that idea of not knowing what's 
gonna happen.

1149
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,360
That is this Buddhist teacher.
I'm really into his teacher.

1150
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:30,130
This guy I,
John Chai,

1151
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:33,480
was this like forest monk party.
With that.

1152
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,350
Imagine that I want to make a movie.
I John Chow,

1153
00:58:36,351 --> 00:58:37,250
the forest monk.

1154
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:39,660
He's a.
he's a,

1155
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,800
he's a,
you know they're are these Buddhist 

1156
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:44,800
forest monks.
They live in the forest.

1157
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,510
They sit at the edge of open graves and 
watch bodies decompose.

1158
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,820
They can process and understand the fact
that we are impermanent,

1159
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,610
which is something Jack Kornfield did,
which is amazing,

1160
00:58:55,611 --> 00:58:57,050
but yeah,
they'd sit at the end.

1161
00:58:57,051 --> 00:59:02,051
Just watch for days.
You just sit and watch corpses rot so 

1162
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:05,630
that you clearly digest the fact that 
you're going to die because you are made

1163
00:59:05,631 --> 00:59:10,631
of the same matter.
You're not going to make it out of this 

1164
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,360
so that you understand your attachment 
to the body is an attachment to a thing 

1165
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,070
that is completely impermanent and part 
of the process anyway.

1166
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:20,450
This one of the things he said is when 
you go into an experience,

1167
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:23,300
go it not knowing what's going to 
happen.

1168
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:28,480
Go into it,
understanding that today you don't know 

1169
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:28,480
what's going to happen.

1170
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:33,820
Tune into that frequency.
Tune into that place of like you really 

1171
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,700
don't know,
Matt and all the ways that you think you

1172
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:39,701
know and all the experiences that you've
had and everything that you've used to 

1173
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,911
determine how things are going to be.
It's gone devoured by the time it's not 

1174
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:47,651
there anymore.
There's just this one moment right now 

1175
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:50,710
and you've been using their construct.
How things tend to workout is a 

1176
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:54,041
protective mechanism because you can't 
accept the fact that you are infinity 

1177
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:58,750
experiencing itself as this impermanent 
moat of meat and so that moving into 

1178
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:02,750
those places is so exhilarating.
It's so exhilarating,

1179
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,900
and if we do that as a planet instead of
thinking what everyone fucking thinks 

1180
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,831
are,
most people think which is war is 

1181
01:00:11,831 --> 01:00:11,831
inevitable,
conflict is inevitable.

1182
01:00:11,831 --> 01:00:16,270
It'll always be fighting.
If you go into it with the idea of like 

1183
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,270
maybe not just maybe not.
Maybe we can really figure out a way to 

1184
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:22,310
do the pull up,
pull us out of the God damn primordial,

1185
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:27,490
gory muck of believing invisible symbols
that make it okay to kill children.

1186
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:32,830
Maybe there's a way to pull that out and
end up floating in space or laying in a 

1187
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:39,341
fucking super utopia where you're 
psychically ta merged with the entire 

1188
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:42,620
universe through technology.
Why not?

1189
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:43,220
Well,
I

1190
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,790
think it could be both.
I mean that that can happen,

1191
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:51,820
but along the way I think what has 
happened is this mad need for conquering

1192
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:55,670
that people seem to have,
especially men.

1193
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:01,020
I mean,
we go back in history and what do we 

1194
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:01,020
know about history?
History is essentially military history,

1195
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,890
military and technology history,
and occasionally events.

1196
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,150
I mean,
that's what history is.

1197
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,900
The printing press was invented.
The bottom wasn't invented in the boat.

1198
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:13,901
Well,
once the Japanese would not accept the 

1199
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:13,901
use of guns,
they quickly lost at warfare.

1200
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:18,200
I mean that the military history of our 
world is the real history.

1201
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,690
When we talk about,
you know,

1202
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:23,240
not it is what we talk about the civil 
war in this country.

1203
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:26,000
We talk about when we fought the 
British,

1204
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,600
we will,
we.

1205
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:31,620
There's all this.
The real history of our world is a 

1206
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,670
history of conflict that's fucking crazy
in,

1207
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,180
in conflict.

1208
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,080
This is what's fucked up.
There's innovation to Adam.

1209
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:43,070
Bomb came about because we had a threat.
If there was no threat,

1210
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:47,030
there would be no adam bomb.
I mean it literally was invented because

1211
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:51,530
people were terrified of someone 
inventing it first so that.

1212
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:53,990
I'm not saying that it's good thing to 
have nuclear weapons,

1213
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:58,991
but what nuclear weapons represent is a 
human mind set forth with resources to 

1214
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:06,101
pursue a goal and what is possible.
What is possible is this intense 

1215
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:10,780
ultimate nuclear destruction possibility
and human beings created that because of

1216
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:13,640
conflict.
Not saying that that's a good thing,

1217
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:18,641
but I'm saying that involved in this 
conflict and struggle that people have 

1218
01:02:18,641 --> 01:02:20,130
always had the desire to conquer and 
fucking

1219
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,340
live in a big house with a fat Mercedes 
and be fucking consume and private 

1220
01:02:25,681 --> 01:02:30,681
chaired and I want an on an island and 
raw that feeds this machine that makes 

1221
01:02:32,731 --> 01:02:37,731
technology that feeds this machine that 
is ultimately advancing us past the 

1222
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:41,991
barbaric state that feeds this 
interconnectedness that we all have now 

1223
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:46,431
on the Internet,
right to the all that is because people 

1224
01:02:46,431 --> 01:02:48,690
before us were struggling and figuring 
things out and trying to communicate.

1225
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,190
You got to send a teletype today,
Da da Dee da.

1226
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,550
Dee had to send a message to my friend 
on the west coast.

1227
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:58,730
He couldn't be on trouble.
People over there can't be trusted and 

1228
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:04,400
all this shit was invented in order for 
people to continue pushing this goal of 

1229
01:03:05,401 --> 01:03:10,401
conquering new lands and new places,
new ideas and new fucking markets and 

1230
01:03:10,401 --> 01:03:12,510
you know,
and new natural resources that are being

1231
01:03:12,511 --> 01:03:17,511
tapped into and it's all a part of this 
thing that it's advancing us ultimately.

1232
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,950
So at the same time,
at the same time,

1233
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:24,120
we're all this crazy struggle and trauma
and old bullshit's going on.

1234
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,560
Darpa technology is being used on the 
Internet,

1235
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:29,760
you know?
I mean,

1236
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:34,761
didn't they?
Didn't they kind of advent of the 

1237
01:03:34,761 --> 01:03:34,761
Internet?
Darpa,

1238
01:03:34,761 --> 01:03:35,100
who was the.
Who was the inventor of the Internet.

1239
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:37,440
I always forget that tidbit.
It's so sad.

1240
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:38,850
I should know that.
Something bizarre.

1241
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,270
Like,
okay,

1242
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:42,780
let's pull it up,
but my point being they are making crazy

1243
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:47,781
robots.
Superintelligent robots you run up to 

1244
01:03:47,781 --> 01:03:48,510
when you kick them and they balance 
themselves out and bounced back up.

1245
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:52,410
They're making these robot cheetah has 
that can run like 60 miles an hour.

1246
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,610
Have you seen those fucking things?
Yes,

1247
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,090
I have exoskeletons.
Yeah.

1248
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,280
That's some seriously high level shit 
and it's all being made from military 

1249
01:04:01,321 --> 01:04:06,321
money.
All that shit's being made to make 

1250
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:06,390
better weapons and ot mean it.

1251
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:08,970
Isn't it military money essentially 
Darpa?

1252
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:09,900
Yeah.
What does it stand for?

1253
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,960
Darpa is the Defense Department and the 
Department of Defense.

1254
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:15,270
I don't know what does stand for 
something.

1255
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,360
Yeah,
but what it is is like when it,

1256
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,470
I mean,
you know,

1257
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,070
obviously don't want defense,
airborne reconnaissance projects office.

1258
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:25,830
You obviously don't want them using it 
on you,

1259
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:31,100
but it's pretty fucking awesome stuff.
I mean they're making robots do that 

1260
01:04:31,651 --> 01:04:34,740
run.
They're making these like horse things,

1261
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,900
the kickup and they fucking,
they,

1262
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:42,060
they move like the balance themselves 
out about the new flying aircraft 

1263
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:47,031
carrier.
Everyone's talking about the carries 

1264
01:04:47,031 --> 01:04:48,771
drones on its back fuck floating drone 
that's fucking Goddamn starcraft 

1265
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:52,610
shipment and if you think about it,
that's the,

1266
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:57,720
that's like the peak of technology when 
it comes to robotics and function.

1267
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:02,830
As far as like,
I didn't mean I don't know about 

1268
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:02,830
robotics as far as like a assembly line 
stuff.

1269
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:03,120
I don't,
I don't.

1270
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,520
I mean maybe that's like super 
complicated at this point,

1271
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:08,700
but robotics as far as like things that 
are on their own,

1272
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:14,210
they're just walking around or flying 
around like things that aren't attached 

1273
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:18,231
to you and you either use remote control
or they know what the fuck they're 

1274
01:05:18,231 --> 01:05:18,370
doing.
Autonomous Defense

1275
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,400
robots,
those things try to go into war with 

1276
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:23,400
that.
That's the equivalent of the airplane.

1277
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,291
By the way,
when you were talking about the 

1278
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:28,291
invention of the airplane,

1279
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:31,860
Darpa wants to build an avengers like 
flying aircraft carrier to make drones 

1280
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:36,061
even more effective.
Start becoming like big mobs of birds.

1281
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:39,910
Like you know when you see like birds 
fly around and they're all in unison.

1282
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,690
Like when those start being drones 
attacking,

1283
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:45,730
that's when to Dunkin happen,
man.

1284
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,760
I mean that's going to be one of the big
privacy issues in the next decade is 

1285
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:54,241
going to be drones.
People are just gonna be able to fly 

1286
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:54,241
drones over your house,
check up on you,

1287
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,010
like your girlfriend's going to be like 
sooth them.

1288
01:05:56,011 --> 01:06:01,011
Motherfuckers up to him.
Fucking send a drone is way to fly the 

1289
01:06:01,011 --> 01:06:01,210
drone over.
So you do today Duncan.

1290
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:02,650
Oh,
nothing.

1291
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,090
Just wash the car.
And

1292
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:09,270
did you notice a tiny mosquito sitting 
above your computer as you were jerking 

1293
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:14,550
off to that?
Does this casting because it's outside 

1294
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:17,680
the window because everybody thinks it's
a big thing.

1295
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:20,020
That's.
It's not a big thing man.

1296
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:22,750
That the drones that everyone's like,
you have the drones will be flying over.

1297
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:25,150
No,
they're not going to be flying over.

1298
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:30,360
They're going to be these microscopic 
little orbs that sort of drift through 

1299
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,140
like a mist gathering information,
gathering,

1300
01:06:32,141 --> 01:06:34,870
biometric data,
looking at eye dilation,

1301
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:39,871
whatever they want your fucking pulse.
They give like maybe measure your 

1302
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:40,990
exhalations to see what kind of food 
you've been eating.

1303
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,240
Maybe they can even tell how much you've
been drinking,

1304
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:48,450
but the idea that we're gonna have the 
luxury much longer of looking up and 

1305
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:49,630
seeing those cute,
quaint,

1306
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,760
little flying big John's.
No Way,

1307
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:54,010
man.
We're talking tiny little.

1308
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,810
They must already exist.

1309
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:58,630
I mean it's the most obvious.
They I know that the.

1310
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,340
If you go to like a in DC they have like
the spy museum and they show,

1311
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,890
you know,
a little bugs,

1312
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,090
bugs that.
That's why I guess what,

1313
01:07:07,091 --> 01:07:08,460
that's what I call them.
Your House is bugged,

1314
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:09,660
you know,
so yeah,

1315
01:07:09,661 --> 01:07:10,720
that really is.
I want to,

1316
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:12,880
I don't know,
but it seems like a possibility.

1317
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:15,250
I'm going to say it's real for now.
God Damn the Internet.

1318
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:16,960
Anyone can look at shit up in the old 
days.

1319
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:21,961
You'd just say what it was joe,
with more advanced understanding of the 

1320
01:07:21,961 --> 01:07:23,260
CIA,
but the um,

1321
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,910
the,
you know,

1322
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,960
how are you gonna?
How are you going to scan every ant in 

1323
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:30,960
your house?
How are you going to scan every moth?

1324
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,940
Reverie,
nat drifting by houses are going to have

1325
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:38,941
to have force fields that shut those 
things down when they fly in or some 

1326
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:41,170
kind of way to dismantle or detect 
drones.

1327
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:42,930
Yeah,
there,

1328
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,960
there was A.
I'm trying to remember what the actual 

1329
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,791
story was,
but there was a technology they were 

1330
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:53,731
working on that was essentially going to
be like a grain of rice and it's going 

1331
01:07:53,731 --> 01:07:54,940
to have wifi in.
It is going to have a camera.

1332
01:07:55,170 --> 01:08:00,170
It's going to have a gps signal and it's
going to be able to transmit video and 

1333
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:05,730
it'd be the size of a grain of rice and 
you could like literally scatter them 

1334
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:09,490
throughout a city and you would have an 
accurate view of the entire city all the

1335
01:08:09,491 --> 01:08:14,491
time.
Like they would force people to start 

1336
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:17,461
using certain amount of grains of rice,
like type things in all of their house.

1337
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:19,890
Like,
well we have a 30 grain house,

1338
01:08:19,891 --> 01:08:24,891
so hey,
if anything the government wants to 

1339
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:24,891
know.
I mean there's 30 grains in my house,

1340
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:29,580
like one grain in your bathroom,
one grain in your living room so they 

1341
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,861
know where you are at all times and it's
got a wide angle lens that's a little 

1342
01:08:32,861 --> 01:08:36,101
tiny mosquito one,
but this one I'm talking about isn't 

1343
01:08:36,101 --> 01:08:38,951
even a bug.
What I'm talking about is actually a 

1344
01:08:38,951 --> 01:08:39,320
grain of rice.
I mean they're going to scatter them.

1345
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:40,550
Yeah,
like Paulin.

1346
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,690
It's like these,
these Darpa flying and this is like Alex

1347
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:49,690
Jones worst nightmares that Darpa 
aircraft carrier flies over and doesn't 

1348
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:53,570
release little mini drones.
It just releases a dust of tiny,

1349
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:58,750
a surveillance technology.
These weird pollinators that just sort 

1350
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:03,230
of float on top of everything,
transmit back whatever you want,

1351
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:08,390
we'll show you inside of houses,
it'll show you what's inside of people 

1352
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:11,921
because some people are going to inhale 
it and based on like maybe the thing 

1353
01:09:11,921 --> 01:09:13,250
communicates with their phones so it 
gets a gps,

1354
01:09:13,251 --> 01:09:18,251
it gets their identity and now it's 
inside of the being and it can start 

1355
01:09:18,251 --> 01:09:20,030
saying what they're eating,
what their health is like.

1356
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:25,180
You know,
Google is already working on this like 

1357
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:25,430
an ingestible cancer detecting 
surveillance technology.

1358
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,980
It's like people think this surveillance
is going to stop.

1359
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:33,010
Stop with just the outside of us,
but all these new like health measuring 

1360
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:34,580
devices,
the Fitbit,

1361
01:09:34,581 --> 01:09:37,730
the Apple Watch that gauge biometric and
know.

1362
01:09:37,731 --> 01:09:42,731
Right.
It's crazy how much of that stuff can 

1363
01:09:42,731 --> 01:09:43,610
you imagine like dropping that shit on 
an army and being able to get feedback.

1364
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:46,130
Not just aware of the army was,
but what they've been eating,

1365
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:48,960
what their blood pressure is,
what their adrenaline,

1366
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,080
adrenaline levels.
They're like,

1367
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:56,230
you know,
like you could get a full feedback of 

1368
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:56,230
like,
well this,

1369
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,950
these soldiers are mildly terrified 
right now.

1370
01:09:57,951 --> 01:10:02,951
Let's see if we can up their adrenaline 
gland production using our nano bots 

1371
01:10:03,591 --> 01:10:06,110
that they inhaled while they were 
getting ready for the fight.

1372
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:07,700
So they all have heart attacks.

1373
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:13,550
There was a story from a long time ago,
I believe it was like the 19th,

1374
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,240
19 seventies or eighties.
I forget what it was,

1375
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:23,540
but they shouldn't even say what the 
what the year was because I don't 

1376
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:23,880
remember.
I don't even remember what city was,

1377
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:29,090
what they wanted to find out.
What would happen if someone had 

1378
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:29,580
released some sort of a biological agent
on a city,

1379
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:34,850
like if there's some sort of a poison 
gas or something that got released on 

1380
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,791
the city,
like how would it disperse and how far 

1381
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:37,791
would it go.
So they,

1382
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:41,730
they literally blew some like material 
that they could measure on the city,

1383
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:46,940
like blew it on all these people made 
these fucking people breathe it in and 

1384
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,330
sprayed it.
I mean that's like one of the origins of

1385
01:10:48,331 --> 01:10:52,350
the idea of chem trails is based on the 
reality that they have done goofy shit.

1386
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
We tortured some folks torch it.
Yeah man,

1387
01:10:58,131 --> 01:11:03,131
they do it and of course it's like the 
ultimate or weapon would be a way to 

1388
01:11:03,131 --> 01:11:04,880
like get infinite data on the thing that
you're fighting.

1389
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:09,020
I mean it's the primordial essence of 
war is knowing what your enemies doing.

1390
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:10,610
That's the most,
one of the most important,

1391
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:15,611
if not the most important facet of war.
So the idea that you can surveil them 

1392
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:20,850
without them being aware at all.
I mean that commander who uh,

1393
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,380
recently was like,
you know,

1394
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:27,440
they noticed that the press is like gone
from b now you should be scared of isis 

1395
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:29,850
suit kind of.
Now it's turned into like,

1396
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:32,590
looks like isis is backing down.
But uh,

1397
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:35,430
this commander,
uh,

1398
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:40,970
to make the announcement about the 
potential death of one of their leaders 

1399
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,090
said,
we hear you.

1400
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:44,520
We hear what you're saying,
to kind of like,

1401
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:46,490
you know,
imply that we're.

1402
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,560
So you're being surveilled that we hear 
everything you're doing and we know 

1403
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,880
everywhere you're going.
And I think that's probably true.

1404
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:59,150
And that's got to be a little bit on the
terrifying side when you realize that 

1405
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:04,970
you're being surveilled by a super power
with technology that probably no one on 

1406
01:12:04,981 --> 01:12:06,930
the planet is aware that exists yet.

1407
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:07,600
Yeah,
for sure.

1408
01:12:07,601 --> 01:12:12,601
I mean,
if you think about what Darpa has shown 

1409
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:14,881
us they can do,
who knows what kind of agencies the 

1410
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:15,480
government has been fucking cooking up 
these crazy with.

1411
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:16,630
Yeah,
sure,

1412
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:21,631
absolutely.
But isn't that ultimately gonna work 

1413
01:12:21,631 --> 01:12:22,690
against them as well?
Because isn't all technology,

1414
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:25,840
especially technology that you know,
is small,

1415
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:31,170
like not talking about things like 
nuclear weapons and things that are 

1416
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:34,171
difficult to acquire,
but all technology eventually becomes 

1417
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:37,381
easier to acquire.
It starts off being super difficult and 

1418
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:38,530
then x amount of years later everybody's
got it.

1419
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:43,740
So ultimately everyone's going to be 
able to spy on everybody at every point 

1420
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,700
in time forever.
Yeah,

1421
01:12:45,701 --> 01:12:50,701
that's the problem.
Is the problem or does that keep going 

1422
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:55,111
in that same direction?
And do we accept some sort of a 

1423
01:12:55,111 --> 01:12:58,110
biological symbiosis with technology 
that enhances it and makes it even 

1424
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:03,031
better at one point in time?
And then do we eventually figured out 

1425
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:04,930
how to make artificial parts that work 
better than all the parts of our body?

1426
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:07,390
How many people are walking around out 
there with artificial hips?

1427
01:13:07,391 --> 01:13:09,550
Graham Hancock has an artificial hip.
They know it.

1428
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,180
Yeah.
Uh,

1429
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:13,340
Joe Perry has an artificial knee.
I mean we're,

1430
01:13:13,341 --> 01:13:18,341
we're making robots.
They have parts in bodies that are 

1431
01:13:18,341 --> 01:13:18,900
machine that someone invented and 
you're,

1432
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:23,901
you know,
it's being powered still by your tissue 

1433
01:13:23,901 --> 01:13:25,300
and your blood.
But essentially they've put better parts

1434
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:26,770
in than what you had in there.

1435
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:27,620
Yeah,
man.

1436
01:13:27,621 --> 01:13:32,621
I mean it all comes down to at some 
point people have to wake up to the fact

1437
01:13:34,611 --> 01:13:37,700
that they're not just an eye,
but they're also a week.

1438
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,720
At some point you got to wake up to that
fact that you're not just the one little

1439
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:46,721
ewe.
You're directly connected to the entire 

1440
01:13:46,721 --> 01:13:49,160
universe in your tiny little pixel of 
awakenness in this universe.

1441
01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:51,920
But you are the universe eventually 
that's got to happen.

1442
01:13:51,921 --> 01:13:55,690
And privacy,
fear and the terror of being observed or

1443
01:13:55,691 --> 01:14:00,691
in surveilled is 100 percent based on 
the notion of the identity.

1444
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,040
And like one of the last great taboos is
the acknowledgement or the realization 

1445
01:14:06,531 --> 01:14:10,610
that in fact you're not an identity,
you're not a single high.

1446
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:15,900
You're a big guy,
you're a big guy and part of this a 

1447
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,110
merging technology and that's what this 
shit is doing,

1448
01:14:17,111 --> 01:14:18,940
man.
It's not just merging with us.

1449
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:23,940
It's merging us with each other.
Part of what that's doing is dissolving 

1450
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:26,920
the boundary between you and me and 
everyone on the planet right now because

1451
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:31,921
this thing is getting transmitted at God
knows how many people at this point I 

1452
01:14:31,921 --> 01:14:35,791
see the awards on your table.
It's getting transmitted to a shit ton 

1453
01:14:35,791 --> 01:14:36,790
of people right now and that's a form of
merging,

1454
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:41,791
auditory,
merging and obviously the next step is 

1455
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,020
going to be a emerging of consciousness 
through something that scans brain waves

1456
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:47,140
and induces similar emotional states and
other people.

1457
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,580
That's going to happen,
man,

1458
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:53,810
and that's another form of merging.
And then the next step from that is 

1459
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:57,271
recognizing or figuring out a way to 
feel what it's like to no longer have a 

1460
01:14:57,271 --> 01:15:01,000
body yet still have consciousness.
And then that's another form of merging.

1461
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:06,210
That's what we really are,
and somehow the thing you're hopeful 

1462
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:10,620
appraisal of the situation and military 
technologies that somehow through this 

1463
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:14,971
stuff it's going to usher us or push us 
over the boundary from being an idea to 

1464
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,850
being a week.

1465
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:21,370
Well,
maybe that's what never gets taken to 

1466
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:22,811
consideration where things like the 
drake equation that there is no space 

1467
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:24,980
travel because nobody ever bothers.
Once you get to a certain point in time,

1468
01:15:24,981 --> 01:15:25,970
you go,
oh,

1469
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:29,270
I get it.
We can create our own reality.

1470
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:33,020
Like you can get to a point where 
virtual reality and regular reality,

1471
01:15:33,021 --> 01:15:33,330
not,
uh,

1472
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:36,740
not only the indistinguishable but 
they're interchangeable.

1473
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:42,180
Yeah.
You can just experience everything at 

1474
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:42,180
once.

1475
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:42,180
Well,
you can your regular life,

1476
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:46,710
like whatever you deem your regular life
could still exist along with a complete 

1477
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:51,871
virtual reality of your choosing and you
could choose to go back and forth to 

1478
01:15:51,871 --> 01:15:54,250
both places.
I mean the idea that you have one or the

1479
01:15:54,251 --> 01:15:55,180
other,
like,

1480
01:15:55,210 --> 01:16:00,210
no,
we could still keep fucking and going 

1481
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:00,210
into virtual realities that are.
You were,

1482
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:03,370
you were living in Avatar.
You're flying around in a fucking dragon

1483
01:16:03,371 --> 01:16:05,760
and it's just as real as this life just 
take.

1484
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,850
It's going to take some time.

1485
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,640
It is this life.
I mean,

1486
01:16:08,641 --> 01:16:13,641
that's the thing.
It is this life based on the notion of 

1487
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:13,950
that we are one consciousness 
experiencing these.

1488
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:17,370
We always end up talking about this,
but God dammit that is it.

1489
01:16:17,371 --> 01:16:21,270
Like we're snorkeling right now.
We're snorkeling through a technique.

1490
01:16:21,271 --> 01:16:26,271
I think Terence Mckenna,
I compare this to as technological reef 

1491
01:16:26,271 --> 01:16:27,450
or something.
It's an incredible essay.

1492
01:16:27,451 --> 01:16:32,451
I don't know where it came from,
but it's like technology's extruding 

1493
01:16:32,451 --> 01:16:33,990
from time and space and we're beings 
that live.

1494
01:16:33,991 --> 01:16:37,200
They are like fish swimming through this
technological reef.

1495
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:37,790
Will you this

1496
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:41,570
awesome idea of the attractor.
Mckenna had this idea that we were being

1497
01:16:41,571 --> 01:16:44,690
pulled toward some ultimate attractor,
you know,

1498
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:46,850
and the strange attractor at the end of 
time.

1499
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yeah,
and the our innovation and novelty and 

1500
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,291
all these different historical events,
everything was leading towards this 

1501
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:59,771
attractor,
which is such a bizarre way to look at 

1502
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:00,650
things but so unique like you,
you hear that and you go,

1503
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:05,680
Ooh,
there's a thing that wants us to build 

1504
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,300
it and it's pulling us through time,
you know,

1505
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:11,330
but it could also just be we want to 
survive and to survive you compete.

1506
01:17:11,331 --> 01:17:13,040
In order to compete,
you have to innovate,

1507
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:18,080
you have to worry about your enemies.
You have to keep going so you can get 

1508
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,771
your common to more monkeys and make 
more monkeys that are like you not like 

1509
01:17:20,771 --> 01:17:24,281
them.
Those Fox does Fox and then you just 

1510
01:17:24,281 --> 01:17:25,850
make it better jets and better missiles.
It better this,

1511
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,740
better that,
and then eventually you figure out,

1512
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:29,360
oh,
I could just do this,

1513
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,580
man,
there's no more war.

1514
01:17:31,581 --> 01:17:33,650
Dead violence,
sadness,

1515
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:38,890
just bliss.
Just blessed man and computer 

1516
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:38,890
maintenance.

1517
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:43,330
Pray in my life that I never seriously 
say I've got to get my common tomorrow.

1518
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,250
Geez,

1519
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:53,470
do you have any more monkeys?
Because that's how you accelerate the 

1520
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:54,020
process.
Because if we still lived in Eden and it

1521
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:55,130
was just,
you know,

1522
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:57,350
our friends,
there's like 20 of us.

1523
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,110
Would we ever even invent boats?
Okay.

1524
01:18:00,111 --> 01:18:02,930
If we lived in this perfect place and 
there was fruit everywhere,

1525
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:08,140
we have an infinite number of animals to
choose to eat in the infinite number of 

1526
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:09,070
fish.
When we're going to win,

1527
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,850
there's only 20 of us.
What are we going to invent?

1528
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,070
What are we going to do?
We're not inventing shit,

1529
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:14,570
man.
We're going to have a good time.

1530
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:16,970
We're going to sit by the campfire and 
laugh.

1531
01:18:16,971 --> 01:18:21,971
We're going to smoke weed because no 
one's going to lock us up in jail for 

1532
01:18:21,971 --> 01:18:22,660
having a plant that makes you happy.
We're going to.

1533
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,080
We're going to have no conflict,
man.

1534
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:24,980
We're going to have zero.

1535
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:30,070
It was just our friends and we all lived
on this unbelievably cool place where 

1536
01:18:30,111 --> 01:18:32,480
there's food everywhere.
What would we ever argue about?

1537
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:35,570
What would we ever invent?
Nothing and nothing.

1538
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,060
We would get together if we had an 
infinite number of food.

1539
01:18:38,061 --> 01:18:39,680
It was just us,
just our friends.

1540
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:44,860
We had an infinite number of food and 
we're healthy and we're in a place 

1541
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,290
together.
We would just be laughing.

1542
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,810
That's what we'd do.
We'd never get anything done.

1543
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:51,020
We wouldn't worry about Ari.
Ari fucking acting kind of weird math.

1544
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,500
Did you take over the kingdom now?
You'd be like,

1545
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:59,560
ah.
Did you see Ra rape that penguin here,

1546
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:01,740
man,
I'm starting to worry about Diaz.

1547
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,380
He might be forming a new political 
party.

1548
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:07,280
Well,
you know,

1549
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:08,870
Diaz.
Really good points.

1550
01:19:08,871 --> 01:19:13,400
I think I'm going to join dss to merge 
with ts and just have one super party.

1551
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:16,310
Why fuck around and give them choices.
Will be pulled.

1552
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:19,250
Both be co presidents.
I've co headlined.

1553
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:20,760
I'll speak up

1554
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,320
president.
I love that.

1555
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:25,340
Well,
I'm not

1556
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:29,080
the vice president of the feature act 
just here two.

1557
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:32,870
I'm opening up for the president for the
first two years of his presidency.

1558
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,250
I'm here to warm the crowd up,

1559
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:35,530
man.
That's cool.

1560
01:19:35,531 --> 01:19:36,070
Well,
yeah.

1561
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:36,940
I don't know,
man.

1562
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,960
I,
I do think that there's something to be 

1563
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,350
said for,
for turbulence being a kind of like the,

1564
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,750
you know,
it's the,

1565
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:48,960
creates the friction that generates the 
heat necessary to fuel whatever this 

1566
01:19:49,061 --> 01:19:53,110
strange technological life form is that 
we're weaving out of nothingness.

1567
01:19:53,111 --> 01:19:58,111
So in that way I think it's a great 
thing and I think that probably as long 

1568
01:19:58,211 --> 01:20:01,090
as you're on a gravity well and a planet
which we all are,

1569
01:20:01,091 --> 01:20:04,870
regardless of the resources around you,
you're still going to get in fights.

1570
01:20:04,871 --> 01:20:07,440
There's still going to be turbulence 
because there's too many of us.

1571
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:12,530
It's because we think that we our eyes 
instead of recognizing that we are one 

1572
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:12,530
organism,
that's

1573
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:14,700
it isn't because Rdq seat and my fucking
fruit.

1574
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,980
Okay?
We as lazy dude.

1575
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:19,060
I went and picked the fruit.
He's fucking eat it.

1576
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:20,970
I don't want us fish.
He brings up this fish dude.

1577
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,650
He goes fishing gear,
legs to go fishing.

1578
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:27,651
Nobody wants to fucking pick fruit.
Fruit's more valuable because it wasn't 

1579
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:33,180
made with fun.
So make me fucking fucking people.

1580
01:20:33,181 --> 01:20:34,680
Go fishing for fun,
man.

1581
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:37,050
You can't say fishing and fruit picking 
is equal.

1582
01:20:37,051 --> 01:20:37,860
Fuck you,
man.

1583
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:39,660
You had a good time.
You asshole.

1584
01:20:39,661 --> 01:20:42,090
You brought back 10 fish.
That must have been a thrill and a half.

1585
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:46,410
That's not the same.
It's not the same.

1586
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:51,590
When you're out there chopping wood,
you're going to give me a fish for all 

1587
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:51,590
this wood that are chopped.
Fuck you.

1588
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:56,271
You had a good time making that fish 
fishing is so god damn funny.

1589
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,180
Not that I don't know if you have to 
lead.

1590
01:20:59,181 --> 01:21:04,181
It seems like the thing as Dan,
but I would know it doesn't have to 

1591
01:21:04,181 --> 01:21:04,320
leave for awhile.
Oh awesome.

1592
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,760
Oh,
I thought I thought I thought.

1593
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:06,420
No,
no.

1594
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:10,290
I'm doing Adam Carolla show today yet.
I think it's like 4:30.

1595
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:11,740
It's alive.
Oh,

1596
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:12,600
that's cool.
Yeah.

1597
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:13,370
Should be fun.
Yeah,

1598
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:13,550
man.

1599
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:18,670
Fishing is a fucking blast.
I just went fishing out in the mobile 

1600
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:18,670
bay.
In Alabama.

1601
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:23,471
And what'd you guys fish for?
We were fishing for trout I guess is 

1602
01:21:23,631 --> 01:21:26,200
what's out there right now.
But you know the,

1603
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,840
we didn't catch anything man.
And we are with this professional 

1604
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,411
fishermen and my dad's friends with and 
he's like this time last year at this 

1605
01:21:35,411 --> 01:21:37,340
place was filled with boats.
But because of the climate is different,

1606
01:21:37,341 --> 01:21:38,480
the basic

1607
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,800
obviously responding is that what's 
going on in the spring,

1608
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:47,500
shrimp eggs end up on the marsh grass 
and get released and then the fish come 

1609
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:52,211
out of the deeper ocean to eat the 
shrimp shrimp bags and then that's when 

1610
01:21:52,211 --> 01:21:56,291
you have the fishing booms.
But it hasn't been happening and some 

1611
01:21:56,391 --> 01:21:57,740
people are a little.
I mean he,

1612
01:21:57,741 --> 01:21:58,950
you know,
you want to,

1613
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:04,120
whenever you're fishing you want to come
up with a reason for not catching a 

1614
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:04,120
fish,
you know.

1615
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:07,481
But some people are a little nervous 
because even though after that terrible 

1616
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:14,230
bp oil spill,
there was actually a boom of more fish 

1617
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:17,741
because they stopped fishing and fish 
production went up or fish fish had a 

1618
01:22:17,741 --> 01:22:20,720
chance to fuck and mate without getting 
ripped out of the ocean by people eating

1619
01:22:20,721 --> 01:22:23,510
them for a season or somethings there's 
more fish.

1620
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,640
Uh,
but then now it's like,

1621
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:26,720
where,
where are they there?

1622
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:30,050
There were just a shit ton of fish here 
at this exact same time last year.

1623
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:32,780
It tends to be like that.
And so,

1624
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:33,470
you know,
who knows,

1625
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:35,900
it's just a weather thing.

1626
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:39,790
Sorry,
could you think of any other animal that

1627
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:43,690
we would tolerate?
Catching and killing the way we tolerate

1628
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:48,720
people catching and killing fish.
Can you think of any other animal we 

1629
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:52,441
would tolerate?
Just got a bunch of machines like a 

1630
01:22:52,441 --> 01:22:54,130
bunch of trucks and we'll get to do is 
we're going to attach a net to it.

1631
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:59,160
We're just going to go run through the 
woods and this net is going to slice 

1632
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,070
down trees at the bottom.
Okay.

1633
01:23:00,071 --> 01:23:05,071
And everything it captures in the net.
We're just going to eat every.

1634
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,070
Now we kind of.
Instead of dolphins getting caught,

1635
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:14,071
we've cut a couple joggers.
Some fucking asshole got caught in my 

1636
01:23:14,071 --> 01:23:14,440
net geography.
I'm here to catch elk.

1637
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,370
You stupid.
Fuck.

1638
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:18,160
I wasn't looking for you.
And you treat people that are so stupid.

1639
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:20,160
They get caught in the net the same way 
they treat dolphins.

1640
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:21,600
I mean by the time they get to and they 
hold,

1641
01:23:21,601 --> 01:23:23,470
they're not dead.
But you got trampled to death.

1642
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:24,700
Yeah.
The poor bastard.

1643
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:26,910
He got caught up in the net right behind
the lcoe kick.

1644
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,000
Kicking him in the head.

1645
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,530
Yeah.
They'd have a name for the joggers.

1646
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:34,740
They calm like asphalt veal or 
something.

1647
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:40,210
Forest meet.
Yeah,

1648
01:23:40,211 --> 01:23:41,560
like yeah.
What do they call it?

1649
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:45,640
Into the eating fruit bats and after 
they call it Bush meat.

1650
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,610
Oh,
that's what they call it.

1651
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:49,210
Like anything call the monkeys.
They call bushmeat.

1652
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,180
Bushmeat the least appealing name for 
anything.

1653
01:23:52,181 --> 01:23:53,370
But yeah,
that.

1654
01:23:53,371 --> 01:23:54,280
Yeah,
that's it is.

1655
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:59,310
There is a,
a part of you when you're fishing that 

1656
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:02,100
has to acknowledge the sadism that's 
happening there because you're using a 

1657
01:24:02,111 --> 01:24:06,130
device from the hellraiser movies to 
Laura thing in.

1658
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:08,530
It's ridiculous.
But you know,

1659
01:24:08,531 --> 01:24:13,531
and I know that ultimately we should 
have compassion for all beings in and 

1660
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:17,020
wish them all a life free of violence.

1661
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:22,160
But fish do eat other fish of course.
Well that's my argument about bears.

1662
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:27,630
Whenever anybody was once say bears are 
cute and like,

1663
01:24:27,631 --> 01:24:30,990
have you ever seen one in real life?
A in the real world and be.

1664
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:33,060
Do you know they eat babies?
Yeah.

1665
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,740
They eat their own babies.
All of them.

1666
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,870
Yeah.
They just eat,

1667
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:38,370
they eat each other.
If one of them dies,

1668
01:24:38,430 --> 01:24:41,760
they just started eating it.
They don't wait awhile back.

1669
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:42,600
No.
They start eating,

1670
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:47,820
but don't they eat the babies because 
it's like there's not enough food for 

1671
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,420
all the babies and it makes more sense 
to eat.

1672
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,920
You're young than to waste resources 
where everyone starves.

1673
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:54,930
I thought that's why they can't.

1674
01:24:55,540 --> 01:25:00,540
No.
The males eat just because they like to 

1675
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,660
eat babies and they like to stop the 
babies from breeding.

1676
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:04,430
Of course they don't know what they're 
not.

1677
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,610
They don't know what the real motivation
is.

1678
01:25:06,611 --> 01:25:09,310
There's a lot of guesses because they 
can't ask the bears obviously,

1679
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,560
but they are pretty pretty sure that 
there's a bunch of factors.

1680
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:18,070
One,
sometimes the males will kill the bears.

1681
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:23,130
The cubs,
because they're hungry sometimes the 

1682
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:26,041
mail and they're easy to kill.
They can just go and grab them and eat 

1683
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:26,041
them,
so they might do it because of that.

1684
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:30,810
They might do it sometimes because they 
want to bring the female back to estrus 

1685
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:34,050
social one to fuck and Shawana have more
babies so they can come because 

1686
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,350
otherwise she's.
She doesn't want to let the fucker.

1687
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:39,410
She got her babies around the darkest,
darkest way.

1688
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:41,770
Dolphins do that.
Dolphins do the same thing.

1689
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,440
It's one of the reasons why female 
dolphins are so promiscuous.

1690
01:25:44,441 --> 01:25:49,441
Apparently they studied dolphins.
They found that that female dolphins 

1691
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:49,480
will have sex with as many males as they
can,

1692
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,840
so that way when they have babies,
nobody knows whose babies who so they 

1693
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,651
leave her alone,
but if she has babies and their babies 

1694
01:25:58,651 --> 01:26:00,340
and you know that you never fucked her,
they just killed the babies.

1695
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:03,100
God Damn Man.
And that's dolphins.

1696
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:08,250
Sweetest things ever smiling,
not always smiling when they're killing 

1697
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,170
babies.
Fucking,

1698
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,440
you know they,
they did.

1699
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:13,520
It doesn't mean it doesn't happen every 
day.

1700
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:15,320
It doesn't happen all over the dolphin 
world,

1701
01:26:15,321 --> 01:26:17,030
but it's been observed.
Hey Roger,

1702
01:26:17,031 --> 01:26:20,120
why are you smiling like that?
It's not like bears though bears.

1703
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:22,580
It's 100 percent like the males come 
out.

1704
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:26,660
It's Steven Rinella was explained this 
to me and he knows a lot about bears and

1705
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:31,661
when I was in that bear hunting camp,
they had seen a bear cub and then it was

1706
01:26:31,701 --> 01:26:36,701
eating it and then the mother came back 
and finished the cup off and finish an 

1707
01:26:36,701 --> 01:26:37,220
eight.
The rest of it,

1708
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:41,830
like it is such a fucking hard scrabble 
world that you cute.

1709
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:45,410
Can't even imagine the reality of being 
a bear.

1710
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,850
I got to on that note,
I got to go take a leak.

1711
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,930
I know it is.
It's fucked up.

1712
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:59,650
But being a fish fish don't even get the
fuck fish have the same problems.

1713
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,290
Other Fish Itam,
but they don't even get the fuck.

1714
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:07,700
In fact like there's certain fish where 
you buy lures that are the baby fish.

1715
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:10,340
There's like,
like you could buy like baby,

1716
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:15,680
a little rapala.
That's like a baby trout and fucking 

1717
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,190
triathlete it cons.

1718
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:19,300
Find out who that a musician was that 
you asked earlier.

1719
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:24,360
Was named Pat Reagan.
Who is Patty Reagan on twitter?

1720
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:26,920
Yeah.
That dude is fucking awesome.

1721
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:32,010
I don't want to say anymore.
I don't want to give anybody a give the 

1722
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:33,730
premise or give the uh,
the hilarity of a song,

1723
01:27:33,731 --> 01:27:37,450
but we were fucking clapping hard.
That was so good.

1724
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:39,850
Yeah.
It's really me and Tony had them on kill

1725
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:42,160
Tony.
It's really interesting because a lot of

1726
01:27:42,161 --> 01:27:45,250
musicians who are comics aren't really 
good musicians.

1727
01:27:45,251 --> 01:27:48,700
They just know how to play a little bit 
of guitar and after to make it work,

1728
01:27:48,701 --> 01:27:51,160
but he's actually a really good musician
on top of it.

1729
01:27:51,161 --> 01:27:51,910
Yeah,
no doubt.

1730
01:27:51,911 --> 01:27:54,640
Like he couldn't do like love songs and 
they'd be awesome.

1731
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,210
You know,
when not to me,

1732
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:01,840
it'd be asked me you,
you look a love song every now and then 

1733
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:01,840
it's right

1734
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,120
in the arms of the angels.
That's

1735
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:09,280
really rude that they do that.
What we were talking about earlier on 

1736
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,010
those fucking those humane society 
videos.

1737
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:11,900
That's.
That fucks with your head man.

1738
01:28:11,901 --> 01:28:13,300
Totally.
By the way,

1739
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:16,280
the new grand theft auto came out and 
saw you tweeting about it.

1740
01:28:16,281 --> 01:28:19,110
You fucking savage and there's pod and 
it now where if you take,

1741
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:22,910
if you take,
if you take a god thing,

1742
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:25,250
you turn into a chicken but don't play 
it.

1743
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,020
Well,
we could play it on this right here.

1744
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:27,670
Oh,
okay.

1745
01:28:27,671 --> 01:28:28,210
Okay.
Okay.

1746
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,670
So you take it.
You can play it like that.

1747
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:33,230
Yeah,
you could do that.

1748
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:37,730
Oh,
what I'm looking at that one.

1749
01:28:37,731 --> 01:28:39,560
Same thing.
Put it up that way.

1750
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:41,640
Let's take over that.
Anyways.

1751
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,900
It will.
You can white,

1752
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,640
but yeah,
you just turned.

1753
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,960
He just a pod and he just turned into a 
chicken

1754
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:50,650
on it.
That the pod.

1755
01:28:50,651 --> 01:28:55,651
Does it turn into a chicken though?
Why don't they just call it something 

1756
01:28:55,651 --> 01:28:55,651
different?
Oh Wow.

1757
01:28:55,651 --> 01:28:55,651
This is bad ass.

1758
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,010
Wait,
this is a video game.

1759
01:28:57,011 --> 01:28:58,340
We probably won't get pulled over a 
video game.

1760
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,060
You're not playing this are you?
Don't play this now.

1761
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,030
This is a video game.
Do

1762
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,260
you want to get credit for it?
I don't know that.

1763
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:08,220
Do you know that to Brian pulled that.
I thought you weren't playing.

1764
01:29:08,230 --> 01:29:10,940
I thought only we were watching it,
but it's not full screen and it's just a

1765
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,100
video we're getting pulled so many 
times.

1766
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:19,280
If you like,
somebody doesn't want you playing their 

1767
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,730
video on a another video because then 
you won't go to see their video.

1768
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:22,710
That's the idea behind it that you're 
taking hits from them.

1769
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:28,280
So like pretty much anytime you play a 
youtube video or any sort of nature of 

1770
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,460
video or any sort of video that anybody 
has a copyright on,

1771
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:32,670
you can get pulled.
This is one.

1772
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,910
I don't know what fair use.
Fair use is very fucking,

1773
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:37,890
you know,
like when you talk about fair use,

1774
01:29:37,891 --> 01:29:40,350
like you can play some things if you're 
doing commentary over them.

1775
01:29:40,351 --> 01:29:45,351
That's fair use or I don't know.
I don't understand it better to avoid 

1776
01:29:45,351 --> 01:29:45,730
it.
Yeah,

1777
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,250
man.
Anyway,

1778
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,900
whatever.
That looks awesome.

1779
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:50,790
I don't have time for that shit though,
Dude.

1780
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,330
I can't play grand theft auto.
Oh God.

1781
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:57,900
Fucking dragon age inquisition last 
night.

1782
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:02,160
Dude.
It feels like I'm on fire right now.

1783
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:03,150
Just knowing that.

1784
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:09,090
It's so good.
It's so cool.

1785
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:10,980
I was doing the UFC this weekend and 
they uh,

1786
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,890
had uh,
the ad for some new video game.

1787
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:16,330
I think it's called far cry.
Yeah.

1788
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,860
Far Christ far cry four or something 
like that.

1789
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:21,180
But they were playing like in game 
footage of it.

1790
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:21,690
Well,
I'll be like,

1791
01:30:21,691 --> 01:30:23,550
this is insane.
This is insane.

1792
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:26,550
I can't believe this is real.
It's amazing.

1793
01:30:26,551 --> 01:30:30,870
The kids get anything done.
It's a fucking amazing.

1794
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:36,180
Kids today get anything done because I 
had a hard time with quake one,

1795
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:41,780
you know,
think about the graphics in quake one 

1796
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:41,780
and think about what the fuck we're 
looking at today.

1797
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:45,210
He's this far cry game.
And these UFC games,

1798
01:30:45,211 --> 01:30:46,370
man,
sometimes I watched the,

1799
01:30:46,371 --> 01:30:51,371
like the preview.
Why when they step forward to start to 

1800
01:30:51,371 --> 01:30:52,800
fight and for a full second,
I don't realize it's a game.

1801
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,700
It's a game.
You know what I mean?

1802
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,930
Like I see them moving.
It takes,

1803
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,310
I have to recognize like,
wow,

1804
01:30:59,311 --> 01:31:00,610
this.
They look too perfect.

1805
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:03,390
It's too.
This is too uniform in color.

1806
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,940
There's some weird shit.
Oh there's a video game.

1807
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:11,240
But it takes like a full second before I
realized that I'm watching a Goddamn 

1808
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:11,240
game.
So this is it.

1809
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:12,040
Yeah.
This is it.

1810
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,680
So we're watching it and they can't see 
it.

1811
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:14,250
Right,
right.

1812
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:16,860
Okay.
And what if people want to Google this?

1813
01:31:16,861 --> 01:31:17,880
What is it?
Uh,

1814
01:31:17,881 --> 01:31:20,820
it's on [inaudible] dot com.
And it's.

1815
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:23,100
So he turns into a chicken.

1816
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:25,350
Oh yeah,
you just ate some pod.

1817
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:37,170
How do kids get anything done?
Tech pod.

1818
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,560
You can come a chicken

1819
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:44,100
or you pay attention to some stupid 
boring ass fucking homework could you,

1820
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:47,310
will hopefully never use in your life.
This is this,

1821
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:51,400
this is the real one that new for xbox 
one.

1822
01:31:51,401 --> 01:31:55,240
And ps four came out last night at 
midnight and they added a bunch of cats,

1823
01:31:55,870 --> 01:32:00,870
new drugs.
You could also turn into birds and go 

1824
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:00,870
fly around the city

1825
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:04,900
and poupon people when you do drugs.
But a lot of drug stuff and a cat stuff.

1826
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:07,000
That's pretty cool.
That's pretty bad ass,

1827
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:07,930
you know?
Uh.

1828
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:12,580
Did I show you the alien game I have on 
my dk two or the oculus rift?

1829
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:13,430
Alien.
Scared.

1830
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,730
I didn't want to try it.
Have you heard of that?

1831
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,490
I've heard it gives people fucking heart
attacks the alien.

1832
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:19,480
Yeah,
that's what I've heard.

1833
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:21,670
I've heard,
I've heard people say literally,

1834
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:27,010
I've got to stop saying literally.
I literally have to stop saying 

1835
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:29,521
literally have to stop saying fucking 
don't say stop for whatever reason it 

1836
01:32:29,521 --> 01:32:31,930
gets close to heart attack level with 
some people.

1837
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,540
There's people that are doing it that 
are worrying like,

1838
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:36,820
well this might actually cause a heart 
attack.

1839
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:42,340
Yeah.
Everybody used put it on my ass screen 

1840
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:46,860
when the fucking thing gets yet.
It's just the rudimentary technology.

1841
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:51,990
If you could feel it,
feel that tailed fucking piercing your 

1842
01:32:52,211 --> 01:32:54,490
neck or that.
Or if you have some sort of suit,

1843
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:59,760
you're wearing some suit and it likes,
puts pressure on you in the areas where 

1844
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,661
the thing's supposed to bite you.
Like when it comes out and grabs you 

1845
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:05,070
like you feel hands on your shoulders,
a cube.

1846
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,580
No.
How would a freak out?

1847
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,830
That would be if it.
When it gets you,

1848
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:12,670
it pops up and just grabs your shoulders
and you're wearing this suit.

1849
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:18,190
This suit is like finger press buttons 
on the shoulders and it pushes down on 

1850
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:20,680
you and you feel it as this thing is in 
front of you.

1851
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:26,730
It's fucking crazy.
Tongue comes out right before it brains 

1852
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:26,730
you.
You feel the hands on your shoulders.

1853
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:31,530
I bet this suit comes with like a 
special place where you could hang your 

1854
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:31,530
diaper inside.

1855
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:35,850
Kids this naturally evacuate their vows.
They probably warn you to give yourself 

1856
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,750
an enema before you play with it.
Yeah,

1857
01:33:37,751 --> 01:33:42,751
you will shit yourself.
You're going to shoot yourself percent 

1858
01:33:42,751 --> 01:33:42,980
chance.
You'll shoot yourself just probably like

1859
01:33:42,981 --> 01:33:45,070
a,
like a thick wet suit,

1860
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:50,310
like an armor plated wetsuit and you zip
it all the way up to the top and 

1861
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:50,530
everything that happens.
You in the game,

1862
01:33:50,531 --> 01:33:52,120
you feel it in your body.
Man.

1863
01:33:52,121 --> 01:33:57,121
I'm looking forward to the new people 
have been speculating about having these

1864
01:33:59,081 --> 01:34:04,081
vr goggles on airplanes so that when you
put them on you can see the outside of 

1865
01:34:04,571 --> 01:34:06,760
the plane.
Like it's the inside of the plane,

1866
01:34:06,761 --> 01:34:07,990
you know?
Yeah.

1867
01:34:07,991 --> 01:34:12,991
And also they're talking about using a 
kind of projector technology and planes 

1868
01:34:12,991 --> 01:34:15,340
that projects the outside of the school.
I've seen that.

1869
01:34:15,341 --> 01:34:20,341
I saw the images of that.
They don't have a working plane right 

1870
01:34:20,341 --> 01:34:20,341
now.

1871
01:34:20,341 --> 01:34:20,840
Right.
It just makes sense.

1872
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:23,680
It's actually,
I mean I'm going to say this is a stupid

1873
01:34:23,681 --> 01:34:27,490
thing for me to say because like the 
most technologically advanced thing that

1874
01:34:27,491 --> 01:34:32,491
I've done recently is figured out that I
could put marijuana drops into my 

1875
01:34:32,491 --> 01:34:35,050
smoothies.
I realized that like I am always like,

1876
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,700
you know,
railing against people,

1877
01:34:36,701 --> 01:34:39,700
but I'm not doing.
I'm playing dragon age and like drinking

1878
01:34:39,701 --> 01:34:42,610
marijuana smoothies.
But that being said,

1879
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:47,850
it seems easy to project outside of a 
plane onto the inside of a plane based 

1880
01:34:48,491 --> 01:34:50,770
on what you could even buy it.
Like Brookstone,

1881
01:34:50,771 --> 01:34:55,270
they have those projectors heavy sell 
fun.

1882
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:56,320
Yeah,
that's what it looks like.

1883
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:57,980
We're looking at a picture of it right 
now and

1884
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,980
it's the inside of the plane,
the roof and the two sides are all like 

1885
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:06,110
a giant screen.
And so it looks like totally seamless.

1886
01:35:06,111 --> 01:35:11,111
Like you could see the sky and they have
cameras apparently on the top of these 

1887
01:35:11,111 --> 01:35:14,861
things.
That project everything that's actually 

1888
01:35:14,861 --> 01:35:14,861
out there.
So if a plane was beside you,

1889
01:35:14,861 --> 01:35:16,070
you would be able to see the plane in 
hd,

1890
01:35:16,330 --> 01:35:17,330
you know,
if you know,

1891
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,970
that would be the best way to fuck with 
people.

1892
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:24,050
You hijack that thing and you like if 
you got hackers onboard,

1893
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:29,051
they hacked that fucking thing.
And they show Ufo is everywhere and 

1894
01:35:29,051 --> 01:35:29,840
everybody starts freaking out.
Like,

1895
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:31,500
oh my God,
there's 20 flights.

1896
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:35,260
Are you not seeing this is fucking 
playing now.

1897
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:37,910
Oh my God.
You don't see him.

1898
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:41,480
And everybody's freaking out.
Two hundred people are screaming.

1899
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:44,750
Land the plane at dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs.

1900
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:47,320
Yeah,
man,

1901
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:49,490
she wrecks or uh,
you know,

1902
01:35:49,491 --> 01:35:51,910
it doesn't have to be,
it doesn't have to be the act,

1903
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:53,630
the,
what you're flying through either.

1904
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:57,760
It could be like an ace space project 
space out there.

1905
01:35:57,850 --> 01:36:00,080
You feel like you're flying through 
space and the plane,

1906
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:02,120
right?
You could have like an Avatar plane.

1907
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:04,730
We're flying through like the Avatar 
dimension.

1908
01:36:04,731 --> 01:36:07,460
You've seen the fucking dragons around 
you as you're flying.

1909
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:12,660
H Like James Cameron can have his own 
airlines and you can have the full 

1910
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:16,541
avatar flight experience.
You imagine how fucking cool that would 

1911
01:36:16,541 --> 01:36:16,541
be.
So cool.

1912
01:36:16,541 --> 01:36:21,101
It's like a ride all the way to like New
York is five and a half hours of Avatar.

1913
01:36:21,501 --> 01:36:24,410
Monsters flying around the plane.
So bad ass.

1914
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:26,450
So bad.
I looked down.

1915
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:28,830
You'd see the forest everywhere you 
looked down it's program.

1916
01:36:28,831 --> 01:36:31,190
Do you see like those Navi running 
around,

1917
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:33,620
jumping,
swinging from ropes and shit,

1918
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:36,140
shooting arrows at a game component?
Man,

1919
01:36:36,141 --> 01:36:41,141
you could treat.
You could be shooting them with machine 

1920
01:36:41,141 --> 01:36:43,070
guns or lazy or you're in the world 
immersed in the world.

1921
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:48,070
Everybody in every seat has their own 
avatar and they're flying through this 

1922
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:49,040
sky and you just look up and you know 
where you are.

1923
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,460
It's just an infinite screen above you.
Fuck a roof.

1924
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,770
Fuck a roof.
Now the whole thing's a screen.

1925
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:58,190
Why do you only have screens here and 
here and a little bit here?

1926
01:36:58,210 --> 01:36:59,480
No,
the whole thing's a screen.

1927
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:00,670
Well,
because you know that.

1928
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:03,410
And what do they call it?
The people who make you put your phone,

1929
01:37:03,411 --> 01:37:04,460
someone's gonna.
Ruin it.

1930
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,310
Like guaranteed.
Like one of the safety people be like,

1931
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:09,680
there's no way we're projecting shit on 
that thing.

1932
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,720
These are fart tubes that make people 
want to kill themselves.

1933
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:15,440
You know,
it would happen.

1934
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:19,160
Someone would tap into it and we'd be 
five hours gay porn,

1935
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:24,400
five hours from La to New York.
Like everywhere.

1936
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,280
Everybody looks like,
Oh yes,

1937
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,040
sailor,
don't,

1938
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:28,270
don't,
don't bother.

1939
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:32,330
Just dicks and mouths and fucking hairy 
dudes covered in.

1940
01:37:32,331 --> 01:37:35,600
Come and just dudes with those.
Those ear holes,

1941
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:36,710
nose,
ear holes.

1942
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:39,890
Guys get those big plugs in their ear,
all stretched out,

1943
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:44,980
feet up in the air.
Hairy legs getting buttfuck put another 

1944
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:47,891
dude and that's all you see for five 
hours or even worse and calm and decks 

1945
01:37:48,281 --> 01:37:51,740
and calm or even worse.
The Big Bang theory,

1946
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:55,110
they just show the Big Bang theory the 
whole time.

1947
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:56,050
Did you

1948
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:56,220
see

1949
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,450
he actually made a commercial where 
they,

1950
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:03,640
they pranked a bunch of people with this
like realistic window in the background 

1951
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,150
and then they had like,
just like a meteor.

1952
01:38:05,151 --> 01:38:06,040
Right?
Coming from the.

1953
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:08,630
Oh that's awesome.
So can we play that?

1954
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:09,000
Yeah,
it's.

1955
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:14,060
I mean it was a commercial.
So fucking cool.

1956
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:17,330
Yeah,
that's bad.

1957
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,330
That's wild.
Wow.

1958
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,920
Oh my God.
Whoa.

1959
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:23,810
And they had.
Yeah,

1960
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,950
they had the lights turned off the 
lights and shit.

1961
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,730
My pants.
So cool.

1962
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,290
When did that happen?

1963
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:32,160
I think it was like a year and a half 
ago,

1964
01:38:32,161 --> 01:38:37,161
but lg ended up pulling it because it 
got so much bad attention from it.

1965
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:37,650
Well,
didn't.

1966
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:40,800
He will have to sign releases,
bitch.

1967
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,110
Look,
it's an lg TV.

1968
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:46,260
Fuck you man.
The lucky nobody hit anybody.

1969
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:50,020
I want one of those.
Got Mad.

1970
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:51,870
He got mad for real.
I bet he did.

1971
01:38:51,871 --> 01:38:53,190
Yeah.
Today they gave him a check.

1972
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,140
Yeah.
And then you gotta sign a release,

1973
01:38:55,141 --> 01:38:55,730
right?
Yep.

1974
01:38:56,610 --> 01:38:58,140
Wow.
Ah,

1975
01:38:58,141 --> 01:38:59,070
yeah.
It's so cool,

1976
01:38:59,071 --> 01:39:01,280
man.
How that's what we're talking about.

1977
01:39:01,281 --> 01:39:04,860
That's exactly what we're talking about.
We're talking about how the universe,

1978
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:10,160
our subjective experience of the 
universe is about to shift so radically 

1979
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,550
and so many different ways.
Because if,

1980
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:16,820
what's that new google thing,
they're being so secretive about the 

1981
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:16,820
thing where you can see an elephant your
hand.

1982
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:17,580
They're not talking about,
you know,

1983
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:19,680
Google Hologram.
Look it up.

1984
01:39:19,681 --> 01:39:24,681
It's called.
I keep forgetting it's called magic 

1985
01:39:24,681 --> 01:39:24,681
something or uh,
but it's,

1986
01:39:24,730 --> 01:39:29,730
it's basically like some,
it's an augmented reality that creates 

1987
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:30,240
a.

1988
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,400
apparently they're being so secretive 
about it.

1989
01:39:32,401 --> 01:39:35,220
People can only speculate based on the 
patents that they've taken out.

1990
01:39:35,221 --> 01:39:37,620
And I think there's a few images that 
might been released,

1991
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:43,100
but uh,
it's some form of augmented reality 

1992
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:46,430
where,
I don't know if it's coming off of your 

1993
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:48,981
phone.
I don't know if it's coming off of a 

1994
01:39:48,981 --> 01:39:48,981
projector.
What it's coming.

1995
01:39:48,981 --> 01:39:48,981
Yeah.
Magic leap.

1996
01:39:48,981 --> 01:39:52,440
Look at that raised half a bill that see
the elephant your hand.

1997
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:55,530
Yeah.
It's in the middle to see holograms,

1998
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:59,280
lifelike looking holograms in real time.
Yes,

1999
01:39:59,281 --> 01:40:01,290
and I've heard,
I've heard,

2000
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:06,320
I know someone who supposedly saw it and
they just said it was the most 

2001
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:06,810
incredible thing they'd ever seen in 
their life and the people who've seen it

2002
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:07,920
are all like,
no,

2003
01:40:07,921 --> 01:40:09,420
you don't understand.
Oh my God,

2004
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:14,460
this is a game changer.
You're going to watch people fuck in 

2005
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:14,460
your house.

2006
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:16,860
That's what it's going to be on your,
on your bed.

2007
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:18,660
You're going to be watching like a 
little mini people.

2008
01:40:18,661 --> 01:40:23,661
Fuck like you're the king.
You're like Gulliver's travels like 

2009
01:40:23,661 --> 01:40:25,770
landed on some beach and it's filled 
with hot people in the fucking,

2010
01:40:25,771 --> 01:40:28,140
but they're only like three inches tall.
Crazy.

2011
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:33,770
It's crazy.
You're going to be able to jerk off and 

2012
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:34,410
have your own head projected onto the 
top of your cock.

2013
01:40:34,411 --> 01:40:38,640
So when you come you like vomit is the 
dream.

2014
01:40:38,850 --> 01:40:41,670
Do you think they'll get it to a point 
where when you come on the characters,

2015
01:40:41,671 --> 01:40:43,140
the characters who recommended you come 
down on them?

2016
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:45,990
Yes,
I would.

2017
01:40:45,991 --> 01:40:48,630
I'd progress.
I programmed that into the game.

2018
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:50,850
Like how?
Because you know the new game,

2019
01:40:50,851 --> 01:40:53,550
if you play it,
you don't play games too scared.

2020
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:54,020
There's

2021
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:59,030
a game shadows of Mordor,
which is this super fun game that has a 

2022
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:02,320
thing called the nemesis system,
which is that if a look at this,

2023
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:04,210
wow,
oh my god,

2024
01:41:04,211 --> 01:41:06,300
it leaves shadows.
It's a little elephant.

2025
01:41:06,301 --> 01:41:10,210
That law that flies around your hand.
A million dollars just for that.

2026
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:13,720
What is this though that we're seeing?
Is this a real demonstration of it or is

2027
01:41:13,721 --> 01:41:16,660
this an artistic representation?
It's the website.

2028
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:18,760
It's just a website,
but that's what it does,

2029
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:20,410
but I think that that.
Look,

2030
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:23,380
it's time to bring magic back into the 
world.

2031
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:28,700
God,
technology can be awesome sometimes the 

2032
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:28,700
best thing.
Mind bogglingly,

2033
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:33,661
awesome.
Sometimes the best thing in life come 

2034
01:41:33,661 --> 01:41:35,701
from the most unexpected places.
Most of us know what a world with 

2035
01:41:35,701 --> 01:41:38,200
dragons and Unicorns and elves and 
fairies is just a better world.

2036
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:43,230
That is why we're summoning the 
antichrist to reign forever on this 

2037
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:43,230
planning window.

2038
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:46,410
Back up to what they actually said 
though what,

2039
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:49,570
but right before the most.
Just go ahead.

2040
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:52,030
Most of us know that a world with 
dragons and Unicorns,

2041
01:41:52,031 --> 01:41:54,100
elves and fairies.
It's just a better world.

2042
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:57,990
That's so it's a crazy thing to say.
This is why we are using black magic.

2043
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:03,750
Demons ended this dementia.
What would happen if we use technology 

2044
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:06,700
to bring magic back into the world,
like they're showing a kid,

2045
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:11,760
have a couple of kids sitting around a 
table in class and it looks like the 

2046
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:12,940
number of horses are flying around in 
space above them and they're not wearing

2047
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:15,700
glasses or anything.
So this must be some kind of like.

2048
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:20,050
It's a projection technology some,
but I mean where's it coming out of?

2049
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:25,051
This is what's weird mean.
I want to know if these are real images 

2050
01:42:25,051 --> 01:42:25,051
we're seeing.
They're fucking with us.

2051
01:42:25,051 --> 01:42:27,720
This is just like,
these are just photoshop match and dude,

2052
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:31,920
ballerinas dancing on a little girl's 
bed watching it.

2053
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:37,010
Ballerinas go back up to that.
Look at that.

2054
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:38,650
Yeah.
That's cool.

2055
01:42:38,651 --> 01:42:41,770
A little girl's face.
Could you imagine watching a little tiny

2056
01:42:41,771 --> 01:42:46,700
man dance with swords in front of you?
Doing some crazy ancient Ali Baba?

2057
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:48,190
Oppression.
Dance.

2058
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,830
So cool.
He's like four inches tall.

2059
01:42:51,430 --> 01:42:55,080
It would be cool if they could give them
a touch of some kind at least like,

2060
01:42:55,090 --> 01:43:00,090
like if it's in your hand,
you could kind of feel it using maybe 

2061
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:02,950
moisture or something.
Haptic technology by using air blasts.

2062
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:05,120
You can simulate stuff,
but yeah,

2063
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:05,770
that's.
Yeah,

2064
01:43:05,771 --> 01:43:10,771
but you have to have a fan to do that.
I think it's going to get to a point 

2065
01:43:10,771 --> 01:43:13,621
where they can actually like put 
something in your mind that makes you 

2066
01:43:13,621 --> 01:43:14,920
respond to the program so you feel 
sensory input.

2067
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:17,070
That doesn't really exist.
Yeah.

2068
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:19,360
That way you can know what it looks like
to get attacked by wolves.

2069
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:24,160
Wizards or hiring wizard.
He put on this,

2070
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:29,220
you put on the suit and you.
You have a virtual reality scenario 

2071
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:33,121
where you were attacked by wolves and 
you can literally feel them tearing you 

2072
01:43:33,121 --> 01:43:33,121
apart when you take off the suit and 
you're fine.

2073
01:43:33,121 --> 01:43:35,590
How about a feeling to take a nap inside
of the Jina?

2074
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:42,030
What if you take a nap inside a vagina,
but then she enjoys it and she clamps 

2075
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:42,030
down.
You can't breathe and you have no way of

2076
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:45,520
telling her that she's crushing you.
Like she's really enjoying it,

2077
01:43:45,521 --> 01:43:47,210
so she keegan's you and they're like,
oh,

2078
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:55,870
she's.
Are you sure that when you get in there 

2079
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:55,870
you're not gonna.
You're gonna.

2080
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:56,260
Be Safe.
Oh baby.

2081
01:43:56,261 --> 01:44:00,230
Your Vagina.
So soft and amazing and welcoming.

2082
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:02,210
When I get in there,
it's going to be like magic.

2083
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:03,680
I want to just.
Okay.

2084
01:44:03,681 --> 01:44:04,910
You'll let me know.
Okay.

2085
01:44:04,911 --> 01:44:07,730
Just put your legs in first.
We don't have a problem.

2086
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,930
We have no problem.
Trust me,

2087
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:09,890
I'm in.
I'm in.

2088
01:44:09,891 --> 01:44:11,240
I'm good.
I'm going to go all the way in,

2089
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:12,640
so I love you honey.
I'm gonna.

2090
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:17,660
Try to make you come under climate side 
of her pussy and it feels too good and 

2091
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:17,660
she just.

2092
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:24,590
The last thing you see is what appears 
to be a skeletal hand because she's done

2093
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:28,790
this many times before and it looks like
a hippo,

2094
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:31,850
a hippo mouth closing down on you.
That's what it's like.

2095
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:36,740
She slammed just a wall of the roof of 
her mouth,

2096
01:44:36,741 --> 01:44:41,741
like a giant meat press coming down on 
your body that is fucked.

2097
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:48,890
The mouth of the vagina just closes down
like choking on saline,

2098
01:44:48,891 --> 01:44:52,340
on all the fluids in there.
You're just sort of like in this mucusy,

2099
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:56,870
all those baby pushing muscles just 
smush your bones.

2100
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:02,320
You feel that the pressure of her Posey 
just ripping your shoulders off their 

2101
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,520
sockets.
Why does it have to kill you?

2102
01:45:04,521 --> 01:45:09,521
Maybe at like sucks you through a tunnel
and shoots you into a surprise party 

2103
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:14,530
because I think women have been getting 
the short end of the stick for too long 

2104
01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:14,570
and it's about time to start killing us 
with their pussies.

2105
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,280
I'm just trying to look at it from their
point of view.

2106
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:25,670
Black widow style,
you know,

2107
01:45:25,671 --> 01:45:30,671
it is weird.
What you just described was birth and 

2108
01:45:30,671 --> 01:45:30,671
reverse.
Yeah.

2109
01:45:30,671 --> 01:45:35,080
Maybe you maybe maybe the stuff they say
about how we all experience trauma from 

2110
01:45:35,691 --> 01:45:40,691
being squeezed out of a pussy when we're
babies and don't have any muscles at all

2111
01:45:40,791 --> 01:45:45,420
and can't do anything.
It's still residual trauma inside of us.

2112
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:50,460
A lot of people say that's like one of 
the root problems are their roots of a 

2113
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:54,941
lot of bad trips is that we still 
haven't gotten over that suffocating 

2114
01:45:54,941 --> 01:45:58,631
moment of falling out of a floating ball
of water where we had all the food we 

2115
01:45:58,641 --> 01:46:02,090
wanted and then squeeze through a tunnel
that was so strong.

2116
01:46:02,091 --> 01:46:07,091
It matches our head out of shape that 
that's a trauma and it's still encoded 

2117
01:46:07,551 --> 01:46:10,820
inside of people.
It's very possible you're a baby,

2118
01:46:10,821 --> 01:46:11,840
but you don't.

2119
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:14,090
You don't have a language,
but you're a human being.

2120
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,760
You don't have a big brain.
You have a little tiny ass brain,

2121
01:46:16,990 --> 01:46:18,710
but the brain is still taking in 
signals.

2122
01:46:18,711 --> 01:46:23,711
You still know where your mom is.
You still feel good and getting the 

2123
01:46:23,711 --> 01:46:23,790
nipple in your mouth like you're getting
a little tiny baby.

2124
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:29,050
There's a lot of information that's 
going in and we just assume they forget 

2125
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:33,340
all the fucked up shit like the being 
born into the world and the cold hands 

2126
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:37,571
of a doctor as he picks you up and it's 
fucking going to light on his head and 

2127
01:46:37,571 --> 01:46:40,340
just this big giant like a green alien.
He's wearing the oxygen mask.

2128
01:46:40,341 --> 01:46:42,830
This is what the alien abductions are.
Some people say,

2129
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:44,840
no,
it wasn't a big fad.

2130
01:46:44,841 --> 01:46:49,841
Rebirthing ceremonies or something like 
you would get if you would there or do 

2131
01:46:49,841 --> 01:46:54,540
something where you get to be born a,
you'd get another chance to overcome the

2132
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:59,490
ptsd that comes from being squeezed out 
of a pussy into this dimension.

2133
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,620
I don't know,
man.

2134
01:47:01,621 --> 01:47:03,150
I don't know.
It's interesting.

2135
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:05,400
I don't know if it gets stuck in your 
head,

2136
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:08,410
but I don't know either could,
but it.

2137
01:47:08,411 --> 01:47:11,740
It seems like a very likely scenario.
I mean the.

2138
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:17,020
The brain's functional and it's the most
traumatic experience ever and you don't 

2139
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:18,530
have any context.
Do you?

2140
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:23,540
Don't have any language.
You don't have any knowledge of why 

2141
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:26,781
you're there.
No one's explained what's going to 

2142
01:47:26,781 --> 01:47:26,781
happen.
All of a sudden you're born.

2143
01:47:26,781 --> 01:47:30,920
That's got to be unbelievably traumatic.
You've been hearing this on top of that.

2144
01:47:32,371 --> 01:47:37,371
Add circumcision.
How about the slice your fucking Dick 

2145
01:47:37,441 --> 01:47:39,720
with a razor?
Welcome home.

2146
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:42,810
What?
You cut his dick.

2147
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,220
Wyatt,
welcome to Earth.

2148
01:47:44,221 --> 01:47:46,770
We're just going to keep it clean.
What about soap?

2149
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:52,050
I didn't really ever.
Everybody we're talking about soap to 

2150
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:56,690
cut his fucking kids.
Screamings Dick's on fire.

2151
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:00,390
Screaming.
Just came out of Postdoc Dixon actually.

2152
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:01,860
How long do they wait for the 
circumcised?

2153
01:48:01,861 --> 01:48:06,861
They probably don't do it right away,
but they definitely stick you with 

2154
01:48:06,861 --> 01:48:06,990
needles right away.
They vaccinate you like instantly got.

2155
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:12,050
We're worried about the GDS fucking 
shove needles right into that baby's 

2156
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:12,450
body.
Started pumping chemicals.

2157
01:48:12,451 --> 01:48:16,620
Which you ever do a homebirth fuck no.
What am I living in a cave?

2158
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,750
What am I on?
A fucking farm somewhere.

2159
01:48:18,751 --> 01:48:23,751
And uh,
clinics would movie about the 18 

2160
01:48:23,751 --> 01:48:23,751
hundreds.
The Fuck Outta here.

2161
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:26,490
Fuck it sally.
I don't think she's going to make it.

2162
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:31,830
Try your hardest to get a water.
Bucket Rosary.

2163
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,040
Every Western birth movie.
It's like they act.

2164
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:37,300
If you get the water bucket there in 
time to baby,

2165
01:48:37,301 --> 01:48:40,500
he'll survive.
Fixed me a bucket of water.

2166
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:42,690
Yeah.
I kinda bought a bucket of water,

2167
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:46,060
some cloths and clean cloth and water.
What is that?

2168
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:47,250
What is the bucket of water?

2169
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:48,930
Digit like?
A baby's turned around.

2170
01:48:48,931 --> 01:48:53,931
I'm going to go in there and he goes in.
And what is farmer hands and ruins your 

2171
01:48:53,931 --> 01:48:56,871
wife's pussy shoves his gigantic gorilla
like farmer hands into that pussy and 

2172
01:48:57,871 --> 01:49:02,871
spins it around.
He's the only guy knows how to do it 

2173
01:49:02,871 --> 01:49:03,240
because he's done it with calves.
We got a breach cab.

2174
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:05,420
Alrighty.
Rolls his sleeves up to his elbow.

2175
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:10,450
Just fucking lubes the whole thing.
Just launches it in there and spins 

2176
01:49:10,450 --> 01:49:14,841
around your kid fingernails.
Just think what was good fucking 

2177
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:19,320
country.
Just fucking go for shit.

2178
01:49:19,470 --> 01:49:22,660
Monkey bullshit.
White disaster.

2179
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:27,680
This fingernail probably better invent 
the toilet paper yet it just took a 

2180
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,480
giant farmer Dr.
Crap.

2181
01:49:30,481 --> 01:49:32,660
And your in your.
In your outhouse.

2182
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:34,710
And he's gonna reaching into your 
wife's.

2183
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:40,140
Got a half strangle.
The macy aided mountaineering baby.

2184
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:42,240
And then he's going to smack it to make 
it cry.

2185
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:44,040
Yeah,
I'm the poor thing.

2186
01:49:44,041 --> 01:49:46,860
It's just like what happened?
What happened?

2187
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:53,040
Why did I do is like the ultimate 
argument one day for a new type of 

2188
01:49:53,411 --> 01:49:55,330
birth.
What if they figure out what if they go,

2189
01:49:55,600 --> 01:50:00,600
look,
we've found something out about the 

2190
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,090
human psyche and although we were all 
created a certain way and we can't avoid

2191
01:50:01,091 --> 01:50:01,980
it,
we founded,

2192
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:07,020
there's considerable trauma in a less 
likely chance of enlightenment when you 

2193
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:10,741
come out through a pussy and that really
the best way to do it is we we do it 

2194
01:50:11,591 --> 01:50:16,591
nice and slow and we're going to send 
you information to your baby in a form 

2195
01:50:18,070 --> 01:50:23,070
of like a Nano Bot that delivers video 
and it's going to get your baby used to 

2196
01:50:23,111 --> 01:50:25,780
how it's going to be born,
and it's going to slowly be.

2197
01:50:25,781 --> 01:50:30,781
There's gonna be an opening in the top 
of the roof and then some loving hands 

2198
01:50:30,781 --> 01:50:33,070
are going to come in.
I'm going to take you to your mother who

2199
01:50:33,071 --> 01:50:36,520
will then be stitched up until they 
figured out one day they're gonna.

2200
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:38,920
Figure out how to dissolve skin and then
reapply it,

2201
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:40,120
right?
Yeah.

2202
01:50:40,230 --> 01:50:45,230
Not going to be stitches.
It's Kinda teleports out a beam of 

2203
01:50:45,230 --> 01:50:47,170
light.
Beautiful music on a nice soft pillow,

2204
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,810
vanilla scented candles.
How Nice.

2205
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:54,220
Like calming Indian music.
No,

2206
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:56,200
no,
no singing,

2207
01:50:56,290 --> 01:50:59,090
fucking kids not ready for that kid.
Just like the tire,

2208
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:02,710
something sweet,
something like not aggressive at all,

2209
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:07,800
and then they cut off the tip of it's 
because they got a nice and calm 

2210
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:14,130
dunking.
You're never going to get it if you 

2211
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:14,550
don't get it now,
get it now.

2212
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:16,510
Get it.
Now imagine if they did that though,

2213
01:51:16,511 --> 01:51:21,511
if they brought the kid into the world 
and this like feeling of soothing 

2214
01:51:21,511 --> 01:51:23,260
enlightenment,
which is a minor dose of Mbma,

2215
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:28,030
just the tiniest dose of mdms while in 
the womb so that as the kids being born,

2216
01:51:28,031 --> 01:51:30,370
it has no inhibitions.
Kids being mean,

2217
01:51:30,371 --> 01:51:31,500
they have a little tiny bodies.

2218
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,910
It could be like it's a fucking like a 
pin head of Indian men,

2219
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:39,270
but they find out that not only is Mtma 
when given to babies in the womb make 

2220
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:42,850
for a better birth for everybody,
but they all become super geniuses.

2221
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:48,040
All those babies become the kindness.
Most likely have no emotional problems.

2222
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:51,190
They have zero issues.
It's a jumpstart to enlightenment.

2223
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:56,430
Just give your baby a little extra seat.
Just so love that shit probably already 

2224
01:51:56,430 --> 01:51:56,430
tripping now.
Really?

2225
01:51:56,430 --> 01:51:56,440
Yeah,
I think you're,

2226
01:51:56,441 --> 01:51:59,590
I think babies are probably tripping.
What the tripping on though.

2227
01:51:59,591 --> 01:52:00,840
They're definitely not tripping on MDI.

2228
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:03,350
No form that this is study.
They,

2229
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:04,180
they,
uh,

2230
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:09,190
don't know.
They're separate from their mother at 

2231
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:10,991
first.
They don't understand that there's a 

2232
01:52:10,991 --> 01:52:10,991
separation.
They don't.

2233
01:52:10,991 --> 01:52:14,060
The whole idea of separation is 
something that comes later down the 

2234
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:17,261
line.
The idea that this is me in that to you 

2235
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:19,010
is something that comes later down the 
line and that,

2236
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:20,030
I mean,
God,

2237
01:52:20,031 --> 01:52:23,270
if you've ever taken a,
a nice dose of Lsd,

2238
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:27,170
the moment that goes away,
that separation goes away.

2239
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:29,120
If you've ever had that on a 
psychedelic,

2240
01:52:29,121 --> 01:52:31,040
that's surprising moment where you're 
like,

2241
01:52:31,041 --> 01:52:33,620
Holy Shit,
I'm everything.

2242
01:52:33,621 --> 01:52:37,490
You just merge pure.
They caught expansiveness.

2243
01:52:37,491 --> 01:52:40,400
The clear mind that is the most 
ultimate,

2244
01:52:40,730 --> 01:52:43,400
that is as great as it can get.
That's pure freedom.

2245
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:46,040
It's a pretty intense,
that's for sure.

2246
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:49,670
And it's experience that probably 80 
percent of the people never have,

2247
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:52,490
right?
At least probably more.

2248
01:52:52,610 --> 01:52:54,380
Probably more than 80.
Yeah.

2249
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:56,720
That's one of the real problems with the
world.

2250
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:00,770
One of the real problems of the world is
even like super intelligent people.

2251
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:03,800
I read a lot of different people's stuff
online,

2252
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:07,010
people that I don't agree with at all.
Super left people,

2253
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:12,011
super right people.
I read a lot of people's stuff and one 

2254
01:53:12,011 --> 01:53:15,791
of the things that I.
I'm always shocked at how angry and 

2255
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:19,601
Shitty a lot of really smart people can 
be about fairly controversial or 

2256
01:53:19,601 --> 01:53:24,341
debatable issues,
but they can be really angry and shitty 

2257
01:53:24,341 --> 01:53:26,660
and insulting and I know they're smart 
so I'm reading this and I'm like,

2258
01:53:26,661 --> 01:53:29,750
this just screams a lack of psychedelic 
perspective.

2259
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:35,060
They're like,
not everybody has a psychedelic 

2260
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:35,060
perspective.
Twenty four slash seven,

2261
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:36,680
but usually even if you have like a 
moment when you were in your car,

2262
01:53:36,681 --> 01:53:38,810
like we were joking about that the last 
time you were driving,

2263
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,000
the last time we were driving together,
you were driving and you like this 

2264
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:44,060
fucking asshole.

2265
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:46,620
Get the fuck out of my way.
And then you started laughing.

2266
01:53:46,621 --> 01:53:48,290
You're like,
listen to me man.

2267
01:53:48,291 --> 01:53:50,470
I'm always talking about peace and 
enlightenment.

2268
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:53,570
Telling US old lane a buick to go fuck 
herself.

2269
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:56,840
But we were joking and laughing around 
while we were doing it,

2270
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:58,100
but it's still.
Look,

2271
01:53:58,101 --> 01:53:59,840
man,
I mean that's just natural.

2272
01:53:59,841 --> 01:54:04,841
I mean it still comes out.
I was able to catch it with you and 

2273
01:54:04,841 --> 01:54:06,230
that's what mindfulness is the training 
so you can catch it.

2274
01:54:06,231 --> 01:54:08,390
At least we're after it happens.
You gotta go there.

2275
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:13,010
I it fucking pattern again,
but I know what you.

2276
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:14,970
I know what you mean man.
It's a.

2277
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:20,050
Some people haven't quite realized yet 
that they don't have to be like that and

2278
01:54:20,151 --> 01:54:25,151
I know I've,
I've seen these fucking twitter fights 

2279
01:54:25,151 --> 01:54:28,030
between people that are supposedly super
intelligent and somehow they devolve 

2280
01:54:28,030 --> 01:54:29,990
into like 10th graders.
Incredible.

2281
01:54:29,991 --> 01:54:32,330
Right?
It's incredibly embarrassing.

2282
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:34,950
Well,
it's a social retardation is what it is.

2283
01:54:34,951 --> 01:54:36,930
It's part of it.
And by social retardation,

2284
01:54:36,931 --> 01:54:41,931
I mean the most advanced social 
interaction that I ever get out of my 

2285
01:54:42,421 --> 01:54:45,630
life is when I get high with my friends,
whether I get high with them,

2286
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:48,810
whether it's mushrooms or.
I mean there's regular,

2287
01:54:48,811 --> 01:54:53,811
there's all sorts of wonderful deep 
interaction you could have sober or not 

2288
01:54:53,811 --> 01:54:55,590
sober,
but when you trip with somebody,

2289
01:54:55,800 --> 01:55:00,750
there's some intense bond of humanity 
that happens when you trip with them,

2290
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:03,540
but when it's over and you're laughing 
and it's like,

2291
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:08,800
oh boy,
like the social bond that's constructed 

2292
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:11,520
through those moments is pretty fucking 
remarkable man.

2293
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:15,900
And if you never experienced that,
I kind of feel bad.

2294
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:19,560
I kind of feel bad because we all go 
through great moments in life.

2295
01:55:19,561 --> 01:55:24,561
It's not like a defining thing where you
have to have it or you won't be 

2296
01:55:24,561 --> 01:55:26,370
complete,
but it is some next level shit.

2297
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:29,160
Yeah.
It really truly is some next level shit.

2298
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:32,910
And it's some shit that a good 80 
percent of the people are just not going

2299
01:55:32,911 --> 01:55:33,270
to experience.

2300
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:38,580
I like to think that a hundred percent 
that people experience it because I 

2301
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:41,881
think it's what happens when you die.
And I like to believe that that death 

2302
01:55:41,881 --> 01:55:44,190
experience is one of complete merging 
and uh,

2303
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:48,150
that like wow,
the steve jobs.

2304
01:55:48,151 --> 01:55:49,520
Like,
wow,

2305
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:50,760
you know,
who I'd love to get.

2306
01:55:50,770 --> 01:55:55,170
Hi Richard Dawkins.
That's everyone's dream,

2307
01:55:55,171 --> 01:55:55,470
man.

2308
01:55:55,530 --> 01:56:00,530
That guy is so fucking smart,
but so hostile with so little time left,

2309
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:02,550
he's pissed.
He was always.

2310
01:56:02,970 --> 01:56:07,970
He was getting mad at these women who 
were mad at the scientist for wearing 

2311
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:12,340
the shirt with the sexy ladies on it and
you know,

2312
01:56:12,410 --> 01:56:15,030
he was like saying like,
that's not real feminism.

2313
01:56:15,031 --> 01:56:20,031
The real feminists aren't.
Wouldn't be mad at some ridiculous 

2314
01:56:20,031 --> 01:56:20,031
shirt.

2315
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:21,560
Isn't that funny though,
Joe?

2316
01:56:21,561 --> 01:56:26,561
That thing like here we have one of the 
great moments in human history and as 

2317
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:33,070
part of a byproduct of landing a probe 
on a goddamn comment and already they're

2318
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:39,950
reporting that they found organic matter
on this comment indicating that the 

2319
01:56:41,481 --> 01:56:46,481
entire universe is being pollinated by 
these drifting mountains that have 

2320
01:56:46,481 --> 01:56:50,000
within them precursors to life as part 
of a byproduct.

2321
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:55,360
One of the people who,
one of the magicians as far as I'm 

2322
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,940
concerned,
that the magician engaged in a ritual,

2323
01:56:57,050 --> 01:57:00,290
a sorcerer that someone is being out of 
dust,

2324
01:57:01,570 --> 01:57:06,570
like made the metal and the put the 
wires and just the right way so that it 

2325
01:57:06,570 --> 01:57:10,831
could get perfect orbit around a comment
going 400 miles an hour with harpoons.

2326
01:57:11,031 --> 01:57:16,031
That didn't work.
But it had fucking harpoons there could 

2327
01:57:16,031 --> 01:57:18,671
shoot into the thing.
One of these sourcer is the robe he was 

2328
01:57:18,671 --> 01:57:21,671
wearing happen to have women on it and 
as a byproduct instead of feminists and 

2329
01:57:23,361 --> 01:57:26,750
people who aren't feminists and atheists
and theists all being like,

2330
01:57:27,230 --> 01:57:30,800
you sir are a bad motherfucker.

2331
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:35,830
Got a Po box because I want to send you 
some cigars or cakes or anything you 

2332
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:37,460
want.
You deserve to get showered with.

2333
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:41,720
All of those scientists should just be 
getting massages for weeks.

2334
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:43,700
They should be getting whatever they 
want.

2335
01:57:43,701 --> 01:57:47,750
They should pop her Razzi should be 
following them out and snapping pictures

2336
01:57:47,751 --> 01:57:49,610
of them for what they did.
But no,

2337
01:57:49,850 --> 01:57:53,750
we're still stuck in this stupid 
frequency where a lot of us were like,

2338
01:57:53,751 --> 01:57:57,860
can you fucking believe you would wear 
that tastes lists shirt.

2339
01:57:58,190 --> 01:57:59,870
Oh,
you don't even understand.

2340
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:02,000
He could wear whatever he wants.
He's a scientist,

2341
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:03,980
but fighting instead of everyone being 
like,

2342
01:58:03,981 --> 01:58:05,600
we did it.
We worked together.

2343
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:09,620
We got a thing to land on a comet.
Let's see what else we can do.

2344
01:58:10,070 --> 01:58:11,390
No,
it's my favorite part of it.

2345
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:16,600
Watching men criticize the shirt doing.
It's so purely for female Brownie points

2346
01:58:19,370 --> 01:58:24,370
doing it so clearly.
I watched a twitter fight between a guy 

2347
01:58:24,370 --> 01:58:28,031
who claims calls himself a feminist and 
some woman and the woman who loves pinup

2348
01:58:28,791 --> 01:58:32,690
girls and she loves a like a rockabilly 
type shit,

2349
01:58:32,930 --> 01:58:37,930
which is the girl who,
by the way the shirt was invented by a 

2350
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:39,530
girl or created put together by a girl,
but there's similar patterns at one that

2351
01:58:39,531 --> 01:58:44,531
you sent me,
the link which eventually to becoming 

2352
01:58:44,531 --> 01:58:44,531
sold out.

2353
01:58:44,531 --> 01:58:47,250
It's slightly different than his,
but someone informed me that they make 

2354
01:58:47,250 --> 01:58:49,120
those shirts by hand,
so what could be going on is like,

2355
01:58:49,210 --> 01:58:54,210
it's a pattern that you can buy and then
they put it together and they make the 

2356
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:55,660
shirt and this girl who's his friend 
bought the pattern,

2357
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:56,610
bought the shirt,
you know,

2358
01:58:56,620 --> 01:59:01,620
bought the cloth that has the sexy 
ladies on it and made her friend shirt 

2359
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:02,620
because he loves her or I assume he 
loves her.

2360
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:07,660
He wore her shirt on TV and he was all 
happy and celebrate.

2361
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:13,020
What a sweetheart man.
Well this is how you know he's a 

2362
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:13,020
sweetheart the guy.
Instead of going,

2363
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:13,780
fuck you.
It's my shirt.

2364
01:59:13,781 --> 01:59:15,210
You guys are crazy.
Like,

2365
01:59:15,211 --> 01:59:20,211
Hey,
is there some real shit to be worried 

2366
01:59:20,211 --> 01:59:22,201
about?
Do you guys not pay attention to the 

2367
01:59:22,201 --> 01:59:22,201
fact that we landed a comment,
a girl keeping this shirt?

2368
01:59:22,201 --> 01:59:22,201
All right.
She's my friend.

2369
01:59:22,201 --> 01:59:26,971
I did it for her.
I would say it's the equivalent of like 

2370
01:59:26,971 --> 01:59:26,971
giving someone a shout out.
Okay,

2371
01:59:26,971 --> 01:59:29,200
relax.
Women like these kinds of shirts too,

2372
01:59:29,201 --> 01:59:34,201
but some people think that like you have
to take the sex and fun and comedy out 

2373
01:59:35,321 --> 01:59:39,400
of science and that a guy can have a 
personality and be a fucking Weirdo with

2374
01:59:39,401 --> 01:59:41,580
a bowling shirt on.
It has all the sexy women on it.

2375
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:45,340
I don't know who that guy is.
I think he's a hero and I think he's one

2376
01:59:45,341 --> 01:59:50,341
of the coolest guys on earth today 
because not only did he take part in 

2377
01:59:50,341 --> 01:59:50,960
getting that fucking thing to land on a 
comet,

2378
01:59:50,961 --> 01:59:55,961
but he had the balls on the day that 
that thing could not have maybe failed 

2379
01:59:56,710 --> 01:59:58,780
to wear that shirt.
That's true.

2380
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:02,010
It could have fucking not worked and 
they look at that guy and there was that

2381
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:02,410
true though.

2382
02:00:02,410 --> 02:00:03,760
Do we know that?
What did he,

2383
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:08,620
did he wear it the day that the project?
That was my understanding,

2384
02:00:08,621 --> 02:00:10,210
and I'm.
I don't want to know if it's different.

2385
02:00:10,220 --> 02:00:12,660
I'm going to stick to my version of this
guy,

2386
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:17,730
his hero scientists.
I'm fairly certain that that was the 

2387
02:00:17,730 --> 02:00:19,750
celebratory day and he knew that there 
was a chance.

2388
02:00:19,751 --> 02:00:22,120
That thing might not land and he's gonna
be.

2389
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:25,300
He's gonna become the punching bag of 
everyone.

2390
02:00:25,301 --> 02:00:30,301
He's like,
scientists are wearing these fucking 

2391
02:00:30,301 --> 02:00:30,301
retarded shirts,
man.

2392
02:00:30,301 --> 02:00:34,020
How are you going to land at comment?
How are you going to land a probe on a 

2393
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:34,030
comment when you're wearing these weird 
shirts?

2394
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:37,660
You know that guy put it,
really put himself out there.

2395
02:00:37,690 --> 02:00:39,070
It's true.
He's a bad ass.

2396
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:40,810
What's his name?
That's a good question.

2397
02:00:40,811 --> 02:00:43,510
We need to find that guys name.
That guy should ask Matt something.

2398
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:47,190
He should have his own float in the 
macy's Day parade scientists.

2399
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:50,590
I'm just going to google scientists 
shirt and I bet you get it right.

2400
02:00:51,370 --> 02:00:52,060
Yeah,
sure.

2401
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:53,950
That's definitely tailor.
Yeah.

2402
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:55,840
That's the first thing.
Matt Taylor,

2403
02:00:55,870 --> 02:01:00,370
Dr Matt Taylor Shirt made me cry too 
with rage at his abusers.

2404
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,000
Feminists freak out over the scientists 
girly shirt,

2405
02:01:04,510 --> 02:01:09,510
comment scientists,
Matt Taylor shirt scientist was awful 

2406
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:13,210
feminists.
Freak out over scientists group.

2407
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:14,860
This is fucking great.

2408
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:19,870
He's a comet scientists.
Well,

2409
02:01:19,871 --> 02:01:20,800
here's the thing,
man.

2410
02:01:21,370 --> 02:01:24,700
Pulled up some photos of some guy shirts
were like,

2411
02:01:24,701 --> 02:01:26,500
guys have like they're wearing cowboy 
hats.

2412
02:01:26,501 --> 02:01:31,501
They have no shirt on.
They're like the same exact kind of 

2413
02:01:31,501 --> 02:01:33,670
images and you know the shirtless and if
a woman wore that,

2414
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:35,920
would you do anything other than laugh?
Would you be like,

2415
02:01:35,921 --> 02:01:39,130
what is this crazy shirt you got?
Who would be offended?

2416
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,160
Who would see

2417
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,220
if a woman was on television and she had
just landed a fucking comment,

2418
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:48,490
landed a robot on a comment and it took 
12 years to get there and she's sitting 

2419
02:01:48,490 --> 02:01:52,421
there and she has a t shirt on and it 
has pictures of guys blowing each other 

2420
02:01:52,421 --> 02:01:52,421
on it.

2421
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:58,200
Who would be like this bitch,
this fucking bitch?

2422
02:01:58,201 --> 02:02:00,570
She thinks she could do that and put 
that in my face.

2423
02:02:01,050 --> 02:02:03,570
Now you would just be like,
it's happening.

2424
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:08,600
The university's waking up.
We're entering into a better period of 

2425
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:08,600
human history.
Yes.

2426
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:12,780
For you personally,
could never be offended by that.

2427
02:02:12,810 --> 02:02:15,570
You would only think it's funny.
I would think it was one of the funniest

2428
02:02:15,571 --> 02:02:17,040
things I'd ever seen.
Who.

2429
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:19,260
What person wouldn't think.
It's funny.

2430
02:02:19,261 --> 02:02:21,660
I get maybe if you were with your kids 
and the kids like,

2431
02:02:21,661 --> 02:02:26,661
Daddy,
why is that guy sucking on the guy's 

2432
02:02:26,661 --> 02:02:28,131
penis?
I didn't want to have to explain this 

2433
02:02:28,131 --> 02:02:28,131
shit so early,

2434
02:02:28,131 --> 02:02:28,131
but it's a comment.
Scientists,

2435
02:02:28,131 --> 02:02:29,280
they were weird.
Close

2436
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:33,700
comad scientists love gay guys that's 
there just in the house.

2437
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,670
You would just be like,
I don't know.

2438
02:02:36,150 --> 02:02:41,150
I don't know kid,
but they just landed a probe on a giant 

2439
02:02:41,150 --> 02:02:44,841
floating mountain that has priori pre 
precursors to human life on it.

2440
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:47,550
How about that friend?
I heard you say homo.

2441
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:49,920
That's what I heard.
I didn't hear all that other stuff.

2442
02:02:49,921 --> 02:02:52,710
You said Homo.
Homo is derogatory.

2443
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:57,000
Who cares what happens up in space?
If we can't have freedom down here,

2444
02:02:57,510 --> 02:03:02,510
freedom to not be abused by assholes 
with derogatory language use can still 

2445
02:03:02,671 --> 02:03:03,120
say home.
Oh,

2446
02:03:03,121 --> 02:03:03,640
by the way,
I don't.

2447
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:05,790
I've never been criticized for saying 
homo.

2448
02:03:05,970 --> 02:03:09,420
No one's come after me for saying Homo 
homos themselves.

2449
02:03:09,421 --> 02:03:11,890
Like Justin Martin.
Dale gave me a home El.

2450
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:12,870
Oh,
he did?

2451
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:13,860
Yes,
he did.

2452
02:03:13,861 --> 02:03:15,740
That's cool.
I don't know if he did,

2453
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:18,700
but he would not come.
I mean,

2454
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:20,970
I'm just saying it now because I know 
it's going to be tensions.

2455
02:03:20,971 --> 02:03:24,170
The most important that the idea another
in here.

2456
02:03:24,210 --> 02:03:26,670
What's not here in the intention.
No.

2457
02:03:27,390 --> 02:03:28,620
Oh,
you're doing that content.

2458
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:29,790
No,
it's not.

2459
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:34,850
What's important?
What's important is gender equality 

2460
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:35,880
overall.
When that becomes 100 percent across the

2461
02:03:35,881 --> 02:03:37,680
board,
then we can worry about your intention.

2462
02:03:38,130 --> 02:03:39,600
Right now it's about controlling 
language.

2463
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:41,310
Okay.
Wow.

2464
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:44,280
It's about you not being an asshole.
God.

2465
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:50,000
It's like the voice of all the things.
It's like if all the blogs on earth 

2466
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,320
formed into some monster and attack the 
city,

2467
02:03:52,321 --> 02:03:57,321
that's what it would talk like if all 
the blogs on earth got together and 

2468
02:03:57,321 --> 02:03:58,530
became an organism,
like a life force.

2469
02:03:58,980 --> 02:04:01,410
All the tumbler.
If Tumbler was a living creature,

2470
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:08,440
it would just.
It would be covered in tattoos and it 

2471
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:11,411
would have piercings all over his face 
and it would just be screaming into the 

2472
02:04:11,411 --> 02:04:11,411
abyss.

2473
02:04:11,411 --> 02:04:15,150
Hey Man,
have you seen that blog about etsy 

2474
02:04:15,150 --> 02:04:15,150
advice?
We talked about this on the air,

2475
02:04:15,150 --> 02:04:19,081
that ad see boyfriends like it's a blog 
of like boyfriends having to wear their 

2476
02:04:19,081 --> 02:04:20,230
girlfriends at close.
Have you seen that?

2477
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:22,390
What is etsy?
Etsy is a.

2478
02:04:22,570 --> 02:04:25,750
So etsy is a craft.
It's like an amp.

2479
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:27,100
What would you call it?
Craigslist.

2480
02:04:27,130 --> 02:04:29,350
For people who sell crafts and stuff.
Yeah,

2481
02:04:29,490 --> 02:04:34,490
it's exactly.
It's like I'm going to make a bunch of 

2482
02:04:34,490 --> 02:04:34,870
socks and sell them to you.
It's like a garage sale.

2483
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:35,960
Please look it up,
man.

2484
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:38,220
A garage.
Can you pull it up?

2485
02:04:38,221 --> 02:04:39,660
Brian?
It's so funny,

2486
02:04:39,661 --> 02:04:44,661
but it's like I'm confused.
Just watched this blog will all come 

2487
02:04:44,661 --> 02:04:46,170
clear like it's like people make crafts,
like I made gloves and I'm going to sell

2488
02:04:46,171 --> 02:04:51,171
them online or I made my own boots.
So there's a blog dedicated to 

2489
02:04:51,171 --> 02:04:55,280
boyfriends having to wear the sweaters 
that their girlfriends made and they all

2490
02:04:55,591 --> 02:04:57,690
looked semi miserable because they're in
the.

2491
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:00,290
Did you find it?
That's Etsy,

2492
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:02,470
but look up.
Find the blog.

2493
02:05:02,790 --> 02:05:07,790
Oh,
so it's just guys were in their 

2494
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:07,790
girlfriends creations.
You got see it.

2495
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:10,930
It's pretty.
Why do girls create like ridiculous 

2496
02:05:10,930 --> 02:05:10,930
things and they make them were like,
what do they make?

2497
02:05:10,930 --> 02:05:11,640
These guys were sad.
Etsy,

2498
02:05:11,641 --> 02:05:13,650
boyfriends dot tumbler dot.
Yeah.

2499
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:15,610
Check it out.
No,

2500
02:05:16,730 --> 02:05:18,450
not all blogs.
Okay,

2501
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:20,970
stop right there.
That shirt looks like what I have on.

2502
02:05:21,690 --> 02:05:26,670
Very similar.
I'm wearing if a lure a tracksuit top,

2503
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:29,910
and it's wonderful.
Now I understand why there's fat Italian

2504
02:05:29,911 --> 02:05:32,520
guys that sit out in front of like 
social clubs where these things,

2505
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:34,590
they're so relaxing,
they're comfortable.

2506
02:05:34,591 --> 02:05:36,420
It's like your clothes are giving you a 
hug.

2507
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:38,460
It's like inside.
It's all fuzzy and shit.

2508
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:41,880
It's great to comfortable as fuck.
Softest thing I've ever worn.

2509
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:48,560
And these guys are wearing these 
sweaters because they're posing for the 

2510
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:48,720
girl.

2511
02:05:50,750 --> 02:05:52,090
Um,
God,

2512
02:05:52,130 --> 02:05:55,830
what is this guy doing?
He's being his girlfriend obviously made

2513
02:05:55,831 --> 02:06:00,310
some kind of like knows warmer type 
thing and say he has no post.

2514
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:04,500
Sweet God damn a wine app to summon that
banner neck warmer.

2515
02:06:05,390 --> 02:06:07,520
Geez.
Okay.

2516
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:11,100
Does that a hat that she made and she 
made a Jean Jacket?

2517
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:12,930
Well,
it's fairly interesting.

2518
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:18,050
Okay.
It's just a bunch of guys wearing 

2519
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:18,050
shirts.
You're right.

2520
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:18,050
It's fine.
I'm a dick.

2521
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:20,490
I gotta stop doing now he's summing up 
darkness.

2522
02:06:20,670 --> 02:06:22,860
You know,
there's,

2523
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:25,900
there's a,
there's a,

2524
02:06:26,150 --> 02:06:30,300
it's called and there's a Buddhist 
author named Sharon Salzberg,

2525
02:06:30,301 --> 02:06:33,480
and she coined the great phrase 
recreational bitterness,

2526
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:38,130
and it's,
this isn't a recreational bitterness and

2527
02:06:38,131 --> 02:06:40,440
how damaging and dangerous is her name.
Again,

2528
02:06:40,470 --> 02:06:44,750
Sharon Salzberg,
Sharon Salzberg Speller,

2529
02:06:45,620 --> 02:06:46,530
Z,
b e R,

2530
02:06:46,531 --> 02:06:47,970
G,
b e R,

2531
02:06:47,971 --> 02:06:49,970
g Salzburg,
Sharon Salzberg,

2532
02:06:50,130 --> 02:06:52,230
recreational bitterness.
She tweeted about it.

2533
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:54,750
That's amazing.
Recreational betterness.

2534
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,750
It's uh,
uh,

2535
02:06:57,940 --> 02:06:58,400
hers,
it,

2536
02:06:58,401 --> 02:06:59,340
Joan Halifax.

2537
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:00,960
One of them said that,
I can't remember which one.

2538
02:07:02,870 --> 02:07:05,520
There's two.
There's two different Buddhist teachers,

2539
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:06,660
Roshi,
Joan,

2540
02:07:06,661 --> 02:07:08,510
Halifax,
or we'll figure it out.

2541
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,200
But anyway,
recreational bitterness,

2542
02:07:10,201 --> 02:07:15,201
how?
It's like that thing where you get 

2543
02:07:15,201 --> 02:07:17,181
around a group of people and your 
primary topic of conversation is what's 

2544
02:07:17,181 --> 02:07:18,960
wrong in the world.
Recreational betterness.

2545
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:20,640
I gotTa stop doing that,
man.

2546
02:07:20,641 --> 02:07:22,530
I'm so sick of doing even little ways.
You know,

2547
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:24,220
where you just kind of accidentally go 
that,

2548
02:07:25,190 --> 02:07:27,360
that fucking idiot.
Just kinda even joking,

2549
02:07:27,361 --> 02:07:28,220
isn't it?
Yeah,

2550
02:07:28,350 --> 02:07:29,670
it's dangerous.
I think.

2551
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,640
Rebecca Solnit,
Salzburg,

2552
02:07:32,670 --> 02:07:35,070
solnit.
Sharon Salzburg.

2553
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:36,040
I got

2554
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,600
here.
Rebecca solnit.

2555
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:39,370
Now look up.
She got married.

2556
02:07:40,210 --> 02:07:42,310
I don't need your name.
Salzburg sell out.

2557
02:07:45,450 --> 02:07:50,450
Um,
the cultivation of recreational 

2558
02:07:50,450 --> 02:07:50,450
business.
Speaking to her allies,

2559
02:07:50,450 --> 02:07:51,820
Rebecca Solnit,
or she might've been,

2560
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:56,290
she must've been quoting this person.
I got into 2012.

2561
02:07:57,500 --> 02:07:59,590
We looked it up,
but she might've been quoting this other

2562
02:07:59,591 --> 02:08:00,280
person.
I'm saying,

2563
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:02,160
I mean I didn't read into it.
Whatever,

2564
02:08:02,260 --> 02:08:05,170
either whoever created it all praise be 
to you.

2565
02:08:05,230 --> 02:08:07,780
May Live for children,
be fat.

2566
02:08:07,781 --> 02:08:09,730
And point is,
it's a fucking awesome quote.

2567
02:08:09,731 --> 02:08:11,470
Recreational bitterness is some real 
shit.

2568
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:13,480
I mean,
go to any comedy club.

2569
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:19,260
Oh my God.
Talk to the guys were like on the 

2570
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:19,260
outskirts especially that are trying to 
get in.

2571
02:08:19,350 --> 02:08:24,350
It's the water,
it's the water they swim in and it's so 

2572
02:08:24,350 --> 02:08:27,231
sad.
But it's like when you realize how it's 

2573
02:08:27,231 --> 02:08:27,420
infected your own life in the small 
ways,

2574
02:08:27,421 --> 02:08:32,421
like it's the smart.
And this is why mindfulness is good 

2575
02:08:32,421 --> 02:08:33,240
because you just sort of watch yourself 
and then the next time you find yourself

2576
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:38,250
bringing out some old bones to chew on 
with your friends and you're just saying

2577
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:40,560
or,
or what are you referring to yourself?

2578
02:08:40,561 --> 02:08:42,490
Or like,
what is this idiot want?

2579
02:08:43,850 --> 02:08:45,680
God is say,
you know,

2580
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:49,350
you look at the content of your language
and it and it's like,

2581
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:54,620
you know,
if you go into the idea that the 

2582
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:54,620
universe conforms to the way you 
describe it,

2583
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:58,940
then that is a very dangerous modality.
Get in to get into because maybe you're 

2584
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:03,291
actually coloring the world with your,
with your linguistic farts.

2585
02:09:03,451 --> 02:09:08,451
The constant degradation of this 
universe that you're in as a kind of 

2586
02:09:08,700 --> 02:09:09,990
habitual fun

2587
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:14,080
will you for sure taint taint,
but you.

2588
02:09:14,340 --> 02:09:18,050
You interact with everything.
You come in contact with every person.

2589
02:09:18,051 --> 02:09:20,690
You come in contact with,
every situation you find yourself in,

2590
02:09:20,990 --> 02:09:23,870
you're in control of what kind of energy
comes out of you.

2591
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:28,960
In that scenario and just in doing that,
you talk about the ripple effect of the 

2592
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:33,200
savages that created humanity and how 
it's affecting us today.

2593
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:38,740
Also every like good thing you do or 
every good interaction that you have or 

2594
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:40,820
every great experience that you have 
with other people,

2595
02:09:40,821 --> 02:09:44,870
that spreads out in a good way and the 
more you do that,

2596
02:09:45,140 --> 02:09:49,130
the more those people might likely 
learned from that experience that that's

2597
02:09:49,131 --> 02:09:51,620
a good thing to do.
And then do it in turn to other people,

2598
02:09:51,790 --> 02:09:54,830
right?
So one of the nicest fucking compliments

2599
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:58,820
anybody ever gives me when I go to 
comedy clubs or wherever is how generous

2600
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:00,250
the people that come to the shows are.

2601
02:10:00,970 --> 02:10:02,480
It's because we talk about it all the 
time.

2602
02:10:02,481 --> 02:10:05,600
You to have talked about it many times,
leaving nice tips for people,

2603
02:10:05,810 --> 02:10:10,810
being friendly,
people sincerely letting people know 

2604
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:11,510
that you're happy with what they've done
or who they are.

2605
02:10:11,570 --> 02:10:14,750
Or when you do that and you show like 
friendship.

2606
02:10:14,830 --> 02:10:19,830
And just a real genuine,
unselfish gratitude when you do that or 

2607
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:23,360
a generosity.
When you do that,

2608
02:10:23,361 --> 02:10:26,240
you'll,
you can create a whole world where other

2609
02:10:26,241 --> 02:10:31,241
people start doing that.
The people around you start doing that 

2610
02:10:31,241 --> 02:10:31,241
too.
Like maybe the waitress,

2611
02:10:31,241 --> 02:10:33,980
she gave her a $50 tip for a fucking 
coffee and a donut and she's

2612
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:34,700
gonna,
you know,

2613
02:10:34,701 --> 02:10:39,701
for whatever reason gives somebody else 
a tip or give somebody some advice that 

2614
02:10:39,711 --> 02:10:42,950
you want our help a friend or you feel 
inspired to be nice.

2615
02:10:42,951 --> 02:10:44,390
And who knows,
who knows,

2616
02:10:44,391 --> 02:10:46,640
you know,
you help a friend move and you do it all

2617
02:10:46,641 --> 02:10:48,110
cool.
And selflessly,

2618
02:10:48,111 --> 02:10:53,111
and you take your time out of your day,
that friend might be a fucking mover 

2619
02:10:53,111 --> 02:10:53,240
helper for life.
That might be like,

2620
02:10:53,241 --> 02:10:58,241
dude,
Dunkin fucking got up at nine in the 

2621
02:10:58,241 --> 02:10:58,241
morning,
met me at my house,

2622
02:10:58,241 --> 02:10:59,000
helped me get the rental truck,
never asked for any money,

2623
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:00,010
you know?
And,

2624
02:11:00,011 --> 02:11:05,011
and he helped me all day.
He was dedicated to help me move my 

2625
02:11:05,011 --> 02:11:05,330
fucking shit out of my apartment.
I'm going to do that for everybody now.

2626
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:07,580
And what a great feeling it is when 
you're doing that,

2627
02:11:07,581 --> 02:11:12,581
man,
it's so cool and you're so good to get 

2628
02:11:12,581 --> 02:11:12,581
here.

2629
02:11:12,581 --> 02:11:16,940
It's so nice when it's effortless.
And then when you practice mindfulness 

2630
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:21,190
in the midst of that,
you get to watch the parts of yourself 

2631
02:11:21,190 --> 02:11:22,240
that do.
Or is it because no matter how many,

2632
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:27,380
maybe you're a supremely awakened being,
but there you're still going to have 

2633
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:31,510
this kind of psychic indigestion.
We're in the midst of helping or 

2634
02:11:31,510 --> 02:11:35,381
something.
You might notice certain selfish 

2635
02:11:35,381 --> 02:11:35,381
thoughts start emerging about wanting to
get something back from it.

2636
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:40,450
And you can't blame yourself.
You were raised in a system of exchange.

2637
02:11:40,551 --> 02:11:41,870
You know,
if you give me this,

2638
02:11:41,871 --> 02:11:43,640
I give you this,
if you hurt me this way,

2639
02:11:43,641 --> 02:11:48,641
I hurt you that way.
So there a momentum in the direction of 

2640
02:11:48,641 --> 02:11:51,461
selfishness that comes from a lifetime 
of conditioning and that's why if you 

2641
02:11:51,461 --> 02:11:54,260
put yourself in a situation where you're
giving to someone and add mindfulness to

2642
02:11:54,261 --> 02:11:59,261
the equation,
you'll start learning a lot about 

2643
02:11:59,261 --> 02:12:01,421
yourself and see your resistance to 
purely being in that a complete state of

2644
02:12:01,971 --> 02:12:04,880
just letting it go,
giving it away,

2645
02:12:05,090 --> 02:12:10,090
believing that we exist in a universe of
pure abundance where there is not a 

2646
02:12:10,090 --> 02:12:13,661
limited supply,
but an infinite supply and the ghost 

2647
02:12:13,661 --> 02:12:16,871
story,
the echo of the savages is one of its 

2648
02:12:16,871 --> 02:12:16,871
primary components.

2649
02:12:16,871 --> 02:12:20,180
Talks about a universe where everything 
is limited and can go away and therefore

2650
02:12:20,181 --> 02:12:25,181
you must constantly be on the defense 
when maybe the new story is one where 

2651
02:12:25,181 --> 02:12:25,181
it's like,
no,

2652
02:12:25,181 --> 02:12:27,290
we live in an infinite universe of pure 
abundance.

2653
02:12:27,470 --> 02:12:32,470
And the more you surrender to that,
the more selfless you become and the 

2654
02:12:32,470 --> 02:12:34,250
more you embody that by giving me that 
to other people,

2655
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:38,660
the more you summoned into this 
dimension of brand new paradigm that has

2656
02:12:38,661 --> 02:12:43,220
as its nucleus love or you get James 
Brown,

2657
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:45,290
James Brown,
you don't get.

2658
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:49,420
If you have all those other things you 
don't get on that,

2659
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:54,820
you to have some suppression.
You've got to have some fucking iron 

2660
02:12:54,820 --> 02:12:57,560
will that's been developed to fight 
against the oppressive white man.

2661
02:12:57,900 --> 02:12:59,870
So you get on that stage and you just 
show one.

2662
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:04,280
Everybody how shiny your shoes on your 
fucking spinning and splits and you live

2663
02:13:04,281 --> 02:13:07,640
in a marginalized civilization,
a marginalized culture,

2664
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:13,030
and you're a bad motherfucker and you 
want the world to know it and you get 

2665
02:13:13,030 --> 02:13:14,320
out there with your cocktail slip back.
Yeah man.

2666
02:13:14,570 --> 02:13:16,820
Tape.
Both are beautiful because one,

2667
02:13:16,821 --> 02:13:21,410
you got the flower growing out of the 
sidewalk or out of the concrete where it

2668
02:13:21,411 --> 02:13:23,300
should never be.
And the other one,

2669
02:13:23,301 --> 02:13:28,301
you've got a field of flowers that are 
just infinitely growing under the 

2670
02:13:28,301 --> 02:13:29,030
beautiful sun.
Both are incredible.

2671
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:30,950
They're incredible.
I love them.

2672
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:32,070
And I think that

2673
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:37,070
as long as that light of humanity is 
shining on the potential to be a flower 

2674
02:13:38,191 --> 02:13:41,340
bursting out of a sidewalk or to be a 
community of flowers,

2675
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:43,110
that's what it's all about,
man.

2676
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:46,860
There's no feeling like that.
But this fucking culture of bitterness,

2677
02:13:46,980 --> 02:13:50,370
it's turning your back on that notion.
It's eliminating.

2678
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:55,050
I mean you might say James Brown was a 
completely bitter person,

2679
02:13:55,290 --> 02:13:57,870
but when I see James Brown and saying,
yeah,

2680
02:13:57,871 --> 02:13:59,070
I know you're not,
I know you're not.

2681
02:13:59,190 --> 02:14:04,190
I'm saying what he's doing.
Even if it might be a reactionary 

2682
02:14:04,190 --> 02:14:05,940
retaliation,
when you see that guy come out,

2683
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:11,210
especially that amazing concert where 
the Mick Jagger said the worst mistake 

2684
02:14:11,210 --> 02:14:13,560
of his life was following James Brown.
You ever heard about that story?

2685
02:14:14,010 --> 02:14:17,400
When you see that fucking concert,
that's.

2686
02:14:17,401 --> 02:14:20,550
I think that's love.
Exploding out of that guy love amplified

2687
02:14:20,551 --> 02:14:24,060
through cocaine perhaps,
but still love cocaine is love.

2688
02:14:24,061 --> 02:14:26,760
Is that what you're saying?
I think cocaine can amplify love though.

2689
02:14:26,761 --> 02:14:28,530
I don't like this stuff makes me 
depressed,

2690
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:31,200
but I've heard that.
I've not joking.

2691
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:33,600
That's not a sarcastic.
I like almost every job,

2692
02:14:33,601 --> 02:14:35,280
but I can't do cocaine.
It just,

2693
02:14:35,490 --> 02:14:40,490
I don't know what it is man,
but I do it and it just gives me the 

2694
02:14:40,490 --> 02:14:40,490
blues.
It's really weird.

2695
02:14:40,910 --> 02:14:41,370
Um,
does,

2696
02:14:41,390 --> 02:14:43,420
did I never heard James Brown did 
cocaine?

2697
02:14:43,421 --> 02:14:46,690
Did he was James Brown and the drugs.
I should know that.

2698
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:47,770
I don't know.
James Brown,

2699
02:14:47,890 --> 02:14:49,970
just assuming.
And that's not fair to say.

2700
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:50,610
You know,
why

2701
02:14:51,010 --> 02:14:52,840
looked it up?
Because I don't want to be racist.

2702
02:14:53,180 --> 02:14:58,180
Well,
I don't want to be racist looking up 

2703
02:14:58,180 --> 02:14:58,180
something.
Yeah.

2704
02:14:58,180 --> 02:14:59,140
But he did drugs for a black man.

2705
02:14:59,680 --> 02:15:00,340
Well,
you know,

2706
02:15:00,341 --> 02:15:02,500
anytime somebody does something great.
Most people.

2707
02:15:02,501 --> 02:15:03,880
Like what drugs were you on?

2708
02:15:04,050 --> 02:15:09,050
James was smoking a lot of pot,
but I could smell something else in 

2709
02:15:09,050 --> 02:15:09,050
there.
I confronted him about it.

2710
02:15:09,050 --> 02:15:13,881
Brown had a previous objection to PCP or
angel dust and had freebased cocaine,

2711
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:17,460
cocaine,
crack cocaine.

2712
02:15:17,461 --> 02:15:19,680
When you're playing Croquette,
you have a little coke,

2713
02:15:20,690 --> 02:15:23,550
but he shrugged it off.
I think the second I was out of there,

2714
02:15:23,551 --> 02:15:26,520
James was smoking pot laced with other 
stronger drugs.

2715
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:29,160
Wow.
This is from Mick Jagger's.

2716
02:15:29,161 --> 02:15:30,720
James Brown biopic.

2717
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:34,430
Yeah.
Make Jagger,

2718
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:37,670
goddamn drugs.
Did He,

2719
02:15:38,350 --> 02:15:41,260
I mean what?
It's Mick Jagger doesn't make Jack.

2720
02:15:41,430 --> 02:15:44,060
This is a woman actually said this.
This is A.

2721
02:15:44,130 --> 02:15:46,340
I'm getting the quote.
It's from that article.

2722
02:15:46,940 --> 02:15:48,670
That's so funny.
Mick Jagger being like,

2723
02:15:48,710 --> 02:15:52,100
I'm pretty sure I smell drugs and James 
Brown's marijuana.

2724
02:15:52,250 --> 02:15:54,840
This is the Tommy Ray.
Tom.

2725
02:15:54,870 --> 02:15:56,610
I too.
Yeah,

2726
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:01,720
Tom.
I are who was hired by Jagger to be a 

2727
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:02,840
consultant for the new film is now 
working with the Rolling Stones Star and

2728
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:06,980
his team on a two hour documentary,
which will set the story over the battle

2729
02:16:07,010 --> 02:16:12,010
over James Brown's estate.
Brown was raised in a brothel by his 

2730
02:16:12,010 --> 02:16:16,481
aunt after his mother abandoned him as 
an infant and his abusive father refused

2731
02:16:16,611 --> 02:16:18,690
to care for him.
Holy Shit.

2732
02:16:18,710 --> 02:16:23,710
Your prior to it was this rejection that
is believed to have led him to becoming 

2733
02:16:24,051 --> 02:16:26,870
a control freak.
I'm a control freak and later life.

2734
02:16:26,930 --> 02:16:30,010
Wow.
That's man.

2735
02:16:30,490 --> 02:16:32,710
He always insisted on being called Mr 
Brown.

2736
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:34,780
Even by me,
she smiles.

2737
02:16:34,990 --> 02:16:36,820
It was about respect.
This man.

2738
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:40,750
This was a man who came from nothing who
dragged himself up by his bootstraps.

2739
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,850
He had talent,
but he was ahead of its time.

2740
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:48,990
God,
that motherfucker was a bad mother 

2741
02:16:48,990 --> 02:16:48,990
fucker.
What are you playing up here?

2742
02:16:48,990 --> 02:16:49,540
Why are you showing us?

2743
02:16:49,790 --> 02:16:50,270
Uh,
well,

2744
02:16:50,271 --> 02:16:53,990
on wikipedia it was saying for the 
majority of his career,

2745
02:16:54,020 --> 02:16:59,020
Brown carried around a strict drug and 
alcohol free policy with any member in 

2746
02:16:59,020 --> 02:16:59,690
his entourage,
including band members,

2747
02:16:59,691 --> 02:17:02,490
firing people who disobeyed orders.
Uh,

2748
02:17:02,510 --> 02:17:07,010
but said however,
in the 19 eighties it was alleged legit.

2749
02:17:07,011 --> 02:17:12,011
Brown himself was using drugs after 
meeting and lady later marrying Andrea 

2750
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:12,320
Rodriguez.

2751
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:17,580
Oh.
So early in his career he was drug free 

2752
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:17,580
and then later in his life he started 
fucking hit it hard.

2753
02:17:18,350 --> 02:17:20,710
And that's what makes sense.
It domestic violence started.

2754
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:23,860
Listen,
if you really want to do PCP,

2755
02:17:23,861 --> 02:17:28,861
that's the best way to do it.
What are you gonna do like a pushy 

2756
02:17:28,861 --> 02:17:29,350
people snort PCP?
I'm sure they do,

2757
02:17:29,830 --> 02:17:34,830
man.
That I went through a phase of watching 

2758
02:17:34,830 --> 02:17:36,490
PCP videos that people on PCP because it
looks like they're possessed by demons.

2759
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:39,760
Have you ever seen it?
Like the emergency room videos of people

2760
02:17:39,761 --> 02:17:44,761
on PCP?
It's as close as you get to demonic 

2761
02:17:44,761 --> 02:17:47,761
possession.
Like they don't know who the fuck they 

2762
02:17:47,761 --> 02:17:47,761
are,
they're saying weird shit.

2763
02:17:47,761 --> 02:17:49,450
They have to strap them down with 
leather straps,

2764
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:52,750
but it's like the exorcist man that a 
person on a bay,

2765
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:57,960
those are the stories where you know the
cops shoot them nine times and they 

2766
02:17:57,960 --> 02:17:58,280
don't drop a break.

2767
02:17:58,290 --> 02:18:03,290
The handcuffs shatter their risk trying 
to get them off when they say like 

2768
02:18:03,290 --> 02:18:06,810
ancient Sumeria and darkness was on the.
And I always tell you about my old 

2769
02:18:09,911 --> 02:18:11,170
boxing coach.
Now.

2770
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:16,200
My old boxing coach was on pcp and go,
got his finger bitten off in a street 

2771
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:18,310
fight.
His finger on his right hand was gone.

2772
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:23,340
His index finger that got bid it off.
So he had his big toe removed and his 

2773
02:18:24,311 --> 02:18:29,311
big toe attached to where his index 
finger was but permanently curved so 

2774
02:18:29,311 --> 02:18:31,270
that he could still throw right hooks.
Wow.

2775
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:33,580
So when you shake his hand,
he would shake his hand.

2776
02:18:33,581 --> 02:18:35,830
You'd get that.
You would get like a hand in one thing.

2777
02:18:35,831 --> 02:18:40,831
It would be curved.
So he had the doctor fix it and sew it 

2778
02:18:40,831 --> 02:18:41,470
together.
Curved because it was one of two things.

2779
02:18:41,471 --> 02:18:46,471
Either it would have to stay straight or
would it have to be curved and he went 

2780
02:18:46,471 --> 02:18:46,540
with this so he could still throw right 
hooks.

2781
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:51,600
I gotta tell you man,
I almost want to get my finger a place 

2782
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:55,021
of my toe.
She has to tell that story because 

2783
02:18:55,021 --> 02:18:57,070
that's what your footwork footwork.
You're missing your next big toe.

2784
02:18:57,220 --> 02:18:59,650
Your big toes gone,
your big toes there,

2785
02:18:59,651 --> 02:19:01,870
but your next big toes gone and that was
the one,

2786
02:19:01,871 --> 02:19:03,220
you know,
that long freaky one.

2787
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:08,460
He had a long freaking one has their 
shit removed and that was his index 

2788
02:19:08,460 --> 02:19:08,740
finger.
So he had like a short index finger.

2789
02:19:09,110 --> 02:19:11,230
His finger,
his inexperience basically like a pinky.

2790
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:13,330
It was basically like really close to 
like a pinky.

2791
02:19:13,390 --> 02:19:18,390
What kind of life are you living where 
whenever you look at your thought,

2792
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:20,410
your toe finger,
you're like,

2793
02:19:20,411 --> 02:19:25,411
yeah,
that was when I was on pcp and that 

2794
02:19:25,411 --> 02:19:26,840
street fight.
I got to go teach boxing now that's,

2795
02:19:26,940 --> 02:19:27,860
that's.
So that's.

2796
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:31,280
There's so many bad ass is out there.
I didn't end up in this incarnation.

2797
02:19:31,281 --> 02:19:34,040
I didn't become a bad ass,
but that seems fun.

2798
02:19:34,270 --> 02:19:36,380
You know,
that seems like a really cool life.

2799
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:38,070
Tell you about this guy.

2800
02:19:38,930 --> 02:19:40,080
No,
Joe,

2801
02:19:40,110 --> 02:19:42,470
you never.
Somehow you completely missed telling me

2802
02:19:42,471 --> 02:19:43,880
that you were trained in boxing

2803
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:49,500
PCP user who had his finger off.
He was a longshoreman who is crazy.

2804
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:55,150
I mean still is a great guy,
but he was like one of the toughest guys

2805
02:19:55,151 --> 02:19:57,400
I've ever met in my life.
Like legit,

2806
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:59,050
bonafide,
tough guy.

2807
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:02,290
His name's Joe Lake.
He's still a friend of mine from Boston.

2808
02:20:03,210 --> 02:20:04,810
He was,
he was an animal.

2809
02:20:04,811 --> 02:20:06,250
Dude.
This is a funny story.

2810
02:20:06,310 --> 02:20:11,310
I was supposed to work at a nick's 
comedy stop was supposed to do an open 

2811
02:20:11,310 --> 02:20:11,310
mic.
They're not work,

2812
02:20:11,310 --> 02:20:12,070
you know,
stopped by for the open mic night.

2813
02:20:12,130 --> 02:20:13,540
And uh,
Joe Lake tells me,

2814
02:20:13,541 --> 02:20:14,720
he goes,
oh no guy,

2815
02:20:14,810 --> 02:20:17,230
dominic who runs the fucking place.
I'll come down and watch you.

2816
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:20,710
So he comes and he sits in the big 
fucking giant Irish guy.

2817
02:20:20,950 --> 02:20:23,440
Just murderous puncher.
Just knocked people.

2818
02:20:23,441 --> 02:20:25,690
Did you know,
just tough as shit.

2819
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:28,240
Right.
And his friend Mike,

2820
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:32,230
who ran the comedy club,
one of those bouncers didn't show up.

2821
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:33,670
So he asked Joe Lake,
he goes,

2822
02:20:33,671 --> 02:20:38,010
will you help me out when you wash the 
crowd and make sure nobody fucking steal

2823
02:20:38,011 --> 02:20:43,011
any money or something just to get to 
stand back there and watch the show and 

2824
02:20:43,011 --> 02:20:43,011
I'll pay you x amount of money.
He goes,

2825
02:20:43,011 --> 02:20:43,011
AH,
fuck it.

2826
02:20:43,011 --> 02:20:46,861
I'll come see the show.
So he goes and sees the show where 

2827
02:20:46,861 --> 02:20:49,051
there's a guy works for the club that 
doesn't know that Joe is just doing a 

2828
02:20:49,051 --> 02:20:50,530
favor for Mike.
Mike Betts,

2829
02:20:50,531 --> 02:20:51,610
who runs the place.
Alright.

2830
02:20:51,910 --> 02:20:56,910
So he yells at Joe like,
why don't you fucking kicking this 

2831
02:20:56,910 --> 02:20:58,180
handle,
hit this heckler out you fucking idiot.

2832
02:20:58,330 --> 02:20:59,650
He goes,
that's your fucking job.

2833
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:04,860
You go kick that guy out in.
Joe Picks him up and slams me against 

2834
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:08,671
walls,
literally lifts them in the air and is 

2835
02:21:08,671 --> 02:21:08,671
holding him up against the wall.
He goes,

2836
02:21:08,671 --> 02:21:09,520
I don't know who the fuck you think you 
are talking to.

2837
02:21:09,590 --> 02:21:13,840
You talk to me like that.
And you go into the hospital and then he

2838
02:21:13,841 --> 02:21:17,530
puts them down and he just puts a finger
in front of his face and he goes,

2839
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:22,770
okay.
And he walks away and the guy is just a 

2840
02:21:22,770 --> 02:21:23,260
guy who was 150 pounds at the most.
Joe's a big guy.

2841
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:29,040
And uh,
I show up at the open mic night and Joe 

2842
02:21:29,411 --> 02:21:34,411
shows up and this guy who works the club
sees Joe and turns white like a sheet.

2843
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:37,660
And Joe walks over to him,
puts his hand on his shoulders.

2844
02:21:37,750 --> 02:21:40,330
He's towering over this guy,
puts his hands on him and he says,

2845
02:21:40,630 --> 02:21:42,580
this is my friend over here,
Joe Rogan,

2846
02:21:42,610 --> 02:21:44,380
who's an up and comer.
Very funny kid.

2847
02:21:44,381 --> 02:21:45,460
You know,
you should give him some work.

2848
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:48,910
And the guy's like looking at me.
I never worked at club ever

2849
02:21:50,390 --> 02:21:55,390
the rest of my days.
It took forever to get into that club I 

2850
02:21:55,901 --> 02:21:57,970
did for years.
I did all the other clubs.

2851
02:21:57,971 --> 02:21:59,770
I couldn't do that club.
They will fuck me.

2852
02:21:59,771 --> 02:22:03,300
I couldn't do weekends.
I'm so glad that story ends like that.

2853
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:06,790
It's so much cooler than getting mafia 
it into a comedy club.

2854
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:08,020
Well,
I won't say the name of this club,

2855
02:22:08,050 --> 02:22:10,330
but this club was famous for paying 
people in cocaine.

2856
02:22:10,930 --> 02:22:14,770
This club was run by run by people of 
unscrupulous connections.

2857
02:22:14,771 --> 02:22:19,771
Allegedly.
I do not know whether or not any of it 

2858
02:22:19,771 --> 02:22:22,261
was true,
but I had witnessed things that would 

2859
02:22:22,261 --> 02:22:22,261
lead me to believe that it probably was 
true.

2860
02:22:22,261 --> 02:22:22,710
I think I know the club you're telling 
me.

2861
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:24,820
It's like fucking candy,
man.

2862
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:28,020
The guys are ready.
We're good guys.

2863
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:30,930
It was a terrible situation.
If that hadn't happened,

2864
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:33,060
I probably would have got along with 
them.

2865
02:22:33,061 --> 02:22:35,490
Fine.
And I eventually did.

2866
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:38,160
They had to realize that I didn't have a
grudge and I do.

2867
02:22:38,161 --> 02:22:39,840
I wasn't,
but he was embarrassed,

2868
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:45,040
you know,
that this guy now was in the club again 

2869
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:45,510
and he couldn't do anything about it and
the whole thing was a mess,

2870
02:22:45,630 --> 02:22:48,510
you know?
It was a mess and that guy always had it

2871
02:22:48,511 --> 02:22:49,260
out for me because

2872
02:22:51,010 --> 02:22:54,340
he just thought you had brought a thug 
to get your way on stage.

2873
02:22:54,380 --> 02:22:54,730
Exactly.

2874
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:57,950
I'm sure that's exactly what he thought.
I was fucking terrified.

2875
02:22:58,790 --> 02:23:02,020
But when you meet guys like that,
like read you,

2876
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:03,260
you to go,
oh,

2877
02:23:03,261 --> 02:23:08,261
there's a guy like that out there.
If you ever start thinking that you 

2878
02:23:08,261 --> 02:23:08,261
know,
like,

2879
02:23:08,261 --> 02:23:09,690
oh,
I'm a fucking bad ass,

2880
02:23:09,710 --> 02:23:11,600
all my mentality is different than you 
know,

2881
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:14,690
you need to be a guy who got his finger 
bitten off in a fight because he was

2882
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:19,790
pc,
had his toe sewed in place of that 

2883
02:23:19,790 --> 02:23:19,790
fucking finger.
So in a way that.

2884
02:23:19,790 --> 02:23:22,260
So we can punch in a way so that you 
could keep punching.

2885
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:26,040
Exactly.
If I got an a PCP street fight,

2886
02:23:26,190 --> 02:23:29,070
if it ever happened,
like somehow I don't know,

2887
02:23:29,071 --> 02:23:34,071
my fucking neighbors mad about the 
laundry room or something and we get in 

2888
02:23:34,071 --> 02:23:38,110
a PCP fueled street where my neighbor 
bites off my finger and I'm in the 

2889
02:23:39,811 --> 02:23:43,560
hospital and they're like,
we can put your toe back on.

2890
02:23:43,710 --> 02:23:48,710
I'm not going to be like,
can you just make sure you put it on a 

2891
02:23:48,710 --> 02:23:48,710
way I can keep fucking fighting?

2892
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:55,440
Well,
he was a boxer and he was a boxing 

2893
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:55,440
coach.
I met him because I was working at this,

2894
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:59,880
this gym.
I was teaching taekwondo at this 

2895
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:02,340
nautilus plus place in revere and there 
was this gym that was attached to it,

2896
02:24:03,371 --> 02:24:05,290
like a kickboxing gym.
And I took over,

2897
02:24:05,291 --> 02:24:10,291
I was teaching the Jehan Kim Taekwondo 
Institute's classes other than revere,

2898
02:24:10,331 --> 02:24:15,331
and he was a boxer that would come by 
and use the weights and all that stuff 

2899
02:24:15,331 --> 02:24:16,870
and we just became friends.
And so we exchanged techniques.

2900
02:24:16,930 --> 02:24:18,790
He would teach me how to box.
I was teaching them how to kick.

2901
02:24:18,940 --> 02:24:20,500
That's cool.
We became friends and I was like,

2902
02:24:20,501 --> 02:24:22,210
Oh my God,
this guy's fucking crazy.

2903
02:24:22,211 --> 02:24:22,560
He's a

2904
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:25,370
great guy.
That's cool to be a martial artist.

2905
02:24:25,371 --> 02:24:27,600
I don't have memories like that.
You know what,

2906
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:30,590
one day they're gonna I don't have 
memories like that,

2907
02:24:30,950 --> 02:24:32,630
but that would be.
Those are cool memories.

2908
02:24:32,631 --> 02:24:33,710
This,
it'd be cool memories,

2909
02:24:33,711 --> 02:24:34,610
man.
I love that.

2910
02:24:34,611 --> 02:24:36,980
I love to be like,
be able to be like,

2911
02:24:36,981 --> 02:24:39,590
yeah,
you know that my star craft coach,

2912
02:24:39,700 --> 02:24:44,700
you know,
that's as close as I've gotten to that 

2913
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:46,970
kind of any kind of competition that's 
as close as I got.

2914
02:24:47,150 --> 02:24:47,510
Well,
for me,

2915
02:24:47,511 --> 02:24:50,120
it was so long ago when I feel like I'm 
lying when I tell the stories,

2916
02:24:50,210 --> 02:24:53,540
like I know they're all true and that I 
can verify them and I'll call my friends

2917
02:24:53,541 --> 02:24:55,160
who were there,
like my good friend Steve Graham,

2918
02:24:55,161 --> 02:24:56,740
who I'm still friends with.
Um,

2919
02:24:56,870 --> 02:25:01,870
I'll,
we'll talk about the old days all the 

2920
02:25:01,870 --> 02:25:01,870
time.
But when I talk about it,

2921
02:25:01,870 --> 02:25:06,341
it seems like a lie.
Like it doesn't seem like it was really 

2922
02:25:06,341 --> 02:25:06,341
happening.
Like as in

2923
02:25:06,341 --> 02:25:06,850
it doesn't seem like a lie to me.
No,

2924
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:07,650
no.
I mean to me,

2925
02:25:08,010 --> 02:25:09,060
even though it was my life.
Oh,

2926
02:25:09,061 --> 02:25:10,620
I'm sorry.
I thought you meant you think.

2927
02:25:10,670 --> 02:25:11,270
Oh No,
no,

2928
02:25:11,271 --> 02:25:11,550
no,
no,

2929
02:25:11,551 --> 02:25:16,551
no.
I'm saying in my life when I tell the 

2930
02:25:16,551 --> 02:25:16,551
story,
like I know I met,

2931
02:25:16,551 --> 02:25:18,420
I saw him again a couple of years ago.
He really does some permanently curve.

2932
02:25:18,421 --> 02:25:20,340
He's a great guy.
But I mean,

2933
02:25:20,341 --> 02:25:21,750
when I tell that story,
why did I make that?

2934
02:25:21,751 --> 02:25:22,230
I'm like,
no,

2935
02:25:22,231 --> 02:25:23,770
I didn't make that up.
I really know that guy.

2936
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:24,150
I

2937
02:25:24,420 --> 02:25:29,420
knew a dude who's arrested when I was 
living in Boston because someone had 

2938
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:34,860
killed this guy and broken virtually 
every bone in his body and continually 

2939
02:25:35,231 --> 02:25:40,231
injected him with cocaine to wake him up
when he would black out and they kept 

2940
02:25:40,231 --> 02:25:42,670
breaking his bones probably with like a 
hammer or something like that.

2941
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:47,790
I'd probably hitting him with a sledge 
hammer and just breaking his body and 

2942
02:25:47,790 --> 02:25:50,821
when he would pass out from the shock 
that injected with cocaine and they did 

2943
02:25:50,821 --> 02:25:53,881
that over and over and over again until 
they eventually killed them and then 

2944
02:25:53,881 --> 02:25:56,251
they chopped them up into little pieces 
and this guy and I've got arrested for 

2945
02:25:56,251 --> 02:25:58,000
that and I don't know if he did it and I
don't know if he didn't do it,

2946
02:25:58,420 --> 02:26:01,750
but I know who she was.
She was a scary guy.

2947
02:26:01,751 --> 02:26:03,940
He was a scary guy that went to jail for
several years.

2948
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:06,410
What did the guy do that they were 
doing?

2949
02:26:06,570 --> 02:26:09,040
I have no idea,
but it was a big story.

2950
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:13,420
It was a big story in the news and then 
when I got arrested for it I was like,

2951
02:26:13,450 --> 02:26:14,720
oh,
okay.

2952
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:19,860
Now I shouldn't say friend training,
partner guy who showed up the same gym 

2953
02:26:19,860 --> 02:26:23,101
as me.
I mean we'd never didn't have more 

2954
02:26:23,101 --> 02:26:23,510
morehouse reports to Joe.
That's one of the floors,

2955
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:26,250
fucking things I ever heard.
Every time you,

2956
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:29,140
you finally fall into the abyss.
Finally you're like,

2957
02:26:29,141 --> 02:26:30,070
it's over.
It's over.

2958
02:26:30,071 --> 02:26:33,280
I'm passing out.
You get a cocaine rush.

2959
02:26:33,380 --> 02:26:34,750
Yeah,
they,

2960
02:26:34,940 --> 02:26:37,580
they killed that guy slow.
I don't know what he did.

2961
02:26:37,790 --> 02:26:42,790
I mean,
he must've done something awful or 

2962
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:42,790
something must've gone awful.
Who fucking knows?

2963
02:26:42,980 --> 02:26:47,980
But I knew a lot of people like that.
That's the weird thing about like fight 

2964
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:50,630
gyms as you come in contact with some 
really scary people.

2965
02:26:50,631 --> 02:26:55,631
Sometimes you know,
people who want to learn how to defend 

2966
02:26:55,631 --> 02:26:55,631
themselves.
People want to learn how to kill people.

2967
02:26:55,950 --> 02:27:00,950
People who are a training,
not out of some kind of recreation or 

2968
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:04,281
the enjoyment of a sport,
but actually your training because they 

2969
02:27:04,281 --> 02:27:06,150
have to daily get into fights and 
torture.

2970
02:27:06,610 --> 02:27:08,560
Well,
there was a guy that used to come to our

2971
02:27:08,561 --> 02:27:13,440
gym that legitimately was a Hitman,
was legitimately hitman for the,

2972
02:27:13,690 --> 02:27:18,170
the Irish mob in Boston and he would 
literally ask how,

2973
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:19,930
how would you kill somebody in this 
situation?

2974
02:27:19,960 --> 02:27:22,090
What would you do?
And he was a very nice guy,

2975
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:27,320
like he was very quiet and very now,
but he was almost like a guy who knew 

2976
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:30,040
some exciting shit was about to happen 
so he could stay really calm most of the

2977
02:27:30,041 --> 02:27:35,041
time until the exciting shit happen.
So like when you would train with this 

2978
02:27:35,041 --> 02:27:35,950
guy,
like I helped this guy out a little bit,

2979
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:39,790
we did some drills with them and showed 
them some stuff and he was very calm,

2980
02:27:39,791 --> 02:27:41,680
like he would never imagine this guy was
a killer.

2981
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:46,920
He was very calm and very relaxed and I 
knew sort of who he was or what he was.

2982
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:49,330
So it was really weird showing them all 
this stuff,

2983
02:27:49,970 --> 02:27:52,150
you know,
I was just trying to get them to respect

2984
02:27:52,151 --> 02:27:57,151
me and I was just trying to teach them 
the best I could and just ignore all 

2985
02:27:57,151 --> 02:27:57,640
that bullshit.
So I don't know what you do,

2986
02:27:57,730 --> 02:28:02,730
I don't want to know what you do.
I'm just going to show you this is the 

2987
02:28:02,730 --> 02:28:03,900
best way to do this shit.
And I was teaching them and fucking wind

2988
02:28:03,901 --> 02:28:08,901
up getting arrested.
He's one of them getting arrested for 

2989
02:28:08,901 --> 02:28:08,901
murder.
He's in jail for like,

2990
02:28:08,901 --> 02:28:13,051
I don't know how many years.
He was a part of that whole Whitey 

2991
02:28:13,051 --> 02:28:13,540
bulger thing and all that.
Whitey bulger Shit went down.

2992
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,130
There's a great.
Have you seen that Brad Pitt movie where

2993
02:28:17,131 --> 02:28:19,540
he plays a Hitman?
You know the one I'm talking about?

2994
02:28:20,820 --> 02:28:22,020
That's one.
James Gandolfini

2995
02:28:22,030 --> 02:28:23,490
on his last movie.
Yeah,

2996
02:28:23,530 --> 02:28:25,820
that was a killing them softly.
That's it.

2997
02:28:26,210 --> 02:28:26,780
Pretty fucking good

2998
02:28:27,380 --> 02:28:28,790
movie man.
Really good.

2999
02:28:28,791 --> 02:28:33,440
But it's sort of like it was the 
elections.

3000
02:28:33,441 --> 02:28:37,460
It was Bush versus what were the 
elections going on in the movie?

3001
02:28:37,461 --> 02:28:42,461
It was like.
It was like throughout the entire movie 

3002
02:28:42,461 --> 02:28:45,790
on Tvs.
It's playing the elections because it's 

3003
02:28:45,790 --> 02:28:48,830
trying to make this amazing comparison 
between the new mob.

3004
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:54,040
The mob have evolved or changed into a 
kind of corporate structure to the 

3005
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:59,050
United States.
Having also shifted to this corporate 

3006
02:28:59,050 --> 02:29:00,821
structure where there's this kind of 
diffusion of responsibility and Brad 

3007
02:29:00,830 --> 02:29:05,090
Pitt is sort of the embodiment of that 
kind of like diffusion of responsibility

3008
02:29:05,091 --> 02:29:10,091
because the point of pride was that the 
way he killed people was by surprise so 

3009
02:29:10,701 --> 02:29:15,701
that they didn't know that they were 
getting killed and that's a feel like 

3010
02:29:15,701 --> 02:29:16,040
that makes it any better,
you know,

3011
02:29:16,041 --> 02:29:20,060
that somehow like that's like a good 
quality to have.

3012
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:21,740
But God,
it was a great movie man,

3013
02:29:21,741 --> 02:29:24,470
but was also great because it wasn't 
just a hit man movie.

3014
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:26,450
I love the Gandolfini character.
Oh,

3015
02:29:26,670 --> 02:29:31,670
he was so awesome.
So out of control and it was just like 

3016
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:31,830
you saw them just ramp up the out of 
control.

3017
02:29:31,831 --> 02:29:33,740
He just got more and more crazy as the 
movie went on.

3018
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:34,710
I was like,
oh.

3019
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:36,960
It was like one of his best roles.
I thought,

3020
02:29:36,990 --> 02:29:41,990
let's just,
just because you really believed he was 

3021
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,450
that guy.
He looked like he was so fat.

3022
02:29:42,451 --> 02:29:44,970
He was having a hard time breathing.
You tell irritable.

3023
02:29:44,971 --> 02:29:49,971
He would be like in real life when we 
would fucking scream and spit would be 

3024
02:29:49,971 --> 02:29:51,680
flying out of his mouth and holding onto
a drink here.

3025
02:29:52,460 --> 02:29:53,340
Nailed it,
man.

3026
02:29:53,710 --> 02:29:55,220
I didn't even know he was in the fucking
movie.

3027
02:29:55,221 --> 02:30:00,221
That was just one of those movies where 
a friend said it's good and I was just 

3028
02:30:00,221 --> 02:30:00,221
like laying in bed watching Netflix.
It's like,

3029
02:30:00,221 --> 02:30:01,790
God damn,
this is a good movie.

3030
02:30:01,950 --> 02:30:06,950
James Gandolfini was a bad motherfucker 
that Tony Soprano character was the 

3031
02:30:07,591 --> 02:30:09,180
greatest,
in my opinion,

3032
02:30:09,181 --> 02:30:12,090
the greatest individual character in any
show ever.

3033
02:30:13,230 --> 02:30:14,100
Yeah,
I think you're right,

3034
02:30:14,101 --> 02:30:15,000
man.
I think he was,

3035
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:19,830
if not the greatest.
I mean it's maybe there's an equal level

3036
02:30:19,890 --> 02:30:24,210
that they all reach at some someplace,
but that was like right up there.

3037
02:30:25,050 --> 02:30:25,800
Yeah,
he was a.

3038
02:30:25,801 --> 02:30:30,060
He was a bad ass like Kim and Rhoda,
like right there.

3039
02:30:30,330 --> 02:30:31,380
And who?
Rhoda?

3040
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:32,730
Mary Tyler Moore's friend.

3041
02:30:34,710 --> 02:30:38,470
Weird.
I thought you were talking about.

3042
02:30:40,850 --> 02:30:45,850
I Love Lucy grace under fire and 
Japanese Godzilla Monster.

3043
02:30:49,010 --> 02:30:50,400
Sounds like your dad.
No.

3044
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:52,920
Rodin Rodin.
Yeah.

3045
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:54,770
I was just trying to think.
It was silly character.

3046
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:56,990
Lou Grant,
him and Lou Grant.

3047
02:30:56,991 --> 02:31:01,310
No Man wrote her character.
Always creeped me out.

3048
02:31:01,670 --> 02:31:02,470
Ricky Schroder.
No,

3049
02:31:02,471 --> 02:31:03,290
no.
So we're spoons.

3050
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:05,720
When know the guy that was like,
he's fucking podcast,

3051
02:31:05,721 --> 02:31:06,320
Bro.
Be Nice.

3052
02:31:06,590 --> 02:31:11,590
The guy that always wear denim jackets 
and he used to be like the the the 

3053
02:31:11,590 --> 02:31:14,830
maintenance guy for a.
was it Mary Tyler Moore or.

3054
02:31:16,810 --> 02:31:19,950
Oh,
I know you're talking about God dammit.

3055
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,320
Not Schroeder.
What the fuck was his name?

3056
02:31:22,890 --> 02:31:26,530
Schrodinger's cat.
No,

3057
02:31:26,550 --> 02:31:27,720
that was the.
And Shirley.

3058
02:31:28,110 --> 02:31:33,110
Yeah,
there was the guy on the show where the 

3059
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:33,110
girl got super addicted to drugs,
right?

3060
02:31:33,650 --> 02:31:34,830
No.
One day at a time.

3061
02:31:34,831 --> 02:31:36,180
One day at a time.
One day at a time.

3062
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:38,370
What was the dude's name?
From one day at a time.

3063
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:44,540
One day at a time.
Isn't it weird that you can like almost 

3064
02:31:44,540 --> 02:31:47,931
any sitcom from back in the day?
You can move it on up to the side.

3065
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:53,180
You can just sing the song.
You know the song to a de Luxe apartment

3066
02:31:53,290 --> 02:31:58,290
in the sky or what's his name?
The guy ever find out his name.

3067
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:04,100
That guy is creepy.
Have you seen the too many cooks thing 

3068
02:32:04,100 --> 02:32:04,100
yet?

3069
02:32:04,100 --> 02:32:04,460
No.
No.

3070
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:05,810
I keep hearing about it.
I'm scared.

3071
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:06,570
I'm scared.
Me Too.

3072
02:32:06,571 --> 02:32:07,770
Awesome.
Pretty awesome.

3073
02:32:07,790 --> 02:32:09,630
Scared to be too awesome and take up all
my time.

3074
02:32:09,660 --> 02:32:12,460
What was his name?
I'm still trying to find it.

3075
02:32:13,890 --> 02:32:16,230
Freddie Mercury.
There was always those guys.

3076
02:32:16,410 --> 02:32:19,410
Were you a schneider?
Schneider.

3077
02:32:19,880 --> 02:32:21,930
That was his name.
Arrington Junior.

3078
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:23,550
Schneider.
Schneider.

3079
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:28,580
Wow.
There was always those guys that were 

3080
02:32:28,580 --> 02:32:28,580
like the guys who worked in the 
building.

3081
02:32:28,580 --> 02:32:30,890
Where you lived or Carmen Ragusa.
Didn't he work?

3082
02:32:31,830 --> 02:32:34,860
Do work at the plant with Laverne and 
Shirley.

3083
02:32:39,690 --> 02:32:40,990
Oh my God.
I forgot about

3084
02:32:41,310 --> 02:32:46,310
squeaky dude.
I met Epstein from welcome back Kotter 

3085
02:32:46,310 --> 02:32:46,310
once.
Now.

3086
02:32:46,310 --> 02:32:46,310
Shit.
Yeah,

3087
02:32:46,310 --> 02:32:46,680
Epstein from.
Welcome back.

3088
02:32:46,681 --> 02:32:48,840
Kotter was on news radio.
He played my brother,

3089
02:32:49,470 --> 02:32:54,470
him and Nick Depalo and Brian Cowen.
We all played brothers and he was the 

3090
02:32:54,470 --> 02:32:59,151
regulator came in with a baseball bat 
and beat the shit out of all of this is 

3091
02:32:59,151 --> 02:33:01,920
back when you could do that shit on TV.
Can you beat people up on TV anymore?

3092
02:33:01,921 --> 02:33:02,520
Is it allowed?

3093
02:33:02,850 --> 02:33:04,440
Yeah.
What do you mean for?

3094
02:33:04,980 --> 02:33:05,640
Yeah,
you can.

3095
02:33:05,641 --> 02:33:06,870
I think you fuck.
Yeah,

3096
02:33:06,871 --> 02:33:11,871
look at the.
I guess the walking dead doesn't count 

3097
02:33:11,871 --> 02:33:11,871
as a same.
Does it not count as a kid?

3098
02:33:11,871 --> 02:33:14,220
What the fuck man,
this year is so horrifically violent.

3099
02:33:14,221 --> 02:33:16,450
Exactly the way it's supposed to be.
God,

3100
02:33:16,550 --> 02:33:19,260
that's what the comics are like.
That's what it was like.

3101
02:33:19,261 --> 02:33:23,040
That's what it is.
That's exactly why the comics are so bad

3102
02:33:23,041 --> 02:33:28,041
ass because they're at this season is 
finally hitting the pitch that the 

3103
02:33:29,101 --> 02:33:34,101
comics hit,
which is just extraordinary violence in 

3104
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:35,910
insane.
Hopelessness.

3105
02:33:35,950 --> 02:33:38,100
Exactly what it would be.
It's so bad ass.

3106
02:33:38,130 --> 02:33:40,050
That's why the comics were good.
Yeah,

3107
02:33:40,051 --> 02:33:42,880
and that's the only way a show really 
works is it?

3108
02:33:42,881 --> 02:33:47,881
God,
it has to continually ramp it up and 

3109
02:33:47,881 --> 02:33:47,881
outdo itself.
It's like religion.

3110
02:33:48,810 --> 02:33:53,810
Religion say stayed and static.
It can't change because of either does 

3111
02:33:53,810 --> 02:33:55,320
that or it falls off and jumps the 
shark.

3112
02:33:55,360 --> 02:33:56,310
Yeah.
Those are the two.

3113
02:33:56,350 --> 02:33:59,460
Like it goes dexter or it goes walking 
dead.

3114
02:34:00,510 --> 02:34:01,770
Yeah.
Oh God.

3115
02:34:01,771 --> 02:34:03,000
Dexter's shirts.
Fuck.

3116
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:05,490
Jumped the shark.
God started off so good.

3117
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:06,360
Oh,
so sad.

3118
02:34:06,361 --> 02:34:11,361
I just.
I just started watching an episode of 

3119
02:34:11,361 --> 02:34:13,350
Dexter on a plane and I was so saddened 
by what.

3120
02:34:13,410 --> 02:34:15,540
What happened.
They gave up.

3121
02:34:15,870 --> 02:34:18,250
They gave up and phoned it in something

3122
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:22,540
happened or they ran out of juice or 
someone could be some political things.

3123
02:34:22,541 --> 02:34:24,190
Some people got involved that shouldn't 
have gotten involved.

3124
02:34:24,191 --> 02:34:26,710
Like some guy,
like maybe he was a producer for coach.

3125
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:30,370
Remember that show the fucking Sitcom 
from this guy.

3126
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:31,880
He's.
Yeah.

3127
02:34:32,010 --> 02:34:35,520
He was underrated.
Waves was not a bad show.

3128
02:34:36,110 --> 02:34:38,350
Imitating Church was fucking hilarious.
On wings.

3129
02:34:38,370 --> 02:34:39,670
Yeah,
that guy was great.

3130
02:34:40,030 --> 02:34:41,320
That guy's a great actor,
man.

3131
02:34:41,321 --> 02:34:43,690
He's a creepy actor.
Like he pulls off some shit.

3132
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:47,170
I interviewed him once for later on NBC,
you know,

3133
02:34:47,171 --> 02:34:49,600
one of those shows later.
He's a fucking great guy.

3134
02:34:49,601 --> 02:34:54,601
Like he was really cool,
like we had like a total normal 

3135
02:34:54,601 --> 02:34:54,601
conversation.
Like he was like a regular dude.

3136
02:34:54,601 --> 02:34:56,380
It's always super nice when you meet 
another guy.

3137
02:34:56,381 --> 02:34:58,570
I was on a Sitcom and it was a fucking 
regular guy.

3138
02:34:58,990 --> 02:35:02,860
Chris Hardwick is really nice.
Like I did Chris Hardwick's podcast last

3139
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:02,860
night.

3140
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:04,720
Half fucking great conversation with 
them.

3141
02:35:04,930 --> 02:35:06,250
Like the longest I've ever talked to 
them.

3142
02:35:06,251 --> 02:35:07,120
I've only seen him like,
hey,

3143
02:35:07,121 --> 02:35:08,110
what's up man?
How you doing?

3144
02:35:08,111 --> 02:35:10,240
What's going on?
And I've listened to his podcast,

3145
02:35:10,241 --> 02:35:13,300
but the first like real conversation,
I had to sit down with them.

3146
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:16,090
So fucking really nice guy.
Like a really nice guy.

3147
02:35:16,091 --> 02:35:17,540
Really Smart Guy.
Good worker.

3148
02:35:17,770 --> 02:35:18,450
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.

3149
02:35:18,550 --> 02:35:21,100
How many shows is he on?
He has a million show.

3150
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:23,680
He's on more shows than anyone's ever 
been on.

3151
02:35:23,681 --> 02:35:25,210
I bet.
But my point being,

3152
02:35:25,630 --> 02:35:27,640
he's a normal dude.
Like you meet him.

3153
02:35:27,670 --> 02:35:29,470
He's totally normal.
You know what I mean?

3154
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:30,450
Like you'd meet them.
There's no.

3155
02:35:30,610 --> 02:35:32,830
There's no weirdness.
Thank God man.

3156
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:36,490
That's always such a depressing mind.
Fuck.

3157
02:35:36,491 --> 02:35:41,491
When you run into somebody who's got 
success and they're assholes because it 

3158
02:35:41,651 --> 02:35:46,651
seems to disrupt the principles you've 
come to understand that allows success 

3159
02:35:46,651 --> 02:35:50,140
to grow into your life,
which is being sweet and generally being

3160
02:35:50,141 --> 02:35:50,710
a giver.

3161
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:54,190
It's such a weird thing when you.
When you and it's a rare creature.

3162
02:35:54,340 --> 02:35:56,770
Well,
some people are so fucking talented that

3163
02:35:56,771 --> 02:35:59,230
it's almost like you'll let them get 
away with some crazy shit.

3164
02:35:59,231 --> 02:36:01,840
Like I've never heard James Gandolfini 
was an asshole.

3165
02:36:02,060 --> 02:36:03,760
I never heard her say anything other 
than Nice Guy,

3166
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:06,190
but he was obviously completely out of 
control.

3167
02:36:06,490 --> 02:36:09,160
Who's obviously doing blow and he was 
drinking,

3168
02:36:09,161 --> 02:36:11,890
he was,
they found his body had blown his body.

3169
02:36:11,891 --> 02:36:12,720
I mean,
look,

3170
02:36:12,940 --> 02:36:16,120
you don't get that big unless you're 
just fucking going off like a rocket,

3171
02:36:16,380 --> 02:36:17,530
you know,
he was wild.

3172
02:36:17,531 --> 02:36:21,040
He was in a Buddhist who wasn't doing 
yoga while I was eating Kale.

3173
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:26,280
He was a wild motherfucker and the only 
way you get a wild motherfucker like 

3174
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:30,061
that that you can enjoy and those crazy 
fucking movies in that role is if he's 

3175
02:36:30,061 --> 02:36:30,550
living like that,
you know,

3176
02:36:30,551 --> 02:36:35,380
and it manifests itself in this art is 
art becomes this wild explosive,

3177
02:36:35,470 --> 02:36:40,470
spit sprang yo fuck a piece of shit and 
just sat and read this fucking no hair 

3178
02:36:41,891 --> 02:36:44,620
and,
and that's that guy.

3179
02:36:44,621 --> 02:36:47,680
You have to,
you have to be that guy to do that.

3180
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:49,690
And it's like,
it's beautiful.

3181
02:36:49,691 --> 02:36:50,800
They're growing again.
Gandel,

3182
02:36:50,801 --> 02:36:55,801
delphine plant.
You've got a wire with coke and fucking 

3183
02:36:55,801 --> 02:36:56,350
chicken wings.

3184
02:36:59,130 --> 02:37:02,710
Got The fucking place you got to give 
them.

3185
02:37:02,770 --> 02:37:05,560
I was in a,
a restaurant once in little Italy before

3186
02:37:05,561 --> 02:37:07,930
he died and not short.
Not long before he died either.

3187
02:37:08,770 --> 02:37:13,770
When he came,
he came walking in and I wished I was 

3188
02:37:13,770 --> 02:37:13,770
famous enough to go say hi,
you know,

3189
02:37:13,770 --> 02:37:18,570
I wish I was like,
if I was Brad Pitt I would go over and 

3190
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:18,570
say hi

3191
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:18,570
to James again a feet,
but I don't want to be annoying man.

3192
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:20,040
And he probably doesn't know who the 
fuck I am.

3193
02:37:20,041 --> 02:37:22,370
You probably doesn't watch the UFC or 
fear factor,

3194
02:37:22,380 --> 02:37:24,380
any of that stupid shit.
So I didn't want to say hi,

3195
02:37:24,381 --> 02:37:27,230
but like anybody that I would want to 
say hi to.

3196
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:29,900
He was like right up there and then 
after he died I was like,

3197
02:37:29,930 --> 02:37:30,720
shit,
Shit.

3198
02:37:30,730 --> 02:37:32,360
I said,
I could've just said hi.

3199
02:37:32,670 --> 02:37:35,240
She said Hi.
You have anyone know him though?

3200
02:37:35,610 --> 02:37:40,610
You know,
it just seemed like a douchebag move to 

3201
02:37:40,610 --> 02:37:40,610
gold or someone's table.
I was like,

3202
02:37:40,610 --> 02:37:43,241
maybe if I can catch them,
like if I'm leaving and he's leaving 

3203
02:37:43,241 --> 02:37:43,241
synchronicity and he's right there.
Yeah.

3204
02:37:43,241 --> 02:37:45,380
What if for whatever reason you 
interrupt,

3205
02:37:45,381 --> 02:37:50,381
they're really nice bite of whatever 
he's eating and you trigger the heart 

3206
02:37:50,381 --> 02:37:54,071
attack and everyone from now on talks 
about Joe Rogan killed James Gandolfini 

3207
02:37:54,071 --> 02:37:55,310
and everyone's like,
what did he say to him?

3208
02:37:55,730 --> 02:37:57,080
What did he say?
Do you know?

3209
02:37:57,081 --> 02:38:01,180
That's why I didn't yell at Buddy 
Hackett to know that.

3210
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:06,270
No,
but it was screaming at me and I never 

3211
02:38:06,270 --> 02:38:06,270
raised my voice.
We were on last comic standing.

3212
02:38:06,270 --> 02:38:07,670
This dude was.
I was one of the judges.

3213
02:38:07,671 --> 02:38:09,320
Buddy Hackett was a judge in monique was
a judge,

3214
02:38:10,020 --> 02:38:11,510
so it was really funny.
I won't say his name,

3215
02:38:11,960 --> 02:38:13,490
it's really funny,
but he was stealing jokes.

3216
02:38:13,540 --> 02:38:16,430
It's just like.
And I said all nice things first.

3217
02:38:16,700 --> 02:38:18,110
I said,
you performance is awesome.

3218
02:38:18,120 --> 02:38:21,380
You're like got really,
really funny and a lot of energy,

3219
02:38:21,800 --> 02:38:24,620
but I've heard those trucks before and 
one of them was actually from a movie,

3220
02:38:24,621 --> 02:38:29,621
the movie boiler room.
The joke was they should put people on 

3221
02:38:29,621 --> 02:38:33,481
an island.
Someone says that to a gay guy who 

3222
02:38:33,481 --> 02:38:33,481
should put your people on an island.
He goes,

3223
02:38:33,481 --> 02:38:33,530
they did.
It's called Manhattan.

3224
02:38:34,090 --> 02:38:35,540
It's pretty funny.
It's a good line.

3225
02:38:35,740 --> 02:38:40,740
This guy did that in this fucking thing 
on tv and you have to,

3226
02:38:41,210 --> 02:38:44,150
you have to call that out.
So I tried to do it in a nice way to say

3227
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:47,630
nice things first and then say,
but I've seen those jokes before,

3228
02:38:47,631 --> 02:38:48,680
like,
don't do that man.

3229
02:38:48,710 --> 02:38:50,180
And I have to say that I can't just let 
it pop.

3230
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:53,570
And then monique was saying Shit like,
Oh,

3231
02:38:53,571 --> 02:38:55,670
you made it yours.
You made it yours.

3232
02:38:55,700 --> 02:38:56,860
You know,
that might've been something that you've

3233
02:38:56,861 --> 02:38:58,700
made it.
And then Buddy Hackett starts yelling at

3234
02:38:58,701 --> 02:39:03,701
me,
you'll fucking what the fuck?

3235
02:39:04,420 --> 02:39:07,310
He's screaming at me because all those 
catskills guys,

3236
02:39:07,370 --> 02:39:09,590
now God rest his soul.
All it's catskills guys.

3237
02:39:09,591 --> 02:39:11,690
A lot of them,
they shared material so like they didn't

3238
02:39:11,691 --> 02:39:14,360
think about joke writing.
The way we think of as joke writing,

3239
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:15,560
it was like,
you know,

3240
02:39:15,561 --> 02:39:16,310
you had an act.

3241
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:18,140
You went on the road,
most likely those people are never going

3242
02:39:18,141 --> 02:39:23,141
to see you again.
You go from place to place to place and 

3243
02:39:23,141 --> 02:39:23,141
if you ever get famous and put that shit
on tv,

3244
02:39:23,141 --> 02:39:24,020
on the Ed Sullivan show,
that's yours.

3245
02:39:24,021 --> 02:39:25,970
You know,
he did it on the Ed Sullivan show,

3246
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,040
what are you going to do?
You know,

3247
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:32,170
when they all would like struggle for it
didn't become the art form that it is 

3248
02:39:32,170 --> 02:39:35,120
now until like the Lenny Bruce had 
Richard Pryor error where it became this

3249
02:39:35,121 --> 02:39:40,121
new thing.
So it's almost like what he's talking 

3250
02:39:40,121 --> 02:39:40,121
about as far as comedy and when I'm 
talking about comedy,

3251
02:39:40,121 --> 02:39:44,681
is there a totally different thing he's 
talking about being a band for Bar 

3252
02:39:44,681 --> 02:39:46,550
Mitzvahs and do it all with all due 
respect,

3253
02:39:46,610 --> 02:39:48,100
showing up in these,
you know,

3254
02:39:48,150 --> 02:39:53,150
these halls where you're going to have a
music band and a guy tells jokes and 

3255
02:39:53,150 --> 02:39:54,100
then Sinatra is gonna come out and play 
and he,

3256
02:39:54,101 --> 02:39:59,101
you know,
it's not a comedy club and the art form 

3257
02:39:59,101 --> 02:39:59,101
was not established way.
It's established now.

3258
02:39:59,101 --> 02:40:00,350
It's,
it's a different experience for them.

3259
02:40:00,650 --> 02:40:04,700
So I'm defining his experience in a way 
that challenges his entire career.

3260
02:40:04,730 --> 02:40:06,020
He's like,
fuck you kid.

3261
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:07,760
You know he's right.
He's right.

3262
02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:09,020
You know,
in his world,

3263
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:13,980
in the world that he evolved in,
in know that cat style comedy,

3264
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:15,960
they all used each other shit.
You know,

3265
02:40:15,961 --> 02:40:17,970
they all did that.
They all would come up with jokes.

3266
02:40:17,971 --> 02:40:18,990
They were,
remember those jokes,

3267
02:40:18,991 --> 02:40:21,390
they would write a few things down or 
make a few observations,

3268
02:40:21,610 --> 02:40:24,000
do a little crowd work,
but they all like,

3269
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:28,690
there was a really common thing for like
high level guys to have joke jokes.

3270
02:40:29,260 --> 02:40:32,100
I've heard that.
It's weird that he decided to go on last

3271
02:40:32,101 --> 02:40:33,480
comic standing.
Well,

3272
02:40:33,481 --> 02:40:34,860
you know,
he so loved guy,

3273
02:40:34,861 --> 02:40:35,580
you know,
he was.

3274
02:40:35,581 --> 02:40:38,190
Everybody was praising them and you 
know,

3275
02:40:38,191 --> 02:40:40,220
he's a legend comedy ledge,
but ain't screaming at you.

3276
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:44,340
You fucking call you and I just go.
I am not yelling.

3277
02:40:44,490 --> 02:40:47,930
But Buddy Hackett,
thank God he died.

3278
02:40:48,420 --> 02:40:50,340
He died two weeks later,
dude.

3279
02:40:50,410 --> 02:40:51,720
Uh,
the most.

3280
02:40:51,721 --> 02:40:53,340
It was like a month or something like 
that.

3281
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:58,640
I mean,
it was really recent to the point where 

3282
02:40:58,640 --> 02:40:58,640
I was like,
yeah,

3283
02:40:58,640 --> 02:40:58,640
you gotta.

3284
02:40:58,640 --> 02:41:00,060
Be careful man.
I'm an idiot too.

3285
02:41:00,270 --> 02:41:01,470
You know,
when people yell at me,

3286
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:05,150
especially when I was young,
my automatic instinct was to fuck you,

3287
02:41:05,180 --> 02:41:06,810
like to yell back,
you know,

3288
02:41:06,811 --> 02:41:11,811
the whatever echoes of my youth would 
reverberate my adulthood where I'm 

3289
02:41:11,811 --> 02:41:14,100
supposed to be rational.
A lot of times it skip the tracks.

3290
02:41:14,340 --> 02:41:17,200
A lot of times it fucking went off the 
road and into the woods.

3291
02:41:17,201 --> 02:41:19,350
Like I would do things that I didn't 
want to be doing.

3292
02:41:20,110 --> 02:41:25,110
Keep punching.
Prank county by county lets me getting 

3293
02:41:25,110 --> 02:41:28,491
them a good team in Nick Depalo to Nick 
Dipaolo came and scared both of us and 

3294
02:41:30,031 --> 02:41:32,610
then our other brother Epstein came in,
scared him.

3295
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:34,620
He had a baseball bat and he was a 
priest.

3296
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:40,750
The podcasts over.
I'm going to go to Adam Carolla's where 

3297
02:41:40,750 --> 02:41:43,740
you are dealing January second in Las 
Vegas,

3298
02:41:43,770 --> 02:41:45,840
Nevada.
Duncan Trussell,

3299
02:41:45,930 --> 02:41:49,500
Ari Shaffir,
Joey Diaz and why?

3300
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:51,030
And we're all of us.

3301
02:41:51,100 --> 02:41:52,730
That's going to be a fuck.
Yeah.

3302
02:41:52,740 --> 02:41:54,180
It's going to be so fun.
God.

3303
02:41:54,181 --> 02:41:55,200
Damn.
That's going to be fun.

3304
02:41:55,201 --> 02:41:56,090
I was trying to,
you know,

3305
02:41:56,150 --> 02:41:58,770
to figure out like,
I don't think we've ever done a show.

3306
02:41:58,890 --> 02:42:00,000
All of us like this.
Nope.

3307
02:42:00,390 --> 02:42:05,390
When was the last time we did like maybe
the store like the all of us working on 

3308
02:42:05,390 --> 02:42:06,810
a night like this.
We're all four of us together.

3309
02:42:06,870 --> 02:42:08,970
I don't think we ever did it.
I don't think it ever happened.

3310
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:12,520
It was always either und as are you and 
rap or r and D is,

3311
02:42:12,660 --> 02:42:15,060
but this is a crazy thought.
That combination.

3312
02:42:15,450 --> 02:42:17,820
So crazy combination.
I'm so looking forward to that.

3313
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:19,370
Right.
After new years,

3314
02:42:19,790 --> 02:42:22,100
what are you doing for new years?
You got a Gig for new years?

3315
02:42:22,500 --> 02:42:23,440
No,
I don't know.

3316
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:25,410
Do you want to do one?
I don't know.

3317
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:27,960
I don't like going out on New Year.
Let's talk.

3318
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:30,690
Let's talk.
I don't like going out on New Year's.

3319
02:42:30,900 --> 02:42:31,680
Done.
Don't do it.

3320
02:42:31,681 --> 02:42:35,100
Then can talk him into it.
I'm not talking about fucking bill cosby

3321
02:42:35,720 --> 02:42:37,530
for somebody.
I feel guilty.

3322
02:42:37,531 --> 02:42:39,600
It makes it a drink and calls it a bill 
cosby.

3323
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:42,960
Has that happened already?
It's already happened.

3324
02:42:43,030 --> 02:42:44,310
What's the drink?
What's in it?

3325
02:42:44,810 --> 02:42:47,220
Ruthie's yourself.

3326
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:54,150
It's called the Jello pudding.
Hallmark calls it.

3327
02:42:54,210 --> 02:42:54,900
No,
you can't say that.

3328
02:42:54,901 --> 02:42:56,790
They'll sue you don't call the Jello 
pudding.

3329
02:42:56,850 --> 02:42:58,950
I don't know what any of this is about.
I don't either.

3330
02:42:59,190 --> 02:43:00,630
Hey Duncan.
You're awesome.

3331
02:43:00,750 --> 02:43:01,800
You're awesome too.
Joe.

3332
02:43:01,830 --> 02:43:04,170
We actually did one a month.
We did yours last month.

3333
02:43:04,171 --> 02:43:05,310
We did this one.
This pulling it out.

3334
02:43:05,330 --> 02:43:06,810
We're actually doing it.
We do it.

3335
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:11,840
We keep saying we're going to do it and 
people get really mad at us when we 

3336
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:11,840
don't do it,
but we did it this time and I'm going to

3337
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:11,980
do yours next month.
Okay.

3338
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:13,150
Thank you joe.
That's beautiful.

3339
02:43:13,620 --> 02:43:16,130
It make it happen.
I love talking to you brother,

3340
