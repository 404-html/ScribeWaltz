1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,710
So this weekend I'm in Philadelphia,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,161
right?

4
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:07,500
We're there for the UFC
and I'm with my boy,

5
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,240
Tommy Jr and his girl Katie.

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,540
And we get high as Jesus on the
fucking space shuttle we got,

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,820
we got down Joe Diaz,

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,730
we went deep.

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,020
We just kept smoking.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,110
You've got to break up the gate.

11
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:22,321
We'd,

12
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,020
when I come up here,

13
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,700
Doug,

14
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,533
what are you talking about?

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,340
Don't do shit to me.

16
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,230
If you make me drive 40 minutes up,

17
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:29,520
you've got to get me stolen bro.

18
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,331
That's us.

19
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:30,511
What?

20
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:30,961
Hannah weed.

21
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,160
I've been telling you about that shit.

22
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:32,610
Yeah,

23
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,440
you brought that shit to
the ice house to that shit.

24
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,540
Don't do nothing to you
and you're so crazy.

25
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:36,930
It's true.

26
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,820
Need to go to a doctor.

27
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,693
Fuck dog.

28
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,710
When you talk to your dog.

29
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,370
He had a good week dog.

30
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,290
Enough is enough with this Shelly.

31
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,820
It's the best round like Jack.

32
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,510
The rest you can buy.

33
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,540
We know it's not looking
at my fucking eyes bro.

34
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,540
I look high to you guy

35
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,861
cause I smoke.

36
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:55,500
I'm away.

37
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,930
Cause I knew you were going to give
me that slash four fucking weed.

38
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,970
You better start getting
some good fucking,

39
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:01,550
we'd go hand in my 10 a week.

40
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,370
Give me a second time and a fucking rock.

41
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:05,941
Dude.

42
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:09,270
You just bang wreck and was garbage.

43
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:11,640
They sold you on it and my eyes so

44
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,230

45
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,850
I love you too.

46
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,251
I love you.

47
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,240
Got to go to a doctor.

48
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,730
Damn bad ass shit.

49
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,450
The fuck are you smoked and look at me.

50
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,691
What?

51
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:25,524
Broken?

52
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,640
Fucking broken.

53
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,473
He hit me with this.

54
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,740
Let's do this bro.

55
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,023
Motherfucker.

56
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,630
How high are you right now,

57
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,853

58
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:36,930
Fuck.

59
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,763
Look at him.

60
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,390
[inaudible] ambulance.

61
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,170
The biggest thing was that
it was a tightly rolled joint

62
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,930
power hits where he's just fuels
and as long as you are you like big.

63
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,350
No,

64
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,690
I couldn't get a hit off of
it was too fucking tight.

65
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,450
Fucking screaming at
America listening to no,

66
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,480
fuck that you're high and
you give me that stuff.

67
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,660
You know I love you to death,

68
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:05,250
but you got to pack the 18th punked.

69
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,671
Joey.

70
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,100
Jesus fucking Christ love people
who are listening to this.

71
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:09,540
You understand that this is entertainment.

72
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,270
I know all you're doing is
complaining about not complaining.

73
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:14,970
I'm just saying that I want to
get high when I'm not complaining.

74
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,740
Listen to what you're
doing that's complaining.

75
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,570
You invite me to your home
and you give me this sucks.

76
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:18,721

77
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,540

79
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,291
Hannah?

80
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:22,501

81
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:22,770

82
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,000

83
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,050

85
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:25,920

86
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,850
Costello is cheap.

87
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:27,684
Fucking ass.

88
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,270
Fucking planet.

89
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:32,280
Are you from fucking smoking?

90
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,990
I should've shut the fuck up.

91
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:34,171
Well,

92
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:34,380
you,

93
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,350
I'm talking about the Goddamn
thing I did this weekend.

94
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,000
You were talking about that
shit with you just sparked.

95
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,700
You are so fucked up.

96
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,111
Fuck.

97
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:43,790
Look at my eyes.

98
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,500
Yeah,

99
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,000
that's what it is.

100
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,400
It's not that you weighed 300 pounds
and he smoked pot all day every day.

101
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,323
That's what

102
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,163
fucking do it.

103
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,901
It's not sad.

104
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,730
It's the physical size of your body.

105
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,361
Shitty.

106
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,560
Fucking weak or you're crazy.

107
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,233
Yeah.

108
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,540
I go to other stores.

109
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,040
I go to other stores.

110
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,090
The fuck out of you.

111
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:07,390
That's the second time on wine.

112
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,410
Love complaining.

113
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,533
Whining and complaining.

114
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,860
He's so Brodie.

115
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,460
You're so burns.

116
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,230
This is Joey [inaudible].

117
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:14,831

118
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,030

119
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:16,271
man.

120
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:17,650
This is a God damn podcast.

121
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:20,150
You've been complaining for
five fucking minutes about weed.

122
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:21,510
You're telling me that what slash why?

123
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:21,761
Hannah?

124
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,160
You know what?

125
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,810
That's what happens.

126
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,060
I don't know what Sasquatch squat.

127
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,903
Han Is.

128
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,700
No more fuck fucking late
night podcast with Joe.

129
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,043
No more.

130
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,681
No more.

131
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,970
You can't have a dog.

132
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:31,451
I have just saying.

133
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:32,261
I love you too,

134
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:36,700
but there's 2000 people listening
right now by hundreds of thousands of

135
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:39,580
listening online and all you're doing
is complaining about weed for five

136
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,414
minutes.

137
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,420
Yeah,

138
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,290
that might have been ruined.

139
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,780
Really been a big fan of her youtube
to shut the fuck up about this thing.

140
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:48,250
I've got to tell you about Philadelphia.

141
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,810
Fuck God dammit.

142
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,120
You try to change the subject
after he beats me down.

143
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,650
I was just trying to
calm him down for a sec.

144
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,660
Don't talk about we dog dot around me,

145
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,260

Yeah.

150
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:06,700
We're in Philadelphia.

151
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,760
Cheer up fucking human being.
