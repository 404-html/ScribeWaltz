00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,580
Hello Freak bitches.
That's right.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,970
We're back and this episode,
once again,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,170
is brought to you by Squarespace. If you
have a company, if you have a business,

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:14,260
if you are a business,

5
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:18,870
say if you're an entertainer or maybe
an artist and you have something you'd

6
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:23,280
like to let the world know about it,
there is no better way to do it.

7
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:27,180
Then with your own website and for the
longest time that was a pain in the Dick.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,880
You had to go find someone that you could
reliably count on to make you a nice

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,930
website and they they put didn't put
weird backdoors in it with a good sneak

10
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:41,931
Dick pics and all your photographs or
fuck with you and take too much time and

11
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,290
cost you too much money and
were were were, were, were.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,670
When you rely on people, it's great when
it works out, it's awesome when you,

13
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:51,810
when you find someone like,
Oh,

14
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:55,710
I found this guy and he's great with
websites and he's my friend. Yay,

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,090
it's awesome.
It's fun,

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,040
but when it's a pain in the ass and
when it's not going well, you go, God,

17
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,560
I wish I could do this
myself. Well, yeah, it can.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,290
Now today with Squarespace,

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,460
any moron like myself
could create a website,

20
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,560
a real professional looking website.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,980
Brian is making a website
right now and he's,

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,690
he's done 30 of them, 40 of them. Why?

23
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,030
We've been doing Squarespace ads
every week while we do commercial.

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,110
Brian puts together a website.
It's that fucking easy. Hey,

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,430
just made a t shirt for Tony.

26
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:31,680
You didn't even have a tee shirt
builder where you can sit in there.

27
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,450
They have a logo builder, you could
design your own custom logos very easily.

28
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:40,800
All this is drag and drop type interface,
so it's all like,

29
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,780
same thing you would do if you were
you like if you can add pictures to an

30
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,640
email,
you can figure out how to do this.

31
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,670
It's not hard to do and you can make an
outstanding professional website with 24

32
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:57,420
seven support. If you fucking
your middle and my website suck,

33
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,620
like you figure this out,

34
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,420
you can get ahold of Squarespace and
they'll hook you up. Squarespace.

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,590
Simple and easy design.

36
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,170
They have platforms at work or it
works rather on every platform.

37
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,100
It'll work on iPad to work on
android and a work on windows.

38
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,210
It'll work on Unix.

39
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,420
Squarespace can help you design your
own website where you can like have an

40
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:24,180
immediate professional
website with a store.

41
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,830
Easy to put together an online store,
easy to sell digital downloads.

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,730
Say if the Golden Pony, Tony
Hinchcliffe decides to start pop music.

43
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:36,270
And I think you could, I think it could
be one of those Dj's like at a rave,

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,030
like pumping your fist dead mouse style.

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,300
That could be you in another life.
Anyway,

46
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,100

47
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,160

50
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,350
A better web starts with your
website. That's Hilarious, isn't it?

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,960
A better web starts.
How about saying nothing?

52
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,050
And it's better than a better web starts
with your own website because you can't

53
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,240
do that. This is the Internet,
right? This is in fucking Nabisco.

54
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,390
A better web starts with your website.

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,160
That's amazing because that's already
better than my actual website and I just

56
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:24,880
watched you make it intense seconds
and it's better than my tee shirt.

57
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,870
That's incredible. The ones that we
judged, we had a Squarespace condos.

58
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,320
It's like end of the year contest.
They develop some killer fucking website.

59
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,250
I still visit that. Uh, there's
a storm website that uh,

60
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,540
I don't remember the URL,

61
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,410
but the sky like took all these crazy
photographs of nutty cloud formations and

62
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,270
storms coming. Oh, it's awesome.

63
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,350
And it looks like he paid
a fucking fortune to make
this website and did it all

64
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:50,590
himself or herself. I don't know
if it's a guy or Gal. Uh, anyway,

65

69
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:07,090

72
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,250
we're also brought to you by ting.

73
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,430
Ting is a cell phone company that does
things in a way that I think is the

74
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:24,910
future tings. A website where
you can go there. First of all,

75
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,570
if you, if you look at like the,
the big cell phone providers,

76
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:32,500
whether it's a sprint or whether
it's a Verizon or at, and, t,

77
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,010
one of the things that bothers people
is early termination fees like can get

78
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:42,120
getting hooked into a contract.
The reason why you do that and uh,

79
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,320
it's very convenient for,
you know,

80
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:48,670
for most of us because what they're doing
is instead of paying the full amount

81
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,504
for a cell phone,

82
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,510
usually like it says it's two 99 but
60 99 if you want to buy it on its own.

83
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,700
Yeah, that's, that's the
different thing that to 99,

84
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,270
when you buy it with like a two year
contract, if you break that contract,

85
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,123
you have to pay that money.

86
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,070
What you're doing sort of deferring that
money over a long period of time and if

87
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:08,980
you want to get out, he can't
get out. You're like, Shit. Um,

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,340
ting has it so you can get out of
anytime you want. You buy the phone,

89
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:15,220
you own the phone, they sell the
best android phones you can buy,

90
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,870
including the Samsung Galaxy note
three, which I have. It's awesome phone.

91
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,140
So the really cool, you can write on
it. It's got a little stylus and shit.

92
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:27,430
The images are gigantic for going on
the web. It's fucking unparalleled.

93
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,660
There's nothing like it.

94
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,040
Like an iPhone is great for usability
and you can bring your iPhones also,

95
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,930
um, from sprint and they can pour them to
tank and then they sell the iPhone five

96
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,760
for 260 bucks. You can actually buy
it for 260 bucks and then it's yours.

97
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,910
You own that shit son. No contract. Yeah.

98
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,940
And the way 10 uses it to 98% of
people would save money using tank.

99
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,320
That's their claim, not mine. Cause I'm
no statistic Titian it's, it's at us.

100
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,250
Titian it's my note three is about

101
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,720
one eighth of my cell phone price for
my iPhone. Yeah, it's pretty cheap.

102
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:04,820
I think I pay on average
about 20 bucks a month.

103
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,670
It's a $21 a month is the average month
monthly bill. So you have an average bill

104
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,140
below average like northern walls.
440

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,200
bucks is the average annual savings
per device for a business with 11 to 20

106
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:23,280
employees. It's pretty sweet.
Um, and I said, like I said,

107
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:26,880
all of the best android cell phones,
no termination fees.

108
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,810
Go to Rogan dot [inaudible] dot com and
you can save 25 bucks off your first

109
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:34,050
device.
10 uses the sprint backlog backbone.

110
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,890
So it's not like it's some
wonky ass cell phone network.

111
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:40,200
They use one of the best cell
phone networks in the world.

112
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,970
And the sprint backbone is you give the
exact same sub service and coverage that

113
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:45,990
you would if you had sprint,

114
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,250
but you're using a ting device and you
can quit any time you want and it's all

115
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:52,440
set up on their terms.

116
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,730
An ethical company providing you with an
awesome service and everyone that I've

117
00:06:56,731 --> 00:07:01,290
talked to about it, they've all loved
it. Chris Ryan uses it. Brian uses it.

118
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,480
It's a sweet,
easy way to save money.

119
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,600
Nowadays you're always on a wifi network
because you're usually always at home

120
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,400
or you're always at work
and stuff like that.

121
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:13,360
So a lot of people are on these plans
now that don't make any sense because no

122
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:15,190
one's really making phone calls anymore.

123
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,320
You remember when it minutes
were a big thing. No one's,

124
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,090
everyone's texting now and you're,

125
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:21,250
if you're texting and you're
connected to your Wifi,

126
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,320
a lot of these phones will
just like, Oh, you're,

127
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:27,220
you're just using this wifi network.
You're not even using tings network. So

128
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,700
I think it's important to still talk
to people on the phone. I really do.

129
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,740
I think we're getting a little weird, a
little weird. We go days in and you know,

130
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:38,170
it talks to us like, look, you
only just text all your friends.

131
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,860
I mean maybe there's some benefit to that
sometimes when you want to decompress,

132
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,650
but I think for the most part we should
probably talk to each other every now

133
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:47,140
and again. It is interesting.
It's like we're going backwards.

134
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:51,280
I'm one of the to stuff it and just go
carrier pigeon or raising like in game of

135
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:54,610
Thrones, that's going to be the mode
that's going to be the coolest guy in the

136
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:55,091
neighborhood.

137
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:58,450
The guy that gets it has the first
raven that's trained to drop stuff off

138
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:02,680
somewhere. It's going to be, how
hard is it to train up fucking raven.

139
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:05,800
Didn't want to listen to what, all
right. I think could go anywhere.

140
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,280
They can do anything fly and the
fucking smart and it's not, I'm like,

141
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,860
there's no food. Right. You
know, they can find food.

142
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,610
They don't need to listen to
your bullshit or an animal.

143
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:15,550
So smart to travel long distances.

144
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:18,340
You think they'd be smart enough to
realize they don't have to take that shit.

145
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:20,270
You know, they could just go do
whatever they want. You know,

146
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,660
it's a really fucked up
feeling or a thought rather.

147
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,680
What if that's how Raven's
involved evolved their
intelligence cause ravens are

148
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:27,550
so smart,

149
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,670
they do all these multistep process tests
where raven has to get a stick and use

150
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:35,860
the stick to get a bigger stick and use
that bigger stick to get an even larger

151
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:37,600
stick cause they're all
down these long tubes.

152
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,600
So the Raven keeps figuring out
that as it gets longer sticks,

153
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,350
he can reach and scoop the law,

154
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,700
the stick that's longer than that and
pull it out and then drop it and then use

155
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:46,930
that one to get a piece of meat.

156
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,030
And they do it Loos like seven or
eight steps and you watch it and ego.

157
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,140
That is freaking me the fuck out.
That thing is smart at Shit. Yeah.

158
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,310
They're probably so smart

159
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,810
that they figured out how to not
have to be the male Guy Anymore

160
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,390
or Ravens and crows the same. Um,
I, that's a very good question.

161
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,930
I think not. Yeah. But it
seems like it should be right.

162
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,660
Or Ravens and crows as shame. I think
they're both blackbirds but, uh,

163
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,210
that's just the word just being racist.
Racist. No, it's a good question.

164
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,410
I'll read from what parts are all
this year or Ravens and crows.

165
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:25,110
The Samsung Different since
treating crows and ravens.

166
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,590
There was a crow fight my backyard a
couple of weeks ago and I had crow was

167
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:32,280
injured in Atlanta in my backyard and I
couldn't get out, kind of fly anymore,

168
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,700
so I just wanted to go out, you know,
take my dog out to go to the bathroom.

169
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,560
And the second I would come out,

170
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,020
all the crows and neighborhood
would just start going crazy.

171
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,790
Like swooping down,
like trying to protect the injured one.

172
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,910
Their smartest shit. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. It's weird.

173
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,730
Like we think of him as just birds,
but they're like a little gang.

174
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,020
They're a gang of little flying
monkeys. Um, this is the, the,

175
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:58,920
the explanation.
A raven is a bigger version of a crow,

176
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,840
although they are the same species.

177
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,070
A Raven has common name given to the
largest species of birds in the genus.

178
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,143
Core of us.

179
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Corvids are commonly referred to as
Chros and other species in the same genus

180
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,100
you see, Janice or Jenice
gives you say Janice. Right?

181
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:18,390
That's why I only read though. I never say
like Gina's, it doesn't really come up.

182
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,910
If you use genus, had a conversation,
you're a Douche. She totally,

183
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,880
unless you're a biologist
and he's a genius and you're
like, what are you doing?

184
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,120
You stop it. You just stop. Cut Your
fucking fanciness. Little there for him.

185
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:33,930
The genius. Um, corvids. Okay,
so that's what it is. And uh,

186
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:38,790
they're the same, uh, Jean
needs as Jack Dawes and rooks.

187
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,540
I don't know what any of those birds
are. There you go. So now you know,

188
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,780
go to wikipedia.org and look
up ravens and that's it.

189
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,020

and then we are in Vancouver on Friday.

206
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,490
Vancouver is the Orpheum theater.
I'm not sure what's,

207
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,800
I think one of them sold out.

208
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,550
I think it's the Lloydminster
one or really close.

209
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,230
So if you want to get you free, come

Go to [inaudible] dot com
brain with Joe Rogan experience

213
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,940
Joe Rogan podcast my night.
Good

214
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,570
googly Mooglie,
Tony Hinchcliffe,

215
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,140
googly mooglie fresh back from Indiana,

216
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,470
letting those middle America
people know what the fuck is up.

217
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,090
Middle America is a lot like middle
earth in some ways. You know, you know,

218
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:43,890
middle earth like where the hobbits lived,

219
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:48,870
the good folk wasn't middle earth like
the cool people. That's where the uh,

220
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,450
the hobbits where I don't know about that,

221
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,340
but I do know that Indianapolis,

222
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,840
I learned something this weekend about
Indianapolis and that's that it's like

223
00:12:56,841 --> 00:13:00,400
the south of the Midwest.
Southern a lot of ways. Yeah.

224
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,110
It's amazing though because
it's pretty much straight uh,

225
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,560
west of Columbus.
But they're like,

226
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,320
and they were laughing about
it so I'm not insulting them,

227
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:13,070
but there are a lot more like a hook,
a hook. Then the city is around them.

228
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:16,940
Like you just go a few miles down the
road and all of a sudden it's all about

229
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:21,140
racing and it's all about guns and a
lot of Camo shorts I saw cause it's

230
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:22,730
starting to be summer there.
So

231
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,080
yeah, there are, there's a lot of
country music lovers there, Kentucky.

232
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:30,980
Like you'd never think that Kentucky's
right next to Cincinnati. Yeah. You know,

233
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:34,180
like you think of Cincinnati,
Cincinnati, wk Rp.

234
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,660
Remember that show with Loni Anderson.
You think of Cincinnati is like a city.

235
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,980
You think of Kentucky as, Oh
man. What's going on down there?

236
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,940
A lot of Banjo picking and
moonshine making barbecue and

237
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,320
woo.

238
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,330
You don't think it's right,

239
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:54,320
right next to Cincinnati and Cincinnati
airports in Kentucky. Oh it is? Yeah.

240
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,870
And you land in Kentucky.

241
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,290
They call it the Cincinnati
airport because they're
ashamed they're in Kentucky.

242
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:03,460
That's so sad. And I'm like, you know
Kentucky people. Kentucky's awesome.

243
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:06,520
Louisville is awesome. You Know
Kentucky Fried Chicken. All right.

244
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:09,580
You guys are known for Bourbon.
Like you guys make some great shit.

245
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:11,540
Kentucky's were Corvettes are made the,

246
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,860
they make all their Corvettes
and Kentucky, Jeremy Clarkson,

247
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:18,940
the guy from top gear who's
driving this corvette and uh, he,

248
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,130
he likes yelled out like
while I was driving it,

249
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,100
well done fad man from Kentucky,

250
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,610
you have created a masterpiece
that you're going to,

251
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:31,660
if he's going to yell out the n word or,
so he did that later.

252
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,680
He did that though. That poor
bastard. People have hubris man.

253
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,360
They think they can say things like that.

254
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,510
I read something cool about Kentucky
Fried Chicken since you brought it up.

255
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:42,260
I'm going to say it,

256
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:47,260
it's a the kernel like whoever the actual
KFC guy was his protege or like the

257
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,050
person who he trained underneath him.

258
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,970
Favorite guy coming up the ranks of like
fast food, uh, helped him out a lot.

259
00:14:55,971 --> 00:15:00,020
Like chain made some major decisions was
the guy that told him put the chicken

260
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:02,210
in a bucket instead of a box.

261
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:05,120
This guy was Dave Thomas who then
went on to make all the Wendy's

262
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,170
Whoa, powerful, fast food
conspiracy theory. But

263
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,140
it's a fact like some shit that your
friends told you when you were in high

264
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:19,620
school. It turned out to be totally
false, but you repeated forever.

265
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,520
Nabisco is owned by the same
people who make missiles.

266
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,280
They're trying to kill you
one way or another, bro.

267
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,470
It's either with cupcakes
or with missiles.

268
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,540
Well, it is the same company
that makes cigarettes.

269
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,830
Nabisco is RJ Reynolds and Rjr Nabisco.

270
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,600
Rj R is RJ rental.

271
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,460
Impossible. The people feeding you
Twinkies would not hate what you did.

272
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,280
Is that Nabisco where they Twinkies
and the Bisco have Twinkies? No.

273
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,570
Who had Twinkies and hostess.
Hostess. It's not the same,

274
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:52,120
but it could be under the same
painful,

275
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,240
but Nabisco is, I'm known
as being like, you know,

276
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:59,160
if you think of like snacks,
right?

277
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,400
You think of like something that's
Yummy but not necessarily good for you.

278
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,340
I picture the Nilla wafers.
I remember those. Yeah.

279
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,550
What did they have that's like
real bullshit. No. Pisco Pisco.

280
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,050
They have some good chocolate
chip cookies. Yeah, right? Yeah.

281
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,170
The Bisco some good God, they got
the chip Keebler elves on their side.

282
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:20,630
I do believe, check this out. Dave
Thomas and Colonel Sanders. Uh, both guy,

283
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,140
uh, they both won first place
and they tied a for who split?

284
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:29,310
Who could best fried chicken. Wow. Dave
Thomas' chicken. Why doesn't Dave Thomas,

285
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:31,710
just so, I mean he's dead
now, but when he was alive,

286
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:34,790
why didn't you sell chicken at one day?
He did. There was a test market. Uh,

287
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,300
what they do. So checking in when he's,
but there was a Tuscan sandwiches.

288
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,970
They don't yet,
you can't get it like a bucket of chicken.

289
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,170
There was a test market
company that Wendy's started
that I only think stayed in

290
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:46,590
Columbus or at least Ohio called sister's
chicken. I don't know if you think it,

291
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,350
it sounds, I remember that. And they,

292
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,880
they actually were way better
than Kentucky Fried Chicken.

293
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:54,270
They had these little chicken littles and,
Oh man, it was a chicken littles like,

294
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:58,900
uh, like uh, you know, get, it was, it was
like white castles, but with chicken. Oh,

295
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,760
this is like the Steve jobs of fast.

296
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,960
He figured out a lot of shit with
Wendy's. Yeah. Like you really did.

297
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:10,140
Like one of the things was that the
food is never frozen. Like if you,

298
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:13,020
if you get a steak or a
hamburger patty steak,

299
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
if you got a hamburger patty from
any other place, it's usually frozen.

300
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,870
And they just sorta like,
if you look at some of them,

301
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,990
they didn't even look like
meat, like white castle. It
doesn't even look like me.

302
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,830
Right. So confusing you looking at what
a white castle burger is. It's delicious.

303
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:27,360
But you're like,
what the fuck am I eating?

304
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,860
But if you look at Wendy's like they
can, they get their patties, they're big,

305
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:34,230
thick patties and they get
them and they just, they don't,

306
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,110
they don't ever freeze them.
They just throw them right onto the grill,

307
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,460
which has gotta be better. Right? Yeah.
The less you can free shit you got.

308
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,560
Think like when you're eating things,

309
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,310
you're kind of taking in like live
cultures. Like if you eat yogurt,

310
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:50,010
you taken live bacteria,
you know,

311
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,480
and when you eat like anything,
whether it's um, whether it's, um,

312
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,500
the, any kinds of foods sort of have
like some sort of bacteria fungus on it,

313
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:02,310
just a slight amount.
And so when you're taking them in,

314
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:06,710
you're taking in like living things
whenever you just totally freezing

315
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,530
fuck out of living things ever good.
I just can't be good.

316
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,430
There's something, something's got
to be missing there. I don't, I mean,

317
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:16,270
I'm no scientist,

318
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,720
but I think when you freeze it till
it's like literally it doesn't rot.

319
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,040
Like just, it's not supposed to happen.
That's supposed to be fucked. Yeah.

320
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,230
You know, like if you have
crops and your crops freeze,

321
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,470
you're supposed to be fucked. You
know? That's what it's supposed to be.

322
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:33,250
It's not supposed to be free shit.
And you're eating like frozen peas.

323
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,290
Like what does,
what does even in those things,

324
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,890
that shit ain't a regular p that's
got to cut something. Right.

325
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,900
And that stuff gets frozen on the surface
of a thing. I would like to see a sign

326
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,880
ticket analysis,
maybe I'm totally wrong,

327
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,710
but I would from my Wu wolf bro Woo
factor, how I would describe it,

328
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,910
uh, I would say you're losing the
essence of the life form of plant.

329
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,340
Once you freeze it and kill it,
everything's dead.

330
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,830
Like that's the reason why it's not
rotting is all that bacteria that would

331
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:02,550
normally break down anything that
you leave out and it starts to decay.

332
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,770
That's all on the surface of that anyway.
Right? I mean, it just takes time to rot.

333
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,780
That's what it is.

334
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,310
Thoughts that you have some dead
bacteria instead of live bacteria on the

335
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:13,300
surface of your thing.

336
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,560
Yeah, that's gotta be part
of it. I mean, isn't that,

337
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,960
that is what like taking live cultures,

338
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:21,530
it was all about like everybody wants
to eat probiotic stuff like probiotic.

339
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,060
I have some probiotic Sauerkraut, man,
it was amazing. What does probiotic mean?

340
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:30,140
It means it's rotting like
probiotic. Sauerkraut is, it's like,

341
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,890
it's almost like carbonated. You ever
have that stuff? It's like fermented. Oh,

342
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:35,930
I've had it. Yeah. It's
really good. I love it.

343
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,210
It's delicious and super good for you.

344
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,570
It's like a lot of people don't know like
raw sauerkraut is fucking really good

345
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,070
for you. Oh yeah. It's a,

346
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:48,100
it's got a live thing you're taking into
your body and that live cultures very

347
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:52,580
good for fighting off diseases and
for balancing your stomach and for,

348
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,100
there's a lot of people that they're
connecting him with autism and a lot of

349
00:19:55,101 --> 00:20:00,101
ways because a lot of people with autism
also have a bowel issues and gut issues

350
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,020
and they think that uh,

351
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:07,060
it could possibly be connected to like a
wrong balance of bacteria in your body.

352
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:08,804
Right.

353
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,780
Which is fascinating man.
Yeah.

354
00:20:10,781 --> 00:20:15,150
Sauerkrauts one of the few things that
is good for you and completely delicious

355
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:19,260
at the same crazy is that like
it makes a hot dog 50% better,

356
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,470
easily sausage.
He could put it.

357
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,990
Any is Tony Making Sauerkraut?

358
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,700
It's one of those foods where you could
like smell it and picture it right in

359
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:33,330
front of you. The good like
Brown, seedy mustard. Oh.

360
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,740
Or figure that out. Like all the other
vegetables must to be so jealous.

361
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,010
They don't get to be on the hot dogs.
You get like pickles and you know,

362
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:44,070
it's like cucumbers and Sauerkraut.
Those are the happy ones.

363
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,010
Every once in tomatoes kind of bullshit
on my cheeseburger. Totally. The

364
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,310
fuck is that. All those cool vegetables
hate on the lettuce and tomatoes.

365
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:54,310
Why should let us into men will be
allowed to be on a cheeseburger like, Ooh,

366
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:58,180
it's per tune. This is healthy.
Let us is less than nothing.

367
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,330
What's the difference between
our bratwurst and a sausage?

368
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,520
That's a good question. Maybe it's a
niche. It must be the preparation right?

369
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,980
In Ohio.
Bratwurst were everywhere.

370
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,740
Like there was restaurants that
specialize in brought where's here?

371
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:15,460
I'm always looking for a broad words. Now
you can only find sausages or hot dogs.

372
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,550
There's gotta be a place.
I know you can get them at the store.

373
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,550
I think bratwurst might be a
little bit of a smokey or flavor.

374
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:24,980
That's my guests going into it. I
have no idea. That's talk sausage,

375
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:31,600
Ravens and sausages.
Okay. The same difference

376
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,710
is this between a square and a rectangle.
What?

377
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,850
You've just broken a bratwurst. Okay.

378
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:45,540
This is the weirdest. Again, whatever
the guys had. A square is a rectangle,

379
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:49,090
but a rectangle is not
a square. Oh, I see. Um,

380
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,480
so is a bratwurst a sausage.

381
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,330
But any sauce where is not
a bratwurst brought worst.

382
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Our pork sausage with a medium grind
spiced mainly with pepper sausage is any

383
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:04,890
ground meat in casing. Hmm. So
it seems like it's a sausage.

384
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,680
It's just a different type of sausage
that's saw. It is, I mean it's,

385
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,470
it's a pork sausage.
You can call it a bratwurst all you want.

386
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:15,140
That's a creepy word to WHO's,
what is that? Yeah, German tours.

387
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,090
What do you think caused certain parts
of the world to develop that sound like

388
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:21,924
that?

389
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:27,830
Like when you get like weird sounds
brothel or weird fucking language sounds,

390
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,270
those sounds that people in
that region made like what kind,

391
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,210
what got them to do that?

392
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,170
It's crazy. It's like they think the
opposite of us. Like, Oh, I'm in American,

393
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:40,450
I annunciate my,
you know what I mean?

394
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:44,050
Like that's what's crazy is we look at
them like they're weird and they look,

395
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:45,610
imagine how weird we sound.
Like,

396
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:48,490
if you think of what they sound
like and what we sound like,

397
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,080
their perspective must be like,

398
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,670
I must sound like where like
singing things because it's so pure.

399
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,001
Well,

400
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:58,180
we're a fascinating example for the rest
of the world because if you look at all

401
00:22:58,181 --> 00:23:01,510
the other English languages in the world,
they all are pretty similar.

402
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,570
Australian and New Zealand. I mean,
I've got a good day. You know,

403
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:06,400
they got a little bit of a difference,

404
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:10,360
but it still sounds like an
English accent. It's like
an altered English accent.

405
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,830
Whereas we got over here and went,

406
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,190
Nah, not so much. No, we're going
to say it our way. Fuck base,

407
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,000
and we're going to make more bombs and
we're gonna make it tell everybody talks

408
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,850
your waist weird.
Now you're going to have to learn our way.

409
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:26,990
The English language is
quite weird because you're
somewhere and you're talking

410
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:28,580
to a man.
He's still talking about this.

411
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,800
So I'm having a hard time understanding
you right now. That's not English.

412
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,800
This is English fucker here.
That nice and clean.

413
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,000
No fucking words slurring into
the next word like word soup.

414
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,450
You're going to Goddamn word, food,
train, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

415
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,240
We're perfect over here in America.
You know how to rocket.

416
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,380
We fucking got took your language
and linseed it. We made it better.

417
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,250
See your language bitch. Who's our shooter
of the day? I haven't heard yet today.

418
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,200
I hope they catch him. Flocker, man,

419
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,220
it's got an ugly dude that north
Hollywood shit was crazy. That dude,

420
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,500
the North Hollywood thing
for folks who don't know,

421
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,850
there was a man on a roof and I thought
I saw it from Eliza slushing jurors.

422
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,840
Twitter.

423
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,790
Eliza slessinger was
torturing her ex boyfriend,

424
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,770
uh, on a, on Twitter.

425
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:26,780
She dated a guy slessinger that
made up a complete total history.

426
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,330
He said his mom was dying. His mom was
fine. There's nothing wrong with mom.

427
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,540
Said he went to the Yale.
He never went to Yale.

428
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,520
He said he was starting
up all these businesses.

429
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:38,210
The guy was like $100,000 in debt. Like
he, he was like living with roommates.

430
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:41,570
Like he was just,
he totally fabricated as super successful.

431
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,260
Eliza Schlesinger got Sarah Tiana,
she got Sarah. Tiana said, Whoa,

432
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,140
she got Sarah Tiana and hardcore,

433
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:52,010
but she was going off on our Twitter
and then I saw something about,

434
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:55,160
shoot the guy on the roof. And I'm like,
what kind? The roof? Like, you know,

435
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,410
she was saying, kill that
fucking guy. She's so crazy.

436
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,400
And then I went and then I started
looking, uh, looking up stories.

437
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,280
What exactly is the,
the full cool?

438
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:03,971
Well,

439
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:08,260
what pretty much happened is it started
off as a police chase and then it went

440
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:11,200
on. Like it was one of those ones that
just went on every single highway.

441
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,260
And the guy finally got out out in north
Hollywood and he just got out of his

442
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:20,830
car. And when he, he was driving,
he was holding out a big, uh, rifle.

443
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,060
Hey automated rifle, just like
hanging out the window. And so, uh,

444
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,920
he pulls his car over in north Hollywood
and he gets out of his car and he pulls

445
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:34,840
out this huge gun and he just starts
walking down North Hollywood with his gun.

446
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,040
And then he gets on top of a roof
of a house. And then at that time,

447
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,280
that's when I tuned in because
I saw Eliza tweet also,

448
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,650
and then I thought he was just
going to shoot himself, but he just,

449
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,210
for about 20 minutes,

450
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:51,211
he was on top of a roof with a gun and
then he comes down off the roof and he

451
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:52,720
breaks into this house.

452
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,320
Luckily there was nobody home and he just
sat in the house for about four hours.

453
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,590
That's when it like the movie,
I mean the,

454
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,270
the real life just completely
became boring. Like there's,

455
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:06,250
so the news for like three
hours or however long it
was just repeating the same

456
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:07,480
thing over and over for three hours.

457
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,700
Finally they got the Swat team all around
the house and they shot in a bunch of

458
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:17,000
containers, uh, of smoke
or whatever, pure gas.

459
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,490
And the guy just walks out.

460
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:22,870
But what was the coolest thing is that
the two police dogs just came running up

461
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:27,700
to him, sniffed his leg, and then sat down
right next to him. Like just like, hey,

462
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,450
we're waiting for a whistle before we
just chew your Dick Apart, you know?

463
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,950
And the guy just like,
you know, surrendered.

464
00:26:32,951 --> 00:26:37,951
So it was a really crazy beginning part
of the movie or thing and then it just

465
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:44,070
sucked at the end. Well it seems like
more hours, you know, problem where we

466
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,380
have a short attention span,
we want all live,

467
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,960
all these live altercations to go down
as if they're a 90 minute movie that we

468
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:52,794
can pay attention to.

469
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,920
Yeah. But I mean just yesterday
there was somebody in Vegas, the,

470
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,440
I don't know if you saw
the Walmart incident that
happened in or the day before

471
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,700
and do you think this is copycat shit,
I, I think something's going on man.

472
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:06,310
Cause this,
I was talking about it four days ago.

473
00:27:06,311 --> 00:27:08,260
Like how we'd been having
a shooter every day.

474
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:11,260
There was that guy in Canada that I
don't even know if they ever caught in

475
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:14,200
Canada. The guy that was just had like
three guns and he was going through

476
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:15,730
neighborhoods,
shooting cops and stuff.

477
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,860
Yeah. He was shooting those guys who
look like Bullwinkle's buddy. Yeah.

478
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,100
They dress like bowling legals pal.
Canadian royal mounties. Yeah they,

479
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,720
it's a horrible story.

480
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:29,750
You shot like three of them up there and
someone I met someone who knew that guy,

481
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,000
I can't remember the exact thing,
but they, they uh, weren't surprised.

482
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,610
It seems like it is kind of like a weird
copycat thing now because I mean we'd

483
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:42,020
been having it ever since
the Santa Barbara Douchebag.

484
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,470
Well, there's a lot of people out there
that are probably on the edge and it just

485
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:48,460
takes one thing like that to push them.

486
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,010
Yeah. The, the, the, the school
things with these that, you know,

487
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:56,190
like I saw a part of that
kid's video where he's like,

488
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:58,510
I'm going to keep them all.
And it's like terrifying.

489
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,360
He was talking like he was doing
something much bigger than shooting a few

490
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:07,620
people. He was saying things like,
oh, you're all going to, you know,

491
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm going to show America or the world,
like he's talking on such a grand scale.

492
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,283
And uh,

493
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,810
I think that they really think that it's
even bigger than it is and that they're

494
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,900
like a hero or something. Like they're
going to be remembered for that.

495
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,320
Well, they know that that's the
thing that people are most afraid of.

496
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:25,900
So you can cause that thing to happen.
You become famous.

497
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:30,190
I mean it's that simple and they equate
in their head being famous in that way

498
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:31,780
is having an impact.
And you know,

499
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,050
obviously the guy had a huge impact
with all the people's families that he

500
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:37,810
killed. That guy just drove around
and killed his three roommates.

501
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,870
What was fascinating,

502
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:43,871
it was that that became this like
a woman's rights sort of a Hashtag.

503
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,010
Yes. All women, you know, or uh, I
wouldn't say, I wouldn't say woman rights,

504
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:54,790
like awareness,
awareness of a violence that women face.

505
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,500
And I got admitted. It makes you think
about it in a different way that the,

506
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:02,080
that hashtags a great
hashtag. Yes. All women.

507
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,240
Because not all men have to worry about
the things that women have to worry

508
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:09,310
about. Like you don't have to
worry about being raped by checks.

509
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,050
You don't have to worry about,
you know,

510
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:14,680
like women beating you up
or women's stealing things
from you or women trying to

511
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,180
rape you.
You don't have to worry about it.

512
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,980
But women have to worry about it from men.

513
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,920
Like it's a whole different world
they live in. You know, it's,

514
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:24,910
it's hard to think about when
you're live in your world, you know,

515
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:26,730
your world's pretty easy.
You're super between,

516
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,970
right. Well yeah, I was
going to on about 130 pounds,

517
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:33,440
so I'm pretty sure I can be
raped in any given point.

518
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,550
I know a little hashtags should
be yes. All women. Antonia hint,

519
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,250
I know what it's like to be a
woman. Or do you when uh, someone

520
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,380
said that from the WHO?
Pete Townsend said that,

521
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,660
so he knows what it's like to be a
woman. Oh, what is a woman? Really? Yeah.

522
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,100
It was some crazy claim or some crazy,
a statement about, uh, you know,

523
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,910
haven't had bisexual experience.
The towns, it's one of those guys,

524
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,240
like if you do a little research,
he has some crazy stuff about him,

525
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:04,290
but he can get away with anything because
he's the lead guitarist from the hill

526
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:06,370
and he does that windmill
thing and you know,

527
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:10,360
when you're that cool you could be crazy.
But he has like some crazy history.

528
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,690
He got investigated for child
pornography. Yeah. And uh,

529
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,470
he said that he was doing it for some
sort of a research project or something

530
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:19,240
like that.
It was researching child pornography.

531
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:20,800
So in doing so he's searching for it.

532
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,050
Yeah. I don't remember what the project
was that he was involved with that he was

533
00:30:25,051 --> 00:30:27,570
saying he was involved with,
but that's kind of fucked.

534
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,090
There's one woman that could beat up.
You were talking about there's no,

535
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,490
that guys can get raped by
women and stuff like that.

536
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,240
Did you see that woman that beat up that
little 17 year old kid and he filmed

537
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,520
the whole thing on the Connecticut beach.

538
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,420
There's chicks like that out there
while she was beating him up. Yeah.

539
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,780
There's this woman in Connecticut.

540
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:48,070
He was flying when those little
toy drones on the beach and uh,

541
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,370
it has little cameras in it and she
thought she crazy woman like, oh,

542
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:53,800
he's recording us like it's
illegal or something to do that.

543
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,370
And she started like calling the police
and he started filming it on his iPhone,

544
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,630
what she was doing. And right when
she got off the phone with the police,

545
00:30:59,631 --> 00:31:00,880
like she's like,
you better get here.

546
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,140
I got him right now because I felt and
just starts beating this kid up and he's

547
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:07,750
filming the whole thing like that.
After I saw this video,

548
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,300
I actually had to go in the other
room and just sit down cause I was,

549
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,810
my heart was racing so hard. I just want
you to kill somebody after watching.

550
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,730
You should w would you like to look at it?

551
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,350
Really you? You're fucking this woman.

552
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,250
I want to find this woman.
I want to find this woman.

553
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,510
This is going to drive you crazy. Okay.
Let's see here. Okay, check it. Love this.

554
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,630
Yes.
Make me mad.

555
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,590
You had to go sit in another room because
your heart was beating him. Okay, buddy.

556
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,763
Brilliant.

557
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,013
Okay.

558
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,380
Andrew Mirrors 23 did not appreciate
this man flying his drone on the beach.

559
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,250
She was under the impression she had
an air pack perception of privacy on a

560
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:46,084
public page,

561
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,370
pictures and try and upload
them from a or from a para.

562
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Can you guys get here at Hammonasset at
now realizing this video recording her.

563
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,820
He's taking pictures of people on the
beach with like with a helicopter plane.

564
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,390
Wow.
Can you guys

565
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:05,070
video kept him from getting arrested
cause she said that he had assaulted her

566
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,650
dude. They released him after they
showed the video from the iPhone.

567
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,810
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

568
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,490
I know it gets so fucked up.

569
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,160
Well right now all you're seen is this
kid holding onto his equipment and the

570
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:22,190
woman is a confronting him.
He's trying to put his equipment away.

571
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,860
You're a thought layman.
You asked why?

572
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,060
Oh whoa.

573
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,420
She's like really hard to
see what's happening here.

574
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,880
Yeah, I think this is fake. No,
it's not. The woman was arrested.

575
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,610
Is this on the news and
what is this guy doing?

576
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,340
That's a weird half guard looking at her
hands are ripping it there. His mouth.

577
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,350
Yeah. She's putting her hands in his
mouth and he's filming it the entire time.

578
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,890
Like as a selfie. Smart.
It's hilarious actually.

579
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,020
Oh my God, this girl's crazy.
She got terrible half guard.

580
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,040
If you weren't assaulting me,
I wouldn't be touching. You

581
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,980
want to stop assaulting me?
Get off of me.

582
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:25,110
Call the cops. I me. It's not bad.

583
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,573
Wow.

584
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,100
He's just totally playing. All
right. He's not really scared.

585
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:39,500
She just happy that he's filming all this.
Please get off of me.

586
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,793
Wow.

587
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,980
That make video. It makes me crazy.
This is photography's not a crime.

588
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,210
It's amazing that he got that.
Why does that make you so mad to me?

589
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:59,140
It's funny because I've been in
situations psych. Hi. Yeah. I mean,

590
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,260
it's funny is he wasn't in danger.
He was doing this the whole time.

591
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,183
He wasn't like,

592
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:07,090
he was like making sure he filmed this
girl beating the shit out of him. Right.

593
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,810
Like you didn't even like stop or
defend himself. He wasn't scared.

594
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,740
I had been in domestic violence
plate things before though and Shit.

595
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,000
That shit where she could have just said,
yeah,

596
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:19,270
he attacked me and stuff like that shit.
Now he did say that like,

597
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,540
that's why I know that your
situation drives me nuts.

598
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,900
That's back where it makes me want to
have a Gopro on the recording all day.

599
00:34:25,901 --> 00:34:26,430
Yeah,

600
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,860
no. Yeah, the salted
by chicks all day long.

601
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,900
Brian's upload and all day it'd
be like chicks punching up,

602
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,790
holding him down in the parking lot
and kicking the ball and he just wasn't

603
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,180
telling us about these get over me.

604
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,540
He was just keeping all
these from us cause he was
talking about it on this show.

605
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,420
It's like, you know, every day
another one I'm going to bring it up.

606
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:52,080
No fuck are they going to
make fun of me all day? Just

607
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,880
chics beating his ass.
Yeah. I don't know man.

608
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,470
I mean she's obviously an asshole,

609
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:01,850
but he was like letting her get away
with it on purpose. It is amazing.

610
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,260
It is amazing. Five, 10 years
ago that same thing happens.

611
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:10,040
That's 17 year old who was just
flying his plane on a beach,

612
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:15,070
ends up going to jail because if a woman
does say this guy assaulted me and the

613
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:20,120
cops come there and they see his shirt
half ripped as if she was in a defensive

614
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:23,990
position. You know what I
mean? Absolutely. It's amazing.

615
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,440
There's no doubt. There's no
doubt. Well she said that she,

616
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,660
that he was assaulted or that
he assaulted her brother.

617
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,030
They showed the video and
that's what got him off.

618
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:35,270
So I think that she's obviously
a crazy person and would lie,

619
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:37,650
but I think that's normal
for people to beat your ass.

620
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,570
Like people that beat your ass like that,

621
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,750
like physically beat your ass
to fucking crazy. They're crazy.

622
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,660
Of course they're going to lie. They're
telling the truth. They're fucked up.

623
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,320
There are a mess. Like that's gotta be
the hardest thing about being a cop.

624
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,101
He's like,

625
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:52,290
you're showing up and two people are
beating the fuck out of each other.

626
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,670
You've got to figure out who did what.

627
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,050
And you always got to side with
the woman who Scott Simpson law.

628
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,420
It's what they nicknamed. And the
reason why you get aside with a woman,

629
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:02,310
it's cause it's like,
let's reverse that scenario.

630
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,350
If that guy had been beating that girl
up, it wouldn't be funny at all. Right.

631
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,520
But it was funny to me watching that guy.

632
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,920
Yeah. To me while he's Selfie, come on.

633
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,360
I think that's funny.

634
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,160
I would not think it's funny if it
was a man doing it to a woman. Right?

635
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,070
Because I would worry the
woman's going to really get hurt.

636
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:21,440
I wasn't worried about him
getting hurt there. I mean,

637
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:24,920
she wasn't even strong enough to hurt
him. You never know man. He was only 17

638
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,230
I was a grown adult like selfie himself,
probably a grape timid.

639
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,300
She wanted to know. I think that kid
is smart that he didn't fight back.

640
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,150
I just very smart and it'll, all he
did was defend himself. Very smart.

641
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,010
He's a smart kid, obviously. She can't
just go around doing that like, yeah,

642
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:45,630
you probably shouldn't fucking fly your
drone in to people's houses can film

643
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:48,510
them. You shouldn't hover
over their backyard with a
trying to Suntan and filling

644
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,630
them. I don't know what he was doing
this, it's a weird thing. This,

645
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,860
this idea that you could put a camera
on top of a little like robot and fly it

646
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,890
around because when we were
filming that Scifi show,

647
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,110
we had some dudes that
were really good at it.

648
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:04,590
They had like these high tech drones
and we were fucking around with them and

649
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:07,200
putting on these goggles and
the virtual reality goggles.

650
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:09,750
You put them on and you feel like
you're flying like this drone,

651
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:13,470
you're going over the tree tops and I
was like this is going to get real weird

652
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:17,010
cause this isn't super expensive stuff
like you're looking at this, this is like,

653
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,220
I mean I don't know a couple thousand
bucks or something like that to get a rig

654
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:21,900
like this. I don't know. I
don't know how many thousand.

655
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:24,930
I'm just guessing but it didn't look
to be like prohibitively expensive.

656
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:27,270
It's not like something that costs
50 grand or something like that.

657
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:32,250
I think you could get it for the price
of some toys that people save up and buy.

658
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,120
Like there's a lot of people that can
have a fucking flying robot that films

659
00:37:36,121 --> 00:37:38,130
everything now they have it
at Fry's for like 30 bucks.

660
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,940
Really cheap.
Well I don't know.

661
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,390
Technology is crazy when that's like
in the eye on the checkout area,

662
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:48,760
on your way out. Grab a drone. I
don't think it's the same thing.

663
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:52,360
Level of sophistication that these
guys had. These guys had, like I said,

664
00:37:52,361 --> 00:37:56,620
virtual reality cameras attached to 'em
and they're pretty sophisticated but

665
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:59,320
they have a real problem with how
long they can stay up in the air.

666
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,190
They can't stay up in the air very
long. They just, they just can't do it.

667
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:04,780
They're just the out of gas and they fall.

668
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,380
You could load them up with batteries
but then that batteries is weight and it

669
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:11,530
makes it harder for them to fly so they,
they need to work around that.

670
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:13,750
I think they can only stay up for like
30 minutes or something like that.

671
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,090
Maybe there's some that can do it better,

672
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:19,900
but when you're watching one fly over the
tree tops and you wearing one of those

673
00:38:19,901 --> 00:38:24,400
goggles, it's a trip, dude. It's a
freaky feeling. You're like, wow,

674
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:27,460
this is nuts. This is like what
it's like to be an eagle. You know?

675
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,000
They get that shit really, really
good. It's going to be nuts.

676
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,750
If they can develop some super clear,

677
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,050
like get some something that wraps
around your head, right? Like this,

678
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:41,470
like your entire field division
out like this is all this,

679
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,890
you know the screen and then figure out
some way to film something and not have

680
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:51,500
it make any noise so you
don't hear it. Right. You,

681
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:54,700
you somehow or another they can make
something that doesn't make noise.

682
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,320
Yeah. These drones, there's a really
cool music video or if not music video,

683
00:38:58,321 --> 00:38:59,640
but just a video of a guy throwing,

684
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,060
doing a drone over Los Angeles and he
goes like on top of the capital records

685
00:39:03,061 --> 00:39:05,990
building, you could see like the
roof and stuff like that. It,

686
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,130
he goes over like the
Hollywood hills parties.

687
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:10,830
Like that house that's above the comedy
store and there's people having a party

688
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:13,470
up there and he's just going right
over people with beach balls.

689
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,200
There's Jim Henson's a studios he just
flew over. See? That's weird. Yeah.

690
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,123
That's kind of weird.

691
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,250
Especially like say if you have like
an ex boyfriend or an ex girlfriend

692
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,470
beside the fucking fly,

693
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:27,350
a drone around your house and film you
while you're fucking the next person

694
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,820
you know, get mad at you,
you fucking piece of shit.

695
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:33,230
You didn't even wait a month,

696
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,330
wasn't expecting you to be
watching me with your drone.

697
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,670
Drone introduced me to the truth.
You're a piece of shit.

698
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,900
Fucking deflect deflecting.
When I bought you the drone,

699
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:52,970
I didn't think you were
going to be spying on me.

700
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:55,730
I thought you'd trust me like
the arguments of the future.

701
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,763
Do you think

702
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,080
speed used by like perverts and Papa
razzies nowadays like just going up in

703
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:07,200
hotels with little cameras and
drones and stuff. Cause look at this.

704
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:10,740
This is like HD. Look at this
party that's on top of this hotel.

705
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:15,150
Look at these people are just having a
party in and it's drones flying over.

706
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:18,150
People start noticing the journey to
start throwing like beach balls at it and

707
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:23,060
stuff. They made in certain places where
it's legal to shoot them in Colorado.

708
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,700
There was a town in Colorado that past
some sort of a resolution that allow you

709
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:31,560
to shoot at drones. Wow. That's so,
yeah. It's going to be like a video game.

710
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:35,530
We're going to have be like shooting
drones everyday. Here's comminsure.

711
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:39,300
Look about going above the comedy
store. I've been there. Yeah.

712
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,200
Top of the,
this uh,

713
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,500
Colorado town.
Apparently they're just considering it.

714
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,210
They haven't done it totally as
of March 31st but it's deer trail,

715
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:53,160
Colorado and uh,

716
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,970
there's 563 people in the town.
They're worried about it.

717
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,880
You should be worried about
getting it up to 600 people.

718
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,050
You're fucking town as tiny as shit.
Your town isn't even a small theater.

719
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,510
That's ridiculous.
How do you guys have your own laws?

720
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:11,770
That seems preposterous that a town that
little like you driving through and the

721
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:13,960
law changes and then you go to the
other side, the law's different.

722
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:17,830
Get the fuck out of here. The law is
different in that you've got 563 people.

723
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:21,050
That's a cult. Okay. That's
a cult. You got a call.

724
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,170
You do not have a town.
You fucking Weirdos.

725
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,390
They probably just made
it legal for witches.

726
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,620
All right.
We'll allow witchcraft for now.

727
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,110
But those drones are the devil.
Robot

728
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:40,250
drove my bridging those
flying robot, which is out of
here on their flying robot.

729
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,020
Broomstick.
Well there's these two

730
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:46,500
towns in Colorado. One is Greeley
and one is a right next to it.

731
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:48,750
I kind of can't remember the
name of the one next to it.

732
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,380
Deer valley or some shit, whatever
it is. The one next to it,

733
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:56,830
it braced we'd like in a big way where
they're just got fucking dispensary's

734
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,000
opening up everywhere and giant
warehouses have right next to it.

735
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:00,691
There's Greeley,

736
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:04,770
Colorado and they had the CNBC show and
it was hilarious because they had this

737
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:08,400
guy who was like the sheriff of Greeley
who wouldn't allow it and it was like,

738
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,470
you know, I'm telling you,
there's been a lot of things.

739
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,360
I shows you 80 with marijuana now.

740
00:42:12,361 --> 00:42:16,920
Like we're noticing long
term psychiatric issues,

741
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:20,610
but her habit and you listened to this
guy talk and he's like some old fucking

742
00:42:20,611 --> 00:42:25,310
cowboy, right? Some crazy old cowboy who
doesn't realize the war is over. Yeah.

743
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,100
The fucking the guys like standard.
Well, you're, no, no, no. Psych,

744
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,280
psychiatric issues. What
about booze? You Fuck?

745
00:42:32,281 --> 00:42:35,640
What about cigarettes and the
beatings you took in the boxing gym?

746
00:42:35,641 --> 00:42:39,390
Should all that be illegal? You fucking
crazy asshole. Look at these people.

747
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:43,320
They're having a blast right next
door. Go over to that place. Go,

748
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:45,380
go check out what they're doing.
They're fucking dancing.

749
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,880
This treat and hugging each other.
Everybody's high as fuck.

750
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:51,870
They're making millions. They're
making millions and you're like, well,

751
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:55,870
your bum loan. Oh, the
psychological issues due to marrow.

752
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:00,180
There's no psychological issues
due to fucking playing cards. Okay.

753
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:04,650
People are nuts. We don't, we're not
perfect. The idea that weed is the one,

754
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,920
what's the fucking sending these
psychological issues, people over the top.

755
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:12,180
How dare you?
How dare you make that association?

756
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,000
Especially since you know, stress is
such a huge factor of psychologic shit.

757
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:21,590
The number, it has to be the number one
cause of psychological issues. Stress.

758
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,950
Not to mention physical people don't
really realize the reason why hearts give

759
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:28,880
out is because of stress.
That's all the years of stress.
I mean, yeah, you get old,

760
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:32,000
but it's still stressed.
Stress on the heart and stress stress.

761
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,420
So it's so funny that that's a stance
like marijuana causing psychological

762
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:38,150
issues when,

763
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,610
well the problem Tony Hinchcliffe
with your kind of thinking needs,

764
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:42,800
we have data to back up our assertions.

765
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:47,801
It shows a clear change in the human
brain we hear is the area that accepts

766
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:52,850
bullshit shrinks. Okay, we
need that plump and fat,

767
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:57,920
but that area is not like fog. Why? We
need it like, like off filled sponge.

768
00:43:57,921 --> 00:43:58,461
That's what we need.

769
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:03,461
That the area that allows bullshit and
the marijuana is shrinking this area that

770
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:07,460
allows you to tolerate bullshit and I
don't like it. I don't, I do not like it.

771
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,930
We need people out there that can do,
could just suck in our bullshit and pro.

772
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,920
It's like a bullshit liver. That's what
it is. You'll give a bullshit liver,

773
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,060
liver for booze.

774
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:19,910
You also have a bullshit liver in your
brain and marijuana apparently makes it

775
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:21,560
thing shrink.
That's what I heard.

776
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,860
Wow. They try everything. They've
tried it, they try everything.

777
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:27,420
This scare marijuana smokers.

778
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,670
Why? Why is that? They should just
smoke weed and get their dick sucked.

779
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,050
They would change the way they feel
about all this. They'd be like,

780
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:38,660
I can't believe blowjobs feel so good,
dude. Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,

781
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,820
dude.
It's from someone who loves you.

782
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,820
Who tickles your balls when
you come in their mouth? Hey,

783
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,660
while you're high Jesus Louisa's okay.
They don't know about that.

784
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,180
Did they know about that?
Cause if they do, you know,

785
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:54,060
I would imagine if you're a way the
sheriff at Greenlee knows about that.

786
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,300
If you're a girl and you smoke a couple
of hits a weed and then get your pussy

787
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,760
licked,
that's kind of feels so good.

788
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,440
Could you imagine like a shower
feels good when you're high,

789
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,280
you can imagine how good it feels for
girl. Do you like your ass licked?

790
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,170
Do I like my ass? Like, yeah, listen.

791
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:07,890
Hi.

792
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:12,890
How are you never going to
have this conversation right
now then is here is here

793
00:45:15,411 --> 00:45:19,520
with you?
I'm not opening those doors.

794
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,630
What kind of a man asks another man?

795
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,980
This is like a fill out form for
a fucking gang bang video. Okay.

796
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,980
Now do you like getting your ass luck?
Because if yes,

797
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:33,350
checked the box to the right,
that should never come up.

798
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:36,950
You should go from you cradle to the
grave without anybody ever asking you do

799
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:37,880
you like it in your ass lights,

800
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,370
right?
Or maybe maybe that should be it.

801
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,990
That should be a fun thing about a funeral
is you have to write the answer yes

802
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,830
or no, like on a piece of paper and then
have it in your hand. Like when you're

803
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,730
like in the open casket,
I secretly love you.

804
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,660
Did you check his note? That was the
yes, with two exclamation points.

805
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,070
He really like
the problem with the question.

806
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,600
Do you like your ass is that's
not how anybody ever asks it.

807
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:05,950
If they're going to lick your ass right.
They don't go.

808
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:08,200
Do you like to get your ass looked?
They don't say that.

809
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,840
They would say do you want me to
lick your ass? Huh? You do. Huh?

810
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,840
They would have a lot of hugs in there.
Like you want me to look your ass? Huh?

811
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,850
You do?
Huh?

812
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:18,300
Like they're already affirming it
cause it's a risky thing to say like,

813
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:21,820
you want me to lick your ass?
Huh? Let me try it again, Joe.

814
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,260
This is an affirmation in it. You
know, it's like you, you want to,

815
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,300
we want that person to have
an easy time saying yes,

816
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,190
you want me to look at your ass and
you go, well that would be cool.

817
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:38,060
You fucking sick.
Fuck fuck you like checked you asshole.

818
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,110
Right, right. The bedroom opens
up, the camera crew comes in,

819
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,570
you've been on the new show, do you want
your ass hole? And then it becomes, sounds

820
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,010
like a big court case where
they try to figure out what the,

821
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:52,410
what ha means when you add hod to it
and then the lawyer tries to defend it

822
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,770
clearly if she used
the word, Huh? She was,

823
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,740
she was trying to get a
positive affirmation out of him.

824
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,070
She was manipulating
his emotional responses,

825
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:05,550
the natural responses of a person.
He was doing it to be polite.

826
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:08,370
You didn't really want
his ass select okay.

827
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,270
He didn't want her to feel bad and she
said, ha already. It's like, yeah, okay.

828
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:17,000
What as it was happening, he was
realizing he had made a mistake. You know,

829
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,000
it'd be like joining an army that thinks
they're going to go out and fight big

830
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:23,070
foot. Like you got all your fucking gear
and you're ready to go to the mountains.

831
00:47:23,071 --> 00:47:27,600
Like we are the Sasquatch.
And He'd be like, Oh, what
have I done? What have I done?

832
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,910
I can't believe I'm going to go. This
is an army of people I've joined. Fuck,

833
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:34,270
I made a mistake.
Shit be can't pull out of it.

834
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,930
That's what it's gotta be like.
It's crazy.

835
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,750
Poor guy, Greeley, Colorado.
It put bastard right next door.

836
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:48,100
I forget what the other cities name.

837
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,460
Is that the, is that the same place that
shoots down the drones? Is there, is it

838
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:54,590
no different place, but the, the
other place, the name, they were,

839
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:58,670
those people were so high that I forgot
their name. That's how high they were.

840
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,340
Like the mayor of the town
was joking around about it.

841
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:04,180
They had the mayor of the town and this
interview start joking around about this

842
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,820
town's always been like that. Like
Greeley was at drive town back in the day.

843
00:48:07,821 --> 00:48:08,810
He couldn't get booze.

844
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:13,550
We don't want no booze because what
we see you and we have tenants in the

845
00:48:13,551 --> 00:48:16,280
church. That's a bunch of crazy
people. That's what that is.

846
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,900
A lot of hooting and hollering.

847
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:20,050
The reason why they're
afraid of booze and pot,

848
00:48:20,051 --> 00:48:23,200
if they're that afraid of it is because
they're afraid. What they'll do with,

849
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:26,530
they have a drink or a smoke.
They're afraid that that inner monster,

850
00:48:26,531 --> 00:48:29,920
whatever their fears and whatever crazy
stuff's going on, that's what that is.

851
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,450
Well, no, no, no. Tony Hinchcliffe,

852
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:34,900
I'm worried about your inner monster
cause my inner monster is safe under the

853
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:35,770
guidance of the Lord.

854
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,580
So you're a heathen out there running
around with your own ideas and I got

855
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:41,090
children. Okay, Tony Hawk,

856
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,460
I have bad news for you.

857
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,690
You're going and praying to an
imaginary creature once or twice a week.

858
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:48,760
You fucking communists,
lesbian asshole.

859
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:55,240
Listen, you can't say that it's imaginary.
You don't know you son of a bitch.

860
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,990
I go to church, I feel the Holy
Spirit inside of me all the time.

861
00:48:58,991 --> 00:49:02,050
I moved to tongues. You haven't
moved to tongues, Tony Hinchcliffe,

862
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,520
then your priest, he drinks wine. I
mean Jesus turned water into wine.

863
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,390
You don't want to, I'm going to get your
athletic, sir. I'm a baptist. Baptist.

864
00:49:09,391 --> 00:49:12,510
We don't, we don't fuck around with
wine. You can't have wine in the church.

865
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,970
That's true. They don't drink
wine. I don't believe so.

866
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,200
I think the wine is a Catholic thing.
Let's find out. It was a Google day.

867
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,850
Do Baptist use one? Hmm. I
know the Catholics love wine

868
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,710
nature. They try any excuse
like, Hey, can we get the,

869
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:31,090
well, you know what's really funny? Um,
Mormons are not supposed to drink coffee,

870
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:36,190
but they can drink those
energy drinks. I'm sorry. I do
like, dude, he was a Mormon.

871
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:40,930
Well you sell pound those fucking giant
monster energy drinks and the dude would

872
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:45,640
have panic attacks all the time. It was
just jack to the teeth all day. Just

873
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,000
red lining it all day.

874
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,430
This gives me, he has no idea
cause never having coffee. Right.

875
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:01,420
He wouldn't drink the coffee, but yet
he's pounding. Is it an evil being right?

876
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:06,510
There was an evil being out there and
it's corrupt in the souls of red bull

877
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:12,100
gives me wings. Just like the angels have
more. Exactly. Exactly. Mormon religion.

878
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,390
A drink, a monster energy drink to
be a Munster against Satan's urges.

879
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,510
Monstrously attack you.

880
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,740
Nothing funnier than Mormonism.
There is, you know the,

881
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:26,220
when they think that when you die, you
get your own planet. You know that, right?

882
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,080
Um, how do you know you don't Tony?
Hinchcliffe. Okay. Why so judgmental,

883
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:33,560
Tony Hinchcliffe and that everybody lives
on their own different planet and then

884
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:37,550
like, well yeah, it'd be dope,
but that's a made up story.

885
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,780
It's only dope. If we could visit
each other. I can wait. Sorry.

886
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,860
Like you were on the moon and I was
on Mars, but I couldn't get to you.

887
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:48,890
I'd be like, Tony, where are
you? But I'm sure in this world,

888
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:51,860
like traveling is like just so fast.

889
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:52,321
Yeah.

890
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:55,590
It's probably pretty quick if you can
get to a place where you have your own

891
00:50:55,591 --> 00:50:57,570
planet.
I assume you just be wherever you want.

892
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,560
Whenever you want to be there
instantaneous. That'll happen one day.

893
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:04,800
We'll figure that out. We'll be
figuring out how to transport ourselves.

894
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:09,610
If human beings live for another
million years, if we live,

895
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:14,520
we're supposedly like
this close to like this,

896
00:51:14,521 --> 00:51:17,610
this frame that we're in right now,
the Homosapien, the way we look,

897
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:22,800
it's supposedly pretty similar to what
a million years ago. It looked like,

898
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,490
like a million years ago. There was
some [inaudible] man kind of stood up,

899
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:31,260
but fairly similar, you know, and
then maybe in this form, you know,

900
00:51:31,261 --> 00:51:33,730
a few hundred thousand years, three
or 400,000 years. Like I said,

901
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,700
there's a lot of guesswork
involved and figured it out.

902
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:40,680
But if we could keep going another
million, we would be hairless for sure.

903
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,700
We'd lose our hair.

904
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,530
We would probably be really slight
and very Tony Hinchcliffe like like a

905
00:51:46,531 --> 00:51:49,500
dancer's Physique and alien
dancer and I heads would grow.

906
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:53,370
We would look like fucking aliens
and then hit. We hit that point.

907
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,980
If we continue,
if we don't blow each other up,

908
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,470
if we continue and we don't
get hit by an asteroid,

909
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:02,850
we continue to improve our ability
to do things. We'll, it'd be nuts.

910
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,140
A million years from now, you probably
will be able to transport any or teleport

911
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,340
anywhere you want anywhere in the world.
I want up yet,

912
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:12,040
I'll bet a hundred thousand
years at this rate,

913
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,240
he's Tony Hinchcliffe at this rate
that we're growing with technology.

914
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:18,730
I think we're even closer.

915
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,310
I would almost say 10,000 years,

916
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:27,820
thousand years ago, that sounds
really dumb, but if 10,000 years ago,

917
00:52:27,821 --> 00:52:30,220
it doesn't seem like that long ago,
but that's a really long,

918
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,200
like 10,000 years ago,

919
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:36,310
we find these like stone buildings that
they made a bunch of really cool shit

920
00:52:36,311 --> 00:52:39,970
that they left behind,
but not much else.

921
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,180
Dozen years ago.
I don't even think people are on boats.

922
00:52:42,181 --> 00:52:44,350
They didn't even figure that out yet.
They did

923
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:44,651
there.

924
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:48,130
They're finding out that people figured
out a lot of shit a lot earlier than we

925
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,220
thought. In fact, 40,000
years ago they were hunting.

926
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,940
There were a fishing for tuna and boats,
which is pretty cool.

927
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,180
Pretty sure that was the number that they
came up with cause they found these uh,

928
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,920
these deep sea rigs,
you know,

929
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:02,830
whether you use these long lines and at
these big hooks and they were catching

930
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:06,130
tuna and they found tune in DNA,
which is really crazy.

931
00:53:06,131 --> 00:53:10,690
Like tuner deep water fish. So these
fuckers, let me find out what year it was.

932
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,420
They figured out,
let me see.

933
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:17,100
What would Google their ancient people
fish for tuna. A sitting on a yoga ball.

934
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,770
Now know what it is. That
chair. It's interesting.

935
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:26,280
It's a fuck back support. Who needs
it? No, this is this the best um,

936
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,060
back support was for me at least it
forces you to stand, sit straight.

937
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,680
Like see how I'm sitting. Like this
is how you're supposed to set, right.

938
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,120
You're supposed to sit like this. Like
your head's not supposed to be forward.

939
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,820
And when you,
most times you sit in the chair,

940
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,850
you wind up slumping sitting like that
and then it makes your back really tight.

941
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,050
Since I've been using this, my back
never fucks with me when we do podcasts.

942
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,340
That's awesome. Yeah, you just, you,
you sit on it and your knees are in it.

943
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,920
I don't know what they're called,
like a new chair or something like that,

944
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,780
but you just,
you're,

945
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:57,990
you're carrying your own weight and
then once you do it for a while,

946
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,120
if you get used to it,
then he started doing it everywhere.

947
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:04,980
Like I do it on planes, I do it and you
should sit up straight like all the time.

948
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:08,040
And when you don't, when you have bad
posture, I used to think that people said,

949
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:10,410
Oh, you should watch your
posture because it like,

950
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,920
they didn't want you to look in lazy,
but it's actually not good for your discs.

951
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,960
Like your,
your shit gets compressed.

952
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,940
That's why I wouldn't
do to have a fat wallet.

953
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,060
They say never keep a fat wallet in your
back pocket if you're one of those guys

954
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:23,930
that keeps every God damn business
car that you ever get when we're sad,

955
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,940
broken toys r us $10 off you,

956
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,250
you get these big fat, crazy
thick wallets. If you sit
on that shit all the time,

957
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,440
you can get disc problems.

958
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:37,320
Like a lot of cab drivers get psychotic
nerve problems because they get a pinch

959
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:41,670
disk because your body's just got an
uneven distribution of weight and that's

960
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:43,920
what it is. Kind of when
you're slumped or sit in weird,

961
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:45,660
you know it's an uneven
distribution of weight.

962
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:49,310
I have that 100% anytime I go on a
road trip now after like two hours,

963
00:54:49,311 --> 00:54:52,940
my right side gets starts getting numb
and I start, I start having like little,

964
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,220
do you sit on your wallet?
No I don't,

965
00:54:55,221 --> 00:54:58,880
but it's like how I sit and also
my max lunch or I'm a turtle.

966
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,550
Yeah,
you shouldn't do that man.

967
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:03,680
I used to think that it was
just that like slouching. I,

968
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:08,260
I had a real problem with slouching. I
slouch all the time and I just, I think,

969
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,500
I thought it was just like
the way it looks is not good,

970
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,230
but people don't like the way it looks
like. So my attitude was, fuck man,

971
00:55:14,231 --> 00:55:17,500
let's go. So stupid. But
it's just not your, when you,

972
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,770
when your back is straight like this,
like this is the way you're not,

973
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:23,230
you're supposed to stand your,
your spinal column,

974
00:55:23,231 --> 00:55:26,980
your core is carrying your weight
very evenly. It's all stacked up.

975
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:30,400
But when you're head goes
forward and you sort of relax,

976
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:35,320
you put a great deal of pressure
on other parts. You put like, uh,

977
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:39,760
there's like a peak area of your
spine that has additional pressure,

978
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:43,510
it seems like nothing and it is nothing
for a long time and then it becomes

979
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:44,344
something.

980
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,490
And if you sit like I used to get real
bad back and neck pains from writing and

981
00:55:48,491 --> 00:55:51,460
I think I might've fucked myself up
doing that as much as I fucked myself up

982
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:52,330
from doing Jujitsu.

983
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,570
Cause I would write for a long period
of time and I would sit in a chair like

984
00:55:55,571 --> 00:55:59,590
this when my head forward and then
when I was all done I'd be like, ah,

985
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,020
my neck would be fucking killing me.

986
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,990
I just don't like sitting like this
cause I feel like I'm like posing like a

987
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:08,900
woman and I'm sure he correctly
pointed my button boobs.

988
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,290
I feel like I have to like look back
at it like I hate it or something.

989
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:14,020
So you're afraid of what the way it looks.
You'd rather just have a backache.

990
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,230
Right. You know, a backache. It's just
easier to deal with. But seriously,

991
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:20,720
it does look really silly
for me to sit like, hey,

992
00:56:20,721 --> 00:56:24,010
cause I mean my butt's sticking
out, my sticking out. Like
I feel like, uh, well you

993
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,030
need to reduce both of them.
That would help tremendously.

994
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:29,583
And

995
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:39,070
that's Brian Redbill. Right? Totally.

996
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,790
I don't want to lose my, my
boobs and my butt. Uh, you know,

997
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:46,330
I've been working on this. So he lost
a lot of weight and got real slim.

998
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:49,690
It's like, it makes my head look too big.
Fuck. And he's just kind of like a free

999
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,720
spin. All this work to get down
to like 160 something pounds.

1000
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:57,170
He was like super skinny.
Yeah.

1001
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,430
I have a picture of me and you together
and I looked like a fucking lego boy.

1002
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:05,140
She don't look like a Lego boy,
dude. You just, you look healthy.

1003
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:08,230
I look like at an aids.
Remember everyone called me aids

1004
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:12,580
so quick. You did. It's not everyone.

1005
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:17,230
You're at the post office and drop
off some packages. Okay. AIDS face.

1006
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:21,910
Alright, you aids face. Yeah. Starbucks.

1007
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:27,790
Venti Mocha Latte. AIDS face.
Okay. They write it on your cup.

1008
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,410
It didn't look like he had aids.
Dude,

1009
00:57:30,411 --> 00:57:33,110
what it looked like to me was a guy
who lost weight. He looked healthy.

1010
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,410
That's when we met Seth
Rogen. That's right. Yeah.

1011
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,220
We did the high times music awards.
What is it? High Times awards.

1012
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:44,100
I presented him with stoner of the
year and there was Jack [inaudible],

1013
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,230
Jack hair or hair or when he was alive
back then. Those things are interesting.

1014
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,440
Those fucking high times awards.
She meet all of the fellow stoners,

1015
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:55,850
not maybe the nicest people on the planet,
like celebrity stoners, like be real.

1016
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:58,160
Is there a nicer person
and be real that guys,

1017
00:57:58,161 --> 00:58:00,650
one of the nicest people on the
planet and all those celebrities,

1018
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:05,390
stoners and all like super
cool. Doug Benson, sweetheart,
you know? Yeah, I'll just,

1019
00:58:05,391 --> 00:58:08,150
all the celebrities,
stoners are just super nice people.

1020
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,780
Why anybody would want to stop a
drug like that? Well, you know,

1021
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,360
I'll tell you the problem with that.
Well,

1022
00:58:14,361 --> 00:58:19,130
you're not taking into account as
a lack of ambition. You stoners,

1023
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,480
they did take up, you know, a lot of room
and they don't do anything. They don't,

1024
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,190
they don't earn their keep it.
Sheriff.

1025
00:58:25,191 --> 00:58:29,510
What about all the artists and the
musicians that have come from my pot smoke

1026
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:34,160
pot? You mean queers like Steve Jobs?
Is that you're just trying to say? Yeah,

1027
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:38,630
Jesus took him from us. Let me tell
you something. Jesus not impressed.

1028
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,610
He didn't do you know what? It
looked like? AIDS face there.

1029
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:43,270
You look good and it looked like no,

1030
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:47,300
you're just not used to it cause you're
used to this backup. You saw the support,

1031
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:51,140
you got your head and then he got some
backup. When you're potty shrinks up,

1032
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,760
you felt like you didn't have any backup.
Your head just didn't.

1033
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:58,350
Aw, Brian. Dude, you don't
look bad there at all.

1034
00:58:58,351 --> 00:59:01,950
You look great. You want to have
sex. You know I've told you before.

1035
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:06,420
Why does everything that skinny
with you mean gay? That's so weird.

1036
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,240
This has got issues.
I just looked like I had aids.

1037
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:12,730
You don't look like you have aids. HIV.
You don't even look again for each of it.

1038
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:16,800
You'll get diarrhea like a little
bit like you got to that phase,

1039
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,500
dude. Come on, look at that
picture. You don't look at all,

1040
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,040
it's the dude from weeds. But look at
your face. You do not look bad at all.

1041
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,580
I couldn't, I can't watch weeds.
I watched one episode and um, uh,

1042
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,870
who the fuck was on it? One
of our, our friends was on.

1043
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,900
Oh, uh, who was on it? Kevin Nealon.

1044
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,960
Bright Ernst Brennan or
answers all. Yes. Right.

1045
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:42,200
What did he play like a drug dealer
drug dealer. And I watched it

1046
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,310
is Bret was on it. That's it. I watched
it one of the time when I was like,

1047
00:59:45,311 --> 00:59:49,060
this is fake. This is not
real. Not buying them.

1048
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,340
No,
it's fake is that catfish show.

1049
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:54,640
I heard so many people to say how
awesome that show is. I finally watch it.

1050
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:59,630
The fake his show I've ever seen. I
didn't know it was fake. You know?

1051
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:03,490
I heard on reality TV sometimes
they like playing that shit out,

1052
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:06,040
like it's not really reality.
Did you hear that Tony? Well,

1053
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:09,940
it almost seems like it would benefit them
with so much money. Spending money on,

1054
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,720
wait a minute. Conspiracy
Theorists, the would,

1055
01:00:13,721 --> 01:00:15,880
they would do two just to make money,

1056
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,050
willing to fake it and
risk their reputations on.

1057
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:23,950
That's a reality show. When I tune
into a reality show, I want reality.

1058
01:00:23,951 --> 01:00:27,770
You know that and I know that. That's
a weird one to fake though. You know,

1059
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:31,110
that is just fucking pizza.
Best one to fit all that.

1060
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:36,490
They couldn't really figure out how
easy it is, like what they're doing.

1061
01:00:36,491 --> 01:00:40,330
Like people just looking at a camera
like I thought for sure that he was,

1062
01:00:40,331 --> 01:00:42,160
you know,
the man that I thought

1063
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,700
did, people will do whatever
the fuck you asked them to do.

1064
01:00:44,701 --> 01:00:45,840
If you have a camera in front of you,

1065
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:47,790
I mean there's a certain amount
of people that will do it.

1066
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:52,050
So if you have some sort of reality show
and you just manipulate these people

1067
01:00:52,051 --> 01:00:54,220
and say, Hey, I want you to,
this is what you're going to do.

1068
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:58,950
Are you going to tell us they know that
you been texting this guy and pretending

1069
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:02,220
to be a girl and then you're gonna
meet him here and say, I busted you do.

1070
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,640
Now I know what's up. And the
guy's like, okay, okay. Okay.

1071
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,910
How long have I known him? You've been
friends for 20 years. Okay, okay, okay.

1072
01:01:08,911 --> 01:01:12,240
We've been friends for 20 years, men
and they'll say shit like that, man.

1073
01:01:12,241 --> 01:01:14,460
We'd been friends for 20 years.
I thought I trusted you.

1074
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,210
Of course they going to fit all that
Maury Povich and stuff like that.

1075
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,150
That shows still when I'm on the road
and I'm flipping through channels,

1076
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:25,430
I'll stop for a few minutes
and I'll watch Maury, I'll,

1077
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:29,840
I'll watch the results because no
matter what, no matter what happens,

1078
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:32,540
one of them is going to get
up and go, oh, I told you,

1079
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:36,650
I told you that that was or wasn't
my baby. Like whichever one,

1080
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:40,100
one of them's going to flip out because
they, you know, it's just so coached.

1081
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,890
She was a doorman at, um, uh, not
east side comedy club, governors,

1082
01:01:44,891 --> 01:01:46,810
governors in Levittown in Long Island.

1083
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:51,430
And one of the doorman was a regular
on those shows back in the day. Like,

1084
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:55,780
this is the 19,
I want to say 1990,

1085
01:01:55,781 --> 01:01:59,500
1991 pre internet. And he used
to get a call and they would say,

1086
01:01:59,501 --> 01:02:03,670
we're looking for a man who has been
having sex with his brother's wife.

1087
01:02:03,671 --> 01:02:06,970
And he goes, what a coincidence. I've
been having sex, my brother's wife,

1088
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:09,440
what do you want me to do? And
they would, they would you,

1089
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:12,520
they would literally say that to him,
see if you can help us out here.

1090
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:13,930
That was the conversation that would have,

1091
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:19,120
what we're trying to find is a guy who
got arrested wearing women's clothes,

1092
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,680
trying to get a job in a woman's office
and they go, oh, what a coincidence. That,

1093
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:25,740
you know, they'll tell him the
exact scenario that he wants.

1094
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,200
So all those people are just,
they're just good at it.

1095
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:31,980
You'll see the Mike Rekha did it.
Mike Rekha did it way back in the day.

1096
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:32,460
Mike Ricco,

1097
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,610
who was a comic at the comedy store in
the 1990s he did that Shit for money.

1098
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:39,900
I met Mike. Yeah. Mike is Funny Dude,
man. Mike was a funny dude. You know,

1099
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:42,940
I don't know if he's still doing stand
up anymore, but back in the day when we,

1100
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,500
we started out together at the store
in the 90s he was fucking funny man.

1101
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:50,220
There's a lot of those guys that
for whatever reason, you know,

1102
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:51,690
people don't find out about them.

1103
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:52,370
Yeah.

1104
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:56,350
He's one of those guys that was there
the first a few months when I started and

1105
01:02:56,351 --> 01:03:00,970
we like made friends and then I watched
him basically quit. Yeah. I mean, I, he,

1106
01:03:00,971 --> 01:03:03,900
I know, I think he moved
somewhere else, but I, you know,

1107
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,010
I watched him fade out of the store.

1108
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,870
Yeah. But anyway, he used to do that
shit. They would hire him to do,

1109
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,610
like I remember when,
um,

1110
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:16,560
what was the chick Jenny Jones was that
it that check whether the show remember

1111
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:17,160
and they,

1112
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:22,110
they did a thing where they humiliated
this guy because there was a gay guy that

1113
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:25,890
he worked with that was a
in love with him. And so he,

1114
01:03:25,891 --> 01:03:27,960
the guy comes on and uh,

1115
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,840
he has no idea that this gay guy
loves them and he freaks out.

1116
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:33,360
He gets humiliated on the show and then
he goes and shoots the guy afterwards

1117
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:36,870
and they were like,
that's a wrap for you.

1118
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,400
And they just cease and desist the
entire show. But that show was a,

1119
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:43,560
that was a turning point. And
those things, they realize, okay,

1120
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:47,600
this isn't fucking repercussions to the
shit like you guys are. But in that,

1121
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,560
that's when stuff started getting more
produced. Like they realize that exist.

1122
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,600
They got to tell the person before,

1123
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,660
right? Yeah. When they
did the Jenny Jones thing,

1124
01:03:56,690 --> 01:04:00,890
that was a real guy and a real office
who was attracted to his coworker.

1125
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:04,430
And when that guy was on TV with them,
this nutty dude,

1126
01:04:04,431 --> 01:04:08,000
he wound up shooting the guy. You know,
he was just humiliated beyond words.

1127
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,510
But where's like if you were on there and
you found out some guy at work thought

1128
01:04:11,511 --> 01:04:14,330
you were hot, you'd be uncomfortable,
but he would, he would find it hilarious.

1129
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:18,110
Right. And you would, you'd probably
have an issue cause dudes can get creepy.

1130
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,730
And you know,
if you were a girl,

1131
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,330
you got on a show and you found
out that your coworker loves you,

1132
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:26,180
there'll be a real problem.
You know, if you a girl,

1133
01:04:26,181 --> 01:04:27,680
say if you worked in some office,

1134
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:31,760
maybe even have a boyfriend or a
husband and you got some guy who's your

1135
01:04:31,761 --> 01:04:34,250
coworker who not only
professors his love to you,

1136
01:04:34,251 --> 01:04:38,360
but does so on national television in
a surprise attack. Yeah. You'd be like,

1137
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:39,470
oh great,

1138
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,720
now I got to fucking stop working there
or he's going to stop working there or

1139
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:43,380
something's gonna happen.

1140
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,080
Yeah. It is a weird approach,
especially when you factor in that.

1141
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,270
That guy probably told the gay guy,

1142
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:53,070
probably told the guy on Jenny Jones on
the air so that nothing would happen to

1143
01:04:53,071 --> 01:04:56,790
him. You know? He didn't tell him at the
office like, hey man, I really like you.

1144
01:04:56,791 --> 01:05:00,450
Please don't hit me.
He went on the air and that backfired.

1145
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,980
Yeah. I guess he probably thought, look,

1146
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,740
I'm going to be on TV with the fucking
is going to happen to me. All right.

1147
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:08,280
I'm going to be on television. Nothing
can happen. It's not going to hurt me.

1148
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:11,540
No one's going to hurt me. Jen
on television. Yeah. Jenny Jones.

1149
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:13,920
Careers just going to keep going on.
The show's going to keep going.

1150
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:16,800
Everything's going to be fine.
Jim Jones is a talent. Yeah. Okay.

1151
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,980
You're not going to stop her with

1152
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,220
one little scandal. Right. It's
going to be back stronger than ever.

1153
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:25,420
America demands change. John's. Yeah. She
used to have a show that she would do.

1154
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,310
She was a comic. Oh Wow. I didn't
know she used to have, yeah,

1155
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,390
she used to do a show back in the day.
If you go to Jenny Jones,

1156
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,870
like the early stuff, it's crazy cause
she had this crazy but bulletproof hairdo,

1157
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:40,290
these big giant like huge sprayed up
hairdo and she would do these ladies only

1158
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:44,530
shows. And when I was living in
Boston, there was a club, uh,

1159
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,170
I don't know if it was the
Kami connection or it was,

1160
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,330
it was either duck soup or the improv
because it was the upscale there.

1161
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:55,510
They had an upscale club and she would a
buy out every seat and there was no men

1162
01:05:55,511 --> 01:05:58,090
who are allowed in the building.
The, the guys couldn't work.

1163
01:05:58,091 --> 01:06:01,390
The bar guys couldn't work the door. They
had to have like all female employees,

1164
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:04,420
females in the whole thing
would be filled with females.

1165
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,250
And so they did it as
sort of like a gimmick.

1166
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:10,090
And they had these all female shows with
Jenny Jones and talk about her period.

1167
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,820
Wow.
Or whatever

1168
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:16,770
men stuff were things that men
want to hear. That's, but that's a,

1169
01:06:16,771 --> 01:06:21,070
the when the guy fucked with
her or that's when the, um,

1170
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,710
the guy I fucked with the
other guy rather, and uh,

1171
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,310
told them that he was in love with them.
But if you go back to her stand up,

1172
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,340
you'll see her crazy hair. When,
when they had her on the talk show,

1173
01:06:30,341 --> 01:06:34,350
she kind of toned it down and her
hair became like normal sized. Yeah.

1174
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:38,770
But before it was like some tribal thing
she had before she was on TVs. Yeah.

1175
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:42,900
She has like some trouble
peacock thing going on. Oh yeah.

1176
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,590
There's network head. Say, oh, we're going
to put you in hair and makeup. No, no.

1177
01:06:46,591 --> 01:06:50,700
Stan is that stand up. Yeah. She
supposedly on this Ferris guys,

1178
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:55,060
look at that POW man.
Good Lord.

1179
01:06:55,560 --> 01:07:00,510
It's like David Bowie. That's
like rock stars here. Some of it.

1180
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,730
He's a good eye doctor though.

1181
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:06,660
And she's hot.
Yeah,

1182
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:10,570
Mr. Jokes around the country. I feel
like kind of a spokesperson for women.

1183
01:07:10,571 --> 01:07:12,910
I think men should listen to me. I think
you guys can learn something really.

1184
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:15,790
You wanna know what I find
attractive on a man? Cash.

1185
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,130
Okay.

1186
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:20,020
I hate you. Wear the
tight wise. Where are you?

1187
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,200
She looks like the top half of a sentence
and see what clothes looked like in

1188
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:26,080
the 60. [inaudible] the way she's
moving cause she's on those heels.

1189
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:29,260
It's just a balancing at
dinner at the sizzler.

1190
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,920
He forgot the coupons.
We had to go back.

1191
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,270
Oh my God. This is, they've
got an applause break.

1192
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:43,450
Stop this. Stop this right now.
This is CGI. CGI The king car.

1193
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,870
That's better. Sees you as a dire wolves
and game of Thrones. That's ridiculous.

1194
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:55,520
There's nothing worse than a fake
applause. Break like a bad one. Well,

1195
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,380
I mean the navy really loved her
and we're so happy to hear it.

1196
01:07:58,381 --> 01:08:02,200
Just get out of joke.
Oh you saw the movie punchline right?

1197
01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:05,790
With oh I tried to watch it the other
day and just see if there was like,

1198
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,160
there was parts in it that I remember
going. That was the, that was hilarious,

1199
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:13,330
but in the wrong reason. Yeah. Yeah. Well
that was before you did stand up. Right.

1200
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,070
And that was also like 10
when it came out. Yeah, I

1201
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,310
was, um, I was doing
standup when that came out.

1202
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:22,060
Like I was just starting to do stand
up and I remember watching going,

1203
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:26,110
what the fuck is this?
This is crazy. Like it's,

1204
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:29,030
it's weird when you watch someone do
something that you know they can't do.

1205
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:31,670
Like if I was ever gonna
like say if I did a movie,

1206
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,440
I'll never do a movie that
you'll have to play guitar.

1207
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:35,750
But if I did a movie where
I played guitar in it,

1208
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:37,670
I would learn how to fucking play guitar.
Okay.

1209
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:41,360
Cause if I was a guitar player and I
was watching some movie about Jimmy

1210
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,240
Hendrickson, the guy's
just like, all right,

1211
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:47,400
no, he doesn't know what he's doing. He's
just moving his fingers around. Yeah,

1212
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:48,890
I would,
I would be like this is annoying

1213
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,270
shit. I know he can't really play
guitar. This guy is faking it.

1214
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,670
Like if you watch him like some fake
Kung Fu in a movie, it's very good.

1215
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:57,830
It ruins the movie for you. Right. That's
why like in kill bill ever see that? Oh,

1216
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:02,831
you're a Tino sent everybody in that
assassination squad to Japan for like a

1217
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:07,820
month or two or three. Some crazy amount
of time. Learn. Kendo, learn all of it.

1218
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:11,540
They learn the art of the Samurai Sword.
They learned a Kung Fu.

1219
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,990
I mean big time like
from the guys for what?

1220
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:18,560
Main people from the actual
old school stuff. Well,

1221
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,360
you know David Lee Roth does that now.

1222
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:25,520
David Lee Roth lives in Japan and Take
Samurai lessons. That sounds awesome.

1223
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:28,190
That sounds amazing to Japan with his dog

1224
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:31,590
by himself.
Got An apartment and he takes Kendo.

1225
01:09:31,591 --> 01:09:34,920
Kendo is this Japanese sword fighting
and he practices sword fighting.

1226
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:39,810
That's so cool. Yeah. David
Lee Roth is a legit maniac.
He said, well, he's wild man.

1227
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:44,370
You know, doesn't give a fuck.
Having a great time doing Kendo.

1228
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,490
Playing sword fighting. One of the
biggest rock stars the world's ever known.

1229
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,420
And you knew those
Japanese people lose it.

1230
01:09:49,421 --> 01:09:51,970
If he comes into like their restaurant,
it's a bit of a

1231
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:56,590
jump jump.
Go ahead and jump.

1232
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:00,960
I bet not.

1233
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,520
I bet he sleeps links right in. You
know, because he dresses very low key.

1234
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:09,060
Like he wears overalls all the time
and like one of them paper Boi hats.

1235
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:12,900
He wears one of those things all the time.
So He's, I bet he just slinks around.

1236
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,750
It's gotta be so beautiful over
there and Japanese, Japanese culture.

1237
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:21,000
So smooth and relaxing and cool.
It's very different. That's for sure.

1238
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:25,260
That's one of the reasons why Japan,
if you go over there,

1239
01:10:25,261 --> 01:10:27,000
it feels like you're in another world.

1240
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:28,590
It doesn't just feel like
you're in another country.

1241
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,990
It feels like you're in another world.
Like the way people behave,

1242
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,810
like everybody's like really
polite. It's, it's very unusual.

1243
01:10:33,811 --> 01:10:35,820
They don't necessarily like white people,

1244
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:40,140
especially the old folks that were
around like during the Pearl Harbor days.

1245
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:44,430
You know, not, not a big fan of
white folks when it comes to that,

1246
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:47,820
but the rest of them, the young
kids love Americans, young people.

1247
01:10:47,821 --> 01:10:50,310
I guess most of those Pearl
Harbor people were dead.

1248
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:52,980
But how could you expect it
to not hate on Americans?

1249
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:56,220
They dropped two bombs on
them where the, yeah, we

1250
01:10:56,220 --> 01:11:00,620
messed up. We, yeah, we did that. That was
sort of an ouchie. That was a big ouch.

1251
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:03,650
That's a such a dick move.
Billy is,

1252
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,940
I mean we are the only people in the
world to really nuke another place. Right.

1253
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:12,070
We'd go to twice to do it once.
Sure.

1254
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:14,070
They weren't just shitty buildings.
Let's try

1255
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,920
the other one. Yeah, no, I think it was
the next day or something like that.

1256
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:21,350
Oh, oh, it was, you know, there's
one guy, because I read a thing.

1257
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:25,460
Here's one that's crazy for me. I read
a thing about the guy that was in both,

1258
01:11:25,461 --> 01:11:29,390
he was in Hiroshima, right. And
uh, he had to like go to work.

1259
01:11:29,391 --> 01:11:33,170
Like he barely survived or whatever was
on a train or something like that to

1260
01:11:33,171 --> 01:11:36,070
Nagasaki.
So he goes from here,

1261
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:39,860
she survives Hiroshima
and Nagasaki the next day.

1262
01:11:39,861 --> 01:11:42,250
And then same thing happens.

1263
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:47,240
Imagine the luck on that
guy. God, that's crazy.

1264
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,151
That's crazy.

1265
01:11:48,151 --> 01:11:52,650
And just imagine that time of the year
or that time of the world when you really

1266
01:11:52,651 --> 01:11:56,730
could just think that this could continue.
Like bombs could just be dropping now.

1267
01:11:56,731 --> 01:11:57,480
Like once we started,

1268
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,480
we were in the middle of a world war
and then all sudden cities are getting a

1269
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:05,100
level, like a whole city is
getting leveled. Hmm. I mean
how many people died? Those

1270
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,180
a lot.
And you know,

1271
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,710
another thing is that the one in
Hiroshima landed next to a hill.

1272
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,590
So like the hill actually
saved a lot of people.

1273
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,010
The,
okay.

1274
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:20,040
The atomic bomb killed between 90 and
166,000 within the first two to four

1275
01:12:21,461 --> 01:12:22,294
months,

1276
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:26,920
roughly half of the deaths in each city
occurred on the first day during the

1277
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,890
following month's large numbers died
from the effects of the burns, radiation,

1278
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:33,550
sickness and other injuries
compounded by illness. In both cities,

1279
01:12:33,551 --> 01:12:37,900
most of the dead were civilians,
although Hiroshima had a sizable garrison.

1280
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,280
Wow.
Crazy.

1281
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:45,710
Oh,
we got a shooter of the day

1282
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:52,250
shooting at Oregon high school to
confirmed dead. Oh, that's today.

1283
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,360
Yeah. Just now. Jesus Christ. Oh.

1284
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:57,830
Or what the hell is going on?

1285
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:01,490
Do you think it's getting going to
become where we all have to have guns.

1286
01:13:01,491 --> 01:13:02,860
We all have to carry guns.

1287
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:05,900
Just like star wars where we all
have our weapons all the time.

1288
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,760
All of us are going to
be one or the other.

1289
01:13:07,761 --> 01:13:10,820
Either it's going to be that or
it's going to be no guns. Right?

1290
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:15,590
August 6th was Hiroshima. August
9th was Nagasaki. So they waited.

1291
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:20,470
They waited a couple of days. God,
it's so scary. Yeah, yeah. Bold.

1292
01:13:20,471 --> 01:13:23,090
That's what the gun people are worried
about the gun people worried about.

1293
01:13:23,091 --> 01:13:23,331
You know,

1294
01:13:23,331 --> 01:13:26,390
they're just going to try and take our
guns away now and people are not going to

1295
01:13:26,391 --> 01:13:29,510
just give up their guns and they're going
to vote for people that are going to

1296
01:13:29,511 --> 01:13:32,450
be putting an offense. They're getting
sure that you don't put up their guns.

1297
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:36,650
And then the problem is those people
also get connected. Like if you,

1298
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:41,651
if you have a guy like say there's a
guy that says I am going to support the

1299
01:13:42,411 --> 01:13:46,250
second amendment, no matter what. Every
American has a right to bear arms.

1300
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:50,780
Everybody goes crazy. All the bear
arms, people are on that guy side now.

1301
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:51,530
So that guy,

1302
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:54,980
you can attach that guy to a bunch of
other shit you might not necessarily

1303
01:13:54,981 --> 01:13:55,814
believe in.

1304
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:59,720
Like you get attached to that guy to
a bunch of weird environmental shit

1305
01:13:59,721 --> 01:14:04,721
relaxing some of the environmental
regulations that are on certain areas that

1306
01:14:05,331 --> 01:14:09,050
are a bit risky to do certain things in
that might kill a bunch of fucking weird

1307
01:14:09,051 --> 01:14:11,060
fish. But whatever, whatever,
we can make a lot of money.

1308
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:15,040
There's those guys get
attached and corrupted in a
attached to all those things

1309
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:18,580
because you know that there's a sizeable
chunk of Americans that will vote to

1310
01:14:18,581 --> 01:14:19,414
keep their guns.

1311
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,810
And then there's also the people that are
on the other side of it that you know,

1312
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,200
they'd look, they'd, no matter what,
they're going to vote against guns.

1313
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,580
There's no matter what.
Like if you, if you're,

1314
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,330
we got to clean up these streets and
take these guns out of these schools,

1315
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:34,300
you hush. There's those people
and you've got those people.

1316
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:37,600
If you are an anti gun person, you
say, we need tighter regulations,

1317
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:41,220
we need tighter restrictions. We
need less guns, not more gone.

1318
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:46,840
You have those people. So, and then you
can attach that to a bunch of weird shit.

1319
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:50,200
It'd be weird social shit insurance
company scams where everybody has to get

1320
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:52,730
certain amounts of insurance and it kept,
can we swap my Omar,

1321
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:54,740
how about we have a,

1322
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:57,460
everybody has to wear your seatbelt
because we were paying out too much money.

1323
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:01,540
So they have regulations to protect you.
You have to wear a seatbelt.

1324
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,860
Well if I have to wear a seatbelt,

1325
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:07,060
how come this guy is allowed to
drive a motorcycle? Are you crazy?

1326
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:11,410
He doesn't even have a cage around him.
Like this doesn't make any sense. Okay.

1327
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,230
You make them wear help.
Congratulations. Make them wear helmets.

1328
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:19,420
I think it's way safer for me
in a car with no seatbelt on.

1329
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:22,180
And I'm not trying to argue for no
seat belts cause I always wear one.

1330
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:26,190
But I think it's way it probably way
safer to be in a car with no seatbelt than

1331
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,050
it is to be on a motorcycle
when there's an accident. Right.

1332
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:33,280
And in a lot of states they don't even
have to wear a helmet. No, no, Colorado,

1333
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:37,270
you don't, you don't have to in Vegas
either Ohio and that's a big one. Yeah,

1334
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:39,880
I think, uh, there's a
few, there's quite a few.

1335
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,970
I think it's because the
people that ride motorcycles,

1336
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:46,360
they love that feeling so much
that they're like, fuck it.

1337
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:47,680
I'm willing to risk my dead.

1338
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:51,100
Imagine that is like the wearing
a condom of the motorcycle world.

1339
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:55,610
It's like once you do it without one,
you're like fuck or that and that.

1340
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:56,620
You're absolutely right.

1341
01:15:56,621 --> 01:16:00,850
But nowadays with such great technology
with Bluetooth and phones and stereos

1342
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:01,810
and the helmets and stuff,

1343
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:05,830
I think more people are actually wearing
helmets because it's bad ass to take a

1344
01:16:05,831 --> 01:16:08,190
phone call while you,
it's in your helmet. Yeah.

1345
01:16:08,191 --> 01:16:10,510
I don't know about that dude
because the type of dudes who um,

1346
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,870
don't want to wear helmets, those
are like the Harley guys, you know,

1347
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,040
whether they don't want,
they just want

1348
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:22,540
their Bandanna floating in it and a
woman and a woman when her arms wrapped

1349
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:26,770
around my waist, I'm free. I got my red,
white and blue. They interrupt her. Him.

1350
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,760
Oh wait, is that a drone up in
the air? How much true maverick?

1351
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:35,500
I'm not like those faggots out there
pretending. Okay. I'm a true maverick.

1352
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:39,910
I vote Republican and I ride a motorcycle.
I'm a woman's,

1353
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:44,380
got some long nails like scratch my back
and I feel them pulling on the leather.

1354
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:49,150
My Mum,
my vest and my motorcycle club makes them,

1355
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,340
we'll up inside thinking
about all my other brothers,

1356
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:54,550
my brothers are out there on their metal
horses riding out into the sunset where

1357
01:16:54,551 --> 01:16:57,010
together we're a team.
We're a band of brothers.

1358
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:01,420
I ride my back and I bear arms
and I got the arms of a bear.

1359
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:09,200
Did you ever read a Hunter Thompson's
a thing on um, the motorcycle gangs?

1360
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,660
He wrote his first book,

1361
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:15,290
the big book that sort of introduced a
hundred Thompson to the world was his

1362
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,230
take on the hell's angels.
He was embedded in the hell's angels,

1363
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,400
like hung around with them, went with
them and he did it for a long time.

1364
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,140
He was with like for a couple of years,

1365
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:26,990
he was like embedded in the hell's angels
can go hang out with him at parties

1366
01:17:26,991 --> 01:17:28,710
and shit. But then, um,

1367
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,610
he got into an altercation because the
guy was beating up his girlfriend and

1368
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:34,490
hunter said something to him and the
guy beat the shit out of him too.

1369
01:17:34,491 --> 01:17:36,050
And a couple other guys beat
the shit out of them too.

1370
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:40,890
And then he wrote the book, the book
came out and everybody fucking, you know,

1371
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:41,990
went crazy for it.

1372
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:46,250
And that sort of the started a
hunters Thompson's Gonzo journalism,

1373
01:17:46,251 --> 01:17:48,470
he went from that,
which is more of,

1374
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:51,680
it's different if you compare it to his
other stuff. That's his first piece,

1375
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:55,850
which is more, it's still got
that sort of Gonzo edge to it,

1376
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:57,560
but it's more based in reality.

1377
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,140
Then like when he did fear
and loathing in Las Vegas,

1378
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:01,790
when he got the fear and
loathing in Las Vegas,

1379
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:05,960
that was originally supposed
to be something that he
wrote for ESPN and it was a

1380
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,460
covering like a motorcycle race. And
it was so fucking crazy that, you know,

1381
01:18:10,461 --> 01:18:12,050
they were like, we can't use this. And a,

1382
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:16,820
he turned it into like this novel and
that sort of kick started his Gonzo career

1383
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:21,470
that in Kentucky,
the Kentucky Derby,

1384
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:25,100
he wrote a piece on the Kentucky Derby
that was pretty fucking crazy too. But he,

1385
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:25,850
um,

1386
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:30,850
he was embedded with those fucking angels
for two years and he's got some wild

1387
01:18:30,981 --> 01:18:33,920
fucking stories, man orgies.
And those guys would live,

1388
01:18:33,921 --> 01:18:36,110
would be like kiss each other whenever
they would have cameras on them.

1389
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:39,140
They would kiss each other and telling
each other wow, freak people out.

1390
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:43,820
Since these big motorcycle dudes,
crazy beards making out with each other,

1391
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,940
wow.
Wasn't

1392
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,450
why am ca,
where'd they get actually gay?

1393
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,600
Because I saw a video the other day
and it didn't seem very gay village,

1394
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,110
the village people and it's, but it
seemed like maybe one or two of them were,

1395
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:56,260
but they,
uh,

1396
01:18:56,710 --> 01:18:57,850
do you remember,

1397
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,720
do you remember Jamie Kennedy
when Jamie Kennedy had a,

1398
01:19:01,721 --> 01:19:04,270
that show the Jamie Kennedy
experiment or what was it?

1399
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,163
Jamie [inaudible].

1400
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:08,030
Was it the experiment? Yeah, he um,

1401
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,980
he had this one episode that he did and
it was about guys and talk to these guys

1402
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:13,791
into being strippers.

1403
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:16,790
They're going to be male strippers
and then along why to get creepier and

1404
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:19,130
creepier. Are they going to be on a
TV show? They're going to be there.

1405
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:22,640
You're going to be able to like
girls gone wild guys gone nuts. Okay,

1406
01:19:22,641 --> 01:19:24,530
this guy's got nuts.
Hey, yeah. Okay, okay.

1407
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,710
And then they tell them that it's going
to be, a lot of it is for gay guys,

1408
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:30,980
but it doesn't matter man. You gotta
be a huge star and all that stuff.

1409
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:31,311
And you know,

1410
01:19:31,311 --> 01:19:34,870
he starts like going over like some of
the gay things he might have to do like,

1411
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:37,220
like money don't have to make out
with another man, might have to.

1412
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:39,110
All the guys were like,
well man,

1413
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:42,920
I don't want to do that but I do
want to be on the show. Damn. Um,

1414
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:48,080
and then at the end of it they reveal.
But it's real. It's not a setup.

1415
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:52,010
It was a real show. I mean Jamie
Kennedy's fucking genius in that Shit.

1416
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:55,670
I don't know why he stopped doing that.
I mean maybe it was like lawsuits.

1417
01:19:55,671 --> 01:19:57,200
Maybe they got in trouble for doing it,

1418
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:01,610
but that was like the best shit he
ever did. It was really fucking funny.

1419
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:03,230
But it was all these guys.

1420
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:07,050
So I would suspect that it's like
that kind of situation that if you,

1421
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:07,980
there's this,
there's enough

1422
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,130
guys out there that if
you just guaranteed them,

1423
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:12,240
they're going to be on television,

1424
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:15,330
guaranteed them to got to have some
sort of fame. They'll do some gay shit.

1425
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,840
Well,
the reason why I ask,

1426
01:20:16,841 --> 01:20:21,530
cause I that something that
David or Eddie van Halen Shit.

1427
01:20:21,531 --> 01:20:26,310
David Lee Roth did I am a Gigolo
everywhere. I didn't know that.

1428
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:30,090
Why am or a village people was one of
their songs and if you watch the video

1429
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:33,870
it's smooth as hell. Like, like, like
he's a pimp and then, and that was like,

1430
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:38,220
wait a second, I thought this was like,
like some weird like a gay band, you know,

1431
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:41,630
do is type in,
are the village people and then yeah,

1432
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:42,610
Google filled out.

1433
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:52,080
Okay. Which members of the village people
were our gay. All right, here we go. Uh,

1434
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:55,490
Victor Willis,
the policemen and Glenn Hughes.

1435
01:20:55,491 --> 01:20:59,780
The biker were straight while
pepe rose or Philippe rose,

1436
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:04,490
the American Indian and Randy
Jones, the cowboy. David Hodo,

1437
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:09,230
the construction worker and Alex
Briley military man were gay.

1438
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:12,920
So there was only two straight dudes
and the rest of them were just for gay

1439
01:21:12,921 --> 01:21:16,370
members jerking off on them while they're
taking nuts. What is this? That's it.

1440
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,540
This is just the Gigolo,

1441
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:19,163
this guy.

1442
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:28,350
This is a village people.
Wow. David Lee Roth.

1443
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:30,470
You have a lot of explaining the,
but

1444
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:35,700
it's actually like a kind of cool
video and I like, it's got like this,

1445
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:39,720
I just changed my idea of what the
village people where you can really tell

1446
01:21:39,721 --> 01:21:40,620
which ones are gay.

1447
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:44,010
Like this guy's just hooking up with a
chick and then it cuts to some guy with a

1448
01:21:44,011 --> 01:21:48,150
black tank top. And the pilots
had, well not only that,

1449
01:21:48,151 --> 01:21:52,470
it's a black guy and a white woman.
Yeah, the interracial vibe to it.

1450
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:57,030
And she's really hot too.
Wow.

1451
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,690
Oh there they were again.
They were all in the alley.

1452
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:05,670
They cut to the gay guys dancing,
looking at themselves in the mirror. No,

1453
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:10,260
the policeman was not gay.
The policemen and the biker or straight.

1454
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:14,030
So that guy with the crazy mustache.
That's the biker, right? He's straight,

1455
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,720
believe it or not.
Wow.

1456
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,920
How's that possible hanging out
with too many gay guys hanging on?

1457
01:22:18,921 --> 01:22:20,130
I ain't got no,

1458
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,500
that's hilarious

1459
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:34,790
that the Indian is gay as fuck
though. See, I'm looking at

1460
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:41,880
him dance. Look at that cowboy. You
can't tell me that cowboy straight.

1461
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:43,360
I'll tell you that right now.
This is what,

1462
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,560
you can't even dance like
that until you've had three
or four dicks in your ass.

1463
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:50,310
It's not possible to move that away.
There's a looseness in his hips.

1464
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:56,870
This is crazy. As the biker straight is,
fuck yeah. The bikers like, I am so proud.

1465
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,760
They're going to pounce on me.

1466
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:02,520
I'm just going to be so gay that
they don't even want a part of me.

1467
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,430
That's what he's doing.
It's like, man, Halan.

1468
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,900
Yeah, that mustache, that guy with the
mustache to assume you would have to be.

1469
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:14,840
Oh, totally. Nope. That's,
wait. No, he's straight now.

1470
01:23:14,841 --> 01:23:17,860
He was in the closet.
Hey,

1471
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,470
you're still in denial like I know
what you're talking about, man. I mean,

1472
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,740
I just fucking, just a job,
bro. I'm just playing a biker.

1473
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:27,740
Even if he's not gay.
His mustaches,

1474
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:32,030
that mustache jumps off his face in the
middle of the night and goes and bangs

1475
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:32,933
dudes

1476
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:41,090
just comes back in the morning
smelling like liquor in, but oh,

1477
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,390
holes in Bacardi
village.

1478
01:23:47,391 --> 01:23:51,890
People are great. I can get, Bro. Can
you imagine how insulted the Indians,

1479
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,903
the Indians

1480
01:23:56,020 --> 01:24:01,020
representatives are quite pathetic
now to Cherokee nation voices is just

1481
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:05,050
approval. Oh, that was an
Apache. Don't worry about it bro.

1482
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:06,100
Those are the enemy anyway.

1483
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:09,340
You know the Indians like they
didn't all like each other.

1484
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:13,030
Did you guys know that? Oh yeah.
Fuck all the time. All the time.

1485
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:16,120
The idea that like the white man came
and like there's a peaceful land.

1486
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:19,400
They came the white man and
killed everyone I think.

1487
01:24:19,401 --> 01:24:24,070
And you guys were kind of killing
each other to the Lakota Sioux,

1488
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:28,390
the Sioux Indian that the term sue
doesn't mean that's their name.

1489
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:30,990
Like that means enemy. That's
what it means. They're,

1490
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:35,340
they call themselves the Lakota people,
but the word sue is entity to the,

1491
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,420
so these other native
tribes called them enemy.

1492
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:41,080
Obviously the Americans and the Americans,
the white people.

1493
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:45,610
Europeans did a way better job of killing
people and we're way more fucked up

1494
01:24:45,611 --> 01:24:49,780
about it and we're way more evil about
it and had guns and a lot of this shit,

1495
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:54,580
but they didn't like each other
either. That's just people, man.

1496
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:57,970
You never going to find like this idea
of you find this one piece for utopia

1497
01:24:57,971 --> 01:24:59,140
where everyone got along.

1498
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:03,610
They were one with nature and they did
a lot of raping and killing to fucking

1499
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:08,620
cut people up. They did a
lot of evil shit. They eight
people, so stop everybody.

1500
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:11,680
There's no like one race
that you can go back and go.

1501
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:15,670
Those fuckers had it nailed right.
Those guys were super cool to each other.

1502
01:25:15,671 --> 01:25:18,670
They had a balance civilization.
There was no murder, no rape,

1503
01:25:18,671 --> 01:25:22,900
no theft was never existed.
Definitely not.

1504
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,080
We're a work in progress,
ladies and gentlemen and shit takes time.

1505
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:29,920
The universe has been here for something
billion years. How many billions?

1506
01:25:29,921 --> 01:25:34,180
14 billion, something like
that. This planet's been
here four and a half billion.

1507
01:25:34,181 --> 01:25:38,340
4.6 something like that. I'm not
sure how long ass time. Okay.

1508
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:41,470
We've been here for a million
years. If that. It takes time.

1509
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,140
We've got to figure it out. So
no cultures ever had it. Right.

1510
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:47,980
The idea that we should have left the
American Indians alone. Yeah. Great idea.

1511
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,600
Fucking terrific. And then
what, and then what exactly.

1512
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:55,880
They're there. All the village people,
it's just a bunch of Indians come on.

1513
01:25:55,881 --> 01:25:57,200
We needed to get some America seconds

1514
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:00,180
in there. Yeah. Not only that,
like I'm not, um, I'm not,

1515
01:26:00,181 --> 01:26:04,610
I'm like arguing for genocide.
But that's happens when people go in,

1516
01:26:04,611 --> 01:26:07,580
they look at history, they look
at the positive benefits of like,

1517
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:10,220
things that have happened that
were really ugly. Like when, uh,

1518
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:13,640
like people talk about the
Mongols, they talk about how
the Mongols, uh, they, they,

1519
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:17,540
they improve trade routes they
killed millions of people do though.

1520
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:21,620
I mean they improve trade routes by
butchering like entire cities of people.

1521
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:26,570
Yeah. They, things definitely started
moving more freely. But, but people like,

1522
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,720
like to like look at the
positive benefits of like,

1523
01:26:29,721 --> 01:26:32,120
things like that were horrible.
Genocide took place.

1524
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:37,250
So if you looked at like
Americans establishing
American Europeans coming over

1525
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:41,210
and established American killing all
these native Americans, some people,

1526
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,450
if they looked at it that way, would
say, well, if it wasn't for that,

1527
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,840
we would never have Atlanta.
We would never have Miami.

1528
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:50,390
We would never have these wonderful
cities that we eat enjoy today.

1529
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,530
So in the long run it worked out. Yeah.
And the Indians, they have their casinos.

1530
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:56,420
That's true.
They make a lot of money.

1531
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,060
It's a pretty fucked up history when you
think about the history of the United

1532
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,620
States.
Only a few hundred years ago,

1533
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:07,070
there's these other folks that lived here
like only a few hundred years ago and

1534
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:08,480
as many as like a million.

1535
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:12,080
There was a lot of them at one point in
time there was a lot of fucking people

1536
01:27:12,081 --> 01:27:15,020
living in this country. Like the idea
that this place wasn't, wasn't populated.

1537
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:18,610
Right. A lot of them, they killed
a lot of fucking people. Yeah.

1538
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,200
They killed him in the crepe.
Creepiest ways to like putting,

1539
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:26,030
they put smallpox in their,
their uh, their, their, their
blankets. Was it smallpox?

1540
01:27:26,031 --> 01:27:29,480
So they put in their blankets and gave
to these people. They put like blankets.

1541
01:27:29,481 --> 01:27:32,720
They had scabs in the blankets of people
that have diseases and they would put

1542
01:27:32,721 --> 01:27:36,950
it in the blankets and give them
to the American Indians. Oof. Oof.

1543
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:39,620
Spreading these evil terminal diseases.

1544
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,600
Josh Martins bed,

1545
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:47,990
our friend I had just moved into a place
and he like, it's first night there.

1546
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:48,171
Yeah,

1547
01:27:48,171 --> 01:27:52,400
you got screwed over by these two guys
that had a bedroom for rent and he gave

1548
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:56,330
him the deposit and the first month's
rent and slept there for one night and

1549
01:27:56,331 --> 01:28:01,220
everything he owned since he moved it
all into his new bedroom got infested by

1550
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,700
bedbugs. Oh No. Yeah.

1551
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:08,180
And they're like really hard to
get rid of. You need to wash seal,

1552
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:13,190
you need to seal everything and wash it
all at 110 degrees for an hour at least.

1553
01:28:13,281 --> 01:28:15,560
And you have to do all
this stuff with everything.

1554
01:28:15,561 --> 01:28:20,390
His mattress is now garbage and he's like
a very struggling young comics. Oh No.

1555
01:28:20,391 --> 01:28:22,570
So they knew about it before
they ran it in the place. Yeah.

1556
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:25,480
So he's going to try to, oh, this is,

1557
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:30,620
this is somebody that just came off of
living his in his car for a whole year.

1558
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,940
Yeah.
In the last two months.

1559
01:28:31,941 --> 01:28:36,080
He was living in his car after it had
been peed on by another comic. Right.

1560
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:40,170
Oh yeah. This is for guys just
not getting any luck. Yeah.

1561
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:43,700
Fuck man. Bedbugs are supposedly
like all throughout New York City.

1562
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,950
It's a real issue with bedbugs.
Yeah. Yeah. You know, I it,

1563
01:28:45,951 --> 01:28:48,020
because this happened to
him, uh, over the weekend.

1564
01:28:48,021 --> 01:28:50,720
I ended up reading about it
yesterday and it's really crazy.

1565
01:28:50,721 --> 01:28:53,480
They were almost extinct completely.

1566
01:28:53,481 --> 01:28:57,170
And then in [inaudible] 95 or something
like that, for no apparent reason,

1567
01:28:57,230 --> 01:29:02,100
there was an explosion of bedbugs. I
remember it just being, I, I used to think

1568
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,851
they weren't even real.

1569
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:05,850
I used to think it was just a thing
that my mom said to me before bed, like,

1570
01:29:05,851 --> 01:29:09,420
have a good night. Don't let the
bedbugs bite. Like that whole thing. No,

1571
01:29:09,421 --> 01:29:13,260
they're real. Dude. When I was in high
school, my dog had fleas and she, uh,

1572
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,140
she got the fleas in my carpet
and I couldn't get him out. Man.

1573
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:19,830
I could not get them out. Like when
I would go from my, my bedroom,

1574
01:29:19,831 --> 01:29:21,270
like from my carpet to my bed,

1575
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:24,990
I would give bugs on me and don't have
to take them off that I had that happened

1576
01:29:24,991 --> 01:29:29,520
once. That was the scariest one of the
worst times of my life. It drove me crazy.

1577
01:29:29,521 --> 01:29:32,850
Feel like they're on you all the time
and I was a fucking lazy kid too.

1578
01:29:32,851 --> 01:29:35,100
I wasn't going to clean my room.
I wasn't gonna vacuum was,

1579
01:29:35,101 --> 01:29:36,240
I just wasn't going to get it done.

1580
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:40,770
They jumped right on your ankles barring
remember that have a little scabs on my

1581
01:29:40,771 --> 01:29:44,820
ankles so I eventually had to pull
everything out of my room and then foam it

1582
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:46,470
down.
We had to get this machine,

1583
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:49,890
you know those machines and they hire
people to come by and you know you could

1584
01:29:49,891 --> 01:29:53,490
rent them and like home depot and shit
or whatever it was. I thought one of us.

1585
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:58,260
Did you buy one if you ever need it?
Well I think carpets or gross man,

1586
01:29:58,370 --> 01:30:01,200
I would rather have a wood floor
that you can clean up real easy.

1587
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:02,880
You can't really clean carpets that good.

1588
01:30:02,881 --> 01:30:05,730
It's like clothes that you never change.
I couldn't agree with you more.

1589
01:30:05,731 --> 01:30:09,600
I hate carpet. If it was up to me it
would just be, if you have hardwood,

1590
01:30:09,601 --> 01:30:13,620
maybe like a little rug and
then with something when
something spills on the rug,

1591
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:17,610
get a new rug. Yeah. Roll that
bitch up fire. Absolutely. Yeah.

1592
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:21,420
I think that's like a thing that people
thought was like a luxury in the 80s,

1593
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:24,850
the 70s or whatever the fuck it was.
Carpet and they realize ah,

1594
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,900
this is like a sweater
that people walk on, right?

1595
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:31,680
It's like a giant towel is,

1596
01:30:31,681 --> 01:30:33,440
it's essentially just like a towel,

1597
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,590
towels of those little things that stick
out of them. Who you mean plush? Yeah,

1598
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:42,540
the fancier it is, the more it
entraps uh, bacteria and everything.

1599
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:43,560
You know what I don't like?

1600
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:46,770
I don't like towels that are synthetic
because you could feel it when they're

1601
01:30:46,771 --> 01:30:51,180
wet. When you're wet and you rub like one
of those plush synthetic towels and it

1602
01:30:51,181 --> 01:30:54,990
almost like doesn't absorb the water,
wipes the water on you a little bit,

1603
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,660
like absorbed some of it,
but you could feel the difference.

1604
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:00,420
Or if you get like a
real legit cotton towel,

1605
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:05,070
you feel it like dry you off. You
feel it, like take the water off.

1606
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:09,170
Those slippery ones make me feel like
I'm ruining the environment. Oh yeah.

1607
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:12,630
I throw those out. Those
are my, I couldn't probably,

1608
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:16,440
this print thing will probably melt when
you light on fire would melt. You know,

1609
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,830
I saw you at e three. You're or I heard
your voice on the e three when you,

1610
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:24,000
they announced the new UFC and they uh,
I've played some of it and they did,

1611
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:28,470
I guess Bruce Lee is now in it. So you
can fight Bruce leave versus like GSP.

1612
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:32,580
Dude. Have you seen it? Yeah, the graphics
are insane. They're insane. It's amazing.

1613
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:36,480
There are so close now they're getting
so close to like making it look like a

1614
01:31:36,481 --> 01:31:40,110
real movie.
Like making it a real fight in HD.

1615
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:44,220
And your own commentary on
that. Yeah. Did I did ours.

1616
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:45,300
I was just going to ask like,

1617
01:31:45,301 --> 01:31:49,470
oh are you have to say like everything
cause you have to get every possible

1618
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:54,090
thing out. Yeah. I mean
I'm not complaining but I
am kind of, but it wasn't,

1619
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,720
wasn't like a difficult thing to do.
It just takes a long time. Right.

1620
01:31:56,730 --> 01:32:00,070
It's actually fun. I would just pretend
that was watching fights and you I would

1621
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:02,410
just do it. Exactly. I
would, when I was doing it,

1622
01:32:02,411 --> 01:32:04,930
I would just think about
moments that things happen,

1623
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:09,960
like moments like guys landed kicks or
you know punches or take downs or someone

1624
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:15,260
catching the choke and I would just
remember like historic fight moments and

1625
01:32:15,261 --> 01:32:18,100
they're just sort of try to recapture
that and try to pretend that that's

1626
01:32:18,101 --> 01:32:22,090
happening while I was screaming at him.
So if you watch, if you play the video,

1627
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,940
it's very close to the way I
would do commentary to real fire.

1628
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:31,380
I love,
actually Chris isn't the best.

1629
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:35,960
No one has ever been better than
the buffaloes total look up.

1630
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:38,550
Good to fucking graphics.
That's incredible. My God,

1631
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:42,000
I didn't realize this was the game
until you just said that. That's crazy.

1632
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,030
Who gets the fucking
shadows and Dwayne is,

1633
01:32:45,090 --> 01:32:46,980
it's so much better than it used to be.

1634
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:52,200
Exactly like Rhonda Rousey. That's
crazy. And look at the movement.

1635
01:32:52,201 --> 01:32:53,940
The movements really good.
Now

1636
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:59,660
you heard the ground game controls are a
lot easier now to get into Jujitsu news

1637
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:00,710
and stuff.
This

1638
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:11,820
is crazy shit.
It looks so good.

1639
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,480
That's a good team.
I mean it looks real.

1640
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:23,310
Rarely been spending a lot,
but I'll tell you what,

1641
01:33:23,311 --> 01:33:25,910
people take a lot more head kicks
in this game than they do and feel

1642
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:31,290
things. A couple of those jammies
in real life to shut the lights out.

1643
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,250
This is wild.
Is it?

1644
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:39,390
Is it weird to see all your friends
digitizing the Bruce Lee thing is amazing

1645
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:42,100
if,
if you bring a Bruce Lee,

1646
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,940
is he wearing the yellow and black?
You said that about right

1647
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:51,210
gay as possible.
You can.

1648
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:54,120
You can talk like that when it's
about Bruce Lee. You're allowed to.

1649
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:58,500
Isn't that funny? Like ripped.
Ripped is a thing that people want.

1650
01:33:58,501 --> 01:34:01,870
They want ripped cod. They want
to see the six pack. Meanwhile,

1651
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:06,900
the best fighter possibly ever was fate
or million inco and he was fat as fuck.

1652
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:10,740
He walked around with like a belly.
You know, he had like a little role,

1653
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:14,280
like helix jiggles around the middle
a little bit. It didn't give a fuck.

1654
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:18,720
Just gone there and fuck guys up. Anderson
Silva was never that repped either.

1655
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:22,740
You know, he was more smooth. It means
to obviously muscular and very strong,

1656
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:27,180
but he wasn't like Bruce Lee and shredded
like it was a few guys that are like

1657
01:34:27,181 --> 01:34:32,160
that fucking shredded greasy like Batman.

1658
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:36,930
Bruce Lee was like legitimately one of
the first guys to figure out that there

1659
01:34:36,931 --> 01:34:41,220
were certain aspects of all the martial
arts that were effective and the best

1660
01:34:41,221 --> 01:34:44,850
way to do it was to combine them all
before Bruce Lee. Nobody combined shit.

1661
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:48,510
That was like a thing that you would
have pride in. You know, I have studied,

1662
01:34:48,511 --> 01:34:51,990
showed up, Khan, I will continue to
be a show con man to the day I die.

1663
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,420
I am a wing Chung man, you know, I,

1664
01:34:54,421 --> 01:34:57,740
you know and people would like represent
their style like an old Fu movie,

1665
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:58,580
you know,

1666
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:01,550
where they thought that there was only
one style that was the correct style.

1667
01:35:01,551 --> 01:35:05,900
My master learned from the Great Masters
and he came down from Korea and taught

1668
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:09,560
me this style. Bruce Lee
was like, that's nonsense.

1669
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:12,950
Bruce Lee was the guy who invented
MMA. Really? What'd you do?

1670
01:35:12,951 --> 01:35:16,150
You fart covering your own mouth. I know
it was building my brand and my shirts.

1671
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:21,360
You can't even go an hour without getting
you back on the vape pen to, yeah.

1672
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,390
Did you get off the cigarettes? I
still smoke cigarettes. They age.

1673
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:26,700
What happened man?

1674
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:31,250
What was the stressful event that
caused you to go back off work stuff?

1675
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:34,700
I didn't get something that I was
working for a couple months for really,

1676
01:35:34,701 --> 01:35:38,770
really hard and I mean, I'm going
to get back to, listen Tony.

1677
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:43,360
I've got to get off in the long run.
It did you good? Trust me. Yeah,

1678
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:46,670
you're, you're, you
shouldn't be on shows, Dude.

1679
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:48,860
You should just get funny
just from your stand up.

1680
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:51,830
I mean get famous just from your stand
up. Funny. Just from your stand up.

1681
01:35:52,190 --> 01:35:53,360
Get famous just from your stand up.

1682
01:35:53,361 --> 01:35:56,330
And the reason why I say this is because
no one is ever going to be able to

1683
01:35:56,331 --> 01:35:59,780
capture what you do best any
place other than onstage.

1684
01:35:59,910 --> 01:36:02,270
And you know when you're on
stage that's you. You're,

1685
01:36:02,271 --> 01:36:04,520
you're 100% in control of the content,

1686
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:07,460
the way it's set up
delivered and it's hilarious.

1687
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:10,610
Like you can't do that if
you're doing a TV show,

1688
01:36:10,611 --> 01:36:12,200
you're going to do with a bunch of people.

1689
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:16,250
They're going to have some fucking wacky
ideas about what Tony h should wear and

1690
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:19,820
Tony, we got like just a little bit of
makeup, just a slight base like okay,

1691
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:24,190
okay and next thing you
know. Yeah, it was it,

1692
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:27,620
it was a little bit bigger than that,
that the draining thing like it was,

1693
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:30,770
it was something that like, I know,
I know what it was funny. Yeah,

1694
01:36:30,771 --> 01:36:34,160
I know what it was. He worked on it for
a long time. It was really tough loss.

1695
01:36:34,161 --> 01:36:35,060
If you're going to do a show,

1696
01:36:35,061 --> 01:36:38,000
I really think it should be your own show
just to figure out how to do your own

1697
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:41,870
thing. You're doing somebody else's
thing. I think that's for a comic,

1698
01:36:41,871 --> 01:36:45,080
that's one of the hardest things to, to
realize. It takes a long time to realize,

1699
01:36:45,081 --> 01:36:48,230
but you're better off doing your
own thing. Then you are like,

1700
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:51,710
if you get stuck on some show,
like when I was on fear factor,

1701
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,290
it was a great benefit.
Financially it was really good,

1702
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:57,440
but we doing someone else's
thing, it's not, it's like a job.

1703
01:36:57,470 --> 01:37:00,770
It becomes something that you think
about like, okay, now I'm going to work.

1704
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:02,300
Not a complaining.
It was great job,

1705
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:06,620
but there's a huge difference between
that and like doing a podcast or that and

1706
01:37:06,621 --> 01:37:10,790
doing, doing stand up, especially doing
stand up. Oh yeah. That's the freest one.

1707
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:15,440
You're completely in control of how
you do it completely in control of what

1708
01:37:15,441 --> 01:37:17,570
you're right.
You experiment,

1709
01:37:17,571 --> 01:37:20,780
you come up with your own stuff and
you're not wasting any time doing anybody

1710
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:24,170
else's thing and that then exactly.

1711
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:28,760
I mean I wasn't going to slow down on
my stand up or you know the me thing,

1712
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,250
but I really wanted that.
I really wanted something

1713
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,220
that's, I mean that's a good thing that
you never stopped with your stand up.

1714
01:37:37,221 --> 01:37:38,510
Some guys do, right? They start,

1715
01:37:38,610 --> 01:37:42,320
they get a job writing and they stopped
performing. It's crazy. That was a,

1716
01:37:42,321 --> 01:37:45,500
that was one of the things when I got
into the writer's room for the first time,

1717
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:50,530
I was amazed at how funny a lot of
the guys were and that they used to do

1718
01:37:50,841 --> 01:37:55,841
standup and that once they started the
writing job that they stopped because I

1719
01:37:55,951 --> 01:37:56,130
hang

1720
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:59,940
out with comedians all the time, almost
every night. So when I was in the room,

1721
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:03,360
I know what's funny and I know
who's funny. You know what I mean?

1722
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:07,950
So it's amazing to me. It
was scary. Like one guy,

1723
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:08,700
you know,

1724
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:12,480
one of the funniest people I've ever
met used to do stand up and he doesn't,

1725
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,410
every time this guy opens his mouth,
it's about to be an explosion. I mean,

1726
01:38:16,411 --> 01:38:20,100
he has an Emmy for writing,
but he's the king of roast riding.

1727
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:23,750
Like he's just an insult
guru. So if you go, hey, what
about Bobby, Bobby, you know,

1728
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,880
Jimi Hendrix or whatever,
and 10 seconds later he'll have a,

1729
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:31,170
a gem that you can't not almost
fall on the ground at. So, but yeah,

1730
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:36,120
I never did the entire time,
my first few years writing,

1731
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:40,800
writing gigs, even during the
season, if it got late in the office,

1732
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:45,240
eight nine, 10 like, hey guys,
I got to go a do my spot. Sorry.

1733
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:46,373
But I'd also,

1734
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:49,960
I'd also churn it out so much during the
day that they couldn't be like, well,

1735
01:38:50,220 --> 01:38:54,360
you know, I didn't give them an option.
I would, you know, hard all day.

1736
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:58,890
But I never, if I did that, if I missed
a spot or something for a writing Gig,

1737
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:00,750
that would start an entire,

1738
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:05,810
whole nother crazy meltdown and breakdown
because I just can't not do stand up

1739
01:39:06,330 --> 01:39:07,163
crazy.

1740
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,280
Well sure. You're always getting
better too. I'll see you.

1741
01:39:10,281 --> 01:39:11,960
I'll see you three months later.
You're better.

1742
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,810
Three months later you'll be better than
you were three months ago almost every

1743
01:39:14,811 --> 01:39:15,370
time.

1744
01:39:15,370 --> 01:39:19,010
And that means you're like constantly
trying to refine and hone and that's when

1745
01:39:19,011 --> 01:39:22,040
it becomes like a real obsession when
you're like folding over your jokes and

1746
01:39:22,041 --> 01:39:23,950
hammering them down,
trying to get him to do,

1747
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:25,520
you got to do a lot of sets to do that.

1748
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:28,370
And if you have another gig that
starts preventing you from doing that,

1749
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:33,200
he can become a real problem because
you could just go, oh, you know what?

1750
01:39:33,201 --> 01:39:35,810
I've got this. I'm just going to
like, I'm just going to kick back,

1751
01:39:35,811 --> 01:39:37,220
stop doing standup for a while.

1752
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:39,980
I'm gonna just take a few months off
and just maybe I'll just, I mean,

1753
01:39:39,981 --> 01:39:41,360
I'm not happy with my act right now.

1754
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:44,600
And you come up with excuses and
reasons and next thing you know,

1755
01:39:44,601 --> 01:39:46,010
you've got some sort of a job.

1756
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:49,400
You're showing up at an office every day
and you're mean you're writing. Yeah,

1757
01:39:49,401 --> 01:39:53,570
it's great, but it's not as fun as
stand up. You can't be. Exactly.

1758
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:57,920
But for some dudes, that stress
of the performance is not worth,

1759
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:02,390
it's like a, it's not worth the effort.
It's like, what's that expression?

1760
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:08,210
The juice like a, is it worth the
juice to squeeze these berries?

1761
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:10,520
You know, is it worth the
effort? Is it worth it?

1762
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:14,150
All this stress that you go through
to get onstage and crack out a joke.

1763
01:40:14,151 --> 01:40:18,200
I'd rather just write for someone
else and have them deal with it. Yeah.

1764
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:22,340
That's not stress at all. I love churning
those berries. You know what I'm saying?

1765
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,010
Why? But that's just you, right? Yeah.

1766
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:27,650
I mean for some guys it really is
better for them to just be a writer.

1767
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:31,100
It's like this, this, the performance
life is just too fucked up.

1768
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:35,960
It's too hard for them. I guess so, yeah.
I think there's a lot of guys like that

1769
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:37,600
couldn't get the spots,

1770
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:40,480
didn't meet the right people at the
right time or something. I don't know.

1771
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,960
Maybe they weren't that
funny of a performer. That
is the one thing, you know,

1772
01:40:44,050 --> 01:40:46,810
I don't know what those writers
who I say are Hilarious,

1773
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:48,280
what their standups like.

1774
01:40:48,281 --> 01:40:51,370
They've been in writer rooms for so
long that they know how to be funny,

1775
01:40:51,371 --> 01:40:54,000
like at a table. You know what I, when the

1776
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:54,883
topic comes up,

1777
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,670
do you encourage people that you meet
that are really funny to try to do stand

1778
01:40:57,671 --> 01:40:58,504
up?

1779
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:02,230
No, never. Never really. Never it.

1780
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:03,820
They gotta want to do it.

1781
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:08,710
That's one of those things where if
you don't want it so bad that you like,

1782
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:11,800
you're crazy about it, then you're
not going to do anything anyway.

1783
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:13,490
You never planted that seed though.

1784
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:16,180
You never said to anybody you
should probably use stand up.

1785
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:17,330
I,
you know,

1786
01:41:17,331 --> 01:41:22,331
my whole podcast is pretty much based
on helping people that want to do stand

1787
01:41:23,151 --> 01:41:23,390
up,

1788
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:28,390
get better or grow or give them something
or in any way shape or form or bring

1789
01:41:28,701 --> 01:41:32,300
him down a peg if they're crazy.
But um,

1790
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:35,600
I know I'm not into helping,

1791
01:41:35,601 --> 01:41:40,601
I'm not into telling somebody that they
should do something that's as extreme as

1792
01:41:40,731 --> 01:41:42,680
standup. Like if they
have, if that thought,

1793
01:41:42,681 --> 01:41:45,980
if they haven't gone to an open mic
and tried it then now I can't say,

1794
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:51,260
you know why I say I do it is because I
think there's certain people out there

1795
01:41:51,261 --> 01:41:53,990
that really are funny and
just need to hear like I just,

1796
01:41:53,991 --> 01:41:58,450
a voice of encouragement can go a long
way. There's a, I met dudes that my,

1797
01:41:58,670 --> 01:42:00,560
I used to work for,
guy was private investigator,

1798
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:03,620
one of the funniest guys I've ever
met my life. His name is Dave Dolan.

1799
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:05,750
The great easily could
have been a standup.

1800
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:09,830
He was a private investigator and he
was really good at reading people.

1801
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:11,750
So he knew what a person's weakness was.

1802
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:14,840
He would talk to you for a couple seconds
to just figure out what your thing was.

1803
01:42:14,841 --> 01:42:18,800
New played dumb. He'd be like this dumb
Boston guy. I can't, you know, you know,

1804
01:42:18,801 --> 01:42:22,820
it was down here with a friend of mine
and uh, we were looking for this guy that,

1805
01:42:22,821 --> 01:42:23,361
uh,
hit the,

1806
01:42:23,361 --> 01:42:26,690
hit our car and took off and he would
read off a license plate number.

1807
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:30,020
It was very similar to their license
plate number and that was how we got

1808
01:42:30,021 --> 01:42:30,980
information out of people.

1809
01:42:31,130 --> 01:42:33,560
He would just tell them about an accident
that they weren't involved in and then

1810
01:42:33,561 --> 01:42:36,590
he would start talking to them and they
would start giving them information,

1811
01:42:36,591 --> 01:42:40,160
but all kinds of shit about working
while they're on unemployment. Oh,

1812
01:42:40,161 --> 01:42:41,840
I'm using my maiden name,
have a job. I'm like,

1813
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:44,270
we caught people doing shit
like that all the time. Right.

1814
01:42:44,271 --> 01:42:46,340
But the guy was hilarious.

1815
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:50,240
He would get in the car like after we
had done that and we would, you know,

1816
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:53,630
we'd worked together as a team and he
would be laughing his dick off and just

1817
01:42:53,631 --> 01:42:55,700
saying all kinds of fucking crazy shit,
you know?

1818
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:59,500
And he was just one of those guys that
was just naturally funny. And I told him,

1819
01:42:59,501 --> 01:43:02,030
I was like, look man, you're funnier
than me and I'm doing standup.

1820
01:43:02,031 --> 01:43:05,570
Like you should really do
stand up. And he's like, look
kid, I gotta pay the bills.

1821
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,760
Okay, this is what I do.
I bust ass holes. Right.

1822
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:11,000
They just had this sort of way about them.

1823
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:14,710
Just knew how to just say the right thing.
Yeah.

1824
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:18,710
It's like a craft that some guys have
where they know when to say the right

1825
01:43:18,711 --> 01:43:22,030
thing. Like is perfect
example, right? You know when,

1826
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:25,370
when Eddie Bravo fought huddle Gracie,
we called Joey Diaz,

1827
01:43:25,371 --> 01:43:27,770
we had one speaker phone and
the first thing he said is

1828
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:30,030
child,
the flags are at half mass

1829
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:36,043
knows

1830
01:43:36,050 --> 01:43:39,260
when to say the right shit.
If Joey D is, if somebody's,

1831
01:43:39,410 --> 01:43:41,630
I guess he probably
decided to do it himself,

1832
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:44,120
but if nobody had ever talked to
Joey Diaz and to doing stand up,

1833
01:43:44,330 --> 01:43:47,600
that would have been a national tragedy.
Yeah.

1834
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:52,580
I know a lot of what Joey did was in
prison. Oh, who'd make prisoners laugh?

1835
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:55,630
Yeah. I, that's where he got
good at it. They were like, he,

1836
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:58,770
they wouldn't show a movie if the movie
sucked, they'd go get up there. Cocoa,

1837
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,280
get up there.

1838
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:03,260
Costco and Jelly would get up on stage
and make everybody laugh and then nuts.

1839
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:07,670
Wow. When they tell the Joey Diaz life
story, and I think somebody will do it,

1840
01:44:07,671 --> 01:44:10,160
someone's going to fuck it up. Probably
be Jonah Hill or something like that.

1841
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:13,370
Have some guys,
not even Cuban.

1842
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:18,170
It'll be Adam Sandler was a fat suit.

1843
01:44:18,570 --> 01:44:21,500
Adam was a big fan and really
wants your trust in this project.

1844
01:44:21,501 --> 01:44:22,610
He probably thinks that he could do it.

1845
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:27,100
It'd be like when people were outraged
that Tom Cruise was going to play this

1846
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:32,030
stat and interview with the vampire
kids crazy online petition against Tom

1847
01:44:32,031 --> 01:44:35,030
cruise playing less data, but he's
freaking the fuck out. That's it.

1848
01:44:35,031 --> 01:44:38,540
It'd be like Jonah Hill was going to
play Joey Diaz. Yeah. They'd be like,

1849
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:39,740
he's not even Cameron.

1850
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,140
Hey, how are you? Cock suckers

1851
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:47,320
and there be someone from like some
Latino Association who would get on TV and

1852
01:44:47,321 --> 01:44:51,460
say, you know, this is another
theft from the Latino community.

1853
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:56,620
Someone has coming in and a non Latino
is playing a Latino on TV in a movie

1854
01:44:58,031 --> 01:45:00,710
about a Latino Star. Never. Yeah.

1855
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,040
Cubano he'll ideas.

1856
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:08,200
It's the best sauce of bashing.

1857
01:45:08,230 --> 01:45:10,690
The other day at the ice house
sold out the whole weekend.

1858
01:45:10,691 --> 01:45:13,960
I didn't know so many people knew
who Subash and why is that? Oh yeah,

1859
01:45:14,210 --> 01:45:17,290
he was that big, but people were
telling me, I will dude, he's huge.

1860
01:45:17,291 --> 01:45:19,480
Sebastian's doing great.
He had a showtime special,

1861
01:45:19,481 --> 01:45:22,990
we talked about a showtime special on the
podcast. I watched it in my hotel room.

1862
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:26,170
I was just flipping through the channels
and I caught it. It was really funny.

1863
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:29,410
He's fucking good. He's
doing really well. He, I,

1864
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:32,050
he always done well in certain spots.
Like where people got to know him.

1865
01:45:32,051 --> 01:45:34,240
He developed a following
in Dallas years back.

1866
01:45:34,330 --> 01:45:37,240
Like you do really well at the added
that Addison Improv that places for

1867
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:41,500
dickless. Hmm. That's a great
spot. That Addison Improv. Ooh,

1868
01:45:41,501 --> 01:45:43,570
that's a great spot.
That's what some wild people,

1869
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:45,280
there's still a lot of smoke indoors.
I think

1870
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:49,810
we'd do like a late show and people
would be smoking. I would go like, oh,

1871
01:45:49,811 --> 01:45:52,030
this is crazy.
You guys could smoke inside.

1872
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:54,930
Like it was her and it wasn't
like one of those Vegas showrooms.

1873
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Like you can smoke in Vegas,
but if you go to any place in Vegas,

1874
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:02,830
they have those fucking industrial
room cleansing machines,

1875
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:07,510
socking cigarette smoker. You Walk through
the casino, you don't even realize it.

1876
01:46:07,511 --> 01:46:09,220
All those people are
smoking. Right? I mean,

1877
01:46:09,221 --> 01:46:11,910
how often do you walk through the get
mean? If you, if it's right on top of it,

1878
01:46:11,911 --> 01:46:13,120
you smell it and it's kind of gross.

1879
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,790
But for the most part you're surrounded
by people smoking cigarettes.

1880
01:46:15,791 --> 01:46:16,624
You could barely tell.

1881
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:20,740
It's just shocking out that air and
cleaning it up and giving you some fresh

1882
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:23,400
ambition. Air, some blackjack air.

1883
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:24,910
That's how I got back on the smoke.

1884
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,730
So we were in Vegas just
a couple of weeks ago.

1885
01:46:26,731 --> 01:46:30,180
And you see these people smoking
in the casino and this I, you know,

1886
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:32,820
it was just weird. I wasn't really,
there wasn't really planning on smoking,

1887
01:46:32,821 --> 01:46:36,780
but we got there and you just see these
people smoking but you don't smell it.

1888
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:41,490
But it's indoors so it seems clean again,
like the trickery work,

1889
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:43,830
my brain.
Next thing you know,

1890
01:46:43,831 --> 01:46:46,620
and when we met after we
checked into our hotel rooms,

1891
01:46:46,621 --> 01:46:50,100
I had a pack of cigarettes. Why
don't we do the first time, find that

1892
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,640
out. How do casinos kill the
smell? Cigarettes? Cause they must,

1893
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:54,600
they must do something.

1894
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:58,710
We stayed at the Golden Nugget and we
had got it to the smoking room there and

1895
01:46:59,490 --> 01:47:04,260
the room smelled like the most cigarette
I've ever seen. The golden nuggets,

1896
01:47:04,261 --> 01:47:08,910
like the staple of Vegas. It's just
hundreds of years of cigarettes though.

1897
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:12,180
Sinatra smoking there. Well, you know,
they say there's third hand smoke.

1898
01:47:12,181 --> 01:47:13,770
Do you ever hear about third hand smoke?

1899
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:18,450
They think that you go into a place like
that that has been cigarette smokes.

1900
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:20,400
People have been smoking in there
for years and years and years.

1901
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:24,390
It's actually in the walls itself. Like
you're actually breathing in carcinogens.

1902
01:47:24,391 --> 01:47:25,320
We're in a building,

1903
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:29,730
especially if anything catches fire or
gets wet or has some sort of a chemical

1904
01:47:29,731 --> 01:47:33,270
reaction to things that are in the room.
Household cleaners and shit like that.

1905
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:36,180
It seems like something that you
would have said like three years ago,

1906
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:41,220
you get cancer from third hand
smoke. You're a fan, you're a pussy.

1907
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:43,830
Well,

1908
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:48,480
I'm not saying that it's anything you
should worry about at a casino staying in

1909
01:47:48,481 --> 01:47:51,000
a room for a night, but it's not
good for you. That's for sure.

1910
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:54,030
If they find out that's true.
Or if it gives you autism from smoke,

1911
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,080
like third hand smoke is,

1912
01:47:55,081 --> 01:47:58,830
it seems like it would if it's like if
you go to that golden nugget that we were

1913
01:47:58,831 --> 01:47:59,071
at,

1914
01:47:59,071 --> 01:48:04,071
that shit was disturbingly cigarettey so
that place had like old school filters.

1915
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:08,720
Oh, it's supposed to be. The rooms felt
like you were in an ashtray? Yeah, the,

1916
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:14,040
there's a thing called the, okay.
There's a thing called air fantastic.

1917
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:18,150
And they, uh, they have a solution
for these kinds of things.

1918
01:48:18,290 --> 01:48:22,290
It can reduce 99% of airborne
particles, particulates, dust,

1919
01:48:22,291 --> 01:48:26,520
pollen machines. Uh, this
is kind of interesting.

1920
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:29,760
So I guess it just sucks all the air out
of the room and cleans it while you're

1921
01:48:29,761 --> 01:48:33,060
in there, Huh? Yeah.
That's pretty impressive.

1922
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:36,990
99% of airborne particulates,
Jay Z.

1923
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:40,320
It's like a study from
a West Texas a and m

1924
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:45,690
particulates in cigarette
smoke are positively charged,

1925
01:48:45,691 --> 01:48:46,980
which keeps them airborne.

1926
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:50,810
The ions produced are negatively
charged and so the particles,

1927
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:54,870
the particles are neutralized
and fall to the ground.

1928
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:57,570
Whoa,
that's crazy.

1929
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:03,050
So this shit does something to the very
air around you that causes the particles

1930
01:49:04,171 --> 01:49:08,700
from cigarettes to fall so they don't
stay in the air and linger like that's

1931
01:49:08,701 --> 01:49:13,680
what's going on. What the fuck
is that about? That's weird, man.

1932
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:17,910
Crystal Clear experiment was proven in
Austin's yellow rose gentleman's club in

1933
01:49:17,911 --> 01:49:22,350
2003, which installed eight
of our 14 inch probes.

1934
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:25,140
That's hilarious. That's their
first fucking customer. Finally,

1935
01:49:25,141 --> 01:49:27,810
we got one bull is a titty bar taken us
in and we're going to revolutionize this

1936
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:28,644
game.

1937
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:34,130
The bar would be packed with many smokers
and the air was crystal clear and one

1938
01:49:35,281 --> 01:49:39,150
could not even see, uh, on particle.

1939
01:49:39,930 --> 01:49:43,140
They should say one particle
but says aunt on particle,

1940
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:48,070
you fucking no spellcheck. Motherfuckers
read your own shit. How come someone has

1941
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:49,720
a website that you don't
even read your own shit?

1942
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:54,130
That makes me wonder if the product is a,
they could not see one particle.

1943
01:49:54,131 --> 01:49:58,630
You fucks in the bright
spot. Okay. All right.

1944
01:49:58,631 --> 01:50:00,340
Well that's just one company
that sells something.

1945
01:50:00,341 --> 01:50:03,130
But obviously there's something
like that. So they have, uh,

1946
01:50:03,190 --> 01:50:05,830
some way to remove this stuff.

1947
01:50:05,950 --> 01:50:10,330
There's more than one company is
another called Era Roma Air Zone.

1948
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:13,420
So I guess they do something.
Huh?

1949
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:15,790
I wonder if that's bad for you though.

1950
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:19,420
Whatever the fuck they're doing to the
air, it seems like it would be like,

1951
01:50:19,421 --> 01:50:23,980
it's good, right? Yeah. I don't know what
the fuck that is. You got to do something.

1952
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:26,410
If it's to the air,
how will do you have to be to smoke?

1953
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:31,870
18 set in New York just passed
21 which is super smart. Yeah,

1954
01:50:31,871 --> 01:50:34,180
it should be fucked.
That 21 you got to got to stop.

1955
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,740
You're not going to stop people.

1956
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:40,150
I think if you want to figure out a way
to keep people from smoking cigarettes,

1957
01:50:40,151 --> 01:50:42,850
you're going to have to
find some sort of a, a pill.

1958
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:46,960
Then that allows them to quit really
easily. It just kills the addiction.

1959
01:50:46,961 --> 01:50:51,760
No withdrawal symptoms because otherwise
the majority of people love pleasure

1960
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:55,360
and they hate discomfort so much that
the idea of being without a cigarette and

1961
01:50:55,361 --> 01:50:59,310
having a Pang and a craving is too
much and they just cave in. Yeah.

1962
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:02,940
It's amazing that Nabisco's
down with that. Yeah.

1963
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:05,410
The people that sell us those
fine cookies and crackers,

1964
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:10,240
they also sell cigarettes. I mean,
how coke greedy do you have to be?

1965
01:51:10,241 --> 01:51:15,241
Fucks how much money you make it from you
crackers so much enough fucking money.

1966
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,000
Why do you have to sell cigarettes?
It's all that stuff.

1967
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:22,690
You know those little sticks
with the little cheese.
What are those handy snacks?

1968
01:51:23,290 --> 01:51:28,000
Oh yeah. Four little white sticks
with the cheese. Same people.

1969
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:34,270
How weird. Kraft is a Nabisco
company, so all that cheese, Oreos,

1970
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:38,590
Oreos, a big one. How weird is
it that in this day and age,

1971
01:51:38,591 --> 01:51:40,240
with all the information that we have now,

1972
01:51:40,241 --> 01:51:43,480
we don't hold someone accountable for
something like that. We don't say,

1973
01:51:43,481 --> 01:51:46,900
why are you selling
that? Like, I mean, well,

1974
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:50,500
people have the right to choose what
they want to do and a lot of Americans

1975
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:55,300
enjoy a cigarette. It's amazing. That
was the scariest to me, honestly,

1976
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:58,150
is really McDonald's.
Because why?

1977
01:51:58,300 --> 01:52:03,100
Because everybody's so taught that
it's Mcdonald's. It's America.

1978
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:06,430
This is, this is good. You can, you
can, you can have, this is fine.

1979
01:52:06,431 --> 01:52:11,010
It's just cocacola fries, whatever.
This burger is made up. Yeah,

1980
01:52:11,210 --> 01:52:14,800
but that doesn't make you, well, I guess
it does a certain amount of addiction,

1981
01:52:14,801 --> 01:52:19,720
right? Oh yeah. It teaches you to
eat whatever preservatives are fine.

1982
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:23,590
It teaches you that eat, eat
garbage. If it tastes good,

1983
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:26,980
that's all that matters. I'm
loving it. Yeah, but is it,

1984
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:29,710
is it doing that or is it just
giving you that as an option to like,

1985
01:52:29,711 --> 01:52:32,620
why is that any different than
a donut shop? I like donuts.

1986
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,770
I don't eat them all the time, but I
like the fact that there's a donut shop.

1987
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,690
Or if I pull into Dunkin donuts and I say,
Oh,

1988
01:52:37,691 --> 01:52:40,330
I have a cup of coffee and
a Boston cream donut please.

1989
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:44,230
And I get excited and I'll have
about 1520 seconds of mouth pleasure,

1990
01:52:44,231 --> 01:52:46,070
and then a few hours of regret.
Yeah.

1991
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,800
But I liked it. That's
available. That Mcdonald's

1992
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,240
[inaudible] donuts, a special
treat. I think you go to a,

1993
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:54,040
you get a donut that's like,
I'm going to pick out my doughnut.

1994
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:58,730
This was baked today. Mcdonald's is like,
that's really the commercial, you know,

1995
01:52:58,731 --> 01:53:01,700
the commercials between
everything. It's sort of like, hey,

1996
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:06,110
and they're the number one toy
producer in the country. Donald.

1997
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:10,100
All those happy meals because
we're teaching kids, hey, eat this.

1998
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:12,830
It doesn't matter what this
Burger is actually made out of.

1999
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:15,230
You know, San Francisco
outlawed toys and happy meals.

2000
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:18,650
That's smart. Is it? Yeah.
I'm telling you, man,

2001
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:22,420
you can't just eat whatever you want.
You can,

2002
01:53:22,430 --> 01:53:26,120
but you can sometimes make you depressed.
It's going to make you angry.

2003
01:53:26,121 --> 01:53:28,700
You're going to wonder why
you feel crappy. I mean,

2004
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:31,010
at least that's how it was with me.
That's why I had to get off.

2005
01:53:31,011 --> 01:53:34,310
That's to Mcdonald's. Yeah. I had it
last night at like quarter pounder.

2006
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:38,750
It was like, yeah, we know it tastes
good. That's, that's part of the fries.

2007
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:40,400
The fries. Yeah. But nowadays they, they,

2008
01:53:40,401 --> 01:53:43,150
they're getting sued by so many
people that like, you know, the oils,

2009
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:47,560
they cook it in now or a lot
healthier than they used to
be. The, and the, the, the,

2010
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:52,430
the quarter pounder,
the kerosene that they cook,

2011
01:53:52,431 --> 01:53:57,050
the burgers. Any food you make is
going to have oils. I know. Yeah.

2012
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:58,750
But, but uh, yeah.

2013
01:53:59,310 --> 01:54:02,370
Yeah. I mean, because a lot of
people, when they seem their salary,

2014
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:05,160
they're always worried about that
goddamn oil that comes with it.

2015
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:08,010
Welcome to Greenly my salad.

2016
01:54:08,011 --> 01:54:11,940
I know there's going to be oil except
I meant when I eat anything with that

2017
01:54:11,941 --> 01:54:14,220
needs a whale like fries or
something like that. Or if you cook,

2018
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:16,290
you can cook them in duck fat.

2019
01:54:16,291 --> 01:54:20,460
Remember that one place in Vegas when
we go to a craft stake, God damn son,

2020
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:24,990
they bring over these duck fat fries.
Good googly Mowgli. Are they good?

2021
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:28,080
One. One, one, one, one, one, one.

2022
01:54:28,410 --> 01:54:30,890
They bring them over with three
different types of dipping sauce. Oh,

2023
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:36,060
but it's the duck fat. That's what does
it? Those fries, those McDonald's fries.

2024
01:54:36,061 --> 01:54:39,690
That shit's wack. So delicious. They
have the best ride. Mcdonald's. Yeah,

2025
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:44,150
you're crazy. In and out.
He's worries. Make Tom in
announced. Sorry. Hardboard no,

2026
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:45,510
no, no. It's like a real potato.

2027
01:54:45,511 --> 01:54:50,511
You fuck it actually tastes like a
potato in and out is fucking fantastic.

2028
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:52,980
Oh good. It's good. I don't think
they'd beat Mcdonald's fries.

2029
01:54:52,981 --> 01:54:56,580
You know it's better than both of them.
Better than both of them. Five guys fries,

2030
01:54:56,610 --> 01:55:00,510
burglaries them in the fucking ground.
How dare you nod your head. Side to side.

2031
01:55:00,511 --> 01:55:05,310
Jamie, you son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch. Trust me.

2032
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:09,840
Five guys fries. Fox, everybody
up. Plus they have a Cajun version.

2033
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:14,460
You can get Cajun fries. Oh,
what did I say? Yes, they
give it to you in a fucking,

2034
01:55:14,610 --> 01:55:18,750
like one of those movie was movie barrels
where they give you popcorn after they

2035
01:55:18,751 --> 01:55:21,090
give you your fries. You never
need all your fries at five guys.

2036
01:55:21,091 --> 01:55:22,020
Good fucking luck.

2037
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:26,320
Cajun seasoning is the,
uh, the best can. I mean,

2038
01:55:26,330 --> 01:55:30,680
that just makes anything
better. All Freezer, all fries
are good for at the Cajun.

2039
01:55:30,681 --> 01:55:32,600
But five guys does have a great Friday.

2040
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:37,080
I usually don't fuck with Cajun spices
on steak. I usually like steak, you know,

2041
01:55:37,081 --> 01:55:41,690
like pepper and salt and that's it.
But I had occasion Ribeye at, uh,

2042
01:55:41,730 --> 01:55:44,070
that place we went to the other day.
Lordy.

2043
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:48,060
Oh, it was perfect. Not too overpowering.
Just that right amount of spice.

2044
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:53,160
Oh yeah. Their day. That looks amazing.

2045
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:57,480
Of what delicious steak you're reading
or meat. Oh, uh, which one was it?

2046
01:55:58,620 --> 01:56:02,400
Oh, the bear. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
That was, uh, not the one I shot.

2047
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:06,390
That was one that was, uh, someone in camp
shot. It was the first time I ever, well,

2048
01:56:06,391 --> 01:56:11,040
I had bear sausage before that I liked.
Um, but I'd never had like a bear stake,

2049
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:14,270
like right off the bear was it taste
like taste delicious. Very Gamey.

2050
01:56:14,290 --> 01:56:18,480
Is it is it tastes like a pig. Fucked a
deer and you had to cook it. Well done.

2051
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:19,490
That's good.
Yeah.

2052
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:24,860
Well the problem with bear is the same
problem with pork and it's that they eat

2053
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,110
animals and when they eat animals,

2054
01:56:28,111 --> 01:56:31,230
you have to worry about them having
tricky gnosis because tricker gnosis comes

2055
01:56:31,231 --> 01:56:34,600
from eating an animal that has
tricky gnosis. So like a aisle,

2056
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:39,630
they say 90% of all the cases of tricking
osis according to my friend Steve

2057
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:44,610
Rinella, 90% occur in the United
States from people eating bears. Whoa.

2058
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:48,180
Yeah. That's the 90% of our
cases of chicken houses.

2059
01:56:48,190 --> 01:56:50,580
Think about how few people in
the United States eat bears,

2060
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:55,490
but that's 90% of the trickiness
cases as his bears are. Um, they're,

2061
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:58,830
they're predators. I mean, they
eat everything. They eat berries,

2062
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:00,150
but they also eat animals.

2063
01:57:00,151 --> 01:57:03,510
They're responsible for like
half of the Moose population.

2064
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:08,540
When you are in Alberta where I was at
half the babies get eaten by by bears.

2065
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:10,950
Weren't you scared to eating
that like turning trick?

2066
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:13,200
I mean getting turned to a bear?

2067
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:20,590
No,
just you have to cook it to 150 degrees.

2068
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:23,260
What's see what's,

2069
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:27,010
I think bear meat would probably be
super delicious if you were able to

2070
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:32,260
cook it medium rare. I would like
to try it that way because uh, it's,

2071
01:57:32,261 --> 01:57:34,050
it's good.
Um,

2072
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:37,840
in comparison to like a like
beef or something like that,

2073
01:57:37,841 --> 01:57:41,230
it has a more robust
flavor. Like, and if you,

2074
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:43,840
if you cook it like thin and you
have to kind of cook it well done,

2075
01:57:43,841 --> 01:57:48,841
it is very good but is not as good
as deer or elk because deer elk,

2076
01:57:49,541 --> 01:57:52,810
you eat like a medium rare,
almost a rare and it's delicious.

2077
01:57:52,811 --> 01:57:56,920
Like you see her like, like a deer
loin. You would take a slice of it,

2078
01:57:57,100 --> 01:58:01,120
you'd put like some pepper and maybe
some garlic salt on it and you would see

2079
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:04,390
writ on one side and sear it on the
other side. It's fantastic. You know,

2080
01:58:04,391 --> 01:58:07,090
you don't really have to cook it that
much because they don't have the same type

2081
01:58:07,091 --> 01:58:10,750
of, uh, parasites that pigs
do. So when you have pig,

2082
01:58:10,751 --> 01:58:13,780
you always have to like that smoke
pig was amazing. That ham that I made.

2083
01:58:14,050 --> 01:58:16,330
But you have to cook that for a long time.

2084
01:58:16,331 --> 01:58:18,760
It's got to be cooked all the way through
and it really breaks it down and it

2085
01:58:18,761 --> 01:58:23,290
becomes delicious. But it has to hit 150
degrees if it doesn't hit 150 degrees,

2086
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:26,470
that and Osis if it has it and it may not,
but if it does have it,

2087
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:30,850
you could get it. So in that sense,
pigs and Behr are very similar.

2088
01:58:30,851 --> 01:58:33,660
I liked them a lot, but I prefer, um,

2089
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:36,940
deer and elk and animals that
you could eat medium rare.

2090
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:39,760
Have you ever done the duck
shooting? Like the, no,

2091
01:58:40,230 --> 01:58:42,700
it seems like as you would love that
because that seems like target practice.

2092
01:58:42,701 --> 01:58:46,270
I wake like you're just like, yeah. Um,

2093
01:58:46,570 --> 01:58:50,350
the only problem that I have with that,
and it's just a small moral problem,

2094
01:58:50,770 --> 01:58:53,950
is that a lot of those ducks,
you just sorta clipping them,

2095
01:58:54,130 --> 01:58:57,790
like you're like tagging their, their
wings with like pebbles, you know,

2096
01:58:57,791 --> 01:59:00,670
like you're shooting shotgun pellets
and if you ever watch those things,

2097
01:59:00,671 --> 01:59:04,150
a lot of those ducks are like still
flying after they get hit and then they

2098
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:07,480
stumble and they lose a
lot of ducks that way.

2099
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:11,650
Like ducks just fly off cause
it seems kind of not specific,

2100
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:14,260
like you're shooting at them.
Boom, boom. But they spread out,

2101
01:59:14,261 --> 01:59:16,840
the pellets spread out.
And in a lot of ways,

2102
01:59:16,841 --> 01:59:20,170
and this is not a criticism
of duck hunting, I would
totally do it, but it just,

2103
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:24,250
there's one thing that fucks with me and
that's that I think that a lot of them,

2104
01:59:24,251 --> 01:59:25,420
you're like barely going to hit.

2105
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:27,910
You're going to hit like a
wing or a foot blow a foot off,

2106
01:59:27,911 --> 01:59:29,890
and then they're still gonna fly away.
You know,

2107
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:33,820
you're going to shoot a lot of them
and drop them out of the sky. But if I,

2108
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:36,850
you know, if you could shoot
one duck at a time with a rifle,

2109
01:59:36,910 --> 01:59:40,930
you could tune in on that doc. You've got
a cross hair on it, boom, the ducks gone.

2110
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:42,010
But when you're pumping,

2111
01:59:42,011 --> 01:59:45,520
led into the air [inaudible]
you ever watch those duck shows?

2112
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,050
Like sometimes they get them dead on,

2113
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:50,500
but sometimes they like catch him and
there was spiral and they're, you know,

2114
01:59:50,501 --> 01:59:53,500
they're, they're fine. They
just fucked up, you know,

2115
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:55,910
which happens with hunting too.
Um,

2116
01:59:56,110 --> 01:59:58,180
it happens especially
with the archery hunting.

2117
01:59:58,210 --> 02:00:02,530
Archery hunting is super dangerous and
it's dangerous. Obviously for the animal,

2118
02:00:02,531 --> 02:00:05,800
it's super dangerous, but it's dangerous
that you could, there's a danger,

2119
02:00:05,801 --> 02:00:08,920
a great dangerous should say that you
can wound an animal and not fatally

2120
02:00:08,921 --> 02:00:13,860
wounded. So you have to fucking practice
like crazy. It's really difficult to,

2121
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,690
to shoot straight like you
think like a bow and arrow.

2122
02:00:16,691 --> 02:00:20,440
Today's bows and arrows are way easier
than the bows and arrows of cowboy and

2123
02:00:20,441 --> 02:00:23,230
Indian days or the Mongol days.
They're way better. I mean,

2124
02:00:23,231 --> 02:00:27,670
they have super high technology of the
sites on them. The arrows fly straighter.

2125
02:00:27,671 --> 02:00:30,910
They're like aluminum jacketed arrows.
The um,

2126
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:34,740
the compound bows allow you to
pull like a heavy weight and it,

2127
02:00:34,741 --> 02:00:38,140
there's a lead off like an 80 pound bows,
like 80 pounds in the beginning.

2128
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:42,310
But then back here it's only
probably like 20% of that.

2129
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:46,570
So like when you have it at full draw,
you can hold onto it at full draw,

2130
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:48,340
but it's hard to stay steady.

2131
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:52,180
It's hard to keep that pin lined up on
the animal and you've got to [inaudible]

2132
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:54,910
especially a bear when they're
coming out of hibernation.

2133
02:00:55,420 --> 02:00:57,990
Their lungs are only that big.
They're small. They're like,

2134
02:00:58,970 --> 02:01:02,110
like a small volleyball size,
you know,

2135
02:01:02,111 --> 02:01:04,480
like one of those kids volleyball's
it's not like a big long,

2136
02:01:04,481 --> 02:01:07,810
like a deer has a big long and l has
a big lung because they're in the high

2137
02:01:07,811 --> 02:01:10,070
mountains, they're running around all
the time. It's, they have a lot of,

2138
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:12,040
but when these bears are
coming out of hibernation,

2139
02:01:12,041 --> 02:01:15,670
it's a very small area that you
have to hit. So it's not easy, man.

2140
02:01:15,671 --> 02:01:19,410
It takes a long fucking time to
get to a point where you, you,

2141
02:01:19,530 --> 02:01:23,350
you trust in your aim enough that you're
willing to take a shot at an animal

2142
02:01:23,351 --> 02:01:28,090
with a bow and arrow.
Serious Shit. Um, yeah.

2143
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:29,880
Yeah.

2144
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:31,140
Know anything about that stuff

2145
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,580
you said cowboys and Indians and bears.

2146
02:01:35,581 --> 02:01:39,710
I just keep thinking I'm helping blown
my mind is that the village people wrote

2147
02:01:39,711 --> 02:01:42,430
the original,
I'm a Gigolo.

2148
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:46,910
Like can you imagine how many van Halen
fans would get into an argument not

2149
02:01:46,911 --> 02:01:50,540
believing that the village people did
that first and what sounded like a little

2150
02:01:50,541 --> 02:01:55,400
bit of a catchy or version if you ask me,
like I sort of liked that hoppy beat,

2151
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:59,760
I think to bring it around full circle.
Those guys were kind of bear.

2152
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:01,690
Yeah,
exactly.

2153
02:02:02,070 --> 02:02:06,250
Because the barest one was the fucking
motorcycle cop or the, uh, the biker guy.

2154
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:09,250
They shot their arrows into each other.
There's a lot of references.

2155
02:02:11,070 --> 02:02:11,903
Yeah.

2156
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:16,660
So how many sit online that just Jessa
Jiggle it actually was written by

2157
02:02:16,661 --> 02:02:21,160
somebody even before that. Uh, I can't
find it now. I, it was that guy cares.

2158
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:25,360
I believe that. Yeah. That makes sense. A
lot of those songs are like old, you know,

2159
02:02:25,361 --> 02:02:25,571
it's,

2160
02:02:25,571 --> 02:02:28,810
it sucks when you find out that your
favorite version of the song was like a

2161
02:02:28,811 --> 02:02:32,950
remake you. Yeah. Or that they
ripped it off from somebody.

2162
02:02:32,951 --> 02:02:35,530
Like bill burr called me
up once and he's like,

2163
02:02:35,531 --> 02:02:38,560
you're not even going to fucking
believe this. Go look up.

2164
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:43,210
Led Zepplin rips off. He'd go, just
go, go look that up and listen to it.

2165
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:47,410
And there's like a compilation with a
made a youtube compilation of led Zeppelin

2166
02:02:47,411 --> 02:02:50,170
songs and comparison to
the songs they ripped off.

2167
02:02:51,930 --> 02:02:55,870
They're getting sued right now from
that one guy that sounded exactly like,

2168
02:02:55,871 --> 02:03:00,820
it's devastating. It's devastating you,
you, I mean, I fucking love Zeplin Dude.

2169
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,800
I mean,
and I can't take away,

2170
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:06,580
it doesn't take away from my love
of those creations, those songs,

2171
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:09,640
because the songs are
still fucking incredible,

2172
02:03:09,641 --> 02:03:14,641
but obviously obviously any song in a
band is a collaboration and it appears to

2173
02:03:16,991 --> 02:03:21,130
me that this was like an
unwilling collaboration.

2174
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:22,030
That's how I would put it.

2175
02:03:22,031 --> 02:03:27,031
It was someone else's art that they
appropriated and made a part of their art

2176
02:03:27,161 --> 02:03:30,730
and they created something amazing and
that is essentially what plagiarism is.

2177
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:35,290
If those guys had been a part of the
team and they work together, you know,

2178
02:03:35,291 --> 02:03:39,400
and this guy like, you know you need
cool then baby, I'm not a fool man.

2179
02:03:39,670 --> 02:03:42,700
I'm going to send you back
to school and you know,

2180
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:45,160
and the guy writes it all down,
you're like Yay. I like it. I like it.

2181
02:03:45,160 --> 02:03:46,840
Like let's go with it.
That would be fine.

2182
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:49,900
But if you hear that somewhere else and
then you just stick that in your song,

2183
02:03:49,901 --> 02:03:52,330
it doesn't make your song awesome.
No doubt. Whole lot of love.

2184
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:54,700
It's one of my favorite songs of all time,

2185
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:58,660
but that shit is almost directly
ripped off from some old blues song.

2186
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:02,860
I mean like a lot of the lines like our
directly ripped off from an old blues

2187
02:04:02,861 --> 02:04:05,540
song. It's hard to listen to man. Yeah.

2188
02:04:05,550 --> 02:04:09,220
If you just type in led
Zepplin like plagiarism. TMZ,

2189
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:13,120
there's like one from 2010. There's one
from 2014. There's one thing that goes,

2190
02:04:13,121 --> 02:04:16,420
it's just like a whole bunch of different
songs and lawsuits that have almost

2191
02:04:16,421 --> 02:04:19,350
all their songs are rip
offs. That's so crazy. Yeah.

2192
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:21,100
I wonder if that's going to
cost them all their money.

2193
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:24,370
That'd be fucking weird if all of
a sudden led Zeppelin went broke.

2194
02:04:24,730 --> 02:04:27,820
Like all those guys were broke as fuck.
Robert Palmer starts going on the road.

2195
02:04:27,821 --> 02:04:31,640
He's doing cover songs cause he owes all
this money and you want to hear one of

2196
02:04:31,641 --> 02:04:36,410
the, the the rip offs of Fuck Yeah.
This is according to the lawsuit, uh,

2197
02:04:36,490 --> 02:04:38,450
for dazed, confused, you know. Yes.

2198
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:40,790
Love that God damn song

2199
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:46,050
here is one of their big ones. Here
is the uh, I guess the rib offers.

2200
02:04:49,070 --> 02:04:52,390
Oh Great. That's the way. That's
the real version. That's okay.

2201
02:04:52,391 --> 02:04:53,500
Play in both playing together.

2202
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:04,710
Yeah.
Stays it

2203
02:05:07,630 --> 02:05:08,880
Bobby and shoes.

2204
02:05:12,570 --> 02:05:17,570
Clue as to where it's the name of that
band cause led Zepplin who's than a

2205
02:05:18,241 --> 02:05:21,750
hundred million Jake Holmes.
This is not bad though.

2206
02:05:21,751 --> 02:05:23,330
Play that a little bit
more and that's the deal.

2207
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:26,230
The only part is she. Okay. And here,
you know, of course the other one is

2208
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:32,220
right.
Mother fucker

2209
02:05:32,740 --> 02:05:33,573
crazy.

2210
02:05:38,630 --> 02:05:42,650
Lots of people talk,
few of them know

2211
02:05:44,610 --> 02:05:45,950
was created.

2212
02:05:48,010 --> 02:05:49,450
Dave, they're better. I'm sorry.

2213
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:51,750
I'm going to do the the Mexican
woman in the crowd. Yeah,

2214
02:05:57,710 --> 02:06:02,680
right. Yo, Yo,

2215
02:06:02,681 --> 02:06:04,300
Yo,
he did it better.

2216
02:06:05,550 --> 02:06:09,900
Yeah, I mean for sure. At the very least
they were influenced, but God damned.

2217
02:06:09,901 --> 02:06:13,510
Their lyrics are better.
The delivery was off the charts.

2218
02:06:14,450 --> 02:06:18,860
That's a fancy studio though. I'd like
to see that Jake guy in the same studio.

2219
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:23,060
This studio band was a mother fucker son.

2220
02:06:23,450 --> 02:06:26,480
That is undeniable.
It was not just a studio.

2221
02:06:26,481 --> 02:06:30,710
It was the fucking output.
Just that guy's voice,

2222
02:06:30,860 --> 02:06:35,120
that output. Who the fucking hit those
notes. Who can even seem like that?

2223
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:39,200
You know who the fuck things like
that man, play that shit again.

2224
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:42,290
Play the Robert Plant version
again. Just play it. Play that part.

2225
02:06:42,291 --> 02:06:44,690
I'm way past that now. I can do
it fellow. You can do it. I know.

2226
02:06:44,691 --> 02:06:45,800
You know how to use the
Internet to find the

2227
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:47,910
the stairway to heaven one
because it was way back,

2228
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:52,000
but I just want to hear that real quick.
It's gonna be a better producer boy.

2229
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,460
Damn

2230
02:06:58,460 --> 02:07:00,720
San Antonio now on him.
That was a crazy time.

2231
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:03,840
You talked to Joey Diaz about led
Zeppelin. If you want to get the,

2232
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:05,370
if led Zeppelin was smart,

2233
02:07:05,550 --> 02:07:10,550
they would hire Joey Diaz to narrate
their life story to just do a documentary

2234
02:07:10,951 --> 02:07:14,310
where Joey Diaz just explains led Zepplin.
Let me tell you something,

2235
02:07:14,311 --> 02:07:19,311
brother fucking dirty white guys from
swinging Dick on stage with fucking tights

2236
02:07:20,941 --> 02:07:22,260
on tights on Joe Rogan.

2237
02:07:22,261 --> 02:07:27,261
These giant cock is inches away from
women's faces and they're fucking losing

2238
02:07:27,730 --> 02:07:30,450
their minds.
They never seen nothing like this before.

2239
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:34,410
He talks to you about like the invasion,
like when LEDs up and first hit America,

2240
02:07:34,411 --> 02:07:36,040
I'm doing it. No, you have to

2241
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,640
hear him describe it. Like would that
song, the sound was, like I said,

2242
02:07:39,641 --> 02:07:41,080
nobody had a sound like that before.

2243
02:07:41,170 --> 02:07:45,640
So this is total new next level shit
that has opened up the door to a lot of

2244
02:07:45,641 --> 02:07:49,240
people's, changed a lot of people's
idea what songs sounded like.

2245
02:07:49,390 --> 02:07:53,350
Stairway to heaven. And I'm one
of those guys. I love, love,

2246
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:57,730
I love led Zeppelin but I'm one of those
guys that puts pink Floyd ahead of them

2247
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:00,820
any day of the week.
And that's interesting.

2248
02:08:00,821 --> 02:08:04,960
And put up a strong case for I know
it. I don't think you could. Oh yeah.

2249
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:08,050
Cause it's better for you. But for me
it's up. It's better than pink Floyd.

2250
02:08:08,210 --> 02:08:11,860
But Pink Floyd's a fucking fucking
amazing. What does this sit again?

2251
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:16,450
This is the whole, this is the guy.
Look at the guy above ground sound okay

2252
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:21,990
of Jack Holmes. Is Jack Holmes
dead? Cause that'd be super ironic.

2253
02:08:23,790 --> 02:08:24,630
Jake Holmes.

2254
02:08:32,870 --> 02:08:35,330
That's definitely the baseline.

2255
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:36,553
No doubt

2256
02:08:41,450 --> 02:08:46,000
she's sitting on his balls in
this country in shoes. Just Woo.

2257
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:48,430
That's pretty God. Damn
good dude. Be a clue as to

2258
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:56,160
do you lock a mouse and yeah,
I like it.

2259
02:08:56,710 --> 02:09:01,260
God damn good. I it's different but it's
pretty good. Pretty damn good. Yeah.

2260
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:06,360
Hi. And I'm being abused.

2261
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:14,660
And this Jesus is the crack
and see how he breaks it down

2262
02:09:16,550 --> 02:09:18,060
the right track.

2263
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,020
All right guys.
It wow comes early.

2264
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:32,080
That's pretty God damn good dude.
Yeah. Especially because it's,

2265
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:34,390
that's the original.
So you gotta think like it's,

2266
02:09:34,391 --> 02:09:38,980
it's much easier to listen to someone
and then add a bunch of shit to something

2267
02:09:38,990 --> 02:09:41,710
that they've sort of the foundation.
Then the come up with the original idea.

2268
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:45,190
Totally. You know, that's,
but that's the joke thief way.

2269
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:46,540
That's what joke thieves do.

2270
02:09:46,570 --> 02:09:49,990
They'll take your premise and then they
change it enough so that they can get,

2271
02:09:49,991 --> 02:09:51,880
they can get away with it because
they made it better. Yeah.

2272
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:55,890
They just said more to the
backend. So let's hear the,
the Robert Plant part. Okay.

2273
02:09:55,900 --> 02:10:00,670
Hold on a sec. Yeah, I mean
that's almost like, exactly.

2274
02:10:08,940 --> 02:10:09,773
Well those are the,

2275
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,880
and Jake's version does
a courts and this is

2276
02:10:13,450 --> 02:10:17,850
good. Tell so long. That's not true.

2277
02:10:22,310 --> 02:10:26,940
Come on.
I want to fuck him.

2278
02:10:26,941 --> 02:10:28,810
And I'm a guy that I'm telling you,

2279
02:10:29,130 --> 02:10:32,910
these guys have these
guys said such better

2280
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:33,823
access.

2281
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:39,330
You would be in love

2282
02:10:42,690 --> 02:10:45,060
if you were in the audience and
you saw this, you'd be in love.

2283
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:52,380
Be So enthralled, especially
1971 or whatever. Fuck it was.

2284
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:53,653
Yeah,

2285
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:56,060
it's beautiful.

2286
02:10:59,610 --> 02:11:02,830
All right. Hair is a rip off for
sure. Check the yet. Definitely.

2287
02:11:02,831 --> 02:11:05,560
Now rip fucking off here is though.

2288
02:11:05,590 --> 02:11:08,920
This one I thought was kind of
messed up cause this guy even toward,

2289
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:10,300
I guess with,

2290
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:14,140
that's, that's the true medicine.
That's the Ari Shapiro opening.

2291
02:11:15,450 --> 02:11:16,610
It's called the Freddy Soto.

2292
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:20,960
This is a group called Taurus and the
song spirit and it's the one that's there.

2293
02:11:20,961 --> 02:11:23,120
They're saying is from
a stairway to heaven.

2294
02:11:23,121 --> 02:11:26,030
So here is a spirit first.

2295
02:11:28,290 --> 02:11:29,920
Look how weird they look.
Yeah.

2296
02:11:30,190 --> 02:11:31,630
See,
these are the people that don't make it.

2297
02:11:31,631 --> 02:11:35,650
The ones that look a little weird like
give it, they wanted a pretty boy.

2298
02:11:36,610 --> 02:11:36,791
Yeah.

2299
02:11:36,791 --> 02:11:40,930
That guy looks like can Rigo Montoya you
killed my parents who killed my father.

2300
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:42,033
Prepare to die.

2301
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:54,020
Do, don't, don't hate on the man's art.

2302
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,400
It's changed like it.
It's scary.

2303
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:02,420
He's got a funky mustache on one side
and the other dude is bald headed.

2304
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:05,780
You can be bald headed in 1971
or whatever the fuck this was.

2305
02:12:12,790 --> 02:12:13,623
Oh God.

2306
02:12:16,090 --> 02:12:20,110
Oh led Zepplin.
Oh my God.

2307
02:12:25,890 --> 02:12:26,723
Oh my God,

2308
02:12:30,970 --> 02:12:31,803
fine.

2309
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:41,030
Please don't steal our song.

2310
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:44,623
Oh my God.

2311
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:50,190
Where's this song though?
This is all music. I think.

2312
02:12:50,230 --> 02:12:54,460
I'm pretty sure that this
song doesn't have lyrics.

2313
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,670
I think this was a notes here.
Really?

2314
02:12:58,760 --> 02:12:59,593
Yeah.

2315
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:04,730
Well they, they got weird,
but it's their creation,

2316
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:09,940
but they took it to a weird place that
it's the spirit of the song right there.

2317
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:13,070
Absolutely. That's the song. Yeah.

2318
02:13:13,071 --> 02:13:15,500
I mean that's where it's easy
when you hear something like this,

2319
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:17,500
just sort of create and she's

2320
02:13:21,010 --> 02:13:25,090
see cause like you feel how it
bugs you or how it hits you rather.

2321
02:13:25,930 --> 02:13:28,450
And then you add your creativity to it.

2322
02:13:28,570 --> 02:13:32,100
Right. The writing though, that's, that's

2323
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:36,630
it in the lyrics isn't the
hardest part of the sun.

2324
02:13:36,631 --> 02:13:39,720
The hardest part of a song is
that part is that backbone,

2325
02:13:39,721 --> 02:13:44,170
that spinal cord of what's original.
What's different. I would've,

2326
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:47,430
I would've assumed that you're right,
but I don't know Jack Shit about music.

2327
02:13:47,950 --> 02:13:50,340
How much do you know about music?
A pretty good amount.

2328
02:13:51,210 --> 02:13:54,120
I can play a lot of things.
Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Do Piano.

2329
02:13:54,150 --> 02:13:57,950
I have what they call perfect pitch. You
know what that is? You're a girl. No,

2330
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:02,460
no perfect pitch is like one or two,
one or 2% of,

2331
02:14:02,590 --> 02:14:04,950
they don't know why it's not
like genetic or anything,

2332
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:09,980
but one or 2% of people can
hear music like exactly.

2333
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:13,230
So that if I play something or
if I'm in front of an instrument,

2334
02:14:13,231 --> 02:14:17,940
I can remember where that sound is and
know that it's a hard thing to explain,

2335
02:14:17,941 --> 02:14:22,080
but I can hear at the exact tone of each.
How do you know,

2336
02:14:23,150 --> 02:14:27,900
um, you find out when if you
take like piano lessons or like,

2337
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:32,460
yeah, we are your people that play
by ear often have perfect pitch.

2338
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:33,600
If you've ever heard that term.

2339
02:14:33,601 --> 02:14:38,601
Like there's people that can read music
and play and then there's people that

2340
02:14:38,611 --> 02:14:43,350
can really like pick the Beethoven play.
Perfect pitch is a perception thing.

2341
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:46,050
It's not like a singer.
I thought it was like a singing thing.

2342
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:48,750
It's on a sound that you,
well, I know, well if,

2343
02:14:48,751 --> 02:14:50,700
let's say that it's singing for example,

2344
02:14:50,701 --> 02:14:55,701
like I know if I hit the note exactly
so it makes it a lot easier to hit the

2345
02:14:55,711 --> 02:15:00,650
note if you know that, huh? Yeah. I
thought it was an ability thing, like a,

2346
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:04,230
the hitting notes. I didn't know
it was being able to perceive it.

2347
02:15:04,410 --> 02:15:07,680
I thought it was just a setup to
make a sound that you can still,

2348
02:15:07,681 --> 02:15:12,360
you can learn it. Not Perfect pitch,
but you can learn how to make a sound.

2349
02:15:12,750 --> 02:15:15,660
Can you totally do. I mean, do
you have limitations on what?

2350
02:15:15,661 --> 02:15:17,690
Like I don't think I could
ever be a good singer. I know.

2351
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:21,060
I really don't think I have any singing
talent. Like, Oh, you'd be surprised.

2352
02:15:21,061 --> 02:15:25,320
Like Vicky Lewis who was on news radio
has an insane voice, like insane,

2353
02:15:25,321 --> 02:15:28,140
like opera level voice like she can,
and I would,

2354
02:15:28,230 --> 02:15:31,590
I would like a church joke around,
tried to sing. She would get offended.

2355
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:37,290
Like it was disgusting to her because
my clunky voice, I just, I don't,

2356
02:15:37,291 --> 02:15:38,870
I can't just hit songs,

2357
02:15:38,910 --> 02:15:42,480
but I've met people that they don't
even sing for a living. Right.

2358
02:15:42,510 --> 02:15:45,570
But they could sound, they sound beautiful
when they're singing. Right. Well,

2359
02:15:45,571 --> 02:15:49,410
it all depends. Like everybody should
just try to sing like themselves.

2360
02:15:49,411 --> 02:15:51,360
I just learned about this stuff recently,

2361
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:56,340
the singing part of things for that one
thing that I didn't care anyway. Um,

2362
02:15:56,580 --> 02:15:59,400
but like you have to sing
in your singing voice.

2363
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:03,330
You know how all this singer
sound different, you know,
Clapton and Tom Petty, hey,

2364
02:16:03,331 --> 02:16:07,020
is everybody doing it? They
like, he doesn't try to
sing like La la, la, la, la,

2365
02:16:07,021 --> 02:16:10,890
la La. He just goes with it and she's
a new can girl. You know what I mean?

2366
02:16:12,830 --> 02:16:13,380
Right.

2367
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:17,700
So if you sing like how you sound instead
of trying to sing like what we think a

2368
02:16:17,701 --> 02:16:22,110
good singer sounds like, then you can kill
it because everybody sounds different.

2369
02:16:22,111 --> 02:16:24,630
They'll call and sounds
different than Roger Waters.

2370
02:16:24,631 --> 02:16:27,840
Cause according to David Gilmore
road, Robert Plant. Yeah.

2371
02:16:27,870 --> 02:16:30,100
I knew this dude who was in a,
and it was super

2372
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:34,120
cocky dude. And then I finally
listened to his music. He's cocky,

2373
02:16:34,121 --> 02:16:35,140
bordering Douchey,

2374
02:16:35,710 --> 02:16:40,120
and I listened to some music and the
guy sounded exactly like Chris Cornell.

2375
02:16:40,121 --> 02:16:43,060
And when I say exactly,
I mean fucking exactly.

2376
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:46,690
I thought it was like some lost
Soundgarden song from the early days.

2377
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:50,290
I was listening to the exact same,
that same influx.

2378
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:52,420
It was like me doing a
Joey Diaz impression. Yeah.

2379
02:16:52,570 --> 02:16:55,690
Like if I just started talking
like Joey Diaz or a onstage look,

2380
02:16:55,691 --> 02:16:59,630
if I went on stage and just pretend that
this is me now and now what's up cock

2381
02:16:59,670 --> 02:17:03,730
sucker. Where you at? Bitch, come
on. You would go, oh my God, he's,

2382
02:17:04,030 --> 02:17:05,800
he's doing a Joey Diaz impression,
right?

2383
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:09,760
That's how much this guy sounded like
Chris Cornell. Oh yeah, we got, we got,

2384
02:17:09,761 --> 02:17:11,690
you're a Voodoo.
Punani Nah,

2385
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:17,440
don't play it away. How dare
you. Different voices are fun.

2386
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:20,450
That's why I like the crash test
dummies. You ever heard of them? Yeah.

2387
02:17:21,030 --> 02:17:24,040
Talks like this and everything.
And then when this song comes in,

2388
02:17:24,041 --> 02:17:27,070
it's like a totally different,
you can't fuck with checks though.

2389
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:31,090
Chicks of the best sounding voices. My
opinion, I mean, I like Robert Plant.

2390
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:33,460
He's got a bad ass voice.
But Janis Joplin,

2391
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:37,090
if I had to choose between listening to
Janis Joplin sang a song or Robert Plant,

2392
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:42,400
Oh yeah, that checked that
things gold finger pull up.

2393
02:17:42,550 --> 02:17:44,020
Take another little piece of my heart.

2394
02:17:46,820 --> 02:17:51,280
Why are you laughing? You don't know that
Janis Joplin Song. Right? It's great to

2395
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:54,233
take it.

2396
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:58,530
She was a fucking genius or me and
Bobby McGee. That's another one.

2397
02:17:59,490 --> 02:18:03,270
She was a god damn genius. Yeah.
Roller Skates is great. Yeah.

2398
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:09,100
Yeah, that's right. We're the beamer

2399
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:12,930
or ways a Mercedes Benz.
Oh Lord.

2400
02:18:19,170 --> 02:18:21,270
When I see shit like this,
when I listen to this,

2401
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:25,560
I see in my head like a
documentary on the sixties toe.

2402
02:18:25,730 --> 02:18:28,410
That's what I see a
politician talking about.

2403
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:31,050
These were innocent
times for scoring people.

2404
02:18:31,290 --> 02:18:35,630
This summer we're
embracing this new wave of,

2405
02:18:35,690 --> 02:18:40,290
of being there was sweeping the
nation and uh, we were a part of it.

2406
02:18:40,291 --> 02:18:41,660
We were at ground zero.
Yeah,

2407
02:18:41,730 --> 02:18:46,140
it was Berkeley in 1969
and it was all going on.

2408
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:50,820
It was the freedom of summer put
play and pick her up. Crank her up,

2409
02:18:51,980 --> 02:18:56,520
listen to this
town.

2410
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:21,260
No one of the things is so bad ass about
her when she would sing the pain in her

2411
02:19:21,931 --> 02:19:22,764
voice,

2412
02:19:26,370 --> 02:19:27,980
like the emotions,
her voice

2413
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:30,440
that check and experienced a lot of shit.

2414
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:32,230
It's one of those ones
that we get into it too.

2415
02:19:32,231 --> 02:19:35,620
She put her whole body and close
their eyes really get lost in it

2416
02:19:41,410 --> 02:19:42,830
and she was ugly.
Yeah,

2417
02:19:42,930 --> 02:19:45,570
she,
she was ugly and she hooked up with a lot.

2418
02:19:45,571 --> 02:19:47,520
Are Rock stars good for her big time.

2419
02:19:47,521 --> 02:19:49,500
Everybody wanted her
even though she was ugly.

2420
02:19:49,501 --> 02:19:52,320
Every guy wanted a banger cause
they're like that fucking voice.

2421
02:19:52,350 --> 02:19:54,690
She's got no tits,
no ass in the face of it.

2422
02:19:56,360 --> 02:20:01,000
Of a guitar. The Hell Charlie Brown or
female? Charlie Brown. Yeah, he's awesome.

2423
02:20:01,090 --> 02:20:05,820
Come on, Joey did. That
is scary. Oh my God.

2424
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:09,060
Is that her?
Is that the exorcist is,

2425
02:20:09,070 --> 02:20:11,980
she looks like gimme it get a good
picture of it. Find a good picture of her

2426
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:19,410
and I say ugly, like she's better
looking than me. How's it girl?

2427
02:20:19,820 --> 02:20:23,550
I don't know. She's pretty scary,
right? Like your ass instead of hers.

2428
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:26,940
I think you could probably look
my ass. Period. Just for a story.

2429
02:20:28,370 --> 02:20:30,540
Just to be able to go on
and kill Tony talking about

2430
02:20:33,450 --> 02:20:36,590
she was okay.
Hippie chick put up a good one.

2431
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:41,880
Oh my tutee. Oh, there's
a cute, if you're on acid,

2432
02:20:41,881 --> 02:20:45,840
you'd see your soul, your
lower soul or souls. Beautiful.
Complex. Like an old wine.

2433
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:49,470
It's got that. Face flies.
I bet. How dare you. Oh,

2434
02:20:50,020 --> 02:20:53,160
my teeth are a little crooked. Other
than that, it's fine looking Gal.

2435
02:20:53,220 --> 02:20:55,960
Everything's crooked.
Look at that thing rude.

2436
02:20:56,130 --> 02:20:58,350
It's got demos through
one side of her face.

2437
02:20:58,410 --> 02:21:02,340
If I had to choose one woman to listen to
sing and she's up there. Amy Winehouse,

2438
02:21:02,670 --> 02:21:05,100
she's up there to Suzanne
Santo from honey. Honey,

2439
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:08,070
it's right at the top of the God
damn list. She's got some new songs.

2440
02:21:08,071 --> 02:21:11,220
I wish we could play him, but she
didn't give me permission. I play uh,

2441
02:21:11,250 --> 02:21:14,790
some of our new shit. God
Damn Dude. Black women, man,

2442
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:17,920
I want to shoot a lot of things. She'd
let us play. Are we allowed to? Oh sure.

2443
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:18,800
I'm glad too.

2444
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:23,800
Black women have this thing where they
have the most powerful vocal chords.

2445
02:21:24,410 --> 02:21:26,660
That lady that sings
gold finger from bond.

2446
02:21:26,661 --> 02:21:30,020
Did you ever see that live
performance like the Oscars or Emmy's?

2447
02:21:30,021 --> 02:21:34,140
A couple of years ago she got a standing
ovation afterwards. Solution Super. I,

2448
02:21:34,141 --> 02:21:37,340
it's, I can't believe, I can't
think of her name. She's the,

2449
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:43,220
she's like the most respected Grace Jones,

2450
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:46,100
something like that. If you're just
here, if you look up gold finger,

2451
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:49,690
I guess Grace Jones. Grace Jones was
that black chick with the crazy haircut.

2452
02:21:49,730 --> 02:21:52,430
Yeah, like that Max head. You're
in black mixed hedge Max headroom.

2453
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:57,400
Grace Jones was a, she used to
date Dolph Lundgren. Surely Lacey.

2454
02:21:57,620 --> 02:22:01,450
Yeah, that surely Basset, right? Yeah.

2455
02:22:01,550 --> 02:22:03,050
She is a cold blooded killer.

2456
02:22:03,110 --> 02:22:08,060
This is one where she got it and when she
does that, she's standing in when she,

2457
02:22:08,210 --> 02:22:12,620
she can clincher arms and it
makes the sound come from Kohl's.

2458
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:20,330
She didn't, she know Polo and then go
low to high her range, which is thing.

2459
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:24,790
Some people can do high, some people
can do low. She's one of those monsters.

2460
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:25,980
A lot

2461
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,750
of those guys clapped and pink Floyd.

2462
02:22:27,751 --> 02:22:32,520
They'd only work with black nurse
home owner. That's what it was. Yeah.

2463
02:22:32,521 --> 02:22:34,360
Everything sounds better
with a half boner.

2464
02:22:34,490 --> 02:22:39,170
Yeah. Pull up a honey honey. Uh, Angel of
death when they were alive on the roof.

2465
02:22:39,590 --> 02:22:42,080
This a video that they did.
I wanted to play one of the new songs,

2466
02:22:42,081 --> 02:22:45,900
but I can't get permission. So, uh, it
till I hear from her, I sent her a text.

2467
02:22:45,901 --> 02:22:48,500
If she texted me back during the shovel,
we'll try to play it,

2468
02:22:48,860 --> 02:22:52,640
but a video we're in. Yeah, that's
angel of death. But don't play that one.

2469
02:22:52,641 --> 02:22:55,460
Play the live one on the roof because
the live one on the roof is acoustic,

2470
02:22:55,461 --> 02:22:59,930
so you really get a chance to, to
hear her voice. This is a net, Brian,

2471
02:23:00,230 --> 02:23:01,220
is it? Yeah. Okay.

2472
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:07,320
It's Tony Chirping.
It's me.

2473
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:12,160
Yeah. This is how I found out about
these guys. They're moving back to la.

2474
02:23:12,161 --> 02:23:13,630
They gave up on Nashville.
God,

2475
02:23:14,290 --> 02:23:17,440
they heard that a few too many
n bombs and they were like, oh,

2476
02:23:17,441 --> 02:23:20,350
we're still in Tennessee
called angel of death

2477
02:23:31,100 --> 02:23:35,930
loaded until, ah, fine.

2478
02:23:36,070 --> 02:23:37,060
Do you,

2479
02:23:44,660 --> 02:23:47,700
isn't this an old village people song?

2480
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:51,960
Let's say,

2481
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:58,160
we'll just say they
never spend a single day.

2482
02:24:03,350 --> 02:24:04,420
I bet she's got talent.

2483
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:11,230
Yes. Yes. There have been many.

2484
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:14,053
Oh

2485
02:24:15,590 --> 02:24:20,430
yes,
I have treated them as you

2486
02:24:30,410 --> 02:24:35,410
tease day class Manny from Manny to you.

2487
02:24:43,110 --> 02:24:48,050
Hey,
I need to see them live again.

2488
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:51,240
Yeah, they're uh, they're moving back
here, so we'll get to see him for sure.

2489
02:24:51,390 --> 02:24:55,800
Tell me back. Yeah, she's the best. And
should they have a new tour out and uh,

2490
02:24:55,850 --> 02:24:57,310
yeah. If you go to a honey
honey band. Dot. Yeah. Dot

2491
02:24:57,310 --> 02:25:01,540
Com. Um, they, uh, they have their,
their schedule up. It's there.

2492
02:25:01,541 --> 02:25:04,990
They're fucking awesome. And Ben
is the coolest guy. He's so nice.

2493
02:25:04,991 --> 02:25:07,960
He's such an interesting, funny dude
too. He's a cool guy to be around.

2494
02:25:08,560 --> 02:25:09,393
It's interesting.

2495
02:25:09,430 --> 02:25:13,870
No one people that can do shit that you
don't have any interest in pursuing.

2496
02:25:13,871 --> 02:25:17,020
You get to just watch it. Like as an
observer. That's how I feel about,

2497
02:25:17,050 --> 02:25:21,640
about music. You know, music is not
something that I ever wanted to pursue.

2498
02:25:21,641 --> 02:25:25,210
So when I watched people do it and it
really good, I find it super inspiring.

2499
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:28,930
I never would've gotten into it at all.
However,

2500
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:32,320
I lived in such a bad neighborhood.
I grew up in such a,

2501
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:37,060
the worst corner of one of the most
dangerous cities in the country for years

2502
02:25:37,061 --> 02:25:40,560
it's been dangerous. But when I was
growing up, it was the most dangerous.

2503
02:25:40,561 --> 02:25:45,220
It's just houses getting
our sand everywhere. Makes
Detroit look like Youngstown,

2504
02:25:45,221 --> 02:25:47,350
Ohio. Yeah, that's a
bad, it's very dangerous.

2505
02:25:47,351 --> 02:25:51,790
The mafia versus the black gangs and the,
the black gangs versus everybody.

2506
02:25:52,090 --> 02:25:55,540
Notoriously one of the worst cities to
live in year after year. But anyway,

2507
02:25:56,200 --> 02:25:58,990
we had bars and all of our windows.
Uh,

2508
02:25:58,991 --> 02:26:02,890
it's just a thing that every house had
during that time, uh, late eighties,

2509
02:26:02,891 --> 02:26:06,520
early nineties, because people would
just, if they saw you leave your house,

2510
02:26:06,521 --> 02:26:08,110
they break into your
house and steal whatever.

2511
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:12,910
But the only area that didn't have bars
in the windows was our dining room,

2512
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:17,500
a window area. But since we, there
weren't bars in the windows. We,

2513
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:22,540
my mom had an old upright piano that
leaned up against those windows,

2514
02:26:22,541 --> 02:26:24,340
so the light wouldn't even
come through the windows.

2515
02:26:24,670 --> 02:26:27,730
The only thing that would block
those windows was an upright piano.

2516
02:26:28,510 --> 02:26:31,510
So there was always an upright piano in
the dining room when I was being raised.

2517
02:26:31,511 --> 02:26:34,960
So I'd play it and just goof around
on it as a kid. But sure enough,

2518
02:26:34,961 --> 02:26:38,350
just to show you how bad of a
neighborhood I lived in one time,

2519
02:26:38,351 --> 02:26:39,940
because there were bars on the windows,

2520
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:43,690
a guy with like an ax started breaking
through that window and broke all the way

2521
02:26:43,691 --> 02:26:46,420
through a piano and upright piano.

2522
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:49,450
If you know anything about the guts
of a piano, I'm in, first of all,

2523
02:26:49,451 --> 02:26:51,940
the outsides made a crazy
old wood and this and that,

2524
02:26:51,941 --> 02:26:53,050
and it's all wood on the inside.

2525
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:55,060
But there's all these metal
strings and everything.

2526
02:26:55,061 --> 02:26:58,450
They broke all the way through the
piano. Whoa. That's Youngstown for you.

2527
02:26:58,451 --> 02:27:02,650
Just the guy that started, he's
like, God, I gotta be close now.

2528
02:27:02,890 --> 02:27:05,320
Broke through the middle
of an upright piano.

2529
02:27:06,010 --> 02:27:09,280
And what happened to get
inside your house? I remember
they got inside my house,

2530
02:27:09,281 --> 02:27:13,600
they stole a mine Nintendo and the VCR,
which now would be,

2531
02:27:13,601 --> 02:27:16,810
I mean the oldest intent,
the regular Nintendo and a VCR.

2532
02:27:16,811 --> 02:27:21,640
Probably today's like $20
worth of stuff breaking. Um,

2533
02:27:22,180 --> 02:27:25,270
remember pretty specifically. I know
I was close to probably about third,

2534
02:27:25,271 --> 02:27:26,620
fourth or fifth grade writing there.

2535
02:27:27,070 --> 02:27:32,070
I know that because my first grade
play Christmas play was in the VCR.

2536
02:27:32,291 --> 02:27:35,050
It was so funny and we used to watch,
I used to,

2537
02:27:35,070 --> 02:27:39,040
I mean everybody in the family used to
watch it because it was so stupid. I was,

2538
02:27:39,041 --> 02:27:42,760
I was a star and I had a giant
head and I was so unacceptable.

2539
02:27:42,761 --> 02:27:44,350
Like they didn't want
to give me a good role,

2540
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:48,250
so they just put a star
around my neck with a string.

2541
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:50,260
So we'd always watch it
cause it'd be funny in that.

2542
02:27:50,261 --> 02:27:53,500
And that was in the VCR when they stolen,
there was no way to get that back,

2543
02:27:53,501 --> 02:27:56,920
you know? So that's why it really
stuck out hock. Yeah. Really

2544
02:27:57,140 --> 02:27:59,610
be a weird feeling to, to feel that
vulnerable. Like someone could break in

2545
02:27:59,930 --> 02:28:02,210
every night.
I was scared every single night.

2546
02:28:02,330 --> 02:28:04,210
Every single night I went
to better phrase, right.

2547
02:28:04,290 --> 02:28:07,320
We caught somebody breaking into
my house when I was really just,

2548
02:28:07,321 --> 02:28:11,090
it was like there weren't no, no, I
should, I should correct. It wasn't,

2549
02:28:11,270 --> 02:28:13,610
they weren't breaking in my house. They're
breaking in our car, which to right.

2550
02:28:13,880 --> 02:28:15,960
Right by the window.
And um,

2551
02:28:16,430 --> 02:28:19,430
I'm sure somebody probably would have
broken into our house, but we were home.

2552
02:28:19,820 --> 02:28:22,100
They probably knew her home.
I lived in Jamaica

2553
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:26,090
plain, which was not nearly as bad as
Youngstown, but it was, it was sketchy,

2554
02:28:26,180 --> 02:28:28,130
especially now that now
it's all gentrified.

2555
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:30,110
But back then it was pretty
fucked up and we caught,

2556
02:28:30,111 --> 02:28:32,870
this dude was right outside my window.
He's breaking into a car.

2557
02:28:32,871 --> 02:28:35,060
I remember seeing him run,
who's my,

2558
02:28:35,570 --> 02:28:38,390
my stepfather opened up the window and
yelled something or something. I forget.

2559
02:28:38,391 --> 02:28:40,910
There was some sort of an altercation,
like get the fuck out of there.

2560
02:28:41,330 --> 02:28:43,910
And then I remember like looking
down, because I had a, with my window,

2561
02:28:43,911 --> 02:28:46,900
my bedroom window was above the car
looking down and seeing this guy run off.

2562
02:28:46,950 --> 02:28:48,020
I was like,
this is fucking

2563
02:28:48,430 --> 02:28:50,350
Gary. Yeah. Really.

2564
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:55,500
It's really gross when you realize that
somebody could mess with your stuff.

2565
02:28:56,100 --> 02:28:57,210
Well,
it's a weird feeling too.

2566
02:28:57,211 --> 02:28:59,880
Like you don't hear noises and then
you think this might really be someone

2567
02:28:59,881 --> 02:29:02,520
breaking in this time. Beanies.
That's what they would call them.

2568
02:29:02,580 --> 02:29:05,340
Kids in the neighborhood would
do it all the time. Oh, you know,

2569
02:29:05,341 --> 02:29:09,840
he's been to Juvie for a beanie. It was
like normal breaking an entering. Yeah.

2570
02:29:10,410 --> 02:29:15,330
Normal. No murders, bacon and
eggs over there. Very few murders.

2571
02:29:15,331 --> 02:29:18,660
Just a lot of crime. But it was,
it was possible to get murdered.

2572
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:21,390
You know when you have a bunch of fucking
creepy people that had been in jail a

2573
02:29:21,391 --> 02:29:24,720
bunch of times and they're around a bunch
of other creepy people and there's a

2574
02:29:24,721 --> 02:29:28,170
lot of poverty and a lot of drugs
and fucking shit happens, man

2575
02:29:28,590 --> 02:29:32,210
kicking it all becomes acceptable. And
then the little brother is, and the,

2576
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:36,030
and the younger people see their older
brother's doing it and they think it's

2577
02:29:36,031 --> 02:29:39,510
cool and that that's a part of life.
And then, you know, it's crazy.

2578
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:42,090
It's also a weight. Guys make
money, you know, to be honest,

2579
02:29:42,091 --> 02:29:43,110
to break into someone's house,

2580
02:29:43,111 --> 02:29:46,330
you steal their TV and now you have a
thousand bucks, like, Holy Shit. Yeah.

2581
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:50,400
It's fucked. The that, that doesn't
happen too much in rich neighborhoods.

2582
02:29:50,430 --> 02:29:54,390
Rich neighborhoods. Dude's
very rarely break into each
other's houses. Super Rare.

2583
02:29:54,570 --> 02:29:58,350
Yeah. It's something that only
happens if one person's got something,

2584
02:29:58,351 --> 02:30:00,780
the other person wants it.
What do you can get your own shit?

2585
02:30:00,781 --> 02:30:04,380
Shit doesn't mean as much. That becomes
a different thing. Become something.

2586
02:30:04,381 --> 02:30:06,300
How you judge each other.
That's where it's stupid,

2587
02:30:06,301 --> 02:30:09,840
but a lot fucking better
than living in poverty. Yeah.

2588
02:30:11,370 --> 02:30:14,580
Yeah. It was crazy. Youngest had a lot of
boxers come out of there. A lot of them.

2589
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:17,650
Boom, boom, man. Sini
Kelly the ghost town. Yeah.

2590
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:21,280
Kelly Perry Roya. How are you? Royal. Wow.

2591
02:30:21,310 --> 02:30:24,790
Kelly Pavlock had my favorite fight
that I've ever seen in all of boxing.

2592
02:30:24,970 --> 02:30:29,740
The Jermaine Taylor fied. Yeah,
yeah. Got An iPhone twice. They both,

2593
02:30:29,741 --> 02:30:32,710
neither one of them had ever been
knocked down in their entire professional

2594
02:30:32,711 --> 02:30:35,260
career. Not once. And
they both went down twice.

2595
02:30:35,500 --> 02:30:39,920
It was a great fight. Yeah. Pavlik was a
beast. Like the booze though. That's it.

2596
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:42,230
Yeah, that'll fuck you man. But again,

2597
02:30:42,231 --> 02:30:45,590
I think a lot of these guys that liked
the booze part of it is just the pressure.

2598
02:30:45,950 --> 02:30:46,521
Yeah.
You know,

2599
02:30:46,521 --> 02:30:50,300
the pressure of being a professional
fighter has gotta be so staggering.

2600
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:54,880
And in Youngstown, that's what your
Todd is. His drink, the pain away.

2601
02:30:55,930 --> 02:30:59,840
When he, every time he would go back
home, he was the king of Youngstown down.

2602
02:30:59,860 --> 02:31:03,340
And when you do that, you're just hanging
out at bars with your friends anyway.

2603
02:31:03,341 --> 02:31:06,100
And every single person that walks
in, hey, let me buy you a drink.

2604
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:08,350
It's months until your next fight.
You know,

2605
02:31:08,351 --> 02:31:11,300
they don't realize it's a professional
athlete and he needs to make your mind.

2606
02:31:11,390 --> 02:31:11,760
Kelly,

2607
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:16,760
what do you exactly how everybody
talks too good for a Jack Gum on Kelly.

2608
02:31:16,871 --> 02:31:19,980
Let me buy you a drink. Jack on
the rocks. Muck killing white

2609
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:23,280
castle, big whiskey and a beer and
ain't going to hurt you. You know,

2610
02:31:23,281 --> 02:31:27,150
I didn't know that white castle had
tiny food the first time I went there.

2611
02:31:27,800 --> 02:31:32,640
And so I got it go. I got it
to go. I remember specifically,

2612
02:31:32,820 --> 02:31:35,550
I was at my brother's apartment in
Columbus visiting him in college.

2613
02:31:35,560 --> 02:31:37,830
Went to the white castle.
He was at work across the street,

2614
02:31:37,831 --> 02:31:39,450
got a burger and fries to go,

2615
02:31:39,451 --> 02:31:42,360
went back and I was so disappointed
because I was starving.

2616
02:31:43,380 --> 02:31:46,020
Went back and got three or
four more burgers. Yeah,

2617
02:31:47,690 --> 02:31:48,840
those were the days.
Yeah.

2618
02:31:49,010 --> 02:31:51,700
How'd they get away with that? Just
making a little tiny burger. Super cheap.

2619
02:31:51,701 --> 02:31:52,534
One Bite Burger.

2620
02:31:52,600 --> 02:31:55,300
They used to be a nickel or something
like that to daddy and it was,

2621
02:31:55,301 --> 02:31:57,700
that was the whole thing and like
get a nickel burger, you know?

2622
02:31:57,730 --> 02:31:59,930
But it was a smart man. But
yeah, I mean how many of those,

2623
02:32:00,360 --> 02:32:03,700
it was a regular burger, a quarterback.
Then how much is the regular burger?

2624
02:32:03,701 --> 02:32:05,390
Probably it was probably more expensive.
It was.

2625
02:32:05,391 --> 02:32:07,090
It probably some kind of
marketing thing like, no,

2626
02:32:07,091 --> 02:32:11,530
we got right like cheap burgers and Nicole
Beggs. Yeah, news breaking news. Joe,

2627
02:32:11,531 --> 02:32:12,880
do you see that thing
I posted the other day?

2628
02:32:12,881 --> 02:32:17,770
Did you know the U S P s or the
post office used to deliver kids.

2629
02:32:18,040 --> 02:32:22,450
They used to put the postage on the
kid and these carriers would have these

2630
02:32:22,510 --> 02:32:26,260
babies and they would just like take
me on the train with them and then it

2631
02:32:26,261 --> 02:32:31,100
started like, like getting
out more. And they may use
Snopes this. Yeah. Yeah. It's,

2632
02:32:31,101 --> 02:32:32,470
it's real. Totally real shy, shy

2633
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:37,470
babies through the mail. Photos of it.
Yeah. You guys, what year was this?

2634
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:39,370
Early Thirties, I believe. Oh,

2635
02:32:39,390 --> 02:32:42,360
so people were just worried that baby's
going to get eaten by wolves back down.

2636
02:32:42,390 --> 02:32:44,280
They took a chance to the post office.
Yeah.

2637
02:32:44,281 --> 02:32:46,920
But the people that would deliver
him the photo that I may show you,

2638
02:32:47,010 --> 02:32:49,170
it's like the creepy stuff.
All child molesters, you know,

2639
02:32:49,180 --> 02:32:52,980
he's stealing babies when you
couldn't track shit online, you know,

2640
02:32:52,981 --> 02:32:54,420
who knows where your baby is.
All right.

2641
02:32:54,450 --> 02:32:57,180
I can just do whatever they want
with your baby for a couple of days.

2642
02:32:57,410 --> 02:32:58,890
It takes a while to get
your baby over there.

2643
02:32:59,110 --> 02:33:03,170
Are you sure? Male babies wasn't spelled
m a l e like you weren't looking at it?

2644
02:33:03,180 --> 02:33:03,460
Yeah.

2645
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:06,310
Wow. That's, uh, a mail
carrier with a fucking kid.

2646
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:10,920
That's insane. Would have
stamps on it. What does it say?

2647
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:13,880
Well, the, the tax making
it illegal in 1913 it was,

2648
02:33:14,150 --> 02:33:16,460
oh, scroll back. You
won't go up. Yeah, we're,

2649
02:33:16,490 --> 02:33:20,480
it was 13 it was legal to male children
with stamps attached to their clothing,

2650
02:33:20,481 --> 02:33:24,650
children road trends to the destinations
accompanied by layoff letter carriers.

2651
02:33:24,651 --> 02:33:29,651
One newspaper reported it costs 53 cents
for parents to mail their daughter to

2652
02:33:30,111 --> 02:33:33,980
her grandparents for a family visit as
new stories and photos popped up around

2653
02:33:34,190 --> 02:33:36,950
the country. It didn't take
long to get along on the books,

2654
02:33:36,951 --> 02:33:40,490
making it illegal to send children
in the mail. Wow. That's crazy.

2655
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:43,770
They should make a illegal
against keeping us postal service.

2656
02:33:44,050 --> 02:33:45,050
Keep them in business.
Yeah,

2657
02:33:46,450 --> 02:33:51,220
yeah, yeah. Postal Service is not doing
so good anymore. Imagine if you were,

2658
02:33:51,250 --> 02:33:54,010
you made your business on sending
letters. You're like, look,

2659
02:33:54,011 --> 02:33:55,990
the post office fucking slow.
Okay,

2660
02:33:55,991 --> 02:33:59,230
I can get a letter to your friend in a
day if you have something to say to him.

2661
02:33:59,231 --> 02:34:00,430
Just letters don't packages.

2662
02:34:00,490 --> 02:34:03,390
I can get it to them and then all sudden
the internet comes along and the email

2663
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:05,590
comes along. You're
like, fuck my business.

2664
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:06,533
Exactly.

2665
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:11,800
Imagine the guy just 15 years ago
that put all his money into male.

2666
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:16,870
He's like, well, there's one thing that
will definitely never go away. Listen,

2667
02:34:17,090 --> 02:34:22,090
people pillar always Guinean to send
letters in a timely fashion, taxes,

2668
02:34:22,260 --> 02:34:25,240
letters, and trains. Three
things that will never go away.

2669
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:29,140
No one saw text messages coming. No
one saw any of that comment. Right.

2670
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:32,050
The idea that you could get on your email,
on your phone,

2671
02:34:32,051 --> 02:34:34,870
your phone weighs a fucking
ounce and keep it in your pocket

2672
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:39,860
and the thing is coming in the mail is
a weird, everything should be digital.

2673
02:34:40,160 --> 02:34:43,010
Well, I think that they're going
to have two forms of delivery.

2674
02:34:43,011 --> 02:34:46,460
They're going to use drones and
they're going to use three d printing.

2675
02:34:46,790 --> 02:34:49,410
I think that's what's going to be a
lot of products in the future. Oh yeah.

2676
02:34:49,580 --> 02:34:52,430
I think you're going to have some sort
of a box in your house about the size of

2677
02:34:52,431 --> 02:34:54,710
regular home computer printer.

2678
02:34:54,920 --> 02:34:58,160
Need a bigger one for bigger things but
you're just going to own like you're

2679
02:34:58,161 --> 02:35:02,720
going to use like bitcoin
to buy the directions or buy
the ingredients or by the

2680
02:35:02,760 --> 02:35:05,000
uh, the, the, the, the
schematic work, whatever.

2681
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:06,800
You download that schematic into your,

2682
02:35:07,220 --> 02:35:11,060
your computer press print and that fucker
just develops it right there on your

2683
02:35:11,061 --> 02:35:12,140
box.
That's going to happen.

2684
02:35:12,220 --> 02:35:13,940
And the drones will have little,
the,

2685
02:35:13,950 --> 02:35:18,040
every house will have a little chimney
drop where the drone just goddamn Santa

2686
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:21,700
Claus. Yup. Say like you left your, your
iPhone at home where your phone at home,

2687
02:35:21,701 --> 02:35:25,210
right. It's going to know your phone
and said like, Hey, I need you to print.

2688
02:35:25,450 --> 02:35:26,770
Send me my phone.
So they,

2689
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:29,890
you would have to put it in a box because
you only have one license for that

2690
02:35:29,891 --> 02:35:32,090
phone and then it will reprint it in your,

2691
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:33,970
wherever you want to
destroy your original,

2692
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:35,620
the original one because
you only have one license.

2693
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:37,520
What if it becomes like a clone?
Like,

2694
02:35:37,521 --> 02:35:40,760
remember when you get a VCR tape that
somebody made off of a VCR tape and it was

2695
02:35:40,761 --> 02:35:43,340
kind of whack and like, God,
his phone's not so good.

2696
02:35:43,341 --> 02:35:47,510
It's a clone to clone of your phone.
A three d printed clone. Yeah,

2697
02:35:47,560 --> 02:35:49,580
but it's all the data
download cloud cloud.

2698
02:35:49,740 --> 02:35:51,060
Every time you drop your
phone that you're like, yeah,

2699
02:35:51,061 --> 02:35:53,640
I just need to send my phone again
and get her, you know, reprinted.

2700
02:35:53,730 --> 02:35:55,410
Yeah. You just get a new phone,
whatever the new one. Yeah.

2701
02:35:55,470 --> 02:35:58,110
Yeah man,
I got to do I clone six a

2702
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:58,581
well,
you know,

2703
02:35:58,581 --> 02:36:01,790
it'd be really dope if you could take
old phones and you throw them into the

2704
02:36:01,791 --> 02:36:05,180
computer and like dad eats him
up and build a new phone. Right?

2705
02:36:05,210 --> 02:36:09,090
Like whenever a new schematic comes up,
it can actually extract and recycle the,

2706
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:11,300
the,
the components of the device

2707
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:14,660
car. Like every day you go,
like, I want to drive today.

2708
02:36:14,661 --> 02:36:17,870
I want to drive a Porsche tomorrow. I
want to drive some, you know, whatever.

2709
02:36:17,871 --> 02:36:22,850
Shitty, but car, your transformer,
by the time we're printing out cars,

2710
02:36:22,851 --> 02:36:24,320
we're not going to even have cars anymore.

2711
02:36:24,321 --> 02:36:26,650
We're going to have little
thing that you just get in.

2712
02:36:26,660 --> 02:36:28,640
It looks like an egg pretty much,

2713
02:36:28,641 --> 02:36:31,910
and you're just going to
sit in it destination today.
You won't even tell you.

2714
02:36:31,911 --> 02:36:33,920
I don't even know why I'm doing that.
You're already in the thing.

2715
02:36:34,490 --> 02:36:36,770
I want to go to,
uh,

2716
02:36:38,050 --> 02:36:40,000
the roller coaster park and I'll go,

2717
02:36:40,220 --> 02:36:44,210
do you want to go to the roller
coaster park 37 miles away? Yes.

2718
02:36:44,900 --> 02:36:47,850
And then it, you can make it so
that it won't hit anything else.

2719
02:36:47,930 --> 02:36:49,050
Good goal or has it?

2720
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:53,110
I'll do you one better. I think we're
going to transcend physical reality.

2721
02:36:53,290 --> 02:36:54,520
That's what I think.
I'm not going to,

2722
02:36:54,550 --> 02:36:57,970
they're going to develop an artificial
reality that is more complex and more

2723
02:36:57,971 --> 02:36:59,650
rewarding than the physical reality.

2724
02:36:59,950 --> 02:37:02,620
And so no one will exist in
the physical reality anymore.

2725
02:37:02,650 --> 02:37:06,100
It would all be even maintained
from this artificial reality.

2726
02:37:06,101 --> 02:37:09,820
We will maintain this dimension from an
alternative dimension that we create and

2727
02:37:09,821 --> 02:37:13,540
children will be born instantaneously
into this alternative dimension because

2728
02:37:13,541 --> 02:37:16,450
the fucking fear upon fears
is that your kid will be born,

2729
02:37:16,470 --> 02:37:19,310
the natural world would get
eaten by animals. Fuck that.

2730
02:37:19,550 --> 02:37:21,080
There will be no children born.

2731
02:37:21,260 --> 02:37:23,750
We're going to figure out a way
to transcend the physical reality.

2732
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:25,940
So whatever consciousness
is when it's created,

2733
02:37:25,941 --> 02:37:28,880
when a man and a woman have sex in a
baby comes out of the woman's body,

2734
02:37:28,881 --> 02:37:32,960
that baby will immediately be transported
into an alternative dimension.

2735
02:37:33,140 --> 02:37:34,280
As it's being born.

2736
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:39,630
We're already in it. Maybe I saw your
post the other day and bug's life thing.

2737
02:37:39,740 --> 02:37:40,140
Yeah.

2738
02:37:40,140 --> 02:37:44,790
I had just taken all my DVDs out and
reorganize them and I had just looked at

2739
02:37:44,791 --> 02:37:47,530
bug's life cause I lost the DVD.
I don't know where it is. Yeah.

2740
02:37:48,050 --> 02:37:51,740
Dream about Dave Foley.
I was in a onetime in bear camp.

2741
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:55,640
I was in bear camp and uh,
I was a dream in a day.

2742
02:37:55,641 --> 02:37:59,990
Foley was like healthy and he
was like thin and Smiley. Yeah.

2743
02:37:59,991 --> 02:38:03,800
It was like when I knew him in 1994 when
I first met him on news radio and then

2744
02:38:03,830 --> 02:38:07,350
I got up in the morning and
I went upstairs and uh, uh,

2745
02:38:07,430 --> 02:38:11,060
I sat down in front of the TV and a bug's
life came on and there was Dave always

2746
02:38:11,061 --> 02:38:12,710
voice. I was like, wow, that's weird.

2747
02:38:13,490 --> 02:38:17,210
Cause he did that like around the same
time we were doing news radio, that guy,

2748
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:22,160
if I feel bad about any guy getting fucked
in a divorce proceeding, you want to,

2749
02:38:22,161 --> 02:38:26,390
you want to find the worst case scenario.
I mean not worst,

2750
02:38:26,391 --> 02:38:29,360
I guess worst was Phil
Hartman, his fucking wife
killed him when he's sleeping.

2751
02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:33,990
But close to worst of a guy
getting fucked over by a divorce,

2752
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:38,620
alimony laws and child support laws.
Look, look up Dave Foley and look, uh,

2753
02:38:38,660 --> 02:38:39,111
look up.

2754
02:38:39,111 --> 02:38:44,111
Dave Foley discusses a child support and
alimony from our podcasts cause it was,

2755
02:38:44,210 --> 02:38:48,920
it was heartbreaking because they got
him locked into a payment schedule based

2756
02:38:48,921 --> 02:38:50,630
on what he was making
when he was on news radio,

2757
02:38:50,750 --> 02:38:53,390
which was a crazy amount of money.
And he's on NBC.

2758
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:57,140
He was on a Sitcom and he was one of the
big stars of it coming from kids in the

2759
02:38:57,141 --> 02:39:01,730
hall. He was a well known comedian.
They gave him this great big deal.

2760
02:39:01,731 --> 02:39:05,450
And the show was sort of written
around him and Phil Hartman. And, uh,

2761
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:08,900
you can't expect to make that kind of
money your whole life. It's incredible.

2762
02:39:08,901 --> 02:39:11,210
It's incredible.
It's an amazing opportunity.

2763
02:39:11,211 --> 02:39:14,030
But the idea of a sitcom is
it's a once in a lifetime thing.

2764
02:39:14,030 --> 02:39:17,000
Very few people ever get one and
one that goes to syndication.

2765
02:39:17,270 --> 02:39:20,150
And what you should do is stockpile as
much of that money as possible because

2766
02:39:20,151 --> 02:39:22,100
the chances of getting
another one are quite slim.

2767
02:39:22,400 --> 02:39:25,400
But that's not how the divorce laws
look at it. They look at it like, look,

2768
02:39:25,401 --> 02:39:28,610
this is what you make.
You owe x amount of percentage of that.

2769
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,170
So if all of a sudden you make,

2770
02:39:30,470 --> 02:39:34,610
you went from $1 million a year
or whatever to $100,000 a year,

2771
02:39:34,611 --> 02:39:38,210
you still have to pay a half a
million dollars a year. Like you stay,

2772
02:39:38,330 --> 02:39:40,700
whatever the fuck it was. What
did it make up enough? Wow.

2773
02:39:41,230 --> 02:39:43,430
So he developed more than,

2774
02:39:43,490 --> 02:39:47,060
it was more than a half a million dollars
in debt that he could not pay off.

2775
02:39:47,090 --> 02:39:48,140
I mean,
I don't know what it was,

2776
02:39:48,141 --> 02:39:49,930
but I remember at one time it
was a half million. It was,

2777
02:39:50,900 --> 02:39:54,320
it was compiling and he couldn't get into
the country because if we went to the

2778
02:39:54,321 --> 02:39:57,470
Canada they would arrest him.
I mean it's crazy fucking shit.

2779
02:39:57,840 --> 02:39:58,730
He was having meetings.

2780
02:39:58,731 --> 02:40:02,330
They were refuse to reduce the amount
of money that he had to pay and it's not

2781
02:40:02,331 --> 02:40:07,331
like a matter of like them getting
money for food and money for housing and

2782
02:40:07,461 --> 02:40:08,630
clothing,
which totally makes sense.

2783
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:11,660
It was exorbitant amounts of money and
she was flying all over the country with

2784
02:40:11,661 --> 02:40:15,330
its money and going to foreign
countries and spending all this money on

2785
02:40:15,331 --> 02:40:18,060
redecorating the house. Like he would
talk about it and would drive him crazy.

2786
02:40:18,310 --> 02:40:21,390
It's, it's a, it's a wild because
Canada doesn't let you get divorced,

2787
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:23,400
like as easy as you
doing the United States,

2788
02:40:23,610 --> 02:40:26,940
you have to be separated from each
other at least at the time for a year.

2789
02:40:27,270 --> 02:40:31,380
But during that year she gets access to
your bank account because you have joint

2790
02:40:31,381 --> 02:40:35,550
accounts. So during that year
she would spend with impunity.

2791
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:38,250
I mean she would,
she would try to break him.

2792
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:42,870
She would try to break him with her
spending and though he talked about it on

2793
02:40:42,871 --> 02:40:47,790
the podcast and you see the guy was
just devastated by it. Just devastated.

2794
02:40:48,230 --> 02:40:51,960
Like that's a real extreme example.
Like one of the most extreme examples.

2795
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:55,170
Most of the time,
you know,

2796
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:58,500
it's like we were saying that that video
earlier with that kid was getting beat

2797
02:40:58,501 --> 02:41:01,440
up by that woman and he was doing the
selfie and he's like, stop assaulting me.

2798
02:41:01,590 --> 02:41:04,680
And then when the cops came she
said that he assaulted her. Right.

2799
02:41:04,890 --> 02:41:06,810
Thankfully he had that video.
Yeah.

2800
02:41:06,990 --> 02:41:10,020
I think in a lot of cases,

2801
02:41:10,050 --> 02:41:12,410
like when people split up
and when people get angry,

2802
02:41:12,480 --> 02:41:16,740
people go from love to hate and
in pretty extreme variation.

2803
02:41:17,010 --> 02:41:20,130
Like people who like
people who love each other.

2804
02:41:20,490 --> 02:41:24,750
When you don't love that person anymore
or that person don't, doesn't love you.

2805
02:41:25,080 --> 02:41:28,250
It's not just like you don't get
along anymore. Like friends. It just,

2806
02:41:28,350 --> 02:41:31,830
I don't hang around with them anymore.
It's like they stole something from you.

2807
02:41:32,040 --> 02:41:33,960
They stole a piece of your happiness.

2808
02:41:33,961 --> 02:41:37,620
They stole a piece of your love and they
get fucking angry and they'll make shit

2809
02:41:37,621 --> 02:41:40,440
up. They'll say, you touched your kids.
You did a bunch of creepy shit to them.

2810
02:41:40,620 --> 02:41:43,850
You'll beat them up. They'll beat
themselves up and blamed it on you.

2811
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:47,430
They'll hit themselves with shit and
blame it on you knowing that most of the

2812
02:41:47,431 --> 02:41:50,310
time cops are going to believe him
cause guys hit women all the time. Yeah.

2813
02:41:50,730 --> 02:41:52,980
It's scary to be stuck in them.

2814
02:41:53,490 --> 02:41:57,090
Crazy situation like that where someone
who used to get intimate with now wants

2815
02:41:57,091 --> 02:42:00,510
to lie and plot and do
anything to drag you down.

2816
02:42:00,950 --> 02:42:03,480
You got to have him back and see if
he's happier now because that really did

2817
02:42:03,481 --> 02:42:07,810
make me feel very sad when he was here.
Yeah. It made me sad too. I, you know,

2818
02:42:07,890 --> 02:42:12,060
I know he got a sitcom after that for a
bit and then they did a comedy festival.

2819
02:42:12,150 --> 02:42:16,380
Had Dave Foley just about two
months ago and understand them.

2820
02:42:16,410 --> 02:42:20,810
Was he doing on it was hilarious. It was
awesome. He's a funny dude, man. Yeah.

2821
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,100
He could have been spent in
doing stand up the whole time.

2822
02:42:23,101 --> 02:42:25,920
But we had a lot of fun.
He's always done a sketch,

2823
02:42:25,921 --> 02:42:29,820
comedy Improv and stuff like that,
but he could have easily been a stand up.

2824
02:42:29,821 --> 02:42:32,980
He's a very smart guy.
He's on a show now with Kin Jong and uh,

2825
02:42:33,150 --> 02:42:36,120
Ken wants to come on the show office. I
mean, we have both of them on. Oh yeah.

2826
02:42:36,121 --> 02:42:38,010
What's the, what show was
it? I don't know. I just,

2827
02:42:38,011 --> 02:42:42,030
I've been seeing them on
Facebook. Uh, they're filming.

2828
02:42:42,031 --> 02:42:45,510
It was awesome. Oh, 10 minutes.
We got to rub this picture up.

2829
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Tony Motha fucking Hinchcliffe time
flies by when we shoot the shit.

2830
02:42:51,900 --> 02:42:54,330
We gotta get you on killed Tony
Saying, oh, it'd be happy to,

2831
02:42:54,331 --> 02:42:59,331
if you didn't do in the devil's ball
sack k the comedy store come to a fuck.

2832
02:42:59,851 --> 02:43:04,020
Respectable venue and a, I'll race
you with my services. Of course.

2833
02:43:04,021 --> 02:43:06,470
Bring that pitch to the ice house.
I'll do it at the ice house,

2834
02:43:06,620 --> 02:43:10,500
but I can't go back to that place.
I just can't. I know too much.

2835
02:43:11,050 --> 02:43:12,400
I know to watch Tony

2836
02:43:12,460 --> 02:43:14,670
the next Friday you have open.
We'll just make it okay.

2837
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:18,300
Yeah. Okay. Let's do it. I would love
to do that. That'd be fun. And uh,

2838
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:22,480
if you haven't watched or listened to
kill Tony, you can catch it on a desk.

2839
02:43:22,481 --> 02:43:26,560
squad.tv. It's on iTunes
and also on desk squad. Dot.

2840
02:43:26,561 --> 02:43:30,390
TV is, um, the other one that we talk
about all the time. Thunderpussy yeah,

2841
02:43:30,480 --> 02:43:33,730
throwing to Pussy, which is a fun,
fun time with the right crowd.

2842
02:43:34,030 --> 02:43:36,400
Occasionally you get the wrong
crowd and it becomes a fuck fest.

2843
02:43:36,430 --> 02:43:40,510
But with the right crowd, the comedians
go on stage and just the audience,

2844
02:43:40,511 --> 02:43:42,640
he yells out ideas and the comedian
starts to talk about things.

2845
02:43:42,641 --> 02:43:46,930
They just re make comedy up on the spot.
It's very challenging but very fun.

2846
02:43:47,170 --> 02:43:50,380
And it's also a way that you wind up
coming up with a lot of new material

2847
02:43:50,381 --> 02:43:55,150
because you're just completely riffing
as long as the audience is cool.

2848
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:58,270
We've had both. We've had,
when the audience is awesome.

2849
02:43:58,271 --> 02:44:00,880
And the last time it was a dog
show, but yeah, that was, yeah,

2850
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:03,990
that was fun. The last
time, but those guys,

2851
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:06,480
there was a few people definitely
that were out of control.

2852
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:10,920
We bought a little bit of the [inaudible]
I went up first mind just so I knew it

2853
02:44:10,921 --> 02:44:14,040
was going to get out of control cause if
the three guys are bugging me I'm like

2854
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:16,110
oof,
this is a ticking time bomb.

2855
02:44:16,111 --> 02:44:20,010
And I tried to acknowledge them and
calm them down and let them realize that

2856
02:44:20,011 --> 02:44:23,820
they seemed wasted right from the get
the few people that were just out of it.

2857
02:44:23,821 --> 02:44:25,590
Like you're a totally,
you know when people,

2858
02:44:25,770 --> 02:44:28,800
you know audience members ways to
when they're like answering rhetorical

2859
02:44:28,801 --> 02:44:32,580
question, you know? Yeah. Like
you know what drives me crazy? No,

2860
02:44:32,581 --> 02:44:35,150
I don't know what drives you
crazy, you know? It's like

2861
02:44:35,470 --> 02:44:37,120
just trying to get attention.
That was a problem.

2862
02:44:37,121 --> 02:44:41,920
It wasn't simply a matter of participating
or yelling out topics they were doing

2863
02:44:41,921 --> 02:44:43,790
were they were like
trying to get attention.

2864
02:44:43,820 --> 02:44:45,330
They were trying to be a part of the show,
right?

2865
02:44:45,400 --> 02:44:48,550
Like the guy to the left whose buddy got
kicked out early and then he just kept

2866
02:44:48,551 --> 02:44:50,380
going like, dude, your buddy's
already been kicked out.

2867
02:44:50,381 --> 02:44:52,030
Like you guys are too drunk. Like, yeah,

2868
02:44:52,350 --> 02:44:55,120
you gotta learn how to handle your
liquor sign. Yeah. Do you know how people

2869
02:44:55,170 --> 02:44:57,180
we're looking at, you know, no thing is,

2870
02:44:57,181 --> 02:45:01,580
is that that show is also 18 and up
though. Yeah. That's not cool. No,

2871
02:45:02,110 --> 02:45:05,900
no. I don't know. They need to change
that. She, yeah. Am I allowed to tech?

2872
02:45:07,790 --> 02:45:10,960
Because I mean, I love, I love that
age group, but they just, you know,

2873
02:45:10,961 --> 02:45:13,560
if I know they're underage
drinking, going on, not there,

2874
02:45:13,561 --> 02:45:15,930
but maybe they came drunk
or whatever and it adds,

2875
02:45:15,931 --> 02:45:17,820
probably they could bring flasks.

2876
02:45:17,821 --> 02:45:19,570
Nobody's checking their bags and
they walked through the door.

2877
02:45:19,650 --> 02:45:21,700
All these problems that we
had at the last Thunderpussy,

2878
02:45:21,701 --> 02:45:23,010
it was at the beginning of the show.

2879
02:45:23,011 --> 02:45:25,770
So there's no way that they got drunk
at the Eisenhower came in strong.

2880
02:45:25,800 --> 02:45:28,960
So I think what's happening is people were
just coming like fucking balls, wasted

2881
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:32,690
10 year old kid that got kicked out,
just like so sad.

2882
02:45:32,691 --> 02:45:35,660
He was just sitting there on the bench
outside. And I'm like, what happened dude?

2883
02:45:35,990 --> 02:45:40,520
He's like, man, I got kicked out. I was
like, look, it's not the end of the world.

2884
02:45:40,580 --> 02:45:44,020
Got to realize like it's part of being
young. You fuck up, you get drunk,

2885
02:45:44,050 --> 02:45:46,490
do retarded shit and then you
realize you did retarded shit.

2886
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:50,000
So the next time you think you're going
to get into that same sort of situation

2887
02:45:50,001 --> 02:45:53,120
again, you correct yourself,
you'll be all right.

2888
02:45:53,180 --> 02:45:55,040
Then we saw he was so devastated

2889
02:45:55,140 --> 02:45:58,020
at the beginning of this next
Thunderpussy the one that we just did.

2890
02:45:58,050 --> 02:46:01,860
I spent my first three minutes on that
guy because I realize that if I didn't,

2891
02:46:02,190 --> 02:46:06,960
if I didn't acknowledge him right from
the get then cause Jeremiah even told me,

2892
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:10,700
cause he hosts it. So Jeremiah
went up first, then he
brought me up. Jeremiah goes,

2893
02:46:10,701 --> 02:46:14,420
I knew I purposefully
didn't double. Uh, you know,

2894
02:46:14,421 --> 02:46:18,170
I didn't want to seem like the bad guy.
I knew that you would like to take that.

2895
02:46:18,171 --> 02:46:20,210
So I didn't even acknowledge
him cause you know,

2896
02:46:20,211 --> 02:46:24,230
Jeremiah and I worked together a lot, uh,
like at the store. And just everywhere.

2897
02:46:24,231 --> 02:46:27,970
We're both, you know, both grinders.
So anyway, he knew. He knew

2898
02:46:28,540 --> 02:46:32,610
you're on Grindr. No, we don't
grind each other. No. Yeah,

2899
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:38,830
dog. No, it's out there on the grind,
you know, that's like a rap term. Yeah.

2900
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:41,740
Hustling.
He's hustling every day.

2901
02:46:42,780 --> 02:46:47,760
Everyday. Everyday. Everyday we bees
hustling's yes. Um, but uh, yeah,

2902
02:46:47,761 --> 02:46:48,190
so I

2903
02:46:48,190 --> 02:46:50,800
worse is that those guys think that
they're helping the show. Well,

2904
02:46:50,801 --> 02:46:51,400
that's the worst.

2905
02:46:51,400 --> 02:46:55,600
That's why if I'm first or second,
I have the chance to help out the show,

2906
02:46:55,601 --> 02:46:59,100
I go and you're not going to help the
show. You might be thinking that you're,

2907
02:46:59,120 --> 02:47:02,050
you know, I like, I've built over the
years of acknowledging these people,

2908
02:47:02,051 --> 02:47:05,350
I've built jokes on them. You
know what I mean? And you're,

2909
02:47:05,351 --> 02:47:09,670
you're gonna think you killed tomorrow
at the water cooler, but you didn't,

2910
02:47:09,790 --> 02:47:10,400
you know,

2911
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:13,440
you gotta just tell him the truth because
if they think then that they're going

2912
02:47:13,441 --> 02:47:17,820
to help the show, you got to nip it
in the, what is it? Butter, butter.

2913
02:47:17,910 --> 02:47:22,030
Brown. The bug. It's like a
plant. Nip it in the bud. Yeah.

2914
02:47:22,200 --> 02:47:25,710
That's what you're supposed to do. Yeah.
You actually pull it out by the roots.

2915
02:47:26,070 --> 02:47:30,510
That's the best way. Nip it in the bud.
What if it re rebuts true? You know,

2916
02:47:30,620 --> 02:47:34,380
why would you plant still alive? Don't
just nip it. Pull it out of the roots.

2917
02:47:34,420 --> 02:47:37,450
Then light that thing on fire. That's
what you're supposed to be, man.

2918
02:47:37,620 --> 02:47:38,230
Imagine though,

2919
02:47:38,230 --> 02:47:40,950
being 19 years old and getting drunk
and come to a comic show where you're

2920
02:47:40,951 --> 02:47:44,070
allowed to talk to the Comedians,
you're allowed to yell out ideas.

2921
02:47:44,280 --> 02:47:47,830
There's no four. I mean that's like part
of the fun when it works out great. Yeah,

2922
02:47:48,150 --> 02:47:51,720
but part of the problem with that is if
you get the wrong kind of kids in there,

2923
02:47:51,750 --> 02:47:55,530
especially young kids, 18
years old, hammered for the
first time yelling shit out.

2924
02:47:55,950 --> 02:48:00,020
Edibles and weed. Yeah.
Yeah. I couldn't fake ids

2925
02:48:00,090 --> 02:48:01,280
by the way.
Highly recommend.

2926
02:48:01,290 --> 02:48:05,040
See Louis C K is new latest episode where
as he catches his daughter's smoking

2927
02:48:05,041 --> 02:48:07,530
marijuana.
It's like an hour and a half long episode.

2928
02:48:07,740 --> 02:48:12,270
One of the best things I've ever seen
ever and Louis C K is a maniac man.

2929
02:48:12,271 --> 02:48:15,600
Are you? Are you watching any of his shit
or watching it as it was really good.

2930
02:48:15,990 --> 02:48:19,140
I almost went to watch it like
three more times in the kids.

2931
02:48:19,141 --> 02:48:23,610
The kids that used in at the actors, Bravo
to those guys. I mean it was beautiful.

2932
02:48:23,660 --> 02:48:28,280
Wow. His daughters are amazing and
they steal it a lot. All right,

2933
02:48:28,410 --> 02:48:31,350
so great. I haven't been watching
it. Do you watch game of Thrones?

2934
02:48:31,460 --> 02:48:34,970
Yeah. Don't talk about it though, is
a lot of people get mad. Oh, I bet.

2935
02:48:34,971 --> 02:48:39,650
Spoiler alert. I just caught up on
a, the episode this week. Last night.

2936
02:48:40,070 --> 02:48:43,990
Holy Fuck. Yeah. Such a good show.
After it's over, you just go home.

2937
02:48:44,230 --> 02:48:46,030
Fuck. You want to watch something? Great.

2938
02:48:46,031 --> 02:48:49,330
Watch a show on Netflix called the
writer's room and just go straight to the

2939
02:48:49,331 --> 02:48:51,520
game of Thrones episode.
It's the two writers.

2940
02:48:51,550 --> 02:48:54,470
They worked directly with George Martin.
So Jordan though,

2941
02:48:54,540 --> 02:48:58,120
they're the ones that take George his
ideas and then with their imagination put

2942
02:48:58,121 --> 02:49:02,770
it into film. It's two guys and
it's been to the whole time,

2943
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:06,940
but they don't work together.
They sit in opposite rooms.

2944
02:49:07,080 --> 02:49:10,680
They don't even work on the same episodes.
What one guy,

2945
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:14,100
they do one after the other,
so one does one and the one does the next.

2946
02:49:14,130 --> 02:49:16,500
And the reason why it's
so great in my opinion,

2947
02:49:16,501 --> 02:49:19,770
if you watch the this episode of the
writer's room called game of Thrones,

2948
02:49:19,771 --> 02:49:20,790
where it's these two guys,

2949
02:49:20,791 --> 02:49:22,740
you figure out that they're
just trying to outdo each other.

2950
02:49:22,950 --> 02:49:25,650
These guys are writing partners
and they're just trying to be like,

2951
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:30,240
I'm going to blow your mind
this week, Bro. Yeah, exactly.

2952
02:49:30,270 --> 02:49:35,210
That's incredible. Yeah. Pitted them
against each other. Yeah, exactly. Wow.

2953
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:38,880
But they're together, but they're against
it. It's sort of like, like pink Floyd.

2954
02:49:38,881 --> 02:49:42,630
If he had the, the two main guys, Roger
Waters and David Gilmore with notorious,

2955
02:49:42,631 --> 02:49:44,460
like when you hear a band breakup,

2956
02:49:44,490 --> 02:49:47,640
like it's sort of built off of pink Floyd
because they didn't play together for

2957
02:49:47,820 --> 02:49:52,260
20 or 30 years. The notorious
huge breakup at the massive peak.

2958
02:49:52,590 --> 02:49:56,260
And uh, but that's what they would do.
Like Roger Waters, it'd be like, you know,

2959
02:49:56,310 --> 02:49:56,950
hey buddy,

2960
02:49:56,950 --> 02:50:00,570
a under lead creative force and I
just wrote this album called the wall.

2961
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:04,140
It's a shame you didn't get anything in
on it. And David Gilmore and be like,

2962
02:50:04,200 --> 02:50:05,011
oh yeah,
mother fucker.

2963
02:50:05,011 --> 02:50:08,610
And he would go in a room and write
comfortably numb and come back with that.

2964
02:50:08,611 --> 02:50:12,870
But is the two biggest, you know, some
of the biggest guitar Solos of all time,

2965
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:17,310
which is the little pin. Yeah. With
his voice that David Gilmore does

2966
02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:23,250
and says that's the same thing.
Those two guys always hated each other,

2967
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:25,080
but they're a band and it,

2968
02:50:25,230 --> 02:50:29,670
and it helped because Roger Waters
would go check out these lyrics in this

2969
02:50:29,671 --> 02:50:32,940
baseline, bro. And then Gilmore, it'd
be like, Oh, you think you're a bad ass.

2970
02:50:32,941 --> 02:50:36,420
We'll watch this guitar solo. He would
try to steal the song from him. Wow.

2971
02:50:36,430 --> 02:50:36,751
You know,

2972
02:50:36,751 --> 02:50:41,400
by like laying it down or using his voice
and waters was smart enough to let it

2973
02:50:41,401 --> 02:50:43,560
all happen because
that's good for business,

2974
02:50:43,790 --> 02:50:46,310
isn't it?
Like every band that's ever a huge band,

2975
02:50:46,311 --> 02:50:48,590
don't they always have a problem with
the lead singer and someone else?

2976
02:50:48,591 --> 02:50:53,060
Like even fucking van Halen. Van
Halen broke up. David Lee Roth left,

2977
02:50:53,061 --> 02:50:54,200
they brought in someone else.

2978
02:50:54,201 --> 02:50:56,270
They brought in Sammy Hagar than
they brought in that other dude.

2979
02:50:56,570 --> 02:50:59,210
Remember that other dude who's the
other dude did they brought in for,

2980
02:50:59,211 --> 02:51:04,010
it was from a good band, but he sucked
it as the lead singer of Van Halen.

2981
02:51:04,011 --> 02:51:06,180
It just didn't work for whatever reason.
Yeah.

2982
02:51:06,410 --> 02:51:09,230
But think axel rose and guns and roses,

2983
02:51:09,950 --> 02:51:13,040
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards,
they keep it together. Totally.

2984
02:51:13,070 --> 02:51:14,630
But apparently like Keith,

2985
02:51:14,631 --> 02:51:17,360
Richard talked a gang of shit
about Mick Jagger in his book,

2986
02:51:18,170 --> 02:51:22,550
which is Steven Tyler. It was guys
Harris, but they left for a while. Right?

2987
02:51:22,551 --> 02:51:26,360
Didn't Joe Perry leave for awhile?
He did. Right? Yeah, I think so.

2988
02:51:26,720 --> 02:51:29,960
Joe Perry is a cool motherfucker. I'm
friends with him on Twitter. Really cool.

2989
02:51:31,190 --> 02:51:35,000
Joe Perry, um, he's a conspiracy theorist.
He didn't a lot of conspiracy theories,

2990
02:51:35,001 --> 02:51:38,540
man. Some wacky ones. But uh, like I
found a rock at the beach and I was like,

2991
02:51:38,541 --> 02:51:41,900
what is this rock? This is a volcanic rock
and a or media or something like that.

2992
02:51:41,901 --> 02:51:43,890
Cause it, how long has holes in it?
Couldn't figure out what it was like.

2993
02:51:44,190 --> 02:51:46,820
I remember looking at that and
it was, uh, apparently fish too,

2994
02:51:46,821 --> 02:51:49,910
that it's like a see stone. Yeah. Joe
Perry told me on Twitter. I was like,

2995
02:51:50,210 --> 02:51:54,170
what a crazy world we live in with Joe
Perry can give you explanations of what

2996
02:51:54,171 --> 02:51:57,740
kind of rock. Well, the
greatest guitars ever.

2997
02:51:57,890 --> 02:52:02,350
And he knows all about rock and knows
about shock and role, knows about geology,

2998
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:06,100
see rocks and shit. I'm Brian. You
got anything going on this weekend?

2999
