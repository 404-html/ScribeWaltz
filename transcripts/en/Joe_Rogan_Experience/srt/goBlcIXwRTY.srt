1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:04,860
Sometimes I feel like all these
problems are put there for a reason than

3
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:05,694
anything.

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,151
Oh,

5
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:06,990
you're so cute.

6
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:09,370
I know reason.

7
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,660
No,

8
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:09,920
no,

9
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,320
I just.

10
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,350
Anything is anything a solvable
including that happens,

11
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:14,810
happens for a reason.

12
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,050
When that stuff is all annoying.

13
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,491
It's annoying,

14
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:18,510
but then it's not right.

15
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,850
I'm with you.

16
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,830
I believe what you're saying.

17
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:21,151
I believe.

18
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,100
I believe it's anything.

19
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:25,350
Any human beings do incredible things,

20
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:26,184
man.

21
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,570
Just come up with.

22
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,860
Do you ever hear the story about Morse
Morse code like that was the most

23
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:36,160
revolutionary is the turning point in
history more because if you think about

24
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:36,450
it,

25
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,410
Alexander the Great.

26
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,500
Who was 18,

27
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,520
20 when it was invented?

28
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,210
I think I hit it when the
first time they actually,

29
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:44,090
I think it was 18,

30
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,330
19 years and when the first time they
actually had a 10 mile stretch of of wire

31
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,020
and the guy was able to send
a message and before that,

32
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,651
think about this.

33
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:53,484
Before that,

34
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,050
the the guy,

35
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,850
the guy before 18,

36
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:57,361
whatever,

37
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:57,710
18,

38
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,470
15,

39
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,560
he had to send a message
the same exact way.

40
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,530
Alexander the Great did
either on horseback,

41
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,630
either on foot or either by boat.

42
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,613
Okay.

43
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,980
And when Morse code came up and
Morris was a guy who was a really,

44
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,480
really successful painter,

45
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,563
okay.

46
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,480
And he had nothing to do with
electronic magnetic fields or anything.

47
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,880
He was a really successful painter.

48
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,051
His wife,

49
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,570
he gets what we get to a letter
that his wife is very sick.

50
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:23,280
He loved his wife in Connecticut.

51
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,510
By the time it gets there,

52
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,201
she's not only dead.

53
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,000
She's been buried and he said,

54
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:30,090
this got to be a way I can get
information faster because it killed them.

55
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,110
It was this tragedy.

56
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,951
Seven years later,

57
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:32,784
he's on a boat.

58
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,400
He meets this electromagnetic engineer.

59
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,110
He starts talking to him.

60
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,270
He gets fascinated with the idea that
maybe I can come up with a way to use

61
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,150
electromagnetic fields to send a message.

62
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,220
About 10 years after that,

63
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,670
he invented something called Morse code.

64
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,533
This painter,

65
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,250
because he was so heartbroken over his
wife and and by the end of the world has

66
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,120
never been the same.

67
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,200
That was a bigger communication leap
actually than the Internet because it was

68
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:04,170
the first time we were able to
send instantaneous messages,

69
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:04,800
uh,

70
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,011
and,

71
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:09,510
and I think five years later we finally
had a wire from New York to New Orleans,

72
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,140
which was so much faster and you could
get instantaneous communication in the

73
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:13,980
world was never the same,

74
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,540
and of course we built on that,

75
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,890
but there's the history,

76
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:21,030
so full of individuals that we're
trying to solve a problem that seemed

77
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,560
insurmountable and oftentimes
it was because they basically.

78
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,431
I'm like,

79
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:28,320
Alexander Fleming had a cold.

80
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,380
He,

81
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,760
he,

82
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,360
his snot fell in.

83
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,530
He had all these petri dishes working
on different sports and stuff,

84
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,451
and he,

85
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:37,500
he decided to clean stuff out himself.

86
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,360
He never used to clean
his own petri dishes.

87
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,261
He had a cold,

88
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:45,261
is snot fell into one of the moldy
dishes and he realized that the bacteria

89
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:46,440
under the microscope,

90
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,750
the mold that killed all
the bacteria and he went,

91
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,560
wait a minute.

92
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,140
That's how he invented a little
something called penicillin,

93
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,970
which then became antibiotics,

94
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,110
which is why people are alive.

95
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,123
It's crazy.

96
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,820
So many.

97
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,070
So many of these things either happen
through accident with individuals or

98
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,930
people were trying to solve a problem.

99
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:02,881
Yeah.

100
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:03,560
This is.

101
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,630
That's one of the things about
life is that you need struggle.

102
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,880
It seems like you shouldn't have it,

103
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,743
but you need it.

104
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,450
I'm reading this book by Jon Krakauer
called under the banner of Heaven,

105
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,790
which is about fundamentalist Mormons.

106
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,630
Do you know about this?

107
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,380
No.

108
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,460
Woo.

109
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,770
Holy Shit.

110
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,120
Is that like the Jeffries Guy?

111
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,750
Yeah,

112
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,170
there's A.

113
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,980
I think so.

114
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,611
The jeffries,

115
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:27,450
which was the Jefferies,

116
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,081
Jefferies Guy,

117
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:29,550
was the guy that just got arrested.

118
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,110
He was the polygamists.

119
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,471
Yes,

120
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:31,830
yes,

121
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,663
yes.

122
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,170
So here's the way it works.

123
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,940
There is in this book it talks about,

124
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:36,870
I can't remember the town,

125
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,140
but there is an area that
is run completely by a guy
named Uncle Ruan or was run

126
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:47,970
by this guy named uncle rule on
who is a mormon fundamentalist.

127
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:48,181
This.

128
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:53,181
These are these people are rejected
by the mainstream Mormons because the

129
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:55,230
government came in at one point and said,

130
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:56,460
you guys can't be polygamous.

131
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:57,121
It's illegal.

132
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:59,370
And so they had to renounce polygamy,

133
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,110
and this was something that,

134
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,030
according to this book Joseph Smith said,

135
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:05,220
was the essence of mormonism.

136
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,780
It's still one of the most deepest,

137
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,980
most important parts of mormonism is that
you have multiple or what they call a

138
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,720
plurality of wives.

139
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,411
Plurality.

140
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:14,330
That's good learning.

141
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,150
So,

142
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,781
and here's the thing,

143
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:17,220
this is why you need a bunch of wives.

144
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,800
If you are a fundamentalist Mormon,

145
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,950
you are only supposed to have
sex with your wife when she's,

146
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:23,280
Oh,

147
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,113
oscillating.

148
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,750
Which means if you only have one wife,

149
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,120
you're not only going to
have sex a few times a month,

150
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:30,781
once a month,

151
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:31,081
I don't know,

152
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:32,370
a women late once a month.

153
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,450
If you have 15 wives you
can fuck every night.

154
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,960
So it's very important to have as many
wives as possible because then you could

155
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:42,390
have sex with them all the time
and they're always humping.

156
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,900
And a lot of these guys have so
many children that one of the,

157
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,910
I can't remember which one it was,

158
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:49,050
it might have an uncle ruin.

159
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,260
I can't remember which one had so many
children that they named them according

160
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:55,741
to the year.

161
00:04:55,741 --> 00:04:57,840
So if you're a born in like 1979,

162
00:04:57,841 --> 00:04:59,130
you are your name would have an a,

163
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,490
so it'd be like Annabel Angus Ra and then
you would know what year your kid was

164
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,770
born in by the first letter of his name.

165
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,450
That's how many kids are having.

166
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,560
So then you have girls and your girls
get to be the age of 14 and you've got a

167
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:17,910
pow like vita 14 year old kid and
I was a fundamentalist mormon.

168
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,451
I'd be like,

169
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,284
Joe,

170
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,890
why don't you marry my daughter Laurie?

171
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:27,450
She just started bleeding and then I
would give her to you and you would

172
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:29,130
immediately start fucking her.

173
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,850
And so that's what they're
doing out there is like.

174
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:37,851
It's just like just herds and packs
of pregnant teenagers that have been

175
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:43,611
impregnated by these older dudes who
have so many wives and this shit is.

176
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,320
I think it's still going on today,

177
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:46,621
man.

178
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:51,210
There's whole communities dedicated
to this polygamist lifestyle,

179
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:55,590
which is a lifestyle that Joseph Smith
said was one of the most important

180
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:57,530
aspects of mormonism according to book.

181
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,960
The other thing about Joseph Smith,

182
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,700
do you know what he did before?

183
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,980
He found he founded mormonism,

184
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,120
what he was,

185
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,580
what was called like a treasure seeker,

186
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,880
and so you would use magic stones to
peer through to that would show you where

187
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,350
secret treasure was buried and he.

188
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:19,430
There was a huge lawsuit against him
because he convinced all these people that

189
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,264
he could find.

190
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,440
That was also what he said
about the golden tablets.

191
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,460
That was a seer stone and
see it through a magic rock.

192
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,970
That's how he could read the golden
tablets before he was doing the seer stone

193
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,330
and the Angel Moroni before he's using
the seer stone in Angel Moroni came to

194
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:38,540
him.

195
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,810
He was actually getting
work convincing people like,

196
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:42,291
hey look,

197
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,820
I've got a magic rock and there
and I can find your silver for you.

198
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:49,790
Because there was like a guy who hired
him because he knew that there was some

199
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:54,740
silver hidden up in the hills somewhere
and Joseph Smith went around with boards

200
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,620
through the courts and finally after
like three months of hiring and by the

201
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,420
month they took him to
court and they're like,

202
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:02,541
hey,

203
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,280
this guy can't really
find treasure with that.

204
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,114
Rock

205
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,650
me.

206
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:06,771
Well,

207
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:08,480
he's out there looking every day.

208
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,430
Wouldn't you have loved to seen like a
video of him talking of Joseph Smith,

209
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:18,431
like talking and explaining his strategies
and what he does and what mormonism

210
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:19,370
is all about?

211
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,821
Yeah,

212
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:20,121
man.

213
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,830
I mean I just love.

214
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,080
I just love that idea of like

215
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:25,880
that.

216
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,410
Here's a man who was.

217
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,423
Look,

218
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,323
come on.

219
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,860
Let's just admit it.

220
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,670
Here's a man who's like,

221
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,850
just basically like a classic
con artists come on man class.

222
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:40,520
Really telling people you can
find treasure with a rock.

223
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,050
No one's ever found treasure.

224
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:46,880
That's something like when I was in the
third grade that I would lie about to a

225
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,980
kid in the playground or something,

226
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:51,440
but this guy was making money off of it.

227
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,250
It's just very interesting
to see something grow roots
and flourish in the way

228
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:00,740
that that mormonism has.

229
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,180
Just with a very simple
investigation ended the.

230
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,010
You've got lawsuits.

231
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,200
There's written records against Joseph
Smith because he was taken to court for

232
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,063
lying.

233
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,751
Oh Shit.

234
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:46,150
Itunes or recording to server.

235
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,260
Get the fuck Outta here.

236
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:47,830
Server.
