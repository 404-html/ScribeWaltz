1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,620
Ladies and gentlemen.
That's right. We're back.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,230
This episode is brought to
you by the dollar shave club.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,850
Dollar Shave Club has the
funniest ads that they send
you. What's this? They have?

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,640
Why are razors so damn expensive?

5
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:22,641
Damn Spelled d a m and that is highlighted
and then above it it says note to

6
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:26,190
host priests.
Personalize highlighted areas.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,090
I wouldn't say damn.
Why are reasons?

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,420
I would say fucking most
people would write why?

9
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:36,480
Why are these razors so fucking expensive?
But they have a good point. It's,

10
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:39,720
this is a great fucking idea.
This guy's a wizard. He really,

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,500
he cracked the code to smart move.
Razors are really expensive.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,370
If he could sell you raisers
that are just ridiculously cheap,

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,780
why wouldn't you do it and just have
them delivered to you and tell me their

14
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:52,740
good qualities too and you can,

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,330
you can go for a dollar a month or even
know that the $6 or a $9 the executive,

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,800
guess what folks are Grandpa's all got
by on that dollar a month type razor.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,250
They were fine.
They didn't need five fucking blades.

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,900
They need vibrating handles that you
stick up your ass. Why is it needed?

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,700
Why is this one called
the lover's blade though?

20
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:14,760
I don't cause he vibrate the
handle. You stick it up. I Dunno.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,650
Lovers like it really smooth. I Dunno.
That's going to get you in trouble.

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,420
You're going to have to keep that up.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,150
It's like when you show up at a chick's
house with a dozen roses in the first

24
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,270
day, you got to maintain that
Sun. All right? If you, uh,

25
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,840
if you have the lover's blade and you're
all super smooth with like 15 blades

26
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:35,070
and shit, that's the $6 a month with me.
But even that, think about that folks.

27
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,450
$6 a fucking month.

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,310
That's like if you use the same razor for
a whole month and you shave every day,

29
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,500
you're a fucking pig. All right?
You're a disgusting person.

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,510
He probably spreading diseases.
So this is the way to do it.

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,060
Every month you get a
new one if you use one.

32
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,150
I know dudes that use the same razor
for like four months at a time.

33
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,830
This.

34
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,850
This one says that you will love this
razor and your girlfriend can use it too.

35
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:01,650
That's the worst when
it girl uses a razor,

36
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,700
has that cold water in it and
it's got that little goal harder.

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,460
It's got the cares.
If cold water comes from Deb Pontes,

38
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,080
I use the same razor a for years. I use
an electric razor. I use it once a week.

39
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:16,770
I have a ritual right before I have to
go like to the UFC. If I gotta go work.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,880
Most of the time I hit it on Wednesday
or Thursday and I just banging out

41
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:23,900
Wednesday and Thursday every week.
Just give it a quick wham, wham.

42
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,920
Ran through the head at the same time.

43
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,790
I do the head sometimes to do the body
hair. Occasionally I trimmed approves.

44
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,520
You have the right kind of hair for that
cause my hair does not work on electric

45
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,600
razors. It just doesn't get close. Yeah,

46
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,210
you got to have a rugged face on for
everybody else. Dollar Shave club.com

47
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,070
this is the way to go though for real.
If you are,

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,440
if you're thinking about like
saving money, like how can I,

49
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,890
if you're looking at all
your bills and you go on,

50
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,650
there's gotta be some waste in here
for sure. Your razors are a waste.

51
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:57,510
If you could walk it down to a buck a
month. Also they have manly but wipes.

52
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,180
Wow.
Dr Carver's.

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,480
Easy shave butter n one wipe Charlies
one one Charlie's in the manly,

54
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:09,190
but wipes are a way more hygienic for
your booty hole. Mr Hotel, they were the,

55
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,010
they were the hardest to kill a nom.
The one wipe Charlies

56
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,040
fire and forget one wipe
Charlies gentleman used wipes.

57
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,920
The problem is gentleman
don't have persons to carry
these fucking wipes around.

58
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,850
What they need to do is have like a ma,

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,490
like a single use size one wipe Charlie
that comes in like a business card

60
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:32,050
holder type size. It's a good idea. Yeah.
You Peel that bitch open wipe first.

61
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:36,070
You know if you have to take a road shit.
Yeah.

62
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,270
That the businessman,

63
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,750
this is a time is a time and every man's
life we have to shit in a restaurant.

64
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,710
I don't want to do this, but I
got to do this. I gotta do this.

65
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,850
And you head in there unload and if you
had a little one wipe Charlie in your

66
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:48,370
pocket,

67
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,000
of course you can make your own single
use with a small Ziploc bag that you use

68
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:54,880
for sandwiches or drugs. Actually,
I have a, I have a thing,

69
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,150
a little small travel size one in my
car I use for it before I go to massage

70
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:03,010
parlors if I don't consider
it Brian, that's, you know,

71
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:06,700
a lot of people say that. That's the
whole thing about prostitution is that uh,

72
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,990
you know, men want to abuse women
but you don't, you're so considerate.

73
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:15,580
Even the smell, anything. You hit your
one one. Yeah, they don't need to know.

74
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,650
They didn't even know nothing.
Uh, one, one wipe Charlies as is,

75
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:24,400
uh, everything else
available@dollarshaveclub.com.

76
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,970

shave club.com Rogan,

77
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,320
you can get the party started, shaved time
and shave money. That's, that's awesome.

78
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,860
They sat that there are so wacky.
Have you seen the commercial?

79
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,740
The actual guy who was the president
does a commercial. It's funny.

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,120
They're fucking funny. They're over the
top. I mean, so they send you razors.

81
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:47,140
Is that, that's great for a
buck. That's great. Boom. Done.

82
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,770
Because that's always the one thing
you're like, ah, do I have a rate?

83
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,990
And then they're coming in the mail
that says, if you're a four blade guy,

84
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,010
let's say you, uh, you get
six bucks for a four pack.

85
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,260
So one a week for a month. Wow. $6 to
dollar one. Now the one for a buck,

86
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,790
it says this, Razer does not front.
What does that even mean? Urban?

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,160
It's a good question.
What are they trying to do?

88
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,310
No front and step on the fat.
Yeah.

89
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:16,690
I wrote a don't sleep on a tweet and
people were debating when I was trying to,

90
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,390
if I meant I meant the rapper way, don't
sleep on that shit. Don't sleep, son.

91
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,330
That's what I meant. I didn't mean like
don't go to sleep. I sleep all the time.

92
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:29,260
You should sleep. Sleep
is important. Anyway,

93
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,490
don't front on that razor.

94
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,560
Is that raising for a bag that humble
twin don't front the humble twin son and

95
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:38,500
you get that shit for a buck a month.
I mean my I,

96
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,410
our parents had those screw
down one razor of death. Yes.

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,670
Well those are the ones people
used to use to commit suicide.

98
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,540
This is not good rate. That's
the green mile razor. Oh whoa.

99
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,190
You ever watch those like lockdown shows?

100
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,950
I think once a week they get to
shave and it's like this big, like,

101
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:57,980
it's like almost

102
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,000
like a, a Japanese tea ceremony.
The guy like, you know, you know,

103
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,450
whatever cuff up and they put his hands
out, they put the lotion, you know,

104
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,540
and then they give them like this
lady bic or something, you know,

105
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,010
it's like totally a,
you know,

106
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,190
generic razor and then he's the next
thing and the place is just, you know,

107
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,290
that's all I'm with feces,

108
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,920
live life broke down to that.
Your big thrill every week. Wow.

109
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,470
If you lived in the Roman times,
like having a hot shower,

110
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,440
you would have to be God
to have a hot shower. Yet.

111
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,790
When everybody gets in a motel six he
just turn on that Faucet and stand there

112
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:37,360
and just lather up. That feels
tremendous. When you've had a tired day.

113
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,700
It's amazing. Exactly. Yeah. We take it
for granted. They had nothing. No shaving,

114
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,810
not thing.

115
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,560
I think they were pluckers actually. I
think they, they like the gladiator guys.

116
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:52,130
They would just tweet him over. They
would tweeze or something. Spartacus.

117
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:52,760
I forget.

118
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,210
I'm not surprised. Yeah, I think that's
what I would do if I was living back then.

119
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,370
I would tweet a fuck the commercials.

120
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,650
Commercials over a dollar Shave club.com
I don't even have to do right now.

121
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:06,170
Sorry. I'm just say you have a Gig to
promote. I tell comic con beautiful.

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,890
This us Friday night am at the
Lobero theater with Joey Diaz,

123
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,370
but I think it's sold out. Holla,
dollar shave club.com Dave.

124
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,030
Mother fucking what's up man.
Thanks for having me.

125
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,280
Thanks for being here,
man. I'm pleading. Love it.

126
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,110
You know. Can I say it like this is the
third location that we've done. This box.

127
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,390
We're sneaky dog. It's goal moving. I'm
moving again. You're running around man,

128
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:30,720
man, lock you down. Well,
what I'm also doing is, um,

129
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,160
I'm slowly building a man cave and the
next one's going to have an archery range.

130
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,520
This one has a pool table, but I've
decided that I need like a full warehouse.

131
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,940
An archery. Yeah. Way to go. And
I'm going to do a Corolla style.

132
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,170
Like Adam Carolla has a, a,
a soundproof podcast studio.

133
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,370
He's amazing. Like he's, he's a carpenter,
you know, like a real, yeah, he is.

134
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,300
He's like a master carpenter and really
knows his shit. So he builds everything.

135
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,690
He built his own record desk that
he communicates out of there.

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,390
He built like the walls where he has
like this plexiglass thing that separates

137
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:07,740
them from the producers. It's like
really fucking high tech Shit. But

138
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,380
I was there last week, I was there a
couple of days ago, something like that.

139
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:12,120
And you're absolutely right.
It's like a building.

140
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,260
I've never seen anything like that

141
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,160
inside the building. He built this
like, you know, I could contain thing.

142
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,760
He's a bad motherfucker.
That guy I think constantly going to,

143
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,280
he's a renaissance man. Yeah. I mean he's,

144
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,270
he's got so many like things that
he's really knowledgeable about. Cars,

145
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,520
talked to that guy about cars.
He does a car, podcast, cars, uh,

146
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,640
wood crafting, boxing, boxing
a lot about boxing. Man.

147
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,590
He's a really good boxer. Like I
saw him teaching guy like a MMA guy,

148
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,880
I believe it was Uriah Faber.

149
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,300
I'm pretty sure he was holding the myths
forum and really I'm a instruction.

150
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:49,240
Yeah, he's a fucking really good
boxer. He really knows his shit.

151
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,030
Well rounded dude.
Very weird dude that Adam Carolla.

152
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,010
I can't think of another Adam Corolla.
You know what I'm saying? Like

153
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,420
I can't think of another day.
We'll tell either.

154
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,370
But you're right here and I don't want
to make you uncomfortable and when you

155
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,920
start talking about you, I like that.
I've got some big shoes to fill,

156
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,840
which Adam probably could make shoes.

157
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,110
He makes his own shoes
following Adam's credit.

158
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,640
He probably kills his own cows or some
up on the barn. You like this belt?

159
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,560
I did it myself. Leather
tans the high. Yeah.

160
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:20,730
He's very fucking knowledgeable about
houses and he's got that show now on spike

161
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:25,170
where they bust people who are bad
contractors. Oh, cool. Catch a contractor.

162
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:25,790
Have you seen it?

163
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,060
That's, that's doing God's work because
that is a, that's a hard deal man.

164
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:30,800
I've know that myself.
Like you've got a guy in,

165
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,690
yeah, he's a bad
motherfucker. He was on, um,

166
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,710
what does that show a guest?
It was love line.

167
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,770
And he had a ty Pennington guy who builds
those houses and he started out like

168
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:45,630
quizzing him about questions
about like how to build houses.

169
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:47,970
But the guys like a TV show host,

170
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,580
he probably knows a little bit
about houses cause he's around them.

171
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,940
But he didn't get the Gig
because he's like a contractor.

172
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,380
So Corollas starts throwing all
these questions. I didn't know shit.

173
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,750
He uh, well just the name
alone. Ty Pennington, you know,

174
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,150
this guy doesn't know his way around
dry wall or anything like that.

175
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:05,080
That's the look too fancy.

176
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,430
I would say he'd either be an awesome
baseball player or maybe a figure skater.

177
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,550
Yeah. Or Butler in between the
ty Pennington, you'd be a butler.

178
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,350
I think you've got a Butler service tie.
If you,

179
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,640
whenever someone's party and they had
a butler, would you just turn around

180
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,440
it really, it really would
depend what kind of Butler it is.

181
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:24,710
If it's the old English type, I'd love
it. But if it's like this new kind of like

182
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,810
kid hanging out. Yeah. My name's
butler. I wouldn't like it.

183
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,320
That could be a new gig.
Great personalities at walk
you around at their party.

184
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,350
Temporary Butler Kig you know,

185
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,830
I think, uh, you know, the cool thing
about a out here, you know, I'm,

186
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:44,890
I'm east coast is that like
when you come out here,

187
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,190
everybody has somebody helping
them do something and you,

188
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,920
and you really do need it because of
all the driving and stuff like that.

189
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,480
And like a, you know, I was in my
hotel and like my door wasn't working,

190
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,500
so the guy came down to help me
out and then he's like, oh man,

191
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:02,710
I don't know how to do doors. So he
had to get the other guy. So I'm like,

192
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,670
even he has like a little assistant,
you know? I really, I really, you know,

193
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,650
I don't know.
I'm always mystified when I come out here.

194
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,370
The amount of jobs there are, there's
like jobs in la that aren't anywhere else,

195
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:12,850
you know?

196
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, there's another numbers
of humans here is insane. Yes.

197
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,270
Like la is not the biggest city per se,

198
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,540
but it's the bay area because
there's not really one city.

199
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,390
It's like you never get away.
You keep going.

200
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:28,540
It goes deeper and deeper and deeper
as far as like traffic and population.

201
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,910
Do you know how like if you're living,
if you're in New York,

202
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,820
once you get outside of New York
and then you hit Connecticut,

203
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:37,370
like things lighten up could
substantially, exactly. You know the, the,

204
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:40,390
the amount of people that you
see lightens up. It spreads out.

205
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,030
Cities are less populated.
That's not the case with La.

206
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,923
Not at all.

207
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,190
I know that I'm kind of out of La
when I see a party store center,

208
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,130
like a party store center and no
one's there. Then I know I'm like,

209
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,810
I must be heading to Sacramento or

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm in the math area of California.
I don't know what it is. Yeah.

211
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,660
Dollar store. Yeah. One of
those weird, you know, whatever.

212
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,980
Weird cell phone company
that no one understands how
they're selling cell phones,

213
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,990
cell phone repo shop
or something like that.

214
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,290
They have those weird little ones
at those strip malls. We like,

215
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,980
what are they doing? They're all selling
cell phones. All like cool calling cards.

216
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:19,480
Like, yeah. It's like you can talk
to Nairobi and that's it. You know,

217
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:24,250
there's no other place where this
phone works. Those um, those,

218
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:28,150
those little stalls that they have at
the mall or another one too. It's like,

219
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,960
you know, you could buy a phone right
here. You just going to set it up here.

220
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,590
Like we're out in the middle
of everything. I know.
How can you fucking do,

221
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:38,980
you don't even have an office. He's going
to turn my phone on here. This is crazy.

222
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,260
I love the kiosk people because you know,
I'm like,

223
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,620
I'm kind of rushing and looking and I
always feel like that's my next gig.

224
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,420
We're going to kiosk, you know, flying
up flying remote control helicopter.

225
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:52,660
No one needs. That would actually
be a good show you think? Yeah.

226
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,690
If you had a camera on you just set up
a camera and leave it there and you a

227
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,610
cell cell phone covers those
glittery cell phone covers. Yeah,

228
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,260
you need one of those but everybody goes,

229
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,150
did David Tell you David towl like
Yap there's my new show made some,

230
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:08,960
we made some bad choices. Here
I am. Do you want one or not?

231
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:15,270
I really think that a really funny guy
like yourself would be enjoyable if that

232
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,700
was the only show you would find the
funny in it just by talking to different

233
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:20,530
people.
He did it a few hours a day.

234
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,300
I guarantee you would get more funny out
of that than your average Sitcom if you

235
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:28,810
filmed four days of just a few
hours a day. A kiosk. Yeah.

236
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:31,480
It would be hilarious by like day three,

237
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:34,810
you would have an act you had
already know like how to, you know,

238
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,110
things that you could say to people that
were hilarious on camera. But you know,

239
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,590
here's the rub because I'm older now
and like I have to go to the bathroom

240
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:45,400
pretty much like every 35 minutes.
So who would watch my kiosk?

241
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,090
Well you get one of those things that
dude's use when they race car drive.

242
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,350
Oh it's like a condom catheter.
You're wrapped.

243
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,690
I'd like a diaper or something. Okay.
Oh it's like it's a condom. It goes,

244
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,640
it goes over,
he goes into a bag and you uh,

245
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:04,420
you can keep the bag like strapped
to your side like a pistol.

246
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,300
You can hold onto it like a briefcase
or a bowling ball bag or just get a

247
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:13,480
courtesy bucket or then people
are going to smell piss.

248
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,590
What about a good neighbor?

249
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,260
Maybe the guy at the kiosks
down and help me out his mouth.

250
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,880
Hey Lady who's selling a moisturizer?
No one needs, can you watch my kiosk?

251
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:23,530
Don't worry.
There's no business for either one of us.

252
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,260
You could definitely do that because
it would be a television show.

253
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,760
So because it's television show,

254
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:31,930
you could actually get people that were
like customers to watch the kiosk for

255
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:32,764
you.
Oh,

256
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,290
you should totally do it and put a camera
on him and see if they steal money. Oh,

257
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,650
that's cool. Yeah, that'd be good.
Yeah. I just tell you, this is the code.

258
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,010
If anybody buys anything, you know,
just, you know how to count, right?

259
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,290
God gives you 20 giving back $4 and 64
cents. Right? You don't want to do that.

260
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,660
You know what's cool? Because some
of those chaos, they really do like,

261
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:52,040
they have like these, you know,
uh, they're selling things

262
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,520
now that are really, I guess you could
say like old school sorcery, you know,

263
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,190
like just magic. And they'll
be like, look at this,

264
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,740
look at this glitter thing right now.
We're going to make it look like, uh,

265
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,150
you know, do you miss
your dead grandma? Okay,

266
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:08,840
now we can put that on a shirt and have
her talk. I'm like, wow, this is great.

267
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,880
Where's Houdini to debunk this?

268
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,940
Yeah. They've got going to have
shirts that talked to you. Right.

269
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,930
I'm telling you they did a new thing.
It's the new merge. It's a new,

270
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:20,950
a level of merge where you like run your
hand across your chest and to go step

271
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,540
pitch. Yeah. It's for the,

272
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:26,830
it's for the dubstep kids that would
just keep your mouth shut and you, your,

273
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,730
your shirt talks, you know, or if
it was Red Fox on your shirt, oh,

274
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,590
that would be the best.
You big dummy

275
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,930
kids today. They don't know shit
about Redd Foxx do that day.

276
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,440
They don't. They really don't. That was
one of my favorite albums. Red Fox. Uh,

277
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:47,910
the uh, hello dummy for, uh,
uh, Don Rickles, which is
all crowd work by the way.

278
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,340
It was like groundbreaking
with all that crowd work.

279
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,740
So when you're a little kid mind,
you have to imagine a crowd.

280
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,610
Wow. Yeah. I only heard
when I was a little kid,

281
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,740
the comedy albums I heard for the longest
time were all just like Cheech and

282
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:05,580
Chong type stuff. Really. I heard
Cheech and Chong and bill Cosby,

283
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:08,820
but I can't remember if bill Cosby, he
must have done it with an audience, right?

284
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,900
Oh yeah, yeah, no, he
was, he was rock hard man.

285
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:13,420
He was already doing like those big
theater shows and stuff like that.

286
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,810
I mean maybe there's like once from the
60s, the early sixties where it was like,

287
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,660
you know, like he's really
super polite now cause you know,

288
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:22,540
like he had to come in through the
kitchen, you know, back segregation style,

289
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,180
you know, like one of those kinds
of things. But other than that,

290
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,210
I remember his stuff and it was
always like a big event, you know?

291
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,753
Yeah.
He,

292
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,360
he's a guy who probably doesn't get
enough credit like as a standup comic.

293
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,500
Yeah. You know, he's a story teller comic
and I think that's, that's kind of cool.

294
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,870
But I always liked what you said,
like a red flag. I liked the guys.

295
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:43,130
Those were like cold party tapes or
party albums and like, you know, uh,

296
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,920
if you will listen to that,
that meant that you were
cool. Like, wow, man, this is,

297
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,050
this is jazz.

298
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,470
Yeah.
Red Fox was like jazz comedy.

299
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,630
Did you ever hear any of the
Red Fox comedy club tapes?
No, I've never heard that.

300
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,441
Oh Dude.

301
00:16:56,441 --> 00:17:00,940
Red Fox at one point in time had a comedy
club apparently where and I don't know

302
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,630
like it's gotta be one of those
like cool, like Topeka, Kansas.

303
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,490
No, I think it was probably
like Peoria, Illinois and um,

304
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,320
I we should find out, find out
where Red Fox is coming close. Uh,

305
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:15,950
but he had Richard Pryor on stage all
the time and they would record them and

306
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,550
you'd buy m and cassettes and I,
I've not seen them online.

307
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:21,800
I used to own them over really
sad at one point in time,

308
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,520
but they were these great old
sets where prior was just,

309
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,630
it was a small crowd and prior was just
fucking around like he'd be making shit

310
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,700
up. Like as he was going along. You can
totally tell he was making shit. Yeah.

311
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,790
Was he famous then or was it like,
I think he was like famous,

312
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,170
like maybe like us famous,
like not real famous.

313
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,870
Not like Richard Pryor Fam.
Exactly.

314
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,820
He was on his way to become
an Richard Pryor famous wow.

315
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,430
And he would fuck around
in these, these, uh,

316
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,600
small clubs like Red Fox club. And
it was just, ah, man, as a comic,

317
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:57,780
I remember I was an open miker and I
would drive to gigs and listen to them.

318
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,850
Oh Man,
I'm jealous for that.

319
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,350
I'm ready now. Flip Wilson's book, you
know, flip was another guy who like,

320
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,540
he asked anybody under 40, they'll
be like, whoa, who's that? Yeah,

321
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,680
I remember he, he, uh, you know, I'm,
I'm, I'm not through the whole book yet,

322
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:15,570
but him and Red Fox had this kind of like,
love,

323
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:19,770
hate relationship because Redd Foxx was
like hardcore and flip Wilson was like,

324
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,080
you know, the up and coming guy. And, uh,

325
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,550
supposedly like red was really kind
of like tough love and on a flip.

326
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,220
And then a flip was like, you
know, he'd borrow money from me.

327
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,010
He wouldn't even recognize me. Like,
you know, you walk in the club and like,

328
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:36,270
he wouldn't even say hello
or anything like that. And
then he got a call, uh, from,

329
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,280
um, flip, uh, no. Uh, Red Fox
was on Carson and he said,

330
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,500
who is the funniest guy in the
country? Johnny asked him, he goes,

331
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:46,620
Flip Wilson and the next day he got a
call to be on the show and that kind of

332
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:49,410
started his whole career. So He owes his
whole career to Red Fox. Isn't that cool?

333
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,700
That's amazing.
That is cool.

334
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,830
That's very cool. He's fucking show
was funny man. Flip Wilson show. Oh,

335
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:58,770
red's. Yeah. Okay. But Flip
Wilson was funny too, man.

336
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,510
I remember Flip Wilson
from back in the day.

337
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,140
Yeah. You know, like when you read
the book and you read like what he,

338
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,390
what he went through and all that
kind of stuff. It was like, you know,

339
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,430
that the trials and
tribulations of like the early,

340
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:10,910
early road plus the segregation and all
that stuff. I mean like it, it really,

341
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:13,340
it really is kind of a
really interesting story.

342
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:16,310
Almost like a hobbit journey adventure,
you know,

343
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:17,660
have ups and downs and stuff like that.

344
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:21,500
But a Red Fox is definitely the guy
he was, he was hardcore, you know,

345
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:22,520
and you got to love hardcore

346
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,820
what are unique American perspective to
be a black man who grew up in that era

347
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,090
and then became a huge celebrity.
Yeah.

348
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,260
Like what a shift of things that must've
been for him and how strange it must

349
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:37,700
have been to go through.

350
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,610
Like when you're talking about Cosby
having to go through the kitchen.

351
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,980
That really rang a bell with me.
I'm, I'm thinking about that.

352
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,990
I wasn't saying it to be anything. I
mean I'm like, they really had to like,

353
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,310
you know, and this stuff, the stuff that
they like, you know, like traveling,

354
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,740
you know, like think about
it back then. Segregation.

355
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,600
Like they couldn't wait in
the train station, you know,

356
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,680
they had to like catch it on the way out
or something. You know, it's really late.

357
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,470
You know,

358
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,940
it's incredible that it was in our
lifetime. Oh absolutely. Yeah. It's not,

359
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,960
it's just hard to wrap your head around
the idea that people were capable of

360
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,120
judging people just by the color
of their skin just a few years ago.

361
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,550
And really today too.
There's plenty of people that do it today.

362
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:18,980
They just can't do it as openly as,
you know,

363
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,690
whites only faucets and shit like that.
While this sterling thing, I mean,

364
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:26,360
everybody's talking about what do you
think about this? There's an old dude,

365
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:28,880
man [inaudible] or old racist man.

366
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,110
There's a lot of old guys that grew
up in that era. You know what I mean?

367
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:35,450
Think about if you're 82 years old.

368
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,860
That's how that guy is been
around. Absolutely. You know,

369
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:43,550
so 40 years ago,
40 years ago,

370
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:48,070
we're talking about the 1970s, you
know, the sixties before that when he

371
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,030
was like our age. Yeah. That
guy who's, he's old as fuck man.

372
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,900
Well I hope it doesn't make everybody
think that all 82 year old Jewish, uh,

373
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,640
cause it's called Jelly and managers of
NBA teams with a super hot 22 year old

374
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:01,474
girlfriend,
our race.

375
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,450
You know, the dude
obviously got set up. Yeah.

376
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:10,160
But isn't it weird that like what if we
find that more people think like that?

377
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,790
Like what if, what if were were
persecuting this guy now, right.

378
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,710
Because he said it. Yeah, but what if
we find out like sometime in the future,

379
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,640
you know,

380
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,450
just have a guy sit down and stare into
a screen for a couple of seconds and

381
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:26,540
they read your eyeballs and go,
oh, you fucking hate black people.

382
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,430
And like you turns out that like this
shit has been in your head the whole time.

383
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,620
People have been saying
things the whole time he,

384
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,680
it starts like reading your memory of all
the different times of the past we had

385
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:38,810
called someone a nigger,
you're like, ah shit.

386
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,830
And it just starts pulling it out
of your brain and like, hey man,

387
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:45,080
you did everything you
persecuted that guy for.

388
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:48,290
I think there's a lot of people doing
that and there's a lot of people that are

389
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:51,620
jumping up to blame the guy. Yeah,
he's definitely a racist. Yeah.

390
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:55,370
He definitely shouldn't be working
with the NBA, but he's an old dude.

391
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:56,870
It's more sad than anything.

392
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,820
Well that's funny how you
bring it up. Like, you know,
like how racist is somebody?

393
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:02,670
Like I think if you watch
the winter Olympics,

394
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:05,280
you're a racist because that is the
whitest thing. You know what I'm saying?

395
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,310
All that ice skating and ski and
that's all white. It's just whiteness.

396
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:11,850
That's a very good point.
Yeah. So it's like if you know
a Sochi and the, I'm like,

397
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,410
there you go.

398
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:13,681
Yeah.

399
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:17,340
This is probably racist that move far
north just to get away from black people.

400
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,290
Like they know they're going
to be around white people.

401
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:22,500
Only white people are crazy enough to
want to ski all the time. White flight.

402
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,730
At first I was thinking, now what if
he has like early signs of autism?

403
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,670
The other one. Yeah. Where are you can't
now I care. Really think of Amnesia. Uh,

404
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,250
Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's. Yeah.

405
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,330
Cause I know when my great grandmother
had Alzheimer's, she was racist as fuck.

406
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:38,850
And she thought I was her, her
husband, and like it was just,

407
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,290
and she sounded normal. She's
like, oh, you're Brian. Oh,
come here, baby. Getting,

408
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,990
you know, like, well that's a good point
really, because anyone who gets older,

409
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,440
that old you brains compromised.
There's just no doubt about it.

410
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,940
It's a sad thing to witness. You know,
they get dementia, they get real wacky.

411
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,520
It's a sad thing to witness but
it's inevitable it seems like,

412
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,060
and it doesn't seem,
they've never figured out anything to uh,

413
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,660
to slow it down either. Once that shit
starts it's like, you know, it's gonna,

414
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,350
it's gonna keep going bad. It's even
scarier also to think that what that,

415
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:08,870
how horrible that woman was in it.

416
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:11,640
Like she just made me mad cause you
could tell how much she was fishing that

417
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:15,090
poor guy, you know. But how
many girls do that like record,

418
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:17,340
like get to an end of a relationship.
Like you know what,

419
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:20,910
I'm going to ruin this guy by recording
them and posting their text messages.

420
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,620
He's a multibillionaire who says a lot
of racist shit and she's half black,

421
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,140
you know? I mean, how do you think that
feels to her? She was being half white,

422
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,930
half black.
I think she's half Mexican too.

423
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,980
Oh really beautiful girl.
Wow. She is. She um, you know,

424
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,120
she probably felt like,

425
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:42,990
fuck this old racist asshole that I've
been blowing for the past couple of years.

426
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,310
Really. I mean like how old is she?
She's her twenties. Right. I don't know,

427
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:50,090
but it's portrayed in a black cock
need to get together with her. Well,

428
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,080
it's already happened.

429
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,560
That was one of the things that I thought
was hilarious about the recording was

430
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:57,480
that the dude said, I don't care
if you're fucked them. Yeah.

431
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,910
Well he wants a watch. Maybe now
might be all cut. Coldy yeah.

432
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:04,730
There's dudes that are purposely
targeting her, their addiction,

433
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:08,720
like guided missiles, giant
athletes. Well, I don't know.

434
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:12,960
She should have thought it out also
because I'm sure they broke up right.

435
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,160
Was just going to find another 82 year
old billionaire Jewish owner of a NBA

436
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:22,820
team. I mean, if that's her style,
her, her, her guy, you know,

437
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,490
it's really hilarious that
prostitution is illegal.

438
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,210
It really is hilarious because
of prostitution wasn't illegal.

439
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,170
None of this would be a problem.
That guy look their relationship mean.

440
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,120
Who knows what it was
at one point in time.

441
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,900
But it's safe to say that when it
boils down to a chick recording you and

442
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:43,220
baiting you to talk bad about black
people, that fuck of relationship is like,

443
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,180
she doesn't really like you anymore,
you know, obviously right. She, in fact,

444
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:49,760
she's trying to get,
get back. Come on man.

445
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,000
So she targeted him for money and yeah,
for sure.

446
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,720
But the crazy thing is that like his
wife was trying to get the money back now

447
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,830
saying that she embezzled it. Look,
that's it. That's how it goes.

448
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,130
If you're an old wrinkly dude
and you want to bang a hot chick,

449
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:05,400
you've got to give her something.
Yeah.

450
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,870
But if you have grandchildren older than
your girlfriend because he has to have

451
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:12,410
grandchildren that are older than
her, probably does. But that's weird.

452
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,000
But what do we care?
You know,

453
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:17,840
I don't know if she wants to fuck
him and he promises her a condo.

454
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,170
I don't give a fuck. I think it's
an important point though, to, uh,

455
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,300
to get the guy out of the MBA.
I think that's an important point.

456
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:29,680
I think it's awesome that they did that.
They banned him for real quick.

457
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,280
Gets the fuck that guy,
man.

458
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:35,690
Fuck that feeling that someone around
you who owns the team feels like that

459
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:39,960
about black people's. God
Damn. How does he get, Oh,

460
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,740
she's beautiful. That's ridiculous.
That's how it works, man.

461
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,460
If you want to get one of those, you
got to pay. He doesn't look 82 to me.

462
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,490
He looks somebody for, yeah, he was good.

463
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,230
He looks about as bad as you can look.
It's still be alive.

464
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,320
But remember he's a billionaire
so that that's like, that's money.

465
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,630
You know what I'm saying? That's that
kind of money. I'm like, you know,

466
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,530
I guess I'll have to buy an island and be
a king. I mean, what is it going to do?

467
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,680
You know when it he did
he, he fucked up. Okay.

468
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:11,390
Because he in some ways didn't
recognize the relationship,

469
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,370
didn't recognize what was going on there.

470
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,500
In some ways he must been like roped
into the romance of it all. Sure.

471
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,000
What he should have done is he's got
so much fucking money and let's be

472
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:27,650
realistic. Not much fucking time.
How much time does that guy have?

473
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,330
Powerful rich guys.

474
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,700
For some reason that gives you like
another seven years or something.

475
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:35,090
It's like a reverse of smoking
and that was just like evil power.

476
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:38,480
It gives you another seven years.
I don't think that he's using it.

477
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,490
He can't be $1 billion.

478
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:44,250
It's like a person who's
30 would have a really hard

479
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,240
time spending $1 billion when you have
to be a real fucking asshole to go

480
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:50,580
through $1 billion.
I think this cat,

481
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,610
if he just was a little bit
more generous with his money,

482
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,870
recognize the situation and said,
listen, you know I've got $1 billion.

483
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:00,780
That's a thousand million.
How am I throw a couple million your way?

484
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,450
He should've thrown a gold bar.
Her head.

485
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,930
That's massage.
Be the massage.

486
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:15,390
Both. They're wearing crowns like real
crowns, not like chuck cheese crowns.

487
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,360
Real crowded.

488
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,580
I couldn't hear you.
I'm wearing a gold crown.

489
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,910
He sits around the house in a bathrobe.
Rodney Dangerfield style.

490
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:24,744
His Dick hanging out.

491
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:29,580
Yeah, that was the bet. Rodney.
God bless them. You know? Ah God,

492
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:34,410
the La. The last few years of
Rodney. Rodney was great man. He,

493
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:36,360
he, you know, you got to say one thing,

494
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:39,630
like there's some guys who get famous
and can't handle it. He handled it,

495
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,700
he loved it.
He loved it.

496
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,530
You know why he was already an older man
came famous and he had worked like he'd

497
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,240
given up on show business for a long time.
Went back to work.

498
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,673
Oh right.
Yeah.

499
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,920
Yo, he was like an aluminum
side or something like that.

500
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,130
Someone was on the show was talked about.
God, I wish I could remember who it was.

501
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,970
They might've been Fitzsimmons I'll find
out a, he'll be here on Thursday. Um,

502
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,020
but Rodney went back and kept writing so
when he went back to calm me after all

503
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:06,661
those years off,

504
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:10,980
he had like notebook upon notebook upon
notebook filled with jokes. Yeah, he,

505
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,860
it was, it was Hinchcliffe. That's
who it was. It was Tony Hinchcliffe.

506
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,210
Oh, okay. Cause Yeah, told me Tony
actually is a great joke writer.

507
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,410
He's fucking hilarious.

508
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,440
He was with me and Bray this
weekend and you're rocking it out

509
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,140
with me all the time. He calls it on
the role. That's excellent. See, that's,

510
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,130
that's what I like about you
man. It's like, you know,

511
00:28:28,131 --> 00:28:29,970
like I'm doing this company
underground show. I didn't,

512
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,130
I don't want it to sell wrong or anything,

513
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:35,480
but like it's about like getting
the new guys don't really fit yet.

514
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,970
Like anywhere. Like, you know,
they're, they're like new,

515
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,850
getting them out there and letting
them do like a raw, uncensored set.

516
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:42,710
That's really important. You've
been doing that for years. So dude,

517
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,000
excellent tip your hat.

518
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,340
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Well, you know what I would,

519
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,360
when I did was when I first
started coming up and doing comedy,

520
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,180
I had a really hard
time getting gigs right?

521
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,740
Because I was dirty and it had
a lot of people tell me like,

522
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:58,510
did I had to clean my act up or clean
my act up now? And then, you know,

523
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,530
once you make it,
then you can do whatever you want,

524
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,560
but until you're a headliner and people
come to see you, you can't do that.

525
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,490
And I never understood then I get
it now from their point of view.

526
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,520
So it makes it really hard for
these guys to work. You know,

527
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:15,170
like a guy like Diaz or garlic already.
Nobody wanted Da's to open for them.

528
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,770
No one. But uh, for me
I thought like this guy,

529
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,020
I mean I think, how does a guy like that
get an outlet in less? It's the Internet.

530
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,620
I mean how you can't put that guy on
regular shows. He doesn't come through.

531
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,930
But she would, he's
really does. Absolutely.

532
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,500
And Joey's a hitter. He is, he's
a, he's a headliner. Both names.

533
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:35,900
He just said Ari and Joey,
they're both headliners.

534
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,000
So to bring them out on the road,
it's,

535
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:41,000
it's great because you're like
opening up to a whole new audience.

536
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,130
You know what I'm saying?
Like,

537
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,370
cause I know my own needs,
it's very cool with like rough comedy,

538
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:48,610
but they also like really good comedy and,
and they can take a joke.

539
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:50,350
They're not like groaners really,
you know?

540
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,350
So when I bring out the guys and they
do their rough stuff, they like it,

541
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,960
they want to hear it and they know
that it's David tell approved exactly.

542
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,230
Kind of what Rodney,

543
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:03,700
did you know when Rodney did those Hbo
Young Comedian Specials? Absolutely.

544
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,260
It's really the same thing.
You know,

545
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,800
those things stick in my head more than
almost any other specialists like seeing

546
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:10,900
like the bill Hicks and the dice man.

547
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,720
Like just seeing them do their
thing in those short doses.

548
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:17,650
Cause you think about it now it's like
you used to like a long redux of both of

549
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,780
them but let's see and um,
do like a little short set.

550
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,160
Like you don't see that much,
you know,

551
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,100
cause they were like in your
mind they are like mega stars.

552
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,870
But back then they were like guys
just trying to break in, you know.

553
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,940
And they all broke through me. Think
about those old HBO specials you had.

554
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,230
Dom I rarer, right. Excellent.
Yeah. Dom or a dice clay.

555
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,270
Bill Hicks, Sam Kennison, Bob
Nelson member, Bob Nelson,

556
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,250
Bob Nelson.
I'm from Long Island.

557
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:45,910
He was a legend there for 20 years
before I even started comedy.

558
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:49,390
So when I first met him I was like, oh
my God, it's Bob Nelson. Bob. I'd be,

559
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:53,230
I got a manager. Sussman became my
manager because of Bob Nelson. Really?

560
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,920
Bob Nelson decided to go super Jesus.
Yes.

561
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,810
And a sober, you know, with,
uh, like a, a guy who would do,

562
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,500
it'd be like a prayer buddy
and the prayer prayer buddy.

563
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:09,580
We came as manager I guess. I don't
know. I don't know if that's true.

564
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,290
He met a woman in the, any, any uh, got
rebaptized or whatever that is, you know,

565
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,970
and he, uh, he,

566
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,870
he totally did like a family friendly act
and nobody was really digging it and I

567
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:23,080
was like, you know, Bob was never that
dirty. No. I was like, I don't know what,

568
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,260
you know, he didn't have to
change anything. Yeah. And
for some reason I guess, no,

569
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,260
I think he wouldn't do certain places
because they served alcohol or something.

570
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,620
Oh, one of those things. Yeah. Maybe
I, I don't really know the whole story,

571
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:36,220
but I do know that it was a heartache when
he stopped doing it. Oh Wow. It's that.

572
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:40,450
Wow. That's crazy. Yeah.
He was a funny guy, man.

573
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,550
He was so like Jeff's gym.
It's funny bits.

574
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,770
Those are the things where like
when you put the balloons, you know,

575
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:50,800
to make the shoulder pads and all that
stuff, that was the thing where like,

576
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:51,634
you're like,

577
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,030
I feel sorry for the next guy who has to
follow that because this is going to be

578
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:58,030
like a, like almost a tank
being on tanking. Jamie,

579
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:01,960
can you just a Mike so that people
could see Dave's, sorry. It's okay.

580
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,410
But this is like, yeah, I tried to got
it. Camera. Yeah, that's good. Perfect.

581
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:07,010
Thank you. Thanks man. All right.

582
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,440
It's weird when you think back to those
guys that sort of just dropped off that

583
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:16,080
were really, really fine. Creed.
Remember him? I do remember creed.

584
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,700
Yeah.
I like these names because they're like,

585
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:21,580
I always think of them as like long
island. I'm very like precious. Not like,

586
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,550
you know, I'm sure you talked
about this cause you, you know,

587
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,510
you're a supporter of, of comedy,
but w auto and George who, you know,

588
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,870
I called into Ona and I go, uh, you
know, I think I asked Norman, I go,

589
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,640
did he ever work, you know, uh,
did he ever work la? And he's like,

590
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:40,190
no, I got, well he must have worked
Vegas. And I'm like, ah, for those,

591
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,060
you know, the fans listening and all
that, he was a, he recently passed away.

592
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:47,810
He was a great ventriloquists.
There was no one like him. And uh,

593
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,640
I wish I had seen one
of those Vegas shows.

594
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:52,850
That must have been awesome
because he is not a Vegas Act.

595
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,310
No, no, no, he's not. I did danger
fields with him. I did the prom shows.

596
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:01,450
We got like five weeks in a
row. Can you oh, prom shows.

597
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,810
See now that's the bootleg. I want to
hear. Oh my God. We had so much fun.

598
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,310
It was a crazy, do you remember danger
fields? Yeah. Do you remember, uh,

599
00:33:08,311 --> 00:33:11,140
the big Scottish guy that used to
run it before the son took over

600
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,420
Scottish power lifter.
He was fucking hilarious.

601
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,740
He was funnier than 90% of the comedians
there. And he was, he was a, a massive,

602
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:21,580
massive guy.

603
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:26,710
And he would do like these barbarian
fucking power lifts in his backyard.

604
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:30,220
He had like Olympic weights
in his backyard. He'd do
dead lifts and Shit all day.

605
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,520
The guy was enormous,
but like not like a bodybuilder,

606
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:38,260
just like this huge barrel of meat.
He would grab kids.

607
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:40,840
Like I saw him grab a kid by the neck,

608
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,970
grabbed his neck and his pants and
lifted them up during one of the prompts

609
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:48,370
shows cause they were allowed kids
get those long island Bronx kids. Yes.

610
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:52,390
They get crazy aggressive.
Kid went on stage,

611
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,800
took al Lulubelle's microphone away
from Laos and blew smoke in his face.

612
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,150
Wow. Yeah. And Aloe Bell had a meltdown
and then no one knew what the fuck to do.

613
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,490
That was insanity.
Nobody stopped it.

614
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
Was he naked at that point?
Cause you know,

615
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:07,090
he takes off his clothes
at the end of his act.

616
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,200
He stopped doing that. That's when
he stopped doing that. You know,

617
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,270
after the guy takes your microphone
then continue with your jokes.

618
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,800
You can't really a whip your cock
out then yeah. Those prompts shows,

619
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,550
I think every comic has to go through
those years of the prom shows at like a,

620
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:24,600
you know, there's two things that happened
at the branch. I, one of them is that,

621
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:27,630
uh, you know, you're like, what high
school is this? You know, these kids,

622
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:29,490
like they're already there drink,
you know,

623
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:31,620
like they're there too
adult for what you think.

624
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,550
And then you get really old and you're
like, wow, this is a, this is weird.

625
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:38,880
But now that those kinds of kids to fun
kids, like you know, the, the bad kids,

626
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:43,590
that's, that's like over it now. Like the
kids come out, they're all rolling on,

627
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,430
you know, Adderall and you
know, they've got their, their
phones out, they're happy,

628
00:34:47,431 --> 00:34:48,570
you know,
they're just glad to be out.

629
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,020
I had a cheap thing that I would do
where I would get him on my side.

630
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,550
Like right away we'll do a prompt shows.
I don't remember the exact wording,

631
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,180
but it was something along the lines of,
you know what,

632
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:05,210
what you guys are right now is adults
that don't know anything and all these

633
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:08,280
mother fuckers that are adults
that are telling you what to do,

634
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,990
look at their lives. Look, I'm miserable.
They are, and stop, stop the whole thing.

635
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,210
Take it from here.
You know,

636
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:18,030
it's basically like a Soundation of my
philosophy that I formed over light,

637
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:21,150
but this was when I was 21 and I
really just fucking wait, wait,

638
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,200
too stupid to have opinions. That was
an idiot. I feel like the older brother,

639
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,110
I was probably a little older than
21 because it was in New York,

640
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,970
so it must have been 24 God,
those days were crazy.

641
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,940
Don't even know if they don't.

642
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:38,250
They do like promising so different now
they're like political statements and

643
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:41,850
stuff, so it's like I'm bringing a spotted
owl as my date because I believe in,

644
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,140
you know the highway. We're
not even going to go out.

645
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,950
If you took them to danger fields today
and they, someone told a bunch of jokes,

646
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,260
Oh God lord,

647
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,670
it would be@thefrontpageofsalon.com
club would be shut down.

648
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,280
What's that showed that they improv does
once in a while where they bring all

649
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:03,750
those kids from a camp and you're
like in front of 11 year olds. Right.

650
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,560
I did that once and they didn't
even tell me to tone it down.

651
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,400
Ari went up in front of
me and got crazy dirty.

652
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:15,300
I mean Ari was just, all he wanted to
talk about was like, who? Here's Heather.

653
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:19,800
Dick socked. Raise your hand. Oh
Wow. Awesome. Awesome. It's awesome.

654
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:25,020
If you have it, you should try it.
And people were going nuts. Red faced.

655
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:28,440
Everybody's freaking out. Worse. I
forget the exact words he was using,

656
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:30,320
but it was something along
those lines like ask them like,

657
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,560
have you figured a girl yet?

658
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,980
Wow. All the comics were
like, I'm not changing my
material. I'm not going to like,

659
00:36:35,981 --> 00:36:38,170
so everyone just did it like
dirty and the kids love it.

660
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:39,900
But what was more uncomfortable
with watching the,

661
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:43,360
the chaperones cause they're like,
well what are we supposed to do?

662
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:48,610
We're going to get fired. That's a long
bus ride back to the camp ice cream.

663
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,470
Stop shaking.
Who wants ice cream?

664
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,350
That I would love to see already
in that situation. Cause you know,

665
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:59,120
sometimes even, or he makes me feel
uncomfortable when I'm watching them.

666
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,600
I'm an adult.
When we,

667
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,890
when we would do the prom shows,
they wouldn't rotate out the audience.

668
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,270
So there's 200 people in the crowd,
right? Date fields holds about 200 right?

669
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,180
Not about room. It's not a big
room. It's a dark room though. Very,

670
00:37:13,181 --> 00:37:17,320
you really don't know. Very cool room.
Anyway, they would get those people in.

671
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Then they would just start shoving new
people in and they wanted you to do like

672
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:28,270
what? They would do a rotation, you know?
So it'd be like auto and George, me, Alan,

673
00:37:28,271 --> 00:37:30,100
Lubell,
couple of other guys,

674
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,000
and that you would do a lineup and then
when the show, well the lineup was over,

675
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,940
they would just reintroduce your first
comedian and you were supposed to tell

676
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:40,360
the exact same jokes to the same people.
They would leave.

677
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,410
That was their strategy for crowd
control. So the guy says to me, he goes,

678
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,500
I think his name's Darren. He goes, you've
got to stop telling new jokes. I go,

679
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:51,430
what? He goes, he goes, because you're
doing like five shows a night. He goes,

680
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:53,410
you've got to stop telling you jokes
trying to get these people out here.

681
00:37:53,411 --> 00:37:56,150
You go back to the same junk.
So, oh my God, I'm not. I'm a,

682
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:59,740
you can't tell me what to do. You can't
tell him what to say. Like this is,

683
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,580
we have our job descriptions
confused here. I'm a, I'm a comedian,

684
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,100
you know you hire me
like I'm a subcontractor.

685
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,450
That's why you don't pay me insurance.

686
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,000
I go on for 30 minutes and
you don't tell me what to do.

687
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,230
You're either hire me or you don't.

688
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,570
That danger fields club.

689
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:15,570
I'm glad you brought that up because
they have like rules there that like no,

690
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,433
no other club.

691
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,680
Like did you ever bring up like why
is this such a big piano on stage?

692
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:22,860
And then they'll be like, oh you got to
understand that this was the original.

693
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:25,920
Like they have all these different things
like don't even like ask for a fork

694
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:29,010
there. It's like we don't allow
for, since the blood up, you know,

695
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,830
everything is like this long
historical story and um,

696
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,680
I just know like to get booked there you
have to call him like almost six months

697
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:39,520
in advance. It's like really? It's like,
how's your, how's your 2015 looking?

698
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,383
I was like,
I don't know.

699
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,050
I don't even know if I'm going
to be doing comedy by that. I,

700
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,240
that's the last time I called it out and
it's like we try and book like a month

701
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,660
in advance and like in comedy you
go week to week, you know if that,

702
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,610
you know in cities in the cities

703
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,450
book,

704
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:57,440
like a a Club headliner club on xannies
and Nashville or something along those

705
00:38:57,441 --> 00:38:59,990
lines.
But if it's like New York or La Yeah,

706
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,800
for like a $20 pottery back then I
think it was like 15 maybe 12 bucks or

707
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:06,770
something like that. But to go like
what are you doing next month? And like,

708
00:39:06,771 --> 00:39:09,650
you know, in your mind you're like,
I know I'm available because I suck,

709
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,560
but like what if something
amazing happens, you know?

710
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,250
Yeah.
You can't pick out that far in advance.

711
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,070
Well there's so old school they're
like from a different that they,

712
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,760
they have a different era appeal
to them. Yes. The whole place does.

713
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,370
You feel like you're in a time
capsule when you walk into it.

714
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,610
That's like the comedy store in La.
Like that.

715
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,810
He's the most clubby field club in this
town. And like whenever I go in there,

716
00:39:30,811 --> 00:39:34,440
I always feel like a little bit more
relaxed, you know? And like a, you know,

717
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:36,270
I'm not,
I'm not putting down the other clubs,

718
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:40,470
but I'd say like that's his clubby and
New York clubby as it as it gets here,

719
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:40,830
you know?

720
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,460
Yeah, I agree. You know,
that's the, the darkest. Yeah,

721
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,500
it's also the least intrusive and
sometimes it goes bad because it's La and

722
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,860
there's a lot of people in la that
wanted a lot of fucking attention.

723
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,560
There's a lot of people in la that don't
make good audience members because they

724
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:58,920
want a lot of attention and there's
no crowd control at the comedy store.

725
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,630
It's all comics work in there. So, you
know, I mean, that's how Mitzi wanted it.

726
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:05,210
She wanted the lunatics to run the asylum.

727
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,310
I just thought that would create the
most common, which it probably did.

728
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:12,420
But you know, you're dealing
with so many dick wads there.

729
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,890
If you put that club and other city, like
if that club was in New York, you know,

730
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:20,670
same look, same feel to it, you
probably get better audiences.

731
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,320
There's this different, there's definitely
a difference in the audience out here.

732
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,590
And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
saying it's wrong or anything,

733
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,880
but there's a lot more watchers
here than actual, like, you know,

734
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:34,340
you feel like they're there.
They're like, you know,

735
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:36,620
like you don't know if they're having
a good time because it just kind of

736
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:39,980
sitting and watching. Whereas in New York
there's a little bit more interaction.

737
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:43,400
There's a little bit more give and
take. But I would say on, on a whole,

738
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:44,900
I'm sure you're already in,
is live.

739
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,840
When you go on the road or like you play
like the ice house, something like that,

740
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,890
they're, they're pumped.
Like, I don't feel that, like
nowadays I feel like they're,

741
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:56,330
you know, they're like, okay,
let's give this a whirl.
Let's give it a try, you know?

742
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,430
And, uh, you know, I, uh, you know, I,

743
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,580
I hope it's worth my time because there's
a lot of great clips I want to watch,

744
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:06,350
you know. Um, I uh, on my feed,
I know. I don't know. I'm so old,

745
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:10,360
I don't even, I'll look right
terms. I think that audiences are

746
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,620
better now than they have in
years because we only, Jeanette,

747
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,310
I think people are more comedy
fans I've ever been before.

748
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,590
I hope you're right. I I feel like
especially that like that cool,

749
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,050
that cool audience that really
likes, you know, like the, the,

750
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:28,190
the hard dirty like I feel like they
had to like an endangered species.

751
00:41:28,191 --> 00:41:30,800
I feel like where are these people?
What happened in the last Mohicans?

752
00:41:30,801 --> 00:41:31,420
Where are they?

753
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,190
We have preserved, we have
game preserves, we keep them,

754
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,470
we have to bring them out
for death squad shows.

755
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,770
Oh, well that's good that you
connect with them like that.

756
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:41,380
And I know your fans like, like it that
way. But I'm saying like, you know,

757
00:41:41,381 --> 00:41:44,770
especially when I did the
comedy underground, you
know, I was like, I was like,

758
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:48,550
you know, this is, this is the last
roundup of the rough, dirty, you know,

759
00:41:48,551 --> 00:41:49,480
I really felt that way.

760
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,820
Well, it's not that the audience
isn't there, man. It's just the,

761
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,690
the amount of connection that
you have to the audience.

762
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:59,560
Like I've got a good connection
with Twitter and a good
connection with Facebook

763
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:03,250
and social media and podcasting,
so, right. I'm, I'm always like,

764
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:04,780
so they know where to find me,
right.

765
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,710
I'm saying where it's like there's a
lot of those comedy dirty comedy fans,

766
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:11,860
they might just might not hear you're in
town, they might not hear you're coming.

767
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,070
It might not know.
People that work in offices,

768
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:17,950
people that have jobs and mortgages
and kids and they're fucking busy.

769
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,490
They don't have time to, and then they'll
like, oh David, tell us in town, ah, fuck,

770
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:24,370
we missed him. And that happens
all the time. It's going to happen.

771
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,440
You know what's funny,
like you said,

772
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:28,470
all those different things which are
all like now they're not choices.

773
00:42:28,471 --> 00:42:29,520
You have to do all those things.

774
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,390
Then I was like in my head flashing
back to like how he man doll.

775
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:34,050
You remember when he was
doing those hour specials?

776
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,770
It's like he put on that big fake
hand. It's like I'm there, I'm there,

777
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,580
get the car ready, we're going.
This guy's wearing a crazy hand.

778
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:45,210
He blew up a balloon with, yeah,
look at that. What is that?

779
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,340
Yeah, he would do it with his nose, right?

780
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,920
He would put it over his whole
head and blow it up with his nose.

781
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,380
When I was,
when I was young and like you know,

782
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,620
you know like that that like in your
twenties when like you got some money but

783
00:42:55,621 --> 00:42:59,640
you got no money but like you got money
for like something dumb. So it was like,

784
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,200
I was like, you know like uncle Floyd is
in town. Oh Dude, I got to see this guy.

785
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,800
It's like pay my student
loan that can wait.

786
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,280
I have to see this guy who
is some kind of like weird.

787
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,240
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Yeah,

788
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,140
dude, I bombed going on
after uncle Floyd. Oh Wow.

789
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:18,650
What a cool story to actually
go on after him. Yeah, I never,

790
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,600
I had no idea who he was and I was in
New Jersey apparently. He's a legend.

791
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,890
Yes.
New Jersey

792
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,290
in parts of New Jersey.
And I thought,

793
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,970
I thought I was going to kill. I was
like, oh, this is going to be great.

794
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:35,720
I'm going to go on after this old dude.
Oh my God.

795
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:40,721
They loved him screaming out like all of
these phrases and sayings and I didn't

796
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:42,920
understand.
I never heard of

797
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,650
he, he is, uh, he's definitely
like a local, like almost like,

798
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:48,690
you know how like there
was a million Bozos,

799
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,500
like clowns that were like in your
rate on your TVs. He's that guy.

800
00:43:52,501 --> 00:43:56,760
He was like our, um, you know,
our kids show before, you
know, I guess Nickelodeon,

801
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,070
but it wasn't an adult kid show,

802
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,180
but what was he on?
Was he on cable access?

803
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,020
No, he was on like channel nine. It
was like local, whatever that was.

804
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:09,050
I think it was like right before cable.
It was like right before cable.

805
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,840
If you're on any real local
shows anymore are there,

806
00:44:11,841 --> 00:44:15,260
they're just like no local new
shutters. Nothing, but there's no,

807
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:19,060
it would never be like, do you
remember when stern had um, that yes.

808
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,350
Local show in New York,
so that was great.

809
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,100
He was on like a late night
channel or something like that.

810
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,420
That was his variety show. I don't know
all the particulars on that cause I,

811
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,930
I just remember it fleetingly.
But that was great.

812
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,550
You'd always tune and like there was some,

813
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,060
some, I guess you could say a
carnival freak about to do something.

814
00:44:36,061 --> 00:44:39,570
He brought all that into the show.
It was great. And it was just some,

815
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,340
I don't know what channel it was,
but it wasn't like NBC or snow.

816
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,150
It was like local channel nine or channel
three or something like that in New

817
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,930
York. No, no, it was WPIX
maybe. Yeah. I mean there's
probably like a cable channel,

818
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:54,840
right? It was it a cable show
that might've been cable,

819
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:58,380
that might have been cable. How about
bill box? Do you remember him? Bill Boggs,

820
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:02,070
the baseball player? No, bill box was
the local, another guy in New York,

821
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,690
this is all east coast.
I apologize guys.

822
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:05,130
But like he was another guy who was like,

823
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,710
he was somewhere between
like Regis and Maury Povich.

824
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,030
He was like this kind of Nice Guy.

825
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,720
But then he did like a comedy variety
show and that was I think the first show

826
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:16,350
that I bet I met Dana Gould
there. Um, what's his name? Uh,

827
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,520
there was like a couple of,
uh,

828
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,400
great comics that were like hanging
out there and like Dana Gould,

829
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:23,370
who was like a boy comic, you know that
right? And like 17 or something like that.

830
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,780
Yeah. He was on that show and I was like,
wow, man, this guy knows what he's doing.

831
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:32,340
I'm gonna contain a way, way, way back
in the day in Boston. And then, uh,

832
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:34,080
that was before he stopped doing comedy.

833
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:39,180
Like he was just about to do his showtime
special. Uh, he had a showtime special,

834
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:41,040
I believe, and he was just
about to do it. It was great.

835
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,260
This was your years and
years and years ago.

836
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:45,630
And then he's just stopped doing
comedy and he's writing I think for the

837
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:49,740
Simpsons writing for the Simpsons
for, for like, I think over 10 years.

838
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,770
And I saw him at that comedy meltdown
and I was like, whoa too. Where,

839
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,500
where have you been? You know, cause
I always loved his, his act, you know,

840
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,320
it's weird when a guy comes
back. Right. Well, you know,

841
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:00,540
you guys were all married with
families and stuff like that. You know,

842
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:03,660
I'm amazed to ever see you guys like out
on a Tuesday night, you know, I'm like,

843
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:08,070
Whoa, look at what it is. You know, I come
out and yeah, you like to do your time.

844
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,580
I gotta do time.
If you don't,

845
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:14,040
I feel like if you don't do sets like
regular weekends or weekdays sets,

846
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:18,060
you have to do them, then you have to
like pop in at the Improv. You have to,

847
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,360
you know, do spots at the ice house.
We do the ice house all the time.

848
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,900
That is such a cool hang man.
Oh that's excellent. Yeah.

849
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:29,190
The Ice House was the best. The
vibe of the place. It's fantastic.

850
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,960
And the fact that we've done how many men,

851
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:32,640
how many podcasts we've done from there?
Shit,

852
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,450
we're almost at a hundred and the
funder pussy shows we do there.

853
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,080
Oh my God. Do you ever do like a
question to answer when you crowd? Yeah,

854
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,500
I saw Seinfeld do at once. Then
there's what I stole the idea from him.

855
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,430
Seinfeld I saw stifled when
I was an open miker. Uh,

856
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:56,550
I was just about to do comedy like I
think I was like like a week before or a

857
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,420
week after,
whatever it was.

858
00:46:57,421 --> 00:47:00,750
And I saw him with his chick that he used
to bang from high school. It's crazy.

859
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,910
We're back together again at 21 you ever,

860
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,450
do you ever check your bank when
you're 17 all of a sudden, boom.

861
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:09,150
The both of your 21 I got
adults driving around.

862
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:11,760
You're going to give it to her anyway,
so we're going to see Seinfeld,

863
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,510
exciting night. And so he comes
out, he does the set kills,

864
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,370
gets this big round of applause leaves
and then comes back out for our question

865
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:22,830
and answer. And the
question answer, he would,

866
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:27,890
people would ask things and he would
just start riffing or telling jokes about

867
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:29,980
like that subject. Yeah. I

868
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,310
love that. I kind of do that,
I guess. Yeah. I'm a lot of
companies. We all do that.

869
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:37,420
Yeah, I've done it. I used to
do it a lot after shows. Um,

870
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:42,460
but this is the whole show. Is that
from the beginning to the end. Oh Wow.

871
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,910
Don't material. Wow. What it
is is they yell out, you know,

872
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:50,890
talk about the fucking clippers
owner. That's cool. Hi.
This fucking guy. And then,

873
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:51,550
you know,

874
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:56,380
you'd be amazed at how much
comedy gets improvised Saturday.

875
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,610
I love it. Actually use, I've got dude,
I've got two really good bits from that.

876
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,660
We got to set that up for Friday.
I'm in Santa Barbara.

877
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,030
The fuck it. Let's do it
Saturday, Saturday that can
you move it to Saturday? Yeah.

878
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,440
Yeah. Move Friday, Saturday.

879
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:15,620
And I'm in fucking Ruben's pre Bridgewater
move to show judge for you. Um,

880
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,800
pre tweeting.
You guys [inaudible]

881
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,410
it's cool that you brought up stuff.
I'll have you done his show.

882
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,050
The cars and coffee.
I call it millionaires wearing seat belts.

883
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,120
I'm not putting anyone down,

884
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:30,770
but I like how in the beginning
they will have to look like, okay,

885
00:48:30,771 --> 00:48:33,050
now we're getting our own coffee.
Is that what this is?

886
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,350
Pretend you're not in
a helicopter right now.

887
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,240
He had $1 million Porsche. He was
driving around. How cool is that?

888
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,470
73 1973 Carrera rs.

889
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,550
You're not a car guy like
that. Ours. I don't have it
like that. Yeah, that's crazy.

890
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:52,030
I have a couple of cars that's cool to
have a couple of cars but I mean you're

891
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:56,210
not like a classic car dude.
No, I don't like old shit. Yeah.

892
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,590
I like,
I like the new shit really.

893
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:04,591
Technology like I have a Porsche and it
has a like the Porsche's technologies

894
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:10,270
really old. This car's a 2007. It's a
seven year old car anyway, but their uh,

895
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:12,610
their navigation systems,
their dog shit,

896
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:16,480
they don't have updates where they
get like traffic. You need all that.

897
00:49:16,481 --> 00:49:19,420
I mean it's out there. Why wouldn't
you have it? Like I've said,

898
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,750
I have a friend who has one of the
brand new Porsche's and it doesn't have

899
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:26,590
traffic updates like, well what is
this? I go, this is some 2006 shit.

900
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:30,790
Like why do you have, I had like a
traffic warning like four years ago.

901
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,950
I was like three or four
years ago and one of my cars.

902
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,820
So I always put like new shit in
there. I think that's, you know

903
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,740
that that to me is like when people go
like, what's the road like? I'm like,

904
00:49:39,741 --> 00:49:43,850
have you ever smelled a road
comics car that there is? No,

905
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,220
it's somewhere between submarine and like,

906
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:50,720
I mean it smells like 15 different types
of Taco bell from like different states.

907
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,790
Jimmy John's mix them with Dell tie,
you know,

908
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:55,340
it's like the Charlie wipes
would give up on that.

909
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:59,360
There would be nothing like the Guy Shat
and their fucked in there. You know,

910
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:03,560
he cried in there, you know, it's, we see
Ralphie base car. No, I didn't receive it.

911
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,990
It's ruthless. It's really about the
road car smell. They like, you know it,

912
00:50:08,991 --> 00:50:09,860
it's impossible.

913
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,060
Is that stern? Yeah. Howard Stern's on
the latest episodes and what it look nice,

914
00:50:13,061 --> 00:50:17,100
he buys. This is what I don't like
is that these cars are all classic.

915
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:21,210
I mean for him it must be like really fun
because he's in an efficient Natto but

916
00:50:21,211 --> 00:50:24,760
I'm, I guess I'm not that kind of an
efficient, I don't, I don't like old cars.

917
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:28,130
That is a cool call. Nope, it's fuck,
that's a GTO. He's a Porsche guy.

918
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:28,860
I know that he had,

919
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,550
he collects Porsches and I think a lot
of these cars that he used on the show,

920
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:35,000
he actually just rents for the
show because, uh, he's had one,

921
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:37,650
a couple of breakdown before and he's
just like, oh, they, they, they're,

922
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,840
they're going to send us another one.

923
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,200
So I think maybe he just gets
to these cars for just the show.

924
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,590
Maybe you're right. Well,
I know you had Letterman.

925
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,630
Letterman has a souped up Volvo.
They did a show.

926
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:52,850
He has a Volvo with like a fucking 450
horsepower engine in it and a six speed

927
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:57,470
transmission. Yeah, no, it's great.
I'm going to do a show a lot.

928
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,470
Shit, man. He took a lot of shit for
only having white people on a show.

929
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:04,940
Then he had Chris rock on. Only
white men. We just say a Duchenne.

930
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,290
I'm going to do a comics
walking to pink dot after the,

931
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,870
so how did it go over there? I didn't get
on. All right, let's get a snickers bar.

932
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,130
The Walk to pink dot. Up Sunset.
That is my favorite walk.

933
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:20,270
[inaudible] it's Saturday night at two
o'clock in the morning or norms with don

934
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:23,280
berries. That police
crackles, dude. Pink Dot.

935
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,350
The whole that whole strip from,

936
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,920
from that we'll trolley cart place that
sells cheeseburgers. What's that place?

937
00:51:28,921 --> 00:51:33,870
Carney's carnies from carnies on up that
plays. Crackles like it's got a feeling.

938
00:51:33,871 --> 00:51:36,960
It's like there's a vortex
that's been created there.

939
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,260
You know, cause I don't live here. Like
I'll, I'll be walking like after the show,

940
00:51:40,261 --> 00:51:42,960
like I'll just be walking around
cause I'm New York time, you know,

941
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:45,180
I want it later and all
that. And like, you know,

942
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,180
in New York if you're up late
and somebody comes up to you,

943
00:51:48,181 --> 00:51:51,180
they usually want money or, or
they're up to no good. You know,

944
00:51:51,181 --> 00:51:52,860
it might be like a psychotic or something,

945
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,300
but if you're within like I'd say a half
a mile of the comedy store on a Monday

946
00:51:57,301 --> 00:51:59,960
night you're going to walk into a comic.
So like I would come up,

947
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,050
it's like I'm a huge fan. I'm like,
what? It's like wearing a hoodie.

948
00:52:04,051 --> 00:52:07,370
Like I didn't even see them.
How many guys

949
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,640
you get to hitting you up to
ask to open for you on the road?

950
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:14,060
Um, I get, I get a lot of guys that uh,

951
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,490
that kind of like I worked with,

952
00:52:16,491 --> 00:52:19,360
but I really kind of have like
a small pool of dudes that I,

953
00:52:19,361 --> 00:52:21,680
I want to throw work too.
Like this weekend in Bray,

954
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:25,430
it was Tony as we talked about and Sean
rouse who I think have you ever had

955
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:28,820
shown on here showing me you really
should have money or he is like,

956
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,960
he is like an amazing dude, you
know, uh, his rheumatoid arthritis,

957
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:35,270
so he can't really travel that
much, but his act, and you'll,

958
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,291
you'll back me up on this.

959
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:40,910
I mean like he's an amazing joke writer
and he also is like, he, he is hardcore.

960
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:44,300
He does not give a shit. And
uh, you know, east coast,

961
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:46,410
I have other guys that do that,
but now they're all like headliner.

962
00:52:46,411 --> 00:52:48,050
So I feel like I've done my job with them,

963
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:51,050
but I like to use local guys too
because I feel like, you know,

964
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,280
a lot of guys rolled into town,

965
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:54,470
they bring their own support and
then these local guys who like,

966
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,780
I never get on my own stage,
you know, it's my home club.

967
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,270
So I try and use the local guys
to middle or at least two guests.

968
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,540
That's very cool. Have you, I gave
up on that and your tail. Well,

969
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:04,940
you must be hit on like, you
know, a thousand dudes. Well,

970
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:08,030
it's not just that I just had too many
bad experiences with local dudes and I

971
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:09,560
didn't know like what was wrong.

972
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,780
There are shitty material that I
couldn't believe I had to listen to or,

973
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:17,720
um, uh, just do shit guys. Like,

974
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:20,420
remember when we did that
Maxim tour with Charlie Murphy?

975
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:24,920
I remember that one guy that we ran into
in Boston that was so fucking creepy.

976
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,040
He was like hanging around

977
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,550
the green room and he was hammered and
he was like staring at us sideways and he

978
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:33,060
was just like creepy, jealous act like
a dick. And we're sharing agreement.

979
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,490
Me and Charlie Murphy and
John Heffron two great guys,

980
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,850
but Sharon is green room with this idiot.
And then they just, they kicked him out.

981
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,500
He was fucking trouble plastered.

982
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:45,850
And was he and he was the opener or
what was he? He was in every town.

983
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:50,080
We would take a local guy. That's how I
met Segura. Socorro was doing Phoenix.

984
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:50,580
Oh really?

985
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,990
I mean it wasn't local,
but you know,

986
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:55,200
for whatever reason they chose him and
maybe he was in the area or something

987
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:57,810
like that. And I was like,
Holy Shit, is this guy funny?

988
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,630
So then I started taking
him on the road too. Yeah,

989
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,460
they had local comedy competitions.

990
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,500
And so I think Tom just like
applied for that comedy competition,

991
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:07,350
won it and then got he's,
he murdered it.

992
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,620
He was the number one guy like at all
the people that were local guys that

993
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:13,230
opened up for us. Oh that's
right. But Mcdermott,

994
00:54:13,231 --> 00:54:17,040
we met in Phoenix that he was a,
he did an open mic night.

995
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,910
That's where we met Mcdermott
or a contest. The contest.

996
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:24,030
It was a different contest, wasn't
it? I thought it was a man of comedy.

997
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,650
I don't think it was because,
um,

998
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,710
it was at the Improv and the show was
at the Phoenix theater and that was, uh,

999
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,790
it was just a regular sheet.
Yeah, the celebrity theater.

1000
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:34,830
It was with the one that's in the round.
It was just a regular show,

1001
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,430
but it was some sort of a contest to Josh
McDermitt killed it. And we were like,

1002
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:39,510
Holy Shit,
this guy funny.

1003
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:43,320
And then I was one of those weekends
that Joey vanished on us because I,

1004
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:48,120
there was a series of weekends over the
years were Diaz. Joe would just vanish.

1005
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,930
And then, you know, sometimes you go
with, fuck, did you go, I told you dog,

1006
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:54,440
I couldn't do that gay guy.
I told you I never had fuck fucking goes.

1007
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,920
And that's the classic story.

1008
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:58,230
But so I used to bring two
guys in the road with me then.

1009
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,170
So one guy could cover it
spread if Joey would Vanna.

1010
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,840
Okay. There you go.
You've got your backup.

1011
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:05,790
Well cause I didn't want to stop
using Joey. It's like the president,

1012
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:09,180
he's got those two helicopters, you
know, just in case the Justin Case guy.

1013
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,950
Well I'm like you, it's like
I, I feel like I have a,

1014
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:14,400
an obligation to support
these kind of guys. Yeah, no,

1015
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:15,630
you're very good to you dudes.

1016
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:18,270
And I would say that like
when I see a guy on the road,

1017
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,480
like I let the club picked the opener.
A lot of time I go like whoever,

1018
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:24,710
whoever the guy is that you want to do.
Cause I, I always feel that like, uh,

1019
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:25,380
you know,

1020
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,410
even if the guy is rough that like at
least we'll get to perform in front of a

1021
00:55:28,411 --> 00:55:32,000
real crowd, which is sometimes
difficult to get that going for.

1022
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,010
And usually like a lot of
the cleaner acts, you know,

1023
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:38,040
the straight ahead acts don't want a dirty
open, they don't want to dirty opener.

1024
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,250
You know that is true, you
know. Well that's a real issue.

1025
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:43,530
That was an issue for
shift here for a long time.

1026
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,410
Guys didn't want to Middlin oh yeah,
exactly.

1027
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:50,430
As guys don't want Diaz middle like Diaz
middled for a couple of people at the

1028
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:51,510
Miami in Providence.

1029
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:55,470
It was just the most horrific thing you
could ever win foam there. That's his,

1030
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,333
that's his thing.

1031
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:00,770
Do half his act in Spanish and they
would go fucking crazy. And he's Cuban.

1032
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,410
He's got a Cuban Spanish
accent so they know. You know,

1033
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,730
they know he's one of them.
They,

1034
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:10,590
I never seen anybody murder 200
people the way Joey Diaz Murray,

1035
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:14,420
200 people in front of a,
what is his name to sings?

1036
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,910
I don't care. I don't care. Kevin Meeney.

1037
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,660
Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's like
one of those like how did, who made,

1038
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:21,580
who made the lineup

1039
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:26,470
some asshole decided to Joey Diaz
in Miami open up for Kevin. Meaning

1040
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:27,580
yeah.

1041
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:31,170
The worst thing is like you do like a
casino show or something like that and

1042
00:56:31,171 --> 00:56:34,660
like you're like, who can I get to open?
Cause it's like a casino town. You know,

1043
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,840
so then you're like, you
know, like, you know,

1044
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:38,580
like some guys will
drive for it of course,

1045
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,840
but then there's gotta be like
some local guy like, you know,

1046
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,400
just degenerate gambler guy that
you're like trying to like call up. Oh,

1047
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:47,960
I didn't know you lived in Reno, you know,
or something like that. So, but yeah, no,

1048
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:51,210
it's good that you do it. And I
think all the comics, like they,

1049
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,140
they know it's important like
that, uh, you know, they, they,

1050
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,080
they tip the respect back up. So this
guy in the green one with the trauma,

1051
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,080
I don't know what that was about.

1052
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,080
I mean, he was just a crazy, he was older
than us too. It probably was bitter.

1053
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,680
He probably really,
really better.

1054
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,040
He wasn't very funny either and
he was just whatever the guy was.

1055
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,380
It wasn't Boston.
Well I feel like it wasn't Boston now,

1056
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,680
but wherever the fuck it was,
the guy was a dick and it was like,

1057
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,530
that's the risky take. We,
you know, we did 22 dates.

1058
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,350
Everybody was nice and friendly,
met a lot of cool comics,

1059
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,310
and then we got one shithead.

1060
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:21,440
But that one shit had just turned
me off to it so much. I'm like, oh,

1061
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,640
cause it was the worst kind of shit head,
you know, the, the Jealous Shithead,

1062
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:29,480
the creepy super drunk jealous shithead.
Yeah. You're going to do, yeah.

1063
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:30,423
It's,
it's,

1064
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:36,810
it's also like you feel like you
get upset if you bring someone,

1065
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,780
you know, or you have someone local open
and it doesn't work out and you're like,

1066
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:43,260
I could had Tony Hinchcliffe.
Yeah. I could have had, you know,

1067
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:45,520
I could've brought Ari with me.
I could've brought Dunkin with me.

1068
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:47,410
It's like there's only so much time.

1069
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:52,690
I mean, at up we had like probably
four guest spots plus Sean plus Tony.

1070
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,820
And like it was a long
shot. But you know, uh,

1071
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,460
the crowd really was
digging the fact that like,

1072
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,460
it was like all these fresh faces
coming up and then we're like, wow,

1073
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:02,060
somebody else, you know,
like, and you know,

1074
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,790
it's the door guys and
all that kind of stuff.

1075
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:07,330
And like when I worked the door at the
Improv back in the eighties whatever,

1076
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,750
that was like our big moment when somebody
called like, hey, you can go on stage.

1077
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,870
You know, like you got five minutes
clear these people out, whatever it is,

1078
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:16,990
and I was like, you know, it's, it's
cool that some clubs are into that.

1079
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:19,060
Some clubs are not, they're more
like a, you know what I'm saying?

1080
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:22,090
Like Appleby style, like, well, we've got
to get him Outta here. Yeah, right, right,

1081
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,920
right.
So Applebee's.

1082
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,333
Yeah.

1083
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,130
Plug where you're like looking at
the food coming out of the kitchen.

1084
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:30,170
You're like,
this is a food club that does comedy.

1085
00:58:30,171 --> 00:58:32,150
It's not a comedy club with food.
You know?

1086
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,610
They definitely have those,
man.

1087
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,730
It's a weird thing when you're doing
comedy and looking down and people are

1088
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:40,480
cutting into a state when they're
looking up at you and I go, this is what,

1089
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:42,790
they're barely paying attention.
They're reading, they're fucking food.

1090
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:47,050
They're barely paying attention. It's
just such a silly way to, to do comedy,

1091
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:51,160
but it's a good way to maximize
money and time. Absolutely.

1092
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,710
Especially for people that want
to go on a date and dinner.

1093
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,180
They don't have the time.
I was like,

1094
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:57,190
let's go to a comic couple of feet
of the club. They have good food.

1095
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,650
I really don't want to get
a steak but that's funny.

1096
00:58:59,651 --> 00:59:03,190
The state cause it's like was that
in this some guys man fantasy.

1097
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:08,350
I'm going to go eat up big flank steak
and here's some dirty material and then

1098
00:59:08,351 --> 00:59:13,351
I'm going to bang the shit out of my lady
if we win the raffle for free tickets

1099
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:15,130
to see if you

1100
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:19,120
steak too like I mean it's going
to slow you down a little bit.

1101
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,620
Exactly.
You know that's a full Tom

1102
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,910
watching some comedy with
a full tummy in Tucson.

1103
00:59:25,911 --> 00:59:28,880
I had to do one of those rooms were half
the crowd was standing. I was so pissed.

1104
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:34,100
Oh it's so bad for those people standing.
What do you think of standing shows?

1105
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:37,640
I didn't know how bad it was
until we went to see Stan hope.

1106
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:43,020
Where do we go stay on a here in Los
Angeles that was lucky club or Asian.

1107
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:45,440
I don't remember the name of the place,
but anyway,

1108
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:49,730
stand hopes on stage and there was a very
small amount of seats and then there's

1109
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:51,770
a back area near the bar that
we were all standing out.

1110
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:56,771
It's me and Brian and who else
can they can go and maybe Stan.

1111
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,660
Anyway, um, so Stan hope and um, I
think Brendan Walsh opened for him.

1112
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,220
Stan hope and solace, you know, about an
hour and a half, the whole show total,

1113
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,910
something like that. And by the time
20 minutes was going on, I was like,

1114
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:14,600
my fucking back hurts. My
feet hurt. This is stupid.

1115
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:17,270
We're just standing here
like we're not even moving.

1116
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,320
So when when you're standing you not
even move. It's like a static exercise,

1117
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,740
you know, like you don't realize it until
like 20 minutes and you're like, oh,

1118
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:29,030
this is uncomfortable. Like just
standing in one spot. This fucking sucks.

1119
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:33,710
It's trying not to lock my legs. I didn't
want to get, I think Aiken walking out.

1120
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:36,040
I've been told we've watched it.
I'm sorry.

1121
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,250
I've been trying to talk to Doug for like
a couple of weeks now. I know, like he,

1122
01:00:39,251 --> 01:00:43,150
he's on the, like a super big club
tour. I mean, like a bar tour, but, uh,

1123
01:00:43,151 --> 01:00:47,170
there's a show on history town, you love
history stuff. I called the evolution of,

1124
01:00:47,171 --> 01:00:50,110
of, of Hitler or the evolution
of Nazis or something like that.

1125
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:53,980
And it shows like Hitler, like the early
years, kind of like the, uh, you know, um,

1126
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:56,020
the Westman called saved by the bell,
the early years,

1127
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,860
and it shows him like
young Hitler and he's like,

1128
01:00:59,861 --> 01:01:04,840
it's just him and I believe it's a knocker
balls, but a, who's the Big Fat Guy? Uh,

1129
01:01:04,841 --> 01:01:07,900
you know, talking about the
Lou Carla Gun, uh, whatever.

1130
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,970
So it's just shows him like in,

1131
01:01:09,971 --> 01:01:13,530
in these like pubs talking
his talk and I just,

1132
01:01:13,531 --> 01:01:16,390
people standing and they're drinking.
I'm like, that's a Doug Stanhope show.

1133
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,510
That's a Doug Stanhope show right there.

1134
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,430
They're like into it and they're
heckling him and he's yelling at him.

1135
01:01:21,431 --> 01:01:26,200
And I'm like, that is Doug Stan hope
in the, and Hitler Times. And then,

1136
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:29,050
you know, he worked his way up to Munich,
which I guess was the biggest, you know,

1137
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,760
that was a big thing. You can do.
Yeah. Even had choreographed audiences,

1138
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,790
it would do the boot thing. He
had a whole crowd of him. He,

1139
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:42,250
I'm sure he said to girls life, it goes,
how many seats are empty? How many,

1140
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:45,800
how many of those are comps?
Did they pay for the room?

1141
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:50,880
Is it a paper out there? But a false,
these people stand up to stand.

1142
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:55,560
Hope's a opener. A junior stop.
Do you know this guy? He's on the,

1143
01:01:55,561 --> 01:01:58,210
on the ground and like a, you know,
it was cool because comedy central,

1144
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:01,690
we went back and forth with the list on
who's on the show like and uh, you know,

1145
01:02:01,691 --> 01:02:05,080
uh, I said, you've got to get this junior
guy on. And everybody was like super,

1146
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,420
super impressed with him
because he is so different.

1147
01:02:07,421 --> 01:02:11,230
He's Doug's opener and he is just,
I met him in Chicago and I was like,

1148
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:12,330
he blew me away.
He was great.

1149
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,570
Yeah, he's good man. And
he's, you know, really like,

1150
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:18,480
like you see him and Stan hope together,
they match

1151
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:19,860
well. Yes, they did.

1152
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:23,930
Well, it's the perfect guy for
that crowd. He's a funny guy.

1153
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,390
Doug does the same thing. You know,
I think it's really important,

1154
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,590
but I think we all,

1155
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:31,880
none of us came up without assistance,
you know,

1156
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,680
all of us in,
in comedy.

1157
01:02:33,681 --> 01:02:38,090
Like we got to see other people work and
we learn from them and we talk to them

1158
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:40,810
and they gave us advice on
who to call and, you know,

1159
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:43,940
we all got help from the other
headliners. We all did, you know,

1160
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,830
as we were becoming professional.

1161
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,090
But I, I never waited for help. I mean,

1162
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,560
I really was so obsessed with
doing material and like, you know,

1163
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:54,660
getting on, I think that they
kind of saw it like, hey,

1164
01:02:54,661 --> 01:02:57,490
this guy really wants to do
it. So, you know, they kind of,

1165
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,330
you know what I'm saying? Cause I
never would get in their face. Like,

1166
01:03:00,331 --> 01:03:04,650
I remember just like asking a guy like,
you know, I hate to ask you this, but, uh,

1167
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,220
you know, like, do you know any like
open mics and like, you know, uh,

1168
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:11,130
they were like, yeah, no, that's, that's
a good question. And then, you know,

1169
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:13,230
I would do, and you know,
they sent me to the office,

1170
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:15,990
Mike and then I didn't see the next guy,
that guy again for like five years,

1171
01:03:15,991 --> 01:03:19,650
you know, it was cause I was doing
open mics know he was like a big comic,

1172
01:03:19,651 --> 01:03:23,520
you know. Wow. That's very cool. When
you run into someone like that. Yeah.

1173
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:26,280
I mean like you know, whenever, whenever
they come up to you and go like, you know,

1174
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:28,050
I'm thinking of doing
comedy and then you go like,

1175
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:30,360
you know you should try it here. And in
the, they always have that look of like,

1176
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:34,260
well I thought that you were going to
get me on stage right now. And it's like,

1177
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:36,390
well you know, this isn't
bagger Vance. You know,

1178
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:38,340
like you got to make an effort
on your own too. You know,

1179
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:39,640
I talked to this kid once,

1180
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:43,530
I hosted the open mic night
once at the comedy store and a,

1181
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:47,290
a kid went up for his first time
and he was funny. And, and I,

1182
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,710
and I remember saying to the audience
like, like that kid has talent.

1183
01:03:50,711 --> 01:03:53,410
Like if he really wants to do it,
like if you really want to do it, man,

1184
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:56,380
you could really be a comic.
And he was like, thanks so much.

1185
01:03:56,381 --> 01:03:58,840
That means so much in. The audience
clapped and everybody's really happy.

1186
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:01,630
I was like, that's awesome. It's so
cool to see. Like we may one day,

1187
01:04:01,631 --> 01:04:03,610
see that guy might be
professional comedian.

1188
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,790
Then I ran into him in England like
years later and he's, he's on the road.

1189
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:10,630
Oh that's great. Doing stand up. I
wish I could remember his name. Sorry.

1190
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:14,040
Eddie is wasn't funny enough for
me to remember his name. He was,

1191
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,590
I just have too many people.
I was kind of hoping for the other story.

1192
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:20,670
Then I run over to pink dot. 10 years
later was sandwiches, sandwiches.

1193
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,840
Look on his face. He's like, you could
have saved me the kiosk. You could help.

1194
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,990
But by you saying that that made
his like night. It made his week.

1195
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:30,740
It made his month. I mean that, that
was cool that you like, you know,

1196
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:33,570
and you weren't like, you know, just like
blowing smoke up his ass. You were like,

1197
01:04:33,571 --> 01:04:34,404
you really liked him.

1198
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:36,370
Yeah, no, he was really
funny. You know, I've had it,

1199
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:39,140
I hadn't happened to me a bunch of times
when I was an open miker whether it's

1200
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,210
someone who gives you a bump,

1201
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,900
you just say says something nice to you
and it just gives you this big Marin did

1202
01:04:43,901 --> 01:04:48,010
it once for the longest time, Marin.
And I like, I didn't go after him.

1203
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:50,980
Like he would say like stupid shit about
me and I like let it slide because you

1204
01:04:50,981 --> 01:04:55,810
know, he's, he's crazy. He gets,
he gets, I think he's awesome.

1205
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:59,560
I love the guy, but you know, he is
what he is. He's got his own thing.

1206
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,320
And so for the longest time we had like
this little negative thing back and

1207
01:05:02,321 --> 01:05:05,020
forth until I actually wound up having
a conversation with them and doing the

1208
01:05:05,021 --> 01:05:08,830
podcast. Now I love the guy. I really
do. I think it's awesome. But um,

1209
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,150
the reason why I wouldn't go after him
is because when I was an open miker he

1210
01:05:13,151 --> 01:05:16,450
pulled me aside one day
after my set and just said,

1211
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,930
hey know you're doing the right thing.
This is great. It's really cool to see,

1212
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:22,180
you know, just, uh, keep
doing your thing, man. Don't,

1213
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:24,670
don't let anybody tell you
any differently. Like, you've
got something cool here.

1214
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:28,930
And I was like, wow, that's
awesome. You know? So for me
that was like, that's great.

1215
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:31,570
Yeah. I laughed and I was like,
Whoa, I could do this. You know,

1216
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:33,130
like I could be a fucking comedian.

1217
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:35,140
A real comedian just told
me I could be a comedian.

1218
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:40,250
Wow. So mark, where was this an
ls was, no, no, this was Boston

1219
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:41,743
88.

1220
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,780
Mark had come back from the comedy
store when he was on our podcast.

1221
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:51,781
He told some of the craziest
fucking Kennison story about,

1222
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,910
um, the comedy store and
the coke days. He was,

1223
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:59,150
he had left that and come back to Boston.
So he was there for like the,

1224
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:03,280
the hay day of kinisons cocaine
binge. It's, which is like the s 86,

1225
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:07,150
like in that era, and then came
back into Boston. So I met him then.

1226
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:10,900
And so he was an established comedian
in Boston. He was like, you know,

1227
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:14,380
you'd work at the comedy connection
or Nicks or any of these clubs.

1228
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,360
And I was just starting out so,

1229
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:21,120
well what I was started in New York and
then I met mark and Tom Roads where the

1230
01:06:21,121 --> 01:06:22,710
two guys that like we're,

1231
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:25,980
I was foot found them like incredibly
mysterious cause they had already lived in

1232
01:06:25,981 --> 01:06:28,550
other cities for like a few years.
I like,

1233
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:31,890
I didn't even know that was possible in
comedy because I was stuck in this open

1234
01:06:31,891 --> 01:06:36,810
mic world. I was like, really?
And he's like, yeah, no I
was in San Francisco, man,

1235
01:06:36,811 --> 01:06:39,540
you should check out that town. It's
great. And I'm like, like what did you do?

1236
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,640
He's like, no man, you just
hang out and like, you know,

1237
01:06:41,641 --> 01:06:44,070
you stay in a friend's couch and do all
these great sets and all that kind of

1238
01:06:44,071 --> 01:06:46,560
stuff. So I didn't even know that that
was possible. I thought like, you know,

1239
01:06:46,561 --> 01:06:48,210
I'm in New York,
I don't want to,

1240
01:06:48,211 --> 01:06:51,540
I don't want to lose my chance of maybe
getting a spot next week. You know,

1241
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:54,330
like it was one of those things like
where the spots controlled your life.

1242
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,340
It's like, well I can't, you know,

1243
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:59,520
I know that's a holiday and all the
real comics will be with their family,

1244
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:03,660
so it's going to be great for me. I'm
going to get on twice. You remember that?

1245
01:07:03,661 --> 01:07:07,140
It was like thanksgiving. Everybody's with
their families. Are you available? Yes.

1246
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:12,410
We had a guy who came from Minneapolis
to Boston and just immediately was

1247
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:16,050
accepted. This guy was a
comic in Minneapolis. Ah,

1248
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,200
wow. Well that was Hedberg he
worked over there. Yeah, heavily.

1249
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:23,260
Hedberg was in Minneapolis.
Minneapolis. Was that acme? I,

1250
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,410
I assume it was from acme and then he went
to Florida. So he was like two comics.

1251
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:33,060
He was a Florida comic and it was or
whatever. And he came up to New York,

1252
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,060
I think even to New York
before we went to La. Right.

1253
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:39,500
Um, I don't know. I didn't
meet him until La. Okay. Yeah.

1254
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:44,120
So like in New York. I know he was there
for a couple of years and uh, then he,

1255
01:07:44,121 --> 01:07:46,860
he popped out to La and then I
think it was just by coastal.

1256
01:07:46,861 --> 01:07:51,030
I mean they were on the road pretty much.
I didn't go to know that guy. Really? Oh,

1257
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,400
for some reason I thought
you guys had known. No,

1258
01:07:53,401 --> 01:07:56,870
I mean we were both good friends
with Stan hope and uh, I,

1259
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:00,660
I mean he was real friendly. I met him
one night at the, uh, at the comedy store.

1260
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,700
We went back to back at the comedy store.

1261
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:05,970
I would have loved to have seen him there.
That would be cool.

1262
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,833
That would have been a cool shit.

1263
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,690
It was a cool show because there was
only like 50 people in the crowd and they

1264
01:08:09,691 --> 01:08:12,990
were like speckled, you know,
scattered out. And it was, she was,

1265
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,680
those are some of the best shows,
the,

1266
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:18,040
that people commonly store shows and the
or, you know, what's cool about the, uh,

1267
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:19,920
the, the comedy store? Just like when,

1268
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:23,240
when the crowd is there really to laugh
and not just because they made a mistake

1269
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,230
and they went in there
because they thought it was a,

1270
01:08:25,231 --> 01:08:26,840
like the parking garage for the Hyatt.

1271
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:30,260
Don't you ever feel like there's people
sitting there going like, wait a minute,

1272
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:34,790
this is in the Hyatt, you know, I
can't believe what happened here.

1273
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:37,940
Where's my room? Yeah, like the elevator.

1274
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:41,030
But when they're there to really like
just hang out and like let the experience

1275
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:43,800
wash over. They are the coolest
crowd and sound. They are.

1276
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:46,460
It's a great room and the room has energy.

1277
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:49,250
There's an energy in that room where it's,

1278
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:53,900
you're talking about so many fucking
decades of laughter permeated the walls.

1279
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,260
The problem is just too many douchebags
that pass through that whole area on the

1280
01:08:57,261 --> 01:09:01,490
strip is just filled with fuck
heads, you know? Uh, the, uh,

1281
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:05,120
just like people walking around like
house of Blues People. Yeah. There's that.

1282
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:08,210
And then there's also like,
just like Ellie actors,

1283
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,820
you know like people who are like,
just like I was saying earlier,

1284
01:09:10,821 --> 01:09:12,790
they're like a little
needy cause attention.

1285
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,210
They don't make the best audience members.

1286
01:09:14,211 --> 01:09:17,330
Like I've seen more heckling at the
store than any more on the planet. Right.

1287
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,320
You agree with that one club
where there's been more heckling?

1288
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:25,580
There's not, nothing is maybe
something in Florida. I don't know.

1289
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,370
Maybe the place in Miami, they
probably exist anymore. It's gone.

1290
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,210
What about to close her down? What about
like at a heavy play? Her most to be.

1291
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,850
Of course you do. Yeah. Comedy Magic Club.

1292
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,760
I think if you heckle there because
they are so they'll pull you out on the

1293
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:42,210
street sheet in the back of the head.
They serve you, they put you on a spit.

1294
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:45,620
Like will not accept anything
like zero tolerance. Yeah.

1295
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:48,430
He doesn't want any assholes there. He
didn't, he won't serve shots either.

1296
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,480
You won't let you get fucked up.
None of that.

1297
01:09:50,481 --> 01:09:53,810
Cause it's like a museum that does comedy.
It really is a museum of comedy.

1298
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:57,530
He's what? A fucking
great guy. He's the best.

1299
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:00,740
Those those guys that had been there
for that long and like that club's been

1300
01:10:00,741 --> 01:10:04,070
around since the 70s
right? Yeah, I think so.

1301
01:10:04,071 --> 01:10:07,190
And all the guys that like the legends
that play there like channeling Atlanta

1302
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,360
went stuff guide I guess.

1303
01:10:08,361 --> 01:10:11,180
I assume they had played there when they
were younger and they just like came up

1304
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:13,520
through this like amazing system of like,
you know,

1305
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:16,580
they were already kind of famous or they
would like the best comics in town or

1306
01:10:16,581 --> 01:10:19,070
something like that and they would do
the new material there and it's a great

1307
01:10:19,071 --> 01:10:23,480
place for it to close. Always done that
Sunday night gig. He does it last now.

1308
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:26,260
Like a lot of the Sundays other guys
doing, I've done a couple of them, um,

1309
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:29,570
because he's doing the road now.
Leno's uh, he's out there slinging it.

1310
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:33,200
I wonder how much tickets are because I
really would like to see where he is a

1311
01:10:33,201 --> 01:10:36,650
lot. Like how much, like a
high Phelps, a hundred. Wow.

1312
01:10:36,651 --> 01:10:38,780
For like just like a shitty seat.
I don't know.

1313
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,860
A hundred but a hundred dollars
a says a lot. That is a lot.

1314
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,680
I always do that math in my
head. I'm like, you know,

1315
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:48,670
I was a young guy and like 30 bucks plus,
you know,

1316
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:51,230
of course you're going to get
drunk and then say that. Actually,

1317
01:10:51,231 --> 01:10:54,140
now that I'm thinking about it because
someone told me that, so let's find out.

1318
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:57,650
I bet you his tickets are. I
would, let's take bets on it.

1319
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,680
I would say you can get a
75 but you really looking
at a 125 to 50 right upfront

1320
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:05,390
the Ip. Wow. Okay.

1321
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:08,390
I would say I want to stick with
my guns and say a hundred bucks.

1322
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,980
I'll bet 20 bucks on it right
now. Oh, here we go. Friday

1323
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,870
at the Silver Creek events
center and four wins.

1324
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:22,860
New Buffalo, Buffalo, Michigan. Uh,

1325
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:25,800
the tickets are $98 50 cents.

1326
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:30,690
There's 14 tickets left.
I just want some money,

1327
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:35,160
but there are other ones.
The tickets go as high as 120 bucks.

1328
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:36,360
There you go.

1329
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:41,360
One of them is tickets are
from 216 bucks to 42 to 49 wow.

1330
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:47,220
Yeah. Some of his tickets are $249 in
new buffalo. You can downtown Diggle it.

1331
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:50,850
That's what you're trading for it.
Oh, he's at the Mirage in Vegas.

1332
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:55,020
The Terry Fator theater. I do that same
theater. I think I charged 40 bucks.

1333
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,460
Have you seen Terry Fator?

1334
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:02,370
I just can't imagine someone
charging $248 for a ticket.

1335
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,400
It says priced from,
let's see what tickets are available.

1336
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:08,940
I bet he's got some like stupid ones in
the front row that costs like ass. Fuck.

1337
01:12:08,941 --> 01:12:13,080
Tons of money Terry. Or
for J. For J. Yeah. Um,

1338
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,790
look at this shirt.
Okay.

1339
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,800
I'm going to give a filter
from two 50 to $1 million.

1340
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,670
The guys both had the exact same shirt
at the same comedy club almost. Who May,

1341
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,030
oh, look at that. Look Joe. There's, wow.

1342
01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:33,370
We don't look like the sound people at
all, dude. Look at you. Who are you?

1343
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:36,730
I was a also a Bollywood actor.
That's how you know who you look like.

1344
01:12:36,731 --> 01:12:38,200
You look like Don,
my rarest son.

1345
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:45,250
Look at me really trying to,
come on guys. Come on. Oh,

1346
01:12:45,251 --> 01:12:49,300
you remind me of someone else to
God damn that Hermon's father.

1347
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:52,900
I look like a coat hanger.
Look how

1348
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:55,310
my body looks so completely
out of proportion.

1349
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,670
I didn't lift any weights at all back
then. I just had this goofy frame.

1350
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:01,880
You look like your slain dick though
with that Tony Danza style. Yeah.

1351
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:06,750
You're looking at, you'll Cox's fuck. I
look sexy as fuck how much hair I had. Oh,

1352
01:13:06,751 --> 01:13:11,370
Gloria. It's funny how our shirts
district, it's funny how our shirts,

1353
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,980
our shirts make that
sign kind of relevant.

1354
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:19,650
Where your wacky magnum Pi Shit here guys,
this is the 90s right?

1355
01:13:19,651 --> 01:13:21,650
I don't think this has gotta
be the nine nineties yeah.

1356
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:27,160
If it was the 80s I would be like
rascals was a cray fucker. Where is that?

1357
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:31,020
Yeah. Rascal's comedy in
Jersey. Rascal's comedy hour.

1358
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:32,960
It is New York City.

1359
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,880
I guess the highest the tickets go
is two 50 that's the highest they go

1360
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:42,790
two 50 back at that club you could buy
a pretty much everybody in the room and

1361
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,560
drink.
If you could buy the comics,

1362
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,850
keep us 250 bucks.
You can have me for a couple of days.

1363
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,280
I know I'm not a,

1364
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:55,820
I know I'm not worth anything more than
what I'm getting right now. Like that.

1365
01:13:55,821 --> 01:14:00,270
These guys are like, you know, let's
push up to, I'm like gross. Yeah,

1366
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:04,270
I get that argument every six months.
We really should raise our prices. Like,

1367
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:07,430
nope, I can't do it. It's a lot of money.

1368
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,160
It's like it's always the venue that like,
you know,

1369
01:14:10,161 --> 01:14:12,070
well if you want to make something

1370
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:14,440
you got to raise it. I'm like,
well what happened from Latin?

1371
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:17,200
What'd you guys put in a pool?
I mean really what's going on here?

1372
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:19,770
This is also a problem in that like,

1373
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:22,990
you know the people that are
asking to raise the rates,

1374
01:14:23,230 --> 01:14:25,000
they're not connecting with the audience.

1375
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:28,720
They're just on the outside and they're
like, hey, you can get more out of that.

1376
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,720
I can get more out of that.
And that's like their objective is to,

1377
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:36,160
but your objective is to maintain
a good relationship and come back,

1378
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:37,750
come back to the club eventually.
Yeah.

1379
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,750
And you are one of the first guys
that I talked to a long time ago.

1380
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,900
We were talking about a Gig that was
getting offered to you and you're like,

1381
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:46,180
I can't go back there.
I was just there six months ago.

1382
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:50,440
I need to give them some new shit. I just
can't go back that quick. That's like,

1383
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:53,540
that's an important little piece
of integrity when it comes to a,

1384
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:56,470
the connection that you have with
an audience that a lot of agents,

1385
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:57,580
they don't understand that.

1386
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:01,060
They just understand that they see
there's money there to be made. Dave,

1387
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:04,870
there's a lot of gold in that whole
[inaudible] come on, we got buckets,

1388
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:08,860
rain and money and you're like, no, I
know these people. I think the more,

1389
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,360
I think like for me like a nice,
a nice resting.

1390
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:15,730
The fields would be 14 months,
14 months,

1391
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:18,470
and then like maybe give it
another six months. Yeah.

1392
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:22,470
I'm really afraid to go back too soon.
I really am afraid. You know, I like a,

1393
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:23,470
when I have it like um,

1394
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,640
it looks like I'm going to do my next
comedy special at the comedy works in

1395
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:30,550
Denver. That's what I'm planning
on doing. Fantastic. Yeah,

1396
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:33,190
the big room where the little room,
but that's a great one.

1397
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,110
I've got to figure out how to do it.

1398
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:38,940
And your idea with Gopros and the
audience is fucking brilliant. It's cool.

1399
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:41,640
I think I'm going to stick some
stuff on the ceiling, you know, and,

1400
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:44,280
and just keep the, I want to,
I want it to be packed on.

1401
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,710
I don't want any seats to
be missing because of the
cameras. You know, they could,

1402
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,140
that could just distract
you from the actual show.

1403
01:15:50,141 --> 01:15:54,820
I want us to be as non
distracting as possible. No
lighting. That's any different.

1404
01:15:54,821 --> 01:15:58,750
Everything exactly the same.
The Guy who did my special Scott,

1405
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:00,880
he was like the director and we both like,
you know,

1406
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:03,340
we both figuring out how to do it.
Like what's it like?

1407
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,490
I knew I didn't want it to look like
a theater show with the pans and the,

1408
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:09,500
and the booming all the boom shots.
So we,

1409
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,980
we did it over a little
cameras and then the Gopros,

1410
01:16:11,981 --> 01:16:14,920
which were like kind of cool because
we gave it to the audience so they were

1411
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:15,461
right there.

1412
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:18,790
So it gives you like the ultimate
like seat in the house by watching it.

1413
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:21,790
But I'm telling you,
dude,

1414
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,090
it's so cool because it really does
make me look like a better comic.

1415
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,220
It really does. It's
like, I'm like, whoa dude.

1416
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:28,990
That's like a Lenny
Bruce move right there.

1417
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:30,430
And it's really just
me doing my shitty act.

1418
01:16:30,431 --> 01:16:33,140
But it looks so much better on
the Gopro, you know? Well the,

1419
01:16:33,141 --> 01:16:37,210
the idea of doing it with the audience
holding up the cameras is fucking gene

1420
01:16:37,211 --> 01:16:39,700
banks, man. That's
good. Didn't you do, um,

1421
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,280
did you do skanks for the
memories in Denver? I did.

1422
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:45,610
Skanks there and I have to tell you that
that is one of the best audiences in

1423
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:49,600
the country. Clubs. The uh, the,
that is just a great, and you know,

1424
01:16:49,601 --> 01:16:53,170
now that weed is like super legal there.
I am dying to go back.

1425
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:57,190
I just want to see like, what is,
what's happening. I want to move there.

1426
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:01,700
I've been wanting to move back to Colorado
for a long time, man. I don't know. No,

1427
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,830
we lived through the show. Yeah. I only
lived there for a few months till my eye.

1428
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:09,010
My super sperm got to me
wife saying you made a baby.

1429
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,130
It's very high altitude.

1430
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,630
You can't live at high outs.
Who when you're pregnant
it's fucking real tough on,

1431
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:17,030
on the, on the lasses.
Okay. Very tough. Uh,

1432
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:20,300
but that club was fantastic when I was
living there just for the three months,

1433
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:23,120
four months, whatever it was that I
was there. It's fucking great club.

1434
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,230
They have real comics there.

1435
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,800
They have like local Denver
comics that are legit and they're,

1436
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:29,990
they're building talent and
that's Bob, you know, she,

1437
01:17:29,991 --> 01:17:31,310
she does it on a regular basis.

1438
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:33,230
Wendy is another is another,
uh,

1439
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,720
like I guess you could say
unsung heroes in comedy.

1440
01:17:35,721 --> 01:17:38,150
Cause like her club is
about the comics and like,

1441
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:42,110
even though even though like she doesn't
get as much attention as like some of

1442
01:17:42,111 --> 01:17:43,190
these other like bigger,

1443
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,620
she really is important and
she's built some great comic.

1444
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:47,590
Yeah, she has man, you know,

1445
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:51,730
she's been around for a long time and
she is responsible for the majority of

1446
01:17:51,731 --> 01:17:53,920
that scene.
Like those clubs,

1447
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:57,730
her system of open mics and getting
open mikes and then turning them into

1448
01:17:57,731 --> 01:18:01,000
features or turning them into MCS rather
than the features and then eventually

1449
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:02,970
the headliners. That's uh, you know,

1450
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:06,280
that's an important part of the
whole scene there in, in Denver

1451
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:09,090
and Denver. And now like I was just
have wise guys in Salt Lake City.

1452
01:18:09,091 --> 01:18:11,700
Have you been there? No I haven't,
but I know you would love this club.

1453
01:18:11,701 --> 01:18:15,900
It's a great club. It's uh,
it's, it was like, oh, it's
Mormon now they're drinking.

1454
01:18:15,901 --> 01:18:18,270
It's like the Jack Mormons are out there.
It's a great club.

1455
01:18:18,271 --> 01:18:20,280
I tell this to Chris Rock,
I'm like, you know, dude,

1456
01:18:20,281 --> 01:18:23,400
if you guys want to go and like work
on material, like these crowds are fun.

1457
01:18:23,401 --> 01:18:26,550
They get it. And it's so cool. Like when
you, when you play like a refreshing,

1458
01:18:26,551 --> 01:18:29,760
like every show was cool, you know,
every show I was trying new jokes.

1459
01:18:29,761 --> 01:18:30,594
It was great.

1460
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:33,630
Used to be that there was real
shit parts of the country.

1461
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,670
You would go there and you
go, oh, this spot sucks.

1462
01:18:35,671 --> 01:18:39,090
But that's way less now because the kids
that we're dealing with grew up with

1463
01:18:39,091 --> 01:18:41,040
the Internet. Right? Everywhere you go,

1464
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,740
you're going to get a certain amount
of people that get it. It's just,

1465
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:48,300
I think that's probably the
best indication of how much
different the world is.

1466
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:49,950
Our country is culturally.

1467
01:18:49,951 --> 01:18:53,940
Then it was like back in the 70s and the
eighties and the nineties without the

1468
01:18:53,941 --> 01:18:57,240
Internet. It's like you would go to
places where people didn't know shit,

1469
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:00,450
but anywhere you go now people
have an internet connection.

1470
01:19:00,451 --> 01:19:02,760
Kids are sharing information.
They're just more informed.

1471
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:04,860
They know good comedy too.

1472
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:07,440
Like they appreciate good Cami
and they'll come out to see you.

1473
01:19:07,441 --> 01:19:08,760
They'll come out and see
you everywhere you go.

1474
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,840
Well, I think, uh, you know, I think it's,

1475
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:14,100
there's so much other stuff
now that they're like,

1476
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:16,670
they're being inundated with just like,
you know,

1477
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,240
videos and clips and the apps and all
kinds of stuff that like, you know,

1478
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:23,870
really getting them off that is, is,
you know, I say it on every radio thing,

1479
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:26,540
it's just like, it's amazing when
they show up. It really is. It is.

1480
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:31,480
It's incredible. But it's, they're
just not the same Hicks. Oh, that,

1481
01:19:31,481 --> 01:19:34,250
that thing. Everybody's been
citified everybody's metro now.

1482
01:19:34,251 --> 01:19:37,250
There's an Einstein bagels and out
of Bama, I was used to say that.

1483
01:19:37,251 --> 01:19:41,210
It's like you got an Einstein
Bagel down here, you know,
and then, uh, you know, the,

1484
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,600
the places that do kind of stink now
are La and New York because those are

1485
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:48,950
become like, they're not even like urban
anymore. They're like international,

1486
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:50,830
like at the comedy cellar,
you know,

1487
01:19:50,831 --> 01:19:53,270
you'll be playing to people
who are from like, you know,

1488
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:56,780
Staten Island and also like countries
that you've only heard about on game of

1489
01:19:56,781 --> 01:20:01,190
Thrones, like just crazy
weird Transylvania, Stan, or
something like that, you know.

1490
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:03,200
And, uh, you know, in a
way it's kind of cool,

1491
01:20:03,201 --> 01:20:06,140
but in the way to show you that American
comedy, you know, people want to see it.

1492
01:20:06,141 --> 01:20:08,250
You know, they came over here. I
want to see what this is about.

1493
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:11,670
Well there's, it's very different
than comedy and other places. I mean,

1494
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:15,960
I know they don't have any full English
people like to talk shit about like that

1495
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:20,130
Guy Stewart Lee had a funny thing that
he was doing about a American comics and

1496
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:20,311
you know,

1497
01:20:20,311 --> 01:20:24,000
the American comics sort of been surpassed
by guys from England and Australia

1498
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:27,330
and I'm like, that's hilarious. It's
really cute. Good luck with all that.

1499
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,880
Really get the fuck Outta here.
Let's meet,

1500
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:33,930
let's meet halfway at the equator
and see how that works. Well,

1501
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:38,870
how about just go on after you at
the Improv, give it a shot. Uh,

1502
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,550
Doug, who is my guy of like, you
know, he goes to England for like,

1503
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:42,151
I don't know what it is.

1504
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:44,370
They haven't been a theater there for
like eight weeks or something like that.

1505
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,391
And he goes like,
you know,

1506
01:20:45,391 --> 01:20:48,210
it's amazing because these guys have
to have like a whole new hour to tour

1507
01:20:48,211 --> 01:20:50,580
through England every time.
And it's really like, you know,

1508
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:52,980
like they're so like they're
crowds there are pretty,

1509
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:55,890
are pretty cool with both po political
stuff and all that kinda stuff.

1510
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:57,630
But they're also incredibly judgmental.

1511
01:20:57,631 --> 01:21:00,150
Like they see it as like a theater show
or something like that. So, you know,

1512
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:02,280
it was like, Oh, who would want to
go through that grief, you know,

1513
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:07,710
just to be playing in Piccadilly circus.
But now like, you know, this French guy,

1514
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:11,360
that comedian, he's like this kind of like
racist guy, you know, he does the, uh,

1515
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,460
the Holocaust jokes. No. So that's
the guy that we have to go, like,

1516
01:21:14,461 --> 01:21:18,180
we have to meet at the Hague and I
do a to do a smack down with him.

1517
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:21,360
A French guy does holocaust
jokes. Yeah. Now in France,

1518
01:21:21,361 --> 01:21:24,270
like I guess in French you're not
supposed to talk about the Holocaust or

1519
01:21:24,271 --> 01:21:26,550
something like that. So he,
he makes a big deal about it,

1520
01:21:26,551 --> 01:21:29,250
about like freedom of speech.
And he, he's also half,

1521
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,720
half black or something like that.

1522
01:21:30,721 --> 01:21:33,360
So he talks about how like the
Moroccans are not treated well.

1523
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:36,260
I don't know the whole story,
but the whole idea is that like,

1524
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:38,880
he does these jokes and um,
you know,

1525
01:21:38,881 --> 01:21:42,540
like he's kind of like their renegade
comics. So, you know, we need to,

1526
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:45,210
we need to see, I want to hear them.
Once he brought Russell Peters,

1527
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:50,270
he's kind of like without the money
France to ban antisemetic comedian.

1528
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:55,230
Yeah. See, there you go. Is he funny?
Well, that's the first thing I said.

1529
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:57,810
And then I listened to some clips.
I'm like, well, it's not good.

1530
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:02,430
Well that's the problem. See if it was
really funny, really funny on the side.

1531
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:06,960
And George and George, I
worked, uh, I did Jersey shore,

1532
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:11,530
those Bob Gunzel gigs with auto and
George and I, you know, also did the, uh,

1533
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,190
I told you I did the
Dangerfield shows with him,

1534
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,470
but he had a meltdown one night
on stage. What are, you know,

1535
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:22,480
we was going off about
Oprah and Oprah Winfrey.

1536
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:27,780
I forget the fucking joke. I, I
don't don't remember it, but he,

1537
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:32,480
he went, it was gone on this rampage
about fucking her with his wedding cock,

1538
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:36,780
you know, these hung like
a paddle, a Kayak, paddle.

1539
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,200
And I mean just,

1540
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:42,870
just saying some horrible
racist but hall Larry to Shit,

1541
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:47,040
black people in the audience were fucking
crying, laughing. Everyone was crying,

1542
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:50,910
laughing. It was really racist but fucking
hilarious. If it's good, it's good.

1543
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:55,020
He was talking about someone and two
other people in the hot tub being like a

1544
01:22:55,021 --> 01:22:57,860
scene from gorillas and the minutes it,
I knew you were going to say it. What,

1545
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:01,170
what was the joke? Do you remember
the joke? Um, it could be,

1546
01:23:01,171 --> 01:23:04,020
it could be a cause that was like one
of those like long island standards,

1547
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,980
you know, like, uh, I just saw

1548
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,090
monster's ball. It looked like a scene
from gorillas in the mist or you know,

1549
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,630
right at this, you know, name
a black movie. And he's like,

1550
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:15,510
I dunno if I was watching
that or gorillas in the mist.

1551
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,031
Well,

1552
01:23:16,031 --> 01:23:19,210
he told me at one point in time I was
doing a Kennedy bit and he told me at one

1553
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:23,770
point in time it was trying to rig how to
make blood scored out of George's head.

1554
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:27,070
Yeah. Cause his wig would fall
back. It was brain would be exposed.

1555
01:23:27,071 --> 01:23:31,180
Do you remember that? He would do a bit,
we would throw George's head head back.

1556
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,460
That was his closer and, and you
would see his brains and like people,

1557
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:40,200
you could see people like going like
why did I eat if I was going to see the

1558
01:23:40,201 --> 01:23:42,240
brains of what he's
saying is the president.

1559
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:44,340
But I remember him coming
up to me afterwards.

1560
01:23:44,341 --> 01:23:45,690
I think it was like one of
the first time I met him.

1561
01:23:45,691 --> 01:23:49,560
It was right after his show and he and
the, he didn't smooth back the hair yet,

1562
01:23:49,561 --> 01:23:52,500
so it was like, hey, what's up auto?
How's it going man? I'm a huge fan.

1563
01:23:52,501 --> 01:23:53,740
Blah Blah Blah.
And the brains were like

1564
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:56,370
right there. So it was cool. I got
to see the whole like the whole,

1565
01:23:56,390 --> 01:24:01,270
ah pyrotechnic various,
yeah, could put it on.

1566
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:05,770
Let's hear some of that. Some of
it. Well, this is a later one. Yeah.

1567
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:10,930
Hey George, did you, uh, did
you see Brokeback mountain?
Yeah. What'd you think?

1568
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,760
Loved him or hated him? All right.
You don't need original title, et.

1569
01:24:15,761 --> 01:24:18,890
Al is off this Bullock testicles. Hi. No,

1570
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:25,240
four minutes.
And you're throwing a shadow here.

1571
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:28,440
Try and get me in this building
tomorrow, Jeff. Pat. Oh, okay. All right.

1572
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:34,450
George,
do you like playing travel manage sucks.

1573
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:37,900
I think to get on an airplane
sitting next to look cute girl.

1574
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:41,710
I'm always sitting next to some old guy
to wants to talk and I'll lay up. Ron,

1575
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:45,640
what are you going? Where am I going?
We'll get you a ticket. That's cool.

1576
01:24:45,641 --> 01:24:47,450
We're all guard.
Yeah.

1577
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:54,290
I like to sing your song
for Valentine's Day.

1578
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:57,620
This is the love song from the movie jaws.

1579
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:03,300
Suddenly I'm not half the man I the

1580
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,640
good crowd, right? Yeah. And
Sonny Bono's a good skier.

1581
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:16,400
I love George. George was a great movie.
Now that he authored, he's seen in joy's,

1582
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:20,160
this drunk girl.
Go swimming naked and John

1583
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,740

hear data and Todd on, ah,

1584

1585
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,830
Broadhead. Him. Yo Zack.
Yeah. Yeah. Zach. Hi.

Is Anybody here from New Jersey,
New Jersey?

1587
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:46,120
Kill yourself.
Polluted

1588
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:52,630
New Jersey is no New Jersey
where our farm is refreshing.

1589
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:57,690
You sleep. Oh, um,

1590
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:01,790
I wrote about Jersey. It's called
pollution. It's a poem. Go ahead.

1591
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:04,100
I an Arrow

1592
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,680
into the air.
It stuck

1593
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:16,040
and that's, that's on TV. Yeah, that'd be
super Watertown you want to see? Yeah. No,

1594
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:19,670
no, no, no. It's okay. I love those
classic setups. Like, you know,

1595
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,110
do a fly much. I love
this. Like everybody,

1596
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,300
it doesn't matter how they have
to do that kind of question.

1597
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:29,840
Some comics will get mad if other comics
do jokes about plane travel. Like, oh,

1598
01:26:29,841 --> 01:26:34,290
he does a joke about plane
travel. A hack. What year is this?

1599
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:37,460
This one's really all done.
You can it in 1988 I might not have seen.

1600
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:40,740
Okay,
that's lawn mowers.

1601
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:49,150
Cock suckers. They got real

1602
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:55,920
what years? This 1980 oh wow. Young.

1603
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:00,020
See that twilight zone
episode? Yeah. Shut it.

1604
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:03,500
It's my favorite show.
Yeah.

1605
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:08,040
I wonder why I met Rod Charlene lunch.
He had a huge cock.

1606
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:10,900
Would I browse on it?
Right?

1607
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:15,030
You like Porno Molly?
I need one.

1608
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:17,790
It's a fuck wit all puppets.

1609
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,710
It's called calendula bran and Holly.

1610
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:25,200
Miss piggy in this moly.
I

1611
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:30,870
got out of the areas.
I bought that bitch.

1612
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:38,260
Yeah. Don't you think he's
a nice audience? Yeah,

1613
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,930
I seem happy faces and firing squad.

1614
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:47,820
I drive the cab for a living here in
New York and she faster take hands.

1615
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:53,150
See if you recognize me.
Yeah.

1616
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:58,280
Oh, you want me to get my feet back in the
chair? I'm fucking swinging here. Sorry.

1617
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:04,300
All right. Make my ass look real.
Okay. We don't walk in a lotion.

1618
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:08,930
Go in here. All right.
Okay. How's your girlfriend?

1619
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:13,890
Oh, that slut. What do you call it,

1620
01:28:13,891 --> 01:28:16,240
ed for this browse a slot.
One time.

1621
01:28:16,241 --> 01:28:19,360
She spread her legs and
a Greyhound bus pay now.

1622
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:21,850
Okay.

1623
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:25,010
Do you imagine that killing
at pimps like this crazy hips?

1624
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:28,730
Remember pips never performed there.
Peaked in once instead of,

1625
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:31,820
let me get the fuck out of here.
Actually, I just smelled the devil.

1626
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:34,430
That is is a demonic presence in this.

1627
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,000
Joey Cola told me it was on Steve's
there and a guy flashing a gun. Yeah,

1628
01:28:38,001 --> 01:28:42,490
that was, that was Brooklyn. Brooklyn.
Yeah. He's on stage and some guy,

1629
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:45,560
the hipsters. Then he's gone.
He's gone. Fuck you. Fuck you.

1630
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:50,290
And he shows him his gun, pulls up his
shirt and showed him his gun. That was,

1631
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:54,650
that was the club that I think I got
to play one time and then I was like,

1632
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:55,191
you know,

1633
01:28:55,191 --> 01:28:58,670
it's such a long train ride from like
where I was living in Brooklyn too,

1634
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:02,190
but it was like such a long train
and like I was so bad compared

1635
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,980
to everybody else there.
I was like, man, like I,

1636
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:08,140
I felt like they would throw me a beaten
just being bad, like the Colombian.

1637
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:12,240
I'm like, how dare you? How dare you
young? No, no. It's gone. It's all gone.

1638
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:14,860
What about GRANDPA's on Staten Island?
So that's,

1639
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:18,660
I never played there. I don't think
I did. Maybe I did. I don't know,

1640
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:21,030
but I'll just say no,
I don't think that is.

1641
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:26,600
I did that place a long fucking time ago.
God Damn.

1642
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:29,720
There's so many of those little satellite
clubs in and around New York that were

1643
01:29:29,721 --> 01:29:30,554
great,

1644
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,190
but compared to Boston now,

1645
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:36,550
I just played the governor's recently
fuck fucking great. That's a great club.

1646
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,670
The guys who were on governor's
uh, you know, they, they really,

1647
01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:43,360
they really are another like, you
know, they're really cool about comedy.

1648
01:29:43,361 --> 01:29:45,910
They really want it to be like
what it was and like, you know,

1649
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:49,060
the audience has to come down and see it,
but they really are into like,

1650
01:29:49,061 --> 01:29:50,560
they got their own
radio thing going there.

1651
01:29:50,561 --> 01:29:53,320
They always trying to give like new
guys like a day, like, which is so cool.

1652
01:29:53,321 --> 01:29:57,070
They give a guy like, you
come in on a Wednesday, dude,
dude, do whatever you want.

1653
01:29:57,230 --> 01:30:00,160
Uh, Colin Quinn I think worked his
one man show out there for a bit.

1654
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:02,890
Is the brokerage still around the
brokerage, I think is where he did. Yeah.

1655
01:30:02,891 --> 01:30:05,620
That's a great club.
I think Ari just did that recently.

1656
01:30:05,621 --> 01:30:07,750
I think it is still around.
I got to see already on the road.

1657
01:30:07,751 --> 01:30:10,870
I want to see what that looks
like. Fucking, he's doing
great. Yeah. So nice to see.

1658
01:30:10,871 --> 01:30:13,750
You just got picked up. Awesome.
Yeah. He's got a college Rocco.

1659
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,060
Yeah. And I love how he, he did that show.

1660
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:19,430
He started out doing comedy nights,

1661
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:23,600
did nights like at the Improv or whatever
with the storytellers shows he'd do

1662
01:30:23,601 --> 01:30:26,060
the little room with the Improv. Then
he moved to the big room at the Improv.

1663
01:30:26,061 --> 01:30:28,730
Then he moved to comedy central online.
And now,

1664
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:32,900
I mean he likes develop this
thing from the seeds. So awesome.

1665
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:35,420
So cool to say man.
So cool to see.

1666
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:38,530
And that storytelling thing,
like his stuff, his stuff,

1667
01:30:38,531 --> 01:30:41,740
really rock sack cause we've talked
about it and like, uh, you know,

1668
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,750
it definitely is.

1669
01:30:43,751 --> 01:30:46,840
There's an audience for that and it's
cool that he's on top of that. You know,

1670
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:49,570
he's like the only guy I can think
of that really does it like that.

1671
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:53,440
Well it's a smart move and
it was his sort of idea,

1672
01:30:53,441 --> 01:30:56,350
I believe it was like to encourage
like that style of comedy,

1673
01:30:56,351 --> 01:30:57,370
like a storyteller style.

1674
01:30:57,371 --> 01:31:01,300
So it help his storytelling and also
just has like a creative exercise.

1675
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:04,510
You don't have guys go up and tell stories
and tell them instead of just telling

1676
01:31:04,511 --> 01:31:08,650
their act. I said, you know, it's a
great idea man. It's fucking great idea.

1677
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:13,360
It's um, it's just so cool to
comedy central's picking up. Yeah.

1678
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,040
It's so cool that they're smart,
you know,

1679
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,410
like I love that they picked up
your show too. It's a great idea.

1680
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:20,590
Like you're doing a new version of
the Rodney Dangerfield show mean it's

1681
01:31:20,591 --> 01:31:21,640
essentially very similar.

1682
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,360
I like to think it's more
Caroline's comedy. Yeah, no, it's,

1683
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:28,090
it's like it's a showcase
show and it wasn't my idea,

1684
01:31:28,091 --> 01:31:30,520
but it was definitely something
that I thought needed to be done,

1685
01:31:30,521 --> 01:31:34,330
especially if it's uncensored and uh,
thank you man. Yeah. What do you call it?

1686
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,580
It's called comedy on the ground.
It's at the village underground.

1687
01:31:36,581 --> 01:31:39,070
That's where we shoot it in New York City.
It's not underground comedy.

1688
01:31:39,071 --> 01:31:41,290
It's not like subversive mumble
core or anything like that.

1689
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:45,160
Cause we had like trouble with like
thinking of a good name for it, you know?

1690
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,530
Oh that's cool. The village undergrounds
downstairs to get to the set.

1691
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:52,400
This is downstairs. This is like
around the block from the seller.

1692
01:31:52,401 --> 01:31:55,640
It's also a lot of the same people are
involved in it. This is a great shot.

1693
01:31:55,641 --> 01:31:58,460
That was the first show Jay. Oh Kristin.
Have you seen him? He is amazing.

1694
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:03,250
I haven't had a chance to grade. Uh, he's
also great. Jermaine in jail. They really,

1695
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,670
everybody rocked out on the show. Oh this
is incredible. You see that's a club.

1696
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:09,220
That's real cool. We didn't build
that set. That's a real club.

1697
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:13,780
And a club is amazing. This looks
a lot like, uh, my special here,

1698
01:32:13,781 --> 01:32:17,050
which is like me on stage, you
know, in this club. And uh,

1699
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:21,150
I have to tell you that like, the
crowd got it right away and they, uh,

1700
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:23,110
really stepped up. So, you know,

1701
01:32:23,111 --> 01:32:26,350
let's hope there is a big crowd for this
kind of stuff. The uncensored club shut

1702
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:29,640
there is man there.
I guarantee there is just,

1703
01:32:29,641 --> 01:32:31,350
it's not like it stopped being good.

1704
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:35,130
It's just people stop having as
much access to it when you know,

1705
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:39,750
Kennison died and dice went away for a
little while and it's just like, you know,

1706
01:32:39,751 --> 01:32:44,570
there's, they just probably didn't know
where to get is that j and j is rocking.

1707
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:49,320
What a great club man. I mean, this,
of course Chris Rock's kind of dirty,

1708
01:32:49,321 --> 01:32:53,030
but he's also, he's too smart to just
be considered just a dirty comedian too.

1709
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:56,730
He wears the gloves like dice.
He looks like he's,

1710
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:00,000
he looks like he's like a given
them the uh, like, you know,

1711
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:04,380
you don't like the scared straight and
high school. I've done Tom don't myth.

1712
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:08,850
I know how to Cook Meth, don't do
it. But Jay is a great comic man.

1713
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,440
He really is like one of my
favorites and uh, you know,

1714
01:33:11,490 --> 01:33:14,280
I've talked with him a bunch. He's just,
he's just a pleasure all the way around.

1715
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:17,430
Club on this is on third
street in Manhattan.

1716
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:21,210
Third between McDougall and six ave.
How long has it been around for this club?

1717
01:33:21,211 --> 01:33:22,044
The village underground.

1718
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,810
They do plenty of shows there if you ever
want to do when they'd love to have it.

1719
01:33:24,811 --> 01:33:26,580
It's been around forever.

1720
01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:30,300
It's the black fat pussy cat is the bar
and then they have music there most of

1721
01:33:30,301 --> 01:33:33,790
the time. But they just started doing
comedy a couple of years back and she,

1722
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,260
I heard about them doing comedy
there before. See, this is all,

1723
01:33:37,261 --> 01:33:40,650
this is all the style, like of the
special where you see the audience,

1724
01:33:40,651 --> 01:33:42,330
but you all see the comic closeup.
There's no,

1725
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:46,950
there's no like shots for
no reason really. It's, it's
like it's all promoting it,

1726
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:50,460
moving it forward and uh, it
just makes, it looks way better.

1727
01:33:50,461 --> 01:33:52,350
And we had tons of Camden
problems on the show.

1728
01:33:52,351 --> 01:33:55,890
It took me forever to edit this stuff,
but it looks better. It looks way better.

1729
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:59,590
That's a, that's a
perfect stage. So perfect.

1730
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:01,750
I love the sign to that
old sign behind though.

1731
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,970
Yeah, no, they put that in there. The
underground thing. But other than that,

1732
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,910
that's the classic stage. You've seen it.
Yeah, I know. I told them that too. Idiot.

1733
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,070
He wanted to take it down. They didn't
want it. Why not now? Well, let's see.

1734
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:14,990
I Dunno.
Sign is awesome.

1735
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:17,360
I got to get out of my house
and have it in your house now.

1736
01:34:17,361 --> 01:34:18,860
That's always the thing,
like it's like, hey,

1737
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:20,540
you want it then I'm picking up the show.

1738
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:24,260
So did you guys make that
sign for the show? Oh they
did. Oh my God. It's perfect.

1739
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:28,580
It's cool. But it's fake
old. I don't know. I really,

1740
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:29,540
I knew that it fell off.

1741
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:34,690
They fake older. Did it still looks
bad. It's still does look bad ass.

1742
01:34:34,691 --> 01:34:36,340
But now that I know you
shouldn't have told me man.

1743
01:34:36,341 --> 01:34:39,220
It's like telling your kid Santa
Clause. Oh Dude, I'm sorry.

1744
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:44,220
All you know it's bright.
Wow. Wow. British brine.

1745
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:49,510
Who shut the fuck up. No, the
real look. Hit your head on it.

1746
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:54,750
Yeah, we had a, I had this
installed. You did rex.

1747
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:57,650
He didn't hear what's behind
the curtain over there

1748
01:34:58,290 --> 01:35:01,390
late or don't show you later.
The massage room,

1749
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:05,950
oranges and warm and the oil
up right now, you know, uh,

1750
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:09,950
that show the other ground, like this
week it's on late, like 1:00 AM Saturday,

1751
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:10,440
you know,

1752
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:13,370
running him Saturday and this week is
Ralphie may who we were talking about

1753
01:35:13,371 --> 01:35:17,420
earlier, April Macy and Lunelle.
Do you know Lunelle? No.

1754
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:22,310
Lunelle was in the bore at movie.
She's a 17, the bore out movie. Okay,

1755
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:23,990
well you know Hulu now lays right?

1756
01:35:24,110 --> 01:35:26,750
No, no, I've seen the boy, that movie I
haven't seen, I worked with turtle movie.

1757
01:35:26,751 --> 01:35:27,320
I haven't seen,

1758
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,560
I worked with her a bunch in San
Francisco and she is like so cool man.

1759
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:34,010
And you know, like that, that was cool to
get all this different styles, you know,

1760
01:35:34,011 --> 01:35:37,490
cause raw Ralphie's is super hardcore
headliner. I mean he, he's rock hard,

1761
01:35:37,491 --> 01:35:39,310
you know.
And April I've worked with a bunch too.

1762
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:42,260
She really knows how to throw in a joke
and Lunelle like takes it in a different

1763
01:35:42,261 --> 01:35:44,390
direction. So it was good to
give that balance. You know,

1764
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:47,300
how much time is everybody doing? About
four or five minutes. That was all part.

1765
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,930
I said cut me down.
So yeah,

1766
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,080
I said cut me down because I want
them to do their solid acts, you know,

1767
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:57,620
four or five minutes and they would
roll out 1250 minutes. So it was all

1768
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,080
well yeah,
the network wanted to do it and I said,

1769
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:05,080
I just let me take a look at it,
you know, if I will look at it,

1770
01:36:05,081 --> 01:36:09,470
it'd be a little bit smoother than if
the network did it let you edit it? Yeah,

1771
01:36:09,471 --> 01:36:11,850
they, they eventually I
jumped in on it. Right.

1772
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:14,370
Well that's cool that they're
lending. You edit it, you know,

1773
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,240
the more power they give you,
the more control over it.
You obsess about shit man.

1774
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:22,440
I really do. I remember when we did that
porn show together. You, you uh, I was,

1775
01:36:22,441 --> 01:36:26,190
couldn't believe how much you obsessing
like the various aspects of what worked

1776
01:36:26,191 --> 01:36:29,190
and what didn't work. What, what's
the next scene we should watch?

1777
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:33,200
He had notes and notes and notes.
I figured it was a show you just show up.

1778
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:38,520
No, we, we really wanted it. I
wanted it to be so like tribute show.

1779
01:36:38,521 --> 01:36:42,360
Funny show. I mean it was
unscripted, but you're right.

1780
01:36:42,361 --> 01:36:45,210
We were obsessing because we
did all this prep work on like,

1781
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:48,900
well this movie was an important movie
for our star and this one was like a

1782
01:36:48,901 --> 01:36:51,960
movie. They direct it. So we were
trying to tell like this half ass story.

1783
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,350
But you're right. I obsessed. I take all
the fun out of every fucking thing I do.

1784
01:36:55,430 --> 01:37:00,050
It's not the fun out of it. You just
have a great connection to your work.

1785
01:37:00,051 --> 01:37:02,000
You know you really want it
to come out good. Which is,

1786
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:03,890
thanks for saying that
man is so important, man.

1787
01:37:03,891 --> 01:37:07,760
It's a very inspiring because it's very
uninspiring when you're around someone

1788
01:37:07,761 --> 01:37:11,330
who doesn't, right. It doesn't give a
shit. It doesn't mean anything to them.

1789
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:14,630
So when I see a guy like you with a
big stack of ruffled notes and you're

1790
01:37:14,631 --> 01:37:18,500
fucking riding on this and you've
got producers coming over and giving

1791
01:37:18,501 --> 01:37:20,660
suggestions and you're trying to
piece together, I'm like, wow,

1792
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:24,920
this is like way more.
It was not just way more effort,

1793
01:37:24,921 --> 01:37:29,150
but the like your intent
was really kind of noble.

1794
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:32,600
Like you really were trying to respect
these people and pay tribute to them.

1795
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:35,560
Like when you had like a Ginger Lynn on.

1796
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:39,950
That was one of my favorite episodes. You
and ginger. That was fun. It really was.

1797
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:44,100
Yeah. I've known her from the comedy
store days from way back in the day.

1798
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:47,490
I said very nice, very nice person.
So always been a very nice person.

1799
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:49,410
She's a sweetheart and,
and you know,

1800
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:52,740
I wish that show was still going cause
that was definitely one of the funnest

1801
01:37:52,741 --> 01:37:54,900
things I've ever done. And I
really do feel like, you know,

1802
01:37:54,901 --> 01:37:55,980
when say like you're obsessing

1803
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:56,880
and stuff like that,
it's like,

1804
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:00,780
it usually takes any show about
a season to figure itself out.

1805
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:02,760
Maybe not so much now because I,

1806
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:06,510
I guess like people are
better at television or
something like that. But like,

1807
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,890
you know, even when you're the guy who
comes up with the idea and like, ah,

1808
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:13,500
I can't with that, I deal with Stuart
Bailey who was a great dude and like we,

1809
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:16,200
even though we,
we thought it out and we got it,

1810
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:19,950
we got it together and all that
kind of stuff, you still don't know.

1811
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:20,821
You still don't know.

1812
01:38:20,821 --> 01:38:24,600
And that's why like editing
is so important and like
learning from your mistakes

1813
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:28,170
and like trying to make it better every
week. And I think that a lot of that is,

1814
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:31,500
that is kind of like gone on the wayside
now because people are just pumping up

1815
01:38:31,501 --> 01:38:32,334
product.

1816
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:36,720
Yeah, no, I think you're right.
I think it's just, well the,

1817
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:39,570
the idea that you came up with
to just a fucking great idea.

1818
01:38:39,571 --> 01:38:41,550
The floating couch over
the dicks and stuff.

1819
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:44,990
Yeah, no. And all that stuff was just
like, edit in the editing room, hey,

1820
01:38:44,991 --> 01:38:47,030
let's try this. Let's try
it. You know, like whatever,

1821
01:38:47,031 --> 01:38:49,820
like Reese's peanut butter
cup, you try this, I'll try
it. You know? And then like,

1822
01:38:49,821 --> 01:38:52,700
it just happened and it was so good.
It was so good that we're like,

1823
01:38:52,701 --> 01:38:54,650
can we do that again and
like you can't afford it.

1824
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:58,670
That was the whole thing about editing
and doing it on your own budget.

1825
01:38:58,671 --> 01:39:01,310
It really is like how much can I afford,
you know?

1826
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:05,710
Yeah, no, it's a, so I have to learn
how to edit, why they stopped doing it.

1827
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,890
They didn't want another season.
I Dunno. And I have great tapes.

1828
01:39:08,891 --> 01:39:12,760
I have auto and George on there. I
have Doug, Stan hope I have a j more.

1829
01:39:12,761 --> 01:39:16,380
I have like all these great people who
like did not get a chance to get on there.

1830
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:20,050
I've David Allen career. I have a,
just all these great comics, you know.

1831
01:39:20,350 --> 01:39:23,380
You mean you have them on film that
you did it with? Yeah. Oh my God,

1832
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:28,930
I can't, no, not toward that.
Your apartment got broken
into and all got online.

1833
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:33,880
Okay. That's what I heard. Okay. I'll
thank you. Yes. Did you know that?

1834
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:38,500
I didn't know that it's going to be on
bitcoin and a couple of days I've heard.

1835
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:43,360
Okay. All right. We're Vimeo.
Yeah, we can. Uh, that's,
is that how you drop it now?

1836
01:39:43,450 --> 01:39:45,490
Okay. That's what I heard. No,

1837
01:39:45,491 --> 01:39:49,540
it's until I own the rights again until
I own the rights again. It really is a,

1838
01:39:49,541 --> 01:39:52,330
you know, uh, it's kind of like
one of those things where like,

1839
01:39:52,510 --> 01:39:55,540
I really don't know what you know,
what to say cause there are fans of it,

1840
01:39:55,541 --> 01:39:58,090
you know, they're like, when are we going
to see this? When are we going to so,

1841
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:01,690
but right now I'm just so glad not
to be editing, so that's great.

1842
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:05,040
I'm sure.
I'm sure it's relief.

1843
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:08,230
Have you ever like had to like do that
kind of thing where you do the post

1844
01:40:08,231 --> 01:40:09,430
production on a project too?

1845
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:11,100
Yes. Yeah. It's not that fun.

1846
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:13,740
What project would it be like a
special Rogan questions. Everything.

1847
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:16,560
I did a little bit on that. There you
go. Right. Never on a comedy special.

1848
01:40:16,561 --> 01:40:18,840
I mean of obviously edited
my specials special,

1849
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:21,240
which is another form of torture
by the way, looking at yourself.

1850
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:23,100
It's not that it's not good for your head.

1851
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:26,050
It's definitely isn't because I
don't like watching myself, but I'll,

1852
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:29,520
I don't mind listening to myself
if I'm working on new material,

1853
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:32,820
but if you watch yourself too much, you
listen to yourself too much and be like,

1854
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:36,160
oh, like, oh, like you don't
want to watch this anymore.

1855
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:39,450
You don't like yourself anymore and you
don't want to hear the same jokes coming

1856
01:40:39,451 --> 01:40:41,700
out of your own mouth over. No.
It's one thing if you get talent,

1857
01:40:41,701 --> 01:40:43,050
but another thing if
you watch them as well.

1858
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:45,710
Yeah, like all my bad
habits, I can see all that.

1859
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:50,390
Like even when you're showing the old
clip of me as a boy, Davey, it's l,

1860
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,720
I was like, oh, look at that. Look
at the bad there before smoking.

1861
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:00,930
Yeah, no, it's so true. I
think that it's good though.

1862
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,140
It's good to see those bad things.
He kind of tightens up your act.

1863
01:41:04,170 --> 01:41:06,660
It tightens up my act when I don't
like it. You know what I don't like.

1864
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:10,380
It forces me to like cut out the fat,
pick up the pace,

1865
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:13,860
put a little more juice into this. Little
more writing into that a little more.

1866
01:41:13,861 --> 01:41:17,340
You know,
it's all the whole process I think is um,

1867
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:21,900
the review part of it is a big part of it
for creating new stuff. And if I don't,

1868
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:24,270
I mean I don't do it just because I
don't like it because it makes you

1869
01:41:24,271 --> 01:41:26,580
uncomfortable to watch myself or
listen to myself, which by the way,

1870
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:27,960
almost every comic I know feels the same.

1871
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,450
Really. Okay, good. Cause I,

1872
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:32,890
I've seen guys laugh at their own tapes
and I'm like how did he do that? Who are,

1873
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:36,000
they must have been raised right
that you really love yourself.

1874
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:39,290
Why are those fucking Weirdos never that.

1875
01:41:39,291 --> 01:41:41,400
I've seen a guy like he's watching
himself on TV and he's like, ah

1876
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:44,810
yeah, good. That's good. And
if he is good, he's annoying.

1877
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:47,630
He's one of those guys could onstage
but annoying as fuck off stage.

1878
01:41:47,631 --> 01:41:51,070
Like wants to tell you about
his new bits all the time. Oh,

1879
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:52,970
if you want to try them out on you site,

1880
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:54,560
tell me if you think
there's something in this.

1881
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:57,230
The other day I see this and you're like,
oh my God,

1882
01:41:57,231 --> 01:41:59,870
you're going to do your fucking material
on me. What are you doing? Oh Wow.

1883
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:02,360
You ever have that? Yup. Yeah,
and they think it's hilarious.

1884
01:42:02,361 --> 01:42:03,290
They'll listen to our own shit.

1885
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,110
Yeah.
Like if it's a long bit,

1886
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:08,490
they'll show you the notes,
listen to shit. I'm working
on it. Look at this. Oh Wow.

1887
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:12,040
Now the only time I bring up
a bit of that go like, do you,

1888
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:15,850
do you have a joke like this or do you,
it's called Joe checking.

1889
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:18,610
But other than that, like you know,
like there's some guys like Mike,

1890
01:42:18,611 --> 01:42:21,220
Vicky on these great joke
writer. I'll be like, ah, okay,

1891
01:42:21,221 --> 01:42:23,350
let's work on it and let's
work on some jokes, you know?

1892
01:42:23,351 --> 01:42:25,330
And then like we'll just go
spit ball back and forth.

1893
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:28,780
Yeah, joke checking is very
important because sometimes
you'll, you go, God damn,

1894
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:33,190
this joke seems too easy.
So many I'm on Youtube helped me out.

1895
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:36,410
Or on Twitter rather,
I was talking about this new,

1896
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:41,200
I have this new bid and in the bit there's
a thing about milk substitutes like

1897
01:42:41,201 --> 01:42:44,380
almond milk and you know, and I said
Amazon of tits, that's not milk.

1898
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,640
But apparently Lewis Black and already
had almost the same joke with soy.

1899
01:42:48,990 --> 01:42:53,680
It was last time he saw soy tits, you
know, it's not milk, it's, it was there.

1900
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:58,480
I didn't see it quick enough. He saw
it first, so I got checked by Twitter.

1901
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:00,730
That's cool. Nice. Yeah, it's very cool.

1902
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:04,790
And that's cool that the fans helped you
out on that because, uh, you know, I,

1903
01:43:04,791 --> 01:43:08,050
I do think that like due diligence, you
know, and you can't, you can't like,

1904
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,760
you know, sometimes, you know, whatever.

1905
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:10,170
Well,

1906
01:43:10,170 --> 01:43:14,610
one of those things like that's something
that if you gave that subject to 100

1907
01:43:14,611 --> 01:43:19,170
guys and said, hey, uh, what do
you think about milk substitutes?

1908
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:23,030
10 of them are going to say, you
know, Ahmond's don't have tits. Right?

1909
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,290
They're just going to think,
well, what's their milk? Okay.

1910
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,270
Windmill comfort comes from nipples.
Nipples was kind of funny.

1911
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:29,750
Almonds have nipples with the fuck
are you talking about? And that's,

1912
01:43:29,751 --> 01:43:32,310
it's right there. It's like,
here's, follow the normal neck.

1913
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:35,150
Exactly. It's like water going.
It's going to go to, it's low.

1914
01:43:35,151 --> 01:43:37,790
It's where it belongs.
That's where that joke belong.

1915
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:41,710
It's a parallel thinking.
It's like it's going to happen with that.

1916
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:44,680
What's something along those lines
or you know, fill in the blank.

1917
01:43:44,681 --> 01:43:49,060
There's always a, remember those metal
alert. I'm, I've fallen, I can't get up.

1918
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:51,910
You remember that they had a commercial?
Do you remember that commercial?

1919
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:54,620
There was a, a metal alert
was a thing that an old lady,

1920
01:43:54,621 --> 01:43:57,890
they would fall down and they press a
button and they would go and they would

1921
01:43:57,891 --> 01:44:02,130
yell into it. It was like a little walkie
talkie. I've fallen and I can't. Yeah.

1922
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:07,160
And I can't get up jokes. Where
Dad was, that was a monster.

1923
01:44:07,161 --> 01:44:11,000
You had to have an, I can't get
up joke like every comic in 1988,

1924
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:13,400
1989 had a fallen and
I can't get up choke.

1925
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:15,260
It became hack within like six months.

1926
01:44:15,261 --> 01:44:17,960
Like Tinder now are
people that Tinder jokes.

1927
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:21,480
Everyone has a Tinder joke and then
it's like all these new apps. Yeah.

1928
01:44:21,481 --> 01:44:22,314
Joke jokes.

1929
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:22,941
I think,

1930
01:44:22,941 --> 01:44:26,420
I don't even know if I just heard this
recently come out of my own mouth. No,

1931
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,280
it was, uh, the woman from
the iPhone I can't get up,

1932
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:32,620
was also the woman from the clapper. And
I think this is someone else's joke. I,

1933
01:44:32,621 --> 01:44:34,220
it's like this lady can't get a break.

1934
01:44:34,690 --> 01:44:39,080
And I know somebody said that and
I was like, ah. I was like, wow,

1935
01:44:39,081 --> 01:44:41,870
I didn't know both things were
still in play, you know, clapper.

1936
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,610
Well it was one of those things
where comics would have to, uh,

1937
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:48,660
they would have to like get onstage
first because they wanted to be the first

1938
01:44:48,661 --> 01:44:48,961
guy to do,

1939
01:44:48,961 --> 01:44:51,960
I've fallen and I can't get up joke
because you didn't want to be the middle.

1940
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:54,270
You have to open or did the I've
fallen and I can't get up joke.

1941
01:44:54,271 --> 01:44:55,560
Then he can't tell you big closer.

1942
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:59,180
Well that's the thing about headlining
when you're, when you realize that like,

1943
01:44:59,181 --> 01:45:01,430
you know, the sweet spot on
the show is always the middle.

1944
01:45:01,431 --> 01:45:03,980
The opener has it rough and you
have it rough. But the Middle Guy,

1945
01:45:03,981 --> 01:45:08,660
like he can roll through 50
premises and leave you with nothing,

1946
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:09,950
you know, and then you're like, wow,

1947
01:45:09,951 --> 01:45:14,030
now nowadays a job and you've got the
check spot. And that's, that's the thing,

1948
01:45:14,031 --> 01:45:17,150
like with the middle of walk off stage,
it's like, yeah, they were good. I'm like,

1949
01:45:17,151 --> 01:45:19,870
yeah, of course they were. That
was like fishing, you know,

1950
01:45:19,871 --> 01:45:22,850
that was like fishing forever over
up there. I mean like, you know,

1951
01:45:22,851 --> 01:45:25,460
there was no like a, you don't
need a license, you know,

1952
01:45:25,461 --> 01:45:28,800
you can just put the nets in and they're
jumping in the boat and this is how you

1953
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:29,643
left me.
Nothing.

1954
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:32,920
Well, the opener is definitely
the hardest spot. Oh, absolutely.

1955
01:45:32,921 --> 01:45:35,790
Especially the first 10 minutes.
Can you get everybody rolling? Yeah.

1956
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:38,710
You've got to come out of the gate strong.
You got us to end.

1957
01:45:38,711 --> 01:45:40,300
You can't be too needy out of the gate.

1958
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:44,650
You got to like establish control of the
stage and then get everybody into the

1959
01:45:44,651 --> 01:45:46,540
trance and get them all laughing.

1960
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:51,190
Well, I was like, you know, a energy
open. Like I use it, the energy.

1961
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,650
I think that's cool.
And then, uh, you know,

1962
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:57,370
they should do a couple of jokes of that.
People know it's not a rally, you know.

1963
01:45:57,930 --> 01:46:01,470
Yeah. That would be a nice
thing. That would be a nice idea.

1964
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:06,920
Rally. Is there a, I thought we were
looking at the clapper commercial.

1965
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:11,230
Oh No, no. We can pull it up if you want
pictures of you from back in the day.

1966
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:15,580
I'll get that. Get that ugly,
disgusting. Get it off please. Oh,

1967
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:20,650
do you like living in New York? I hate
it. Do you really? Oh No, I live in,

1968
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:23,130
in New York.
I liked New York over La.

1969
01:46:23,131 --> 01:46:26,640
I guess just because I'm not a big
driver or whatever, but, uh, you know,

1970
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:31,320
take subways. What do you do?
I take a cab. I like to, uh,

1971
01:46:31,950 --> 01:46:34,080
rent a bike. I don't know if
going to, I don't think that

1972
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:41,510
wind power. I never, I feel like I
had never lived anywhere. You know,

1973
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:44,910
I always felt like, you know, I
live in New York, uh, you know,

1974
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,950
family stuff and all that kind
of stuff there and all that.

1975
01:46:46,951 --> 01:46:50,610
And then I go out to la for work, but
I, I really do feel that like, you know,

1976
01:46:50,611 --> 01:46:54,570
it's cool. It'll be cool to
have like the third location,

1977
01:46:54,571 --> 01:46:57,680
like a Costa Rica or something like
that. You know, these comments.

1978
01:46:57,681 --> 01:47:00,210
Do you have like a two weeks? Like they
go to Italy or something like that?

1979
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:01,140
I mean it's really cool.

1980
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:04,850
Yeah, I would like to do that too. Where
would you pick? What would be your answer?

1981
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:09,540
Locate Alaska. Really? Wow.
Go to fucking anchorage.

1982
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:13,680
Get a fat spread outside of
Anchorage and life below zero.

1983
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:18,530
But during the summer, well dude, it's
first of all, it's light out all day.

1984
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:20,850
I know I've been, doesn't get dark
at two o'clock in the morning.

1985
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:24,300
It's light out your, I'm walking around.
It's light out. People are cool as fuck.

1986
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,940
And if you want it to be a place where
you could hang out in the summer,

1987
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:31,020
like a retreat, it's the best spot. He
couldn't come up with a better spot. Yeah,

1988
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:36,510
it's beautiful up there. Oh, it's fucking,
it's glorious. Anchorage is glorious.

1989
01:47:36,511 --> 01:47:38,580
I can't wait to get back there.
I've got to schedule another gig.

1990
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:40,380
I was there in July.
Yeah.

1991
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:42,650
I'm thinking to do a new year's
next year there to show cute.

1992
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:46,920
Charlie's flying in on January.
Just come in guns blazing.

1993
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:51,120
Fuck it. I love that breeze
below zero. It gives a shit.

1994
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:56,910
No sunlight ever fall. Gay heads,
guns blazing and dot, dot, dot, dot,

1995
01:47:56,911 --> 01:48:01,140
dot. That is a good crowd. Practice.
Archery during the day. Do shows at night.

1996
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:04,920
That's the second archery reference
you've made to catch a fish with spears.

1997
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:05,933
Really?
The second one?

1998
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:09,750
No. In the beginning we were talking
about our, and I was wondering, do you,

1999
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:10,643
do you do archery?

2000
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,560
Yeah. Yeah, but I've been doing it for
a little while now for a few months.

2001
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,020
Like we doing it,
I guess about a year now

2002
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:19,280
because I was just added sporting good
store and like I was saying it at the

2003
01:48:19,281 --> 01:48:21,590
club, I got like, you
know, they'll lock up guns,

2004
01:48:21,591 --> 01:48:26,090
but like Boeing Arrows go free range,
free range. It's like, you know, like,

2005
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,940
you know, you bring in the Daddy,
bring your daughter in. Like, Hey,

2006
01:48:28,941 --> 01:48:32,030
you wanna play hunger games. Yeah. Get
grab a bone out like did just out there,

2007
01:48:32,031 --> 01:48:35,840
you know, I think that's cool. And
they've got like some super cool Bose now,

2008
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:36,460
you know.

2009
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:39,240
Oh that's what I said earlier. I was
talking about the archery range in the,

2010
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:44,240
in the um, the club studio.
Yeah. You could go to a place
to place. I went to, um,

2011
01:48:44,410 --> 01:48:47,950
well there's a great place in, in
Springfield, Oregon called the bow rack.

2012
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:51,670
This guy's got this insane set
up and he tunes all my bows.

2013
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:53,740
He tunes him up and then
send them down to me.

2014
01:48:53,741 --> 01:48:57,340
But he's got an indoor range that also
has some sort of a pull that up because

2015
01:48:57,341 --> 01:49:02,080
it's kind of crazy. It's like a three
d range where, uh, it's a video.

2016
01:49:02,081 --> 01:49:05,040
The video pops up and you
shoot arrows at and shit

2017
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:08,900
rack in Springfield, Oregon. But uh,

2018
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:12,640
I buy my hours from that guy to
and from a hunter's friend.com.

2019
01:49:12,641 --> 01:49:17,530
I buy them from them. They make arrows
for you cause you gotta like arrows.

2020
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:20,080
They get fucked up.
Some of them snap.

2021
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:23,580
I should sometimes you shoot an arrow
into another hour when they explode your

2022
01:49:23,581 --> 01:49:26,200
Robin Hood. Um, otherwise,
uh, you know, they'll,

2023
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:30,370
they'll go through the target and hit
the metal post behind a target shatter.

2024
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:34,300
Wow. Yeah. If you miss and hit a rock,
they're doomed. Oh, this is cool.

2025
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:37,180
Is this going on right now? Is
this what it is? What is this?

2026
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:41,860
She says archery three d range. No, no,
no. Go to the bow rack. In Springfield,

2027
01:49:41,861 --> 01:49:42,670
Oregon,

2028
01:49:42,670 --> 01:49:45,940
they have a website and on the website
they have a description of this whole

2029
01:49:45,941 --> 01:49:49,570
thing that they do where I don't know
how they do it as some sort of a game.

2030
01:49:49,571 --> 01:49:51,940
And you shoot bows and arrows.
If these moving targets,

2031
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:55,900
like a big screen that you would like
shoot bows and arrows out like a video

2032
01:49:55,901 --> 01:49:57,460
game.
I don't know how it works.

2033
01:49:57,630 --> 01:50:00,990
Oh, I wonder if like, you know everyone of
these movies, you see the flaming arrow.

2034
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:03,330
Yeah. I wonder if that
like really like, oh,

2035
01:50:03,331 --> 01:50:05,880
it's got to be some kind of like tar
or something they put on it. Right.

2036
01:50:05,881 --> 01:50:09,420
It can't just be like, you know, he
put some rags on that shit. I mean,

2037
01:50:09,421 --> 01:50:14,010
it's all you'd have to, that'd be
the worst. Like when you see those,

2038
01:50:14,070 --> 01:50:18,600
like in the movies, the dragon
breath, whatever is going to do it.

2039
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,570
Yeah. I mean like, you know, it seems
to work in the movies all the time,

2040
01:50:21,571 --> 01:50:25,350
but I don't remember me and
my kid, my friends, his kids
like trying to do that. So

2041
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:29,090
yeah, find the, uh, it's, it's in there
somewhere. Find it on the website, not,

2042
01:50:29,091 --> 01:50:32,510
don't look under videos, look under
like, um, whatever the fuck it is.

2043
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:36,590
You'll find it. You're smart. I know
you, you could do a kid, but uh,

2044
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:39,470
it's uh, it's a fun way to
clear your head. You ever do it?

2045
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:41,340
But when I'm like in the scouts,

2046
01:50:41,341 --> 01:50:44,480
maybe that would be a cool thing
to know how to do really well. Like

2047
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:49,040
bow and Arrow, like, yeah, well it's fun.
It's like while you're doing it, you know,

2048
01:50:49,041 --> 01:50:52,340
trying to just locate that target
and put an Arrow in the target.

2049
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:53,990
It's really odd.
Like,

2050
01:50:53,991 --> 01:50:57,830
it frees your mind and I think it probably
connects us with like some fucking

2051
01:50:58,130 --> 01:51:02,810
ancient Janick memory of, you know, bows
and arrows, like taking out animals.

2052
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:07,390
What is the yard like? Yardage of like a
football field. Can you kill something?

2053
01:51:07,391 --> 01:51:07,700
And if,
okay,

2054
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:08,511
well if you could,

2055
01:51:08,511 --> 01:51:13,511
but it wouldn't be ethical because the
idea of you hitting it is not so good.

2056
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:15,500
I understand. But I'm saying like, what's,

2057
01:51:15,501 --> 01:51:18,150
what's the range on a bone
are like know slingshot.

2058
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:20,620
They usually say like 50
feet, whatever. No fee.

2059
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:21,600
Well,
okay.

2060
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:25,860
I know of a guy who killed a deer
at 140 yards with a bow and arrow.

2061
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:30,770
Yeah. He's just this crazy
archer. And this was, uh,

2062
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:35,900
at this place, and I forget the,
forget the name of the, uh, the, uh,

2063
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:40,440
archery pro shop and Orange County where
this guy works out of, I'll find it,

2064
01:51:40,580 --> 01:51:45,510
but that could, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a,
he's a real professional archer. And, uh,

2065
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:48,160
it's like one of his pet tricks
is that he can kill a deer,

2066
01:51:48,190 --> 01:51:50,160
like over a hundred yards,
which is very rare.

2067
01:51:50,490 --> 01:51:54,150
Most shots you make if you're going
to shoot a deer is like 20 yards.

2068
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:56,730
40 yards is a fairly long shot.

2069
01:51:56,731 --> 01:51:59,610
Like there's a big difference
between 20 and 40 yards with a rifle.

2070
01:51:59,611 --> 01:52:03,840
It's nothing with a rifle. 40 yards
is, is an easy shot. But with a bow,

2071
01:52:03,870 --> 01:52:04,703
it's very hard.

2072
01:52:04,730 --> 01:52:07,340
I figured. And what about
that? Always that one shot.

2073
01:52:07,341 --> 01:52:10,070
You've seen every movie where they get
it through their calf and now they're

2074
01:52:10,071 --> 01:52:14,450
limping. That's like every movie. This.
I was like, oh, I got it in my calf.

2075
01:52:14,570 --> 01:52:15,380
Rip It out.

2076
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:19,470
The reality is it would blow right through
your leg. Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah.

2077
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:23,660
It blows through Alex. Like if you,
uh, like my friend Cameron Hanes,

2078
01:52:23,661 --> 01:52:25,280
he's this famous bow hunter that's a,

2079
01:52:25,281 --> 01:52:29,130
you saw the picture of him in the front
of that aside as he's pulling it up, he,

2080
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:33,260
he blows holes through elk, like
a 1200 pound elk. Well, shoot,

2081
01:52:33,261 --> 01:52:36,680
the Arrow goes right through their body.
They call it a pass through. And what's,

2082
01:52:36,681 --> 01:52:39,060
what's the, what's the arrowhead
like what is the blade?

2083
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:43,010
It's a series of three razor blades.
Like shit three. Yeah, they're,

2084
01:52:43,011 --> 01:52:46,350
they're called broadhead blades and
there's three of them and there they're

2085
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:49,160
attached to this steel tip and they
just cut right through the animals

2086
01:52:49,390 --> 01:52:51,490
go through like a,
would it go through armor?

2087
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:56,110
No, no. Okay. No, no, that's, it
wouldn't, it would go through, you know,

2088
01:52:56,111 --> 01:53:00,290
a sheet of metal. Oh, newt. A thin
sheet of metal that is a cold.

2089
01:53:00,310 --> 01:53:05,170
How far away it is. Yeah. Well it's
a, it's a very challenging way,

2090
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:08,090
uh, to try to acquire your meat
if that's what you wanted to do.

2091
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:09,460
You wanted to just be a guy who was just,

2092
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:11,740
especially if you use like
an old school recurve bow,

2093
01:53:11,741 --> 01:53:15,320
there's dudes out there that hunt with
old school, like you know, no sites,

2094
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:19,030
just a long bow and they're shooting
arrows into animals and that's where they

2095
01:53:19,031 --> 01:53:21,910
get all their meat from. It's
pretty fucking caveman of, yeah,

2096
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:25,780
that's, that's, that's the real deal.
I mean, maybe that's your next show,

2097
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:29,530
maybe the crossbow that's like that.
The kind of suburban guys, you know,

2098
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:30,880
what's it a little easier?

2099
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:34,240
There's a lot of complaints about cross
paths because they're allowing people to

2100
01:53:34,241 --> 01:53:38,320
hunt with crossbows now doing archery
season in Wisconsin, it's a big,

2101
01:53:38,321 --> 01:53:42,430
a big point of contention because the
regular archer's know how difficult it is

2102
01:53:42,431 --> 01:53:44,770
to get good with a bow and
Arrow with a cross ball.

2103
01:53:44,771 --> 01:53:48,190
All you have to do is point that bitch
look on the site. Yeah. It's very similar.

2104
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:52,350
Well, the walking dead thing, like
revitalize that whole love affair. Yeah.

2105
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:57,100
Everybody gets excited about
Darryl's crossbow. Yeah.

2106
01:53:57,900 --> 01:54:01,560
Yeah. The walking dead. I can't believe
how good that show got this season.

2107
01:54:01,561 --> 01:54:04,050
I thought it was going to die. I
thought it was over. I was like,

2108
01:54:04,051 --> 01:54:07,050
this show I'm done with it,
but this season it came back so strong.

2109
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:10,350
It's like they just revitalized it.
They figured out what they did wrong.

2110
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:14,340
Yeah. That is. I never read the novel,
the graphic novel or anything like that,

2111
01:54:14,341 --> 01:54:16,260
but it is definitely riveting.
You know I

2112
01:54:16,450 --> 01:54:19,700
graphic novel because it doesn't
exist. It's fucking comic books. Dorks.

2113
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:21,750
I was trying to be graphic
novel is trying to,

2114
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:23,920
I'm tired of the people saying that.
The graphic novel,

2115
01:54:23,921 --> 01:54:26,720
you know what the fuck that his son
did? They talk a little bubbles. Yeah.

2116
01:54:26,770 --> 01:54:27,760
That's called the comic book.

2117
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:30,840
But it's like, it's like a, it's
like a $30 comic book. That's a lot.

2118
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:34,990
That's a lot of add on my paper route.
If you put it in little kid money,

2119
01:54:34,991 --> 01:54:37,210
that's a lot of saving
up at the lemonade stand.

2120
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:40,260
Well I used to love those.
Uh, the old school ones,

2121
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:43,410
they used to be these big ones called
creepy and eerie to remember those.

2122
01:54:43,411 --> 01:54:46,670
They were really good drawings
and black and white and you know,

2123
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:48,320
they were kind of like graphic novels too.

2124
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:51,650
That was, that was definitely
like the heavy metal years. Yeah.

2125
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:53,460
Like that kind of heavy metal.

2126
01:54:53,461 --> 01:54:56,340
Remember the heavy metal because of
mental con comic books. It was a magazine,

2127
01:54:56,341 --> 01:54:58,110
right? Yup. And it was like, it was like,

2128
01:54:58,170 --> 01:55:01,200
it was like pouring light because they
had all this cool checks in it and then

2129
01:55:01,201 --> 01:55:04,260
it had like the cool like you know,
trippy shit.

2130
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:08,310
They shall show like those like, you
know, whatever those like, you know,

2131
01:55:08,311 --> 01:55:11,820
savage princesses,
fights and all that kind of stuff.

2132
01:55:11,821 --> 01:55:15,660
So I was still a lot of that.
That's right. Remember the movie,

2133
01:55:15,690 --> 01:55:18,720
Remember Heavy Metal, the movie?
Yes. You remember that? Yeah.

2134
01:55:18,721 --> 01:55:20,720
My friend worked on it. Uh, her mom did.

2135
01:55:20,721 --> 01:55:23,280
Did the scene with the
corvette read a luxe, uh,

2136
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:26,730
with like the hot chick and pull some
of that up. I don't even remember that.

2137
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:32,900
Wow. There was a time when they were
making like animated adult movies.

2138
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:37,460
Do you remember wizards? Yeah. Do you
remember wizards? I just saw that reason.

2139
01:55:37,461 --> 01:55:40,730
It was a great fucking, for the
longest time I had a wizard's poster

2140
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:44,010
that was like a big movie,
you

2141
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,610
know, about like war and like,
you know, music. Well, whatever.

2142
01:55:47,611 --> 01:55:51,420
But that's the one where they had like
the Hitler speeches would create evil and

2143
01:55:51,421 --> 01:55:54,810
then the other, the, yeah, I
recently just saw it. I probably,

2144
01:55:54,811 --> 01:55:56,760
that was like one of those things
that it's like on that, you know,

2145
01:55:56,761 --> 01:56:00,750
like weird on demand scrolls I haven't
seen in forever, but now I want to see it.

2146
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:02,810
Yeah, that's crazy. You can't,

2147
01:56:02,910 --> 01:56:06,420
it's a bit weird how there's memories
that you normally can't access,

2148
01:56:06,421 --> 01:56:08,910
but all sudden you go down a road
and you're like, oh, what does this,

2149
01:56:08,911 --> 01:56:13,320
do you find it on the ground?
Oh, wizard, whoa. You know,

2150
01:56:13,321 --> 01:56:17,010
it's like if you had asked me, you
know, there was an animated film, uh,

2151
01:56:17,011 --> 01:56:20,520
it was from the 1970s and it's about
any bugged the fuck you talking about.

2152
01:56:20,521 --> 01:56:22,380
Like normally without
going down this road,

2153
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:24,150
I would never have access to that map,

2154
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:27,000
but we're going down the heavy
metal road as soon as you, you know,

2155
01:56:27,001 --> 01:56:30,660
we went from creepy and eerie
to heavy metal, heavy metal,
heavy metal, the movie,

2156
01:56:30,661 --> 01:56:33,240
it's animated movies for
adults and then boom, wizards.

2157
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:38,430
The future to a universe you've
never seen. This is definitely,

2158
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:42,660
wow.
It looks great.

2159
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:46,620
They used a different kind of form of
animation where they actually drew over

2160
01:56:46,621 --> 01:56:50,110
real stuff. So that's why the
people to kind of weird, realistic,

2161
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:55,280
they just drew over like it's okay man.

2162
01:56:56,371 --> 01:56:59,920
If there's one thing,
I know how to drive ratable,

2163
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:02,880
I need to watch this movie again too.
I saw this in the movies.

2164
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:07,020
Let your hands work. The
big midnight show. Yeah, no,

2165
01:57:07,110 --> 01:57:09,390
I saw lizard from the movie theater to,
Oh

2166
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:15,840
wow. This is wild. Wow. Good landing man.

2167
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:20,870
This is what,
it's an eighties right?

2168
01:57:22,370 --> 01:57:26,250
80 81
holy shit.

2169
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:29,460
This was my freshman year of
high school. This is it. Yeah.

2170
01:57:29,461 --> 01:57:34,290
This scene hand over your cash. Really?
They stayed. He drew. Oh, that's right.

2171
01:57:34,291 --> 01:57:35,160
He cooked the guy.

2172
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:39,570
They use something called Rodo scoping
where that's actually a guide underneath

2173
01:57:39,571 --> 01:57:43,620
their acting. Wow. Fantasies. Boy,

2174
01:57:43,621 --> 01:57:47,880
the voiceovers off.
What a good kid.

2175
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:54,050
Everybody's so deaf. That was before it.
Fake tickets. Those are real son, Huh?

2176
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:03,270
Oh, the soft porn. That's
what it was. That was great.

2177
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:07,600
I tricked you there. It was every guy's
fantasy. Justin spaceships and tits.

2178
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:12,500
Just enough when you're 16
yeah. Wow. I ships and teds.

2179
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:14,610
That was the working title.
Great.

2180
01:58:14,611 --> 01:58:18,360
Fucking my pipe that I haven't
done the movie preview though.

2181
01:58:18,361 --> 01:58:21,820
I guess this is it. This is,
it's all been yet. You know,

2182
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:25,420
so this is the one where she
fights the evil on that weird bird.

2183
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,930
This was the game of Thrones
before game of Thrones

2184
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:34,480
and there was that weird
theme song to write

2185
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:39,550
Bob Credible to see this is great.

2186
01:58:39,790 --> 01:58:42,190
1981 south park

2187
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:43,023
remade.

2188
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:46,400
It was probably one of the
earliest episodes or, wow.

2189
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:50,590
That was with the cat piss right where
they go into the crazy universe. I want,

2190
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:55,040
I have to must see things
now that and wizards wizards.

2191
01:58:55,550 --> 01:58:58,040
But Robert Bakshi,
is that what the guy's name was?

2192
01:58:59,150 --> 01:59:03,440
Wizard has a lot of message to it. Yeah.
I don't really remember the message,

2193
01:59:03,441 --> 01:59:07,190
but that was even before heavy metal I
saw wizard does is my stepdad when I was

2194
01:59:07,191 --> 01:59:10,000
like that ain't it? Yes, it's outflux
vertically. This is South Park Guy.

2195
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:15,580
Kenny gets high on on cat piss and then
goes through the heavy metal world right

2196
01:59:16,371 --> 01:59:17,204
into the movie.

2197
01:59:19,190 --> 01:59:20,650
That's the song. Yeah, that's his son.

2198
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:23,183
Okay.

2199
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:28,140
This is amazing.
Wow.

2200
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:32,530
This guys, this is for the
people listening. This is a,

2201
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:34,980
you need to watch on Youtube.

2202
01:59:34,981 --> 01:59:38,910
That's a convertible Trans Samson
with the ego on the, on the hood.

2203
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,800
The real world.
The Burt Reynolds one,

2204
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:44,250
they uh, they sold one of those
on that she'll fast and loud.

2205
01:59:44,251 --> 01:59:47,100
You ever see that show fast and
loud? Yes. The car show, the,

2206
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:50,740
they actually have one like that.
They sold a real old school.

2207
01:59:50,741 --> 01:59:55,360
Burt Reynolds smoking the exam and Burt
Reynolds signed it. He signed the Dash,

2208
01:59:55,570 --> 01:59:55,961
the uh,

2209
01:59:55,961 --> 01:59:59,980
they flew down to Florida and met him
at his house and held the dashboard out

2210
01:59:59,981 --> 02:00:03,760
for me. Sign it for them. It's pretty
cool. That would be, would he be like,

2211
02:00:03,761 --> 02:00:06,760
when are your ultimate guests
think Burt Reynolds? Yeah, he's,

2212
02:00:06,970 --> 02:00:10,710
he's hurting these days man and
a lot of physical pain. He's uh,

2213
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:13,840
like if you see him,
he's bent over and he walks with a cane.

2214
02:00:14,100 --> 02:00:15,220
He's really hunched over.

2215
02:00:15,270 --> 02:00:17,310
Yeah. But it'd be cool to get,
I'm like, I mean like really,

2216
02:00:17,311 --> 02:00:19,440
if he would want to come in,
I think that would be like a great guest.

2217
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:22,090
He would definitely be a great gas,
but I feel like,

2218
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:27,340
I mean I would really have
to talk to him too. Yeah.

2219
02:00:27,570 --> 02:00:31,170
I feel like someone who's mean he's,
when I saw him on fast and loud,

2220
02:00:31,230 --> 02:00:34,860
see if he could pull it up Brian cause
it's crazy to see. Oh we did show that.

2221
02:00:34,861 --> 02:00:38,910
That's right. He's so hunched over
that it looks like the guys in agony.

2222
02:00:39,090 --> 02:00:43,290
So I wouldn't want to have
uh, you know, tell me about
Sally fields. Pussy. Oh yeah.

2223
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:44,133
Know what I mean?

2224
02:00:44,950 --> 02:00:47,980
What I liked about Burt Reynolds and
I only was he like the ultimate like,

2225
02:00:47,981 --> 02:00:52,360
you know, sex God, whatever kind of dude.
Like you know, whatever that was. But he,

2226
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,220
he also was like another guy who like,

2227
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:56,080
he directed like he was
like one of those guys,

2228
02:00:56,081 --> 02:00:59,860
like he crossed over to be like
the director like really early on.

2229
02:00:59,861 --> 02:01:02,080
Like I think he was like a franchise guy.
Like you know,

2230
02:01:02,081 --> 02:01:05,860
like smoking in the band and the whatever
it was, he would definitely, he made,

2231
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:08,200
he made that jump cause
he was that biggest star.

2232
02:01:08,201 --> 02:01:11,050
So he was like one of the last big
stores you could do whatever you want it.

2233
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:14,620
He was pretty huge star. Awesome
fucking actor, man. I mean,

2234
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:17,830
people only know him from the smokey and
the bandit days are some of the other

2235
02:01:17,831 --> 02:01:21,280
crazy shit that he did, but he'd go way
back to to fucking deliverance. Man.

2236
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:24,640
Remember when deliverance, he used
a bow and Arrow to shoot that dude.

2237
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:30,430
Oh Shit. Bring it on back to bows
and arrows. Yeah, there you go.

2238
02:01:30,431 --> 02:01:35,140
Oh God. He still looks very good. I'll
look at that man. See his posture.

2239
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:39,980
That's so hard to see. He was a
football player, man. Guy Was a stud and

2240
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:44,180
to see him, you know this broken
down bent knees, walking with a cane,

2241
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:47,760
probably in real agony there.
That doesn't look right.

2242
02:01:47,770 --> 02:01:50,420
I wouldn't want to be on a fucking
podcast if I looked back down and I don't

2243
02:01:50,421 --> 02:01:54,620
think he leaves Florida either. I think
he just chills right now. It's rough.

2244
02:01:54,670 --> 02:01:58,340
See any heroes slowly rot away before
your eyes Dave Attell. Exactly.

2245
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,790
Is this wizard wizards

2246
02:01:59,950 --> 02:02:02,860
also a film the same
way using rotoscoping,

2247
02:02:02,861 --> 02:02:06,790
which is real actors underneath these
people just they get real goblins.

2248
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:09,720
Well that you could tell
her that is the motion.

2249
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,130
This is some scary moments in this one,
by the way. Good fucking movie, man.

2250
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:15,910
It was fun. It was a little
kid. You're like, well,

2251
02:02:15,911 --> 02:02:18,130
what's happening here and what's going on?
What's it like?

2252
02:02:18,131 --> 02:02:21,190
One guy who's the good guy and
the other guy's brother was evil,

2253
02:02:21,610 --> 02:02:25,690
the good wizard and then the bad one.
He's from the day they were born. Wow.

2254
02:02:27,490 --> 02:02:31,540
Who rules the peaceful
kingdom of God with wisdom?

2255
02:02:32,710 --> 02:02:36,820
Science and technology were outlawed
many of the years. The Brooklyn Wizard.

2256
02:02:39,690 --> 02:02:43,190
Well, the future feeling. Wow.

2257
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:46,520
Rediscovers the ancient
secrets of propaganda

2258
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:49,903
technology

2259
02:02:56,310 --> 02:03:00,700
and sends out his mutant armies
in a rain of unimaginable town.

2260
02:03:02,150 --> 02:03:06,860
Those are the good people in their
little else. Wizards will also

2261
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,560
Mortez concerns.
They were free in the 70s

2262
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:15,950
peace, Black Wolf's evil robot
pinch. What year was this?

2263
02:03:15,951 --> 02:03:20,951
Was transformed into an avenging
instrument of justice 87 really?

2264
02:03:23,510 --> 02:03:27,140
Wow. That's cool that
it's later. No, no, no.

2265
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:31,850
I'm making 70 77 years from.
That makes sense.

2266
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:35,450
Yeah, cause I was, I saw it when I
was really young. I remember that.

2267
02:03:35,451 --> 02:03:40,280
I guess I was 10 that's crazy.
They should be showing it in schools.

2268
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:43,430
Each kid about propaganda.
I know, right? Well it's,

2269
02:03:43,460 --> 02:03:45,920
well it's also to teach them
about the evolution of a,

2270
02:03:45,921 --> 02:03:49,640
of culture and art and you just look at
those movies like the heavy metal movie

2271
02:03:49,641 --> 02:03:53,970
and that movie, like there was so much
more, it was weird like there were,

2272
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:57,830
they had to do things like that because
they didn't have the kind of Cgi we had

2273
02:03:57,831 --> 02:03:58,280
today.

2274
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:02,030
So it was almost like their alternative
was to go artistic and make this fantasy

2275
02:04:02,031 --> 02:04:02,690
world.

2276
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:06,650
They're all drawing and animation and
you know ways where you didn't have to

2277
02:04:06,651 --> 02:04:11,120
totally make it real. You could still
enjoy it instead of having a B, you know,

2278
02:04:11,121 --> 02:04:16,121
like if you went back to like really
shitty like old school King Kong King Kong

2279
02:04:17,031 --> 02:04:18,320
from the thirties animation.

2280
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:21,250
Oh that's, yes. That's kind of
what they had from those days.

2281
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:24,700
But I love that really old old
animation with the like a, you know,

2282
02:04:24,701 --> 02:04:28,720
the steamboat Willie. I like what he's
like ink, just all black and white.

2283
02:04:28,721 --> 02:04:32,170
I like that. I like that. It's
like amazing drawing, you know?

2284
02:04:32,380 --> 02:04:36,400
Do you ever see those guys do those stop
motion claymation things that they used

2285
02:04:36,401 --> 02:04:38,020
to do for that King Kong and he's to

2286
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:42,120
do each frame, move it a little each
frame, move it a little. What's his name?

2287
02:04:42,121 --> 02:04:44,130
Ray Harryhausen.
Is that as the guy's name was?

2288
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:49,750
Did you ever see the wizard?
What's the wizards? The wizard.

2289
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:52,550
That's maybe you should check
out like here's a, here's a thing

2290
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:54,260
that one of the best clips from it.
However

2291
02:04:55,790 --> 02:04:58,000
this dates cheesy.

2292
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:03,650
You're the wizard.
He is this guy.

2293
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:07,980
I don't get it.
Is he like a poster child for someone

2294
02:05:09,550 --> 02:05:11,820
who are information butthead?

2295
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:15,090
He's had it for the video
championships in Los Angeles.

2296
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:18,950
Remember this? No. Well he's just a
really good video game player. Yeah.

2297
02:05:19,210 --> 02:05:21,040
This is when video games first came out.

2298
02:05:21,460 --> 02:05:26,350
Wow. So what year is
this? This is 89 again.

2299
02:05:26,530 --> 02:05:28,990
He gave me one watch this.
I'm good at all of them.

2300
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:35,030
I have 97 of them. Wow.
You know all 97 of them.

2301
02:05:40,110 --> 02:05:45,030
Remember the power low power glove
for a video. Remember any of that?

2302
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:49,160
Did they actually used to sell this? I
know what? Yeah, it was horrible though.

2303
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:50,030
What was it,
four?

2304
02:05:50,030 --> 02:05:52,880
It used to be used to be able to
control certain video games with it,

2305
02:05:52,881 --> 02:05:57,410
but it was really poorly designed
and watched. He plays a game called,

2306
02:05:57,411 --> 02:06:01,760
I think rad race or something like that.
Narco trafficker,

2307
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:03,320
89 87

2308
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:09,770
so this guys hooking the console up to
the TV. A big giant TV. I should add TV.

2309
02:06:09,771 --> 02:06:13,180
Looks like a house,
a racer.

2310
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:18,980
So He's two glove. Wow. Look at the graph.

2311
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:23,360
Oh my God. This is hilarious. Your
gps is more exciting now than that.

2312
02:06:26,210 --> 02:06:27,043
Look at this.

2313
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:33,710
This kid is steering with his glove
and everyone's getting intimidated.

2314
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:36,140
He's the best.
He's the best I've ever seen.

2315
02:06:38,870 --> 02:06:43,820
That's the wonder kid. Got Fred
savage. He's like dead now. Right?

2316
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:48,560
How old is he getting his? He
attack. Well, how old is he now?

2317
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:53,690
I don't know. But back then everyone was
shitting themselves when they saw this,

2318
02:06:53,691 --> 02:06:58,330
you know? Yeah. This is incredible.
The way steering and the music,

2319
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:59,510
inspirational music.

2320
02:07:00,220 --> 02:07:01,490
Oh my God,
there's a petsmart.

2321
02:07:07,570 --> 02:07:12,250
I loved power glove.
Whoa.

2322
02:07:12,370 --> 02:07:16,490
It puts it right up his ass. You know? He
does. Just keep it powered. Close off her.

2323
02:07:17,550 --> 02:07:21,130
There you go, Fred. There
you go, Fred. Wow. Wow.

2324
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:25,480
That's gross. Um, the guy's
name was Willis O'Brien.

2325
02:07:25,481 --> 02:07:30,481
He was the one who did the stop motion
animation in 1933 1933 King Kong.

2326
02:07:32,830 --> 02:07:36,240
Have you seen a trailer for
Godzilla? Yeah, the new fucking like,

2327
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:40,630
I haven't seen it. Do you watch old
school movies, Dave? Uh, yeah, I do.

2328
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:43,420
Do you ever watch old school movies and
imagine trying to live in that time?

2329
02:07:43,710 --> 02:07:47,130
Yes. Awesome. Yeah, I was like a better,

2330
02:07:47,790 --> 02:07:51,300
although there's some place,
sometimes you, I would never
like the colonial times.

2331
02:07:51,301 --> 02:07:54,420
I find that the most boring times
ever. That movie, that new show turn.

2332
02:07:54,690 --> 02:07:57,880
It's like spies and co colonial
time. Who Cares? What is it?

2333
02:07:58,110 --> 02:08:01,230
I don't know what you're talking. Okay,
well it's like revolutionary war era.

2334
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:04,620
Spy Ring, you know the Americans,
but they have great dialogue.

2335
02:08:04,621 --> 02:08:08,160
It's like you have to leave, you
have to get to Delaware. You know,

2336
02:08:08,161 --> 02:08:11,070
it's like all like local stuff that you
can get there like on a bus ride now.

2337
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:12,220
But it's like,
I don't know,

2338
02:08:12,221 --> 02:08:15,470
it's gonna take me three days to get to
Jersey and then you know, like they're,

2339
02:08:15,540 --> 02:08:20,310
they're a colonial spy, so it's
like boring. But uh, you know,

2340
02:08:20,311 --> 02:08:23,190
it's like educational.
So that's the big show now on,

2341
02:08:23,191 --> 02:08:25,830
in between walking dead
seasons. It's on AMC. Yeah.

2342
02:08:25,831 --> 02:08:28,890
If you're going to go back through time,
you want to go like cowboys and Indians.

2343
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:33,870
Fun Time. That's a good time. Way Deep.
You want to go like, you know, mid evil,

2344
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:38,310
evil times, Roman times, gladiator
times the colonial times.

2345
02:08:38,311 --> 02:08:41,760
Not much colonial times. Probably Pretty
fucking boring. I'm not interested. Yeah,

2346
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:45,750
he's, I'm telling you right now what
a bad choice. Well, but it's all like,

2347
02:08:45,751 --> 02:08:47,550
you know, there's spy,
so it's like weird stuff.

2348
02:08:47,551 --> 02:08:49,960
Like they'll write like the
guy's name on an egg, you know,

2349
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:50,960
but it's colonial times

2350
02:08:51,430 --> 02:08:55,090
sing. They'll never have a show on civil
war. What are you talking about? Oh,

2351
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:58,600
like a civil war show where they
show like they fall around the south.

2352
02:08:58,910 --> 02:09:02,470
All the soldiers around make it a common,
people were fighting for slavery.

2353
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,350
Those guys, you know,
they like the old days.

2354
02:09:05,351 --> 02:09:06,850
The Hogan Heroes Days they could make,

2355
02:09:07,150 --> 02:09:08,950
they had a show about
the goddamn hall crop.

2356
02:09:09,590 --> 02:09:13,510
Then it was a sitcom about a
concentration camp in Germany.

2357
02:09:13,700 --> 02:09:16,720
American soldiers who were always
tricking those dumb Jeremy.

2358
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:21,040
But klink was one of the stars.
You know Colonel Kurtz.

2359
02:09:21,041 --> 02:09:25,120
He was one of the stars are no Colonel
Klink and what's Schultz and Schultz is

2360
02:09:25,121 --> 02:09:27,670
one of the stars. They were stars.
He's German and they were buffoons

2361
02:09:27,930 --> 02:09:30,690
Hitler ever come on the show?
Was he ever a part of the show?

2362
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:32,310
They would have him drive drive.

2363
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:35,370
Like they'd be like the fear is in that
car and like you'd never see him or

2364
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:39,420
they'd high Kyle the car and then he let
go. I think that was an excellent move.

2365
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:40,620
Like you never really get to see him

2366
02:09:40,710 --> 02:09:43,920
but Hogan was always well fed and he
always looks fine cause he's always

2367
02:09:43,921 --> 02:09:47,460
tricking him and he's always tricking
them. That was a ridiculous show.

2368
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:50,490
Like could you imagine someone
pitching a show like that today?

2369
02:09:51,090 --> 02:09:55,240
What's the season finale? It didn't end
good. Did it? Was there a season finale?

2370
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:57,540
Yeah,
they all got gas.

2371
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:02,780
They all got a joke is on you whole again.

2372
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:05,630
The end of the shows series is 30 years

2373
02:10:05,730 --> 02:10:06,570
after the fact.

2374
02:10:06,571 --> 02:10:10,050
Some guys a Holocaust denier
and he's mocking it all and
then they fade to black.

2375
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:16,340
That's a weird, that's some weird fucking
thinking. It's Holocaust deniers that's,

2376
02:10:16,410 --> 02:10:19,980
I've had some, uh, some people send me
videos. Just watch this with an open mind.

2377
02:10:21,090 --> 02:10:22,260
Not really going to do that.

2378
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:24,880
You think they could ever do a
sitcom, you know, like, like,

2379
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:26,600
like a comedy with Hitler,

2380
02:10:26,601 --> 02:10:29,260
like a Hitler knows best where he's like
married or something and they try and

2381
02:10:29,261 --> 02:10:32,200
do that. Where in England because
they usually have cooler, you know,

2382
02:10:32,201 --> 02:10:34,610
up until recently. Like they,
their TV was way ahead of us,

2383
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:38,960
but what does it nowhere, like Hitler
had retired and he was living in England.

2384
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:41,480
It's like a 80 show, I believe. Yeah.

2385
02:10:41,490 --> 02:10:43,690
Like you remember Mel Brooks
Springtime for Hitler? Yeah.

2386
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:47,690
It was something like that. There
was no that story. What is it? He uh,

2387
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:50,490
one of his movies. What was the movie?
Do you remember the movie springtime,

2388
02:10:50,990 --> 02:10:54,920
the producers, the producers, producers.
He had all this money that he's trying.

2389
02:10:54,921 --> 02:10:57,020
He was trying to make,
for whatever reason,

2390
02:10:57,230 --> 02:11:00,380
trying to make this a
Broadway musical fail.

2391
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:02,900
He was trying to make like the
worst Broadway music lover,

2392
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:06,950
so he made springtime for
Hitler. Yeah. Ideal is like that.

2393
02:11:06,951 --> 02:11:09,830
It would be a musical about Hitler,
but people loved it.

2394
02:11:09,831 --> 02:11:14,600
It became like a smash hit. It's just us.
I think it's called hell honey at home.

2395
02:11:14,870 --> 02:11:16,070
Yeah. Hell honey, I'm home.

2396
02:11:17,930 --> 02:11:20,300
Get the fuck out and I got
to see the opening things.

2397
02:11:20,330 --> 02:11:23,990
How Huntington at home under the billing,
not so much a sitcom where, oh my God.

2398
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:27,590
Unfortunately neither Brendan nor the
series we're heard of again until now.

2399
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:32,420
A chance discovery in a Burbank backlog
has revealed the lost tapes in Burbank,

2400
02:11:32,450 --> 02:11:33,950
not my house.
Hi honey.

2401
02:11:33,951 --> 02:11:38,420
I'm home tapes that we believe
vindicate Brandon's Unsung Comic Vision.

2402
02:11:38,450 --> 02:11:42,350
Wow. Okay. Let's see what the opening,
I kind of see the opening show.

2403
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:44,093
Okay.

2404
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:45,920
Hi honey.
I'm home.

2405
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:50,313
This is a real,

2406
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:54,580
I don't believe this at all.

2407
02:11:54,710 --> 02:11:56,670
No, this is, yeah. I'm
not sure if this parity.

2408
02:11:57,250 --> 02:12:01,990
Hi honey. Me. Why did I do know? Oh China,

2409
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:06,880
you will make an Schnitzel. What a
judge. It must be real mad at me, honey.

2410
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:11,580
I'm a very, very bad
Hitler. Kill me a baby.

2411
02:12:11,890 --> 02:12:15,880
Don't touch me. You been late for
your dinner every night. This week.

2412
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:19,510
A Babe please on the bureau.

2413
02:12:20,620 --> 02:12:21,700
Is He,
man,

2414
02:12:21,701 --> 02:12:25,570
I can't just walk off the job at five
o'clock Monday you had to meet with

2415
02:12:25,571 --> 02:12:27,940
gerbils Tuesday by ribbon.

2416
02:12:27,941 --> 02:12:32,500
Trump Wednesday clouds
and gem or who's clubs?

2417
02:12:32,530 --> 02:12:35,350
Katzenjammer. Here's my Taylor.
You should see the Tux. Honey.

2418
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:39,580
One's more important than neighbor
will let me tell you something.

2419
02:12:39,581 --> 02:12:44,110
Mr Schickl Garoba you may
be big stuff in Germany,

2420
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:48,940
but I knew you when you were
just a house painter. Wow.

2421
02:12:49,050 --> 02:12:52,880
Oh my God. You're almost out of Hitler
jokes. Oh my God, that is awful. Right?

2422
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:55,230
They're almost out of all the Hitler
jokes. It's like two minutes in.

2423
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:58,360
That doesn't even seem real.
I don't think that's what I,

2424
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:01,470
I think that there was something
else like the English version,

2425
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:03,960
cause that seems like that was just
done like a couple of years ago.

2426
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:07,590
That seems like it was just like,
here's the sketch. I guess it's a

2427
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:12,030
real shift from England.
Seven episodes.

2428
02:13:12,990 --> 02:13:17,670
One aired in seven unaired episodes.
Ys Seven. Oh, that's hilarious.

2429
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:22,150
Seven an air and it's cool
that they gave it a shot

2430
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:27,710
after one episode air.
They canceled it.

2431
02:13:27,711 --> 02:13:31,890
It immediately and like that they found
the tapes in Burbank and some that's

2432
02:13:31,891 --> 02:13:32,370
funny.

2433
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:35,690
Yeah, of course they canceled. And the
guy who made it, what happened to him,

2434
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:39,000
Brandon with a Jewish ceremony.
Huh?

2435
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:43,790
Could you imagine pitching that to the
network? It's balls. It's just so stupid.

2436
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:47,970
And then not have any jokes to go
with it. You know, that's, I mean,

2437
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:50,810
you'd have to have some like
really good stuff to go with it.

2438
02:13:50,820 --> 02:13:52,990
I Bet Trey Parker and Matt stone
could do it. They did it with like,

2439
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:56,060
remember when they did that George Bush.
So that was pretty fucking funny.

2440
02:13:56,061 --> 02:13:57,410
That might,
that's my Bush are ready.

2441
02:13:57,670 --> 02:14:01,210
That show wasn't that good. I liked it
that I didn't think it was that good.

2442
02:14:01,930 --> 02:14:05,270
I didn't, don't pull it up. All right. Um,

2443
02:14:06,070 --> 02:14:09,400
I just didn't think it was like, I
mean, I think their best stuff, I mean,

2444
02:14:09,401 --> 02:14:12,550
I shouldn't say that. I was gonna say
their best stuff doesn't have real people,

2445
02:14:12,551 --> 02:14:14,130
but I like the Mormon musical,

2446
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:16,620
that thing rocks.
I W I can't even get tickets for that.

2447
02:14:16,621 --> 02:14:20,230
That's like sold out for like a
year or something. It's really that,

2448
02:14:20,270 --> 02:14:21,550
that's successful.
Yeah.

2449
02:14:21,980 --> 02:14:23,740
Yeah. I saw it early on
it, it's really funny man.

2450
02:14:23,810 --> 02:14:27,290
Somebody said that like, that's one
of the only adult shows on Broadway.

2451
02:14:27,291 --> 02:14:29,660
Like where, what used to be like,
you know, you and your mistress,

2452
02:14:29,661 --> 02:14:32,550
she'd go out and you see like, you
know, you know, like, uh, whatever.

2453
02:14:32,551 --> 02:14:36,140
Sammy Davis junior and like,
you know, crazy like adults.

2454
02:14:36,350 --> 02:14:40,160
Then it became a little kid, a five very
Disney, you know, like these, these, uh,

2455
02:14:40,161 --> 02:14:42,650
these shows now are like all about like,
just like singing to,

2456
02:14:42,651 --> 02:14:45,130
and you already know,
you know, and uh, that,

2457
02:14:45,131 --> 02:14:48,110
that's like an original concept
and it's really, it's really cool.

2458
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:49,970
It's supposedly really dark and funny.
So,

2459
02:14:50,420 --> 02:14:52,820
well,
it's probably the first one of those

2460
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:58,120
whose phone zone that's mine.
It'll go on me if I don't turn.

2461
02:14:58,130 --> 02:15:02,870
Keep telling to get all. Still
have flip a flip phone. Oh my God.

2462
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:05,630
What year did you buy that phone?
When did heavy metal come out?

2463
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:09,650
Do you print out directions?
I just, yeah, I do.

2464
02:15:10,250 --> 02:15:12,650
Why don't you still have a
phone like that? I just like it.

2465
02:15:12,690 --> 02:15:15,570
I like having a burner on me. I
don't know. I guess a burner. Yeah,

2466
02:15:15,571 --> 02:15:19,610
throw in the ocean
closes in.

2467
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:23,950
It's a, it's, it's a great, it's a
watch. It's a conversation starter.

2468
02:15:24,640 --> 02:15:27,340
Why is that pulled out in front
of chicks and they go, oh, Dave.

2469
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:32,480
Oh grandpa. He's so eccentric. Yeah.

2470
02:15:32,690 --> 02:15:37,050
Yeah. I was at a, do you guys, might've
I ever sick? Can I cigarette? Yeah,

2471
02:15:37,580 --> 02:15:39,500
you're going to have a cigarette.
You can have a cigarette here.

2472
02:15:39,501 --> 02:15:42,750
We'll turn the fan on, but don't
fire went up as well, Brian.

2473
02:15:43,330 --> 02:15:47,240
It's towards disgusting for your
body. You need to quit. David.

2474
02:15:47,241 --> 02:15:48,860
Tell you know what,

2475
02:15:49,450 --> 02:15:52,260
I totally agree with you now because,
uh, I don't know. How do you,

2476
02:15:52,270 --> 02:15:54,640
how do you handle like stress?
Like you work out a lot, right?

2477
02:15:54,641 --> 02:15:57,760
But like when you're stressed, you find
that that's when you grabbed for the,

2478
02:15:57,790 --> 02:16:01,000
you know, like you know the cigarette or
whatever, like the drink or something.

2479
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:01,840
What do you do?

2480
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:05,170
Um, well look, everybody
experiences stress.

2481
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:08,920
It's just a matter of if you can,
if you have the time.

2482
02:16:09,220 --> 02:16:13,370
Exercises to me is always the best
way to manage the whole thing. Right.

2483
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:15,940
You have a filter on there.
Like a hunters Thompson. Yeah.

2484
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,580
Look at you like that bitch. What's that
for? It's supposed to keep you alive.

2485
02:16:18,581 --> 02:16:19,300
Another couple of,
yeah,

2486
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:21,970
no, you got to see the torque coming
out. I like that. There's some about it.

2487
02:16:21,971 --> 02:16:24,200
I find that site. That's
cool. Like I'm pulling for it.

2488
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:27,650
No, I definitely think that
taking care of your body,

2489
02:16:28,010 --> 02:16:30,970
it helps mitigate a of the
stress that everybody feels.

2490
02:16:30,971 --> 02:16:34,120
Especially when you do a lot of
things like I do and travel a lot.

2491
02:16:34,121 --> 02:16:36,670
Like I do involve in a lot of
different things. A lot of,

2492
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:39,790
a lot of plates are spinning.
There's a lot of thinking.

2493
02:16:40,110 --> 02:16:40,381
Yeah,

2494
02:16:40,381 --> 02:16:44,400
well that's why I feel like I started
doing some kettle bells and stuff like

2495
02:16:44,401 --> 02:16:46,620
that.
And I immediately felt horrible,

2496
02:16:46,621 --> 02:16:50,040
but then I started feeling better
just because like it's, it's,

2497
02:16:50,340 --> 02:16:53,580
it really is like a stress reliever,
but nothing beats cigarettes. I'm sorry.

2498
02:16:53,581 --> 02:16:56,370
I think he'll back me up when you
blow it on me. Yeah, exactly. Well,

2499
02:16:56,371 --> 02:16:57,860
I know this is a long run dude.

2500
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:00,630
It's just terrible for
everybody else in the room.

2501
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:04,770
But you guys love it so much talking
about sacrifice for everybody else in the

2502
02:17:04,771 --> 02:17:07,170
room,
but it's amazing.

2503
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:11,610
It's amazing that like cigarette people
are like that. Like you love it so much.

2504
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:15,670
It's so important to you that you want
everybody else to suck in the smoky. Yeah,

2505
02:17:15,671 --> 02:17:18,870
but come on. Or a smoky air and
this 20 foot room. All right.

2506
02:17:18,930 --> 02:17:21,120
I mean I give you the green light.
It's all good.

2507
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:23,940
We've got to get Adam to acknowledge
the filtration system. Well,

2508
02:17:23,941 --> 02:17:28,920
we have a filter behind you. That's what
it's for. Oh really? From one vice was Z.

2509
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:29,010
Oh,

2510
02:17:29,010 --> 02:17:31,980
I wonder, I wonder how much he smokes a
day and I don't think he smokes anymore.

2511
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:36,420
Smokes. I thought he'd quit. Smokes.
Smokes again. I give it up. Oh,

2512
02:17:36,750 --> 02:17:39,150
I gave it up and then I gave up given up.

2513
02:17:39,690 --> 02:17:41,970
David be tried doing the
electronic cigarettes.

2514
02:17:41,971 --> 02:17:43,590
Like the baby's not doing that now.

2515
02:17:44,380 --> 02:17:48,120
Are you going to walk around with
that wizard wand can do this.

2516
02:17:48,121 --> 02:17:52,130
Like in a hotel room, you can do
this in a restaurant if you're not,

2517
02:17:52,350 --> 02:17:55,980
I bet you I bet. Ya know like in a
year from now though, the whole thing,

2518
02:17:56,010 --> 02:18:00,390
you liked the smell of deal. What do
you like about it? What, what, what?

2519
02:18:00,570 --> 02:18:03,030
Like when you light up,
when you liked that it smells like death.

2520
02:18:05,060 --> 02:18:08,940
It's like just pure, just waste.
Do you worry about your health?

2521
02:18:09,470 --> 02:18:13,820
I could care less at this point. No,
I do well could care less as the run,

2522
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:15,450
you know that. No, but
I'm just saying that like,

2523
02:18:15,451 --> 02:18:18,120
the whole idea with the
cigarette is that uh, you know,

2524
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:21,540
they'll do these things right?

2525
02:18:21,570 --> 02:18:24,720
They'll do this thing and then of course
somebody won't like that and then it'll

2526
02:18:24,721 --> 02:18:27,250
be easy to jump on the electronic
cigarettes, electronic cigarettes.

2527
02:18:27,670 --> 02:18:28,503
But it's like,

2528
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:31,290
do you understand that people are doing
electronic cigarette because they can't

2529
02:18:31,291 --> 02:18:32,520
do this and which is worse.

2530
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:35,310
So it's like give them a break
for at least the year of like,

2531
02:18:35,311 --> 02:18:38,880
let them smoke these electronic cigarettes
before you clamp down again on them

2532
02:18:38,881 --> 02:18:39,714
for that.
You know,

2533
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:42,710
the problem with electronic
cigarettes is not the standard ones.

2534
02:18:42,711 --> 02:18:46,970
Like those little blues that push out
vapor. Some of them push out a smell.

2535
02:18:47,150 --> 02:18:49,820
Like there's, there's something
distinguishable about it. And I'm like,

2536
02:18:49,821 --> 02:18:53,810
well what am I breathing in here? I
felt like chemicals, like Brian's,

2537
02:18:54,020 --> 02:18:57,710
Brian's is like, it's this Tiramisu,
it's a big cloud that comes out of it.

2538
02:18:58,040 --> 02:19:02,240
Like it's not like a mist. It's
more of a smoke. Like that's a,

2539
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:04,610
it seems like a better smoking cigarettes,

2540
02:19:04,611 --> 02:19:07,550
but still a smoke like puff puff on it.
Let me see what it looks like.

2541
02:19:07,850 --> 02:19:09,680
My battery died years

2542
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:16,000
me, but uh, you know, the, the
uh, they have flavored stuff.

2543
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:20,700
It was all these like weird twinkie,
crunchy flavors. You know, Teddy bear

2544
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:23,050
worried about your health at
all, man. And he, of course I do.

2545
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:26,150
What would the cigarettes,
if you ever tried to not do it anymore?

2546
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:28,010
I quit.
I quit before,

2547
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:29,840
but I, you know, at this point,

2548
02:19:29,841 --> 02:19:32,940
like when I brought up the
stress and stuff like that,
like I'm out, I'm, you know,

2549
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:36,680
like super hardcore promoting and all that
kind of stuff. It's like, it's like a,

2550
02:19:36,681 --> 02:19:40,550
you know, it's just all stressed right
now, so. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is.

2551
02:19:40,560 --> 02:19:44,960
Johnny Carson Story. Right. Cause
I have a genetic emphysema. Yeah.

2552
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:46,041
He couldn't even talk,

2553
02:19:46,041 --> 02:19:50,990
but all he would say it's
those damn cigarettes up
taking his was walking around

2554
02:19:50,991 --> 02:19:53,210
with an oxygen tank.
Hoses in his nose.

2555
02:19:53,290 --> 02:19:57,100
Yeah. But what a life, but what
a life, what a life before that.

2556
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:00,330
Hmm. I guess that's what you got to,
you know, is that what you gotta do?

2557
02:20:00,331 --> 02:20:02,130
The cigarettes really made it juicy,
right?

2558
02:20:02,220 --> 02:20:04,950
I don't know. I guess we live in a
culture where we have to live forever now.

2559
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:06,630
I don't,
I don't really understand

2560
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:10,850
about living forever. It's about
maintaining your health. It's a horrible,

2561
02:20:10,851 --> 02:20:13,070
it's a horrible end,
that's for sure. Mike, uh,

2562
02:20:13,250 --> 02:20:16,520
Mike Lacey from the comedy Magic Club
pulled Brian Aside once it was explained

2563
02:20:16,521 --> 02:20:17,870
to him what it was like at the end

2564
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:20,250
and made me cry.
But you know,

2565
02:20:20,251 --> 02:20:23,850
I would have one of the biggest things
I miss when I do quit when I tried doing

2566
02:20:23,851 --> 02:20:28,060
these electronic cigarettes or I try
not to smoke is the smoking gun tough

2567
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:28,801
period.
You know,

2568
02:20:28,801 --> 02:20:32,430
where your outs side talking to other
smokers and there was like something to

2569
02:20:32,431 --> 02:20:35,120
that camaraderie. We all
killing yourself together. Yeah,

2570
02:20:36,330 --> 02:20:38,760
I'm definitely going to try
and quit again. But it's,

2571
02:20:38,790 --> 02:20:41,640
it's a lot harder than non quitters think.

2572
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:45,780
I mean then a nonsmokers thing to quit.
It's not like, it's not like, you know,

2573
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:51,240
whatever, you know, it really is.
I, I, there's truth to the, uh,

2574
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:53,320
you know, cigarettes are harder
to quit than like, you know,

2575
02:20:53,340 --> 02:20:55,410
heroin or something like that. I
mean there, there really is like,

2576
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:58,860
cigarettes are so ingrained
usually in people that smoke, but,

2577
02:20:59,220 --> 02:21:02,100
but for people that don't smoke, it
must blow you away. The fact that like,

2578
02:21:02,101 --> 02:21:04,380
we're doing this like incredible.
The suicidal thing.

2579
02:21:04,630 --> 02:21:07,210
Well, I'm fascinated by it.
And the reason why I asked you,

2580
02:21:07,211 --> 02:21:10,750
it's not because I want to pester you,
but because everybody is, my mom smokes.

2581
02:21:10,751 --> 02:21:12,250
That's smart.
Like you,

2582
02:21:12,460 --> 02:21:15,790
I always feel compelled to try to get
their point of view and see if they have a

2583
02:21:15,791 --> 02:21:19,120
point of view. If they just deal with
it, they car compartmentalize it.

2584
02:21:19,121 --> 02:21:22,000
They don't think about it.
Like I'm fascinated by addiction.

2585
02:21:22,001 --> 02:21:25,840
Some I'm really fascinated by, uh,
especially things that I don't do,

2586
02:21:25,900 --> 02:21:29,020
like cigarettes, gambling,
coke, you know, Shit like that.

2587
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:30,430
I'm fascinated by those things.

2588
02:21:30,610 --> 02:21:33,880
So I'm always fascinated by the mindset
because I don't totally understand it.

2589
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:35,610
Right. You know, so I just,

2590
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:39,310
what a guy like you is a smart guy
and I see doing it and you'd love it.

2591
02:21:39,340 --> 02:21:42,610
You fucking can't wait to for,
can I fire this up? Oh, well

2592
02:21:42,850 --> 02:21:45,440
I mean we have been here
three hours right now.

2593
02:21:45,490 --> 02:21:49,540
I would've smoked half a pack if
you were out on the street. I could,

2594
02:21:49,541 --> 02:21:53,440
I could tell you like how many cigarettes,
like if you, how much do you smoke? Uh,

2595
02:21:53,500 --> 02:21:54,460
probably two bags today.

2596
02:21:55,590 --> 02:21:58,280
Yeah. Wow. That's a lot. Huh? Yeah. Well,

2597
02:21:58,420 --> 02:22:01,260
every 10 minutes you think you made me?

2598
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:06,450
No, it's, it's, it's, uh, less than that
because I don't sleep. I get up to smoke.

2599
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:11,720
Yeah. How much do you
sleep? Maybe now that I'm,

2600
02:22:11,730 --> 02:22:16,140
I'm doing all this crazy stuff. Uh,
three hours. Three hours? Yeah. Wow.

2601
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:19,530
What do you normally sleep if you weren't
a lot of hours? If I'm lucky. Wow.

2602
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:22,320
Four hours maybe. Well you're juiced
up on nicotine all the time. No,

2603
02:22:22,321 --> 02:22:25,140
it has to do with, I have to
work editing, like, you know,

2604
02:22:25,141 --> 02:22:27,870
like I have to do the notes at night
so that they can edit during the day.

2605
02:22:27,871 --> 02:22:30,780
And then I go in at night and
then now like with all these,

2606
02:22:30,781 --> 02:22:33,180
like with radio as you know,
like radio and all that stuff,

2607
02:22:33,450 --> 02:22:36,550
it's like there's a weird schedule to all
of that. And then doing shows at night,

2608
02:22:36,570 --> 02:22:39,060
cause I never stopped doing
shows, you know, of course.

2609
02:22:39,061 --> 02:22:41,890
But I meant like when you're not doing
this and you said five hours. Yeah,

2610
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:45,240
like five hours maybe because you're all
juiced up with nicotine all the time.

2611
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:47,880
I think cause I'm old and my prostate
tells me it's time to get up.

2612
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:52,300
I take a leak. Yeah. Hours. And
you're good if I'm lucky, you know,

2613
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:55,950
get some palm palm juice. Have you
tried some of those pills that help?

2614
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:58,680
What is this?
Doctor Oz gives a shit.

2615
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:03,870
It's like we were just watching
heavy metal and there's like a, uh,

2616
02:23:04,250 --> 02:23:09,210
a Caribou carcass here. It's
like, have you ever thought
of like, who gives a shit?

2617
02:23:09,810 --> 02:23:14,160
It's part of getting old guys. Get
used to it. Get used to it. Joe,

2618
02:23:14,161 --> 02:23:17,910
you're old enough to start now and not
have any probably any problems from

2619
02:23:17,911 --> 02:23:19,830
smoking.
You'll never write out for a year.

2620
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:24,890
You would never see anybody who like was
an athlete in their youth or like stole

2621
02:23:25,111 --> 02:23:28,050
is involved in athletics.
Like smoking is a no,

2622
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:31,160
my cardio was very important to me.
Yeah. Yeah, I understand that. You know,

2623
02:23:31,161 --> 02:23:34,980
never fuck around with that, but I'd
get it. I do love like uh, you know,

2624
02:23:34,981 --> 02:23:38,100
smokers do like, I'm just talking
about like my dad and his friends,

2625
02:23:38,101 --> 02:23:42,810
like they would have amazing like smoke
smoker superpowers where it's like, no,

2626
02:23:43,050 --> 02:23:45,960
they couldn't do anything. But like if
there was like something like, you know,

2627
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:47,940
hey, I need your help. What happened?

2628
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:51,420
My car fell in a ditch and like they
would just like come out with a cigarette

2629
02:23:51,421 --> 02:23:55,320
in the mouth and like lift up the car. I
was like, man, that's so cool. You know,

2630
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:58,560
we'll do it. Always work on cars with a
cigarette dangling out of their mouth,

2631
02:23:58,590 --> 02:24:03,360
gasoline everywhere. Oil, everything on,
yeah, no, just like there's a smoker dude.

2632
02:24:03,361 --> 02:24:04,980
Super Proud.
Like I guess I'm mad men.

2633
02:24:04,981 --> 02:24:07,560
You see some of it too where like
they're constantly smoking all the time,

2634
02:24:07,561 --> 02:24:10,380
doing whatever they do. But those
are like real cigarettes by the way.

2635
02:24:10,381 --> 02:24:12,790
It is no organic. That was, yeah,

2636
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,140
it was like more roles and
camels and Lucky's smoke.

2637
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:19,290
Do you do the organic organic now?
So I think that they,

2638
02:24:19,291 --> 02:24:23,730
they helped me just because they taste
horrible. Like, like the, the, you know,

2639
02:24:23,731 --> 02:24:28,650
the reds were like the best taste and
say that's like candy. Tastes good. Yeah.

2640
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:31,140
Oh yeah. Don't you feel like
with the, the American spirits,

2641
02:24:31,141 --> 02:24:35,730
so when you wake up you have more of
like, that's a thicker smoke, you know,

2642
02:24:35,731 --> 02:24:36,564
it doesn't have all the

2643
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:41,490
chemicals probably help the
cigarettes evaporate better.

2644
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:46,200
I'm just saying that like,
I can usually tell like three hours,

2645
02:24:46,230 --> 02:24:48,870
that would have been probably
coming up on half a pack.

2646
02:24:48,871 --> 02:24:50,610
So that's like 10 cigarettes.
You still smoke?

2647
02:24:50,611 --> 02:24:54,900
Newports Newports I don't smoke Newports
and that funny, but he's a brand.

2648
02:24:54,901 --> 02:24:57,330
That's funny. That was my
point. I wanted to make a point.

2649
02:24:57,690 --> 02:24:59,670
There's a brand that if
you say, it's funny, like

2650
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:04,590
what do you drive a
Yugo new or for Asians?

2651
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:09,790
The Asians like Newports no, that
was urban. Newport's were for urban.

2652
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:12,450
They would even like, they
were like, this is like racist.

2653
02:25:12,451 --> 02:25:16,140
Like the ad was like two beautiful black
people smoking a Newport and they're

2654
02:25:16,141 --> 02:25:20,550
like, this is racist. You
know, come up with a race
racist Newport ad, Google that.

2655
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:21,930
It's gotta be one on Youtube,

2656
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:26,260
cigarette racist. Uh, quitting.

2657
02:25:26,261 --> 02:25:30,650
Add that that they were playing right
now and people are saying is racist. Uh,

2658
02:25:30,790 --> 02:25:34,300
hold on, let me see if I can find
it right here. Right here we go.

2659
02:25:34,360 --> 02:25:38,320
Menthol cigarette quitting
at. Oh, I've seen that. Yeah,
that was definitely racist.

2660
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:41,080
But why is it racist to be accurate?

2661
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:44,860
Are we trying to put the black people
don't enjoy a menthol on occasion.

2662
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:47,890
I mean how many black
people like menthols.

2663
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:51,940
That's the sound of Dave cigarette
lighter. Horrible old phone.

2664
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,960
He's thinking about firing. Went up again.
It's north Hollywood. Crank that up.

2665
02:25:57,220 --> 02:26:00,890
So this is,
we need more than that.

2666
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:03,470
Oh No, no, no, no, no. This is the wrong
one. Yeah, this is the wrong one. They,

2667
02:26:03,471 --> 02:26:06,200
oh they knew or at least the new one.
He's the only one.

2668
02:26:08,310 --> 02:26:11,110
What? A bunch of jump. Here's the,
I think they originally saw it.

2669
02:26:11,111 --> 02:26:15,390
The guy pulls the teeth out. Yeah,
but that's not really racist.

2670
02:26:15,870 --> 02:26:17,280
The fact that you ordered menthols.
Okay.

2671
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:18,173
Okay.

2672
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:22,050
Well if you were going to
say a pack of cigarettes,

2673
02:26:22,051 --> 02:26:25,450
you wouldn't just say a pack of smokes
because they would say what kind? Yeah.

2674
02:26:25,451 --> 02:26:27,560
So he goes pack of menthols.
It's almost like he has to

2675
02:26:27,980 --> 02:26:30,590
and he pulls his tooth out.
It's not enough.

2676
02:26:30,620 --> 02:26:35,600
What's the pack of menthols cost you teeth
smoking menthols a regular cigarettes

2677
02:26:35,601 --> 02:26:38,610
can cause serious gum disease that
makes you more likely to lose them.

2678
02:26:39,850 --> 02:26:43,690
And that was a black guy's voice.
The via, how do you know? No,

2679
02:26:43,691 --> 02:26:47,420
he sounded yeah to, you know, I think
I worked with him at the Improv.

2680
02:26:47,830 --> 02:26:51,280
I tried to talk to somebody once
and they wouldn't admit that.

2681
02:26:51,310 --> 02:26:54,800
You could tell the difference when a black
guys on the phone sometimes there was

2682
02:26:54,801 --> 02:26:58,510
this a white liberal woman. She's
like, I'm really don't see that.

2683
02:26:58,660 --> 02:27:01,810
I'm going to get the fuck out of
here. You're telling me that you, you,

2684
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:04,360
you can't talk to someone. She
goes, what are you trying to say?

2685
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:07,720
Like she doesn't try to pin it on me and
trying to say that black people don't

2686
02:27:07,721 --> 02:27:09,070
talk like word. No. And
that's what I'm trying to say.

2687
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:13,690
I'm trying to say that with an intelligent
articulate person with a law degree

2688
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:17,860
that happens to be black.
Most Times you can tell, wow.

2689
02:27:18,250 --> 02:27:19,510
It doesn't mean that
they're not intelligent,

2690
02:27:19,511 --> 02:27:22,630
but that's no different than you being
able to tell. If someone's from New York,

2691
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:26,200
are you being able to tell that
someone is from Florida or the south?

2692
02:27:26,430 --> 02:27:29,410
That's a real thing.
It doesn't make them less intelligent.

2693
02:27:29,411 --> 02:27:30,850
You don't have to pussyfoot around that.

2694
02:27:31,050 --> 02:27:34,150
Black people sometimes on the phone
have a different way of talking.

2695
02:27:34,210 --> 02:27:35,770
Is that mostly because of reception?

2696
02:27:35,771 --> 02:27:40,210
You could tell they have a shitty phone
service. They have a different plan.

2697
02:27:41,050 --> 02:27:44,110
He went under the table.
He hit under is under is off the table.

2698
02:27:44,530 --> 02:27:48,630
You piece of shit.
No,

2699
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:51,340
that's not what it means at all,
Brian. They have a way of talking.

2700
02:27:51,341 --> 02:27:52,610
You know what I'm talking about Brian,

2701
02:27:53,110 --> 02:27:56,050
but sometimes there is that there's
basically, there's a situation here.

2702
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:59,140
Jurisdiction is in your court.
You know there's a way,

2703
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:03,220
I mean you're not always right, but
you'd be really freaked out. This is how,

2704
02:28:03,221 --> 02:28:04,054
this is the difference.

2705
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:09,100
If you heard a black guy talking and
you thought that he was a white guy and

2706
02:28:09,101 --> 02:28:11,530
then you met him and you realize
he was black, you'd be like, wow,

2707
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:12,550
that's kind of interesting.

2708
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:17,920
It's way worse when you talk to a guy on
the phone, you think it's a black guy.

2709
02:28:17,921 --> 02:28:22,700
You show up, it's a white guy and you
go, oh Christ, if guy's a fucking idiot,

2710
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:25,700
there's almost always an
idiot on the other end.

2711
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:29,900
If you run into a white guy that's
talking like a black guy on the phone,

2712
02:28:29,930 --> 02:28:33,200
like you're convinced you're about to
meet a black guy and it's a white guy,

2713
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:35,690
99% of the time,
that guy's a moron.

2714
02:28:36,110 --> 02:28:39,620
But if you're talking to a guy on the
phone and it's a black guy and you know

2715
02:28:39,621 --> 02:28:41,750
you don't know it's black guy
because he sounds like a white guy,

2716
02:28:42,170 --> 02:28:47,030
he's usually just a regular guy, you
know? It's like nothing wrong with them,

2717
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:51,870
you know? Right. I can
always tell, go with it.

2718
02:28:51,950 --> 02:28:54,530
I can always tell a Mexican because they
have that little Mexican twain to him.

2719
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:55,220
When a black,

2720
02:28:55,220 --> 02:28:59,570
unless a white dude was raised by black
people sequestered like in a scientific

2721
02:28:59,571 --> 02:29:03,620
experiment, they like talk took him
only around black people his whole life.

2722
02:29:04,070 --> 02:29:06,600
Then I can understand them talking
like that. Willie Hunter, he,

2723
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:08,270
I know if you remember the
comedian Willie Hunter,

2724
02:29:08,271 --> 02:29:10,910
he's been on a few desk squad shows.
He's a perfect example of,

2725
02:29:10,911 --> 02:29:14,180
you had him on the phone, you
would think he's white. Yeah.

2726
02:29:14,181 --> 02:29:16,850
There's a lot of guys like that. How
about Tyler night? Remember Tyler Knight?

2727
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:22,510
He's, I mean, Yay. So smarty songs
like a white guy, you know, that's,

2728
02:29:22,900 --> 02:29:26,720
that's racist, but it's not racist
to just make an observation.

2729
02:29:26,721 --> 02:29:30,200
It's like it's saying that's
racist is like saying, you know,

2730
02:29:30,201 --> 02:29:33,800
a lot of chicks get more freckles
Irish when they're out in the sun.

2731
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:35,870
That's fucking true.
It's not,

2732
02:29:35,871 --> 02:29:40,820
it's not racist to say that Irish people
have a problem with the Sun Pale people

2733
02:29:40,821 --> 02:29:43,550
who have a really white skin and
they get burnt really easily.

2734
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:45,500
That's not racist either.
It's an observation,

2735
02:29:45,780 --> 02:29:47,740
but I think with accents,
like when we're talking about,

2736
02:29:47,741 --> 02:29:49,210
like you could tell the
guys from a certain button,

2737
02:29:49,390 --> 02:29:52,390
it's like I'm from Long Island. Like we
used to have this distinct to accent.

2738
02:29:52,660 --> 02:29:55,330
I like Boston has this thing and
they said that like these accidents,

2739
02:29:55,331 --> 02:29:58,800
now we're starting to like, you know,
homogenized homogenize until like,

2740
02:29:58,801 --> 02:30:03,140
I guess this just like, you know,
Mulligan stew of like one bad, you know,

2741
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:04,750
whatever it is. But, uh,

2742
02:30:05,310 --> 02:30:09,250
there's very few places now where you can
actually hear like, oh, that's Kentucky.

2743
02:30:09,251 --> 02:30:10,360
You know, whenever, you know,

2744
02:30:10,580 --> 02:30:12,920
I'd love when I go someplace
and I hear a real accent.

2745
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:17,340
Like I love going to New York and like
the waiter to New York. I'd look you, uh,

2746
02:30:17,530 --> 02:30:20,100
this is the menu. Can I introduce
you to our specials? Yes.

2747
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:23,270
That's a real love that I
love New York accent. Yeah.

2748
02:30:23,271 --> 02:30:27,020
I love hearing an accent that
I especially probably, cause I

2749
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:32,120
pretty aware that those aren't gonna
be around forever in the future.

2750
02:30:32,121 --> 02:30:34,020
A thousand years from now,
it's not gonna be any accents.

2751
02:30:34,220 --> 02:30:37,310
Well I can gangs of New York,
you know, when they had like
the different, you know,

2752
02:30:37,311 --> 02:30:39,380
cause they were like Irish
but they were in New York.

2753
02:30:39,590 --> 02:30:42,710
So like they had to kind of think of
this kind of turn of the century New York

2754
02:30:42,950 --> 02:30:46,010
kind of like really, really
down and dirty uh, accent.

2755
02:30:46,011 --> 02:30:50,210
So it sounded more like it was, it was
wherever like Ireland then it was there.

2756
02:30:50,211 --> 02:30:52,650
But it was cool to hear because
you're thinking like, you know,

2757
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:53,780
when did we really started talking?

2758
02:30:53,781 --> 02:30:56,960
Like we talk instead of like the English
talky talk, you know like in England.

2759
02:30:56,961 --> 02:31:00,290
So it's like when was the crossover?

2760
02:31:00,570 --> 02:31:03,270
Yeah. And what caused the
crossover? Was it just like,

2761
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:06,840
cause all these different languages
were learning English when they got to

2762
02:31:06,841 --> 02:31:08,560
America,
that paces like

2763
02:31:08,660 --> 02:31:11,170
probably radio, like radio, liquid,

2764
02:31:11,210 --> 02:31:12,980
everybody started hearing what
everybody outside of the light.

2765
02:31:12,981 --> 02:31:15,790
That's when they started like probably
mimicking it. And then that became like,

2766
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:17,690
because there probably
was a technology thing

2767
02:31:17,740 --> 02:31:19,980
you're going to, you know why
you're right. Makes a lot of sense.

2768
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:23,510
Like that's when the accident started
dying down. And then like with TV,

2769
02:31:23,511 --> 02:31:28,160
same thing, you know? Yeah.
No Shit. Right. That's
fascinating. But I'm, no, I'm no,

2770
02:31:28,161 --> 02:31:31,910
whatever that's called a
scientist or something. But yeah,

2771
02:31:31,911 --> 02:31:35,120
I assume it's like when everybody started
really hearing each other like a lot.

2772
02:31:35,360 --> 02:31:36,800
Well,
when I heard myself,

2773
02:31:36,980 --> 02:31:40,340
I was 19 and I heard myself on
television for the first time.

2774
02:31:40,341 --> 02:31:44,000
I realized how gross my accent
sounded. Boston I started, yeah,

2775
02:31:44,001 --> 02:31:48,740
I started working on getting rid of it.
I never minded that happened. Oh yeah.

2776
02:31:48,741 --> 02:31:52,550
But mine was hard. It wasn't good.
I was a, it was talking about a,

2777
02:31:52,551 --> 02:31:55,430
I was interviewed after a tournament
and I was talking about putting in hard

2778
02:31:55,431 --> 02:31:59,230
work, rabbit, nick,
listen to myself going,

2779
02:31:59,300 --> 02:32:03,440
well, I love all that Boston like a
pattern though. Hey Sweetheart, that's up.

2780
02:32:03,620 --> 02:32:05,170
Chappy.
I love Alexa.

2781
02:32:05,620 --> 02:32:07,180
Yeah,
there's a lot of e's on the end.

2782
02:32:07,210 --> 02:32:10,720
A lot of nicknames is
solely and Fitzy and fucking

2783
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:16,570
wait on.
People suffer places where people suffer.

2784
02:32:16,571 --> 02:32:18,910
The senses of humor are
going to be a bit stronger.

2785
02:32:19,090 --> 02:32:23,580
It's going to be a bit more character
in the air. You know, if you,

2786
02:32:23,660 --> 02:32:26,710
if face adversity in a place
like that New York too, you know,

2787
02:32:26,820 --> 02:32:29,500
it gets cold as fuck in the winter,
you know, you faced a lot of adversity.

2788
02:32:30,020 --> 02:32:34,940
Yeah. New York though, like a New
York now is very, very international,

2789
02:32:34,941 --> 02:32:39,290
very uh, you know, very metro. So you
know, if you hear an accident like that,

2790
02:32:39,291 --> 02:32:41,270
that must mean you're paying
money to see it because I,

2791
02:32:41,271 --> 02:32:44,880
I've never heard anybody recently with
the Brooklyn, like that's my daughter.

2792
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:47,970
We go to like a restaurant and
like a real town restaurant.

2793
02:32:47,971 --> 02:32:51,090
The guy is serving you
has a Brooklyn accent.

2794
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:55,830
No, I, I really liked those
kind of classic, you know,
like the westies Irish mob,

2795
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:58,540
like that kind of stuff. You really
don't hear that much anymore. You know,

2796
02:32:58,541 --> 02:33:01,390
like occasionally you'll see a guy that
you knew was like a Westie and you'll be

2797
02:33:01,391 --> 02:33:04,000
like, what's up? And I'll have that
like, you know, that cool accent.

2798
02:33:04,330 --> 02:33:07,830
Like Colin Quinn consequent has the great,
you know,

2799
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:10,690
and he's like the most intelligent
guy. No, I mean he's just so smart.

2800
02:33:11,110 --> 02:33:15,460
He has that cool like that, that thing
too. His voice is like, it's very sexy.

2801
02:33:15,461 --> 02:33:17,350
It's very, it's very
good. It's cruise Madec

2802
02:33:17,530 --> 02:33:20,230
yeah. Collins a fascinating guy. He's um,

2803
02:33:20,350 --> 02:33:23,770
he's a very funny on Twitter to God.
Like,

2804
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:27,210
it's funny when people don't know that
he's just fucking around like joke.

2805
02:33:28,510 --> 02:33:32,320
If you know his sense of humor, you
know, it's really funny. But you know,

2806
02:33:32,321 --> 02:33:35,680
if you're some 16 year old kid in the
middle of nowhere and you read it,

2807
02:33:35,681 --> 02:33:39,250
you're like, lol dumb ass.
That's not even how it works.

2808
02:33:40,570 --> 02:33:44,560
He'll say things that are so preposterous.
Did he do look a history show?

2809
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:48,890
Yes. Yeah. One man show. I knew one
woman show. Uh, what, what is it called?

2810
02:33:48,891 --> 02:33:53,380
Cause that is, I saw that, I saw that
like over July to July weekend last year.

2811
02:33:53,381 --> 02:33:56,200
It was really good. You
know, he's really, really,

2812
02:33:56,201 --> 02:33:59,260
really intelligent man and like a I,
that would be great.

2813
02:33:59,740 --> 02:34:02,200
That'd be a great thing for him to do.
Like continuously,

2814
02:34:02,201 --> 02:34:06,550
just like these really cool high
end woman shows. Long story short.

2815
02:34:07,050 --> 02:34:08,870
Now that's, that's the, uh,

2816
02:34:09,430 --> 02:34:12,310
that's another thing he did
five minute history lesson.

2817
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:15,150
Does he ever do standup specials?
Yeah.

2818
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:18,160
Um, I, I think so. I know that like,

2819
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:20,320
once again,
like he's been working on this,

2820
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:22,690
like putting a one man show
together is like endless.

2821
02:34:22,691 --> 02:34:25,840
So I know he was working on at
workshopping it. Like, like I said,

2822
02:34:25,841 --> 02:34:29,050
he would do it in these different clubs
but now it's done and I think he's

2823
02:34:29,530 --> 02:34:31,960
touring it and hopefully it'll be,

2824
02:34:32,410 --> 02:34:34,960
it'll be sold and like you can
see it on like HBO or something.

2825
02:34:34,961 --> 02:34:36,760
Like I don't even know how that works.
Like a one man.

2826
02:34:36,761 --> 02:34:38,160
How do you sell a one man show?
I'm,

2827
02:34:38,450 --> 02:34:41,290
well it seems like kind of show that you
would want to see all over the country.

2828
02:34:41,291 --> 02:34:45,610
Like he get tourist city for a few months
at a time and do it just sort of like,

2829
02:34:45,611 --> 02:34:49,120
uh, like the book of Mormon, like that
kind of a thing you'd go to see it.

2830
02:34:49,121 --> 02:34:52,180
Cause it's, it's just different
than just pure standup comedy.

2831
02:34:52,690 --> 02:34:56,620
Like ultimately like that's like the
perfect kind of thing for like England

2832
02:34:56,621 --> 02:34:59,080
where you were talking about like
they expect a show, you know,

2833
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:01,300
that would be like the
perfect kind of thing.

2834
02:35:01,410 --> 02:35:03,840
It's about the bill of rights
and it's about like, you know,

2835
02:35:03,841 --> 02:35:06,770
our constitution and stuff like that.
And I didn't want to like, I don't,

2836
02:35:06,810 --> 02:35:10,590
I definitely do not want to like talk
more about it because I don't really know

2837
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:15,000
exactly, you know? Yeah. It
really is. It's so intricate.

2838
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:19,530
It is taking something that is really
dry and kind of unfunny and really making

2839
02:35:19,531 --> 02:35:22,860
it funny and uh, you know, he, he's
just that good at this. I mean,

2840
02:35:22,890 --> 02:35:26,160
it really is a great show. He's going
to be in town, uh, in California.

2841
02:35:26,190 --> 02:35:28,620
I think he's here now. Yeah. We
should get him on. Where's he at?

2842
02:35:29,080 --> 02:35:33,950
And May 1st he's in grass valley, May 2nd
Santa Cruz and May 3rd uh, Irvine. Cal.

2843
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:38,930
Oh well we'll try to get them May 3rd
or around May 3rd. He's the best man.

2844
02:35:39,010 --> 02:35:43,610
We were fucking booked up that
week, son. Buck Gun. Yeah, no,

2845
02:35:43,611 --> 02:35:47,040
he is.
He's a very underrated standup too.

2846
02:35:47,060 --> 02:35:49,280
Like I've heard people say they don't
think he's funny. I'm like, well,

2847
02:35:49,281 --> 02:35:51,110
you've never seen him live.
If you've seen them live,

2848
02:35:51,111 --> 02:35:54,080
you would know how fucking funny
that guy has his warmups for his show

2849
02:35:54,081 --> 02:35:57,710
politically, whatever it was.
Glass, tough crowd. Tough crowd.

2850
02:35:57,720 --> 02:35:59,450
You confuse it with politically incorrect.

2851
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:05,020
There was fucking one of the best
warmups I ever saw anybody do ever.

2852
02:36:05,181 --> 02:36:08,390
It was him just fucking around with the
crowd doing stand up and then he would

2853
02:36:08,391 --> 02:36:11,120
go to do the show. It was like I was
watching, I was like, wow, you know what,

2854
02:36:11,270 --> 02:36:12,770
this is the best part of the show.

2855
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:15,860
The best part of the show was him
fucking around with the crowd.

2856
02:36:15,861 --> 02:36:18,290
Like that was the funniest part.
Like us sitting down,

2857
02:36:18,300 --> 02:36:20,900
these hurried rushed topics would go to,

2858
02:36:20,930 --> 02:36:25,240
you know really quickly on the panel
wasn't as good as him doing his little

2859
02:36:25,241 --> 02:36:26,340
stick and he a crowd.

2860
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:28,730
He is so good and like his, his, you know,

2861
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:33,790
I don't even want to be smirch about his
crowd work is so like it's so ahead of,

2862
02:36:34,990 --> 02:36:35,581
I'd be,
I,

2863
02:36:35,581 --> 02:36:38,720
I basically learned how to work route
by watching him at the comedy cellar and

2864
02:36:38,721 --> 02:36:42,650
other places that he was so classy and
so intelligent that like it would take

2865
02:36:42,651 --> 02:36:44,750
you a minute to get the
reference cause he was so,

2866
02:36:44,960 --> 02:36:46,550
he wasn't going for the easy joke.

2867
02:36:46,551 --> 02:36:49,760
He would never go for the easy joke and
like he really did take it to a whole

2868
02:36:49,761 --> 02:36:50,960
new level.
So he was like,

2869
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:53,630
he was really influential on me and
especially on that kind of stuff.

2870
02:36:53,780 --> 02:36:57,200
And he also has like a really,
really, really like master of timing.

2871
02:36:57,201 --> 02:37:00,650
Like he really is good at like crafting
a joke and then telling it the right way.

2872
02:37:00,651 --> 02:37:01,120
So

2873
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:06,070
you ever heard Jay Morris impression to
him? No. That's uncanny. It's uncanny.

2874
02:37:06,500 --> 02:37:10,960
He really uncanny the best impressions
I've ever heard. It's amazing.

2875
02:37:10,961 --> 02:37:15,080
Jay's a buddy of mine. He's, his
impressions are incredible that that one,

2876
02:37:15,081 --> 02:37:17,750
at least the comp, when one's amazing.
I'm not, the other ones aren't.

2877
02:37:17,751 --> 02:37:20,180
But I know of the Collin Quinn one,
it's pretty amazing. It's like,

2878
02:37:20,200 --> 02:37:24,260
it's sounds like Collin,
I mean it's like exact,

2879
02:37:24,900 --> 02:37:27,450
you should add when Konan comes in and
you should ask him the same thing about

2880
02:37:27,451 --> 02:37:29,270
accidents cause he has
like all the good acts.

2881
02:37:29,410 --> 02:37:33,140
It's like guys,
they were doing you for awhile.

2882
02:37:33,170 --> 02:37:36,590
There was a lot of guys that would like,
I would see guys doing a tell. Right.

2883
02:37:36,890 --> 02:37:38,990
It was that flattering
or did that bother you?

2884
02:37:39,090 --> 02:37:40,610
I don't know.
People would always tell me,

2885
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:45,110
tell me they were doing me and then I'd
be like, you know, I Kinda, I kinda like,

2886
02:37:45,140 --> 02:37:47,600
there's really nothing you can do
about it. I mean, like, you know,

2887
02:37:48,100 --> 02:37:51,410
it did help me move forward in comedy
of like, you know, well I better,

2888
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:56,300
I better too. I better get better.
You know? Like if somebody said to me,

2889
02:37:56,480 --> 02:37:59,930
but I don't think there's anything like,
I dunno, I was never allowed to like,

2890
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:02,780
hey dog, you're doing my, you know,
get your hands out of my pocket.

2891
02:38:03,590 --> 02:38:04,850
Get your hands out of my pocket.

2892
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:07,830
Is that the people that
they're stealing his essence?

2893
02:38:08,020 --> 02:38:10,570
You know, it's like you have no respect
for somebody who's doing it, you know,

2894
02:38:10,571 --> 02:38:12,970
like they always say it's flattery.
It's like I think it's laziness.

2895
02:38:12,971 --> 02:38:16,270
I mean like do your own thing, you
know, it's been a tagine. But you know,

2896
02:38:16,271 --> 02:38:18,160
the thing about it is like when you,
when you first start out,

2897
02:38:18,161 --> 02:38:20,530
you will like mimic the guy
that you love the most and then,

2898
02:38:20,531 --> 02:38:23,350
but you're supposed to move
past that and that's all thing.

2899
02:38:23,351 --> 02:38:25,210
It's like you have your
own unique thing you do.

2900
02:38:25,450 --> 02:38:28,510
I'm trying to do my own unique
thing and that eventually,

2901
02:38:28,511 --> 02:38:31,090
like when you get strong enough then
you got to kind of like say like,

2902
02:38:31,091 --> 02:38:35,140
well that's too much like this guy and
that's not like me and I should do this.

2903
02:38:35,410 --> 02:38:37,720
But uh, you know, it did
make me go like, you know,

2904
02:38:37,810 --> 02:38:41,110
I have a lot of bad habits that I
really need to drop that people are just

2905
02:38:41,111 --> 02:38:41,944
mimicking.

2906
02:38:42,030 --> 02:38:43,640
No,
they were not bad habits.

2907
02:38:43,820 --> 02:38:48,020
No, no. I, I, I do know, like a lot of the
turns that I did like other guys would do,

2908
02:38:48,021 --> 02:38:50,950
you know, like my turns, I always
think that there might be things,

2909
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:53,080
but they're probably everybody's turns
into, you know what I'm talking about.

2910
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:57,660
Yeah. For a bit to bit to be the, it
was a style of delivery, you know,

2911
02:38:58,370 --> 02:38:59,203
thing you do.

2912
02:39:00,030 --> 02:39:02,730
Stan hope does that to me all the time.
I don't do that anymore.

2913
02:39:02,731 --> 02:39:05,820
But you know why I would do that because
like when I first started out doing

2914
02:39:05,821 --> 02:39:08,040
comedy,
timing is so important of like,

2915
02:39:08,280 --> 02:39:12,730
so I was hanging out and now you've got
to, here comes the joke part, you know,

2916
02:39:13,230 --> 02:39:18,180
there, you know and like
that was the thing and behind
all that energy was also a

2917
02:39:18,181 --> 02:39:21,090
really horrible crowd,
like talking and yelling.

2918
02:39:21,091 --> 02:39:24,610
So that's why it's all so like
bang, Bang, Bang, like that. Well

2919
02:39:24,610 --> 02:39:28,720
that was the great thing about doing
claws. My special. Yeah. I love,

2920
02:39:28,750 --> 02:39:31,030
is that the stress factory? Yeah,
it's a stress fracture in New Jersey.

2921
02:39:31,031 --> 02:39:34,060
What a great, that's a great,
yeah, there's is a fee.

2922
02:39:34,090 --> 02:39:37,240
He does phone calls from the step,
just like these prank phone calls.

2923
02:39:37,390 --> 02:39:39,370
If I was a rich guy,
I would have one of those in my house.

2924
02:39:39,371 --> 02:39:42,670
I think Kandi would
come out to make a call.

2925
02:39:43,450 --> 02:39:45,580
You call them people right
there? Well, yeah. Say Dave,

2926
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:49,450
I'm calling somebody for a joke.
Yeah.

2927
02:39:49,451 --> 02:39:52,180
There was a lot of guys that
were coming up a few years back.

2928
02:39:52,181 --> 02:39:53,200
There were imitating you.
It was,

2929
02:39:53,201 --> 02:39:55,960
it was kind of annoying because I
would hear it all the time at clubs,

2930
02:39:55,961 --> 02:39:57,670
so I was like, oh my God,
this guy's doing to tell.

2931
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:01,810
Like they would be doing
their own material but be
doing it like you and you're

2932
02:40:01,820 --> 02:40:04,710
like, oh, come on man, you, it's free.

2933
02:40:05,140 --> 02:40:09,770
You develop that in the trenches and
you, you figured out a way to, you know,

2934
02:40:09,780 --> 02:40:14,100
to get the point across and have like
a compelling rhythm that's fun to watch

2935
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:18,540
captivates people get some locked in
and someone just came along and gag that

2936
02:40:18,541 --> 02:40:18,990
shit.

2937
02:40:18,990 --> 02:40:23,020
But I don't think I really do that that
much anymore because like I always felt

2938
02:40:23,021 --> 02:40:27,160
like that was hacked, that I was
doing that kind of rhythm. No,

2939
02:40:27,161 --> 02:40:29,360
it's cool that you guys
said that, but, but I, I,

2940
02:40:29,470 --> 02:40:32,590
I have walked into like a room and I'll
see you guys doing and I'll be like, oh,

2941
02:40:32,620 --> 02:40:35,860
I guess he's a fan. You
know, there really is no,

2942
02:40:36,130 --> 02:40:39,280
I always feel like I need to get better
and that these other people like that

2943
02:40:39,310 --> 02:40:40,930
they're on their own
journey, you know, like,

2944
02:40:40,931 --> 02:40:44,170
I guess that's the coolest Zen way to
look at all of this stuff. You know,

2945
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:47,890
they're on their journey.
I'm on my own, you know,

2946
02:40:48,220 --> 02:40:50,380
experienced through
comedy and, uh, you know,

2947
02:40:50,381 --> 02:40:53,470
hopefully I'll get better and now I'll
look back on that and laugh and I kind of

2948
02:40:53,471 --> 02:40:56,620
do now where it's just like,
you know, everybody kind of,

2949
02:40:56,800 --> 02:41:00,160
everybody kind of sounds a little bit
the same and then you'll see that one guy

2950
02:41:00,161 --> 02:41:03,040
that like stands out and you're like,
wow, you know, we all need to step up, or,

2951
02:41:03,460 --> 02:41:07,060
you know, yeah. You, I think
what you're doing like that,

2952
02:41:07,061 --> 02:41:10,060
that sort of way of thinking,
it's the most empowering way.

2953
02:41:10,480 --> 02:41:12,670
Yeah. Oh yeah. You take control of it.

2954
02:41:12,760 --> 02:41:13,720
Yeah. Well it's, you,

2955
02:41:13,721 --> 02:41:18,250
you see it for what it is and you move
forward and use it as inspiration instead

2956
02:41:18,251 --> 02:41:20,900
of like, there's certain guys that like,
someone will sound like I'm in there.

2957
02:41:20,901 --> 02:41:24,450
Like we were talking about Dane
freaking out at uh, uh, he did it.

2958
02:41:24,470 --> 02:41:26,340
Steve Byrne and then
he did it for crystal.

2959
02:41:26,341 --> 02:41:28,360
Leah told them that they're
stealing his absence.

2960
02:41:28,870 --> 02:41:32,590
He said that Chris two pulls him aside.
You're stealing my assets. Really.

2961
02:41:34,060 --> 02:41:38,850
I could really do that
to me.

2962
02:41:38,890 --> 02:41:41,590
I know guys who I've taken that
on the road and they start to,

2963
02:41:41,620 --> 02:41:43,660
they start to mimic like me.

2964
02:41:44,110 --> 02:41:48,310
But you hear about people doing
standup all the time. Yeah, absolutely.

2965
02:41:48,311 --> 02:41:50,940
He's got a very distinctive
style delivery too. Yeah.

2966
02:41:51,410 --> 02:41:51,510
Oh,

2967
02:41:51,510 --> 02:41:55,430
the Hedberg Hedberg one always bothered
me the most when I would hear a guy like

2968
02:41:55,460 --> 02:41:58,730
Mitch Hedberg cause you know, it's
like, you know, I have a little respect,

2969
02:41:58,890 --> 02:42:01,760
especially after he's dead. And
then they'll always go like, yeah,

2970
02:42:01,761 --> 02:42:03,980
but I was doing this before.
I was like, I doubt it.

2971
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:06,560
I doubt you were doing this
before Mitch Hedberg. You know,

2972
02:42:06,561 --> 02:42:10,130
they'll always like try and cover what
like no, as a baby. I sounded like that.

2973
02:42:11,340 --> 02:42:14,240
Yeah, it was cool. It's like, dude,

2974
02:42:14,241 --> 02:42:17,810
like now you know like now like you know,
wake up and do your own thing,

2975
02:42:17,811 --> 02:42:22,220
but they always like, no man.
You know? Like they'll like, no,

2976
02:42:22,221 --> 02:42:24,800
you don't understand what I'm doing.
It's nothing like that. And it's like,

2977
02:42:24,801 --> 02:42:25,970
it's exactly like it dude.

2978
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:31,740
Dare her comics. I know it's
very difficult to let a bit go,

2979
02:42:31,830 --> 02:42:34,680
especially if that bit works.
Right? Sometimes you'll,

2980
02:42:34,710 --> 02:42:38,070
you'll come up with a bid on your own,
horrible and it works,

2981
02:42:38,130 --> 02:42:40,680
but then you find out another guy's
doing it. You got to drop that.

2982
02:42:41,170 --> 02:42:43,440
You got to look at, you've got to be
able to look at yourself honestly.

2983
02:42:43,441 --> 02:42:47,160
And if you sound too much
like Mitch Hedberg, you got
to fucking change that up.

2984
02:42:47,190 --> 02:42:51,030
You can't do that. You can't. People are
going to know and then they're going to,

2985
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:53,460
they're going to always look at you is
that is that guy that used to sound like

2986
02:42:53,461 --> 02:42:54,294
Mitch Hedberg?

2987
02:42:54,520 --> 02:42:55,000
Yeah.

2988
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:58,540
You know like if they dig in their heels
and their and their and it takes about

2989
02:42:58,541 --> 02:42:59,320
it.
But,

2990
02:42:59,320 --> 02:43:03,310
and then there's the guys who like fake
tribute comics by doing their immature

2991
02:43:03,380 --> 02:43:07,990
and they feel like Patrice Patrice. Oh,
I didn't know. I thought it was a trip.

2992
02:43:08,380 --> 02:43:12,010
Do they say after caught him on it,
but

2993
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:15,660
I was just like, you know
dude's Oh, you're talking
about the guy on Youtube? Yeah.

2994
02:43:15,670 --> 02:43:18,850
That guy. Oh, that guy's a piece of shit.
Yeah. And it was like, you know what,

2995
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:19,420
it's like,

2996
02:43:19,420 --> 02:43:22,570
it's one thing to be a fan
and it's another thing to
bit pay tribute to do what

2997
02:43:22,571 --> 02:43:24,310
you're doing without,
you know,

2998
02:43:24,311 --> 02:43:27,340
like luckily the true comedy
fans were on him and that was,

2999
02:43:27,370 --> 02:43:29,590
that was really cool that they did that.
I really made me feel good.

3000
02:43:30,170 --> 02:43:31,640
Boss was ridiculous.

3001
02:43:31,641 --> 02:43:36,641
It was like sober boasts and overbearing
offensive and didn't own it at all.

3002
02:43:36,911 --> 02:43:39,980
I was trying to pretend that the whole
thing was completely innocent and

3003
02:43:39,981 --> 02:43:43,970
contribute and you know, and all
aggressive while he's doing it like this.

3004
02:43:44,050 --> 02:43:47,060
You've non artists stop
cause I'm not that good.

3005
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:48,630
But I'll tell you one thing about Patrice.

3006
02:43:48,631 --> 02:43:52,050
If he had lived more fuck up about
that. God Damn, please hop five.

3007
02:43:52,380 --> 02:43:55,890
I got a problem with you man. No,
but I'll just say this, Joe, Patrice,

3008
02:43:55,891 --> 02:43:58,200
if he had lived another five years,

3009
02:43:58,470 --> 02:44:00,690
people would have actually
gotten what he was doing.

3010
02:44:00,750 --> 02:44:04,410
I really do think like he's the guy
who was about to pop. Oh you know,

3011
02:44:04,411 --> 02:44:06,930
I just think, I mean he was
great. He got in his own way,

3012
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:08,460
but he still was like that.
Good.

3013
02:44:08,970 --> 02:44:12,850
Oh he was hilarious. He had this
great fucking joke about when you,

3014
02:44:12,890 --> 02:44:14,640
if you going to be my girlfriend,

3015
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:20,000
you applying for a job and this is the
position that's available to position.

3016
02:44:20,401 --> 02:44:23,010
Well let's see what I got here.
I got,

3017
02:44:23,130 --> 02:44:28,090
I'm open at 2:00 AM for an hour. You Suck
my Dick and I steal your last Snapple.

3018
02:44:29,490 --> 02:44:34,060
Are you interested? Well pitch tablets,
the position, what was the fate of both?

3019
02:44:34,350 --> 02:44:37,500
Oh my God, I love that
pit. It's such a funny bit.

3020
02:44:37,610 --> 02:44:41,310
Cause there you could almost see
Patrice actually saying that to a chick.

3021
02:44:42,030 --> 02:44:45,360
He would not back down. And every,
every comic you've seen now you're like,

3022
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:49,290
what happened to that? Everybody
now is so like, you know, hey man,

3023
02:44:49,291 --> 02:44:51,450
it's very like you know,
nonthreatening,

3024
02:44:51,870 --> 02:44:52,703
got onstage,

3025
02:44:52,770 --> 02:44:56,670
we played it after he died and he got
not on stage whether on television

3026
02:44:56,671 --> 02:44:59,130
defending jokes like tea.

3027
02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:02,820
There was this woman who was talking
about how horrible a joke was and he was

3028
02:45:02,821 --> 02:45:06,780
like, cause you know you ain't coming
from it from the language of funny. Yeah,

3029
02:45:06,781 --> 02:45:10,260
that's right. You don't understand funny.
Like it's all comes from the same place.

3030
02:45:10,261 --> 02:45:12,390
He was trying to be funny.
Yeah it didn't work out.

3031
02:45:12,570 --> 02:45:13,950
But it all comes from the same place.

3032
02:45:14,050 --> 02:45:17,970
The ones that are good and that joke all
comes from the same place and like she

3033
02:45:17,971 --> 02:45:20,270
couldn't understand it and then
you know, she's like, you know,

3034
02:45:20,890 --> 02:45:24,640
and then he did a joke about kicking
a girl, like a pirate style kicker.

3035
02:45:24,641 --> 02:45:28,670
And a and coming in her, I just
hopping around on one leg, one eye

3036
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:34,990
and the lady like didn't
want to laugh but he, no,

3037
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:38,570
he said it on TV like kicking her in the
Shinder Jackie late in her eye and then

3038
02:45:38,571 --> 02:45:40,380
we were like,
oh my God.

3039
02:45:40,590 --> 02:45:44,970
It was the perfect example of something
that's ridiculous and hilarious and you

3040
02:45:44,971 --> 02:45:48,010
know, it's violence against woman.
It's, that's a violence joke.

3041
02:45:48,750 --> 02:45:52,290
That's a joke about kicking a woman and
coming in her eye and it's still funny.

3042
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:55,620
The angry pirate. Oh he's so
funny man. He was so funny.

3043
02:45:56,030 --> 02:45:57,990
So yeah, I do think that
like if he, you know,

3044
02:45:58,010 --> 02:46:01,670
like he was probably one more special
away from like people going like, man,

3045
02:46:01,671 --> 02:46:03,980
this is crazy cause elephant
in the room is a classic,

3046
02:46:04,310 --> 02:46:05,330
I think elephant in the room.

3047
02:46:05,470 --> 02:46:08,860
I think there's a lot of guys that
unfortunately they slipped away.

3048
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:13,610
People knowing about them like kicks
became much more famous after he died was

3049
02:46:13,611 --> 02:46:14,730
when he was alive.
Yeah,

3050
02:46:14,790 --> 02:46:17,160
they used to bother me. Now, it doesn't
bother me at all because I was like,

3051
02:46:17,161 --> 02:46:20,490
at least at least people, you
know, at his stuff, his stuff,

3052
02:46:20,491 --> 02:46:23,310
like there's so much raw stuff and
then there's the actual like great,

3053
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:27,800
great specialists, you know, so you know,
like people like have been like, you know,

3054
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:30,750
they'll talk about the raw stuff and I'm
like, that's cool. They even like that,

3055
02:46:30,751 --> 02:46:33,120
you know, I guess if you're a super
fan and you're like everything,

3056
02:46:33,330 --> 02:46:36,510
who's the first guy that you ever saw
that made you go, I want to be a comic.

3057
02:46:36,850 --> 02:46:40,810
I want to be a comic. I think
it was listening. Um, you know,

3058
02:46:41,450 --> 02:46:44,710
the one, you know, I, I can't think
of like the, I want to be a comic.

3059
02:46:44,711 --> 02:46:49,210
If I put the one guy that I did see
that uh, did make me think like,

3060
02:46:49,240 --> 02:46:51,610
oh my God, that's what a real
comic is, will be Bill Hicks.

3061
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:54,880
I did see him and I had already been doing
it for a little bit where I was like,

3062
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:57,310
you know, I'm doing the open mics.
I'm trying to get the jokes together.

3063
02:46:57,311 --> 02:46:59,610
But then when I saw him do it,
because I already was like,

3064
02:46:59,850 --> 02:47:01,810
like one of those fans where you're like,
you know,

3065
02:47:01,811 --> 02:47:04,240
you don't even want to make eye contact
with the guy because you're like,

3066
02:47:04,241 --> 02:47:07,180
don't want to get into space. You respect
him that much. And I was like, you know,

3067
02:47:07,181 --> 02:47:10,150
when I saw him live I was like,
wow, that that is just it man.

3068
02:47:10,151 --> 02:47:12,370
He was just throwing away jokes
that like you would, you would,

3069
02:47:12,760 --> 02:47:16,960
you would blow a dude for, I mean they
were like, just like, it goes, all right,

3070
02:47:16,961 --> 02:47:20,350
let me just air some stuff out
here. No, it's crowd, his crowd,

3071
02:47:20,620 --> 02:47:23,770
the way he handled the crowd
also maybe like it was cool

3072
02:47:23,880 --> 02:47:25,860
and you probably saw him
when he was sober, right?

3073
02:47:25,980 --> 02:47:28,600
Probably. Yeah. I never,
I never in the Texas days,

3074
02:47:28,810 --> 02:47:33,520
yeah. The sober days were
when he was really putting
in a lot of work and he was,

3075
02:47:33,521 --> 02:47:38,521
he went from a guy who was this wild
drug taking maniacal due to dude who's

3076
02:47:39,671 --> 02:47:42,700
really, really focus on
leaving behind a body of work.

3077
02:47:42,701 --> 02:47:45,280
Like he would talk about that. It's almost
like he knew his time was coming out,

3078
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:48,980
so he was constantly
writing and it was at the,

3079
02:47:49,060 --> 02:47:51,160
he was ahead of the curve
with a lot of ideas.

3080
02:47:51,161 --> 02:47:53,950
There's a lot of ideas that he talked
about during the Bush administration,

3081
02:47:54,100 --> 02:47:59,100
Bush Sr there during that administration
that's totally relevant today as far as

3082
02:48:00,401 --> 02:48:04,750
like jokes about the military and
jokes about, you know, war. And

3083
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:08,930
that was cool that he did that. But
as a comic, that was not my favorite.

3084
02:48:08,931 --> 02:48:13,370
My favorite part was when he was
like in the shit handling the crowd.

3085
02:48:13,371 --> 02:48:17,720
And then the jokes has his jokes, like
the Letterman jokes that like, you know,

3086
02:48:17,721 --> 02:48:21,080
like his first a couple of parents is let
him to judge. You're like, he's Joseph,

3087
02:48:21,081 --> 02:48:24,680
just great. And I like, you're like, this
is what it's about. These jokes. Great.

3088
02:48:24,890 --> 02:48:28,070
And then, you know, you listen
to, uh, I remember like somebody,

3089
02:48:28,520 --> 02:48:31,100
basically we had a tape of his,
I don't even know,

3090
02:48:31,101 --> 02:48:34,020
I don't even remember what it was.
And I was like, wow dude, that,

3091
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:35,540
that is just like his smoking jokes.

3092
02:48:35,541 --> 02:48:38,030
And I was talking about like his
[inaudible] drugs still blow away.

3093
02:48:38,031 --> 02:48:38,864
Everyone else's smoker.

3094
02:48:38,990 --> 02:48:42,110
Well those got ripped off too.
Yeah, those jokes got ripped off.

3095
02:48:42,280 --> 02:48:45,040
And the uh, the whole like, you know,
I like to play tricks, you know,

3096
02:48:45,041 --> 02:48:49,450
the whole thing like a guy and the guy
hits the Pencil. You know that joke,

3097
02:48:49,451 --> 02:48:52,660
like the practical joker joke. I don't
remember that. Oh, that's a great one.

3098
02:48:52,661 --> 02:48:56,530
Where with the, um, you know,
uh, you know, guy pulls out my,

3099
02:48:56,531 --> 02:48:59,350
in high school I was in the class clown,
the guy pulls out my seat,

3100
02:48:59,380 --> 02:49:02,350
I fall down every laugh, so I figured
I'd get them back. So like, you know,

3101
02:49:02,351 --> 02:49:04,750
I whip a pencil, goes
right in his eye, you know,

3102
02:49:04,751 --> 02:49:07,740
he's got an eye patch now and
then another then else happened.

3103
02:49:07,741 --> 02:49:10,830
Then this guy where he pulls out the seat,
breaks his back.

3104
02:49:10,831 --> 02:49:12,510
So like the two of them walking around,

3105
02:49:12,511 --> 02:49:15,650
one of the eyepatch these wheel and the
other guy was like, there he goes to fun.

3106
02:49:15,651 --> 02:49:19,230
He got, I'm butchering the joke. That's
what it is. It's like one of his, like,

3107
02:49:19,231 --> 02:49:23,130
you know, it's one of his takes on like
a classic, like kind of like, you know,

3108
02:49:23,131 --> 02:49:26,610
like mundane topic. And it was just
like seeing that you're like, wow,

3109
02:49:26,611 --> 02:49:28,290
this guy really thinks he really thinks

3110
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:32,690
one of my favorite bits was, uh, when
I'm Clarence Thomas was going, uh,

3111
02:49:32,691 --> 02:49:36,790
in front of a whatever committee to
get them to Supreme Court and they were

3112
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:40,820
investigating the, uh, the,
the whole, um, remember that?

3113
02:49:40,821 --> 02:49:44,870
What was that whole thing where you pubic
hair, cute care and a coke for Anita.

3114
02:49:44,871 --> 02:49:47,980
What was her name? Anita Hill.
Right. It's an Etl. Yeah. Yeah.

3115
02:49:48,350 --> 02:49:50,570
And he had a whole bit about,
uh,

3116
02:49:50,840 --> 02:49:55,220
just it made him realize that he
would never run for office, you know,

3117
02:49:55,221 --> 02:49:59,520
cause all the shit they have. I
miss the Hicks. Yeah, I do know.

3118
02:50:00,020 --> 02:50:04,760
Did you own clam lap as volumes
one through 90. And I was like,

3119
02:50:04,770 --> 02:50:08,030
Whoa, one through 90. I don't recall.
Like you have to listen to the bed.

3120
02:50:08,031 --> 02:50:09,470
I'm not doing it doing,

3121
02:50:09,471 --> 02:50:12,710
it certainly went into this whole
thing about loving pornography.

3122
02:50:12,950 --> 02:50:16,310
It was like a misdirect and they don't
realize like while the misdirect is going

3123
02:50:16,311 --> 02:50:19,430
on that he is still in
front of the committee.

3124
02:50:19,580 --> 02:50:24,020
Oh well thank you for your opinion
Mr. Hicks. But you have to,

3125
02:50:24,050 --> 02:50:26,330
I'm not doing the bit justice.
You've got to listen to it.

3126
02:50:26,331 --> 02:50:28,940
I don't know the exact verbage of it,
but it was fucking awesome.

3127
02:50:29,810 --> 02:50:33,410
And like his special a, which is the one
where he comes out, he's wearing the hat.

3128
02:50:33,440 --> 02:50:37,010
Relentless. I think England. I
thought it was a whatever bay,

3129
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:41,210
Arizona Bang I have just on a bay was
a CD. Is that okay now? I'm sorry.

3130
02:50:41,211 --> 02:50:43,260
Where you remember like what
they think goes up again?

3131
02:50:43,320 --> 02:50:47,750
That where the hat is fire and
he's in England. I don't remember.

3132
02:50:47,751 --> 02:50:50,900
I don't remember. Let's look
it up. But that was a good one.

3133
02:50:51,280 --> 02:50:55,090
Yeah. It was like, I was like, you know,
this fits him. This really does fit him,

3134
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:55,953
you know?

3135
02:50:56,310 --> 02:50:58,200
Yeah.
I'm talking about,

3136
02:50:58,360 --> 02:50:59,590
you know,
theater versus club.

3137
02:50:59,591 --> 02:51:02,820
Cause like I also consider him
like a rock hard club clawback.

3138
02:51:03,070 --> 02:51:05,200
Well that was when he went to England.

3139
02:51:05,230 --> 02:51:09,000
He became way more famous than
he ever recovered him. Yeah.

3140
02:51:09,050 --> 02:51:12,070
Cause people here could give a shit.
Yeah, I know, right. It was weird.

3141
02:51:12,370 --> 02:51:14,830
Well then you know,
the whole leary thing,

3142
02:51:15,410 --> 02:51:19,160
but also Letterman also like his first
couple of appearances on Letterman, like,

3143
02:51:19,161 --> 02:51:22,190
you know, I was in college
or something like that. I was
like, wow, this is really,

3144
02:51:22,580 --> 02:51:23,740
this guy's amazing,
you know?

3145
02:51:23,990 --> 02:51:27,280
Yeah. And his w Denis Leary's
in his Wikipedia page. Ooh.

3146
02:51:27,560 --> 02:51:28,850
That's when you know you fucked up.

3147
02:51:29,900 --> 02:51:34,460
You wind up in the Hicks Wikipedia
page and not flatteringly.

3148
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:39,170
Uh Oh yeah. What did Daddy, oh, I
remember that contrast revelations. Yeah.

3149
02:51:39,171 --> 02:51:43,400
It was revelations. Remember
I saw it live. You did? Yeah.

3150
02:51:43,430 --> 02:51:47,150
Leary was my favorite comedian for like
six months. I thought leary was awesome.

3151
02:51:47,360 --> 02:51:49,630
Then I saw hex and I was like,
what the fuck is going on here?

3152
02:51:49,660 --> 02:51:51,020
Why am I seeing the same jokes?

3153
02:51:51,350 --> 02:51:55,520
And then I got all the information for
everybody else and I was like, wow,

3154
02:51:55,550 --> 02:51:57,620
that was hard.
That's fine as well.

3155
02:51:57,621 --> 02:52:00,380
Especially when I was telling everybody
how great leary was, you know,

3156
02:52:00,630 --> 02:52:02,570
very would murder dude.
Oh my God.

3157
02:52:02,900 --> 02:52:06,530
Back in those days in Boston
and the Boston area. Yeah. Yeah.

3158
02:52:06,531 --> 02:52:11,440
And the Boston Boston days, it
was, you know, it was just a,

3159
02:52:11,441 --> 02:52:12,760
it was a sad thing to say.

3160
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:17,680
It's sad when you think of guys just
this genius thinker and then you find out

3161
02:52:17,681 --> 02:52:21,910
he's a parrot. You know, it's just taking
somebody else's things towards that,

3162
02:52:21,911 --> 02:52:23,530
right? Oh yeah. Yeah. It was brutal.

3163
02:52:23,531 --> 02:52:27,610
I mean he's on this Wikipedia page
for a fucking reason, man. You know,

3164
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:28,953
it's not,

3165
02:52:30,120 --> 02:52:33,640
it's just no cure for cancer
or word that I don't know. Man.

3166
02:52:33,641 --> 02:52:36,100
I don't even really want to talk about
because I've talked about him so many

3167
02:52:36,101 --> 02:52:39,310
times and he got angry that I did before.
But Hey man,

3168
02:52:39,311 --> 02:52:41,500
it is what it is and he
doesn't want to address it.

3169
02:52:41,501 --> 02:52:45,430
But it's a part of comedy history. It
just does. There's no getting around it.

3170
02:52:46,150 --> 02:52:49,210
Especially with a guy like, hey, cause
it was just such an innovator man.

3171
02:52:49,211 --> 02:52:51,130
He was such a unique style.

3172
02:52:51,131 --> 02:52:55,180
And then he was a guy who changed comedy
a lot of ways because he opened up a

3173
02:52:55,181 --> 02:52:56,350
whole new door for people.

3174
02:52:56,380 --> 02:52:59,230
Kennison did to Kennison opened
up a whole new door comedy.

3175
02:52:59,330 --> 02:53:01,520
The Kennison now is,
is the guy that I wish,

3176
02:53:01,550 --> 02:53:03,200
I think we talked about this
the last time, when was like,

3177
02:53:03,230 --> 02:53:04,640
that's the one guy wish I saw live.

3178
02:53:04,641 --> 02:53:06,920
I really do like of all
the people I never saw him.

3179
02:53:07,340 --> 02:53:10,910
I really wish I had seen that, that
just that power. Like I would, I would,

3180
02:53:11,450 --> 02:53:13,300
I would be the guy like let's call you.
Okay.

3181
02:53:13,360 --> 02:53:16,510
Cha and I mean like I wouldn't be, you
know, like if when I would want to see,

3182
02:53:16,730 --> 02:53:18,410
oh,
the whole like deal,

3183
02:53:18,411 --> 02:53:23,060
like the whole like rough comedy
store show would be the best.

3184
02:53:23,061 --> 02:53:24,680
Like before he was famous or something.

3185
02:53:24,710 --> 02:53:26,980
Yeah. That would be the
time to see him. The, yeah.

3186
02:53:26,990 --> 02:53:28,280
Probably right before he's famous.

3187
02:53:28,310 --> 02:53:31,540
I got to see him after he was famous
and just wasn't, was that good?

3188
02:53:31,750 --> 02:53:35,960
Was it a stadium show or to act, you
know, like really quickly after his, uh,

3189
02:53:36,320 --> 02:53:40,010
after his HBO special who was on the
road, he couldn't do the same jokes. He's,

3190
02:53:40,011 --> 02:53:42,110
everybody knew them.
So we had to come up with a whole new act.

3191
02:53:42,530 --> 02:53:46,220
And just it's too much party and,
and coke and, but like I've said,

3192
02:53:46,290 --> 02:53:49,820
the chickens coming out with
it, the twins. And he would
call people at the end.

3193
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:52,280
Yeah, Paul Guy's girlfriend. You fuck it.

3194
02:53:54,110 --> 02:53:55,460
He was a phone on stage.

3195
02:53:55,620 --> 02:53:58,470
He was the first comic I ever
saw. Talk about like, you know,

3196
02:53:58,890 --> 02:54:01,740
you know party and people, I'm
doing this, I'm doing that,

3197
02:54:01,741 --> 02:54:05,750
but I'm doing it for the material. I'm
doing it for you people. All right.

3198
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:08,490
Remember that when I'm balls deep like,
but that was like,

3199
02:54:08,550 --> 02:54:11,340
that's the first time I ever heard of
comic actually on stage talking about

3200
02:54:11,341 --> 02:54:15,000
writing material because like none of
them ever would talk about that, you know?

3201
02:54:15,001 --> 02:54:17,070
And then like finally he was
like the guy who would say it,

3202
02:54:17,071 --> 02:54:19,610
even though it was part of his,
his kind of like drug joke.

3203
02:54:19,620 --> 02:54:22,760
It was still funny to hear like wow,
he writes material too.

3204
02:54:24,070 --> 02:54:26,700
David tell we're out of time. That's
it. We're going to turn into a pumpkin.
