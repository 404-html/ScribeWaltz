1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,880
The joe rogan experience
and I've known you forever.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,330
I knew you back when you were having
a real hard time with standup,

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,920
which to me is fascinating because you
the only guy that I've ever met that was

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:15,290
having like a really hard time with
standup and then add a nowhere.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,710
Like you hit a switch.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,810
You went from having a hard time with
stand up to Beano fucking murderer.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,973
We would,

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,730
it was almost like you like you fucking
pass through a doorway or something.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,480
Like within two years of
you working at the store,

10
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:34,980
you just figured it out is figured it
out one night and we were up on stage and

11
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:37,020
we're were in the back rather
and you were up on stage.

12
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:40,740
We were watching you go like Damn
Joey Diaz just turn a fucking corner.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,390
You just figured out how to be funny.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,400
You figured out who you were up there.

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,430
It's really weird when
you get into anything.

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,770
There's always the Jesus of the improving.

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,400
Yeah.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,141
Of coming here,

19
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:52,974
I'm showing up,

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,460
this is just isn't working,

21
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,750
and then one day out of
the fucking blue pop pow.

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,020
It just starts working and it's
really weird with stand up.

23
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,670
You don't want to go to sleep,

24
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,760
you want to go home and
keep riding and riding.

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,780
And then I became infatuated from 95 to
[inaudible] 98 but I had so many other

26
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:14,230
things going on.

27
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,001
You know what I'm saying?

28
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:19,420
I had so many fucking things going
on that I couldn't really focus,

29
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:23,830
focus and then I moved to La and
I had all of these distractions.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,730
You have all these stupid distractions
when you first moved to La and you're a

31
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:29,980
comic age and sees this,

32
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:30,731
that this,

33
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:31,480
that,

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,620
and then one day you just,

35
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:33,940
something hits you and it goes,

36
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:35,470
these motherfuckers don't matter.

37
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,300
Nothing really matters.

38
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,260
I've got to go up there and speak what's
in my heart and you just start going

39
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,670
and little by little,

40
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:45,100
once you find your voice
you become a savage.

41
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,911
That's it.

42
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:46,630
It's like a,

43
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,130
it's like a shark tasting blood.

44
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:49,210
It's like anything else.

45
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,740
When you get that taste,

46
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,450
you just go after it and,

47
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:55,120
and you know the comedy store's
the fucking comedy store man.

48
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,770
Once you get into comedy store.

49
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:58,420
To me that's like,

50
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:00,070
you know John [inaudible],

51
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,240
that's the comedy store,

52
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,180
John Jacques Machado.

53
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,060
It's those up a high level that that's it.

54
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,290
It's a high level but
especially in the two thousands

55
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,540
down there there was,

56
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,650
there was a some intense comedy
that was going on for your company.

57
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,140
Ari coming up there and
you coming up there,

58
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,880
it was a really intense time

59
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,381
and you,

60
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:22,640
you go on stage and you get this.

61
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:26,510
We had confidence that
it's this fucking thing.

62
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:30,440
You just get stronger and stronger and
the more people you go up in front of it

63
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,230
because then in the beginning they
make you go up in front of people.

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,800
You know,

65
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,880
going up in front of Mitzi shore is nerve
wracking and going on after they put

66
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:40,970
you on after a lot of guys that were
really fun and you're going up in front of

67
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:41,571
Mitzi shore,

68
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:46,130
you have no idea what that does to
you at the six year mark going up.

69
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,510
I cannot describe it.

70
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:51,500
I've thought about it and I've written
about that experience thousands of times

71
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,100
and nothing was more like I blacked out.

72
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,340
I had a blackout to go in front of Mitzi
shore because I knew it was it for a

73
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,890
guy like me and Mitzi
shore turned me down.

74
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,593
You know what?

75
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,060
I was going to go back to boulder,

76
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,270
probably stab one of those
motherfuckers without come out.

77
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,751
I would just,

78
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,090
when you getting out now I would
have been institutionalized.

79
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,380
There's no turning back from that.

80
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,270
It would have crushed my ego.

81
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:17,104
Her,

82
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,130
her taking me gave me another
five year reprieve in my life.

83
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,940
I knew I got something to do for five
more years before I go to jail for killing

84
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:25,421
somebody.

85
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,440
Like that's how I fell.

86
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,980
Did you really feel like
you're going to do that?

87
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:28,661
Because when I met you,

88
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:29,520
I never got that from,

89
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:29,850
yeah.

90
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,683
Yeah.

91
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,920
That's one part of the part of the,

92
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,590
the,

93
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:33,951
the,

94
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:37,900
the jump in my comedy was the day
I wrote her the letter and I said,

95
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,020
you can't scam me no more.

96
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:39,800
He want to take the kid,

97
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,820
take the fuck am I gonna fucking road.

98
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,870
You're talking about you called
her up one day and told him,

99
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,000
yeah,

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,833
I told her that,

101
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,430
you know,

102
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,620
that at the end of the
day and I was being this,

103
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,261
you know,

104
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,080
some people really can't handle the truth
and sometimes you have to tell them,

105
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,310
and I had a talk to her and then talk to
her again in [inaudible] 99 when I took

106
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:57,881
that change,

107
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:01,810
it was around 2000 and you met me in
[inaudible] 97 it took me about three

108
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:02,021
years,

109
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:04,840
but one day in [inaudible]
99 before I went to bed,

110
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:06,310
I was clean for a couple of days,

111
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,330
maybe three days.

112
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,220
And I went to bed early and I had my,

113
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:09,761
which to me,

114
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,091
and I said,

115
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,710
I'm not going to fuck with this no more.

116
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,070
It was one of these things that I
was going into the lion's mouth.

117
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,610
I had a walk on a fine line
with her because I wanted
to be a part of that kid's

118
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:21,071
life,

119
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:24,790
but it wasn't looking that
way and I wasn't gonna take
her shit no more than one

120
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,610
morning I got up mice in her room and I
went and got a calling card and I call

121
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:31,750
that motherfucker and I just laid it out
to her and I told her the opening line

122
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:31,931
was,

123
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:32,531
I'll never forget this,

124
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:34,390
that listen between you and I,

125
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,350
and she knew me.

126
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,670
I said,

127
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,181
you know,

128
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,490
if you want to fire,

129
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,520
I would not pass on you.

130
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,510
Only contact I'm having with
you is because of this child.

131
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,470
So I pay for a separate phone in her
room and I don't have to talk to you no

132
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:48,304
more.

133
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,370
Cause she wanted what was killing me at
that time when she wanted to take and

134
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,510
change the child's name.

135
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,180
And my position was when my father died,

136
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,140
my mom remarried.

137
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,060
My poor dad that died.

138
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,260
I had to keep his fucking name.

139
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,610
That was just something in my heart,

140
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,170
so I always felt that that's let her
become 18 I have to decide what the fuck

141
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,770
she wants to write that was eating
away at me and when they add no value,

142
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,880
a name didn't have a value to me and this
whole situation didn't have a valid to

143
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:13,600
me.

144
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,190
Once I analyzed it and said,

145
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:17,500
fuck this bitch and what she stands for,

146
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,250
I turned that corner because
I dropped luggage off.

147
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,740
There's nothing sometimes in comedy,

148
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,900
sometimes in life you're just
carrying around some luggage,

149
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:26,141
man,

150
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:27,220
it doesn't let you move.

151
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,110
The box is five feet,

152
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,400
but the door is only three.

153
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,170
Sorry motherfucker and you got to drop
that shit until you dropped that fucking

154
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:35,660
box.

155
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,880
You ain't going to go through that door.

156
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,940
Too many people get locked
into those relationships,

157
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,560
whether they're friendships,

158
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,050
friendships with former ex,

159
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,910
ex wife and husband,

160
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,950
whatever you want to call
that relationship axes.

161
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,610
But they're like to deer with
their fucking horns locked
together and they can't

162
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:55,540
separate and they fucking every game a
push pull they fuck with each other on

163
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,374
purpose.

164
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:56,771
You know,

165
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,100
I've known people that went through

166
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,570
horrible divorces where,

167
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,021
you know,

168
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,270
you could tell that like they would,

169
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,820
they would like be setting
up each other like,

170
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:05,061
you know,

171
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:05,721
fuck him,

172
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,860
make him pay more,

173
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,510
you know,

174
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,760
uh,

175
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,210
let's,

176
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,040
let's agree to one thing
and then change the terms.

177
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:10,460
Just keep,

178
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,660
keep the bills coming in.

179
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,231
And like,

180
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,490
I've heard people talk like

181
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,710
it's a horror show.

182
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:15,350
It's crazy.

183
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,970
Very,

184
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,600
and this is,

185
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,010
this was the bad end of the Joe that this
is the already add the job in boulder

186
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:23,530
that paid the most fit an
educated schmuck like me.

187
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,850
I was working for a sports adviser and
that you can make anywhere from 20 to

188
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:29,590
60,000 to football seasons,

189
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,483
six months.

190
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,460
You can make some cases.

191
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,313
That's insane.

192
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,940
There were some guys that
make a hundred grand.

193
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:34,450
That was,

194
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,650
I had a month in December.

195
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:37,810
I made 25 grand working
in the fucking phones.

196
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,520
You just got to get some fish.

197
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,860
Tibetans send you money.

198
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,380
Believe that is,

199
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,830
you're going to take them
through the fucking bowl season.

200
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,641
Listen Bro,

201
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:49,150
you want to make 50 it's going to
cost you 20 go to Western Union.

202
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:51,820
Send me 20,000 and we'll
talk about sending.

203
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,850
So they're basically buying your
knowledge on your knowledge,

204
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:56,080
but you have buying your bullshit.

205
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,250
It's bad Karma also.

206
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,760
Really?

207
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,780
But this is what I was doing,

208
00:06:58,781 --> 00:06:59,800
so I knew this,

209
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,460
I knew this.

210
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,130
Aren't they come to la
but see short old pass me.

211
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,110
Maybe the Improv pass has been,

212
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,370
but my dream was Mitzi shore.

213
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:07,300
Who the fuck are you kidding?

214
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,130
My whole thing was the store from day
one people told me to go to the fucking

215
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,330
store and that's your house.

216
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,410
That was my fate.

217
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,670
If she turned me down,

218
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,170
I would have probably
gone back to Colorado.

219
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,490
Probably gotten to work over there.

220
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,401
You know,

221
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:19,750
you,

222
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,370
you done sets in Seattle,

223
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:23,740
you were doing and I couldn't
go back to go to Seattle.

224
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,020
I would've gone back to
Colorado and tried to be a dad.

225
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:27,130
And one day ago,

226
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,410
I know me one fucking day,

227
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:30,880
the car breaks down,

228
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,360
the snow went out.

229
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,980
You get one of those bill's
overdue bill and that's it.

230
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,280
You bump into this fucking book and it
gives you that attitude with his flip

231
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:40,114
flops on.

232
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,800
I was going to run over
this motherfucking,

233
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,210
I was gonna do 50 fucking years.

234
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,160
So you know what,

235
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:46,000
as much as I,

236
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,320
the comedy store has that much power in
my life that her parents came along at

237
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:50,760
the right time,

238
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,850
came along at the right time.

239
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,440
Do you think the people create that?

240
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:54,350
I mean that's like the big,

241
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,481
the big hippy,

242
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:56,314
new age,

243
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:56,940
uh,

244
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,920
argument about lives that you
create these possibilities in life,

245
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,760
that you,

246
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,540
you're responsible for all these
different events that are happening too.

247
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,660
They're not random events.

248
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:08,830
These are events that are sort of
created by your own intentions.

249
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,430
Yes.

250
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,350
Do you feel that sometimes,

251
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,333
absolutely.

252
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,090
One thing I learned was that
till you take responsibility,

253
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:16,050
you ain't gonna move forward.

254
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,540
There's mother fuckers
that get off the stage.

255
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,880
The audience sucks.

256
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:25,710
The sound that I watched
a guy eat the pie.

257
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,900
Fuck Shit.

258
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,070
Never quite fucking bombed.

259
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,490
Yeah.

260
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,323
And that's it.

261
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,410
And everything else.

262
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,620
And until you come through
that you can't really,

263
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,650
and that was big for me
that I believe that it,

264
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,950
listen,

265
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,730
I go to bed now,

266
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,181
I go home,

267
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:39,931
I put my feet up,

268
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:42,330
I watch the news and I
go to bed like nothing.

269
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:42,720
You know,

270
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,400
20 years ago I didn't
go to bed like nothing.

271
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,150
I had to shut my window a
certain way and close my door,

272
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,571
shut away.

273
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:52,180
And I couldn't leave the light on at
night because I owed money to a drug deal.

274
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:53,340
I robbed somebody.

275
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,320
I created all those scenarios,

276
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,130
didn't,

277
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,960
I didn't make that kidnapping up.

278
00:08:57,961 --> 00:08:58,920
I went there with a gun.

279
00:08:58,921 --> 00:08:59,760
I knew that I was doing,

280
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,830
but it's funny that how quick the
turnaround was between like 99 you know,

281
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,730
like it's,

282
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:07,110
it all just sort of stopped.

283
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,660
It all stopped luggage
and it kept stopping.

284
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,651
You know,

285
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,170
it kept stopping and keep getting better.

286
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,200
What you're telling me is that I never
did blog at after 2006 that's you're

287
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,210
trying to tell me who me.

288
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,320
That's you're trying to tell me.

289
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,263
Why would you say that?

290
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,510
The weirdest way to phrase that sentence.

291
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,650
I haven't done Boston.

292
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,790
One day I went home,

293
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,800
one day I went home with a chick.

294
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,140
So one day I went home and
just stopped doing book.

295
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,200
That's what you're trying to tell me.

296
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,043
That was done that again.

297
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,180
I'm saying about being a criminal.

298
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,340
No,

299
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,401
no,

300
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:38,520
no,

301
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:38,820
no.

302
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,230
I'm busting your balls.

303
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,080
I can't believe what
I'm fucking telling you.

304
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,600
That's nice.

305
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,260
2006 one day I went,

306
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,550
oh Brian.

307
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,310
One day I went home and
just stopped doing cocaine.

308
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,660
No Rehab,

309
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:52,470
no hug.

310
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,640
I didn't call nobody.

311
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,020
I didn't piss my ear.

312
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,560
I didn't give my life to our the Oba game.

313
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,790
There was none of that shit.

314
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,110
He'll,

315
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:00,480
okay,

316
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,710
whatever the fuck that shit is,

317
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,421
he never go.

318
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:03,254
It was nothing,

319
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,721
whatever,

320
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:04,050
the Pho,

321
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,560
but game,

322
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,480
whatever the fuck that shit is.

323
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,080
So my point is that what
happened was I dropped,

324
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,630
I kept dropping the pain that I
had and that luggage that I add,

325
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:13,464
I forced it out.

326
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,050
I just didn't fucking stop doing drugs.

327
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,410
I overcame whatever it was
making me do those fucking drugs.

328
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,570
Society wasn't making me do drugs.

329
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,560
Obamacare.

330
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,131
How funny is that?

331
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:26,100
They found heroin in the
Bronx with Obamacare envelope.

332
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:26,934
Austin,

333
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,310
Boston man hysteric instead,

334
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,900
Obamacare on it was on heroin.

335
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,890
Obamacare,

336
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,960
like people would just let everything,

337
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,020
we create everything in a lot of wings,

338
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,190
and this is random things
that happen as well,

339
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:41,360
right?

340
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,071
Because I broke this.

341
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:45,210
Sometimes people wake up on
the wrong side of fucking bed.

342
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,480
They come at you and you got to stand
your fucking ground and you got to say no

343
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,490
bitch that people get their feelings hurt.

344
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,300
Yes,

345
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,080
but no,

346
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,390
I created a lot of the shit
that happened in my life.

347
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:55,350
There's no fucking way.

348
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,330
You also have to stop silliness or it'll
invade your life and ruin your quality

349
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:01,840
of life if you don't get you get upset

350
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,171
at people.

351
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:06,070
Sometimes there's times where people are
infringing on your happiness with your

352
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:07,180
bullshit bullshit.

353
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,991
And you're like,

354
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:08,561
listen man,

355
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:10,960
you need to learn your
own for your own good.

356
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,780
You need to learn that what you're
doing is like socially unacceptable.

357
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,021
You're,

358
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,790
you're passing it off on other people.

359
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:20,120
You're passing off this shitty reality
that you're trying to promote something

360
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,441
you,

361
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:22,510
you can get locked in a person like that,

362
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:23,261
as we were saying before,

363
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:25,120
with like bad relationships
and then all of a sudden,

364
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:28,300
like every day you're dealing
with this person's nonsense,

365
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,400
distortions and lies.

366
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:31,730
And it can never trust.

367
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
Like who was it your fault.

368
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:33,241
No,

369
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:34,120
it's never your fault,

370
00:11:34,121 --> 00:11:34,341
right?

371
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:35,141
And it's never your fault.

372
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,190
It's always somebody else's fault.

373
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,340
And when you deal with people like that
on a regular basis and you communicate

374
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:40,174
with people like that,

375
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,470
it makes it incredibly difficult for
you to live your life because you're

376
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:45,304
constantly,

377
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,540
you're constantly like debating
or dismissing bullshit.

378
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,131
Like,

379
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:50,831
is this bullshit?

380
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:51,664
It might be bullshit.

381
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,870
And then somewhere along the line,

382
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:54,430
you fuck this man,

383
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,290
I got to stop hanging
out with this person.

384
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,490
This person's an asshole.

385
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,360
You know,

386
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,280
that person doesn't give
a fuck about the truth.

387
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:01,510
They don't give a fuck about me.

388
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,290
That is,

389
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,300
and I've had a few of those in my life.

390
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,490
And you just cut them loose
and when you cut them loose,

391
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,020
like you're a way better person,

392
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,530
you like your life is free and easy.

393
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:09,820
And I'm like,

394
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,930
oh,

395
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,801
it's not that.

396
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm like constantly engage in conflict.

397
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,800
It's that if you surround yourself
with the wrong kind of people,

398
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,770
you will be constantly
engaged in conflict.

399
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:23,320
Whether you want it or whether
you have that intention or not.

400
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,690
Like it's not just about
having the right intentions,

401
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,330
you gotta make the right choices
as to who you put in your world.

402
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,690
Because if you put a bunch of shitheads
that don't care about evolving,

403
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,980
they don't care about getting it together.

404
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:35,110
And all the trying to do is
pass off of nonsense on you.

405
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,843
Oh,

406
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,200
you've got to fucking,

407
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,400
you got a Shitty road.

408
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,660
You've got a Shitty road ahead of you

409
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,360
did.

410
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,410
I used to love guns?

411
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,320
I wasn't a gun up like your buddy,

412
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:46,340
but I loved guns.

413
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,300
I loved having them.

414
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,253
I love them.

415
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,821
And the same thing.

416
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:50,720
One day I was like,

417
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,240
every time I carry a
gun there's a problem.

418
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,461
Yes.

419
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:56,600
Put that out there almost.

420
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:56,960
Right?

421
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,590
It's like a magnet for other guns and
you're not the only one that says that.

422
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,311
It's like a magnet.

423
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,690
I'm telling you when I carried a gun,

424
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:05,750
I carry the Gulf for a very short
time because I didn't like it.

425
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,040
I didn't see the purpose for it.

426
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,220
It's a nice thing could use
to try to be a tough guy,

427
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:12,980
but all it's going to do is
get you a fucking trouble.

428
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:16,540
Cause you pull that motherfucker wanting
motherfuckers going to pull their mind.

429
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,930
You that real tough guys.

430
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,580
And I knew that going in.

431
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,600
I fucking knew it.

432
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,460
I wanted to fire it at somebody.

433
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,110
But I tell you what man,

434
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:25,940
it was amazing how he used
to go home at night and go,

435
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:27,740
what the fuck just happened tonight?

436
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,400
Why did I have to go from my
reach for my gun through it?

437
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,690
Why were they six other people in
the room and a coke party with guns?

438
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,370
Because guns attract.

439
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,830
They're like fucking magnets.

440
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,190
And one day I got rid of all those guns.

441
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,020
It was like I lost 80
fucking pounds of drama.

442
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,970
The same thing 10 years ago,

443
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,620
this phone would be ringing with people
that were asking me questions about,

444
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,700
you know,

445
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,990
how do you get roadwork?

446
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,890
You know,

447
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,630
why don't you take me on the fucking road?

448
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:57,471
You know,

449
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:01,430
you can all these fucking people calling
you with these questions and at the

450
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,010
same time they have low concern for you.

451
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,330
They really don't.

452
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,560
They're just trying to pull you down,

453
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,690
especially in this fucking town.

454
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,020
If you let people pull you down,

455
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,820
but I don't know what you're doing.

456
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:11,810
It's not happening for me.

457
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:12,231
What do you want?

458
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:13,070
What do you want me to do?

459
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,680
You got like right and get
on stage every fucking night.

460
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,740
What'd you do as well?

461
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,960
I went to my sister's wedding.

462
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:18,890
Well go fuck your mother.

463
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,360
Then go to the fucking wedding.

464
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,660
You were one of the last guys that picking
that out to you were one of the best

465
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:24,150
guys.

466
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,150
Birds might fucking core that people
come up to you and put their lack of Vr.

467
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,830
That I saw somebody,

468
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,880
but I started comedy with
at the store 13 years ago.

469
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,870
I was going to screen or some
stupid movie that my buddy was in.

470
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,140
My wife was sleeping.

471
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:40,271
I said,

472
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:41,104
let me go down there.

473
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,700
And as I was walking around the corner,

474
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:43,821
her,

475
00:14:43,821 --> 00:14:46,060
Joey and I went up and I go,

476
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,060
I didn't even know who was.

477
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,420
And he was telling me what he
was doing in front of their,

478
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,254
and he was,

479
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,043
you hear about us.

480
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,650
Well,

481
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,520
and he was telling me,

482
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:55,891
you know,

483
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:57,290
what he was doing there and what he was,

484
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,160
where he was working.

485
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,030
And I drove back to fucking studio city
with like tears in my eyes because he

486
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,080
had every opportunity that I had.

487
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,390
He was a good luck and knew when
he moved to this fucking town.

488
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:09,831
But the ham,

489
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,610
he used to go to the store and
drank and everything was high.

490
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,380
And now I'm supposed to feel guilty on
the fucking one o one cause this fucking

491
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:21,290
schmucks got a job working until
fucking two in the morning.

492
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,150
Parking cars or something,

493
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,290
you know,

494
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,650
I mean,

495
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,510
we all had the same opportunities here.

496
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:26,781
Well,

497
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:29,090
there's people that feel like those
people in your life to teach you that

498
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:29,510
lesson.

499
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,710
To see people fail and have regrets and
see people not give 100% or not give it

500
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:35,720
all their focus or give
it all their honesty,

501
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,500
you know,

502
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,861
give it,

503
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:38,480
give it who the fuck you really are.

504
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,370
We see those people and that regret is
almost there to let us know like don't

505
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,130
ever let that happen.

506
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,630
As I was getting in my car,

507
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:48,660
he made a coat and he
was one of those guys.

508
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:51,090
I always had to have that
one comment that the store,

509
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,730
they may like a fucking comment.

510
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,700
I just want to say
something about something.

511
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,580
It must have been nice to
them blow all those years,

512
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,780
like something just,

513
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,651
you know what I'm saying?

514
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:03,960
Like he's one of those guys that
he's going to pull you down,

515
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,440
right?

516
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,000
He had a,

517
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,450
and I just got in the car and I said,

518
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:06,721
you know,

519
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:10,650
this is why that guy's
parking cars and you know,

520
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,680
I'm on the fucking road work and at
least trying to make things happen.

521
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,050
This is why this guy's parking.

522
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,670
Fucking

523
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,810
there was a guy that I want to,

524
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:17,680
I won't mention his name,

525
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:18,071
but you,

526
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:18,181
uh,

527
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:20,020
you had warned me about
him a long time ago,

528
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,730
long before it ever went real bad form.

529
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,460
And then one time I was back in the east
coast and the guy hadn't done comedy

530
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:28,000
and he fucking the couple of years and
he's like trying to get ahold of me to

531
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:28,834
open up for me.

532
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,350
Like,

533
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,890
what are you just,

534
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,890
you just got to get back on stage after
a couple of years and open up at the big

535
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:33,460
show.

536
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,400
Like really that's where you're
going to do a Yeti fucking mind.

537
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,480
Like what kind of weird request is that
you have an uncommon in two years you

538
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,760
want to go up and a in
front of a sold out club.

539
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,510
Like that's,

540
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,470
that's ridiculous.

541
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,870
Like why would you think that you
could just do that like you get,

542
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,853
but that's what they,

543
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,800
there's a lot of guys that didn't make
any comedy that felt like they didn't

544
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,910
make it because nobody helped him.

545
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,640
And I've heard that so many times.

546
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,630
I've heard that stupid argument like I
wasn't there when the right group or if

547
00:16:58,631 --> 00:16:59,770
you're not in with the right group.

548
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:01,030
It's very hard to get roadwork like,

549
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:01,990
what are you talking about?

550
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,520
What do you all you
have to do is be funny.

551
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,151
If you're funny,

552
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:04,984
people find you.

553
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,470
It's,

554
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,480
it's one of the easiest
businesses of all time.

555
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,970
You get proven onstage for sure.

556
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,990
Easiest to understand.

557
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,220
This is how easy it works.

558
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,240
You'll go onstage,

559
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,740
you get to people to laugh,

560
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:15,574
people notice.

561
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,690
Then they started offering your work.

562
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,703
It's that simple.

563
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,970
When you prove that you have a certain
amount of time and you prove that you can

564
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:23,470
consistently perform really well.

565
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,880
People want to give you some work.

566
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,751
They give you a little here,

567
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:26,620
they give you a little there.

568
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,180
You make some connections,

569
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,110
you start networking.

570
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,150
The next thing you know you started,

571
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,610
you know,

572
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,440
moving in your area a little bit,

573
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:35,820
getting a few gigs here and there and
it takes fucking years and you've got to

574
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,400
keep doing it.

575
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,270
If you don't keep doing it,

576
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:38,290
then you really didn't want to do it.

577
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,580
But if you do keep doing it,

578
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:42,400
you get to a point where you're Joey
Diaz and if you're one of those guys that

579
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:43,360
didn't really want to do it,

580
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,740
and one day you see Joey Diaz and he said,

581
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,950
it moves been good folk.

582
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,160
Do Cocoa lose yours.

583
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,441
You're there.

584
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,160
You're like a living

585
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,880
lesson.

586
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,900
Like that guy's like a little,

587
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,480
a little stop on your journey.

588
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,660
I broke my foot book,

589
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,430
it broke my on the drive home.

590
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:56,851
I was like,

591
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:57,684
wow.

592
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,850
And when I had the same opportunities,

593
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:01,350
we both walked into that store,

594
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,970
he used to get spots,

595
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,673
he was good.

596
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,000
He was decent.

597
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,020
Yeah.

598
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,190
Showed potential whatever,

599
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,320
nine o'clock spots,

600
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,650
a couple of belly room spots,

601
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,970
and now you're out here fucking 11
o'clock at night and you're like,

602
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:15,804
wow.

603
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,320
Yeah.
