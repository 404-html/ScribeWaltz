1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,170
The joe rogan experience here reminded
me of when you talked about grabbing them

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,460
in the laundry basket.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,010
Do you remember back in Boston?

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,840
You were out one night with Jennifer
and I was home and I swear to God on my

5
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:13,890
father's grave,

6
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:14,724
this happened.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,410
I rented Batman,

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,640
the blockbuster.

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,103
Uh,

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,690
and I put it in and I'm sitting
at home and I'm watching it.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,891
And then,

12
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:23,190
uh,

13
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,730
all of a sudden I see this shadow and
then I turned my head and I see another

14
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:31,020
shadow and I look up and there's
a bat flying around the apartment.

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:31,951
And I'm like,

16
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:32,281
what?

17
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:32,571
And I,

18
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:35,340
I'm scared shitless of bats.

19
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,910
Like,

20
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,840
it's like my thing.

21
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,780
And it's like ever since I was a kid,

22
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:42,750
my aunt had this barn near her and they
had bats and they would be telling me

23
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,590
they were fruit bats.

24
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:44,401
And if they bite you,

25
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:46,020
you'll get rabies and you'll die.

26
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,270
And,

27
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,710
and so,

28
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,950
and we would always be outside playing
tag at night and I would fucking,

29
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:51,560
bats would fly by and I'd freak out.

30
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:52,020
And,

31
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,850
and so I'm alone in the apartment and
as a bat flying around and Batman is on

32
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:57,684
TV.

33
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,500
And so,

34
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,310
uh,

35
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,660
all I knew is they go in your hair,

36
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,340
which I think is like not even true.

37
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,670
So I put on a baseball cap backwards
and I had on sunglasses and a tennis

38
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:08,530
racket.

39
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,330
I'm glad I didn't want to go into my eyes.

40
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,643
He's going to go for,

41
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,640
so I'm running around the apartment
swinging at him and he's taken off.

42
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:20,430
He's like,

43
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:20,761
you know,

44
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,300
he's just,

45
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,050
they're erratic,

46
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,611
the way they fly.

47
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:23,820
You don't know where
they're fucking going.

48
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,270
And this goes on for like 10 minutes
and then there's like a standoff and I'm

49
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:27,870
waiting.

50
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,770
And then I hear you coming up the stairs
and you came in and you open the door

51
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:32,400
and you go,

52
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,360
what the fuck are you doing?

53
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,920
And I get this a bad in here.

54
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,821
And you just,

55
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,950
you just grab the tennis
racket out of my hand.

56
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:41,760
And he walked up and he was in the window
and you just bashed him once and he

57
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:42,840
just went down.

58
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,780
And then you just walked over and you had
taken your hand and you just went into

59
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,040
the kitchen and start eating it.

60
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,810
I'm standing there with sunglasses and I,

61
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:49,644
Ana,

62
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,420
I remember that.

63
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,430
That's hilarious.

64
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,260
You have to gauge at any given,

65
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,900
in any given interaction
with the audience,

66
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:02,220
you gauge who that you got to
fucking figure it out fast.

67
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,940
Are they gonna,

68
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,410
are they gonna charge the stage?

69
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,690
Are they going to keep heckling
or are they going to leave you?

70
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,340
Gotta you gotta tear it out.

71
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,740
Ditches and Boston's,

72
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:12,480
you got physically attacked.

73
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,000
You got an a wrestling
match with wrestling match.

74
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:15,211
No,

75
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:16,080
the guy came up,

76
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,471
he,

77
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,140
uh,

78
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,150
took a swing at me.

79
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,373
I ducked,

80
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,210
I hit him in the head with a microphone.

81
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,250
And then he was from the Israeli army.

82
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,870
He was a cab driver who was there.

83
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:25,920
His name was Simcoe.

84
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,630
I still remember that because I said,

85
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:27,841
you know,

86
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:28,770
that's the name of the village,

87
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:29,970
idiot and Woody Allen's movie,

88
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:30,541
love and death.

89
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,350
Right?

90
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,670
And so he came up and he
got me in a fucking headlock
and that dude was spinning

91
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:39,150
me around the stage and
knocking down tables.

92
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,060
I couldn't get out and about,

93
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,251
you know,

94
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:41,851
stitches.

95
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:42,280
It's,

96
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,880
it's the stage is
surrounded by the crowds.

97
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:48,120
So of course everybody stands out cause
they want to see the fight and the

98
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,470
bouncers can't get up there.

99
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,290
And so it just fucking
went on for a while.

100
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,780
And then finally the bouncers
came up and two of my buddies,

101
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,081
you know,

102
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:55,771
Mike Gibbons,

103
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:56,060
Mike,

104
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,730
Mike,

105
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,440
and uh,

106
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,440
were at the bar and they're
trying to get up there.

107
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,520
They can't get out there.

108
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,811
And,

109
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,470
uh,

110
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,840
the got 'em out and then the owner,

111
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,000
you remember that guy?

112
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,100
I'm hairy little dude,

113
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:09,934
Harry.

114
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,631
He goes,

115
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:11,464
uh,

116
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,040
yeah,

117
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,791
how you can afford it.

118
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,211
He goes,

119
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:13,990
uh,

120
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,411
okay.

121
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:14,710
Yeah,

122
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,891
okay.

123
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,341
Fits you.

124
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,750
Gotta you got 10 minutes left.

125
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,890
And they reintroduced me.

126
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:18,430
I'm like,

127
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,190
what?

128
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,240
I think you got fucking done.

129
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,280
So I go up and I get on stage and I got
a standing ovation because they would,

130
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,510
they rather it's Boston.

131
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,340
I read a see a fight than his comedy show.

132
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,350
My first standing ovation of my life.

133
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,260
And then I went to the chiropractor.

134
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,440
My neck was fucked.

135
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,820
Do you remember what you
said to the audience?

136
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,661
Yeah.

137
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,700
I walked up and uh,

138
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,830
and they clapped and once they calm down,

139
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:39,670
I looked around and I go,

140
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,451
all right,

141
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:40,950
who's next?

142
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,050
Yeah,

143
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,711
I remember that.

144
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:44,850
I wasn't there for it.

145
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,330
I remember you telling me
that and everybody else was
talking about how you said

146
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:48,691
that too.

147
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:49,081
And I was like,

148
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,040
that's hilarious.

149
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,610
See,

150
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,030
Brian Frazier gave me the line.

151
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,600
He was,

152
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,530
he was the audience.

153
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,861
Oh,

154
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,480
that's hilarious.

155
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,300
Yeah.

156
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,570
Yeah.

157
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,370
Interesting though.

158
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,760
It's weird how fame,

159
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:00,670
you can't predict who's
going to last with fame.

160
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,630
Um,

161
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,440
you know,

162
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,960
like of the Charlie's angels,

163
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,880
you didn't know Farah was going to,

164
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,670
I guess you Kinda knew fire was going
to be the one you thought the other ones

165
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,630
would be pretty big too.

166
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,050
Yeah.

167
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,980
Jacqueline Smith.

168
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,281
I mean,

169
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:15,250
all she did was hair shampoo
commercials for the rest of her life.

170
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,890
She was always,

171
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,211
fuck.

172
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:16,751
Hod Is,

173
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:20,830
fuck my kid is watching Charlie's
angels reruns right now.

174
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:21,790
I watched one yesterday.

175
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,470
Try pulling yourself away.

176
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,190
Oh,

177
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,740
I could stare at those
chicks all fucking day.

178
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:26,931
Well,

179
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:28,640
it's also weird that you're,

180
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:28,771
you,

181
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:29,060
you,

182
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,220
it's Kinda like when you
watch a show like that,

183
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:32,030
it's not just that,

184
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,421
oh,

185
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:32,631
you know,

186
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:33,620
Jaclyn smiths pretty,

187
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,663
but it's also like,

188
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,170
this is a time capsule.

189
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:36,831
Like this is,

190
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:41,300
they've captured this stuff that went on
in the 1970s and you'll watch it again.

191
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,720
All right.

192
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,411
That's weird,

193
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:42,651
man.

194
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:43,780
That's a weird outfit.

195
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,420
Somebody talking about the bootleg jeans,

196
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,860
they were wearing these seven date
encapsulated seventies fashion.

197
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,521
Yeah,

198
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:51,840
no shit man.

199
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,290
You know,

200
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,920
like a denim denim vests
in the feathered hair

201
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,170
and they probably fall in a big part.

202
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,150
We're one of the reasons
why I became so popular.

203
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,033
Right.

204
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,100
Why the fashion did,

205
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,230
I'm sure on those shows,

206
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,064
I'm sure.

207
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,700
Like I guarantee the dukes of Hazzard
probably influenced a lot of idiots to

208
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,570
wear cowboy boots.

209
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,433
Daisy Dukes,

210
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,430
definitely JV

211
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,471
launch.

212
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:15,610
That dude.

213
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:17,860
How she might've been the
hottest chick ever on TV.

214
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,003
And I see.

215
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,110
All right.

216
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,943
Who Chrissy from?

217
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,330
From fucking three's company.

218
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,470
Daisy Duke.

219
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:23,890
No.

220
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,410
How dare you take Chrissy
because you're broken.

221
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,000
You're incisor rotten.

222
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,040
You have to go to a doctor telling you,

223
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,933
go to a doctor.

224
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,440
Chris,

225
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,991
he's hot,

226
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,820
but she's not as hot as daisy dukes.

227
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,440
You know it's pretty
hot even though she's,

228
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,050
she's also,

229
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,860
but she's older so you can't compare that.

230
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,770
You go for an old pick of Catherine Bach.

231
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:40,211
You fuck,

232
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,044
I know what you're gonna do.

233
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,570
But I'm the chick from modern family,

234
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,440
the Latino on it,

235
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:47,440
dude,

236
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,160
I'll take it.

237
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,520
Yeah,

238
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,170
she's only 40 I mean,

239
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,000
but she looks like she's 30 and
her tits still look like I don't,

240
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,920
you can't fake it.

241
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:54,270
They have,

242
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,410
there is some of that cleavage.

243
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,560
You can push it up,

244
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,330
but she doesn't push it
up where it's straining.

245
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,130
It's a little bit of bounce,

246
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,930
it'll jiggle,

247
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,190
but yet there's the,

248
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:04,851
there's Pie.

249
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:05,661
Their pie shaped.

250
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:06,740
They're perfectly round.

251
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,910
She's stupid Hock Tan and that
accent puts it right over the top.

252
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,230
She's stupid hot end.

253
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,980
There's this element of knowing that this
is not going to last like what you are

254
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:20,450
as you're looking at a flower that's been
cut and you're putting it in the vase

255
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,210
and there's just like something even
extra beautiful about the fact that it's

256
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,510
not even attached to the root anymore.

257
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,000
And you've got a day to
look at it like this.

258
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,250
This is it.

259
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:27,590
Now,

260
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,140
tomorrow's going to be wilted the day
after that you're gonna want to throw it

261
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:30,351
out,

262
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:32,210
but right now it's the
hunter Thomas of hot.

263
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,050
Yeah.

264
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,770
Yeah.

265
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,603
Thompson.

266
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,660
What did I say?

267
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,470
Thomas?

268
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,360
Jesus Christ.

269
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,750
Okay.

270
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,890
You know both of them are hot.

271
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,550
Yeah,

272
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,080
but daisy dukes dirtier

273
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,560
Chris.

274
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,750
He's bending over like
fuck me in the ass hole.

275
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,401
I'll tell you what,

276
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:49,550
like who's done a better
job of keeping it together?

277
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,150
Well,

278
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,870
both of them.

279
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,800
Both of them failed.

280
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,843
Oh No,

281
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,640
she did the exercise videos
tight for a little bit,

282
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,503
but still doing it.

283
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,710
Shampoo commercials.

284
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,120
That's not Jaclyn Smith though.

285
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,650
That's daisy Duke.

286
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:04,630
That's Catherine Bach.

287
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,520
Nobody worked at though.

288
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,640
Nipples were permanently
erect on that show.

289
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,920
They probably iced him
up before every scene.

290
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,481
I bet they did,

291
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:14,860
but they,

292
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,430
because guys would get like pumped up.

293
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,520
You guys do like pushups and stop
before scenes to pump up their muscles.

294
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,160
Yeah.

295
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,320
I guarantee they do that.

296
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,913
They went for it.

297
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,650
Yeah.

298
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,300
That was everything and that
was what you were selling.

299
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:27,010
If you're selling,

300
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,100
if you're selling cars,

301
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:29,780
when you leave them dirty
or where'd you Polish them?

302
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,800
He got to polish the car.

303
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,790
You've got to polish the car.

304
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,601
He's selling cars,

305
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:33,321
you're selling tickets.

306
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:33,860
What are you doing?

307
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,693
Get that ice cube out,

308
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,533
honey.

309
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,130
The headlights watching it for the story.

310
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,010
Nobody's watching it for the story.

311
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,750
That's so when she died,

312
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:42,021
man,

313
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:43,280
that was one of those
things where it's like,

314
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:44,600
wow,

315
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,980
wow,

316
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,450
Farrah Fawcett dead.

317
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,780
That was just hard to wrap my head
around because when I was a kid,

318
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,970
she was it.

319
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,640
Who Was it?

320
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,070
Everybody had a fair Fawcett
poster on their wall.

321
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,630
Every girl did and it was at one poster
of her like smiling and she had the

322
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:02,180
feathered hair and everything like
that and like she influenced a whole

323
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,410
generation of where that hair,

324
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,940
it's gotta be the
quintessential poster in,

325
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,020
in America of all time.

326
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,740
Probably famous posters ever.

327
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,480
Yeah,

328
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,470
that's it right there.

329
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,390
Look at her real and the nipple.

330
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:14,991
You can't see,

331
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:15,860
that's not high def,

332
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,880
so you can't see the nipple.

333
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:19,580
But the nipple is very proudly displayed.

334
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:20,390
And this semester.

335
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,691
Yeah.

336
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,960
Many of the photos of the nipple
Rockton she was so pretty.

337
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,853
Yeah.

338
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,040
She was like one of the first
television bombshell types,

339
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:28,874
right?

340
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,411
Uh,

341
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:30,711
yeah.

342
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,544
I mean,

343
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,330
I take it back.

344
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,370
My fear was wonder woman,

345
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,180
old wonder woman.

346
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,661
Oh,

347
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:36,530
Linda Carter.

348
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,980
Lynda Carter's tough to look at it now.

349
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,211
Yeah.

350
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:43,900
Not that she looks at
Lynda Carter was saying,

351
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,863
oh,

352
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,233
look at that and nibble.

353
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,831
Yeah.

354
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:49,461
Linda Carter.

355
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:49,880
I mean,

356
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,840
she doesn't look terrible,

357
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,460
but she's an older woman now.

358
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,350
It's just when you remember how beautiful
she was when she was wonder woman,

359
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,120
I have wished they would die.

360
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,123
I don't want to sit.

361
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,240
It ruins it.

362
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
You know what's fucked though,

363
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:01,590
man?

364
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,610
Like it's weird when you go back and
watch like Batman or any of those,

365
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:05,850
uh,

366
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,590
old school like superheroes,

367
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,450
no one worked out.

368
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,030
No one worked out like
halfway bought a belly.

369
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,560
You look at Catherine Bach there.

370
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,394
She didn't work out.

371
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,363
Look at her legs.

372
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,620
Felt like all mushy and shit.

373
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:16,920
Right?

374
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,810
Everybody was all mushy and sloppy.

375
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,910
They were good for a couple of decades.

376
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,870
John Wayne.

377
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,883
Oh,

378
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,160
beer belly and shit
with little skinny arms.

379
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,680
That skill gap under the legs,

380
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,910
the size of her thighs.

381
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,241
Dude,

382
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:34,560
her fucking body.

383
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,070
That is it.

384
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,020
She was an athlete.

385
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,290
She was in an Olympic athlete,

386
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,124
I believe.

387
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,281
Oh my God.

388
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:39,560
Yeah,

389
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,393
it's hot.

390
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,091
Let's all agree.

391
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:42,970
She's the hottest shit.

392
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,251
Yeah,

393
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,910
I think she is in the was the hottest.

394
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Oh wait.

395
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,040
[inaudible] a major contender.

396
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,790
Who?

397
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,541
Barbara Eden.

398
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,374
I dream of Jeannie.

399
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,693
She wins.

400
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,343
She wins.

401
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,213
She wins.

402
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,440
And she subservient shell too.

403
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,760
He was beautiful.

404
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,840
Yeah.

405
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,111
Yeah.

406
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:03,120
There was a comic on long
island that fucked her.

407
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,950
Yeah.

408
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,500
Yeah.

409
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,340
Late in life though,

410
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:05,521
right?

411
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:05,970
They didn't lie,

412
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,230
but he can say he did it.

413
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,071
She was still hot.

414
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:09,300
It doesn't matter how old she was,

415
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,260
but she would like,

416
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:10,860
you know,

417
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,990
fucking find a guy,

418
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,701
pick them out and go,

419
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:13,534
come on,

420
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,360
let's do this.

421
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,100
Yeah.

422
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,200
Well she knew she could.

423
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,530
You know,

424
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,700
she was Goddamn Barbara Eden.

425
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,280
I know somebody who has
such a late in life,

426
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,761
I should say,

427
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:21,594
allegedly.

428
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:21,730
Well,

429
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,130
this,

430
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,250
I know somebody who allegedly had,

431
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:23,401
no,

432
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:23,690
I know.

433
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,690
And we definitely had sex.

434
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,120
How late?

435
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,953
Late in life.

436
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,410
Real hospital bed like

437
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,050
actually have say winter woman.

438
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:31,884
I don't think I like,

439
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,900
that's a horrible pose.

440
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,360
Yeah,

441
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,193
that's fine.

442
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:36,661
It's fine.

443
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:37,890
Another one cause wonder woman.

444
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:38,730
You could find a bad one too.

445
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:40,470
I'm sure you found a good one.

446
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,111
Uh,

447
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:41,640
you know,

448
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,570
also helping me on,

449
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:45,420
but she wasn't like a few
years before she died.

450
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,290
Whoa.

451
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:46,740
Uh,

452
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,370
who was not s bombshell
hot but stole my heart.

453
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:53,580
Was Valerie Bertinelli one
day to talk to you anymore?

454
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:54,661
Yeah.

455
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:55,770
You become a different person to me.

456
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,400
Shit.

457
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,880
You know,

458
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,870
I don't trust your judgment.

459
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,470
I mean,

460
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,920
cause you did a moment ago now,

461
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,220
now I'm like,

462
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,080
Greg's drunk something.

463
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,140
Halan.

464
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,640
How bad could you be there?

465
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:09,600
I knew about a back fight.

466
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:10,434
It's like Yale.

467
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,830
Yale's no wonder woman
didn't even work out,

468
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:14,280
man.

469
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,300
They didn't work out back then.

470
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:16,470
It's gotta be a better picture of her.

471
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,581
The wonder woman.

472
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:18,450
I'm sure it had a little bit of,

473
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:19,800
I don't mind a little bit of body fat.

474
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,693
I think it's hot.

475
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,180
I like women to have like
little softness to them.

476
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,710
I love Kim Kardashians.

477
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,990
I mean I don't like her person or soul,

478
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,400
but I love that body.

479
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,050
Her body is fantastic.

480
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,890
Well then the her ass is
fat or real or was real fat.

481
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,800
Whatever it is.

482
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,690
It's ridiculous.

483
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,280
Like if you don't get excited about that,

484
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:38,851
you Dick,

485
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:40,440
stop working right now.

486
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:40,860
You're,

487
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,221
you're a,

488
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:42,780
you're a closeted homosexual.

489
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:43,830
If that's not working for you,

490
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,933
it's just sad.

491
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,840
Yes.

492
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,580
Dick doesn't want full
pleasure dicks like,

493
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,060
no,

494
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,700
I'm just wanting to,

495
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,370
skinny girl cuts me with her hips.

496
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,770
Like a guy who buys a Prius
when he wants a Mustang,

497
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,540
a Mustang or get this challenger now,

498
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:57,690
hey,

499
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,540
if I'm going to do it,

500
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,140
it's going to be the Mustang because
I had a fetish for mustangs as a kid.

501
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,310
I still do.

502
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:06,940
I think I need the fact that it's
the 40th anniversary is Kinda 50th

503
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:07,421
anniversary.

504
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,080
That's pretty cool.

505
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,270
Well the new one's going to have
independent rear suspension,

506
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,940
which is going to make a big difference
in the way it handles the new 2015 yeah,

507
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,980
there'll be out pretty soon.

508
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,940
I think they're out in the fall,

509
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:17,290
which is basically right here.

510
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:17,771
God.

511
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,604
She was so hot.

512
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,640
Well,

513
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:19,871
oh,

514
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:21,280
she was so hot as ridiculous.

515
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,151
Yeah.

516
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:24,040
Linda Carter might've been
the hottest women of all time.

517
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,200
She might when she might win.

518
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,063
Yeah.

519
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,120
Bitch was hot.

520
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,271
Oh,

521
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:28,631
wait a minute.

522
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:32,710
What's that look is that
she went from modern family.

523
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,240
Oh God.

524
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:34,931
She wins.

525
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:35,764
She wins.

526
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,633
She wins.

527
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,923
Everybody wins.

528
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,840
There's women that are
listening to this right now.

529
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:44,170
Look,

530
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,003
fuck you.

531
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:45,640
Yeah.

532
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:45,761
Well,

533
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:46,421
let's talk about,

534
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:48,400
we talked about Jim Morrison being hot.

535
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,010
We talked about Joey Lawrence being hot.

536
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,430
Yeah,

537
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,090
he was beautiful.

538
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,920
We did a lot for the ladies on that shelf.

539
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:55,180
So since we don't feel it,

540
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:55,691
you know,

541
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,010
we assume that he's hot.

542
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:57,761
You know?

543
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:58,060
I mean,

544
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,730
I see how you would be a truck.

545
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,041
No,

546
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:00,191
no,

547
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,230
I totally felt your
energy when he came on.

548
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:04,330
So I understood that he was hot zone,

549
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,263
the

550
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,590
doom,

551
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:06,940
doom,

552
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,211
doom,

553
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,490
doom about Janet Jackson.

554
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,900
Early nineties no,

555
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,920
like playboy cover,

556
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,550
black and white.

557
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,540
It's never into that.

558
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,680
I always found it to be
so like needy racial,

559
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,791
I need a race.

560
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,624
Pick a race.

561
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:19,811
Well,

562
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:20,460
I just,

563
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,070
I just,

564
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,320
when someone is like a pop superstar,

565
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,390
there's forcing them down your throat.

566
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:26,890
They never seem sexy to me.

567
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:27,903
It always seem like,

568
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,061
oh,

569
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:29,450
here's this crazy person.

570
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:30,963
Right?

571
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:31,991
What's her name?

572
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:32,824
Um,

573
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,030
uh,

574
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,200
Miley Cyrus.

575
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,070
It's like,

576
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,310
oh,

577
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,930
they want you to think she's hot now.

578
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,490
But you know,

579
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,390
was Britney Spears was a child star and
they forced her eye and she was fucking

580
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,270
hot.

581
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,690
But she was hot in a way that like,

582
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:51,370
like if I saw a bunch of peacocks and
there was a female peacock that was an

583
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:52,480
exceptional specimen,

584
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:52,991
I was like,

585
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:53,231
wow,

586
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,330
that's a beautiful peacock is like that.

587
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:58,300
It's like to me hot I yes.

588
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,111
Physically,

589
00:13:59,111 --> 00:13:59,381
yeah.

590
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:03,150
Undeniable shape and all that
very beautiful button right now.

591
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,110
And nothing's pulling me towards that.

592
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,700
Everything's pushing me away from that.

593
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,050
Yeah.

594
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,890
Bet She's madness.

595
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:09,820
It's craziness.

596
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:12,310
Like that has to be part of the picture.

597
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,620
It has to be who's the person?

598
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,130
Like can you interact with a person?

599
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:18,190
It can't just be the way they look,

600
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,330
the way they look as great.

601
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,141
I mean,

602
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:20,920
it's important.

603
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,800
It's something,

604
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,750
it gives you a charge.

605
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:25,930
But if you know that their
personality is all out of whack,

606
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,830
like you're like,

607
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,280
ah,

608
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,930
this is too,

609
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,260
but I want them a little out of whack.

610
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:30,820
The thing that attracted me as a,

611
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:35,140
as an insecure guy when I
was single was a woman I got,

612
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,070
I saw the end,

613
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,820
I saw the dad dad left or you know,

614
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:40,331
she's got,

615
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,920
she's got like a uni brow.

616
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:42,460
You find,

617
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,870
I would find that one
thing and I'd be like,

618
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,853
I got a shot.

619
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,520
That would make me so much more
attracted if a girl was perfect,

620
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,070
I felt nothing and it wasn't even
that I didn't think I could get her.

621
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:54,350
It just made me feel like I work well.

622
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:54,771
Also.

623
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:56,150
Like somebody who's a little fucked up,

624
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,810
they're going to,

625
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,490
you're going to fucking connect with them.

626
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,060
There's going to be a charge between
you cause you both need something bad to

627
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:03,020
complete yourself.

628
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,940
That's a good point.

629
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:04,331
Yeah.

630
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:05,530
I definitely felt that way.

631
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,840
Like girls had to have really good
relationships with their family.

632
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,733
Like man,

633
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,790
I know girls like,

634
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,321
you know,

635
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:12,850
they want you to go hang
out with their parents.

636
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:13,630
Like,

637
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,463
Oh yeah.

638
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,790
Not really now,

639
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,200
especially if you couldn't relate.

640
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,850
I want a girl who needs help
finding her father that Nicki Minaj,

641
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,341
Disney video.

642
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:24,230
Do you see that's the one that fucking
Jamie keeps going on and on about and

643
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,360
then stop talking about it.

644
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,171
It's so much.

645
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:27,230
But yeah,

646
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,330
like there's parts where she's fingering
herself in a video when a good kid,

647
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,130
I love that my kids see this shit.

648
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,090
It's just,

649
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,361
whoa.

650
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:35,440
Her ass is ridiculous.

651
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,030
They're all ass.

652
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,900
Everybody's got an ass.

653
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,471
If you look at,

654
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,270
if you look at Miley Cyrus,

655
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:41,200
his Twitter Avatar,

656
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,153
she's,

657
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,410
she put her own version of her album
cover on it and it looks like she has a

658
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:48,240
great ass too,

659
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,073
but that's an illusion.

660
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,280
They're Photoshop the shit out of
that girl weighs 18 pounds still.

661
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,173
Stick figure.

662
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,760
Yeah.

663
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,521
She's a very boy.

664
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:55,360
Like with her body.

665
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:58,240
Like when that thing came out in the
video music awards and she danced around

666
00:15:58,241 --> 00:15:59,340
and rubbed up against that guy.

667
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,920
You could see like she's
very like guy like or skinny.

668
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:03,980
She's like skinny girl.

669
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:04,730
Like Nicki Minaj.

670
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,530
A slick.

671
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,640
It's not supple.

672
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,630
Yes,

673
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,700
that girls just a fuck house.

674
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,900
You look at her and you're like,

675
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:14,734
whoa.

676
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,483
But,

677
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,380
but I mean there's comics that
go up and they're likable,

678
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,920
number one before they're
funny so they can't bomb.

679
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,940
Which is the saddest thing in the world
because the audience doesn't even get

680
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:28,091
that.

681
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,160
They're not even that funny
cause they're likable first.

682
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,600
You're not likable

683
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,720
if you do well.

684
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,070
It's just cause you're funny.

685
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,820
I can't argue.

686
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,800
I can argue with what you're saying.

687
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,200
I always said that if I didn't know me,

688
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:51,520
I would swear I was a douchebag.

689
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,440
If I didn't know me,

690
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,950
if I just knew someone who had
my characteristics and my jobs,

691
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,010
I left fucking most
loathsome human in the world.

692
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,450
I got a whiny voice.

693
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:02,140
I'm fucking,

694
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,820
I think I'm better than people.

695
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,650
Oh you think you're smarter than me?

696
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:05,891
I'm like,

697
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:06,551
I really don't.

698
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:07,480
I think I'm a fucking idiot.

699
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,700
But I seem to have that air about me.

700
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,230
But it's part of what's funny though.

701
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,000
You'd know you're a real comic.

702
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:16,030
Like if you and I are talking and if
we just happen to be on an airplane

703
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,280
together and some really
dark shit was going on,

704
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:18,550
right,

705
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,160
we could start cracking each other up.

706
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:21,460
Right.

707
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,910
It doesn't mean we mean it,

708
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,270
but you're going for the laugh.

709
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,360
You're like one of the first guys
to go for the fucked up laugh.

710
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,120
Like in the personal conversation.

711
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,200
Like you're just sitting
there hanging out,

712
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,050
eating lunch,

713
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,883
and then you just,

714
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,220
you'll go for this.

715
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,530
But you don't mean that
you're a really nice guy.

716
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,423
Right.

717
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,840
I don't think people who aren't either
immersed in the world of standup comedy

718
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:46,100
or know a lot of standup comics,

719
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,020
I don't think they appreciate that.

720
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:48,883
Right.

721
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:49,771
Yeah.

722
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,240
I think that to me it's about,

723
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:51,871
it's a gear.

724
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,120
You're commenting on normal conversation.

725
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,421
You're,

726
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:54,691
you're,

727
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:55,050
you're,

728
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,720
you're making fun of what
a racist would say it.

729
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:58,554
And he gets,

730
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,250
you know,

731
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,910
and you're being racist to,

732
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,310
right.

733
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,070
Also being racist was we are racist.

734
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:05,520
Are we,

735
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,420
this is what we are.

736
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,110
Okay.

737
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,730
We are judgmental.

738
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,190
It's part of evolution,

739
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,960
which we're constantly
assessing our or environment.

740
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,620
And sometimes we know there's
shit you're not supposed to say.

741
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,490
So we say it because it's funny and it's
also funny because there's some truth

742
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:20,880
to it,

743
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,091
right?

744
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,020
And it's fucked up,

745
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,070
but there's some truth to it.

746
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,761
And God,

747
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:25,170
I wish it was wasn't true.

748
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,030
I wish stereotypes weren't true.

749
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:27,301
Right?

750
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:30,870
We should talions I wished my
own relatives were an apes.

751
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,480
I really wished they weren't savage,

752
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,460
untrustworthy apes.

753
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,200
But they are.

754
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,470
That's what they have to watch.

755
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:41,660
Fucking real housewives of New Jersey.

756
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,720
And we've seen this in the Red Italian.

757
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,171
What are you seeing?

758
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:45,004
My people,

759
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,120
my people are savages.

760
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,470
I wish that wasn't true,

761
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,660
but it's fucking true.

762
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:49,960
Yeah,

763
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,591
it's hard to,

764
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:54,340
it's hard to fight against the Italian
stereotype because here's the problem

765
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,150
with Italians,

766
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,050
that there's many,

767
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,440
is that you're enamored with
the fact that you're Italian,

768
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:00,700
so you won't evolve.

769
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,320
Like every Italian guy,

770
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,050
you could meet some guy
from fucking the a prairie,

771
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,760
prairie land Midwest,

772
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:07,750
and if he's Italian,

773
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:09,100
he'll go and get the

774
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,480
pause to fuzzy because
they've watched the godfather.

775
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:12,610
Yeah,

776
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,680
they've watched sopranos and they want
to sound like that and because they want

777
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:17,610
to be Italian,

778
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,370
whereas we're supposed to
be all growing away from,

779
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:21,204
like you're saying,

780
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,720
the barbaric versions of
ourselves should be in the past,

781
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,850
not perpetuated for generations.

782
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,830
I have friends that are back east friends.

783
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,530
I love him to death and I
don't mind when they put it on.

784
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:33,870
I don't mind when they
do the Italian talk,

785
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,370
a little piece of me dies.

786
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:35,641
Right,

787
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:35,940
right,

788
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,773
right.

789
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,883
I'm Irish.

790
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,213
Hey,

791
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,551
hey,

792
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:43,500
your mom is still making a good goose

793
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,673
epi.

794
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,290
Some.

795
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,240
They'll call me Giuseppe.

796
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,103
That's a big one.

797
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,270
Hey Giuseppe.

798
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,600
Very rare that that my Jewish friends
call me Giuseppe if it might be already

799
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:53,210
when he was high,

800
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,170
but I've never seen an
Italian guy have a solo fight.

801
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,810
It's always a fucking group jumps in.

802
00:19:59,620 --> 00:19:59,921
Well,

803
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:03,880
there's a herd mentality involved and
being proud of what patch of dirt you're

804
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:04,151
on.

805
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:04,510
Right.

806
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,250
That doesn't lend itself to courage.

807
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,910
Yes.

808
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,540
That's not the,

809
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,920
that's not the right mentality.

810
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,400
The,

811
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,130
the rugged individual that
takes on the group and wins.

812
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:12,881
No,

813
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:13,610
that's a

814
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,570
so there's fucking Bob.

815
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:15,620
You believe what this guy saying?

816
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:16,454
I was Bobby.

817
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,590
Bobby's already Bobby's
wearing a wire the entire time.

818
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,230
Bob In the backseat of the patrol car.

819
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:24,710
I just waited.

820
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,640
Testify.

821
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,770
What the fuck Bobby with family.

822
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,350
Hey look,

823
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,310
this fucking shit go between us.

824
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,830
I was wondering why we
call you the rat Bobby.

825
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,730
And he was with Bobby to rat that fucking
cock sucker knew he used to sit on my

826
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,140
mama's stable leak.

827
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,710
Gaga Gulu shy.

828
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,321
Think about it.

829
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:46,651
What is,

830
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:49,810
who's the number one most
famous gangsters of all time?

831
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:50,770
They're all Italian guys.

832
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:53,610
They all braggadocious
Gotti types or Al Capone.

833
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,480
I've got Paul,

834
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,080
Jimmy Hoffa.

835
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,120
Ah,

836
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,210
savages.

837
00:20:58,211 --> 00:21:00,190
My people were criminal savages.

838
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,680
They make awesome food
and know how to fuck.

839
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,053
That's it.

840
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:04,660
That's it.

841
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,140
Girls.

842
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,010
Oh my God.

843
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,903
And your good luck.

844
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,560
Hot Italian girl.

845
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:11,620
The hottest who can make really good
food and likes to fuck all the time.

846
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,750
She might beat you to death in your sleep.

847
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,380
Right?

848
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,041
And you don't mind.

849
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:15,820
It's worth it.

850
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,170
That's fucking crazy.

851
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:17,770
The crate.

852
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,600
I love Italian.

853
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,690
I grew up around dark,

854
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,160
dark Italian check.

855
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,530
I gave up on him last time.

856
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,710
Trigger Dude took a swing at me.

857
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,400
Rarely.

858
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,940
Yeah,

859
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,770
back in the back of the Boston days.

860
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,370
Right.

861
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,030
That's it.

862
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,860
I'm good at.

863
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,460
I'm good.

864
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,020
Can't date anybody like
me fucking animals.

865
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:32,980
Well that's it too.

866
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,750
You're not supposed to
date within your own race.

867
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,440
That's proven.

868
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,273
I married,

869
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:36,521
well,

870
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:37,720
actually she's half Irish,

871
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:38,261
half Jewish,

872
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:39,094
but you got to,

873
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,730
you got to get a little way from mom.

874
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:42,963
It's a,

875
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:43,241
well,

876
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:46,540
the Irish were the most racist of all
people because we're the fairest skin.

877
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,620
We look down on everybody.

878
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,843
I don't think so.

879
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,990
Oh fuck man.

880
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,130
Really think we came to America at the
time of the Italians came at basically

881
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:54,970
the same time.

882
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,550
So when you go to the Bronx or Boston,

883
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
they're so sweet.

884
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,050
They fucking hate each other and they
hate everybody else because we were the

885
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,220
last ones to come over.

886
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,720
So everybody hated us.

887
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,940
We were the last ones to get jobs.

888
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,931
So we have to,

889
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:08,230
like,

890
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,720
the Irish were the last to the first,

891
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,310
the first immigrants,

892
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,420
English to Dutch,

893
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:13,720
Dutch,

894
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,553
English,

895
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,150
Dutch,

896
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:15,820
English.

897
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,151
The,

898
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:16,984
um,

899
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,430
uh,

900
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,670
you Scandinavians,

901
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,060
I know so little about the immigration
of different cultures in this country.

902
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,560
Always know about my own family.

903
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:24,890
It was the great depression.

904
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,980
My grandparents came over
during the depression.

905
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:31,360
This is a great book about Cornelius
Vanderbilt and it kind of tracks New York

906
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,290
in the 18 hundreds.

907
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,810
And as the waves of people came over and,

908
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:34,991
uh,

909
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:39,700
it's really a won the Pulitzer
prize called the first tycoon.

910
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,721
My Grandmother,

911
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:41,500
the last tycoon,

912
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,330
my grandmother grew up in the depression.

913
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:45,280
She was kind of insane because of it.

914
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,160
And she's still like hide
things all around the house.

915
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:51,160
Like she hide money in
various spots in the house.

916
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,810
They didn't find it until after she died.

917
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,003
They would shit,

918
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:54,900
oh shit.

919
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,100
Thousands of dollars talk to any walls.

920
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,090
But it's just,

921
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,310
but the idea was not
just that she had money.

922
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,091
I mean she,

923
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:02,050
they were very poor,

924
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,530
but that she had money that
she had squirreled away in
to these weird spots all

925
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,070
over their house.

926
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:09,580
Right.

927
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,600
It was really weird.

928
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,340
I did you almost not find it before you,

929
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:12,521
well,

930
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:13,660
I didn't have anything to do with it.

931
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,141
His,

932
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:16,010
his children did the,

933
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,450
uh,

934
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:16,890
the,

935
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,300
uh,

936
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,570
my,

937
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,730
when my grandfather died,

938
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,950
I was over here and I
think that's when they,

939
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:21,220
uh,

940
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,330
they started searching the house.

941
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:23,770
The people that were living in New Jersey,

942
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,430
they had it,

943
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,620
they had some idea that she was like,

944
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,000
Shit.

945
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,400
No,

946
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,151
they didn't know him.

947
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:28,401
She,

948
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:29,320
she had this,

949
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,280
she had had an aneurysm and she was
sick for a long time because of it.

950
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,310
And,

951
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:34,630
um,

952
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,201
during that time,

953
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,540
my grandfather took care of her and
my grandfather took care of her.

954
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,740
That's when I was staying with him.

955
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,400
And it was a very fascinating
time in my life because,

956
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,120
um,

957
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,220
I had left Boston and I moved to New York,

958
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:48,290
but I couldn't really
afford to live in New York.

959
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,910
I didn't know I had hardly any money.

960
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,530
So stated my grandfather,

961
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,450
who was living on North Ninth Street,

962
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,850
which was a really bad
neighborhood in Newark,

963
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:56,931
the next door neighbor,

964
00:23:56,931 --> 00:24:01,310
they got a battering ram broke down his
fucking door because you selling crack.

965
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,130
And he had like an Audi like next door,

966
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:05,440
like this is fucking Newark,

967
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:05,991
New Jersey.

968
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,100
It's a shitty spot.

969
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:07,850
Oh Shit.

970
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,320
And my grandfather was taking care of
my grandmother and it was just me and my

971
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,520
grandfather and my grandmother.

972
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:15,980
It was like one of the
lowest points in my life.

973
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,930
I had just broken up with my girlfriend.

974
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,680
I had just torn my ACL and I
knew that I needed surgery.

975
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,270
I just moved to New York.

976
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,560
I was completely,

977
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:27,290
totally broke and I was,

978
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:27,890
you know,

979
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,970
taking this big risk,

980
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:29,781
moving to New York.

981
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:31,260
I'd signed with Sussman and I want you,

982
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:31,921
I remember that.

983
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:33,080
It's trying to get my shit together.

984
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,160
And my grandmother like Moans,

985
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,061
like she's,

986
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,430
she's hurt so bad she can't move.

987
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,050
She had an aneurism 12 years ago,

988
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,600
so she's just lying in bed like,

989
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,040
yeah.

990
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,873
Hello

991
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,520
from the aneurysm on.

992
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:48,140
She was in pain all the time.

993
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,010
She's done is,

994
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,370
she's done from the aneurysm on.

995
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,010
They gave her 72 hours to live.

996
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:53,240
She lived for 12 years.

997
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,950
Yeah.

998
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,420
And it wasn't a good 12 years.

999
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,710
It wasn't a good 12 years.

1000
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,990
See your grandfather
was getting zero action.

1001
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,130
Ah,

1002
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,060
I'd probably do whatever you want.

1003
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:02,894
Okay.

1004
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,433
Hey,

1005
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,320
hey is exactly what I was saying earlier.

1006
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,430
Obama rolling over,

1007
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,480
put the fucking Google shopping.

1008
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,440
GRANDPA's coming in.

1009
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,131
You get hot.

1010
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:19,080
You could hide the fucking canola is,

1011
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,380
but you're not hiding that fucking Beluga

1012
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:32,050
got a big hairy guy who
shares that fucking God goes,

1013
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:34,800
you could say,

1014
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,221
oh,

1015
00:25:35,221 --> 00:25:39,740
she got a big fucking juicy guy
who saying at the end of it,

1016
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:40,760
