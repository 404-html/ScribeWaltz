1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,420
Mike Tyson's a scene in the movie?

3
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:03,701
Yeah.

4
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:04,534
Yeah,

5
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,500
he's in it.

6
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,333
Yo,

7
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,171
when's that coming out?

8
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:10,920
Cause that you guys from that
last year or two years ago?

9
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,783
Two years ago.

10
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,770
What it all my auntie.

11
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,260
Yeah,

12
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:13,781
but I don't,

13
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:16,460
I don't know when it's coming out
because that dude Jimmy Henchman,

14
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:17,920
I took the shot,

15
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,170
Kevin,

16
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,710
I told him we was coming down in Miami.

17
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:20,830
He said he's going to do a screening.

18
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,160
Oh,

19
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,993
okay.

20
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,160
One of the producers got,

21
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:23,790
you know,

22
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,060
put,

23
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,511
put away.

24
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:25,290
So I don't know.

25
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:25,591
I don't know.

26
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,060
What's the wonderful other movies,

27
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,430
you know what I mean?

28
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,600
We can move on to the world,

29
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,443
man.

30
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,350
Movies.

31
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,580
Finding me at my best.

32
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:36,270
My best friend was the fact that
I had a chance to work with Mike.

33
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,610
I knew Mike Tyson before he was the champ.

34
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,661
You know what I'm saying?

35
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:44,661
So I seen that the whole journey from
the guy who was a regular dude that was

36
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:49,710
scared and he owed all these people were
around him and tell him you could do

37
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:49,950
this.

38
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,120
And he did it and he became as bigger
than life person all the way to the,

39
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,363
to the end.

40
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,780
Now the person that he is now,

41
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,250
because if you see Mike now,

42
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,270
Mike got his shit together.

43
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,880
You know what I'm saying?

44
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,713
He's not,

45
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,631
nobody could say,

46
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:02,760
oh,

47
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,541
he's outta control.

48
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,291
He's not out of control.

49
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,250
He's a married Dewey,

50
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,391
he's calm,

51
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,530
he's polite to people.

52
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,680
He doesn't get in
trouble no more laughing,

53
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,451
dude man.

54
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:13,080
Interesting.

55
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,530
Yeah,

56
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,780
he got his shit together now.

57
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,400
So I feel good about that.

58
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:16,590
You know,

59
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,910
I got to work with him in that movie.

60
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,830
So that was a good feeling man.

61
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,030
Cause I hadn't seen him in years.

62
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,040
I seen him when I did see him,

63
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,653
he was back.

64
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,610
You know what I'm saying?

65
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,940
You've seen that documentary.

66
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,571
They,

67
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,404
I seen the document.

68
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,380
How fucking powerful was
out with the parents.

69
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,520
We never seen that Tyson document.

70
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,630
Is it just called Tyson?

71
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,290
You see a man cry and cry when
he reflects on parts of his life.

72
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,190
Strong man like that.

73
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,700
You have to realize that
whatever was on it was no joke.

74
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,450
Yeah,

75
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,290
it's incredible.

76
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,251
That's a man who,

77
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:51,840
one time I went to his house and it was
five or six limos and everybody would

78
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:53,700
get out the limo and I said,

79
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,960
I come to mass getting out the car.

80
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:55,350
They said,

81
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,183
hey,

82
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,110
you don't see that line
standing over there.

83
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,810
Mike tasting in the lane and his front
yard like hang over starts the only man

84
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:07,710
whose house I went over there
was a lane in the front yard,

85
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,693
loose.

86
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,280
He was on the steps like
this heavy weight belt.

87
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,240
He was like,

88
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,303
no man,

89
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:20,651
no,

90
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:21,490
that's not a cat.

91
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:22,390
That's a lion.

92
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,560
That's fucking real tasting in a lane.

93
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,830
The main line in his front yard,

94
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,030
loose shit.

95
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,910
It was walking.

96
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,040
It was off the leash,

97
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:33,251
man.

98
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:34,220
He was not in a cake.

99
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,500
It was in the yard.

100
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,910
Oh my God.

101
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,170
They came out and started
wrestling with him.

102
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,440
God Damn.

103
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,360
So how big was the lion?

104
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,260
It was big man.

105
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:45,180
It was a line man.

106
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,760
He was wrestling with a lung over there
and grabbed him and started tussling

107
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:52,150
with them and all the Shih tzus and
everybody was in the limits to the land

108
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:54,730
could come up to a limousine and busted
the window open and come in there.

109
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,850
I'm sorry.

110
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,380
Easy.

111
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,990
He could just go like get booth from
come right in there and just having,

112
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,680
so everybody who was in the
car you couldn't back out
cause it was all like five

113
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,480
limos.

114
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,301
Everybody's in the car.

115
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:08,820
Her bad thinking it makes us getting me
to be eaten by this lane but that isn't

116
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,950
happy is he plays with them and
he put takes him in the back.

117
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,050
That comes back out and I was like,

118
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:14,884
you know what,

119
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,090
I'm never going to be in around another
man in life that's going to do that.

120
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,700
And if you know what I'm saying
cause to me he was it Mike Tyson,

121
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,540
is that a line team?

122
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,430
Give everybody making working in Vegas?

123
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:27,611
No,

124
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:28,600
he's just tame lanes.

125
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,220
He had one in his front yard.

126
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,190
He had other cats there to Bieber would
never have a lion and it'd be like to

127
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:37,390
chills all the way or something.

128
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,260
Boys,

129
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,190
I can come and get this
waiting and my cats.

130
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,820
Isn't that cause we've seen wild
kingdom like make you've seen him eat

131
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,380
Willdabeast Tyson story is such a classic
fucking story to him and goes from

132
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:52,750
being poor to being
intensely rich intentionally.

133
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,160
Rick,

134
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,540
the,

135
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,150
the focus of attention of literally
every person on the planet when he was at

136
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:00,550
his peak in the late eighties,

137
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,360
God,

138
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,460
when he beat Michael Spinks crazy.

139
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,900
Jesus Christ.

140
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:09,020
I don't even think people today when
he had the billboard on Sunday and make

141
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,551
miss faces,

142
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,000
made an earn that,

143
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,380
that billboard strongest
billboard on sensing.

144
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,700
It's an iron man.

145
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,570
Like his face was made
the angel just Max face.

146
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:20,980
Awesome.

147
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,471
Awesome.

148
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:21,670
Uh,

149
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,890
building the years like the Bruce
Seldon years where Bruce Seldon,

150
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,660
he didn't even like he missed
him with a left talking cell.

151
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,630
Does knees buckle?

152
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,450
He got up and just said,

153
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:32,570
what am I doing getting up?

154
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:32,981
You know what?

155
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,860
I'm just knew better.

156
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,550
He knew all those guys was a destroyer.

157
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,310
There's no fighter out there right now.

158
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,480
I think that has captured the
attention since since him not like him,

159
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,800
not like him since him.

160
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,490
Okay.
