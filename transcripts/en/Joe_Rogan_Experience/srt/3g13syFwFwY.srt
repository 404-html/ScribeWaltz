1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,510
Either way,

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,080
I could,

3
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,950
depending upon the day,

4
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:02,850
I could argue both ways.

5
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,541
Greg,

6
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:07,980
mother and fog can improves his
hay on the Joe Rogan experience.

7
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,970
All say,

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,390
Greg Proops is one of those
dudes that actually wrote a book.

9
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,910
I'm one of those dudes who threatens
to write a book but never does it.

10
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,070
But you're one of those dudes
who actually wrote a book,

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,480
the smartest book in the world.

12
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,650
You bad motherfucker.

13
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,070
You,

14
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,180
I just learned to read.

15
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,460
And so I thought why not put it to use?

16
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,970
I have another level of respect
for people who write books.

17
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,460
Uh,

18
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,910
it took so long Joe w e now you
think it's going to be easy,

19
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:31,790
you think you'd get a skin to,

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,221
cause it's,

21
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:32,401
you know,

22
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:33,300
off the podcast,

23
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:33,750
right?

24
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,280
I obviously had its cheap,

25
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,723
you know,

26
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,270
marketing ploy from the
smartest man in the world,

27
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:40,104
your podcasts.

28
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,660
Because when they said what
would you call the book?

29
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,650
And when I went into the meeting,

30
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:46,110
I was like the smartest book in
the world and they were like,

31
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,300
love it,

32
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,133
you know?

33
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,880
So that was a couple of years ago.

34
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,331
And,

35
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:51,570
uh,

36
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,390
it took about a year and a
half to kind of get together.

37
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,180
I thought I'd be able to take like
transcripts from the shell and then I

38
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,160
realized they don't read that well,

39
00:00:59,190 --> 00:00:59,400
you know,

40
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,630
there's too much doubling doc.

41
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:04,030
There's too much internal logic and
this is a big difference between oral

42
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,760
reading and writing.

43
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,470
They goddamn difference.

44
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,960
And sometimes like for standup comedy,

45
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:13,950
that's like why one of the most
important things is you have to do both.

46
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,500
And the guys who only do one or the other,

47
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,670
it's easily,

48
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:18,120
it doesn't,

49
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,740
it doesn't.

50
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,130
I mean some guys can pull it off.

51
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,993
Some guys,

52
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,390
some guys just like to just go
up and just keep going up all,

53
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,110
all the time and just going over the
material in their head like Sorta of Jay z

54
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:31,230
style and never actually sitting
down and writing things out.

55
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,400
I know guys who don't,

56
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,390
you know,

57
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,800
only a key word here and there.

58
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:38,040
And then I was just in Denver and I made
everybody get their book out cause I

59
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,420
wanted to look at everybody's book.

60
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:39,721
You know,

61
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:43,110
like I had an obsessed with the fact that
we're the last people who write things

62
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:45,720
on pieces of paper all the
time for our own information.

63
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:48,480
Like the rest of the world
has completely gone phone.

64
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,290
Really?

65
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:49,981
I think so.

66
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:50,814
But I mean,

67
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,300
I dunno,

68
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,260
EEG you carry a little,

69
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,220
you carry up notebook,

70
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:53,461
right?

71
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:57,270
I carry a notebook when I perform me tell
you a little one of those little tiny

72
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:58,104
mole skins.

73
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,000
And so you're but like,

74
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:04,230
so I took mine out and of course it's
just a sheaf of garbage with like every

75
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:08,730
napkin and stationary from every hotel
and earth and the stuffed into mole

76
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,180
skins.

77
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,400
And then the other guy takes his out,

78
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,121
Deacon Grace's,

79
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:15,480
his name is Jennifer comic and
his is written like a playwright.

80
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,343
Each page,

81
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,520
it's just beautifully,

82
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,860
every word of the joke written down.

83
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,150
And I'm like,

84
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,380
I write like corn,

85
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,251
you know,

86
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:26,130
and then try to remember the other
18 minutes that goes with it.

87
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:27,960
And so like you say,

88
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,030
sometimes you need to write the
whole thing out and look at it.

89
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,040
But my question was,

90
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,180
and I don't know if this works with you,

91
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,140
if you write something down
on a piece of paper for me,

92
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:37,920
I remember it.

93
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,240
If I type it into something,

94
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:39,841
yeah,

95
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:40,081
that's,

96
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,310
they're going to read it a thousand times.

97
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,900
They've done studies on that actually,

98
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,590
that the best way for someone to remember
something is actually physically write

99
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:46,980
it.

100
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,160
Longhand rush.

101
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,440
I don't,

102
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,580
it's cursive longhand.

103
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,820
Is that what they called [inaudible]?

104
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,763
They call that long,

105
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,200
but I mean just writing.

106
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,200
I don't write in cursive.

107
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,490
I don't know anyone who writes in cursive.

108
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,620
Not when my mom does and she sent
me a whole letter the other in ice.

109
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,090
I couldn't read it halfway through.

110
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,520
I just gave up because I
don't even the z our thing,

111
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:05,140
I can't tell what seasons ours.

112
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,603
Yeah.

113
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,530
What's wrong with the
microphone and that was it.

114
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:11,580
Flopped on spinning wants
to microphone as limp.

115
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,950
Michael Michael Moore wrote this thing
about running for president a couple of

116
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:14,951
weeks ago.

117
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:15,581
That was pretty funny.

118
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:16,361
He's not doing it,

119
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,340
but one of the things he said was,

120
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,551
well,

121
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,710
the first thing he said was
universal courts for everything.

122
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,251
Right?

123
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,270
For all devices,

124
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,021
all computers,

125
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:23,351
phones.

126
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:23,740
He goes,

127
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,110
we've had the same plug in
the wall for a hundred years.

128
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,060
There's not 16 different ones.

129
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,260
Why is every device,

130
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:29,591
well,

131
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,281
almost everybody,

132
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:34,990
but apple uses a micro SD USB,

133
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,370
right?

134
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,250
Every brand they change.

135
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,240
But he also said,

136
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,830
uh,

137
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,663
um,

138
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,210
everyone has to be taught cursive.

139
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,200
And his reason was it's the one
thing that's absolutely distinct,

140
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:45,000
like a fingerprint.

141
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,500
Every human we are signature is,

142
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,221
you know what I mean?

143
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:49,360
You can copy people's signatures,

144
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,450
but we all learn our own way
to write old government tricks.

145
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,270
Yup.

146
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,650
Yup.

147
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,030
And so I agreed with him on that.

148
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:55,600
I thought,

149
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,630
I don't really write letters and cursive
like your mother did because she went

150
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,470
to school before,

151
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:00,580
but I learned cursive.

152
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,421
Oh my God.

153
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,910
When I was eight years
old or nine years old,

154
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,660
you know.

155
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:04,781
Well,

156
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,550
the way right is always like,

157
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,140
it's always distinctive.

158
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,250
So much so it's a,

159
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,640
it's a segment in television
shows and movies and plots.

160
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,241
You know,

161
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:15,700
they bring in the hand
writing analysis guy,

162
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,680
giant loop on the P and a giant loop
on the g means extending personality.

163
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:22,060
And the devil o's or you know,

164
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:22,894
Blah Blah Blah.

165
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,280
It can break you down.

166
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,030
And how you,

167
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,880
do you have the same signature that
you did when you started comedy?

168
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:28,960
Uh,

169
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,271
yeah.

170
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:30,250
Did you abbreviate it?

171
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,641
Ish?

172
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:31,300
You know,

173
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,900
I,

174
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,320
I do.

175
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,110
I have an abbreviated one in case
I got assigned a thousand things.

176
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,770
And where there's two versions.

177
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:37,790
Not a lot of letters.

178
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,430
Yeah.

179
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,120
Well it's just kind of gs and P's.

180
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,380
I liked the people who've narrowed
their signature down to like nothing.

181
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,700
It just looks like a blob.

182
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,121
And you're like,

183
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:47,470
that doesn't look like your name.

184
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:48,304
That's kind of a

185
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,771
Willie Mays.

186
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:52,200
I have a couple of autograph setup.

187
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,080
I didn't get them personally,

188
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:56,980
but they were given to me and Willie
Mays learn handwriting in the dirties in

189
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,390
Alabama where he grew up,

190
00:04:58,391 --> 00:04:59,710
I'm sure in his little school.

191
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:00,160
Right.

192
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,500
So his writing goes
the other way entirely.

193
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,210
Like it doesn't look like Willie Mays.

194
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,040
It looks like we,

195
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,910
we mean like all going one way.

196
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,920
And I looked at it for
ages until I figured out,

197
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,311
oh,

198
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:13,150
he's holding it like this and glean
that with his w because making a w

199
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:16,210
completely backwards to the
way you'd make a w and a,

200
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,480
but babe Ruth who went to school in the,

201
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,540
uh,

202
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,640
early turn of the century in Baltimore,

203
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,330
and he went to an industrial school where
the priests and the nuns beat you and

204
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:25,600
stuff,

205
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:25,841
you know,

206
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:26,950
like old school.

207
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,341
Yeah.

208
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,480
He went to one of those,

209
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,740
his signature is absolutely beautiful and
he wrote with his left hand and if you

210
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:37,060
wrote lefthanded then it was terrible
because you were using a fountain pen and

211
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,140
he dipped it in a well,

212
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,140
so your hand goes across your work.

213
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:41,974
Yes.

214
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,980
Cory lefthander had to learn
to write with their hand up.

215
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,221
Yeah.

216
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:48,070
Writing left handed is a real bitch then.

217
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,180
That's a real bitch.

218
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:49,361
I,

219
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,790
I tried to practice it
once when I broke my arm,

220
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,860
I couldn't write with my right hand.

221
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,780
So I started like writing
things with my left and I was,

222
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,250
it was bizarre.

223
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,100
First of all,

224
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,410
it's bizarre how shitty
your left hand works.

225
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,070
Yes.

226
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,870
It's incredibly amazing how poor.

227
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:03,591
Yeah.

228
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:08,591
I mean if you think about what your
right hand can do with drawing things and

229
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:13,010
writing things down very quickly with
excellent control of your fingers,

230
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:17,990
excellent articulation and you switch
over to your left hand like you get tired

231
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,170
writing.

232
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,630
It's such an effort.

233
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,240
You have to concentrate all of
your right brain on writing.

234
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,870
My right arm now is starting to turn
into my left arm just from using cell

235
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:27,621
phones too much.

236
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,060
How I set and use my computer.

237
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,760
You guys getting early signs
of carpal tunnel or something,

238
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,080
but it's turning week.

239
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,150
I could feel it get weaker.

240
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,993
Your right hand,

241
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,550
my right arm.

242
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,430
You've over used it with
the devices so much.

243
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,060
Well they say that when people with thumbs
that thumbs now they have more carpal

244
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,840
tunnel issues with thumbs and like
ever in human history between x boxes,

245
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,760
gameboys and texting and things.

246
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,810
This now it's all this one movement and
with kids there's some kids that are

247
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,760
fucking it.

248
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:52,594
Dick did.

249
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,870
You know like we've all,

250
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,161
we've,

251
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:57,860
we've had many conversations
on this podcast about
electronic addictions and how

252
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:58,700
real they are now.

253
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,010
Like Ari Shaffir just switched over to um,

254
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,460
uh,

255
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,021
a little,

256
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,390
a flip phone and somebody
else just flipped out,

257
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,950
switched over to a flip phone too.

258
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,251
Oh,

259
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:08,090
Rory Macdonald,

260
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,133
UFC fighter.

261
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,310
He switched over to,

262
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:11,290
he's like on a smart phone.

263
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,601
Yeah.

264
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:11,961
He's like,

265
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:12,830
it's just too much.

266
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,280
I just,

267
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,260
I just don't feel like
I get enough me time.

268
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:19,610
I'm just constantly dealing with texts
and tweets and looking at this video and

269
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:20,281
watching that,

270
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:20,570
that,

271
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,800
do you think that Chad trauma,

272
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,690
that's why they're going
back to the flip phone?

273
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:24,800
Both Ari and Rory.

274
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,580
Rory.

275
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,690
Rory has been hit,

276
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:27,381
but rarely.

277
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,400
He's very skillful.

278
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,810
Already lost his other phone.

279
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,300
I made a conscious decision and talked
about it while he had his iPhone.

280
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,750
How dare you?

281
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,180
I really,

282
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,140
well he really did man.

283
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:39,530
All right.

284
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,161
It's good though.

285
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:43,280
I know people who use old and ones I got,

286
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,800
I got a buddy in Illinois
and he brought out his,

287
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,450
and he had a little
razor man and I was like,

288
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,613
why not?

289
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,500
I don't think you have
to do everything every,

290
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,950
I got buddies too who are on Twitter that
are comedians and they just want their

291
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:55,551
privacy.

292
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:56,540
They're not on Facebook.

293
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,620
They want to live their lives.

294
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,630
And I I say right on because I find
myself wasting too much time on it.

295
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,190
You know what I mean?

296
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,360
Is the difference between
doing your business on it?

297
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,800
Cause we all got a tweet and do all that,

298
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:07,011
you know,

299
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:10,340
and go on periscope and shoot
each other and be the monkeys.

300
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,300
But you,

301
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,480
when you find yourself
just going through Twitter,

302
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:16,640
just looking for something
that's interesting,

303
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:16,951
you're like,

304
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:17,170
yeah,

305
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,003
I could be,

306
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:18,591
you know,

307
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:23,591
building a home out of bricks or getting
something actually done writing a

308
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:25,670
Sonnet to my wife or something.

309
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,990
You're reading a book?

310
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,831
Yeah,

311
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:30,020
like my smartest book in the world.

312
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,600
Like why would you fuck with Twitter
where you can just read that?

313
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,990
I don't think I Bang Bang on
the Internet too much in there.

314
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:36,770
I little bit.

315
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,400
There's a few things because the
dull www worldwide web thing.

316
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:40,940
I'm like,

317
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,330
worldwide web is three syllables and www.

318
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,250
It's nine syllables.

319
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,320
So why do we say the
abbreviation that's so

320
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,220
much faster to say that we'll
be able to web is way quicker.

321
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,780
That's hilarious.

322
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,430
I never thought of that until right now.

323
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:00,540
And I put it in the book like,

324
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,470
why have we said www for ions?

325
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,220
So fucking funny.

326
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,150
Did you find Willie Mays?

327
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:06,410
Isn't it?

328
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,560
Isn't it though like you and
no one ever said anything?

329
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,440
And like someone pointed it
out to me a couple years ago,

330
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,160
a friend went like,

331
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,400
um,

332
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,380
why do we say this?

333
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:12,750
And I'm like,

334
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,920
oh my God,

335
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,190
w w w worldwide.

336
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,080
Because we think are
shortening that by saying,

337
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,020
tell you know,

338
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,251
like,

339
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:20,461
Hey,

340
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:21,600
that's a hip way to say it.

341
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,710
Stuttering.

342
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,750
Then why don't we just
say dub dub or something?

343
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,280
Some connection to life.

344
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,700
There's something in that.

345
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,480
There's a reason why life is so goofy.

346
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,480
That's,

347
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,070
that's gotta.

348
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,360
There's gotta be some connection.

349
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,710
I stick that one in there.

350
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:35,490
And uh,

351
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,200
and Steffi,

352
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,100
I like words that I hate and stuff.

353
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,420
There's a couple chapters on that.

354
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,410
Then just words.

355
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,550
Well like,

356
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:41,821
you know,

357
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:45,110
people I said like soups
and Cray cray and all that.

358
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,660
That'll,

359
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,260
I said in 50 years it'll be like saying
buggy whip or whipper snapper or you

360
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:50,094
know,

361
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,940
people use cray cray in anonymous
or in an ironic rather way.

362
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,290
I don't mind that.

363
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,770
If something fucks up and some
guy does something really stupid,

364
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,561
someone goes to him,

365
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:58,681
he,

366
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,514
Craig Craig,

367
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,260
you know,

368
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,881
that's fun.

369
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:01,140
Yeah.

370
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,460
If they don't really mean it.

371
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:02,970
Yeah.

372
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,810
But if they do mean,

373
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:04,280
it's like,

374
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,113
Ooh,

375
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,670
you just shouldn't accept that
level of culture automatically.

376
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,440
I agree.

377
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,610
Yeah.

378
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,360
It used to be some bulwark
against the barbarians.

379
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,430
There has to be something against the
horde of sheep or willing to all act and

380
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:18,061
behave the same.

381
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:18,540
Yeah.

382
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,470
There's gotta be something.

383
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,323
There's got to be,

384
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,710
not having a smartphone is one way.

385
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:26,460
I remember Jen was a John Waters who
didn't have the email up til like a couple

386
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:26,530
of years ago.

387
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:26,991
I was he there?

388
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:27,360
He,

389
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,840
he would have someone take down everything
in hand in the Sheaf of paper and

390
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,000
he'd like go through all
the messages and everything.

391
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,140
That's hilarious.

392
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,033
I thought that was,

393
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,133
yeah.

394
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,330
I would like to say you remember
when people used to use it?

395
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,910
Like if you had,

396
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:42,151
you know,

397
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:43,200
at Red Bam,

398
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,110
it would be is going to the doctor today.

399
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,063
Yeah.

400
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,241
You know what I mean?

401
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,080
Like it wasn't a,

402
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,550
it wasn't a direct,

403
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,580
it was sort of you were talking
about yourself in the third person.

404
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,860
That was the way people
initially use Twitter.

405
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:56,970
I,

406
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,301
you know,

407
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:57,781
and I was on,

408
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:58,140
I was like,

409
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,010
get the fuck out of here.

410
00:10:59,011 --> 00:10:59,551
I'm not going to do that.

411
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:00,690
I'm just going to just talk normal.

412
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:05,650
But there was a lot of people that
used it like at your name and then a,

413
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,210
you know,

414
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,130
is having a great time at the movies.

415
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,480
Like who you are.

416
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:10,140
You haven't,

417
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,820
you can't say I'm riding
in the conditional,

418
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:14,580
you see I'm a third party observer
to my own life at all times.

419
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:15,810
I'm narrating myself.

420
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:18,720
Greg is having a good time being here
on the Joe Rogan show at this moment and

421
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,830
you get fucked if you have
too many letters in your,

422
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,420
in your little name.

423
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:24,990
Right.

424
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,110
Because if you have the
real Greg Proops Esquire,

425
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,380
right,

426
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:28,801
then we'll then,

427
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,600
your tweets are going to be really short.

428
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,020
No,

429
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,230
hardly adventurous rabbi.

430
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,870
Yeah.

431
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,060
I mean your tweets can
be still 140 characters,

432
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:37,730
but no one's gonna
retweet the whole thing.

433
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:41,010
And I've never going to quote tweet
it because they can't now cause you,

434
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,540
you're fucking name's too long.

435
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,723
God dammit.

436
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,913
Wow.

437
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,090
These people trying to issue I have with
all of these things is they're all fun

438
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:52,360
and they're all great
and they're all grieving.

439
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,830
And the reason why I have a
careerist cause there's an internet,

440
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:55,660
but uh,

441
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,493
Eh,

442
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:01,510
I just find that everybody
trusts technology too much
in so much as the people

443
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:02,081
who make it.

444
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,820
And then people who are over watching us,

445
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,690
uh,

446
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,860
they are not benign.

447
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:06,560
Well,

448
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,590
it was this some dark overlord type shit.

449
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,100
We're not going to go to the room full
of 11 men and the council of five or

450
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:12,701
nothing like that.

451
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:13,301
I'm just saying,

452
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:13,990
you know,

453
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,940
be mindful of all the stuff he tape.

454
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,361
You know,

455
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:16,870
people,

456
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,500
people just tape every intimate moment
of their lives and all of a sudden,

457
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,660
just like in the movie with Cameron Diaz,

458
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,860
you're on the cloud and it's getting
worse and worse for me because I've been

459
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,930
staying at home a lot more trying to
and so have like webcams where they're

460
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,471
recording me,

461
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:35,590
played video games and stuff and
I'll forget that I have that on.

462
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,030
And then next thing you know,

463
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:37,361
like,

464
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:37,720
like,

465
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,260
uh,

466
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,200
like a day later I'm sitting
there talking and I realized that,

467
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,381
oh,

468
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:44,440
I'm just talking like Jamie could just
be sitting there and listening to me

469
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:45,274
right now.

470
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,060
And uh,

471
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,350
because it's so easy to do with like
Xbox live or all these other things.

472
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:50,930
Yeah.

473
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,730
That's a new thing and it's going to
transition probably into something even

474
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:55,720
more invasive.

475
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,230
It's probably going to be like,

476
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:57,521
look,

477
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:00,490
we're saying before like some
sort of a Google glass thing.

478
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,640
We're like through a ski
helmet type situation where,

479
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,150
you know,

480
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,070
that's what they're working
on with that magic leap.

481
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:06,380
Right.

482
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,260
Wasn't that part of it
was either magically,

483
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,010
but one of the other ones that
they're working on where they,

484
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,460
they can spin objects in the air in
front of them and stop them and move them

485
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,540
and stretch them out.

486
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,840
Like you could open like minority report,

487
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,200
right?

488
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,520
You're doing it in the air
minority report was on like a,

489
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,673
was it a screen?

490
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,233
Yeah,

491
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:25,960
no screens.

492
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,030
You're just doing it in the air.

493
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,560
The world becomes your desktop.

494
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:32,050
And I think we're talking about
two different technologies.

495
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,370
I think that um,

496
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,710
the other stuff is,

497
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:36,544
um,

498
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,990
the magic leap thing.

499
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,130
I think it's a different type.

500
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,720
Yeah.

501
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,080
Well there's that Sony,

502
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,023
uh,

503
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,490
this one,

504
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:42,581
oh,

505
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:43,990
this is the watch that's on your arm.

506
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,143
It's a windmill,

507
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,300
a group of benign people
who care about you,

508
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,270
who are well groomed,

509
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:52,240
are thinking right now about your future.

510
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,080
Advertise that.

511
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,923
So cool.

512
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,700
Anytime you have an advertisement for
anything that might even be potentially

513
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:02,080
remotely dangerous,

514
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,390
those advertisements
should all be illegal.

515
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,190
I've been watching advertising slaves,

516
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,900
well,

517
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,291
excuse me,

518
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,124
lately,

519
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,650
lately on like a late night television,

520
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,860
they have all these
advertisements about drugs.

521
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:15,551
Like,

522
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,870
ask your doctor all these,

523
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:18,400
ask your doctor commercials.

524
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,061
And I'm like,

525
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:20,740
these commercials are terrifying.

526
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,360
And then they,

527
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,170
when did they start listing the side
effects and sometimes side effects,

528
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,460
death or suicide,

529
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,610
you know like really dude,

530
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:30,760
this side effect from
this one thing for Zits,

531
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,661
the entire,

532
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:33,130
I don't know what the medication is,

533
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:38,131
but it was a genuinely disturbing
video because you know that happy song

534
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,640
they,

535
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,200
they're only playing like
the background music.

536
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:45,000
They don't have the law,

537
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,140
the lyrics and the music
then of the vocals.

538
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,350
But these two girls are walking
and Bob up and down the street,

539
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:52,100
like they're in a fucking
music video and it's

540
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,120
about zits and it's about your
zits are keeping you from being,

541
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,300
so you've got to ask your doctor about
this medication that stops your zits.

542
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,790
And then he goes through
all the lists of shit.

543
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,440
You should be careful of colluding,

544
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,410
bloody diarrhea.

545
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,300
Oh my goodness is in
the fucking commercial.

546
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:08,701
And they're,

547
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:12,920
they're saying you have to be careful
of abdominal crank cramps because they

548
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:14,030
could be fatal.

549
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,930
You got to go to your doctor
if any of these things happen.

550
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:17,450
And I mean,

551
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,070
they've run through all fucking laundry
list of shit that you have to be worried

552
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:22,550
about.

553
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,941
Where I'm like,

554
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,320
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

555
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,660
This is real and this is on TV.

556
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:28,680
And then they allowed them in
your girls taking a narrow,

557
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,570
they manipulate you with the
dancing and the pretty girls.

558
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,493
This is the shit.

559
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,390
We're not showing this
to the rest of the world,

560
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:35,540
right?

561
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,020
What's it called?

562
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,171
Oh,

563
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,190
next dawn.

564
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,151
Okay,

565
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:39,980
so it's got these girls,

566
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,060
they're beautiful.

567
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:42,620
They're fucking flawless.

568
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,330
They don't have a mark on their face.

569
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,180
How come you can't get someone
with zits that needs this shit?

570
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:52,590
You've got these gorgeous model girls and
while they're jogging down the street,

571
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:54,240
this fucking happy song is playing.

572
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,570
Do is dark.

573
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,990
It's dark because dead eyes.

574
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,291
Yeah,

575
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:00,800
I was gonna say.

576
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,070
And then an alien comes aboard
and takes control of your life,

577
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,720
but they're showing you the ideal.

578
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:08,720
This is the idea that
Wallace people after.

579
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:09,110
Yeah,

580
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,490
but think about what they're selling.

581
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:10,581
Well,

582
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:12,020
who the fuck looks like this?

583
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,621
If I,

584
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:15,200
if I take this medication
while I looked like that girl,

585
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,460
like why do you have that girl?

586
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:19,130
Why is she so beautiful
that she has zip problems?

587
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,880
So why are you using her for this
fucking commercial either that's like,

588
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,330
you know,

589
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,970
showing Lexington steel in a big penis,

590
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:26,804
cream commercial,

591
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,920
no show.

592
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,840
Show a regular dude with a little deck.

593
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,010
Grow a big deck.

594
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,700
Okay,

595
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,270
you can't,

596
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,920
you can't show giant dicks.

597
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,470
Like I was born with a giant Dick
and it's the same thing here.

598
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:38,750
Those girls were born flawless.

599
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,310
I mean that girl has a
perfect skin structure or a
bone structure and beautiful

600
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:48,290
clear skin and she's dressed fashionably
and the music is playing great and her

601
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:52,640
hair's blowing just so in the wind where
it looks like a casual summer day and

602
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:52,881
you're like,

603
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:53,241
God,

604
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:54,560
if I just took this medication,

605
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:55,460
I can hang with these bitches.

606
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,571
No,

607
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:58,100
you don't look at it as he liked him.

608
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:58,830
It's insane.

609
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,451
Everywhere they go,

610
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,290
there's models.

611
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,460
It's like the world.

612
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,330
The world's filled with tens and you're
going down the street bopping to music

613
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:06,620
and everyone's got a little dog.

614
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:06,981
Like,

615
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:08,660
what the fuck are you selling?

616
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:09,351
Oh,

617
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:12,540
and the beautiful backdrop that they
were in front of that lovely building and

618
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,670
then there was woods and whatnot.

619
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,530
There was no rappers anywhere.

620
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,430
Homeless people are,

621
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:16,910
no,

622
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,270
no,

623
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,103
there's no,

624
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,070
it's a fantasy.

625
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,341
Yeah,

626
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:19,521
no.

627
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:19,861
Which is what?

628
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:24,230
She lost a foot to diabetes pushed around
in a wheelchair asking you for money.

629
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,240
What's the expression?

630
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,110
Impossible beauty standards.

631
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,280
Say this is a,

632
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,110

impossible beauty standard and it's about

00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:33,950

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,610
you know that fucks with people and
you get zits all over your face.

635

Scary face is a crazy side effects may
include dre come an alien with Brac made

636
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,290

637
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,491
See Jamie,

638
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:46,650
see if you can find out what the
side effects are because they,

639
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,280
we've got to play it because
they'd go on for like a minute.

640
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,010
I mean the side effects
just fucking keep going.

641
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,060
Getting your attention.

642
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,010
Especially if fused with
other acne products.

643
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,790
Stop using,

644
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,430
call your doctor if you have
a rash or very red burning,

645
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,810
itchy or swollen skin.

646
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,980
Limit your time in the sun.

647
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,970
Avoid tanning beds.

648
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,310
And suddenly it says stop hiding.

649
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,210
That's not the whole one.

650
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,010
You got to go before that where it says
you could die your time in the sun.

651
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,610
Stop use if you develop severe watery or
bloody diarrhea or severe as these may

652
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:15,444
be fatal.

653
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,201
Okay,

654
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:19,830
let's just stop right there
and back that up one more time.

655
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:19,901
Well,

656
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:21,210
I want to hear that one more time.

657
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,651
Stop.

658
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:26,490
Use If you develop severe watery or
bloody diarrhea or severe abdominal cramps

659
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:28,620
as these may be fatal police,

660
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,000
be fatal in the actual fuck tonight.

661
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,190
Not to overuse a term like cray cray,

662
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,373
but

663
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,570
seriously what in the actual fuck.

664
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,500
Like you,

665
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,150
I was watching that commercial last
night on TV during a hunting show.

666
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,171
Okay.

667
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,510
I'm watching a show about hunting.

668
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,170
Wow.

669
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,720
And they have this commercial
about bloody diarrhea.

670
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:52,051
I'm like,

671
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:53,070
what the fuck?

672
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,510
I might've just changed channels.

673
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,110
I might be wrong about
what I was watching on,

674
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,070
but it wasn't wrong about the,

675
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,440
the actual commercial
itself being insanity.

676
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,850
No,

677
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,660
and the visuals and the sound track
don't match at that moment and they're

678
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:07,590
talking about bloody diarrhea.

679
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:10,920
She casts a side long glance and throws
her head often gets ready to run.

680
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,310
I don't think we should be so flippant.

681
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,610
I know influence of these
goddamn commercials at all.

682
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,750
I think this is like,

683
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,820
this is like coercion.

684
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,200
It's like Voodoo.

685
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,570
They're doing like they're
brainwashing people.

686
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,610
What's the actual number?

687
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,720
Somewhere in the neighborhood
of with the phone now,

688
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,560
it used to be hundreds of ads a
day just walking around and TV,

689
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,180
but with the phone I
think it's up to what,

690
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:33,451
three,

691
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,890
5,000 a day or something like that.

692
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,150
The abs that you have to,

693
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,520
there's a link your way doing ads,

694
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:39,060
man,

695
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,420
and it's all blind bids and Dang and
poisoning and it has an agenda and the

696
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:44,370
agenda is to take money
from you and fool you.

697
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:44,851
Well,

698
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,790
I don't worry about that
when it comes to like cars,

699
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,230
as long as the cars are safe,

700
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,550
like make it sex age,

701
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,750
Judge Viper,

702
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,750
I don't mind that you're going to convert,

703
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,860
coerce me in that way.

704
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,694
That's fine.

705
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,790
I do mind that though of I
might get bloody diarrhea.

706
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,624
That kills me.

707
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,300
You're coercing me.

708
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,850
Imagine if you're a young girl,

709
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,360
well you might have an unfortunate
looking face and you just always felt like

710
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:10,290
you're an outcast.

711
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,940
And maybe if my skin was clear,

712
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,980
then I wouldn't be
scared to go to the gym.

713
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,370
You know,

714
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,790
maybe those girls at school would be
nicer to me and I'd have more popular

715
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,120
friends.

716
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,270
And you see this fucking commercial and
the next thing you know you're going to

717
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,760
your doctor and the next thing you know
after that you got bloody diarrhea and

718
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:24,594
you're dying.

719
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,490
How would you get bloody diarrhea though?

720
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,200
Cause it wouldn't be the only one way,

721
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,570
but it wouldn't be bright,

722
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:30,751
right?

723
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:31,650
It'd be like that black,

724
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:32,484
red diarrhea,

725
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,300
turnip,

726
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,320
dire situation,

727
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,710
an acne medicine.

728
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,544
It's giving you a journal.

729
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,340
Da approved this,

730
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:40,830
but knew that within a certain group,

731
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,281
however,

732
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,270
what a number is,

733
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:45,240
whatever they feel the number of safe
that many people out of that number,

734
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,180
it's okay that they get these things
as long as you say consult with your

735
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:49,541
doctor,

736
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:49,870
that,

737
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,470
uh,

738
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,260
probably adheres to some
code within the God.

739
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:54,190
That's one of the situation.

740
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,360
And I'll not jive really.

741
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:59,350
One of the more fascinating things about
us biologically is the fact that you

742
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:02,350
could take something and it
has no effect on you at all.

743
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,990
And I can take the same
thing and die like,

744
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,470
you know,

745
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:10,470
things that people are severely
allergic to or allergic reactions,

746
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:11,680
even to medication.

747
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:11,861
I mean,

748
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:14,350
how many times do you ever been asked
if you're allergic to penicillin?

749
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,800
Imagine being the poor bastard
that's allergic to penicillin.

750
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,850
Fuck man.

751
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:19,960
I could go be,

752
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,390
you know,

753
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,740
uh,

754
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,580
one person,

755
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,270
nothing.

756
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,280
Net guy next to him.

757
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,190
He'll die.

758
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,150
I'm allergic to penicillin.

759
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,733
Do you have to wear a little

760
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,040
virgin?

761
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,370
Being allergic to penicillin is a,

762
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:31,720
you're allergic to all the ceilings.

763
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,220
The mock is still in the stone,

764
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,960
I said.

765
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,740
And those are in other institutions?

766
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:36,020
Yeah,

767
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,820
so and I get strep throat a lot
and like almost once a year.

768
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,680
And so that normally you'd
just take penicillin.

769
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,780
I had no idea you were allergic to that.

770
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:44,570
That's wild.

771
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,560
And some with something
that's not as effective.

772
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,480
How did you find out?

773
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,520
Did you take penicillin
or did they test you?

774
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:51,751
Yeah.

775
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:55,630
As a kid I took it and I broke up in
this huge rash and stuff like that.

776
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:56,464
And then could you agree?

777
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,430
Could you breathe when you
had that was fine breathing,

778
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:02,320
but it was all over me.

779
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,970
So it was pretty gross.

780
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:06,600
But it was obvious it happened
within a certain oh yeah.

781
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:07,510
And it happened immediately.

782
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:08,344
Oh my gosh.

783
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,243
Wow.

784
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,521
Yeah.

785
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:10,354
That's crazy.

786
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,691
So,

787
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:11,524
but you realize,

788
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:11,961
eh,

789
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:13,210
that before penicillin,

790
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,320
the casualties in wars and
stuff were off the charts.

791
00:22:17,321 --> 00:22:21,180
Like what does it world war one is
when it gets invented because yeah,

792
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,170
the lack of good antibiotics to treat
any kind of post a wound infection or any

793
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:30,730
kind of what terrifies me is how nature
is trying to keep up with antibiotics.

794
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:33,310
And they have these Murcia infections
that people get where they are.

795
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,870
They're hospitalized for months.

796
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:35,381
I mean,

797
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:37,390
some people late catch Marissa,

798
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,240
they get what mercy is like
medication resistant staph,

799
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:41,074
something another.

800
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,640
I think that's what it stands for.

801
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,030
But,

802
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,330
uh,

803
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:43,660
it's,

804
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,220
it's particularly,

805
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,143
um,

806
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,351
particularly,

807
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:47,630
uh,

808
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,320
common in surgery cases for some reason.

809
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,281
Like,

810
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:52,360
people have surgery.

811
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,020
What happened?

812
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,351
Nothing.

813
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:55,030
I just caught a look at myself on camera.

814
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,910
That Gilead Cronenberg water buffalo hair.

815
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,180
Someone sitting in the,

816
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,761
what is it?

817
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:01,720
Periscope chat.

818
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:02,820
The of genius here.

819
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,390
That's what I'm going for.

820
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:05,224
A mad genius.

821
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,621
Genius.

822
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:07,030
Here it goes with your purview.

823
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:08,440
Professor Myalgia posted.

824
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,573
Yeah.

825
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,001
What the fuck?

826
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,640
We were just talking about a Merva.

827
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,050
They're being resistant to antibiotics.

828
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:19,210
Murcia that scares the shit out of me
that they're trying to get stronger as we

829
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:19,870
make more.

830
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:19,991
I mean,

831
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:21,640
it's almost like there's a
war go like any bacteria.

832
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,360
That's about it.

833
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,880
Yeah.

834
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,150
The,

835
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,520
the,

836
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:23,680
the,

837
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,450
eventually those won't work well.

838
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,730
Do you know some people
that use them all the time?

839
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,290
They get so crazy that they get the kill
all the resistance in their hands to

840
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,320
other bacteria so they get warts
and shit all over their hands.

841
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:39,660
It's like really common for people to
become addicted to that stuff that Amy is

842
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,451
not a bad idea.

843
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:44,480
Every now and again to give yourself a
little Antivia bacterial on the hands,

844
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,600
stuff that Jay Gelb,

845
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:48,850
it smells like the alcohol.

846
00:23:48,851 --> 00:23:49,641
It's gotta be good for you.

847
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:49,760
It's,

848
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,593
I like medicine,

849
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,710
but some,

850
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,740
my friend went over to looked at a house
and inside of the house was a closet

851
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:55,520
full of the stuff.

852
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,090
What?

853
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:56,570
Yeah,

854
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,440
they were going to buy this house.

855
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:59,420
They went and looked in the house and
they opened this door and there was a

856
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:04,340
fucking closet fill
with one hand sanitizer.

857
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Just bottles and bottles
and bottles and bottles.

858
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,730
Like a crazy person was terrified
of running out of hand sanitizer.

859
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,100
It's been a godsend for Germaphobes.

860
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,611
Yeah.

861
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:16,160
Everyone is an anal drove a
bluffs that cause they just,

862
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:17,370
their average two seconds.

863
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,220
I'm know some people and they're always,

864
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,054
you know,

865
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,250
like that's a psychological thing,

866
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:22,730
right?

867
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,320
It's like odd or what did they call it?

868
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:25,130
OCD.

869
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,491
OCD.

870
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:26,230
Not Ocd.

871
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,400
So don't you think that
that almost like fuels it?

872
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,520
Like having,

873
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,681
that's what I mean,

874
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:31,170
it's,

875
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,490
it's absolutely being validated that
the thing you're afraid of is true.

876
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:35,690
You know,

877
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm afraid of touching
anything or touch anything.

878
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,060
Like I,

879
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,190
when I do my podcast,

880
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,010
I talked to everyone in the audience
before the show for a while and I shake

881
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:43,760
everybody's hand.

882
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,630
So I'm communicating whatever disease
anyone's giving me to everyone and I don't

883
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:48,500
use hand sanitizer.

884
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:52,190
I'll go in the restroom and wash my
hands after that and then start the show.

885
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,980
But we all have to take that chance.

886
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:58,040
We're all humans and live with each other
and it's good for your immune system

887
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,000
tied to lie.

888
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,210
I've never gotten sick from
it and I'm never nothing bad.

889
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,550
Don't go look in your hands though.

890
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,541
Like I say,

891
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:05,720
I'll wash my hands after the shell.

892
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,500
I did not.

893
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,010
I did not,

894
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,460
uh,

895
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,170
pleasure myself or dance around her.

896
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:09,950
Make a Taco or it.

897
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,200
And how is it that this is a concern?

898
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:14,810
Just think about the actual
existence of human beings.

899
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:19,520
How bizarre is it that there's a concern
that you might get an organism that's

900
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:21,350
attached to another person?

901
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:26,550
That organism will threaten the very
ecosystem that your life depends on.

902
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,431
That's real.

903
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:29,750
Like that's how people get colds.

904
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,200
You,

905
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,360
you're rubbing up against an organism.

906
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:36,920
You get it in your body because it came
off of someone else's body and it may or

907
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:37,754
may not kill you.

908
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,930
And I like the flu.

909
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,980
How many times have you shaken all these
hands after a show and then fingered a

910
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:46,590
girl without washing your hands
and now that I'm in ducks,

911
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,421
that goes without saying,

912
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,850
but I think everyone can relate to that.

913
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,703
Brian.

914
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,020
No,

915
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,330
I wash my hands after shows.

916
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:53,660
Yeah,

917
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,670
I washed my hands and also we,

918
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:56,390
you know,

919
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,470
I don't think about it that much,

920
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:58,550
but now that we're on the subject,

921
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,910
the microphone never gets
cleaned off like a gym.

922
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
You would never touch
equipment that didn't.

923
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:05,630
We occasionally get something
like show your face,

924
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,010
you kind of kiss it sometimes.

925
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,070
How many times do you accidentally put
your mouth or you're making it sound

926
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,750
effecting your and your your sucks.

927
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,450
And I get the most who's face,

928
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,370
I get it all up in the Mike all the time.

929
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:17,070
And Jill,

930
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,930
you know and like you're sterilize I
think never touched him with alcohol and

931
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,740
really they should.

932
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,020
We not,

933
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,000
now that I think about it,

934
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:23,834
maybe this guy's thing,

935
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,630
maybe I'll go Todd glass on everyone
and have them change the lighting and

936
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:27,241
sterilize.

937
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:31,290
The worst case scenario is these
things and he's foam thing.

938
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,050
This is just a receptical we're spitting
into that fucking thing and there's

939
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,490
like growing all kinds
of weird funky shit.

940
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:40,550
I bet if we had a microphone and we
looked at what's actually going on in the

941
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:41,660
foam of this microphone,

942
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:43,070
I suppose we'd be fucking terrified.

943
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,440
Oh yeah.

944
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,980
It'd be like

945
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,180
the clouds of Venus or whatever.

946
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:46,800
There'd be every manner
of thing growing in there.

947
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:47,470
That'd be pretty cool.

948
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,720
Taking all that DNA though.

949
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,740
You know how many people have talked
into that microphone and David Lee Roth?

950
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,540
Yeah.

951
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,480
I wonder how,

952
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,800
how long does that stick around?

953
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:57,660
Forever.

954
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,493
That's fine.

955
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,460
I think like for like spit,

956
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,930
it's gotta be pretty fresh.

957
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,700
You can't use a hundred year old spit.

958
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,151
Like,

959
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:06,361
you know,

960
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:08,880
if somebody's sucked on a
flute a hundred years ago,

961
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,310
I really doubt that.

962
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:11,700
Go and get some DNA off.

963
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:13,410
That's a good question
and I can't answer it,

964
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:15,960
but I want it off what you're just saying.

965
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,430
I was in Philly like a year or two
ago and I went to independence hall.

966
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,760
Right.

967
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,510
And they got the several drafts of
the declaration of independence,

968
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:30,010
the pre drafts before the one that we all
know and it says on the explanation on

969
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:31,254
the wall,

970
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,950
um,

971
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,510
George w a Benjamin Franklin and George
Washington is sweat and DNA is all over

972
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:39,840
this because they were like
this over it with pans writing.

973
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,340
And so I wonder if the spit lasts
because they were according to this,

974
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:48,630
it's like them touching it and their hair
landing on it and then sweating on it

975
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:49,500
was enough to,

976
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,150
you could extract.

977
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,610
It's definitely DNA in the future
if it hasn't been created yet.

978
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:54,950
Right.

979
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,460
If we can't pick it up now.

980
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,343
Right.

981
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,820
Whether it would be a
whole read out of them,

982
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,161
you know,

983
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:05,161
and we'll come a complete DNA molecule
or whether it would just be some of it,

984
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:06,270
I dunno.

985
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,020
But they were like,

986
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,450
oh Benjamin Franklins Dnas all over this.

987
00:28:09,451 --> 00:28:10,350
Then like literally,

988
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,030
and I was like,

989
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,710
that's kind of exciting to think
about them just sitting there going,

990
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:15,370
I'm going to win in the court.

991
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,390
How do you spell you know,

992
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,250
course and you know,

993
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:21,480
match cause there's all these scratch
outs on it and ink and I'm touching it and

994
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,130
poor wiping techniques.

995
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,270
Well like that they didn't know hygiene.

996
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,420
The thing I think about when
you look at the old even brush,

997
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:27,720
no,

998
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,010
the thing about old paintings,

999
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,640
uh,

1000
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,450
uh,

1001
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,880
is you know that someone's,

1002
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,391
you know,

1003
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:38,250
the physical act of that's always
that to me that brings the pass back

1004
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:38,761
instantly.

1005
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:40,290
Cause it's like the genuine article.

1006
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,210
If someone made a painting 500 years ago,

1007
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:43,590
like you see a Davinci or something,

1008
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,000
he certainly went,

1009
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,613
you know,

1010
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,120
and had paint on his face and,

1011
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,970
and touch you with his hands and
put the brushes and you know,

1012
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,280
got up to it and I stood back from it.

1013
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:54,060
And then,

1014
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,600
you know,

1015
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,810
you're seeing the completed article but
the process that went into it is like

1016
00:28:57,811 --> 00:28:59,190
any plastic cart.

1017
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,211
Yeah.

1018
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:02,880
It isn't the immediacy of them making it,

1019
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,450
it's kind of fascinating how once you
give something a name like Dna and it

1020
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:11,490
becomes a normal part of your discussion,

1021
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,440
it,

1022
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,960
you,

1023
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,010
you kind of forget how crazy.

1024
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,220
Just being able to lick something and
leave fucking DNA is the idea that your a

1025
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,361
stamp,

1026
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:29,361
like you're sending a bill and you lick
it and you see that stamp that has your

1027
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:34,401
fucking genetic markers on it and
they can identify you really well,

1028
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,410
like down to like in the high nine days,

1029
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:38,160
right?

1030
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,550
It's like not a hundred but we know it's
you bitch and they take these fucking,

1031
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,300
these saliva samples and all
sorts of different samples.

1032
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:48,850
They can get DNA off of skin hair,

1033
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,840
but did she get it?

1034
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,010
But here's the hair thing.

1035
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,001
Did you hear that?

1036
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:53,110
The hair science,

1037
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,870
like there's a good
percentage of it is bullshit.

1038
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,091
Yeah.

1039
00:29:56,091 --> 00:30:01,091
Was actually invented by the FBI and
responsible for hundreds of convictions

1040
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,520
where the doctors like war
fucking lab coat and said,

1041
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,430
without a doubt 100% of these
came from the same person or it's,

1042
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:09,590
again,

1043
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,800
it goes back 20 years since
they started the program.

1044
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,960
I read about it last weekend.

1045
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,900
Scandalous.

1046
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,520
It's not just scandalous.

1047
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:16,750
It's horrific.

1048
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,280
People were put to death.

1049
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,461
Yeah.

1050
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:21,040
They were people who were
put to death for crimes.

1051
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:24,670
Who the fuck knows if they
were guilty or weren't guilty?

1052
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,300
But if the tipping point
was this hair thing,

1053
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,280
that's gotta be murder,

1054
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,660
right?

1055
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,420
Right.

1056
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,090
That's merge the state murdering pits.

1057
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,180
That's murder.

1058
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:34,960
Why can't,

1059
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,460
why can't we charge them with murder?

1060
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,001
Will we try?

1061
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,610
You think anything will come of it?

1062
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,090
Um,

1063
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,180
I think it's a shit storm.

1064
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:42,010
It went away right after I first saw it.

1065
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,570
Um,

1066
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,700
but that's definitely the kind
of thing you have hearings about.

1067
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:46,270
I think,

1068
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,100
you know what [inaudible] programs,

1069
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:48,730
things like that.

1070
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,470
There's a fundamental huge
flaw in the system and the one,

1071
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:52,620
the,

1072
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,290
the fucking fundamental flaw of the
justice system is there's winning and

1073
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,124
losing.

1074
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,250
And when people get involved
in winning and losing,

1075
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,360
they cheat.

1076
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,141
They lie,

1077
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:02,920
they steal,

1078
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,490
they want to win because winning becomes
more important than anything else,

1079
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,720
especially the good guys.

1080
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:08,920
Because the good guys want to win.

1081
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,950
Winning becomes more important than even
justice and truth because along the way

1082
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,543
they develop,

1083
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,980
they develop this attitude like,

1084
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:18,271
look,

1085
00:31:18,271 --> 00:31:19,270
if I'm going after them,

1086
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:20,950
they're already fucking
guilty of something else.

1087
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,990
I know who's guilty,

1088
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,040
especially when they're dealing with like
young kids that might have fucked up a

1089
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:27,750
few times,

1090
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,770
been to juvenile home.

1091
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,590
I went to jail.

1092
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,160
Like they'll,

1093
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,040
they will literally cause crimes like,

1094
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:37,570
but give people sentences
that they don't deserve.

1095
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,450
Lock them up with
fucking planted evidence.

1096
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:41,284
Like this is not,

1097
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,220
it's not an uncommon thing
that only existed in a movie.

1098
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,390
If we saw it in real life,

1099
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:45,730
you'd be like,

1100
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,720
oh right.

1101
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,040
If we saw someone planting a gun on a
murder suspect or a a murder victim,

1102
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,750
we wouldn't even think twice.

1103
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:53,051
We would like,

1104
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:53,884
of course they did it.

1105
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,911
These people do this.

1106
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:55,960
Sometimes it's not.

1107
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:59,380
And everyone who becomes a cop is just
the one thing that everyone who becomes a

1108
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:02,260
cop has in common is they're all people.

1109
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:02,950
No,

1110
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,820
that's still one thing.

1111
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:08,770
And so that alone would let you believe
that most people should never be fucking

1112
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:09,460
cops.

1113
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:09,831
Like dump.

1114
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:13,870
The vast majority of people should
never be trusted with that kind of

1115
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:14,590
responsibility.

1116
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,520
No Way.

1117
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,370
That kind of power and then
when that gets a B is like,

1118
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,661
you know,

1119
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:20,210
now we've seen that the,

1120
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,530
you know,

1121
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,490
the last six months,

1122
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,890
last two days that the,

1123
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,240
the police state,

1124
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:26,290
the overfunding,

1125
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,760
the militarization,

1126
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,020
the absolute lack of code when it comes
to black people or the underclass.

1127
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:32,770
And then,

1128
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,000
then it just piles up,

1129
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,300
you know,

1130
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:34,810
then the,

1131
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,380
now we see it though more and more
now we're highly keenly tuned into it,

1132
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,170
especially,

1133
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:39,530
uh,

1134
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,160
Walter Scott

1135
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,210
got aced on video phone
horribly a couple of weeks ago.

1136
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,000
But what is that?

1137
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,530
Uh,

1138
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:45,920
the,

1139
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,581
the guy in,

1140
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:47,030
um,

1141
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,020
which town was it in?

1142
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,550
Walter Scott and from her,

1143
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,511
it's on the video,

1144
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,100
you see the cop put slugs
and the guy who got shot,

1145
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:54,200
it was running away a bit.

1146
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,080
She had a pork.

1147
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,390
Oh God.

1148
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,630
So like now we're real
acutely aware that cops,

1149
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,410
like you say,

1150
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:05,060
our people and panic sheet people go
crazy with the use their situation they're

1151
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:05,330
in.

1152
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,510
They develop personal animosity for
this person they're trying to take out

1153
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:09,830
because it becomes a competition,

1154
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,840
becomes a competition of arresting them.

1155
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:13,700
Then it becomes a competition
of convicting them.

1156
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,990
It becomes us against them and even if
you're a great guy and you're the perfect

1157
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:18,980
guy for being a cop,

1158
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,080
you always have to be on guard of some
fucking asshole trying to shoot you or

1159
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:25,170
jumping on you and punchy.

1160
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,420
When you're arresting people,

1161
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,340
you have to always be on your complete
red alert because we've all seen those

1162
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:35,420
videos of cops that were like pulling
people over and then they got shot or

1163
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:36,260
pulling people over it.

1164
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:39,230
They've seen the one where the woman
pulls the guy over and the guy beats the

1165
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:42,570
shit out of the woman in front of his
daughter and his daughter's screen

1166
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:43,010
stopped.

1167
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:43,843
Daddy stopped.

1168
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,890
He knocks her out and
beats the shit out of her.

1169
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:46,850
When she's unconscious,

1170
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,380
it's horrific.

1171
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,581
It just shows you,

1172
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:50,414
first of all,

1173
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,440
you can't have a lone woman
by herself in that scenario.

1174
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,681
I mean,

1175
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:54,981
we all,

1176
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:57,050
everyone wants to believe in equal rights.

1177
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,053
The,

1178
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,610
there's no physical equality
that just doesn't exist.

1179
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,120
And if you're going to be a woman and
you're going to be in a situation where

1180
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,170
you have to arrest a big physical man,

1181
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,470
you can't let them get anywhere near you
ever can't let them get it anywhere in

1182
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:09,590
here.

1183
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,220
Yeah,

1184
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,431
you,

1185
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:10,671
you,

1186
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:14,060
you have to make sure that
everybody that's around you,

1187
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,800
whether it's a other cops are,

1188
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,830
they know what's going on.

1189
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,580
They know where you are right now because
it's highly likely that this guy's

1190
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,540
gonna make an irrational decision
to just beat the fuck out of you.

1191
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,550
And if you don't get to your gun and time,

1192
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,473
you're done.

1193
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,040
And that's the case with men too.

1194
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,590
So those men have to
constantly be worried about it.

1195
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:31,580
They was the constantly,

1196
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,160
when they're,

1197
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,720
so,

1198
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,360
they're always fucking
freaking out and tense.

1199
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,430
It's almost a job that no one can do.

1200
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:38,511
Well,

1201
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:38,871
how do you,

1202
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,270
how do you do it every day and,

1203
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,990
and measure the justice every day.

1204
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:45,860
And then when you see how shit the
system is and when you see how even the

1205
00:34:45,861 --> 00:34:49,820
people you are arresting and they have
to live amongst their life's not so hot

1206
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,600
and you know what I mean?

1207
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,830
You'll either find out
of you're arresting,

1208
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:54,080
you should feel sorry for her
at both ends of the spectrum.

1209
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:55,250
Because on the one hand,

1210
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:56,900
like when you saw that Ferguson report,

1211
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,620
the mandate from the city was you go
out and you'd get those fines because

1212
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:01,101
that's how,

1213
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,930
that's how we generate
income in this town.

1214
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,160
You go out and arrest people,

1215
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:06,050
you pull people over for license plates,

1216
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:06,884
lights,

1217
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,300
any old miner it for being black,

1218
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:08,931
just whatever.

1219
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:10,220
You just make that happen.

1220
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,570
And so in the report at said they were
getting pressured to be those kinds of

1221
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,000
cops that had to just
minor infractions where,

1222
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,190
how the city was making his money.

1223
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,060
That's so crazy.

1224
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:23,990
That's a completed version of how we
perceive what the police were supposed to

1225
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:26,150
do because we're paying the taxes,

1226
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:26,291
blah,

1227
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:26,411
blah,

1228
00:35:26,411 --> 00:35:26,561
blah.

1229
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:28,700
So glorified revenue collecting.

1230
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,121
Right,

1231
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:29,690
and that,

1232
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,070
but that puts something on
them that they didn't sign it.

1233
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:32,720
Exactly.

1234
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,321
You know what I mean?

1235
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:36,440
Like when the troops have to defend money,

1236
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:38,040
positions and interests for our

1237
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,521
country,

1238
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:39,900
that's when I get huffy.

1239
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:41,040
You know like people are like,

1240
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:41,471
right,

1241
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:42,241
he should be for the troops.

1242
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:42,451
I'm like,

1243
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:43,350
I'm all for the chiefs.

1244
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:47,640
You put them in poisonous danger with
shit that's not tested or know a body

1245
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:52,641
armor or poorly armored vehicles that
get blown up by iads and stuff and that's

1246
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,263
our fault.

1247
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,021
You know what I mean?

1248
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:55,740
You're,

1249
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,280
that's the government being malfeasant
and not protecting the people.

1250
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,520
It's asking them to do something
that's more than you signed up.

1251
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:04,200
Now imagine if the cops,

1252
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,780
the soldiers rather also
how to write tickets.

1253
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,940
They had to collect money
from an essence they here,

1254
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:09,570
right?

1255
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,560
They didn't essence they do,

1256
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:14,400
but you can imagine they also have to
deliver money situation where not only did

1257
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:15,720
they have to go and fight wars,

1258
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:17,130
but they also had the ticket.

1259
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:18,210
These people pull over.

1260
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:19,380
You look,

1261
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:20,850
if once it happens,

1262
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,140
then that's what it is.

1263
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,820
And that's the problem with cops.

1264
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,090
Like we can't think of a time where a
cop wouldn't be riding speeding tickets,

1265
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,350
but it's fucking ridiculous.

1266
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:29,580
You're making a cop do that.

1267
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,620
Either someone's violating the law,

1268
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:35,190
which means they needed to be brought
into jail or it's not that big a deal.

1269
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,330
It's one or the other.

1270
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,351
It's one or the other.

1271
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:41,460
You can't just take money from people
because they touched the gas pedal a

1272
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:42,061
little too hard,

1273
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:42,660
but they do.

1274
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,441
And parking fines,

1275
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:44,380
I mean la,

1276
00:36:44,381 --> 00:36:44,850
you know,

1277
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,620
I lived in San Francisco and London,

1278
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,600
the three places I've
lived and parking is,

1279
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:49,320
you know,

1280
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,270
that's the whole income of the city.

1281
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,090
Yeah,

1282
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:52,290
yeah.

1283
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,160
Parking's giant.

1284
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:56,450
If they made free parking and didn't
write out parking tickets and then you

1285
00:36:56,451 --> 00:36:56,580
know,

1286
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,140
they can make a little bit
of money from the change,

1287
00:36:58,141 --> 00:36:59,520
but they bank on you fucking up.

1288
00:36:59,550 --> 00:36:59,851
Oh yeah,

1289
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:00,360
they do.

1290
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,751
What is it?

1291
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,220
60 bucks to go over the meter.

1292
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,180
$69 60 and then if you don't
pay it in like two weeks,

1293
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:09,510
I had immediately jumps to like 150
and you don't pay that for like a week.

1294
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:14,511
That goes to like 300 we used to throw
them in our glove box car before that

1295
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:15,481
happened.

1296
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:16,950
And when I lived in San Francisco,

1297
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:21,450
I had a crappy Chevy Vega that like he
had to put two quarts of oil in every

1298
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:21,451
day.

1299
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:22,280
And you know,

1300
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,720
every,

1301
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,191
nothing worked.

1302
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,800
But unless you've got a thousand tickets,

1303
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:28,980
the first year I lived in San Francisco
and I threw them all in the glove box.

1304
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:33,030
And finally a bench warrant was issued
and I was hired to go appear in front of

1305
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:33,864
a judge.

1306
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,740
And at that point,

1307
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,630
this is like 1980 it was like
$1,500 worth of $5 tickets.

1308
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:40,020
Right?

1309
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,820
Or Wow.

1310
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,653
And they went,

1311
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,330
she went like,

1312
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,560
what is your problem?

1313
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,790
And I'm sorry,

1314
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:45,570
your honor.

1315
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:45,931
She goes,

1316
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:46,021
well,

1317
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:46,591
what are you going to do?

1318
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:46,951
And I'm like,

1319
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:47,480
oh no,

1320
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,151
I don't have any money.

1321
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:48,560
You know,

1322
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:48,810
she,

1323
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,570
she,

1324
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,960
she went 450 get outta here.

1325
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:52,800
You know?

1326
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,430
Wow.

1327
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,650
So I think I painted over
like a couple of months.

1328
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,670
I didn't even have $450 so you know,

1329
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:02,160
I paid like my car got booted once got
booted because it didn't pay the tickets,

1330
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,023
parking tickets.

1331
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,460
Did you have to call someone
to come and do it or,

1332
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,190
I think I had to go
somewhere and pay some money.

1333
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,110
It was a long time ago.

1334
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:12,780
It was in the 90s I remember it was in la.

1335
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,273
I got the boot.

1336
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:14,790
Yup.

1337
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,210
And in London they took the car up and
put it on a truck and take it away.

1338
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,600
Wow.

1339
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,280
Whoa assholes.

1340
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,890
You can't just take someone's
car because they owe you money.

1341
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,840
The car's worth way more than
the fucking parking ticket.

1342
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:26,971
It's astounding.

1343
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:31,170
I found out the other day I was going
through my mail and I had almost thrown it

1344
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:33,270
away that I guess when I was in San Diego,

1345
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:36,220
I went on one of those highways
that I guess was a toll road,

1346
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,470
but they don't even tell you or
there they might have told you.

1347
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:40,690
But it's real easy to
just get on and get off.

1348
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:41,650
And not even know you're on it.

1349
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,180
They take a picture of your license.

1350
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,420
He didn't pay and I
didn't even know about it.

1351
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:47,410
And uh,

1352
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,100
it,

1353
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,550
I owe like a lot of money because
I didn't have a bunch of times.

1354
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,960
I forget now it's,

1355
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:54,160
it's cause it was like two,

1356
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:56,680
like two months old or three
months old or something like that.

1357
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,660
And I still kept going up again.

1358
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,653
Yeah.

1359
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,341
Yeah.

1360
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:02,350
I got one from Illinois after Christmas.

1361
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:06,760
I did a Gig in Arlington or somewhere
and I went on a toll road and I was like,

1362
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,900
did I pay,

1363
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:08,141
you know,

1364
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:09,580
I just went through a thing and then like,

1365
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,000
was I supposed to stop because
there was no people manning.

1366
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:13,930
That's a trick.

1367
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,450
People manning it and
then like there were,

1368
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:19,180
I can see there were lanes where
people had discs and I thought,

1369
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,260
oh shit.

1370
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,270
As soon as I went through
it and sure enough,

1371
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,910
a week later my wife goes,

1372
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,490
when were you in Carbondale,

1373
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:27,831
Illinois?

1374
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:28,121
Or you know,

1375
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:28,631
or whatever.

1376
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:29,464
And I went,

1377
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,530
I was driving from Chicago and I
drove in a double room and she's like,

1378
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:34,300
well it's $25 or whatever,

1379
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,134
you know?

1380
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,190
Yeah.

1381
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,023
That's uh,

1382
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,250
that's that thing where they used to do,

1383
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,620
when you go through a red light and they
would take a picture of your license

1384
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:42,454
plates and that illegal,

1385
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,110
yeah,

1386
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,020
that was deemed illegal.

1387
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,970
Oh Wow.

1388
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,140
They still use it in
west Hollywood and stuff.

1389
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,410
Do they still use it to see
them but other day I haven't.

1390
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,070
Um,

1391
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,570
I don't know if they use them though.

1392
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:56,050
I don't know if they still write tickets
because I'm pretty sure they deem that

1393
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:59,890
unconstitutional because it was a third
party that was profiting off of it.

1394
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,120
It was a private company.

1395
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,820
So like you really didn't
have to pay those tickets.

1396
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,130
Like when you would get one of those
tickets and it would say you ran a red

1397
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:06,401
light,

1398
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:07,151
we want a hundred bucks.

1399
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:08,410
Like they were getting the money,

1400
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,780
like the money wasn't going to
the state and everybody's like,

1401
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:10,991
Hey,

1402
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,180
what the fuck are you doing?

1403
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,360
You're going to have a private
company that also profits from it.

1404
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,840
I mean the state must have
gotten a piece of the action,

1405
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,920
but it was easier for
them to just farm it out.

1406
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:21,071
Well,

1407
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:21,904
I mean

1408
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,960
that's why there's an alien billion
zillion people in prison in this country.

1409
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:29,080
It's not cause that many people have
done anything worthy of being in prison.

1410
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:29,411
Yeah.

1411
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:32,260
And we'll end the function of that whole
system where someone's a winter and

1412
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:33,094
someone's a loser.

1413
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,080
Like when you see people win when they
win in court and they found not guilty.

1414
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,780
And that's like the three
pointer of all three pointers.

1415
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:41,561
You know,

1416
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,940
if you're about to go
to jail and you're like,

1417
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,290
remember when Oj Simpson,

1418
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:45,160
when they said not guilty?

1419
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:45,491
And he was like,

1420
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:46,324
really?

1421
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,223
Really,

1422
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,033
really?

1423
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,870
Oh,

1424
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,381
you can see that.

1425
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,250
Look on his face.

1426
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,443
That guy,

1427
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,710
I mean he was trying to play poker,

1428
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:55,540
but he hit the lottery.

1429
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,880
He knew it and he won three pointer,

1430
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,050
Swish,

1431
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,550
nothing but net home run over the
building into the parking lot.

1432
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:04,680
Pray King car when,

1433
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,940
I mean he won.

1434
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,690
Right.

1435
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,570
That you can't have winners and losers
when it comes to laws and court.

1436
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,740
That's just too crazy.

1437
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,590
That's weird that he didn't
just hide after that.

1438
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,980
Like it was such a huge win
that why would you even,

1439
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,970
when did you just like not leave the
house for the rest of your life and no,

1440
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,730
he didn't want,

1441
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,320
I mean I think he didn't want anybody
to think that he's in jail now.

1442
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,880
He's in jail now for felonies.

1443
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,740
Well he's in jail now for,

1444
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:34,010
I think they called it kidnapping
and something along those lines.

1445
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:35,390
Some armed something that,

1446
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:36,560
that was the Caper in Vegas.

1447
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:37,130
Right.

1448
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,120
That was the thing in Vegas where he
was a victim of someone taking his stuff

1449
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:41,990
and selling it.

1450
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:46,820
Like some of his memorabilia got sold by
this guy and he wanted to get his stuff

1451
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:47,031
back.

1452
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:52,031
So we brought some dudes who brought
some guns and as soon as that's the case,

1453
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:53,204
you're fucks.

1454
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,900
Yeah.

1455
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,250
And the government came in and they go,

1456
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:55,820
dude,

1457
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,130
we've been looking for an
excuse to put you away.

1458
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,620
And so they just locked him up.

1459
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,090
But he's fucked psyche.

1460
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:03,170
Say it with my life.

1461
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:05,870
And now I say it like when
you know how Hollywood is.

1462
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:06,650
So,

1463
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,940
especially young actresses,

1464
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:08,361
they get out,

1465
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:09,140
jog dad,

1466
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,951
they go crazy.

1467
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:12,890
The next thing you know you've seen a
picture of them and then they're in the

1468
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:16,910
street upside down and
then they stay here and,

1469
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,450
or maybe they go to rehab for a month
and we always go move to France,

1470
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,001
moved somewhere with,

1471
00:42:22,001 --> 00:42:22,950
they'll appreciate you.

1472
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,980
You're still a star in Europe or whatever,

1473
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:25,790
no matter what.

1474
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,810
And in other countries,

1475
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,100
they don't look at it the same way,

1476
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:32,890
but why stay here under the scrutiny
of TMZ and all of a sudden was getting

1477
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:33,710
their bench.

1478
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,140
That fucking Rosetta stone
is a pain in the ass.

1479
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,960
If you want to really laugh French,

1480
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:38,870
it takes too long.

1481
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:39,763
They're lazy,

1482
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,320
they want to do coke and get fucked.

1483
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,030
They are lazy eye.

1484
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:44,691
I'm like,

1485
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:44,931
Mike,

1486
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:45,800
when Michael Jackson,

1487
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:46,670
when the shit hit the fan,

1488
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,140
he likes stayed and you know,

1489
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:48,950
and you think,

1490
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,630
well eventually country man
did [inaudible] which was like,

1491
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:54,050
wait,

1492
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:54,770
what I,

1493
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:58,360
which is really weird cause you're
going to a slave state dictatorship,

1494
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,241
you know,

1495
00:42:59,241 --> 00:42:59,820
uh,

1496
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,780
Mrh that's run by royal people who have,

1497
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,740
there's no like,

1498
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,370
yeah.

1499
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:05,203
You know,

1500
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,613
democracy.

1501
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,300
Like who was the idea there?

1502
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,230
No one gets to vote.

1503
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,880
Why the fuck would he move there?

1504
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:14,060
Why don't you give me protected
by rich people that he felt safe?

1505
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,170
That must be right.

1506
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,510
That must've been when all the
legal shit was hitting the fan.

1507
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,770
It's a wall of rich people.

1508
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,401
God,

1509
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:20,360
that's terrifying.

1510
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,050
My couldn't,

1511
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,130
we will have your back.

1512
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,970
And my joke was he
staying at the Iman side,

1513
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:26,090
a boy hotel.

1514
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,530
Now I just feel bad about him.

1515
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:30,771
You know,

1516
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:32,510
like I watched the video
sometimes and think,

1517
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,321
God damn,

1518
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,570
he really was the fucking gifted,

1519
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,260
you know?

1520
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:36,771
Oh yeah.

1521
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:37,161
But I mean,

1522
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:38,510
how about the fact that it was just,

1523
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,700
he was made a star when he was a young,

1524
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,031
young,

1525
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:41,690
young boy,

1526
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,720
his psyche,

1527
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:43,580
of course it does.

1528
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:44,331
It's impossible.

1529
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:47,210
You can't go through
life learning about the,

1530
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:51,470
the trials and tribulations of being a
human being amongst other human beings on

1531
00:43:51,471 --> 00:43:51,711
earth.

1532
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:54,650
If you never feel like you're
one with all those people around,

1533
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:55,300
you know,

1534
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,340
I know this from five
cry on all that money,

1535
00:43:58,341 --> 00:43:59,140
man,

1536
00:43:59,140 --> 00:43:59,973
who,

1537
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,171
well,

1538
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:03,620
I feel about him the same way I feel
about if you've seen that video of those

1539
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:06,500
young kids in Baltimore that
robbed the RT camera crew,

1540
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,610
they robbed them on camera
while I was riding was going on.

1541
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,503
Dude,

1542
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,830
you've ever seen it?

1543
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:13,380
No.

1544
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,360
You gotta you gotta play this.

1545
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,140
We gotta play this,

1546
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,580
these guys from our t,

1547
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:18,210
first of all those people from rt,

1548
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,820
that's where Abby Martin,

1549
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,480
uh,

1550
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,960
started out and they have fucking balls.

1551
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:25,640
Been people dismiss our tea
because it's rushing owned,

1552
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,120
but they're reporters do
some ballsy fucking shit.

1553
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:29,901
And,

1554
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:30,410
um,

1555
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,243
they were,

1556
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,130
while all

1557
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,170
the protests were going
on for the young man.

1558
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,540
What is Freddie,

1559
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,570
what was his name?

1560
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:37,220
This is the new,

1561
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,790
was Freddie Gray's at it?

1562
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:39,810
Was it?

1563
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,500
I can't remember.

1564
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,333
I don't remember.

1565
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,490
W the,

1566
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,730
it was a young man that
was in police custody.

1567
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:45,930
Uh,

1568
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,930
and there was some discrepancy of how
he died and he died from trauma and they

1569
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:53,220
think that the police
beat this guy to death.

1570
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,140
So there's this huge,

1571
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:00,230
huge backlash because people can only
see so many black dudes get shot by cops

1572
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:07,650
are choked by cops or beaten by
cops or shot running away unarmed.

1573
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:11,040
They can only see so much of that and
now they've hit this breaking point.

1574
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,701
I hope so.

1575
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:13,050
I hope this changes things

1576
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,150
going on since Eric Garner
and now it's been rolling on.

1577
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,150
So it's the fucking beginning.

1578
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,420
No skyline.

1579
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:20,683
But you know.

1580
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:21,450
Yeah,

1581
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,283
yeah.

1582
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,410
But like everybody who
wants there to be no crime,

1583
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,950
you got to think about like we,

1584
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:32,990
we will all sympathize with poor Michael
Jackson born to this crazy family of

1585
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,740
entertainers and made famous when he was
young and had a predilection allegedly

1586
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:39,870
for young boys is poor fucker.

1587
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,471
And it's crazy.

1588
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,560
Twisted childhood every day.

1589
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:46,260
All across the country and ghettos.

1590
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:48,960
There are horrific scenarios playing out.

1591
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,280
The babies are growing up and then it's
not all babies is not all poor people,

1592
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,140
but we're not talking just poor.

1593
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:59,310
We're talking poor that are surrounded
by desperate people pour that are

1594
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:03,180
surrounded by people that
have grown up doing crime.

1595
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,100
Like their whole life
has been about crime.

1596
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:07,440
Everyone around them is involved in crime.

1597
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,250
You're gonna run into those
people occasionally where
a good percentage of the

1598
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:14,130
families in and out of
jail where it seems normal.

1599
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,750
It seems rational.

1600
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,640
How about that person?

1601
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,830
How about that person when
she's got to go to college,

1602
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,590
when she's 18 w what?

1603
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,050
What fucking horrific
PTSD does she have from,

1604
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,210
from growing up in the worst sections
of Compton or Inglewood or wines.

1605
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:29,880
Yeah.

1606
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,150
That's why education is important
to spend on the law enforcement.

1607
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,420
If they don't even more intense than that,

1608
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:41,040
it has to be taken to a totally different
place because it's not education terms

1609
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,030
of like come in,

1610
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:42,870
sit down,

1611
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,810
we're going to teach you about George
Washington and his fucking cherry tree.

1612
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:51,140
It's got to be this like completely
invasive supportive system that eliminates

1613
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:52,591
ghettos.

1614
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:56,100
Like you have to eliminate them
if you don't eliminate ghettos.

1615
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:58,360
And I don't mean make it
so that they gentrify it,

1616
00:46:58,361 --> 00:46:59,490
no one can afford living in it.

1617
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:01,040
Cause that's how the
eliminate ghettos and lesbian,

1618
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:04,920
they say they've been plenty of ghettos
eliminated and a lot of towns I've lived

1619
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:05,160
in,

1620
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,610
New York City has a problem in
San Francisco because New York,

1621
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:09,421
there's so much.

1622
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:13,170
The real estate is where it's so much
that they could just come in and there's

1623
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,350
an apartment building
that's like old and shitty.

1624
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,890
That space is worth
ungodly amounts of money.

1625
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,960
If they can convert it
to high end apartments.

1626
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:23,340
I just disappear just like that.

1627
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:23,671
Oh No.

1628
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:24,690
And then people are gone.

1629
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:24,991
No,

1630
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:27,060
you mean improve neighborhoods
where people live?

1631
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:27,670
Yeah.

1632
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:31,840
You going to things like parks and
resources and all of the above cases.

1633
00:47:31,841 --> 00:47:32,674
Kids can go,

1634
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:32,910
yeah,

1635
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:37,390
community centers and
even then how do you get,

1636
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,220
how do you penetrate the home?

1637
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:39,611
You know,

1638
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:43,630
how do you stop horrific
childhoods from emerging?

1639
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:44,141
I mean how do you,

1640
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:46,060
but as human beings it's like,

1641
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:51,070
what are we w we are essentially this
giant community of people that denies it's

1642
00:47:52,081 --> 00:47:52,914
a community.

1643
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:56,950
We have all these methods that we use
to keep ourselves apart from each other,

1644
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:01,470
whether it's Republican or
Democrat or Islamic or Jewish.

1645
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,520
All these little teams that we choose to,

1646
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:04,810
but at the end of the day,

1647
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,590
we're all just one giant race,

1648
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,360
one super organism.

1649
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:10,961
That's it.

1650
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:12,520
And anything that's calendar that,

1651
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,260
anything that's like counterintuitive
to that idea is unhealthy for us.

1652
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:17,620
And well,

1653
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,670
what's counterintuitive?

1654
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,380
Ignore the worst spots.

1655
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,020
Ignore it and get angry at them.

1656
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:23,831
Ignore.

1657
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:24,900
Ignore your hospital,

1658
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:27,000
your cancer that you have in the,

1659
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:27,250
the,

1660
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,270
the biological fiber of your being.

1661
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,560
Ignore that and get angry
at it for being that way.

1662
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:32,930
Well,

1663
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,540
I'll just pull yourself
up by your bootstraps.

1664
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,550
They're strapping a staph infection,

1665
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,510
you know,

1666
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:37,721
I mean,

1667
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:40,240
imagine if that's how you
looked at like a broken ankle.

1668
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:41,350
You fucking pussy.

1669
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,940
You look down at your broken ankle.

1670
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:43,331
How about,

1671
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:43,541
you know,

1672
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:44,710
I'm will give the left ankle.

1673
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,700
Left Ankle is fine.

1674
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,470
Left ankles did the same fucking roads.

1675
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:48,220
You will are,

1676
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,450
it's actually a perfect analogy.

1677
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:49,870
Yeah.

1678
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,460
If you're running and you break one ankle,

1679
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:52,001
you know,

1680
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:52,960
does the good ankle go?

1681
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:53,650
What bitch?

1682
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,350
I fucking did the same
road I worked on this.

1683
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:57,230
This isn't it.

1684
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,130
This is not how it works
as a super organism.

1685
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,160
You can't have places like
this scene in Baltimore.

1686
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:03,994
Did you find the video?

1687
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:08,380
Watch this video because you're going
to freak the fuck out because let's play

1688
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:08,511
good.

1689
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:09,520
He would give it a little volume.

1690
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:10,630
Hopefully our teeth.

1691
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,910
So these guys look at this.

1692
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,603
Yeah.

1693
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,010
So now you see these guys running?

1694
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:48,523
Yep.

1695
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:51,773
She stole it.

1696
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:57,180
He stole her bag and the cops tackled
this guy and took the bag back.

1697
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,010
So the cops saved or how ironic.

1698
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:00,281
Wow.

1699
00:50:00,281 --> 00:50:01,114
Right.

1700
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:02,103
Her crazy.

1701
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:03,903
Everything in play.

1702
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,133
Wow.

1703
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,700
This video highlights a lot of shit,

1704
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:10,380
doesn't it?

1705
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,720
And it illuminates why
you fucking need police.

1706
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,320
Okay,

1707
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:14,861
there you go.

1708
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:17,200
You just saw why you fucking need police.

1709
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,730
You got your bag back.

1710
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:19,270
Why?

1711
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:24,270
Because the police caught the guy who
robbed you on air is that's a good ending.

1712
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:27,441
Damn.

1713
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,130
I mean it's a great ending

1714
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:28,671
for the police.

1715
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:30,440
That's like a fucking that
you would have to think.

1716
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:31,820
That might be like a viral video.

1717
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:32,570
You know?

1718
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,460
You might have to think like
if the police were smart.

1719
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,440
That's what let's like
kind of video you pull out,

1720
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:41,210
have this really super ultra liberal
progressive chick getting robbed by black

1721
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:42,350
dudes and then screaming,

1722
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:43,640
give me back my bag.

1723
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,600
She doesn't once dropping n bombs,

1724
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,060
she's not,

1725
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,230
my cell phone's in there.

1726
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:50,070
You nigger shit.

1727
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,291
You know what I'm saying?

1728
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:52,640
Like she's super progressive.

1729
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:54,680
Probably really smart.

1730
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:55,250
You know,

1731
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,790
brave journalists going in
there and she could say by cops.

1732
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,253
It's crazy.

1733
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,213
That's pretty crazy.

1734
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,960
I think you're right that let,

1735
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:07,460
letting the sickness of poverty just
go on and on and the country where we

1736
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,560
really do have the money
to save everything.

1737
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:10,970
That's real racism.

1738
00:51:10,971 --> 00:51:11,900
That's real.

1739
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,180
And it's not just racist to black people.

1740
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:19,100
It's racist to a gang of
different ethnicities that
are just completely ignored.

1741
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,890
How about poor Asian communities?

1742
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:24,590
There's a lot of like ultra poor Asian
immigrant communities in this country

1743
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,753
ignored,

1744
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,480
ignored.

1745
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,170
Figure it out,

1746
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:27,681
figure it out.

1747
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:28,340
You're on your own.

1748
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,200
And I don't even know what
the solution would be,

1749
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:35,380
but I think there's a big part of the
prison system that's ingrained in these

1750
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:36,680
bad neighborhoods.

1751
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,200
If you're looking at a bad
neighborhood that's just,

1752
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,270
there's crime has always been there.

1753
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:41,870
Okay.

1754
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:45,260
So that means police acted if
activity has always been there.

1755
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,190
So then it becomes like the symbiotic
relationship between police activity and

1756
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:53,870
crime and there's no incentive whatsoever
to try to slow it down other than cops

1757
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:56,250
dying when cops get
shot and killed on the,

1758
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:57,103
on the job.

1759
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,430
That's like when a big push to like sort
of settle crime down and usually it's

1760
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:02,510
just more arrests.

1761
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:02,710
Yeah,

1762
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:03,321
I mean that's the,

1763
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,540
the no one looks at
like the inherent issue.

1764
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,171
There's a,

1765
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:11,171
there's a giant issue that there's winning
and losing shit of arresting people

1766
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:14,860
and punishing them and
trying them and fight.

1767
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,750
They found guilty or not guilty and up.

1768
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:17,690
Yes or a no.

1769
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:20,630
And a green or a red that
beat me becomes a game.

1770
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:21,890
And that game,

1771
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:24,710
no one in that game
wants the game to stop.

1772
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,520
Well,

1773
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,660
it's for profit because the prison
systems for profit and then on top of it,

1774
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:30,290
there's no,

1775
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,700
there's no equity at all.

1776
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,810
All the bankers,

1777
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:32,991
you know,

1778
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:35,900
to make a huge analogy that
all the bankers and everyone
who ruined the economy

1779
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:36,410
and everything,

1780
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,930
none of them did any time and
no one ever laid a hand on them.

1781
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:43,670
But people who commit small crimes and
petty crimes are always getting busted

1782
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:44,300
and turn on a gene.

1783
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,550
Edwards has a brilliant joke about that.

1784
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,960
Here's a brilliant joke about that.

1785
00:52:47,961 --> 00:52:48,794
I don't want to give it away.

1786
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,910
I can't even say the punchline,

1787
00:52:49,911 --> 00:52:53,270
but he's got a brilliant joke about
comparison comparing thugs to bankers,

1788
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:53,540
right?

1789
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,520
Fucking a lariat.

1790
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,060
My Jack has no black teenager ever ruin
the economy on me and no black teenager

1791
00:52:59,061 --> 00:53:00,290
ever invaded Iraq.

1792
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,050
I was like you said with
the accentuation Iraq bitch.

1793
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:06,861
That's why,

1794
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:07,120
uh,

1795
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,920
the smartest man in the world is
like for a lot of other people.

1796
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:11,000
Couldn't pull that off dude.

1797
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,520
Your sense of humor.

1798
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:12,841
It's just like,

1799
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:13,520
just,

1800
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:13,701
you know,

1801
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:15,440
there's some like unique sort of,

1802
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:15,710
uh,

1803
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,150
styles of humor.

1804
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:21,410
Like Brody Stevens is like my favorite
example because the shit that Brody says,

1805
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:23,780
it's only funny if you're Brody Stevens.

1806
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:24,180
Yeah.

1807
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,240
But if you're Brody it's brilliant.

1808
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:27,570
Yeah.

1809
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:32,570
He was fucking destroying one night
like a month ago at the comedy store.

1810
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,000
You know he does that late
night spot after midnight.

1811
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:37,500
You know like all the comics
have already gone off.

1812
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:40,200
The show has been going on since
nine o'clock everyone's exhausted.

1813
00:53:40,201 --> 00:53:42,240
Whoever's there is a
glutton for punishment,

1814
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:42,810
right.

1815
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:46,320
20 people in the audience and then comics
just start filtering in and Brody does

1816
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:47,430
like 45 minutes.

1817
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:50,250
I put some of it on Instagram
where he's playing drums.

1818
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,500
He's got someone's singing the
lawsuit Tisa animal and it's just,

1819
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,250
it's,

1820
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,910
it's the Brody show for the
last hour of the comedy store.

1821
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:01,200
It's the Brody show when he does it,

1822
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,760
it's him and Brian Holtzman.

1823
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:04,710
Those are the masters at that late spot.

1824
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:07,790
And Don Barris to Don
Buress is like Don Berrett.

1825
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,720
Buress is like the master of debacle.

1826
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,411
Like when,

1827
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:14,160
if you want to see something absolutely
ridiculous happen in the crowd.

1828
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:15,300
Late night at the comedy store.

1829
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:16,530
If Don bears is on stage,

1830
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:17,400
it's likely to happen.

1831
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,140
He's the master that like becoming
the ring leader of the crazies.

1832
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,260
He's just so comfortable
with crazy people too.

1833
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,101
That's awesome.

1834
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:27,900
If you have the will to do that,

1835
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,770
you want to go in late and
I didn't and strike it down.

1836
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,840
Well you don't want it for Brody.

1837
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:36,900
That's like the perfect kind of set
course course cause he needs to be in the

1838
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:37,270
moment.

1839
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:38,340
He's very environmental.

1840
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,120
Yeah.

1841
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:39,840
Yeah.

1842
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,950
But he's a perfect example there.

1843
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:41,140
There's,

1844
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,220
there's plenty of video
because it's a reduction.

1845
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,700
He's playlists,

1846
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:55,630
drums making kissy faces and isn't got
a guy out of the audience right next to

1847
00:54:55,631 --> 00:54:58,930
him playing the tambourine
and people don't their,

1848
00:54:58,931 --> 00:54:59,140
you know,

1849
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,140
was people in the front row

1850
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,550
that her from fucking Idaho.

1851
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,580
I've come to the world famous
comedy store and they're like,

1852
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:05,840
what are we seeing?

1853
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,840
But what they're seeing is probably like
one of the coolest things you're ever

1854
00:55:08,841 --> 00:55:09,680
going to get chance to see.

1855
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,530
This is completely free form.

1856
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:17,240
This one dude is just really entertaining
and just having fun off the cuff

1857
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,500
constantly.

1858
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,130
You know,

1859
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:20,240
that plays it so addicting.

1860
00:55:20,241 --> 00:55:23,960
They go to a man I had to take a night
off last night just hanging out that the

1861
00:55:23,961 --> 00:55:28,040
comedy store and they have that new bar
open now in the back or did it open?

1862
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:28,460
Yeah,

1863
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,990
it's like it's a new green room bar.

1864
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,760
Yeah.

1865
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,580
It's critical.

1866
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:31,791
Yeah.

1867
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:35,990
It's like this really cool little VIP
bar and then they're just cleaning it up.

1868
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,853
It's uh,

1869
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,970
it's amazing how that new GM has just
really taken control of that is bad mother

1870
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,380
fucker.

1871
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:41,600
Yeah.

1872
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,550
We knew him from back in
the Tempe Improv days.

1873
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,391
He's always been cool.

1874
00:55:44,391 --> 00:55:45,310
Show Eric.

1875
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:47,120
Yeah.

1876
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,953
Eric and Adam.

1877
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,280
Well who started it?

1878
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:49,671
Who's,

1879
00:55:49,671 --> 00:55:51,170
who's the big cheese over there?

1880
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,033
Eric.

1881
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,130
Eric is the big chess,

1882
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,190
I don't even know Adam is the what?

1883
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,073
Uh,

1884
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,730
booking general manager type duties.

1885
00:55:58,731 --> 00:55:59,030
Yeah,

1886
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,590
he started to,

1887
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:00,423
yeah.

1888
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:04,850
It's just like they needed people that
had some experience in comedy clubs that

1889
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:06,830
weren't crazy and they
never got that before.

1890
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,880
Everybody that used to run the comedy
store was completely out of their fucking

1891
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:11,714
mind,

1892
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,051
you know?

1893
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:14,540
And Adam is just such a laid back,

1894
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,440
easy going,

1895
00:56:15,441 --> 00:56:15,921
dude.

1896
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:18,080
He has like a great
relationship with comics,

1897
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,820
like all the comics that know him.

1898
00:56:19,821 --> 00:56:20,631
Like it's always like,

1899
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:21,191
what's up dude?

1900
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:21,480
It's like,

1901
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:21,630
oh,

1902
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,320
like a genuine friendship
of relationship with him.

1903
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,790
It is the norm Macdonald show and he
also works with Norm Macdonald also.

1904
00:56:27,791 --> 00:56:29,530
So he's like friends with the uh,

1905
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,453
the comics,

1906
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,780
but he's just a good dude.

1907
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,100
Just a good dude to have around too.

1908
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:33,640
He's fun.

1909
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,560
So like he like,

1910
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:35,950
he genuinely liked to see him,

1911
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:38,380
which wasn't the case for that place ever.

1912
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:40,120
You know?

1913
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,050
It's a weird spot,

1914
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:41,530
man.

1915
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,090
Did still there.

1916
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,190
It's still right there on sunset.

1917
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:45,640
Yeah,

1918
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,960
east of Los Anica in the craziest spot
in all of the world of entertainment.

1919
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:50,823
That strip,

1920
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,140
that's what were the
whiskey is we're Hendrix.

1921
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:55,840
He used to play and the doors
used to fucking throw down.

1922
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:59,350
I mean that's right down the street
from where River Phoenix died.

1923
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,191
You know,

1924
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:00,971
that's up the street,

1925
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:01,191
man.

1926
00:57:01,191 --> 00:57:01,601
I'm not that,

1927
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:06,550
that one that's still the Roxy where
Sam Kennison filmed his HBO special and

1928
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:09,160
it's right next door to
the rainbow bar and grill,

1929
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,380
which is like you want to go back in time,

1930
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,420
you want to go to the 80s

1931
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:14,973
they're there,

1932
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:15,791
they're there,

1933
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:17,980
they're fucking drunk as shit
and they had a good time.

1934
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:18,881
It's a,

1935
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:21,700
that's a wild ass part
of part of the country,

1936
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:22,660
not just part of town.

1937
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,913
Yeah it is.

1938
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,671
I don't play this.

1939
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:25,960
I haven't played the store in ages.

1940
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,690
I remember seeing you outside
there once and you are videotaping.

1941
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,300
This is the backroom still
all red and coke Denny,

1942
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,250
the back room.

1943
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,450
Um,

1944
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,710
that oh you like the
green room behind the,

1945
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,010
the comedy store or behind
the main room rather.

1946
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:39,970
Yeah,

1947
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,250
it's a red and white walls.

1948
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:42,790
Yeah.

1949
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:43,481
It's kind of weird.

1950
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:46,120
Like old school neon shit in a fake piano.

1951
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:46,931
The fake piano,

1952
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:49,160
which is probably seeing more lines.

1953
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,710
How many rails?

1954
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,780
Any object in the known universe.

1955
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:53,921
Even now,

1956
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:55,180
one of the legs is broken.

1957
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:57,910
So like if you lean on it and you
have like a big pile of cocaine,

1958
00:57:57,911 --> 00:57:58,850
it just flies on

1959
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:01,263
cane.

1960
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,290
Sam Kinison is rolling in his grave.

1961
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:08,410
It was always these crazy rumors to that
there's a tunnel from the back of the

1962
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:08,950
comedy store.

1963
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:12,160
It goes under the comedy store and it
goes up to crest hill where they had the

1964
00:58:12,161 --> 00:58:14,650
comic's house because when
they bought the house,

1965
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:17,290
they bought the comedy store
together as one package.

1966
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,150
Cause it was like Bugsy Siegel's place,

1967
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:19,750
right?

1968
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:23,620
So they used to live like right up on
crest hill or somebody you didn't sneak

1969
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:25,150
under and there's a fucking tunnel.

1970
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,170
So like if does stuff,

1971
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:26,940
fuzz is,

1972
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:27,773
hey,

1973
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:33,280
we've got to get natal fucked off paints
and get getting the tunnel and just run

1974
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:34,114
up to the hill.

1975
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,560
Tucked themselves in the bed.

1976
00:58:35,561 --> 00:58:36,460
What officer?

1977
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:40,870
I've been in bed this whole
evening notion back then.

1978
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:41,830
There's no DNA.

1979
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,500
They couldn't,

1980
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:42,730
you know,

1981
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:44,050
of course it will touch this door knob.

1982
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:44,441
Stupid.

1983
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:45,274
What?

1984
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,410
There's an essence of
you on the door knob.

1985
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:48,730
See we brought it back around.

1986
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:49,660
Yeah,

1987
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,200
the DNA at the comedy store
and coke on that table.

1988
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,000
I'm sure there's residue from the,

1989
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,610
did you ever do the cocaine
great groups I have done.

1990
00:58:57,730 --> 00:58:58,510
Have you?

1991
00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:59,343
I have.

1992
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:00,430
I'm not doing it now,

1993
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,293
but have you ever,

1994
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,180
did you ever go through
a period where we went,

1995
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:05,350
I don't think I should
do this stuff anymore?

1996
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:06,910
I know because it was never,

1997
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:09,940
I never seriously did it
a lot because it's not,

1998
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,470
I'm more of a pothead.

1999
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,770
I know the feeling jacked,

2000
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,693
uh,

2001
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,920
wasn't for me.

2002
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,960
It's I have to drink gallons of Lod Cath.

2003
00:59:19,961 --> 00:59:21,070
I do cocaine and I,

2004
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,070
I'll drink anyway.

2005
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,311
Yeah.

2006
00:59:22,311 --> 00:59:23,420
Because I can't sleep.

2007
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:23,901
Oh.

2008
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:25,220
Just to kind of calm down,

2009
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:25,571
you know,

2010
00:59:25,571 --> 00:59:27,650
like the basically coke is there.

2011
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,320
She can drink as much as
you can humanly get down.

2012
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,840
My joke was because he'd go to the dealer.

2013
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:36,440
So I used to do a real long routine
about cocaine because George Bush said,

2014
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,720
w Bush said he didn't remember.

2015
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,061
But then I did coke.

2016
00:59:40,061 --> 00:59:40,190
Yeah.

2017
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,000
Someone said,

2018
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,300
wow,

2019
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,021
did you do cook?

2020
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:42,501
Kenny goes,

2021
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:43,161
I don't remember.

2022
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:43,730
And I was like,

2023
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:44,270
Oh,

2024
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,490
you remember if you did coke?

2025
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,780
There's no forgetting it.

2026
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,040
Even if he just did it once.

2027
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,220
And then I said elaborate
measures have to be enacted.

2028
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:51,471
You have to,

2029
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:52,280
first of all,

2030
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,790
my distinct recollection is you
have to go to one assholes house

2031
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,000
and then he tells you about the
quality of it and you're like quality.

2032
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:03,980
I've debased myself by being here.

2033
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:04,761
I would snort,

2034
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:07,100
drain off of fucking midget right now.

2035
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:07,890
I go,

2036
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:08,900
let's get this going.

2037
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:12,230
I got a knight to ruin than someone drags.

2038
01:00:12,231 --> 01:00:13,250
You face down a stair,

2039
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:15,980
you go to Denny's and spend the whole
time barfing in the bathroom cause she

2040
01:00:15,981 --> 01:00:16,814
can't eat.

2041
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:17,691
Someone drags.

2042
01:00:17,691 --> 01:00:22,160
You face down the stairs and you call
someone you booty call someone at four in

2043
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:25,220
the morning that you met
at a Yaz concert in 1994

2044
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,070
well that's a strong booty call.

2045
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:28,590
That's a,

2046
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:29,421
that's a hail Mary.

2047
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:29,721
I said,

2048
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:30,554
you know,

2049
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:34,190
that's just disingenuous to say
you don't remember doing cocaine.

2050
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:34,490
Well,

2051
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:38,810
it's disingenuous because
you would remember whether
or not you have done it and

2052
01:00:38,811 --> 01:00:39,111
you guys,

2053
01:00:39,111 --> 01:00:40,100
if you haven't done it,

2054
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:41,600
you'd remember all the time.

2055
01:00:41,601 --> 01:00:44,000
I've never done coke
because that comes up.

2056
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,150
If you have a conversation
with people once a year,

2057
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:47,811
someone will say,

2058
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:47,991
Hey,

2059
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:49,170
have you ever tried Qualia foods?

2060
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:49,730
Like,

2061
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:49,941
no,

2062
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:50,810
I never fucked with that.

2063
01:00:50,811 --> 01:00:51,680
I don't fuck with pills.

2064
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,010
Like what about yeah we do.

2065
01:00:53,011 --> 01:00:55,370
It's always have those sort of
conversation or women I'm sure have those

2066
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:58,090
conversations too and you would
know whether or not you took coke.

2067
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,950
There's a decision
involved in taking cars.

2068
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,880
This elaborate ritual
that goes on with it.

2069
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:04,430
There's all the chest rather than
talking about it and acting like it's

2070
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:05,600
important and it's a cause.

2071
01:01:05,601 --> 01:01:06,411
It's expensive.

2072
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:07,930
And there's this like saying,

2073
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,570
have you ever had a shot of
wild Turkey memorably go,

2074
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,690
I'm might've.

2075
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:15,260
Right.

2076
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:15,700
What's,

2077
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,533
what's the difference?

2078
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:16,970
Who Does?

2079
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:17,220
Why?

2080
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:17,770
What side?

2081
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,520
Jim Beam is that wild Turkey?

2082
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,361
Is that different Shit,

2083
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:23,390
you know you'd have those conversations
like that makes sense but not,

2084
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:24,950
I don't remember whether
or not I did coke.

2085
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:25,820
Get the fuck Outta here.

2086
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:26,360
Bitch.

2087
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,640
Do you remember whether you've
ever had a drink of alcohol?

2088
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,080
I don't remember what,

2089
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:30,620
yeah,

2090
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,453
fuck the flood.

2091
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,151
No,

2092
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:34,370
you either did or you don't.

2093
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:35,221
It can be.

2094
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:39,060
It can be fun that I think when you
base the night around it and everything

2095
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:41,970
becomes we have to do more and more more
and then at the end of the night when

2096
01:01:41,971 --> 01:01:44,670
there's no more and then it's a sad time.

2097
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,900
That's always the sad part.

2098
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:48,450
Just like it's not a
positive drug that way.

2099
01:01:48,451 --> 01:01:51,450
Whereas pot at a certain point you're
going to pull the rip cord because you're

2100
01:01:51,451 --> 01:01:52,980
just too high or you fall asleep or for

2101
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,770
your time or we all go to
Taco bell or whatever it is.

2102
01:01:55,771 --> 01:01:56,190
You know,

2103
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,960
it's a different kind of tired too.

2104
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:58,771
You know?

2105
01:01:58,771 --> 01:02:00,660
I've never done a coke,

2106
01:02:00,661 --> 01:02:01,860
but the stimulants,

2107
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:06,180
any kind of stimulant [inaudible]
the next day racked I did ecstasy,

2108
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,770
which is like very much like a
stimulant that especially I think,

2109
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:12,630
I think the shit I had was probably not
100% pure cause I've heard people say

2110
01:02:12,631 --> 01:02:13,464
that if you don't,

2111
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:14,760
if feel like if you,

2112
01:02:14,761 --> 01:02:16,440
if you don't try it like pure,

2113
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:18,530
you really don't know what
the actual effects is.

2114
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,373
Speeding.

2115
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:20,220
There wasn't.

2116
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:20,871
To me it ends that way.

2117
01:02:20,871 --> 01:02:21,960
I was definitely awake.

2118
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,390
I definitely stayed awake
for a long fucking time.

2119
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:24,780
Yeah.

2120
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,051
But,

2121
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:25,320
uh,

2122
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,880
I didn't think it was that speedy,

2123
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:30,060
but then someone told me that it's
like really frequently cut with it.

2124
01:02:30,061 --> 01:02:30,241
I'm like,

2125
01:02:30,241 --> 01:02:30,361
well,

2126
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:32,700
how do you know you're
getting it from a drug dealer?

2127
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,060
Right.

2128
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,890
And that's inherently like
a big part of the problem,

2129
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:35,190
right?

2130
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:37,500
You're getting it illegally so you,

2131
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:37,831
it's,

2132
01:02:37,831 --> 01:02:38,431
you're at risk.

2133
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:40,000
You don't really know what
the fuck you doing was.

2134
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,980
If you buy it from someone
in a bar or something,

2135
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,180
then you're completely taking
it on faith that they're,

2136
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:47,250
have the goodwill to not poison you.

2137
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,090
Yeah.

2138
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:48,923
Well that's what I was getting.

2139
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:49,100
Well,

2140
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,860
it's going to ask you about the difference
between stuff that's cut and stuff

2141
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:53,694
that's not cut.

2142
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,800
I don't think I've ever
had rock star staff,

2143
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:56,100
you know,

2144
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,520
and I hear stories about it.

2145
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:58,141
You know,

2146
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,990
I've had friends who've done coke with
famous people and junk and they go,

2147
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:01,201
oh,

2148
01:03:01,201 --> 01:03:02,940
it was so pure and so good.

2149
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,670
And then they delete and then evidently
then you don't sweat and act like an

2150
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:06,630
asshole other dental.

2151
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:08,950
He then you're the life of the
Goddamn party in your area.

2152
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:14,310
Lighting ladies cigarettes and quipping
off bone marrows and absolutely being

2153
01:03:14,311 --> 01:03:15,510
the event of the season.

2154
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,380
Uh,

2155
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:16,651
no,

2156
01:03:16,651 --> 01:03:19,530
I think whenever you're doing it it's
just cause you want to get jacked and

2157
01:03:19,531 --> 01:03:20,251
drank a bunch.

2158
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:21,350
And then we had asked,

2159
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:21,601
you know,

2160
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:23,310
hanging out with a girl and you're like,

2161
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:24,091
oh come here,

2162
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:24,990
I got cocaine.

2163
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,450
There's that.

2164
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:27,980
She will go,

2165
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,410
I think that's rape is
technically kind of rapey

2166
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,640
a little quick in there like
chocolate quick to make a chocolate,

2167
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:36,091
cocaine.

2168
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:37,080
They chicks love that.

2169
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:38,303
Wow.

2170
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:42,650
These are some tips I cocaine
tip or a chocolate shake mix.

2171
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:46,380
A little bit of quick in there and it
tastes like smells like chocolate when you

2172
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,430
snort it.

2173
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,971
Girls Love.

2174
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:49,150
Have you actually done this?

2175
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:55,540
You ever I take fruit loops
and coat them with ecstasy and,

2176
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:55,871
no,

2177
01:03:55,871 --> 01:03:59,070
that's to what I was going to ask is is
there a difference between like needing

2178
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:01,740
alcohol when you have
cut coke to not cook,

2179
01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:02,131
Cook cause you,

2180
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:03,760
do you remember Tom Sawyer from uh,

2181
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,270
[inaudible] as well as I remember anyone.

2182
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,030
I'm sending him a copy
of the book tomorrow.

2183
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,780
Fuck for the elaborate inscription.

2184
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:13,950
Tell him I said he always just
talk about rock star coke.

2185
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:15,830
Like it was the god damn like it was.

2186
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:16,580
That's what he'd say.

2187
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:16,830
Yeah.

2188
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:18,060
That's where I got the expression.

2189
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:18,450
Yeah,

2190
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,920
we would talk about doing it
with like Kinison or rock.

2191
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:24,680
He did it with like a bunch of like
maybe it was Robin might've been robbing.

2192
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:25,020
Yeah,

2193
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,010
whoever the fuck he did it with.

2194
01:04:26,011 --> 01:04:27,330
But he would talk about how it was like,

2195
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:32,670
it was like the best Asian massage
ever with a builtin happy ending.

2196
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:33,351
No,

2197
01:04:33,351 --> 01:04:36,180
no questions asked and you just
sleep like a baby afterwards.

2198
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:39,540
He made it sound like this wonderful
experience that you needed to try.

2199
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:42,030
And then afterwards the big things
like you could just go to bed.

2200
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:42,481
No problem.

2201
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:43,020
You can write.

2202
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:43,590
I'm like,

2203
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:45,090
how the fuck is that possible?

2204
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,420
I guess cause I don't know
because is it a completely,

2205
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,950
I don't know like what the properties are,

2206
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:50,850
but I'm assuming it's,

2207
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:52,050
since it's a numbing agent,

2208
01:04:52,051 --> 01:04:54,840
it's an analgesic or like
an anesthetic almost.

2209
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:59,550
So really what it's getting stepped on
with his crappy speed and other shit that

2210
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,590
the additives is what
Jack Shoe I'm guessing.

2211
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,191
Yeah,

2212
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:04,260
but that never had like
if you went to a pharmacy,

2213
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,530
what a pharmacist would have would be
pharmaceutical cocaine and that would be

2214
01:05:07,531 --> 01:05:08,550
very pure.

2215
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,380
And then that's an experiment.

2216
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:12,360
Let's let's get a pharmacist on the show.

2217
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:13,194
Joe,

2218
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,010
did you know that Coca Cola
still uses coca leaves?

2219
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:17,710
Yeah.

2220
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:17,921
No.

2221
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:18,580
Amazing.

2222
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,780
It's part of their flavor.

2223
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:20,980
I don't think Pepsi does,

2224
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:26,200
but Coca Cola uses actual coca leaves
like and they extract medical grade

2225
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:28,690
cocaine from it and then they you,

2226
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:32,650
they like the same company that
that does this for Coca Cola.

2227
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,730
They also sell medical grade
cocaine to like hospitals and shit.

2228
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:37,900
Cause a numbing agent.

2229
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,180
I don't know what they use it for,

2230
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:39,650
man.

2231
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:40,240
I don't,

2232
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:40,871
I don't understand.

2233
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:41,920
But apparently they make you,

2234
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,210
it doesn't have anything to do that.

2235
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,093
Psychoanalysis,

2236
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:47,961
what is it?

2237
01:05:47,961 --> 01:05:48,731
Stuff that they,

2238
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:50,600
a lidocaine like line of can.

2239
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:52,620
It's like cocaine's.

2240
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,280
It's not an autistic brother.

2241
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,780
I don't think I've ever had.

2242
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,730
Maybe if I'd done the rock star Cook,

2243
01:05:57,731 --> 01:05:59,050
I'd be advocating it more.

2244
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,210
To me it always just seemed
like the people who did it.

2245
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,590
Whenever the people that I wanted
to roll with the yellow line,

2246
01:06:04,591 --> 01:06:09,010
the inside of the nose and medic ropes
membranes before certain medical.

2247
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:09,831
Well Huh.

2248
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:11,800
I wonder why this is
bleeding and swelling.

2249
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,634
Yeah,

2250
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,840
so it's actual cocaine,

2251
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:14,740
not lidocaine.

2252
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:15,140
No,

2253
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:15,973
she's interesting.

2254
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,080
Cocaine hydrochloride.

2255
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:17,910
Well,

2256
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:21,190
I don't know if you remember how that one
person I hung out with that used to do

2257
01:06:21,191 --> 01:06:24,340
liquid cocaine and it was just
like a little spray model,

2258
01:06:24,341 --> 01:06:25,390
like a Flonase bottle.

2259
01:06:25,391 --> 01:06:26,224
He's just like,

2260
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:26,980
and you just,

2261
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:27,810
that's how you did it.

2262
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:31,030
He's just trying to get it into your
memory and as quickly as possible and by

2263
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,590
putting it in in Lakewood,

2264
01:06:32,591 --> 01:06:33,550
you're absolutely,

2265
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,730
what kind of liquid would you put it into
that you could just spray in your nose

2266
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:37,420
like that?

2267
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,320
That's how it came.

2268
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:40,970
It came like I can't let
that atomizer spray down.

2269
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:41,800
Wow.

2270
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,110
That's why one of the a shelf.

2271
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:44,080
It might be worth trying.

2272
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:44,601
I don't know.

2273
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:45,310
I,

2274
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:46,143
like I said,

2275
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:47,530
the older I get to you,

2276
01:06:47,531 --> 01:06:49,420
I don't want my heart
to explode or anything.

2277
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,253
You know,

2278
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,940
real issue that they say is a,

2279
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:57,220
with the way they process
cocaine from the coca leaves.

2280
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:02,430
But the coca leaves themselves are
not only not dangerous for you,

2281
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,170
but really common and kind of healthy.

2282
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:05,891
I mean,

2283
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:10,891
they have like Fido nutrients and there's
some properties it for thousands of

2284
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:11,823
years in South America.

2285
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,710
It rots the holy fuck out of your teeth,

2286
01:07:14,711 --> 01:07:15,544
son.

2287
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:17,200
It rots the holy fuck out of your teeth.

2288
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:19,390
You see those dudes that chew
those coca leaves all the time.

2289
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:23,080
It might be that they like doing coca
leaves so much they don't ever bother

2290
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:23,500
brushing.

2291
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:23,651
Yeah.

2292
01:07:23,651 --> 01:07:27,790
They probably don't have really good
dental care for chewing on how they built

2293
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:31,750
the Inca empire because it's a mild
stimulant and just stick it in your cheek

2294
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:32,584
like chill.

2295
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:32,890
Yeah,

2296
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:33,940
I need just keep it in there.

2297
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:35,300
And it allows you,

2298
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,080
because it restricts the blood
vessels to work at higher altitudes,

2299
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:38,770
more,

2300
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:39,041
you know,

2301
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:39,874
there's all these,

2302
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:43,330
they were able to build massive cities and

2303
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:49,890
the higher altitude tincture at precarious
fucking lofty heights all through the

2304
01:07:51,131 --> 01:07:53,050
empire for thousands of miles.

2305
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,060
And it certain that they're all,

2306
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:55,983
all the workers.

2307
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,380
Well that's one of the daily,

2308
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:57,880
yeah,

2309
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:58,713
without a doubt.

2310
01:07:58,780 --> 01:07:59,291
I mean there,

2311
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:00,760
that's a really common thing today.

2312
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,410
And the people who pick it,

2313
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:04,030
they don't snort it.

2314
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:04,460
They chew,

2315
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:04,960
right?

2316
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,291
Yeah.

2317
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:06,124
They're all chew it.

2318
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:07,990
It's like really common.

2319
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:11,380
Like they have these bags of it and they
hand it to each other and they take it

2320
01:08:11,381 --> 01:08:12,970
and they grab it and they
stuffed it in their mouth.

2321
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:13,481
Like,

2322
01:08:13,481 --> 01:08:15,680
look how much this guy's
got stuffed in his face.

2323
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:16,970
Like a giant squirrel person,

2324
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:18,530
you know,

2325
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:19,370
that's what they do.

2326
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:20,721
I mean,

2327
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,780
if you were climbing and
the Andes and you wanted to,

2328
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:24,621
I think,

2329
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:27,860
feel better and not have
a altitude sickness,

2330
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,630
the cocaine alleviates,

2331
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:30,780
yeah.

2332
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:32,180
For us who are not,

2333
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,290
we're land inbound,

2334
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:35,300
but it's not going to live
at 8,000 feet or whatever.

2335
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,580
It's not cocaine,

2336
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:38,480
cocaine leaves.

2337
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:38,720
Yeah,

2338
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,430
it's Coco,

2339
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:39,940
Coco,

2340
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,550
Coco,

2341
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,970
Coco,

2342
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:45,970
cocaine is the extract is the more
unnatural and it is fucked the same way

2343
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:47,990
sugars fucked.

2344
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,320
Like when you take sugar like regular
sugar and you pour it on your frosted

2345
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:51,950
flakes,

2346
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:53,510
you're just poisoning yourself.

2347
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,070
You're just giving yourself sugar.

2348
01:08:55,071 --> 01:08:55,881
It tastes awesome.

2349
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:57,150
Don't get me wrong when I hate it,

2350
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,970
but you're giving yourself,

2351
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:01,160
it's like a toxin at that level.

2352
01:09:01,161 --> 01:09:01,791
It's toxic,

2353
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:02,480
it's bad,

2354
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,860
it's actually bad for your body.

2355
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,290
It can diminish your body's performance.

2356
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:09,350
Your by your insulin levels
get off fucking out of whack.

2357
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,101
Your body is like,

2358
01:09:10,101 --> 01:09:11,480
what is this?

2359
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,970
Because you're not supposed
to have sugar in that form.

2360
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:18,680
It's supposed to come attached to fiber
and watermelon and apples and all these

2361
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:20,960
different fruits that we'd
normally get sugar from.

2362
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:21,794
It's supposed to be,

2363
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:22,610
there's like,

2364
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:25,280
you know a relationship that these,

2365
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,001
these,

2366
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:29,780
these nutrients and the various aspects
of food I'll have to the actual piece of

2367
01:09:29,781 --> 01:09:33,080
food that they come from
when you just extract one,

2368
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:33,980
you know,

2369
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:37,760
good part of it like sugar or cocaine.

2370
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:42,210
Like you're taking it out of the
whole symbiotic plant systems.

2371
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:45,570
Cause isn't that like the story that know?

2372
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:46,460
I just read this book,

2373
01:09:46,461 --> 01:09:46,941
I can't remember it.

2374
01:09:46,941 --> 01:09:49,910
It's called the six six drinks in the
history of the world and six drinks.

2375
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,260
And they talked a lot
about coca cola in it.

2376
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:53,443
Look at that shit.

2377
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:55,290
Sugar's addictive is I bet it is.

2378
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,010
And,

2379
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:57,610
and the brain scans sugars.

2380
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:02,090
It's the refining of everything and the
extracting of anything that's changed

2381
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:02,541
the world,

2382
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:02,781
right?

2383
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:07,781
Like sugar is a giant moment in human
history when sugar becomes important

2384
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:12,800
because then rum becomes important than
slavery and taking over the new world

2385
01:10:12,801 --> 01:10:13,551
and the,

2386
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:13,761
you know,

2387
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:18,140
the whole history of the new world
is built on cocaine and sugar.

2388
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:19,130
Yeah,

2389
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:19,731
for sure.

2390
01:10:19,731 --> 01:10:20,990
I mean there's,

2391
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:25,520
there's definitely good and bad with
all sorts of things that have ruined all

2392
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:27,020
sorts of aspects of our world.

2393
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:27,351
I mean,

2394
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:29,440
for a long time people go to war for salt.

2395
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,170
Absolutely.

2396
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:30,540
Saul,

2397
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:34,460
stop and think about precedes sugar as
the big item that everybody has to have.

2398
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:39,070
So first march was it to the salt marshes
because that's what he's purchasing

2399
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,610
the British fuck.

2400
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:44,840
It's salt's a key
ingredient in human history.

2401
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:45,190
And,

2402
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:47,690
and people still say it
and now I'm getting boring,

2403
01:10:47,691 --> 01:10:49,220
but I was just gonna say
when they used to pay,

2404
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:50,520
they paid people in Salt,

2405
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,460
you're in salt and you're worth your salt.

2406
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:53,840
The reason what do you
know why they do it?

2407
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:54,081
You know,

2408
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:55,520
what's all the properties of salt?

2409
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:58,970
It absolutely replenishes
your body when you're,

2410
01:10:59,180 --> 01:10:59,780
you know,

2411
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,381
working out.

2412
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,570
And I guess the sodium is some sort of no,

2413
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:02,871
go on.

2414
01:11:02,871 --> 01:11:05,030
Tell us it sounds or I'm
stumbling around now.

2415
01:11:05,031 --> 01:11:05,870
Those are all good.

2416
01:11:05,871 --> 01:11:08,390
But the big one is a preservation of food.

2417
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:11,750
If you could take me and
my cover and salt and fish,

2418
01:11:11,751 --> 01:11:12,584
especially,

2419
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:13,830
you cover it in salt,

2420
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,720
it'll prevent bacteria from growing,

2421
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:16,980
right?

2422
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:17,221
Yeah.

2423
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:22,221
So they would literally layer
these fish filets in stacks of,

2424
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,190
of salt.

2425
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,570
Like they would put salt,

2426
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:25,590
put the fish down,

2427
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,800
cover the fish with salt,

2428
01:11:26,801 --> 01:11:27,541
put a filet down,

2429
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:29,700
cover that with salt
and they would be fine.

2430
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:30,840
Like for days,

2431
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:32,011
months,

2432
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:32,560
you could ship.

2433
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,500
That's how that's all.

2434
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:34,950
All food was kept in those days.

2435
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:36,420
It really lasts for months.

2436
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:36,750
Well,

2437
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,130
that horrible stuff all day.

2438
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:38,460
Uh,

2439
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,370
you know that they saw him,

2440
01:11:39,371 --> 01:11:39,751
cod,

2441
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:40,051
salt,

2442
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:40,910
cod and salt pork,

2443
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,220
right.

2444
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:44,610
You'd be salt the dickens out of the
pork and then just keep it forever,

2445
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,080
isn't it under refrigeration?

2446
01:11:46,081 --> 01:11:46,300
Right.

2447
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:51,300
So salt provided refrigeration for 10,000
zillion years and it was how you kept

2448
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:51,780
food.

2449
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,051
Yeah.

2450
01:11:52,051 --> 01:11:54,330
I mean it was like people
can't to this day go,

2451
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:56,400
what do you just pour your
salt on your French fries?

2452
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:57,720
People go to war for that shit.

2453
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:58,471
It's a condiment.

2454
01:11:58,471 --> 01:11:59,550
You don't go to war for condiments,

2455
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,870
but that's not what it was.

2456
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,510
It was like going to Wal for refrigerator.

2457
01:12:02,511 --> 01:12:04,110
Harry met Sally in ancient Rome.

2458
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:06,240
The big sauce was this fish sauce.

2459
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:08,040
It tastes a lot like
Vietnamese fish tacos.

2460
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,480
Very salty and Brown.

2461
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,650
And it was like rendered fish that they
let it sit and then they through salt in

2462
01:12:13,651 --> 01:12:14,040
it,

2463
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:14,873
but it kept,

2464
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:15,661
wow.

2465
01:12:15,661 --> 01:12:16,160
He kept,

2466
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:16,650
he could,

2467
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:18,570
he could have it on your
shelf for a couple of weeks,

2468
01:12:18,571 --> 01:12:19,770
which in the ancient world,

2469
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,240
you're buying food every day.

2470
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:22,980
You're taking your bread to the baker,

2471
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:24,270
the bigger breaks that you bring it back.

2472
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:24,451
You know,

2473
01:12:24,451 --> 01:12:25,920
all of that has to be done on the day,

2474
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:26,131
right.

2475
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:27,150
You have to check in or whatever.

2476
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:30,960
You're not going to the supermarket and
putting shit in the fridge for a billion

2477
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,110
years.

2478
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:32,070
So yeah,

2479
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:33,330
you don't have a deep freezer.

2480
01:12:33,331 --> 01:12:34,780
We knew keep pot pies,

2481
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,690
salt in cities,

2482
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:36,571
like you said,

2483
01:12:36,571 --> 01:12:36,880
the,

2484
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:41,040
the world flood over solve for ages
and amazing to think about today,

2485
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,620
people were forced to work in
salt mines and died in them.

2486
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,810
That was like a huge punishment for ages.

2487
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,120
There's a mountain in Germany,

2488
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:49,440
there's a mountain of salt.

2489
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:50,851
Wow.

2490
01:12:50,851 --> 01:12:54,420
It's been redeeming Audi yet there's
a book called salt and it's very good.

2491
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:56,340
Will you look up the book called Salt,

2492
01:12:56,341 --> 01:13:00,030
the guy who wrote it and they reduced
it just because of the world's need for

2493
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:00,331
salt.

2494
01:13:00,331 --> 01:13:00,500
Yeah.

2495
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:00,841
They just,

2496
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:01,001
you know,

2497
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,100
they dug it all down.

2498
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,110
Like there was a,

2499
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:05,940
there's two mountains and one in South
America I can't remember in the other.

2500
01:13:05,941 --> 01:13:08,760
And Mexico's it in Potosi and uh,

2501
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,061
yeah,

2502
01:13:09,061 --> 01:13:09,511
there it is.

2503
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:10,790
Salt a world history.

2504
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:14,220
You really like it now because he it
down and he shows you the salt mines and

2505
01:13:14,221 --> 01:13:15,900
there's pictures of the Salt Mountain and,

2506
01:13:15,901 --> 01:13:16,500
uh,

2507
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,690
and it has UN fucking believable.

2508
01:13:18,691 --> 01:13:19,051
I mean,

2509
01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:20,700
we were talking earlier today,

2510
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:24,900
we were talking earlier today about not
having a smartphone would a big leap

2511
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,520
that would be to go back to a flip phone,

2512
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,820
but look at the fuck
people fought over salt.

2513
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:33,000
That is so alien and spices,

2514
01:13:33,001 --> 01:13:33,270
right?

2515
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:35,040
The reason why Columbus was coming there,

2516
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:40,041
it is that the reason why a Columbus
was a mountain of salt w w came and I

2517
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,110
didn't always talking about
Columbus even bloody show that it,

2518
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:43,321
even Magellan.

2519
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:44,400
And when he went around the world,

2520
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:44,730
uh,

2521
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:45,840
he sent five ships.

2522
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:46,501
Uh,

2523
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:47,460
they lost all of them.

2524
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:49,230
They finally came back
with one three years later,

2525
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:49,410
right?

2526
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:50,310
Three years later.

2527
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,100
But crappy shit with
18 guys sailed back in.

2528
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:53,581
Well,

2529
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:54,960
it all been underwritten by,

2530
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,103
uh,

2531
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:57,600
businessmen from Germany,

2532
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:57,961
right?

2533
01:13:57,961 --> 01:14:00,030
Who underwrote Magellan's voyage.

2534
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,390
There was enough spice in that
ship to pay for the whole trip.

2535
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:07,560
A three year trip and losing 300
guys and five ships or whatever,

2536
01:14:07,561 --> 01:14:08,250
four ships.

2537
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,920
Whoa there was it because
they brought back what,

2538
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:11,351
like why,

2539
01:14:11,351 --> 01:14:13,870
don't know what they wanted on
that one nutmeg or whatever it was.

2540
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:19,040
And they had to go all the way around
the world to on would east indies,

2541
01:14:19,790 --> 01:14:21,010
no electricity.

2542
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,980
But she see that was the difference was
Magellan was going to prove you could go

2543
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:24,814
that way.

2544
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:30,640
Cause usually they went around India and
the horn and so that's how valuable it

2545
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:31,241
was.

2546
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:33,300
And that's why uh,

2547
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:34,270
England,

2548
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,810
Portugal and Spain were such giant powers,

2549
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:38,950
the big spice.

2550
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,530
And then when Spain
took over the new world,

2551
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:43,000
there was a mountains of gold,

2552
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:43,970
one in South American,

2553
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:45,070
one a mountain of silver,

2554
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:49,510
I mean a mountain of silver that they
made the Indians and killed them all.

2555
01:14:49,511 --> 01:14:50,260
Doing it.

2556
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:55,180
Dig Out and all the gold and silver in
Asia is still in circulation is like

2557
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:58,150
Spanish gold dug out of the new world.

2558
01:14:58,210 --> 01:14:59,200
That's insane.

2559
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:00,440
There was a literal Mt.

2560
01:15:00,441 --> 01:15:01,150
Two of them.

2561
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:04,100
One in South America
and one in Mexico types.

2562
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:05,620
So credible a mountain.

2563
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,431
Fuck.

2564
01:15:06,431 --> 01:15:07,870
It's not that long ago either.

2565
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:08,141
You know,

2566
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:10,570
1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue.

2567
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:12,310
That's not that long.

2568
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:13,240
500 years ago.

2569
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,560
That's crazy.

2570
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:15,394
Yeah.

2571
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,520
That's why Spain is a had money
and why giant and then comes the,

2572
01:15:21,071 --> 01:15:21,570
the uh,

2573
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:22,241
what you might call it,

2574
01:15:22,241 --> 01:15:27,241
the reformation and after the inquisition
and now Europe becomes Europe and they

2575
01:15:27,491 --> 01:15:32,491
all start fighting each other and it's
really truly amazing what a small amount

2576
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:38,050
of time that is in terms of like in
perspective with the human history,

2577
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:38,861
human history,

2578
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:40,140
just even perspective with it.

2579
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:42,220
Everybody wants to go to the
beginning of the universe.

2580
01:15:42,221 --> 01:15:43,670
13.7 billion.

2581
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,710
God,

2582
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:45,850
we don't even have to go that far.

2583
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,110
Let's go to biological life.

2584
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:47,471
Yeah.

2585
01:15:47,471 --> 01:15:49,720
And then human beings have been
around just a small amount of time.

2586
01:15:49,721 --> 01:15:51,130
And in that small amount of time,

2587
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:56,131
the amount of change that we've seen
just in 200 years is so mind blowing.

2588
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,070
And we're talking about like going back
to flip phones being like some big,

2589
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:01,923
big fuck up.

2590
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:03,460
I can't believe I couldn't do it.

2591
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:03,941
Okay,

2592
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:04,270
good.

2593
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,620
I'm gonna just rub two sticks,

2594
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:06,120
dude.

2595
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,920
I need periscope periscoping all the time.

2596
01:16:08,921 --> 01:16:10,450
It's huge for my career.

2597
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,700
You could go back to salt,

2598
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:13,860
keeping your,

2599
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,460
your food alive with Senate.

2600
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,570
I'm going to start lining everything.

2601
01:16:17,571 --> 01:16:19,200
Like there's going to be an
asshole out there to tell that.

2602
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,130
I bet there's assholes out
there doing it right now.

2603
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:21,521
Oh yeah.

2604
01:16:21,521 --> 01:16:25,360
There are guys who make their
own axes and shit at Chisel.

2605
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:26,194
Everything.

2606
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,320
The good thing about now is
now you get to see people.

2607
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:31,450
What are the things you thought we lost?

2608
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:32,284
Like you know,

2609
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:36,160
blacksmiths and saddle makers
are back and making stuff.

2610
01:16:36,161 --> 01:16:36,431
You know,

2611
01:16:36,431 --> 01:16:38,440
like everybody's relearning
all these old crafts,

2612
01:16:38,441 --> 01:16:40,720
how to be a no one knows how to like,

2613
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:41,853
uh,

2614
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:42,753
you know,

2615
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,040
boil metal or whatever and be,

2616
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:45,311
you know,

2617
01:16:45,311 --> 01:16:48,940
make all those ancient things
that were so necessary.

2618
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,960
If you didn't have blacksmiths
250 years ago in this country,

2619
01:16:52,961 --> 01:16:53,794
even a hundred years ago,

2620
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,090
a wagon,

2621
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:55,600
wheels,

2622
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,230
everything.

2623
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:56,920
Horses,

2624
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:57,753
you know,

2625
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:58,691
your guns,

2626
01:16:58,691 --> 01:16:59,231
the tongs,

2627
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:00,280
the tools you worked with,

2628
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:03,750
you had to take it into him and he'd
fix it and he'd give it back to this

2629
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:04,970
something really quick.

2630
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,670
Carrying swords and spears.

2631
01:17:06,671 --> 01:17:07,630
I mean,

2632
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:08,770
on paper.

2633
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:09,710
Something really cool about that,

2634
01:17:09,711 --> 01:17:10,070
right?

2635
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,200
Someone in your group
had to be a metal worker,

2636
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:12,930
you know what I mean?

2637
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,920
Someone in your unit worked metal and
you'd heat up a thing at night and bang,

2638
01:17:15,921 --> 01:17:16,101
Bang,

2639
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:16,281
Bang,

2640
01:17:16,281 --> 01:17:17,300
fix everybody's guns.

2641
01:17:17,301 --> 01:17:20,030
And there's a guy who made your furniture.

2642
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:24,740
It was a guy with a to the wood and
sawed it down and make your table.

2643
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:25,460
Yup.

2644
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:26,201
By Ham Day.

2645
01:17:26,201 --> 01:17:26,810
Yeah.

2646
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:27,350
Wow.

2647
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:30,440
And everybody's table was a slightly
different because they really were just

2648
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,150
marking it with pencils,

2649
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:34,880
song into the wood and
you could see sometimes.

2650
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,290
Then you got to places
like when they have,

2651
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:36,870
you know,

2652
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:38,240
our artisans making,

2653
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:39,480
I don't know,

2654
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:39,730
I,

2655
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:42,320
I'm not going to go to a revolutionary
ward village to watch them churn,

2656
01:17:42,321 --> 01:17:43,011
butter or nothing,

2657
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:44,030
but I don't like,

2658
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,990
like super stupid old school
and making shit with your hands.

2659
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:48,741
But I'm,

2660
01:17:48,741 --> 01:17:51,980
I love when I love watching people
make sure that I don't even give a fuck

2661
01:17:51,981 --> 01:17:52,190
about,

2662
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:52,340
yeah.

2663
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,121
Like violins.

2664
01:17:53,121 --> 01:17:53,954
I don't play the violin,

2665
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:58,700
but I watched some show about them making
violins and the wood did they choose

2666
01:17:58,701 --> 01:18:00,440
and the harmonics of the wood and the,

2667
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:05,480
I mean when you look at a
really truly expensive violin,

2668
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:08,290
I mean that is a goddamn
functional workable.

2669
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:09,423
Absolutely.

2670
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:10,010
I don't even,

2671
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:10,430
I don't even,

2672
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:11,570
I don't play any instruments.

2673
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,140
No.

2674
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,460
And I think the musicians you buy,

2675
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:17,540
those hot high end ones
are reverent about there.

2676
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,540
They definitely whacks
him down and you know,

2677
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,090
keep them in shape and
the moisture's in issue,

2678
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:23,924
you can,

2679
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,470
you know,

2680
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:27,020
store it in a crappy place and
it can't get bounced around.

2681
01:18:27,021 --> 01:18:28,160
And while I was at um,

2682
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:30,140
Conan with Sturgill Simpson,

2683
01:18:30,141 --> 01:18:31,490
Sturgill Simpson is a friend of mine,

2684
01:18:31,491 --> 01:18:36,491
he's a country music guy
and he was performing on the
show and they asked him if

2685
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:42,041
he wanted to put his guitar out there
early so that it can acclimate to the,

2686
01:18:42,901 --> 01:18:43,241
the,

2687
01:18:43,241 --> 01:18:47,210
the temperature in that room because
they keep the room where they fill in

2688
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,380
Coleman any five degrees,

2689
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,190
she would chilly.

2690
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:50,060
So that everybody's like,

2691
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:50,630
whoa.

2692
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:52,880
It gives you like a little bit
more energy as an audience.

2693
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:56,180
Like if the worst thing you want is
people like really warm and really tired.

2694
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:56,750
Yeah.

2695
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:59,090
So you give him like a little bit of
a chill and that's like such an old,

2696
01:18:59,120 --> 01:18:59,631
old school,

2697
01:18:59,631 --> 01:19:00,530
David Letterman Trek,

2698
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,220
right?

2699
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:05,210
So they put his guitar out there early
so we can get you and then they have to

2700
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:06,080
tune it again.

2701
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:07,400
So you have to go out there,

2702
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:08,480
you have to play with it,

2703
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:12,370
you have to know where it should
be for every single note and you,

2704
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:13,970
you're twisting those
little things on top.

2705
01:19:13,971 --> 01:19:14,660
And I'm like,

2706
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:19,660
the wood itself moves and changes in
10 20 minutes and humidity of the room.

2707
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:21,800
That's fucking bananas,

2708
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:22,070
man.

2709
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:27,070
That is so crazy to think that it's
so specialized and they can't make,

2710
01:19:27,531 --> 01:19:31,100
he was telling me that you can't make a
really good guitar out of anything other

2711
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:31,890
than wood.

2712
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:32,930
Just doesn't sound right.

2713
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:35,090
They can make some electric ones.

2714
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:36,940
I like plexiglass and a shit and they,

2715
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,420
but it's a different sort of a thing.

2716
01:19:38,421 --> 01:19:39,111
But even then,

2717
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:39,944
not as good,

2718
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,470
like you want blood,

2719
01:19:41,471 --> 01:19:41,661
right?

2720
01:19:41,661 --> 01:19:42,380
And they're steel.

2721
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,820
There's the ones that are all metal,

2722
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:44,803
you know?

2723
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:45,690
But yeah.

2724
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:46,970
Now what is the one,

2725
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:47,571
I don't know.

2726
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:47,960
I met,

2727
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:50,180
I met a good guy who made
guitars for people and he,

2728
01:19:50,181 --> 01:19:50,840
you know,

2729
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:54,570
he looked exactly like you think he
would with ponytail and a beard and you

2730
01:19:54,571 --> 01:19:54,650
know,

2731
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,640
like he's in the hall that,

2732
01:19:55,641 --> 01:20:00,290
and that's how they did it was
I was with John Paul Jones,

2733
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,333
uh,

2734
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,900
from led Zeppelin or whatever he would,

2735
01:20:02,901 --> 01:20:03,290
he,

2736
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:07,000
he was in them crooked vultures with
Dave Grohl and I got to meet him in,

2737
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:08,370
he introduces

2738
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,540
me to this fellow and he's like,

2739
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,141
well,

2740
01:20:10,141 --> 01:20:10,591
who's this guy?

2741
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:11,424
And he's like,

2742
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:14,610
he makes Madeline's Whoa.

2743
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:15,510
And I'm like,

2744
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:15,721
oh.

2745
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:16,381
And he's now,

2746
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:16,891
he's my friend.

2747
01:20:16,891 --> 01:20:17,750
I brought him along with me.

2748
01:20:17,751 --> 01:20:19,980
He makes guitars and mandolins
and that's what I plan.

2749
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,000
Wow.

2750
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:21,540
Yeah.

2751
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,373
That's all he did.

2752
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:25,170
And then people have like this really
intense relationship with the guy who

2753
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:26,004
makes their guitar.

2754
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:26,400
Yeah.

2755
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:26,640
I know.

2756
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,940
Due to Gush Acoustic guitars
from like famous makers,

2757
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:31,680
they become friends
with that famous maker.

2758
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,630
You know,

2759
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:32,950
this is a,

2760
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:35,520
this is how pool cue thing to pull cues,

2761
01:20:35,521 --> 01:20:36,061
which are also,

2762
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:38,280
they can't figure out a way to make
them really good at anything other than

2763
01:20:38,281 --> 01:20:38,640
wood.

2764
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,180
Yeah.

2765
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,060
It's interesting that,

2766
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,270
and they have relationships
with the makers.

2767
01:20:42,271 --> 01:20:43,560
Like guys who play with certain guys.

2768
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:43,951
Karen's,

2769
01:20:43,951 --> 01:20:44,161
you're like,

2770
01:20:44,161 --> 01:20:44,371
well look,

2771
01:20:44,371 --> 01:20:46,200
it was really close
friendship with this guy.

2772
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,280
I'll make sure cue.

2773
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:48,120
But uh,

2774
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:48,953
the um,

2775
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:52,080
it's interesting to me
that like they haven't,

2776
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:55,740
no one's been able to figure out in all
the years that we've been manufacturing

2777
01:20:55,741 --> 01:20:56,310
things,

2778
01:20:56,310 --> 01:21:00,450
something that's better than something
that just grows in the ground.

2779
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:03,690
That's a trip that for guitars,

2780
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:04,770
for pool cues,

2781
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,211
for this table,

2782
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:06,900
man,

2783
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,610
this table feels good.

2784
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:12,120
Like when I put my hand on this tape and
I feel the grain of it and I move like

2785
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:13,470
this is like,

2786
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,780
I think this table makes
a better conversation.

2787
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,673
I really do.

2788
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:17,310
I think if this,

2789
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:21,420
if there was this plastic thing here
with I go like one of the formica top,

2790
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:23,970
I think we'd feel less comfortable.

2791
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:24,390
Now you're,

2792
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:25,350
then you're in a break room.

2793
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:25,890
Yeah.

2794
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:27,240
Then you're not meant to stay.

2795
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:27,930
Yeah.

2796
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:29,380
You're meant to blow after 15 we,

2797
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:30,390
even these bricks,

2798
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:31,860
these bricks are bullshit.

2799
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:32,190
Yeah.

2800
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:33,510
But they're not bullshit.

2801
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:34,800
They're actual bricks.

2802
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,330
There's a slice,

2803
01:21:36,331 --> 01:21:38,070
they take a brick and they'd veneer.

2804
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:38,460
Really?

2805
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:38,761
Yeah.

2806
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:39,331
And then they put it,

2807
01:21:39,331 --> 01:21:40,110
they put a wooden,

2808
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:44,430
a metal sheet up and then they put the
SPAC all in or whatever the fuck it is.

2809
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,930
And then they put the bricks in.

2810
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,090
If they lay them one at a time.

2811
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:49,163
Individually.

2812
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:49,531
Yeah.

2813
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:50,640
Like it's not like a,

2814
01:21:50,641 --> 01:21:52,200
like a wallpaper.

2815
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:53,071
It's an actual,

2816
01:21:53,071 --> 01:21:53,940
their actual bricks.

2817
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,410
But to me was like,

2818
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,000
I know that's real.

2819
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:59,310
So if I go back there and
touch that feels like,

2820
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:03,600
that feels like a real organic
thing and bricks or you know what?

2821
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:06,390
Mud and composite and all sorts
of shit thrown into a mold.

2822
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:08,250
You still have to mold
and they're all irregular.

2823
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,500
I would have a wooden floor if,

2824
01:22:10,501 --> 01:22:11,010
uh,

2825
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,750
if I own this place I would change it.

2826
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:14,760
I would turn the flu
maybe too nosy for studio.

2827
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,930
Gives a fuck all low,

2828
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:17,640
low.

2829
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,360
Let it echo.

2830
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:18,960
I would,

2831
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:19,860
I would feel better.

2832
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:22,790
I feel better with like shit that's like,

2833
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:24,780
like organic stuff.

2834
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:25,440
I agree.

2835
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,450
Like if you could be in a grow room,

2836
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,190
that would be the ultimate conversation.

2837
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:31,980
If you could just do a podcast,

2838
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:36,030
a video podcast from a grow room without
going to jail or without getting your

2839
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:38,190
place stormed by people that you know.

2840
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:38,401
No,

2841
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:39,930
there's $1 million worth of plants there.

2842
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:42,600
You're already getting me put in
jail and how your questions today.

2843
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:43,493
Not True.

2844
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,510
We live in a new day.

2845
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:49,260
Like if you could go to one of those
Warren Buffet owned grow rooms in Colorado

2846
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:51,210
with I five indoor acres.

2847
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:55,800
They have like five indoor acre ones at
this dude I know works out and they have

2848
01:22:55,801 --> 01:22:56,491
two levels.

2849
01:22:56,491 --> 01:23:01,491
There's an upper and a lower Carlo bottles
taken shit to the next level son and

2850
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:03,660
it just got back from Denver.

2851
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,130
That is the beginning.

2852
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:07,510
There's the beginning
for the whole country.

2853
01:23:07,511 --> 01:23:09,250
The whole country is going to become that.

2854
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:12,400
The whole country is going to become just
like Colorado because they're going to

2855
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:15,370
get addicted to the revenue and then
they're going to get addicted to the

2856
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:16,204
behavior.

2857
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,590
The revenue is one thing,

2858
01:23:17,591 --> 01:23:19,030
but you go to Colorado right now,

2859
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:21,520
you have a less drunk driving accidents.

2860
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,460
You have less violent crime.

2861
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:29,480
You have the lowest incident of Duis
and something like 25 years there.

2862
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:33,300
There's all sorts of like positive
benefits to what the fuck's going on here.

2863
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,080
You're almost answering the next question,

2864
01:23:35,081 --> 01:23:36,400
which is why isn't it
happening everywhere?

2865
01:23:36,401 --> 01:23:36,671
It's like,

2866
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:37,270
well,

2867
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:38,980
if they're going to sell less alcohol,

2868
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:42,250
then there's definitely forces that
don't want to sell and only that.

2869
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:42,400
Yeah,

2870
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,260
you've got to worry about
the criminals like the,

2871
01:23:44,261 --> 01:23:48,000
I know someone who has a set up
where he has blackwater type duties.

2872
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:51,190
There's these dudes have bulletproof vests
and they walk around with the machine

2873
01:23:51,191 --> 01:23:55,070
guns and they're outside of this grow
room because they're dealing with millions

2874
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:58,900
of dollars and million and the banking
laws because the banking laws are still

2875
01:23:58,901 --> 01:23:59,734
archaic.

2876
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:02,140
They are dealing in a
cash basis in Colorado.

2877
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:04,570
He pay cash money like
you do here in California.

2878
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:09,900
So every dispensary's you know got way
too much money because they can't use

2879
01:24:10,061 --> 01:24:13,240
credit cards cause and then what did they
do when they take it to the bank banks

2880
01:24:13,241 --> 01:24:16,250
down except more than $10,000 yeah.

2881
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:21,190
Well that's also what's going on with
these asset forfeiture laws that are also

2882
01:24:21,191 --> 01:24:22,024
being,

2883
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,350
one of them got overturned.

2884
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:23,741
What did we say,

2885
01:24:23,741 --> 01:24:25,150
Tennessee we talked about the other day.

2886
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:28,570
It got overturned in Tennessee where
they were stealing people's money.

2887
01:24:28,571 --> 01:24:28,960
Man.

2888
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,140
People were driving somewhere like say
if you wanted to buy a car and you had

2889
01:24:32,141 --> 01:24:33,470
$7,000 on you and you,

2890
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,890
you left your house with like this
money that you save for a long time.

2891
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:37,720
If they pull you over and they go,

2892
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:39,610
why do you have $7,000 on new?

2893
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:39,881
And you're like,

2894
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:40,480
Whoa,

2895
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,940
but her car like the fuck Outta here.

2896
01:24:42,941 --> 01:24:47,370
They would just take that money and then
you would have to prove somehow talked

2897
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:48,700
theft is theft.

2898
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:49,960
It's not only just daft,

2899
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:52,260
but they would spend that money on any,

2900
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:53,350
it goes into a bank vault.

2901
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,900
They spent it in the most ironic way.

2902
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,560
They bought a fucking
Margarita machine and they,

2903
01:24:58,561 --> 01:24:58,761
they,

2904
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:02,230
they were using this Margarita
machine at a cop party.

2905
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:04,780
So you use the drug money.

2906
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:06,100
Have you thought someone
was selling drugs?

2907
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:10,180
You took it and then you bought a
fucking Margarita machine with this wow.

2908
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:10,631
To do,

2909
01:25:10,631 --> 01:25:11,140
give her,

2910
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:13,000
give yourselves legal drugs.

2911
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:16,300
Like you took drug money
to buy some drug machines.

2912
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,670
It's unbelievably gross.

2913
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:19,390
Careless.

2914
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:19,631
Yeah.

2915
01:25:19,631 --> 01:25:20,141
Well that's,

2916
01:25:20,141 --> 01:25:20,500
that's,

2917
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,950
that's part of what they were doing in
California with the medical marijuana.

2918
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:26,650
Medical marijuana is a state legal thing.

2919
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,410
So these places we're
following all the state laws.

2920
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:31,060
They got licenses to open.

2921
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:31,901
They opened up,

2922
01:25:31,901 --> 01:25:33,760
they even went through this
whole dispute where they said,

2923
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:33,941
look,

2924
01:25:33,941 --> 01:25:35,440
a lot of you are too close to schools.

2925
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:36,520
You've got to close down.

2926
01:25:36,521 --> 01:25:40,060
There's always a legislation that got
passed and a lot of pot stores had to get

2927
01:25:40,061 --> 01:25:40,780
closed down.

2928
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:42,070
Even after that,

2929
01:25:42,071 --> 01:25:43,510
the DEA came in,

2930
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:44,290
they,

2931
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:47,050
Jack booted these fucking
kids that were working there.

2932
01:25:47,051 --> 01:25:47,411
There's one,

2933
01:25:47,411 --> 01:25:49,420
there were these guys
stepping on his kid's neck.

2934
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:51,700
The kid is totally being compliant.

2935
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:52,960
They got 'em zip tied on the ground.

2936
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:55,180
He steps on his neck
when he gets off of him.

2937
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:55,631
I mean,

2938
01:25:55,631 --> 01:26:00,310
it's fucked up to what I
get enraged when I see that.

2939
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:03,010
I want to beat the fuck out
of that guy for doing that.

2940
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:03,321
Just,

2941
01:26:03,321 --> 01:26:04,370
it's so horrible.

2942
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:07,130
And I think if that was
your son or your daughter,

2943
01:26:07,131 --> 01:26:11,390
some 20 year old college kid who gets
their head stepped on by some fucking

2944
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:12,080
cunt,

2945
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:16,070
well they would steal the money and
then they would say that the charges are

2946
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:17,660
pending and never file.

2947
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:21,860
So that three quarters of $1 million
that they stole from your pot place and

2948
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:22,640
you're only working,

2949
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,930
you're making 20 bucks an hour,

2950
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:27,860
whatever work in there and
they're stepping on your
fucking neck and zip tying

2951
01:26:27,861 --> 01:26:29,660
your wrists until you have cuts on them.

2952
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:30,530
You know,

2953
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:31,790
for what and you don't even,

2954
01:26:31,791 --> 01:26:34,400
you're not even violating
a fucking federal law will.

2955
01:26:34,401 --> 01:26:34,911
The last,

2956
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:35,210
uh,

2957
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:36,290
d head of the Ge,

2958
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:37,130
I just resigned.

2959
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:38,940
And a god,

2960
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:41,240
that woman was very bad about pot.

2961
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,920
She was awful at this number.

2962
01:26:42,921 --> 01:26:43,754
Look at this number.

2963
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:49,120
In 2012 Texas law enforcement
and prosecutors ended the
year with $143 million

2964
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,480
in your honors for accounts.

2965
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,180
143 million.

2966
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:04,210
40,007 talking about this is what's
wrapped about everything that is

2967
01:27:04,701 --> 01:27:05,780
unbelievable.

2968
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:06,490
This is the,

2969
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:07,550
this one year,

2970
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:11,390
the state of Texas law enforcement
preying on the people of state of stealing

2971
01:27:11,391 --> 01:27:15,980
from the people stealing
$143 million just in a year.

2972
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:18,230
I'm sorry I interrupted
you about that DEA late 80,

2973
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,133
late or not at all.

2974
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:21,150
What's ironic is that she got put under,

2975
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:21,521
you know what,

2976
01:27:21,521 --> 01:27:24,500
what took her down of prostitution party.

2977
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,070
Oh yeah.

2978
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:26,060
The Dea had,

2979
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:28,010
they were hiring like secret service.

2980
01:27:28,011 --> 01:27:28,731
They had a little fun,

2981
01:27:28,731 --> 01:27:32,170
good service and the DEA were
having fun and another coach.

2982
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:32,580
What's,

2983
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,231
what the fuck.

2984
01:27:33,231 --> 01:27:34,064
Leave him alone.

2985
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:38,360
She got taken down for that and she is
not very progressive and I'm hoping that

2986
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:41,930
the attorney general is
blamed for handling of agents,

2987
01:27:41,931 --> 01:27:43,010
sex parties with hookers.

2988
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,650
Can't they just have a
little fun off the job?

2989
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:46,540
Uh,

2990
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:50,510
Manny's got damn nannies as long
as they weren't using state money.

2991
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:51,050
I mean we're,

2992
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:51,920
where'd the money go?

2993
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:52,371
Well,

2994
01:27:52,371 --> 01:27:57,371
with money with the DEA is not exactly
the most organized division of our

2995
01:27:57,801 --> 01:27:58,634
government.

2996
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:02,390
What we've played that Jared was a
Jared Polis was the representative of

2997
01:28:02,391 --> 01:28:07,391
Colorado who is grilling her on what is
more addictive marijuana or crystal meth

2998
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:10,310
was more directive that
marijuana or heroin,

2999
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,570
what is worse for you?

3000
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:15,590
I think that all drugs and he'd
just kind of asking her what is,

3001
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:16,340
what is worse?

3002
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,920
Is marijuana as bad as crystal meth?

3003
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:19,820
Can you just answer that?

3004
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:20,953
I think

3005
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:28,060
all illegal drugs are bad and it's like
the most maddening fucking bureaucratic

3006
01:28:29,091 --> 01:28:30,950
red tape horseshit conversation.

3007
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:31,460
Right?

3008
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:34,220
That was the house he never
fess up and she should change.

3009
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:39,550
Washington went legal basically from
Washington right around here looking out

3010
01:28:40,401 --> 01:28:41,750
the window of her office,

3011
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:46,520
denying of reality that's going on
right in front of and not only that,

3012
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:51,380
denying all of the medical studies that
have all been completed turned in peer

3013
01:28:51,381 --> 01:28:52,180
reviewed,

3014
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:55,250
observed by everyone on the Internet.

3015
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,190
It's not like a,

3016
01:28:56,690 --> 01:29:01,690
it's not some crazy conspiracy and it's
not like a mystery that pot's not bad

3017
01:29:02,101 --> 01:29:02,610
for you.

3018
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:03,000
I mean,

3019
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,430
and whatever negative effects
that they've attributed to it.

3020
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,091
Mike,

3021
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:06,490
God,

3022
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:08,370
you saw that bloody diarrhea commercial.

3023
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:09,690
We've already talked about this.

3024
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:13,380
Not Everybody has the same reaction to
all sorts of different things in your

3025
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:13,950
body,

3026
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:17,340
but when it comes to like
the most mild have mild,

3027
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:18,001
when you,

3028
01:29:18,001 --> 01:29:21,000
when you look at the worst case
scenario for reaction for pot,

3029
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,111
God damn,

3030
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:22,944
it's pretty mild.

3031
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,120
So for fall asleep,

3032
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:27,570
a few people seem to have
issues with like what they get.

3033
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,040
They can't stop smoking pot.

3034
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:29,881
Guess what?

3035
01:29:29,881 --> 01:29:31,620
People have issues with scratch tickets.

3036
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:32,221
Okay.

3037
01:29:32,221 --> 01:29:33,930
If they have issues with speeding,

3038
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:36,300
there's people that
can't go the speed limit.

3039
01:29:36,301 --> 01:29:36,900
They have a,

3040
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:37,240
they do.

3041
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:40,740
Do you have an addiction
to like pushing l dilemma?

3042
01:29:40,741 --> 01:29:42,360
Like they want to just go just a cat.

3043
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,190
It's not even that they're in a rush.

3044
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:48,000
It's just they have this weird addiction
to doing something that's naughty.

3045
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,220
I'm just,

3046
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:52,980
because I can't stop it and they'll
get 1516 fucking speeding tickets,

3047
01:29:52,981 --> 01:29:53,850
lose their license.

3048
01:29:53,851 --> 01:29:54,730
They can't slow the house.

3049
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,060
It's not a Sammy Hagar Song.

3050
01:29:57,061 --> 01:29:58,050
They're real human beings,

3051
01:29:58,890 --> 01:29:59,101
right?

3052
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:00,510
People are addicted to all kinds of shit.

3053
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,060
That's why like a lady like that is,

3054
01:30:02,061 --> 01:30:03,720
is it's really dangerous,

3055
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:03,931
Dan.

3056
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:05,700
It was a person like
that testifying on TV.

3057
01:30:05,701 --> 01:30:07,410
If you don't have a guy like Jared Polis,

3058
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:08,970
a guy who just grills her,

3059
01:30:08,971 --> 01:30:11,090
it makes her look like a
fool and doesn't do it in a,

3060
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:13,230
I mean he's not being an asshole about it.

3061
01:30:13,231 --> 01:30:18,000
He's not being mean or he's not pointing
fingers and yelling and using hyperbole

3062
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:19,440
and theater.

3063
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:20,603
He shocking,

3064
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,200
shocking use of the post though.

3065
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,980
I mean they make you the head of the
DEA and you're supposed to be in a semi

3066
01:30:25,981 --> 01:30:29,070
progressive government
and who do you report to?

3067
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:31,910
The president or Eric
Holder or whoever it is and,

3068
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:33,030
but that's the hustle.

3069
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:35,370
The hustle is that this is a
semi progressive government,

3070
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:36,600
but it is no such thing.

3071
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:37,650
They don't exist anymore.

3072
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,290
You can't get in there if
you're semi progressive union,

3073
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:40,980
you can't,

3074
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:44,100
you can put on the semi semi progressive
tee shirt when you're running for

3075
01:30:44,101 --> 01:30:44,600
office.

3076
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,090
Right.

3077
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:47,190
But when they had a redact
all that shit from the,

3078
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:47,550
uh,

3079
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:51,450
the hope and change or whatever the fuck
his website was about whistleblowers

3080
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,880
when people after the Edward
Snowden thing where like,

3081
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:54,601
hey man,

3082
01:30:54,601 --> 01:30:57,960
do you remember what you said that
you were going to honor them and uh,

3083
01:30:57,961 --> 01:31:00,480
and they were important part of
the process and blah blah blah.

3084
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:00,721
Yeah.

3085
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:01,291
What the fuck.

3086
01:31:01,291 --> 01:31:02,460
And they just pull all that stuff.

3087
01:31:02,461 --> 01:31:02,941
It's all,

3088
01:31:02,941 --> 01:31:03,870
it's a dance.

3089
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:04,621
It's a dance.

3090
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:08,400
Everyone essentially who gets
into office has the same master.

3091
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:09,480
They all have the same mass.

3092
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:10,440
Oh no question of that.

3093
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:11,760
But I think we were saying about pot,

3094
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:12,510
the,

3095
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,060
the thing people are going to
get addicted to is the money.

3096
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:15,820
Yeah,

3097
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:16,653
call it.

3098
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:21,210
The Colorado model is so successful and
other been to Washington state too and

3099
01:31:21,211 --> 01:31:22,590
it's just spinning money for them.

3100
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:24,870
And I said on my show last week,

3101
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:28,260
they can't have a bake
sale and make this money.

3102
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,200
There's the state that kind
of revenue is like found.

3103
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:31,800
Yeah.

3104
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:32,530
And I said,

3105
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:32,900
Andy,

3106
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:34,440
you don't have to open a casino.

3107
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:35,281
You know,

3108
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,114
it keeps that,

3109
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:37,471
I mean it's just,

3110
01:31:37,471 --> 01:31:38,030
I dunno,

3111
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:42,360
I find it a lot more acceptable and
progressive than building casinos in bars

3112
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:42,780
everywhere.

3113
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:42,880
Well,

3114
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:43,111
you know,

3115
01:31:43,111 --> 01:31:44,920
when you see the ebb and the tide of,

3116
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:46,770
of society and you see,

3117
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:47,041
you know,

3118
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:51,540
at one point in time the Republicans
were the really open minded progressive

3119
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:52,290
party.

3120
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:53,520
That was a long time ago.

3121
01:31:53,521 --> 01:31:55,230
That was what a Republican was,

3122
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,700
what a Republican was,

3123
01:31:56,701 --> 01:31:58,470
was totally different
than what a Democrat was.

3124
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:00,160
There was almost polar opposites.

3125
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:05,730
And w another thing that you're seeing
today really lately like it seems like

3126
01:32:05,951 --> 01:32:10,300
over the last few years is like the
people who are progressive probably as a

3127
01:32:10,301 --> 01:32:14,350
reaction to all the assholery that they
had to deal with as a young person or

3128
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:15,080
all the,

3129
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,320
the all the,

3130
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:21,360
what they believe is the slights and the
misappropriation of money for war and

3131
01:32:21,521 --> 01:32:22,450
all the different shit that they're,

3132
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:24,360
they should be right about,

3133
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,450
they should be angry about.

3134
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,680
But now they're the aggressive ones
when it comes to policing speech.

3135
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:34,540
When it comes to like shielding people
from anything that might make me

3136
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:35,530
uncomfortable.

3137
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:36,910
Fat Shaming.

3138
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,441
There's a lot of,

3139
01:32:37,441 --> 01:32:41,710
it's crazy talk and really aggressive
about it comes from the left now.

3140
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:42,281
I was like,

3141
01:32:42,281 --> 01:32:43,810
they're the school moms.

3142
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:44,590
You know,

3143
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:44,960
there's,

3144
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:45,640
it means someone,

3145
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,040
someone wrote that on Twitter.

3146
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,390
I think Christina Summers was,

3147
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,320
I forget the tweet.

3148
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:52,270
I retweeted it the other day,

3149
01:32:52,271 --> 01:32:54,400
but it was so appropriate
because it was exactly that.

3150
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:55,181
It's like,

3151
01:32:55,181 --> 01:32:55,961
how did this happen?

3152
01:32:55,961 --> 01:32:56,794
It's shifted.

3153
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,560
And then Bruce Jenner goes on TV,

3154
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:02,950
says he's becoming a woman
and he's a Republican.

3155
01:33:03,730 --> 01:33:04,391
And everybody went,

3156
01:33:04,391 --> 01:33:04,780
wait,

3157
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:05,613
what?

3158
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:07,960
Diane stores reaction was fantastic.

3159
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,040
I cried laughing.

3160
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:09,993
She went,

3161
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:10,540
what?

3162
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:11,021
And then she goes,

3163
01:33:11,021 --> 01:33:11,621
you're a republican.

3164
01:33:11,621 --> 01:33:11,981
And he goes,

3165
01:33:11,981 --> 01:33:12,800
is there anything wrong with that?

3166
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:12,990
She said,

3167
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:13,100
no,

3168
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:13,191
no,

3169
01:33:13,191 --> 01:33:13,301
no,

3170
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:13,720
no.

3171
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,390
So you're going to go to John
Bayner and mentioned McConnell.

3172
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:16,990
And he went,

3173
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:17,201
yeah,

3174
01:33:17,201 --> 01:33:18,011
I do it in a heartbeat.

3175
01:33:18,011 --> 01:33:18,844
And she just went,

3176
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,630
there was a tank of her life.

3177
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,870
You're barking up the wrong tree,

3178
01:33:22,871 --> 01:33:23,171
bro.

3179
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:24,004
Hames.

3180
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:24,371
Well,

3181
01:33:24,371 --> 01:33:27,700
he's a an odd case in that unique,

3182
01:33:27,701 --> 01:33:28,270
obviously.

3183
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:28,630
Yeah,

3184
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:29,411
he's famous.

3185
01:33:29,411 --> 01:33:30,310
He's got a past.

3186
01:33:30,311 --> 01:33:31,660
He's a famous sports star.

3187
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:33,250
There's a lot going on,

3188
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:36,010
but I think for transgender people,

3189
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:37,240
I think it's amazing.

3190
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:37,450
Oh,

3191
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:38,290
it's fantastic.

3192
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,560
Two hours on TV and dedicated to this
person who's decided to become a woman.

3193
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,010
And then here's the thing,

3194
01:33:45,011 --> 01:33:45,331
someone,

3195
01:33:45,331 --> 01:33:46,164
people will go,

3196
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:46,721
oh,

3197
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:46,961
well,

3198
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:47,501
you know what?

3199
01:33:47,501 --> 01:33:50,500
What about the possibility that
what he has a mental illness,

3200
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:52,720
what that is possible.

3201
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:53,081
Listen,

3202
01:33:53,081 --> 01:33:53,831
it is possible.

3203
01:33:53,831 --> 01:33:54,340
This pie,

3204
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:56,500
there's all sorts of possibilities
when it comes to mental illnesses,

3205
01:33:56,501 --> 01:33:57,311
but that wasn't my point.

3206
01:33:57,311 --> 01:34:01,240
My point is if he has a mental illness
in the worst case scenario of the mental

3207
01:34:01,241 --> 01:34:01,990
illnesses,

3208
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:04,330
he wants to be a woman and
then it becomes a woman.

3209
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:05,860
Right?

3210
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:06,693
But he's lesbian.

3211
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:09,160
That's way better than not Hetero,

3212
01:34:09,161 --> 01:34:09,994
which was weird.

3213
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:10,241
No,

3214
01:34:10,241 --> 01:34:10,540
he's a,

3215
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:13,300
he's going to become a lesbian who he's
gunna become a lesbian because he's a

3216
01:34:13,301 --> 01:34:13,790
man.

3217
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:15,350
He was using he pronouns,

3218
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:15,730
right.

3219
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:17,590
He wanted to be referred
to as Bruce and he,

3220
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,020
so like he has always been a woman.

3221
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:21,190
So it's very,

3222
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,450
and you know you're supposed to like,

3223
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,450
he's supposed to not questioning that and
let people get away with anything when

3224
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:26,350
it comes to he,

3225
01:34:26,351 --> 01:34:28,090
she gender definitions,

3226
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:29,710
I guess that would be queer or whatever.

3227
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:30,251
Whatever it is,

3228
01:34:30,251 --> 01:34:31,630
whatever the fuck he wants it to be.

3229
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:33,890
The point being why?

3230
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:34,451
First of all,

3231
01:34:34,451 --> 01:34:36,430
why do you give a shit if he
wants to remove his penis or not?

3232
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:37,780
And second,

3233
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:40,930
if the worst case scenario
is he becomes a woman,

3234
01:34:40,931 --> 01:34:44,770
is it really so bad to be a woman at
65 what fucking difference does it mean

3235
01:34:44,771 --> 01:34:48,070
right at 65 anybody who fucks
you is throwing you a bone,

3236
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:48,910
right?

3237
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:49,743
Let's be honest.

3238
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:50,471
And that's like,

3239
01:34:50,471 --> 01:34:52,180
if you're rushing me,

3240
01:34:52,181 --> 01:34:53,230
I'm sitting right in here.

3241
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:54,910
If you're going to become a woman,

3242
01:34:54,911 --> 01:34:57,280
that's a pro stop.

3243
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,123
Show me anything.

3244
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:59,960
If you want to become a woman,

3245
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:02,690
that's the best time
when it's over anyway.

3246
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:06,140
And we wouldn't be a 65 year
old man or a 65 year old woman.

3247
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:07,190
I don't know what the fuck you dude.

3248
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,570
Just like be a woman now.

3249
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:09,463
Perfect.

3250
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:10,960
And you don't even need an operation.

3251
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:12,350
I thought it was a woman,

3252
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:15,950
Diane Sawyer or was being pretty
good at been interviewing them.

3253
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:18,530
And then when he said
he wanted to be a woman,

3254
01:35:18,531 --> 01:35:19,364
she's like,

3255
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,740
you missed all the good years.

3256
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:22,221
And I thought,

3257
01:35:22,221 --> 01:35:23,360
that's really sexist.

3258
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:25,340
You're a 65 year old woman,

3259
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:26,323
Diane.

3260
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:29,410
Only that she's basing his
value on whether or not,

3261
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,810
and we'll want to have any,

3262
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:33,170
she all of a sudden she's
using the standard that I have.

3263
01:35:33,171 --> 01:35:33,591
Sure.

3264
01:35:33,591 --> 01:35:35,180
She wouldn't want to
be judged by if I said,

3265
01:35:35,181 --> 01:35:36,014
well Diane,

3266
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:39,080
you're over 60 I don't find
you as attractive as I did.

3267
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:39,681
You know what I mean?

3268
01:35:39,681 --> 01:35:40,010
Like,

3269
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:42,740
and I thought that was
really a wild thing to say.

3270
01:35:42,741 --> 01:35:45,590
I mean I understood it because it's a
knee jerk reactionary thing to say it like

3271
01:35:45,591 --> 01:35:46,281
what you don't do that,

3272
01:35:46,281 --> 01:35:47,280
you're not going to get the budget.

3273
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:48,510
You know like right.

3274
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:49,101
Someone would say,

3275
01:35:49,101 --> 01:35:50,670
but I also thought a,

3276
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:55,780
you're at New York intellectual media
chattering class rich involved person

3277
01:35:56,451 --> 01:35:56,781
type.

3278
01:35:56,781 --> 01:35:57,930
That was a pretty weird reaction.

3279
01:35:57,931 --> 01:35:58,100
Nigga.

3280
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,240
You missed all the good years.

3281
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:00,770
Especially since she's that age.

3282
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:01,520
Yeah.

3283
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:01,671
Well,

3284
01:36:01,671 --> 01:36:04,610
I think she has the license to
say because she's out of course.

3285
01:36:04,611 --> 01:36:05,680
But also it's like,

3286
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:06,010
you know,

3287
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:10,320
just highlights how ridiculous the
progressive structure of language has be,

3288
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:11,740
but has to fall into,

3289
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:12,290
he can't,

3290
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:14,330
she can't make a joke like
that to him about that.

3291
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:15,140
It's funny.

3292
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:15,800
It's funny,

3293
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:16,850
but it was so sexist.

3294
01:36:16,851 --> 01:36:20,090
Like I'm pretty sure
that Diet fucking story,

3295
01:36:20,091 --> 01:36:21,650
it's a sexist against women.

3296
01:36:22,130 --> 01:36:23,470
Pretty sure you know,

3297
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:26,420
you can be God [inaudible] certain no,

3298
01:36:26,421 --> 01:36:27,201
you didn't even,

3299
01:36:27,201 --> 01:36:27,801
you're right.

3300
01:36:27,801 --> 01:36:28,700
And what you said,

3301
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:30,290
and if you judge everybody
by the standards,

3302
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:34,390
they're like really super progressive
complainers will judge people by it

3303
01:36:34,391 --> 01:36:36,800
because there are certain things that
people will write blogs about where you

3304
01:36:36,801 --> 01:36:37,190
go,

3305
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:39,230
Jesus fucking Christ,

3306
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:41,090
will you stop let off.

3307
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:42,110
Will you just stop?

3308
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:44,570
This is your being completely ridiculous.

3309
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:45,831
Like he was one,

3310
01:36:45,831 --> 01:36:48,830
there was a fat shaming one that I
tweeted the other day about protein world.

3311
01:36:48,831 --> 01:36:50,150
This thing that's going on in England,

3312
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:51,320
they have this,

3313
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,040
uh,

3314
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,600
this billboard is in England.

3315
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:56,630
They have this billboard that says,

3316
01:36:56,690 --> 01:36:57,290
uh,

3317
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:57,830
you know,

3318
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:59,780
is your body beach body ready?

3319
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:00,261
Oh yeah,

3320
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:00,700
I saw that.

3321
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:04,640
And there's a girl in a bikini looks
really hot and people got angry that they

3322
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:08,060
were fat shaming that
by showing this girl,

3323
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:09,350
so look at this,

3324
01:37:09,351 --> 01:37:10,240
are you beach body?

3325
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:10,661
Rather than,

3326
01:37:10,661 --> 01:37:11,491
they took pictures of it.

3327
01:37:11,491 --> 01:37:11,591
Right.

3328
01:37:11,591 --> 01:37:16,040
And they were facing them fuck off on it
and stuff like the protein world about,

3329
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:16,251
no,

3330
01:37:16,251 --> 01:37:17,720
actually that's not true.

3331
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:18,680
What would those be?

3332
01:37:18,681 --> 01:37:19,520
Facings.

3333
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,190
Most of them were photoshops.

3334
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,390
Most of them are people bullshitting.

3335
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,710
And guess I didn't read very carefully.

3336
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:24,870
Yeah.

3337
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:26,840
Well because a lot of
social justice warriors,

3338
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:29,990
it would be really into doing something
like that are incredibly socially

3339
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:30,501
retarded.

3340
01:37:30,501 --> 01:37:30,890
Yeah.

3341
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:32,510
And they have a lot of,

3342
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:32,810
you know,

3343
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,550
social anxiety and they're
not going to go out.

3344
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,473
Some of them would,

3345
01:37:35,570 --> 01:37:37,280
but they're not going to likely go out,

3346
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:39,500
paint over this shit,

3347
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:42,210
new practicing or whatever that uh,

3348
01:37:42,510 --> 01:37:43,370
he was a nice gap.

3349
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:44,760
The Powell,

3350
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:45,590
the,

3351
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:47,150
the acne cream was,

3352
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,310
isn't this also an unrealistic,

3353
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:50,431
no.

3354
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:51,230
Awesome body.

3355
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:51,471
No,

3356
01:37:51,471 --> 01:37:52,670
it's not if you're that girl,

3357
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:54,110
but it's genetic.

3358
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:54,441
I mean,

3359
01:37:54,441 --> 01:37:55,201
if you're that girl,

3360
01:37:55,201 --> 01:37:56,040
it's not impossible,

3361
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,210
but it is genetic.

3362
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:57,871
I mean,

3363
01:37:57,871 --> 01:37:58,081
yeah,

3364
01:37:58,081 --> 01:37:59,280
but we're all,

3365
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:00,114
you know,

3366
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:03,420
there's always going to be the perfect
looking people and sure everyone will

3367
01:38:03,421 --> 01:38:04,590
always want to look like them.

3368
01:38:04,591 --> 01:38:07,110
And then there's the
whole question of that.

3369
01:38:07,111 --> 01:38:08,250
But that's not shaming.

3370
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:08,910
Okay.

3371
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:10,350
That is impressive.

3372
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:11,820
That's inspiring.

3373
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:13,200
That's inspiring.

3374
01:38:13,201 --> 01:38:13,501
And if there,

3375
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:15,780
is it because you're attracted to you,

3376
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:16,411
maybe,

3377
01:38:16,411 --> 01:38:19,260
but if you're a woman and you
can possibly look like that,

3378
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:20,160
which is not all women.

3379
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:21,600
Some women have odd shaped bodies.

3380
01:38:21,601 --> 01:38:22,440
I was just a fact.

3381
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:25,260
We've all met women who
are boxy or really wide.

3382
01:38:25,261 --> 01:38:25,620
And you know,

3383
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,660
it's probably annoying to
them to see shit like that.

3384
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:28,710
But guess what?

3385
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:30,930
When that fucking dude who
plays Tyrion Lannister,

3386
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:31,764
what's his name?

3387
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,441
The,

3388
01:38:32,441 --> 01:38:32,691
the,

3389
01:38:32,691 --> 01:38:33,050
the,

3390
01:38:33,050 --> 01:38:33,750
the guy,

3391
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:34,830
the small man.

3392
01:38:34,890 --> 01:38:35,640
Um,

3393
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,080
what does this dude from game of Thrones,

3394
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:37,943
Oh yeah.

3395
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:39,113
What is his name?

3396
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:40,223
Peter Dinklage.

3397
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:41,250
Peter Dinklage.

3398
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:43,520
When Peter Dinklage sees a
fucking Abercrombie and Fitch ad,

3399
01:38:43,521 --> 01:38:44,640
but the dude with a six pack,

3400
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:45,190
you know,

3401
01:38:45,190 --> 01:38:47,820
with long legs and long arms and shit.

3402
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:49,380
I bet that freaked him the fuck out too.

3403
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:54,450
But doesn't mean Abercrombie and Fitch
had stopped showing twinks with six packs

3404
01:38:54,451 --> 01:38:55,440
to sell underwear.

3405
01:38:56,210 --> 01:38:57,030
It's fine.

3406
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:58,680
It's like it's not body shaming.

3407
01:38:58,681 --> 01:38:59,580
It should pressive.

3408
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:00,443
That's what it is.

3409
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:01,530
It's unusual.

3410
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,840
It's not the mean that body,

3411
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:04,620
not the mean.

3412
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:06,030
Who's got a body like that?

3413
01:39:06,031 --> 01:39:07,230
The woman's got a perfect body.

3414
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,101
That's not normal.

3415
01:39:08,101 --> 01:39:09,540
That's not a lot of people blind.

3416
01:39:09,541 --> 01:39:10,290
She's gray.

3417
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:11,130
It's not fat shaming.

3418
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:12,900
Here's a real fucking problem with that.

3419
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:13,681
Here's the real problem.

3420
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:14,490
What they're doing,

3421
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:15,480
they're selling.

3422
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,640
They're selling like
some sort of diet plan.

3423
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,230
That was not what it was,

3424
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:18,481
right?

3425
01:39:18,481 --> 01:39:19,320
Isn't that what it is?

3426
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,310
See what it is.

3427
01:39:21,710 --> 01:39:21,980
What?

3428
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:22,341
What is it?

3429
01:39:22,341 --> 01:39:22,580
If it's,

3430
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:23,850
is it just protein?

3431
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:24,850
What's pull?

3432
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:28,290
Go to the actual thing itself,

3433
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,090
but see where few are so mad,

3434
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:30,811
like look at that.

3435
01:39:30,811 --> 01:39:33,150
I smashed patriarchy with a hammer.

3436
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:34,470
I scroll down and look at that.

3437
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:35,620
Look at this.

3438
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:36,090
Look at this.

3439
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:36,871
If I had a hammer,

3440
01:39:36,871 --> 01:39:38,250
I'd smash patriarchy.

3441
01:39:38,251 --> 01:39:39,390
I found it in the hammer.

3442
01:39:39,391 --> 01:39:42,470
Has feminism written on the handle of,

3443
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:42,840
look,

3444
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:47,840
I just want to tell you that woman in
that picture is an actual woman like she

3445
01:39:48,631 --> 01:39:49,620
actually exists.

3446
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:51,120
That's not fair enough.

3447
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:54,930
It's not patriarchy because
someone wants to look like that.

3448
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:56,700
She's attractive.

3449
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:58,830
That is a sexually attractive woman.

3450
01:39:58,831 --> 01:39:59,290
It's not us,

3451
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:02,550
but our dominant paradigm that
depresses us at all times.

3452
01:40:02,551 --> 01:40:03,384
Joe,

3453
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,880
if you decide to look
at the world like that,

3454
01:40:05,881 --> 01:40:08,550
you can find absolutely everywhere you go.

3455
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:12,090
That's why sometimes I think it'd be fun
to be a right wing conservative because

3456
01:40:12,450 --> 01:40:12,811
then you,

3457
01:40:12,811 --> 01:40:15,570
you can just blame lots of
people for stuff and well,

3458
01:40:15,571 --> 01:40:16,980
how about being a left wing radical?

3459
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:18,150
No,

3460
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:19,170
it's exactly the same.

3461
01:40:19,171 --> 01:40:20,520
I have all these people in the fray,

3462
01:40:20,521 --> 01:40:21,480
Dev and all these people.

3463
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:25,530
But you're not so left wing radical
or this doesn't make sense to you?

3464
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:26,720
Well,

3465
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,340
most things make sense if you
think about it after awhile.

3466
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:31,560
I just don't.

3467
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:35,520
I think that people are absolutely would
get uncomfortable if their body could

3468
01:40:35,521 --> 01:40:37,920
never look like that and they
would walk by and see that.

3469
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:39,630
But that's the breaks,

3470
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:40,291
you know?

3471
01:40:40,291 --> 01:40:41,011
That's just how,

3472
01:40:41,011 --> 01:40:41,730
that's life.

3473
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:46,730
Life hands you weird cards and if you
believe in freedom you believe that

3474
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:54,160
someone should be able to
sell the image of that to

3475
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,520
stand there with the Bikini
and use it for their products.

3476
01:40:57,521 --> 01:40:58,100
The prize,

3477
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:01,390
like no one really product cause no
one really did to face the boards.

3478
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:02,051
It was just,

3479
01:41:02,051 --> 01:41:02,411
no,

3480
01:41:02,411 --> 01:41:05,510
it's all bullshit because I thought I
sell one of those the other day they will

3481
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:06,353
look some money.

3482
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:09,100
Some people might have done it,

3483
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:12,130
but apparently according to
the people at protein world,

3484
01:41:12,131 --> 01:41:13,120
they had a state,

3485
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,231
a statement.

3486
01:41:14,231 --> 01:41:15,830
They said that they were
all photoshops if they,

3487
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,240
hi Lindsay and I live in French fi world
and it's a little bit different in my

3488
01:41:19,241 --> 01:41:19,840
world.

3489
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:20,310
You're,

3490
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:20,950
you're a little,

3491
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:22,660
I am beach body ready
and French fry world.

3492
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,510
I'm material heirloom tomato
world heirloom tomato.

3493
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:27,100
It's what I live off of.

3494
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:28,390
Little Balsamic Vinegar,

3495
01:41:28,530 --> 01:41:30,430
a little sea salt sprinkled on top on it.

3496
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:30,911
No,

3497
01:41:30,911 --> 01:41:34,030
you don't need that fucking cow shit
and just slice through that tomato.

3498
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:36,340
It's one of the most
delicious things in the world.

3499
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:40,420
Heirloom tomatoes with a little balsamic
vinegar and just a little dash of

3500
01:41:40,421 --> 01:41:40,901
Cecil.

3501
01:41:40,901 --> 01:41:42,110
And my wife really likes it,

3502
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:43,061
so you know what I mean?

3503
01:41:43,061 --> 01:41:43,630
It's beautiful.

3504
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:43,781
Well,

3505
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:45,580
tomatoes are supposed to taste like that,

3506
01:41:45,581 --> 01:41:47,790
but those tomatoes last like an hour you,

3507
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:49,870
you buy heirloom tomatoes
from the grocery store.

3508
01:41:49,871 --> 01:41:53,200
Those bitches are good for like a day
and then they start getting all mushy.

3509
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:54,280
But when you eat them,

3510
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:56,110
you understand that
tomatoes are really a fruit.

3511
01:41:56,111 --> 01:41:57,310
That difference between,

3512
01:41:57,530 --> 01:41:58,060
uh,

3513
01:41:58,060 --> 01:41:59,050
the big puffy,

3514
01:41:59,051 --> 01:42:00,940
watery agro farm.

3515
01:42:00,941 --> 01:42:04,360
The hard ones that can travel for weeks.

3516
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:04,810
They can,

3517
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:06,040
they bred them that way.

3518
01:42:06,070 --> 01:42:06,910
They bounce,

3519
01:42:07,230 --> 01:42:08,063
they have like,

3520
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:09,461
they don't take,

3521
01:42:09,461 --> 01:42:10,600
they taste really bland.

3522
01:42:10,650 --> 01:42:11,020
Yeah.

3523
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:11,470
Why don't we,

3524
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:14,210
there's a big difference between
those and like the Jersey beef,

3525
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:14,681
steak,

3526
01:42:14,681 --> 01:42:15,640
tomatoes and old,

3527
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:17,590
they're old jeans and
that's genetically modified.

3528
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:19,900
Like when people start talking
about genetic modifications,

3529
01:42:19,901 --> 01:42:20,351
guess what?

3530
01:42:20,351 --> 01:42:21,184
That's what that is.

3531
01:42:21,490 --> 01:42:24,030
That's what the tomatoes
in the corner breeding.

3532
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:25,060
It's an apples.

3533
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:27,970
That's why there's only like five
kinds of apples instead of a thousand.

3534
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:28,661
Yeah,

3535
01:42:28,661 --> 01:42:29,160
right.

3536
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:29,340
Oh,

3537
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:29,980
and they're like,

3538
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,160
girl is fucked too.

3539
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:33,310
We like five different
kinds of potatoes here.

3540
01:42:33,311 --> 01:42:35,290
But in South America obviously,

3541
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:37,090
where the potato was invented,

3542
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:39,580
there's thousands of strains.

3543
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:39,941
Yeah.

3544
01:42:39,941 --> 01:42:43,570
They have all the different shape and
purple and green and all weird different

3545
01:42:43,571 --> 01:42:44,620
operators and shit.

3546
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:46,400
You ever seen Yukon?

3547
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:49,750
Like how much is involved in processing
that and making food out of it?

3548
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:50,650
Oh my God.

3549
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:52,690
How'd he say it?

3550
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:53,523
I would say Yakka.

3551
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:54,370
Hmm.

3552
01:42:54,370 --> 01:42:55,203
You're probably right.

3553
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:56,201
Yeah.

3554
01:42:56,201 --> 01:42:57,040
If I was called porter,

3555
01:42:57,041 --> 01:42:59,160
I'd write a song about that you say.

3556
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:01,323
Hmm.

3557
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:02,711
But you know,

3558
01:43:02,711 --> 01:43:03,760
it's like on one hand,

3559
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,450
what is that?

3560
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:05,380
The humble potato?

3561
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,273
That's all the different,

3562
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:06,761
oh yeah,

3563
01:43:06,761 --> 01:43:07,594
it's a potatoes.

3564
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:08,261
Whoa.

3565
01:43:08,261 --> 01:43:09,100
They look really cool.

3566
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:09,520
I mean,

3567
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:13,510
the ink has South America
and the American Indians,

3568
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:14,020
uh,

3569
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:14,740
and uh,

3570
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:15,310
on,

3571
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:15,941
in Moscow,

3572
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:19,870
in North America invented
the horticulture and uh,

3573
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,940
the husbands or eve or
whatever you call it,

3574
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:22,250
uh,

3575
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:23,620
if potatoes and corn,

3576
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:28,720
corn was not an edible product till the
Indian started planning it and making it

3577
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:31,690
into something they could
eat and they developed it.

3578
01:43:31,691 --> 01:43:32,770
And the ink is an,

3579
01:43:32,771 --> 01:43:37,150
all the tribes that lived in South America
and those civilizations developed all

3580
01:43:37,151 --> 01:43:38,680
those potatoes and bread them.

3581
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:39,521
That's amazing.

3582
01:43:39,521 --> 01:43:40,590
And so it's a,

3583
01:43:40,591 --> 01:43:44,480
it's an extraordinary feat of agriculture.

3584
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:45,341
The end,

3585
01:43:45,341 --> 01:43:50,341
the fact that potatoes and corn basically
saved Europe from starvation in that

3586
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:51,711
same time period.

3587
01:43:51,711 --> 01:43:54,320
We're talking about when they were able
to bring all that back from the new

3588
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:55,154
world,

3589
01:43:55,690 --> 01:43:59,720
Europe wasn't doing so hot with the
nutrition right around then because they

3590
01:43:59,721 --> 01:44:01,820
didn't have a lot of
vegetables that captain,

3591
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:02,420
uh,

3592
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:04,310
potatoes like a perfect vegetable,

3593
01:44:04,311 --> 01:44:04,630
right?

3594
01:44:04,630 --> 01:44:04,950
Yeah.

3595
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:08,000
You could actually live on potatoes
almost to the exclusion of everything else

3596
01:44:08,001 --> 01:44:10,490
and not die cause it hasn't
relied in than in it.

3597
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:14,570
It's really rich in vitamin
C and potassium to d as well.

3598
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:15,330
Yeah.

3599
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:18,040
Data's or like this extraordinary kind of,

3600
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:19,100
and then what do we do with it?

3601
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:23,600
We'd take the fucking nutritious part off
of it and we boil it and then put salt

3602
01:44:23,601 --> 01:44:23,990
on it.

3603
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:24,823
It's awesome.

3604
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:25,520
It's so great.

3605
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:26,920
Then put it in bleach lessons,

3606
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,250
it ranch dressing and then,

3607
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:29,670
and like a corn,

3608
01:44:29,671 --> 01:44:29,890
you know,

3609
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:30,150
that,

3610
01:44:30,150 --> 01:44:32,480
that the whole argument over
Gmo corn and everything.

3611
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:33,343
I was like,

3612
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:35,253
yeah,

3613
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,690
I don't know that.

3614
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:38,480
And also that GMO corn,

3615
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:39,373
the stuff that again,

3616
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:40,190
um,

3617
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:41,090
for like uh,

3618
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,410
for cattle and stuff,

3619
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:43,430
you can't even eat that shit.

3620
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,140
Oh No.

3621
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:47,110
It's like the stuff they
grow for feed for animals,

3622
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:47,720
like the growth,

3623
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:47,871
you know,

3624
01:44:47,871 --> 01:44:50,570
high in protein and resistant to
pesticides and all that stuff.

3625
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:51,920
They in that show,

3626
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:53,570
the documentary king corn,

3627
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:54,921
they tried eating it.

3628
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:55,071
You know,

3629
01:44:55,071 --> 01:44:58,730
they grew at an acre of corn and they
went through the whole process and through

3630
01:44:58,731 --> 01:45:00,830
the documentary and then they try
to eat their core and they're like,

3631
01:45:00,831 --> 01:45:01,491
well fuck,

3632
01:45:01,491 --> 01:45:02,324
are we growing?

3633
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,110
Isn't that horrible?

3634
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:04,340
Gusting it's crazy.

3635
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:05,331
It's crazy.

3636
01:45:05,331 --> 01:45:08,990
Well that's when you find out
how dangerous California's
drought is because we

3637
01:45:08,991 --> 01:45:12,770
always associate the heartland
with growing our VI vegetables.

3638
01:45:12,771 --> 01:45:14,030
But that's not really the case.

3639
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,430
The heartland is where
we grow all the corn.

3640
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:18,260
We grow up a lot of different shit.

3641
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:20,520
Obviously there's a lot of soy,

3642
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:22,460
all sorts of different things get grown.

3643
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:26,360
But California is responsible for like
a huge percentage of the tomatoes,

3644
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:28,130
huge percentage of the almonds,

3645
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:30,020
a huge percentage of the blueberries,

3646
01:45:30,021 --> 01:45:30,801
Avocados,

3647
01:45:30,801 --> 01:45:31,820
strawberries,

3648
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:33,133
oranges.

3649
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:37,560
There's a whole lot of shit that gets
grown in California and you find out how

3650
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:39,080
fuck we are with water.

3651
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:40,640
It's when you realize like,

3652
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:40,821
oh,

3653
01:45:40,821 --> 01:45:44,870
this is a food issue for people is
not just a food issue for our food.

3654
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:46,970
It's a food issue front the whole country.

3655
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:50,210
That's why I want to lead a
midnight raid to lake mead tonight.

3656
01:45:50,211 --> 01:45:51,230
If you guys are up for it,

3657
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:52,520
you gotta steal water from Nevada?

3658
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:53,000
Yeah,

3659
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:53,840
I got a truck.

3660
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:54,973
It's pretty big.

3661
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:57,110
I thought we could get
some jugs and whatnot.

3662
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:57,321
Now.

3663
01:45:57,321 --> 01:45:59,240
I haven't thought this
plan out the whole way.

3664
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:00,770
How good is this lake mead water?

3665
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:01,580
Well,

3666
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:02,600
it's pretty tasty.

3667
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:03,621
It's gotten,

3668
01:46:03,621 --> 01:46:04,940
it's been run through a damn.

3669
01:46:04,941 --> 01:46:05,481
So there's,

3670
01:46:05,481 --> 01:46:05,990
you know,

3671
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:07,370
filter with a big Britta.

3672
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,233
Exactly.

3673
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,760
I don't think there's
any impurities is in,

3674
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:11,900
put it in a bong,

3675
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:12,680
whatever.

3676
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:13,550
Isn't it low?

3677
01:46:13,690 --> 01:46:15,620
Is in lake mead low as well.

3678
01:46:15,621 --> 01:46:17,660
I feel like that was
something that was a concern.

3679
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:18,330
Oh yeah,

3680
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:19,510
I would presume reservoirs.

3681
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:20,301
It's terrible.

3682
01:46:20,301 --> 01:46:21,680
This is the worst one I remember.

3683
01:46:21,890 --> 01:46:23,660
I don't know if you lived in
California your whole life,

3684
01:46:23,690 --> 01:46:24,401
are you from company?

3685
01:46:24,401 --> 01:46:25,191
Oh No.

3686
01:46:25,191 --> 01:46:27,000
I moved here in 94 where are you from?

3687
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,250
I grew up mostly in Boston,

3688
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:29,600
Boston,

3689
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:30,620
born in New Jersey.

3690
01:46:30,621 --> 01:46:33,560
I've lived out here from age seven
to 11 though in San Francisco.

3691
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:34,820
Oh yeah.

3692
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:39,530
Well we're not in the seven late seventies
there was a huge shock and that one

3693
01:46:39,531 --> 01:46:42,200
was the first one that I
remember really getting serious.

3694
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:42,410
Yeah,

3695
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:43,130
I was here for that,

3696
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:43,730
I believe.

3697
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,160
I think that was like 78 or something.

3698
01:46:45,161 --> 01:46:45,410
Right?

3699
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:47,060
Lake mead may hit record low.

3700
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:47,923
Can you believe this?

3701
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:49,060
So look at the shoreline.

3702
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:50,310
My God.

3703
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:51,241
Yeah,

3704
01:46:51,241 --> 01:46:52,074
the shoreline.

3705
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:53,760
The marina is going to be dirt.

3706
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:54,691
Well,

3707
01:46:54,691 --> 01:46:57,390
that's how lake or Travis is in Austin.

3708
01:46:57,420 --> 01:46:58,253
I've seen that.

3709
01:46:58,800 --> 01:46:59,760
That's terrifying.

3710
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:01,410
Lake Travis is way worse.

3711
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:03,780
Pull up pictures of Lake Travis in Austin,

3712
01:47:03,781 --> 01:47:08,781
Texas because some folks bought these
multimillion dollar gorgeous estates on

3713
01:47:09,271 --> 01:47:10,920
the water of this amazing leg,

3714
01:47:10,921 --> 01:47:11,161
and I'm like,

3715
01:47:11,161 --> 01:47:11,760
honey,

3716
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,380
we are living the fucking dream.

3717
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:15,750
We have a house on the lake.

3718
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:16,661
Look at this.

3719
01:47:16,661 --> 01:47:17,290
It's incredible.

3720
01:47:17,290 --> 01:47:18,340
You go out your back door,

3721
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,380
you have a cocktail,

3722
01:47:19,381 --> 01:47:20,214
you hear the fucking,

3723
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:21,090
the frogs,

3724
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:21,521
cricket,

3725
01:47:21,521 --> 01:47:21,761
cricket,

3726
01:47:21,761 --> 01:47:22,594
cricket kick,

3727
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:23,071
and you're like,

3728
01:47:23,071 --> 01:47:23,821
we live on the lake.

3729
01:47:23,821 --> 01:47:24,870
This is amazing.

3730
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,810
Well then the lake is 200 yards away now.

3731
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:29,010
Right?

3732
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:29,340
Right.

3733
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:30,780
I've lost most of your leg.

3734
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:31,160
Yeah.

3735
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:33,540
Have your mode is u boats in the sand?

3736
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:33,930
Yeah.

3737
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:34,890
There's no does not.

3738
01:47:34,891 --> 01:47:36,030
It's not even money anymore.

3739
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,690
Like your boat is laying out.

3740
01:47:39,030 --> 01:47:41,720
How come no one's ever figured
out how to seed clouds?

3741
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:42,630
Dennis,

3742
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:43,290
I know how to do it.

3743
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,500
You get all that water from the fucking
glaciers at the complainant about,

3744
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:47,423
Ooh,

3745
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:48,460
no,

3746
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:48,610
no,

3747
01:47:48,610 --> 01:47:48,701
no,

3748
01:47:48,701 --> 01:47:48,791
no,

3749
01:47:48,791 --> 01:47:48,901
no.

3750
01:47:48,901 --> 01:47:49,621
You'd get a pipe.

3751
01:47:49,621 --> 01:47:50,460
You put it on the water.

3752
01:47:50,461 --> 01:47:51,300
You take the water back.

3753
01:47:51,301 --> 01:47:52,320
The same that I do with oil.

3754
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:53,333
Look at that.

3755
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:54,290
Ooh,

3756
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:55,170
not insane.

3757
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:55,921
These are photos.

3758
01:47:55,921 --> 01:47:57,720
We're looking at photos
right now of Lake Travis.

3759
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:00,510
We could see people's docs like that.

3760
01:48:00,511 --> 01:48:01,520
See those houses up there.

3761
01:48:01,521 --> 01:48:03,720
But those houses were
like shoreline houses.

3762
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:05,160
Like that's the water level.

3763
01:48:05,170 --> 01:48:06,180
There is nothing left.

3764
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:07,050
Nothing left.

3765
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:08,490
So these houses,

3766
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:13,530
like they had this big back yard and the
backyard looked over this dock and they

3767
01:48:13,531 --> 01:48:17,820
would go out to their boat and
just fucking jet set lifestyle.

3768
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:18,820
Look at me.

3769
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:19,651
You live in Austin,

3770
01:48:19,651 --> 01:48:20,161
Texas,

3771
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:21,720
like I fucking gangster.

3772
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:23,790
And then it all went away.

3773
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:25,860
The water like literally all went away.

3774
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:30,000
It is the craziest thing to look at it
from a satellite photo nor from aerial

3775
01:48:30,001 --> 01:48:32,830
photo rather because you realize where um,

3776
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:33,070
the,

3777
01:48:33,070 --> 01:48:34,470
the shore used to be,

3778
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,730
there's some pretty distinct,

3779
01:48:35,910 --> 01:48:36,690
uh,

3780
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:40,050
versus like that see that it looks
like a river that used to all be blue.

3781
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:44,700
That whole thing was blue and they're
letting that motherfucker dry out because

3782
01:48:44,701 --> 01:48:44,911
a,

3783
01:48:44,911 --> 01:48:46,140
they pump water in the lake.

3784
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:48,540
Austin Lake Austin is still full.

3785
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:51,030
I think they get their water
from the Colorado or something.

3786
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:52,283
The Missouri maybe.

3787
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:53,580
What do I know?

3788
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:53,881
What am I?

3789
01:48:53,881 --> 01:48:54,714
Lake expert.

3790
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:57,630
But the point is they
get their water and they,

3791
01:48:57,631 --> 01:49:01,680
they still make sure that
Lake Austin gets water,

3792
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:03,420
but they don't do it to Lake Travis.

3793
01:49:03,421 --> 01:49:03,751
And they're like,

3794
01:49:03,751 --> 01:49:04,584
fuck it,

3795
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:06,780
we've got to pick a pick a winner.

3796
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:07,883
And you ain't it.

3797
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:10,890
Look at that house in the
lower right hand side.

3798
01:49:10,891 --> 01:49:11,161
Jamie.

3799
01:49:11,161 --> 01:49:11,320
Look,

3800
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:12,390
these people just sitting there.

3801
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:13,021
Oh my God,

3802
01:49:13,021 --> 01:49:13,560
that's insane.

3803
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:14,880
What's left of the lake?

3804
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:16,710
There was one in the
lower right hand side,

3805
01:49:16,711 --> 01:49:17,010
January.

3806
01:49:17,010 --> 01:49:19,410
You could see this big
mansion that had a backyard.

3807
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:22,140
If you were before you
clicked on that one.

3808
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:22,351
Yeah,

3809
01:49:22,351 --> 01:49:22,860
right there.

3810
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:23,520
Click on that one.

3811
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:24,001
Look at that.

3812
01:49:24,001 --> 01:49:24,990
Oh my God.

3813
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:30,290
This guy used to be able to go out his
back door and just fucking him and fish

3814
01:49:30,931 --> 01:49:32,100
and do whatever he wanted to.

3815
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:32,531
God,

3816
01:49:32,531 --> 01:49:33,600
it must have been amazing.

3817
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:38,010
Look at that house is bad ass
house power line above his house.

3818
01:49:38,011 --> 01:49:38,600
Gonna kill him though.

3819
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:39,420
I was eight.

3820
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:40,980
He built it underneath the uh,

3821
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,630
the tower there.

3822
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:44,340
He might be a ham radio operator.

3823
01:49:44,341 --> 01:49:45,510
He might be one of those art bell.

3824
01:49:45,511 --> 01:49:45,661
My,

3825
01:49:45,661 --> 01:49:46,640
my wife and I,

3826
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:51,130
my wife and I went and looked at house
a while ago and one in La and it was in

3827
01:49:51,131 --> 01:49:51,640
it,

3828
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:51,881
you know,

3829
01:49:51,881 --> 01:49:54,040
it was it a cool neighborhood
on the east side and whatnot.

3830
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:57,820
And we get there and of course no one has
shown you in the pictures on Reddit or

3831
01:49:57,821 --> 01:49:58,654
whatever.

3832
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:00,470
Or we're not rented a zoo.

3833
01:50:00,730 --> 01:50:03,640
I don't know what this Ilo or whatever
the fuck goes to real estate site.

3834
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:04,863
Uh,

3835
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:06,940
one of those electrical towers,

3836
01:50:06,941 --> 01:50:08,980
like right in front of it on the street.

3837
01:50:09,070 --> 01:50:09,730
Fuck that.

3838
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:10,563
And you're like,

3839
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:14,870
that's a little close for me to look
at every day to be under Donald B.

3840
01:50:14,870 --> 01:50:14,871
Dot.

3841
01:50:14,871 --> 01:50:15,880
I don't think that's healthy.

3842
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:16,813
I can't be,

3843
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:18,460
I think there's like actually,

3844
01:50:18,850 --> 01:50:19,571
although my hair,

3845
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:19,990
oh shit.

3846
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:21,400
Then I'd have she here all the time.

3847
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:21,631
Yeah.

3848
01:50:21,631 --> 01:50:22,091
It would just be,

3849
01:50:22,091 --> 01:50:22,924
yeah,

3850
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:24,550
I'd be a young Einstein with them.

3851
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:27,310
I had to try to watch TV and you
hear the sound of that thing.

3852
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:31,420
It's a weird sound.

3853
01:50:31,421 --> 01:50:31,810
Those things.

3854
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:35,860
Have you ever walked by like a real
big one of those real big towers?

3855
01:50:35,861 --> 01:50:38,370
Like you can actually kind of hear
the electricity when you get close.

3856
01:50:38,371 --> 01:50:38,900
Yeah.

3857
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,720
That freaks me the fuck out man.

3858
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:44,260
Especially people that live underneath
those because there's a couple in Burbank

3859
01:50:44,261 --> 01:50:45,670
where it's like that you were a,

3860
01:50:45,671 --> 01:50:49,810
you park your car on that street and you
just hear that home and the sizzle and

3861
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:51,550
you live right underneath that.

3862
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:52,440
I can't be grid.

3863
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,850
He look out your window and you
see your lights like just glow,

3864
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:55,684
a little

3865
01:50:58,310 --> 01:50:58,971
brake lights,

3866
01:50:58,971 --> 01:51:01,060
just a little glow and
dimmed out little glow.

3867
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:01,600
We,

3868
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:05,110
we better get those trees for every
one of our outlets so we don't have the

3869
01:51:05,111 --> 01:51:06,280
surge man.

3870
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:06,791
Well,

3871
01:51:06,791 --> 01:51:11,440
what's crazy is the Tesla a long fucking
time ago when he was in that battle

3872
01:51:11,441 --> 01:51:12,280
with Westinghouse,

3873
01:51:12,730 --> 01:51:16,180
Tesla wanted to make electricity
available to everyone.

3874
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:17,320
Like radio.

3875
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:17,950
Yeah.

3876
01:51:17,950 --> 01:51:22,000
Somehow or another you'd be pulling
your electricity out of the air and he

3877
01:51:22,001 --> 01:51:26,380
developed some kind of a
projection method of electricity.

3878
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:30,700
So instead of these towers with
wires that you could monitor how much

3879
01:51:30,701 --> 01:51:32,950
electricity is going back and forth
and that's how they charge you.

3880
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:34,030
Instead of that,

3881
01:51:34,030 --> 01:51:35,560
he was just going to
make everything for free.

3882
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:36,461
Just little dots.

3883
01:51:36,461 --> 01:51:38,560
Why he was shut down so hard of course.

3884
01:51:38,561 --> 01:51:39,251
But yeah,

3885
01:51:39,251 --> 01:51:41,410
that's is a tower of power.

3886
01:51:42,490 --> 01:51:43,840
I don't know what they actually called it,

3887
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:44,703
but that's what it says.

3888
01:51:45,670 --> 01:51:46,870
That's not really what it's called.

3889
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:47,711
But look at that.

3890
01:51:47,711 --> 01:51:47,981
Yeah.

3891
01:51:47,981 --> 01:51:50,110
Warden Clive Tower.

3892
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:51,293
That's what it was.

3893
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:52,960
That was his idea.

3894
01:51:52,961 --> 01:51:53,830
I mean what?

3895
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:54,460
Wow.

3896
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:56,050
How weird is that?

3897
01:51:56,051 --> 01:51:56,884
Good for you though.

3898
01:51:57,460 --> 01:52:01,900
That they know about the cell phone towers
to go everywhere that it looked like

3899
01:52:01,901 --> 01:52:02,820
palm trees and shit.

3900
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:03,940
Those aren't good for you either.

3901
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:04,600
Can't be.

3902
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:07,210
Well I think those are not that bad
though because I think those are just

3903
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,073
receivers.

3904
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:09,190
No,

3905
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:10,090
there must not be received.

3906
01:52:10,091 --> 01:52:13,150
What about all the phones we used in
the 90s that were this big and when you

3907
01:52:13,151 --> 01:52:14,170
held them up for half an hour,

3908
01:52:14,171 --> 01:52:15,280
your teeth started to ache.

3909
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:17,920
Surely that was one good for us.

3910
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:18,311
Well,

3911
01:52:18,311 --> 01:52:20,260
he wasn't a biology major.

3912
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:21,041
You know,

3913
01:52:21,041 --> 01:52:23,680
Tesla was a guy who was
interested in electrics,

3914
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:27,250
electronics and thinking things
through and figuring out machines.

3915
01:52:27,251 --> 01:52:29,920
But biologically he was pretty fucked up.

3916
01:52:30,130 --> 01:52:31,330
He was in love with a pigeon.

3917
01:52:31,390 --> 01:52:32,080
Was He really?

3918
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:32,321
Yeah,

3919
01:52:32,321 --> 01:52:33,660
he said I didn't know
anything about his personal,

3920
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:34,310
other pigeon.

3921
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:35,143
Yeah.

3922
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:36,700
He like had a love affair.

3923
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:39,970
Like he would talk about this pigeon,

3924
01:52:39,971 --> 01:52:43,780
like it was a woman that he loved and
he also had some sort of a strange

3925
01:52:43,781 --> 01:52:44,980
relationship with a woman.

3926
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:45,800
Again,

3927
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,030
like she prefaced this by saying,

3928
01:52:47,031 --> 01:52:48,170
I got this from documentary.

3929
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:49,670
It could be totally bullshit,

3930
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:50,541
but uh,

3931
01:52:50,541 --> 01:52:52,400
and I haven't seen
anything about it since,

3932
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:55,550
but that he wrote
something about destroying,

3933
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:57,260
impose his sexuality.

3934
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:00,590
Like he had been in some sort of an
affair with some woman and it was so

3935
01:53:00,591 --> 01:53:04,220
distracting and crazy that he
might've decided to get castrated.

3936
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:04,910
Wow.

3937
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:05,630
Yeah.

3938
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:06,620
It'd be like a,

3939
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:09,380
remember that term
destroying his sexuality.

3940
01:53:09,381 --> 01:53:10,460
I don't remember what the fuck the,

3941
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:13,610
now I'm going to have to
read them out to me too.

3942
01:53:13,670 --> 01:53:14,400
God Damn it.

3943
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:14,610
Oh,

3944
01:53:14,610 --> 01:53:14,800
I know.

3945
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,150
Tesla and then,

3946
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:16,970
uh,

3947
01:53:16,970 --> 01:53:20,930
Edison fought tooth and nail
and medicine beat his ass.

3948
01:53:20,931 --> 01:53:21,500
Basic girl.

3949
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,880
I Westinghouse's she's saying.

3950
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:23,360
Yeah.

3951
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:26,060
Well he also benefited
greatly from knowing Tesla.

3952
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:26,923
Didn't he want,

3953
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:27,680
uh,

3954
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:28,580
alternating current?

3955
01:53:28,581 --> 01:53:28,691
He,

3956
01:53:28,691 --> 01:53:29,960
he's the reason why we have all,

3957
01:53:29,961 --> 01:53:30,800
if you wanted direct,

3958
01:53:30,801 --> 01:53:35,210
current Tesla wanted alternate and
Edison had the bright idea that direct

3959
01:53:35,211 --> 01:53:35,421
current,

3960
01:53:35,421 --> 01:53:36,230
what's going to be better?

3961
01:53:36,230 --> 01:53:36,351
Well,

3962
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:38,600
you remember he used
that fucking elephant.

3963
01:53:38,601 --> 01:53:40,820
They electrocuted an
elephant to prove a point.

3964
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:42,650
Like Edison was such a Douche bag.

3965
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,960
He killed an elephant on film.

3966
01:53:44,990 --> 01:53:45,470
Yeah.

3967
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:46,970
Just so that everybody
would think that uh,

3968
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:48,620
alternating current was dangerous.

3969
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:52,220
How about just don't electrocute
anybody with anything direct.

3970
01:53:52,221 --> 01:53:52,701
Current,

3971
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:53,840
alternating current.

3972
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:55,900
They'd cook the shit out of that elephant.

3973
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:59,210
They did it in like a
big public plates too,

3974
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:00,950
which is not that long ago.

3975
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:01,491
Oh No,

3976
01:54:01,491 --> 01:54:01,731
no,

3977
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:02,001
no.

3978
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:02,721
Think about that.

3979
01:54:02,721 --> 01:54:03,650
These days cook,

3980
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:08,510
they cooked an elephant on TV in front
of everybody to for no reason other than

3981
01:54:08,511 --> 01:54:13,511
to show that their competitors method
of delivering electricity was inferior.

3982
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,230
Is this the video?

3983
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:16,071
Oh,

3984
01:54:16,071 --> 01:54:17,240
this is fucked up to watch,

3985
01:54:17,241 --> 01:54:17,900
man.

3986
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:19,340
I have a thing about elephants,

3987
01:54:19,341 --> 01:54:20,150
man.

3988
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:20,960
Elephants are,

3989
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,490
they seem to be really smart.

3990
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:23,331
Topsy.

3991
01:54:23,331 --> 01:54:23,691
They are.

3992
01:54:23,691 --> 01:54:24,560
They're really sensitive.

3993
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:25,250
Yeah.

3994
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:28,880
They seem to be really smart and they
do have memories and they trust us.

3995
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:29,751
And then,

3996
01:54:29,751 --> 01:54:30,021
you know,

3997
01:54:30,021 --> 01:54:31,970
you take this elephant and you lead it.

3998
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:33,700
No,

3999
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:34,533
it's just awful.

4000
01:54:34,630 --> 01:54:34,841
I mean,

4001
01:54:34,841 --> 01:54:37,930
it's one thing if you've got an elephant
that's storming through villages and

4002
01:54:37,931 --> 01:54:39,910
stomping the shit out of
people and killing them,

4003
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:41,110
but then you've got to wonder,

4004
01:54:41,111 --> 01:54:41,261
well,

4005
01:54:41,261 --> 01:54:42,550
what the fuck makes that elephant?

4006
01:54:42,551 --> 01:54:43,031
So Matt,

4007
01:54:43,031 --> 01:54:46,180
so here they hit it with the
electricity is so fucked up,

4008
01:54:46,181 --> 01:54:46,391
man.

4009
01:54:46,391 --> 01:54:47,920
They cook the shit out of this elephant.

4010
01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:51,190
It's standing there and they're
just pumping it through them.

4011
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,250
He wants to get free too.

4012
01:54:55,590 --> 01:54:56,400
Yeah,

4013
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,350
it's really hardcore.

4014
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:57,601
When you,

4015
01:54:57,601 --> 01:54:58,530
when you see it come on,

4016
01:54:58,531 --> 01:54:58,651
like,

4017
01:54:58,651 --> 01:54:59,371
here it is right there.

4018
01:54:59,371 --> 01:55:00,204
Bam.

4019
01:55:00,210 --> 01:55:01,620
You could see that he starts smoking.

4020
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:02,603
Oh God.

4021
01:55:02,820 --> 01:55:03,240
Terrible.

4022
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:04,410
It's so fucked up.

4023
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:07,410
And he just falls over
completely dead and stiff.

4024
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:08,273
It's so nuts.

4025
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:11,910
But that was such a new thing.

4026
01:55:11,911 --> 01:55:13,150
6,006 years,

4027
01:55:13,151 --> 01:55:14,040
not volts.

4028
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:16,340
Uh,

4029
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:19,650
does it say no,

4030
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,130
no,

4031
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:21,300
no.

4032
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:21,900
Three,

4033
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:22,520
three.

4034
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:22,880
Whoa.

4035
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:23,640
1903,

4036
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:24,473
12 years.

4037
01:55:25,150 --> 01:55:25,870
Wow.

4038
01:55:25,870 --> 01:55:26,010
Oh,

4039
01:55:26,010 --> 01:55:26,671
not that long.

4040
01:55:26,671 --> 01:55:28,290
Door over years is nothing.

4041
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:29,220
That's nothing.

4042
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:31,690
I wonder what they did with the alpha.

4043
01:55:31,691 --> 01:55:31,931
I don't want,

4044
01:55:31,931 --> 01:55:33,180
if they ate it and cooked it,

4045
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:34,073
oh,

4046
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:35,570
you know what?

4047
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:36,403
I mean,

4048
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:38,060
it's that Coney island,

4049
01:55:38,061 --> 01:55:40,650
they'd probably just slice it
open and had burgers and the,

4050
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:41,750
I don't think they did anything with it.

4051
01:55:41,751 --> 01:55:42,860
I bet they buried it somewhere.

4052
01:55:42,861 --> 01:55:43,050
I don't know.

4053
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:44,760
But they wouldn't even think
about eating an elephant,

4054
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:46,200
which is kind of fucked up.

4055
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:50,460
This is the only saving grace to those
people that hunt those elephants and

4056
01:55:50,461 --> 01:55:51,470
other countries is the,

4057
01:55:51,471 --> 01:55:51,810
the,

4058
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:52,980
the villagers who are,

4059
01:55:52,981 --> 01:55:54,630
most of them have no meat at all.

4060
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:56,670
They get to eat that elephant meat.

4061
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:58,613
That's it.

4062
01:55:58,890 --> 01:55:59,371
Other than that,

4063
01:55:59,371 --> 01:55:59,470
you,

4064
01:55:59,470 --> 01:55:59,820
Caroline,

4065
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:02,670
elephant and elephant seem to be,

4066
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:04,560
they don't just seem to be smart.

4067
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:07,420
They seem to be like these
like intense social creatures.

4068
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:08,693
They pair up,

4069
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:09,110
they,

4070
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:10,710
they recognize each other after,

4071
01:56:10,711 --> 01:56:12,210
I hadn't seen each other in decades.

4072
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:14,580
This is crazy video of this.

4073
01:56:14,850 --> 01:56:18,330
I think it's a mother and a
son or something like that
and they hadn't seen each

4074
01:56:18,331 --> 01:56:22,080
other in forever and the two elephants
each other and they run to each other and

4075
01:56:22,081 --> 01:56:22,351
they like,

4076
01:56:22,351 --> 01:56:25,920
they hadn't seen each other in decades
and they immediately recognized each

4077
01:56:25,921 --> 01:56:26,370
other.

4078
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:30,060
They have six extraordinary
memories and they can smell water.

4079
01:56:30,710 --> 01:56:31,440
Wow.

4080
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:32,480
That's why when they're,

4081
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:35,820
when they roam far and wide during
the drought season or whatever,

4082
01:56:35,821 --> 01:56:38,220
they can smell it and they
can dig underneath and went,

4083
01:56:38,221 --> 01:56:39,240
Whoa,

4084
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:40,470
that's insane.

4085
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:41,730
They're highly,

4086
01:56:42,230 --> 01:56:43,080
and what are those?

4087
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:43,500
Those,

4088
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:44,201
those horn,

4089
01:56:44,201 --> 01:56:45,510
the tusks are for fighting.

4090
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:45,901
Right.

4091
01:56:45,901 --> 01:56:50,901
They crash into each other and Duke it
out with those tusks to keep them for

4092
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:51,751
life,

4093
01:56:51,751 --> 01:56:52,890
which is unusual too.

4094
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:54,330
And they don't ever lose them.

4095
01:56:54,331 --> 01:56:55,500
They don't share that shed them.

4096
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:56,700
Yeah.

4097
01:56:56,700 --> 01:57:01,140
Which would save a lot of fucking death
because then the elephants shed their

4098
01:57:01,141 --> 01:57:01,440
test.

4099
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,970
If they did show him all the time,

4100
01:57:02,971 --> 01:57:05,910
people would want them every year they
would want to keep my life cause an

4101
01:57:05,911 --> 01:57:07,860
elephant alive would be worth way more.

4102
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:10,020
And you just get the sheds.

4103
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:11,520
You don't have to saw it off.

4104
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:12,900
Just let them fall off.

4105
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:14,460
And you could have like,

4106
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:16,620
like when they have deer sheds,

4107
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:19,050
like if you go to a forest,

4108
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:19,411
uh,

4109
01:57:19,411 --> 01:57:19,951
anytime,

4110
01:57:19,951 --> 01:57:22,670
like near the spring when
dear start losing their,

4111
01:57:22,671 --> 01:57:23,504
their antlers,

4112
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:24,810
you just find them and pick them up.

4113
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:25,170
Yeah.

4114
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:26,003
Nobody got hurt.

4115
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:27,810
And you can take them and people use them.

4116
01:57:27,811 --> 01:57:28,770
They make jewelry with them.

4117
01:57:28,771 --> 01:57:30,450
And Shit and they do all kinds
of different things with them,

4118
01:57:30,630 --> 01:57:35,190
but it's this hard bony fucking
factory that grows in a year.

4119
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:39,450
So if you see like a Mousse and they
have this enormous fucking paddle,

4120
01:57:39,570 --> 01:57:40,950
these paddles in the side of their head,

4121
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:42,253
I mean their shoe,

4122
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:43,950
they grew that,

4123
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:46,650
this fee here and they're going
to grow a new one next year,

4124
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:47,371
every year,

4125
01:57:47,371 --> 01:57:48,300
and they go in that bag.

4126
01:57:48,330 --> 01:57:48,780
Yup.

4127
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:49,380
Wow.

4128
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,213
Yeah,

4129
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:53,190
like the size of a door.

4130
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:53,940
Oh yeah.

4131
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:56,100
That door to this room is not purpose.

4132
01:57:57,010 --> 01:57:57,240
No,

4133
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:57,630
no,

4134
01:57:57,630 --> 01:57:57,930
they're,

4135
01:57:57,930 --> 01:57:58,470
they're not.

4136
01:57:58,470 --> 01:58:03,240
They're huge animals and they grow that
entire thing over the course of like a

4137
01:58:03,241 --> 01:58:04,110
month or so.

4138
01:58:04,650 --> 01:58:07,500
It just grows out of their
fucking head and it didn't.

4139
01:58:07,501 --> 01:58:09,820
Next year it'll be bigger
and next year it'll be big.

4140
01:58:09,990 --> 01:58:10,970
Like this Moose right here,

4141
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:12,001
this is a moose.

4142
01:58:12,001 --> 01:58:13,560
It is a small antlers.

4143
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:14,880
This is like a young Moose.

4144
01:58:14,881 --> 01:58:18,660
It's only like a few years old and
when they get like six and seven,

4145
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:22,650
then I have these bigger and bigger and
bigger because as they get older and

4146
01:58:22,651 --> 01:58:26,550
they get larger and more dominant
because they continued to eat,

4147
01:58:26,551 --> 01:58:30,290
their horns actually get their antlers
actually get bigger so they can shell

4148
01:58:30,291 --> 01:58:30,840
pitch.

4149
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:31,673
I been over there

4150
01:58:33,170 --> 01:58:35,040
fucking tired and they come at,

4151
01:58:35,070 --> 01:58:35,540
you know,

4152
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:38,920
this huge like that's the thing that
scares off the other males like okay this

4153
01:58:38,921 --> 01:58:39,210
is mother.

4154
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:39,430
Yeah,

4155
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:40,263
yeah,

4156
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:41,633
yeah.

4157
01:58:41,670 --> 01:58:42,530
And that bizarre.

4158
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:43,210
Yeah,

4159
01:58:43,210 --> 01:58:43,930
that's fantastic.

4160
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:45,610
Elephants were like that man.

4161
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,630
There'll be so valuable
endangered if Moose,

4162
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,730
if Moose antlers were valuable,

4163
01:58:51,731 --> 01:58:52,990
the way elephant tusks were,

4164
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:55,540
Moose would probably be mostly
wiped off the face of the earth,

4165
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:59,560
but instead they're valued
as like a renewable resource
cause it's more valuable

4166
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:02,830
to keep the Moose alive so that they
have more moose as he can eat them,

4167
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:05,690
then just kill them all and
cut off their fucking atlas.

4168
01:59:05,691 --> 01:59:06,520
Yeah.

4169
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,230
It's sad as shit,

4170
01:59:08,231 --> 01:59:08,471
man,

4171
01:59:08,471 --> 01:59:09,370
that seeing that,

4172
01:59:09,371 --> 01:59:09,970
um,

4173
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,950
that rhino that just went extinct.

4174
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:12,803
Yeah.

4175
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:14,050
Essentially extinct.

4176
01:59:14,290 --> 01:59:18,580
I mean there's one male left and two
females and the male won't breed and now

4177
01:59:18,581 --> 01:59:20,520
the female is to uh,

4178
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:23,740
apparently she's the one female is um,

4179
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:26,050
she's too weak to accept
him on top of her.

4180
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:26,440
Right.

4181
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:27,370
Cause you've got to think,

4182
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:27,890
yeah,

4183
01:59:27,890 --> 01:59:28,121
mine,

4184
01:59:28,121 --> 01:59:29,140
those are enormous.

4185
01:59:29,141 --> 01:59:32,230
So he's got to get on top of her to fuck
her and they're basically saying this

4186
01:59:32,231 --> 01:59:32,590
is it.

4187
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:33,910
You're looking at the last three.

4188
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:34,330
Yup.

4189
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:35,400
These rhinos Ph night.

4190
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:40,000
And I think his horn is actually
cut off so that it's not valuable.

4191
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:40,480
Right.

4192
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:41,810
I think there's an image
of that's the other,

4193
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:43,750
there's an image like
the last remaining rhino,

4194
01:59:43,870 --> 01:59:44,650
right.

4195
01:59:44,650 --> 01:59:47,710
They cut their horns off to keep people
from poaching and key people from

4196
01:59:47,711 --> 01:59:48,400
poaching them.

4197
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,630
Flip China.

4198
01:59:49,631 --> 01:59:51,130
Is it that wants to rhino horns.

4199
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:51,851
They want it.

4200
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:53,320
They don't know about Viagara over there.

4201
01:59:53,321 --> 01:59:58,260
They still looking for Tiger
Dick and Rhino Horn dude.

4202
01:59:58,350 --> 01:59:59,980
It's called Cialis.

4203
02:00:00,370 --> 02:00:01,180
You go to the store,

4204
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:02,013
you buy it.

4205
02:00:02,710 --> 02:00:04,090
So what they make it over there.

4206
02:00:04,091 --> 02:00:04,924
It's cheaper.

4207
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:06,020
Look at them.

4208
02:00:06,020 --> 02:00:06,550
Yes.

4209
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:07,750
It's horns hacked off.

4210
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:08,793
That's crazy.

4211
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:11,950
Both of his horns are hacked off
unless they just wore 'em off.

4212
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:12,873
Is that possible?

4213
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:13,361
It is,

4214
02:00:13,361 --> 02:00:16,750
but I think they'd probably cut them off
because there and he's in a preserve.

4215
02:00:16,870 --> 02:00:17,703
Yeah.

4216
02:00:18,710 --> 02:00:19,480
Oh,

4217
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:22,090
the [inaudible] conservancy in Kenya.

4218
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:24,430
What a crazy animal that thing is though.

4219
02:00:24,431 --> 02:00:27,850
What do you think about all the
variation that nature has to offer?

4220
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:32,000
[inaudible] difference between like a
ground squirrel and a rhinoceros and a

4221
02:00:32,001 --> 02:00:34,150
rhino look at that thing.

4222
02:00:34,690 --> 02:00:39,550
There's a famous one they brought to
Europe in the 14 hundreds and juror data

4223
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:40,421
matching of it.

4224
02:00:40,421 --> 02:00:43,030
And it's inaccurate because
he only heard about it,

4225
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:46,060
but it was a very famous painting and it
was a very famous rhino and they turned

4226
02:00:46,061 --> 02:00:47,710
it all around Europe and
then it finally croaked.

4227
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:50,440
But everybody had to see it cause
no one had ever seen one before.

4228
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:52,083
And uh,

4229
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:53,500
I can't remember the name of it.

4230
02:00:53,501 --> 02:00:53,771
I don't know.

4231
02:00:53,771 --> 02:00:55,180
You'd have to look up Meti,

4232
02:00:55,181 --> 02:00:56,890
low rhino or yours.

4233
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:57,370
Rhino.

4234
02:00:57,370 --> 02:00:59,350
They found rhinos in the Congo.

4235
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:04,800
They found rhinos in the actual jungle
and they had only been like a legend

4236
02:01:05,470 --> 02:01:06,160
because they're,

4237
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,390
they're more planes out.

4238
02:01:07,390 --> 02:01:09,430
It's going to say that I thought that
they'd done the belt or whatever,

4239
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:14,460
but what happened was the climate
shifted around the Congo so rapidly that

4240
02:01:15,011 --> 02:01:19,900
plane's be camp became tropical
rain forest all around them.

4241
02:01:19,901 --> 02:01:20,111
Wow.

4242
02:01:20,111 --> 02:01:20,891
That's his sketch.

4243
02:01:20,891 --> 02:01:21,131
Yeah.

4244
02:01:21,131 --> 02:01:22,780
That's a drawing by juror.

4245
02:01:22,781 --> 02:01:23,880
What year is that drawing,

4246
02:01:23,881 --> 02:01:24,700
Janey?

4247
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:25,533
Wow.

4248
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:26,620
1514.

4249
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:27,371
And that,

4250
02:01:27,371 --> 02:01:29,170
that elephant he was told about.

4251
02:01:29,470 --> 02:01:30,161
That's incredible.

4252
02:01:30,161 --> 02:01:31,270
And it toured Europe.

4253
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:32,500
It was a famous elephant.

4254
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:33,420
I mean rhino.

4255
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:33,821
Sorry.

4256
02:01:33,821 --> 02:01:35,290
So he was only told about that.

4257
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:38,380
It's not out anatomically accurate.

4258
02:01:38,410 --> 02:01:38,651
It's,

4259
02:01:38,651 --> 02:01:43,130
he's kind of thrown in like the feed and
the way the scales work and everything.

4260
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:45,980
It's definitely a little different,

4261
02:01:45,981 --> 02:01:46,671
but damn.

4262
02:01:46,671 --> 02:01:47,000
Yeah.

4263
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:47,801
Pretty fucking good.

4264
02:01:47,801 --> 02:01:51,140
This was like a sensation and
the early 15 hundreds in Europe,

4265
02:01:51,141 --> 02:01:52,730
people were like losing their shit over.

4266
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:53,451
What's the other one?

4267
02:01:53,451 --> 02:01:55,380
The yellower one up fucked up top Jamie.

4268
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:56,420
Yeah.

4269
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:57,253
What does that one,

4270
02:01:57,620 --> 02:01:58,880
is that the original version of it?

4271
02:01:59,130 --> 02:01:59,963
Whoa.

4272
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:01,100
I love that shit.

4273
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:05,060
I love looking at like the original
version of a drawing like that.

4274
02:02:05,061 --> 02:02:06,890
The system that see again,

4275
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:07,720
we're talking about,

4276
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:08,210
uh,

4277
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:10,550
his scribbles hit right in his hand.

4278
02:02:10,551 --> 02:02:12,620
Artist's touch his hand,

4279
02:02:12,621 --> 02:02:14,930
write his notes all through
the bottom and a look at that.

4280
02:02:14,931 --> 02:02:18,340
His handwriting and people had
elegant handwriting back then.

4281
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:21,440
Look how much writing he's getting
in at the bottom of that page.

4282
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:26,510
And I don't know what I'm assuming is
riding in German and the 15 hundreds.

4283
02:02:27,180 --> 02:02:28,190
If it's in Latin,

4284
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:30,050
I can tell you he writes the name,

4285
02:02:30,051 --> 02:02:32,950
why Nasir Nasir on right.

4286
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:33,561
That's a lot.

4287
02:02:33,561 --> 02:02:34,550
And it's like a transformer.

4288
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:35,361
Like there's one of them.

4289
02:02:35,361 --> 02:02:35,820
Yeah,

4290
02:02:35,820 --> 02:02:36,440
that sounds good.

4291
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:38,080
Drugs for riding.

4292
02:02:38,130 --> 02:02:38,963
Nassa Ron.

4293
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:42,650
Well this area of the
Congo where the film,

4294
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:43,490
these rhinos,

4295
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:44,330
they had just,

4296
02:02:44,330 --> 02:02:46,730
they'd heard about it from
the locals and they were like,

4297
02:02:46,731 --> 02:02:48,160
what the fuck are they're babbling about?

4298
02:02:48,170 --> 02:02:49,270
There's no rhinos,

4299
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,240
don't live in the jungle.

4300
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:51,291
And then they,

4301
02:02:51,291 --> 02:02:51,411
uh,

4302
02:02:51,411 --> 02:02:55,340
they finally found him and it took a while
before they realized that the climate

4303
02:02:55,341 --> 02:02:56,810
has shifted and this,

4304
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:58,100
these planes,

4305
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:58,581
they,

4306
02:02:58,581 --> 02:03:00,650
the plains animals would just stuck.

4307
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:04,660
Cause like almost immediately
this rain forest is,

4308
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:06,860
grew around them over the course of like,

4309
02:03:06,861 --> 02:03:07,071
you know,

4310
02:03:07,071 --> 02:03:08,880
a few thousand years or
a few hundred years even.

4311
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:10,101
I don't think it was very long.

4312
02:03:10,101 --> 02:03:13,880
I think it was actually 2000 years and
these animals get stuck there and some of

4313
02:03:13,881 --> 02:03:14,810
them adapted.

4314
02:03:15,110 --> 02:03:19,820
One of the really curious had adaptations
was this animal called a Diker.

4315
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:24,970
It's like this little tiny antelope that
can now swim underwater up to a hundred

4316
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:25,520
yards,

4317
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:26,353
goes underwater.

4318
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:27,500
Never had to do that before.

4319
02:03:27,501 --> 02:03:28,740
They used to just run around.

4320
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:29,170
Run.

4321
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:29,440
Yeah.

4322
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:33,530
So now this motherfucker can swim and
the animals can adapt over time and they

4323
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:34,190
eat fish.

4324
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:34,491
Right?

4325
02:03:34,491 --> 02:03:35,450
And what are the rhinos do?

4326
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:36,530
Their jungle rhinos.

4327
02:03:36,531 --> 02:03:37,281
They're jungle rhino.

4328
02:03:37,281 --> 02:03:37,851
So those,

4329
02:03:37,851 --> 02:03:40,130
those you're checking it antelope type.

4330
02:03:40,131 --> 02:03:41,090
Animal eats fish.

4331
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:42,110
Yeah.

4332
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:43,340
Well that's learned behavior,

4333
02:03:43,341 --> 02:03:43,810
right?

4334
02:03:43,810 --> 02:03:44,000
Well,

4335
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,631
most likely,

4336
02:03:44,631 --> 02:03:45,090
but you know,

4337
02:03:45,090 --> 02:03:48,350
they've been finding out
lately is that deer eat birds.

4338
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:49,070
Do you think they,

4339
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:49,910
we didn't know about it.

4340
02:03:49,911 --> 02:03:50,271
Look at that.

4341
02:03:50,271 --> 02:03:51,500
That's a Jesus.

4342
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:52,190
Whoa.

4343
02:03:52,190 --> 02:03:52,641
What's it eating?

4344
02:03:52,641 --> 02:03:53,474
The frog frog.

4345
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:55,250
There's a Diker or eating a frog.

4346
02:03:55,251 --> 02:03:56,084
A little monster.

4347
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:56,531
Hey,

4348
02:03:56,531 --> 02:03:57,710
don't you think of a deer?

4349
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:00,380
You think they're not carnivores?

4350
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:00,561
Well,

4351
02:04:00,561 --> 02:04:03,290
you definitely don't think it's
going to go eat a frog that day.

4352
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:04,580
You got to catch a frog.

4353
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:05,720
You know?

4354
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:06,320
I mean,

4355
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:07,730
frogs don't just let you grab them.

4356
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:09,590
I know you've got to go
after that little fucker.

4357
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:10,700
So I think there's,

4358
02:04:10,701 --> 02:04:11,360
um,

4359
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:12,040
these videos,

4360
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:12,651
we watched some,

4361
02:04:12,651 --> 02:04:17,651
one of the last podcast of a deer eating
birds and people didn't know that they

4362
02:04:17,691 --> 02:04:18,300
did that.

4363
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:18,920
No,

4364
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:21,470
you just now told him he didn't
know until like this year.

4365
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:23,540
Like this is like these
to think that like,

4366
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:24,770
you know these,

4367
02:04:24,890 --> 02:04:26,210
these birds that would die,

4368
02:04:26,211 --> 02:04:29,210
the ground nesting birds or
birds that fall out of trees,

4369
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,550
that they would get eaten
by coyotes and stuff.

4370
02:04:31,551 --> 02:04:33,410
See all those birds coming after the deer.

4371
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:37,380
It's because the deer is eating a bird
and you could see it like really clearly

4372
02:04:37,381 --> 02:04:38,570
as they get close to it.

4373
02:04:38,571 --> 02:04:39,630
The people who were filming this,

4374
02:04:39,631 --> 02:04:41,340
we're trying to figure out
what the fuck was going on.

4375
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:42,990
And then as time went on,

4376
02:04:42,991 --> 02:04:45,900
they realized this deer is following
this bird around trying to bite it,

4377
02:04:45,901 --> 02:04:46,560
see it,

4378
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:47,480
see the Berlin ground.

4379
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:48,593
Yeah.

4380
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:49,690
And so it's,

4381
02:04:49,691 --> 02:04:51,160
it's following it seats,

4382
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:51,811
chasing it.

4383
02:04:51,811 --> 02:04:53,190
And then finally when it gets it,

4384
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:57,180
it bites it and starts fucking up
this bird and it's chewing it alive.

4385
02:04:57,180 --> 02:04:58,200
And it's crazy to watch,

4386
02:04:58,201 --> 02:04:58,680
man.

4387
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:01,980
I mean is it's not just
accidentally stumbling upon this.

4388
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:05,060
It's going after it
cause he keeps stepping,

4389
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:08,670
keep stepping the finally it gets a
hold of the bird and just starts fucking

4390
02:05:08,671 --> 02:05:11,140
that burn up and eating
it and apparently look,

4391
02:05:11,150 --> 02:05:11,983
see it.

4392
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:13,320
Apparently that's what they do.

4393
02:05:13,530 --> 02:05:18,530
They eat birds and we have made them these
benign grass eating gentle creatures.

4394
02:05:19,830 --> 02:05:20,161
No,

4395
02:05:20,161 --> 02:05:23,270
they eat birds all alive.

4396
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:26,130
And while the bird is squirming
and trying to get away,

4397
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:27,930
they give zero fucks.

4398
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:31,710
They have a cold hearted
bird eating demeanor.

4399
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:32,310
Wow.

4400
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:33,690
Who knew that about deers?

4401
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:33,991
Yeah.

4402
02:05:33,991 --> 02:05:34,651
Isn't that crazy?

4403
02:05:34,651 --> 02:05:35,760
There's some really close up.

4404
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:37,043
Oh God.

4405
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:38,730
There's some close up ones.

4406
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:41,010
Is a bird eating duck duck later.

4407
02:05:41,011 --> 02:05:42,450
Let's not birds.

4408
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:43,670
Birds are.

4409
02:05:43,670 --> 02:05:44,280
Fuck.

4410
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:45,360
We could stop anytime you want.

4411
02:05:45,630 --> 02:05:47,280
So let's wrap this bitch up now.

4412
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:47,940
Wrap it up.

4413
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:50,730
The idea is everything you need to
talk about other than the book that is

4414
02:05:50,731 --> 02:05:52,500
fucking amazing and I have a copy of it.

4415
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:53,191
Did you sign a please?

4416
02:05:53,191 --> 02:05:53,851
I'm gunnery right here.

4417
02:05:53,851 --> 02:05:54,331
I'll send it right.

4418
02:05:54,331 --> 02:05:54,901
What's kittens?

4419
02:05:54,901 --> 02:05:55,261
What is this?

4420
02:05:55,261 --> 02:05:56,310
This must be for Brian.

4421
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:57,340
That's my leaving shit.

4422
02:05:57,470 --> 02:05:58,650
I can have it if he wants it.

4423
02:05:58,680 --> 02:05:59,160
It's the,

4424
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:00,270
it's my mascot kittens.

4425
02:06:00,271 --> 02:06:01,950
Mctavish you have a mascot?

4426
02:06:01,980 --> 02:06:02,341
Well,

4427
02:06:02,341 --> 02:06:02,671
kind of.

4428
02:06:02,671 --> 02:06:04,710
It just sort of organically
evolved over the show,

4429
02:06:04,711 --> 02:06:06,030
but I'll keep it.

4430
02:06:06,031 --> 02:06:06,930
That'll be my bookmark.

4431
02:06:06,931 --> 02:06:07,764
And is it a sticker?

4432
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:08,221
It is.

4433
02:06:08,221 --> 02:06:09,570
A stub would put it on my laptop,

4434
02:06:09,571 --> 02:06:11,460
but a lot of times I have
to go to the airport.

4435
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:12,690
I don't want any gay rumors.

4436
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:13,583
You know what I'm saying?

4437
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:14,221
Wow.

4438
02:06:14,221 --> 02:06:16,740
I'm glad that you presumed
that a kitten makes you gay.

4439
02:06:16,741 --> 02:06:17,400
It's not a,

4440
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:18,840
it's not a giant orange cock,

4441
02:06:19,230 --> 02:06:20,063
but if I,

4442
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:21,560
if I wanted to be less kit,

4443
02:06:22,350 --> 02:06:23,790
put it right there and me let me thing.

4444
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:24,893
That's awesome.

4445
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:25,831
See,

4446
02:06:25,831 --> 02:06:26,341
he likes it,

4447
02:06:26,341 --> 02:06:26,630
Brian.

4448
02:06:26,630 --> 02:06:27,840
We'll get his fucking laptop.

4449
02:06:27,841 --> 02:06:29,280
It's covered with pictures of himself.

4450
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:31,440
Black cats on there and shit.

4451
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:33,900
All sorts of stuff on there too.

4452
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:36,120
I have stickers all over.

4453
02:06:36,121 --> 02:06:37,110
Must need more stickers.

4454
02:06:37,111 --> 02:06:37,690
I can't use that.

4455
02:06:37,690 --> 02:06:38,130
Insanity.

4456
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:38,390
Janet.

4457
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:38,841
Fuck.

4458
02:06:38,841 --> 02:06:39,674
Yeah.

4459
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:40,291
And a,

4460
02:06:40,291 --> 02:06:41,280
where can people buy this?

4461
02:06:41,281 --> 02:06:42,114
Greg,

4462
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:43,800
thank you for asking Mr. Joe Hogan.

4463
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:44,431

4464
02:06:44,431 --> 02:06:44,810

4465
02:06:44,810 --> 02:06:44,970

4480
02:07:05,141 --> 02:07:07,380
You can actually be in the
audience for some of those fuckers,

4481
02:07:07,381 --> 02:07:08,010
right?

4482
02:07:08,010 --> 02:07:09,060
How do people get to that?

4483
02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:10,890
You are so right.

4484
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:13,220
They can go on Greg [inaudible]

02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:14,663
uh,

4487
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,680
see I put a heart in it too.

4488
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:16,950
You said,

4489
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:17,210
oh,

4490
02:07:17,210 --> 02:07:18,750
that's a gay rumors swirling.

4491
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:19,141
I like,

4492
02:07:19,141 --> 02:07:19,440
um,

4493
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:19,960
yeah,

4494
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:21,450
I'm going to be in Brooklyn,

4495
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:22,021
uh,

4496
02:07:22,021 --> 02:07:23,910

4497
02:07:23,911 --> 02:07:24,810
I think may,

4498
02:07:25,110 --> 02:07:25,943
May 7th,

4499
02:07:26,130 --> 02:07:28,830
if you go onto [inaudible] dot com
or the live events on the book thing.

4500
02:07:29,010 --> 02:07:30,870
I'm doing a bunch of
podcasts across the country,

4501
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:31,740
New York,

4502
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:32,520
Chicago,

4503
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,310
Philly,

4504
02:07:33,310 --> 02:07:33,421
uh,

4505
02:07:33,421 --> 02:07:33,961
Seattle,

4506
02:07:33,961 --> 02:07:34,680
Portland,

4507
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:35,890
San Los Angeles,

4508
02:07:35,891 --> 02:07:36,581
San Francisco,

4509
02:07:36,581 --> 02:07:38,590
and book events as well
in all those places.

4510
02:07:38,630 --> 02:07:39,640
Boom.

4511
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:40,361
And there you have it,

4512
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:41,110
ladies and gentlemen.

4513
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:41,381
Dude,

4514
02:07:41,381 --> 02:07:41,890
you're awesome.

4515
02:07:41,890 --> 02:07:42,590
Thanks.

4516
02:07:42,590 --> 02:07:43,560
Thanks for having me on jail.

4517
02:07:43,690 --> 02:07:44,523
What?

4518
02:07:44,630 --> 02:07:45,040
Bobby?

4519
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:46,180
We should probably don't gas.

4520
02:07:46,210 --> 02:07:48,240
The shirts were made by this.

4521
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:49,090
These are the,

4522
02:07:49,090 --> 02:07:50,230
these are the astronauts shirts.

4523
02:07:50,231 --> 02:07:51,140
If you guys know what,

4524
02:07:51,141 --> 02:07:51,974
what happened?

4525
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:52,770
There was a,

4526
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:57,770
an astronaut that got in trouble
for wearing these shirts.

4527
02:07:57,910 --> 02:07:58,940
Hung men of the night one.

4528
02:07:58,950 --> 02:07:59,290
Yeah.

4529
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:00,400
We tried to balance it out,

4530
02:08:00,401 --> 02:08:01,780
so she sent us a gay one.

4531
02:08:01,930 --> 02:08:06,010
So a or a female women can wait.

4532
02:08:06,010 --> 02:08:07,480
I guess it would be more female than gay.

4533
02:08:07,481 --> 02:08:07,631
Right?

4534
02:08:07,631 --> 02:08:08,464
It doesn't have to be getting that.

4535
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:09,400
If a woman wore that,

4536
02:08:09,401 --> 02:08:11,260
I would be questioning
her tastes a little bit.

4537
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:14,770
What'd you for real while I'm
questioning Brian's right now,

4538
02:08:14,771 --> 02:08:16,520
but I understand he's just
trying to get in the spirit.

4539
02:08:16,830 --> 02:08:17,950
He's just being silly.

4540
02:08:17,951 --> 02:08:20,810
Goose man trapped in a guy's body.

4541
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:22,300
Something's chapped.

4542
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:23,500
The scientists got in trouble.

4543
02:08:23,501 --> 02:08:26,200
It was actually his friend Ellie that
made these shirts and she sent him to us,

4544
02:08:26,201 --> 02:08:26,790
so thank you Anil.

4545
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:27,430
Their left lane.

4546
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:28,001
Thank you.

4547
02:08:28,001 --> 02:08:29,830
A scientists dude out there.

4548
02:08:29,831 --> 02:08:30,664
Thanks to America.

4549
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:31,811
Thanks to the world.

4550
02:08:31,811 --> 02:08:32,081
Okay.

4551
02:08:32,081 --> 02:08:34,000
I'm not a fucking Zena phobic.

4552
02:08:34,060 --> 02:08:35,110
I like everybody out there.

4553
02:08:35,580 --> 02:08:36,350
Say soon.

4554
02:08:36,350 --> 02:08:37,000
All right,

4555
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:37,833
bye.

4556
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:40,220
Awesome.

4557
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:42,280
That was great.

4558
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:48,020
Okay.
