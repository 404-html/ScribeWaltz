00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:14,841
hello.

6
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:15,920
Sweet pitches.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,850
That's right.

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,380
We're back with the cast

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,051

The composer.

11
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:22,501

The Maestro of kill Tony
Young Tony Hinchcliffe.

13
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:25,400
Thank you.

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,760
Hello.

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,180

Sarah wan Shank and young and beautiful.

18
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,710
Kimberly condom.

19
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,370
Hi there.

20
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,510
Hello everybody.

21
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:33,020
Yeah,

22
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,220
if you guys don't know the show,

23
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:39,221
it's a podcast on the desk squad
podcast network where these two gals

24
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:44,681
courageously for over a year have done a
whole new minute of standup every week,

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,080
which takes fucking mad
testicles that you don't possess.

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,820
It's not courage,

27
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,890
intestinal fortitude.

28
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:55,940
Um,

29
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,110
but my point is you guys,

30
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,340
you guys did something that I don't
think anybody's ever done in that you've

31
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:03,920
documented your entire
standup comedy career.

32
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,280
Right?

33
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,450
Is it true both of you,

34
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,200
all of your sets were on it or did
any of you do sets before that?

35
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,531
I did sets.

36
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:13,040
But you did sets before you did
all of your sets on the show.

37
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,331
Yeah.

38
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,010
My first night at the comedy store,

39
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,520
uh,

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,330
was my,

41
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:16,481
the,

42
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:18,010
my first night going up was on killed.

43
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,450
Tony Dunne is so crazy.

44
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:19,900
Yeah.

45
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,651
That's so crazy.

46
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:22,840
And you've been doing
that for how long now?

47
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:23,501
Uh,

48
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,990
about a year and four months now.

49
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,420
That's every week.

50
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,640
Is that your first time
ever on stage right there?

51
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,553
No,

52
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,861
that's us.

53
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,694
Uh,

54
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,020
a few weeks ago.

55
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:34,790
Is that Sarah Kim?

56
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,311
I can't see.

57
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:35,850
It's all blurry.

58
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,631
It's Sarah.

59
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,730
It's Dave Attell and Jimmy Schubert.

60
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,241
Powerful.

61
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:39,511
Sarah,

62
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:40,344
look at you up there.

63
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,883
Rep Dance.

64
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,681
That's a check.

65
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:44,514
I love those pants.

66
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,760
No girl would ever look at
a picture of herself and go,

67
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:47,041
God,

68
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:47,940
I love those pants.

69
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,231
Or no dude.

70
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:50,520
Rather point being,

71
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,653
um,

72
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,480
if I had to go back and
watch my old standup comedy,

73
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,590
I'd probably throw up,

74
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,940
I'd probably have a heart attack.

75
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,571
I'd probably be like,

76
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:58,111
oh my God,

77
00:01:58,111 --> 00:01:59,370
I'll never be able to do this.

78
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,870
Like I sucked so hard.

79
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,920
I'll never be able to make it.

80
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,551
But you,

81
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:02,910
you,

82
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,980
you fucking ballsy chicks have done,

83
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:05,280
I can't,

84
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,360
I need a better word.

85
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,340
All the luggage.

86
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,320
It's true though,

87
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,090
but it is ballsy.

88
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,870
Whatever it has me.

89
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,060
You guys have fucking
done some crazy shit.

90
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,630
I mean doing that in front of every like
every week doing a whole new minute of

91
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:16,464
standup comedy.

92
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,040
Yeah,

93
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,880
it takes a lot.

94
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,060
It's hard and especially now we're getting
into like over 80 weeks and so you're

95
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,680
like squeezing out every little bit
of anything funny that happened.

96
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,830
Do you go back and like capture your,

97
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:32,770
the stuff he did in the earlier episodes
and tried to turn it into like a longer

98
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:33,260
bit?

99
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:33,530
Yeah.

100
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,410
Well sometimes I'll,

101
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,090
I'll,

102
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,100
I'll listen to the older
ones and I'll be like,

103
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:41,360
what else can I talk about and make new
like tags and I'll just use those tags

104
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,260
as my new joke.

105
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,021
Yeah,

106
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:44,231
no,

107
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:44,531
I too,

108
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,280
I totally get it.

109
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,850
Yeah.

110
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,491
Kill Kill.

111
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:51,491
Tony is a podcast that Tony Hinchcliffe
started with Brian and you guys figured

112
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:57,511
out a really delicious plan and
it's have comics go up for a minute.

113
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,833
Just a minute.

114
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,140
You a minute of standup and then
you have pros just either say,

115
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:02,321
hey,

116
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,131
that was really funny.

117
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:04,780
Like that bullets and bricks guy.

118
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:05,490
We were like,

119
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,010
hey,

120
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,180
fucking good shit dude.

121
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,490
You could really be a calm,

122
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:10,660
I click you're a comic work at
this and you can be a comic.

123
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,681
Or you know,

124
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,430
like some people like,

125
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:12,791
oh my God,

126
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,540
what was this craziness
that I just saw her?

127
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:14,950
Right.

128
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,120
And you get a chance to see like the
professional comics fuck with these people

129
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,170
or you know,

130
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:21,970
get excited about seeing
someone who's funny.

131
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,490
Yeah.

132
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,730
It's like if you hang out in the back of
the original room a lot where you know,

133
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:28,490
normal standup comedy takes
place or any comedy club,

134
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,780
you'll always see a bunch of comedians
in the back either standing around or

135
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:35,390
sitting down and they're always
whispering something in each other's ears.

136
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:38,210
And that I always thought found that
that to be some of the most interesting

137
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:39,080
stuff is getting,

138
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,740
you know,

139
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,521
more pros,

140
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,640
comedian perspective on what's
happening in front of them.

141
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,540
Sometimes they're like,

142
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,950
this person's going to be a star.

143
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,150
And sometimes it's like,

144
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:47,720
wow,

145
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,990
I can't believe this guy didn't
iron his shirt before coming out.

146
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:55,430
And that wide range of conversation that
happens between experience comedians

147
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:58,760
watching newer comedy
is always entertaining.

148
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,540
And I figured,

149
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,540
how do we turn that into a spontaneous
podcast that is refillable so people sign

150
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:07,910
up and there's a big bucket
and people get a new minute.

151
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:10,610
Some people travel from around.

152
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,360
We've had,

153
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,940
we just had somebody on the traveled from
Scotland to do kill Tony for his first

154
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,470
time on stage and so fuck you all right,

155
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,210
Australia every week it's somebody new.

156
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:23,980
So people like literally rather than
doing a bigger set somewhere else,

157
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:27,580
they'll purposefully start on kill Tony
because they listened to that show and

158
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:31,870
that's what made them realize or gave
them the inspiration that they'd like to

159
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,290
at least try to do this thing that
they've always inside one or to do.

160
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:35,891
So.

161
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:40,150
It's really fun getting to give people
that opportunity and have them be excited

162
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:41,500
about it and inspired.

163
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,870
Okay.

164
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,100
It's fun to do too.

165
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,670
I did it with dom Irrera and
we had the fucking best time.

166
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,780
It was so much fun.

167
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,180
And I think that one of the things
that I've been thinking about lately,

168
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:54,680
like because I did my special and I threw
out all my material and I'm starting

169
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:55,610
off with all new material,

170
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:57,950
I have to write a lot and I'm
just like in this like frantic,

171
00:04:57,951 --> 00:04:58,880
frenzied mode.

172
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,691
One of the things,

173
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:00,590
it's really good,

174
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,210
it's like watching other people sort of
like try to piece it together and then

175
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:07,670
talking about like what
was wrong with that?

176
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:08,810
Why didn't that like,

177
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:09,770
what's an in,

178
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,490
in doing that you kind of do some stuff
that you ordinarily probably don't do

179
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:14,720
much with your stand up.

180
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,621
Like a lot of comics,

181
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:16,670
they record their sets,

182
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,380
very few listen to those sets,

183
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,160
right?

184
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,760
Most guys just record them and
then just go fuck that and just,

185
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,770
and just keep going for whatever reason.

186
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,320
But when you're forced
to analyze your stuff,

187
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:28,101
like I did a,

188
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:28,341
you know,

189
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:29,750
Ari has that podcast,

190
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,381
uh,

191
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:33,550
the skeptic tank and every now and then
he'll do an episode with a comic and

192
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:35,900
I'll play a CD and you
have to go over the CD.

193
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,200
And I went over the CD and as I was going
over and I was like thinking about all

194
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:39,621
kinds of things.

195
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:40,371
It was an old CD.

196
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:43,720
I hadn't listened to it and like six
years and as I was listened to us,

197
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,230
like there's like a lot of shit in here.

198
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:46,700
I would do different or nice.

199
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:47,870
See how I did that then,

200
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:48,171
oh Ooh,

201
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:49,220
I used to do that better.

202
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,180
Like I had this bit,

203
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,391
you know,

204
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,850
and you start thinking like
you can actually listen.

205
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,320
If you listen to yourself
from six years ago,

206
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,970
you could actually listen to yourself.

207
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,560
Like as an outsider,

208
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,270
like I know that it's me,

209
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,410
I recognize the voice,

210
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:02,900
but I barely remember the
material cause it's so long ago.

211
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,200
Yeah,

212
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,490
yeah.

213
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,121
About a month ago,

214
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:06,130
buddy came up to me or not even a buddy,

215
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:07,630
it was just a random guy and he goes,

216
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:07,961
man,

217
00:06:07,961 --> 00:06:10,060
I saw you like five or six years ago.

218
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:14,680
You did that one joke about this thing
and I totally forgot that I did it.

219
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,180
Come to completely.

220
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,480
And I got so excited because I hadn't
heard that had anybody on kill Tony or

221
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:23,500
another comedian came
up with this premise,

222
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:24,334
I would have gone,

223
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,050
that's a great premise by the way,

224
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,190
just want to let you know,

225
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,230
I love what you're doing with
the blank and blank thing.

226
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:30,064
You know what I mean?

227
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,240
And I was so excited because it was
like he gave me this gift that was just

228
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:37,210
something that I did anyway that I didn't
remember that I did from five or six

229
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:37,541
years ago.

230
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,230
But that crazy enough is the joke that
he remembered me from this open mic from.

231
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,270
So it was amazing because yeah,

232
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:44,350
the perspective is different.

233
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:48,820
The joke that I do now off that thing
is totally different because I came with

234
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:49,300
uh,

235
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,901
a fresher,

236
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,430
more educated.

237
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,020
I'm more knowledgeable of who I am,

238
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:55,990
so I know how I really want to
do that joke that the fresh me,

239
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,550
Kate wrote the premise for it.

240
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,291
Right,

241
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:58,591
right,

242
00:06:58,591 --> 00:06:58,801
right.

243
00:06:58,801 --> 00:06:59,820
That's interesting though.

244
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,330
Yeah,

245
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,060
that's really cool.

246
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,400
In their house.

247
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,610
I've had that happen a couple of times.

248
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:05,220
When people come to you and they remind
you of a bit and then you're like,

249
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,030
oh shit.

250
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,863
Or sometimes,

251
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,310
you know,

252
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:07,611
I,

253
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:11,250
I listened to probably
half of my recordings,

254
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:12,090
I don't listen to all of them,

255
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:13,020
but I'm pretty diligent.

256
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,630
If I know that I got a
bunch of new stuff out,

257
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:16,464
I'll listen to it.

258
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,450
But every now and then I'll
listen to one and I'll go,

259
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:18,930
oh,

260
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,763
I forgot.

261
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,940
Oh my goodness,

262
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,080
I forgot that part.

263
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,210
And that part like makes
everything way better.

264
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,721
Exactly.

265
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:26,540
Where that part takes
it in another direction.

266
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,100
Yeah.

267
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,120
Every little,

268
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,600
every little thing that you can add on
when once you're already in a topic,

269
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,220
it's a huge gift because it,

270
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,520
not only is it just one show,

271
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,713
but once it,

272
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,690
once it's ingrained in the actual thing,

273
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:45,691
that means thousands and thousands of
people are all going to have that laugh.

274
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,140
Yeah.

275
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,260
I mean every show,

276
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:50,170
once it's part of the thing and
especially it only gets better.

277
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:51,760
So once it's a really working,

278
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:52,621
yeah,

279
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:55,710
they become like little living organisms
and the more you feed them and more

280
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:56,640
attention to give them,

281
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:57,600
the bigger they grow.

282
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,490
And sometimes you have to abandon them.

283
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,330
Like sometimes like,

284
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:00,451
oh,

285
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:01,560
this one's just bad.

286
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,300
It's just that it's down a bad road.

287
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,291
I don't know how to do this.

288
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:04,610
Right.

289
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,690
Like I have bits that
never made it to cds,

290
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,580
never made specials and nick,

291
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,590
sometimes they killed and
sometimes they didn't.

292
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,320
Sometimes it just doesn't know what
the fuck I was doing with them.

293
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,590
Yeah.

294
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,340
You know when you let go,

295
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,270
I don't want to do this anymore.

296
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,760
So just like I'm not married to this
just because I've been doing it.

297
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,200
Like you just got to abandon them.

298
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,620
That's what makes it so crazy
what you girls are doing it.

299
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:22,950
Yeah,

300
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,000
because you guys are going up and you're
doing a fresh minute every week because

301
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:27,360
you don't,

302
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
you don't get like a developmental cycle
when you're putting together a freshman

303
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:31,650
at every week.

304
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,980
You're just hoping that your ideas
are good when you get up there.

305
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,810
I mean you doing your sets like a couple
of days before you do kill Tony or like

306
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:40,410
how many,

307
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,790
when do you write your stuff out?

308
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,170
Oh go ahead.

309
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,240
I write mine all week.

310
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,320
Like I just write down jokes as much as
I can all week and then I try to work

311
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,310
them out before,

312
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,430
but sometimes I just pick one
and then I just build on it.

313
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,650
When on when you go that podcast and
you know that it's live and it's on the

314
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:03,210
Internet and then you're just going up
with this shit that you hope might work,

315
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,160
like what is that feeling like?

316
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,860
It's so scary.

317
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:07,191
Well,

318
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:07,551
Sarah,

319
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:07,641
it's,

320
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:11,270
Sarah does her as a week before and
a lot of the times I write mine,

321
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,680
like the day I'm going in,

322
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:14,240
I write it and you know what most,

323
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,090
a lot of the times when I write mine
the day of are the ones that do really,

324
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:21,380
really well because then I'm not as
nervous and it comes out more natural and

325
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:22,910
that's another thing I've
learned on killed Tony.

326
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:26,660
Just mostly like stage presence is a
huge thing because you have the live

327
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:27,530
audience too,

328
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,101
right?

329
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:28,431
You know,

330
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:31,430
so it's not like you're just
doing a minute on just a podcast.

331
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,380
What do you think that means?

332
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:33,940
Like what does stage presence mean?

333
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,370
Oof.

334
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,500
It's an interesting one in the,

335
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,290
because it means different
things to different people.

336
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:38,561
Right?

337
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:38,940
Like what,

338
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,150
what exactly does that mean

339
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,800
for me?

340
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,750
Just means like looking
confident and calm,

341
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,120
where I don't,

342
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,570
not having the audience being
uncomfortable watching you,

343
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,030
right?

344
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,720
Yeah.

345
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:48,901
Yeah.

346
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:49,734
That's a big one.

347
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,210
That's a bit longer
than you watch someone,

348
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:51,541
you know,

349
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,261
they're nervous up there.

350
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:52,561
You're like,

351
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:53,100
yikes.

352
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,150
Calm down dude.

353
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,570
You know?

354
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:54,950
Yeah.

355
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,110
And that's what's really cool is,

356
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,870
you know,

357
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,130
the,

358
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,030
the live audience watches the show and
they see names being randomly pulled out

359
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:06,680
of a bucket with 20 or 30 comedians
waiting to run from the top and come down

360
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,450
the stairs and be on the show.

361
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:08,730
You know,

362
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,530
they're going from a
viewer to an audience.

363
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,940
They're going from an
audience member to a comedian,

364
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,710
to a podcast guest,

365
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,410
and then thrown back out
in the belly room again.

366
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,760
So they're uh,

367
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,121
you know,

368
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,800
it's also so cool because they,

369
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:26,801
these two always go on at the
end of each show and every time,

370
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,550
especially even this last episode,

371
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:32,210
we just had the last comedian that I
pulled out of the bucket before I knew I

372
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:33,050
was going to that part.

373
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,510
It was an unbelievable interview.

374
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,530
Probably one of the biggest,

375
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:37,700
longest interviews we ever had.

376
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:42,230
We found out that this kid is living in
some big producers house by being half

377
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:43,640
gay and like half,

378
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:46,760
like teasing him with things
and being cute around the house.

379
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,880
But I'm producing sledding and
live in this around the house.

380
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,631
It's unbelievable.

381
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:52,580
This big producers letting
them live in this mansion.

382
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:57,410
We found out all this stuff and
think that nothing can follow that,

383
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,240
but what really does follow it?

384
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,550
And it even surprised me cause I'm like,

385
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:01,851
man,

386
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:03,140
I hope that that,

387
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,750
that it goes how it normally
goes is they come in,

388
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,120
even though that was crushing,

389
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,890
I had to send them off and go,

390
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,281
all right,

391
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:13,460
well this is the part of the show where
our two regulars go up and sure enough,

392
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,800
right when you thought it
couldn't get any better,

393
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,470
they just own it with exactly that thing,

394
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:19,670
which is that comfortable.

395
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:24,671
All of a sudden the audience is seeing
these two assassins who do this every

396
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,700
week and they can feel it.

397
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,400
Not only did they hear me say
it before when I bring them up,

398
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:28,820
but they,

399
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,220
you can really feel it because
if they couldn't feel it,

400
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,110
then they would just go,

401
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:33,381
wow,

402
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:33,980
these two,

403
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,221
you know,

404
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:34,881
I mean the GS,

405
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:35,780
they do this every week,

406
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:36,770
but instead it makes,

407
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,690
it's always the best
way to close the show.

408
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,190
It wasn't always that way,

409
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,024
by the way.

410
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,110
And that's what really the coolest part
is about this whole documentary thing in

411
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:47,570
my opinion is that yeah,

412
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,840
maybe some of the sets weren't
the best of this or that,

413
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:52,040
but they're,

414
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,520
you know,

415
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,680
not only does the audience get to watch
the overall growth for the ones which is

416
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:57,220
the many,

417
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,990
a lot of the diehard fans,

418
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,160
so many of them,

419
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:00,881
you know,

420
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:01,631
talk about that.

421
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:02,321
When they see me,

422
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:07,300
like in Toronto when we just did a theater
a few weeks ago with this show and so

423
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:08,170
many people were like,

424
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:08,560
you know,

425
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,560
getting to watch Kim and Sarah go from
how they were to these monsters that you

426
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:15,010
know,

427
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,010
it's pretty much a guarantee that you're
going to hear a brand new set of jokes

428
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:25,420
that is pretty good and it's going to be
a part of something bigger eventually.

429
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,920
So they get the first look at it,

430
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,263
which is cool.

431
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:28,501
Yeah.

432
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:29,820
Well you guys are doing is like you're,

433
00:12:29,821 --> 00:12:30,990
you're coming up with new shit.

434
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,460
Like that's like the
hardest part of common.

435
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,710
He's coming up with new shit and
you're coming up with new shit.

436
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:37,050
Like as fast as anybody
is like a minute a week.

437
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:38,820
It's about as fast as anybody can do it.

438
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,721
I give you,

439
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:40,860
if you get lucky,

440
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,110
like every now and then you'll
hit like a five minute streak.

441
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,590
Like you got a new chunk and
it's five minutes long ago.

442
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,111
Oh,

443
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:47,310
I hit a gold mine.

444
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,180
You know when you start pulling bits
out of it or pulling taglines and and

445
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,590
premises and sidelines on,

446
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,370
and then you'll have one
that's like fucking 15 seconds
or one that's 20 seconds

447
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:57,204
here like this.

448
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,410
You can't get a minute.

449
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,890
You know?

450
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,970
If you have to get a minute every week
and a minute that you're going to stand

451
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:03,210
by and that's going to be on the Internet.

452
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,601
Oh,

453
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:04,300
good luck.

454
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,590
Yeah.

455
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,920
I think me and Sarah Gotten pretty solid
at knowing exactly what a minute is

456
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:08,400
too.

457
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,900
Maybe we end on with 58

458
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,621
it's crazy too.

459
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:12,790
Now they're the only two.

460
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,750
You know everybody else,

461
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,470
you'll hear the meow of a kitty at 60
seconds to let them know their time's up.

462
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,450
They'll just crushed,

463
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:18,691
crushed,

464
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:18,971
crushed,

465
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:19,201
crushed,

466
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:19,451
crushed,

467
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:19,960
crushed,

468
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,070
crushed and say good night.

469
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:24,010
And I looked down at the lower left
where Brian is the clock and it always is

470
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,530
(575) 085-0960

471
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:27,883
exactly.

472
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,370
I know exactly what a minute is cause I
take Lyft now and they're like you need

473
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:33,950
one minute to get outside and
they'll call me and I'm like,

474
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,540
oh I know I have 20 seconds left.

475
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,620
Like I know a minute.

476
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,120
Does that help at all in bed?

477
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,140
Yeah,

478
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,010
I know exactly.

479
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,960
The dude's like I gave
you 30 minutes of fury,

480
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,600
you're like 33 so it was seven and a half.

481
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:47,911
You're like I know.

482
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,110
Seven and a half minutes.

483
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,810
Yeah.

484
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,810
Well it's also crazy doing like a longer
set afterward like cause I'm so used to

485
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,713
these minutes.

486
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,670
So like going back and like just
everything was just tighter.

487
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,181
Yeah.

488
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:00,901
I was going to ask that.

489
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:02,470
Like what does it like doing like a dude?

490
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:03,720
What's the longest you guys have done?

491
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,150
Like 25 Oh wow.

492
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,230
What about you?

493
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,630
20 and 2025 and both of you have been,

494
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,630
you've been doing it a little over
a year and you've been doing it.

495
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:12,900
How long it close to three.

496
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,913
Close to three years.

497
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,130
So 2025 minutes that you would like you,

498
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:18,420
would you put it on a comedy special?

499
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:20,130
What'd you guys consider
doing a comedy special?

500
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,300
I wouldn't put 25 minutes on a car.

501
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,060
I wouldn't put 20 minutes
on a comedy special.

502
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:24,730
I don't know.

503
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,410
I'm comfortable with 15 minutes.

504
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,310
I like really have a,

505
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,060
I think I have a good 15 that's Brian's
idea actually to release 15 minutes

506
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:31,630
specials.

507
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,290
Yeah.

508
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,040
Like every two months release a 15 minutes
special and then like in like eight

509
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,720
months you'll have a an hour special.

510
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,230
That's true.

511
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,640
Yeah.

512
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,060
And then yeah.

513
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,680
Increments of comedy.

514
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,573
Yeah.

515
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,360
Yeah.

516
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,941
It's not about it.

517
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:44,280
Yeah.

518
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,113
Yeah.

519
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,770
And the other cool thing with their
thing is that they get to be in front of

520
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:50,970
those comedians.

521
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,660
Yeah.

522
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,320
You know,

523
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,520
we've met so many people.

524
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,390
Yeah.

525
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,580
It's so cool to get their perspectives to,

526
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,061
well,

527
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:57,960
the comedy store,

528
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,290
what since I've been gone
has grown like a measurably,

529
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,124
it's amazing.

530
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,750
It's such a different environment there.

531
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,520
Like you guys had always said
it was a different environment.

532
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:06,690
Then I started doing sets there.

533
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:06,991
I was like,

534
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:07,291
Whoa,

535
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,280
this is so different.

536
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,060
Like the new management staff and
the new regime running it there.

537
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:16,440
So on the ball it's like someone figured
out that there's this fucking gold mine

538
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:19,800
on sunset and a professional
management team started handling it.

539
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:20,070
Right.

540
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,000
I mean that's what it's like.

541
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,810
It's like a real comedy club now except,

542
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:25,620
but still like flooded with maniacs.

543
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,320
Yeah,

544
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,801
it's crazy.

545
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:27,461
When I got there,

546
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:31,060
which was right after you weren't
there just slip a couple months after.

547
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,140
Uh,

548
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,600
a lot of those rooms were
dark sitting there dark,

549
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,650
especially little take,

550
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,450
let's take it last night for example,

551
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:40,660
where that main room is just packed to
the gills and their show shows going on

552
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,530
though the belly room would set
dark most nights in the main room,

553
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:49,150
especially with sit completely dark if
it's just this giant 400 and whatever

554
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:53,200
seat room that you'd have to walk through
to go get the ladder to put new names

555
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,290
on the sign or whatever.

556
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,640
Yeah,

557
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,140
and that's what it was known as,

558
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:57,070
like that's what was happening.

559
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:58,030
But now every night,

560
00:15:58,031 --> 00:15:58,630
and there's those,

561
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,640
these cool shows that are coming out.

562
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:02,470
Same thing with roast battle on Tuesdays.

563
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:05,170
Like that shows insane
Tuesday at midnight.

564
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:05,980
That changed.

565
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,350
That changed like 70
people's sleep schedules.

566
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:08,980
Yeah.

567
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,330
People wake up late on
Wednesdays now because of it.

568
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,230
Joe Was the show that brought me back.

569
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,430
I did a,

570
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,730
I went to see that the night before our,

571
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:20,850
he taped a special there and the
camaraderie and the fun in the air.

572
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:21,151
I was like,

573
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:21,721
oh my God,

574
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:22,830
this is like nothing else.

575
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:23,220
Yeah.

576
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,780
This place is like nothing else on earth,

577
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,310
and I just decided like,

578
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:26,460
oh,

579
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,870
why am I not coming here anymore?

580
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:28,740
Like this is a stupid,

581
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,340
yeah.

582
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,750
It just became ridiculous.

583
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:32,310
Like it's really obvious.

584
00:16:32,311 --> 00:16:33,420
It's not the same place.

585
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,210
It's just there's this weird vibe there,

586
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:37,044
this chaos.

587
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,740
They're like,

588
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,270
you're doing a midnight show.

589
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:39,751
Okay.

590
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:43,830
And this place is packed with people
and they're just dissing each other and

591
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:44,700
when they're dissing each other,

592
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:48,810
people are jumping on the
stands and Jeremiah Watkins
and all his buddies there,

593
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,330
they have all these different
antics that they do in between.

594
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,130
It's fucking hilarious.

595
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,211
And why I was there,

596
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:54,571
I was like,

597
00:16:54,571 --> 00:16:54,931
wow,

598
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,160
I can't even believe this.

599
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:57,360
This is really good.

600
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,280
Like what an environment like it,

601
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,290
you could feel like the,

602
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,140
I want to say like the creativity,

603
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:04,420
the,

604
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,310
the realness,

605
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:05,790
the,

606
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,030
you could feel the authenticity of
the comics that were all hanging out.

607
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:09,340
Yeah.

608
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,020
And it's all just for us.

609
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,770
You know what I mean?

610
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,260
It's not like anybody's getting
paid for that or anything.

611
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:16,360
Like we're all just trying
to crack each other up.

612
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:17,530
Everybody's playing their,

613
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,700
their role.

614
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,630
And like you said,

615
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:23,980
when Jeremiah and Shamar
neighbors like on separated,

616
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,330
those two guys are monsters.

617
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:27,580
But when Jeremiah and Joe
Margaret near each other,

618
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:28,840
they tried out do each other.

619
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,730
We always talk about how
they're a modern day,

620
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:31,320
uh,

621
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:31,840
um,

622
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,130
Pryor and gene wilder.

623
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:36,340
Like there's something about when those
two they have to out goofy each other.

624
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:36,641
Right,

625
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:36,941
right,

626
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:37,560
right.

627
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:37,910
But when,

628
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,390
when they're together and they're in
their clothes where they'd been doing

629
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:42,730
comedy together for years being goofballs,

630
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,730
but now they finally have a
field where they can showcase it.

631
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,271
Dude,

632
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:49,090
people forget about
those prior gene wilder.

633
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,130
Okay.

634
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,430
Those movers were God damn
sensational at the time.

635
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,880
They were like the best
like comedy team ever.

636
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,610
And for whatever reason it
doesn't get discussed that much.

637
00:17:59,611 --> 00:17:59,820
Like,

638
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,710
I enjoyed the shit out of those movies.

639
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,150
I don't know how they hold up today.

640
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,260
Have you seen one recently?

641
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:05,094
Yeah,

642
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,113
it's been a long time.

643
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:06,780
Yeah.

644
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,613
I would wonder.

645
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,960
It's sucks when like stuff
that you really liked.

646
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:11,760
Like I watched altered states.

647
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,150
You know that movie altered states about
the guy who turns into a monkey in a

648
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:17,430
sensory deprivation tank is William hurt.

649
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,353
Never saw that.

650
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,460
It was awesome in 1981 in 2014 you
fucking just giggle through it.

651
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:23,731
You're like,

652
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:26,190
what kind of a piece
of shit and my washing,

653
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,840
this is so fucking stupid.

654
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,340
And like I have such great reverence
for Richard Pryor and gene wilder.

655
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:34,830
I would hate to watch something
that they did and not enjoy it.

656
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,750
The new Beverly Cinema Theater right
around the corner from where I live that

657
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,510
Quentin Tarantino owns is actually playing
a two Richard Pryor specials back to

658
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:45,220
back and a double feature when,

659
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,030
um,

660
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,863
it's uh,

661
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,651
I think Friday,

662
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:48,490
December 19th.

663
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:49,060
You can look it up.

664
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,500
New plans send them a.com.

665
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,500
If I'm home,

666
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:52,520
I want to go to that.

667
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:52,940
Yeah,

668
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,773
that sounds right.

669
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,230
Imagine that in a movie theater,

670
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,640
$8 double feature.

671
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:58,500
They do a like $2 popcorn,

672
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,640
$1 sodas.

673
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,260
Why is Quintin Tarantino so cool?

674
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,603
It's unbelievable.

675
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,930
I have a,

676
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,763
I have a theory.

677
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,150
Have you seen him in person?

678
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:06,601
Yes,

679
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:07,590
the size of his hell.

680
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:08,730
I'd never seen him in person,

681
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,564
person,

682
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,021
person,

683
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:10,650
person,

684
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,041
whatever.

685
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,600
He's capturing and movies and stuff.

686
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:17,070
The angle on his head is to make it look
not as big as it is when you see him in

687
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:17,904
real life.

688
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,031
Hey,

689
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:18,331
listen,

690
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:19,130
not disadvantage.

691
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:19,320
No,

692
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm telling you the
reason why he's so cool.

693
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:25,680
It's because he has four times the
brain matter that anybody else does.

694
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:26,790
Do you think that's what it is?

695
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,843
It it.

696
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,820
It cannot be coincidence.

697
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,300
His head is twice as big as
anybody else's in this room.

698
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,770
Like I'm talking like that Joe.

699
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,830
So you think you think there's
just more matter in there?

700
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,920
I just find it hard to believe that
it's coincidence that the guy with the

701
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:45,420
biggest head that I've ever
seen is also the genius.

702
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,230
Yeah.

703
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,460
He's also like a,

704
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:51,480
he morphs into like what
the people that he's around,

705
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,741
if you ever seen that,

706
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,920
like he was on Howard stern show once
and he was interviewed and he was talking

707
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:58,450
one way and then he was
on this all black show.

708
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:58,920
Yeah.

709
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,780
And he was being interviewed and it was,

710
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,500
you were just like,

711
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,333
oh no,

712
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,633
the Ab,

713
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,570
he fucking hammed it up so hard that I
was like holding on my pants pockets.

714
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:10,830
Like cringing like,

715
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:11,161
no,

716
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:11,994
don't do this.

717
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,750
No,

718
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,231
pull it out,

719
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:13,621
pull it out,

720
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:14,510
start talking white again.

721
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,533
Start talking about it again.

722
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,651
But I mean he was like,

723
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:16,951
yeah,

724
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:17,430
so we was,

725
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,330
we was doing this thing,

726
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:18,760
you know,

727
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,171
I mean it's,

728
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:20,730
it's so ridiculous.

729
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:21,564
Like have you seen it?

730
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:21,960
No.

731
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,620
You want to say it?

732
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,220
Yeah,

733
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,053
pull it up Brian,

734
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,530
because it's so ridiculous.

735
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:28,980
I guess we'll watch it on this thing
so we don't get pulled from youtube.

736
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:30,870
Take a shot if you're
playing the drinking game,

737
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,940
podcast pulled from Youtube.

738
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,290
Um,

739
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,100
but,

740
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,730
and again,

741
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,563
all due respect,

742
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,380
Quentin Tarantino,

743
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,060
I don't know the most respect.

744
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,770
Maybe that's what he really talks like.

745
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,720
And you can only be free
around black people.

746
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,681
It's white people.

747
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:43,860
Yes.

748
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,750
To Square it up cause we
just don't understand.

749
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,123
You guys don't get it.

750
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,363
Please.

751
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,830
I just love the fact that
he's so into film too.

752
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:51,101
You know,

753
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:55,570
he was talking about that about like
doing things on actual film and that the

754
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:56,620
look of film,

755
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,840
well that's why he's making the
lineups now at this theater.

756
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,670
Like he's owned the theater for years.

757
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:02,720
That's always been a thing.

758
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:03,111
Like it's like,

759
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:04,730
hey that's Quentin Tarantino's theater.

760
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,340
But a few months ago
he went in and the guy,

761
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:08,960
I guess that ms managing it or whatever,

762
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,720
put it in the new projector and he goes,

763
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:14,470
what's this like state
of the art projector?

764
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,313
And the guy's like,

765
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:15,561
ah,

766
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:16,130
yeah,

767
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,431
cool.

768
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:16,910
Right?

769
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,720
And he's like,

770
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,553
not cool.

771
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,603
You're done.

772
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,720
Goodbye.

773
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,820
I'm making the lineups
now you're out of here.

774
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,170
Something to that effect.

775
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,300
And so he makes the actual,

776
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:30,620
like the movies that play these double
features at his theater now are the

777
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:32,090
movies that he would want to see.

778
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,880
So does he like edit them and splice
them and stuff like that and put them in

779
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:36,391
the reels?

780
00:21:36,391 --> 00:21:36,721
Like it's,

781
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:39,900
is it one of those real to real
things like the old school ones,

782
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,620
he doesn't go reel to reel.

783
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:43,380
He puts a five minute
and then her mission,

784
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:46,540
an old school thing that says
five minute intermission pops up

785
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,680
and then he up the other second reel on.

786
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,160
Right.

787
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,370
Wow,

788
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,570
whoa.

789
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,580
These are all the movies that
inspired him and like you,

790
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,430
there's probably little
things that you know he uses,

791
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:57,750
pays homage to and things.

792
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:02,160
And another cool thing is the previews
before these newbies or the previous that

793
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:06,600
for other of his mood for other movies
that are playing there later that month.

794
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:10,920
So you get to see the cool like
1980 preview for blank and blank,

795
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:12,370
like whatever you get to see.

796
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,780
I saw one when I went to see
unbreakable a couple of weeks ago,

797
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,860
uh,

798
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,730
for this Richard Pryor live and
the Prefuse for Richard Pryor live.

799
00:22:20,731 --> 00:22:22,350
The ones that played are insane.

800
00:22:22,351 --> 00:22:23,790
You would never believe these.

801
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,860
So different than any type of Promo.

802
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,581
What do you mean?

803
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:27,414
Like in what way?

804
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,260
Oh God no.

805
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,570
If that's something you'd
have to see to believe.

806
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:31,520
Like it's just it,

807
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,180
I can't remember exactly,

808
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:34,800
but it's just crazy.

809
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,130
If you look up like the trailer
for a Richard Pryor live,

810
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,480
I think the one for the sunset strip,

811
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:44,370
like I can't remember
exactly what's happening,

812
00:22:44,371 --> 00:22:49,371
but I remember thinking if anybody did
a promo for their special like this was

813
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:50,010
done,

814
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,480
it would be all the talk.

815
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,510
Okay.

816
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:52,931
Okay.

817
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:54,070
I don't know what you mean though.

818
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,900
Like in what way?

819
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,700
Like because every hire you right now.

820
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,070
Yeah.

821
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,810
Here's the Quentin Tarantino talking
like black people collect your thoughts.

822
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:04,644
Tony.

823
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:06,850
No.

824
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,460
For his,

825
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,900
his unconventional style

826
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,600
when it comes to film making one oh six
and please welcome director and Academy

827
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:16,660
Award Winner Quintero

828
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:24,910
that

829
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:28,900
film has to be like one of the most
quoted movies in Hollywood with just the

830
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:29,651
lines and everything.

831
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:30,610
So you got to give us,

832
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:31,500
this is one of my questions for you.

833
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:32,334
Your Cube.

834
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,660
What is the most famous like Yo,

835
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,540
your favorite line from pop fiction?

836
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:37,940
Uh,

837
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,260
I think probably the most famous
line is I'm going to get moody.

838
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:41,601
Baloney.

839
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:42,434
I ass.

840
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,333

841
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,033
Okay.

842
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:52,130
How wasn't too bad or
pleasing the critics for you?

843
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:52,671
Oh,

844
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:53,421
interesting question.

845
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:53,810
Yeah.

846
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,380
Oh,

847
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,213

848
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,790
well I want to,

849
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,240
I want to please my fans.

850
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,760
I don't want to please the
critics that I'm a fans.

851
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,241
Uh,

852
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:02,631
the critics,

853
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:03,464
even my fans,

854
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,303
I don't give a damn.

855
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,733
Wow.

856
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,740
That hurts my liver

857
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,623
doing is,

858
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,490
is fulfilling his vision.

859
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:15,941
You know this,

860
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:17,820
he's a visionary director for us too,

861
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,480
to have the opportunity to work with.

862
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,120
Okay.

863
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,550
Now I'm not that computer savvy,

864
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,220
so be it a sent me something that I plug
into my cheap robot would ever heard.

865
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:28,940
All right.

866
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,731
Download this.

867
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:30,690
I don't know how to do that.

868
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,710
For All I know

869
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,700
he might've been doing a character,

870
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:34,940
mighty said,

871
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:35,201
you know,

872
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:36,970
I hate doing these fucking shows.

873
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:40,210
I'm just going to see how black I
can get before somebody stabs me.

874
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:40,630
Right.

875
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,430
I say it's almost sounds
like he's mocking them.

876
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:42,930
Yeah.

877
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,390
Yeah.

878
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:43,901
Right.

879
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:44,410
Yeah.

880
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,120
I think he's just probably,

881
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,253
you know,

882
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,910
a very unusual dude.

883
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,370
So put it on a cassette tape.

884
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,653

886
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,270
Yeah.

887
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,103
All right.

888
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,490
Goes the bet awards comes
back with Rick Ross.

889
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:01,770
Look at Sandwich Ross.

890
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,800
And that is not the same expression he
has during those capitol one ads anger.

891
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,133
Oh yes,

892
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,020

893
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:12,411

895
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,060
Looking at Jamie.

896
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,040
Jamie Foxx looks high.

897
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:15,290
Okay.

898
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,123
Fuck.

899
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,980
That might've just been froze there,

900
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,300
but he looks high as fuck.

901
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,350

go over to carry with my little tape.

910
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,930
We're going to plant my own biome.

911
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,581
That's it.

912
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,414
The movie.

913
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,553
Any Hamilton,

914
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,600
we don't have beaten this guy.

915
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,610
One unfortunate incident.

916
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,900
It was a few fortunate,

917
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:48,743
isn't it?

918
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,610
A few of them out there this
and he's a beautiful director.

919
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:52,630
I'm happy he's alive.

920
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,880
I love his fucking movies.

921
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,701
I'll tell you that man.

922
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:56,290
That dude make some gangster movies.

923
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,820
His movies are fun as Shit.

924
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,140
If reservoir dogs,

925
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,820
if I'm flipping the
channels and reservoir dogs,

926
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,470
come on.

927
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:01,780
No,

928
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,770
you don't like on cable.

929
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,633
Just randomly.

930
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,780
I get very excited.

931
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:05,110
Yeah.

932
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,610
It's one of those classics we like.

933
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,780
Oh Shit.

934
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,260
Yeah.

935
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,090
That's a God damn classic movie.

936
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,840
Yeah,

937
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,710
pulp fiction.

938
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,730
It's one of the best movies ever.

939
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,630
Totally.

940
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,710
I remember when I went to see it,

941
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,161
I was like,

942
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:15,800
this is I.

943
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,331
It was like,

944
00:26:16,331 --> 00:26:17,620
it was so next level.

945
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,461
I left the theater.

946
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:21,310
I was shaking my head like this
motherfucker just broke movies.

947
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,700
He just figured out to make a movie
where you go back in time and forward in

948
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:27,940
time and you're following it all and
everyone's gets shot in the fucking head

949
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:28,570
and it's like,

950
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,530
whoa.

951
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,180
It was the greatest movie ever.

952
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,680
If I had to pick like one movies,

953
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:33,790
my favorite movie of all time,

954
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:36,220
I think pulp fiction would
be on a very short list.

955
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,083
Definitely.

956
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,283
Yeah,

957
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,500
so goddamn good.

958
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,850
It's nonstop.

959
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,990
I loved kill bills.

960
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:42,860
I love to kill bills.

961
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,050
He it don't,

962
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,950
don't just shit on that guy.

963
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:47,770
Man.

964
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,660
That's a great video though.

965
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,250
I made a few errors in his time.

966
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,080
You seen this video?

967
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,310
No.

968
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:51,661
Play it.

969
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:51,901
Go ahead.

970
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,350
Okay.

971
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,170
This is a him slapping a reporter.

972
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,623
How's it going?

973
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,473
What's going on here?

974
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,923
What's going on?

975
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,130
What's going on here,

976
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,640
but that down.

977
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,473
What's going on here?

978
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,343
What are you doing?

979
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,461
What are you doing?

980
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:04,841
Teachers.

981
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:06,660
You need to talk to me just for,

982
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,120
just for the what are you doing it?

983
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,640
Log into that again.

984
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
Hit me.

985
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,600
She's not just a guy from right

986
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:34,740
now.

987
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,573
I can't do it.

988
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,083
Yeah.

989
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,330
So cool.

990
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:38,451
Yeah.

991
00:27:38,451 --> 00:27:39,284
Cause you're filming.

992
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,090
But if that was off I'd be whooping
your ass up and down this tree.

993
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:42,924
Yeah.

994
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,553
Incident.

995
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,470
You know,

996
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,860
just walking around like

997
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,070
crazy quick.

998
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,921
He's in Russia.

999
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:01,790
Try to buy coffee.

1000
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,810
It's a one of those film fest

1001
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,023
is one of those.

1002
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,310
What the fuck is that?

1003
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,360
It's so weird.

1004
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,070
It's one of those film festivals
that is in the freezing cold.

1005
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,520
That is a weird way to approach it.

1006
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:12,711
Dude.

1007
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:15,050
Like Quentin Tarantino just stick
a fucking camera in his face.

1008
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,343
Yeah,

1009
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,733
nevermind.

1010
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:19,620
Okay.

1011
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,453
His coffee,

1012
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,140
he's a dialogue driven guy.

1013
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:23,790
So when that guy didn't answer his,

1014
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:24,720
what are you filming?

1015
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,400
You watched the switch and he goes,

1016
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:26,540
what?

1017
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,630
He goes from what is this?

1018
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:31,440
And he's still normal to that guy
not answering and his eyes just,

1019
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,660
he loses it.

1020
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,050
Well there's also that weird moment when
like he's trying to play it cool when

1021
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:36,890
the guys go on,

1022
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:37,191
come on.

1023
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:37,790
Go for it was like,

1024
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,270
man,

1025
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:38,840
I don't think,

1026
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,630
cause you could feel the
tension between the two of them.

1027
00:28:41,631 --> 00:28:43,140
They just had a physical altercation,

1028
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,223
altercation,

1029
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,140
but he's still trying to like
maintain like social calmness.

1030
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,341
It's very weird,

1031
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:49,610
right?

1032
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,443
Yeah.

1033
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,640
Watching conflict is fucking weird.

1034
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,540
It's always weird cause you can like
sense like how you would be in that

1035
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:57,260
situation.

1036
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,400
Oh Jesus Christ.

1037
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,260
This is why people love drama.

1038
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,900
They love like feeling it without
having to be a part of it.

1039
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,750
You know that,

1040
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,220
that's why people love movies
that are fucking crazy dramatic.

1041
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:08,510
As long as they end happily,

1042
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,270
people get like super bummed
when movies don't end right.

1043
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,470
Because part of us,

1044
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:13,370
when you're watching a movie,

1045
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,700
you're somehow or another invested in
these people that you're following.

1046
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,013
You know?

1047
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,550
That's why when they get into conflict,

1048
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,541
it's so exciting.

1049
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:21,770
Even though you know it's bullshit.

1050
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,050
But when you see real conflict like that,

1051
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,870
there's something like
weirdly exciting about it,

1052
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,063
right?

1053
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,361
Yeah.

1054
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:30,350
It is a sick drill.

1055
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,841
It's awful.

1056
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:33,110
It fucking makes you tingle.

1057
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,143
A blizzard

1058
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,540
after an argument,

1059
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,350
but he helped you get out
of a fucking snow bank.

1060
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,300
Do you ever seek death proof?

1061
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:45,370
The one where Kurt
Russell plays a stunt man.

1062
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,590
It's a serial killer with his stunt car.

1063
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,513
No,

1064
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:48,971
that's,

1065
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:49,710
is that a term?

1066
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,230
Yeah,

1067
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,970
but what happened was grinder.

1068
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:52,540
Yeah.

1069
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,130
When they made the,

1070
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,430
when they made the double feature,

1071
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:58,150
Rodriguez is movie went first and
Terentino's when second and it's tough to

1072
00:29:58,151 --> 00:30:03,151
follow an hour and a half long Rodriguez
action movie and that's what happened.

1073
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:05,290
And they put it out as a
modern day double feature,

1074
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,240
but it's sort of buried this movie,

1075
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,440
the Terantin oh maid,

1076
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,250
you know,

1077
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,140
and it's very Tarantino and very cool
and almost completely sort of unknown

1078
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:15,790
about compared to his other movies.

1079
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,240
Wow.

1080
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,781
What's it called?

1081
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:17,614
Death proof.

1082
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,573
Kurt Russell.

1083
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,200
See those movies?

1084
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:24,460
Because I just like all your saw the
commercials for whatever reason or never

1085
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:25,390
got around to seeing them.

1086
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,290
Yeah.

1087
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,760
It looks like it might be fun to watch,

1088
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:29,380
but I don't know,

1089
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:29,591
man.

1090
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:30,011
I'm going to,

1091
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:31,420
the movies can be so brutal.

1092
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,390
Yeah.

1093
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,660
You're risking people not talking.

1094
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,130
You know,

1095
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,660
you're risking it and it happens.

1096
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,800
It happens every other time.

1097
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,910
Every other time we go to the movie,

1098
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:43,240
someone's just having a fucking converse
and the rappers and the popcorn.

1099
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,780
I don't understand how popcorn
became the fucking movie thing.

1100
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:48,010
It's the loudest food.

1101
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,060
She'd be like Jello.

1102
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,090
She'd be cello or milkshakes or something.

1103
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,100
It's popcorn is just [inaudible] it's
true in the bag and everything about

1104
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:00,640
popcorns loud popcorn is like Turkey.

1105
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,910
Like how the fuck did it
become king of Thanksgiving,

1106
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:03,744
right?

1107
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,150
I mean is there any real evidence
those motherfuckers reading turkeys?

1108
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,440
No.

1109
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,730
Why is it this one food,

1110
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,310
they may have been eating
popcorn for all we know.

1111
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:12,761
Well they didn't.

1112
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:14,290
Their corn was like goofy back then.

1113
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,860
Yeah.

1114
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,130
You know,

1115
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,520
you ever see what old corn looks like?

1116
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,520
Like non GMO corn.

1117
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,600
It's one of the things that people like,

1118
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,940
Ooh Jumo fuck goons scourge GMO.

1119
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,081
If you look,

1120
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,300
look at what GMO actually is.

1121
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,140
Like not,

1122
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,520
not just like changing the,

1123
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:28,931
you know,

1124
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:30,630
these plants so that they uh,

1125
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,250
they can deal with
pesticides better and doing,

1126
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,810
they do a lot of weird shit today.

1127
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,540
That's like super scientific
gene splicing type shit.

1128
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,830
But genetically modifying like
everything that we eat is like modified.

1129
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,450
They've like selectively
bred everything that we eat.

1130
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,820
Like corn used to be the scrappy little
fucking dainty thing and now it's these

1131
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,280
big ass Iowa ears,

1132
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,910
you know all those,

1133
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:56,260
like our tomatoes,

1134
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,430
all of our apples,

1135
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:58,990
like all that stuff's been engineered.

1136
00:31:59,250 --> 00:31:59,510
You know,

1137
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,120
it hasn't all been done in a lab,

1138
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,350
but it's all been like we've,

1139
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:07,351
they've made these crops like very in
a specific manner so that they have a

1140
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:09,190
higher yield.

1141
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,760
Did you ever see king corn now
everybody should see that movie.

1142
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,900
It's a freak out.

1143
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,640
[inaudible] was the best part in it.

1144
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,640
When they should a big hole in the side
of a cow and they're just reaching in

1145
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:19,290
there.

1146
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:19,780
That's on,

1147
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,900
that's in food inc to have
that food bank as well.

1148
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:27,100
Like whenever they want to talk
about like feeding cattle grain,

1149
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:29,230
they always show these
cows and have these open,

1150
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,000
I don't know what exactly they're doing,

1151
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:32,230
but they have these open hole.

1152
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:32,501
Well,

1153
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:35,680
you could literally reach into the
cow's stomach so they have a hole on the

1154
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:38,980
outside of their body and you could reach
your hand into that hole and actually

1155
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,850
pull the food out of this cow stomach.

1156
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,730
Did they develop abscesses?

1157
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:47,990
Sometimes from eating grains and eating
things that like their body just doesn't

1158
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:50,510
want to process and then they're there.

1159
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,290
They're pumping.

1160
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,700
I'm filled with fucking antibiotics that
just jack and their system up and these

1161
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:56,750
fucking house,

1162
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,890
like if you,

1163
00:32:57,891 --> 00:32:59,660
if you watch this video and you see this,

1164
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:03,230
this whole in the cow or like
you're looking into its stomach,

1165
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:03,740
you're like,

1166
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,240
what is wrong with people?

1167
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:06,290
Like what are we doing?

1168
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,423
Like what,

1169
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,270
how do you,

1170
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,320
how is this okay?

1171
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,740
Like how is it okay to have
a hole in the cow side?

1172
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,340
We could reach your hand
in and just like it's,

1173
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:19,040
it's that fucked up that it's like
its stomach is outside of its body.

1174
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,440
See if he could pull that up
just so we could see it from,

1175
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:22,370
these guys haven't seen it.

1176
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,211
And what does that do?

1177
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:23,420
It,

1178
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,650
it makes the,

1179
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,350
they do it to treat the cows
because the cows start getting,

1180
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,990
I think they do it for different reasons,

1181
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:34,991
but I think one of the main ones is that
when these cows are eating grains and

1182
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:35,561
they're,

1183
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:36,590
they're getting sick,

1184
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,700
they developed these abscesses
in their body and um,

1185
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,260
I think that's what it is with Kelsey.

1186
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,093
That's that.

1187
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,900
That's where the cow's stomach is.

1188
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,610
It looks like a joke or something.

1189
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:46,991
Like a,

1190
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,620
a photo shop.

1191
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,390
Yeah.

1192
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,110
It's,

1193
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,730
but coins in around the edges.

1194
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,010
I should know the whole
reason why they do it,

1195
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,790
but it's one of the main reasons
why people are propublic.

1196
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,010
He's got his hand in that guys.

1197
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,230
Oh my goodness.

1198
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,880
It's one of the main reasons why people
were like trying to go back to grass fed

1199
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:08,714
beef.

1200
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,790
Like if you have grass fed beef,

1201
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,070
it's not going to be as juicy.

1202
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:14,300
It's not going to be as fat.

1203
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,100
It's not going to be like
when you cook a Ribeye,

1204
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,960
like a corn fed rib eye.

1205
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,040
Oh my goodness.

1206
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,290
They're just crackling
with fat and it's just,

1207
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,310
it's so good.

1208
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,100
But that animal's sick.

1209
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,880
Like it's not a healthy animal.

1210
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:27,170
It's got that all that fat,

1211
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:28,004
it's body.

1212
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,250
What's going on?

1213
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:29,530
It's,

1214
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,810
it's this custody.

1215
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,420
Oh,

1216
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,750
when she's pulling the
matter out of the cow's body.

1217
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,890
Yeah.

1218
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:38,780
He said they were doing
it to help the cow.

1219
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,700
I think in that situation,

1220
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:41,511
when they have that out,

1221
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:44,240
that ring on the outside of it and
they're reaching into the cow's stomach,

1222
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,310
I think they'd do it
because the cows Foxville.

1223
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:47,144
If they don't,

1224
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,880
I don't understand it totally.

1225
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:51,020
I shouldn't be talking about it,

1226
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:52,490
but whatever it is is bad.

1227
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,230
Fucking disgusting.

1228
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,161
I was like,

1229
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:57,950
can I just vomit this whole documentary?

1230
00:34:57,951 --> 00:35:01,670
King corn was all about corn and how
much corn is in our food and they go

1231
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:02,180
through these,

1232
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,810
these college kids that go through the
supermarket and just start pulling things

1233
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:09,140
off the shelves and recognizing how
much of everything has corn in it.

1234
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:09,921
And then they do this,

1235
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:12,200
this test on their own body and their,

1236
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,480
it found out their
bodies like mostly corn.

1237
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:17,720
Like most of the carbon in their body
came from corn or whatever the fuck it

1238
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:17,931
was.

1239
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:19,730
But it's one of those things where you,

1240
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:20,564
you know,

1241
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,433
they take you,

1242
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,660
yeah.

1243
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,500
You can stick his hand in the
whole of the whole workout.

1244
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,550
You son of a B Hinchcliffe yeah,

1245
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:35,803
it's a,

1246
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,201
I dunno,

1247
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,034
it's,

1248
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,010
it's a very

1249
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,843
weird thing,

1250
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,580
but you can just stick
your hand in to someone's,

1251
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,910
some animal stomach like,

1252
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,590
yeah.

1253
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,500
It looks like a piggy bank
saying like the circle.

1254
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,423
Yeah.

1255
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,480
It's a piggy cow I think.

1256
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:48,990
Yeah.

1257
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,160
So point being that's no,

1258
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,133
you know,

1259
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:51,960
that's uh,

1260
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,793
it's not good.

1261
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,790
Not Great.

1262
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,560
That corn shit's not good for cows.

1263
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,583
Oh,

1264
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,643
so how,

1265
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,300
how many shows do you
guys got in the can now?

1266
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,730
82 82 kill Tony.

1267
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:04,980
So you girls have 82 minutes of comedy.

1268
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,600
Does anybody ever called in sick?

1269
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,780
No.

1270
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,210
Damn fucking powerful workers.

1271
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,960
Yeah.

1272
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,890
You guys dedicated?

1273
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,580
Yeah.

1274
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,240
Not once.

1275
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,290
No period talk.

1276
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:16,521
No,

1277
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:16,850
no,

1278
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,683
no.

1279
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,480
One time I was in a flight back home
and that was when we first started.

1280
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,050
Yeah.

1281
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,800
I was just back home and I missed one
and I even tried to record a set and send

1282
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:26,610
it in.

1283
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,450
I remember that.

1284
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,220
Have you guys gone anywhere
else in the country?

1285
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,173
Like other cities?

1286
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:31,860
Um,

1287
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,040
we've gone to San Diego
and we did pass it.

1288
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,320
Dina,

1289
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,570
did you guys do kill Tony in San
Diego or did you do stand up?

1290
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,820
We didn't get downtown San Diego.

1291
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:40,990
I know you did it in Pasadena.

1292
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:41,560
Yeah,

1293
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,393
comedy store.

1294
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,180
La Jolla here.

1295
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,060
That's the other thing that's
weird about doing comedy in La.

1296
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:50,830
Like la has a kind of specific crowd
and a lot of ways and there's some shit

1297
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:55,831
that you can do in La that literally
won't fly anywhere else in the flyover.

1298
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:56,741
You know,

1299
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:57,011
there's,

1300
00:36:57,011 --> 00:37:00,110
there's certain shit that you
can do here in this town like,

1301
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,890
like it has a very certain
sensibility almost all towns do.

1302
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:06,310
Like Boston was famous for
having a Boston sense of humor,

1303
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:09,160
a lot of Boston related material
that didn't work anywhere else.

1304
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,360
So like this,

1305
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,360
one of the best things to do is
a go to as many different spots.

1306
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,100
Do you guys find that it's very different?

1307
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,770
The crowds he experienced the
comedy store versus the road?

1308
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:18,281
Yeah,

1309
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:18,760
I think,

1310
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,020
I feel like it's harder here.

1311
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,800
The crowds are harder in la because I
feel like everyone's just used to watching

1312
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:25,300
entertainment all the time.

1313
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:28,450
All the time and auditions and
like different shows and Improv.

1314
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:31,210
So people are just used to
seeing other people try to,

1315
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:31,601
you know,

1316
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:32,500
work their craft.

1317
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:32,950
Yeah.

1318
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,270
Here when I went to Bray,

1319
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:35,620
uh,

1320
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,910
which isn't even that far,

1321
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,691
I was like,

1322
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:38,524
Whoa,

1323
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,820
I need to get out of La Cause Bray is
not that far and I get there and I'm kind

1324
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:44,800
of like dry and like they just like,

1325
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,840
it was just like this weird disconnect.

1326
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,820
And that was a moment where I was like,

1327
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:49,061
wow,

1328
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,560
I just got to keep going other places.

1329
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,570
Yeah.

1330
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:51,991
But you know,

1331
00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:53,070
here's the other difference.

1332
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,570
There's people that come to a place,

1333
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:58,320
like the comedy store and they're used
to seeing a lot of experimentation,

1334
00:37:58,321 --> 00:37:59,580
a lot of new material.

1335
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,500
But when you're in a club like Braya,

1336
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,690
like you got headliners
coming in every week.

1337
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,890
I mean that's really what it's like.

1338
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:06,870
The Bray improv headlines
coming every week.

1339
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:08,100
And that's what those people say.

1340
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,881
They go there,

1341
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:09,960
they see this guy kill,

1342
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:11,030
they see that God kill.

1343
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:11,940
They see this girl kill.

1344
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,040
And when you do that over
and over and over again,

1345
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:14,280
you,

1346
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,720
you sees in your crowd.

1347
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:18,090
Like if you look at the lineup
of like the Improv and Brio,

1348
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,280
it's just a murderer after murderer.

1349
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:23,310
It's just a sterile assassins and
they're all coming in for the weekends.

1350
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:23,881
So like you,

1351
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:27,840
you have like this whole system there
where people were accustomed to a very

1352
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:30,450
high level of like national level comedy.

1353
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,493
Yeah.

1354
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,850
I think it's easier.

1355
00:38:32,851 --> 00:38:34,740
This places a lot easier.

1356
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,320
I agree.

1357
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,890
Yeah.

1358
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,550
Yeah.

1359
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,031
I think,

1360
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:37,660
um,

1361
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,740
the thing about those places is they're
not as open to experimentation though.

1362
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,670
Yeah.

1363
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,240
Right.

1364
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,850
And I was hosting the weekend.

1365
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:46,900
I like knew what I was doing,

1366
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:48,790
but it was such a good experience.

1367
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,680
Cause that Friday I was like,

1368
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,543
Whoa,

1369
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,423
Whoa,

1370
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,620
La has the more educated as
far as like comedy style,

1371
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,640
like hack stuff doesn't go over in la the
way we'll go over in some places like,

1372
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,510
but that's harder to do any more anyway.

1373
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:05,390
Isn't it like hacks.

1374
00:39:05,391 --> 00:39:05,590
Dot.

1375
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,490
Like you really,

1376
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:07,510
it's all worn out.

1377
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:07,760
Yeah.

1378
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,070
Like it doesn't exist anymore.

1379
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,610
Right?

1380
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:09,770
Like,

1381
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,280
where's the last guy that
you heard was a hack?

1382
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,280
I just do an hack Joe's.

1383
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,760
We see them every day.

1384
00:39:15,761 --> 00:39:16,091
I think.

1385
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:16,421
Well,

1386
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,300
yeah,

1387
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:17,860
I mean,

1388
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,350
anybody who's on a lineup in front of me,

1389
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,120
they mean if it's not like if they,

1390
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:23,860
they,

1391
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,580
you know,

1392
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,840
they better be good or else I will.

1393
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,450
I will complain about them being in front
of me on a lineup no matter how long

1394
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:33,030
they've been to one
and no matter whatever.

1395
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,671
You know what I mean?

1396
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,830
It's just like if I hear a bad joke,

1397
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,580
I just go,

1398
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,730
why is this person have a better
spot than they made in fury?

1399
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:39,951
Well,

1400
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:41,120
you just made it really personal.

1401
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,650
That's not what I'm [inaudible] about.

1402
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,690
I'll call them a hack,

1403
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:45,320
you know what I mean?

1404
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,250
And not to their face.

1405
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,360
You run into that though.

1406
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:48,194
Do you see that?

1407
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,370
I don't see that anymore.

1408
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,690
I really don't see hacks any,

1409
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,260
right?

1410
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:51,830
Yeah.

1411
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,860
I remember like they used to be
guys who had like a stock act,

1412
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,400
right?

1413
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,150
They had an act that was
just interchangeable with a
lot of other people's acts

1414
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:03,020
and it was based on these like
really common premises like okay,

1415
00:40:03,021 --> 00:40:04,070
here's a perfect example.

1416
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,140
A guy going to buy tampons for his wife
and he would get to the counter and the

1417
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:13,310
thing wouldn't have a tag on it and
they would go price check tampons,

1418
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,144
Aisle Alto.

1419
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,470
There was a hundred guys who
did that joke and they're like,

1420
00:40:18,471 --> 00:40:18,861
please,

1421
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:19,730
I'll pay you twice.

1422
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:21,920
The money just don't do that.

1423
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,940
Don't do that again.

1424
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,621
How much is it?

1425
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,620
I think it's $50 sir.

1426
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:25,454
That's too much.

1427
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,560
I saw so many people do that joke.

1428
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,480
I mean it was one of those
things where it was like,

1429
00:40:29,481 --> 00:40:30,081
oh my God,

1430
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:31,010
this is out of control.

1431
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,300
There was like that premise.

1432
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:34,910
It was like a super common hack premise.

1433
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:35,660
Yeah,

1434
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,710
cops and donuts.

1435
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:37,730
That's where that came from.

1436
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,870
It came from hacks.

1437
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:39,881
Yeah.

1438
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:42,720
When I hear the words guys
and girls are super different.

1439
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,360
It listed be a totally let go.

1440
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,630
Ironic about dating in La is hard.

1441
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,693
Yeah.

1442
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,140
The difference treat La and New York is

1443
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,070
a lot of it is like,

1444
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,001
you know,

1445
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:59,580
you're just trying to think
of shit to talk about.

1446
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:02,400
A lot of people when it's
like really based stuff,

1447
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,310
it's a lot of the most
common stuff like travel,

1448
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,780
most common,

1449
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:07,021
you know,

1450
00:41:07,021 --> 00:41:08,670
differences between cities.

1451
00:41:08,671 --> 00:41:09,810
Like all that stuff is like,

1452
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,370
like baby blocks like building
and sometimes still awesome.

1453
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,920
Like someone doesn't
take it out of the mix.

1454
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:21,180
Like if you had the most awesome the
difference between New York and La joke

1455
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:21,990
today.

1456
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,150
It's not like you can't
talk about that subject.

1457
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:24,930
Like if you,

1458
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:29,820
if you have it and it's funny I'll be
laughing like I'm not a comedy Snob at

1459
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:30,654
all.

1460
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,520
I think that people get silly with like,

1461
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,870
you know what's acceptable,

1462
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:36,770
what's not acceptable.

1463
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,440
Like there's some dumb
shit that's really funny.

1464
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:42,770
You know like it doesn't
have to all be smart like in,

1465
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,040
it can be a stew of things like burn.

1466
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:49,460
I were talking the other day about
pratfalls like he has this bit and he was

1467
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:50,720
trying to figure out how to,

1468
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,650
how to like almost get
like flipped on stage.

1469
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,820
And I can't talk about it without
like sort of reveal on the premise.

1470
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,990
So he and I were like,

1471
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,500
I was showing him like these different
roles that you could do a different way.

1472
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:05,060
You could fall where you're
not going to get hurt,

1473
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,270
but it'll look kind of crazy.

1474
00:42:06,271 --> 00:42:07,250
Your legs be over the air.

1475
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,391
And uh,

1476
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:08,810
he was like,

1477
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,650
we were talking about like,

1478
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:11,720
Prat falls like pratfalls aren't cheap.

1479
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,081
Right.

1480
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:12,320
If it's,

1481
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:12,621
I'm like,

1482
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:13,040
if it's,

1483
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,010
if it's a part of a joke and
it makes the joke better,

1484
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,993
it's funny,

1485
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,650
you know?

1486
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:17,870
Yeah.

1487
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,450
But there's some people who would back
off because they worried about the

1488
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:21,830
contempt of their peers,

1489
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,251
you know,

1490
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:22,970
they worry about,

1491
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,380
oh,

1492
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:23,991
what are you doing?

1493
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:25,100
Flips on stage now.

1494
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:26,050
Tony Hinge also

1495
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,551
comedian,

1496
00:42:27,551 --> 00:42:28,430
like I like,

1497
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,171
you know,

1498
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:32,140
somebody who moves around
and stuff like that.

1499
00:42:32,141 --> 00:42:33,610
If that's part of their natural thing,

1500
00:42:33,611 --> 00:42:33,911
then yeah,

1501
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:34,601
they could do that.

1502
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:35,200
But you know,

1503
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,033
some people,

1504
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,221
Joey Diaz,

1505
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,450
one Joey moves around a lot,

1506
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:39,350
but it keeps the mic and this,

1507
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,120
I can't picture him doing Pratt off,

1508
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,231
but he's done some,

1509
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:43,460
some karate kicks on stage.

1510
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:44,290
I've seen that really.

1511
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:44,720
Yeah.

1512
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,190
Joey gets crazy sometimes.

1513
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:46,940
He,

1514
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,320
but he always keeps the mic in the stand.

1515
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:49,550
If you noticed that about Diaz,

1516
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,930
he never holds the mic.

1517
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,320
Ah.

1518
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,770
He uses both of his hands and
it keeps the mic in the stand.

1519
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,310
He's one of the few guys that do that.

1520
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:55,700
Yeah,

1521
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,200
he's got a totally different style,

1522
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,010
you know,

1523
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:58,731
but it works,

1524
00:42:58,731 --> 00:42:59,490
man.

1525
00:42:59,490 --> 00:42:59,810
It,

1526
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,020
he's a master of having that
microphone in the stand.

1527
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:03,330
Yeah.

1528
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,830
I love what he does when he's killing.

1529
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,380
He grabs it by its side and he looks,

1530
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,051
it's straight up,

1531
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:07,884
a few inches

1532
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:08,610
down.

1533
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,411
You just hear that the,

1534
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:09,620
the,

1535
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,920
the debate is on the monster.

1536
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,260
He's got this new bit about Isis.

1537
00:43:13,261 --> 00:43:14,130
I was fucking,

1538
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,170
tears were pouring down my eyes.

1539
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,090
He was a red,

1540
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,120
like a beat and screaming at the top of
his lungs and the water and sweat was

1541
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:26,550
flying and he's taking his
jacket off while he's killing,

1542
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:27,301
while he's,

1543
00:43:27,301 --> 00:43:30,180
Kelly used to take his jacket
off to in this isis bit.

1544
00:43:30,181 --> 00:43:30,510
I'm like,

1545
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,470
oh my God,

1546
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:32,910
he's the best.

1547
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,780
He's the best ever.

1548
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,200
Yeah.

1549
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:34,810
You know,

1550
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,101
if you,

1551
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:36,540
if you never seen Joey Diaz live,

1552
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,383
you don't understand.

1553
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,260
There's another level and
he's a perfect example.

1554
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,050
Like there's no like great
intellectual truths in his act.

1555
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,870
It's shit that he thinks is fucking funny.

1556
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,760
He's just tried to kill,

1557
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,520
he's trying to say the funniest
shit that he could say.

1558
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:50,940
Yeah.

1559
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,271
And,

1560
00:43:51,271 --> 00:43:52,470
and in doing that,

1561
00:43:52,471 --> 00:43:53,304
like,

1562
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:53,911
you know,

1563
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:57,390
he hits this rare air
sometimes I'll like Joey Diaz,

1564
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,180
his hit some air that uh,

1565
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,550
I do.

1566
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,690
I don't think this may be like three
or four other people I've ever seen hit

1567
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:04,441
that level.

1568
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:04,891
Like he,

1569
00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:09,891
there's a level of crying in the crowd
during some of his bits and people just

1570
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,110
hitting tables because they can't breathe.

1571
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:13,500
Right?

1572
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:13,820
Yeah.

1573
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,820
Cause this dude is just,

1574
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,710
and he's fucking slaying.

1575
00:44:16,711 --> 00:44:18,450
It's Brett's coming out of his mouth.

1576
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,450
That's one of the fun things about the
sitting in the back of a comedy room is

1577
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,890
you get to see the shadows,

1578
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,510
the people in front of you,

1579
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,390
how they're physically moving
different than the rest of the show.

1580
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,231
Rest of the show.

1581
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:30,011
They're pretty still,

1582
00:44:30,011 --> 00:44:32,550
like you might see them pop
and down for laughs and stuff.

1583
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,130
But if you're sitting in the
back during a Joey Diaz said,

1584
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,310
it's like you see like spit
takes flying in the air.

1585
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,880
One guy falling out of his seat
and other guys slamming a table.

1586
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:46,830
And then another thing that Joey does
that I just love and I always look for is

1587
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:49,710
that he kills faster
than anybody else too.

1588
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,430
Like for some reason the
audience immediately can
tell he's just being himself

1589
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:54,300
an artist or renal.

1590
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:55,470
When he walks up there and goes,

1591
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,011
hey,

1592
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:57,620
cock suckers [inaudible] bar,

1593
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,190
and it's already happening.

1594
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,180
Right.

1595
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,980
They connect with them immediately.

1596
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:02,731
There's none of that.

1597
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:02,941
Hey,

1598
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:03,870
good to meet you.

1599
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,440
Uh,

1600
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,273
you know,

1601
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,030
yeah,

1602
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:06,361
no,

1603
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:06,661
he's,

1604
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:08,370
he's just funny to look at.

1605
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,323
Yeah,

1606
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,470
he's funny.

1607
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,310
Everything's funny.

1608
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:12,630
His personality is funny.

1609
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:13,800
He's so unique,

1610
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:13,981
like,

1611
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:14,880
and how he talks,

1612
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,500
he's just everything about him.

1613
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:16,650
He,

1614
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,250
this is a unusual dude and I'm glad
he's back at the comedy store too.

1615
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,113
You know,

1616
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,291
Joey came,

1617
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:25,410
he started back a couple of
weeks before I did and uh,

1618
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,221
he told me,

1619
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:26,551
he said,

1620
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:26,911
man,

1621
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,181
he goes,

1622
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:27,600
it really,

1623
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,680
really changed my act.

1624
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,371
He said it really,

1625
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:30,480
it really got me fired up.

1626
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,010
I got excited about comedy again.

1627
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:32,511
He goes,

1628
00:45:32,511 --> 00:45:34,890
it really like made me
excited about just killing.

1629
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:35,880
I just wanted to kill.

1630
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:36,720
I was like,

1631
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:36,871
well,

1632
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:37,231
he goes,

1633
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:39,690
it just gave me another
shot of inspiration,

1634
00:45:39,691 --> 00:45:40,310
you know?

1635
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:40,940
Alright.

1636
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,773
You know,

1637
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,940
Thompson girl and I were talking
about this last night that,

1638
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:45,210
um,

1639
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,660
when you have a bunch of friends
that are like really into stand up,

1640
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,940
like everybody's like really
into writing new shit,

1641
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:52,320
really into performing a lot.

1642
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,260
Like you get so energized by that.

1643
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:57,690
It's like you're on this like comedy,

1644
00:45:57,691 --> 00:45:58,910
caffeine thing.

1645
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,520
Yeah.

1646
00:45:59,520 --> 00:45:59,890
Yeah.

1647
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,300
It's the way it's really like,

1648
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:01,660
it's,

1649
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,020
you know,

1650
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,120
surround yourself with people
that like you can relate to,

1651
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:04,800
you know what I mean?

1652
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,400
Yeah.

1653
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,020
That's why the store is so important.

1654
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:07,854
Yeah.

1655
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,330
That's why it's like that.

1656
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,490
It's this weird freaky hangout spot.

1657
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,773
You know,

1658
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,070
like last night we were in the green room,

1659
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,270
Zach Galifianakis,

1660
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:15,841
Ken,

1661
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:16,320
John,

1662
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,430
the doctor from over movies.

1663
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,140
Ken was there.

1664
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,973
Yes.

1665
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,581
I fucking guys.

1666
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:21,414
Awesome.

1667
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,050
Um,

1668
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:22,621
who else was there?

1669
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:24,300
Jeff Ross is back there.

1670
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,613
Um,

1671
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,221
and,

1672
00:46:26,221 --> 00:46:28,140
and tell Whitney Cummings is back there.

1673
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,190
We're all hanging out,

1674
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,170
having a fucking blast,

1675
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,910
just laughing and telling Brad Williams
is back there laughing and talking and

1676
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:40,530
telling stories and it's just like
that kind of a an environment man.

1677
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,810
It just gets you so fired up to do comedy.

1678
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,180
I went on that stage last night running,

1679
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:45,781
you know,

1680
00:46:45,781 --> 00:46:47,290
I just couldn't wait to get up there.

1681
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,570
It's like there was so much shit.

1682
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,850
It was all in the air in that place.

1683
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,330
Yeah.

1684
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:51,760
That's a,

1685
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,460
that's something that I forgot about man.

1686
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,323
I really did.

1687
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,820
I forgot about it when I left the
store cause I was so angry at the

1688
00:46:56,821 --> 00:46:58,110
circumstances and everything.

1689
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,940
But I think even so,

1690
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,400
I think it got better while we were gone.

1691
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,870
People were saying that it got better
around the time of podcasting for some

1692
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:11,871
reason that they sort of coincided that
it was like about five years ago the

1693
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,590
store really started picking up,

1694
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,540
which is about when like,

1695
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,130
uh,

1696
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,800
this isn't that like how long Adam
Carolla has been doing podcasts?

1697
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,560
Most,

1698
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,330
most comics about five years ago.

1699
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,080
Yeah.

1700
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,000
And I think that a lot of comics,

1701
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:26,460
when they started doing podcasts and
the Corolla showing other people's

1702
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:27,000
podcasts,

1703
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,160
people started hearing about comedy
and then realizing that a lot of these

1704
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:31,180
people that are comics,

1705
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,940
they're just fucking regular people
that just decided to do comedy.

1706
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:36,280
Like how many people have you met
in your life when you're like,

1707
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:36,970
dude,

1708
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:37,780
listen to me.

1709
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,770
You should be a comedian.

1710
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,480
No one,

1711
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,740
never did.

1712
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:42,160
I see him.

1713
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,360
I meet people all the time.

1714
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,830
So your cert more cynical in me.

1715
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,860
There's some chick that was hanging
out at the bar the other night.

1716
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:47,890
She was whole,

1717
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,820
various.

1718
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,500
She was hilarious.

1719
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,520
She was really funny.

1720
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:51,761
I go,

1721
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:52,361
what do you do?

1722
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:52,690
You know,

1723
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:52,960
she's,

1724
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,950
which works in banking.

1725
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:54,401
I go,

1726
00:47:54,401 --> 00:47:55,420
you should be a comedian.

1727
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,830
You're really fucking funny.

1728
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,791
And she's got this,

1729
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,000
got this natural sense of
delivery and personality.

1730
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:01,271
I'm like,

1731
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:02,170
you really should do it.

1732
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,460
Just go to an open mic night.

1733
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,410
Just go and watch how bad everybody sucks.

1734
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,270
You'll want to do it cause like open mic
nights are the craziest places ever it,

1735
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:10,810
right.

1736
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:15,780
If you want to find the epicenter of
Cuckoo in Hollywood or hacks or some hacks

1737
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:16,623
at open mics.

1738
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:16,780
Yeah,

1739
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,613
they're hackers.

1740
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,830
Mostly actors.

1741
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,000
That's a good expression.

1742
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,721
I hate that though.

1743
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:24,531
You see that a lot,

1744
00:48:24,531 --> 00:48:25,580
especially on killed Tony.

1745
00:48:25,581 --> 00:48:28,850
These guys that don't
really want to be comics,

1746
00:48:28,851 --> 00:48:31,580
but they're doing it because
they want to be come an actor.

1747
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:33,530
So they kind of go through that route.

1748
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:34,790
It really,

1749
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:35,750
it's really noticeable.

1750
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:36,880
Yeah.

1751
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,270
Or they want to brag to their improv
troupe that they went and did stand up at

1752
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:42,430
the comedy store and then
they tell you I'm a comic.

1753
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,323
Yeah.

1754
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:44,440
Well not only can they do,

1755
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:44,970
I'm proud,

1756
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,140
but I'm also a comedian.

1757
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:46,331
Yeah.

1758
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:47,200
That would be like your,

1759
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,180
your headshot standup comedian.

1760
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:49,631
Actor,

1761
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:52,180
first actor slash standup comedian.

1762
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:54,320
Yeah.

1763
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,200
There's some about actors that like,

1764
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:01,570
it's really difficult to get
somebody to pick you for stuff.

1765
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,640
Like it's the worst part
about being an actor.

1766
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,300
Like I know people that are actors that
are like really struggling and they,

1767
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:07,660
it's,

1768
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:12,040
it's an insanely frustrating because
it's not something you can just do.

1769
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:12,611
You know?

1770
00:49:12,611 --> 00:49:12,791
Like,

1771
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:13,750
if you do stand up,

1772
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:14,531
there's an open Mike night,

1773
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:14,831
you go up,

1774
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:16,090
you fucking kill and you,

1775
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:17,290
if you just keep doing that,

1776
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,740
eventually somehow or another you just
get better and you become a professional.

1777
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:21,590
I mean that's really the,

1778
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,020
the college of standup comedy.

1779
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,070
But for an actor,

1780
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:25,900
you've got to have somebody find you.

1781
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:27,220
You've got to have somebody fine,

1782
00:49:27,221 --> 00:49:27,441
dude,

1783
00:49:27,441 --> 00:49:28,390
they've got to come get you.

1784
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,471
They got to see you.

1785
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:30,370
You do the audition,

1786
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:31,204
they go,

1787
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,501
that guy,

1788
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:34,620
let's make him the guy and they take in,

1789
00:49:34,621 --> 00:49:37,240
they fucking put makeup on you and
they push in front of the camera,

1790
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,730
give you a bunch of shit
to say and they picked you.

1791
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:40,600
But guess what?

1792
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,500
He could have done it.

1793
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,400
He could have done it.

1794
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,233
He could have done it.

1795
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,020
He could have done it.

1796
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,980
They could change the gender.

1797
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:45,814
She could have done it.

1798
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,700
I mean it's like there's so
many people for each role.

1799
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:49,540
You know,

1800
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,980
there's a few really good ones.

1801
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:51,850
There's a few,

1802
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:52,331
you know,

1803
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:55,930
Marlon Brando type characters
that rise through the rest.

1804
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:58,360
But the reality is
you've got to get picked.

1805
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,150
And so this is weird social
game that's going on.

1806
00:50:01,151 --> 00:50:01,630
So they're,

1807
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,690
they're all socially like terrified.

1808
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,880
They're afraid and not all of them,

1809
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:07,511
but a lot of them,

1810
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:09,310
they're afraid to truly speak their mind.

1811
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,180
They're always like in this weird like
confi they're always like hoping that you

1812
00:50:13,181 --> 00:50:17,200
liked them because they have the audition
all the time and these powerful people

1813
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:18,280
standing in front of them and go,

1814
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:19,181
hmm,

1815
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:20,380
I don't know.

1816
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,520
I don't know.

1817
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,890
Like Dom Irrera was telling me about
an audition then he went on and how

1818
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:24,551
insulting it was.

1819
00:50:24,551 --> 00:50:27,950
The woman's started eating her sandwich
and checking her texts while he was

1820
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:28,191
doing,

1821
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,730
as long as she's eating a
sandwich and checking your texts,

1822
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,660
I was like,

1823
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,560
Whoa,

1824
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,550
that's dark.

1825
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:35,120
Yeah.

1826
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,660
Yeah.

1827
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,410
That's rough.

1828
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:36,700
And if,

1829
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,580
if that's how you make your living and
you keep going to these things and some

1830
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:43,070
woman's they're eating or
sandwich or some guy is a,

1831
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,370
he's a in the middle of a text
message while he's listening to you.

1832
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:47,571
Thanks.

1833
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:48,404
Thanks Tony.

1834
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,620
That was very good time.

1835
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,230
We'll be in touch and you're like,

1836
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:51,651
oh my God,

1837
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:52,484
I'll never eat.

1838
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,470
You mean that's fucked.

1839
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,070
Yeah.

1840
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,320
And sometimes like commercial auditions,

1841
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,540
they'll just want like a reaction
and then people are like,

1842
00:50:59,541 --> 00:50:59,690
oh,

1843
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:00,320
how was it?

1844
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:00,531
They're like,

1845
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:00,961
I don't know,

1846
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:02,000
I just like smile,

1847
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,020
but I don't know how I did.

1848
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:03,800
Yeah,

1849
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,150
yeah.

1850
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,470
Commercial auditions for the worst.

1851
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:06,880
When I first started,

1852
00:51:06,881 --> 00:51:11,881
I got sent on a lot of those
and the assistant for the
agent that I had was like

1853
00:51:12,131 --> 00:51:12,791
the worst.

1854
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:16,240
He was notoriously bad at what he did
because there were a few guys signed with

1855
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:17,770
this agency at the store,

1856
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:21,490
so he would just be hung over
from a crazy night before.

1857
00:51:21,491 --> 00:51:24,280
And he would send you
out on a bad audition,

1858
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,200
like one that you're not even matched for,

1859
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,450
who says we have an
audition for you today at,

1860
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,050
you know,

1861
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,070
33 sunset boulevard at 8:00 AM.

1862
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,390
See,

1863
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,460
get their schedule around it.

1864
00:51:33,461 --> 00:51:34,600
You get excited for it.

1865
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:35,890
And then you show up and it's for,

1866
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:36,370
you know,

1867
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:41,320
50 year old Asian woman and you're
sitting there in a lobby with 50 year old

1868
00:51:41,321 --> 00:51:42,640
Asian women and then the guy,

1869
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,380
it's finally your turn and the guy goes,

1870
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,190
you know,

1871
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,023
uh,

1872
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:46,540
you know,

1873
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,351
this isn't for you.

1874
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:47,740
And I go,

1875
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,710
but they told me to come
here and be here for this.

1876
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:51,191
And you go,

1877
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,810
well I guess we could get you in here.

1878
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,241
It's like,

1879
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:54,970
I ain't never had that.

1880
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:55,501
When you do that,

1881
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:57,360
would you play a 50 year old Asian woman?

1882
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:58,060
Well,

1883
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:58,770
no,

1884
00:51:58,770 --> 00:51:59,603
I would just read it

1885
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,120
so tired.

1886
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,970
I started acting like on,

1887
00:52:11,971 --> 00:52:12,510
um,

1888
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,560
when I was living in New York,

1889
00:52:13,561 --> 00:52:15,750
I started going on audition
so it didn't do any acting,

1890
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,780
but I got this agent and then
all of a sudden they'd go,

1891
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:19,614
do you want to act?

1892
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:20,120
And um,

1893
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,330
and it was really one of those like,

1894
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,080
okay.

1895
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,611
And then also,

1896
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:23,610
and I'm going out on auditions,

1897
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,320
zero acting experience,

1898
00:52:25,321 --> 00:52:25,801
none.

1899
00:52:25,801 --> 00:52:26,190
Right.

1900
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:26,551
And I was like,

1901
00:52:26,551 --> 00:52:27,450
what am I doing?

1902
00:52:27,451 --> 00:52:28,440
Like what is this?

1903
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:32,250
And it was the first time I ever got to
see child stars because I didn't know

1904
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:32,940
about that.

1905
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,060
I had no idea that there was these
like stage moms in the stage,

1906
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:37,020
moms with their kids,

1907
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:39,030
especially for like a
commercial auditions.

1908
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,170
Do you guys run into them in la?

1909
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,380
I'd sage moms.

1910
00:52:41,381 --> 00:52:42,070
I've seen some,

1911
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:42,580
yeah,

1912
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,060
I have it.

1913
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:43,720
I'm like,

1914
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,100
they're the scariest,

1915
00:52:45,101 --> 00:52:45,881
and I grew up here,

1916
00:52:45,881 --> 00:52:50,020
so I saw a lot of stage moms when I was
like little like in school there's like

1917
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:53,230
act or kids with their stage moms
and my mom was afraid of them,

1918
00:52:53,231 --> 00:52:54,064
so now I'm just,

1919
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,270
I've always avoided,

1920
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:59,800
but I've seen a mom out of a
commercial audition who said to her,

1921
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,550
kid,

1922
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,980
sit down or I'm going to
beat the Jesus out to you.

1923
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,990
Like in the commercial audition,

1924
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:05,860
like,

1925
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,693
yeah,

1926
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,220
okay.

1927
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:07,771
Jesus.

1928
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:08,604
Yeah,

1929
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,523
expressions.

1930
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,471
It's like,

1931
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:11,810
Wah,

1932
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:14,110
hit my kid but I'm not
going to blast him the Lord.

1933
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:15,840
It's the budget,

1934
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,040
but I don't say the real Jesus.

1935
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:21,370
Jesus is the fake cheese
from the creator of the name.

1936
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:25,180
The word licorice whips
comes beejesus licorice.

1937
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,010
It seems like the

1938
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,180
same guy who made that word probably
made up beejesus licorice whips be Jesus.

1939
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,780
Maybe bell licorice whips.

1940
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,010
Real licorice.

1941
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,600
Black people.

1942
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,330
That's hilarious.

1943
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,770
But Jesus,

1944
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,693
oh,

1945
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:43,590
that sounds like something that Taryn,

1946
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:46,470
Tina would say while
promoting on the beach,

1947
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,040
I cannot figure it out.

1948
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:50,874
My computer.

1949
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,080
I just always felt like the culture of
a auditioning was always like insanely

1950
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:57,450
like defeating and get felt bad.

1951
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,410
Like,

1952
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,500
and I used to think that like that's the
reason why I think a lot of people are

1953
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:02,820
depressed in Hollywood.

1954
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,170
Like especially actors.

1955
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,020
Like when I started going on auditions,

1956
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:10,050
I f I failed miserably and
all these movie auditions,

1957
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,890
I went on it because they'll,

1958
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,440
your agency will send you
out for shit that like,

1959
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,320
like say if they already have
some movie star for a role,

1960
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:17,520
they already have it cast.

1961
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,000
They'll still take like
30 people and they'll say,

1962
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,750
well you should,

1963
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,810
you should go so they can see you because
they might like it for something else.

1964
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:25,231
And I'd be like,

1965
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:26,064
what?

1966
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:27,450
Like in my mind I was like,

1967
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:28,460
this doesn't even make any sense.

1968
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,880
It's like you want me to act?

1969
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:33,630
So you want me to learn some lines and
go and make a relationship with a casting

1970
00:54:33,631 --> 00:54:34,000
director.

1971
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,341
Okay,

1972
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:35,041
I get it.

1973
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:35,791
I guess I get it,

1974
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,140
but I didn't get it at all.

1975
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,010
So I would go there and I would
always feel bad after I leave.

1976
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:41,431
I be like,

1977
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:42,360
this is just,

1978
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:43,763
I had a,

1979
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,600
one time I went to this audition,

1980
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,610
it was one of the most
embarrassing moments ever.

1981
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:52,620
I went into his audition and this lady
was reading the audition and she was

1982
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:55,080
asking me where I was
from and I said that,

1983
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:55,380
uh,

1984
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,213
I'm from,

1985
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,010
uh,

1986
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:58,410
just moved from New York.

1987
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,191
I said,

1988
00:54:59,191 --> 00:54:59,371
but,

1989
00:54:59,371 --> 00:54:59,581
uh,

1990
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:00,031
I was,

1991
00:55:00,031 --> 00:55:00,360
uh,

1992
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,130
born in New Jersey and she said,

1993
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:03,240
I'm born in New Jersey too,

1994
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:04,260
but I don't tell anybody that.

1995
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:05,460
I tell them I'm from New York.

1996
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:06,541
I go,

1997
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:07,170
why?

1998
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,420
Why wouldn't you just tell them
that you're from New Jersey?

1999
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:10,501
And she goes,

2000
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:10,860
because,

2001
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,131
oh,

2002
00:55:11,131 --> 00:55:12,720
nobody wants to be from New Jersey.

2003
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:15,000
So I just tell them I'm
from New York and I go,

2004
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,440
that seems ridiculous.

2005
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:17,671
She goes,

2006
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:17,881
okay,

2007
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:18,720
do you want to read this?

2008
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,710
I go,

2009
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:21,390
all right.

2010
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:25,770
So I start reading it and she's given me
these like fucking dead eyes because I

2011
00:55:25,771 --> 00:55:28,470
insulted her need to be from New York.

2012
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,221
I'm mocked her.

2013
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:29,491
I mean,

2014
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:30,780
it was like the most,

2015
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:31,740
I was like,

2016
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,090
I was just talking to a person,

2017
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,150
like if you said that
to me and I'd be like,

2018
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:36,511
ah,

2019
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:36,841
yeah,

2020
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:38,010
why the fuck do I lie?

2021
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,670
Why do I tell everybody I'm from New York?

2022
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,100
Does that make me better than
if I was from New Jersey?

2023
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:45,330
Like I my that ridiculous.

2024
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,420
Instead of being proud
to be from New Jersey,

2025
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,490
so in this I have to sing to this chick,

2026
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,840
so I have to,

2027
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,880
I have to do these stupid lines.

2028
00:55:53,881 --> 00:55:55,800
Like I'm literally like,

2029
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,030
it's like a country western song.

2030
00:55:57,031 --> 00:56:01,800
I'm lake side with a girl and we have
like a blanket laid out and I have to sing

2031
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:05,910
a Bruce Springsteen song
to her and I died that day,

2032
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:08,250
shine in front of her.

2033
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:13,610
Like I felt my soul leaving my body as
I'm like trying to soulfully sing this

2034
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:16,020
Bruce Springsteen song,

2035
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:21,240
this woman who's looking at me like
I'm just a steaming sack of shit in her

2036
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:22,470
office and then when I'm done,

2037
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:22,711
she was,

2038
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:23,544
thanks.

2039
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,810
Did you try to save it at the end?

2040
00:56:25,811 --> 00:56:27,040
Like thank you again.

2041
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:28,930
I'm Joe Rogan from New York.

2042
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:29,741
No,

2043
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:30,760
I know it was death.

2044
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,613
That would be funny.

2045
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:32,561
No,

2046
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:33,394
it was dead,

2047
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,440
but I had to go through with it
anyway and I went through with it.

2048
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:35,710
I was like,

2049
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:36,700
oh my God,

2050
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,211
a man.

2051
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:40,450
Now imagine if your check and he'd go
into an audition and the dude tries to

2052
00:56:40,451 --> 00:56:41,284
fuck you.

2053
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,303
Right.

2054
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,200
Or you know,

2055
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,890
sexually harass you in some strange way.

2056
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,733
Mr Hinchcliffe.

2057
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,010
Yeah,

2058
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:48,251
I know.

2059
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:52,540
I imagine that could happen with you as
well under the right circumstances with

2060
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:54,040
a very aggressive gay man.

2061
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,660
Oh it ha.

2062
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,590
It could have happened.

2063
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:57,850
It could have.

2064
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:58,690
It could have,

2065
00:56:58,930 --> 00:56:59,561
but you what?

2066
00:56:59,561 --> 00:57:00,780
You'd be you I,

2067
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:05,280
when I get out of the room I don't
make direct eye contact with anybody.

2068
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,633
Kept your mouth shut.

2069
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,630
When I was auditioning

2070
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,140
for album,

2071
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,860
I got far along in the audition process
for book of Mormon at one point,

2072
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:15,430
which is like a big Broadway production.

2073
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,110
I got in the middle of it,

2074
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,040
kept doing good.

2075
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:18,400
Got It.

2076
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,570
Just kept moving on.

2077
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:22,150
You should have seen the lobby for that.

2078
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:22,800
My friend,

2079
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,410
a bunch of little twinks
trying to be Mormons or like,

2080
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:26,891
you know,

2081
00:57:26,891 --> 00:57:27,880
musical theater.

2082
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,110
You know what that means,

2083
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:29,730
right?

2084
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:30,563
Right.

2085
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,340
Do they do that thing with the,

2086
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,140
with the butts and the wieners?

2087
00:57:35,141 --> 00:57:36,180
Did you see there was an article,

2088
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,060
I think it was like Huffington post or
one of these recently about this upsurge

2089
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:41,350
in Mormon porn.

2090
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:43,510
Yeah.

2091
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:47,330
And that there's like Mormon
porn sites now to help every,

2092
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:47,850
every,

2093
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,870
everyone starts with a
boy knocking on the door.

2094
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,420
You're all like Mormon,

2095
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:52,931

2096
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:54,100

2098
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,430
And there's Mormon,

2099
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,660

Yeah.

2103
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:10,660
More than before.

2104
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,493
And here it is.

2105
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:13,923
There's,

2106
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:15,640
there's no bullshit.

2107
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,180
There's,

2108
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:16,361

I don't know if this is a,

2112
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,110
we don't know if that's,

2113
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,880
that's not the one that I
was looking at the article.

2114
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,580
The article was about this guy.

2115
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:26,601
What does that make you?

2116
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:27,431
The special effects?

2117
00:58:27,431 --> 00:58:28,270
These Mormons guy.

2118
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:30,670
The old cheese.

2119
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:31,504
Yeah.

2120
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,593
So these,

2121
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:37,700
um,

2122
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:41,890
this one guy was telling you
about his experience in camp,

2123
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:42,731
you know,

2124
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:43,061
with,

2125
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:43,480
uh,

2126
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,120
some other,

2127
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,590
like he realized he was gay when he was
gone to these Mormon camps with guys and

2128
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:50,800
he was attracted to him and just
took the right guy to make it happen.

2129
00:58:50,801 --> 00:58:51,960
And that's why he did,

2130
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:52,330
you know,

2131
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:53,680
he had such an exciting experience.

2132
00:58:53,681 --> 00:58:54,820
Now he's married with children.

2133
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,721
He's not gay,

2134
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:56,590
but wow.

2135
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:58,870
So this is the story.

2136
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,450
So he decided to make a Mormon.

2137
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:02,201
You have to click.

2138
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:03,340
Are you over 18,

2139
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:04,303
Brian?

2140
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:04,931
Click mentally.

2141
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:05,764
Brian,

2142
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,060
you have to say now,

2143
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:09,971
what would you say?

2144
00:59:09,971 --> 00:59:11,410
Like mentally you are like,

2145
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,110
it's 14 your maturity levels,

2146
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,660
but 18,

2147
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,710
18 intelligence still like Gi joes.

2148
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,111
So yeah.

2149
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:17,990
1818.

2150
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:18,540
That was it.

2151
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,120
That was it.

2152
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,350
That's what makes an eight team.

2153
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:21,561
Sarah,

2154
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:23,030
how old are you mentally?

2155
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:23,600
Yes.

2156
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,440
Um,

2157
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:25,881
it depends.

2158
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:28,220
Either I'm like 65 or 12.

2159
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:29,721
Yeah,

2160
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:30,554
that's a good answer.

2161
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,100
That's it.

2162
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,370
Like,

2163
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,121
so when you're tired,

2164
00:59:32,121 --> 00:59:32,954
you're 65.

2165
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:33,910
Yeah.

2166
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,050
Or having a good time or 12 or 12 like,

2167
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,800
yeah,

2168
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:43,880
I feel like I'm like just my age mentally.

2169
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:44,743
I don't know.

2170
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:46,010
In the moment chick.

2171
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,420
I'm 109 how'd that happen?

2172
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:54,230
It's paid too much attention to shit,

2173
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:55,610
dude here I think so.

2174
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,870
You've taken too many variables.

2175
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:58,640
I probably do.

2176
00:59:58,790 --> 00:59:59,623
Yeah.

2177
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,470
Well you're a,

2178
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,340
you're a bit obsessed.

2179
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:03,740
Tony Hinchcliffe could a bit
obsessed with the standup comedy

2180
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,170
with everything today.

2181
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,230
I thought I was dying
in the shower for sure.

2182
01:00:07,231 --> 01:00:10,710
I was 100% positive that I
was having an appendix attack.

2183
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,720
Like something like right in my,

2184
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,040
in my upper,

2185
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:15,780
I mean lower belly and I'm just like,

2186
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:17,190
this is that this is,

2187
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:21,920
I can convince myself that the worst
shit is happening and then what to,

2188
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,380
yeah.

2189
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,930
I mean I've been on the road with
him and it's happened a few times.

2190
01:00:24,931 --> 01:00:25,120
Right.

2191
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,880
So you're essentially a hypochondriac.

2192
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:27,714
Does that what it is?

2193
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,090
It's more of a panic attack type of thing,

2194
01:00:30,091 --> 01:00:32,820
but it's like not like
what you think a panic.

2195
01:00:32,821 --> 01:00:34,830
It's just all inside the head.

2196
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:35,370
Oh.

2197
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,000
And anyway,

2198
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,790
ended up fighting and then the
appendix attack was gone that fast.

2199
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,660
It was just one little
fourth second tutor.

2200
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:42,120
Rooney.

2201
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,130
I have had that happen.

2202
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,930
I've had that happen before.

2203
01:00:45,931 --> 01:00:47,460
You get a weird stomach pain,

2204
01:00:47,461 --> 01:00:47,701
you're like,

2205
01:00:47,701 --> 01:00:50,190
what the fuck is that like that's new.

2206
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,171
Yeah.

2207
01:00:51,171 --> 01:00:52,240
And when it's new,

2208
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:53,510
immediately my Amy,

2209
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,930
I'm sure you guys got to be the same
where it's like I've never felt that

2210
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:57,680
before.

2211
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,560
And that's gotta be something

2212
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:04,060
or just farts or what were you
eating all that Vegan food do?

2213
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:04,681
That's a problem.

2214
01:01:04,681 --> 01:01:07,500
It always ends up being a fart
by the way was my problems.

2215
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,930
Broccoli shit gets impacted.

2216
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:10,810
I had,

2217
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:14,130
I need to put a hole in my stomach's
that people can pull out the grains.

2218
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,570
Too many grains.

2219
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,750
I think that's essentially like
diverticulitis probably in a lot of ways.

2220
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:19,940
That's what happens to a,

2221
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:21,240
that's what happened at Brock Lesnar.

2222
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:21,660
Yeah.

2223
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,590
It happened to a few people.

2224
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:24,040
I know they had to get uh,

2225
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:25,590
parts of their colon removed.

2226
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,191
Oh yeah.

2227
01:01:26,191 --> 01:01:26,800
One guy know,

2228
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,470
caught it before it got too bad,

2229
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,360
but you just get impacted.

2230
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:31,111
And uh,

2231
01:01:31,111 --> 01:01:34,170
Anthony Bordain was telling me that it
can be anything he said he could like be

2232
01:01:34,171 --> 01:01:36,570
like a pumpkin seed or
something gets stuck in there.

2233
01:01:36,571 --> 01:01:37,490
Like he eats something,

2234
01:01:37,491 --> 01:01:39,350
gets stuck and then it creates an abscess.

2235
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:39,930
Is like,

2236
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,710
it's not just meet like with Brock Lesnar,

2237
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,541
supposedly it was just,

2238
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:43,520
he all he ate was meat.

2239
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:47,790
Like it wasn't eating any fiber and his
bowels get all fucked up because of it.

2240
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:48,301
Yeah.

2241
01:01:48,301 --> 01:01:49,060
Whoa,

2242
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:49,590
wow.

2243
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,220
Yeah.

2244
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:50,820
You got to eat.

2245
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,380
Like you have to eat healthy,

2246
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,851
you know,

2247
01:01:53,851 --> 01:01:55,590
like fiber's important for your body.

2248
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:56,250
It's not,

2249
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,570
it's not just a luxury,

2250
01:01:57,571 --> 01:01:58,500
it's a necessity.

2251
01:01:58,501 --> 01:02:00,210
Like if you want this thing to work right,

2252
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:01,044
you gotta eat lettuce,

2253
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,490
it's got a push everything out.

2254
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,000
Yeah.

2255
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,260
Yeah.

2256
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,093
And when you don't,

2257
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:04,771
it can really,

2258
01:02:04,771 --> 01:02:07,290
and then there's some people that get
it to just have a propensity for it

2259
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:08,100
apparently.

2260
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:08,700
But when they,

2261
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:12,480
when they have to remove like
sections of your intestines and Shit,

2262
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:14,493
Oh God,

2263
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:18,290
clean my bedroom the other day
and I have a pretty big bed.

2264
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:19,650
But underneath bed

2265
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,180
it's like in the middle,

2266
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:22,860
you never can get anything on,

2267
01:02:22,861 --> 01:02:23,071
you know,

2268
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:24,640
like if something falls under the bed.

2269
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:29,160
So I was trying to get everything and
I pulled out a single cheeseburger from

2270
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:33,090
Mcdonald's that I guess
I was eating and I threw,

2271
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:34,380
I threw it on the ground or something.

2272
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:36,750
And it just went in there
and get like to you,

2273
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:37,560
I know budget,

2274
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,400
how can you live?

2275
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:43,780
Like I haven't had mcdonalds in my bed
for at least six months and so that,

2276
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,240
but when I opened it,

2277
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,380
it looked brand new.

2278
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:48,120
It looked just exactly the same.

2279
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:52,420
You would buy that perfect apartments
like the raft of a survivor stranded at

2280
01:02:52,421 --> 01:02:53,220
sea.

2281
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:58,220
It's just scattered disarray with
bobbers and nets and one shoe

2282
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,650
pirate in the corner for some reason.

2283
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:02,821
Yeah,

2284
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:07,140
that big area in the middle we can't
reach under your bed area is a problem.

2285
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:07,921
It's disgusting it.

2286
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:09,060
Cause if you ever do move,

2287
01:03:09,061 --> 01:03:09,960
you bed your bed,

2288
01:03:09,961 --> 01:03:11,140
you're like looking at it going,

2289
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:12,150
that's so gross.

2290
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:14,220
How much would I have
to pay you to lick that?

2291
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:16,830
The center area we can't reach.

2292
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,840
Just do the whole line.

2293
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,900
All the line up from the head to the
keep your tongue down on the ground from

2294
01:03:24,331 --> 01:03:25,800
the foot of the bed to
the head of the bed.

2295
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:26,634
Like an Imac.

2296
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,610
It would only take an imac
to get you to do that.

2297
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:31,623
Hell yeah.

2298
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:32,463
Wow.

2299
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,760
What about Ipad mini?

2300
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:34,451
I licked,

2301
01:03:34,451 --> 01:03:35,990
I licked the stripper pole.

2302
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:40,360
I licked the stripper pole at a crazy
girl as a couple of months ago on stage.

2303
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,430
We were doing comedy there.

2304
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:43,090
Uh,

2305
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:47,500
and I just said some hot girl
just got off and I was like,

2306
01:03:47,501 --> 01:03:47,771
damn,

2307
01:03:47,771 --> 01:03:48,371
that girl is hot.

2308
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:50,230
And I just like licked it as a joke.

2309
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:51,123
Everyone was like,

2310
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,570
but then I thought about it and then I
had like a canker on my time for like

2311
01:03:55,571 --> 01:03:56,404
three days.

2312
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:57,760
Yeah.

2313
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,640
Welcome to the wonderful
world of new age canker.

2314
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,840
I was freaked out for a couple
of days but it was so hilarious.

2315
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:06,700
That is so hilarious.

2316
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:09,670
David Arquette owns that place
now and I told him like he would,

2317
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:12,790
he did kill Tony and I told him about
that and you just give me a high five.

2318
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:13,630
He's like that's great.

2319
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:14,703
That's hilarious.

2320
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:16,040
He owns a strip club.

2321
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:20,200
And what a good mood for a fucking
celebrity that's just getting divorced.

2322
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:23,440
What an excellent move.

2323
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,880
And that place is a,

2324
01:04:24,881 --> 01:04:26,220
they do comedy occasionally there.

2325
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:29,050
Yeah they do shows art
like music sometimes.

2326
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:32,200
And she calmed me that it's totally
not set up for comedy though.

2327
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,470
Cause they have like a strobe
light facing the comic.

2328
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,980
So you're onstage and you're just having
elliptic Caesar's and you can't see

2329
01:04:38,981 --> 01:04:39,814
anything.

2330
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:41,540
Whatever that is.

2331
01:04:41,541 --> 01:04:43,020
It click elliptical seizures,

2332
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:44,981
epileptic.

2333
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:49,981
He Fuck [inaudible] lip ellipses.

2334
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,780
That sounds uh,

2335
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,700
that sounds terrible.

2336
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,880
Yeah.

2337
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,390
And uh,

2338
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:55,691
it's,

2339
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:56,524
it's a,

2340
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,760
the ceiling cuts down so it's like chops
the top part of your head off so they

2341
01:05:00,761 --> 01:05:01,600
can't even see you.

2342
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:02,090
Oh,

2343
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:02,923
part of your head.

2344
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:05,063
Yeah.

2345
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,640
Oh yeah.

2346
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,530
We'll just do your comedy on your knees.

2347
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:13,330
Lifted you comedy like as a
like to like a dancer's routine.

2348
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,501
Do your comedy,

2349
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:18,160
like don't even like talk about the fact
that got your leg wrapped around the

2350
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:19,570
pole when you're going around in circles,

2351
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:21,820
talking about your day

2352
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,120
doing stupid style.

2353
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,110
There's a lot of those cool little spots
in Hollywood though that aren't what

2354
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:29,860
you think they are.

2355
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:30,131
You know,

2356
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:31,300
it looks like it would be like,

2357
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:32,290
it's like kind of a hangout.

2358
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,410
Aren't you doing a the spot tonight or the

2359
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:37,920
Watkins?

2360
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,071
Yeah,

2361
01:05:38,071 --> 01:05:38,440
that's a little,

2362
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:38,920
where's it at?

2363
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,753
What's it called?

2364
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:40,960
Three of three o'clock.

2365
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,000
A cool little realm.

2366
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:43,631
It really,

2367
01:05:43,631 --> 01:05:44,321
really is.

2368
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:44,510
I,

2369
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:45,041
it's a,

2370
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:45,970
it's just like this,

2371
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,710
it's like a cool hip bar.

2372
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:48,520
Um,

2373
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:53,010
and then you go through these double
doors and it's a cool showroom.

2374
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,240
One of my favorite little show
rooms and all of Hollywood.

2375
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:55,750
Nice.

2376
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:55,891
Yeah,

2377
01:05:55,891 --> 01:05:56,724
it's really neat.

2378
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,460
Yeah.

2379
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:01,510
And he's doing one of those
like Thunderpussy style
shows that people yell out

2380
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:03,550
topics and you discussed them.

2381
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:04,300
Yeah,

2382
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,133
that's fine.

2383
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,113
Yeah.

2384
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,020
Yeah.

2385
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:07,510
Should be fun.

2386
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:07,631
Well,

2387
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,081
fund your post.

2388
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:09,400
He's a really fun show to do it too.

2389
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,380
And if you have the right
crowd and it's right.

2390
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:11,891
Exactly.

2391
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:12,820
And this show,

2392
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:14,110
because it's in Hollywood,

2393
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:18,730
so the audience is a little more open
than a Pasadena crowd who's a little bit

2394
01:06:18,731 --> 01:06:19,481
more outside.

2395
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:22,720
So the crowds are always a little
bit better for this than for,

2396
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:23,860
you know,

2397
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:24,400
the passenger,

2398
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:24,641
I mean,

2399
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:25,480
not good.

2400
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,890
They're not necessarily a better crowd.

2401
01:06:26,891 --> 01:06:29,260
There were more interactive crowd to
give you the topics that you need,

2402
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:29,860
like a better,

2403
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,340
like a better group of suggestion.

2404
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:31,690
Right,

2405
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,231
exactly.

2406
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:34,330
A little bit wide open with suggestions.

2407
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:35,051
Yeah.

2408
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:37,150
You can't get a better
crowd than the ice house.

2409
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:39,460
Literally don't think it's possible.

2410
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:40,270
Exactly.

2411
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:41,260
What only was possible.

2412
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,390
They're so good and like everybody,

2413
01:06:43,391 --> 01:06:44,440
they're so nice too.

2414
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:48,820
It's just like the whole like
storm of coolness there last night.

2415
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:49,870
It was so much fucking fun,

2416
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:50,704
man.

2417
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:51,250
Yeah.

2418
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,180
That's a great audience.

2419
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,130
It was pretty powerful.

2420
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,430
That was amazing last night.

2421
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:58,493
Yeah.

2422
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:58,910
Good God.

2423
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:00,670
Damn time Tommy should grow.

2424
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:01,540
It was killing me.

2425
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:02,650
Oh my God.

2426
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:03,484
He's funny.

2427
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,130
Thompson Gora is a god
damn monster right now.

2428
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,170
He's just getting funnier all the time.

2429
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:09,211
Just all the time.

2430
01:07:09,211 --> 01:07:10,330
It's constantly working at it.

2431
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:13,130
Ian Edwards to slayed it.

2432
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,950
Slided last night.

2433
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:18,310
Have you seen bill burns and
new special now go get it.

2434
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:19,360
Really?

2435
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,193
It's amazing.

2436
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:21,063
It's really good.

2437
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:21,993
It's really fun.

2438
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:25,090
It's like like actual bill bar,

2439
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,230
like doing a set.

2440
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,120
It doesn't seem like you're
doing a special at all.

2441
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,180
I like sometimes you've seen people do
specials and they look like a little more

2442
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:33,400
tense than they do when they're,

2443
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:33,791
you know,

2444
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:35,500
they're just doing a set burden.

2445
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,250
Nailed it.

2446
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,180
It's totally him.

2447
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,253
It's awesome.

2448
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,280
It's like black and white,

2449
01:07:39,281 --> 01:07:39,640
right?

2450
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:39,811
Yeah.

2451
01:07:39,811 --> 01:07:40,760
I just wanted to do a black and white.

2452
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,220
Yeah.

2453
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:42,401
Yeah.

2454
01:07:42,401 --> 01:07:44,920
He said he's decided that
like everything's to HD.

2455
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,120
It's like everything's like,

2456
01:07:46,121 --> 01:07:46,600
you know,

2457
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:51,600
so much focus on high resolution and
looking at things like he just decided to

2458
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:53,230
go old school to a black and white.

2459
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,433
The jokes.

2460
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,470
How long before you guys
decide to put something out?

2461
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:58,780
I want to make sure it's really,

2462
01:07:58,781 --> 01:08:00,220
really good before I do,

2463
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:01,373
I'm still so new.

2464
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:02,363
Right?

2465
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:03,280
Yeah.

2466
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,350
I'm just scared to do anything too early.

2467
01:08:05,351 --> 01:08:07,090
Everyone keeps telling me to take my time.

2468
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,020
Do you have a timeline?

2469
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:13,950
I want to not be working a
day job within the next year.

2470
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:15,740
To him that's ambitious.

2471
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,830
So like two years in a comedy.

2472
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,673
No Day job.

2473
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:20,840
Maybe two and a half years.

2474
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:22,910
That's ambitious as fuck.

2475
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:23,421
Yeah.

2476
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:23,961
I want it to,

2477
01:08:23,961 --> 01:08:24,201
I mean,

2478
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:27,410
just doing enough to just like survive.

2479
01:08:27,411 --> 01:08:29,720
Obviously not being like touring and,

2480
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:30,350
right.

2481
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:30,621
Right,

2482
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:30,781
right.

2483
01:08:30,781 --> 01:08:32,150
Just like not working a day job.

2484
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,380
Yeah.

2485
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,520
And stuff like that.

2486
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:35,240
It's hard.

2487
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,830
How long before you quit your job?

2488
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:38,790
MMM,

2489
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,050
I was,

2490
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:40,380
well,

2491
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,510
I got a job working at the comedy store,

2492
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:44,880
so I went solo just with that.

2493
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:45,360
Yeah,

2494
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,193
for,

2495
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:46,650
yeah,

2496
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:47,483
for

2497
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:49,800
four years.

2498
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,690
Just made enough money
to get by working there.

2499
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:56,830
He at just just barely enough money to
get by because back then wasn't the same

2500
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,670
exact regime of managers.

2501
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:00,001
Right.

2502
01:09:00,001 --> 01:09:03,540
And what was happening before
where they were notorious for um,

2503
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:06,600
for shaving hours that
you'd actually work.

2504
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:11,370
And back then there were
also was literally one fifth
as many employees as there

2505
01:09:11,371 --> 01:09:11,761
is now.

2506
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:16,260
So I was one of like five guys that was
working phones during the day and then

2507
01:09:16,261 --> 01:09:17,640
working the door at night.

2508
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:19,320
So I was struggling.

2509
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:20,280
Wow.

2510
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,340
I wasn't even getting what I was working.

2511
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,700
Those stories are so cool though.

2512
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:25,290
When someone goes from being a doorman,

2513
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:29,400
like Ari goes from being a doorman at
the comedy store doing his comedy central

2514
01:09:29,401 --> 01:09:31,140
special at the comedy store.

2515
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,400
[inaudible] you know,

2516
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:34,070
and then the name of it he liked,

2517
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,760
he made it paid regular.

2518
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:36,683
That was the name.

2519
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,280
Cause like that was always the thing.

2520
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,740
Like he wanted to become a paid regular.

2521
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:42,390
Do you worked at it for like four and a
half years before she finally got him in

2522
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:43,643
[inaudible]

2523
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:44,800
but it's,

2524
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,950
that's such a great story.

2525
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:50,980
Like going from a guy just with an idea
in his head who started doing open mics

2526
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:54,530
and from there become a
professional comedian.

2527
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,640
I mean working the door,

2528
01:09:55,641 --> 01:09:56,690
worked in the cover booth,

2529
01:09:56,691 --> 01:09:57,471
doing all that shit,

2530
01:09:57,471 --> 01:09:58,400
answering phones,

2531
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,050
doing all the shit the comics do.

2532
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:05,030
Like that's one of the few places in the
country where comics go from just being

2533
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:07,930
employees of the club to
like national headliners.

2534
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,570
Yeah.

2535
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:10,010
Same thing with rand is easy.

2536
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:10,520
Yes.

2537
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,040
It was just finishing
up when I was arriving.

2538
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:14,780
Like he wasn't working there anymore.

2539
01:10:14,781 --> 01:10:18,560
But you heard that he would
talk about working there?

2540
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:19,290
Yes.

2541
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:20,340
Like I met him,

2542
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,740
he worked there and now
I know as a TV star.

2543
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:23,940
Yeah.

2544
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,320
I would come by to do sets.

2545
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:28,560
I think when I was on news radio or
maybe it might've been fear factor.

2546
01:10:28,561 --> 01:10:30,060
I don't know which one it
was when I first met him.

2547
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:30,740
Hold on.

2548
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:31,770
When Brenda's easy start.

2549
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:33,900
I'm not sure.

2550
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:34,081
Oh,

2551
01:10:34,081 --> 01:10:34,980
I know exactly when.

2552
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:35,431
Actually,

2553
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:38,640
it was November of 2011 because he was in,

2554
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:42,960
he was in one of the towers when the
plane set on September 11th and he's like,

2555
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:43,680
fuck it.

2556
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:43,861
Well,

2557
01:10:43,861 --> 01:10:44,010
no,

2558
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:44,071
no,

2559
01:10:44,071 --> 01:10:44,191
no.

2560
01:10:44,191 --> 01:10:46,740
That's not what he started
doing comedy right after that?

2561
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:47,311
No,

2562
01:10:47,311 --> 01:10:50,820
because he was in the Carlos Mencia
video and that was 2007 I think you mean

2563
01:10:50,821 --> 01:10:53,700
2001 is when timber 11 to Hollywood.

2564
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,860
September 11 2001 yeah,

2565
01:10:55,861 --> 01:10:56,490
that's what I'm saying.

2566
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:56,701
Yeah.

2567
01:10:56,701 --> 01:10:58,110
You said 2011 oh,

2568
01:10:58,111 --> 01:10:58,440
okay.

2569
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:58,621
Yeah.

2570
01:10:58,621 --> 01:10:59,970
You said that timber 11 yeah.

2571
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,300
Gotcha.

2572
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:00,541
I know,

2573
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:01,374
I forget.

2574
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:04,230
It's hard to believe at nine
11 was 13 almost 14 years.

2575
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,010
Wow.

2576
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:05,521
That's weird.

2577
01:11:05,521 --> 01:11:05,800
Right?

2578
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,633
That's crazy.

2579
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,150
Do you think time is moving faster?

2580
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:10,103
Yes.

2581
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:11,303
Oh my God.

2582
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,150
Perfect dancer.

2583
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,930
That was probing stoner talk.

2584
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:18,061
Oh my God,

2585
01:11:18,061 --> 01:11:18,894
yes.

2586
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:23,880
Followed by a long run on sentence
where I throw in a bunch of likes,

2587
01:11:23,881 --> 01:11:24,960
so like I was like,

2588
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:27,720
maybe like time is like different

2589
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:31,410
me.

2590
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:34,100
I was freaking out about
the Berenstain bears,

2591
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,600
the spelling of the last name.

2592
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:36,410
Yeah,

2593
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:37,243
it's different.

2594
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,070
It's different and it
wasn't always like that.

2595
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,293
It's always been like that

2596
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:45,760
and it's stain.

2597
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:47,350
Wait,

2598
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,183
wait,

2599
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:52,101
what is it?

2600
01:11:52,101 --> 01:11:53,360
What do they call it in the Matrix?

2601
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,860
In the matrix

2602
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,110
spelled like stain

2603
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:01,653
stain,

2604
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:05,090
but I swear it was
Berenstein I've been cost.

2605
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,240
Most people don't know what the fuck

2606
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:10,221
we're talking about.

2607
01:12:10,221 --> 01:12:13,070
A series of children's children's books.

2608
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:18,880
I said barren Steen and someone corrected
me and then I looked at it and I was

2609
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:19,670
like,

2610
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:20,503
oh yeah,

2611
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:21,530
Ooh.

2612
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:23,270
Like why did I think it said steam?

2613
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,700
It was like I didn't
continue the sentence.

2614
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:28,310
I got to Barron's and
there's an end of the end.

2615
01:12:28,311 --> 01:12:28,990
I'm like steam.

2616
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:29,823
It must be seen.

2617
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:30,530
Like I didn't,

2618
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:32,870
I didn't even like attempt to read it.

2619
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:36,980
Like I realize like sometimes words are
so similar to other words that you don't

2620
01:12:36,981 --> 01:12:37,814
really read them.

2621
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:38,361
You kind of know,

2622
01:12:38,361 --> 01:12:39,230
oh I know what that is,

2623
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,390
but you don't go and you just,

2624
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:41,661
oh,

2625
01:12:41,661 --> 01:12:42,411
Barron's dean,

2626
01:12:42,411 --> 01:12:46,790
you know Wolfowitz if you saw like
Wolfowitz but like one of the letters was

2627
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:47,360
different,

2628
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,850
you'd still probably say
Wolfowitz cause you put it in.

2629
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,090
I go and I've seen that before
and he just looked to save time.

2630
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:53,691
You know,

2631
01:12:53,691 --> 01:12:53,871
you,

2632
01:12:53,871 --> 01:12:54,150
you,

2633
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:54,740
you say it.

2634
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:57,440
So for all of us that thought,

2635
01:12:57,441 --> 01:13:00,080
I mean it was just one of those things
like you never really read the word.

2636
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:01,123
Did you pull it up

2637
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,550
Congress if though right?

2638
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:05,460
Isn't that what we did?

2639
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:07,840
We talk about this curse too much.

2640
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:09,410
It's just show these,

2641
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:11,720
well I bet show that ease people at home.

2642
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:12,670
What the fuck we're talking about.

2643
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:13,670
I thought it was a neat too,

2644
01:13:13,671 --> 01:13:16,360
so I bet it's one of those curse
a phase that looks like and

2645
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:18,920
I don't think it is man.

2646
01:13:18,921 --> 01:13:21,230
I think it's just the way
it's a straight up stain.

2647
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:22,663
Something happens.

2648
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:25,853
Something happens,

2649
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,260
seriously convinced for so long.

2650
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:31,280
I went like three days just like
looking like a crazy person.

2651
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,390
Bernstein bears.

2652
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:35,221
No,

2653
01:13:35,221 --> 01:13:35,750
it doesn't.

2654
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,460
It looks like that a should be an e.

2655
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,900
But I think it's one of those things you
just sort of chunk those words together

2656
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:42,760
that lettered the,

2657
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,120
all those letters in your memory.

2658
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:49,140
I remember that there was a ais.

2659
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:51,640
I think that,

2660
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:52,483
uh,

2661
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,200
I think it's one of
those things you don't,

2662
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,100
you just don't read it.

2663
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,123
If everyone was already

2664
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:58,953
fuck,

2665
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,830
name his last name.

2666
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:01,820
I don't know.

2667
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,920
So stupid in this Dane.

2668
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,070
You good say what's wrong
with Barrett's thing?

2669
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:07,901
That's silly.

2670
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:09,700
Bernstein is just as ridiculous.

2671
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:10,151
Well,

2672
01:14:10,151 --> 01:14:12,040
I thought it was
Berenstain the whole time.

2673
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:16,420
It must be one of those tracks where it
was like you see two e's before and then

2674
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:18,200
you think the third one's
gotta be an easier thing.

2675
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,300
It's like pop and soda.

2676
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:21,420
I think that just where
you're like your mom,

2677
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:22,330
your parents where it's like,

2678
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:22,481
yeah.

2679
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:23,420
Marin's stain.

2680
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:29,050
Oh well that would make sense.

2681
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:33,500
Berenstein Berenstain and you'd say dean.

2682
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:34,320
Yeah.

2683
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,170
What'd I say?

2684
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:39,670
Getting to be more and more.

2685
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:43,330
He'll bill t e I n it strictly,

2686
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:44,690
what's the name of those Jew?

2687
01:14:44,691 --> 01:14:45,524
Bayer's

2688
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:49,463
Barron.

2689
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:56,670
Yeah.

2690
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:00,160
It's like you ever wonder like why
certain languages came up with certain,

2691
01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:05,161
sounds like some languages have
beautiful flowing melodic sounds to them.

2692
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:07,540
Like they have like a rhythm to them.

2693
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,520
Like if you ever heard
someone speaking Portuguese,

2694
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:11,140
like the Brazilians
that speaks Portuguese,

2695
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,800
it's such a cool sound language,

2696
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,080
Blah bishop.

2697
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:19,180
Whether they have this like sort of like
almost like they're dancing like this

2698
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,160
flow to it and then you'll hear like,

2699
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:26,310
like some like really harsh German
[inaudible] Bush didn't like really like,

2700
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:27,803
yeah,

2701
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:31,870
it's like this weird sort of like guttural
and then like you know some of the

2702
01:15:31,871 --> 01:15:33,700
Sephardic languages and it's,

2703
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:34,560
yeah,

2704
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,420
it's some crazy ass noises.

2705
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:39,280
You know Canadians a,

2706
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:41,150
Oh that's about as normal as you get.

2707
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:44,850
Add a little a to some words about it.

2708
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,770
They're just a little far up north.

2709
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:48,790
They're all too,

2710
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:49,810
don't be picking out Canadian.

2711
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:52,540
The bear chosen people
as far as I'm concerned.

2712
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:56,080
The Berenstain bears had this one book
called new neighbors and I always thought

2713
01:15:56,081 --> 01:16:00,430
it seemed racist because it was like
Asian panda bears that moved in and look

2714
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,110
how angry the dad is.

2715
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:05,740
He's like Asians moving
in next door and bears,

2716
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,050
oh that's hilarious.

2717
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:10,960
They went with pandas madness

2718
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:17,550
looking good damn weirdos building in
moves it build their Chinese restaurant

2719
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,770
where neighbors

2720
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,150
who have an oriental rug,

2721
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:28,560
it's hilarious.

2722
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:31,730
They're even wearing
kind of like colorful,

2723
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:33,020
festive Chinese colors.

2724
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:36,400
Those are definitely Chinese outfits.

2725
01:16:36,401 --> 01:16:37,480
Like look at how it's cut.

2726
01:16:37,481 --> 01:16:40,030
And it's like the shirts go
all the way up to the chin.

2727
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:44,260
Fucking panda bears all wearing the same.

2728
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:46,360
If somebody tried to release that today,

2729
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,640
like salon.com would be all over it.

2730
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,133
Yeah.

2731
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:52,270
Subtle racism and children's stories.

2732
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,680
Why it's wrong.

2733
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:57,170
Yeah.

2734
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:58,090
Finding racist.

2735
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:59,830
But I think that is exactly what that was.

2736
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:01,000
I mean,

2737
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,020
that's not clever.

2738
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:05,140
They're not hiding that panda.

2739
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:06,520
But why isn't it black pairs?

2740
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:07,623
You guys are Brown.

2741
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:08,710
Have some black bears move in.

2742
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:09,050
No.

2743
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:09,883
Too Edgy

2744
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:11,870
against black people.

2745
01:17:11,871 --> 01:17:12,471
Exactly.

2746
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:13,640
So they had to go with pandas.

2747
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,650
Is Asians fucking,

2748
01:17:15,651 --> 01:17:19,100
they keep their eye on their business
and they fucking keep moving forward.

2749
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,360
They don't riot.

2750
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,950
Asian people don't close off the fucking
four oh five they're nice and they get

2751
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:25,784
things done.

2752
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:26,061
Okay.

2753
01:17:26,061 --> 01:17:27,680
They don't get caught up in bullshit.

2754
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,550
But if you,

2755
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:29,870
if you use black bears,

2756
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:30,763
boy,

2757
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:33,653
dark skin,

2758
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:35,900
light skin did bears versus dark skin.

2759
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,910
But polar bears come in
and fuck up everything.

2760
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,590
They've chose.

2761
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,020
Black and white ethnically ambiguous

2762
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:44,740
skin.

2763
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:45,573
Yes.

2764
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:46,520
That's crazy.

2765
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:46,860
Their hair.

2766
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:47,693
It's clear.

2767
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,010
It's not actually white.

2768
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:49,903
It's clear.

2769
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:51,130
Yeah.

2770
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:51,770
Yeah.

2771
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:54,290
See if he could pull up a
picture of polar bear skin.

2772
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,190
Polar bear hair.

2773
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,140
Clear polar bear hair clear.

2774
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:57,561
Yeah.

2775
01:17:57,561 --> 01:17:58,011
It's weird.

2776
01:17:58,011 --> 01:17:58,521
It's like a,

2777
01:17:58,521 --> 01:17:59,121
almost like,

2778
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:02,360
you know those fibers that
they use those light fibers.

2779
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,733
You know what I'm saying?

2780
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:05,350
Yeah,

2781
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:05,660
yeah,

2782
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,320
yeah.

2783
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,280
The fiber optics,

2784
01:18:07,281 --> 01:18:08,114
like that kind of shit.

2785
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,410
I mean that's what it looks like almost.

2786
01:18:09,411 --> 01:18:09,771
It's like a,

2787
01:18:09,771 --> 01:18:11,030
a natural white,

2788
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,430
but it's like a natural clear rather.

2789
01:18:13,431 --> 01:18:14,690
But altogether they look white.

2790
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:16,760
Well,

2791
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,481
is there a bald,

2792
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:19,700
is there a picture of like a bald skin,

2793
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,680
but see if you could pull up a polar bear.

2794
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:23,180
Heres a ball.

2795
01:18:23,181 --> 01:18:23,661
Polar bear.

2796
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:24,950
I don't think they don't live.

2797
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,950
Like some bears get
mange and they survive,

2798
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:32,230
but polar bears live
exclusively in polar habitat.

2799
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,650
That's what their hair looks like.

2800
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:35,810
That's not a good picture.

2801
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:37,060
But you get a sense of it.

2802
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:37,310
It's,

2803
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:39,110
it's more clear that it
does look pretty white,

2804
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:42,110
but apparently it's
clear like technically,

2805
01:18:42,111 --> 01:18:44,540
so there's just a
complete absence of color.

2806
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:47,870
So then they take all those together
and they look white when they're on the

2807
01:18:47,871 --> 01:18:48,704
animal.

2808
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:49,250
Yeah,

2809
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,120
I mean it is white.

2810
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:51,560
Obviously it's white,

2811
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,560
but they think they consider it clear,

2812
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:59,860
so our brain reads it as white
Berenstain bears these days.

2813
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,540
Awful to grow up with

2814
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:11,060
these racist parents writing
these polar bear bucks.

2815
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:16,040
Imagine what kind of Shit life you
must've led to come back as a polar bear.

2816
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:17,960
What a Dick.

2817
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:21,830
Can you say that you say that
you don't want to live up there?

2818
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:23,450
It sounds like a lonely world.

2819
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,110
You can always come back as like a magnet

2820
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,360
that would suck worse.

2821
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:32,720
Someone has the glass half full.

2822
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:38,030
Yeah,

2823
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:40,160
but being a polar bear
would be especially sucky.

2824
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:40,850
Yeah.

2825
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:41,750
Freezing cold,

2826
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:43,220
jumping in the water all the time.

2827
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:44,960
All you're eating is like seals,

2828
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,790
shit and drinking coca cola.

2829
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,410
What would you do for a Klondike Bar?

2830
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,990
I think you could be fun.

2831
01:19:53,991 --> 01:19:56,150
There could be some
positives like name them,

2832
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,890
like sliding around on the ice.

2833
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,120
You can do that.

2834
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,090
You can do that and you're a
person throwing up bear party.

2835
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:04,370
They'd get more hurt as a person.

2836
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:06,950
You would get more hurt sliding around.

2837
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:08,070
You'd be less durable.

2838
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:08,460
Yeah,

2839
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,010
like just the thought of sliding
around on my polar bear belly.

2840
01:20:11,011 --> 01:20:12,300
That would be super fun.

2841
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,583
Oh,

2842
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,450
you ever did the,

2843
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:15,631
uh,

2844
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:16,830
the slip and slide?

2845
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,173
Oh yeah.

2846
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,193
Done it.

2847
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:19,561
Yeah.

2848
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:19,681
Well,

2849
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,180
I haven't done it in quite some time,

2850
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:22,201
but yes,

2851
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:23,034
I've done it.

2852
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:26,440
It's a child's game actually.

2853
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:27,570
Get everyone's done it right.

2854
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,291
It has never been done.

2855
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:29,124
Slipping side.

2856
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:33,450
That's not something you like trying
to shock them with your knowledge thing

2857
01:20:33,451 --> 01:20:34,710
that I did when I was young.

2858
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:36,730
There's an adult one that they are,

2859
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:38,540
they're trying to actually put a,

2860
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:39,960
it's called slide the city.

2861
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:40,381
Uh,

2862
01:20:40,381 --> 01:20:41,191
and there actually where you,

2863
01:20:41,191 --> 01:20:45,300
it's adult slipped inside throughout
the whole entire city of Los Angeles.

2864
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:48,930
They got a water slide in Brazil
where you go like 55 miles an hour.

2865
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,100
That's awesome.

2866
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,510
The fastest water slide.

2867
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:53,940
See if you could pull up the
fastest waterslide Brazil.

2868
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,080
That's a giant slip and slide.

2869
01:20:55,081 --> 01:20:55,621
That's hilarious.

2870
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:57,150
The whole city of Los Angeles.

2871
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:00,090
So you slide through the
whole city and one push.

2872
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:00,630
No,

2873
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:03,420
I think it's the water moves you a little,

2874
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:04,380
but oh,

2875
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:05,850
and we all can't shower for a week.

2876
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,290
You gotta be careful about waterparks.

2877
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:13,740
I know a chick whose daughter got sick
from a waterpark and she want to be in

2878
01:21:13,741 --> 01:21:14,820
partially paralyzed.

2879
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:17,970
She had some sort of infection getting
into her ear and it became like

2880
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:19,350
meningitis or something like that.

2881
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,170
Waterparks can get nasty man.

2882
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,560
All these little kids are shit in that
water and all these weird people are

2883
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:27,510
traveling around in their diseases.

2884
01:21:27,511 --> 01:21:29,370
It's just a breeding ground for bacteria.

2885
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,960
That's why when you go to a lot of them,

2886
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:36,170
they just reek of chemicals to just
pour in fucking coring and that water to

2887
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:38,280
kill everything and you
get in and you're like,

2888
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:38,761
Whoa,

2889
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:40,500
like I'm bathing in chemicals here.

2890
01:21:40,501 --> 01:21:42,060
This doesn't even feel like water.

2891
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:43,163
You know?

2892
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:45,660
And it's kind of warm too.

2893
01:21:45,661 --> 01:21:49,770
There's a bunch of people in the water
and warm water and everyone's just pissed

2894
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:50,604
and

2895
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,370
can see like the sunblock splotches.

2896
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,330
They should do like they should take like
a scoop and bring it to a lab and find

2897
01:22:00,331 --> 01:22:02,520
out exactly how much of that
water is pissed and shit.

2898
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,940
It's like a measurable amount.

2899
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,833
I'll admit I do it

2900
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,140
get the worse.

2901
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,860
They just have this thing
at the admit you do it.

2902
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:14,723
Yeah.

2903
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:16,500
If I'm in in that like a waterpark.

2904
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:17,881
Oh fuck.

2905
01:22:17,881 --> 01:22:18,130
Yeah.

2906
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:19,200
It's like when in Rome.

2907
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,310
I mean it feels good for the p around.

2908
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,213
It's warm.

2909
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,210
You're trying to be silly or do you
really pay when you go to a waterpark?

2910
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:28,260
Yeah,

2911
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,011
I think he does.

2912
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:30,630
I don't even think he's in
the pool when he does it.

2913
01:22:30,631 --> 01:22:33,030
I think he's standing outside
of the pool and do it.

2914
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,490
He's the guy which is pissing his pants.

2915
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,353
Jumps in the water,

2916
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,300
wait till a kid swim spa.

2917
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:42,950
Wait,

2918
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:44,700
Kid Swims by and you pee on kids.

2919
01:22:44,701 --> 01:22:45,330
Is that what you're saying?

2920
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:45,571
Yeah,

2921
01:22:45,571 --> 01:22:47,100
it's like blowing a fighter on a kid.

2922
01:22:47,101 --> 01:22:47,850
That's hilarious.

2923
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:48,950
Have you ever heard her on a kid?

2924
01:22:48,951 --> 01:22:51,670
There's a big difference being blown
apart on a kid and pissing on him.

2925
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,363
Okay.

2926
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:55,063
And your parents,

2927
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:55,620
kids.

2928
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,870
Parents might be upset
if you fart on their kid,

2929
01:22:58,260 --> 01:22:59,810
they'll beat your ass
if you're peeing on him,

2930
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:00,810
but they can never tell.

2931
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:02,550
It's the only Legal Way to pee on a kid.

2932
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:04,370
What do you mean they can never tell them?

2933
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,250
They will never know if I pee on the kid.

2934
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:06,881
Is it illegal?

2935
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:07,450
Appear on here.

2936
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:10,720
It definitely is a legal to PR on a kid
unless you're in a Kelly doesn't seem to

2937
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:11,554
think it is.

2938
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,340
Well,

2939
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,690
he was his,

2940
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:17,020
it wasn't just being charged with peeing
on the girls being charged with having

2941
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:19,510
sex with an underage girl I guess.

2942
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:19,920
Right?

2943
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,171
Yeah.

2944
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:23,380
I think it would have been okay at even
at a water park that according to Brian,

2945
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,630
she called it pee pee.

2946
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,153
Totally count.

2947
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,850
So she didn't say Piss your honor.

2948
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:33,040
Motion to dismiss.

2949
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:34,760
The girl said Pp.

2950
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:36,370
Mr. Kelly said Piss.

2951
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,620
So clearly we're talking
about two different things.

2952
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:40,833
One of them is

2953
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,780
more cultural significance attached to it.

2954
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:46,570
This is a strange time for race relations,

2955
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:47,040
isn't it?

2956
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:47,501
If you noticed,

2957
01:23:47,501 --> 01:23:50,770
this is a very tense time in
America for race relations,

2958
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:55,180
black storm trooper to equal at all
out though is they're going to help.

2959
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:56,830
I don't know,

2960
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:57,611
but there are bad guys,

2961
01:23:57,611 --> 01:23:58,510
stormtroopers or bad guy.

2962
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:02,150
I think he's a good guy that is
playing a bad guy for a second.

2963
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:04,720
Then preview that we saw
stole a costume and he's like,

2964
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:04,991
Oh,

2965
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:06,060
don't say this.

2966
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:06,970
Spoiler alert.

2967
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:09,100
Fuck Jesus Christ.

2968
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:09,351
No one,

2969
01:24:09,351 --> 01:24:10,121
no one knows that.

2970
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:11,260
That's just a guess.

2971
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:11,711
Oh,

2972
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:12,150
okay.

2973
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:12,890
You're back.

2974
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:13,210
All right.

2975
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:15,760
I thought you were giving
up the secret nerd info.

2976
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:19,600
Have you been following this Sony leak
of all the crazy stuff that's been coming

2977
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:21,970
out from the hackers
that have hacked Sony.

2978
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:27,700
So a bunch of hackers have hacked Sony
and they like locked stony office is

2979
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:28,360
down.

2980
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:31,630
They stole movies that haven't been
released and I've been torrenting them.

2981
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,840
They're releasing their private emails
of like how much like like does it,

2982
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:39,220
there's this one real,

2983
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,570
real well known producer.

2984
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,560
They're just trashing Angelina Jolie's.

2985
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,560
Like I don't care about this bid sheet,

2986
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:44,921
you know,

2987
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:45,790
Blah Blah Blah Blah.

2988
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:47,860
And they're releasing all this.

2989
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:48,460
Oh my God.

2990
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:48,690
Yeah,

2991
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:50,860
like all this budget info.

2992
01:24:50,861 --> 01:24:51,061
Like,

2993
01:24:51,061 --> 01:24:55,090
like there's the new Seth Rogen movie
that's a with James Franco and it's

2994
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:56,980
showing how much more he gets paid.

2995
01:24:56,981 --> 01:24:58,210
Then James Franco,

2996
01:24:58,211 --> 01:24:58,991
Seth Rogan,

2997
01:24:58,991 --> 01:25:01,450
and it's just dirty shit.

2998
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:03,183
And they're just,

2999
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:05,440
it's just like all the other like leaks.

3000
01:25:05,441 --> 01:25:06,790
They've been slowly leaking it.

3001
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:10,000
And releasing new stuff
that's just fucked up now.

3002
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:11,440
What do you think they're
trying to do there?

3003
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:12,070
When you're there,

3004
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:14,170
you think they're trying
to shut down Sony.

3005
01:25:14,171 --> 01:25:16,600
Do you think they're
trying to just have fun?

3006
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,400
I uh,

3007
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:22,120
I don't know that cause they don't
really know for sure who's doing it.

3008
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:24,790
At first they thought it was
North Korea because of that.

3009
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:24,940
Oh,

3010
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:25,480
that's right.

3011
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,350
Cause that new movie,

3012
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:30,690
I honestly think it's
just angry Asians that uh,

3013
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:31,750
because of that movie,

3014
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:33,310
they have no connection with North Korea.

3015
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,330
But God,

3016
01:25:34,331 --> 01:25:39,331
you're here to give your doctor
Brian fucking work done whatsoever.

3017
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,120
I to the,

3018
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,860
and I'm just saying when
I say stuff like that,

3019
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:42,730
it's like if I had to guess,

3020
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,521
but doesn't the,

3021
01:25:43,521 --> 01:25:45,580
the North Korea thing makes sense,

3022
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,120
right?

3023
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:46,361
I mean,

3024
01:25:46,361 --> 01:25:50,800
especially if they're released it and
change Franco and Seth Rogen information

3025
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,300
when they were on that movie together,

3026
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:56,020
that was about assassinating
the president of North Korea.

3027
01:25:56,021 --> 01:25:56,350
Right,

3028
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:56,950
right.

3029
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:57,311
You know,

3030
01:25:57,311 --> 01:25:58,870
they have hackers working for them.

3031
01:25:58,871 --> 01:25:59,704
They must.

3032
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:00,161
Yeah.

3033
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:01,460
But there was a whole article about it,

3034
01:26:01,461 --> 01:26:03,470
which they're not really
good at much there.

3035
01:26:03,471 --> 01:26:04,304
Like they build,

3036
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:07,460
they build rockets that just
like fall over when they hit,

3037
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,030
you know,

3038
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:09,650
launch your taunting them.

3039
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:10,331
They,

3040
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:12,900
they're now listening to Tame Creek.

3041
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:15,020
Isn't that the one place
where they don't listen?

3042
01:26:15,021 --> 01:26:17,480
You say that about how the fuck did
they find out about this James Franco,

3043
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,940
obviously they're paying attention.

3044
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:20,560
No,

3045
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,340
they were pissed at
that was being released,

3046
01:26:22,341 --> 01:26:23,174
right?

3047
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:23,990
Yeah.

3048
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:25,670
I would have said no to that movie.

3049
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:26,850
I would have said,

3050
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:27,620
ah,

3051
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:27,951
you know,

3052
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:29,360
they kill people for real over there.

3053
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,680
Like this shit is in a movie.

3054
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:31,793
Like

3055
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:38,220
that fucking guy is essentially like one
of the last real old school dictators

3056
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:44,840
on the planet who runs an empire and
you ask people under his iron fist,

3057
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,890
I mean he's running that country and
his dad was running that country.

3058
01:26:48,891 --> 01:26:50,510
He just got it from his dad.

3059
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:53,600
I mean that you don't
want to fuck with that.

3060
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:54,830
Right the way you want.

3061
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:55,910
If you want to fuck with that.

3062
01:26:55,911 --> 01:27:00,320
Only with like peace talks or a war.

3063
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,760
Like those are the only two.

3064
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:03,080
Like you don't want to like mock them.

3065
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:04,123
Yeah.

3066
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:05,990
Do you James Franco?

3067
01:27:05,991 --> 01:27:06,671
It's fine.

3068
01:27:06,671 --> 01:27:07,670
It's James Franco.

3069
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:09,710
James Franco.

3070
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:11,690
I know that's how we think.

3071
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:13,790
If they showed up at Jane Franco's house,

3072
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:18,170
fucking cut his throat and hung him by
his ankles and you know out the second

3073
01:27:18,171 --> 01:27:19,730
story window and you'd be like,

3074
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:20,623
oh,

3075
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:21,493
okay,

3076
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:22,910
those are,

3077
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:24,890
these are people like it doesn't,

3078
01:27:24,891 --> 01:27:27,170
they don't give a fuck
if you are an actor.

3079
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:28,520
Like they don't care.

3080
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,110
They don't care if you're famous.

3081
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,100
They're famous too,

3082
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:31,911
you know?

3083
01:27:31,911 --> 01:27:33,550
But they're famous for that.

3084
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:35,780
The kid is famous for
like killing his uncle.

3085
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:40,760
He killed like his uncle and his uncle's
family and his children and then gave

3086
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:42,710
his wife a promotion,

3087
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:47,090
like killed their kids and
gave the wife a promotion.

3088
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:50,240
Like she's done like
some gangster shit man.

3089
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:55,490
It sounds like a game of Thrones
episode duty actually do in North Korea.

3090
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:56,181
What did that say?

3091
01:27:56,181 --> 01:27:57,014
What did you say?

3092
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,290
It's getting really dirty.

3093
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:59,320
The lashes out at Sony,

3094
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:01,310
exact four horse snipe.

3095
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:02,803
I protect my

3096
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:03,480
brand.

3097
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,010
It's getting really dirty because like,

3098
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:09,300
I mean everyone that's Sony has worked
with like there's information going out

3099
01:28:09,301 --> 01:28:12,720
so it's getting like actors are now
fighting back and Sony's having to release

3100
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:13,740
all these like,

3101
01:28:13,741 --> 01:28:14,610
apologies.

3102
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,770
I mean it's getting every email.

3103
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:18,630
Oh they said nasty shit.

3104
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:19,170
Yeah.

3105
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:19,550
It's,

3106
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:19,940
I mean,

3107
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:20,341
cause it's,

3108
01:28:20,341 --> 01:28:24,000
imagine you know the how managers
are in Hollywood or you know,

3109
01:28:24,030 --> 01:28:25,290
just Hollywood people,

3110
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:26,640
how they talk back and forth.

3111
01:28:26,830 --> 01:28:27,210
You know,

3112
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:28,380
we could buy that person,

3113
01:28:28,381 --> 01:28:29,101
fuck this person,

3114
01:28:29,101 --> 01:28:30,780
they suck and all that shit.

3115
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:33,530
Did someone call Kevin Hart a
whore or is that what happened?

3116
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:34,850
Who called Kevin Hart a whore.

3117
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:36,770
The biggest in an email.

3118
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,140
Yeah.

3119
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:37,371
Yeah.

3120
01:28:37,371 --> 01:28:38,204
And

3121
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:40,880
I protect my brand that guys,

3122
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:41,780
he's smart.

3123
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:43,010
That's what he is stupid.

3124
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,083
Just making money.

3125
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:45,830
Kevin Hart is smart as fuck.

3126
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:46,693
He's working hard.

3127
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:47,180
Yeah.

3128
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:48,620
Plus he's like Super Nice.

3129
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:49,580
You know,

3130
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:50,510
how do you call that guy a whore?

3131
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:51,230
Yeah,

3132
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:51,951
I saw him,

3133
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:52,550
uh,

3134
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:57,550
organically battle Tony Rock and in big
the urban show that they have at the

3135
01:28:58,611 --> 01:28:59,301
comedy store,

3136
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:01,070
the big trip and on Tuesdays or whatever,

3137
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,400
just organically

3138
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:02,971
started,

3139
01:29:02,971 --> 01:29:06,450
sold out main room and they were
laying into each other one night.

3140
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:08,130
I remember being with
a bunch of Comedians,

3141
01:29:08,131 --> 01:29:10,170
like one of those ones where
you're holding on to shit,

3142
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:10,441
you know,

3143
01:29:10,441 --> 01:29:11,550
they're the best at it.

3144
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:16,880
And Kevin Hart vs Tony Rock and Kevin
Hart genius that he is just waited and

3145
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:21,060
kept sitting on the fact that
Tony Rock is Chris Rock's brother.

3146
01:29:21,061 --> 01:29:23,700
Every time Tony would
throw something good at,

3147
01:29:23,701 --> 01:29:23,791
um,

3148
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:24,151
you know,

3149
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:25,770
you're only famous
because of this and that,

3150
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:26,191
whatever.

3151
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:26,900
And like,

3152
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:30,000
and Kevin just kept waiting
so that by the time,

3153
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:31,800
10 jokes in when he said,

3154
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:33,570
you're just a bung gas brother,

3155
01:29:33,571 --> 01:29:34,321
you know what I mean?

3156
01:29:34,321 --> 01:29:35,700
Or whatever the place just,

3157
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,640
it was over because he
waited so long for it.

3158
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:41,130
Everybody thought it was going to be each
one and he'd get them on another one.

3159
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:42,440
That's hilarious.

3160
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:42,920
Yeah.

3161
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,360
Those rows battles can be brutal,

3162
01:29:44,361 --> 01:29:44,720
man.

3163
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:45,130
Yeah.

3164
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,670
Jen Murphy and her ex boyfriend.

3165
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:47,030
Oh,

3166
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,720
that was great.

3167
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:48,560
Oh good Lord.

3168
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,960
She eviscerated that poor character.

3169
01:29:50,961 --> 01:29:51,794
Yeah,

3170
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:52,850
it was fun.

3171
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:53,100
Those,

3172
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:57,710
those a roast battles are fun because
you know one of the things about it is

3173
01:29:57,711 --> 01:29:59,540
that it's like a writer's show.

3174
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:01,520
It's like it's a joke writing affair.

3175
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:02,541
That's what it's all about.

3176
01:30:02,541 --> 01:30:04,850
So I'll just about writing
jokes clowning each other.

3177
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:07,580
I love that he makes them hug
it out at the end of it too.

3178
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:08,180
Yeah.

3179
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:08,601
Every,

3180
01:30:08,601 --> 01:30:10,040
everyone ends in a hug.

3181
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:14,250
There was one time it didn't and then
into [inaudible] the person who won didn't

3182
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:16,230
want to hug the other person,

3183
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,900
but the whole room turns on you quick.

3184
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,190
Even though he had just won,

3185
01:30:20,191 --> 01:30:21,060
he didn't want a hug,

3186
01:30:21,061 --> 01:30:21,780
so he goes,

3187
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:22,140
man,

3188
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:22,741
fuck this.

3189
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:23,670
And started walking in.

3190
01:30:23,671 --> 01:30:27,370
The whole crowd went from
clapping too with the guy.

3191
01:30:27,371 --> 01:30:32,371
Like he lost respect immediately and had
to really like the rest of the night he

3192
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:36,090
was working on fixing his
reputation with everyone.

3193
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:39,750
Why they clean it up quick
by not respecting the role,

3194
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:40,171
the house,

3195
01:30:40,171 --> 01:30:41,004
the role,

3196
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:44,240
ghetto fast ferry space.

3197
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:45,300
That's a shirt.

3198
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:45,861
That's a white guy.

3199
01:30:45,861 --> 01:30:46,694
We don't know for sure.

3200
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:47,930
That should be a band.

3201
01:30:47,931 --> 01:30:48,361
Very good.

3202
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:48,501
Oh,

3203
01:30:48,501 --> 01:30:49,334
fast.

3204
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:50,930
Sounds like a good band.

3205
01:30:50,931 --> 01:30:51,650
Name.

3206
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:53,380
One of the very ghetto fast concert.

3207
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:54,501
Very ghetto.

3208
01:30:54,501 --> 01:30:55,430
Fast as in town.

3209
01:30:55,431 --> 01:30:56,210
Dude.

3210
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:57,500
I hear they're on some new math.

3211
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:58,610
Vgf Baby.

3212
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,830
I could start a band right now.

3213
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:04,731
Let's do it.

3214
01:31:04,731 --> 01:31:05,241
Four of us.

3215
01:31:05,241 --> 01:31:05,720
Very ghetto.

3216
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:06,553
Fast.

3217
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:07,410
Fast.

3218
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:08,150
Yeah.

3219
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:11,400
We can't say what the CIC
sang UNL dance right quick.

3220
01:31:11,810 --> 01:31:12,041
Come on,

3221
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:13,370
y'all just shake beads in her hair.

3222
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,570
Vgf back again.

3223
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:21,620
Did you ever go to the comedy festivals?

3224
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:24,110
Have you ever been to Montreal
or any of those festivals?

3225
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:25,010
I've never been there.

3226
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:25,853
Montreal.

3227
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:29,760
I have done a couple
like one night things.

3228
01:31:29,761 --> 01:31:30,480
I was with you.

3229
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,111
Toronto,

3230
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:35,880
Toronto just for laughs one nighter and
I did one with Jeff Ross and Chicago,

3231
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:36,900
um,

3232
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,040
a couple of years ago

3233
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:40,960
and yeah,

3234
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:41,883
no,

3235
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:44,340
I done the Travers city comedy festival,

3236
01:31:44,341 --> 01:31:45,540
which was awesome.

3237
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:47,040
Great Festival.

3238
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:49,020
Jeff Garlin and Michael Moore,

3239
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:49,980
the filmmaker,

3240
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:53,400
a run a comedy festival
each year in traverse city,

3241
01:31:53,401 --> 01:31:54,480
which is like Trevor City.

3242
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,100
It's like northern Michigan.

3243
01:31:56,101 --> 01:31:57,490
It's like the cherry capital.

3244
01:31:57,491 --> 01:31:57,600
It's,

3245
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,110
Oh shit.

3246
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:58,681
Unbelievable.

3247
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:00,040
It's a winter fest basically,

3248
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:03,100
and they shut down this
whole strip of this amazing,

3249
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:04,090
like it looks like,

3250
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:08,470
like wonder some winter wonderland city
and they have Ferris wheels and all this

3251
01:32:08,471 --> 01:32:10,750
big sledding hills and
all this winter stuff.

3252
01:32:10,751 --> 01:32:13,180
Everybody dresses all warm
and I've never heard of this.

3253
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:14,170
It's awesome.

3254
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,060
That's incredible.

3255
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:15,893
That's awesome.

3256
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:18,510
And they do this every year in the winter.

3257
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:19,453
But what time in the winter?

3258
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:21,013
Uh,

3259
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:22,180
I'm not sure.

3260
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:23,013
Who would you do it with?

3261
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:23,750
I did it with,

3262
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:24,110
uh,

3263
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:25,750
Kirk Fox matted girth.

3264
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:26,191
Stephanie,

3265
01:32:26,191 --> 01:32:28,100
some Bari Garland.

3266
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:29,030
Sinbad,

3267
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,320
Dave Foley.

3268
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,633
Dave Foley.

3269
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:32,030
Yeah.

3270
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:32,990
How was day four was doing?

3271
01:32:32,991 --> 01:32:33,560
Stand up.

3272
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:34,393
How is it?

3273
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:35,061
Well,

3274
01:32:35,061 --> 01:32:37,550
I did an improvised show with him where?

3275
01:32:37,551 --> 01:32:37,791
Wait,

3276
01:32:37,791 --> 01:32:38,360
what was the thing?

3277
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:38,661
Oh yeah,

3278
01:32:38,661 --> 01:32:40,580
it was the setlist show where you don't,

3279
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:43,430
you don't know what you're going to
do until you look or look behind you.

3280
01:32:43,431 --> 01:32:44,510
And this was in a theater,

3281
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:44,930
right?

3282
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:48,140
And a word pops up and you have to
pretend like you have a bit about that.

3283
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:49,280
You just roll with it.

3284
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:50,810
He ended up taking his pants down.

3285
01:32:50,811 --> 01:32:54,040
It was epic theater exploded
because they're not,

3286
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:57,170
you want to talk about going on the
road and you know what you can do and

3287
01:32:57,171 --> 01:32:57,801
pushing the lines.

3288
01:32:57,801 --> 01:32:57,921
Well,

3289
01:32:57,921 --> 01:33:01,670
they were really weren't expecting
that in good old winter land.

3290
01:33:01,671 --> 01:33:02,001
Come on,

3291
01:33:02,001 --> 01:33:03,140
let me make you Cherry Pie.

3292
01:33:03,141 --> 01:33:04,280
Welcome to Travers city.

3293
01:33:04,281 --> 01:33:05,330
Like that's that Seti.

3294
01:33:05,331 --> 01:33:06,350
Dave Foley just goes,

3295
01:33:06,351 --> 01:33:06,621
what?

3296
01:33:06,621 --> 01:33:09,260
Powell and I remember we were downstairs,

3297
01:33:09,261 --> 01:33:10,640
the green rooms in a basement.

3298
01:33:10,641 --> 01:33:14,780
You just heard this roar and there was
a TV but it was muted and we're all

3299
01:33:14,781 --> 01:33:18,350
sitting in the green room and
you hear this bra and we're like,

3300
01:33:18,351 --> 01:33:18,891
what the hell?

3301
01:33:18,891 --> 01:33:20,890
And you look and Dave Foley's pants where?

3302
01:33:20,891 --> 01:33:22,940
At his ankles on this
TV in the green room.

3303
01:33:22,941 --> 01:33:23,450
And we're just like,

3304
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:24,410
Holy Shit.

3305
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:25,820
That's hilarious.

3306
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:26,420
Yeah.

3307
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:28,010
Fully is a killer joke writer man.

3308
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:28,431
Oh yeah,

3309
01:33:28,431 --> 01:33:28,621
he,

3310
01:33:28,621 --> 01:33:29,630
I was crushed.

3311
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:33,230
I was really happy when he decided to
do some stand up because it was one of

3312
01:33:33,231 --> 01:33:33,651
those things.

3313
01:33:33,651 --> 01:33:36,620
It's the same kind of a thing
where even though he's a,

3314
01:33:36,621 --> 01:33:41,510
an established actor and a established
hilarious guy from kids in the hall,

3315
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:42,770
there's still,

3316
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:44,210
he couldn't always get work.

3317
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:44,481
You know,

3318
01:33:44,481 --> 01:33:46,240
he's having a hard time
getting gigs and you,

3319
01:33:46,241 --> 01:33:46,431
you know,

3320
01:33:46,431 --> 01:33:48,200
you have to get picked to do gigs.

3321
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:49,101
It's just the way it is.

3322
01:33:49,101 --> 01:33:49,940
You get cast,

3323
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:50,590
you know,

3324
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:51,710
or you do your own thing.

3325
01:33:51,711 --> 01:33:54,860
You create your own thing or you get cast
and then the ultimate create your own

3326
01:33:54,861 --> 01:33:55,041
thing.

3327
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:55,581
You stand up.

3328
01:33:55,581 --> 01:33:56,780
So he just started doing stand up,

3329
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,673
you know,

3330
01:33:57,710 --> 01:33:58,431
I just want to see it.

3331
01:33:58,431 --> 01:33:59,410
I haven't seen a standup.

3332
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,860
I would imagine it'd be very funny.

3333
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:01,550
Yeah.

3334
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:02,900
He's just such a smart dude.

3335
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:03,290
Yeah.

3336
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:04,460
He's one of the smartest people I know.

3337
01:34:04,461 --> 01:34:05,930
He's such a fascinating character.

3338
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,030
Or would amaze me.

3339
01:34:07,031 --> 01:34:10,450
What really ended up stealing
that festival for me was,

3340
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:11,250
you know,

3341
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:14,950
Sinbad did a show and I
was thinking of myself,

3342
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:15,181
I,

3343
01:34:15,181 --> 01:34:15,611
you know what?

3344
01:34:15,611 --> 01:34:18,870
I'm going to go do this other show I'm
going to through right after this spot.

3345
01:34:18,871 --> 01:34:20,590
I'm gonna go do this because
it's at the festivals.

3346
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:22,210
There's always multiple
spots you could do.

3347
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:27,130
But I had a chance to sit in the back of
the theater and watch Sinbad for a few

3348
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:29,410
minutes and I was amazed.

3349
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:33,130
Everything that I heard about
him went out the window.

3350
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:34,810
When I saw Sinbad live,

3351
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:37,780
I was honestly shocked
at what he was doing.

3352
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:42,870
I was shocked because I was for sure
thinking I was going to watch every single

3353
01:34:43,391 --> 01:34:46,120
thing that I've been told
about him is that he's a hack.

3354
01:34:46,121 --> 01:34:46,721
He's this,

3355
01:34:46,721 --> 01:34:48,560
he's that Bobby by sucks,

3356
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:53,140
he's washed up and next thing you know
I'm sitting in the back of this theater,

3357
01:34:53,141 --> 01:34:55,870
just slow clapping like that.

3358
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:57,070
I swear.

3359
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,310
Premises delivery,

3360
01:34:58,311 --> 01:34:59,540
like what was so special about it?

3361
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,000
He would go in and out of stuff.

3362
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:04,220
He was just crush,

3363
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:05,840
crush and then he would go,

3364
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:07,130
what's next?

3365
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:12,680
And he would just wait for somebody in
the crowd to say anything and he would

3366
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:13,041
literally,

3367
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,850
basically he was thunder plussing it.

3368
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:17,410
He was staying stand
up on the spotting it,

3369
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:22,780
but he has 35 years of bank and confidence
and energy and I don't think he's

3370
01:35:26,151 --> 01:35:27,080
always been that way.

3371
01:35:27,081 --> 01:35:30,380
Like I remember how goofy is specials
looked when I was kid when I was a kid.

3372
01:35:30,381 --> 01:35:35,150
I don't really remember anything that he
talked about really is and that's all I

3373
01:35:35,151 --> 01:35:35,984
can remember.

3374
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:36,471
Go Ham,

3375
01:35:36,471 --> 01:35:36,801
I go,

3376
01:35:36,801 --> 01:35:36,911
hey,

3377
01:35:36,911 --> 01:35:37,744
I'm a go.

3378
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:41,720
But he was on fire man.

3379
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:44,390
Not the type of stuff that
I was expecting at all.

3380
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:46,480
Like what kind of premises do we use?

3381
01:35:46,481 --> 01:35:47,211
Surprise by luck.

3382
01:35:47,211 --> 01:35:49,160
His points or really?

3383
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:50,563
Yeah.

3384
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,110
When,

3385
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:51,943
how long ago was this?

3386
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,600
This was a about a year ago.

3387
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:55,940
You don't hear about
them that much anymore?

3388
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:59,090
That's where we had him on
killed Tony a couple months ago.

3389
01:35:59,091 --> 01:36:04,091
Him and Jeff Garlin on the same episode
and that was a blast and we got to see

3390
01:36:04,461 --> 01:36:06,050
some of it there too.

3391
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,060
He's great at riffing then.

3392
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:09,193
No Shit.

3393
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:15,530
Just super nice.

3394
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,150
She tried to say you're in black guys.

3395
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:19,903
Just Sinbad,

3396
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,230
32 dark posts.

3397
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,010
Only his pants though.

3398
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:27,891
Those hammer pants.

3399
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:28,790
If you could bring those back,

3400
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:31,610
there'll be a strong move cause someone
has to be the first person to slap those

3401
01:36:31,611 --> 01:36:32,630
pants on in the first place.

3402
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:37,550
We're wearing them and
silver lake MC hammer pants,

3403
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:38,863
ironically,

3404
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:43,330
and they are garland and Sinbad.

3405
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:45,850
Samsung Hammer.

3406
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:48,220
I did send that.

3407
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:50,480
I've never met the gentleman.

3408
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,351
He was really,

3409
01:36:51,351 --> 01:36:52,184
really nice.

3410
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:53,810
You'd be really surprised.

3411
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:54,741
I bet he's a nice guy.

3412
01:36:54,741 --> 01:36:55,221
Is Never,

3413
01:36:55,221 --> 01:36:56,340
never heard a bad thing about him.

3414
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:57,853
Never heard he's a duck.

3415
01:36:57,980 --> 01:37:00,350
This episode with Garland and Sinbad,

3416
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:05,210
I think it's like 35 and 32 years or
something crazy that they've both been

3417
01:37:05,211 --> 01:37:05,481
doing.

3418
01:37:05,481 --> 01:37:07,010
Standups are the comedians.

3419
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:10,250
I think there was one or two that
had their first time ever on stage.

3420
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:15,020
We're getting immediate feedback from
over 60 years of comedy experience.

3421
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,450
70 if you throw in me and Brian,

3422
01:37:17,451 --> 01:37:18,950
but that's crazy.

3423
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:19,873
Yeah,

3424
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,470
towels.

3425
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:23,680
Oh yeah,

3426
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:23,981
that's,

3427
01:37:23,981 --> 01:37:27,080
that's another funny thing
that I'll tell you the only,

3428
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:28,580
the only thing on his rider,

3429
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:29,900
I swear to God,

3430
01:37:29,901 --> 01:37:30,531
I got to the,

3431
01:37:30,531 --> 01:37:31,330
I got the,

3432
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:32,360
in the green room,

3433
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:36,740
there's a little cabinet things sitting
there and it just had 10 hand towels on

3434
01:37:36,741 --> 01:37:36,801
it.

3435
01:37:36,801 --> 01:37:40,190
And there was a note that said for
Sinbad and the assistant that brought me

3436
01:37:40,191 --> 01:37:40,500
down,

3437
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:40,701
I go,

3438
01:37:40,701 --> 01:37:41,390
what's that?

3439
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:41,931
And she goes,

3440
01:37:41,931 --> 01:37:44,720
that's the only thing on his
rider 10 clean hand towels.

3441
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,793
So hilarious.

3442
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:48,620
Black dudes love towels.

3443
01:37:48,621 --> 01:37:50,340
It's true of to pat the forehead down.

3444
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:51,560
You know,

3445
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,440
Bill Byrd did that and his latest special
I was gonna I was gonna call him up

3446
01:37:54,441 --> 01:37:55,274
and ask him it.

3447
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,010
He

3448
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,250
had his forehead down with a towel yet
sitting there and the other thing was

3449
01:37:59,400 --> 01:37:59,970
kind of,

3450
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:01,770
he had a glass of water.

3451
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:02,760
It was just a glass,

3452
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:05,100
not a bottle of water with
a cap and actual class.

3453
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:05,670
Like he's,

3454
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:06,930
he's so old school.

3455
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,970
He had a glass of water on stage.

3456
01:38:08,971 --> 01:38:10,630
Like you could totally
see him doing that too.

3457
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:12,213
Yeah,

3458
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:13,440
it probably was tap water,

3459
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:14,100
Eh,

3460
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,150
I'll just take it out of the phone.

3461
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:18,030
These guys now everybody's
got a bottle of water.

3462
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,910
Have fucking bottled water.

3463
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:21,960
I think there's this,

3464
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:23,250
I think it's a fucking scam.

3465
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:23,851
That's what I think.

3466
01:38:23,851 --> 01:38:26,310
I think they just take that shit out
and they s they sell it to you and they

3467
01:38:26,311 --> 01:38:28,350
look at you like you're a fucking
idiot when you pay for it.

3468
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,060
Every time with the cap,

3469
01:38:30,061 --> 01:38:30,400
what I'm doing,

3470
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:30,751
what am I,

3471
01:38:30,751 --> 01:38:30,931
why?

3472
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:32,550
Why am I putting in time on this job?

3473
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:33,960
He's got one of those voices,

3474
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:34,171
man.

3475
01:38:34,171 --> 01:38:34,411
You know,

3476
01:38:34,411 --> 01:38:38,940
he's a guy that has also
benefited tremendously from
podcasts because he goes on

3477
01:38:38,941 --> 01:38:40,500
these rifts every week.

3478
01:38:40,501 --> 01:38:42,720
He does his podcast completely by himself,

3479
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:43,860
which I've done before,

3480
01:38:43,861 --> 01:38:45,000
which is fucking hard,

3481
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:45,300
man.

3482
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:46,380
It's really hard.

3483
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:51,590
It's hard not to a slide
into a being boring,

3484
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:52,910
you know?

3485
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:53,250
Right.

3486
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,330
The monotonous,

3487
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,590
it's hard to be entertaining,

3488
01:38:55,770 --> 01:38:56,161
but he's,

3489
01:38:56,161 --> 01:38:57,630
he's fucking entertaining doing it.

3490
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:00,990
And there's something to be
said for not having video too.

3491
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:02,790
There's something to be said for video,

3492
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:04,920
but there's also something
to be said for just audio.

3493
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:09,150
Just audio is a type of entertainment,

3494
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:09,780
like,

3495
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:11,280
like putting it down on youtube,

3496
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:13,260
putting a podcast on
Vimeo and all that stuff.

3497
01:39:13,261 --> 01:39:13,920
It's all great.

3498
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,310
Nothing,

3499
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:15,180
nothing bad about it.

3500
01:39:15,181 --> 01:39:19,260
But occasionally I just like listening
to shit and burst podcasts the best for

3501
01:39:19,261 --> 01:39:20,730
that because it's just him.

3502
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:24,820
You could tell it's just him with a
couple pieces of paper at his desk and he

3503
01:39:24,821 --> 01:39:25,654
just ran.

3504
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:26,603
You know,

3505
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:33,090
it's interesting listening to kill Tony
versus watching killed Tony because I

3506
01:39:33,091 --> 01:39:34,560
usually always watch it,

3507
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:39,680
but lately I've been listening to it and
you don't judge who's on stage as much

3508
01:39:39,871 --> 01:39:40,260
when you,

3509
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,960
you're just listening
to this open miker talk.

3510
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:46,470
Sometimes it's actually way better
to listen to the audio because you're

3511
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:51,210
actually hearing what he's trying to say
like almost as a character instead of

3512
01:39:51,211 --> 01:39:52,140
seeing the video part.

3513
01:39:52,170 --> 01:39:52,470
It's,

3514
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:54,840
it's neat how some podcasts changed.

3515
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:55,920
Well even comedy,

3516
01:39:55,921 --> 01:39:57,030
I think comedy,

3517
01:39:57,031 --> 01:40:02,031
I love watching it but I also love just
lying back like with some headsets on

3518
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:03,840
closing my eyes,

3519
01:40:03,841 --> 01:40:04,770
listening to a set.

3520
01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:06,240
I like doing that too.

3521
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:06,781
You know,

3522
01:40:06,781 --> 01:40:07,614
I like,

3523
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:08,011
you know,

3524
01:40:08,011 --> 01:40:10,560
like when I was a kid we
used to listen to albums.

3525
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:11,910
Like that was a big thing.

3526
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:12,841
Like comedy albums,

3527
01:40:12,841 --> 01:40:14,580
like Cheech and Chong and you know,

3528
01:40:14,581 --> 01:40:19,290
listen to old bill Cosby albums and
when we would sit and listen to them,

3529
01:40:19,291 --> 01:40:20,370
I would just be like,

3530
01:40:20,371 --> 01:40:22,770
you'd just be sitting around
listening to the words,

3531
01:40:22,771 --> 01:40:24,630
just looking off in the room you were in,

3532
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:25,231
you know,

3533
01:40:25,231 --> 01:40:25,530
you,

3534
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:26,100
it's,

3535
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,480
there's something about that,

3536
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:32,510
the allowing your mind to like go on a
little dance and not getting any visual

3537
01:40:33,511 --> 01:40:34,200
stimuli.

3538
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,810
You're just sort of it and putting
it all together in your mind.

3539
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:37,891
Some about that.

3540
01:40:37,891 --> 01:40:38,970
That's really fucking cool.

3541
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:39,680
It's,

3542
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:40,290
it's not,

3543
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:44,760
I w I would definitely like if someone
had to choose between never seeing people

3544
01:40:44,761 --> 01:40:46,740
again or always seeing people again,

3545
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:48,570
I would always go with
always seeing people again.

3546
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:51,570
But there's something cool
about just comedy cds.

3547
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:52,463
Yeah.

3548
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:53,980
It's Kinda like when you read a

3549
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,700
book and you're,

3550
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:56,050
and you're thinking about
something else and you're like,

3551
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:58,570
oh I have to go back to the beginning
when you watch video and audio cause

3552
01:40:58,571 --> 01:40:59,291
you're focusing,

3553
01:40:59,291 --> 01:40:59,620
I'm like,

3554
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,030
oh that guy's hair's weird.

3555
01:41:01,031 --> 01:41:02,110
Or Why is he wearing that?

3556
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:04,120
Instead of like you listen to the judge,

3557
01:41:04,121 --> 01:41:04,360
she like,

3558
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:04,481
oh,

3559
01:41:04,481 --> 01:41:05,470
he's actually funny.

3560
01:41:05,471 --> 01:41:08,650
If I was just listening and not looking
at his outfit and how weird he is,

3561
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:09,790
whatever,

3562
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:10,630
whatever it is.

3563
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:13,390
But then there's people that you know
like Joey will you want to see him?

3564
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:14,283
Exactly.

3565
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:16,330
When do you think you to say?

3566
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:17,050
Yeah,

3567
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:20,350
I just want to say I think it's kind
of cool for us because I mean sometimes

3568
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:22,150
people don't know what we look like.

3569
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:23,530
They're just like,

3570
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:23,660
oh,

3571
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:24,491
you're pretty.

3572
01:41:24,491 --> 01:41:25,324
And they like,

3573
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:29,440
Tony should have your own show.

3574
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:32,290
I'm a producer.

3575
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:35,320
Producer,

3576
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:36,153
Huh?

3577
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:38,300
Yeah.

3578
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,280
Do you guys get Weirdos fall
on you because of the show?

3579
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:40,570
Oh,

3580
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:42,310
oh my God.

3581
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,440
The weirdest people.

3582
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:46,180
The weirdest people.

3583
01:41:46,181 --> 01:41:47,610
I someone made a sub reddit.

3584
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,670
Brian sent it to me.

3585
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:51,640
Sub reddit just for me,

3586
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:52,503
except they,

3587
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:53,980
he took,

3588
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:54,221
I mean,

3589
01:41:54,221 --> 01:41:55,180
it's like flattering.

3590
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:59,530
It's slash creepy mean and they took
my Instagram pictures and it's like a

3591
01:41:59,531 --> 01:41:59,981
whole,

3592
01:41:59,981 --> 01:42:02,110
just like just my pictures
and just like one word,

3593
01:42:02,111 --> 01:42:05,560
titles like sunbathing or legs,

3594
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:06,990
like whatever it,

3595
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:08,050
my picture is,

3596
01:42:08,051 --> 01:42:08,411
they're just,

3597
01:42:08,411 --> 01:42:10,360
it's the description
of categorize them all.

3598
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:10,940
Oh yeah.

3599
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:11,350
Oof.

3600
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:12,250
It's very creepy.

3601
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:15,250
How many dudes do you think if you
had it like a round about number of,

3602
01:42:15,251 --> 01:42:18,190
of spanked it to pictures
while these two in this room?

3603
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:19,830
I mean,

3604
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:20,850
Tony's done it together.

3605
01:42:20,851 --> 01:42:21,684
I'm looking at the phone.

3606
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,513
Me and Tony,

3607
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:27,241
you're lucky.

3608
01:42:27,241 --> 01:42:27,571
Strong.

3609
01:42:27,571 --> 01:42:28,410
That whole sentence together.

3610
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,313
That's it.

3611
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:32,910
That's the nickname he has for me.

3612
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:34,380
Tony.

3613
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:35,850
Tony's do that all the time.

3614
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:37,733
Tony.

3615
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,870
That's probably who made
the subreddit by the way.

3616
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:43,741
Oh God.

3617
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,180
He definitely spanked it to my,

3618
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:45,391
uh,

3619
01:42:45,391 --> 01:42:48,090
both of our picture is how
long do you girls think

3620
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:49,850
you'll keep doing this and do you think,

3621
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:50,240
do you like,

3622
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:50,961
do you have a plan?

3623
01:42:50,961 --> 01:42:51,141
Do you,

3624
01:42:51,141 --> 01:42:51,470
do,

3625
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:52,303
do you have like a,

3626
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:56,330
like a transition to becoming
a professional standup plan?

3627
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:57,490
I said what you guys would love to do.

3628
01:42:57,530 --> 01:42:58,610
You want to do your own podcast?

3629
01:42:58,710 --> 01:42:59,520
Um,

3630
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,001
yeah,

3631
01:43:00,001 --> 01:43:02,310
I've thought about doing
my own podcast for sure.

3632
01:43:02,311 --> 01:43:03,180
We've talked about it.

3633
01:43:03,181 --> 01:43:03,720
Yeah.

3634
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:04,553
Um,

3635
01:43:05,010 --> 01:43:05,341
I don't know.

3636
01:43:05,341 --> 01:43:08,160
I think that the benefit of killed Tony,

3637
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:13,050
there's still so much benefit for
us because there's so much that we,

3638
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,960
I feel like I've learned in
like a small amount of time.

3639
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:21,560
Just from being like holding yourself to
a standard of writing in this stuff all

3640
01:43:21,751 --> 01:43:24,840
the time and meeting people and getting
feedback from people who've been doing

3641
01:43:24,841 --> 01:43:25,674
it longer.

3642
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:26,370
That's,

3643
01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:28,110
you can't ask for that.

3644
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:29,010
You can't find that.

3645
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:29,651
Right.

3646
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:30,484
It's true.

3647
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:33,750
And you guys ever have a material cross?

3648
01:43:35,230 --> 01:43:36,330
What are each other's?

3649
01:43:36,570 --> 01:43:36,750
Yeah,

3650
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,070
like current event type shit.

3651
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:39,750
Oh you're writing a new minute every week.

3652
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,380
Her and I are totally different.

3653
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:42,100
Yeah.

3654
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:42,970
Completely different.

3655
01:43:42,971 --> 01:43:44,730
The comedians like,

3656
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:44,920
yeah,

3657
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,540
two completely different styles,

3658
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:47,710
different voices.

3659
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:51,350
Kevin talks a little bit more about
topical stuff and her family and Sarah

3660
01:43:51,351 --> 01:43:52,100
organically

3661
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:57,100
just ends up talking about like the
most random small thing you can imagine.

3662
01:43:57,450 --> 01:44:01,180
You know how like there's
like some subjects when you
go to an open mic night or

3663
01:44:01,181 --> 01:44:03,760
any sort of a show where guys
are working on new material.

3664
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:04,391
Like,

3665
01:44:04,391 --> 01:44:04,930
um,

3666
01:44:04,930 --> 01:44:05,741
remember that one Brian,

3667
01:44:05,741 --> 01:44:07,370
when the Chinese uh,

3668
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:12,420
pilot crashed into the American pilot
and his name was one way and that became

3669
01:44:13,241 --> 01:44:17,050
like the most ridiculously overused
joke in the history of comedy.

3670
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:22,290
Like everybody had a joke about this guy
named Wong way who's a Chinese fighter

3671
01:44:22,451 --> 01:44:23,260
pilot.

3672
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:24,520
Everyone has a Tinder joke.

3673
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:26,020
Everyone has a cosmic joke.

3674
01:44:26,770 --> 01:44:27,603
Right?

3675
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:28,001
Yeah.

3676
01:44:28,001 --> 01:44:29,440
Cosby's another perfect example.

3677
01:44:29,441 --> 01:44:30,850
Like if you go on an
open Mike night today,

3678
01:44:30,851 --> 01:44:34,500
most likely five or six people before
you have already told Cosby jokes.

3679
01:44:34,630 --> 01:44:35,040
Oh yeah,

3680
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:35,430
yeah,

3681
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:35,671
yeah.

3682
01:44:35,671 --> 01:44:37,380
Well like it's kind of
like you said earlier.

3683
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:38,303
Um,

3684
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:39,600
I feel like I only,

3685
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:40,050
I,

3686
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:43,620
there's things that people talk about
all the time and I know it's going to be

3687
01:44:43,621 --> 01:44:45,660
what everyone's saying at an open mic.

3688
01:44:45,661 --> 01:44:49,230
But if I feel like I have a better joke
about it than everybody else and I'll

3689
01:44:49,231 --> 01:44:50,310
absolutely do it,

3690
01:44:50,430 --> 01:44:52,950
I don't care if everyone else talking
about it because if it's better than

3691
01:44:52,951 --> 01:44:53,551
everyone else's,

3692
01:44:53,551 --> 01:44:54,320
it doesn't matter.

3693
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:54,531
Yeah.

3694
01:44:54,531 --> 01:44:55,101
Good for you.

3695
01:44:55,101 --> 01:44:55,761
You don't have to,

3696
01:44:55,761 --> 01:44:57,050
just because the subjects are have been,

3697
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:57,590
you can,

3698
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:59,330
especially if you're
just working on jokes,

3699
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,540
which is essentially what you're doing.

3700
01:45:00,570 --> 01:45:02,870
You're doing sets of new shit every week.

3701
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:03,470
You're,

3702
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:05,900
you're like in a constant
state of working on jokes.

3703
01:45:06,010 --> 01:45:06,843
Yeah.

3704
01:45:07,110 --> 01:45:07,943
Right.

3705
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:11,230
Like we've never had
close to the same topic.

3706
01:45:11,231 --> 01:45:11,950
No,

3707
01:45:11,950 --> 01:45:12,783
not at all.

3708
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:13,710
Yeah.

3709
01:45:13,710 --> 01:45:16,030
Sarah pick something and
then she focuses on it.

3710
01:45:16,031 --> 01:45:16,110
Yeah.

3711
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:17,220
Josh me like gum,

3712
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:18,390
Minty Gum,

3713
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:19,720
dust pans pyramid.

3714
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:22,110
Vasco seashells.

3715
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:23,820
Mayonnaise.

3716
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:24,773
Yeah.

3717
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:26,400
Just want to put the crackers.

3718
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:26,591
Yes.

3719
01:45:26,591 --> 01:45:27,420
Break it down.

3720
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:28,170
Yeah.

3721
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:28,680
Crack.

3722
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,860
That's how she's a third slot.

3723
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:30,490
Sorry.

3724
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:31,850
Yeah.

3725
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:33,450
Easter baskets.

3726
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:35,460
Let's talk about them and I hate him.

3727
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:37,080
Do you think it's tougher

3728
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:39,230
to be a check and do standup comedy?

3729
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:39,961
Ooh,

3730
01:45:39,961 --> 01:45:41,100
I like this question.

3731
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:42,480
I think it's,

3732
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,280
I think there's two different advantages.

3733
01:45:44,281 --> 01:45:45,120
Like think that,

3734
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:46,230
um,

3735
01:45:46,230 --> 01:45:47,130
sometimes it's like,

3736
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:47,730
oh,

3737
01:45:47,730 --> 01:45:51,300
they only get this stuff because
they're girls or you know,

3738
01:45:51,301 --> 01:45:51,620
like,

3739
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:51,991
you know,

3740
01:45:51,991 --> 01:45:52,710
they,

3741
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:56,050
they flirt their way to stage time or
whatever and then at the same time they're

3742
01:45:56,070 --> 01:45:56,400
like,

3743
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,110
not that many girls.

3744
01:45:58,350 --> 01:45:59,183
I mean,

3745
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:01,200
Sarah and I started killed
Tony because it was,

3746
01:46:01,201 --> 01:46:05,430
you said it was all guy comedians in the
beginning and then we became to regular

3747
01:46:05,431 --> 01:46:06,540
girls at the end of it.

3748
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:07,374
And it's just,

3749
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:10,350
there's not that much
competition right now.

3750
01:46:10,351 --> 01:46:11,101
Especially right now.

3751
01:46:11,101 --> 01:46:14,040
I feel like there's not a
lot of girls in New York.

3752
01:46:14,041 --> 01:46:15,210
I know there's a lot more girls,

3753
01:46:15,211 --> 01:46:17,930
but I think that it gives
us an advantage and like,

3754
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:19,440
I think that if you're funny,

3755
01:46:19,441 --> 01:46:20,250
you're funny.

3756
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:20,851
If you work hard,

3757
01:46:20,851 --> 01:46:21,660
you work hard.

3758
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:21,920
Yeah.

3759
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,370
Those are two definite truth.

3760
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:23,811
If you're funny,

3761
01:46:23,811 --> 01:46:24,120
you're funny.

3762
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:24,631
If you work hard,

3763
01:46:24,631 --> 01:46:25,410
you work hard,

3764
01:46:25,410 --> 01:46:26,243
that's for sure.

3765
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:28,710
But I think that what I've
always thought was that,

3766
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:29,400
uh,

3767
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:33,630
we're lucky as men that we could get
away with a lot more subject matter.

3768
01:46:33,870 --> 01:46:37,320
Like a man can talk about
politics and critique like,

3769
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:39,060
like what's going on in the world.

3770
01:46:39,390 --> 01:46:41,310
But I think if women start doing that,

3771
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:41,611
like men,

3772
01:46:41,611 --> 01:46:43,230
unless they're like really established,

3773
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:43,851
I get,

3774
01:46:43,851 --> 01:46:45,900
unless you're like someone that
you come to see you do that,

3775
01:46:45,901 --> 01:46:50,670
like maybe Janine Garafalo or someone
that you go to expect that if an unknown

3776
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:54,660
Gow is on stage and she starts
criticizing the current administration,

3777
01:46:54,661 --> 01:46:56,220
like who's this fucking know it all bitch,

3778
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,353
you know?

3779
01:46:57,830 --> 01:46:58,270
Right,

3780
01:46:58,270 --> 01:46:58,501
right.

3781
01:46:58,501 --> 01:46:59,970
And then like guys,

3782
01:46:59,971 --> 01:47:04,020
a lot of guys do not like hearing women
like in position of speaking if they

3783
01:47:04,021 --> 01:47:05,130
have differing opinions.

3784
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:06,030
You know,

3785
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:07,770
like during like there's a lot of people,

3786
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:08,520
especially men,

3787
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:13,520
they're in this constant state of like
a conflict and competition at work.

3788
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:15,450
They're constantly at work,

3789
01:47:15,490 --> 01:47:15,691
you know,

3790
01:47:15,691 --> 01:47:17,180
battling back and forth with their boss,

3791
01:47:17,210 --> 01:47:18,510
dealing with the clients
and this and that,

3792
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:19,890
and they're in this constant state.

3793
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:22,980
Then they go to a comedy club and some
chick has onstage and she's talking about

3794
01:47:22,981 --> 01:47:23,290
the depth,

3795
01:47:23,290 --> 01:47:24,540
the difference between the Republicans,

3796
01:47:24,541 --> 01:47:25,100
Democrats,

3797
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:27,480
you don't know shit about real public.

3798
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:28,921
Let me guess.

3799
01:47:28,921 --> 01:47:30,180
You fucking lived hard,

3800
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:30,751
you know what I mean?

3801
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:34,380
Like they're in this constant
state and a woman going on stage.

3802
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:34,981
I think it's a,

3803
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:39,981
it's an extra little hill to climb and
then sex is also what I would think is an

3804
01:47:40,681 --> 01:47:45,030
extra little hill to climb because it
dude can talk about just and all over the

3805
01:47:45,031 --> 01:47:46,050
place or you know,

3806
01:47:46,051 --> 01:47:47,490
you can talk about basically anything,

3807
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:47,790
right?

3808
01:47:47,790 --> 01:47:49,590
But a girl talking about sex,

3809
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:51,060
it gets really tricky.

3810
01:47:51,061 --> 01:47:52,290
Like girls a clam up,

3811
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:52,620
they'll,

3812
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:53,700
they'll think you're a whore.

3813
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:54,450
You know,

3814
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:55,220
guys,

3815
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:55,740
you know,

3816
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:58,080
don't know when you know
they should laugh or what,

3817
01:47:58,081 --> 01:47:59,350
what's acceptable at a chicken.

3818
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:00,720
Get Away with talking about.

3819
01:48:00,730 --> 01:48:01,050
Yeah,

3820
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:04,740
I had a lot of trouble with that when I
first started because everyone tells you

3821
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:07,920
to talk about your life and I'm 24,

3822
01:48:07,921 --> 01:48:10,350
like I'm having sex and like doing this,

3823
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:10,801
you know,

3824
01:48:10,801 --> 01:48:11,161
I'm like,

3825
01:48:11,161 --> 01:48:12,180
that's my life right now.

3826
01:48:12,181 --> 01:48:12,601
And people are like,

3827
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:12,691
Oh,

3828
01:48:12,691 --> 01:48:15,750
don't talk about having
sex because that's hacky.

3829
01:48:15,751 --> 01:48:16,830
That's what all girls talk about.

3830
01:48:16,831 --> 01:48:17,520
And it's like,

3831
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:18,810
that's cause we're having sex.

3832
01:48:18,811 --> 01:48:19,141
You know,

3833
01:48:19,141 --> 01:48:21,330
like you're talking about
things you're doing.

3834
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:22,733
Um,

3835
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:24,180
I just say whatever I want.

3836
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:25,290
That's good.

3837
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:25,660
Yeah.

3838
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:26,493
I don't care.

3839
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:27,391
I don't really care.

3840
01:48:27,391 --> 01:48:27,691
I just,

3841
01:48:27,691 --> 01:48:28,620
my goal is just like,

3842
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:31,080
I feel like as long as
I come out of it funny,

3843
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:31,891
if you come out,

3844
01:48:31,891 --> 01:48:33,650
if you come out of your
set and it was a funny set,

3845
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:34,740
no one's going to be mad at you.

3846
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:35,911
So if he was funny,

3847
01:48:35,911 --> 01:48:36,421
they can't be like,

3848
01:48:36,421 --> 01:48:36,631
oh,

3849
01:48:36,631 --> 01:48:38,100
stupid funny girl.

3850
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:39,810
I mean they can,

3851
01:48:39,811 --> 01:48:40,644
but then,

3852
01:48:40,810 --> 01:48:41,710
and it's obviously,

3853
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:46,480
it's obvious if you see like Whitney
Cummings or Chelsea handler or you know,

3854
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:47,590
even Joan Rivers,

3855
01:48:47,591 --> 01:48:50,290
like you could talk about whatever
the fuck you want to talk about.

3856
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:50,920
You know,

3857
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:51,221
I just,

3858
01:48:51,221 --> 01:48:52,600
I've always felt like as a woman,

3859
01:48:52,601 --> 01:48:54,610
like it's probably like there's
an extra little hump to crop.

3860
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:54,851
Oh,

3861
01:48:54,851 --> 01:48:55,684
they're definitely

3862
01:48:55,790 --> 01:49:00,790
feel like ladies are definitely adi ladies
in the audience are tougher on women

3863
01:49:01,371 --> 01:49:03,410
than they are on guys for sure.

3864
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:05,620
Because almost all you can adjust,

3865
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:07,070
almost see it on their faces.

3866
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:08,960
That's another funny
thing about kill Tony,

3867
01:49:08,961 --> 01:49:13,430
is we have that perspective where you're
sitting at a table facing the audience

3868
01:49:13,431 --> 01:49:15,710
and you get to see what they're
looking at for a change.

3869
01:49:15,711 --> 01:49:17,990
Like instead of just when you're on stage,

3870
01:49:17,991 --> 01:49:19,850
that camera one perspective,

3871
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:24,190
you see the looks on their faces sometimes
when this type of person's honor,

3872
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:25,760
that type of persons on and women,

3873
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:28,070
it seems like all of them were like,

3874
01:49:28,071 --> 01:49:28,904
well,

3875
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:31,340
I know I have to be better than her,

3876
01:49:31,341 --> 01:49:33,050
so let's see what she can do.

3877
01:49:33,110 --> 01:49:36,570
And then you watch them get beat
out of them after a few seconds.

3878
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:36,880
You know?

3879
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:37,180
It's like,

3880
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:37,520
ah,

3881
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:37,821
okay.

3882
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:38,361
I get it.

3883
01:49:38,361 --> 01:49:40,880
She's a pro and I don't,

3884
01:49:41,150 --> 01:49:42,710
and I judged too quick.

3885
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,600
I think there's some women that
just are fans of other women.

3886
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:46,553
Totally.

3887
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:49,090
There's some that you love them.

3888
01:49:49,190 --> 01:49:50,050
I love women.

3889
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:50,351
Oh,

3890
01:49:50,351 --> 01:49:50,930
okay.

3891
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:51,461
Are you met?

3892
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:53,020
You love the women that don't love women?

3893
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:54,191
You know,

3894
01:49:54,191 --> 01:49:56,110
like there's some women that
only have like male friends.

3895
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:57,550
They don't have any women friends.

3896
01:49:58,030 --> 01:49:59,260
Those are the crazy ones.

3897
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:02,170
Are they as crazy as that
dude's only have girlfriends?

3898
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:06,150
You know,

3899
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:06,380
my,

3900
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:10,900
my wife had this friend who had a guy
friend for like the longest time and I was

3901
01:50:10,901 --> 01:50:11,081
like,

3902
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:12,220
that dude is gay.

3903
01:50:12,221 --> 01:50:12,560
And they're like,

3904
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:13,393
no,

3905
01:50:14,290 --> 01:50:14,651
no.

3906
01:50:14,651 --> 01:50:15,640
He's got a kid.

3907
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:16,361
That dude,

3908
01:50:16,361 --> 01:50:17,194
he's gay.

3909
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:17,831
No,

3910
01:50:17,831 --> 01:50:18,970
he's got a kid.

3911
01:50:18,971 --> 01:50:19,391
No,

3912
01:50:19,391 --> 01:50:20,290
he's a father.

3913
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:21,310
That dude is gay.

3914
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:24,850
It turns out in his
forties that dude is gay.

3915
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:26,520
He's like,

3916
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:26,771
fucking,

3917
01:50:26,771 --> 01:50:27,820
I can't carry this anymore.

3918
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:29,680
And I was like,

3919
01:50:29,681 --> 01:50:31,180
I told Joe,

3920
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:32,470
Joe,

3921
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:33,280
Joe,

3922
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,850
did he start talking gay media?

3923
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:35,441
It wasn't,

3924
01:50:35,441 --> 01:50:36,161
you know what it was,

3925
01:50:36,161 --> 01:50:36,521
man,

3926
01:50:36,521 --> 01:50:37,030
it was,

3927
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:37,751
there was like,

3928
01:50:37,751 --> 01:50:41,860
he was like way too into
talking about like girl stuff.

3929
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:46,870
Like he was way too into talking about
like shopping and gossip and I was

3930
01:50:46,871 --> 01:50:47,710
listening to him talk.

3931
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:48,041
I was like,

3932
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:49,290
what is going on here?

3933
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:51,610
What is this like?

3934
01:50:51,611 --> 01:50:54,040
There was this extreme lack of,

3935
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:55,173
of uh,

3936
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:56,013
I mean it wasn't,

3937
01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:01,090
it was more like he was like all male
woman than it was that he was homosexual

3938
01:51:01,091 --> 01:51:02,980
because I never felt like
he was hitting on me.

3939
01:51:03,370 --> 01:51:04,360
He's a power bottom.

3940
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,360
Maybe it's a problem to
bottom that fuck it back.

3941
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:12,570
But I'm not saying you never showed
any like sexual attraction to men.

3942
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:17,890
He just showed such feminine
behavior patterns that I was like,

3943
01:51:17,891 --> 01:51:18,670
this is wrong,

3944
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:20,380
this is incorrect here.

3945
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:21,550
Like what's going on?

3946
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:23,453
What's she playing?

3947
01:51:24,030 --> 01:51:26,050
They soon split up.

3948
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:26,750
What's up?

3949
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:27,583
Then

3950
01:51:28,590 --> 01:51:30,010
the whole thing was a disaster.

3951
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:31,271
But it's just,

3952
01:51:31,271 --> 01:51:32,050
it's uh,

3953
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:32,351
it's,

3954
01:51:32,351 --> 01:51:34,120
it's fascinating to see someone like that.

3955
01:51:34,150 --> 01:51:35,920
It's like battling it,

3956
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:37,143
fighting it off.

3957
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:40,120
The poor bastard just gave in and it's 40.

3958
01:51:40,121 --> 01:51:40,954
It's just

3959
01:51:43,970 --> 01:51:44,230
nice.

3960
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:46,130
Not like a 20 year old boyfriend bowing

3961
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,990
out of the closet and into the funnier

3962
01:51:54,630 --> 01:51:56,320
he's flaming get it.

3963
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:58,150
Yeah.

3964
01:51:58,150 --> 01:51:59,860
I was hanging out with mostly women,

3965
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:01,590
but I think it's mostly due to my,

3966
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:04,000
like growing up with my
mom and my sister though.

3967
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:04,631
But you know,

3968
01:52:04,631 --> 01:52:05,920
a lot of dudes are friends with.

3969
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,390
Yeah.

3970
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:06,610
But,

3971
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:07,900
but in general,

3972
01:52:07,901 --> 01:52:10,060
I like in high school
only had girlfriends,

3973
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:11,380
never know guy friends.

3974
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:11,860
And then,

3975
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:12,660
uh,

3976
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:13,080
in,

3977
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:13,781
in real life,

3978
01:52:13,781 --> 01:52:14,200
you know,

3979
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:16,870
like most of the time I'm
usually hanging out with girls.

3980
01:52:16,871 --> 01:52:17,860
I'm not calling up guys going,

3981
01:52:17,861 --> 01:52:18,131
hey,

3982
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:19,750
let's go to a bar and get some drinks.

3983
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,190
I'm calling up a girl and going,

3984
01:52:21,191 --> 01:52:21,431
hey,

3985
01:52:21,431 --> 01:52:23,290
let's go to a bar and get some drinks.

3986
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:24,570
I'm never calling guys,

3987
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:25,380
you know,

3988
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:26,213
except for like,

3989
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:28,110
I'm not like,

3990
01:52:28,270 --> 01:52:31,810
when was the last time I called him of
you guys going to come in here sweating?

3991
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:32,813
I can't handle it

3992
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:38,600
like TMZ and I live in
a pink house and Shit.

3993
01:52:39,850 --> 01:52:40,200
Hey,

3994
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:41,160
you put that in there.

3995
01:52:41,190 --> 01:52:42,420
I saw you slip that in there.

3996
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:43,501
The fuck dude,

3997
01:52:43,501 --> 01:52:44,334
the cars.

3998
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:48,170
Have you guys talked at all about all
this racial shit that's going on in the

3999
01:52:48,171 --> 01:52:50,990
Ferguson riots and talking
about any of that on stage?

4000
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:52,120
So deep.

4001
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:54,390
Have you seen that new Ferguson video?

4002
01:52:54,391 --> 01:52:55,224
Supposedly,

4003
01:52:55,390 --> 01:52:55,870
but it's,

4004
01:52:55,870 --> 01:52:56,320
they don't,

4005
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,210
they can't verify if it's real or not.

4006
01:52:58,420 --> 01:52:59,070
What are you talking about?

4007
01:52:59,070 --> 01:52:59,660
It's a,

4008
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:00,910
the guy that got shot,

4009
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:01,953
uh,

4010
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:04,310
him like mugging an old man.

4011
01:53:04,311 --> 01:53:04,841
I solid.

4012
01:53:04,841 --> 01:53:05,410
It's bullshit.

4013
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:06,160
Is it bullshit?

4014
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:06,840
God?

4015
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:09,550
Cause I Snopes says an unknown.

4016
01:53:09,551 --> 01:53:12,160
If it's what makes you
think it's bullshit?

4017
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:13,990
Because it doesn't even
look like the same guy.

4018
01:53:14,110 --> 01:53:14,560
Oh,

4019
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,760
it's just like people,

4020
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,600
people still think all black guys look
the same and it just blatantly show.

4021
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:20,051
It's like,

4022
01:53:20,051 --> 01:53:21,370
what the fuck are you saying?

4023
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:22,150
Whoa.

4024
01:53:22,150 --> 01:53:23,140
That's what that's saying.

4025
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:24,093
That they don't,

4026
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:28,293
I think

4027
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:32,720
they look a lot alike.

4028
01:53:32,830 --> 01:53:33,220
Some of,

4029
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:33,650
Whoa,

4030
01:53:33,650 --> 01:53:34,390
some of those.

4031
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:35,223
Some of them,

4032
01:53:35,230 --> 01:53:35,920
yes.

4033
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:36,191
Okay.

4034
01:53:36,191 --> 01:53:37,720
White people just look very different.

4035
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:40,280
All white people are all like
different facial features.

4036
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:40,960
Rude as fuck.

4037
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:41,290
No,

4038
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:42,123
that's not rude.

4039
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:44,130
Why?

4040
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:44,780
People are so,

4041
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:45,560
they all look the same.

4042
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,000
I get them confused all the time.

4043
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:47,983
Yeah.

4044
01:53:48,290 --> 01:53:49,700
And why people are so different.

4045
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:51,020
Asians look the same.

4046
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:56,050
Puerto Rican women a lot of times with
the same whoa will never work in this

4047
01:53:56,931 --> 01:53:57,620
town again.

4048
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:58,310
Wow.

4049
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:59,110
How dare you.

4050
01:53:59,110 --> 01:53:59,960
Not Racist at all.

4051
01:53:59,961 --> 01:54:02,320
I'm just saying like I feel
like smell the same way.

4052
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:06,140
I'm just saying like white people
are the only ones that look really,

4053
01:54:06,141 --> 01:54:08,180
really different all the time.

4054
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:09,830
You don't agree with that?

4055
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:10,820
No.

4056
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:11,510
Oh,

4057
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:12,860
maybe I haven't seen enough people.

4058
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:19,070
You're only 24 kid when you accumulate
a database like we have and you want to

4059
01:54:19,071 --> 01:54:20,840
see black people with
the lights off anyways.

4060
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:21,351
Anyways,

4061
01:54:21,351 --> 01:54:22,670
I don't think it's him in the video.

4062
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:24,500
And I think people are
just looking for stuff in,

4063
01:54:24,501 --> 01:54:27,290
regardless if he wasn't
mugging an old man,

4064
01:54:27,590 --> 01:54:29,270
the video starts in the middle of a fight.

4065
01:54:29,271 --> 01:54:30,470
So you don't know what happens,

4066
01:54:30,471 --> 01:54:30,770
right?

4067
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:31,550
So people are just like,

4068
01:54:31,550 --> 01:54:31,701
oh,

4069
01:54:31,701 --> 01:54:32,960
he's just beating up this old dude.

4070
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,100
And it doesn't matter.

4071
01:54:34,101 --> 01:54:37,100
It doesn't mean you can kill someone
on a sidewalk for selling cigarettes no

4072
01:54:37,101 --> 01:54:38,230
matter what they used to do.

4073
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:40,540
You know what I'm most
fascinated by with this?

4074
01:54:40,930 --> 01:54:42,940
Not even just that it's a,

4075
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:47,590
it seems like weird still stuck
when it comes to race relations.

4076
01:54:47,591 --> 01:54:51,040
Like we're still stuck in
this US versus them mentality.

4077
01:54:51,041 --> 01:54:54,000
That just hasn't gone away that

4078
01:54:55,590 --> 01:54:56,530
that shocks me.

4079
01:54:56,531 --> 01:55:01,531
But what really shocks me is that they
just pick this one event and this one

4080
01:55:01,571 --> 01:55:06,400
event all of a sudden caught fire and
became giant because there's so many of

4081
01:55:06,401 --> 01:55:06,790
them.

4082
01:55:06,790 --> 01:55:08,350
If you look at the numbers of people,

4083
01:55:08,351 --> 01:55:09,010
like there's a,

4084
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:13,000
there's a website that tracks the numbers
of people killed by cops every year.

4085
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:13,930
And uh,

4086
01:55:13,930 --> 01:55:16,240
like I think it's called cop killer.

4087
01:55:16,270 --> 01:55:16,541
Dot.

4088
01:55:16,541 --> 01:55:17,374
Something or another.

4089
01:55:17,530 --> 01:55:19,060
Somebody tweeted to me
today and I was like,

4090
01:55:19,061 --> 01:55:19,894
what?

4091
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:20,341
And you,

4092
01:55:20,341 --> 01:55:24,400
you look at it like there's like the fact
that one just caught on and took off.

4093
01:55:24,430 --> 01:55:25,210
It's weird.

4094
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:25,840
Yeah.

4095
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:26,860
But that happens.

4096
01:55:26,950 --> 01:55:27,401
It happens.

4097
01:55:27,401 --> 01:55:31,840
Like one thing like makes its way to the
forefront and then the public grabs a

4098
01:55:31,841 --> 01:55:35,010
hold of it and then next thing you know
they're out in the street and then for

4099
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:35,741
it to happen.

4100
01:55:35,741 --> 01:55:38,320
And then right after that
Eric Gardner case happened.

4101
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:38,771
Like,

4102
01:55:38,771 --> 01:55:39,310
Whoa,

4103
01:55:39,310 --> 01:55:40,660
it's just like out of control.

4104
01:55:41,170 --> 01:55:41,450
You know,

4105
01:55:41,450 --> 01:55:42,460
it's a tsunami.

4106
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:44,490
Did you see the hashtags

4107
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:45,750
after that whole thing happened?

4108
01:55:45,751 --> 01:55:46,620
The climbing wall,

4109
01:55:46,621 --> 01:55:48,750
white and living while Black Hashtags,

4110
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:50,033
they're insane.

4111
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:54,690
It's a bunch of white people hashtagging
crying while white and admitting to

4112
01:55:54,691 --> 01:55:55,620
crimes they've done that.

4113
01:55:55,621 --> 01:55:56,100
The police,

4114
01:55:56,100 --> 01:56:00,510
like I got pulled over drunk with a gun
in my car and the police gave me a ride

4115
01:56:00,511 --> 01:56:01,140
home.

4116
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:03,540
And it's like all these
things that they're admitting
and then the living wall,

4117
01:56:03,541 --> 01:56:06,810
black ones were all
black people were like,

4118
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:09,030
I went into a store and got questioned.

4119
01:56:09,230 --> 01:56:09,630
Right.

4120
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:11,200
And it was like just
the difference between,

4121
01:56:11,201 --> 01:56:12,034
it was pretty interesting.

4122
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:14,810
I've definitely seen a lot
of those living wall black,

4123
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:16,103
you know,

4124
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:16,851
look,

4125
01:56:16,851 --> 01:56:18,740
I could see a lot of
different sides to this.

4126
01:56:19,130 --> 01:56:24,130
The bottom line of all of it is we have
to at a certain point in time realize he

4127
01:56:24,141 --> 01:56:28,580
can't just keep like letting these poor
people in these shit neighborhoods keep

4128
01:56:28,581 --> 01:56:31,070
growing up in these neighborhoods
and not try to help out.

4129
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:31,341
Right.

4130
01:56:31,341 --> 01:56:32,630
And I try to fix that spot.

4131
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:36,080
There's those spots that we have
in our country that are like really

4132
01:56:36,081 --> 01:56:36,741
impoverished.

4133
01:56:36,741 --> 01:56:41,120
Those are critical like errors in our
system and we're just sort of like letting

4134
01:56:41,121 --> 01:56:41,810
them percolate.

4135
01:56:41,810 --> 01:56:42,120
Yep.

4136
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:44,510
Less jail is more education I think.

4137
01:56:45,230 --> 01:56:48,350
Fuckable it's also like you could create
a bunch of Nice people instead of like

4138
01:56:48,351 --> 01:56:49,131
having people grow up,

4139
01:56:49,131 --> 01:56:50,540
disenfranchise and fucked up.

4140
01:56:50,541 --> 01:56:52,580
You'd have people grow up
to contribute to society,

4141
01:56:52,581 --> 01:56:56,030
but everyone's got this me or
US versus them or you know,

4142
01:56:56,031 --> 01:56:57,590
all for one and you know,

4143
01:56:57,591 --> 01:56:57,710
like,

4144
01:56:57,710 --> 01:56:58,543
we don't have this,

4145
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:01,470
this idea of treating
the human race was like,

4146
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:02,410
like a cola.

4147
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:03,550
If we treat treated,

4148
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,240
the human race is like an organism,

4149
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:06,890
like one collective Oregon,

4150
01:57:06,891 --> 01:57:07,401
a team,

4151
01:57:07,401 --> 01:57:07,761
you would say,

4152
01:57:07,761 --> 01:57:07,941
okay,

4153
01:57:07,941 --> 01:57:08,870
well we've got an issue here.

4154
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:12,650
Let's just clean up this issue and
figure out a way to manage everything

4155
01:57:12,651 --> 01:57:13,071
together.

4156
01:57:13,071 --> 01:57:15,650
Treat it as like one super organism.

4157
01:57:15,651 --> 01:57:16,401
That's our country.

4158
01:57:16,401 --> 01:57:16,890
One job.

4159
01:57:16,890 --> 01:57:19,610
Instead of thinking of it as just a bunch
of people living together on a patch

4160
01:57:19,611 --> 01:57:20,150
of dirt,

4161
01:57:20,150 --> 01:57:21,380
let's think of the human beings.

4162
01:57:21,381 --> 01:57:21,681
It's like,

4163
01:57:21,681 --> 01:57:21,861
look,

4164
01:57:21,861 --> 01:57:25,940
we can't separate from each other
unless you're a Weirdo hermit type dude.

4165
01:57:25,941 --> 01:57:27,260
This wants to live in the woods.

4166
01:57:27,261 --> 01:57:28,520
Everybody's around everybody.

4167
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:29,060
We're all,

4168
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:30,260
we all feed off of each other.

4169
01:57:30,261 --> 01:57:31,130
We interact with each other.

4170
01:57:31,131 --> 01:57:32,150
We exchange goods,

4171
01:57:32,151 --> 01:57:33,440
we exchange services.

4172
01:57:33,670 --> 01:57:34,401
I mean we need each other.

4173
01:57:34,401 --> 01:57:35,540
We're a part of a team,

4174
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:36,680
whether we like it or not,

4175
01:57:36,681 --> 01:57:37,431
human beings,

4176
01:57:37,431 --> 01:57:40,160
everybody we were around
is a part of our community.

4177
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,530
So I think some one,

4178
01:57:42,531 --> 01:57:45,800
one of these presidents somewhere along
the line is going to have to figure out

4179
01:57:45,801 --> 01:57:46,670
a way to,

4180
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:50,660
to say that in a way on television
where people listening go,

4181
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,500
oh yeah.

4182
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:52,340
So instead of saying,

4183
01:57:52,341 --> 01:57:52,521
well,

4184
01:57:52,521 --> 01:57:55,450
these welfare moms try to give
all these fucking welfare model,

4185
01:57:55,451 --> 01:57:55,610
you know,

4186
01:57:55,610 --> 01:57:56,690
every baby they have,

4187
01:57:56,691 --> 01:57:57,530
they get another check.

4188
01:57:57,531 --> 01:57:58,364
Like,

4189
01:57:58,430 --> 01:57:59,060
okay,

4190
01:57:59,060 --> 01:57:59,341
yeah,

4191
01:57:59,341 --> 01:57:59,460
it,

4192
01:57:59,460 --> 01:57:59,780
that's not,

4193
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:00,860
this is the least of our worries.

4194
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:01,580
Yeah.

4195
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:02,960
The big worry is this,

4196
01:58:02,990 --> 01:58:05,810
more or less people are growing up in
this crime ridden neighborhoods and then

4197
01:58:05,811 --> 01:58:09,350
they're just growing up and becoming
adults and then they go out into the world

4198
01:58:09,351 --> 01:58:09,681
and like,

4199
01:58:09,681 --> 01:58:11,810
you're dealing with a
bunch of human problems.

4200
01:58:11,950 --> 01:58:12,520
Yeah.

4201
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:14,320
The worst is really the prison system.

4202
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:14,771
Fuck.

4203
01:58:14,771 --> 01:58:15,191
Yeah.

4204
01:58:15,191 --> 01:58:15,530
It is.

4205
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:19,570
It's the worst of the worst of the worst
of our problems because I bet I've been

4206
01:58:19,571 --> 01:58:22,720
working on something recently that
us to do with presence and uh,

4207
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:24,160
and uh,

4208
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:29,160
so I found out about how the rest of the
world does it and how they completely

4209
01:58:29,801 --> 01:58:33,340
can rehabilitate people and
get them back in society.

4210
01:58:33,341 --> 01:58:36,870
And it's totally the
opposite here where the,

4211
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:40,840
you basically create a worse criminal
by sending them to prison and then you

4212
01:58:40,841 --> 01:58:43,510
send back out again and they
have no idea what to do.

4213
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:44,331
Not only that,

4214
01:58:44,331 --> 01:58:46,310
they make money off putting him in prison,

4215
01:58:46,311 --> 01:58:48,020
which is the most insane thing ever.

4216
01:58:48,021 --> 01:58:48,331
This is a,

4217
01:58:48,331 --> 01:58:51,650
a large number of private
prisons in this country.

4218
01:58:51,651 --> 01:58:55,760
And they lobby to make sure that laws are
in place that allow them to keep their

4219
01:58:55,761 --> 01:58:56,594
prisons full.

4220
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:56,980
Yeah.

4221
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:59,800
And they make all that money that they
get from the government and they'll give

4222
01:58:59,801 --> 01:59:00,240
the,

4223
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:00,910
the,

4224
01:59:00,910 --> 01:59:01,743
the prisoner,

4225
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:04,810
like at the tent city in Arizona,

4226
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:06,850
they eat like 60 cents.

4227
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:11,560
I think their meals are 40 cents per day
is what they're feeding the prisoner.

4228
01:59:11,830 --> 01:59:16,830
And they brag about feeding the dogs
more valuable food during the day.

4229
01:59:17,201 --> 01:59:17,970
Like the dog seat,

4230
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:19,780
like 70 cents worth of food per day.

4231
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:20,171
Yeah.

4232
01:59:20,171 --> 01:59:21,430
And they make them wear pink.

4233
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:22,323
Yeah,

4234
01:59:22,770 --> 01:59:23,603
that's so,

4235
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:26,410
and then they dump them out on the streets
when they're done with their sentence

4236
01:59:26,411 --> 01:59:27,710
and they don't have a job,

4237
01:59:27,711 --> 01:59:28,960
but they don't have good health.

4238
01:59:29,290 --> 01:59:31,030
And then they go and rob
a store again and again.

4239
01:59:31,031 --> 01:59:32,140
It could happen to anybody,

4240
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:33,123
you know?

4241
01:59:33,330 --> 01:59:33,571
I mean,

4242
01:59:33,571 --> 01:59:34,530
we're going to be in Phoenix.

4243
01:59:34,531 --> 01:59:34,741
What?

4244
01:59:34,741 --> 01:59:35,340
Tomorrow?

4245
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:38,340
Tomorrow and something could happen.

4246
01:59:38,341 --> 01:59:41,850
You know they see Ari and his weird nose.

4247
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:43,570
Do you think they might
think he's a terrorist?

4248
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:44,643
Maybe?

4249
01:59:45,950 --> 01:59:46,690
No.

4250
01:59:46,690 --> 01:59:47,260
Sure.

4251
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:48,280
If we're all together,

4252
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:48,790
I think we'll,

4253
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:49,060
we'll,

4254
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:49,630
we'll tell them.

4255
01:59:49,630 --> 01:59:50,320
Luckily,

4256
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:50,860
luckily our,

4257
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:52,330
he wears pink underwear anyway,

4258
01:59:52,331 --> 01:59:55,830
so we'll just Google his name and show
that he's a hilarious standup comedian.

4259
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:56,141
Look,

4260
01:59:56,141 --> 01:59:56,570
sir,

4261
01:59:56,570 --> 02:00:00,820

central special called paid regular?

4262
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:01,833
Yes.

4263
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:02,651
They're also Aaron,

4264
02:00:02,651 --> 02:00:03,191
his other one.

4265
02:00:03,191 --> 02:00:04,330
Bearen his other one now.

4266
02:00:05,090 --> 02:00:06,070
What was his last one?

4267
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:07,600
Ari's last special.

4268
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:09,543
Passive aggressive.

4269
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:09,821
Yeah.

4270
02:00:09,821 --> 02:00:11,440
The cost somewhere in that one too.

4271
02:00:11,860 --> 02:00:12,550
Oh yeah.

4272
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:15,850
Civic Hall across a revenge
of the Holocaust was a CD.

4273
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:18,190
Did he did these three things out?

4274
02:00:18,330 --> 02:00:19,630
Let's got revenge of the Holocaust.

4275
02:00:19,631 --> 02:00:22,750
Passive aggressive and then
this new one paid regular.

4276
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:24,423
Amazing.

4277
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:25,750
When are you going to release something,

4278
02:00:25,751 --> 02:00:26,021
Tony?

4279
02:00:26,021 --> 02:00:26,411
Hinchcliffe.

4280
02:00:26,411 --> 02:00:27,280
I know you're chomping at the bit.

4281
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:30,280
You hear me talk about Ra and I see
a little fucking juices get flying.

4282
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:31,150
Wait.

4283
02:00:31,150 --> 02:00:32,230
You get excited and tense.

4284
02:00:32,231 --> 02:00:33,520
That's what gives you these panic attacks.

4285
02:00:33,860 --> 02:00:34,380
So we give you,

4286
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:35,680
it gives you weird ear pains.

4287
02:00:35,710 --> 02:00:36,340
Ah,

4288
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:37,150
I'm going deaf.

4289
02:00:37,150 --> 02:00:37,361
No,

4290
02:00:37,361 --> 02:00:38,500
you're just freaking the fuck out.

4291
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:39,593
Wait,

4292
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:41,013
we're

4293
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:44,590
waiting for somebody
to offer me something.

4294
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:45,071
Okay.

4295
02:00:45,071 --> 02:00:45,821
Here's the next question.

4296
02:00:45,821 --> 02:00:47,080
When are you gonna quit the cancer sticks?

4297
02:00:48,030 --> 02:00:48,340
When,

4298
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:48,540
uh,

4299
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:48,850
when I,

4300
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:50,860
when somebody offers
me to shoot a special,

4301
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:51,940
that's what you're going to quit?

4302
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:52,450
Yeah.

4303
02:00:52,450 --> 02:00:52,961
And then you'd be like,

4304
02:00:52,961 --> 02:00:54,430
I can't quit now to fuck me up.

4305
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:55,360
I need him.

4306
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:57,100
I need him to calm me down
while I'm getting ready.

4307
02:00:57,101 --> 02:00:58,330
As soon as the specials over.

4308
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:00,180
And then after the specialist over,

4309
02:01:00,190 --> 02:01:00,480
you're like,

4310
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:01,510
I gotta write new material.

4311
02:01:01,511 --> 02:01:03,700
I can't be thinking about anything
other than writing new material.

4312
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:04,840
Once I have a new hour,

4313
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:05,980
then I'm gonna quit the cigarettes.

4314
02:01:05,981 --> 02:01:06,814
Yeah.

4315
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:10,610
And then I'm going to get my own TV show
and I can't quit smoking then cause I

4316
02:01:10,611 --> 02:01:11,840
want to smoke on the TV show.

4317
02:01:11,841 --> 02:01:12,930
Bring it back like Carson,

4318
02:01:15,990 --> 02:01:17,220
why don't you try cigars?

4319
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:18,481
Cigars.

4320
02:01:18,481 --> 02:01:19,141
You don't inhale.

4321
02:01:19,141 --> 02:01:20,730
They're supposed to be
better for your health.

4322
02:01:20,731 --> 02:01:22,320
That's how we'll Phil
Hartman quit smoking.

4323
02:01:22,530 --> 02:01:23,460
You could be just like Phil,

4324
02:01:23,570 --> 02:01:25,640
it's true and I would do that,

4325
02:01:25,641 --> 02:01:27,830
but everybody complains about everything.

4326
02:01:27,831 --> 02:01:29,750
You know the smell and
then this and and that.

4327
02:01:29,751 --> 02:01:31,370
Everybody's going to
complain no matter what.

4328
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:32,283
That's your look.

4329
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:33,243
That's your sugar.

4330
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:34,061
Shut up.

4331
02:01:34,061 --> 02:01:35,590
I'm trying to form a fucking image here.

4332
02:01:35,890 --> 02:01:36,730
That's your look dude.

4333
02:01:36,731 --> 02:01:37,520
Cigars,

4334
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:38,353
Fedora,

4335
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:39,473
cigar.

4336
02:01:41,190 --> 02:01:42,530
Hey guys,

4337
02:01:42,531 --> 02:01:43,490
let me fucking talk.

4338
02:01:44,290 --> 02:01:45,123
Cowboy.

4339
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:46,680
No,

4340
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:46,980
no,

4341
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:47,271
no,

4342
02:01:47,271 --> 02:01:47,631
no.

4343
02:01:47,631 --> 02:01:48,350
For Dora,

4344
02:01:48,350 --> 02:01:48,710
Bro,

4345
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:49,100
maybe.

4346
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:49,933
Maybe a cowboy hat.

4347
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:50,271
Okay.

4348
02:01:50,271 --> 02:01:50,780
Listen.

4349
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:51,950
Vast cowboy hat.

4350
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:53,300
Cigar.

4351
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:53,661
No,

4352
02:01:53,661 --> 02:01:54,441
no cowboy hats.

4353
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:55,260
I'm going to work.

4354
02:01:55,260 --> 02:01:56,130
I kiss him,

4355
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:58,310
but you look just like
woody from toy story.

4356
02:01:58,311 --> 02:01:59,180
If he wears a cowboy hat,

4357
02:01:59,450 --> 02:01:59,721
here's,

4358
02:01:59,721 --> 02:02:00,261
here's the deal.

4359
02:02:00,261 --> 02:02:01,700
Three piece suit Mohawk.

4360
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:02,900
Okay.

4361
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:06,630
Three piece suit with a fucking solid
Mohawk smoking a cigar on stage.

4362
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:08,660
What happened to all gold?

4363
02:02:08,661 --> 02:02:12,440
See gold tie the mastermind.

4364
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,790
I could see you with a scarf.

4365
02:02:16,791 --> 02:02:17,601
If you wear a scarf,

4366
02:02:17,601 --> 02:02:18,650
you're either gay or a cowboy.

4367
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:19,550
You have two options,

4368
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:20,210
right?

4369
02:02:20,210 --> 02:02:20,541
Yeah.

4370
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:20,841
Tony,

4371
02:02:20,841 --> 02:02:21,381
you look a lot like,

4372
02:02:21,381 --> 02:02:21,560
yeah,

4373
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:24,860
you can't be like a straight guy out
for a night on the town with a fucking

4374
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:26,300
Bandana around your neck.

4375
02:02:26,850 --> 02:02:27,100
Well,

4376
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:28,880
what kind of a guy wears
a Bandana around his neck?

4377
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:30,800
Tony in this cartoon,

4378
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,900
the guy who wants you to choke
them unconscious and fuck him.

4379
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:37,310
Well the guy wants you to squeeze that
thing until he blacks out and give them a

4380
02:02:37,311 --> 02:02:38,144
good fucking,

4381
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:41,900
there's no other reason for a man unless
he's worried about dirt getting into

4382
02:02:41,901 --> 02:02:42,734
his neck,

4383
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:43,610
you know?

4384
02:02:43,610 --> 02:02:47,630
That's why I better get an
audition for woody if that happens.

4385
02:02:47,631 --> 02:02:51,500
Do you think there'll be a live action
toy story and maybe why would they do

4386
02:02:51,501 --> 02:02:52,334
that?

4387
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:53,540
There'll be so dumb.

4388
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:54,141
The kids would be like,

4389
02:02:54,141 --> 02:02:55,310
why are we seeing real people?

4390
02:02:55,311 --> 02:02:58,490
Where the fuck is woody
playing with other adults?

4391
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,833
Toy Box.

4392
02:03:00,250 --> 02:03:01,083
You'd perfect.

4393
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:02,793
Weird.

4394
02:03:02,870 --> 02:03:03,111
Yeah.

4395
02:03:03,111 --> 02:03:06,170
You'd be perfect for the twilight
zone version when woody comes to life.

4396
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:06,830
Yes.

4397
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:07,281
Yeah.

4398
02:03:07,281 --> 02:03:08,480
Like the parents don't see it,

4399
02:03:08,481 --> 02:03:12,170
but the kid does and you're giving the
kid really fucked up advice and you're

4400
02:03:12,171 --> 02:03:12,730
woody.

4401
02:03:12,730 --> 02:03:13,130
Yeah.

4402
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:16,010
And the parents come in and all of a
sudden you're back to being like a wooden

4403
02:03:16,011 --> 02:03:16,580
doll again.

4404
02:03:16,580 --> 02:03:16,881
Mommy,

4405
02:03:16,881 --> 02:03:18,850
my doll was just smoking a cigarette.

4406
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:20,360
Dude,

4407
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:20,780
I watched,

4408
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:22,550
I binge watched a few of those recently.

4409
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:25,040
Those old school twilight
zone episodes the best.

4410
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,170
It was so amazing.

4411
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:27,591
You know,

4412
02:03:27,591 --> 02:03:31,970
one of the cool things about it is they
had so many different subjects to choose

4413
02:03:31,971 --> 02:03:33,710
from and they had to do it with a,

4414
02:03:33,711 --> 02:03:35,510
like a relatively small budget.

4415
02:03:35,690 --> 02:03:39,560
I didn't have much in terms
of like special effects.

4416
02:03:39,790 --> 02:03:40,221
I'll give you,

4417
02:03:40,221 --> 02:03:42,860
go back and look at like some
of the old special effects.

4418
02:03:42,861 --> 02:03:44,540
They were unbelievably laughable.

4419
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:44,930
Yeah.

4420
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:47,420
I just watched toilet isn't
this morning before I really,

4421
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:48,560
which episode was it?

4422
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:49,520
Uh,

4423
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:51,560
the one beauty is only skin deep,

4424
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:55,070
great episode where the
girls wants to fix our face.

4425
02:03:55,071 --> 02:03:56,210
They don't show it the whole time.

4426
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:57,890
They don't show the doctors' faces either.

4427
02:03:57,891 --> 02:04:00,350
And at the end she's like
beautiful and everyone's hideous.

4428
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,280
Oh Wow.

4429
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:01,640
And they're like,

4430
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:03,500
we're going to send you
off with people like you.

4431
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:04,461
And at the end,

4432
02:04:04,461 --> 02:04:04,941
it's just like,

4433
02:04:04,941 --> 02:04:06,230
she just wanted to be like them.

4434
02:04:06,590 --> 02:04:07,423
Oh my God.

4435
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:08,533
Oh,

4436
02:04:08,570 --> 02:04:09,440
spoiler alert.

4437
02:04:10,510 --> 02:04:11,930
It doesn't matter if they're so awesome.

4438
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:14,270
When the guy was cleaning
on the airplane wing.

4439
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:14,660
Yes.

4440
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:16,220
That one was William Shatner.

4441
02:04:16,610 --> 02:04:18,200
Cause I'm mad at the wake of this plane.

4442
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:20,330
Amazing.

4443
02:04:20,330 --> 02:04:21,530
And the fucking outfit,

4444
02:04:21,531 --> 02:04:23,300
the thing hat on was so bad,

4445
02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:24,080
so bad.

4446
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:24,913
He was a furry,

4447
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:26,210
it was essentially like a fairy,

4448
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:28,640
like one of those people that goes to
those conventions dresses up like a

4449
02:04:28,641 --> 02:04:29,270
mascot.

4450
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:29,451
Yeah.

4451
02:04:29,451 --> 02:04:30,141
That's what it looked like.

4452
02:04:30,141 --> 02:04:30,521
And he slipped,

4453
02:04:30,521 --> 02:04:32,900
pretended to be like
this like Gremlin John,

4454
02:04:32,901 --> 02:04:37,530
like pig Chewbacca picture with
John Lithgow was the remake of it.

4455
02:04:37,531 --> 02:04:37,770
Yeah.

4456
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:37,980
In the

4457
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:38,460
movie.

4458
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:39,560
Which is really good too.

4459
02:04:39,650 --> 02:04:40,560
He's amazing.

4460
02:04:40,590 --> 02:04:40,910
Yeah.

4461
02:04:40,910 --> 02:04:41,743
Yeah,

4462
02:04:42,210 --> 02:04:42,361
yeah.

4463
02:04:42,361 --> 02:04:44,340
Their premise is we're so genius.

4464
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:45,840
There was so many good ones.

4465
02:04:45,841 --> 02:04:48,060
My favorite one was to serve man.

4466
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:49,800
Did you ever see that one?

4467
02:04:49,890 --> 02:04:51,090
Oh it's the best.

4468
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:53,750
These aliens came down and they,

4469
02:04:53,751 --> 02:04:56,760
they brought with them this book and um,

4470
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:59,550
they were going to take people back
to their planet and people like it all

4471
02:04:59,551 --> 02:05:01,380
signed up to go to their planet.

4472
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:02,520
And the,

4473
02:05:02,580 --> 02:05:05,850
the idea of the book was they're
going to teach people about all their

4474
02:05:05,851 --> 02:05:07,740
technology and how to,

4475
02:05:07,741 --> 02:05:07,981
you know,

4476
02:05:07,981 --> 02:05:09,480
how to space travel and all that shit.

4477
02:05:09,630 --> 02:05:13,710
So they get these people on the ship
and as they're hurting them on the ship,

4478
02:05:13,711 --> 02:05:16,710
they're all like much bigger than regular
people as they're hurting them on the

4479
02:05:16,711 --> 02:05:17,520
ship.

4480
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:18,370
The Guy Yells at,

4481
02:05:18,371 --> 02:05:19,890
or it's a guy or a girl yells out,

4482
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:23,730
it's a cookbook to serve man.

4483
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:24,211
Like,

4484
02:05:24,211 --> 02:05:24,481
you know,

4485
02:05:24,481 --> 02:05:28,350
like they thought that the title to
serve man was giving man all these

4486
02:05:28,351 --> 02:05:32,520
instructions and they deciphered all the
different shit and they realize they're

4487
02:05:32,521 --> 02:05:35,610
going to eat all these
people and so taken off.

4488
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:37,950
They take off of these
people in this space share,

4489
02:05:37,951 --> 02:05:38,850
but they're going to eat him.

4490
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:39,853
Wow.

4491
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:41,193
It's great.

4492
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:44,820
And it's so Cokie looking
like everything is hokey.

4493
02:05:44,821 --> 02:05:46,140
This space guys are hooky.

4494
02:05:46,141 --> 02:05:47,130
Look into space.

4495
02:05:47,131 --> 02:05:48,390
Ship is hokey looking.

4496
02:05:49,250 --> 02:05:51,360
Hitchcock holds up to fuck.

4497
02:05:51,361 --> 02:05:52,800
Yag does amazing.

4498
02:05:53,010 --> 02:05:54,120
Well that's when we were talking about,

4499
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:54,630
um,

4500
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:57,110
like gene wilder and
Richard Pryor movies like I,

4501
02:05:57,150 --> 02:05:59,340
I almost don't want to watch
them to see if they hold up.

4502
02:05:59,341 --> 02:06:00,960
But Richard Pryor stand up,

4503
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:02,160
totally holds up.

4504
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:05,250
Totally holds up an undisputed,

4505
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:07,770
undisputed like number one of all time.

4506
02:06:08,370 --> 02:06:11,970
Well I think that he was
like the most influential,

4507
02:06:11,971 --> 02:06:12,750
right?

4508
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:14,190
He was like the most powerful,

4509
02:06:14,191 --> 02:06:16,260
he's like changed what comedy is too.

4510
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:17,850
A lot of people like his honesty,

4511
02:06:17,851 --> 02:06:19,380
like when he was on fire and Shit,

4512
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:20,041
you know,

4513
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:21,840
it changed what comedy is to people.

4514
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:22,703
Yeah.

4515
02:06:23,730 --> 02:06:24,330
Yeah.

4516
02:06:24,330 --> 02:06:26,640
I just like when you were talking about
sitting in the back of the room and

4517
02:06:26,641 --> 02:06:27,570
watching people laugh,

4518
02:06:27,690 --> 02:06:31,200
that was like the moment that I ever
realized how crazy standup comedy was.

4519
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:33,540
My parents took me to see
live in the sunset strip.

4520
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:34,890
I was in the audience.

4521
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:35,371
I was like,

4522
02:06:35,371 --> 02:06:35,610
you know,

4523
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:39,690
little kid 13 or something and all these
people were like falling down laughing

4524
02:06:39,691 --> 02:06:40,201
in the crowd.

4525
02:06:40,201 --> 02:06:41,040
And I remember thinking,

4526
02:06:41,041 --> 02:06:42,240
I've never seen this before.

4527
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:43,080
I give us a bit,

4528
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:44,370
I've been a lot of comedy movies.

4529
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,260
I've never seen anybody fallen down.

4530
02:06:46,410 --> 02:06:47,610
And this guy's just talking.

4531
02:06:48,090 --> 02:06:48,410
I was like,

4532
02:06:48,410 --> 02:06:48,901
I was thinking like,

4533
02:06:48,901 --> 02:06:50,610
this is the funniest thing
I probably have ever seen.

4534
02:06:50,611 --> 02:06:51,444
And he's just talking

4535
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:53,873
crazy.

4536
02:06:54,780 --> 02:06:55,613
He's the one.

4537
02:06:55,890 --> 02:06:56,221
Yeah.

4538
02:06:56,221 --> 02:06:58,050
And that was at the store
in the fucking main room.

4539
02:06:58,270 --> 02:06:59,850
That's theirs to something
weird about that.

4540
02:06:59,851 --> 02:07:02,160
Like when you're standing
on that stage in that,

4541
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,450
in that room and you realize,

4542
02:07:03,451 --> 02:07:03,661
Whoa,

4543
02:07:03,661 --> 02:07:07,490
this is where Richard Pryor film
live on the sunset strip mother.

4544
02:07:08,930 --> 02:07:10,090
So cool.

4545
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:12,273
Yeah.

4546
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:13,500
Do you guys uh,

4547
02:07:13,530 --> 02:07:16,590
get that like weird charge at a
working at the store because of that?

4548
02:07:16,591 --> 02:07:17,790
Because of the history behind it all.

4549
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:20,370
Totally cool.

4550
02:07:20,371 --> 02:07:21,480
How you're,

4551
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:22,860
how you perceive it.

4552
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:26,700
Like if reception of the store just
changes like the money that you hang out

4553
02:07:26,701 --> 02:07:27,151
there,

4554
02:07:27,151 --> 02:07:28,890
the more that you're immersed in it.

4555
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:29,880
The last weird today is,

4556
02:07:29,881 --> 02:07:31,500
and then you bring your normal
friends and they're like,

4557
02:07:31,501 --> 02:07:32,370
what the hell?

4558
02:07:33,710 --> 02:07:34,530
Yeah.

4559
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:36,040
You bring non comedians the store and

4560
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:36,251
they're like,

4561
02:07:36,251 --> 02:07:37,240
what is this?

4562
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:37,721
How is this?

4563
02:07:37,721 --> 02:07:38,554
Okay.

4564
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:40,053
Why are these people,

4565
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:41,560
how often do you come here again,

4566
02:07:42,190 --> 02:07:43,150
this is your home.

4567
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:44,833
What the hell?

4568
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:45,611
Well for Ari,

4569
02:07:45,611 --> 02:07:46,121
it really was.

4570
02:07:46,121 --> 02:07:48,010
His home are used to walk there.

4571
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:49,780
He lived right up the street.

4572
02:07:49,781 --> 02:07:51,310
He lived right next to pink dot.

4573
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:54,810
So he would just walk to his fucking
apartment and walked down the store every

4574
02:07:54,811 --> 02:07:56,200
day and he was there every day.

4575
02:07:56,410 --> 02:07:58,120
That dude lived in that place.

4576
02:07:58,870 --> 02:08:00,340
I remember when I first
started hanging out there,

4577
02:08:00,341 --> 02:08:03,310
someone in the green room called
it the island of misfit toys.

4578
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:03,911
I was like,

4579
02:08:03,911 --> 02:08:04,744
that's perfect.

4580
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:06,430
Exactly what it is.

4581
02:08:06,450 --> 02:08:06,630
Yeah.

4582
02:08:06,630 --> 02:08:08,890
I think that was Mitsis term.

4583
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:10,240
I'm pretty sure.

4584
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:11,950
I think it was right.

4585
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:14,140
What do you write in their felony?

4586
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:14,760
Got an idea.

4587
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:17,140
Got something crazy
little comedy on the mind.

4588
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:18,413
No,

4589
02:08:19,350 --> 02:08:21,000
something funny happened
last night though.

4590
02:08:21,001 --> 02:08:21,860
I uh,

4591
02:08:22,010 --> 02:08:23,130
I was driving home from the,

4592
02:08:23,131 --> 02:08:26,220
I are driving to the comedy store from
the Ice House and there was an amber

4593
02:08:26,221 --> 02:08:27,570
alert on a,

4594
02:08:28,530 --> 02:08:32,370
on the radio and the guy
had a nicer car than mine.

4595
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:34,440
The abductor,

4596
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:35,370
and I'm like,

4597
02:08:35,370 --> 02:08:37,290
this guy needs to get his
fucking life together.

4598
02:08:37,320 --> 02:08:40,860
2014 Mercedes Benz I'm supposed
to be on the lookout for.

4599
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:41,770
Really?

4600
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:42,603
Yeah.

4601
02:08:42,670 --> 02:08:43,830
Well yeah,

4602
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:48,840
but it must be really hard to make it
in life when you're like a serial killer

4603
02:08:49,211 --> 02:08:52,030
or like a child molester or
something along those lines,

4604
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,320
like struggling with that.

4605
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:54,820
And being super successful.

4606
02:08:54,860 --> 02:08:55,693
Yeah.

4607
02:08:55,780 --> 02:08:56,710
That's kind of crazy.

4608
02:08:56,711 --> 02:08:57,544
That's what I'm thinking.

4609
02:08:57,550 --> 02:09:02,550
This guy lives the kind of life where
he wanted to be seen in a 2014 Mercedes

4610
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:08,520
Benz and now he's the only guy with a
2014 Mercedes Benz who wants nobody to see

4611
02:09:08,711 --> 02:09:09,544
it.

4612
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:12,030
Maybe he only likes kids with tastes.

4613
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:16,500
It's like some American
psycho stuff right there.

4614
02:09:16,860 --> 02:09:17,161
Yeah,

4615
02:09:17,161 --> 02:09:17,490
right.

4616
02:09:17,490 --> 02:09:18,780
Well wasn't that the case with the,

4617
02:09:18,781 --> 02:09:20,370
there was a guy that was on that show,

4618
02:09:20,371 --> 02:09:21,151
seventh heaven.

4619
02:09:21,151 --> 02:09:24,720
It turned out he was molesting
girls like young girls like that.

4620
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:26,760
I mean obviously that guy get a Mercedes.

4621
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:27,560
Right?

4622
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:28,120
I mean it's,

4623
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:33,120
sometimes people do get super
wealthy while being sex criminals.

4624
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:34,330
Yeah.

4625
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:35,250
Such a crush on him.

4626
02:09:35,251 --> 02:09:36,240
When I was younger did June,

4627
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:39,000
he could've gotten it for probably
the dad from seventh heaven.

4628
02:09:39,610 --> 02:09:40,443
How old?

4629
02:09:40,830 --> 02:09:43,380
How old do you think you would have to
be before you would give it up to him?

4630
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:44,101
Oh my God.

4631
02:09:44,101 --> 02:09:48,470
When I was watching [inaudible] was
watching it when I was like 12 or 13 four

4632
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:50,340
and if you had met him at that time,

4633
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:53,060
wouldn't have fucked him cause I
wasn't like a whore 14 year old.

4634
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:53,700
Right.

4635
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:54,750
But would would,

4636
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:57,450
do you think that you would have been
like interested in hanging around with

4637
02:09:57,451 --> 02:09:58,284
them?

4638
02:09:58,440 --> 02:09:59,370
I was obsessed with them.

4639
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:01,820
I was like so good dad from seventh.

4640
02:10:02,030 --> 02:10:03,390
I was obsessed with him.

4641
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:06,150
I kind of liked him too on the show.

4642
02:10:06,151 --> 02:10:06,850
Seventh Heaven.

4643
02:10:06,850 --> 02:10:07,280
Yeah.

4644
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:08,490
So you guys were children.

4645
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:11,190
You guys were fans of seven.

4646
02:10:12,930 --> 02:10:15,270
I used to watch it in like fifth grade.

4647
02:10:15,330 --> 02:10:17,580
I've seen every episode
and I watched him again.

4648
02:10:17,610 --> 02:10:19,140
I'm not going to lie like four months ago.

4649
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:19,830
Whoa,

4650
02:10:19,830 --> 02:10:20,663
whoa.

4651
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:22,870
That's how I learn what huffing
was because one of them,

4652
02:10:22,871 --> 02:10:23,704
so was how you were saying

4653
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,630
that's when you know you uh,

4654
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:33,120
you fucking have fucked up beyond
fucked up when they were arresting you,

4655
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:34,640
you got paint all over your face.

4656
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:37,610
Paint on his face.

4657
02:10:37,611 --> 02:10:38,421
No huffing.

4658
02:10:38,421 --> 02:10:38,630
No.

4659
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:39,620
Oh yeah.

4660
02:10:40,030 --> 02:10:40,510
That shit's,

4661
02:10:40,510 --> 02:10:41,650
people just get caught huffing.

4662
02:10:41,651 --> 02:10:43,000
If you've seen those photos of dudes,

4663
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:45,660
there's this one dude just
looks method out of his mind,

4664
02:10:45,661 --> 02:10:49,180
like silver paint all over his nose and
his lips and his mouth and you're like,

4665
02:10:49,181 --> 02:10:49,841
oh my God,

4666
02:10:49,841 --> 02:10:50,530
dude,

4667
02:10:50,530 --> 02:10:51,460
welcome to this is,

4668
02:10:51,490 --> 02:10:52,360
this is the bottom.

4669
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:53,950
Just hit the bottom.

4670
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:55,510
It doesn't go anywhere from here,

4671
02:10:55,511 --> 02:10:56,344
but up.

4672
02:10:56,820 --> 02:10:59,940
That's some of the best
episodes of cops too,

4673
02:10:59,941 --> 02:11:01,710
when they always catch
the guys with the silver,

4674
02:11:03,650 --> 02:11:04,650
but it's something about,

4675
02:11:04,660 --> 02:11:05,700
I wasn't doing nothing.

4676
02:11:05,701 --> 02:11:08,700
Officer don't shows that
appeals to like younger people.

4677
02:11:08,701 --> 02:11:10,050
That would look a little
bit more innocent,

4678
02:11:10,051 --> 02:11:10,884
right?

4679
02:11:11,150 --> 02:11:11,550
Yeah.

4680
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:12,271
Now I watch it.

4681
02:11:12,271 --> 02:11:12,570
I'm like,

4682
02:11:12,570 --> 02:11:13,170
Whoa,

4683
02:11:13,170 --> 02:11:13,951
that was a mister rack.

4684
02:11:13,951 --> 02:11:15,600
Like I thought I was learning so much.

4685
02:11:15,601 --> 02:11:15,841
I'm like,

4686
02:11:15,841 --> 02:11:18,060
I'm in the world and learning
about huffing and ready.

4687
02:11:18,250 --> 02:11:18,781
It's great.

4688
02:11:18,781 --> 02:11:19,614
Let's go.

4689
02:11:20,150 --> 02:11:21,600
That's how I learned a lot of stuff.

4690
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:23,871
Dump show.

4691
02:11:23,871 --> 02:11:26,450
That's one of the things
you don't like as an adult.

4692
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:29,930
You don't always piece it together
like this show is awesome.

4693
02:11:29,931 --> 02:11:31,790
If you're 12 you know?

4694
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:32,031
Yeah,

4695
02:11:32,031 --> 02:11:36,170
it's stupid as fuck when you're 15
but when you're 12 it's awesome.

4696
02:11:36,171 --> 02:11:36,801
When you 30,

4697
02:11:36,801 --> 02:11:37,634
you can't watch that,

4698
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:38,960
but when you're 12,

4699
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:40,480
it gets you just,

4700
02:11:40,770 --> 02:11:43,190
it hits a certain tone inside of you.

4701
02:11:43,570 --> 02:11:45,380
It's like the costumes in the
twilight zone and you're like,

4702
02:11:45,381 --> 02:11:46,970
how did I think this was scary?

4703
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,140
But that was a long time ago,

4704
02:11:48,141 --> 02:11:48,740
you know?

4705
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:49,100
Wow.

4706
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:50,630
This seventh Heaven Guy,

4707
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:53,330
like that show was all
about like a preacher,

4708
02:11:53,331 --> 02:11:54,164
right

4709
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:56,500
in his family.

4710
02:11:57,580 --> 02:11:58,540
He's the preacher.

4711
02:11:58,630 --> 02:12:00,040
He was a preacher in the show.

4712
02:12:00,041 --> 02:12:00,730
Yeah.

4713
02:12:00,730 --> 02:12:02,890
Maybe he was just doing
research for his role.

4714
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:10,920
I just found a great video of this
paint huffer and series of his,

4715
02:12:11,050 --> 02:12:11,620
uh,

4716
02:12:11,620 --> 02:12:13,090
over 14 years of his,

4717
02:12:13,190 --> 02:12:14,440
his mugshots.

4718
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:14,711
Oh,

4719
02:12:14,711 --> 02:12:15,311
good Lord.

4720
02:12:15,311 --> 02:12:16,144
And it's a,

4721
02:12:16,810 --> 02:12:18,490
it starts off 14 years.

4722
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:23,920
Guy Roast battle does look
like someone pretty crazy.

4723
02:12:24,450 --> 02:12:25,283
2009,

4724
02:12:25,290 --> 02:12:26,170
whoa.

4725
02:12:26,171 --> 02:12:27,280
Later in 2009,

4726
02:12:27,310 --> 02:12:28,300
he didn't look so good.

4727
02:12:29,860 --> 02:12:34,860
Oh my [inaudible] in the Ronald McDonald.

4728
02:12:35,950 --> 02:12:37,090
Every time they were arresting him,

4729
02:12:37,091 --> 02:12:38,230
he's got silver in his face.

4730
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:40,600
He likes that color of March,

4731
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:40,690
2009.

4732
02:12:40,690 --> 02:12:41,560
February,

4733
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:41,561
2000.

4734
02:12:41,561 --> 02:12:42,610
Why are they going back and forth?

4735
02:12:42,611 --> 02:12:43,810
Rowdy Roddy huffer over.

4736
02:12:43,811 --> 02:12:44,531
It doesn't make any sense.

4737
02:12:44,531 --> 02:12:48,670
They went from March to a
breakout or something going on?

4738
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:48,941
Yeah.

4739
02:12:48,941 --> 02:12:49,690
What does he get?

4740
02:12:49,690 --> 02:12:50,540
Clumps in his beard.

4741
02:12:50,980 --> 02:12:52,870
All paint his beard,

4742
02:12:53,110 --> 02:12:54,130
but this is going backwards.

4743
02:12:54,131 --> 02:12:54,964
This is February.

4744
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:56,680
This is going January.

4745
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,270
Like how is it going backwards?

4746
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,370
It's such a bad huffing problem,

4747
02:13:01,810 --> 02:13:04,090
but this is weird because it's
not showing like a progression.

4748
02:13:04,091 --> 02:13:05,140
It's showing a regression.

4749
02:13:06,180 --> 02:13:07,250
Oh,

4750
02:13:08,950 --> 02:13:09,540
okay.

4751
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:12,700
But that's 2008 back in time backwards.

4752
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:15,130
Just to show you how
long he's been doing it.

4753
02:13:15,310 --> 02:13:17,440
He actually looks better
because of huffing paint,

4754
02:13:17,710 --> 02:13:19,840
I think in huffing paint might
be actually good for this dude.

4755
02:13:19,841 --> 02:13:20,110
He's like,

4756
02:13:20,110 --> 02:13:20,943
you don't get it.

4757
02:13:21,130 --> 02:13:21,671
Oh my God.

4758
02:13:21,671 --> 02:13:22,960
They busted him huffing paint.

4759
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:28,000
2000 and 5,003 was huffing paint

4760
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:31,320
all over his face.

4761
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:34,080
Oh my God.

4762
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:35,250
That's hilarious.

4763
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:36,083
Oh Jeez.

4764
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:40,320
Eight first busted in [inaudible] 98 why?

4765
02:13:40,321 --> 02:13:40,621
He was like,

4766
02:13:40,621 --> 02:13:41,160
Whoa,

4767
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:41,993
what's that?

4768
02:13:42,450 --> 02:13:43,550
He's the captain and anneal.

4769
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:45,510
This guy looks so different.

4770
02:13:45,511 --> 02:13:46,344
He could be an actor.

4771
02:13:46,790 --> 02:13:48,410
It's going to end on [inaudible]

4772
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:52,950
95 I feel like we should do a
documentary around that guy.

4773
02:13:53,620 --> 02:13:54,510
Give Him all the painting,

4774
02:13:54,511 --> 02:13:55,550
wants it,

4775
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:56,460
faces of death.

4776
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:57,630
Ask him what he feels about life.

4777
02:13:57,630 --> 02:13:59,700
Give them like certain subjects
and ask him to expound.

4778
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:00,240
Yeah,

4779
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:04,290
just film for like 10 hours and you can
get 40 minutes of wisdom out of that.

4780
02:14:04,410 --> 02:14:06,570
Do you think he started with
sharpies and then he graduated?

4781
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:10,350
I remember as a kid
just sniffing sharpies.

4782
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:10,770
Yeah.

4783
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:11,910
Get them right up to my nose.

4784
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:12,610
Just,

4785
02:14:12,610 --> 02:14:13,150
Yup.

4786
02:14:13,150 --> 02:14:13,430
Yeah.

4787
02:14:13,430 --> 02:14:14,700
Especially those fat ones.

4788
02:14:14,701 --> 02:14:16,140
The fact silver ones.

4789
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:17,100
Yeah.

4790
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:17,820
The best.

4791
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:20,190
What is it about certain smells like that?

4792
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:21,120
Gasoline.

4793
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:22,433
So what it is,

4794
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:23,393
it's the best.

4795
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:23,740
No,

4796
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:25,110
it's just that gasoline.

4797
02:14:25,111 --> 02:14:26,160
The smell of alcohol,

4798
02:14:26,161 --> 02:14:27,120
like rubbing alcohol.

4799
02:14:27,650 --> 02:14:27,900
Right.

4800
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:31,140
But what is it about those
smells that like attracts people?

4801
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:33,380
Because it's like you want to keep it.

4802
02:14:33,570 --> 02:14:34,980
We all love it so hard.

4803
02:14:35,190 --> 02:14:35,880
Everybody does.

4804
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:36,450
Yeah.

4805
02:14:36,450 --> 02:14:38,220
I'd never met anybody who
doesn't like the smell markers.

4806
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:39,090
Do you like smell Marcus?

4807
02:14:39,091 --> 02:14:39,420
Jamie?

4808
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:40,253
Yes.

4809
02:14:40,410 --> 02:14:40,771
He says,

4810
02:14:40,771 --> 02:14:40,891
yeah,

4811
02:14:40,891 --> 02:14:41,671
he's got a marker right there.

4812
02:14:41,671 --> 02:14:43,160
He's practicing Brian.

4813
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:43,430
I,

4814
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:43,801
yeah,

4815
02:14:43,801 --> 02:14:46,020
but I used to hate the smell of skunks,

4816
02:14:46,021 --> 02:14:47,430
but now as a pot smoker,

4817
02:14:47,431 --> 02:14:48,250
I love skunks.

4818
02:14:48,250 --> 02:14:50,640
I loved the smell of shut
downs when I was let off.

4819
02:14:51,190 --> 02:14:52,023
That's interesting.

4820
02:14:52,030 --> 02:14:55,570
Do you know that it was explained to
me or I read it somewhere actually that

4821
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:55,990
the,

4822
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:57,850
when you smell skunk smell,

4823
02:14:58,060 --> 02:15:00,100
that's how good a dog's nose is,

4824
02:15:00,370 --> 02:15:04,980
is that skunk is such a particularly
strong smell that you could smell it and

4825
02:15:04,990 --> 02:15:07,330
like just a few parts
per million in the air.

4826
02:15:07,570 --> 02:15:10,270
That's why like you can be driving on
the street and you could smell a skunk

4827
02:15:10,271 --> 02:15:11,500
that's nowhere near your car,

4828
02:15:11,530 --> 02:15:12,250
right?

4829
02:15:12,250 --> 02:15:13,120
It's like nowhere near,

4830
02:15:13,121 --> 02:15:15,190
not even a hundred feet from
your car and you smell a skunk.

4831
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:16,051
How the fuck can you smell it?

4832
02:15:16,051 --> 02:15:16,660
It's gone.

4833
02:15:16,660 --> 02:15:18,790
Well that's how a dog is with everything.

4834
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:21,790
That's why dogs can like find dudes that
are like running through the woods by

4835
02:15:21,791 --> 02:15:22,690
sniffing their socks.

4836
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:23,950
They're like sniff the guys sock.

4837
02:15:23,951 --> 02:15:26,200
They get a set and they
go off like they just,

4838
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:26,950
they just,

4839
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:27,491
just like,

4840
02:15:27,491 --> 02:15:28,570
you could smell a skunk like,

4841
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:28,751
oh,

4842
02:15:28,751 --> 02:15:29,320
it's over here.

4843
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:29,861
It's over here.

4844
02:15:29,861 --> 02:15:32,560
Like you know like roughly as
you're walking in the street,

4845
02:15:32,561 --> 02:15:34,300
if you're getting closer
to where that skunk is,

4846
02:15:34,750 --> 02:15:35,770
which is incredible.

4847
02:15:35,830 --> 02:15:36,530
If you think about,

4848
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:38,500
there's no other smell like that for us.

4849
02:15:38,501 --> 02:15:40,000
We're just such a small amount.

4850
02:15:40,540 --> 02:15:41,321
Maybe they'll stink.

4851
02:15:41,321 --> 02:15:41,831
Bomb things.

4852
02:15:41,831 --> 02:15:43,720
Remember those fucking things
they used to throw in school?

4853
02:15:43,870 --> 02:15:44,471
Oh yeah.

4854
02:15:44,471 --> 02:15:46,750
The little Capri Sun bags of us.

4855
02:15:46,751 --> 02:15:48,700
Think those little things.

4856
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:49,241
Well,

4857
02:15:49,241 --> 02:15:49,781
there will,

4858
02:15:49,781 --> 02:15:50,411
when I was a kid,

4859
02:15:50,411 --> 02:15:53,800
they were like these little glass vials
and they would throw them in the ground,

4860
02:15:53,801 --> 02:15:56,330
shadow them and the whole school,

4861
02:15:56,331 --> 02:15:57,550
it's just stink.

4862
02:15:57,890 --> 02:16:01,690
One asshole threw him in the ventilation
system of the air conditioning system.

4863
02:16:02,630 --> 02:16:03,463
That's all right.

4864
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:04,011
Yeah.

4865
02:16:04,011 --> 02:16:06,800
He fucked the entire room up like the,

4866
02:16:06,801 --> 02:16:09,170
the whole class had to get evacuated.

4867
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:11,120
It was so bad.

4868
02:16:11,121 --> 02:16:13,070
Like he just thrown it into the system,

4869
02:16:13,550 --> 02:16:14,960
went out into the hallways.

4870
02:16:14,961 --> 02:16:15,111
It's,

4871
02:16:15,111 --> 02:16:16,090
everybody was gagging.

4872
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:18,720
We didn't have stink bombs.

4873
02:16:18,721 --> 02:16:23,721
But one time a girl threw up fruit roll
up next to me and I can still smell it.

4874
02:16:25,230 --> 02:16:28,110
It smells good fruit roll
ups for me for forever.

4875
02:16:28,670 --> 02:16:28,860
Yeah.

4876
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:29,880
I guess when you get a,

4877
02:16:29,890 --> 02:16:30,380
um,

4878
02:16:30,380 --> 02:16:31,870
when someone throws up around you,

4879
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:34,360
your immediate instinct is
to throw up because like,

4880
02:16:34,780 --> 02:16:38,560
it could be that it's food poisoning and
that you react to that you all ate the

4881
02:16:38,561 --> 02:16:41,470
same food and you realize that they're
getting sick and before your body can

4882
02:16:41,471 --> 02:16:42,190
digest it,

4883
02:16:42,190 --> 02:16:42,640
you just,

4884
02:16:42,640 --> 02:16:43,180
your body goes,

4885
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:43,331
oh,

4886
02:16:43,331 --> 02:16:44,164
this is bad food.

4887
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:45,490
So if you smell someone puking,

4888
02:16:45,491 --> 02:16:45,860
you just start

4889
02:16:45,860 --> 02:16:46,300
Puca.

4890
02:16:46,300 --> 02:16:46,800
Yeah,

4891
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:47,210
that's,

4892
02:16:47,210 --> 02:16:47,981
that's amazing.

4893
02:16:47,981 --> 02:16:49,000
I love that stuff,

4894
02:16:49,001 --> 02:16:49,890
that natural,

4895
02:16:49,891 --> 02:16:50,724
uh,

4896
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:51,700
like what's the one with,

4897
02:16:51,701 --> 02:16:52,240
um,

4898
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:55,030
like women and like if
you smell a woman and,

4899
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:56,260
and uh,

4900
02:16:56,650 --> 02:16:59,500
like there's like a stink that you like,

4901
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:04,480
then that means that
you're like far genetically

4902
02:17:04,740 --> 02:17:05,280
apart.

4903
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,240
Like a bad wiper.

4904
02:17:06,990 --> 02:17:07,690
Exactly.

4905
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:08,523
Fairmont.

4906
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:09,513
Fairmont.

4907
02:17:10,430 --> 02:17:13,410
What are you saying is that
you have different genes?

4908
02:17:13,411 --> 02:17:14,880
You're not related in any way,

4909
02:17:14,881 --> 02:17:16,140
so it makes them more attractive.

4910
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:16,680
Yes.

4911
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:18,330
So it'd be good to breed with that person.

4912
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:19,160
Right,

4913
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:19,860
right.

4914
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:20,790
Which is amazing,

4915
02:17:20,910 --> 02:17:21,840
but that throw up on,

4916
02:17:21,841 --> 02:17:22,531
that's a great one.

4917
02:17:22,531 --> 02:17:23,910
I've always wondered why that is,

4918
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:25,120
but I always wondered,

4919
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:25,950
you know,

4920
02:17:25,950 --> 02:17:30,290
whether or not certain levels of diversity
is attracting attractive to people at

4921
02:17:30,291 --> 02:17:31,170
sexual diversity.

4922
02:17:31,171 --> 02:17:34,320
Just because of like your
genetics want to mix things up.

4923
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:35,071
You know what I mean?

4924
02:17:35,071 --> 02:17:39,810
Like a lot of guys have Asian fetishes
or maybe Norwegian fetishes like blondes,

4925
02:17:39,811 --> 02:17:40,860
they're like big blondes.

4926
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:41,461
You know what I mean?

4927
02:17:41,461 --> 02:17:43,140
Like people get these [inaudible]
and like what is that?

4928
02:17:43,141 --> 02:17:43,351
It's like,

4929
02:17:43,351 --> 02:17:48,000
well you want to introduce those genes
into your genes and just like push that

4930
02:17:48,001 --> 02:17:49,050
new system out there.

4931
02:17:49,060 --> 02:17:52,890
That's the combination because if you
make close to your genes then yeah,

4932
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:54,750
it could end up to formed or whatever.

4933
02:17:55,020 --> 02:17:55,381
Yeah.

4934
02:17:55,381 --> 02:17:59,520
Like it's very rarely see like
an all blonde couple blonde guy,

4935
02:17:59,521 --> 02:18:00,360
blond girl.

4936
02:18:00,390 --> 02:18:01,800
Well nothing wrong with loving blondes,

4937
02:18:01,801 --> 02:18:02,790
but you have dark hair.

4938
02:18:02,791 --> 02:18:03,511
So it's kind of like,

4939
02:18:03,511 --> 02:18:04,260
makes sense,

4940
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:04,501
right?

4941
02:18:04,501 --> 02:18:07,590
Like so nineties like blondes mean girls.

4942
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:10,020
I just like bonds like one guys.

4943
02:18:10,980 --> 02:18:15,360
Do you ever go to the beach and
go a surfer trolling or something?

4944
02:18:17,610 --> 02:18:19,110
More dudes at Surf Blonde.

4945
02:18:19,170 --> 02:18:19,650
Okay,

4946
02:18:19,650 --> 02:18:20,280
there you go.

4947
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:21,920
Cause that's a fucking
stereotype right there.

4948
02:18:21,921 --> 02:18:24,660
That is a surfer dudes are kind of dopey.

4949
02:18:24,690 --> 02:18:25,800
You would assume they're blondes.

4950
02:18:25,860 --> 02:18:26,131
Hey,

4951
02:18:26,131 --> 02:18:26,790
what's up?

4952
02:18:26,790 --> 02:18:29,020
Didn't I see you on like a leeches?

4953
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:30,773
Is that what it is?

4954
02:18:31,410 --> 02:18:31,620
Yeah,

4955
02:18:31,620 --> 02:18:32,670
but you assume they're idiots.

4956
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:33,811
Yeah,

4957
02:18:33,811 --> 02:18:34,290
I do.

4958
02:18:34,290 --> 02:18:34,740
Yeah.

4959
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:34,961
Right.

4960
02:18:34,961 --> 02:18:36,170
And bleaches their brain to,

4961
02:18:36,171 --> 02:18:36,780
yeah,

4962
02:18:36,780 --> 02:18:38,940
like a guy with a nice blonde hair.

4963
02:18:38,941 --> 02:18:40,350
It will probably never be president.

4964
02:18:40,530 --> 02:18:42,150
What's his Fox News anchors?

4965
02:18:43,270 --> 02:18:44,570
You Know Sandy,

4966
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:45,450
it's gotta be saying,

4967
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:50,450
I wonder is there anything like did the
stereotype of dumb blondes is a very

4968
02:18:50,641 --> 02:18:51,720
common stereotype?

4969
02:18:52,170 --> 02:18:53,310
What is in that?

4970
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:54,653
What's that about?

4971
02:18:54,870 --> 02:18:59,870
Is that just that we men prefer blondes
so some bonds don't have to work as hard

4972
02:19:01,891 --> 02:19:02,880
because they're blonde.

4973
02:19:03,090 --> 02:19:08,090
Or is there some weird link between
having like light hair and lower

4974
02:19:08,251 --> 02:19:09,084
intelligence?

4975
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:10,560
I think it's a little bit of both.

4976
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:13,070
There must be some blonde geniuses though.

4977
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:14,213
Yeah,

4978
02:19:14,310 --> 02:19:15,660
I think it's a cultural thing.

4979
02:19:15,750 --> 02:19:16,380
I really,

4980
02:19:16,380 --> 02:19:16,671
I like,

4981
02:19:16,671 --> 02:19:16,851
yeah,

4982
02:19:16,851 --> 02:19:18,660
like surfer Dude Valley girl.

4983
02:19:18,690 --> 02:19:23,640
That's what I picture blonds like pop
culture went a little bit overboard and

4984
02:19:23,641 --> 02:19:24,740
that's what everyone thinks of now.

4985
02:19:24,750 --> 02:19:28,130
Look bonds more rich white women and
they're the ones that are at home

4986
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:30,530
like with handbags and like,

4987
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:31,730
I think that's what it,

4988
02:19:31,730 --> 02:19:32,690
that's where it came from.

4989
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:34,430
Rich white women in their fucking hands.

4990
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:35,270
Yeah.

4991
02:19:35,270 --> 02:19:36,920
Am I getting really racist at all?

4992
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:37,873
No,

4993
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:38,541
not at all.

4994
02:19:38,541 --> 02:19:41,000
The part where you said every
race looks alike was perfect.

4995
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:42,150
Yeah.

4996
02:19:42,150 --> 02:19:43,040
So except white people.

4997
02:19:43,620 --> 02:19:44,270
Right.

4998
02:19:44,270 --> 02:19:44,720
Um,

4999
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:45,200
but yeah,

5000
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:45,590
jelly,

5001
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:46,940
the blonde thing,

5002
02:19:46,941 --> 02:19:48,920
like at the playboy level,

5003
02:19:49,090 --> 02:19:51,800
like playboy playmates were
all blonde for a while.

5004
02:19:51,801 --> 02:19:54,620
Like that was the
stereotypical playboy playmate,

5005
02:19:54,621 --> 02:19:54,950
right.

5006
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:55,461
Blonde,

5007
02:19:55,461 --> 02:19:56,294
blue eyes.

5008
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:56,840
Right.

5009
02:19:56,840 --> 02:19:57,680
Like how'd that happen?

5010
02:19:57,681 --> 02:19:58,514
Like what,

5011
02:19:58,580 --> 02:19:59,300
what is the best

5012
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:00,490
Hugh Hefner just being,

5013
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:00,890
uh,

5014
02:20:00,890 --> 02:20:01,420
uh,

5015
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:02,620
a fetishist.

5016
02:20:02,650 --> 02:20:03,280
Yeah,

5017
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:04,060
exactly.

5018
02:20:04,060 --> 02:20:04,840
Like Mitzi,

5019
02:20:04,840 --> 02:20:09,460
they used to say that Mitzi hated blondes
because she was a Brunette and she was

5020
02:20:09,461 --> 02:20:10,810
the queen of the comedy store.

5021
02:20:10,811 --> 02:20:11,171
So like,

5022
02:20:11,171 --> 02:20:16,171
I guess it was like impossible for a
blonde girl that even not only not get

5023
02:20:16,661 --> 02:20:17,740
passed at the store,

5024
02:20:17,741 --> 02:20:20,690
but it was hard for them to get
waitressing jobs at the store.

5025
02:20:21,220 --> 02:20:21,781
I've missed,

5026
02:20:21,781 --> 02:20:25,960
he just had this horse and all the
cute little brunettes everywhere.

5027
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:26,913
But

5028
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:27,451
yeah.

5029
02:20:27,451 --> 02:20:27,991
Well Dude,

5030
02:20:27,991 --> 02:20:30,330
you know like people like Mitzi shore,

5031
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:32,220
like really like harsh,

5032
02:20:32,670 --> 02:20:34,800
like very eccentric people.

5033
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:39,960
Like one person like that in an
ecosystem can change the entire,

5034
02:20:39,961 --> 02:20:40,280
like,

5035
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:41,460
like with comedy,

5036
02:20:41,490 --> 02:20:45,390
one person like her change
comedy would be realistic.

5037
02:20:45,391 --> 02:20:49,560
Like that club and like her contributions
and her insistence on keeping it

5038
02:20:49,561 --> 02:20:50,100
crazy.

5039
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:50,860
Yeah.

5040
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:51,001
The,

5041
02:20:51,001 --> 02:20:52,290
all the madness that she would do.

5042
02:20:52,291 --> 02:20:54,540
She would take comics that don't like
each other and she put them back to back

5043
02:20:54,541 --> 02:20:54,931
with each other.

5044
02:20:54,931 --> 02:20:57,740
So they had to introduce
each other always.

5045
02:20:58,140 --> 02:20:58,430
Oh.

5046
02:20:58,430 --> 02:20:59,700
And all that shit that she did.

5047
02:20:59,701 --> 02:21:01,590
Like letting the comics run that place.

5048
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:02,160
Yeah,

5049
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:04,380
the loan it takes run the asylum,

5050
02:21:04,780 --> 02:21:05,430
you know,

5051
02:21:05,430 --> 02:21:05,850
she,

5052
02:21:05,850 --> 02:21:08,670
she created like this
whole like comedy movement.

5053
02:21:08,671 --> 02:21:09,504
If you think about all the,

5054
02:21:09,570 --> 02:21:13,080
the guys that came out of that
place Kennison and prior and like,

5055
02:21:13,081 --> 02:21:13,290
you know,

5056
02:21:13,290 --> 02:21:15,300
Letterman list goes on and on and on.

5057
02:21:15,301 --> 02:21:16,050
Man.

5058
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:17,430
A lot of it because that one lady,

5059
02:21:17,670 --> 02:21:17,910
no,

5060
02:21:17,910 --> 02:21:19,500
Wendy and in Denver,

5061
02:21:19,620 --> 02:21:20,281
where are you going to be?

5062
02:21:20,281 --> 02:21:20,950
January,

5063
02:21:20,950 --> 02:21:22,530
but the January 2nd and third.

5064
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,251
Oh good Lord.

5065
02:21:23,251 --> 02:21:23,851
Ladies and gentlemen,

5066
02:21:23,851 --> 02:21:26,970
Tony Hinchcliffe comes to
Denver all weekend long.

5067
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:31,020
Golden Pony triumphantly rides into town
during the fucking part of the winter.

5068
02:21:31,060 --> 02:21:31,300
God,

5069
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:32,133
Lord,

5070
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:32,770
that'd be cool.

5071
02:21:32,770 --> 02:21:33,040
Little bit.

5072
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:33,310
Tony,

5073
02:21:33,310 --> 02:21:34,143
warm your heart.

5074
02:21:35,130 --> 02:21:36,930
That's the pony riding into Denver.

5075
02:21:36,990 --> 02:21:37,860
That's the thing about Denver.

5076
02:21:37,861 --> 02:21:38,694
Even when it's cold,

5077
02:21:38,790 --> 02:21:39,623
it's sunny out.

5078
02:21:39,690 --> 02:21:40,620
It's not even depressing.

5079
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:41,161
It's just cold.

5080
02:21:41,161 --> 02:21:41,380
Yeah.

5081
02:21:41,380 --> 02:21:41,790
When they went,

5082
02:21:41,790 --> 02:21:42,730
I was there with you.

5083
02:21:42,731 --> 02:21:43,140
Uh,

5084
02:21:43,140 --> 02:21:44,140
and when you did your taping,

5085
02:21:44,141 --> 02:21:46,600
there was some amazing fun
facts on the wall like that.

5086
02:21:46,601 --> 02:21:49,700
It has more sunny days than
San Diego and stuff like that.

5087
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:50,501
That dude,

5088
02:21:50,501 --> 02:21:50,630
it's,

5089
02:21:50,630 --> 02:21:50,820
it's,

5090
02:21:50,820 --> 02:21:51,221
it's sunny.

5091
02:21:51,221 --> 02:21:51,700
It's fuck.

5092
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:52,060
Yeah.

5093
02:21:52,060 --> 02:21:53,650
It's one of the coolest
cities on the planet earth.

5094
02:21:53,950 --> 02:21:54,341
Denver.

5095
02:21:54,341 --> 02:21:55,180
Absolutely.

5096
02:21:55,210 --> 02:21:56,590
One of the best spots ever,

5097
02:21:56,710 --> 02:21:58,990
and now with the weed and fusion,

5098
02:21:59,110 --> 02:22:00,610
that place is out of town.

5099
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:01,810
They're just going crazy.

5100
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:02,290
Yeah,

5101
02:22:02,290 --> 02:22:02,591
there's,

5102
02:22:02,591 --> 02:22:04,570
apparently they passed it.

5103
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:08,080
They pass legal weed in Washington DC.

5104
02:22:08,110 --> 02:22:09,100
I don't know what you've seen that,

5105
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:11,680
but there's some new

5106
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:15,880
challenge to it by this,

5107
02:22:15,881 --> 02:22:20,881
a local politician who's being paid off
a congressman who's being paid off by

5108
02:22:21,851 --> 02:22:23,050
pharmaceutical companies.

5109
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:26,580
This guy named Harris from Maryland.

5110
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:31,080
He just led the charge to overturn the
will of Washington DC voters by inserting

5111
02:22:31,081 --> 02:22:33,240
language into Congress,

5112
02:22:33,241 --> 02:22:37,080
spending bill that prevents a district
from implementing the referendum.

5113
02:22:37,081 --> 02:22:41,610
They passed to legalize recreational
marijuana and the 2014 midterm election,

5114
02:22:41,910 --> 02:22:42,750
the referendum,

5115
02:22:42,751 --> 02:22:43,231
by the way,

5116
02:22:43,231 --> 02:22:46,740
passed with 70% of the
vote on election day.

5117
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:49,020
So this hunt,

5118
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:54,920
he introduced language into
a bill sneakily stopping
this from passing when 70%

5119
02:22:55,891 --> 02:22:56,970
of the population want it.

5120
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:58,590
And when they asked him about it,

5121
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:04,190
he said that relaxing marijuana laws
clearly leads to more teenage drug use,

5122
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:07,080
which is just a lie.

5123
02:23:07,290 --> 02:23:08,400
That's just not true.

5124
02:23:08,670 --> 02:23:09,503
It's just not true.

5125
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:11,071
According to Gallup,

5126
02:23:11,071 --> 02:23:13,530
polls obviously pulls her full shit,

5127
02:23:13,890 --> 02:23:16,140
but marijuana use amongst 18 to 20 wine,

5128
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:21,260
nine year olds has fallen 20% since
1985 so even though we'd is way more

5129
02:23:22,141 --> 02:23:23,370
accessible than ever before,

5130
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:26,430
it's continued to drop
because it's not a sneaky now.

5131
02:23:26,490 --> 02:23:28,440
Exactly.

5132
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:29,280
Yeah.

5133
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:31,770
It's not as thrilling because
it's like everyone's smoking.

5134
02:23:33,060 --> 02:23:33,181
Yeah.

5135
02:23:33,181 --> 02:23:34,860
We all know that effect.

5136
02:23:34,980 --> 02:23:36,630
People don't like people
telling them what to do.

5137
02:23:36,990 --> 02:23:37,823
Exactly.

5138
02:23:37,950 --> 02:23:38,783
You know,

5139
02:23:38,970 --> 02:23:39,900
tell your kids what to do.

5140
02:23:39,901 --> 02:23:40,734
They're going to rebel.

5141
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:41,881
The cops.

5142
02:23:41,881 --> 02:23:44,550
Kids always want to being criminals
are doing something fucking crazy.

5143
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:49,440
I dated a girl in high school
that was went to Catholic school.

5144
02:23:50,310 --> 02:23:50,700
Yeah.

5145
02:23:50,700 --> 02:23:51,600
Oh you dirty girl.

5146
02:23:51,630 --> 02:23:52,920
I wouldn't shut it.

5147
02:23:53,410 --> 02:23:54,330
Only want to hear anymore.

5148
02:23:54,390 --> 02:23:55,850
I went to Catholic school too.

5149
02:23:56,580 --> 02:23:57,080
Did you?

5150
02:23:57,080 --> 02:23:57,220
Yeah,

5151
02:23:57,220 --> 02:23:58,050
the girls.

5152
02:23:58,050 --> 02:23:58,883
It's really,

5153
02:23:59,250 --> 02:24:02,760
I'd imagine regular
here moving a all girls.

5154
02:24:02,761 --> 02:24:03,594
No,

5155
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:06,120
it's tough though man.

5156
02:24:06,330 --> 02:24:11,330
I'm telling Ya because that's hard to go
to school with girls wearing skirts and

5157
02:24:11,521 --> 02:24:16,521
the girls were all super cute and they'd
roll their skirts up and I remember,

5158
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:17,940
Hey I,

5159
02:24:18,450 --> 02:24:21,420
I had a boner like eight
hours a day going to school.

5160
02:24:22,230 --> 02:24:24,780
You'd have to try to like
settle it down before the,

5161
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:27,690
before class would end just
because you had to walk,

5162
02:24:27,910 --> 02:24:28,800
it was a big school,

5163
02:24:28,801 --> 02:24:32,910
three floors and you'd have to take the
stairs so you couldn't have the boner in

5164
02:24:32,911 --> 02:24:33,750
between classes.

5165
02:24:33,751 --> 02:24:37,890
So you'd have to like focus on other
things like your school work for the last

5166
02:24:37,890 --> 02:24:39,090
couple of minutes to get the bone or away.

5167
02:24:39,300 --> 02:24:43,050
Those 1617 year old boners are so
different to oh they have just throbbing,

5168
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:48,330
throbbing and they're re
relatively recent in your life.

5169
02:24:48,331 --> 02:24:49,830
So they're incredibly confusing.

5170
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:54,090
Like if you're 30 and you've been
getting boners since you were 15 that's

5171
02:24:54,570 --> 02:24:55,320
normal.

5172
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:55,920
It seems like,

5173
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:57,120
oh well here's a boner again,

5174
02:24:57,150 --> 02:24:58,260
I know how to deal with this.

5175
02:24:58,530 --> 02:24:59,550
But when you're 15 you're like,

5176
02:24:59,580 --> 02:24:59,881
oh,

5177
02:24:59,881 --> 02:25:01,290
I don't know what to do.

5178
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:03,210
You're so confused.

5179
02:25:03,211 --> 02:25:08,211
Like the power it has over your system
is you are dealing with millions of years

5180
02:25:09,031 --> 02:25:13,030
of DNA that's telling you to breed and
you're trying to find someone to do this

5181
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:13,873
with.

5182
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:17,760
It's all going on be internally
like behind the scenes,

5183
02:25:17,761 --> 02:25:22,761
but socially and culturally you're
your face with repression and

5184
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:29,100
slut shaming and worry and fear
of pregnancy and fear of disease.

5185
02:25:30,761 --> 02:25:35,500
And there's all this shit going on that
confuses this like natural weird thing

5186
02:25:35,501 --> 02:25:36,550
that your body is going through.

5187
02:25:36,551 --> 02:25:40,930
Your body just wants to fuck you know
when you're 16 that I remember that being

5188
02:25:40,931 --> 02:25:42,220
so confusing,

5189
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:47,350
like relatively like having a relatively
good control over my life until I

5190
02:25:47,351 --> 02:25:48,250
started getting boners.

5191
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:49,383
And then you know,

5192
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:50,321
you wind up be like,

5193
02:25:50,321 --> 02:25:51,400
what the fuck?

5194
02:25:51,401 --> 02:25:52,390
Like who am I?

5195
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:57,480
But I remember specifically is how much
more powerful the Boehner was that like

5196
02:25:58,930 --> 02:26:00,730
not only does a throb but it also,

5197
02:26:00,731 --> 02:26:02,050
I don't know if this
happened with you guys,

5198
02:26:02,051 --> 02:26:04,480
but mine would stick
just like straight up.

5199
02:26:04,600 --> 02:26:06,370
It's not like it is now where like if it,

5200
02:26:06,371 --> 02:26:09,160
if it happens then it's just a boner.

5201
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:14,320
But it would be like star pointed more
northward like a fucking compass or

5202
02:26:14,321 --> 02:26:14,741
something.

5203
02:26:14,741 --> 02:26:16,240
You can go back there with a boner pills.

5204
02:26:16,290 --> 02:26:19,660
Well and were confused at why teachers
are having sex with 17 year old boys.

5205
02:26:19,661 --> 02:26:21,100
They have throbbing dicks.

5206
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:23,463
Oh my God.

5207
02:26:24,310 --> 02:26:27,280
Well I mean someone's sounds
like they want to fuck some kids.

5208
02:26:29,430 --> 02:26:29,650
No.

5209
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:30,101
Yeah,

5210
02:26:30,101 --> 02:26:30,850
I get it.

5211
02:26:30,850 --> 02:26:31,091
Yeah.

5212
02:26:31,091 --> 02:26:35,050
If you or your husband is like barely
hard and there's some 16 year old kid,

5213
02:26:35,051 --> 02:26:40,051
it's just rock cars flash
putting his leg to this side.

5214
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:40,630
Yeah.

5215
02:26:40,630 --> 02:26:44,050
You're seeing the outline
of it in his pants.

5216
02:26:44,350 --> 02:26:48,060
He has to talk to you about football
practice and I just get so confused during

5217
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:49,860
football practice and it's a waste line.

5218
02:26:49,861 --> 02:26:52,960
A lot of time something happens in my
legs get numb and that's where you have to

5219
02:26:52,961 --> 02:26:53,291
hide it.

5220
02:26:53,291 --> 02:26:54,400
You have to hide it up top.

5221
02:26:54,401 --> 02:26:56,260
You can't go any other
direction with that.

5222
02:26:56,261 --> 02:26:59,500
You have to go along the belt and
like pull your shirt out a little bit.

5223
02:26:59,501 --> 02:27:02,310
Untuck the shirt or you got
to get into sweatshirts.

5224
02:27:02,490 --> 02:27:02,750
Right.

5225
02:27:02,750 --> 02:27:03,311
Long ones,

5226
02:27:03,311 --> 02:27:04,570
they're a little bit too long for you.

5227
02:27:05,110 --> 02:27:05,711
They'd go down,

5228
02:27:05,711 --> 02:27:06,400
they'd cover,

5229
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:09,970
cover your package and then you have
to carry your books in front of it all.

5230
02:27:10,570 --> 02:27:10,781
Yeah,

5231
02:27:10,781 --> 02:27:11,770
regulating kids.

5232
02:27:11,771 --> 02:27:15,190
Having sex is one of the most ridiculous
things ever are trying in any way to

5233
02:27:15,191 --> 02:27:16,750
regulate kids or it's stopped them.

5234
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:17,800
Then when they're trying to pull that,

5235
02:27:17,801 --> 02:27:20,230
push that abstinence like that's the best.

5236
02:27:20,231 --> 02:27:23,380
Abstinence is the best way to
deal with sex with children.

5237
02:27:23,650 --> 02:27:25,330
Just keep them from having sex.

5238
02:27:25,331 --> 02:27:26,164
Abstain,

5239
02:27:26,410 --> 02:27:27,243
abstain,

5240
02:27:27,970 --> 02:27:28,803
abstain.

5241
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:31,060
It's like saying don't
eat to hungry people.

5242
02:27:31,061 --> 02:27:33,830
It's like getting hungry people and
putting in a room full of food and saying,

5243
02:27:33,831 --> 02:27:34,420
don't eat.

5244
02:27:34,420 --> 02:27:35,620
That's how babies are made.

5245
02:27:35,740 --> 02:27:36,510
Yes,

5246
02:27:36,510 --> 02:27:37,343
yes.

5247
02:27:37,730 --> 02:27:38,300
Yeah.

5248
02:27:38,300 --> 02:27:39,460
But not telling them like,

5249
02:27:39,461 --> 02:27:39,680
look,

5250
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:39,960
you know,

5251
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:41,980
wear a condom or get on the pill.

5252
02:27:42,070 --> 02:27:43,360
Like something needs to happen here.

5253
02:27:43,361 --> 02:27:45,340
You guys can't just be
shooting loads of each other.

5254
02:27:45,341 --> 02:27:47,290
You're 15 can't make kids.

5255
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:47,741
You know,

5256
02:27:47,741 --> 02:27:51,190
you could if we were living 10,000 years
ago and nobody had invented schools

5257
02:27:51,191 --> 02:27:52,024
yet.

5258
02:27:52,060 --> 02:27:53,590
But that's the other thing about schools,

5259
02:27:53,591 --> 02:27:57,010
it's like we take kids and we take
them away from the people that they're

5260
02:27:57,011 --> 02:27:57,844
learning from,

5261
02:27:57,970 --> 02:28:02,970
which is adults and we stick them with
mostly other kids and a couple parents or

5262
02:28:03,460 --> 02:28:06,490
rather adults that barely
can control the room.

5263
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:09,310
So that becomes as Lord of
the flies type situation.

5264
02:28:09,311 --> 02:28:12,220
Like almost immediately when you get
more than 30 kids in a classroom.

5265
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:16,260
And most classrooms today
because of budget cuts like
fucking 40 people and shed

5266
02:28:16,270 --> 02:28:17,310
40 kids in the class.

5267
02:28:17,340 --> 02:28:18,173
One teacher,

5268
02:28:18,280 --> 02:28:20,380
good luck control and
those little animals,

5269
02:28:20,470 --> 02:28:21,291
good luck.

5270
02:28:21,291 --> 02:28:22,130
And then they just start

5271
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:22,941
fucking each other,

5272
02:28:22,941 --> 02:28:23,230
right?

5273
02:28:23,230 --> 02:28:24,061
A little while.

5274
02:28:24,061 --> 02:28:24,570
Monkeys,

5275
02:28:24,570 --> 02:28:25,403
Whoa,

5276
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:26,240
Whoa,

5277
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:26,721
stop them.

5278
02:28:26,721 --> 02:28:27,620
They're having parties.

5279
02:28:27,621 --> 02:28:28,840
Parents are going out of town.

5280
02:28:28,841 --> 02:28:30,740
It's fucking banging each
other and going nuts.

5281
02:28:31,580 --> 02:28:34,130
The band kids where the horniest band.

5282
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:34,791
God.

5283
02:28:34,791 --> 02:28:35,200
Yeah.

5284
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:36,620
Well you were so horny.

5285
02:28:36,621 --> 02:28:37,454
I don't know.

5286
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:39,430
They were all fucking
each other all the time.

5287
02:28:39,490 --> 02:28:39,790
Hi.

5288
02:28:39,790 --> 02:28:44,790
This sounds like the most awesome opening
to like a porn girls describing her.

5289
02:28:45,850 --> 02:28:47,250
It was always the band kid.

5290
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:50,890
She goes back to our memory.

5291
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:52,300
It's like a younger,

5292
02:28:52,301 --> 02:28:55,230
Kim was like a camp outfit on Tuba.

5293
02:28:55,900 --> 02:28:56,960
Where are you guys going?

5294
02:28:57,060 --> 02:28:59,380
Why are you going to hike
with all your instruments?

5295
02:28:59,890 --> 02:29:02,530
Where we're going to go
play over in this field?

5296
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:03,473
Do you want to come?

5297
02:29:03,590 --> 02:29:03,880
Yeah.

5298
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:05,410
You'd come over the top of the crest.

5299
02:29:05,411 --> 02:29:06,340
The hill and it's just dope.

5300
02:29:06,490 --> 02:29:07,600
Fucking orgy.

5301
02:29:08,050 --> 02:29:09,070
Just to buzz.

5302
02:29:09,071 --> 02:29:09,340
Yeah.

5303
02:29:09,340 --> 02:29:10,990
Gang brains and fucking,

5304
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:17,000
I like the thought of someone just having
a triangle that just came for the sex.

5305
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:18,190
Yeah.

5306
02:29:20,020 --> 02:29:22,310
Some do with fucking Morocco's.

5307
02:29:22,311 --> 02:29:23,144
Yeah,

5308
02:29:23,580 --> 02:29:24,413
right guys.

5309
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:26,960
So are we doing this or was,

5310
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:28,881
what are those things?

5311
02:29:28,881 --> 02:29:29,420
Stumbles.

5312
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:29,990
Not Assemble.

5313
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:30,440
What are those?

5314
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:32,630
The assemble tambourine.

5315
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:33,473
Tambourine.

5316
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:35,780
That's an asshole instrument.

5317
02:29:36,050 --> 02:29:37,490
If you choose a tambourine,

5318
02:29:37,491 --> 02:29:37,851
if you'd like,

5319
02:29:37,851 --> 02:29:39,200
I'd take a tambourine,

5320
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:39,591
well,

5321
02:29:39,591 --> 02:29:40,850
you just want to annoy people.

5322
02:29:40,880 --> 02:29:41,151
Right?

5323
02:29:41,151 --> 02:29:42,430
And they're like to marine.

5324
02:29:42,850 --> 02:29:45,560
It can make certain songs
have a little depth,

5325
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:47,000
but if that's all you got,

5326
02:29:47,001 --> 02:29:47,834
you're an asshole.

5327
02:29:47,870 --> 02:29:48,020
Yeah.

5328
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:50,930
I'll give you show up and you're like
doing a like on the side of the street

5329
02:29:50,931 --> 02:29:53,900
doing a street performer thing and
it's with a tambourine good luck bitch.

5330
02:29:53,901 --> 02:29:54,800
You're going to starve to death.

5331
02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:55,520
Yeah.

5332
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:56,810
Let me just give you money to annoy him.

5333
02:29:56,811 --> 02:29:57,291
What the fuck?

5334
02:29:57,291 --> 02:29:59,960
His stupid tamber Brody Stevens.

5335
02:30:00,470 --> 02:30:01,041
I love Brody.

5336
02:30:01,041 --> 02:30:03,580
He always has that tambourine
kick his fucking around.

5337
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:04,221
Brody Stevens.

5338
02:30:04,221 --> 02:30:04,971
You know what he does do though?

5339
02:30:04,971 --> 02:30:05,720
That's hilarious.

5340
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:07,430
He plays drums on chairs.

5341
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:08,540
If you ever seen Brody do that.

5342
02:30:08,570 --> 02:30:08,871
Oh yeah.

5343
02:30:08,871 --> 02:30:10,400
He's really good at the drums,

5344
02:30:10,460 --> 02:30:14,030
so bust out chairs for drums
and just start playing.

5345
02:30:14,031 --> 02:30:14,391
I'm like,

5346
02:30:14,391 --> 02:30:17,270
he's playing drums and
go off like it's real.

5347
02:30:17,310 --> 02:30:18,440
Did it do?

5348
02:30:19,650 --> 02:30:20,483
Yeah.

5349
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:23,720
That's one of those late night old school,

5350
02:30:23,721 --> 02:30:25,660
original room comedy
store set type things.

5351
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:25,931
You know,

5352
02:30:25,931 --> 02:30:29,330
you see him doing that takes great pride
in inventing the art of chair drumming.

5353
02:30:29,690 --> 02:30:30,523
Yeah.

5354
02:30:30,650 --> 02:30:31,483
Brody Stevens,

5355
02:30:31,610 --> 02:30:32,680
another one at the commissary.

5356
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:34,520
Is there anybody that
does the tambourine well,

5357
02:30:34,670 --> 02:30:37,230
I guess they're like the lost
art of the tambourine fought.

5358
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:38,930
See if you can find awesome

5359
02:30:39,290 --> 02:30:40,250
Maureen performance.

5360
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:41,970
Not Try that way.

5361
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:43,063
You never know.

5362
02:30:43,220 --> 02:30:44,750
Somebody might know how to rock it,

5363
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:45,490
right?

5364
02:30:45,490 --> 02:30:46,323
Yes.

5365
02:30:46,420 --> 02:30:47,253
Somebody's mind.

5366
02:30:47,330 --> 02:30:47,631
Yeah.

5367
02:30:47,631 --> 02:30:48,710
I've thought that before.

5368
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:50,260
I remember putting a tweets.

5369
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:53,150
Has Anyone ever really mastered
the tambourine this thing?

5370
02:30:53,151 --> 02:30:54,110
You're just thinking about it.

5371
02:30:54,590 --> 02:30:55,460
How would you know?

5372
02:30:55,730 --> 02:30:56,563
How would you know?

5373
02:30:57,160 --> 02:30:58,040
We'd have to go look,

5374
02:30:58,460 --> 02:30:59,293
right?

5375
02:30:59,810 --> 02:31:00,170
Yeah.

5376
02:31:00,170 --> 02:31:02,990
Do you remember like school plays when
they did the musicals and they gave all

5377
02:31:02,991 --> 02:31:03,591
the shitty kids?

5378
02:31:03,591 --> 02:31:05,300
That one little thing,

5379
02:31:05,390 --> 02:31:05,960
thing,

5380
02:31:05,960 --> 02:31:06,590
thing,

5381
02:31:06,590 --> 02:31:07,423
xylophone.

5382
02:31:08,710 --> 02:31:11,060
They gave the shitty kids that
couldn't play in the musical.

5383
02:31:11,061 --> 02:31:11,301
They're like,

5384
02:31:11,301 --> 02:31:12,590
you just tap this one.

5385
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:16,930
You know what's really funny when you're
like for that thing is to shit dope as

5386
02:31:16,931 --> 02:31:17,231
fuck.

5387
02:31:17,231 --> 02:31:18,970
All kids gravitate towards that.

5388
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:22,170
It's a trap because there's not a
lot of longevity in the xylophone.

5389
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:23,340
Like you start,

5390
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:24,300
you start out thinking,

5391
02:31:24,301 --> 02:31:24,511
yeah,

5392
02:31:24,511 --> 02:31:25,680
I'm a fucking head of the curve.

5393
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:26,071
Yeah,

5394
02:31:26,071 --> 02:31:27,600
but you got to know when to bail on the,

5395
02:31:28,170 --> 02:31:29,190
that's just bongos,

5396
02:31:29,191 --> 02:31:29,430
dude.

5397
02:31:29,430 --> 02:31:31,380
That's the tambourine in between his legs.

5398
02:31:31,440 --> 02:31:31,621
Oh,

5399
02:31:31,621 --> 02:31:32,221
no way.

5400
02:31:32,221 --> 02:31:33,030
Yeah,

5401
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:33,860
he made it an art.

5402
02:31:33,860 --> 02:31:35,130
Oh his hair's

5403
02:31:37,830 --> 02:31:40,720
so that's the guy that was huffing.

5404
02:31:41,770 --> 02:31:42,410
Uh,

5405
02:31:42,410 --> 02:31:43,970
he's actually playing the drums though.

5406
02:31:44,420 --> 02:31:44,991
I don't understand.

5407
02:31:44,991 --> 02:31:47,030
That's the tambourine is
making the drum sound as well,

5408
02:31:47,031 --> 02:31:47,480
right?

5409
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:48,313
Yeah.

5410
02:31:48,430 --> 02:31:48,620
Yeah.

5411
02:31:48,620 --> 02:31:49,970
I'm counting on the top of the temporary.

5412
02:31:50,330 --> 02:31:51,163
Pretty okay.

5413
02:31:51,170 --> 02:31:52,910
I have to take it back
cause that's pretty dope.

5414
02:31:54,620 --> 02:31:55,453
You don't like it.

5415
02:31:55,640 --> 02:31:56,810
Does that count as playing?

5416
02:31:56,811 --> 02:31:57,860
Just the tambourine?

5417
02:31:57,990 --> 02:31:58,823
Yeah,

5418
02:31:59,180 --> 02:32:01,880
he's using the tambourine
but not play itself.

5419
02:32:02,210 --> 02:32:02,400
No,

5420
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:02,960
that is,

5421
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:04,190
that's the tambourine tambourine.

5422
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:08,090
He has an in between his legs instead
of holding it like you normally see it.

5423
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:09,350
I could see like a wild,

5424
02:32:09,740 --> 02:32:11,090
crazy eccentric man.

5425
02:32:11,150 --> 02:32:11,571
It has.

5426
02:32:11,571 --> 02:32:15,890
Is his bedroom done up like a
jungle at any brings you in and lazy

5427
02:32:15,980 --> 02:32:20,480
John on a Hammock and then he puts this
this CD on and it's all just this guy

5428
02:32:20,481 --> 02:32:22,640
playing jungle tambourine
music and the guy comes down,

5429
02:32:22,641 --> 02:32:24,740
we'll look fucking feathers
around his wrist and shit.

5430
02:32:25,370 --> 02:32:26,370
Some wild boar.

5431
02:32:26,371 --> 02:32:27,320
Your head dress on.

5432
02:32:31,290 --> 02:32:32,690
He fucks this kind of music.

5433
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:33,290
Yeah.

5434
02:32:33,290 --> 02:32:34,123
You couldn't see this.

5435
02:32:34,130 --> 02:32:34,281
Oh,

5436
02:32:34,281 --> 02:32:35,600
I can totally picture that.

5437
02:32:35,630 --> 02:32:36,710
I could see you doing that Tony.

5438
02:32:36,800 --> 02:32:37,071
Well,

5439
02:32:37,071 --> 02:32:37,371
you know,

5440
02:32:37,371 --> 02:32:38,420
I've been known the bus stop.

5441
02:32:38,421 --> 02:32:39,254
A tambourine for sure.

5442
02:32:39,290 --> 02:32:40,190
Time to time.

5443
02:32:40,250 --> 02:32:41,420
I don't see playing it.

5444
02:32:41,450 --> 02:32:44,360
I see you putting that music on the
background showing up with like face paint

5445
02:32:44,361 --> 02:32:45,970
on this war path.

5446
02:32:46,460 --> 02:32:46,850
Whoa.

5447
02:32:46,850 --> 02:32:47,031
Yeah.

5448
02:32:47,031 --> 02:32:49,400
This is actually seen from
less the chick from bedrooms,

5449
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:51,681
right?

5450
02:32:51,681 --> 02:32:52,820
That's Mama from good times,

5451
02:32:52,821 --> 02:32:53,390
Huh?

5452
02:32:53,390 --> 02:32:55,430
If church was like that long ago,

5453
02:32:56,250 --> 02:32:56,540
Trish,

5454
02:32:56,540 --> 02:32:58,810
for black people's way better
than church for white people,

5455
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:01,010
Gary Owens is a whole bit about it.

5456
02:33:01,130 --> 02:33:01,963
They turn up,

5457
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:03,530
turn up,

5458
02:33:03,530 --> 02:33:04,281
turn up,

5459
02:33:04,281 --> 02:33:08,090
turn up for what they turn up or turn
down for water and I'm for Jesus her down

5460
02:33:08,091 --> 02:33:08,924
for what?

5461
02:33:08,990 --> 02:33:10,610
You see that video turn down for what?

5462
02:33:10,870 --> 02:33:11,990
A fucking little John Video.

5463
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:14,960
It's the greatest music video
in the history of the world.

5464
02:33:15,110 --> 02:33:16,160
Brian counts sent it to me.

5465
02:33:16,161 --> 02:33:16,371
He goes,

5466
02:33:16,371 --> 02:33:17,930
this is the greatest thing
you'll ever watch your life.

5467
02:33:18,320 --> 02:33:18,741
And I was like,

5468
02:33:18,741 --> 02:33:21,020
are you really making me
watch a little John Video?

5469
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:22,550
And then halfway into it I realized,

5470
02:33:22,580 --> 02:33:22,941
oh my God,

5471
02:33:22,941 --> 02:33:24,380
it's the greatest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

5472
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:25,970
Turn down for what?

5473
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:26,833
He's great.

5474
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:28,220
It's a wild motherfucker.

5475
02:33:28,460 --> 02:33:29,920
New Mountain Dew Dorito flavor.

5476
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:31,750
That's the students to do.

5477
02:33:31,810 --> 02:33:32,643
We

5478
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:37,580
see a guy like a little
John is a perfect example.

5479
02:33:37,581 --> 02:33:41,210
Why everybody shouldn't like take
a standard path through life.

5480
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:41,721
You know,

5481
02:33:41,721 --> 02:33:42,381
high school,

5482
02:33:42,381 --> 02:33:43,161
College,

5483
02:33:43,161 --> 02:33:43,950
get your shit together.

5484
02:33:43,950 --> 02:33:44,930
Four O one k plan.

5485
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:45,151
No,

5486
02:33:45,151 --> 02:33:45,241
no,

5487
02:33:45,241 --> 02:33:45,381
no,

5488
02:33:45,381 --> 02:33:45,501
no,

5489
02:33:45,501 --> 02:33:45,591
no,

5490
02:33:45,591 --> 02:33:45,741
no,

5491
02:33:45,741 --> 02:33:46,130
no.

5492
02:33:46,130 --> 02:33:49,610
You d like in order for a dude to have
diamonds all over his teeth and be some

5493
02:33:49,611 --> 02:33:50,444
crazy motherfucker,

5494
02:33:50,490 --> 02:33:52,100
you need to have an eccentric childhood.

5495
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:52,371
You know,

5496
02:33:52,371 --> 02:33:53,350
you need to have a,

5497
02:33:53,570 --> 02:33:53,830
uh,

5498
02:33:53,830 --> 02:33:56,120
a very unusual path and upbringing.

5499
02:33:56,230 --> 02:33:56,690
You know,

5500
02:33:56,690 --> 02:33:58,440
you don't just make a little John.

5501
02:33:58,970 --> 02:34:00,950
He is so cool in real life.

5502
02:34:01,100 --> 02:34:02,080
I hung out with him.

5503
02:34:02,081 --> 02:34:03,620
We had a crazy night in Nashville.

5504
02:34:03,621 --> 02:34:07,160
We both have a mutual friend who
flew us out for his birthday party,

5505
02:34:07,161 --> 02:34:10,700
like this blowout 50th birthday
party for John Rich big musician.

5506
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:11,870
And uh,

5507
02:34:11,870 --> 02:34:12,820
I roasted him.

5508
02:34:12,830 --> 02:34:13,910
He flew me,

5509
02:34:13,940 --> 02:34:16,760
Jeff Ross and Sarah Tiana to his 50th,

5510
02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:19,240
well his wife did to roast him.

5511
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:21,850
He has like a house of Blues in his house.

5512
02:34:21,851 --> 02:34:24,850
He has a big five story house
on a mountain in Nashville.

5513
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:25,870
John Rich Shit.

5514
02:34:26,170 --> 02:34:27,760
So and I roasted a,

5515
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:31,780
I roasted lulled John too cause he
was out in the audience but I had to,

5516
02:34:31,781 --> 02:34:32,081
you know,

5517
02:34:32,081 --> 02:34:33,310
I had to acknowledge them.

5518
02:34:33,430 --> 02:34:33,731
Right,

5519
02:34:33,731 --> 02:34:33,971
right,

5520
02:34:33,971 --> 02:34:34,390
right.

5521
02:34:34,390 --> 02:34:35,223
And uh,

5522
02:34:35,270 --> 02:34:35,831
did you have a song?

5523
02:34:35,831 --> 02:34:36,940
What else is on when he's in the audience?

5524
02:34:36,941 --> 02:34:37,150
Yeah.

5525
02:34:37,150 --> 02:34:37,870
Oh yeah.

5526
02:34:37,870 --> 02:34:38,501
He had everything.

5527
02:34:38,501 --> 02:34:41,440
He had the whole look I go nowadays
when Lil Jon is yelling what?

5528
02:34:41,470 --> 02:34:43,720
It's because he's gotten old
and he couldn't hear you.

5529
02:34:44,090 --> 02:34:44,923
Huh?

5530
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:47,341
The sunglasses.

5531
02:34:47,341 --> 02:34:47,910
That's the,

5532
02:34:47,910 --> 02:34:49,980
if you were on $25,000 pyramid,

5533
02:34:49,981 --> 02:34:53,460
that would be under things only
black people can wear at night.

5534
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:54,353
Sunglasses.

5535
02:34:55,020 --> 02:34:55,291
You would,

5536
02:34:55,291 --> 02:34:56,460
that would be like one of the first ones.

5537
02:34:56,490 --> 02:34:57,540
Black people in Bondo.

5538
02:34:57,630 --> 02:34:58,080
That's it.

5539
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:58,690
You but Bondo.

5540
02:34:58,690 --> 02:35:01,350
I had to say that he had glaucoma
cause people are like what the fuck?

5541
02:35:01,380 --> 02:35:02,420
Bano yeah,

5542
02:35:02,540 --> 02:35:06,330
you're always wearing sunglasses but
black people can just get away with it.

5543
02:35:06,450 --> 02:35:08,820
And Floyd Mayweather
every interview he does,

5544
02:35:08,821 --> 02:35:09,750
he wear sunglasses,

5545
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:10,831
he gets interviewed,

5546
02:35:10,831 --> 02:35:11,730
does award shows,

5547
02:35:11,731 --> 02:35:12,570
wear sunglasses,

5548
02:35:12,571 --> 02:35:16,710
walks up to the deus with sunglasses
on and no one says anything.

5549
02:35:17,460 --> 02:35:18,840
If a white guy tried to do that,

5550
02:35:19,370 --> 02:35:20,250
can you imagine if like,

5551
02:35:20,550 --> 02:35:21,000
okay,

5552
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:24,690
like a famous white boxer like Vladimir
Klitschko heavyweight champion.

5553
02:35:24,900 --> 02:35:26,640
If he showed up with
sunglasses on and they're like,

5554
02:35:26,641 --> 02:35:29,100
that motherfucker isn't even
train and he went Hollywood.

5555
02:35:29,210 --> 02:35:29,370
Yeah.

5556
02:35:29,370 --> 02:35:30,060
Look at him.

5557
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:34,950
White guys wearing like sunglasses
indoors or at night shows a lack of

5558
02:35:34,951 --> 02:35:36,240
dedication to your craft.

5559
02:35:36,990 --> 02:35:37,350
Right?

5560
02:35:37,350 --> 02:35:39,290
It looks a lot douchey
or when white guys do it,

5561
02:35:39,330 --> 02:35:39,940
I think,

5562
02:35:39,940 --> 02:35:43,620
why is that what it feels like
the right like rock and roll vibe.

5563
02:35:43,860 --> 02:35:47,670
Then maybe you could work Elvis keeping
it around David Lee Roth can do whatever

5564
02:35:47,671 --> 02:35:49,380
the fuck he wants to
tell you that right now.

5565
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:50,700
Like a rock and roll vibe.

5566
02:35:50,730 --> 02:35:53,730
It works the way I call it David.

5567
02:35:53,731 --> 02:35:56,700
The Rock can do whatever the fucking
lost Schaefer with Joe Perry when we had

5568
02:35:56,701 --> 02:36:00,210
Joe Perry and Joe Perry could do whatever
the fuck you want slash slash can do

5569
02:36:00,211 --> 02:36:01,170
whatever the fuck he wants.

5570
02:36:01,410 --> 02:36:02,430
Axl rose though.

5571
02:36:02,790 --> 02:36:04,290
If he's wearing sunglasses,

5572
02:36:04,320 --> 02:36:04,670
you're like,

5573
02:36:04,670 --> 02:36:05,670
you're high bitch.

5574
02:36:05,880 --> 02:36:07,680
Me John was,

5575
02:36:07,681 --> 02:36:09,780
that was Paul Paul Shaffer.

5576
02:36:10,050 --> 02:36:11,610
He could basically do
whatever the fuck he wants.

5577
02:36:11,650 --> 02:36:11,970
Yeah,

5578
02:36:11,970 --> 02:36:12,803
he's eccentric.

5579
02:36:13,230 --> 02:36:14,063
He's allowed to.

5580
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:17,850
Elton John told him he
used to wear those glasses.

5581
02:36:17,870 --> 02:36:18,900
Can do anything.

5582
02:36:18,901 --> 02:36:20,130
That's the one exception.

5583
02:36:20,370 --> 02:36:21,510
Every fucking roll.

5584
02:36:21,511 --> 02:36:21,840
Huh?

5585
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:22,800
You could wear a wig,

5586
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:24,780
put on crazy glasses.

5587
02:36:24,781 --> 02:36:26,550
He can fucking wear silly hats.

5588
02:36:26,610 --> 02:36:28,380
You can do anything you
want to Rod Stewart,

5589
02:36:28,381 --> 02:36:29,214
wear glasses.

5590
02:36:29,250 --> 02:36:31,110
He could do whatever the fuck he wants.

5591
02:36:31,410 --> 02:36:32,340
He wrote Maggie Mae.

5592
02:36:32,540 --> 02:36:36,300
This is like if you get one wake
up Maggie song in your life,

5593
02:36:36,330 --> 02:36:39,720
you know that song just knocked
it out of the fucking park.

5594
02:36:39,721 --> 02:36:39,931
He's,

5595
02:36:39,931 --> 02:36:40,950
he's done for life.

5596
02:36:40,980 --> 02:36:42,030
He's always rod Stewart.

5597
02:36:42,090 --> 02:36:42,270
Yeah.

5598
02:36:42,270 --> 02:36:43,590
No matter where he goes
to the rest of his life.

5599
02:36:43,591 --> 02:36:44,830
That's Rod motherfucker store.

5600
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:47,310
Me Too.

5601
02:36:47,310 --> 02:36:49,770
When I was 15 and I didn't appreciate it.

5602
02:36:49,771 --> 02:36:50,670
So we left early.

5603
02:36:50,730 --> 02:36:52,550
Oh No.

5604
02:36:53,830 --> 02:36:54,181
Yeah.

5605
02:36:54,181 --> 02:36:56,400
We didn't even wear like
this fucking is weird.

5606
02:36:56,650 --> 02:36:57,600
He's wearing weird pants.

5607
02:36:57,601 --> 02:36:58,290
Let's get outta here.

5608
02:36:58,290 --> 02:36:58,771
You definitely,

5609
02:36:58,771 --> 02:36:59,604
where were pants?

5610
02:36:59,630 --> 02:37:00,030
Yeah.

5611
02:37:00,030 --> 02:37:02,700
And it was just like all these older
people like dancing in the front and we're

5612
02:37:02,701 --> 02:37:02,851
like,

5613
02:37:02,851 --> 02:37:04,110
he's moody,

5614
02:37:04,111 --> 02:37:06,960
like angry teenagers that
their bangs to the side.

5615
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:07,833
Oh

5616
02:37:08,250 --> 02:37:09,870
that song is so God damn good.

5617
02:37:09,871 --> 02:37:11,540
He's got a bunch of songs that are so gap.

5618
02:37:11,570 --> 02:37:12,403
God damn good.

5619
02:37:12,480 --> 02:37:14,910
But then he went like disco later.

5620
02:37:14,970 --> 02:37:15,160
Yeah,

5621
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:15,710
you got it.

5622
02:37:15,710 --> 02:37:17,210
Like that disco phase.

5623
02:37:17,350 --> 02:37:20,270
You know the early shit is
like my favorite shit of his,

5624
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:22,010
but then he got like,

5625
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:23,530
he got that sexy song.

5626
02:37:23,570 --> 02:37:23,880
Yeah.

5627
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:27,420
Few bought my body started
looking like a bird.

5628
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:32,090
It just wasn't the same shit.

5629
02:37:32,390 --> 02:37:32,691
You know,

5630
02:37:32,691 --> 02:37:33,770
it's like that was like,

5631
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:38,840
it was more of a lego lower
frequency than the old,

5632
02:37:38,841 --> 02:37:42,350
like Maggie Mae's like this
deep rich storytelling song.

5633
02:37:42,730 --> 02:37:46,160
And we know when that song resets three
fourths of the way through and that

5634
02:37:46,161 --> 02:37:47,780
mandolin comes through.

5635
02:37:48,490 --> 02:37:49,700
If you don't get the chills,

5636
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:50,630
kill yourself.

5637
02:37:50,950 --> 02:37:53,630
I like a song about a chick
fucking up a dude's life too.

5638
02:37:53,960 --> 02:37:54,680
I liked that.

5639
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:55,790
I like hearing those songs.

5640
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:56,833
I support that.

5641
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:57,713
Yeah.

5642
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:01,520
Do you girls find it's hard
to date guys cause they wear,

5643
02:38:01,521 --> 02:38:02,390
you put them in their act,

5644
02:38:02,420 --> 02:38:03,253
your act or other,

5645
02:38:03,790 --> 02:38:04,031
no,

5646
02:38:04,031 --> 02:38:07,330
they're just not as funny to me because
guys try to impress girls by being

5647
02:38:07,331 --> 02:38:07,661
funny.

5648
02:38:07,661 --> 02:38:08,380
Right.

5649
02:38:08,380 --> 02:38:12,160
And I'm constantly around the
funniest and so I'm just like,

5650
02:38:12,190 --> 02:38:12,461
Ooh,

5651
02:38:12,461 --> 02:38:13,360
this is terrible.

5652
02:38:14,020 --> 02:38:14,591
It's off,

5653
02:38:14,591 --> 02:38:15,010
right?

5654
02:38:15,010 --> 02:38:15,670
Yeah.

5655
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:16,780
It's weird situation.

5656
02:38:16,781 --> 02:38:17,830
Cause then it sometimes I'm like,

5657
02:38:17,860 --> 02:38:18,071
oh,

5658
02:38:18,071 --> 02:38:20,800
maybe I should just wait like a
bank teller and then I'm like,

5659
02:38:20,830 --> 02:38:21,011
oh,

5660
02:38:21,011 --> 02:38:22,420
this is so boring and lame.

5661
02:38:22,421 --> 02:38:22,991
And then you know,

5662
02:38:22,991 --> 02:38:24,490
you don't want to date
someone that's always busy.

5663
02:38:24,491 --> 02:38:26,220
Like you said,

5664
02:38:26,230 --> 02:38:27,610
it's like date yourself,

5665
02:38:28,420 --> 02:38:28,841
wasn't it?

5666
02:38:28,841 --> 02:38:30,220
There's also the weird thing about,

5667
02:38:30,221 --> 02:38:30,910
um,

5668
02:38:30,910 --> 02:38:33,400
comedians is that you guys go on stage.

5669
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:33,880
I mean,

5670
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:35,680
we all go on stage like
pretty much every night.

5671
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:37,390
So every night like you like,

5672
02:38:37,470 --> 02:38:37,721
you know,

5673
02:38:37,721 --> 02:38:38,051
they're like,

5674
02:38:38,051 --> 02:38:38,261
hey,

5675
02:38:38,261 --> 02:38:40,090
let's go do this and go to Napa.

5676
02:38:40,091 --> 02:38:40,570
You're like,

5677
02:38:40,570 --> 02:38:41,410
I've got to do a set.

5678
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:42,050
Yeah.

5679
02:38:42,050 --> 02:38:42,760
You know,

5680
02:38:42,760 --> 02:38:44,590
especially like when you're
really like right now,

5681
02:38:44,591 --> 02:38:45,520
like how you are right now,

5682
02:38:45,521 --> 02:38:45,720
right.

5683
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:46,990
How I am right now,

5684
02:38:46,991 --> 02:38:49,540
where you're in the middle of like a
bunch of new bits and were like super

5685
02:38:49,541 --> 02:38:50,800
excited about all these new bits.

5686
02:38:51,350 --> 02:38:53,320
Those you gotta you gotta
feed those bitches every day.

5687
02:38:53,380 --> 02:38:55,390
Like you can't just let
them say you have a new bit.

5688
02:38:55,391 --> 02:38:57,370
You can't put that fucker
on the shelf at all.

5689
02:38:57,400 --> 02:38:57,670
Right?

5690
02:38:57,670 --> 02:38:59,590
You got to jump on it
and keep watering it.

5691
02:39:00,550 --> 02:39:02,020
Nobody wants to hear that
shit if you're dating them.

5692
02:39:02,230 --> 02:39:02,351
Oh,

5693
02:39:02,351 --> 02:39:04,180
you care about is your fucking jokes.

5694
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:07,630
Just want to go to the comedy club
and make a bunch of dudes laugh.

5695
02:39:07,631 --> 02:39:08,464
Is that what it is?

5696
02:39:09,070 --> 02:39:10,510
Fucking cute up there.

5697
02:39:10,660 --> 02:39:11,493
Yeah.

5698
02:39:11,690 --> 02:39:12,950
Is Your Dick Paying me?

5699
02:39:13,970 --> 02:39:14,870
What if they said yeah,

5700
02:39:14,890 --> 02:39:15,200
yeah.

5701
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:15,581
No pain.

5702
02:39:15,581 --> 02:39:16,820
Which pay?

5703
02:39:16,821 --> 02:39:17,690
What's a bitcoin?

5704
02:39:21,830 --> 02:39:25,370
Apparently there's a Toyota dealership
that just started accepting bitcoin for

5705
02:39:25,371 --> 02:39:27,770
payment for fucking cars in Palm Beach,

5706
02:39:27,771 --> 02:39:31,640
Florida and Microsoft
start accepting bitcoin.

5707
02:39:32,110 --> 02:39:35,510
Microsoft started to invent a
accepting bitcoin for their APP,

5708
02:39:36,110 --> 02:39:37,220
their APP APP,

5709
02:39:37,221 --> 02:39:37,790
whatever it is.

5710
02:39:37,790 --> 02:39:39,710
Store they call the
store market at market,

5711
02:39:39,711 --> 02:39:40,544
whatever the fuck it is.

5712
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:40,970
Nice.

5713
02:39:40,970 --> 02:39:41,840
I don't even get it.

5714
02:39:41,870 --> 02:39:42,440
Me Neither.

5715
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:43,460
Is it kind of take off?

5716
02:39:43,461 --> 02:39:44,420
Is it worth learning about?

5717
02:39:44,660 --> 02:39:45,410
Yes.

5718
02:39:45,410 --> 02:39:45,830
Yeah.

5719
02:39:45,830 --> 02:39:48,500
If you listen to this podcast with a,

5720
02:39:48,940 --> 02:39:49,700
um,

5721
02:39:49,700 --> 02:39:51,860
Andrea has Antonopoulos
this guy that we had on,

5722
02:39:51,861 --> 02:39:55,400
we found him on three times and every
time he talks I get more and more

5723
02:39:55,401 --> 02:39:56,450
convinced and the Fizz,

chance and cause half list.

Yeah.

5728
02:40:01,100 --> 02:40:03,770
Isn't that the Brown
elephant from Sesame Street?

5729
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:04,790
I'm a grown man.

5730
02:40:06,810 --> 02:40:07,643
That's different.

5731
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:08,780
That's the guy you never see.

5732
02:40:09,230 --> 02:40:09,660
Yeah.

5733
02:40:09,660 --> 02:40:13,320
Snuffaluffagus he never say Antonopoulos

5734
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:13,491
Oh,

5735
02:40:13,491 --> 02:40:14,010
okay.

5736
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:14,880
Pay attention span.

5737
02:40:15,750 --> 02:40:16,201
Anyway.

5738
02:40:16,201 --> 02:40:16,530
Um,

5739
02:40:16,530 --> 02:40:16,951
he's,

5740
02:40:16,951 --> 02:40:18,400
he's convinced in the,

5741
02:40:18,401 --> 02:40:19,920
in the value of digital currency.

5742
02:40:19,921 --> 02:40:21,570
He's absolutely convinced and convincing.

5743
02:40:21,571 --> 02:40:22,590
He's a brilliant guy.

5744
02:40:22,770 --> 02:40:26,160
So when he talks about it and he's
as knowledgeable about Bitcoin,

5745
02:40:26,161 --> 02:40:30,840
has anybody explains the algorithm behind
creating it and he explains like why

5746
02:40:30,841 --> 02:40:32,850
it's viable and why
companies jumping on board.

5747
02:40:32,970 --> 02:40:34,230
Paypal uses it now.

5748
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:35,730
Dell computers uses it now.

5749
02:40:35,820 --> 02:40:37,290
Tiger direct uses it now.

5750
02:40:37,470 --> 02:40:37,651
I mean,

5751
02:40:37,651 --> 02:40:39,550
it's getting to the point where popup up,

5752
02:40:39,590 --> 02:40:39,901
boop,

5753
02:40:39,901 --> 02:40:40,111
boop,

5754
02:40:40,111 --> 02:40:40,470
boop.

5755
02:40:40,470 --> 02:40:42,450
Companies just up and up
are starting to use it.

5756
02:40:42,451 --> 02:40:44,850
And if it becomes an
accepted form of currency,

5757
02:40:45,420 --> 02:40:46,800
boy that's going to get really weird.

5758
02:40:46,801 --> 02:40:48,480
It didn't even exist three years ago.

5759
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:49,590
So you gotta think like three,

5760
02:40:49,591 --> 02:40:49,770
four,

5761
02:40:49,770 --> 02:40:50,311
five years ago,

5762
02:40:50,311 --> 02:40:51,270
there was no bitcoin.

5763
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:51,780
Right?

5764
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:54,120
So what is it gonna be like
five years from now if you could

5765
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:55,350
buy a car with it today?

5766
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:56,273
Wow.

5767
02:40:56,910 --> 02:40:57,151
Yeah.

5768
02:40:57,151 --> 02:40:58,080
I saw an ATM,

5769
02:40:58,081 --> 02:41:00,360
a Bitcoin ATM and
Hollywood and I was like,

5770
02:41:00,361 --> 02:41:01,194
what is that?

5771
02:41:01,220 --> 02:41:01,980
What is that?

5772
02:41:01,980 --> 02:41:02,520
Yeah.

5773
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:02,731
Yeah.

5774
02:41:02,731 --> 02:41:06,320
What the fuck is that going to be
able to adopt kids with bitcoins?

5775
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:08,910
Does the thing be paid or adopt kids?

5776
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:14,680
Do you have a plan to
buy them with bitcoins?

5777
02:41:15,090 --> 02:41:15,361
No.

5778
02:41:15,361 --> 02:41:17,550
To like never have a
kid just to adopt one,

5779
02:41:17,551 --> 02:41:18,450
but that way you pay for it.

5780
02:41:18,750 --> 02:41:19,171
Oh No,

5781
02:41:19,171 --> 02:41:20,040
I need to have a kid.

5782
02:41:20,041 --> 02:41:23,280
I think my plan is to marry like someone
that's down to be like a house dad.

5783
02:41:24,030 --> 02:41:26,850
I've been like let me make money
and you want to marry a bitch?

5784
02:41:26,930 --> 02:41:27,090
No.

5785
02:41:27,090 --> 02:41:30,780
Like he needs to be mainly too like you
can check off what in the yard by the

5786
02:41:30,781 --> 02:41:30,901
way.

5787
02:41:30,901 --> 02:41:31,734
I'm joking.

5788
02:41:31,970 --> 02:41:32,091
Did,

5789
02:41:32,091 --> 02:41:32,751
if you're a house dad,

5790
02:41:32,751 --> 02:41:33,410
you're a bitch.

5791
02:41:33,410 --> 02:41:34,243
No,

5792
02:41:34,490 --> 02:41:38,360
the the traditional roles of
a mother and father and uh,

5793
02:41:38,380 --> 02:41:38,661
you know,

5794
02:41:38,661 --> 02:41:41,030
like I have a friend who's
essentially a house mom.

5795
02:41:41,510 --> 02:41:45,560
His wife has his very high powered
job and he's a professor at Stanford.

5796
02:41:45,561 --> 02:41:47,000
He teaches like a couple of days a week,

5797
02:41:47,420 --> 02:41:48,470
but other days he's home.

5798
02:41:48,730 --> 02:41:48,960
He's,

5799
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:52,640
he saw him all the time with his kids and
he's the one who's around them all the

5800
02:41:52,641 --> 02:41:53,474
time

5801
02:41:53,790 --> 02:41:54,623
and it works.

5802
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:55,650
That's part,

5803
02:41:55,650 --> 02:42:00,240
that's one of those hard parts about being
a woman comedian too and like wanting

5804
02:42:00,241 --> 02:42:04,140
a family because where you have a
biological clock and I'm also working,

5805
02:42:04,380 --> 02:42:05,230
it's like Manhattan,

5806
02:42:05,370 --> 02:42:06,930
take their time and get,

5807
02:42:06,931 --> 02:42:11,220
establish and be 70 year old millionaire
and then find some like hot young girl

5808
02:42:11,221 --> 02:42:12,054
to impregnate.

5809
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:13,380
But we have like a,

5810
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:16,620
we have to do it like now
it's like now or never.

5811
02:42:16,710 --> 02:42:17,100
Yeah,

5812
02:42:17,100 --> 02:42:17,350
yeah.

5813
02:42:17,350 --> 02:42:18,510
You have to trick a guy quick,

5814
02:42:18,770 --> 02:42:19,121
full.

5815
02:42:19,121 --> 02:42:19,954
Like

5816
02:42:21,180 --> 02:42:21,870
how rude.

5817
02:42:21,870 --> 02:42:22,703
You don't agree Sam.

5818
02:42:22,990 --> 02:42:23,880
I'll fucking rude.

5819
02:42:24,300 --> 02:42:24,661
I feel like,

5820
02:42:24,661 --> 02:42:29,040
who wants to feel like the old
data misses like their kids stuff?

5821
02:42:29,160 --> 02:42:31,530
The dads with like millions
and millions of dollars.

5822
02:42:31,790 --> 02:42:32,601
I'm thinking like that.

5823
02:42:32,601 --> 02:42:33,500
They're just being selfish.

5824
02:42:33,530 --> 02:42:34,011
Probably.

5825
02:42:34,011 --> 02:42:34,221
You know,

5826
02:42:34,221 --> 02:42:36,470
when you see like a 65
year old guy who has a kid,

5827
02:42:36,500 --> 02:42:37,460
they're not thinking,

5828
02:42:37,490 --> 02:42:37,741
you know,

5829
02:42:37,741 --> 02:42:37,931
like,

5830
02:42:37,931 --> 02:42:38,480
boy,

5831
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:38,810
uh,

5832
02:42:38,810 --> 02:42:43,610
I know I'll be here 40 years from now
when I'm 105 this kids set and I'm going

5833
02:42:43,611 --> 02:42:44,360
to be in his life.

5834
02:42:44,360 --> 02:42:44,721
No,

5835
02:42:44,721 --> 02:42:47,330
they're just having a kid.

5836
02:42:47,450 --> 02:42:47,870
Yeah.

5837
02:42:47,870 --> 02:42:48,740
I mean maybe it's good.

5838
02:42:48,741 --> 02:42:49,490
Maybe it's bad.

5839
02:42:49,490 --> 02:42:50,030
You know,

5840
02:42:50,030 --> 02:42:50,863
who knows?

5841
02:42:50,900 --> 02:42:51,733
I mean,

5842
02:42:51,950 --> 02:42:53,510
I think that's the thing
about human beings.

5843
02:42:53,511 --> 02:42:56,090
He's like even under less
than ideal circumstances,

5844
02:42:56,091 --> 02:42:57,560
a lot of times cool people come out of it.

5845
02:42:57,890 --> 02:42:58,220
Yeah.

5846
02:42:58,220 --> 02:43:01,460
It's a real dilemma involved in raising
kids because you want to protect your

5847
02:43:01,461 --> 02:43:01,761
kids,

5848
02:43:01,761 --> 02:43:06,761
but the reality is adversity builds
character and meeting weird people,

5849
02:43:07,311 --> 02:43:10,970
shitty people mean people like it
gives you like a database to draw from.

5850
02:43:11,350 --> 02:43:12,940
And then the other thing,

5851
02:43:12,941 --> 02:43:13,840
we've talked about this before,

5852
02:43:13,841 --> 02:43:17,620
but being around people who are kind of
shitty makes you appreciate people who

5853
02:43:17,621 --> 02:43:18,454
are really cool.

5854
02:43:19,150 --> 02:43:20,620
What are you doing with
your hand gestures?

5855
02:43:21,360 --> 02:43:21,791
10 minutes.

5856
02:43:21,791 --> 02:43:22,390
Okay.

5857
02:43:22,390 --> 02:43:23,590
I wasn't sure it was behind me.

5858
02:43:23,710 --> 02:43:24,930
And then you smelled your own arm.

5859
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:29,080
And then I smelled my microphone
and caught a whiff and was like,

5860
02:43:30,060 --> 02:43:30,201
oh,

5861
02:43:30,201 --> 02:43:31,034
it's just me.

5862
02:43:31,060 --> 02:43:31,241
Oh,

5863
02:43:31,241 --> 02:43:32,140
good Lord,

5864
02:43:34,450 --> 02:43:35,283
Lord.

5865
02:43:36,340 --> 02:43:37,150
Um,

5866
02:43:37,150 --> 02:43:40,120
so kill Tony is on the
desk quad podcast network.

5867
02:43:40,150 --> 02:43:41,110
It's on pretty much,

5868
02:43:41,111 --> 02:43:42,160
you guys do it once a week,

5869
02:43:42,460 --> 02:43:42,930
right?

5870
02:43:42,930 --> 02:43:43,270
I mean,

5871
02:43:43,270 --> 02:43:44,890
the comedy store every
Monday night at eight,

5872
02:43:45,190 --> 02:43:46,570
every Monday night live the comedy store.

5873
02:43:46,571 --> 02:43:47,560
If somebody wants to get tickets,

5874
02:43:47,710 --> 02:43:48,990
did they buy them in advanced?

5875
02:43:48,991 --> 02:43:52,510
Do they get them at the
door reservations online?

5876
02:43:52,540 --> 02:43:54,180
Or You could just economy store's website.

5877
02:43:54,181 --> 02:43:54,610
Yeah.

5878
02:43:54,610 --> 02:43:58,320
So go to [inaudible] dot com and a desk,

5879
02:43:58,321 --> 02:44:01,930
squad.tv for all the links to
all the podcasts and audio,

5880
02:44:02,290 --> 02:44:03,580
video and audio,

5881
02:44:03,581 --> 02:44:07,870
and a also tour schedule
for all the Brian shows,

5882
02:44:07,900 --> 02:44:09,580
all the ones that you do with Tony.

5883
02:44:09,581 --> 02:44:10,260
And I mean,

5884
02:44:10,260 --> 02:44:11,500
you're constantly doing stuff on the road.

5885
02:44:11,530 --> 02:44:12,580
You got some shit coming up,

5886
02:44:12,610 --> 02:44:12,820
right?

5887
02:44:12,820 --> 02:44:13,653
And we have a good one.

5888
02:44:13,860 --> 02:44:14,860
Next Wednesday.

5889
02:44:14,861 --> 02:44:17,530
We're having a benefit
show at the comedy store.

5890
02:44:17,770 --> 02:44:18,550
Uh,

5891
02:44:18,550 --> 02:44:19,271
Jeff Ross is,

5892
02:44:19,271 --> 02:44:20,021
he's probably going to do it.

5893
02:44:20,021 --> 02:44:22,720
We end and Kim might actually be roasting,

5894
02:44:22,930 --> 02:44:24,580
doing a quick roast at the beginning.

5895
02:44:24,870 --> 02:44:25,390
Uh,

5896
02:44:25,390 --> 02:44:29,410
because all the money is going towards
buying a new sound system in a,

5897
02:44:29,411 --> 02:44:33,130
in the belly room where kill Tony's
recorded and where the roast battles

5898
02:44:33,131 --> 02:44:33,964
recorded.

5899
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:34,271
Uh,

5900
02:44:34,271 --> 02:44:35,104
so,

5901
02:44:35,230 --> 02:44:35,580
uh,

5902
02:44:35,580 --> 02:44:36,710
you gotta check it out at Joe.

5903
02:44:36,740 --> 02:44:37,200
Joe Said,

5904
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:39,670
you're said you're going
to do it also and yeah,

5905
02:44:39,671 --> 02:44:40,391
I'm going to do it also.

5906
02:44:40,391 --> 02:44:42,940
I'm Secura and that's going to be great.

5907
02:44:42,941 --> 02:44:45,910
We're going to get all new speakers in
the belly rooms at the live shows better.

5908
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:46,660
Yes.

5909
02:44:46,660 --> 02:44:48,310
Shows taking place on that right now.

5910
02:44:48,360 --> 02:44:49,240
It's all going through.

5911
02:44:49,570 --> 02:44:52,810
You would never believe it if you looked
at it for the energy that's in those

5912
02:44:52,811 --> 02:44:54,490
rooms during roast battle and kill Tony,

5913
02:44:54,491 --> 02:44:58,260
it's all coming through to
little tiny like bathrooms,

5914
02:44:58,261 --> 02:44:58,810
speakers,

5915
02:44:58,810 --> 02:45:00,220
how much the speakers cost.

5916
02:45:01,030 --> 02:45:01,863
I don't know.

5917
02:45:02,380 --> 02:45:05,200
W W W I told the general
manager was just go in there,

5918
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:05,771
you know,

5919
02:45:05,771 --> 02:45:07,630
knew cause they need a new sound board.

5920
02:45:07,631 --> 02:45:09,820
Also the soundboards just
as shitty sound byte.

5921
02:45:09,821 --> 02:45:12,850
It's been destroyed a thousand times.

5922
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:15,520
And so just to get a quote
and then whatever it is,

5923
02:45:15,580 --> 02:45:16,990
we'll just put it towards whatever.

5924
02:45:17,080 --> 02:45:17,980
That sounds dope.

5925
02:45:17,981 --> 02:45:21,220
So we can maybe do a few shows if
you don't make the money in one show.

5926
02:45:21,270 --> 02:45:21,680
Yeah.

5927
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:22,271
Do a few shows.

5928
02:45:22,271 --> 02:45:22,570
Yeah,

5929
02:45:22,570 --> 02:45:23,081
absolutely.

5930
02:45:23,081 --> 02:45:24,210
I think that's what it is.

5931
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:25,553

Ron Finley on the podcast.

5942
02:45:37,211 --> 02:45:40,420

in the inner city.

5945
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:46,930
He's doing like these urban farms or he's
helping people grow their own food and

5946
02:45:46,931 --> 02:45:49,870
these like abandoned lots and
teaching them how to grow healthy,

5947
02:45:49,871 --> 02:45:54,670
nutritious food in like Compton and
watts and shit like that in Inglewood.

5948
02:45:54,671 --> 02:45:55,810
It's really bad ass.

5949
02:45:56,050 --> 02:45:57,910
Something that we've been
talking about for a long time.

5950
02:45:57,911 --> 02:45:58,210
Like,

5951
02:45:58,210 --> 02:45:59,260
like people like,

5952
02:45:59,280 --> 02:46:00,880
like the cost of food,

5953
02:46:01,150 --> 02:46:04,130
like how difficult it is to like get
food and like why don't we have like

5954
02:46:04,131 --> 02:46:07,960
community farms where like the whole
block is responsible for like one,

5955
02:46:08,260 --> 02:46:11,990
one area where we all grow vegetables
and we all get the food from that and we

5956
02:46:11,991 --> 02:46:13,670
distributed evenly amongst each other.

5957
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:14,780
This guy's doing that.

5958
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:15,470
Amazing.

5959
02:46:15,470 --> 02:46:15,741

5975

5976
02:46:30,251 --> 02:46:31,290

We will be together with Young Ari Shaffir
Aka the renegade Jew super twink and

5983
02:46:43,961 --> 02:46:46,450
the renegade Jew at the
celebrity theater in Phoenix.

5984
02:46:46,660 --> 02:46:48,430
The celebrity theater spins in a circle.

5985
02:46:48,820 --> 02:46:50,200
It's like a theater in the round,

5986
02:46:50,201 --> 02:46:51,160
which is pretty interesting.

5987
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:52,593
Um,

5988
02:46:52,690 --> 02:46:53,830
and people get to look at your ass.

5989
02:46:53,831 --> 02:46:55,870
We're on stage and I'm so
excited to call it that.

5990
02:46:55,990 --> 02:46:56,320
Yeah.

5991
02:46:56,320 --> 02:46:56,710
Okay.

5992
02:46:56,710 --> 02:46:58,960
I'm going to stuff it with
the toilet paper or something.

5993
02:46:59,020 --> 02:46:59,261
Oh,

5994
02:46:59,261 --> 02:47:00,850
I thought you were gonna
say like CIA style.

5995
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:02,830
They were stuffing
people's asses with food.

5996
02:47:02,831 --> 02:47:03,664
Do you hear about that?

5997
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:04,511
Oh yeah.

5998
02:47:04,511 --> 02:47:07,300
You're actually feeding them to
get them to give up information.

5999
02:47:07,660 --> 02:47:08,171
I'll tell you what,

6000
02:47:08,171 --> 02:47:10,840
I'm never more truthful than when
you're shoving crackers into my ass.

6001
02:47:11,350 --> 02:47:11,630
Yeah.

6002
02:47:11,630 --> 02:47:13,070
That's when I really come with the truth.

6003
02:47:14,210 --> 02:47:18,710
I'll rat out anybody sense
like what kind of an asshole?

6004
02:47:18,711 --> 02:47:22,820
I guess the only way you can fucking
get that guy to talk to guy in his ass.

6005
02:47:23,820 --> 02:47:24,970
So on a ritual.

6006
02:47:25,010 --> 02:47:25,521
Oh No,

6007
02:47:25,521 --> 02:47:26,720
not that cucumber.

6008
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:30,660
Obama's.

6009
02:47:30,660 --> 02:47:31,060
Hmm.

6010
02:47:31,060 --> 02:47:31,480
All right.

6011
02:47:31,480 --> 02:47:32,260
Uh,

6012
02:47:32,260 --> 02:47:32,531
all right,

6013
02:47:32,531 --> 02:47:34,520
so we will be back podcast wise.

6014
02:47:34,521 --> 02:47:35,800
