1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,480
Hm,
hm hm.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,160
Hm.
Should I put it in airplane mode?

3
00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:08,100
Okay,
so God is dead.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,730
He.
No,

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,460
we about a bunch of people that are a 
birthday cake for God.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,890
Whoa.
What the fuck do I do with this now?

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,340
And it's infinity candles.
Do you know how fucking bad ass 

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,000
Nietzsche he felt when he said that for 
the first time where he was like,

9
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:29,001
God is dead when it meant something like
now you say and people are like 

10
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:29,001
whatever.
Who Cares?

11
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:29,700
Yeah,
no shit.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,940
But like it was like a fucking.
It was like a nuclear bomb going off the

13
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,420
declaration.
God is dead.

14
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:42,480
Do you not understand these dad?
What did meet you wrote that?

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,070
I don't know man.
I don't.

16
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:44,760
Actually I,
you know,

17
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:46,740
I have no idea.
It was,

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,560
must've been the 19 hundreds or so.
I don't know when he was,

19
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,370
Nietzsche was around.

20
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,940
He's in my call young pile while I'm 
always like,

21
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:56,010
one day I'm going to really get into his
work.

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,050
Oh man,
he's a,

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,210
he's good because he gets into your 
fucking head man because he like Carl 

24
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,060
young getting your habit.
It's more subtle.

25
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,210
Whereas like Nietzsche,
like you're reading,

26
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,310
you ever read a Philip k Dick?
Yes.

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,250
So you know how like you're getting on 
top of 18,

28
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:12,320
82.
Wow.

29
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,560
What?
Philip k Dot Dick.

30
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,290
He was kind of crazy,
but he was genius.

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,710
So when you read his,
his fiction,

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,420
it's like you stop reading it and you 
feel a little crazy for a second because

33
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:27,900
something about the way he's writing 
just isn't normally something off man.

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,550
Nietzsche,
it's the same way.

35
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:34,551
It's like when you stop reading him,
you're going to like spend the next few 

36
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:36,060
days like fuck.
Or like burroughs.

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,840
Yeah,
same,

38
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,600
same thing.
An outsider artists kind of like,

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,900
I remember reading some of burrows stuff
and thinking like I might get high just 

40
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,150
reading this.

41
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,080
Yeah.
You know,

42
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,460
like,
like naked lunch.

43
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:48,060
That was him,
right?

44
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,270
That Terence Mckenna at the same thing.
Oh yeah.

45
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,020
You just start tripping when you start 
reading his writing.

46
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,790
Like could you just start to think,
God,

47
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,830
I wish I could write like that man.
You could.

48
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,120
How dare you?
Well,

49
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,430
I mean you would have to spend a lot of 
time.

50
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:03,600
Right?
And if it's all it is,

51
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,040
yeah,
that's the only thing that's holding you

52
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,540
back because the amount of time that you
would've spent writing,

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,440
you would love it.
You would enjoy it.

54
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,010
You know,
he saw Mckenna had some fascinating 

55
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,010
books,
food of the Gods.

56
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,070
Oh,
here's some crazy fucking theories that 

57
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,991
he pitched that I've seen scientists 
like bow the especially the doubling of 

58
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:28,131
the human brain size one.
That was a really fascinating theory 

59
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:28,131
that he had,
that he.

60
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,840
He connected it.
I'm she,

61
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,500
I'm not sure if he was right in terms of
the climate of logical data,

62
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,250
but his contention for those,
were you aware of it?

63
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,280
It was a monkey's had come down from the
trees and they experimented with new 

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,431
food sources and they started flipping 
over cow patties to get the books 

65
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:49,791
because that's what they do.
And along the line they discovered 

66
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,690
silicide mushrooms and he thinks that 
the grasslands,

67
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,350
the rain forest becoming grasslands,
the changing climate led to these 

68
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,040
chimps,
these monkeys,

69
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,310
whatever our ancestors

70
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,560
were led to them becoming more 
experimental.

71
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,580
And that,
that qbe coincided with a bunch of 

72
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,731
different things that they know about 
mushrooms or it could be a sort of 

73
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:11,731
confirmed with a bunch of different 
things.

74
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,740
One with that mushrooms increased visual
acuity and they shown this like in 

75
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,300
actual actual test with real scientists 
who were experimenting with it.

76
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,000
Who was the other guy?
There was one German guy,

77
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,670
a straight guy to that experimented with
this.

78
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,040
God Damn it.
Trying to remember his name,

79
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,900
but he was.
He had a really funny line.

80
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,850
What do you mean a straight gas straight
guy?

81
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:37,120
Meaning he wasn't a drug guy,
he wasn't a drug culture guy.

82
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,190
I don't mean straight like homosexual,
heterosexual.

83
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:44,191
I mean like uh,
he wasn't like Timothy leary or Mckenna 

84
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:47,911
or you know,
any of these guys are like clear 

85
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:49,420
proponents of psychedelics.
He was just,

86
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,770
I'm a researcher.

87
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,460
And they had found out that in low doses
of Psilocybin,

88
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,700
like say if you change an angle,
if you have two parallel lines and you 

89
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,050
made one just varied it ever so slightly
with the Psilocybin,

90
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,080
they could tell when the angle was ever 
so slightly varied quicker than they 

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,110
could naturally.
Yeah.

92
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:09,520
I,
I can remember.

93
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,700
Yeah.
It's a visual acuity acuity and the in 

94
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,801
the periphery.
So it's like expanding your peripheral 

95
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,050
vision by a tiny,
tiny little bit.

96
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,080
Yeah.
I don't know if the test pertained to 

97
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,421
periphery only.
It might've been peripherally as well 

98
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:27,850
because I do remember that one specific 
task,

99
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,460
that one specific thing where they were 
trying to figure out,

100
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,170
um,
how quickly you could recognize one of 

101
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:36,550
the angles changed and you could do it 
quicker when you were high.

102
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,960
That's crazy.
Yeah.

103
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:41,140
So there's that.
And then there's the horniness mushrooms

104
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,120
have known to make people horny.

105
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,520
So that happens.
We are known for that.

106
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,830
The creativity aspect of it,
there's that,

107
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,800
you know,
like the,

108
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,710
the tapping into alternative ways of 
thinking and that would lead to a lot of

109
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:57,400
innovation.
And it's also possible that,

110
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,300
that it's really possible,
it's silicide been in some ways is a 

111
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:03,640
nutrient mean.
It's also,

112
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:06,220
it's an intoxicant for sure.
It's an a hallucinogenic,

113
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,390
yes,
whatever that means,

114
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,640
but it,
it might be a nutrient to.

115
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,450
It's entirely possible that this 
increase in visual acuity and this,

116
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,270
uh,
this horniness that it gives you in this

117
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,170
connection to nature and this,
uh,

118
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,210
intense creativity like you're tapping 
into a river of ideas and like scooping 

119
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:24,790
out buckets of them.
Yeah,

120
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,150
like all that might also.
It might be something that when you're 

121
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:35,191
consuming,
it's actually beneficial to the body or 

122
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:37,591
beneficial to your brain if it's having 
all those crazy positive effects on the 

123
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:41,341
brain,
they might have like a beneficial long 

124
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,390
term effect on the brain.
And they've been doing these studies on 

125
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,671
neurons on repairing neurons and 
psilocybin and psilocybin bins role in 

126
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:50,860
repairing brain disease,
brain brain issues.

127
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,570
Brain trauma might not have been 
neurons.

128
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,580
So you could find that,
um,

129
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,940
the most recent studies with psilocybin 
and brain damage and they think it might

130
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,620
in some ways be able to repair brain 
damage.

131
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,520
Well,
if that's the case,

132
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:09,521
what if these monkeys were just eating 
them all the time and their brains just 

133
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:09,521
grew?
I mean,

134
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:10,520
what if Mckenna was right?

135
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,750
Well,
yeah,

136
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,770
I mean,
I think,

137
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,490
I think it is pretty safe.
A safe bet that a monkeys are what I 

138
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,340
mean,
monkey isn't the right word.

139
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:23,340
Proto Hominids right?
Who are wandering the planes are gonna.

140
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Like if we're omnivores,
we're definitely going to be eating 

141
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,360
whatever,
uh,

142
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,090
whatever.
We can find that.

143
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:32,090
It gives us nutrition that has 
nutritional value.

144
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,550
Especially if you're out in the hunt,
you're hungry.

145
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,820
The thing you're hunting,
shitting food is growing out of it.

146
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:38,270
Shit.

147
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:38,920
Yeah.
Well,

148
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,560
I don't even think they were hunting 
then.

149
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,570
I don't think they could hunt something 
that big.

150
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,670
I don't think they had weapons.
What do you mean?

151
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,650
Think what they were doing was they were
gathering,

152
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:48,650
they were eating a lot of bugs.
We were insectivore.

153
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,790
I thought his idea was that the,
there's climate change and so we start 

154
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:58,060
moving into the grasslands and then 
yeah,

155
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,990
we're hunting bovine animal.
So we're like.

156
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,000
So I don't think that was the 
contention.

157
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,570
Contention was flipping over the cow 
patties.

158
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,670
I thought it was that because the thing 
that you're hunting is going to be 

159
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,130
shitting things that grow mushrooms.

160
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,130
No,
I don't think so.

161
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,530
I think it was way later when they 
started doing that.

162
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,150
Um,
one of the things.

163
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,330
Here's a study that Jamie pulled up.
It says psilocybin mushrooms stimulate 

164
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,010
the growth of brain cells.
Psychedelic mushrooms have already had a

165
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:32,011
reputation for helping people open their
minds and broaden their perspectives in 

166
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:36,211
the world.
Some have shown the ability to combat 

167
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:36,211
mental disorders like depression,
anxiety,

168
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:40,111
and now research is showing that magic 
mushrooms can actually help physically 

169
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:41,950
rebuild a damaged brain.
Well,

170
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:46,951
if that's the case,
it was a case that it can physically 

171
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:49,240
help rebuild a damaged brain,
maybe over longterm consumption.

172
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,270
It can actually make a brain grow.
I think I'm almost positive that 

173
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,720
Mckenna's idea was not that they were 
hunting these things,

174
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,870
but they were flipping over cow patties 
looking for beetles and forums and 

175
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,210
stuff.
Because I think we're talking about like

176
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,060
really small,
ancient hominids.

177
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,110
Okay.
We really hunted until we figured out 

178
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,630
tools or I mean not like large scale 
large animal type hunting.

179
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,960
So that was,
I think that was way later than the 

180
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:15,960
human brain size growing.
Like when they,

181
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,400
when they develop like the adult adult 
you ever seen someone use that?

182
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,870
Now it's the precursor to the bow and 
Arrow before the bow and arrow,

183
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,790
they figured out a thing called an adult
adult.

184
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,080
Yeah.
It's crazy.

185
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:31,081
It's a,
it's got a handle on it and you put a 

186
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:33,241
spear in it and you launch the spear 
with a handle like almost like it's a 

187
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,450
crazy lacrosse ball that's there.
That's what it looks like.

188
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,850
There's guys that make,
um,

189
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,140
and there's videos.
Jamie,

190
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:43,900
you could see a guy that made his own 
and used it.

191
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,270
There's a bunch of them actually.
But uh,

192
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,430
you know,
people take those things and they,

193
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,210
they throw them at targets and they're 
not very accurate.

194
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,120
I mean they're okay.
Accurate in comparison to I guess if you

195
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:02,121
were,
you weren't skilled and you try to hit 

196
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:05,511
it with a rock.
I mean it's probably more accurate than 

197
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:05,511
that.
And if you could sneak up on an animal,

198
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,860
you could probably get some good 
penetration and they probably got really

199
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:12,861
good at it eventually.
But that was the first of many weapons 

200
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,650
that could launch things through the air
that they figured out.

201
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:15,740
Okay.

202
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Have you seen that?
I'm that weird ritual that chimpanzees 

203
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:24,100
are doing where they throw rocks at a 
tree if you seen that?

204
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,050
Yeah.
What does that or they don't know.

205
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:31,051
It just is like,
it's the idea that like they're 

206
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:31,420
developing their own weird culture,
their own superstition or something,

207
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,210
something that they just feel like 
something,

208
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,760
they're doing something.
I mean we don't understand what it is,

209
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:41,761
but it's a thing where you throwing 
rocks at trees and then there's all 

210
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:44,890
these rocks that are kind of like laying
around certain trees because chimps have

211
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:47,440
decided to just start lobbing rocks at 
him.

212
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:52,441
And they were saying,
is this like some emerging chimpanzee 

213
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,430
religion or culture?
Like,

214
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,500
Oh yeah,
it's very weird man.

215
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:59,200
Like what?
What are they doing?

216
00:09:59,201 --> 00:09:59,740
Why

217
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,840
do you know that they have.
It's sort of been agreed upon by a lot 

218
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:08,330
of the people that study these animals 
that they're entering to the Stone Age,

219
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,920
right?
Like this is,

220
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,980
this is the actual,
like when they're talking about 

221
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,540
chimpanzees and they're looking at their
growth in their learning,

222
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,350
they're thinking they're in a new place,
they're thinking they're starting to use

223
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:26,351
tools and they're starting to use stones
and other great apes are using tools as 

224
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:28,610
well.
Like we knew that they would get not we,

225
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:30,230
like you and I are out there doing 
research

226
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,820
as we predicted it,

227
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,770
as we predicted Duncan,
they,

228
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,780
you know,
we always knew that you sticks to get 

229
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,100
like termites and stuff,
but now they're figuring out a way to do

230
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:45,101
all kinds of crazy shit.
Have you ever seen the one orangutan 

231
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:45,101
that figured out how to spearfish?

232
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:49,660
Yeah,
I did see that shit fucking picture of 

233
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:49,670
him hanging over the river with a spirit
is easy.

234
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,200
It's insane.
To me.

235
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:56,201
What's really particularly interesting 
is that as well as our society and our 

236
00:10:56,211 --> 00:11:00,410
species is moving into some new era as 
we're moving into some.

237
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,890
God knows what the fuck it is.
These guys are too.

238
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,400
They're moving for them.
That what?

239
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,050
That state of the art.
That's some high.

240
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,080
That's fucking.
You're looking at God in my Elon Musk 

241
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,230
right there.
That's the Elan Musk have a rank.

242
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:16,780
It's like,
what the fuck?

243
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:17,930
Look at him.
He's like,

244
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,560
fucking using that thing to get fish.
He's a genius.

245
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,710
That's genius.
Like in the same way that like we have 

246
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,741
people sending things to Mars,
but it's funny that the two are 

247
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:30,800
coinciding like.
It's funny that it appears now.

248
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:32,420
I don't know how long has it been going 
on,

249
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,720
but it seems like this sort of trickle 
in of stories of monkeys suddenly doing,

250
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,160
doing things like this.
It could be related to just more people 

251
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,740
researching and getting more data that's
always been there.

252
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:46,250
Who knows?

253
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,690
One Jamie or the same chip.
The same orangutan is the same guy.

254
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,980
Oh,
there's a whole of them doing it.

255
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,700
Oh Shit.
Funny.

256
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,280
Orangutang fishing.
Wow.

257
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,780
Ha Ha.
It's just funny.

258
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,960
You're your leap forward in evolutionary
history.

259
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:09,961
It's funny to see huge hairy thing,
so we're looking at them sitting there 

260
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:14,671
hanging on this rock looking over at 
this little puddle that they have 

261
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:18,880
fishing and it's obviously set up.
So I think they probably taught him how 

262
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,440
to do this.
He's not fishing in the wild.

263
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,110
He's like,
it's almost like he's getting groceries.

264
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,300
It seems like a very small little,
uh,

265
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,780
like a puddle of with fish in it,
you know,

266
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,320
like they just taught him how to do it.
They're kind of cheating.

267
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,880
Yeah.
That's cheating.

268
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,910
The other orangutan was doing it hanging
over a flowing river like he was.

269
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:42,280
He was really figuring out as he was 
going along.

270
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,850
It was this guy there and he's like,
fucking picking at ropes.

271
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,730
This is a puddle.

272
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,730
Right.
It seems like this is something new or 

273
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:53,730
something.
Yeah,

274
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,321
right.
It seems like something they did for 

275
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:58,321
science,
like they figured out a way to teach him

276
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:03,091
how to stab those fish.
Like if you just teach them that that's 

277
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:03,310
where the fish are and you get it with a
stick that's not as impressive.

278
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,650
That's like you can teach a dog to do 
that.

279
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,160
Well,
I mean,

280
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:11,050
I think I've seen birds,
I think it's birds that use that there's

281
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:16,051
some video of a bird like putting bait 
down and then catching something with 

282
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:16,720
it.
Like other creatures,

283
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,490
you know,
use bait to fish.

284
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,970
There are others that do it.
I've seen that too.

285
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,440
Yeah,
I've seen birds do it.

286
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,070
Um,
don't,

287
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,000
uh,
orcas do it to have an orchestra on it.

288
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,800
I don't know if they,
I didn't know they use bait.

289
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,730
Yeah.
Why do I feel like orchesis I've done it

290
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:34,120
too.

291
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,960
Yeah,
there you go.

292
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,300
Look at that smart guy.
Look at that.

293
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,450
Yeah.
It's really interesting,

294
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:41,290
right?
Yeah.

295
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,320
He just sits there and waits.
He waits for the fish to come near the 

296
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,320
bread.
He's like baiting.

297
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,860
Like how did he figure it out?
It's did.

298
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Did he see something,
do it or did he like innovate this 

299
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,870
himself?
He a real good question.

300
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,190
Taught them that.
And this isn't even like one of the most

301
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:01,300
clever birds like ravens.
Ravens are the most clever.

302
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,710
Yeah.
It's got to,

303
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,200
gives bread.
It goes too far away.

304
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,240
See it gets away and he's like,
no bitch.

305
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,150
Nobody rides for free.
Bring them back.

306
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,890
Keep it right there,
right.

307
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,450
They,
they tried to move away with it.

308
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,190
Got Too far away.
He's like,

309
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:15,540
no,
no,

310
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:15,760
no,
no,

311
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:16,190
no,
no,

312
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,200
no,
bitch.

313
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:21,010
They're right here.
Have you seen.

314
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:23,590
I'm sure that that just snatched that 
fish.

315
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,050
That's such as like,
what in the fuck just happened?

316
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,500
The thing about it is it snatched it up 
and here's the thing.

317
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,500
That bird is not that much bigger than 
that fish.

318
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,400
And it did it like it was nothing.
That's how creepy birds are.

319
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,620
Hooky snacked them and just walked away 
with it.

320
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:42,400
Like no big deal.
It's like you have an like a small puppy

321
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,620
in your hands.
That's how I walked away with it.

322
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,250
I mean bigger than a puppy.
Like that thing's bigger than his head.

323
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,860
That's like a full sized dog.
Oh yeah.

324
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,010
For.
But I'm saying like

325
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,260
the way he held it was the way you a 
puppy,

326
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,700
like you'd have no problem walking with 
my light,

327
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,120
but that thing is,
you know,

328
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,510
probably 25 percent of its body weight 
and he's mostly feathers.

329
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,430
Right.
Take away all of his feathers.

330
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,580
That fish might be at the very least,
might be like 15 percent of its body 

331
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:11,450
weight.

332
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,190
Yeah.
Have you ever heard the idea of like a,

333
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,510
you know,
like we smack a,

334
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,510
uh,
an aunt or something,

335
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:21,500
he smashed Nat and that Dan has no,
no idea what.

336
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,880
There's no way that could possibly 
comprehend what has happened to it.

337
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:26,990
Like when Irwin,
that you know,

338
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,420
you have a line of ants going into your 
sink or whatever,

339
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,370
that line of ants,
they can't comprehend what you are like,

340
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:39,371
you walk by the line of ants,
they have some instinct may be to run 

341
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:43,181
away from you.
A lot of times they don't even run away 

342
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:44,711
from you.
He turned the scene on kill like 30 of 

343
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:45,340
them in a second,
but they don't,

344
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,380
they can't,
they're there whatever way they used to 

345
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:50,380
think they can't process it.
Right?

346
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,431
So death to that ant it,
it's going to be processing its 

347
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,720
extinction in some way that we can't 
even understand.

348
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Right?
So there's this idea from my friend was 

349
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,320
telling me that I'm the same way when a 
human dies,

350
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,110
what we process is like,
oh yeah,

351
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,210
he got in a car accident,
man.

352
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,400
What really happened was some kind of 
like hyper dimensional event that we can

353
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:18,401
only see one tiny piece of that looks 
like a car accident in the way our minds

354
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:23,681
process,
the thing being wiped off the face of 

355
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:24,410
this dimension is by like,
oh,

356
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:25,430
car,
red car wreck.

357
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,870
But really there's like all these other 
levels involved.

358
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:34,871
So it's like maybe some hyper 
dimensional entity just squashed your 

359
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,950
friend.
And the way it manifested is like,

360
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,670
oh,
a car wreck.

361
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,650
It was a car wreck.
But really no.

362
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,860
That's just the way our brains process 
that event from where we're at currently

363
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:50,230
in the,
in our ability to like comprehend 

364
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,230
reality.

365
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,420
People listen to this.
Does that mean I can text and drive?

366
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,270
Texting and driving is easy.
It's fine.

367
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,880
That's the way they see when they see 
you doing that.

368
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,590
They smash you.
You know?

369
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,500
Maybe it's just an accident.
What maybe death.

370
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,780
No,
maybe the accidents or just accidents.

371
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,720
Maybe it's not a hyper dimensional being
squished down on you.

372
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,060
Oh man,
it looks like things are not like that 

373
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,390
man.
But we don't.

374
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,450
I mean really we,
uh,

375
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,430
we don't,
we don't,

376
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:19,431
we don't know.
But that did the same way these chimps 

377
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:20,940
are like doing these things at times 
seem like pretty cute.

378
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:24,450
Really cute.
In the same way like,

379
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,230
you know,
there is this idea that we're going to 

380
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,230
sort of go,
God,

381
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,660
I wish I could remember who explained 
this.

382
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,530
It's like,
okay,

383
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,800
human existence up until the point of 
flight was completely based on like 

384
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,480
getting,
like you would climb a mountain and then

385
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:42,360
you could see the ground,
like you're from an airplane,

386
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,760
but that's pretty much it.
Climb up a tree.

387
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:49,761
I guess you get some altitude.
You can see this whole new perspective 

388
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:53,570
on what look like from a high place,
but you certainly couldn't get the 

389
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,231
perspective of flying through the air 
and looking down at all this stuff that 

390
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:59,850
formerly in front of you is like looming
over you.

391
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,600
It's like when I,
uh,

392
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,150
you know,
I have two little dogs,

393
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,770
adorable door,
have a little babies,

394
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:08,160
but you picked them up and like for you 
it's no big deal,

395
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:11,400
but for that dog it seeing what's on top
of the fucking counters man,

396
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:12,480
it's like,
doesn't see that.

397
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:17,481
Usually it's looking up at everything.
So it transforms it's reality a little 

398
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:21,291
bit.
So flight transformed human reality and 

399
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,611
this intense way and now the satellites 
floating around our planet if 

400
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:28,530
transformed it even more because we see,
oh shit,

401
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:30,630
yeah,
we're on a planet where like it's a ball

402
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:33,030
that were floating around or a flat 
earth or whatever.

403
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,090
But uh,
but the,

404
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:37,770
uh,
so in the same way,

405
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:43,130
the next,
the next sort of lift off is to somehow 

406
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,691
rise above the time space continuum.
So that time itself becomes an object 

407
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,961
instead of a thing that we're stuck 
inside of that's the next big liftoff 

408
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:55,560
and that there are already things that 
are,

409
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,830
see time as an object instead of,
as a river that were currently being 

410
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:00,930
rolled around in.

411
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,430
And for them we look totally different.
So that's the next.

412
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,460
That's what like maybe Mckenna was 
talking about the idea of the time 

413
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,810
machine or the singularity or whatever.
Is that like once we figure that out,

414
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:15,210
I know there's never going to be a 
fucking time.

415
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:16,410
He said no,
it's insane,

416
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:19,590
but that theoretically it's possible.
You know,

417
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:24,591
people do say it.
It could be possible like there's no 

418
00:19:24,591 --> 00:19:26,460
necessarily.
There is no reason for us to be stuck in

419
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:31,461
the current way that we are.
At least that's from the fucking a 

420
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,090
documentary I saw when I was super stone
four years ago.

421
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:38,130
Like they were saying you could use the 
power of a star or something to.

422
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,340
Yeah.
I'm trying to remember who was German 

423
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,241
mathematician.
It was like a German mathematician that 

424
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:50,960
theorized about the time machine time 
machine would have to be.

425
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,770
I want to say the machine would have to 
be like as big as the solar system to be

426
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:58,610
spinning at the speed of light and the 
transversus access or something.

427
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,940
That's it.
Yeah.

428
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:01,050
Something like that.
Insane.

429
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:02,490
But it's like,
it's not.

430
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,040
I mean,
obviously for where we're at right now,

431
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,220
this isn't a feasible option,
but if it's possible and we exist in an 

432
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:15,471
infinite universe,
then why wouldn't things have 

433
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:17,700
potentially figured out a way to,
to get beyond the time space continuum.

434
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:18,230
So like,
you know,

435
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,190
we're looking for aliens inside of time 
and space,

436
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,420
you know,
but maybe there's like the thing we 

437
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,091
should be that we're looking for.
We don't even have the technology to 

438
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:32,451
scan outside of past,
present and future because that's what 

439
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,290
we're in right now.
These things are like way outside of our

440
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,600
understanding of what,
um,

441
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,600
of what this even is.
We can't even fucking see them.

442
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:42,270
Like the ants can't see us.
Like we can't even see him.

443
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,700
We couldn't talk to them and aunt can't 
talk to you,

444
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:50,050
you know,
I saved to be from my swimming pool and 

445
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:50,050
I swear to God,
it seemed like it was thanking me.

446
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,390
Like I pulled it out.
Were you one to 10?

447
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,140
How,
when am I not have is the question.

448
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,180
But I pulled,
I pulled the,

449
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:03,181
uh,
I pulled the bumblebee out and I put it 

450
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:03,181
down.
I was like watching it,

451
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:03,700
it's really cool,
you know,

452
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:07,390
it's like dried itself off and went 
through this whole thing.

453
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,290
It's like watching a dog dry itself off 
and then I,

454
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,570
and then it did this cool little like,
I swear it was like a little dance in 

455
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,111
front of me,
like this weird little cool little 

456
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:19,111
bobbing dance thing and then flew away.
I'm like,

457
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,660
did that fucking be just like thanked me
or like,

458
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:25,600
was that like some form of attempting to
communicate with me?

459
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,210
I mean bs certainly communicate with 
each other.

460
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:33,510
There is communication among insects and
I don't know if they're aware that we 

461
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,000
exist,
but if they talk to each other,

462
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,370
isn't it possible they might try to talk
to us.

463
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,470
Did I ever tell you about the uh,
the time on fear factor where the bees 

464
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,830
communicated with local bees to tell you
that I didn't tell.

465
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:47,850
You know,
this is a fascinating moment because 

466
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,700
there was a guy who was a beekeeper and 
what he was doing as he was a,

467
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,370
it was at the sage brush.
Sage brush rent.

468
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,070
No,
I forget the name of the ranch,

469
00:21:55,071 --> 00:22:00,071
but it just burnt down in Santa Clarita.
This big ranch they used to film TV 

470
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:00,590
shows out there.
Um,

471
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,560
they put these people,
they put them,

472
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,800
they attached them to like this,
this rope and then they made him stand,

473
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:12,470
like connected to this pole and they 
covered them with bs,

474
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,530
like covered them from head to toe with 
bees and they had to stand there for a 

475
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,080
certain amount of time.
Some people didn't get stung at all.

476
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:20,720
It's really interesting like this guy 
really knew some people got stung.

477
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,750
I got stung just being around them.
But this guy really knew how to take 

478
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,090
care of these beats is really like I was
covered in bees at one point in time and

479
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:33,440
you just stay calm and eventually blows 
them off you with smoking shit.

480
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,270
Anyway,
while they're doing this,

481
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,070
he's got his own.
He's a beekeeper.

482
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:42,071
So he's got his own hive.
This local group of bees came over and 

483
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:46,871
they met in the sky above us and all of 
his bees went up to talk to all those 

484
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:48,710
beats and he said,
we gotta get Outta here.

485
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,530
We have to stand back and let them work 
this out.

486
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,740
We have to stop filming with,
stand back and let us work this out.

487
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:57,710
So it was me and my friend David 
Horowitz,

488
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,950
who was a producer show.
We were looking at each other like 

489
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:02,950
they're gonna talk it out like what the 
fuck?

490
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,400
And we're sitting there watching these 
bees above us just getting together.

491
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,420
And they were literally trying to sort 
out who these new beads were,

492
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,850
what their plans were on fear factor,
man,

493
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,600
can you get me on that show?
Are you in Sag?

494
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,240
Crazy dude,
that's crazy.

495
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,360
It was really interesting and it lasted 
for about a half an hour,

496
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:31,361
if I remember correctly.
They talked it out for half an hour and 

497
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:31,970
then the other bees went their separate 
way and then everybody figured out.

498
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:36,971
Everybody knew where everybody belonged.
Like those tiny little itsy bitsy 

499
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:41,120
pinhead brains had decided these are not
their friends.

500
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,180
These are their friends,
this is where they belong there in this 

501
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,180
traveling hive.
Yeah,

502
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,340
for some reason

503
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,020
is in the middle of Santa Clarita right 
now.

504
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,420
It's not.
I mean,

505
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:55,421
all the levels of communication 
happening around us at any given moment 

506
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:56,290
are.
It's astounding.

507
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,880
We can't deal with it.
Like it's just too much to handle.

508
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:04,030
So we sort of get focused on our own 
little lives as human beings or 

509
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,220
whatever.
But fuck man,

510
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,050
there's a lot more going on.
I mean,

511
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:07,640
just that,
you know,

512
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:10,610
that if that's happening with bees 
there's didn't.

513
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,810
It's probably happening with everything.
And so then we're in this like,

514
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,450
and we talk about this a lot,
but that means we really are in a matrix

515
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:22,451
of intelligence and we've just decided 
to focus on this one the way that we're 

516
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:23,760
doing it right now,
you know,

517
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,220
which is a pretty uh,
it's sad in a weird way because we do,

518
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:32,240
you do cut out.
You cut yourself out of a whole other,

519
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,220
uh,
community.

520
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,730
That's what one of the things I like 
about,

521
00:24:35,731 --> 00:24:38,810
like the native American mythology is 
that they,

522
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,190
uh,
you know,

523
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:44,570
it seems like they had less of a 
distinction between humans and animals.

524
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,250
It was like,
these are our brothers to.

525
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,780
I'm confused of what you're saying 
though.

526
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:49,580
You're cutting yourself out of a 
community.

527
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:50,930
Like what do you mean?
So it's like,

528
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:52,130
okay,
like,

529
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,920
let's just take it from the human love 
you.

530
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:57,140
A lot of people,
they don't even mean to be,

531
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,580
but they're snobs,
right.

532
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,920
So they'll see humans snaps,
right?

533
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:04,150
So a human snob is exclusive,
right?

534
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,160
So they have this exclusive relationship
with the world where they allow into 

535
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,000
their periphery or in their circle of 
friends.

536
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,070
I'm letting you into my circle of 
friends.

537
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:18,190
So I have this tight circle of friends 
and then other people based on whatever 

538
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,320
their particular metric is for 
determining who they want around them,

539
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,180
you know,
shit snobs are the ones who will happen.

540
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:29,230
You know,
there's people who happen to only be 

541
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,171
friends with successful people.
It's like they're only friends with 

542
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:35,591
like,
like celebrities and their own for like 

543
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:38,771
weird.
That's a weird coincidence out of that 

544
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:38,771
APP.
Holy Shit,

545
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:38,771
I don't understand what happened,
you know,

546
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:41,720
so there's that which is like for them 
they want to interact into,

547
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,680
in this particular,
like part of the societal ecosystem,

548
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,310
which means they're excluding,
excluding,

549
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:54,311
excluding,
excluding all these other fucking 

550
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:54,311
people.
Right.

551
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:57,520
And so the moment you stop your,
you started experimenting with not 

552
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,061
excluding people as much as you can.
It doesn't mean you let annoying people 

553
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,300
around or people who have their don't 
have your,

554
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,450
your good intentions with you around or 
whatever.

555
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,330
You sound like you're giving advice to 
stuck up Hollywood elites.

556
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,230
No,
I'm giving advice.

557
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,440
Just not.
It's not just in Hollywood.

558
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,870
It's like it's the elites in general.

559
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,970
There's actually some book I heard about
it and read it.

560
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:21,530
It's a really cool idea that would just 
like the Galapagos Islands here.

561
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:26,531
We have these beings that have evolved 
in a certain way because they're 

562
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:26,531
completely separated from everything 
else.

563
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:29,000
It's fascinating to see.
So in the same way,

564
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,290
there's a kind of economic galapagos 
that happens with wealthy people,

565
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:38,291
which is that they only get around each 
other and so they start mating within 

566
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,810
their own circles and they started 
exchanging only information that wealthy

567
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:45,540
people have.
And so this creates a kind of hybrid,

568
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:50,160
a weird new form of human being,
which is the elite wealthy class,

569
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:55,310
not a new idea.
The kings and Queens would only like 

570
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,630
fuck with him blood lines and stuff.
I use an intentional form of like wealth

571
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:59,130
eugenics or something.
But.

572
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,230
So,
uh,

573
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,400
but anyway,
what ends up happening when you're doing

574
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:07,401
that is you end up cutting off all these
other forms of information that come in.

575
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,260
And then also you start living according
to a pretty ridiculous fucking idea,

576
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:17,220
which is that all these other people,
whatever they're doing,

577
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,870
whoever they are,
whatever it is,

578
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,940
you know,
that's just not really worth it.

579
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,970
Like,
what does that person really have to 

580
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:26,730
tell me that I need to hear you know,
what it is?

581
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:31,731
Or is it that they feel like they can 
get along with those other people 

582
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:34,791
because the other people going to 
understand them because people do find 

583
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:38,091
like minded groups of people and hang 
out together and if you're like some 

584
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:41,370
super wealthy rothschild guy and you 
become friends with some weirdo painter,

585
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:42,530
dude,
I mean,

586
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,570
how much do you guys have in common?
It doesn't mean you have so much in 

587
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:47,570
common,
so much.

588
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:47,640
Really.
Fuck yeah,

589
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:48,240
you do,
man.

590
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:51,760
You have the human condition.
You have that gravity.

591
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:53,580
You're both dealing with the 
gravitational field.

592
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,580
He wrote in a fucking body that's 
goddamn melting down with the 

593
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,210
progression of time you're a.
you're probably going to have to.

594
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,800
Both of you are going to have to bury 
your mom.

595
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,840
You're going to have to bury your dad.
You're both.

596
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,020
There's so many.
There's a lot of things you have in 

597
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,121
common,
but they would have to completely open 

598
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:13,431
their mind up to accept.
All these things have to change the way 

599
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:14,730
a person thinks and you have to change 
it in essence who they are.

600
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Right?
And some people just don't have any 

601
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,000
desire to do that.
Well there's the problem.

602
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,721
And what's even worse is when that is,
when that kind of idea is the.

603
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,460
The is like encouraged when that's like 
looked at as like,

604
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,210
oh this is just a totally normal way to 
be.

605
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:35,211
Yeah,
just the club up Kanga town were cheap 

606
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:40,970
shit.

607
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,940
It's like,
so that exclusivity,

608
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:48,810
even from a human perspective,
cuts you off to all these.

609
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,990
A lot of data.
Admittedly some of that data is probably

610
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:56,991
going to suck,
but a lot of the data is going to be 

611
00:28:56,991 --> 00:28:57,750
you're really fucking good information 
that can make your life better.

612
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,150
Stuff's gonna come to you that you would
never expect when you stopped being a.

613
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,790
When you reduce your exclusivity.
So in that same way humans as a species 

614
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,870
are exclusive,
right?

615
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:14,871
We are.
We place ourselves as the top of the 

616
00:29:14,871 --> 00:29:15,600
food chain,
human beings,

617
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:20,601
and underneath this is all this,
all this incredible biomass filled with 

618
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:23,520
all these other forms of life that we 
have managed.

619
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,580
Many people have managed to reduced to 
being some kind of meat machine or 

620
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,360
vegetable or vegetable.
Exactly.

621
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,160
Or plant life,
whatever it is.

622
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,140
It's all life.
It's all life.

623
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:34,620
And,
and,

624
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,430
and anytime you start talking about like
I,

625
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,070
I'm not positive about this,
but I feel like I can with

626
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,710
this plant in some way.
Like when I'm watering my plants,

627
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,050
I swear to God,
man.

628
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,910
Some little piece of me is like,
I think they know I'm watering them.

629
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:52,060
Like I think there's an awareness here.
I don't know if it's really either,

630
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,440
but it does feel interesting.
Yeah.

631
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:59,441
I've been in grow rooms before.
There you go grow rooms or like it's 

632
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:00,760
like you walked into a room full of 
happy aliens.

633
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,170
It's really what it's like.
Hey guys,

634
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:09,010
doing it really feels like you're saying
hi to all these plants.

635
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,480
It might be a hundred percent bullshit.
It might be 100 percent in my 

636
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,510
imagination I might've concocted out of 
thin air.

637
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,780
But going back to what you were saying 
earlier about ants and the system that 

638
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,581
ants live under and bees are.
These bees can communicate with each 

639
00:30:26,581 --> 00:30:26,710
other through pheromones and some other 
way.

640
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,540
I mean,
I don't know exactly how they're sorting

641
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:29,830
out who's who and which.

642
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:35,020
Yeah.
Which clan belongs in what part of the 

643
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,920
woods or you know who the fuck that was,
but the thing that we know about human 

644
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:43,270
beings is that there are signals that 
are around us constantly,

645
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:47,860
that we can't detect wifi and radio and 
television and satellite.

646
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,580
All that stuff is broadcasting around 
us,

647
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:54,430
through the air,
around us constantly and we can't detect

648
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:59,050
it and we also know that all throughout 
nature of these animals that are blind,

649
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:00,880
there's animals that can't see.
There's worms.

650
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,470
There's all sorts of things that have no
idea.

651
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:07,471
You're there no idea that you're 
watching television and there's no no 

652
00:31:07,471 --> 00:31:07,720
idea that you're about to get in your 
car.

653
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:11,170
They don't even know what the fuck a car
is because they don't have the senses to

654
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:12,110
detect it.
Yeah.

655
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:17,180
Why would we assume that we hit the 
fucking bonanza with the senses and 

656
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,180
we've got it all down.

657
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,410
I don't know.
Ridiculous.

658
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,860
It's ridiculous.
There's probably like.

659
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:26,230
I mean,
I don't know what those quantum 

660
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,230
physicist guys are up to.
I think.

661
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,560
Didn't they say that they were up to 
like they believe there's more than 30 

662
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,491
different dimensions now.
We used to think it was 11 and now 

663
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,190
there's some schools of thought that 
it's like 30 dimension.

664
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,950
Fuck knows it could be infinite,
but the point is these could be worlds 

665
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,710
that are in our,
in our midst,

666
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,250
just in a nonphysical sense.
At the same way,

667
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:50,251
ideas are nonphysical the same way.
Imagination is nonphysical the same way.

668
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,760
Like you know,
certain forms of communication.

669
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,130
You're just saying something to someone,
right?

670
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,590
I'm looking at you,
I'm telling you I love you and you're my

671
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:02,200
friend.
It's a nonphysical thing.

672
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,540
It gives you a physical reaction like,
aw,

673
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:06,040
thanks man.
I love you too.

674
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:11,090
Yeah,
we're friends that that's some sort of 

675
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,940
weird nonphysical energy exchange.
It's not just as simple as,

676
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:13,960
you know.
Oh,

677
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:16,090
two people showing affection for each 
other to friends,

678
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:16,990
showing each other.
Love that.

679
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:19,510
There's something else going on too.
That's it.

680
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,500
Yeah.
There's A.

681
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,870
There's an energy exchange.
There's both.

682
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:24,850
People get happy.
When I tell someone I love them,

683
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:27,010
I get happy too.
They get happy.

684
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,270
The whole everybody boosts up.
It's like a very underrated thing.

685
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,920
Telling your friends,
oh,

686
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:35,170
it's shocking.
Like when you're not even supposed to do

687
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:36,550
it,
but like again,

688
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:40,100
because we live,
this is why so much what we live in

689
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:45,100
is like very advanced,
but so much of it as like ridiculously 

690
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,791
barbaric and primitive.
That to tell your friend you love them 

691
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:48,791
can be a shocking

692
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:52,940
Ari shaffir still stammers alright,
I love you dude.

693
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:57,790
He goes,
Oh Joey Diaz,

694
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,820
you know,
I love your dog.

695
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,240
You know,
I,

696
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,030
Joe is like the most loving guy of all 
time.

697
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:04,760
Eddie Bravo is a very loving guy.
Well,

698
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,100
you know,
we know a lot of loving people,

699
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,240
jobs loving.

700
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,910
I think we are love and,
and the,

701
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:15,340
the thing that I've been thinking lately
or just playing around this idea is like

702
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:18,670
what if I have all these different 
versions?

703
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,590
I don't quite know the right way to get 
it out.

704
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:25,591
But like so imagine like directly behind
you is a window that opens up into a 

705
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:31,000
universe where everything is made of 
love,

706
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:36,030
right?
And you're standing in front of the 

707
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,030
window blocking that White,
right?

708
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,150
You're standing in front of the window.
And so like the human condition.

709
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,510
Again,
this is just a thought experiment and 

710
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:45,640
admittedly a very high thought 
experiment that I had,

711
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:47,530
but I can't get it out of my head.
So,

712
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:49,930
and I've heard Rom Dass give different 
versions of this too,

713
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,640
but the.
So the idea is like,

714
00:33:51,641 --> 00:33:54,610
here's this window opening up into this 
alternate.

715
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,650
I don't want even want to call them 
alternate universe.

716
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,710
The actual universe.
I guess it's kind of like Plato's 

717
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,801
allegory of the cave to,
but you're standing in front of this 

718
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:06,730
fucking window blocking the love.
Your ego is right.

719
00:34:06,731 --> 00:34:11,731
Your ego is.
And so the more opaque your ego becomes,

720
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:17,161
the more you allow yourself to become 
less and less of a thing stuck to 

721
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:20,971
anything at all.
The more the light from that universe 

722
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:21,610
shines into this one.
Right?

723
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:24,070
So when you're with someone who's like,
I love you,

724
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:29,370
I really love you.
They've gotten over their ego enough to 

725
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:34,051
let the light from that window.
They just kind of like managed the let 

726
00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:35,380
that light shine through them for a 
second into this dementia,

727
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:40,381
which is why it's so shocking and like 
maybe why babies are so entrancing 

728
00:34:40,381 --> 00:34:41,890
because there's.
There's no ego there.

729
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:46,891
They're just a pure blast of love or 
dogs in the same way or cats or anything

730
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:53,191
that loves you is so incredible because 
what they actually are are like windows 

731
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:58,300
are portals into their reality of what 
our universe is,

732
00:34:58,301 --> 00:35:03,301
which is love and so if you're blocking 
the window then that means that like 

733
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,610
you're mostly living in a world of 
shadows.

734
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:10,620
It's like a person who's like very 
egotistical is like living in a shadowy 

735
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:15,241
world.
Do you spent way too much time at 

736
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:16,480
burning man fry your brand?
I didn't spend enough time Friday,

737
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:16,920
right?

738
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,680
Shotgun windows,
love living things.

739
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,580
Are you starting your cult?
When I joined?

740
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,880
I want to join.
Can we join each other's?

741
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,910
I was just thinking when you were 
talking about dimensions,

742
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,040
like is that an egotistical point of 
view that we have,

743
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,100
that there is like a portal to another 
dimension and is it really just that 

744
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,840
these dimensions are constantly around 
us.

745
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:50,841
We just don't have the ability to access
something like they're there all the 

746
00:35:50,841 --> 00:35:53,511
time.
Maybe that's like legitimately why no 

747
00:35:53,511 --> 00:35:53,940
one like the Fermi paradox,
you know,

748
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:55,880
the Fermi Paradox,
which is um,

749
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,500
if there's so many stars,
so many planets were there,

750
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:00,330
all the aliens,
where's The fucking aliens?

751
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,470
Maybe they don't.
Maybe they get so smart that they never 

752
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,600
do that.
Like maybe no one does that.

753
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,850
Maybe we're,
we're liking this rudimentary thing,

754
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:14,030
like these stupid Fox are still,
they're still making metal dicks and 

755
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,450
trying to fuck the sky shooting rockets 
up into space and they're landing people

756
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:19,890
on is they're still doing it that way.
Like they,

757
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,920
they lack the ability to transcend space
and time and to just pass through other,

758
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,650
through other dimensions.
It's like as a species we're like a 

759
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:30,650
crazy

760
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,750
person and a bus station staring at it's
at his hand and being like,

761
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:38,751
where are the aliens?
I don't see the aliens in my hand when 

762
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:40,680
it's like all he has to do is look up 
and he's surrounded by it

763
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,910
and you know the ultimate mind.
Fuck when it comes to the time travel 

764
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,671
right now,
the ultimate mind fuck when it comes to 

765
00:36:48,671 --> 00:36:52,361
time travel is that one day they are 
going to have a time machine and it's 

766
00:36:52,361 --> 00:36:54,890
probably likely it might take 100,000
years.

767
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,970
Who knows how long.
Think about when was the first tool,

768
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,980
like what was it a couple hundred 
thousand years ago.

769
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:05,981
The data now,
I think it was I think the first tools 

770
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:06,110
or somewhere around and have to look at 
my calendar.

771
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:10,280
I'm not sure.
So from the first tool to now,

772
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,600
a couple hundred thousand years,
I think from now to a time machine,

773
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,780
if we stay alive,
if we don't blow ourselves up,

774
00:37:17,781 --> 00:37:20,090
we don't get hit by an asteroid.
We keep improving.

775
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,400
They're going to figure it out and the 
day they figured out what becomes crazy 

776
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,441
is then all time travel from any point 
in the future to that moment is possible

777
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,690
and to any place else on the scale,
see the ideas that you could only travel

778
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,380
where there's a road so once the time 
machine is invented,

779
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,610
time ceases to be linear and everything 
happens all at once.

780
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,640
Right?
Like literally anyone can come back to 

781
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,941
any point in time and go back and forth.
You could smack someone and then you go 

782
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:59,471
back in time before you smack them and 
kiss them and then go back in time and 

783
00:37:59,471 --> 00:38:00,050
smack them and they'll go back in time 
and kiss him.

784
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:05,850
You could pull their pants down,
you can pull the pants up and do 

785
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,530
whatever the fuck you mean.
You literally could go back and forth in

786
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:09,680
time and it would have never happened 
and you'd be communicating with the same

787
00:38:09,681 --> 00:38:14,681
person once it happens.
So once it does happen and people have 

788
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:14,780
access to it,
which that access,

789
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:19,781
like everything else,
whether it's cell phones or automobiles 

790
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:19,781
or anything,
the accents,

791
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:22,580
the access starts in a limited way or 
very few people could afford it and then

792
00:38:22,581 --> 00:38:27,581
it becomes worldwide.
Did we talk about directed Panspermia 

793
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:29,180
already as it related to time travel?
No,

794
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,510
I don't think so.
So it's like the idea of Panspermia mean

795
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,160
intentional like aliens.
Yes,

796
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,100
exactly.
So the idea is like,

797
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:40,150
okay,
uh,

798
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,390
uh,
I,

799
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,960
so I know this idea where you need the 
road to travel,

800
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:45,760
so we need to build the road.
So what's the.

801
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:49,450
So let's say I do invent the technology 
for a time machine,

802
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,430
which basically means I have point a now
I need to point B,

803
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,040
right?
So the point B A,

804
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,620
I've got to get the,
I've got to get the further out.

805
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:02,860
The point B is I guess the more,
the more,

806
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,450
the more powerful the time machine would
be.

807
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,940
Right?
So this is the idea of direct parents.

808
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,950
Sperming as a means of time.
Travel is assuming you are the super 

809
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:19,711
advanced species than what you do is you
create these genetic,

810
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,700
these,
these,

811
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,650
you create like Dna.
You create a kind of packaged thing that

812
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:28,900
when it lands in the right environment 
that you could live in,

813
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:33,901
has the tendency to evolve into a 
technological civilization that will 

814
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:36,490
build a time machine that is actually 
point b for your time machine.

815
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:41,490
So you released from your planet just 
infinite blasts of this,

816
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:47,101
a DNA,
and you know that when it lands on the 

817
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:47,560
road and then the seed finds the right 
soil,

818
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,740
it's going to grow into a technological 
tree that at the end of its growth is 

819
00:39:53,481 --> 00:39:58,030
going to flower with your point,
be the end of your time machine.

820
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,060
So if you were this kind of interstellar
traveler then for you,

821
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,690
you would send these seeds out into time
and then the moment of time that they've

822
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,840
got to the point where they built a time
machine for you,

823
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,310
it seemed like it happened instantly.
There's your point b.

824
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,580
You don't know what it's going to lead 
to,

825
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,110
but uh,
you know,

826
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:20,650
it's going to be at least a habitable 
planet because you've developed this,

827
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,670
uh,
these,

828
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,360
these,
uh,

829
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,710
genetic machines to only take root and a
planet that you could live on.

830
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:31,711
So what we are are these genetic robots 
that are compelled to build technology 

831
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,320
because we're opening up the point b in 
some kind of interstellar time machine 

832
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,900
and that's what the singularity is.

833
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,900
It's when our creator masters come 
through the time portal that we've 

834
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,110
opened up on this planet and say,
Oh,

835
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:44,920
hi.
You did it.

836
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:47,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

837
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,620
It's pretty interesting as it seems like
it works.

838
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:54,880
Seems so science fictiony though that if
we really got to a point like imagine if

839
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:59,881
our civilization and gotten to a point 
where we could transcend space and time 

840
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:02,590
and travel through the universe and you 
go to any place at any point in time and

841
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:07,250
even drop the seeds of life on a planet.
What does that term that they were going

842
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:08,770
to use on Mars?
Where the,

843
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,350
the uh,
what is it called?

844
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,430
What's the term when you take care of 
that?

845
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,230
For me,
yes,

846
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:19,231
thank you,
and that they had done this like and 

847
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:19,990
then they're gonna come back like the 
silver surfer and fucking like,

848
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,720
I don't think so.
I think we're them.

849
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,570
I think we are them.
I don't think there's anything else.

850
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,750
This is what I think,
and I think this is a ridiculous way to 

851
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,820
look at it too because a,
I don't know and I'm talking shit show,

852
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,400
but I think it is entirely

853
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,030
possible that we're number one,
meaning that we're the first.

854
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,300
We're the first.
We were the first of all these things to

855
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:45,230
achieve this state and that when these 
things achieve this state,

856
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,610
they they either blow themselves up or 
they keep going and they become more and

857
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:54,611
more advanced,
but I don't think it happens very often 

858
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:54,611
and I might be wrong,
I might be totally wrong,

859
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:59,410
but it hasn't happened anywhere near us.
So let's pretend that the galaxy that we

860
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,290
look at right now that we can see.
Let's pretend that's the universe.

861
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:08,291
What if we find out that out of this 
galaxy of hundreds of millions of stars 

862
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:11,500
were the only intelligent life that 
drastically narrows the possibility for 

863
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:13,970
intelligent life everywhere else in the 
universe,

864
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,790
except for the fact that the universe is
infinite,

865
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,390
which means that not only is there 
intelligent life in the universe,

866
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,820
there's a Duncan trussell somewhere in 
the universe.

867
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:27,850
Not only is there a Duncan trussell,
but there's a Duncan trussell that said 

868
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,330
everything that you said in the exact 
same order with every pause,

869
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:34,540
every time you dribbled piss on your 
toilet seat and you all take care of 

870
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,661
that later and you shut the lid.
It did that to the exact t an infinite 

871
00:42:37,661 --> 00:42:39,200
number of times throughout space and 
time,

872
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:44,470
so like not only is there one of you,
but there's an infinite number of use 

873
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:49,121
and then an infinite number of 
possibilities left and right that you 

874
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:51,410
could have gone different paths.
You can take it.

875
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,040
That's how big the universe is.
That's how big infinity is,

876
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,700
but that doesn't mean that anything's 
ever gotten smarter than this.

877
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,520
This is the only thing that we know 
that's gotten this smart.

878
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:07,090
It might be this is the only thing 
that's got the smart because something 

879
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:07,220
had to be the first thing that got this 
smart.

880
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,560
It didn't happen unless it happens 
simultaneously.

881
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:12,170
Like we're saying that it happened with 
a bunch of things,

882
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:14,780
but let's call that thing the same thing
in different places.

883
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,680
It's not like there's a gray alien with 
big black eyes and a giant head,

884
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,830
a little skinny neck that reads your 
mind and flies through magnetic fields.

885
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,150
Right?
We're not talking about that.

886
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,040
We're talking about you and I this 
thing,

887
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,210
this thing might exist an infinite 
number of times all throughout space and

888
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:31,130
time,
but let's call it this one thing.

889
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,490
This one thing.
This might be the first time anything 

890
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:36,490
has gotten as advanced as this one,

891
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,910
so it's like the term,
the simulation as they're using is base 

892
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,860
reality like this is base reality and 
not there.

893
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,870
The statistical probability of this 
being based reality is somehow a.

894
00:43:49,021 --> 00:43:51,750
it's more probable.
This isn't based on reality,

895
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:56,751
but yeah,
it is a probability that this is base 

896
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:57,980
reality and there's also a probability 
that this isn't based on reality like we

897
00:43:57,981 --> 00:43:58,380
did.
You know,

898
00:43:58,381 --> 00:44:01,320
you get to roll the dice on that one.
I like,

899
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,140
I who knows,
I mean it's impossible to,

900
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,460
to really like at this point we can't 
prove that this isn't the default base 

901
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,820
reality that the entire universe is 
experiencing,

902
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:15,120
but my guess would be that no way man,
this is like a.

903
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:17,700
I think it's more realistic that we're 
in a fucking,

904
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:23,710
like a novelty farm,
like some kind of technological novelty 

905
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:23,840
farm.
Like it's like A.

906
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,750
I mean to use human terms were like,
Eh,

907
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:32,900
I mean if you could simulate a universe 
and then create intelligent anything 

908
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,890
Cynthia,
intelligent beings that are particularly

909
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:37,200
cynthiana intelligent beings that 
matched you,

910
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:42,201
your species,
duplicate yourself even and then run 

911
00:44:42,201 --> 00:44:45,171
that duplication an infinite number of 
times in this server mechanism or 

912
00:44:45,171 --> 00:44:46,840
whatever you have in your super 
computer.

913
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,910
And then like,
you know,

914
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:52,911
you just set time to loop a.
It is faster rate as your computer would

915
00:44:55,531 --> 00:45:00,531
let you.
So at night you just like let it run in 

916
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,260
the morning you wake up and it's like,
oh fuck,

917
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:02,130
look,
hemingway.

918
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,120
Huh?
That's interesting.

919
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:08,121
They entire works of Hemingway just got 
generated in my universe simulator by 

920
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:12,591
one of the simulated creatures that I 
had in there and it's a very prosperous 

921
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:16,761
job.
You'd be like a novelty farmer or 

922
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:19,791
something in the same way they've got 
those fucking big coin things that are 

923
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,450
like constantly grinding,
like make bitcoins,

924
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,260
you're fucking making universes and 
inside the universities the universities

925
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:30,261
are making planets and the planets are 
making technology and the technology is 

926
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:34,161
being a.
every single whatever your morning 

927
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:34,170
happens to be.
Whenever you wake up you're like,

928
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,190
oh cool.
We've got,

929
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,890
oh that's interesting.
That's a new form of teleportation.

930
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:42,890
I haven't seen that before.
It's a way to like harvest information 

931
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,750
from a kind of living ai or something 
like that.

932
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,610
You know,
it seems like it'd be a very,

933
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:52,611
a really smart way to kind of like 
gathered data or to create not novelty 

934
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:58,431
events.
I mean just for the pure entertainment 

935
00:45:58,431 --> 00:46:00,471
of it.
Like if you had a way to like access 

936
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:00,720
like five,
like for you it's like,

937
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,700
you know,
right now we download a movie,

938
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:04,350
it takes like two minutes,
five minutes.

939
00:46:04,351 --> 00:46:06,510
What?
Depending on your connection in the same

940
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:11,511
way like you wait,
five minutes in a universe is born and 

941
00:46:11,511 --> 00:46:14,391
dies,
and throughout that it can pick out an 

942
00:46:14,391 --> 00:46:14,391
interesting moments like,
look at this.

943
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,890
Oh look,
here's that moment where in that planet,

944
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:22,210
uh,
the world war three started because 

945
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,250
fucking Russia wanted to like secure 
Syria and we didn't want it to happen.

946
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,730
Wow.
Look at the disaster.

947
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,760
What?
We already have examples of this in a 

948
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,711
rudimentary form and all these new 
universes that are being created in 

949
00:46:33,711 --> 00:46:34,200
these online games.
Piggy back Lee.

950
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:35,700
Yeah.
What are those games,

951
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:36,360
Jamie?
What are the,

952
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:41,361
what are those games called?
Do you know the name of those games 

953
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:41,361
where they create different worlds?
Like,

954
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:45,680
Oh yeah,
it's called procedural generation and 

955
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,910
you're talking about the no man's sky.
The game that everyone got angry about 

956
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:48,960
what they get angry about it.
Well,

957
00:46:48,961 --> 00:46:53,961
they got angry about it because the,
the summation of the anger is just 

958
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:56,940
because something is gigantic doesn't 
mean it's entertaining.

959
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:59,190
Right?
And so you ended up getting in this kind

960
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:04,191
of feedback loop because if you're going
to procedurally generate and infinite a 

961
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,430
year or a semi infinite universe with 
all these different planets and stuff,

962
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,940
then that means you need an ai that you 
can procedurally generate that's also 

963
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,140
going to procedurally generate,
you know,

964
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,800
what we consider to be a game like,
you know,

965
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:19,560
interesting storylines and things to do.

966
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,120
It's just,
you're just creating things.

967
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:21,750
Right,
right.

968
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:24,120
Well that's one part.
The other part that people get mad about

969
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:27,660
is the apparently not even apparently 
you can see like,

970
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,980
people get so mad.
God May,

971
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:34,981
you never piss off the gaming community 
that's just like don't fuck with them 

972
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:40,621
man,
because they swarm in and it's vicious 

973
00:47:40,621 --> 00:47:43,291
and brutal.
Like I was playing the game and really 

974
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:44,170
enjoying it for at least a week and a 
half,

975
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:46,270
two weeks.
And I go on like Reddit,

976
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:48,730
no man's sky and read the comments and 
I'd be like,

977
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,250
God,
you guys are fucking dicks.

978
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:52,480
This game.
Super Fun.

979
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:57,481
I'm on the best fucking time of my life.
I'm never going to play this again to 

980
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:58,120
you out of it.
No,

981
00:47:58,121 --> 00:48:00,250
I know in the game it just suddenly it's
like,

982
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:01,630
wait,
it got boring,

983
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,340
it got boring and it got,
you know,

984
00:48:03,341 --> 00:48:04,900
for me it got boring for other people.

985
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,390
I know some people were saying you guys 
are dicks.

986
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,160
When I was enjoying it,
reading their critique,

987
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:15,180
I get it,
but really it was like reading the 

988
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,071
critique of gourmet chefs far more 
familiar with where gaming is at.

989
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:22,170
You know,
these are people who play games all the 

990
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:22,170
time and know it and like have very high
expectations.

991
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,890
But anyway,
the point is yes,

992
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,040
it procedurally generates this 
incredible universe but it ends up 

993
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,760
getting kind of boring or something like
that.

994
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:35,761
But yeah,
procedurally generate like we are in a 

995
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:37,801
procedurally generated universe that is 
producing novelty events which may be in

996
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:44,461
the universe that we are being 
procedurally generated out of as a form 

997
00:48:44,461 --> 00:48:48,721
of currency or a form of entertainment 
or a form of something we don't even 

998
00:48:48,721 --> 00:48:52,300
understand yet.
But what could all I know is if I.

999
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:57,301
If there was a game called universe 
creator run your computer and your 

1000
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:02,340
universe will at some point generate 
sentience wife that at some point we'll 

1001
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:07,621
start generating technology that at some
point you'll be able to like watch and 

1002
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:11,140
possibly using your own dimension.
Then I will be running that.

1003
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:16,141
If I was a company,
I would definitely be running that 

1004
00:49:16,141 --> 00:49:19,231
software for sure.
I would want that to exist just for pure

1005
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:24,301
capitalism.
What's better than like having a never 

1006
00:49:24,301 --> 00:49:26,881
ending stream of inventions coming from 
your universe simulator that you could 

1007
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:27,460
then market in this dimension.

1008
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,800
I think there's something weird that we 
do to where we look at things that we 

1009
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,041
can generate with a computer versus 
things that sort of exist in the real 

1010
00:49:36,111 --> 00:49:39,140
world and we look at them as coming from
different sources.

1011
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:44,770
Something that man makes versus 
something that just happens and because 

1012
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:48,110
of we look at it from different sources.
I don't think we recognize that.

1013
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:53,111
It's kind of the same thing.
Like there's a long process from a star 

1014
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:59,140
exploding to a human being being born,
but they're all connected.

1015
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,530
But star exploding is necessary for the 
development of.

1016
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:07,910
Of the carbon based life form on the 
earth.

1017
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:10,010
Right?
So this,

1018
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:14,480
the elements that make us the star had a
blow up,

1019
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:18,920
like there's this long,
but we don't think of that as like being

1020
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:23,921
made because it takes too long.
We decided we're going to call it 

1021
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:25,100
evolution or natural selection.

1022
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:30,110
Yes,
but by defining of these things in that 

1023
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,341
way we've.
We've failed to look at the thing for 

1024
00:50:33,341 --> 00:50:37,121
what the thing is with.
The thing is forget about whether 

1025
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:38,000
evolutions real or creation of Israel.
That's nonsense.

1026
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,730
That doesn't mean anything like whatever
is doing it,

1027
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:45,820
it's doing it and it's doing it from a 
star blowing up to a person talking 

1028
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:50,240
about a star billowing up to his friend.
Yeah,

1029
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:51,220
like right now.
Yeah,

1030
00:50:51,221 --> 00:50:52,130
that's right.
This,

1031
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:56,630
this is all made like whatever you've 
made as been made by this process.

1032
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:01,550
Any great painter and the architect who 
built the most incredible buildings,

1033
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:06,910
you were made.
This whole thing is made right and 

1034
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:11,201
you're making things too,
but those things aren't any more 

1035
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,710
significant than trees that all this.
The whole thing is nuts.

1036
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,270
The whole thing is somehow or another 
getting more and more complex,

1037
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,510
more and more involved,
more and more aware,

1038
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:24,520
faster information sharing between the 
things that matter,

1039
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,380
things making more and crazier and 
better things.

1040
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,610
But all of these things made by a star 
explosion,

1041
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,110
right?
Yeah.

1042
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:38,250
Are,
I guess like if you want to get 

1043
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:38,250
technical,
the.

1044
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:41,540
So when you say made it starts it and 
employee.

1045
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,080
Okay.
Right.

1046
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:42,810
So you,
I mean,

1047
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,790
it's a process,
right?

1048
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,340
I mean,
man,

1049
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:46,960
I think this,
I think we're probably like,

1050
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:47,720
Bro,
we're,

1051
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,610
I really do think that whatever this is 
is like,

1052
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,440
is literally made in the sense of like a
maker.

1053
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,270
Like it was really think there's a 
maker.

1054
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,360
I think it was individual,
an individual.

1055
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,850
I don't think it's an individual,
but,

1056
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:06,750
and I don't think it's force.
I think it's the uh,

1057
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:07,870
yeah,
uh,

1058
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,910
create something that's very creative 
and I think that it's.

1059
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:15,380
Or it's a source of creativity and I 
think that it's,

1060
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,440
you know,
I mean I'm a fuck it.

1061
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,680
I'll say I'm a theist man.
Like I pray,

1062
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:26,700
I area sounds.
Have you punching?

1063
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,780
I wake up,
talk to them.

1064
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:31,930
I've fucking,
look,

1065
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,980
I,
I just love to pray and like when my 

1066
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,010
life gets better,
when I pray and I just love it.

1067
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:38,670
It,
it's,

1068
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,930
it's,
I mean I fucking,

1069
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:40,760
I,
you know me,

1070
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:44,060
I don't have to know you too.
So I enjoy.

1071
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,230
So when I sit.
So when you say,

1072
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:46,700
well,
what is it an individual?

1073
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,840
I think it's like there's lots of 
different ways of saying it in every 

1074
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,680
single way of saying it falls short of 
what it is.

1075
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,940
Now.
There's A.

1076
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,310
I keep telling you about this guy,
man and I.

1077
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:01,970
One day I hope you pick them up.
There's a Buddhist teacher named Chogyam

1078
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,970
Trungpa who says,
so I'll like getting in an argument with

1079
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:08,450
Chogyam Trungpa,
like if he heard me spew that bullshit,

1080
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:12,620
what he would say his weight.
So when I ask you,

1081
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:15,170
is it an individual?
Is it a thing?

1082
00:53:15,171 --> 00:53:16,010
Is it a person?

1083
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,330
And you say,
I don't know man.

1084
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:22,331
There's no words for it.
Then at that moment what you've done is 

1085
00:53:22,331 --> 00:53:26,891
you've taken your confusion and you've 
put it on an altar and you started 

1086
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:28,740
worshiping it as though it were your 
God.

1087
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:33,600
Your ability to not articulate the thing
is not an indication of the existence of

1088
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:38,601
a thing,
but it's more the indication of your 

1089
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:41,150
laziness because you want to like deify 
your a confused,

1090
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:45,720
passionate emptiness.
It's something like that.

1091
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:47,640
There's a great for it.
And one of his books that is,

1092
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,320
that's a great quote,
echoed through my fucking ever since I 

1093
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,570
changed passionate emptiness exactly 
years ago,

1094
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,150
Courtney love song,
confused,

1095
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:01,650
passionate emptiness.
But,

1096
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,240
uh,
so that being said,

1097
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,160
I still,
uh,

1098
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:05,310
uh,
the,

1099
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:10,311
the,
I think you should do experiments in 

1100
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:13,791
reaching out to the transcendent as 
though it were possibly an embodied 

1101
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:19,431
thing that was a lot smarter than you.
And if the result of the experiment is 

1102
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:24,621
nothing,
if you just feel embarrassed or dumb or 

1103
00:54:24,621 --> 00:54:24,621
you're like,
why the fuck am I praying?

1104
00:54:24,621 --> 00:54:25,980
Why there's nothing,
then who cares?

1105
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:30,990
You lose nothing.
But if the results of the experiment is 

1106
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,171
even as a placebo effect,
you begin to experience a shift in your 

1107
00:54:33,171 --> 00:54:37,290
subjective reality.
Then I think it's worth continuing those

1108
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:40,290
experiments and seeing like how it 
unfolds.

1109
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,870
Well,
let's take away that definition,

1110
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,440
the placebo effect,
because if you have in some way decided 

1111
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,490
to meditate towards,
um,

1112
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:56,500
towards the objective of communicating 
with the great love that runs the 

1113
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,950
universe and somehow know that benefits 
you,

1114
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,830
that's not a placebo factor.
Right?

1115
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:04,860
That's,
that's a shift in your consciousness 

1116
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,230
whether or not it's validated by the 
existence of the thing.

1117
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,490
Yeah.
It doesn't matter.

1118
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:12,580
It's still a shift in your consciousness
through what appears to be a decision 

1119
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,770
appears to be a decision that you've 
made to gravitate towards God.

1120
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,630
Yeah.
Gravitate towards love.

1121
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,320
Yeah.
No,

1122
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:23,950
I've always had the problem whenever 
people talk about intelligent design or 

1123
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,180
a thing or a deity and this is my own 
problem,

1124
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,980
I automatically think of instead of the 
universe,

1125
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:34,460
like says that there's a universe and 
then there's this thing over here,

1126
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,550
like right next to the universe,
it's like,

1127
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:41,580
oh,
I'm just gonna sit here and make the 

1128
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:41,580
universe.

1129
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:41,840
It's a stupid way that I look at it.
It's completely my own.

1130
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,320
Like you can grow up or you can just 
sort of form these ideas in your head 

1131
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:54,850
about what a deity is and then those 
ideas can be little prisons when you try

1132
00:55:55,671 --> 00:56:00,671
to define the universe.
So my defining the universe as the 

1133
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:03,761
universe being this thing that this 
thing is created and it's sitting over 

1134
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:05,390
here in this other thing like is it in 
the universe?

1135
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,700
It does it,
does it build it from the universe?

1136
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,480
Like where is it?
Is it next door?

1137
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,560
Have a condo next to the universe.
Like what does it have?

1138
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:15,090
Like how is.
Is it a part of the universe?

1139
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:20,260
Is it or is it that the idea of an 
individual is the wrong way to look at 

1140
00:56:23,471 --> 00:56:28,471
it.
That if you look at all the life on 

1141
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:28,471
earth,
right?

1142
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:32,430
Yeah.
It seems that it was a lot of things in 

1143
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:32,430
nature that are fractal,
right?

1144
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:36,290
Insurance exists pretty much everywhere 
you look and when they start looking at 

1145
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:41,010
subatomic particles and you realize how 
deep they can go and how small they can 

1146
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,630
measure things and then you look at the 
size of the universe itself.

1147
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:48,631
You look at the size of galaxies and 
black holes and just the vastness of 

1148
00:56:48,631 --> 00:56:52,771
space and the ability to measure.
I think they measure 13 point something 

1149
00:56:52,771 --> 00:56:54,670
billion,
light years since the big bang.

1150
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,350
All that madness,
all that craziness that they're there.

1151
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:03,220
They're trying to.
I think by looking all that and all that

1152
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:07,510
stuff,
by looking at the vastness of all this,

1153
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:12,420
we.
We define it in this way where there's a

1154
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:17,080
dunkin over here and there's an aunt 
over there and there's a,

1155
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:22,250
you know another animal over here,
but inside of all of us are a bunch of 

1156
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,720
different animals that are all little 
tiny ecosystems.

1157
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,380
Right?
Inside every person.

1158
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:30,970
There's not a single individual life 
form that's a person.

1159
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:35,110
Every person requires all this life 
inside of it.

1160
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,320
He lie living in your body and all sorts
of gut flora,

1161
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:43,530
all sorts of things that are not you,
but there are you because you are a 

1162
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:47,560
system or a system just like your 
neighborhood's a system.

1163
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:52,710
Just like the rain forest is the system.
I'm sure all the people in the rain 

1164
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:56,841
forest that are hunting with bows and 
arrows and really looking out for 

1165
00:57:56,841 --> 00:58:01,501
Jaguars,
I'm sure they don't think of themselves 

1166
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:01,501
as a system,
but there are life system.

1167
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:06,031
That's how life balances itself out both
in your gut and in the jungle and in the

1168
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:11,620
mountains of Montana and in the savannas
of Africa.

1169
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:16,890
These are all system life systems and 
our vision of life systems is that this 

1170
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:19,930
life system is contained to this planet.

1171
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:21,940
This is it,
but this planet,

1172
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:27,300
everything on this planet,
right with the life system that's 

1173
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,510
contained on this planet is all bathed 
in oxygen,

1174
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:31,240
right?
It's all these gases and the elimination

1175
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:36,241
of those gases does not mean that you're
not connected to all the other things 

1176
00:58:36,241 --> 00:58:38,050
that don't have those gases.
You take those gases away,

1177
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:41,410
you go into space itself.
You're still fucking connected to that.

1178
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:46,650
You're still a soup.
You're a part of an infinite soup of 

1179
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:50,011
space and you just like a subatomic 
particle that blinks in and out of 

1180
00:58:50,011 --> 00:58:52,630
existence that they can measure.
It's moving and it's not moving.

1181
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:57,631
It's there and it's gone.
Just how small the life form of a planet

1182
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:02,710
is in comparison to the mass of the 
universe itself,

1183
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,430
which might very well be just like every
other fractal.

1184
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:09,910
The bigger you get,
the more it represents the same patterns

1185
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:12,190
over and over again in larger scales.
That's right.

1186
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,880
The entire planet could be a subatomic 
particle particle in the cell of an 

1187
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:21,980
organism that lives on another planet.
Your entire

1188
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,280
universe itself,
or if you want even go deeper into it.

1189
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:29,380
Could the entire universe could be some 
kind of like a synaptic pulse in the 

1190
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:35,090
brain of an entity just having a dream 
like so,

1191
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:39,110
which is the synaptic pulse of another 
entity,

1192
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,200
but it's also having a dream and it's 
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger 

1193
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:44,200
and there's no end.
This is the,

1194
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:44,280
uh,
this,

1195
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,750
this is the one of the first and the 
emerald tablet.

1196
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,670
This chemical,
you've seen that.

1197
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:50,690
We've probably talked about it.
Oh,

1198
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:53,630
it's the emerald tablet.
The emerald tablet.

1199
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,460
The book.
It's the,

1200
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:59,480
it's like this out chemical text that's 
like this super condensed.

1201
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,230
A really old.
Yeah.

1202
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:08,231
It's really fucking old man.
And then I'm going to try to say that 

1203
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:10,991
it's the,
it's got a great name that I always say 

1204
01:00:10,991 --> 01:00:11,120
it wrong and I always get corrected.
And so I'll say it wrong again.

1205
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,850
The Emerald Tablet,
um,

1206
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,440
uh,
there it is of Hermes trimester or 

1207
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:19,440
something.
But if you open it up,

1208
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,160
open up the emerald tablet and then 
hopefully we can see what it says on it 

1209
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,040
because it's like a,
there it is.

1210
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:26,600
Okay.
What is the first one?

1211
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:27,770
Say,
okay.

1212
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:30,530
To certain with error.
Certainly most true.

1213
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:35,620
So you just said number two,
that which is below is like that which 

1214
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,220
is above and that which is above is like
that which is below,

1215
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:41,000
um,
to do the miracles of only one thing.

1216
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:45,440
And as all things have been in arose 
from one by the mediation of one.

1217
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,710
So all things have their birth from this
one thing by adaptation.

1218
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,660
So anyway,
it's like,

1219
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,820
so it's all the shit that we were just 
talking about.

1220
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:54,290
Somebody had already figured it out.
Well,

1221
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:55,640
it's so,
yeah,

1222
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:56,930
it's like the,
it's the,

1223
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:02,510
it's evidence that other people have 
been as high as we are enough to put it 

1224
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:02,660
in a tablet.

1225
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,640
Dude,
they didn't have podcasts.

1226
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:09,641
They used to have to carve shit and 
tablets a lot of work and write that 

1227
01:01:09,641 --> 01:01:11,090
down.
We got to find some emerald man.

1228
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,560
If you had to write all that on bark.
Yeah,

1229
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:14,630
a lot of work.
Yeah,

1230
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:16,250
but this is kind of the,
like the,

1231
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,820
all these chemical ideas.
I guess it's like,

1232
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:23,900
it only makes sense that if we see these
fractals all throughout nature,

1233
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:29,140
we can observe them here that are ideas 
that we can only observe subatomic 

1234
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,980
particles that that's the whole 
universe.

1235
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,890
Like it's probably infinitely smaller 
than that by the way.

1236
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:38,891
Here's what's cool about that.
Is that as a translation by Isaac 

1237
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:38,891
Newton?
Yeah.

1238
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:40,580
So.
And he was really into this shit man.

1239
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:44,870
Like Newton was fucking nuts.
Like he was doing was asexual too,

1240
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:46,790
right?
I think he was like these.

1241
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,040
I don't want to say because he's like,
it's A.

1242
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,900
I don't know if he's a sexual.
If he was.

1243
01:01:50,901 --> 01:01:55,901
I think a lot of these guys,
they were fucking around with mercury a 

1244
01:01:55,901 --> 01:01:57,310
lot and like it was like messing with 
their heads like,

1245
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,070
oh,
I'm sure.

1246
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:58,880
Yeah,
but,

1247
01:01:58,881 --> 01:01:59,570
uh,
I don't know.

1248
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:00,320
God,
forgive me,

1249
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:01,270
everyone out there,
I don't,

1250
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,610
but go to Newton and the occult.
Go Back and look at the occult section.

1251
01:02:04,611 --> 01:02:09,611
It's really interesting.
I don't think a lot of people are aware 

1252
01:02:09,611 --> 01:02:09,980
of the fact that Newton was deeply into 
the occult.

1253
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,580
Like,
yeah,

1254
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,840
yeah.
A lot of those scientists in the deep 

1255
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,841
thinkers back then were,
they were checking on all sorts of 

1256
01:02:19,841 --> 01:02:19,841
different things.
Well,

1257
01:02:19,841 --> 01:02:20,250
I mean,
checking

1258
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,100
on it is one way to put it,
another way to put it is like,

1259
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,400
it may be that some of these people 
figured out ways to directly communicate

1260
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:30,740
with this intelligence that I,
that,

1261
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,610
that I certainly believe in and there's 
through mercury poisoning me.

1262
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,330
Yeah.
Maybe mercury is the way to,

1263
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,390
you know,
it's fecal bacteria,

1264
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:41,440
personal life,
because you were showing his personal 

1265
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,181
life stuff there.
I want to make sure I'm right because I 

1266
01:02:43,181 --> 01:02:45,551
said that he was asexual.
I read some weirdness about the way he 

1267
01:02:45,551 --> 01:02:47,060
viewed sex and wasn't a Christian as 
well.

1268
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:52,900
A pretty hardcore Christian.
I don't know what kind of Christian he 

1269
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:52,930
was like that's a.
that's a whole lot.

1270
01:02:52,931 --> 01:02:54,460
I mean Christians and big words

1271
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,720
never married.
Although he was once.

1272
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,030
What does it say?
Once claimed that he is.

1273
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:02,060
Oh,
although it was once it was claimed that

1274
01:03:02,061 --> 01:03:04,040
he was engaged.
Newton never married.

1275
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:09,390
The widespread belief that he had died 
of a virgin has been commented on by 

1276
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:13,210
writers such as mathematician,
Charles Hudson,

1277
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,350
probably a hater economist.
John Maynard Keynes,

1278
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:20,350
keens hater and physicist.
Carl Sagan.

1279
01:03:20,351 --> 01:03:21,190
How dare you,
Carl?

1280
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,980
Well just said that.
I just said fuck me.

1281
01:03:23,981 --> 01:03:26,730
You did say why?
Why are you talking shit about nudity?

1282
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:31,790
Not even talking shit about.
I'm just fascinated by individuals that 

1283
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,870
are brilliant beyond beyond the norm.
Like Tesla who was also like,

1284
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,350
yeah,
a weird guy sexually fell in love with a

1285
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:42,351
pigeon,
you know the whole deal and that was 

1286
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:43,290
completely out of his mind,
but yet insanely brilliant.

1287
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:47,220
Beyond insanely brilliant.
I think that's what happens is like what

1288
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:49,740
we in by the way we call them out of 
their minds,

1289
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,420
you know,
where meanwhile like,

1290
01:03:51,421 --> 01:03:53,550
what are we doing that makes any fucking
sense?

1291
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,540
Well,
yeah,

1292
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:56,760
they're crazy.
I got it all figured out.

1293
01:03:56,761 --> 01:04:01,761
Look what I'm doing.
I'm sitting in a fucking podcast studio 

1294
01:04:01,761 --> 01:04:05,241
talking about the infinite universe.
It's like we're all like the idea that 

1295
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:09,470
any,
there is a kind of a pattern that's 

1296
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:09,470
like,
oh yeah,

1297
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,540
that's the same pattern right there.
Well,

1298
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:14,520
I think these people,
they uh,

1299
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,850
they do make contact and I think,
you know,

1300
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,420
we talk about like,
uh,

1301
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,990
uh,
one of my favorite,

1302
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,640
I think you told me this,
Joe,

1303
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:28,641
one of my favorite,
a Ufo conspiracy theories is that 

1304
01:04:28,641 --> 01:04:32,811
Roswell was a real alien crash and that 
we can chart the evolution of technology

1305
01:04:34,321 --> 01:04:37,590
from the Roswell alien crash.
That technology is actually some kind of

1306
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:42,591
alien virus that came in through what 
Roswell and is now spreading through art

1307
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,820
through history.
Now.

1308
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:50,410
That's the most popular conspiracy 
theory when it comes to the creation of 

1309
01:04:51,651 --> 01:04:54,290
like the transistor at Bell 
Laboratories,

1310
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:59,291
which is in New Jersey.
There's an air force base outside of 

1311
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:02,741
bell laboratories and bell laboratories 
is supposed to be where they examined 

1312
01:05:02,741 --> 01:05:06,731
all the parts that they took from grant 
from the Ufo and they flew it to Wright 

1313
01:05:06,731 --> 01:05:08,810
Patterson air force base and then they 
took all the stuff out of it.

1314
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,460
It's,
it's so fantastic,

1315
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:15,600
dude.
One of the many things I love about you 

1316
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,921
man,
as you are like the library of Congress 

1317
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:20,111
for this stuff.
Whereas in my mind it's just like a 

1318
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:22,381
murky swamp when I try to remember.
It's like if I pull you can you can in 

1319
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:26,800
detail expound on these things you like 
photographically memorize them.

1320
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:31,801
I think it's really cool and so 
therefore I know that you were the one 

1321
01:05:31,801 --> 01:05:32,020
who told me this and I think about it a 
lot.

1322
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:37,021
It's a really cool idea,
but I think it's funny because for us 

1323
01:05:37,021 --> 01:05:37,021
we're like,
okay,

1324
01:05:37,021 --> 01:05:41,670
the way we would get technologies by a 
metal craft shooting into the earth and 

1325
01:05:41,891 --> 01:05:43,540
then we're going to take that and make 
technology.

1326
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:48,541
Whereas I think the real alien 
encounters that happen throughout 

1327
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:50,740
history,
the Ufo encounters a Ufo for,

1328
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,930
for,
for lack of a better word,

1329
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:57,990
a Ufo flies through the consciousness of
Isaac Newton and Isaac Newton.

1330
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:04,110
Tesla,
all of the great inventors have this 

1331
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:04,450
spontaneous idea what they're like,
wait,

1332
01:06:04,451 --> 01:06:04,990
what?
Wait,

1333
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:10,380
wait,
and so the alien technology is actually 

1334
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,530
not something that is necessarily has to
be matter,

1335
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:16,740
but starts as a thought form that then 
gets sort of produced through the 

1336
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:22,060
spinner rack of the particular inventor 
that like allows it to come through 

1337
01:06:22,181 --> 01:06:22,840
them.
You know

1338
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,870
this very thing in an interview today,
the exact thing.

1339
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:31,890
Cool.
Because we were talking about ideas 

1340
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:35,250
possibly being a life form or ideas 
being a form of like creativity and 

1341
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:41,461
ideas being a form of life that forces 
the change on an environment.

1342
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:45,360
Forces the change in,
in,

1343
01:06:45,361 --> 01:06:48,730
in a civilization come from ideas,
the ideas.

1344
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,070
Creativity is responsible for 
everything,

1345
01:06:51,071 --> 01:06:53,560
including this microphone,
the Internet connection,

1346
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,630
the building we're in,
everything we're wearing,

1347
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:00,900
everything.
The car you drove to get or all of it 

1348
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:01,630
comes from the imagination,
from ideas from creativity,

1349
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:06,400
and the initial burst of imagination 
comes from where we don't know.

1350
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:11,401
It might be a life form,
it might be as much of a life form as a 

1351
01:07:11,401 --> 01:07:11,401
physical thing,
like,

1352
01:07:11,401 --> 01:07:11,890
like a person

1353
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,700
or it might be the uh,
okay.

1354
01:07:13,701 --> 01:07:17,410
So like a eric,
I don't know,

1355
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,460
you see in the,
it's never actually happened to me,

1356
01:07:19,461 --> 01:07:24,461
but like a plane flies too low and like 
the fucking trees or like when a 

1357
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:25,070
helicopter is landing,
the trees blow.

1358
01:07:25,071 --> 01:07:27,560
People have to hold their hands over 
their ears.

1359
01:07:27,561 --> 01:07:32,561
Right?
So maybe when these like transcendent 

1360
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:32,810
objects enter into our time space 
continuum,

1361
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:38,290
shit,
tons of people start having the very 

1362
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:40,451
same idea or different,
like brilliant ideas that are actually 

1363
01:07:40,451 --> 01:07:40,451
just the,
uh,

1364
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:45,550
the sort of impact that this craft as it
passes through our planet or passes near

1365
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:50,180
us or whatever that means from the 
dimension that they're in.

1366
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:55,450
Maybe that's the impact that it has on 
our consciousness is the sudden 

1367
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:58,811
origination of these incredible ideas 
that end up creating massive shifts in 

1368
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:04,541
our society that that that's because if 
you look at like Tesla where he got his 

1369
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:08,690
ideas and I don't know about Newton,
but a lot of great inventors there.

1370
01:08:08,691 --> 01:08:13,691
It's not like their ideas came as they 
were sitting at the whiteboard 

1371
01:08:13,691 --> 01:08:15,020
calculating and then they had a Eureka 
moment,

1372
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:16,760
like they had dreams

1373
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:21,850
with Tusla literally was claiming that 
he was getting some information from 

1374
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:21,850
space.
Yeah.

1375
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,220
He thought he was getting information 
from space.

1376
01:08:24,221 --> 01:08:25,440
That's right.
Yeah.

1377
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,210
I think.
I think you're onto something John Lilly

1378
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:34,240
too,
but he was so fucked up all the time 

1379
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,700
though because he knows space lily was 
shooting intramuscular ketamine and then

1380
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:40,040
climbing into an isolation tank all the 
time.

1381
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,140
LSD,
isolation,

1382
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:44,960
attending the academy and injections.
That was towards the end like,

1383
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:45,560
eh.
I think.

1384
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,700
I think in the beginning it was LSD.
It was LSD and there was like a.

1385
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:54,701
and it was like.
I think he got to the point where he 

1386
01:08:54,701 --> 01:08:58,301
recognized that maybe his physical body 
was actually getting in the way of of 

1387
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:03,220
what he actually was,
so we just sort of wanted to mountain 

1388
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:03,220
the nothingness and it was sort of 
troubled by this thing.

1389
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,450
I've got to keep coming back to this 
fucking day.

1390
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:11,330
He's ready to get out of it.
Not as a suicidal way,

1391
01:09:11,331 --> 01:09:15,690
but just like the way that a a something
that has molded has to discard.

1392
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,000
He so far removed,
I don't want to say gone because I don't

1393
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:26,021
think he's wrong,
but he was so far removed from the 

1394
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:30,911
average human being in terms of like how
bizarre his paths of thinking had gone 

1395
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:37,930
and what he was trying to accomplish.
He was trying to mean he's a pioneer 

1396
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:38,510
interspecies communication with 
dolphins,

1397
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,720
dolphins high on acid.
He would get high on acid.

1398
01:09:41,721 --> 01:09:43,930
He could eat me wandering asset to 
dolphins.

1399
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:48,940
I didn't know that part of the story.
Do you know that his research on 

1400
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,960
dolphins was all canceled because the 
girl who was a scientist was jerking the

1401
01:09:50,961 --> 01:09:54,320
dolphin off.
That got his research cancel.

1402
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:59,321
Yeah.
That was one of the things that got the 

1403
01:09:59,321 --> 01:09:59,321
the project where she was living with a 
dolphin.

1404
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:03,970
I like this story you're telling me is 
it's the story of the fucking luckiest 

1405
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:04,290
dolphin,
like,

1406
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,080
you know what I mean?
Like not only.

1407
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,200
I'm saying if you get caught as a 
dolphin,

1408
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:14,201
it's not great,
but if you are going to get caught by 

1409
01:10:14,201 --> 01:10:15,971
the monkeys and you don't end,
you end up in a place where they kept 

1410
01:10:15,971 --> 01:10:18,970
giving you acid and jerking you.
US.

1411
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,900
The sounds off makes when you drug them 
off.

1412
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,330
Can you imagine if that Dolphin got into
conversation with a seaworld dolphin and

1413
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:29,810
they're like,
wait,

1414
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:32,120
what?
Wait,

1415
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,410
what?
You jerked off dude,

1416
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:40,010
I'll do flips for fat kids.
Fuck this man.

1417
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,950
Fuck this Gig.
She jerked you off.

1418
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:43,820
How often?
Everyday.

1419
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:45,270
Everyday.
Yeah,

1420
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,480
and she kind of likes it.
I don't have look good.

1421
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:52,510
I don't understand how that got his 
experiments cancel because it's pleasure

1422
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:56,950
because we're so puritanical.
We like through a scientist.

1423
01:10:56,951 --> 01:10:58,340
It's not.
It's makes sense.

1424
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,610
This dolphin was severely distracted.
It was horny all the time.

1425
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:06,880
She would jerk the dolphin off,
the dolphin could relax and then they 

1426
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:07,850
will do it to work,
but the dolphin was always horny because

1427
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,960
dolphins,
like a kid,

1428
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,190
you know,
dolphins,

1429
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:11,630
like a,
an 18 year old kid,

1430
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,610
18 year old kid with a boner.
It's just so distracted.

1431
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:19,110
Good luck trying to get them to do work.
So she just thought rationally.

1432
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,730
First of all,
she's a scientist.

1433
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:25,731
She didn't think there was anything 
wrong with sex and she definitely 

1434
01:11:25,731 --> 01:11:29,181
realized that there was a problem in her
research where this dolphin is dealing 

1435
01:11:29,181 --> 01:11:32,961
with too much desire to get rid of them.
So she's whacked him off,

1436
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,430
whacked him off,
and got back to work.

1437
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:39,440
That's a very smart and pragmatic way of
looking at it.

1438
01:11:39,441 --> 01:11:41,040
The problem is she told people about it,

1439
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,170
like over cocktails,
you know,

1440
01:11:44,171 --> 01:11:45,980
is there a fucking boyfriend?
He ruined it.

1441
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,220
He was like.
So anyway,

1442
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,590
I jerked off.
What was the Dolphin's name?

1443
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:51,820
It's a good question.
I bet.

1444
01:11:51,821 --> 01:11:55,810
Like when he came to visit her at work,
like he started getting five,

1445
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:59,080
she was choking off the dolphin like it 
was looking at him.

1446
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:03,580
Weird.
No kidding.

1447
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,590
Right.
Fucking.

1448
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,300
Imagine what a.
The other thing is the dolphins,

1449
01:12:09,301 --> 01:12:11,550
they were trying to get dolphins to say 
human words.

1450
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:12,720
Yeah.
But they can't.

1451
01:12:12,721 --> 01:12:15,750
They don't have any lips so they can't 
make those sounds.

1452
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:18,840
So they would do their best to make 
something close to it,

1453
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,930
but you know,
they have those high piercing,

1454
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,420
shrieking sort of sounds that they can 
make.

1455
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,650
Do you know man,
that's the.

1456
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:25,980
She's

1457
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,240
even the thing.
Here's what would have happened.

1458
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:31,070
If they could have gotten the dolphin to
talk,

1459
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:36,430
they would have canceled it because the 
only thing you would say is off again 

1460
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:37,070
off again.
Wait,

1461
01:12:37,071 --> 01:12:40,910
what did it say?
Have you seen the video?

1462
01:12:40,911 --> 01:12:45,911
I don't mean to change the study.
Have you seen the video of the cro 

1463
01:12:45,911 --> 01:12:45,911
telling someone,
fuck,

1464
01:12:45,911 --> 01:12:46,820
you know,
could do you know that video if you look

1465
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:49,070
at is so fucking funny man.
Like this guy,

1466
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:51,840
this guy,
it's like he doesn't insult the cro.

1467
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:56,950
The Cro really like snarks him.
I hope you can find a cro literally 

1468
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:56,950
says,
fuck,

1469
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:57,500
look at this.
Watch this.

1470
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:04,230
Hello?
Hello.

1471
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:19,910
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

1472
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:28,720
I don't hear anything.
Watch over.

1473
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:30,430
Got The big head.

1474
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:41,870
Whoa.
It's like insult his beak and he's like,

1475
01:13:41,871 --> 01:13:42,730
fuck cute.

1476
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:46,180
Whoa.
See if it was any other animal.

1477
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:46,840
I'd go,
no,

1478
01:13:46,841 --> 01:13:47,710
what?
Right.

1479
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,900
But they're so goddamn smart.
Yeah.

1480
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,300
Yeah.
You didn't want like fuck year.

1481
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,140
Make Fun of my fucking beat.
Did you ever see the raven that starts a

1482
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:58,810
fight between two cats?
No.

1483
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:00,850
Dude,
can we see the Nepalese?

1484
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:03,160
I put it up on my instagram.
This is some crazy shit.

1485
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:07,360
Some raven flies over to Kat Fox with 
him a little bit.

1486
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:08,900
The cat tries to get away from,
um,

1487
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:14,100
the cat likes.
Turns around real quick and the raven 

1488
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,501
jumps away and then the raven flies over
to another cat is on another rooftop 

1489
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:16,501
sweat.
How he does this.

1490
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:21,660
He literally starts a fight between 
these two just hanging out like,

1491
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,200
down.
Damn fucking bored.

1492
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,800
So he flies over there and fucking,
I guess it's not a raven,

1493
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:29,970
is that a raven?
The Crow Crow.

1494
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,830
But why is it looked wide?

1495
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:34,710
Is that the reflection of the sun on him
and now could be at.

1496
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:36,040
I don't know what happened.
Anyway,

1497
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:41,160
so he flies over there.
He gets near the cat and he irritates 

1498
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:41,620
the cat and then he flies over.
It,

1499
01:14:41,621 --> 01:14:42,530
gets near the other cat.
Look,

1500
01:14:42,531 --> 01:14:44,410
he's getting behind him.
He irritates him.

1501
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:50,040
He fucks with them.
He's fucking with both from literally 

1502
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:50,040
like he's fucking with him on purpose.
Look,

1503
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,070
he's getting really close.
This is.

1504
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:53,200
It backs up.
He's getting really close.

1505
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:54,730
He fucks with them.
Look,

1506
01:14:54,731 --> 01:14:57,430
he's literally fucking with that cat.
Awesome.

1507
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,350
He keeps.
He keeps poking at him.

1508
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,930
He's getting right behind him.
The cat turns around a swing at him,

1509
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:07,050
so he's agitating the cat.
The cat jumps on the other and he flies 

1510
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:09,610
over there and he's often away from them
while they're duking it out.

1511
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:12,970
They fall off the fucking roof,
beating the fuck out of each other.

1512
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:18,120
He flies to the ground and he's watching
them like he literally instigated and 

1513
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:22,180
started this fight that he's prodding 
them while they're fighting.

1514
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:28,570
They fall into a hole.
They're beating the shit out of each 

1515
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:28,570
other.
Dude.

1516
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:30,610
That birds like,
dude,

1517
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,640
what's the bird in their ear with them?
Fucking crazy.

1518
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:36,430
Right?

1519
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,990
And that's the bird is the devil to 
Raven.

1520
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,910
Yeah.
That's so raven.

1521
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,800
Ravens are always taught in BC Tannic,
right?

1522
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:43,850
Well,
yeah.

1523
01:15:43,851 --> 01:15:47,930
I mean I guess are there.
They're like a harbinger of doom.

1524
01:15:47,931 --> 01:15:49,490
They're called.
There's a great word for it.

1525
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:53,600
Psycho pumps is the word for it,
like animals that appear,

1526
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:58,190
I think before someone's going to die.
Like crows.

1527
01:15:58,191 --> 01:16:00,350
There's a whole bunch.
There's Edgar Allen Poe.

1528
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,010
The Raven.
Raven.

1529
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,500
Yeah.
The Raven that.

1530
01:16:03,501 --> 01:16:04,070
Well,
I think,

1531
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:06,260
you know,
I read an analysis of what that was.

1532
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,210
It's like very,
very fucking sad,

1533
01:16:08,211 --> 01:16:09,410
man.
Check the dump.

1534
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,060
They're never going to be happy again.
Oh,

1535
01:16:11,061 --> 01:16:12,260
that's it.
The idea is like,

1536
01:16:12,261 --> 01:16:17,261
yeah,
you're never going to be fucking happy 

1537
01:16:17,261 --> 01:16:17,261
again.
Like ever.

1538
01:16:17,261 --> 01:16:18,110
Like you're.
You're like happiness is a dream.

1539
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,010
Give it up.
The reality is that life is,

1540
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:26,290
you know,
it's the usual kind of fucking drivel 

1541
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:26,290
that comes out of Pete,
and I don't mean to say trivial,

1542
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:29,690
but sometimes the old happy juice isn't 
coming out of the synaptic vesicles.

1543
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,510
Vesicles way it should,
and you translate that.

1544
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:37,720
It's like instead of recognizing that 
your engine is running low on coolant,

1545
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,460
you think that all cars in the world 
must just run in some shitty way.

1546
01:16:43,461 --> 01:16:44,450
It's really,
it's,

1547
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,300
to me,
it's one of the most beautiful things to

1548
01:16:47,301 --> 01:16:51,680
realize while simultaneously being one 
of the most depressing things to realize

1549
01:16:51,681 --> 01:16:55,790
which is that so much of what human 
happiness is,

1550
01:16:56,090 --> 01:17:01,090
is coming from these synaptic vesicles,
these little bubbles of Serotonin that 

1551
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:06,550
are getting dripped into our brains 
according to our,

1552
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:08,930
what activities we are partaking in,
you know,

1553
01:17:08,931 --> 01:17:09,440
and so

1554
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,140
some people have.
The drip isn't happening.

1555
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:16,340
And I would say that it's probably safe 
to say that for Edgar Allen Poe,

1556
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:21,970
if his brain,
if you could say the synaptic vesicles 

1557
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,930
or the vagina of the human brain than 
his word dry,

1558
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:29,020
arid,
just just fucking chafed synaptic 

1559
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:35,021
vesicles.
He was depressed and nothing's coming 

1560
01:17:35,021 --> 01:17:35,021
out man.
And like,

1561
01:17:35,021 --> 01:17:35,420
I know what that's like because,
uh,

1562
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:40,900
anyone who's taken Mtma,
if you've taken Mtma and it felt the 

1563
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,681
Mtma related depression and extrapolate 
from that three straight years of that 

1564
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:52,480
unrelenting numbness that comes when you
don't have enough of the happy juice up 

1565
01:17:53,451 --> 01:17:58,451
there and then you're going to start 
writing shit like never more.

1566
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:00,220
Also,
it doesn't help that,

1567
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:02,780
uh,
his fucking wife.

1568
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:08,800
I think at one point she had a.
What was the name of that terrible 

1569
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:08,800
disease?
Tuberculosis.

1570
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:13,280
I think it was tuberculosis.
She has some horrible lung disease and I

1571
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:18,281
think she was playing piano at this,
a party that he threw and she just like 

1572
01:18:19,551 --> 01:18:24,551
exploded blood all over the piano.
Like she just caught the big spray of 

1573
01:18:24,551 --> 01:18:26,880
blood.
So he had a rough life at Graland Po.

1574
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,420
He's a fucking alcoholic,
you know,

1575
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:33,140
he had a crazy go that to that,
that makes depression.

1576
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:34,820
I mean,
it doesn't help,

1577
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:37,700
that's for sure.
Nothing hinders your happiness.

1578
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:40,820
Like crashing your system every night.
Ugh.

1579
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:46,200
Um,
you're essentially slowly poisoning 

1580
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:46,940
yourself if you're really a in a 
drinking all the time.

1581
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,830
Oh,
not good.

1582
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,540
Not Good.
Not fucking good.

1583
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:54,710
There's so many better options out there
for it and on that Pod,

1584
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:58,500
that's illegal,
but no.

1585
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:06,420
Yeah,
I just think that people would benefit 

1586
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:07,730
more from a two for marijuana instead of
making you more confident,

1587
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,980
makes less,
makes you more alert,

1588
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:13,040
more aware,
more objective.

1589
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:16,280
It just makes you a nicer drug.
It's nicer,

1590
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:20,030
like in terms of its effects in terms of
the behavior of people that are on it.

1591
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,620
Just a way nicer drug.
Hey,

1592
01:19:21,621 --> 01:19:26,621
I tell you man,
like all this fucking shit coming out 

1593
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:31,421
about Hillary Clinton.
The thing that really bummed me out the 

1594
01:19:31,421 --> 01:19:34,991
most man was that fucking.
She's like anti marijuana like that 

1595
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:35,780
really?
Like,

1596
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:39,380
that really gets to me man.
It's like God damn it because like I was

1597
01:19:39,381 --> 01:19:42,980
going to do for her,
like the pragmatic Clinton vote,

1598
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:43,820
you know,
like,

1599
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:47,960
well trump seems like a fun guy to hang 
out with at a party.

1600
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:49,790
Don't want him around my nuclear 
weapons.

1601
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:52,220
Like Hillary Clinton seems like a,
uh,

1602
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,360
like a,
a,

1603
01:19:53,361 --> 01:19:55,100
a,
you know,

1604
01:19:55,330 --> 01:20:00,330
God just like the ultimate politician,
like the super evolved ultimate flower 

1605
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:03,980
on the Goddamn Po.
Barbara Bush of politics.

1606
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:07,830
Like she's but God saw fuck out outright
in fucking check

1607
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,440
Hillary Clinton,
and it's like God damn it.

1608
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,030
Like she's rude.
Johnson.

1609
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:13,530
What?
Gary Johnson.

1610
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:16,200
Gary Johnson makes sense.
I mean,

1611
01:20:16,201 --> 01:20:21,201
he doesn't know shit about Aleppo,
but he doesn't know shit about a lot of 

1612
01:20:21,201 --> 01:20:25,881
things.
I'm sure there's going to have to learn 

1613
01:20:25,881 --> 01:20:25,881
if he becomes president.
Do you really think that?

1614
01:20:25,881 --> 01:20:27,330
Is that really your intention?
That's who you're endorsing,

1615
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:30,330
endorsing him more than anybody else.
That's who you're going to vote for.

1616
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,790
I'd vote outright in you about that 
bitch.

1617
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:37,610
Don't write in me right in back at your 
ranch is right in back at your answer.

1618
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,930
That's what I'm writing in reading 
impact trenches.

1619
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:43,290
Fine.
But I do think that,

1620
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:48,450
I mean,
can we talk about this nonsense so long,

1621
01:20:48,451 --> 01:20:53,451
but her,
her insistence on working towards 

1622
01:20:53,451 --> 01:20:57,230
marijuana and making sure that marijuana
stays a schedule one drug.

1623
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,970
Yeah.
It's.

1624
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:03,590
It's not just disappointing.
It's traitorous or a set of word.

1625
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:06,020
Yes,
out of big.

1626
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:06,590
Yeah.
It's big.

1627
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,360
Traitorous make it better word.
It's not traders.

1628
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:14,100
Shitty trader is.
You could say traitorous sounds wrong.

1629
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:19,150
It sounds like a dinosaur treatise.
Hillary Clinton trade a syllabus,

1630
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:25,970
but I think it's,
it's not just not doing your job to 

1631
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:29,430
serve and protect us and to lead us.
It's not only is it not doing your job,

1632
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,880
it's doing the opposite of your job.
You're doing something for profit and 

1633
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,961
for you,
you've made a connection and through 

1634
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:41,540
influence you've decided to do something
that you know for sure doesn't help 

1635
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:42,600
anybody.
It keeps people in jail.

1636
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:45,480
That's all you need to know.
The key people in jail part,

1637
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:50,870
it's all you need to know.
More people were arrested from marijuana

1638
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:57,380
than for all violent crimes combined.
That's so fucked up.

1639
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:03,020
It's insane,
but that's the problem is that it's a 

1640
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,721
business.
There's a giant business and arresting 

1641
01:22:05,721 --> 01:22:08,160
people and putting people in jail,
keeping people in jail,

1642
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:09,240
enforcing laws.

1643
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:12,000
There's a business in that.
It's a huge business.

1644
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:14,220
We don't want to think of it as a huge 
business,

1645
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:19,610
but anytime a huge business drops off 
and it's going to drop off whoever 

1646
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:20,190
you're.
If you're in that business,

1647
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:22,590
get out now because you're like 
blockbuster video.

1648
01:22:22,591 --> 01:22:24,870
You motherfuckers right?
You're not going to make it.

1649
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,460
You mean the prison business?
Yes,

1650
01:22:26,461 --> 01:22:29,640
the prison business and the drug 
business,

1651
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:34,940
that dea business,
the arresting people for marijuana 

1652
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:38,001
business.
Anybody who's in the arresting people 

1653
01:22:38,001 --> 01:22:39,020
for marijuana business,
you might as well be selling Betamax.

1654
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:41,190
I hope you're right,
man.

1655
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:42,450
You can't.
It's not.

1656
01:22:42,451 --> 01:22:47,451
It's not going to work anymore.
You can't keep arresting people for 

1657
01:22:47,451 --> 01:22:47,790
something that everybody does,
so I had to give it up without.

1658
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:51,500
If she's saying if flight the next 
president,

1659
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:56,510
she's definitely gonna be the next 
president is saying that she's going to 

1660
01:22:56,510 --> 01:23:00,731
continue this prohibition to the bankers
that were paying her to give a 

1661
01:23:00,731 --> 01:23:05,060
presentation then,
and this is the person Obama's endorsing

1662
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,500
and Bernie Sanders is endorsing it.
Just like that.

1663
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,070
Look,
I,

1664
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:10,420
you know,
I don't know.

1665
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:12,790
I don't.
The more I look into all this shit,

1666
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:15,600
the more confused I become.
Like I start.

1667
01:23:15,601 --> 01:23:17,590
I tried to like go a little deeper into 
it,

1668
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:22,830
like looking up the Clinton Foundation 
and then like checking out the charity 

1669
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:27,091
websites that like talk about the 
Clinton found that or give it a rating 

1670
01:23:27,091 --> 01:23:27,091
or whatever.
And it's like,

1671
01:23:27,091 --> 01:23:31,830
well it definitely doesn't it.
Like there's a lot of misinformation 

1672
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:33,700
coming from both sides,
but the most,

1673
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:39,210
the one I trust only because they're 
like a left leaning super liberal 

1674
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:40,060
website.
The huffington post called,

1675
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:45,270
there's an article in there saying that 
Hillary Clinton Foundation's gross is 

1676
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:49,021
the name of the article and basically it
says the foundation itself,

1677
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:54,370
if you look at the tax returns,
since it's an operating foundation,

1678
01:23:54,371 --> 01:23:59,371
all the bullshit of they're only giving 
like six percent or 10 percent of the 

1679
01:23:59,371 --> 01:24:01,840
money to charities is wrong because they
are doing shit.

1680
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,020
They are doing stuff.
That foundation goes into the world that

1681
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:10,080
has worked with AIDS.
So you can't villainize the entire 

1682
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,910
foundation,
but what's fucked up is the Clinton's,

1683
01:24:12,911 --> 01:24:16,870
when they go to give talks to people who
then donate to the foundation,

1684
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:20,470
they get paid and that money separate 
from what goes to the foundation.

1685
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:25,740
So when Hillary Clinton goes and gives a
speech and then they donate to the 

1686
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:30,151
foundation,
the amount they pay her for the speech 

1687
01:24:30,151 --> 01:24:33,150
doesn't go to the foundation.
So that goes to the Clintons when Bill 

1688
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:35,410
Clinton and it's hundreds of thousands 
of dollars for an hour speech.

1689
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,310
Yeah.
Right.

1690
01:24:36,311 --> 01:24:41,311
So that's where it's like,
that's where the corruption is and 

1691
01:24:41,311 --> 01:24:44,821
apparently there used to be some kind of
law that if there was even the 

1692
01:24:44,821 --> 01:24:48,781
appearance of corruption and politics,
then you had to change your operating 

1693
01:24:48,781 --> 01:24:52,831
procedures,
but that apparently got changed in the 

1694
01:24:52,831 --> 01:24:52,831
Supreme Court or something.

1695
01:24:52,831 --> 01:24:53,380
So now you,
you could.

1696
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,970
Yeah,
it's fucking crazy.

1697
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:57,940
It's crazy.
And like last night at the debates man,

1698
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,750
when uh,
when they asked her about the Wiki leaks

1699
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:03,100
shit,
which is real,

1700
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:05,650
like it's however the information got 
obtained,

1701
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:08,650
it really doesn't fucking matter.
But.

1702
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:12,890
But I mean it matters.
But the issue is the information itself,

1703
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,350
right?
So when you watch that faint where she's

1704
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:19,650
like,
you got it from Putin,

1705
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:22,120
it was amazing to me.
That was like,

1706
01:25:22,121 --> 01:25:23,350
God damn it,
like trump,

1707
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:27,580
there's a really great chance right 
there for you to be like,

1708
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:31,870
did Putin send those emails?
Was He writing your emails?

1709
01:25:31,871 --> 01:25:35,290
Because let's talk about the fucking 
emails and then we'll talk about Russia.

1710
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,450
But he liked spun off on this weird 
thing.

1711
01:25:37,451 --> 01:25:39,160
It was a really like associate baited 
them.

1712
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,810
She fucking baited him.
She's a master thought.

1713
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:43,150
She's so good at playing him.

1714
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,450
She's so good.
It's amazing to watch though.

1715
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,390
He's easy,
but she's doing it masterful.

1716
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,090
Well,
she is.

1717
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:54,150
Well Mr Lee.
I guess that's like the one better 

1718
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:57,520
comfort that we have is that this person
who's going to become president is very,

1719
01:25:57,521 --> 01:26:01,000
very sophisticated when it comes to 
manipulating people.

1720
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:04,760
Sophisticated in a way that like,
God,

1721
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:05,510
man,
I kept looking.

1722
01:26:05,511 --> 01:26:08,610
I kept trying to take pictures ever.
And you get up close to them,

1723
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:09,860
dude.
Shit.

1724
01:26:09,861 --> 01:26:14,861
Her view,
someone needs to put together a montage 

1725
01:26:14,861 --> 01:26:17,741
of Clinton fucking stink eyes.
Have you seen like how good she is at 

1726
01:26:17,741 --> 01:26:21,371
given the stink eye?
Like she was looking because what's 

1727
01:26:21,371 --> 01:26:21,920
crazy?
She was like looking.

1728
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:27,370
She's looking at the camera,
like I'm trying to get pictures ever 

1729
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:29,740
because she's wearing the same outfit.
Kind of is the heaven's gate dude that 

1730
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:30,760
he liked.
Like it's Kinda the same outfits.

1731
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:32,710
I'm trying to get a picture of it and 
uh,

1732
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:38,400
and she,
she keeps looking at the camera and 

1733
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,631
giving this like fucking stink.
I that felt like she was looking at me 

1734
01:26:40,631 --> 01:26:44,831
like it felt like fuck.
She knows I'm trying to like do this 

1735
01:26:44,831 --> 01:26:44,831
tweet about or weird outfits.

1736
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:49,280
She gives a terrible stink.
I'm like,

1737
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:52,700
I've never seen anybody throw.
I daggers.

1738
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:55,490
Like Hillary Clinton camp man.
It's crazy.

1739
01:26:55,970 --> 01:27:00,970
Do you think that's.
Do you think that she's employing a 

1740
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:03,941
different strategy now?
Because their first strategy with him 

1741
01:27:03,941 --> 01:27:06,290
was to kind of laugh when he would say 
ridiculous shit and almost like take the

1742
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:11,291
high road,
but now she's gone on the attack more 

1743
01:27:11,291 --> 01:27:14,240
and now Clinton and Melania Donald shake
hands before.

1744
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:15,740
Yeah.
Like there's all this,

1745
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,080
all this stuff that's going on,
man.

1746
01:27:18,081 --> 01:27:23,081
It's different.
It's a different sort of vibe now 

1747
01:27:23,081 --> 01:27:25,811
between the two of them as it ramps up.
I think she was like super effective 

1748
01:27:25,811 --> 01:27:28,070
though and just taking the moral high 
ground her.

1749
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:33,130
Yeah.
Well I mean in terms of debate tactic 

1750
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:33,190
where here's trump my imagined.

1751
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:38,310
I imagine like what it trumps strategy 
meeting looks like is like people 

1752
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:39,310
sitting around eating cheeseburgers 
doing blow.

1753
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:41,110
You know what I mean?
They're like,

1754
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:46,380
they're like,
trump's already making deals for his 

1755
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:46,380
next TV show.
He's like,

1756
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:46,380
he's like,
fuck,

1757
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:46,510
whatever.
Yeah.

1758
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,070
The president thing,
they don't care.

1759
01:27:48,071 --> 01:27:48,910
They're like,
you know,

1760
01:27:48,911 --> 01:27:51,880
he probably is getting fucking calls 
from poot and they're laughing.

1761
01:27:51,881 --> 01:27:52,340
They're like,
alright,

1762
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:53,180
I gotta go,
I gotta go,

1763
01:27:53,181 --> 01:27:55,160
we gotta do this stupid fucking debate.
Like,

1764
01:27:55,420 --> 01:28:00,420
you know what I mean?
And I think if you look at a Hillary 

1765
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:03,250
Clinton strategy meeting,
she's like sitting in some kind of like 

1766
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:06,640
God dome surrounded by CIA agents who 
are like,

1767
01:28:06,641 --> 01:28:11,110
we've done a thermal analysis of Donald 
and here are the moments that you should

1768
01:28:11,111 --> 01:28:16,111
hold still and at this moment we 
recommend that you say this and then 

1769
01:28:16,111 --> 01:28:20,911
this and then this.
Like she goes through the hole that 

1770
01:28:20,911 --> 01:28:20,911
they're like,
oh,

1771
01:28:20,911 --> 01:28:23,880
he's definitely gonna bring up the Wiki 
leaks here according to our 

1772
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,971
psychological analysis and also some of 
the DNA data we got from one of the 

1773
01:28:26,971 --> 01:28:28,900
cheeseburger crumbs that fell out of his
fucking mouth.

1774
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:33,010
And one of these rallies is like he's 
going to react to this and like she just

1775
01:28:33,011 --> 01:28:37,000
memorizes it and it kind of alien way 
sits there and just does it.

1776
01:28:37,001 --> 01:28:39,610
Like the fighters I'm sure.
Like I remember when you were like,

1777
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:44,640
when I realized,
because I don't know at the time I 

1778
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,711
didn't know anything about fighting,
but then you were explaining how like 

1779
01:28:46,711 --> 01:28:50,610
their,
they have these insanely deep combos if 

1780
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:54,151
this person does this,
they have all these moves like 19 moves 

1781
01:28:54,151 --> 01:28:56,530
deep that like there's incredible.
So I think she's like that.

1782
01:28:56,790 --> 01:29:01,790
Like she has like if he does this,
you do this and if he does that then 

1783
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:01,790
this,
this,

1784
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:01,790
this,
and then that.

1785
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:02,130
And then that.
And then that.

1786
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:07,370
And they've done it all with like a 
government team of psychologists who 

1787
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:09,480
fully analyzed him and know how to 
fucking set him off.

1788
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,720
And she did it last night.
She did it in every single fucking 

1789
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:15,630
debate and it's not like she's the one 
who's coming up with that.

1790
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:20,810
She's got a team of the smartest,
most manipulative people on planet earth

1791
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:25,620
who baited him in to the fucking 
elections in the first place.

1792
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:26,940
You saw that email,
right?

1793
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,870
Where they picked the three candidates 
that they wanted to empower,

1794
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,670
you know,
or to like build up,

1795
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,560
which was trump.
What's his name?

1796
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:37,560
Cruz.
Ted fucking cruise.

1797
01:29:37,561 --> 01:29:40,890
Because he's also fool because he's a 
fool and the other,

1798
01:29:40,891 --> 01:29:42,140
the sweet guy,
the docker,

1799
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:43,530
Rubio,
not Rubio,

1800
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:44,730
Carson,
Carson,

1801
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:49,760
you know,
so like they pick the three biggest 

1802
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:49,760
fools days.
They're like,

1803
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:49,980
all right,
let's pump them up.

1804
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:55,160
They pump them up.
The King of the fools made his way into 

1805
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,940
the fucking president.
Somehow.

1806
01:29:56,941 --> 01:29:58,110
They're like,
are you fucking kidding?

1807
01:29:58,111 --> 01:30:00,540
We got trump.
We've got fucking trump.

1808
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,220
We got trump.
Trump.

1809
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:02,880
Oh,
hold on,

1810
01:30:02,881 --> 01:30:05,670
let me go to the trump file.
Oh my God.

1811
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:09,600
Listen to this audio of him talking 
about graphing fucking girls.

1812
01:30:09,601 --> 01:30:10,170
She's like,
okay,

1813
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:15,171
great.
Let's use that to hold onto that for a 

1814
01:30:15,171 --> 01:30:15,171
while.
Yeah,

1815
01:30:15,171 --> 01:30:15,860
we'll do that on the day before the 
second debate.

1816
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:20,890
Yeah,
let's do that in the day before the 

1817
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:20,890
second debate.
You know what I mean?

1818
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:21,840
I think they gave it two days.
Yeah.

1819
01:30:21,841 --> 01:30:26,841
Two days to two days to build and then 
of course they are probably working on 

1820
01:30:26,841 --> 01:30:27,330
like,
you know,

1821
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,010
months leading up to it.
They're like,

1822
01:30:29,011 --> 01:30:34,011
let's find every single person that 
claims Donald trump grope them or that 

1823
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:38,451
were groped by Donald Trump.
Anyone who's willing to claim Donald 

1824
01:30:38,451 --> 01:30:38,790
Trump grope them.
Anybody wants to get on TV?

1825
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

1826
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,340
You guys failing and I.
But I have a feeling.

1827
01:30:41,341 --> 01:30:42,780
I mean I don't,
I don't know for sure,

1828
01:30:42,781 --> 01:30:46,470
but my guess would be that if you wanted
to find people who said,

1829
01:30:46,471 --> 01:30:47,910
yeah,
trump grabbed my pussy,

1830
01:30:47,911 --> 01:30:49,440
it wouldn't be that fucking hard.

1831
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:54,800
It's not like you're looking for bigfoot
pretty easy to run them down I guess,

1832
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:03,540
but so,
so it wasn't like a hard thing to do.

1833
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,630
It's a breadcrumb trail.
Very simple,

1834
01:31:06,631 --> 01:31:11,631
very easy.
And so it's like when you realize like 

1835
01:31:11,631 --> 01:31:14,421
that,
then you start feeling this weird 

1836
01:31:14,421 --> 01:31:14,421
compassion for him and you're like,
oh my God.

1837
01:31:14,421 --> 01:31:18,171
Even with all his like,
maliciousness and like weird 

1838
01:31:18,171 --> 01:31:18,300
pervasiveness and stuff.
Ultimately he,

1839
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:20,310
they,
he's like a fucking bowl.

1840
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:25,580
They got put into a Goddamn ring with a 
matador has been doing this kind of bowl

1841
01:31:25,781 --> 01:31:28,880
fighting for like 30 fucking years for 
better,

1842
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:30,870
for worse.
And he's,

1843
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:34,260
we're watching what we saw last night I 
guess.

1844
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:39,380
And what's interesting about it,
a big part of what's interesting about 

1845
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:40,980
it is he came really close to women.
I mean,

1846
01:31:40,981 --> 01:31:45,981
he still in the neighborhood of winning 
plus or minus 11 points or what that 

1847
01:31:46,321 --> 01:31:51,321
means is between now and how many days 
do we have until the election is 21 

1848
01:31:51,321 --> 01:31:52,080
days.
Listen man,

1849
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:56,730
lot of crazy shit can happen in 21 days 
to shift people's opinion.

1850
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:58,510
No,
but apparently again,

1851
01:31:58,511 --> 01:32:00,100
from all the now look,
man,

1852
01:32:00,101 --> 01:32:00,910
I try to get it right.

1853
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,170
Don't say any of that stuff because you 
don't even know if it's true.

1854
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:08,380
They're all just talking on TV and they 
brainwash and all of us to let us think 

1855
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:09,680
that they know who the fuck's voting.
They're not talking to you.

1856
01:32:09,681 --> 01:32:11,420
They're not talking to me.
They're not talking to Jamie.

1857
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,900
They.
I don't think they know nearly.

1858
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:17,510
You know?
I don't think it's a massive cover up at

1859
01:32:17,511 --> 01:32:22,511
all.
I think a lot of what happens in the 

1860
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:24,560
polls does reflect how the United States
feels,

1861
01:32:24,561 --> 01:32:28,580
but there's no way it could be 100 
percent accurate because it's not.

1862
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:31,550
It's not pulling 100 percent of the 
people.

1863
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:36,910
And I think part of the problem with 
those poles is once you read the results

1864
01:32:37,101 --> 01:32:40,130
of the polls,
Hillary Clinton is a head by 16 percent.

1865
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:41,690
Everybody just starts saying,
well,

1866
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:44,360
Hillary Clinton's got it in the bag.
I've seen the recent polls.

1867
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:48,680
And you even start thinking in voting 
towards that goal.

1868
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,080
Like people who might have voted for 
trump go,

1869
01:32:51,081 --> 01:32:53,120
I don't want to waste my vote.
I want to be on the winning team.

1870
01:32:53,121 --> 01:32:54,320
You know,
there's a lot of that

1871
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:55,940
I think really though,
man,

1872
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:59,900
like if people like what that they 
affected that actually has his people,

1873
01:32:59,901 --> 01:33:02,360
he might have been terrified of trump 
being president.

1874
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,430
They're like,
she's already had by 12 percent,

1875
01:33:04,431 --> 01:33:06,440
I'm not going to fucking drive out to 
the polls to vote.

1876
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:11,620
They don't come out to vote.
Like it would serve her more if there 

1877
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:11,840
was some collusion between her and the 
media,

1878
01:33:11,841 --> 01:33:15,110
which according to the Podesta emails,
there certainly has been there.

1879
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:18,260
Like you've got the of the editor of 
politico,

1880
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,030
you saw that one where he's like,
fuck it,

1881
01:33:20,031 --> 01:33:21,080
I'm a hack.
Yeah.

1882
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,700
Yeah.
Crazy,

1883
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:23,600
crazy.
So like,

1884
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:25,760
I don't know if was the editor,
I don't remember which guy was it.

1885
01:33:25,761 --> 01:33:30,761
The point is I would,
I think it's a pretty safe bet that 

1886
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:36,520
she's going to be the next president and
I don't think that that data that we're 

1887
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:41,090
getting is necessarily some kind of 
collusion between

1888
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:43,860
not saying it's collusion.
I'm saying it affects the event itself.

1889
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,940
I'm saying that even if you do 
legitimately objectively pull a group of

1890
01:33:47,941 --> 01:33:49,650
people and you get a result from that 
pole,

1891
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,200
it's not really representative of 100 
percent of the people.

1892
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:57,350
But once you start thinking that it is,
and once people start deciding that it 

1893
01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:01,221
is,
it has a massive impact on how people 

1894
01:34:01,221 --> 01:34:01,221
vote.

1895
01:34:01,221 --> 01:34:01,221
Well,
I gotta tell you man,

1896
01:34:01,221 --> 01:34:05,330
before the fucking buses go riding 
through varying neighborhoods and 

1897
01:34:07,171 --> 01:34:12,171
scooping up illegal immigrants in before
that fucking abortion cops start 

1898
01:34:13,091 --> 01:34:18,091
arresting fucking women for getting 
abortions and before all the insanity 

1899
01:34:18,211 --> 01:34:21,330
that like apparently he's going to do 
starts happening,

1900
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:25,500
that he trump that if he gets elected,
if he gets to the metal arresting people

1901
01:34:25,501 --> 01:34:26,820
for abortions.
Yeah.

1902
01:34:26,821 --> 01:34:29,050
He said that women should be punished 
for.

1903
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:31,710
That's one of the main,
one of his many fuck ups as he was like,

1904
01:34:31,711 --> 01:34:32,580
yeah,
women should be.

1905
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:36,060
There should be some punitive.
The legal shit.

1906
01:34:36,061 --> 01:34:38,550
If women get a legal abortion,
that's real.

1907
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:39,600
Look it up.
You could find.

1908
01:34:39,601 --> 01:34:40,680
It's like famous.
Yeah,

1909
01:34:40,681 --> 01:34:41,850
look it up.
Whoa.

1910
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:44,120
He's like,
I really said that.

1911
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:45,480
Well,
he said you look it up.

1912
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:46,590
There's a whole thing.
Fine.

1913
01:34:46,591 --> 01:34:51,591
James James is going to look it up.
I didn't know that he had said those 

1914
01:34:55,171 --> 01:34:57,070
words.
That's a crazy thing to say there.

1915
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:57,400
Ask

1916
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:00,720
someone for having an abortion.
Not for having an abortion.

1917
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:05,750
It's like for a.
you'll see it's like enough that like 

1918
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:06,950
she mentioned in the last debate.
Well,

1919
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:13,690
I mean it's,
it's hard to say too because a lot of 

1920
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:13,910
his positions on things,
you know,

1921
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:15,530
or off the cuff,
you know,

1922
01:35:15,531 --> 01:35:20,531
like maybe he hadn't even considered it.
Somebody brings something up and he 

1923
01:35:20,531 --> 01:35:23,411
talks about it and it doesn't have the 
fucking kind of trump he said he was 

1924
01:35:23,411 --> 01:35:23,600
miss.
I'll let you read it.

1925
01:35:23,601 --> 01:35:24,320
Okay,
let me read it.

1926
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:25,820
Go back up.
Go back up please.

1927
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:29,960
I'm trump abruptly.
Reverses course says women should not be

1928
01:35:29,961 --> 01:35:32,330
punished for abortion.
So what did he say?

1929
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:34,610
What we're going to look it up?
What was the station?

1930
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:37,910
There's been some sort of.
There has to be some sort of punishment.

1931
01:35:37,911 --> 01:35:41,050
He said women who receive unlawful 
abortions,

1932
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,640
I have not changed my position.

1933
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:47,230
Trump said in the statement he said he 
was referring to Dr.

1934
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:50,250
super former illegal abortions,
not women who received it.

1935
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:52,430
Okay,
I understand.

1936
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:58,030
Okay,
so he still believes that doctors who 

1937
01:35:58,030 --> 01:36:00,131
perform illegal abortions,
there should be some sort of punishment 

1938
01:36:00,131 --> 01:36:00,131
for them.
All right,

1939
01:36:00,131 --> 01:36:01,630
well that's not the same.
Wants to reverse roe versus Wade Rosie.

1940
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:03,970
Yeah.
Rosie said that last night.

1941
01:36:03,971 --> 01:36:08,971
I said he would put it into three or he 
said he would try to put in three 

1942
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:10,880
Supreme Court justices that would be on 
that side of the.

1943
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:16,300
The decision.
So it would automatically get reversed 

1944
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:16,910
was I think his exact words almost.
Man,

1945
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:22,270
that's so tricky.
That's deciding what people can and 

1946
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:23,320
can't do with their body and it'd be.
It was.

1947
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:26,090
Not that it's a baby,
it's not always a baby.

1948
01:36:26,091 --> 01:36:28,890
Sometimes it's a bunch of cells.
When it's 10 cells,

1949
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:30,770
it's still a baby,
you know,

1950
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,930
like you could get an abortion 10 cells 
in.

1951
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,520
Is that an abortion?
I mean,

1952
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:39,570
I do not know.
I'm legitimately asking what time do you

1953
01:36:39,891 --> 01:36:43,190
get to tell someone that they can remain
pregnant?

1954
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:45,920
But think of the irony that fucking pro 
abortion.

1955
01:36:45,921 --> 01:36:48,950
Hillary Clinton is anti marijuana.
So she's like,

1956
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:50,420
I can.
I'm going to tell you.

1957
01:36:50,421 --> 01:36:53,900
I know it's not our place to say what a 
woman could do with their body,

1958
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:56,480
but I'm going to fucking tell you what 
you can put into your body.

1959
01:36:56,660 --> 01:37:01,660
I've,
I think it is the government's place to 

1960
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:01,660
say that.
It's like,

1961
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:01,660
well,
what the fuck?

1962
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:05,570
She's doing it for profit 100 percent.
That's the only reason why the banks 

1963
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:05,570
wanted to do it in the first place.
Wild.

1964
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,310
Would the banks be concerned about 
marijuana?

1965
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:10,820
Are they in the marijuana business?
What the fuck is going on?

1966
01:37:10,821 --> 01:37:15,821
Why would banks want her to be for 
marijuana laws?

1967
01:37:16,930 --> 01:37:17,930
That doesn't make any sense.

1968
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:19,160
I don't get it,
man.

1969
01:37:19,161 --> 01:37:22,070
It's all a giant backed.
A lot of bankers love weed,

1970
01:37:22,071 --> 01:37:24,110
so it doesn't make sense,
a guarantee.

1971
01:37:24,111 --> 01:37:29,111
I know what it is.
It has to do with banks having interest 

1972
01:37:29,111 --> 01:37:29,111
in pharmaceutical companies.
You know,

1973
01:37:29,111 --> 01:37:31,310
the company that makes fentanyl,
we've talked about this ad nauseum.

1974
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:36,550
They're spending hundreds of thousands 
of dollars in Arizona to try to stop 

1975
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:36,550
the,
uh,

1976
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:40,340
the medical or not even medical.
They're trying to do recreational,

1977
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:45,370
recreational marijuana from being passed
in Arizona because they know that it's 

1978
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:49,841
way cheaper,
way easier and way more effective pain 

1979
01:37:49,841 --> 01:37:52,571
relief.
It's going to fucking cripple their 

1980
01:37:52,571 --> 01:37:52,571
creepy ass business.
And guess what?

1981
01:37:52,571 --> 01:37:55,080
No physical addiction properties.
Some people get addicted to it,

1982
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,010
but to the same people that

1983
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:01,010
get addicted to a lot of stuff folks,
and it doesn't mean there's like 

1984
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:01,010
physical addictive properties to 
marijuana.

1985
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:04,720
There's not really a mechanism for you 
to get physically addicted to marijuana.

1986
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,820
The way you can get physically addicted 
to painkillers,

1987
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,960
even if there was,
it's not the government's place to say 

1988
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:14,751
you can't do this,
especially while they still have pain 

1989
01:38:14,751 --> 01:38:14,751
pills and then taking money from these 
pains.

1990
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:16,230
Oh,
it's so gross.

1991
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:17,820
What a fucking mess,
man.

1992
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:21,780
It's like,
just to like this dream is like,

1993
01:38:21,781 --> 01:38:26,781
man,
can you imagine if the fucking 

1994
01:38:26,781 --> 01:38:29,460
Republicans had come up with just a 
normal dude?

1995
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:33,570
Like if they just somehow come up with 
one normal guy,

1996
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:38,900
like a,
just a non religious nut and somebody 

1997
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:43,311
who like doesn't have like a checkered 
past just to kind of balanced guys like,

1998
01:38:43,561 --> 01:38:48,561
well you need to work on the economy 
like Mitt Romney without the Mormon 

1999
01:38:48,561 --> 01:38:48,561
Shit.

2000
01:38:48,561 --> 01:38:52,620
If they had just come up with that,
they would have won by a long shot,

2001
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:57,950
a long shot.
It's like this was the perfect chance 

2002
01:38:57,950 --> 01:38:59,670
for them to get somebody in,
but it didn't happen.

2003
01:38:59,671 --> 01:39:02,940
They couldn't do it like the whole sit.
Their whole system was so screwy.

2004
01:39:02,941 --> 01:39:05,940
It's sad to you when you hear some of 
the [inaudible] by the way,

2005
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:07,680
man,
here's a news flash.

2006
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:12,920
Not all Republicans are pad.
Like people think that a lot of them 

2007
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:13,500
have like some great fucking ideas.
Smaller government.

2008
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,750
Not a bad idea,
but when you like,

2009
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:19,530
here are some of the frustration from 
like my fucking dad,

2010
01:39:19,531 --> 01:39:22,230
man.
He's a lifelong Republican.

2011
01:39:22,231 --> 01:39:25,140
He's a vet and he's,
you know,

2012
01:39:25,141 --> 01:39:28,320
he's like dismayed by all of this.
Like he's,

2013
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:33,410
he looks at it from the perspective of 
someone who's like seeing so many 

2014
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:37,131
different election cycles and to look at
like it's boiling down to debates that 

2015
01:39:38,311 --> 01:39:43,311
have turned into the fucking jerry 
springer show literally like this is a 

2016
01:39:43,311 --> 01:39:46,971
fucking guy who spent two fucking years 
in Vietnam by choice because he thought 

2017
01:39:48,601 --> 01:39:50,430
he was going to fight for his country.

2018
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:55,430
So these things mean a lot to him and 
it's like to see fucking this fucking 

2019
01:39:56,070 --> 01:40:01,070
barely.
And at least in the debates that I've 

2020
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:01,070
seen,
I don't,

2021
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:01,830
you see barely anyone talking about the 
fucking veterans.

2022
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:07,070
Like no one's fucking talking about the 
fact that the Va's fucked or that like 

2023
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:09,390
some of these people aren't getting any 
of the medical care that they need.

2024
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:14,750
It's like crazy.
They're up there fucking talking about 

2025
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,680
trump grabbing pussies are like Hillary 
Clinton's fucking stupid foundation.

2026
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:20,090
What about the fact that like people are
blowing their goddamn brains out?

2027
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:25,120
Oliver neighborhoods across our country 
because they made the decision to like 

2028
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:28,731
go fight in fucking Iraq and more people
have killed themselves than have died 

2029
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:29,100
serving.
Yeah.

2030
01:40:29,101 --> 01:40:30,310
What about that?
Why are they,

2031
01:40:30,311 --> 01:40:34,320
your veterans have killed themselves 
than have been killed in war.

2032
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:35,580
Can you imagine?
Like,

2033
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:38,890
that's insane.
I have never let me.

2034
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:42,030
What is the numbers?
I would like to know how much more it is

2035
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:48,110
that more veterans have committed 
suicide than have died in combat in 

2036
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:48,870
these wars.
That's,

2037
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:53,290
that's,
that's unbelievably shocking to the fact

2038
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:54,190
that they don't talk about

2039
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:54,670
that at all.

2040
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,070
Hardly at all.
And it's like to just imagine like.

2041
01:40:58,210 --> 01:40:59,390
And by the way,
here's another thing,

2042
01:40:59,391 --> 01:41:01,220
man,
one thing you don't hear about,

2043
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:03,810
like we hear about like,
you know,

2044
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:05,500
you hear about the,
uh,

2045
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:07,600
you know,
you hear,

2046
01:41:07,730 --> 01:41:09,890
we do hear about ptsd a lot,
but like you,

2047
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:13,850
I don't think people realize the impact 
that ptsd as a family,

2048
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:18,880
like the impact of your dad or your mom 
being completely closed off because like

2049
01:41:20,601 --> 01:41:25,601
when you get ptsd,
you develop these crazy survival 

2050
01:41:25,601 --> 01:41:26,780
mechanisms.
So you try not to feel as much anymore.

2051
01:41:26,781 --> 01:41:28,970
So you get numbed down,
you become an alcoholic,

2052
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:30,730
you become a drug addict,
you,

2053
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:35,000
you have difficulty expressing emotions,
you're a fucking mess man.

2054
01:41:35,001 --> 01:41:37,850
And like by the way,
with all due respect,

2055
01:41:37,851 --> 01:41:38,690
but you're not,
you know,

2056
01:41:38,691 --> 01:41:42,020
ptsd is a very difficult disorder to 
have,

2057
01:41:42,021 --> 01:41:44,150
right?
So it's not just impacting the vet,

2058
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:49,330
it's fucking the entire spreading out 
into the communities and the 

2059
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:50,210
neighborhoods and shit.
And the fact that like,

2060
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:53,570
I just imagine being in a family that's 
been.

2061
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,830
God that's so fucked up.
Suicide surpassed war,

2062
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,270
other larger place.
Jim,

2063
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:02,650
just 17 to 22 every day.
Make that a little large police.

2064
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,690
Wow.
Look at that man.

2065
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:07,840
Jesus Christ.
This is,

2066
01:42:07,890 --> 01:42:11,200
this is really incredible.
Forty six percent of the look at this.

2067
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:16,470
The fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan 
accounted for anywhere from one and a 

2068
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:17,890
three deaths in the military from 2005 
to 2000,

2069
01:42:17,891 --> 01:42:22,891
10 to more than 46 percent of the deaths
in 2007 according to the height of the 

2070
01:42:24,281 --> 01:42:29,281
Iraqi.
So during the height of the Iraqi 

2071
01:42:29,281 --> 01:42:29,281
search,
more than 6,800

2072
01:42:29,281 --> 01:42:32,851
troops have died in Iraq and Afghanistan
since nine slash 11 and more than 3000 

2073
01:42:32,851 --> 01:42:37,261
additional service members have taken 
their lives in the same time according 

2074
01:42:37,261 --> 01:42:40,681
to Pentagon data now.
So keep going down so we can find out 

2075
01:42:40,681 --> 01:42:41,260
where that's it.
Wait a minute,

2076
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:44,060
hold on a second then go back to the 
bottom of that please.

2077
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:49,360
It says more than 6,800
troops have died in Iraq and Afghanistan

2078
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:52,210
and more than 3000 additional service 
members have taken their lives.

2079
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:56,170
So how is that the same amount?
Gook go back up to the title.

2080
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:58,690
That doesn't make any sense to me.
Is this a bad article?

2081
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,870
Suicide surpassed war as the military 
leading cause of death.

2082
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:06,220
What that means is currently that 
doesn't mean like all total.

2083
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:07,600
I think this is an old article.

2084
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:09,230
It's currently that which is,
you know,

2085
01:43:09,231 --> 01:43:10,580
but still.
Fuck.

2086
01:43:10,581 --> 01:43:11,600
That's so dire.

2087
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,960
Yeah.
This is a couple years old.

2088
01:43:13,070 --> 01:43:16,710
Go and find a.
If you can please find a more recent,

2089
01:43:17,370 --> 01:43:20,100
because I think what they were saying is
suicide.

2090
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:25,400
Suicide has caused more American 
casualties than wars in Iraq and 

2091
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:25,400
Afghanistan.
There it goes.

2092
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:28,530
Okay.
Yeah.

2093
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:29,880
Okay,
so what are the.

2094
01:43:29,881 --> 01:43:32,970
What are the numbers there?
Jesus Christ,

2095
01:43:32,971 --> 01:43:37,971
veterans to explore experts estimate 
that 17 of the 22 daily suicides 

2096
01:43:39,931 --> 01:43:44,460
involving vets not enrolled in the Va's 
healthcare system.

2097
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:44,950
Cheese

2098
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:49,290
27,258
of those we honored for their service on

2099
01:43:49,291 --> 01:43:51,500
this veterans day have died by their own
hand.

2100
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,630
Twenty seven fucking thousand people.

2101
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,120
Whoa.
What?

2102
01:44:00,730 --> 01:44:02,110
That's from.
How many wars?

2103
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:03,200
How many,

2104
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:06,620
how many years?
It's still people.

2105
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,270
It's unbelievable.
Anyway,

2106
01:44:09,271 --> 01:44:11,010
man,
the whole thing saw unbelievable.

2107
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:12,210
Right?
It's very believable.

2108
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:14,310
Like what?
An empty,

2109
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:20,030
empty existence to be having sent over 
there when you're 17 years old and 

2110
01:44:20,030 --> 01:44:22,440
you're fighting for a war that a lot of 
people don't believe in.

2111
01:44:22,441 --> 01:44:24,150
You wind up killing people you don't 
even know.

2112
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:29,990
You come back off,
fucked up and ptsd it out and then you 

2113
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:29,990
don't get any help.

2114
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:30,870
Yeah.
You don't get any,

2115
01:44:30,990 --> 01:44:35,990
any help because part of I think maybe 
part of PTSD is you don't want to reach 

2116
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:39,831
out for help.
So that's like part of the disorder is 

2117
01:44:39,831 --> 01:44:39,831
you're all numbed down.
So like,

2118
01:44:39,831 --> 01:44:44,300
yeah man,
not to mention you have many of these 

2119
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:45,150
people have brain trauma,
like they've got like there's a lot of.

2120
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:50,540
Anyway,
I'm sure that if you're sitting in a 

2121
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:50,540
fit,
like if you're in a family,

2122
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:54,690
it's been impacted by that and you're 
watching the debates because you know,

2123
01:44:54,691 --> 01:44:56,340
for me like I do,
I will.

2124
01:44:56,430 --> 01:44:58,620
I watched the debates is a form of 
entertainment,

2125
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:03,710
you know,
to me it's kind of like there's 

2126
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:05,721
something in it that's like grim yet 
hilarious and it's like interesting to 

2127
01:45:05,721 --> 01:45:09,150
see this kind of unraveling of our 
political system in this way.

2128
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:14,810
But man,
it's like when you just spend a little 

2129
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:18,561
bit of time thinking about how the whole
machine is like impacting families in 

2130
01:45:18,691 --> 01:45:20,670
the most fucked up way.
Man,

2131
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:23,970
a lot of kids,
they don't know their dad has ptsd,

2132
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:29,540
you know,
like they don't even know why their dad 

2133
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:32,150
is drinking so much or is acting angry 
or unpredictable or seems fucked up.

2134
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:36,060
They don't even know it.
They just think that's how dad is.

2135
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:40,140
And then they like develop.
They began to imitate that behavior,

2136
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:45,380
you know,
and then the next thing you know you've 

2137
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:46,881
got like this,
like echo of this terrible thing that 

2138
01:45:46,881 --> 01:45:50,080
war is echoing out into,
into our communities and in India,

2139
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:55,090
in our fucking in there everything man.
It's just so I imagine when you're 

2140
01:45:55,090 --> 01:45:58,430
watching the debates and you're 
realizing that these two people are 

2141
01:45:58,430 --> 01:46:02,481
spending.
I don't know what percentage of time 

2142
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,641
talking about that.
I don't know what the percentage is 

2143
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:06,810
exactly that.
They've talked about veterans at all,

2144
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:09,690
but you probably start getting really,
really,

2145
01:46:09,691 --> 01:46:11,400
really depressed when you're like,
well,

2146
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:17,030
I guess that was just a bunch of 
bullshit that we did out there for real 

2147
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:17,820
because these guys are barely talking 
about it.

2148
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:23,160
It's just a weird popularity contests 
for them to get into this position of 

2149
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:26,581
power.
That's all it is and they're saying 

2150
01:46:26,581 --> 01:46:26,950
whatever is popular in the moment and 
what's popular in the moment is grabbing

2151
01:46:26,951 --> 01:46:31,951
pussies and email scandals and that's.
That's what everybody seems to be 

2152
01:46:31,951 --> 01:46:35,251
focusing on because the war has been 
going on for so long that people almost 

2153
01:46:35,251 --> 01:46:36,280
numb to it,
and if you drudge that up,

2154
01:46:36,281 --> 01:46:38,530
it's not going to get the same emotional
sparks.

2155
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:42,020
The current event sparked that we love.
We love a current event.

2156
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:47,040
Spark right now.
The current events bark is grabbing 

2157
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:49,711
pussies and emails candles.
I went back and forth the other day 

2158
01:46:49,711 --> 01:46:49,711
during the debates,
um,

2159
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:53,790
post debate from CNN to Fox News,
CNN to Fox News,

2160
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:58,791
CNN to Fox News,
just listening to the different sides 

2161
01:46:58,801 --> 01:47:01,950
and how they talk about stuff.
It's so bizarre.

2162
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:03,130
It's so bizarre.
I mean,

2163
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:08,280
you never are more aware of the fact 
that you are being your pr propaganda as

2164
01:47:10,351 --> 01:47:12,210
being projected in your way.

2165
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:17,360
Just blatantly unapologetic propaganda.
The CNN people aren't even remotely 

2166
01:47:20,341 --> 01:47:23,670
considering the impact of her,
her,

2167
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:29,110
the,
the controversy with the Clinton 

2168
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:29,110
Foundation,
her,

2169
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:33,000
this wikileaks stuff that's come out 
about the bankers and her trying to keep

2170
01:47:33,001 --> 01:47:36,990
marijuana and the illegal drug and keep 
Americans in prisoned.

2171
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:38,040
Therefore,
because of it,

2172
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,930
none of that gets brought up.
Nothing.

2173
01:47:39,931 --> 01:47:43,500
Not a thing.
It's brought up the idea that 30,000

2174
01:47:43,501 --> 01:47:48,270
emails were about Yoga classes.
How much does this bitch take yoga?

2175
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,280
How is that even possible?
Dude,

2176
01:47:50,281 --> 01:47:53,820
I've been doing Jujitsu for 20 something
years.

2177
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:59,390
I don't think I have a thousand jujitsu 
emails or I could delete.

2178
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:02,900
I don't even think I have one.
I might have 100.

2179
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:06,540
I might have 100 or 200 Jujitsu emails 
that I could lead.

2180
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:10,230
How the fuck is Hillary Clinton?
Nonphysical.

2181
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:15,320
Hillary Clinton with her bite suit on 
that crazy space outfit on.

2182
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:20,510
How is she.
You're trying to pretend that you're 

2183
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:20,510
doing yoga all the time.
Come on.

2184
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:21,660
That's insane.
Doing Yoga.

2185
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:21,670
I

2186
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:27,010
also like this sinister thing.
They did apparently John Kerry 

2187
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:29,830
manipulated Ecuador and the cutting 
office.

2188
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:32,330
Sanchez Internet connection,
you know,

2189
01:48:32,331 --> 01:48:35,840
so it's like on top of that they just 
like shut him down there.

2190
01:48:35,841 --> 01:48:40,841
Like so like our country was able to 
manipulate and now they're contrary to 

2191
01:48:41,931 --> 01:48:44,210
shut the internet connection off of a 
guy.

2192
01:48:44,211 --> 01:48:44,870
It's like,
you know,

2193
01:48:44,871 --> 01:48:49,871
you hear about how like who's the new 
leader of creates Kim Jong Il was the 

2194
01:48:49,871 --> 01:48:49,871
first wounds,
the second.

2195
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:53,180
So like Kim Jong noon,
the South Koreans,

2196
01:48:53,181 --> 01:48:56,630
they like put propaganda weather 
balloons in North Korea and the,

2197
01:48:56,690 --> 01:48:59,000
I guess the North Koreans to see this 
shit and they're like,

2198
01:48:59,001 --> 01:49:00,860
what the fuck?
And then like,

2199
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:06,050
you know,
Kim Jong wound threatens to like shoot 

2200
01:49:06,050 --> 01:49:07,160
nuclear missiles into South Korea for 
distributing information.

2201
01:49:07,161 --> 01:49:07,520
Like,
Hey,

2202
01:49:07,521 --> 01:49:10,550
you guys are in a fucking hell bubble 
over there.

2203
01:49:10,551 --> 01:49:12,350
You know,
the world's not really like that.

2204
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:13,730
They don't know that over there.

2205
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:18,730
Right.
So in the same way a assigned has 

2206
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:18,730
started like leaking this information 
was just like,

2207
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:19,760
hey,
check it out man,

2208
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,310
your politicians,
this is how they fucking work,

2209
01:49:22,311 --> 01:49:24,770
this is how they work.
And instead of us being like,

2210
01:49:24,771 --> 01:49:27,350
Whoa,
let's reform the system,

2211
01:49:27,351 --> 01:49:29,480
we had to reform this fucking system,
man,

2212
01:49:29,481 --> 01:49:32,330
you can't do that.
Like even if it is above the board,

2213
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:37,340
like even if what you're doing is above 
the board in some kind of weird gray,

2214
01:49:37,341 --> 01:49:40,310
liminal legal area,
it shouldn't be,

2215
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:42,080
it shouldn't be.
Let's fix it.

2216
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:43,190
Instead we're like,
ah,

2217
01:49:43,670 --> 01:49:48,490
this is that Vladimir Putin trying to 
fucking manipulate our elections,

2218
01:49:48,491 --> 01:49:53,491
which by the way are not rigged.
How did he say that?

2219
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:57,610
When our politicians are so fucking 
honest,

2220
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:02,820
why would anybody say that?
The very thing that makes these honest 

2221
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:06,070
people rise to power would be fucking 
corrupt.

2222
01:50:06,130 --> 01:50:07,930
Too strange,
so strange,

2223
01:50:07,931 --> 01:50:09,370
so strange,
so strange.

2224
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:10,850
And it's like the,
you know,

2225
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:14,320
the reaction we should all be having 
should not be like,

2226
01:50:15,350 --> 01:50:17,260
I don't know,
anger at Russia.

2227
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:22,530
Their reaction.
We should be having his anger at our 

2228
01:50:22,530 --> 01:50:22,750
political class.
You know,

2229
01:50:22,751 --> 01:50:24,970
it should be.
And that was the sanches idea,

2230
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:27,610
right?
That's his idea is like if we expose.

2231
01:50:27,970 --> 01:50:29,980
He wrote this essay,
I read an article about it.

2232
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:35,580
If we expose the inner workings of our 
political class and we show that the 

2233
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:40,740
level of deceit,
fullness that is involved in this game 

2234
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:40,740
of chess,
which now people are just saying,

2235
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:41,980
wow,
that's just the way it works.

2236
01:50:41,981 --> 01:50:46,981
That's how it works in the modern world.
You've got to be cutthroat and you've 

2237
01:50:46,981 --> 01:50:48,310
got to lie and you've got to trick and 
you've got to do all this shit.

2238
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:53,580
If we expose them,
then what that hopefully is supposed to 

2239
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:57,690
do is make them reform on their own or 
create what he called a.

2240
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:00,400
The idea is you want it to be very 
expensive to lie.

2241
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:05,401
You want to,
you want to and you and also he's 

2242
01:51:05,401 --> 01:51:07,381
created a situation where all of them 
are living in a terrible world of 

2243
01:51:07,381 --> 01:51:11,911
paranoia,
which I think is kind of hilarious 

2244
01:51:11,911 --> 01:51:12,610
because like a song has done to Hillary 
Clinton,

2245
01:51:12,611 --> 01:51:14,920
what the NSA has done to all of us,
you know,

2246
01:51:14,921 --> 01:51:16,310
like they've,
they,

2247
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:21,310
he has all this fucking data and she 
doesn't know which data he has.

2248
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:26,340
She doesn't know what he's got.
A lot of politicians have no idea what 

2249
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:28,560
wiki leaks has.
That's the strategy behind.

2250
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:32,950
I think that's the strategy behind the 
trickling release of this information is

2251
01:51:32,951 --> 01:51:37,951
because it's like the Japanese water 
torture little drops so that every day 

2252
01:51:37,951 --> 01:51:39,580
they have to sit and think,
fuck man,

2253
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:45,380
they did.
They get those fucking pictures in the 

2254
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:45,380
Bohemian.

2255
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:45,650
You know what the rumors are,
right?

2256
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:47,390
Do you know the rumors about to release 
that?

2257
01:51:47,391 --> 01:51:50,060
There's going to be a bomb dropped on 
November first.

2258
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:55,390
That's the super awesome conspiracy 
rumor deluxe of the day that on November

2259
01:51:55,491 --> 01:52:00,410
first anonymous wiki leaks guy fawkes 
himself,

2260
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:05,440
someone is going to drop some huge 
fucking information bomb that's going to

2261
01:52:06,321 --> 01:52:10,540
make Hillary Clinton is like,
they're the rumor.

2262
01:52:10,550 --> 01:52:15,550
Of course I'm must conspiracy theorists.
Gonna disqualify for the you the 

2263
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:18,730
election.
I don't even know if that's possible at 

2264
01:52:18,730 --> 01:52:18,930
this point because she got away with 
that email scandal.

2265
01:52:18,931 --> 01:52:23,931
Shit.
Like that email stuff would have put 

2266
01:52:23,931 --> 01:52:23,931
anybody else in jail.
Right?

2267
01:52:23,931 --> 01:52:27,100
I mean I posted something on twitter the
other day about a soldier who took 

2268
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:31,961
photographs with his camera on his phone
of some inner workings of a submarine 

2269
01:52:32,391 --> 01:52:35,350
and he's going to jail because of it.
Just took photographs.

2270
01:52:35,470 --> 01:52:39,020
So what she did was infinitely worse.

2271
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:44,020
They're both government officials.
That soldier and Hillary Clinton are 

2272
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,230
both government employees.
Right?

2273
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,510
The only difference being,
of course she's elected.

2274
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,040
Yeah,
that's it.

2275
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:50,120
I mean,
other than that,

2276
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:51,290
I mean he works for the government.
He's.

2277
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:56,560
But his responsibility to adhere to the 
rules has way more consequence than 

2278
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,130
hers,
which she did with those emails,

2279
01:52:58,131 --> 01:53:01,340
like no one is.
No one is denying that it was illegal.

2280
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:04,490
No one is saying it was fine and heard 
crazy.

2281
01:53:04,491 --> 01:53:09,491
Talk about it being 30,000
yoga emails just exacerbates the whole 

2282
01:53:10,101 --> 01:53:11,000
thing.
It's like,

2283
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:16,060
listen,
if they're going to find out it wasn't 

2284
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:16,190
really yoga and then what?
Then what are you going to say?

2285
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:17,240
What are you going to say?
Yeah.

2286
01:53:17,241 --> 01:53:21,920
There were some yogi emails.
There was two of them to Yogi emails and

2287
01:53:21,930 --> 01:53:24,860
then there's 28,000
about Bengazi.

2288
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,050
Alright.
Alright then.

2289
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:28,930
Then what happens?
There's 20,000.

2290
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:33,970
Oh Man.
Using drones on Julian Assan made she 

2291
01:53:33,970 --> 01:53:33,970
wanted a drone.
Him?

2292
01:53:34,150 --> 01:53:34,720
Yeah.
Well,

2293
01:53:34,721 --> 01:53:38,580
I mean I think I'm joking.
I'm not defending either.

2294
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:40,510
These creeps.
They're creepy to me.

2295
01:53:40,511 --> 01:53:42,970
Both of them.
Give me the fucking heebie-jeebies man.

2296
01:53:42,971 --> 01:53:47,971
But like I do not.
Julian assange's you're talking about 

2297
01:53:47,971 --> 01:53:47,971
trump and hillary,
right?

2298
01:53:47,971 --> 01:53:48,370
No,
I'm talking about that monster.

2299
01:53:48,371 --> 01:53:50,500
Julian fucking assigned.
We gives you the creeps.

2300
01:53:50,501 --> 01:53:51,190
No,
I'm kidding.

2301
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:54,270
No,
I love him.

2302
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:58,660
I have a plan to help Julian Assan 
escape.

2303
01:53:59,290 --> 01:54:01,750
I think I know a way to get him out of 
that fucking embassy.

2304
01:54:01,751 --> 01:54:04,360
If you wanted to leave like I know how 
you could do it because you know,

2305
01:54:04,361 --> 01:54:06,370
you see,
so here's what I would do.

2306
01:54:06,670 --> 01:54:07,720
So like,
you know,

2307
01:54:07,721 --> 01:54:12,721
you see him come out to that little 
balcony and kind of look at ms dot sad 

2308
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:12,721
way,
like he doesn't have an internet,

2309
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:15,280
fucking sucks.
So here's what you do.

2310
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:20,790
Schedule one of those flash mobs were 
10,000,

2311
01:54:21,131 --> 01:54:23,040
20,000,
30,000.

2312
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:25,780
I'm putting my life on the line here.
Please fucking Clinton and trump.

2313
01:54:25,781 --> 01:54:30,781
Don't kill me for saying this.
I will only want everyone to love 

2314
01:54:30,781 --> 01:54:30,781
windover.
Get like 10,000

2315
01:54:30,781 --> 01:54:32,350
people to gather around that fucking 
embassy.

2316
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:35,410
Wearing that guy fawkes mask the 
anonymous mass.

2317
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:38,500
They're all wearing the anonymous mask 
and certain outfit.

2318
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,000
Are you?
Do you have a side business in anonymous

2319
01:54:41,001 --> 01:54:41,540
masks?

2320
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:44,290
What guy?
Fox business.

2321
01:54:45,010 --> 01:54:47,650
Duncan trussell dog guy.
Fawkes mask.

2322
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:50,340
It goes to my foundation of show.
So the,

2323
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:55,520
the idea is you get them to gather 
around it and some kind of mask and 

2324
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:57,220
dress like Julian assange and then just 
throw a mask.

2325
01:54:57,460 --> 01:55:02,460
So he liked jumps out into this mob of 
people all dress like him wearing this 

2326
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:04,450
fucking guy fawkes mask and just 
vanishes into the crowd.

2327
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:06,460
That's a movie that's mission 
impossible.

2328
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:08,290
So yeah,
I think it would work with.

2329
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:10,390
I think because he's got access to the 
balcony,

2330
01:55:10,391 --> 01:55:15,391
it means you could get down.
You just got to pop a laddered up real 

2331
01:55:15,391 --> 01:55:15,391
quick.
Everyone's dressed like fucking.

2332
01:55:15,391 --> 01:55:17,650
And not everyone looks like a sand with 
the anonymous mask on.

2333
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:18,760
Yeah,
look at that.

2334
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,400
Pop right off of that fucking balcony.
The balcony.

2335
01:55:21,401 --> 01:55:23,190
So close.
So close.

2336
01:55:23,191 --> 01:55:28,191
Just dive into a sea of people dressed 
in the anonymous masks and get just 

2337
01:55:28,191 --> 01:55:29,440
fucking vanish in a time.
Shave your fucking head.

2338
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:30,360
Get them face.

2339
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:33,760
How does that Guy Sleep?
I mean,

2340
01:55:33,761 --> 01:55:38,761
wouldn't you be freaked out?
The fact that his door is that close to 

2341
01:55:39,430 --> 01:55:41,230
the the.
I mean that's where the door is.

2342
01:55:41,231 --> 01:55:42,310
That's where the ground is,
right?

2343
01:55:42,311 --> 01:55:43,920
Anybody could just jump there and climb 
in.

2344
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:49,430
This guy is hated.
Hated by some of the biggest world 

2345
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:50,340
leaders ever.
That's his little tiny balcony.

2346
01:55:50,341 --> 01:55:52,680
You live in a little equity embassy in 
the.

2347
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:57,860
Yeah,
it's Sun London and he asked to stay in 

2348
01:55:57,860 --> 01:56:00,921
that building.
You know how he feels when he's in that 

2349
01:56:00,921 --> 01:56:02,871
building.
He's on foreign soil and they can 

2350
01:56:02,871 --> 01:56:05,361
invade.
It is insane and he's been there for 

2351
01:56:05,361 --> 01:56:06,600
four fucking years.
Not going outside.

2352
01:56:06,601 --> 01:56:11,601
You Know How that Guy Fucking sleeps?
He sleeps like a fucking hero when that 

2353
01:56:11,601 --> 01:56:15,261
guy goes to bed,
he goes to bed in the way that somebody 

2354
01:56:15,261 --> 01:56:16,200
who is like,
I'm actually trying to help my species.

2355
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:18,630
You see them dance.
I know.

2356
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:23,420
Pulled it up this anytime we'd pull up 
Julian assange's dancing.

2357
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:24,810
No.
So nothing wrong with them.

2358
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:27,840
Nothing wrong with it.
It's just you have to,

2359
01:56:27,870 --> 01:56:32,870
when you see someone dance like this,
you have to always think God is a god.

2360
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:37,620
He's a goth.
Yeah,

2361
01:56:37,621 --> 01:56:39,150
I mean there's nothing wrong with 
dancing like that.

2362
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:40,590
There's nothing wrong with dance like 
that,

2363
01:56:40,591 --> 01:56:44,130
but you got to be aware of everything.
That's something to be aware of.

2364
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:48,240
This is how massage dancing and he 
dances by himself like this,

2365
01:56:49,110 --> 01:56:54,110
so that's another thing.
It's not just he's moving out into the 

2366
01:56:54,110 --> 01:56:55,410
dance floor,
dancing by himself now.

2367
01:56:55,650 --> 01:56:57,120
Now let's,
let's be honest.

2368
01:56:57,121 --> 01:56:59,920
He could easily be on drugs,
which cases is all forgivable behavior,

2369
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:04,940
definitely on drugs.
He may be on ecstasy right now or molly 

2370
01:57:04,940 --> 01:57:05,970
or it might be stoned out of his fucking
mind on some pot.

2371
01:57:05,971 --> 01:57:10,070
Cookies are on acid or something,
but he's.

2372
01:57:10,150 --> 01:57:13,140
He's dancing and a very,
very strange what?

2373
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:18,170
Goth dance.
He's doing a goth gothic dancing and 

2374
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:18,170
there's nothing wrong with it,
man.

2375
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:19,020
Look,
I chant strange.

2376
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:23,730
He's fucking weird on my other videos.
I mean,

2377
01:57:23,731 --> 01:57:24,420
people are weird.

2378
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:25,800
You know,
there's nothing wrong with dancing.

2379
01:57:25,801 --> 01:57:28,350
Weird,
but you should know that too.

2380
01:57:28,351 --> 01:57:28,920
Listen,
man,

2381
01:57:28,950 --> 01:57:31,620
Kaiser View,
whenever I hear anything about Julian is

2382
01:57:31,621 --> 01:57:33,810
dodge.
I do think about that dance video,

2383
01:57:33,811 --> 01:57:36,570
which God forbid my fucking dancing's 
were,

2384
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:37,810
God forbid.
Yes.

2385
01:57:37,811 --> 01:57:39,570
There's nothing wrong with the way 
dances.

2386
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:42,800
I'm joking,
man.

2387
01:57:43,310 --> 01:57:48,310
People don't.
I put up a thing today about a flat 

2388
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:49,350
earth and people thought that I was 
serious about the flat earth.

2389
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:51,840
I put up,
put up this thing on instagram about all

2390
01:57:51,841 --> 01:57:56,841
the.
The evidence that you're being 

2391
01:57:56,841 --> 01:57:58,131
brainwashed and one of them was if you 
really believe that the sun is millions 

2392
01:57:58,131 --> 01:58:00,330
of miles away,
how to tell if you're brainwashed,

2393
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:02,790
do you believe the earth is spinning a 
thousand miles an hour,

2394
01:58:02,791 --> 01:58:07,791
but you can't feel it.
You believe the oceans are curving 

2395
01:58:07,791 --> 01:58:09,270
because gravity in air quotes,
but you can't measure it.

2396
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:14,390
Right?
Leave ships disappearing over the 

2397
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:14,940
horizon or proof of the globe and not 
due to perspective.

2398
01:58:15,230 --> 01:58:20,230
You believe that pilots would not have 
to account for the earth curvature or 

2399
01:58:20,230 --> 01:58:20,710
spin while flying.
Man.

2400
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,160
Yeah.
This is.

2401
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:24,990
Tell them at one time was getting.
I was like,

2402
01:58:24,991 --> 01:58:28,710
I was getting a massage and the massage 
therapist with a flatter Arthur.

2403
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,540
Oh No.
It was the past.

2404
01:58:30,541 --> 01:58:33,840
I mean it's like what's better?
It's like I'm talking massages sometimes

2405
01:58:33,841 --> 01:58:35,400
suck,
but like she say,

2406
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:41,080
what's funny about it is as she's like 
explaining flat earth theory to me,

2407
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:47,130
I wanted to argue with her and then I 
realized my understanding of cosmology 

2408
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:52,500
is so terrible.
I couldn't come up with a persuasive 

2409
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:55,420
argument against it because it's like,
well,

2410
01:58:55,421 --> 01:59:00,421
the conspiracy argument is the best 
because you would think that everybody 

2411
01:59:00,421 --> 01:59:02,260
would have to be in on it.
Everybody who's ever been apart of space

2412
01:59:02,261 --> 01:59:04,720
travel,
whether it's the Russians or the Chinese

2413
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:09,721
or the Americans,
anyone who has ever been an 

2414
01:59:09,721 --> 01:59:10,030
astrophysicist success to on it.

2415
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:15,510
This was the best fucking buddy.
What was that was someone saying I was a

2416
01:59:15,971 --> 01:59:17,470
sellout because,
uh,

2417
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:22,500
because of my flat earth hate and we 
know where your checks were being 

2418
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:22,500
cashed,
they were being there.

2419
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:27,520
I'm getting like I'm getting shut up.
Money for the round earth,

2420
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:29,900
the earth.
God,

2421
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,560
I'd love to see that meeting.
That's a fun.

2422
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:38,610
I'd love to see that meeting were like 
you and sas men are sitting with like 

2423
01:59:38,610 --> 01:59:38,860
these reptilians and they're like,
listen Joe,

2424
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:44,340
you know the earth is flat.
We know the earth angle at check in 

2425
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:47,851
front of you and then go and you go and 
take the check next,

2426
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:55,360
next,
next.

2427
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:56,530
Yeah.
That's.

2428
01:59:56,910 --> 02:00:00,550
Come in.
Let me ask you something for real,

2429
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:01,870
for real,
for real,

2430
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:03,880
for real man,
for real,

2431
02:00:03,881 --> 02:00:06,310
Bro.
If you knew the earth was flat,

2432
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:11,420
so I don't know how you knew like like 
fucking Dana White and are the people 

2433
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:11,420
who run the UFC.

2434
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:11,680
They were like,
look man,

2435
02:00:11,710 --> 02:00:13,630
it actually the first to tell you.
Okay,

2436
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:18,780
but it can be broadcasting.
If let's say you knew the earth was 

2437
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:18,780
flat,
don't go too far,

2438
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:20,650
but let's say the lizards did visit.
Let's say they did visit you.

2439
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:24,760
What's your price to be a shill?
50 bucks.

2440
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:25,840
What?
50.

2441
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:27,820
50.
50 is a good meal somewhere.

2442
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:29,620
Get a steak.
Glass one.

2443
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:31,570
I'll ask her a lot.
I don't want to die.

2444
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:33,320
Look,
you guys are lizard.

2445
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:35,110
The lizard people.
You're all powerful.

2446
02:00:35,111 --> 02:00:38,170
You're going to run this thing anyway.
Just 50 bucks.

2447
02:00:39,590 --> 02:00:41,410
You don't want them to think you're 
unreasonable.

2448
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:42,640
Oh,
he wants $50,000,000

2449
02:00:42,770 --> 02:00:44,400
or we just fucking eat him.
Dude.

2450
02:00:44,401 --> 02:00:49,401
I just eat.
I like fishing this stuff out of you 

2451
02:00:49,401 --> 02:00:51,481
because it spawns youtube videos.
It's really funny for me being a 

2452
02:00:52,061 --> 02:00:57,061
satanist.
Someone will to confirm with you guys 

2453
02:00:57,061 --> 02:00:57,510
are Illuminati because you did that 
thing at the UFC.

2454
02:00:57,510 --> 02:00:58,810
Are Illumina,
illumina?

2455
02:00:58,811 --> 02:01:02,950
I'm in the Illuminati.
I didn't even know I am in the Illumina.

2456
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:06,310
It's great.
Is it good to get good benefits?

2457
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:09,160
What benefits?
Yeah.

2458
02:01:09,610 --> 02:01:11,260
Okay.
Tell me later.

2459
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:13,630
Tell me later about the benefits.
Maybe.

2460
02:01:13,690 --> 02:01:17,210
I don't know him.
Don't ask me my numerology.

2461
02:01:17,220 --> 02:01:18,310
Is I real?
Yes.

2462
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:19,510
Ooh,
interesting.

2463
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:21,040
What do you mean?
Why?

2464
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:22,870
Are you a mason?
A Free Mason?

2465
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:28,200
Yes.
Is there any other kind of and fucking 

2466
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:34,830
pyramids and then you kissed the kissing
part was probably one of the greatest 

2467
02:01:34,830 --> 02:01:36,040
moments in UFC history.
That was great man.

2468
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:37,780
Oh Shit.
Can I tell you something?

2469
02:01:37,781 --> 02:01:38,860
I just found out.
Yes.

2470
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,040
Okay man.
This is actually

2471
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,780
really cool.
You should research this.

2472
02:01:42,050 --> 02:01:44,030
Did I tell you about the cacophony 
society?

2473
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:45,800
No,
it's okay man.

2474
02:01:45,801 --> 02:01:50,801
So the guys who like at least partially 
started burning man are called the 

2475
02:01:51,231 --> 02:01:56,231
cacophony society and it was this group 
of people that do the funniest fucking 

2476
02:01:57,201 --> 02:01:59,870
things together and it's really 
fascinating.

2477
02:01:59,871 --> 02:02:01,640
They call it culture jamming,
but like,

2478
02:02:02,070 --> 02:02:03,410
uh,
for example,

2479
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:05,480
they do this.
If you ever heard of the salmon run.

2480
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:10,750
No,
it's that they dress up and matt giant 

2481
02:02:10,750 --> 02:02:11,330
salmon outfits and run the wrong way and
racist.

2482
02:02:14,810 --> 02:02:16,430
That's Hilarious,
dude.

2483
02:02:17,010 --> 02:02:20,420
Run towards the crowd.
They run the opposite direction.

2484
02:02:20,421 --> 02:02:24,650
So you'll see a marathon and salmon are 
running like that is so funny.

2485
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:28,390
That's so funny.
That's the cacophony going upstream.

2486
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:31,190
They're high fiving people.
People let them go through that.

2487
02:02:31,191 --> 02:02:32,130
I'm mad.
That's good.

2488
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:34,820
That's the cacophony society man.
They uh,

2489
02:02:35,450 --> 02:02:39,100
but these are the guys who started 
burning man and chuck Palahniuk.

2490
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:43,320
That's where he got the inspiration for 
fight club because he was running for no

2491
02:02:43,810 --> 02:02:46,670
coffee society because he was in the 
cacophony society.

2492
02:02:46,671 --> 02:02:47,900
He was,
he's one of them,

2493
02:02:48,290 --> 02:02:53,290
but like the,
their motto is you may already be a 

2494
02:02:53,290 --> 02:02:56,030
member and anybody can start their own 
branch,

2495
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:58,370
but it's like really,
really funny.

2496
02:02:58,371 --> 02:03:00,320
Like if you look up all the stuff 
they've done,

2497
02:03:00,321 --> 02:03:01,400
man,
it's really trippy.

2498
02:03:01,401 --> 02:03:02,270
Like they said,
uh,

2499
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:03,380
they,
uh,

2500
02:03:03,381 --> 02:03:08,381
one of the things they did was they set 
up clowns at every stop along the bus 

2501
02:03:09,801 --> 02:03:14,270
route so that every time the bus pick 
people up and picked up a new clown,

2502
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:16,670
but the clowns wouldn't acknowledge each
other.

2503
02:03:16,671 --> 02:03:21,671
Like they just happened to be getting on
the same bus constraint.

2504
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,370
It's cool though because what it did 
like,

2505
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,190
I mean I'm not going to try to get into 
their,

2506
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:30,250
uh,
their theory about it because they 

2507
02:03:30,250 --> 02:03:30,250
actually have a pretty deep 
philosophical like,

2508
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:35,360
or it seems to be a fairly deep 
philosophy that a lot of it's really 

2509
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:38,231
hard to understand for me,
but a data ism is part of it and this 

2510
02:03:38,231 --> 02:03:42,311
concept at this thing called the zone 
actually hocking based temporary 

2511
02:03:42,311 --> 02:03:46,631
autonomous zone is kind of related to 
this idea that you can create these 

2512
02:03:46,631 --> 02:03:51,461
little bubbles that temporarily sort of 
a where the normal rules of society just

2513
02:03:53,241 --> 02:03:54,620
don't exist in that moment.

2514
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:58,490
And so people who get to be in that 
bubble with you get to experience a kind

2515
02:03:58,491 --> 02:04:03,491
of respite from the never ending flow of
society which can produce like huge 

2516
02:04:03,491 --> 02:04:08,471
changes in a person's life to suddenly 
no longer be afflicted with the humdrum 

2517
02:04:08,471 --> 02:04:13,390
normal day to day.
A materialistic consumeristic bullshit 

2518
02:04:13,401 --> 02:04:18,401
that we call everyday life to create a 
tiny little bubble where that doesn't 

2519
02:04:18,401 --> 02:04:19,160
exist and where you're like,
there are two rules.

2520
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:24,580
They don't.
I don't know if you even call them 

2521
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:25,721
rules,
but the rules are you don't do a 

2522
02:04:25,721 --> 02:04:27,080
cacophonous event for money and you 
don't do it to promote your religion,

2523
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:32,380
so you're doing this for no reason other
than like subversion for subversion 

2524
02:04:33,231 --> 02:04:34,880
sake,
so there's no.

2525
02:04:34,890 --> 02:04:39,890
The profit that you're getting from it 
is just the incredible moment that you 

2526
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:43,950
find yourself in is salmon outfit 
running the opposite way,

2527
02:04:43,951 --> 02:04:48,951
but what it does is it temporarily 
disrupts the hypnotic trance that a lot 

2528
02:04:52,381 --> 02:04:55,200
of people are in,
like when they're living,

2529
02:04:55,230 --> 02:04:55,900
you know,
you're just in.

2530
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:58,020
This was on by design.
That's what they're trying to do,

2531
02:04:58,021 --> 02:05:03,021
or they're just having fun.
It looks like they're just having fun 

2532
02:05:03,021 --> 02:05:03,870
running against the crowd of marathon 
runners.

2533
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:05,480
So salmon outfits.
Yeah,

2534
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:08,370
that it is for fun,
but then there's a theory behind it.

2535
02:05:08,371 --> 02:05:13,371
It's not actually like this is something
that they've written out and 

2536
02:05:13,371 --> 02:05:15,840
contemplated it and acted on.
There's a great book called Tales of the

2537
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,820
Cacophony Society that I'm reading.
That's so fucking funny.

2538
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:20,730
How long have you been around for a.
they've been around since the.

2539
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:25,880
They were pre burning man,
so I guess they'd been around for like 

2540
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:27,480
mid eighties or something like that and 
prior to that there was something called

2541
02:05:27,481 --> 02:05:29,760
the suicide club,
which was,

2542
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:34,020
or they're an offshoot of this group in 
San Francisco called the suicide club,

2543
02:05:34,021 --> 02:05:39,021
which was like an actual secrets society
that if you wanted to be a member you 

2544
02:05:39,511 --> 02:05:42,420
had to get your affairs in order like 
you were going to commit suicide.

2545
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:46,710
Oh yeah.
It's really cool and like really cool.

2546
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:51,920
But uh,
but then the cacophony society sort of 

2547
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:55,341
emerge.
Their history is fucking hilarious 

2548
02:05:55,341 --> 02:05:55,730
though.
The history of them is so funny and like

2549
02:05:55,890 --> 02:06:00,890
if you look at like the early burning 
man that the confidence we're involved 

2550
02:06:00,890 --> 02:06:04,461
in whole Lee shit,
they have like a drive by shooting 

2551
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:08,460
range.
So like they would like drive in cars,

2552
02:06:08,461 --> 02:06:10,110
blasting it targets.

2553
02:06:12,610 --> 02:06:17,610
Dude.
They were launching flaming fucking 

2554
02:06:17,610 --> 02:06:21,360
pianos out of catapults out in the 
middle of the desert like they were and 

2555
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:22,860
people were getting hurt.
Man.

2556
02:06:22,861 --> 02:06:27,861
I wonder why,
but like they were like they were bad 

2557
02:06:27,861 --> 02:06:32,361
ass.
And it sounds like if hunter s Thompson 

2558
02:06:32,361 --> 02:06:32,361
started a religion.
Exactly.

2559
02:06:32,361 --> 02:06:33,630
That's a great way to put it in and I'll
tell you,

2560
02:06:33,631 --> 02:06:38,631
man,
he probably knew of them and if he 

2561
02:06:38,631 --> 02:06:38,631
didn't know of them he would have been 
like,

2562
02:06:38,631 --> 02:06:38,631
oh,
I'm one of them.

2563
02:06:38,631 --> 02:06:39,090
And like,
can you be,

2564
02:06:39,091 --> 02:06:40,800
you can be one of them.
You don't have to even join up.

2565
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:43,550
You start your own.
But we started a branch went today.

2566
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:45,180
Right?
When did we start one?

2567
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:47,040
Well,
we just started a second branch.

2568
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:48,610
I started a branch.
We'd,

2569
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:49,490
we,
I say we,

2570
02:06:49,491 --> 02:06:54,491
I,
we will what's called the Ukrainian 

2571
02:06:54,491 --> 02:06:57,231
branch of the La Cacophony Society.
And we a Ukrainian Ukrainian.

2572
02:06:57,960 --> 02:06:59,970
Well,
we had the last meeting we had our,

2573
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:01,950
we sell.
We had our final meeting,

2574
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:06,090
a Gelson's on hyperion.
So here's a meetings.

2575
02:07:06,150 --> 02:07:08,730
Well we had our last meeting so we had 
the final meeting.

2576
02:07:08,731 --> 02:07:13,731
And how many meetings did you have?
All told one who's we?

2577
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:17,940
Me and a bunch of people.
I just put it out on twitter.

2578
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:19,140
Who were the people?
Me,

2579
02:07:19,141 --> 02:07:20,730
Brendan Walsh.
Uh,

2580
02:07:20,731 --> 02:07:24,570
and then like a group of like some other
people from burning man who I know.

2581
02:07:24,571 --> 02:07:26,280
And then just some people who responded 
to the tweet.

2582
02:07:26,281 --> 02:07:29,910
But we all met at Galston in pajamas.
We met,

2583
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:36,160
we met at Gelson's that we met at 
Gelson's,

2584
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:39,880
gnashing and imbibing bar and pajamas.
And then,

2585
02:07:39,881 --> 02:07:41,290
uh,
and then we did,

2586
02:07:41,291 --> 02:07:42,820
uh,
we did.

2587
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:45,340
Uh,
so what we,

2588
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:50,350
the plan was we met there,
we had drinks and it was automatically 

2589
02:07:50,350 --> 02:07:50,380
the most.
It was so weird driving to do it.

2590
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:51,280
I'm like,
well,

2591
02:07:51,281 --> 02:07:52,770
you definitely have wash your mind,
man.

2592
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:55,450
You're out of your fucking mind.
Like this good coffee idea.

2593
02:07:55,451 --> 02:08:00,451
It's crazy.
I don't know why you're fucking doing 

2594
02:08:00,451 --> 02:08:00,451
this.
So I,

2595
02:08:00,451 --> 02:08:00,451
I,
uh,

2596
02:08:00,451 --> 02:08:03,960
I ended up thinking like,
you feel crazy driving the Gelson's in 

2597
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:05,140
pajamas.
And so we,

2598
02:08:05,141 --> 02:08:08,770
uh,
we fucking get there and all of a sudden

2599
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:12,250
the people at the bar looking like,
what the fuck is happening?

2600
02:08:12,251 --> 02:08:17,251
Like suddenly there's this group of 
people standing at the bar and fucking 

2601
02:08:17,251 --> 02:08:20,581
pajamas and then in your pajamas,
look like I wore captain America 

2602
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:23,380
Pajamas.
So fuck.

2603
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:26,010
Yeah.
But then.

2604
02:08:26,050 --> 02:08:26,620
So then,
uh,

2605
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:27,640
so then,
uh,

2606
02:08:27,850 --> 02:08:32,850
but then what we did is Brendan Walsh,
because he was like,

2607
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:35,590
we had him give this speech because like
I was like,

2608
02:08:35,591 --> 02:08:37,960
everybody,
I don't want this meeting,

2609
02:08:37,961 --> 02:08:42,961
our final meeting to be caught up in how
Brendan Walsh ruined the Ukrainian 

2610
02:08:43,121 --> 02:08:44,890
branch,
the La Cacophony society.

2611
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:49,890
So let's just not think about that.
And then he gives a speech and he reads 

2612
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:52,480
the entirety of Tiger Woods cheating 
apology.

2613
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:57,490
Suddenly this dude in pajamas is reading
tiger woods,

2614
02:08:57,491 --> 02:09:02,491
cheating apology in front of a group of 
people in Pajamas who whenever Brendan 

2615
02:09:02,491 --> 02:09:04,660
would say one of like tigers,
weird apologies.

2616
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:08,260
Everyone would applaud and then shush 
ourselves at the same time.

2617
02:09:08,261 --> 02:09:09,740
It's a psych class and like,
shit,

2618
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:10,610
I'm talking,
I'm talking.

2619
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:13,390
And so,
and then we sang,

2620
02:09:14,050 --> 02:09:17,470
we sang fucking do you want to build a 
snowman from frozen?

2621
02:09:18,610 --> 02:09:20,660
And then we fucking left.
And both.

2622
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:22,700
Did you film it?
What we have?

2623
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:25,000
Yeah.
We have to just film a film of this.

2624
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:26,360
I have a film of it.
I'll send it to you.

2625
02:09:26,361 --> 02:09:27,680
I don't know where it is.
Not Online,

2626
02:09:27,681 --> 02:09:28,790
but,
but yeah man,

2627
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:30,970
that's what we did in pajamas or 
bathrobes.

2628
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:35,720
We will tell stories of the good times 
our society shared offer,

2629
02:09:35,721 --> 02:09:39,620
final toasts and sing.
Do you want to build a snowman?

2630
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:43,010
Meet at gnashing and imbibing the 
Gelson's bar.

2631
02:09:43,130 --> 02:09:45,440
Holy Shit.
Bring sleeping bags.

2632
02:09:45,890 --> 02:09:47,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

2633
02:09:47,310 --> 02:09:48,500
It's so ridiculous.

2634
02:09:48,610 --> 02:09:50,530
It was.
It was really fucking great.

2635
02:09:50,531 --> 02:09:53,110
We're going to do another meeting that 
we're going to have you are.

2636
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:53,860
Well,
yeah.

2637
02:09:53,861 --> 02:09:57,650
We're going to have a meeting of the new
board,

2638
02:09:57,780 --> 02:10:01,990
the new British new Ukrainian branch of 
the La Cacophony Society,

2639
02:10:01,991 --> 02:10:03,280
but we haven't figured out what that is 
yet.

2640
02:10:03,281 --> 02:10:04,930
But why is it new?
Ukrainian,

2641
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:07,540
Ukrainian?
Well,

2642
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:13,620
I don't know.
The whole point of the thing that,

2643
02:10:14,930 --> 02:10:19,690
which is really beautiful because I got 
on all this shit happened because like I

2644
02:10:19,691 --> 02:10:20,650
realized like,
okay,

2645
02:10:20,651 --> 02:10:25,651
well burning man was the coolest thing 
I've ever experienced and then I trace 

2646
02:10:25,651 --> 02:10:28,541
that back to the cacophony society and 
then I kept hearing this guy's named 

2647
02:10:28,541 --> 02:10:28,600
John Locke,
John Locke.

2648
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:32,950
John Law.
So like I found him and I emailed him.

2649
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,010
Then he just wrote back like,

2650
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,670
yeah,
just call me.

2651
02:10:34,671 --> 02:10:36,470
Here's my number.
And then I called him and then he,

2652
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:39,770
we started talking about how you like,
what the events were like.

2653
02:10:39,771 --> 02:10:43,520
And he said the main thing about it is 
the inclusivity.

2654
02:10:43,521 --> 02:10:46,430
He's like,
this is what makes it so cool is that we

2655
02:10:46,431 --> 02:10:50,600
like that if you really form a branch,
this is more of an experiment,

2656
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:55,840
but if you really do it,
then everybody who decides to 

2657
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:56,270
participate,
they uh,

2658
02:10:56,450 --> 02:10:58,220
they come up with their own events,
you know.

2659
02:10:58,250 --> 02:10:59,630
So like everyone's like,
all right,

2660
02:10:59,631 --> 02:11:01,810
we're going to be doing this next 
Tuesday if you want to come,

2661
02:11:01,811 --> 02:11:02,510
come,
if you don't,

2662
02:11:02,511 --> 02:11:04,760
don't come the following Tuesday we're 
going to be doing this.

2663
02:11:04,761 --> 02:11:09,761
But there's no like pushing people out.
It's like if whoever wants to be 

2664
02:11:09,761 --> 02:11:10,280
involved,
let them be involved.

2665
02:11:10,281 --> 02:11:15,281
And then everyone kind of gathers 
together in this little weird bubble 

2666
02:11:15,281 --> 02:11:15,281
that forms,
which is like,

2667
02:11:15,281 --> 02:11:19,631
dude,
when you're in pajamas at Gelson's 

2668
02:11:19,631 --> 02:11:19,631
watching people,
it's what we were talking about earlier.

2669
02:11:19,631 --> 02:11:21,650
What is the sane way to live?
Right?

2670
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:25,070
So when you're in Gelson's wearing 
pajamas singing,

2671
02:11:25,071 --> 02:11:30,071
do you want to build a snowman?
And you look out and people are kind of 

2672
02:11:30,071 --> 02:11:32,821
like walking with their shoulders down 
to buy their evening groceries and 

2673
02:11:32,821 --> 02:11:33,080
they're just kind of like,
look over at you.

2674
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:35,420
They get the biggest smile on their 
face.

2675
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:36,920
They don't know what's fucking 
happening.

2676
02:11:37,010 --> 02:11:40,220
We don't know what's happening.
But it feels so cool.

2677
02:11:40,221 --> 02:11:45,221
It's like a really like,
exciting moment of like really minor 

2678
02:11:45,221 --> 02:11:49,280
rebellion that has no impact ultimately 
in the flow of society.

2679
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:51,770
But in that tiny moment it's like,
fuck,

2680
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:53,900
we're in zero gravity here,
man.

2681
02:11:57,140 --> 02:12:02,140
Yeah,
I mean a coordinated effort like that 

2682
02:12:02,140 --> 02:12:02,450
with a bunch of people in pajamas 
singing.

2683
02:12:02,451 --> 02:12:06,710
Do you want to build a snowman out of 
nowhere would make everybody smile.

2684
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:08,210
Yeah.
It's one of those like,

2685
02:12:08,211 --> 02:12:10,610
what in the fuck are these guys doing?
And Dude,

2686
02:12:10,611 --> 02:12:12,770
you'd look over because it was right 
next to the Deli.

2687
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:17,800
So like people were like sitting at the 
deli pretending to like be eating their 

2688
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:21,251
dinner.
But they kept looking over it like 

2689
02:12:21,251 --> 02:12:21,251
Brendan giving the Tiger Woods speech.
But that's the other,

2690
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:26,600
that,
that's the other cool idea that they 

2691
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:26,600
came up with man,
which was,

2692
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:30,011
um,
it's like the way we do entertainment 

2693
02:12:30,011 --> 02:12:31,340
right now,
it's so weird because it's like in and I

2694
02:12:31,341 --> 02:12:33,470
guess thank God for it because it's our 
jobs,

2695
02:12:33,471 --> 02:12:38,471
but like people pay a cover and they go 
in and there's the audience that sits in

2696
02:12:39,261 --> 02:12:44,261
the audience and the cut and the 
comedian that talks or the entertainer 

2697
02:12:44,261 --> 02:12:46,610
that talks and there's this weird 
distance between the two and it's like,

2698
02:12:46,850 --> 02:12:49,820
so that relationship between entertainer
and entertained,

2699
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:55,060
their ideas like what's merged together 
so that we're entertaining each other 

2700
02:12:55,060 --> 02:12:59,950
for no reason other than like let's just
fucking get together and like see what 

2701
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:00,320
happens,
you know.

2702
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:05,500
Now this was a nonrisky thing.
Like a lot of their thing is like 

2703
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:05,930
elevate the risk,
elevate the risk,

2704
02:13:05,931 --> 02:13:08,930
elevate the risk to the more you elevate
the risk,

2705
02:13:09,170 --> 02:13:13,010
the more it's like a crucible kind of 
that really brings people together,

2706
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:18,310
which is I think,
the idea of taking people out to the 

2707
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:18,310
fucking desert.
Originally.

2708
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:21,881
It's like let's just take a group of 
these people launched flaming pianos 

2709
02:13:21,881 --> 02:13:24,230
with catapults.
I want to bring up before I forget,

2710
02:13:24,231 --> 02:13:26,720
Brendan Walsh,
one of my favorite stunts that he did.

2711
02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:32,230
This is,
this gives you an indication and what 

2712
02:13:32,230 --> 02:13:32,230
kind of sense of humor has he

2713
02:13:32,230 --> 02:13:35,590
put a fake wholefoods sign in Silver 
Lake?

2714
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:40,800
Yeah.
He wanted people to think that a whole 

2715
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:40,800
foods was coming to.
So,

2716
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:40,800
I mean,
there might be one now,

2717
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:43,890
but he did this a long time ago and 
there was a lot.

2718
02:13:43,891 --> 02:13:48,891
It was an empty lot.
So he had a sign made with the whole 

2719
02:13:48,891 --> 02:13:49,920
foods low put coming soon on it.
Yeah,

2720
02:13:49,921 --> 02:13:53,250
there it is.
And he set it up on the fence and people

2721
02:13:53,251 --> 02:13:54,900
were so psyched.

2722
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:57,110
Yep.
That is Brendan Walsh,

2723
02:13:57,111 --> 02:13:58,860
man.
That's what his sense of humor is.

2724
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:00,560
So cool.
And Dude,

2725
02:14:00,561 --> 02:14:01,490
he uh,
he,

2726
02:14:01,491 --> 02:14:04,160
um,
that's why when I read this book,

2727
02:14:04,161 --> 02:14:05,990
look at this right there.
They'll get the top of it.

2728
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:08,720
Did the silver lake wholefoods hoke 
prankster.

2729
02:14:08,721 --> 02:14:11,270
Reveal his plans on a podcast.
Oh,

2730
02:14:11,271 --> 02:14:14,030
he did it on a.
What the fuck with Mark Marin?

2731
02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:15,560
Thus when he,
uh,

2732
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:17,030
he revealed it,
I guess.

2733
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:19,440
Yeah.
He's so fucking funny.

2734
02:14:19,670 --> 02:14:21,290
Funny Man.
Such a trip.

2735
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:22,240
He said,
dude,

2736
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:27,280
he commits to this.
The other thing he does is he fully 

2737
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:29,180
commits to this and like I like,
I mean I'm not saying like he does a lot

2738
02:14:29,181 --> 02:14:34,181
of stuff and he doesn't care if people 
know and that is to me another really 

2739
02:14:34,641 --> 02:14:37,120
cool thing about.
He's a funny comic too.

2740
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:39,860
Funny Dude.
He's all around funny dude.

2741
02:14:39,861 --> 02:14:41,660
Like fuck dude,
for that kind of Shit.

2742
02:14:41,661 --> 02:14:43,820
Just the way his mind works.
What did he do

2743
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:44,590
recently?
He went,

2744
02:14:44,890 --> 02:14:47,560
he went up somewhere.
I want to say it's the Improv maybe.

2745
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:51,550
And he had them introduce him as one of 
his friends.

2746
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:56,940
He went up and he did that guys act 
jokes.

2747
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:06,020
That's so fucking silly.
Commit to 100 percent man because like 

2748
02:15:06,020 --> 02:15:10,881
when you're standing and fucking pajamas
and a Goddamn Coulson's reading tiger 

2749
02:15:10,881 --> 02:15:14,811
woods,
10 minute speech and you don't back 

2750
02:15:14,811 --> 02:15:14,811
down.
It's cool.

2751
02:15:14,811 --> 02:15:14,820
But anyway.
Yeah,

2752
02:15:14,821 --> 02:15:17,850
tails for the cacophony society.
You guys look into it man,

2753
02:15:17,851 --> 02:15:20,100
because it's pretty cool and anyone can 
form a branch.

2754
02:15:20,430 --> 02:15:22,650
Anyone listening,
you can start your own branch.

2755
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:25,020
You could just do it and it's really 
fun.

2756
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:30,140
Sounds like fun.
I don't know about the Ukrainian thing 

2757
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:30,140
though.
Well why might have copyright on that,

2758
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:32,640
what might not be able to call something
you cry and that was our last meeting.

2759
02:15:32,641 --> 02:15:36,390
So it doesn't matter when you resolved 
your differences with the Ukraine.

2760
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:38,340
So we'll let it go.
It's over.

2761
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:44,300
You know,
you were talking about burning man 

2762
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:46,700
before the podcast.
We were on the phone we were talking 

2763
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:46,700
about and I said,
dude,

2764
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:48,870
we shouldn't even talk about it until we
talk about it on the podcast because you

2765
02:15:48,871 --> 02:15:49,080
were.

2766
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:54,080
You were ranting about burning man is if
you had seen the messiah year bounding 

2767
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:54,080
utopia.
No,

2768
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:55,710
it wasn't a near beating at all.
No,

2769
02:15:55,711 --> 02:15:58,230
it was great.
Your look at that picture.

2770
02:15:58,240 --> 02:16:00,290
That's fucking cool.
Like that.

2771
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:05,310
That the right behind that is a right 
behind that is this incredible.

2772
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:11,310
Just never ending field of art.
So by that those lights,

2773
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:16,400
those lights are all led lights shining 
on the fucking art that people are 

2774
02:16:17,671 --> 02:16:22,230
spending all year building for.
No other reason than to fucking bring it

2775
02:16:22,231 --> 02:16:25,750
out there and give people like just 
beautiful,

2776
02:16:25,770 --> 02:16:27,820
beautiful art.
Like that idea.

2777
02:16:27,910 --> 02:16:29,590
I had no idea.
It was so lit up.

2778
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:30,160
Oh my

2779
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:31,780
God.
I mean that you can't see.

2780
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:36,820
The crazy thing about burning man is you
can't capture it in pictures.

2781
02:16:36,821 --> 02:16:39,820
Like you've just got to go there because
if you see the pictures,

2782
02:16:39,821 --> 02:16:42,340
it kind of seems ridiculous or dusty or 
whatever.

2783
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:47,700
But my God man should do a documentary.
Has Anybody done a documentary on 

2784
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:47,700
Berlin?
Yeah,

2785
02:16:48,190 --> 02:16:51,190
there's tons of people of color,
but we should do a documentary on it.

2786
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:52,360
Dude,
how about this?

2787
02:16:52,361 --> 02:16:57,361
How about just like we should take 
someone to burning man would never go 

2788
02:16:57,361 --> 02:16:57,361
to.
I have an idea.

2789
02:16:57,361 --> 02:16:58,810
You just don't.
You just come.

2790
02:16:59,170 --> 02:17:00,760
That's all.
No documentary.

2791
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:04,360
You just come and we'll spend a week 
having fun there because dude,

2792
02:17:04,510 --> 02:17:05,800
you like.
Here's an example.

2793
02:17:06,010 --> 02:17:09,310
This is one of my favorite fucking 
places there that it's called.

2794
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:11,950
There's a.
So it's all free bars,

2795
02:17:12,430 --> 02:17:14,080
bars,
people put up free bars.

2796
02:17:14,081 --> 02:17:14,920
It's free booze.

2797
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:15,430
Nothing.
No,

2798
02:17:15,431 --> 02:17:19,840
you can't buy anything there.
So one of the bars,

2799
02:17:19,841 --> 02:17:22,650
and I forgive me if I,
if I say the title wrong,

2800
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:24,370
because now it's a little fuzzy in my 
mind.

2801
02:17:24,371 --> 02:17:29,371
It was my favorite bar and always called
the something like the Ministry of 

2802
02:17:31,030 --> 02:17:36,030
Disinformation,
but it's set up to look like an 

2803
02:17:36,030 --> 02:17:36,030
information booth and so we're riding by
and these you're ride around bicycles.

2804
02:17:36,030 --> 02:17:37,810
My friends who have been there forever,
they're like,

2805
02:17:37,811 --> 02:17:42,811
dude,
go to that bar and they'll just lie to 

2806
02:17:42,811 --> 02:17:44,701
you.
Like that's how they do the bartender 

2807
02:17:44,701 --> 02:17:44,701
just lie to you.
That's alert.

2808
02:17:44,701 --> 02:17:48,120
So like you go there and you like,
so like you sit in there so good at 

2809
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:50,170
lying to the point where,
because everyone's knows that they lie,

2810
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:54,760
so people come there to get lied to and 
so like you go there to get lied to,

2811
02:17:54,761 --> 02:17:59,761
but they know everyone knows that 
they're lying and they flow you in to 

2812
02:17:59,761 --> 02:17:59,950
thinking they're done with the lying 
part.

2813
02:17:59,950 --> 02:18:04,950
Right?
So like we're sitting there drinking 

2814
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:07,210
may,
being core sitting there drinking and 

2815
02:18:07,210 --> 02:18:07,210
like,
you know,

2816
02:18:07,210 --> 02:18:08,440
the guys made some pretty obvious lies 
and they weren't drinking.

2817
02:18:08,441 --> 02:18:09,010
It's like,
hey.

2818
02:18:09,370 --> 02:18:11,110
So we were really feels like,
oh yeah,

2819
02:18:11,111 --> 02:18:12,760
okay.
Now we're just talking like friends.

2820
02:18:12,761 --> 02:18:13,650
He's like,
say,

2821
02:18:13,690 --> 02:18:18,690
Hey,
do you guys want to try some of vodka 

2822
02:18:18,690 --> 02:18:18,690
that like,
uh,

2823
02:18:18,690 --> 02:18:19,780
I home brew?
And were like,

2824
02:18:19,781 --> 02:18:21,040
yeah,
we'd love to try some.

2825
02:18:21,041 --> 02:18:24,970
And so like he pours it and we drink it,
and he were like,

2826
02:18:24,971 --> 02:18:26,710
wow,
this is actually really good man.

2827
02:18:26,711 --> 02:18:28,240
You should,
you could probably sell this stuff,

2828
02:18:28,241 --> 02:18:29,260
like where you're going to start selling
it.

2829
02:18:29,261 --> 02:18:31,000
And he's like,
yeah,

2830
02:18:31,001 --> 02:18:32,080
yeah,
we're a,

2831
02:18:32,110 --> 02:18:37,110
we worked out a deal with South Korea.
You slap an American flag on anything 

2832
02:18:37,110 --> 02:18:38,980
out there and they'll buy anything.
Like,

2833
02:18:38,981 --> 02:18:39,700
wait,
wait,

2834
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:42,800
oh wait,
you're still lying to us like,

2835
02:18:42,810 --> 02:18:43,900
you didn't make this vodka.

2836
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:44,770
You're just lying.
He's like,

2837
02:18:44,771 --> 02:18:45,430
no,
I'm serious.

2838
02:18:45,431 --> 02:18:46,030
I'm serious.
Look,

2839
02:18:46,031 --> 02:18:46,510
look,
look.

2840
02:18:46,870 --> 02:18:49,480
Then he pulls his phone up and there's 
pictures of it.

2841
02:18:49,540 --> 02:18:53,830
This is this still that I use to build 
it and it's this ridiculous still.

2842
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:58,540
They like definitely,
definitely isn't something for the Dukes

2843
02:18:58,540 --> 02:19:00,850
of hazard.
Then you realize like,

2844
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:02,250
oh my fucking.
And then you're like,

2845
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:03,520
you,
you're still lying.

2846
02:19:03,521 --> 02:19:04,810
Like you've haven't been telling the 
truth.

2847
02:19:04,990 --> 02:19:05,980
And he's like,
listen man,

2848
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:11,580
I'm not good at lying.
Like I just like my friends do this 

2849
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:11,580
thing,
like I come here,

2850
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:16,170
I'm not good at lying.
I just tell the truth while I'm up here 

2851
02:19:16,170 --> 02:19:16,170
and like other people will lie to you 
here,

2852
02:19:16,170 --> 02:19:20,101
but I definitely don't do that.
So they go deep and they commit and 

2853
02:19:20,101 --> 02:19:21,640
it's.
But it's not malicious.

2854
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:26,880
It's really both.
It's a very funny thing and that's one 

2855
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:28,070
tiny little part of it.

2856
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:33,070
Like imagine that spread out over and 
over and over and over again with just 

2857
02:19:33,711 --> 02:19:38,711
different types of like bars or art.
Imagine like let's say and you know,

2858
02:19:39,891 --> 02:19:43,100
I don't take psychedelics and if I talk 
about it on the podcast,

2859
02:19:43,101 --> 02:19:45,170
I do it as a joke because I want to seem
cool,

2860
02:19:45,440 --> 02:19:50,440
but imagine if you were in the middle of
the fucking desert on psychedelics that 

2861
02:19:50,440 --> 02:19:53,450
had just started kicking in on your 
bicycle,

2862
02:19:53,451 --> 02:19:58,451
covered in led light,
surrounded by other people in blinking 

2863
02:19:58,451 --> 02:20:01,370
led lights on their bicycles and you're 
sitting in front of what appears to be a

2864
02:20:01,371 --> 02:20:06,371
massive bras.
What is either a locust of firefly,

2865
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:11,490
some kind of grasshopper cricket's 
sculpture on top of another crib,

2866
02:20:11,491 --> 02:20:16,491
get sculpture that has combustible gas 
exploding out of it so that it's.

2867
02:20:16,701 --> 02:20:21,530
And it's like 10 feet,
15 feet high with combustible gas,

2868
02:20:21,531 --> 02:20:23,210
exploding out of it.
So it's making this.

2869
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:32,680
Elon Musk has the dopest rod there.
He's got a yacht that like just goes 

2870
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:34,760
around through fucking burning man and 
life goes on it,

2871
02:20:34,761 --> 02:20:35,480
right?
Yeah.

2872
02:20:35,481 --> 02:20:37,520
And anyone can get on.
That's the other thing about it,

2873
02:20:37,521 --> 02:20:38,750
man,
is it's like this is,

2874
02:20:38,790 --> 02:20:42,170
it's the idea of.
The thing is it's pure inclusivity.

2875
02:20:42,171 --> 02:20:45,650
That's the idea is it's like this is 
just everybody sharing.

2876
02:20:45,651 --> 02:20:49,010
There you go.
So crazy ride through the desert.

2877
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:50,660
You climb on,
they'll give you,

2878
02:20:51,350 --> 02:20:53,510
they'll give you drinks.
You just like chill out.

2879
02:20:53,950 --> 02:20:57,620
It's like the whole thing is like a 
gifting economy is what they call it.

2880
02:20:57,621 --> 02:21:01,250
So like everyone is just giving stuff to
answer was amazing.

2881
02:21:01,310 --> 02:21:03,260
It's the best.
It really truly is.

2882
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:04,160
Okay,
so here's,

2883
02:21:04,220 --> 02:21:09,220
here's the question,
can this go from here to a city?

2884
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:11,720
Can,
can,

2885
02:21:11,750 --> 02:21:13,050
can you develop a city like.
Well,

2886
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:14,120
they,
they do have,

2887
02:21:14,121 --> 02:21:19,121
so like I think the answer that is right
now probably not,

2888
02:21:19,401 --> 02:21:22,150
but why not because it's resource based 
because it's,

2889
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:23,000
it's more like,
okay,

2890
02:21:23,001 --> 02:21:26,180
imagine like a flower that once a year 
blimps.

2891
02:21:26,230 --> 02:21:27,860
Right?
So that's what you could say.

2892
02:21:27,861 --> 02:21:30,650
That's maybe what burning man is like 
during the year.

2893
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:35,980
Lots of people are like getting together
and planning like what they're going to.

2894
02:21:36,210 --> 02:21:38,960
I'm,
I'm planning with my fucking burning man

2895
02:21:38,961 --> 02:21:41,750
camp,
the enchanted booty forest.

2896
02:21:41,930 --> 02:21:43,520
We're planning art,
uh,

2897
02:21:43,521 --> 02:21:47,600
art car for next year and that's going 
to take all year to figure out what it's

2898
02:21:47,601 --> 02:21:50,570
going to be and how to do it and how to 
put it together and how to get the money

2899
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:52,760
told you spend too much time burning 
man.

2900
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:55,580
You're fucking brands become your life 
now.

2901
02:21:55,850 --> 02:21:58,370
It's every year's just downtime,
downtime,

2902
02:21:58,371 --> 02:21:59,450
downtime,
burning man.

2903
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:01,020
Well,
I will say,

2904
02:22:01,030 --> 02:22:01,860
I mean,
I know it,

2905
02:22:01,861 --> 02:22:04,040
it truly is the most embarrassing there.
I know.

2906
02:22:04,041 --> 02:22:09,041
I sound like that guy in that brilliant 
youtube video that someone made 

2907
02:22:09,041 --> 02:22:09,590
parodying the ear beatings that burning 
man.

2908
02:22:09,591 --> 02:22:11,180
People give their friends.
Have you seen that?

2909
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:12,920
No.
Oh,

2910
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:14,680
please pull this up.
No,

2911
02:22:14,681 --> 02:22:15,740
we can't play.
It will get.

2912
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:17,070
Oh my God,
look up.

2913
02:22:17,370 --> 02:22:19,310
Look up.
Look up the youtube video.

2914
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:24,580
So how is burning man?
And it's like this guy in fucking 

2915
02:22:24,580 --> 02:22:25,350
goggles and burning man attire being 
like,

2916
02:22:25,351 --> 02:22:30,351
how was burning man,
you can ask me how wasn't burning man is

2917
02:22:30,451 --> 02:22:35,451
a better question.
It's everything because you really do 

2918
02:22:35,451 --> 02:22:37,320
like when you're there you're like,
oh my God.

2919
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:42,620
Yeah,
that guy just like ranting to his 

2920
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:43,590
fucking girlfriend.
That's when you turned into he's got the

2921
02:22:43,591 --> 02:22:47,190
goggles on those dirt goggles,
which I guess you have to have.

2922
02:22:47,191 --> 02:22:52,191
Did you wear them?
Like you have to wear them because 

2923
02:22:52,191 --> 02:22:52,800
they're these fucking dust storms kickup
and like.

2924
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:54,500
But I'll tell you man,
crazy.

2925
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:56,130
A,
you have to wear a dust goggles.

2926
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:58,980
Here's the craziest thing about it that 
with all that being said,

2927
02:22:58,981 --> 02:23:03,981
there's a place there called the temple 
and it's all of these are like,

2928
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:08,130
a lot of these are built by like genius 
architects.

2929
02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:13,220
The temple.
I can remember how much it they said it 

2930
02:23:13,220 --> 02:23:13,250
costs to build like I have been like 
75,000

2931
02:23:13,310 --> 02:23:15,630
or 750,000.
I can't remember.

2932
02:23:16,230 --> 02:23:18,300
It's this incredible like you can pull 
it up,

2933
02:23:18,301 --> 02:23:20,310
look up the temple,
burning man,

2934
02:23:20,610 --> 02:23:22,370
2016,
uh,

2935
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:24,300
or you can look at all the different 
versions there,

2936
02:23:24,301 --> 02:23:24,840
there,
there.

2937
02:23:24,841 --> 02:23:25,900
That's it.
So,

2938
02:23:26,150 --> 02:23:30,450
so everyone.
So everyone's like go to the temple and.

2939
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:35,480
But it's really heavy when you go there.
So we didn't even know what they're 

2940
02:23:35,480 --> 02:23:38,901
talking about.
So you pedal land and you see people 

2941
02:23:38,901 --> 02:23:39,480
standing in front,
like people seem to be crying.

2942
02:23:39,481 --> 02:23:41,430
People are hugging each other.
Dude,

2943
02:23:41,431 --> 02:23:46,431
you go into that thing and it's filled 
with pictures of people who have died 

2944
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:50,970
that year before.
Baby close pictures of dogs.

2945
02:23:50,971 --> 02:23:55,971
Pictures of like,
it's where people go to burn there to 

2946
02:23:55,971 --> 02:23:58,140
grieve for people who died in their 
lives.

2947
02:23:58,141 --> 02:24:00,810
Man.
And so you walk into that place and this

2948
02:24:00,811 --> 02:24:02,850
is in the middle of this incredible 
festival.

2949
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:06,990
You walk into that fucking place man.
And like you just,

2950
02:24:07,050 --> 02:24:12,050
you start,
you just start crying like people in 

2951
02:24:12,050 --> 02:24:14,421
there because you can feel this like 
just nexus of grief bubbling up and it's

2952
02:24:14,551 --> 02:24:19,551
the most intense create.
The only time I've ever felt that kind 

2953
02:24:19,551 --> 02:24:23,031
of energy is in a place called Vara Nasi
in India where they like burn bodies 

2954
02:24:23,131 --> 02:24:28,131
there.
It's that same kind of like sweet grief 

2955
02:24:28,131 --> 02:24:29,790
of people morning.
But then that's the last thing they burn

2956
02:24:29,791 --> 02:24:33,360
at burning man and whoever's left when 
they burn it,

2957
02:24:33,361 --> 02:24:35,880
which is probably like 60,000,
50,000

2958
02:24:35,881 --> 02:24:40,881
people,
they all sit around it completely 

2959
02:24:40,881 --> 02:24:41,970
silently.
They sit around at silently.

2960
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:44,580
You might hear someone playing a flute 
and the distance or something,

2961
02:24:44,581 --> 02:24:49,581
but it's just imagine 50,000
people sitting around that thing on fire

2962
02:24:50,580 --> 02:24:55,580
quietly is emperors of all these 
pictures of people who've died the year 

2963
02:24:55,580 --> 02:24:59,631
before go fleur,
who whenever they've died go flying 

2964
02:24:59,631 --> 02:25:01,230
through the air and then when it finally
burns to the ground,

2965
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:05,980
the entire group of people,
they how like docs.

2966
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:07,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

2967
02:25:07,681 --> 02:25:09,720
And that's the end of burning man.
Holy Shit.

2968
02:25:11,370 --> 02:25:16,370
So cool.
This is growing at a staggering rate 

2969
02:25:16,370 --> 02:25:20,360
every year.
What's to stop these people from 

2970
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:21,450
claiming a city,
like if everybody just decided like,

2971
02:25:21,451 --> 02:25:23,010
Hey,
let's all move to Portland.

2972
02:25:23,380 --> 02:25:24,160
If all those

2973
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:29,160
people that are burning man type folks 
just decided to try to have the same 

2974
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:32,500
sort of impact on a community that's not
outside the realm of possibility.

2975
02:25:32,501 --> 02:25:32,740
Right.

2976
02:25:32,780 --> 02:25:33,740
Well,
it's already happening.

2977
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:35,360
Is it happening?
What's happening?

2978
02:25:35,361 --> 02:25:38,720
Wherever there's people who have been 
influenced by that festival,

2979
02:25:38,721 --> 02:25:43,721
he turned back into the world and try to
not be such selfish shit ads when 

2980
02:25:43,721 --> 02:25:47,051
they're in the world or maybe try not to
waste so much stuff or like it's also 

2981
02:25:47,051 --> 02:25:48,320
happening because you like realize like,
oh fuck.

2982
02:25:48,350 --> 02:25:53,350
This is not only a festival.
This is preparing for the fucking 

2983
02:25:53,350 --> 02:25:56,470
possible economic collapse because if we
can all get together and survive in the 

2984
02:25:56,470 --> 02:25:59,120
desert in this way and work together,
then there is a possibility.

2985
02:25:59,270 --> 02:26:04,270
You know?
Actually I went to see Alex and Allyson 

2986
02:26:04,270 --> 02:26:06,970
Gray.
There are painting at the Dr Bronner's 

2987
02:26:06,970 --> 02:26:06,970
camp.
They're painting a mural there.

2988
02:26:06,970 --> 02:26:07,400
Doctor Bronner's soap,
hemp soap.

2989
02:26:07,490 --> 02:26:10,960
Dr Bronner has a camp there called Risa.
Yeah.

2990
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:11,600
Yeah.
Dr.

2991
02:26:11,690 --> 02:26:16,690
Bronner's soap.
They have a camp there called 

2992
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:16,690
reformations,
right.

2993
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:20,530
And so they basically are just hosing 
down all these filthy like burning man 

2994
02:26:20,530 --> 02:26:23,030
people out in the desert to clean them 
up.

2995
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:26,690
Right.
So like after they hosed them down,

2996
02:26:27,350 --> 02:26:30,920
there's a,
they've constructed a tent where there's

2997
02:26:30,921 --> 02:26:35,921
a Dj playing music and it's dripping 
water down and everyone's naked dancing 

2998
02:26:37,460 --> 02:26:42,460
and Alex now allison gray or painting is
beautiful mural in that tent.

2999
02:26:42,951 --> 02:26:43,760
And so like we,
you know,

3000
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:48,820
corn,
I went to visit them and we walked up 

3001
02:26:48,820 --> 02:26:48,820
and like,
you know,

3002
02:26:48,820 --> 02:26:52,330
those guys are so fucking cool man.
But then Alex starts with talking to me 

3003
02:26:52,330 --> 02:26:52,330
and he's like,
you know what?

3004
02:26:52,330 --> 02:26:53,180
This is right?
And I'm like,

3005
02:26:53,181 --> 02:26:58,181
what do you mean?
He's like Dr Bronner's family was in 

3006
02:26:58,181 --> 02:27:01,510
Auschwitz where they had the showers and
so this is the opposite of the showers 

3007
02:27:03,591 --> 02:27:08,591
at Auschwitz because it's like naked 
people in real showers dancing the music

3008
02:27:09,831 --> 02:27:13,220
in this like fucking super loving 
environment.

3009
02:27:13,250 --> 02:27:16,700
So their idea was to mirror the 
holocaust or to create like,

3010
02:27:16,970 --> 02:27:19,010
not that you could do that,
but to create like some,

3011
02:27:19,370 --> 02:27:21,290
like a response to it.
There was like,

3012
02:27:21,291 --> 02:27:23,690
here's what it could look like instead 
of gassing people.

3013
02:27:23,870 --> 02:27:25,730
There could be a DJ dripping.
Yeah.

3014
02:27:25,731 --> 02:27:27,200
That's what they do.
They spray it down.

3015
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:28,250
But anyway,
man.

3016
02:27:30,380 --> 02:27:31,590
Yeah.
Like you know,

3017
02:27:32,030 --> 02:27:37,030
one of the things that Alex Gray was 
saying is this is the seed of a global 

3018
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:39,080
civilization,
but seems to be.

3019
02:27:39,470 --> 02:27:40,700
It seems to be that would be.

3020
02:27:40,830 --> 02:27:42,270
There's something going on,
man.

3021
02:27:42,330 --> 02:27:44,970
There's a shift.
There's a consciousness shift.

3022
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:47,640
I mean there's this far reaches on both 
sides.

3023
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:49,530
I mean there's people that are resisting
it hardcore.

3024
02:27:49,830 --> 02:27:53,160
There's a lot of hardcore trump fans 
that are resisting,

3025
02:27:53,161 --> 02:27:58,161
you know,
illegal immigrants and they want a 

3026
02:27:58,161 --> 02:28:01,640
hardcore republican values.
There's a lot of people that are still 

3027
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:05,451
clinging to that,
but then there's a lot of people that 

3028
02:28:05,451 --> 02:28:05,451
were going to Bernie sanders re way too.
Yeah.

3029
02:28:05,451 --> 02:28:07,290
And there's a lot of people that are 
realizing why you watch these,

3030
02:28:07,291 --> 02:28:09,450
to duke it out like King Kong versus 
Godzilla.

3031
02:28:09,780 --> 02:28:13,650
What's interesting is the real loser is 
the system itself,

3032
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:18,740
our confidence in the system.
Our confidence in the system is at an 

3033
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:20,940
all time low and people that are your 
age and older people like me,

3034
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:22,100
I'm 49.
What are you?

3035
02:28:22,101 --> 02:28:26,290
40 three now?
Forty to 42 now to consider it.

3036
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:29,210
We're like middle aged folks,
whether we like it or not,

3037
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:34,510
but we grew up with no internet and then
we were exposed to the internet and now 

3038
02:28:35,451 --> 02:28:38,990
we're seeing things like wikileaks.
The kids of today,

3039
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:42,260
they're going straight wiki links from 
fucking high school.

3040
02:28:42,290 --> 02:28:45,050
Right?
They knew about that in high school.

3041
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:47,420
They they watch all the videos in high 
school.

3042
02:28:47,630 --> 02:28:50,360
Those are the ones that I get the most 
upset about.

3043
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:54,560
When someone posts a video about the 
flat earth or any kind of fucking stupid

3044
02:28:54,561 --> 02:28:59,240
shit where you're going to waste a lot 
of time paying attention to nonsense,

3045
02:28:59,300 --> 02:29:01,580
right?
Not The world's Goddamn round.

3046
02:29:01,610 --> 02:29:05,390
They have a lot of video of him.
You can go around it in a satellite.

3047
02:29:05,391 --> 02:29:07,670
You can go around in a jet.
It's not a fucking hoax.

3048
02:29:07,790 --> 02:29:10,130
Stop thinking about that.
It's a waste of time.

3049
02:29:10,490 --> 02:29:12,500
There's a lot of other shit to 
concentrate on,

3050
02:29:12,830 --> 02:29:17,050
but you'll get lost in that you'll get 
lost and then that upsets me that,

3051
02:29:17,051 --> 02:29:20,000
that pisses me off and I've been 
responsible for it myself.

3052
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:25,160
Sure.
On this podcast or said a lot of shifts 

3053
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:25,160
that turned out not to be true.

3054
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:28,580
You know,
it's usually our obsessions are 

3055
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:28,580
temporary,
but I think what I like what you said,

3056
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:30,510
that the system is kind of short change.
It gets out.

3057
02:29:30,690 --> 02:29:35,690
It reminds me of A.
I just watched on Netflix now it's 

3058
02:29:35,690 --> 02:29:39,710
Luther's a crazy weekend I think as cod.
And you saw the one with Al Sharpton.

3059
02:29:40,980 --> 02:29:43,680
Yes.
And he's talking to Al Sharpton and he's

3060
02:29:43,681 --> 02:29:48,681
like,
I feel like I let you down by not 

3061
02:29:48,681 --> 02:29:48,780
getting arrested and Al Sharpton's 
response as you let yourself down by not

3062
02:29:48,781 --> 02:29:50,530
getting her as did and,
and,

3063
02:29:50,550 --> 02:29:53,230
and,
and then at the end of.

3064
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:54,330
I don't want to do a spoiler

3065
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:55,350
boy,
the one man.

3066
02:29:55,351 --> 02:30:00,351
Now I'm thinking I didn't see that one.
I saw a bunch of bots binge watched on 

3067
02:30:01,020 --> 02:30:01,500
the first time.

3068
02:30:01,530 --> 02:30:06,530
The fucking.
This episode is about black.

3069
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:09,120
Are they black power people?
Blacks?

3070
02:30:09,121 --> 02:30:10,590
I don't know,
I don't think lives matter.

3071
02:30:10,650 --> 02:30:11,880
No,
it's like for that,

3072
02:30:11,910 --> 02:30:13,880
this is like nation of Islam.
This is Pete.

3073
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:18,240
Like the one of the guys Louie was 
hanging out with was like a hardcore,

3074
02:30:18,720 --> 02:30:20,790
like black.
He hated white people.

3075
02:30:20,791 --> 02:30:22,860
White people are the devil.
You're the devil.

3076
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:24,020
Like,
uh,

3077
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:26,640
but he was actually really sweet at the 
same time.

3078
02:30:26,641 --> 02:30:28,830
You know,
he's like really smart too.

3079
02:30:29,010 --> 02:30:30,450
This is a guy,
I can't remember his name.

3080
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:32,480
Dr Khalid.
Uh,

3081
02:30:32,530 --> 02:30:33,660
he,
he actually,

3082
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:38,460
I looked him up because I always really 
wanting to like follow him on twitter,

3083
02:30:38,461 --> 02:30:43,461
but he died of an aneurism but whoa.
And a crazy hardcore charismatic guy who

3084
02:30:43,741 --> 02:30:48,741
wants like the United States to give 
back a swath of land to black people so 

3085
02:30:50,071 --> 02:30:52,290
that they can go live there and like,
but you know,

3086
02:30:52,291 --> 02:30:57,291
Louis Theroux is such a likable guy that
you could see that they were both kind 

3087
02:30:57,291 --> 02:30:58,530
of liking each other when they weren't,
you know what I mean?

3088
02:30:58,531 --> 02:31:01,050
And it was really sweet to watch and 
really cool.

3089
02:31:01,051 --> 02:31:06,051
But you could also see that he was being
moved by recognizing how much a lot of 

3090
02:31:06,661 --> 02:31:09,270
these people have gone through and how 
fucked up it could be.

3091
02:31:09,271 --> 02:31:14,271
And this is before any of this shit 
happened with the recent police 

3092
02:31:14,271 --> 02:31:17,331
shootings,
is that another police shooting in 2001 

3093
02:31:17,331 --> 02:31:20,190
and they were going to go march about 
and Sharpton was going to get arrested.

3094
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:22,800
But then so anyway,
like yeah,

3095
02:31:22,830 --> 02:31:27,830
like Sharpton was like you let yourself 
down by not being part of this by not 

3096
02:31:27,830 --> 02:31:29,370
getting residents like it.
It's true,

3097
02:31:29,371 --> 02:31:31,380
man.
While these people are up there fighting

3098
02:31:31,381 --> 02:31:36,381
like those fucking God damn cats,
the Cro lord into a fight,

3099
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:41,510
while they're up there debating and 
fighting and where our eyes are fixated 

3100
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:45,471
on that,
we can easily lose track of all this 

3101
02:31:45,471 --> 02:31:47,250
stuff that we have definite control 
over,

3102
02:31:47,251 --> 02:31:50,910
which is we don't need to.
We don't need to be so selfish.

3103
02:31:51,390 --> 02:31:56,390
You don't need to be so selfish.
And if you start experimenting with 

3104
02:31:56,390 --> 02:31:57,420
giving stuff away because you guaranteed
man,

3105
02:31:57,780 --> 02:32:00,780
there is stuff that you have that you 
don't need.

3106
02:32:01,140 --> 02:32:06,140
You literally don't need,
like in your garage that you covet kind 

3107
02:32:06,140 --> 02:32:07,320
of like there's shit you covet that you 
don't need,

3108
02:32:07,321 --> 02:32:09,810
you're not going to use or you have like
a hoarder mentality where you're like,

3109
02:32:09,811 --> 02:32:11,340
wow,
I might sell it one day,

3110
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:16,960
who knows I'm going to definitely need 
this vibrating bed one day or whatever 

3111
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:16,960
the fucking thing is that you have.

3112
02:32:17,130 --> 02:32:22,130
You don't need it.
So you could do an experiment where you 

3113
02:32:22,130 --> 02:32:22,450
try to give it away.
Not to,

3114
02:32:22,451 --> 02:32:24,480
uh,
not to a charity or foundation,

3115
02:32:24,481 --> 02:32:28,410
but you figure out someone in your 
community who maybe needs that thing for

3116
02:32:28,411 --> 02:32:30,690
real,
like someone who could actually use it.

3117
02:32:30,790 --> 02:32:32,610
It doesn't have to be some lofty thing 
either.

3118
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:37,880
Maybe you got like an old fucking xbox 
and your garage and your friend doesn't 

3119
02:32:37,880 --> 02:32:40,380
have an xbox.
Give your friend the x box just for fun.

3120
02:32:40,650 --> 02:32:43,230
You could do these little experiments 
and when you do it,

3121
02:32:43,830 --> 02:32:45,660
wow.
It feels good.

3122
02:32:45,780 --> 02:32:48,840
It like is a really great feeling to 
start offloading shit.

3123
02:32:48,841 --> 02:32:53,390
You don't need into the community of 
friends and family and people around you

3124
02:32:53,391 --> 02:32:56,520
are a fucking.
Some people really need stuff man.

3125
02:32:56,820 --> 02:32:58,530
And like,
it won't hurt you at all.

3126
02:32:58,860 --> 02:33:01,830
And so that,
that to me is like when you talk about,

3127
02:33:01,831 --> 02:33:02,370
well,
can we,

3128
02:33:02,700 --> 02:33:05,010
could burning man turn into a 
civilization?

3129
02:33:05,550 --> 02:33:07,440
I don't know,
probably not like,

3130
02:33:07,441 --> 02:33:08,340
you know who?
Um,

3131
02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:14,090
well I won't say who it is,
but one of my friends was out there and 

3132
02:33:14,090 --> 02:33:16,860
he works out there and I'm like not high
on psychedelics,

3133
02:33:16,861 --> 02:33:20,280
but I'm looking around and I know he's 
been going there for a long time and I'm

3134
02:33:20,281 --> 02:33:23,670
like,
could this become society?

3135
02:33:24,030 --> 02:33:24,750
And he's like,
no.

3136
02:33:25,170 --> 02:33:30,170
He's like,
if these people are out here for more 

3137
02:33:30,170 --> 02:33:30,170
than four weeks,
they start killing children.

3138
02:33:31,780 --> 02:33:34,680
Whether that ready for that yet we're 
ready for a couple of weeks at a time,

3139
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:37,780
a couple weeks at a time.
But 1:52

3140
02:33:37,781 --> 02:33:39,120
in a year.
Yeah.

3141
02:33:39,270 --> 02:33:44,270
And in the meantime you can actually 
just kind of start experimenting with 

3142
02:33:44,911 --> 02:33:49,911
not being selfish.
How about instead of looking at it as a 

3143
02:33:49,911 --> 02:33:51,030
negative,
just experiment with being generous.

3144
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:52,320
Ah,
there you go.

3145
02:33:52,890 --> 02:33:56,430
Think of generosity is the ability to 
drop little love bombs.

3146
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:57,460
Yeah,
that's,

3147
02:33:57,560 --> 02:33:59,010
that's how I've always tried to 
approach.

3148
02:33:59,030 --> 02:34:00,480
I've seen.
Do it man,

3149
02:34:00,481 --> 02:34:02,730
those aren't little fucking love bombs 
you leave.

3150
02:34:02,731 --> 02:34:07,731
I've seen not to like I've seen some 
fucking weeping waitresses when I turned

3151
02:34:09,331 --> 02:34:11,100
back to look as you're walking away,
Matt,

3152
02:34:11,101 --> 02:34:14,550
and like that thing that you're doing 
there,

3153
02:34:14,920 --> 02:34:18,190
um,
that thing that you're doing,

3154
02:34:18,191 --> 02:34:21,310
that's it.
Like that thing everyone can do that.

3155
02:34:21,311 --> 02:34:24,830
You don't have to be the host of the UFC
to be able to you,

3156
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:25,710
you.
So like,

3157
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:29,300
God forgive me.
I tried to

3158
02:34:29,540 --> 02:34:32,420
explain this to someone who was saying 
that it was a stupid thing to do.

3159
02:34:32,750 --> 02:34:33,680
I was like,
you,

3160
02:34:33,681 --> 02:34:35,350
you have to think of,
you know,

3161
02:34:35,390 --> 02:34:37,400
they were saying that like they're going
to expect it.

3162
02:34:38,510 --> 02:34:43,510
Every time a rich person goes there,
they're gonna expect larger tips and 

3163
02:34:43,510 --> 02:34:45,450
it's really not proportionate to the 
service that they've given you about.

3164
02:34:45,470 --> 02:34:48,830
You can make someone happy.
It makes them unhappy and you don't feel

3165
02:34:48,831 --> 02:34:52,100
the difference.
The difference between you leaving a one

3166
02:34:52,101 --> 02:34:55,310
number on a check for a tip and they go,
oh,

3167
02:34:55,311 --> 02:34:58,070
that was a good tip or another one 
another go holy shit.

3168
02:34:58,090 --> 02:35:00,650
Like now they feel really good.
Like they just got a gift.

3169
02:35:00,730 --> 02:35:03,170
Like that's what the tip thing is,
the tip things.

3170
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:08,680
That's it means that it's one of the 
rare things that we have in our culture 

3171
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:11,990
where you could express gratitude in a 
numerical amount.

3172
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:17,440
I mean,
I'm not saying that's the only way to 

3173
02:35:17,440 --> 02:35:19,121
express gratitude because of course 
there's a way to express it with your 

3174
02:35:19,121 --> 02:35:19,121
words and your,
you know,

3175
02:35:19,121 --> 02:35:22,311
your love and all that good stuff,
but you can express gratitude in a tip 

3176
02:35:22,311 --> 02:35:22,700
form where you,
you,

3177
02:35:22,740 --> 02:35:24,630
there's a number you can attach to it.
Yeah,

3178
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:25,720
like somewhat.
If you have a.

3179
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:29,150
If the bill is 50 bucks and you leave 50
bucks,

3180
02:35:29,180 --> 02:35:34,180
people go holy Shit.
And to a lot of people the difference 

3181
02:35:34,180 --> 02:35:36,740
between $100 in your bank and $50 in the
bank,

3182
02:35:36,741 --> 02:35:38,750
it's not really,
you're probably not going to feel that.

3183
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:41,210
For some people you will be well,

3184
02:35:41,260 --> 02:35:42,570
but you know,
I was just,

3185
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:47,380
you can do it.
I went to visit my dad in Florida and my

3186
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:52,440
girlfriend and I,
we went to this arcade that gives out 

3187
02:35:52,440 --> 02:35:56,221
tickets.
Like what are those arcades that 

3188
02:35:56,221 --> 02:35:56,221
dispenses tickets.
You know what I'm talking about?

3189
02:35:56,221 --> 02:35:58,810
Like you play fucking skeeball or 
whatever you'd like.

3190
02:35:58,811 --> 02:36:01,450
It's like a little.
It's like a casino for babies,

3191
02:36:01,451 --> 02:36:03,340
right?
So it prints these fucking tickets out.

3192
02:36:03,640 --> 02:36:08,640
You take the 10 tickets to the counter 
and you get like a piece of shit thing 

3193
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:12,991
that you'll never use like a nasty,
like bear made of like Chinese and as 

3194
02:36:13,481 --> 02:36:14,830
bestest or something,
you know.

3195
02:36:14,831 --> 02:36:16,780
So like they exchange is dumb.
Anyway,

3196
02:36:16,990 --> 02:36:21,910
so these tickets we ended up accruing 
this massive pile of fucking tickets.

3197
02:36:21,911 --> 02:36:26,911
Right?
And so we're standing there looking at 

3198
02:36:26,911 --> 02:36:28,861
this junk and then I looked down and I'm
sure other people out there have done 

3199
02:36:28,861 --> 02:36:32,071
this.
There was like a kid who's got a tiny 

3200
02:36:32,071 --> 02:36:34,141
little bit of tickets and he's like 
looking at like the candy that a little 

3201
02:36:34,141 --> 02:36:34,420
bit of tickets and I'm like,
Hey kid,

3202
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:39,840
take this.
Gave him this huge fucking stack of 

3203
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:39,840
tickets.
Dude.

3204
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:42,670
The look on that kid's face and him and 
his brother

3205
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:47,010
that,
you know,

3206
02:36:47,230 --> 02:36:52,230
that look is way more valuable than any 
kind of piece of shit behind the 

3207
02:36:52,711 --> 02:36:53,570
counter.
Right?

3208
02:36:54,120 --> 02:36:56,010
That is the essence of it,
man.

3209
02:36:56,011 --> 02:36:57,030
It's like the,
the,

3210
02:36:57,031 --> 02:36:57,570
the,
the,

3211
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:02,010
when you drop these love bombs off,
this is not a one sided thing.

3212
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:06,900
You're walking away feeling really good 
because you know what you just did.

3213
02:37:07,170 --> 02:37:09,920
You impacted a person's weak.
This,

3214
02:37:10,300 --> 02:37:14,310
this person might not have money to get 
their kids fucking groceries that week,

3215
02:37:14,311 --> 02:37:15,800
man.
Now they do.

3216
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,660
They might not have been able to make 
rent.

3217
02:37:17,870 --> 02:37:20,480
Now they can.
You're walking away.

3218
02:37:20,630 --> 02:37:24,380
Having created that shift in a person's 
universe as temporary is,

3219
02:37:24,390 --> 02:37:29,390
it may be.
It's still a shift in the direction of 

3220
02:37:29,390 --> 02:37:29,390
the positive.
Right?

3221
02:37:29,390 --> 02:37:30,110
So what you've done there as far as I'm 
concerned,

3222
02:37:30,111 --> 02:37:35,111
as a kind of magical act kind of miracle
and any anyone can do this man like you,

3223
02:37:36,021 --> 02:37:37,550
you,
like do,

3224
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:42,600
they're like people who would go around 
with like spray bottles and just spray 

3225
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:47,261
your sunglasses off for you,
which out in the desert is really 

3226
02:37:47,261 --> 02:37:50,171
important because all the sand gets 
caught in there and you can't fucking 

3227
02:37:50,171 --> 02:37:50,930
see that's what they had to give,
you know,

3228
02:37:50,931 --> 02:37:52,790
it was just like helping you in that 
way,

3229
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,760
but just that was still fucking cool 
man.

3230
02:37:56,190 --> 02:38:01,190
So just there giving a service to people
and they don't expect anything out of 

3231
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:01,190
it.
That's it.

3232
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:02,300
They're just doing it for love.
You can do.

3233
02:38:02,310 --> 02:38:07,040
Anyone can do that.
There is definitely something you can do

3234
02:38:07,310 --> 02:38:09,470
that you're not doing and you're not 
doing it.

3235
02:38:09,530 --> 02:38:14,530
Not because yourself is.
You're not doing it just because you 

3236
02:38:14,530 --> 02:38:17,020
haven't even realized you can do it.
It's like having a superpower that 

3237
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:17,020
you're not aware of,
which is like,

3238
02:38:17,020 --> 02:38:18,740
fuck.
Just give something away.

3239
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:20,390
Like it does.
Just give something away.

3240
02:38:20,391 --> 02:38:22,240
You don't need that shit.
Whatever it is,

3241
02:38:22,241 --> 02:38:27,241
just get the fucking thing away.
Super Hippie Duncan Trust.

3242
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:31,150
Oh yeah,
you're the anti-trump.

3243
02:38:32,150 --> 02:38:33,440
When are you going to run for President 
Duncan?

3244
02:38:33,470 --> 02:38:34,540
When are you going to run?
Well,

3245
02:38:34,970 --> 02:38:39,970
why don't you.
Why don't you do ask a question or 

3246
02:38:39,970 --> 02:38:40,040
answer a question with a question that's
rude.

3247
02:38:40,220 --> 02:38:42,020
That's a poor taste.
I.

3248
02:38:42,020 --> 02:38:43,130
Well,
I'll tell you man.

3249
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:47,240
My hope is that glue without you and I 
will run.

3250
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:49,250
No,
I'm just kidding.

3251
02:38:49,550 --> 02:38:54,550
Move.
We've got to get out of here before it 

3252
02:38:54,550 --> 02:38:54,550
blows up.
Out of here anyway.

3253
02:38:54,550 --> 02:38:57,890
Who is going to blow up?
Is going to be fun to this thing,

3254
02:38:58,850 --> 02:39:03,850
this America you think it'll.
Cause I don't know if this is going to 

3255
02:39:03,981 --> 02:39:04,580
work,
dude.

3256
02:39:05,630 --> 02:39:07,040
I'm looking at this election.
I'm like,

3257
02:39:07,041 --> 02:39:09,350
this thing's just,
it's too volatile.

3258
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:11,720
Good.
Let it fucking collapsed by.

3259
02:39:12,870 --> 02:39:17,060
If it fucking collapses about children,
people are going to be.

3260
02:39:17,140 --> 02:39:18,920
What about the infrastructure?
You know,

3261
02:39:18,921 --> 02:39:23,921
I just had this conversation with.
I had this conversation with Chris Ryan 

3262
02:39:23,921 --> 02:39:25,430
and my podcast.
We got to do a shrimp rates united.

3263
02:39:26,150 --> 02:39:27,470
And he said that,
uh,

3264
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:29,850
he was talking about how post,
you know,

3265
02:39:29,870 --> 02:39:34,730
after disasters,
everybody gives to each other and people

3266
02:39:34,731 --> 02:39:35,390
are very kind.

3267
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:38,690
So if there was some kind of economic 
collapse,

3268
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:43,720
some calamity or something,
then I think what people would suddenly 

3269
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:48,011
realize is like what would happen is 
that pendulum that swings in front of 

3270
02:39:48,011 --> 02:39:52,661
the eyes of the sum total of all people 
in this country and convinces us of the 

3271
02:39:52,661 --> 02:39:55,850
importance of this small group of 
secretive people.

3272
02:39:56,120 --> 02:40:01,120
Maybe for a second,
that thing stopped swinging and we like 

3273
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:01,520
look away from it and look at each 
other.

3274
02:40:01,521 --> 02:40:03,470
And we realized like,
Oh shit,

3275
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:07,640
we've got each other.
We're going to be okay.

3276
02:40:07,820 --> 02:40:11,690
The fantasy of the fucking road.
People like grab your guns,

3277
02:40:12,110 --> 02:40:15,030
go rob the rich people,
all that stuff.

3278
02:40:15,060 --> 02:40:20,060
The idea that it's going to be some kind
of like the La riots times a million 

3279
02:40:20,060 --> 02:40:20,100
years.
I was like,

3280
02:40:20,130 --> 02:40:23,160
oh no,
that's not what it's like at all.

3281
02:40:23,161 --> 02:40:25,950
It's like we can help each other 
together.

3282
02:40:26,130 --> 02:40:26,960
I get help you.

3283
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:31,960
You can help me.
We didn't need them as much as we 

3284
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:31,960
thought we did.
We maybe we didn't need them at all.

3285
02:40:31,980 --> 02:40:36,980
We've got the fucking roads.
There's people who know how to fix 

3286
02:40:36,980 --> 02:40:36,980
roads.
I know how to do stuff.

3287
02:40:36,980 --> 02:40:39,210
You know how to do such a super hip and 
we need the fucking system.

3288
02:40:39,211 --> 02:40:41,670
Goddammit.
We need trucks to bring in vegetables.

3289
02:40:41,671 --> 02:40:44,130
We need to sewage system that works.
We need power.

3290
02:40:44,131 --> 02:40:47,470
We need to direct the programs.
Programs.

3291
02:40:47,471 --> 02:40:51,780
I need to watch my programs,
my fucking money to refrigerator.

3292
02:40:51,781 --> 02:40:53,070
That works.
God dammit.

3293
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:55,230
I need data.
You need westworld.

3294
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:57,420
I need a hospital that's clean.
Yeah,

3295
02:40:57,480 --> 02:40:58,860
you do need that,
but guess what?

3296
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:01,980
It could still happen.
It could still happen.

3297
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:04,620
It can really happen.
I think such a hippie it.

3298
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:06,570
There's no hospitals and that burning 
man,

3299
02:41:06,660 --> 02:41:11,660
just cleaners.
They do have like a full hospital at 

3300
02:41:11,660 --> 02:41:11,730
burning man.

3301
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:13,020
No,
I didn't go visit it,

3302
02:41:13,021 --> 02:41:18,021
but they say they have like a,
like a urgent care medical facility 

3303
02:41:18,021 --> 02:41:18,021
there.
That's really nice.

3304
02:41:18,021 --> 02:41:22,371
And they fucking need it to [inaudible] 
like you think I'm a fucking super 

3305
02:41:22,371 --> 02:41:22,930
hippie man.
Do you think they have like a checkbox?

3306
02:41:22,950 --> 02:41:25,080
Like do you have an injury or are you 
freaking out?

3307
02:41:25,081 --> 02:41:26,170
Man?
Well that's the,

3308
02:41:27,140 --> 02:41:29,610
that's the Zendo project it,
maps is doing.

3309
02:41:29,611 --> 02:41:34,611
So one of the cool things that Doblin is
doing is they have a thing called Zendo,

3310
02:41:35,490 --> 02:41:38,640
which is this,
it's called psychedelic harm reduction.

3311
02:41:38,970 --> 02:41:43,970
And so they create,
like in the Porta Johns at burning man 

3312
02:41:43,970 --> 02:41:47,420
there,
these signs that they put up that say a 

3313
02:41:47,420 --> 02:41:47,420
night,
a little night,

3314
02:41:47,420 --> 02:41:50,520
a little weirder than you expected,
like come here.

3315
02:41:50,730 --> 02:41:53,580
And so like you go to this place and 
it's like,

3316
02:41:53,850 --> 02:41:56,100
dude,
you gotTa have this guy on your podcast.

3317
02:41:56,101 --> 02:41:56,890
His name's,
uh,

3318
02:41:57,660 --> 02:41:59,850
Dr Cole Marta.
He's a psychiatrist.

3319
02:41:59,850 --> 02:42:03,720
He's like one of the people involved in 
the MTMA for ptsd.

3320
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:05,660
Um,
uh,

3321
02:42:05,670 --> 02:42:10,670
experiments that they're doing,
they're in the phase three clinical 

3322
02:42:10,670 --> 02:42:13,521
trials.
Maps is but so he volunteers at the 

3323
02:42:13,521 --> 02:42:18,021
Zendo.
But basically what happens is it's the 

3324
02:42:18,021 --> 02:42:20,641
safe space that Doblin is created where 
you go there if you're freaking out and 

3325
02:42:21,451 --> 02:42:23,220
you're like,
am I going to get fucking arrested?

3326
02:42:23,590 --> 02:42:24,940
And they're like,
no man,

3327
02:42:25,330 --> 02:42:28,590
just sit down and relax and like these 
are trained,

3328
02:42:28,860 --> 02:42:33,860
this Guy Coal Marta man,
like there's smart train clinicians and 

3329
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:34,750
if they're not clinicians,
they've peaked.

3330
02:42:34,790 --> 02:42:39,790
There are people who have been through 
this program who just sit with you and 

3331
02:42:39,790 --> 02:42:43,011
let you freak out without judging you 
and like just sit with you and let you 

3332
02:42:43,011 --> 02:42:45,030
relax until you're having an okay time 
again.

3333
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:50,180
And then they let you go back.
So instead of like losing your shit and 

3334
02:42:50,180 --> 02:42:54,201
like getting arrested or losing your 
shit and being around your friends who 

3335
02:42:54,201 --> 02:42:54,330
were like,
what the Fuck's wrong with you?

3336
02:42:54,330 --> 02:42:59,330
Man?
You get to be around like really smart 

3337
02:42:59,330 --> 02:43:02,271
trained people who know how to,
how to like not just like help you 

3338
02:43:02,371 --> 02:43:07,371
relax,
but help you use this event to like 

3339
02:43:07,371 --> 02:43:11,030
transform your life.
Because a lot of times a bad trip is 

3340
02:43:11,030 --> 02:43:13,540
like a transformative moment for someone
if they're around the right people.

3341
02:43:13,780 --> 02:43:15,280
That's amazing.
Yeah,

3342
02:43:15,310 --> 02:43:17,200
maps is incredible.
I know,

3343
02:43:17,201 --> 02:43:22,201
man.
I've done so much cool shit and Rick 

3344
02:43:22,201 --> 02:43:22,201
Doblin,
just such an interesting guy.

3345
02:43:22,201 --> 02:43:25,360
I've had him on twice had a chance to 
talk to them on the podcast twice.

3346
02:43:25,361 --> 02:43:28,600
He's such a fascinating dude.
He's a warrior man.

3347
02:43:28,601 --> 02:43:33,601
When you look at the how might he spent 
his entire life like we know we sit here

3348
02:43:35,740 --> 02:43:39,970
and we fucking rail against the system 
and marijuana and like ahh,

3349
02:43:40,300 --> 02:43:43,030
but Doblin man,
he's like on the front lines,

3350
02:43:43,031 --> 02:43:48,031
like this guy is like deeply,
deeply involved in doing it the right 

3351
02:43:48,521 --> 02:43:48,760
way.

3352
02:43:49,290 --> 02:43:51,270
He's doing it through the system.
Yeah,

3353
02:43:51,640 --> 02:43:53,110
it's cool.
It is cool.

3354
02:43:53,410 --> 02:43:58,410
It's interesting like he was detailing 
like getting it passed and what was 

3355
02:43:58,410 --> 02:44:02,491
going to be entailed and getting this 
therapy through and then what would be 

3356
02:44:02,491 --> 02:44:04,600
next and how this is a longterm thing 
they're doing over long,

3357
02:44:04,900 --> 02:44:06,010
many,
many years.

3358
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:07,090
Oh God.
He gave.

3359
02:44:07,360 --> 02:44:10,840
He gave a talk at burning man.
That was just like when you like he just

3360
02:44:10,841 --> 02:44:15,841
detailing the like the war on drugs and 
like why it's happened and what it is 

3361
02:44:15,841 --> 02:44:20,731
and then like his step by step plan and 
then you realize like this guy is in a 

3362
02:44:21,310 --> 02:44:26,310
phase three,
phase three of clinical trials which 

3363
02:44:26,310 --> 02:44:30,511
never happens.
Like with a schedule one substance that 

3364
02:44:30,511 --> 02:44:34,600
theoretically could like the results 
that they're getting are very good,

3365
02:44:34,601 --> 02:44:39,601
but if people who have ptsd,
if they go to the doctor,

3366
02:44:39,940 --> 02:44:44,940
the doctor will be like,
well I'll prescribe xanax and maybe 

3367
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:46,420
they'll give you like cognitive behavior
therapy or something,

3368
02:44:46,421 --> 02:44:51,421
but like the idea that there might be a 
way to give someone Mgma,

3369
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:57,480
mgma mixed in with like a specific type 
of therapy and that that could actually,

3370
02:44:59,250 --> 02:45:04,250
I don't want to say cure,
but they set their mind to lift the 

3371
02:45:04,270 --> 02:45:05,650
this,
the weight of,

3372
02:45:05,710 --> 02:45:10,710
of this horror off of them or at least 
allow it to like dabble and explained 

3373
02:45:10,710 --> 02:45:11,260
why he thinks that works.

3374
02:45:11,260 --> 02:45:16,260
I'm not going to try to repeat it,
but the idea that this could work for 

3375
02:45:16,260 --> 02:45:17,950
real is just the most incredible thing.
Man.

3376
02:45:17,951 --> 02:45:20,470
That guy would.
He should get a Nobel prize.

3377
02:45:20,530 --> 02:45:22,900
I think he did explain it on this 
podcast,

3378
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:24,640
Sydney to.
Do you remember Jamie?

3379
02:45:24,940 --> 02:45:27,160
I don't remember either.
I feel like you did though.

3380
02:45:27,161 --> 02:45:30,510
I feel like he explained how it works.
It's like you're when you.

3381
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:33,670
Apparently it's something to do with 
short term longterm memory,

3382
02:45:33,910 --> 02:45:37,570
so when you have a traumatic event,
it gets stuck in short term memory.

3383
02:45:37,571 --> 02:45:40,360
Somehow it's looping there.
It's not getting filed away in the right

3384
02:45:40,361 --> 02:45:41,740
way.
God forgives me.

3385
02:45:41,741 --> 02:45:43,590
Everyone listening.
Doblin coal,

3386
02:45:43,591 --> 02:45:44,140
Marty,
whoever.

3387
02:45:44,141 --> 02:45:48,850
I'm ruining this in front of,
but like it like it apparently something

3388
02:45:48,851 --> 02:45:53,851
about revisiting the experience under 
the influence of Mtma causes it to 

3389
02:45:54,521 --> 02:45:58,330
somehow be refiled in the right part of 
your brain again,

3390
02:45:58,331 --> 02:46:02,680
so it's not sticking out in the 
forefront of your experiences,

3391
02:46:02,681 --> 02:46:07,681
so it's not like it.
The thing isn't always there like a 

3392
02:46:07,681 --> 02:46:09,340
flash bulb light or something.
Another thing that's infuriating.

3393
02:46:09,380 --> 02:46:10,430
I mean that's almost

3394
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:15,430
to me is infuriating.
As teenagers getting hooked on flat 

3395
02:46:15,430 --> 02:46:19,451
earth videos,
it's more infuriating even that this is 

3396
02:46:19,451 --> 02:46:19,850
always been there.
This has always been there.

3397
02:46:20,060 --> 02:46:25,060
This has always been there and they made
it illegal and all these people that 

3398
02:46:25,060 --> 02:46:28,541
suffered could have,
could have gotten relief through this 

3399
02:46:28,541 --> 02:46:29,720
all long time ago.
A long time ago.

3400
02:46:29,750 --> 02:46:30,470
I now,
man,

3401
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:33,540
if they just recognized this early on,
had been super objective about it.

3402
02:46:33,550 --> 02:46:33,890
Look,
look,

3403
02:46:33,891 --> 02:46:38,891
clue.
We clearly have an issue with ptsd in 

3404
02:46:38,891 --> 02:46:39,530
soldiers and police men and people that 
have gone through domestic abuse.

3405
02:46:39,800 --> 02:46:41,460
There's a lot of people with PTSD.
They can.

3406
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:45,230
This king literally changed the course 
of our nation,

3407
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:50,680
but do you keep up the fucking.
Dea is corrupt system to keep up this 

3408
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:55,511
nasty business of arresting people for 
the wrong kind of drugs while they're 

3409
02:46:55,511 --> 02:46:59,501
selling drugs.
Everywhere you look to keep up that 

3410
02:46:59,501 --> 02:47:02,381
system.
They literally stopped something that 

3411
02:47:02,381 --> 02:47:02,381
would have helped everyone.

3412
02:47:02,381 --> 02:47:02,381
Buddy.
Man,

3413
02:47:02,381 --> 02:47:04,050
can I just.
I don't work for maps.

3414
02:47:04,051 --> 02:47:05,940
I've never used.
I do a plug for them real quick.

3415
02:47:05,941 --> 02:47:07,080
Yeah,
so guys,

3416
02:47:07,081 --> 02:47:10,230
if you actually want to chip in to 
something super fucking cool,

3417
02:47:10,470 --> 02:47:15,060
go to the maps website.
Right now they are raising money because

3418
02:47:15,061 --> 02:47:17,810
Doblin has got a manufacturer.
I can't remember.

3419
02:47:17,830 --> 02:47:22,470
Something like five kilograms of MDM,
a for the phase three trial so you can,

3420
02:47:22,650 --> 02:47:27,330
you can go to maps and actually chip in 
to to to have it well,

3421
02:47:27,630 --> 02:47:29,440
to get ecstasy,
to get Mtma,

3422
02:47:29,441 --> 02:47:34,080
to vet people with ptsd and it's a 
really cool thing if you want to chip in

3423
02:47:34,081 --> 02:47:36,090
money for it.
Super fucking cool.

3424
02:47:36,300 --> 02:47:41,300
Like that's like how often do you get a 
chance to buy Mtma for people with PTSD?

3425
02:47:41,900 --> 02:47:44,250
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

3426
02:47:44,820 --> 02:47:48,390
It's really fucking cool man.
Because they have these incredible.

3427
02:47:48,450 --> 02:47:53,450
They have a supply of old MTMA and I 
think it's like they can't use it 

3428
02:47:53,450 --> 02:47:55,080
anymore.
They've already raised $148,000,

3429
02:47:55,570 --> 02:47:58,560
but they need.
They needed $400,000

3430
02:47:58,561 --> 02:48:00,750
for five kilograms of Mtma.

3431
02:48:01,050 --> 02:48:04,650
Well let's see what we can do.
See if we can get some donations going.

3432
02:48:04,690 --> 02:48:05,070
Maps.

3433
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:07,910
This is my kind of telethon.
Come on guys.

3434
02:48:08,110 --> 02:48:13,110
Come on.
It's going to be putting people on 

3435
02:48:13,110 --> 02:48:15,691
public radio.
I was listening to this Mckenna 

3436
02:48:15,691 --> 02:48:15,691
interview once and he was on public 
radio,

3437
02:48:15,691 --> 02:48:20,611
is a recording of him on public radio 
and it was so annoying and so like if 

3438
02:48:20,611 --> 02:48:22,150
you enjoy this program,
please donate.

3439
02:48:22,151 --> 02:48:25,750
They have that weird way at talking 
where it's just as gross as a strip club

3440
02:48:25,751 --> 02:48:27,850
Dj.
You know what I mean?

3441
02:48:27,851 --> 02:48:31,450
It's like there's a way of talking when 
you're talking about public radio.

3442
02:48:31,660 --> 02:48:34,420
If you enjoy this show,
you enjoy these programs,

3443
02:48:34,660 --> 02:48:37,240
please donate.
We require your donations.

3444
02:48:37,450 --> 02:48:40,660
It's the only way we stay afloat.
If you appreciate this show,

3445
02:48:40,810 --> 02:48:43,330
if you appreciate fresh air with Terry 
Gross,

3446
02:48:43,630 --> 02:48:47,290
that will be coming out later.
It's the Portlandia affectation.

3447
02:48:47,350 --> 02:48:47,660
Well,
it's.

3448
02:48:47,690 --> 02:48:51,010
It's now it's national public radio 
speak.

3449
02:48:51,220 --> 02:48:53,920
It's.
I am a super sensitive guy.

3450
02:48:54,370 --> 02:48:57,310
I am a liberal.
I'm absolutely left.

3451
02:48:57,310 --> 02:49:00,520
I lean left.
That was what that guy in Canada,

3452
02:49:00,690 --> 02:49:05,690
he used to talk bad about.
The guy who was accused of beating the 

3453
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:05,920
fuck out of these girls that he was 
having sex with.

3454
02:49:05,950 --> 02:49:07,920
Remember that guy,
John Ghomeshi,

3455
02:49:08,960 --> 02:49:13,960
they kicked him off the radio show 
because all these women were claiming 

3456
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:15,540
that they had sex with them and even to 
like beat them up and shit.

3457
02:49:15,750 --> 02:49:17,460
Oh yes,
yes.

3458
02:49:17,461 --> 02:49:19,440
He would talk like this.
Hello.

3459
02:49:20,070 --> 02:49:22,530
Welcome to the show.
To take a leak.

3460
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:23,790
I'm sorry.
Please go.

3461
02:49:23,791 --> 02:49:27,660
Urinate.
Judge may have to go urinate judgment.

3462
02:49:27,661 --> 02:49:29,940
There's no judgment.
Everything's cool.

3463
02:49:29,950 --> 02:49:32,550
No judgment,
no judgment here.

3464
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:37,580
In a few moments we're going to ask once
again that you call the number on the 

3465
02:49:37,580 --> 02:49:39,780
screen or donate.
It's very important.

3466
02:49:40,230 --> 02:49:43,740
Donate.
We require your donations to stay afloat

3467
02:49:43,741 --> 02:49:47,940
here.
If you enjoy the state of ferns today,

3468
02:49:49,050 --> 02:49:51,420
which is our new piece that we're 
working on.

3469
02:49:52,410 --> 02:49:57,410
Love happiness and wholefoods.
Stunk and trusts on Brendan Walsh.

3470
02:49:57,721 --> 02:50:00,210
They have a piece they're putting 
together for us.

3471
02:50:01,910 --> 02:50:06,910
Don't get to become a super hippie.
Have you noticed something's different 

3472
02:50:06,910 --> 02:50:07,260
burning man?
Yeah.

3473
02:50:07,261 --> 02:50:09,630
They got got out of the hospital.
They have there.

3474
02:50:10,180 --> 02:50:15,180
Was that from 2014,
but they have a cool looking 300 

3475
02:50:15,180 --> 02:50:15,810
employees at a hospital that has 52 
beds.

3476
02:50:15,960 --> 02:50:17,940
Wow.
It set an actual hospital,

3477
02:50:17,941 --> 02:50:19,920
Humboldt,
general hospital employees come and help

3478
02:50:19,921 --> 02:50:24,921
people.
They have tickets for burning man to 

3479
02:50:24,921 --> 02:50:24,921
write.
I think if the biome now.

3480
02:50:24,921 --> 02:50:29,420
Doesn't that sound crazy?
That seems like it doesn't make any 

3481
02:50:29,420 --> 02:50:31,581
sense,
but this is the only way to keep people 

3482
02:50:31,581 --> 02:50:33,270
from overwhelming place because you're,
you're gonna if you have tickets,

3483
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:35,280
that means you can only sell a certain 
amount of tickets.

3484
02:50:35,450 --> 02:50:37,560
It means Bernie man sells out.
Right?

3485
02:50:37,740 --> 02:50:38,140
Yeah.
Well,

3486
02:50:38,190 --> 02:50:39,220
like this,
uh,

3487
02:50:39,380 --> 02:50:40,680
the service here,
the,

3488
02:50:40,930 --> 02:50:43,980
the hospital was paid for by the burning
man organization.

3489
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:47,190
It costs $455,000
for that year.

3490
02:50:47,250 --> 02:50:49,070
Oh my God.
That's insane.

3491
02:50:49,071 --> 02:50:49,640
That's.
Oh,

3492
02:50:49,660 --> 02:50:51,110
so that's where the tickets go.
Oh,

3493
02:50:51,550 --> 02:50:53,290
that makes sense.
To show their website where it all goes.

3494
02:50:53,310 --> 02:50:54,450
Well,
it doesn't make sense though,

3495
02:50:54,451 --> 02:50:57,030
is limiting the number.
Does that?

3496
02:50:57,031 --> 02:50:58,830
Doesn't that seem illogical?
Well,

3497
02:50:58,831 --> 02:51:00,810
yeah.
I mean if a 150,000

3498
02:51:00,811 --> 02:51:03,990
people in that hospital now is fucked,
they can't,

3499
02:51:04,630 --> 02:51:08,250
but they just have to ramp it up based 
on how many people buy tickets.

3500
02:51:08,430 --> 02:51:13,430
As long as you just keep having tickets,
then you'll have more money to spend on 

3501
02:51:13,430 --> 02:51:15,630
more hospitals and you would just sort 
of plan it accordingly,

3502
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:20,840
but maybe they're trying to like slowly 
develop it where they don't want it to 

3503
02:51:20,840 --> 02:51:21,900
get completely chaotic and out of 
control,

3504
02:51:21,901 --> 02:51:25,950
which is what it definitely would do if 
they had no restrictions whatsoever.

3505
02:51:26,200 --> 02:51:27,390
Duck.
And while you were urinating,

3506
02:51:27,391 --> 02:51:32,391
we were talking about the restrictions 
on the population at burning man and 

3507
02:51:32,391 --> 02:51:32,391
then I found that to be a little bit 
odd.

3508
02:51:32,520 --> 02:51:37,520
It makes sense that they're selling 
tickets to it because especially there 

3509
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:40,340
were.
We found out how much it costs for the 

3510
02:51:40,340 --> 02:51:40,340
hospital.
Four hundred and $25,000

3511
02:51:40,340 --> 02:51:40,650
for a year or something.
Is that what it was?

3512
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:42,630
Fifty five.
Four 55.

3513
02:51:42,750 --> 02:51:47,750
So.
But why wouldn't they just allow more 

3514
02:51:47,750 --> 02:51:50,100
people to buy tickets?
Why wouldn't they just keep selling to a

3515
02:51:50,101 --> 02:51:54,450
number I might guess would be that.
So it's like they have to work out deals

3516
02:51:54,451 --> 02:51:58,370
with growth and like the surrounding 
areas and what's lock.

3517
02:51:58,400 --> 02:52:01,410
Go relax the town right before you get 
to fucking burning man.

3518
02:52:01,411 --> 02:52:05,980
That once a year just gets like this and
this huge

3519
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:08,170
influx of Dell,
but like they are.

3520
02:52:08,320 --> 02:52:08,950
Yeah,
there it is.

3521
02:52:08,951 --> 02:52:13,951
The bureau of land management,
Bureau of land management is the same 

3522
02:52:13,951 --> 02:52:18,541
thing that manages a public land for 
like hiking and fishing and rafting and 

3523
02:52:20,890 --> 02:52:21,880
that kind of shit.
Yeah.

3524
02:52:21,881 --> 02:52:24,190
And so like basically if you look at 
that,

3525
02:52:24,460 --> 02:52:28,140
you could see that because they have 
given in this and basically it's a shake

3526
02:52:28,141 --> 02:52:28,750
down.
Right?

3527
02:52:28,751 --> 02:52:32,800
So like if you want to do this festival 
Europe paying us well,

3528
02:52:32,801 --> 02:52:37,801
would you say that it's a shakedown or 
they want to control the population 

3529
02:52:37,801 --> 02:52:38,260
because they didn't want to getting out 
of control?

3530
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:43,280
Oh No,
I know of land management has a 

3531
02:52:43,280 --> 02:52:45,661
reasonable being dev a reasonable 
concern that it could get completely 

3532
02:52:46,001 --> 02:52:48,210
overrun with hippies and it would be 
massive.

3533
02:52:48,240 --> 02:52:53,240
So there's a,
there's definitely a reasonable concern 

3534
02:52:53,240 --> 02:52:53,350
and there's also like,
uh,

3535
02:52:53,750 --> 02:52:55,660
there's also some,
maybe I'm not,

3536
02:52:55,661 --> 02:52:56,060
I don't know.

3537
02:52:56,260 --> 02:52:59,050
Perhaps there could be maybe some 
profiteering happening,

3538
02:52:59,170 --> 02:53:04,170
but here's my question.
Why wouldn't they make more money by 

3539
02:53:04,170 --> 02:53:06,420
allowing more people in if they really 
want to tear the move is to just say,

3540
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:09,350
I don't think burning man material.
No,

3541
02:53:09,360 --> 02:53:11,710
I'm not saying burning man.
You Sound Bureau of land management.

3542
02:53:11,711 --> 02:53:12,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

3543
02:53:12,521 --> 02:53:16,030
Why would they just open it up?
Eighty $1,000,000.

3544
02:53:16,150 --> 02:53:20,170
Oh my God.
I that burning man's expenses.

3545
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:20,920
Oh,
30.

3546
02:53:21,460 --> 02:53:23,140
Yeah.
Thirty million.

3547
02:53:23,141 --> 02:53:28,141
One hundred $85,000.
Burning man was once a scrappy little 

3548
02:53:28,541 --> 02:53:31,750
desert gatherings become a multifaceted 
professional operation.

3549
02:53:31,751 --> 02:53:36,751
Today.
The burning man project produces the 

3550
02:53:36,751 --> 02:53:38,911
nation's largest permanent event on 
public land and supports and extensive 

3551
02:53:39,191 --> 02:53:43,150
global network of events,
artists and civic initiatives.

3552
02:53:44,290 --> 02:53:45,060
Man.
He.

3553
02:53:45,110 --> 02:53:47,020
Well,
I can't believe that's so much money.

3554
02:53:47,050 --> 02:53:49,210
Do you want to hear something?
Even dod million.

3555
02:53:49,211 --> 02:53:50,290
One hundred 85.
What's.

3556
02:53:50,440 --> 02:53:53,710
What's crazy about it is when you look 
down,

3557
02:53:54,190 --> 02:53:55,540
there's no trash on the ground.

3558
02:53:56,140 --> 02:53:59,920
That's what's really not too bad at it.
They call it the matter out of place.

3559
02:54:00,270 --> 02:54:00,970
Boop,
boop.

3560
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:06,000
So like what they do after the festival,
they will like go from camp to camp,

3561
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:10,780
looking for where the trash is and if 
they find any trash they like,

3562
02:54:10,810 --> 02:54:15,810
like if someone's,
let's say broken in a bottle or 

3563
02:54:15,810 --> 02:54:15,810
something,
right?

3564
02:54:15,810 --> 02:54:19,320
They will bring like a team of 11 people
in to sift through the sand to get every

3565
02:54:20,651 --> 02:54:25,651
single bit of glass out of the fucking 
sand so that it goes back to being just 

3566
02:54:25,651 --> 02:54:30,511
what it was before alkaline desert.
And that's,

3567
02:54:30,870 --> 02:54:35,870
that comes from the cacophonous because 
one of the good confidence sayings is 

3568
02:54:35,870 --> 02:54:35,960
leave no trace.
So they,

3569
02:54:35,970 --> 02:54:40,970
the idea is like they go to a place,
do they're insane thing and then leave 

3570
02:54:40,970 --> 02:54:40,970
and it's like they were never there 
before,

3571
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:43,810
which is pretty trippy to take us so 
bad.

3572
02:54:44,050 --> 02:54:46,200
It's so bad ass.
It's amazing.

3573
02:54:46,220 --> 02:54:47,690
So cool.
Yeah.

3574
02:54:47,780 --> 02:54:50,620
I wonder like this didn't exist 30,
40 years ago.

3575
02:54:50,910 --> 02:54:53,020
Like what's it going to be like 30,
40 years from now?

3576
02:54:53,110 --> 02:54:58,030
I don't know.
It's hard to say when people give up the

3577
02:54:58,031 --> 02:55:03,031
ideas that have sort of imprisoned each 
generation about keeping up with the 

3578
02:55:03,591 --> 02:55:04,580
Joneses

3579
02:55:04,580 --> 02:55:09,580
and about belonging to the right country
club and about all the things that 

3580
02:55:09,580 --> 02:55:12,110
people strive for.
Moving up the corporate ladder,

3581
02:55:12,590 --> 02:55:15,750
you know,
all that stuff and clinking glasses like

3582
02:55:15,800 --> 02:55:20,800
you're in a fucking Leonardo dicaprio 
movie before it takes a turn for the 

3583
02:55:20,800 --> 02:55:22,040
worst traits.
I mean,

3584
02:55:22,780 --> 02:55:27,780
that's,
that's literally what it is before it 

3585
02:55:27,780 --> 02:55:28,310
all starts getting crazy.
You're clinking glasses.

3586
02:55:28,490 --> 02:55:29,780
That's what everybody's hoping for.

3587
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:33,360
Yeah.
Well,

3588
02:55:33,420 --> 02:55:34,740
uh,
you know,

3589
02:55:34,741 --> 02:55:35,430
we're,
we're,

3590
02:55:35,431 --> 02:55:40,431
we're evolving,
everybody's evolving and we're learning 

3591
02:55:40,431 --> 02:55:41,760
a lot of stuff right now and like what,
like,

3592
02:55:41,790 --> 02:55:46,790
you know,
we're learning a lot of stuff and part 

3593
02:55:46,790 --> 02:55:48,921
of I think hopefully what we're learning
is that certain things cannot be 

3594
02:55:49,050 --> 02:55:54,050
commodified,
that there's no way to really put a 

3595
02:55:54,050 --> 02:55:54,410
price on certain things.
And you know,

3596
02:55:55,230 --> 02:56:00,230
a lot of people there,
it's not like they're against money or 

3597
02:56:00,230 --> 02:56:00,870
against people making money or anything 
like that.

3598
02:56:00,871 --> 02:56:05,250
The idea is like make money,
spend the whole year making money,

3599
02:56:05,430 --> 02:56:10,430
but then let's fucking ignite it in the 
form of your amazing sculpture that you 

3600
02:56:10,741 --> 02:56:13,470
brought out into the desert.
The other cool thing is too,

3601
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:17,700
when you're looking at these sculptures,
you don't see like a plaque that's like,

3602
02:56:17,701 --> 02:56:21,540
this was made by Tim French.
Follow me at Tim.

3603
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:25,150
You know what I mean?
No one's,

3604
02:56:25,650 --> 02:56:30,650
no one's signing their fucking work.
So like you're out there and it's like 

3605
02:56:30,650 --> 02:56:33,860
you're standing underneath some out 
chemical like sphere,

3606
02:56:33,880 --> 02:56:35,040
nickel,
laser,

3607
02:56:35,041 --> 02:56:40,041
globe.
That spinning in a way that the lights 

3608
02:56:40,041 --> 02:56:42,561
make it look like the ground you're 
standing on is like rotating and 

3609
02:56:42,561 --> 02:56:43,260
shifting.
Who made that?

3610
02:56:43,470 --> 02:56:46,170
Why did they make that?
How did they get it out in the desert?

3611
02:56:46,290 --> 02:56:49,170
How are they fueling this?
What the fuck is this?

3612
02:56:49,380 --> 02:56:54,380
Or like the Mat.
There's tesla coils everywhere out 

3613
02:56:54,380 --> 02:56:57,141
there.
Like just tesla coils sparking in the 

3614
02:56:57,141 --> 02:56:59,780
fucking middle of the desert.
Someone got a tesla coil out to burn it.

3615
02:56:59,790 --> 02:57:04,790
Like just when you consider getting a 
tesla coil into the middle of the 

3616
02:57:04,790 --> 02:57:06,480
fucking desert and then setting it up.
So it works.

3617
02:57:06,690 --> 02:57:07,860
I think they have videos.
I would.

3618
02:57:07,861 --> 02:57:10,060
If you look at it,
it's pretty cool looking man.

3619
02:57:10,310 --> 02:57:13,350
That just sitting out there.
That's amazing.

3620
02:57:14,520 --> 02:57:16,740
That's amazing.
Just one.

3621
02:57:16,770 --> 02:57:19,130
Just one thing.
Or like Dick Slides.

3622
02:57:19,170 --> 02:57:21,870
What does that giant thing,
that guy next to the tesla coil.

3623
02:57:21,910 --> 02:57:23,130
I don't know.
I didn't see that.

3624
02:57:23,220 --> 02:57:25,590
Who knows?
Floating eyes and what's in his hands.

3625
02:57:25,950 --> 02:57:27,030
I don't know.
Didn't see it.

3626
02:57:27,060 --> 02:57:32,060
They have Dick Slides.
They have like these slides shape like 

3627
02:57:32,060 --> 02:57:34,821
Dick's that you can ride through like 
your sperm getting shot into a pussy 

3628
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:38,760
fucking trippy festival.
It's the coolest thing ever,

3629
02:57:38,761 --> 02:57:43,761
man.
They have an entire spectrum of just 

3630
02:57:43,761 --> 02:57:43,761
insanity out there.
That thing.

3631
02:57:43,761 --> 02:57:44,880
Wow.
Fuck.

3632
02:57:44,881 --> 02:57:46,400
Look at that.
It's pretty amazing.

3633
02:57:46,401 --> 02:57:48,180
Or that.
Look up the catacombs.

3634
02:57:48,181 --> 02:57:53,181
Look up the categories.
These guys made these like crazy 

3635
02:57:53,181 --> 02:57:53,181
pyramids out there.
The catacombs.

3636
02:57:53,181 --> 02:57:56,760
20 16 burning man.
You should look up like the burning.

3637
02:57:56,790 --> 02:57:57,930
Oh,
you're not allowed to show it.

3638
02:57:58,050 --> 02:57:59,580
Well you could show up and you know 
what?

3639
02:58:00,110 --> 02:58:01,980
So these guys made like,
look at

3640
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:03,570
that.
Whoa.

3641
02:58:03,571 --> 02:58:08,571
What is that?
They made these fucking pyramids out 

3642
02:58:08,571 --> 02:58:08,571
there,
man.

3643
02:58:08,571 --> 02:58:09,660
That's a drawing like.
Yeah,

3644
02:58:09,661 --> 02:58:11,370
there it is.
Like with wood,

3645
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:12,390
there it is.

3646
02:58:13,980 --> 02:58:18,980
Yeah,
and they do this during the time that 

3647
02:58:18,980 --> 02:58:18,980
they're there and then they burn it.
They,

3648
02:58:18,980 --> 02:58:21,630
they come in early so they come in like 
a cow like three weeks earlier.

3649
02:58:21,640 --> 02:58:26,640
I'm not sure the exact amount of time 
they construct this thing and then they 

3650
02:58:26,640 --> 02:58:28,110
just fucking burn it.
They burn those things in the morning at

3651
02:58:28,111 --> 02:58:30,330
like 6:00
AM dude.

3652
02:58:30,630 --> 02:58:31,800
Yeah.
You could see.

3653
02:58:31,801 --> 02:58:34,080
Look at the dust devils that kicked up 
next to it.

3654
02:58:34,110 --> 02:58:38,610
Like whoa.
A dust devils are incredible.

3655
02:58:39,330 --> 02:58:40,890
That's wild man.
A little dust.

3656
02:58:40,891 --> 02:58:42,600
Tornadoes and just roam through the 
camps.

3657
02:58:42,601 --> 02:58:44,040
Yeah.
Oh Dude.

3658
02:58:44,041 --> 02:58:47,130
When these storms kick up,
it's the most beautiful,

3659
02:58:47,131 --> 02:58:52,131
insane thing.
It's just all of a sudden out of the 

3660
02:58:52,131 --> 02:58:53,931
blue,
everything goes from being completely 

3661
02:58:53,931 --> 02:58:55,410
clear to just being completely obscured 
with this very fine dust,

3662
02:58:55,411 --> 02:59:00,411
which is why everyone's got led lights 
on because the lights glow through the 

3663
02:59:00,411 --> 02:59:01,170
dust so that you don't run into 
somebody.

3664
02:59:01,380 --> 02:59:03,650
Whoa.
Oh

3665
02:59:03,950 --> 02:59:06,200
yeah.
What a weird choice though.

3666
02:59:06,201 --> 02:59:09,200
Why wouldn't they choose to do it 
somewhere where it's like nice.

3667
02:59:09,890 --> 02:59:11,660
Well,
I think that statement they're making is

3668
02:59:11,661 --> 02:59:13,850
we can do this in the middle of fucking 
death.

3669
02:59:13,851 --> 02:59:15,680
Think what we could see you everywhere 
else.

3670
02:59:16,360 --> 02:59:18,110
You think they did that on purpose?
No,

3671
02:59:18,111 --> 02:59:22,490
I think it evolved like the.
I think that originally the idea was the

3672
02:59:22,491 --> 02:59:25,100
cacophonous had this idea of what's 
called the zone trip,

3673
02:59:25,490 --> 02:59:30,490
which is that if you take a group of 
people and bring them out of their 

3674
02:59:30,490 --> 02:59:33,641
natural habitat and you then something 
kind of magical happens and so there's a

3675
02:59:34,101 --> 02:59:37,430
story of how will.
The first time they went out there,

3676
02:59:37,431 --> 02:59:42,431
they drew a line in the sand and they 
are like everything after this line as 

3677
02:59:43,341 --> 02:59:46,550
the zone and like that's when that was 
the first burning man is.

3678
02:59:46,551 --> 02:59:51,551
It just was like they just picked a 
desolate place so they wouldn't get 

3679
02:59:51,551 --> 02:59:53,030
bothered by people because what was 
happening is.

3680
02:59:54,050 --> 02:59:55,790
I can't remember that.
I think it's Larry.

3681
02:59:55,820 --> 02:59:57,680
Will you look up Larry burning man.
Larry.

3682
02:59:57,681 --> 02:59:59,030
I can't remember his last name.
Really?

3683
02:59:59,360 --> 03:00:00,860
What?
Larry Harvey.

3684
03:00:01,070 --> 03:00:04,550
So what was happening is Larry Harvey 
was going to the beach.

3685
03:00:04,551 --> 03:00:08,960
He went to the beach and they just burnt
this like an effigy of a man.

3686
03:00:08,990 --> 03:00:13,990
Right.
They just ignited this effigy at the 

3687
03:00:13,990 --> 03:00:14,900
beach and Larry Harvey won't say why 
they did it.

3688
03:00:14,930 --> 03:00:15,860
It's really cool.
They won't.

3689
03:00:15,861 --> 03:00:18,710
Everybody wants to know like,
well what was their reason behind it?

3690
03:00:18,860 --> 03:00:23,860
So like they just went and burned this 
avid g out there and then they were 

3691
03:00:23,860 --> 03:00:26,501
doing it like I think a few years in a 
row and it kept getting bigger and 

3692
03:00:26,501 --> 03:00:31,421
bigger and bigger and then the somehow 
the cacophony society got involved 

3693
03:00:31,460 --> 03:00:36,460
because it got so big one year the cops 
wouldn't let him burn it and so then 

3694
03:00:36,460 --> 03:00:40,361
they were like,
they ended up scheduling a cacophonous 

3695
03:00:40,361 --> 03:00:41,740
event,
which is what I've got the flyer,

3696
03:00:41,760 --> 03:00:42,260
my phone.

3697
03:00:42,260 --> 03:00:45,200
It's like the burning of the man and the
black rock desert.

3698
03:00:45,201 --> 03:00:50,201
And so they like redid that event and 
took the burning man out there.

3699
03:00:51,081 --> 03:00:56,081
That was the first burning man.
And then they started doing it every 

3700
03:00:56,081 --> 03:00:56,810
year just like they were doing it at the
beach in San Francisco.

3701
03:00:56,811 --> 03:00:59,950
But it kept getting bigger and bigger 
and bigger.

3702
03:00:59,951 --> 03:01:01,690
And then it became like a.
it's like,

3703
03:01:01,740 --> 03:01:04,270
oh,
it's like a confidence to vent basically

3704
03:01:04,480 --> 03:01:07,690
that spun out of control and now it's 
turned into this.

3705
03:01:08,170 --> 03:01:13,170
I think.
What is one of the largest festivals on 

3706
03:01:13,170 --> 03:01:13,170
earth?
Look,

3707
03:01:13,170 --> 03:01:13,170
when is it?
When does it take place?

3708
03:01:13,170 --> 03:01:15,370
Labor Day weekend with the.
I'm not sure.

3709
03:01:15,850 --> 03:01:18,880
Like the first week in September last 
week in August summer,

3710
03:01:18,881 --> 03:01:21,880
so it just ended the summer,
so it just ended a few weeks ago.

3711
03:01:22,300 --> 03:01:23,560
Well,
I think you can look it up.

3712
03:01:23,561 --> 03:01:25,600
I'm not sure that data.
That can be totally off on that.

3713
03:01:25,660 --> 03:01:27,010
I don't know.
Either way.

3714
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:29,920
It doesn't matter.
I'm sounds crazy.

3715
03:01:30,230 --> 03:01:31,510
It sounds amazing.
Yeah.

3716
03:01:31,540 --> 03:01:32,800
Yeah.
It's pretty incredible,

3717
03:01:32,801 --> 03:01:34,090
man.
It's pretty cool.

3718
03:01:34,091 --> 03:01:34,930
You got to go,
man.

3719
03:01:34,931 --> 03:01:37,060
Go next year.
I feel like maybe I do have to go,

3720
03:01:37,240 --> 03:01:38,560
but when you go,
you got to do it,

3721
03:01:38,561 --> 03:01:43,561
right man,
because the problem is like a lot of 

3722
03:01:43,561 --> 03:01:43,561
people,
they're like,

3723
03:01:43,561 --> 03:01:43,690
I mean you could do it whatever way you 
want,

3724
03:01:43,691 --> 03:01:45,220
but there's like,
are you telling people how to do it?

3725
03:01:45,760 --> 03:01:48,100
I'm going to tell you how to do it.
I'll tell you how to not do it.

3726
03:01:48,130 --> 03:01:49,450
How do you not do it?
Well,

3727
03:01:49,451 --> 03:01:52,270
you heard what happened to the camp,
the wide ocean camp out there,

3728
03:01:52,271 --> 03:01:54,730
right?
What's the wide ocean camp?

3729
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:57,310
So there these camps called like,
you know what the White Ocean camp is?

3730
03:01:57,620 --> 03:02:00,060
I think that's that story.
I don't want wanna blow story Buchloh it

3731
03:02:00,230 --> 03:02:05,230
when you want to see people's power 
lines and shit because it's like the 

3732
03:02:05,230 --> 03:02:09,751
problem is like there's like you could 
be a little too inclusive there and so 

3733
03:02:09,751 --> 03:02:14,040
you end up like part of what's cool 
about that thing is like a.

3734
03:02:14,270 --> 03:02:16,090
The thing I saw in an interview with 
Larry Harvey,

3735
03:02:16,091 --> 03:02:18,130
he's like,
this is a survival situation,

3736
03:02:18,200 --> 03:02:19,960
right?
So it's tough.

3737
03:02:20,260 --> 03:02:22,750
It's not easy all the way through.
Like you,

3738
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:25,420
you got to get out there in a fucking 
rv.

3739
03:02:25,421 --> 03:02:27,070
We drove an rv out there,
man.

3740
03:02:27,071 --> 03:02:31,030
Now that's hard or anything,
but it's like when you're driving an Rv,

3741
03:02:31,410 --> 03:02:36,410
I'm out of burning man.
It's not easy because it's a eight hour 

3742
03:02:36,410 --> 03:02:41,281
line.
Get out of burning man in the morning 

3743
03:02:41,281 --> 03:02:41,350
and your rv.
You're sitting in a fucking rv for eight

3744
03:02:41,380 --> 03:02:46,380
hours and this massive line of people 
who are being pulsed out of burning man 

3745
03:02:46,661 --> 03:02:51,661
because there's only one road out,
so this is every time you want to leave 

3746
03:02:51,661 --> 03:02:53,850
through any day of burning man to leave 
early.

3747
03:02:53,890 --> 03:02:56,470
You won't have to wait that long.
But if you go through the whole festival

3748
03:02:56,471 --> 03:02:57,880
it takes that long to get out.

3749
03:02:57,880 --> 03:03:00,630
And so the point is it's not easy.
It's not.

3750
03:03:00,700 --> 03:03:02,950
It's not necessarily supposed to be 
easy.

3751
03:03:02,951 --> 03:03:07,951
Like it's like part of it's really 
fucking hard and like really tries you 

3752
03:03:07,951 --> 03:03:10,320
for real.
Like it's like you're going to get it.

3753
03:03:10,321 --> 03:03:12,160
It's true.
It's not easy.

3754
03:03:12,220 --> 03:03:17,220
So some people think that like there are
people who are kind of subverting the 

3755
03:03:17,501 --> 03:03:22,501
experience a little bit by like flying 
in on a private jet and then being 

3756
03:03:22,501 --> 03:03:26,170
brought to a place that's already been 
built for them where they get to kind of

3757
03:03:26,350 --> 03:03:31,350
hang out and then that place is like 
theoretically it's not so easy for 

3758
03:03:31,350 --> 03:03:33,160
people to get in there.
Even though wide ocean,

3759
03:03:33,161 --> 03:03:34,990
like one of them at one of the things 
they said was like,

3760
03:03:34,991 --> 03:03:36,550
well,
we're giving food to people,

3761
03:03:36,790 --> 03:03:41,790
but it's,
there's an embarrassing embarrassing 

3762
03:03:41,790 --> 03:03:45,751
post.
One of the guys from wide ocean put up 

3763
03:03:45,751 --> 03:03:46,540
like what you did do us,
and it was like a guy who clearly didn't

3764
03:03:46,541 --> 03:03:48,370
get the whole point of the thing,
which is like,

3765
03:03:48,970 --> 03:03:52,090
seriously though,
why would they do that?

3766
03:03:52,180 --> 03:03:57,180
Instead of just complaining or just 
talking to them like why would they cut 

3767
03:03:57,180 --> 03:03:57,980
their power?
Why would they make

3768
03:03:57,980 --> 03:04:00,740
their food spoil?
That doesn't seem like a logical choice,

3769
03:04:00,741 --> 03:04:01,490
right?
Dude,

3770
03:04:01,720 --> 03:04:05,960
there's some good.
Is that a logical choice for me?

3771
03:04:06,320 --> 03:04:07,370
No.
Hell No.

3772
03:04:07,371 --> 03:04:12,371
Of course not,
but they think it makes sense to them 

3773
03:04:12,371 --> 03:04:12,620
that they cut the power and they 
sabotage these people's food.

3774
03:04:12,800 --> 03:04:15,050
I think that that's what they did,
right?

3775
03:04:15,350 --> 03:04:15,950
Well,
yeah.

3776
03:04:15,951 --> 03:04:20,951
They fucked up their camp.
They apparently glued there doors shut 

3777
03:04:20,951 --> 03:04:24,701
and stuff,
but that seems contrary to the idea 

3778
03:04:24,701 --> 03:04:24,701
behind the event itself.
Well,

3779
03:04:24,701 --> 03:04:27,140
that's the crowdsource.
No one idea at that event.

3780
03:04:27,141 --> 03:04:31,430
You're hearing my perspective.
My perspective is one thing,

3781
03:04:31,550 --> 03:04:33,500
but that ain't the only fucking 
perspective.

3782
03:04:33,520 --> 03:04:35,660
Dude.
There's like a bunch of people out there

3783
03:04:35,870 --> 03:04:38,750
who aren't there for a laugh.
There's like people who are like,

3784
03:04:39,080 --> 03:04:44,080
I mean God.
Have you seen the gladiator ring they 

3785
03:04:44,080 --> 03:04:45,620
have there or they slam people to who 
fight or the fucking fisting tent or the

3786
03:04:46,100 --> 03:04:49,520
fisting tent.
Like fisting in the genital fisting.

3787
03:04:49,570 --> 03:04:50,240
He,
yeah,

3788
03:04:50,570 --> 03:04:52,770
they have a tent for that.
They have an orgy tent.

3789
03:04:52,850 --> 03:04:54,860
Fistula tent for fisting.
Yeah,

3790
03:04:54,861 --> 03:04:57,380
there a fisting tent.
I didn't go to it,

3791
03:04:57,381 --> 03:05:02,381
but I heard about it.
How would you not go to it if it was 

3792
03:05:02,381 --> 03:05:02,381
there?

3793
03:05:02,381 --> 03:05:04,340
I don't know man.
If you build it,

3794
03:05:04,341 --> 03:05:07,130
they will come visit one of those things
where the only way in is someone's got a

3795
03:05:07,131 --> 03:05:10,550
fistula because that would stop me.
But.

3796
03:05:10,580 --> 03:05:15,580
Or You could fit them.
Would you be in a fist in somebody you 

3797
03:05:15,580 --> 03:05:15,590
know,
I just to see what's like,

3798
03:05:15,800 --> 03:05:18,050
I think I can imagine what it's like.
I don't,

3799
03:05:18,140 --> 03:05:20,700
I don't know.
That particular thing isn't like,

3800
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:22,370
it doesn't appeal to me.
But uh,

3801
03:05:22,590 --> 03:05:27,470
I do like the openness of it and I do 
like the fact that like eventually after

3802
03:05:27,471 --> 03:05:29,900
a bunch of people walking around naked 
for a week,

3803
03:05:29,901 --> 03:05:33,050
you stopped seeing naked people and one 
of the people in my camp,

3804
03:05:33,051 --> 03:05:38,051
it could be a lie,
they say they have something called 

3805
03:05:38,051 --> 03:05:40,900
acceptable boner Tuesday where Pete guys
will take fucking cialis and just walk 

3806
03:05:41,781 --> 03:05:45,470
around with fucking bonkers.
It's crazy,

3807
03:05:45,471 --> 03:05:46,970
dude.
I got my own ideas of it.

3808
03:05:46,971 --> 03:05:48,650
But like,
there isn't one idea about it,

3809
03:05:48,651 --> 03:05:50,630
man.
It's not like a tame.

3810
03:05:51,020 --> 03:05:51,650
There you go.

3811
03:05:51,940 --> 03:05:56,940
Orgy Dome rules.
One couples and Morrison's.

3812
03:05:58,240 --> 03:05:59,920
Morrison's only.
Yeah.

3813
03:06:00,440 --> 03:06:01,360
Why is that?
It's more sums.

3814
03:06:01,361 --> 03:06:03,670
Okay.
To take off your shoes.

3815
03:06:03,671 --> 03:06:08,671
Okay.
One couples and Morrison's only meaning 

3816
03:06:08,671 --> 03:06:08,671
that you can't come in there by 
yourself.

3817
03:06:08,671 --> 03:06:12,200
Who is your gym here to fuck?
You got to bring someone that fuck you.

3818
03:06:12,520 --> 03:06:15,400
Take off your shoes.
Use Blue towels under.

3819
03:06:15,401 --> 03:06:18,760
You asked before you touch,
clean up and throw everything away.

3820
03:06:18,910 --> 03:06:20,950
Clothes and zip.
Both doors.

3821
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:24,520
Hilarious.
The orgy dome rules.

3822
03:06:25,120 --> 03:06:27,220
That's uh,
that's amazing.

3823
03:06:27,490 --> 03:06:29,380
Yeah.
That's amazing.

3824
03:06:30,160 --> 03:06:35,160
But it's not shocking.
All those people took a photo of the 

3825
03:06:35,160 --> 03:06:35,160
orgy dome.
Yeah,

3826
03:06:35,160 --> 03:06:35,160
they're all,
they're like,

3827
03:06:35,160 --> 03:06:35,350
hey,
we fucked.

3828
03:06:35,650 --> 03:06:37,300
Knowing that.
It's like not a big deal.

3829
03:06:37,510 --> 03:06:39,940
It really though,
isn't that big a deal if you think about

3830
03:06:39,941 --> 03:06:44,941
it,
like we're not like we make it a big 

3831
03:06:44,941 --> 03:06:44,941
deal.
It's not that big a deal.

3832
03:06:44,941 --> 03:06:44,941
It's a big deal because we decided it's 
a big deal,

3833
03:06:44,941 --> 03:06:48,250
but it's something that everybody does.
Like sex is what either everybody does.

3834
03:06:48,251 --> 03:06:53,251
Everybody wants to do.
Almost nobody except the rare few that 

3835
03:06:53,251 --> 03:06:53,251
are actually asexual.
Yeah.

3836
03:06:53,251 --> 03:06:58,050
It's something that everybody does and 
yet we make it out to be this horrible 

3837
03:06:58,050 --> 03:06:58,050
thing.
Yeah,

3838
03:06:58,050 --> 03:06:58,530
and that's a very like if you're into 
sex,

3839
03:06:58,531 --> 03:07:00,710
definitely that's a great festival for 
you because.

3840
03:07:00,750 --> 03:07:01,530
Perfect.
Yeah,

3841
03:07:01,531 --> 03:07:06,531
there's a lot of like,
stuff like that that goes on and 

3842
03:07:06,531 --> 03:07:06,531
everyone's super like.
I mean,

3843
03:07:06,531 --> 03:07:08,280
I don't know that the fucking gladiator 
dome.

3844
03:07:08,340 --> 03:07:10,230
So what does that mean?
That I was at all metal or wood?

3845
03:07:10,260 --> 03:07:15,260
That's metal I think so you can like 
climb up there and watch as they like 

3846
03:07:15,260 --> 03:07:15,300
slam these people together.

3847
03:07:15,330 --> 03:07:19,560
So it's like a mad max fighting.
Will they take these people,

3848
03:07:19,561 --> 03:07:23,330
put them in these harnesses and these 
ropes getting kicked?

3849
03:07:23,370 --> 03:07:24,470
Yeah.
Is he getting kicked?

3850
03:07:24,490 --> 03:07:25,680
Yeah,
he's getting kicked.

3851
03:07:25,710 --> 03:07:28,940
So the the swing and they beat the shit 
out of each other in there.

3852
03:07:29,880 --> 03:07:31,980
Wow.
This has been Nana's.

3853
03:07:32,250 --> 03:07:34,440
Is there video of this shit or just 
videos?

3854
03:07:34,980 --> 03:07:37,830
Go right to that police.
The battle.

3855
03:07:38,050 --> 03:07:40,470
The thunder dome.
This is real.

3856
03:07:40,770 --> 03:07:42,540
Yeah man.
Oh my God.

3857
03:07:43,140 --> 03:07:48,140
What in the.
They're hitting each other or hitting 

3858
03:07:48,140 --> 03:07:48,140
each other with sticks.
Sticks,

3859
03:07:48,140 --> 03:07:49,690
sticks.
But you could definitely kick pI.

3860
03:07:49,770 --> 03:07:51,690
mean,
it definitely doesn't feel good.

3861
03:07:51,930 --> 03:07:53,460
Wow.
This is nuts man.

3862
03:07:53,970 --> 03:07:55,620
Yeah,
this is really strange.

3863
03:07:56,530 --> 03:07:59,730
Hear his people screaming and yelling.
Yeah.

3864
03:08:00,240 --> 03:08:05,070
What a fucking trip.
And they police in this at all.

3865
03:08:05,100 --> 03:08:08,040
There's cops everywhere.
Cops everywhere in burning man.

3866
03:08:08,310 --> 03:08:10,050
There's cops.
Oh my God.

3867
03:08:10,080 --> 03:08:11,410
Who would the cops what?

3868
03:08:11,610 --> 03:08:13,950
There's cops walking around with cop 
outfits on.

3869
03:08:14,040 --> 03:08:19,040
There's costs with the cop outfits and 
undercover cops with the cop outfits.

3870
03:08:19,290 --> 03:08:24,290
What do they do?
They just wait for someone to shoot 

3871
03:08:24,290 --> 03:08:24,470
somebody beat somebody up or something 
like.

3872
03:08:24,660 --> 03:08:26,840
So I got to tell you man,
I was.

3873
03:08:26,841 --> 03:08:31,841
I most of the cops I saw,
they seem to be having really funny 

3874
03:08:31,841 --> 03:08:32,290
conversations with people at burning 
man.

3875
03:08:32,291 --> 03:08:34,470
We were just talking to them like some 
of them are,

3876
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:35,400
you know,
there are arrests,

3877
03:08:35,401 --> 03:08:39,780
but like from what I saw there,
it's not like the after.

3878
03:08:39,840 --> 03:08:43,020
I think for a cop after being at burning
man for three days,

3879
03:08:43,530 --> 03:08:48,530
I think their perspective starts 
changing maybe a little bit because 

3880
03:08:48,530 --> 03:08:48,600
they're in this weirdness just like 
everybody else.

3881
03:08:48,601 --> 03:08:53,601
I don't know,
maybe that's naive to say there's 

3882
03:08:53,601 --> 03:08:55,860
undercover cops there and people from my
camp said one of the things that people 

3883
03:08:55,860 --> 03:09:00,021
do is they'll go to where there's like a
party or a rave and yeah,

3884
03:09:01,081 --> 03:09:01,460
there you go.

3885
03:09:01,490 --> 03:09:02,860
OPS on Atvs.
Yeah,

3886
03:09:02,870 --> 03:09:06,360
there you go with the Times.
Yeah.

3887
03:09:07,110 --> 03:09:09,390
It's pretty funny.
They're just like doing that.

3888
03:09:09,420 --> 03:09:12,870
But like one of the,
one of the things they do is they go,

3889
03:09:12,990 --> 03:09:17,990
they'll go to like with monopoly money 
with like fake money and fake plastic 

3890
03:09:18,151 --> 03:09:23,151
bags and do fake drug deals so that 
suddenly the undercover cops will come 

3891
03:09:23,221 --> 03:09:28,221
out and then they can.
Then they will follow the undercover 

3892
03:09:28,221 --> 03:09:28,221
cops,
you know,

3893
03:09:28,221 --> 03:09:29,830
because it draws them out.
Yeah,

3894
03:09:30,200 --> 03:09:32,930
it's pretty cool.
They do fake drug deals.

3895
03:09:33,360 --> 03:09:36,150
That's what I heard with fake money.
I don't know if that's true.

3896
03:09:36,151 --> 03:09:38,980
I don't know if it's true or not and 
let's end on that.

3897
03:09:39,100 --> 03:09:39,840
All right,
cool.

3898
03:09:39,841 --> 03:09:42,990
You've changed my perspective of burning
man here,

3899
03:09:43,450 --> 03:09:48,450
man.
I'm glad we talked about on the podcast 

3900
03:09:48,450 --> 03:09:50,841
because I'm glad we stopped the 
conversation on the phone because you 

3901
03:09:50,841 --> 03:09:50,841
were so adamant about.
I'm like,

3902
03:09:50,841 --> 03:09:52,050
we got to talk about this.
I'm glad we did,

3903
03:09:52,051 --> 03:09:53,070
man.
Okay,

3904
03:09:53,080 --> 03:09:55,270
now I'm super compelled.
Alright,

3905
03:09:55,300 --> 03:09:57,110
see you next year.
The end.

3906
03:09:58,210 --> 03:09:58,530
Cool.

3907
03:10:00,710 --> 03:10:03,740
Awesome.
That was great.

3908
03:10:03,741 --> 03:10:04,970
That was so fun.
