00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:03,500
When I,

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,040
when I got out of high school,

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,520
um,

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,120
I went to art school for a year or two
and then I dropped out and I was just

6
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:09,630
like,

7
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,280
how am I going to make
a living doing this?

8
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:11,621
And I,

9
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:14,370
and I got all my best
drawings and I went to,

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,960
I think it was cal arts,

11
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:16,794
it was like a,

12
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,660
it's like a open call,

13
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:18,991
like in,

14
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:21,360
it's like every single animation studio,

15
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,190
every single advertising agency.

16
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,510
And I got there and it's all these fucking
kids with all their art and there's

17
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,380
really long lines to talk to a guy that
like has a pencil behind his ear and

18
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:32,214
goes,

19
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,140
work on this work on this.

20
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,070
And I was like,

21
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,970
fuck this.

22
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:36,781
And so I was like,

23
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:37,830
I'm not even going to wait in this line.

24
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:41,520
So I went and I went to go take a piss
and I saw one of the advertising guys get

25
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,710
up and I followed him to
the bathroom and I said,

26
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,790
I pulled one of those.

27
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,120
Well,

28
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,871
while his Dick's out,

29
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:46,260
I'm like,

30
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:46,441
Hey,

31
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:46,980
look at,

32
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,960
look at this cross hatch
penis will get this.

33
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:49,350
And he's like,

34
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,590
Hey,

35
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,030
you can't wait in line like everyone else.

36
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:51,271
I'm like,

37
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:51,511
dude,

38
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,261
I'm pleased.

39
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,580
And he like looked over and he's like,

40
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:54,360
Hey,

41
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,193
that's pretty good.

42
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,520
And so he's got his dick out and,

43
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,120
and a nice fat Dick Dude.

44
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,220
Now he gives,

45
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,330
he gives me his card and he goes,

46
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,250
you're fucking dope man.

47
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,150
You should come to my
office in Beverly Hills.

48
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:09,060
And I was like either 20 or 21.

49
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:09,894
And I was like,

50
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,913
yes.

51
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,970
And it's the,

52
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,550
it's one of the biggest
advertising agencies in La.

53
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,250
I show up there like with
a tie on and everything.

54
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,020
And as I walked down the hallway,

55
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:20,670
it's like every movie poster.

56
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,953
And uh,

57
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,243
I was like,

58
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,203
I made it,

59
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,870
I'm fucking like young and I'm
going to make a living drawing.

60
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,790
Like this is fucking crazy.

61
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,730
So I think back then,

62
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:33,630
I don't know how it is now.

63
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,260
They would have all these
artists draw in the style.

64
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:38,320
I forgotten drew Struzan,

65
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,970
that's that star wars a
painted all the star wars.

66
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,660
These guys all draw that same style and
you draw the movie poster and then they

67
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,260
give that to the photographer.

68
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,550
And the photographer,

69
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,330
because you know,

70
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,950
there's no art in movie posters now,

71
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,031
and this is,

72
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,010
I'm talking about fucking 20 years ago,

73
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:57,930
so I'm sure it's different now.

74
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,750
And it was a avalanche movie with Chris.

75
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,600
No,

76
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:03,870
crystal.

77
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,231
Donald.

78
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:05,070
Crystal Donald.

79
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,670
I think that the movie
was called avalanche.

80
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,170
Yeah.

81
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,700
And so I sat in the room and I was like,

82
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:09,481
this is so cool.

83
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:11,130
I get to see a movie before it came out,

84
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:11,790
you know?

85
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,181
And I'm like,

86
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:13,770
this movie fucking sucks.

87
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,090
And then I'm sitting there watching
it with like six old guys with like

88
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:19,720
cigarettes daily dangling
out of their mouth.

89
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:19,980
I'm like,

90
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,790
all right guys,

91
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,660
we need avalanches.

92
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:22,680
We need this and this.

93
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:24,930
We need Chris O'donnell looking like this.

94
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:25,980
And I'm like,

95
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,000
this is amazing.

96
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:27,181
You know?

97
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:31,020
And I sit in a room and I draw Chris
O'donnell and there's a poster,

98
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,760
vertical,

99
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,111
vertical,

100
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:32,761
vertical limit.

101
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:33,594
There it is.

102
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,880
I think I drew that Bill Paxton.

103
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,863
Well that's what you do.

104
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,833
Yeah,

105
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,100
that's pretty exact.

106
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,250
Willem defoe was the guy in the back,

107
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,610
I don't remember who got
the Glenn Scott Glenn.

108
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,001
Oh,

109
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:45,361
that guy.

110
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:45,541
Yeah,

111
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:45,810
he's,

112
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,643
that guy is awesome.

113
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,880
So I got all their headshots,

114
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,803
I'm drawing them,

115
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,430
the art directors coming in and he's like,

116
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,260
you know,

117
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,940
it's amazing.

118
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,370
He starts with the compliment Dave.

119
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:53,791
That's great.

120
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:54,391
Can you do it again?

121
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,320
Like a little bit smirk,

122
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,020
a little bit more heroic and then,

123
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,993
um,

124
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,240
not even a day in,

125
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm like,

126
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,953
I hate this job.

127
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,460
I just drew fucking crystal Donald
and same thing at the same thought.

128
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,210
Then I'm like,

129
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,380
how did this movie get made?

130
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:08,980
Right?

131
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,671
Like it's horrible.

132
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:09,970
Like,

133
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,570
like who?

134
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,403
Like,

135
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:11,771
like,

136
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:12,371
why don't crystal,

137
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,600
Donald's a beautiful man.

138
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,940
I just want to see him.

139
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,240
It's a good date night movie.

140
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,560
And so I already safe.

141
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,820
I lasted at that job,

142
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,683
you know,

143
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,400
when you say like you got to draw shit,

144
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,263
like yeah.

145
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,780
The next one was like a Sandra Bullock
movie where she's an alcoholic,

146
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,280
the 28 days or something and
you know that that whole like,

147
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:30,491
Hey,

148
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:33,940
I'm somewhat part of Showbiz and I'm
working and I'm making the good money.

149
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,760
I walked into the guy's
office less than a month in.

150
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,680
I said like,

151
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,670
thank you for this honor.

152
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,780
I appreciate it like this.

153
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:43,210
I learned so much I can't do it.

154
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,223
He's like,

155
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,190
what are you talking about?

156
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,570
Like you see that line,

157
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,680
you see how many people would die?

158
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,161
He's like,

159
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:48,431
Dave.

160
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,030
And he closes the door.

161
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,331
He was like,

162
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,164
I'm going to tell you something.

163
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,790
You remind me of me.

164
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,451
Like 20 years ago,

165
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:53,700
the fucking crazy hair.

166
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,990
You got like that fucking
punk rock attitude.

167
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,510
If you stay here and
you do what I tell you,

168
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,940
you could be running this
fucking place in like 20 years.

169
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,800
And I was like,

170
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,510
oh well you only gave me a nice ego.

171
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,410
Boost the devil.

172
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,681
Yeah.

173
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:06,160
And I'm like,

174
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,140
I wonder if he said this to
all those guys out there,

175
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,890
you know?

176
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,170
And because I was the
youngest guy there and I go,

177
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,760
I can't even believe I'm telling you.

178
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,270
Like,

179
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,050
like I said,

180
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,520
thank you for this opportunity.

181
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,170
I can't do this though.

182
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,561
I can't.

183
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:17,711
Like,

184
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,600
I feel like art is my passion.

185
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:20,021
I love it.

186
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:22,120
I feel like I'm dying here and you know,

187
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,750
cause I thought,

188
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:22,871
oh,

189
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:24,310
I could draw crystal Donal all day.

190
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,910
And then at night I could
draw whatever I want,

191
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,440
a or fifteens and buttholes,

192
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,390
but muscle memory.

193
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,980
I had just spent the entire day training
my hand to draw into drew Struzan style

194
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,330
style of Chris O'donnell.

195
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,130
I get home and I want to do my shit.

196
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:39,520
And I'm like,

197
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,700
Oh fuck that butthole looks
like crystal Donald's face,

198
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,923
you know?

199
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,110
So I tell the guy,

200
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:44,321
go,

201
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,154
hey look,

202
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,410
I can't believe this great
opportunity you gave me,

203
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:47,950
but I'm going to,

204
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,410
I'm going to have to re
regretfully decline this thing.

205
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:51,210
And he goes,

206
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:51,460
oh,

207
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,480
what are you going to do Dave?

208
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,010
Draw your funny books.

209
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,390
He didn't say it in that voice,

210
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,224
but he's like,

211
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,741
he's like,

212
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:57,574
what's like mocking?

213
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:57,950
No.

214
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,520
Yeah,

215
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,470
not like hardcore,

216
00:04:59,471 --> 00:04:59,831
but he's like,

217
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:00,664
what are you going to do?

218
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,630
And he's like,

219
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,463
good luck with that.

220
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,341
And I was like,

221
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,174
you know what I,

222
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,250
I've made at that young at that,

223
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,850
it's,

224
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,500
it's the,

225
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,880
it's for me the saddest thing when I
see young people that have already like

226
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,560
given,

227
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,420
and I'm like,

228
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,830
that's the time you fight.

229
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,640
That's the time that you should
try and fail and try again.

230
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,290
And then it's like when you get old,

231
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:20,560
you're like,

232
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,520
at least I tried.

233
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,630
It didn't work out,

234
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,680
you know.

235
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,340
So I said,

236
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,791
look man,

237
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,150
I'm going to go for it and if
I end up fucking broke or poor,

238
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,551
whatever,

239
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,510
then fuck it,

240
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:28,810
you know,

241
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,501
at least I tried,

242
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:30,320
you know?

243
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,810
And,

244
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,720
and the next next job from
that was drawing a midgets and,

245
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,160
and,

246
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,280
and bottles for Hustler.

247
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:36,790
So I was like,

248
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,510
yes,

249
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,720
I get to at least draw what I want
to draw and buttholes for Hustler.

250
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:40,901
Yeah.

251
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:44,980
Worked for like Asian fever and the
whole Larry Flynt trying to monetize a

252
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:45,850
creative vision.

253
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,750
It's always,

254
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,190
it's really important that you try to
figure out what is unique in your head and

255
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:54,390
that what is in your head and if you,

256
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,360
how do you get it out?

257
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,010
And if you want to bring up
the Chappelle show or anything,

258
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,580
it's like this whole like,

259
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,380
like I don't want to start my own network.

260
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,940
I don't want to start my
own publishing company.

261
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:04,040
It's like I'm just going
to do whatever I want,

262
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,830
knowing that it's not
gonna make any money.

263
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,850
And then what always happens is
because it's so unique and whatever,

264
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:11,750
it does make money.

265
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,351
Oh,

266
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:13,880
that's so easy for you now Dave,

267
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:14,691
cause you have fuck you money.

268
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm like,

269
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,980
how do you think I got it?

270
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,710
How do you think I fucking got it right?

271
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,370
It does.

272
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,450
You like to still be
working for that advertiser,

273
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:21,681
right,

274
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,460
exactly.

275
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,160
I take the chance when I had
nothing and I had nothing to nude,

276
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,070
they say the rich and the poor have more
in common than the middle class because

277
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,810
they both like if you're poor,

278
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:30,051
you're like,

279
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:30,231
hey,

280
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,100
I got nothing to lose.

281
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,630
If I get sued or whatever,

282
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:32,890
I'm like,

283
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,380
they could take my fucking
toilet paper roll or whatever,

284
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:36,830
you know?

285
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,850
So I dunno.

286
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,020
Okay.
