1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,150
We live,

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,120
you just gave me a three.
There was no to those.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,020
That was just a three.
I get,

4
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:15,440
I keep waiting for the to the Joe Rogan 
experience podcast is brought to you by.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:21,220
If you go to a Rogan.ting.com,
it will explain what the fuck ting is 

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,260
and it will also give you $50 off of any
of the smartphones that ting has in 

7
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:29,480
their,
their lineup they have.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,680
Um,
what ting is,

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,010
is like a non evil cell phone company 
and what they're doing is they use the 

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,500
sprint backbone.
You don't have to have a contract,

11
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:40,250
you cancel anytime you want.
It's,

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,370
there's a lot of great deals where you 
can combine your minutes,

13
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:45,890
like you and your wife can share minutes
or something like that.

14
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:47,570
Or you and your husband or you and your 
boyfriend.

15
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:49,910
If you're a guy.
I don't give a fuck.

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,430
Okay.
That's not what I'm saying.

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,150
What I'm saying is ting has some pretty 
dope phones.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,240
All the high end android phones,
you can get 50 bucks off of one of 

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,171
those.
And the way they have it set up is they 

20
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:07,340
use the same backbone that's apprentice.
Sprint is on,

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,590
so you're not on a mickey mouse 
coverage,

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,620
you get like a,
like one of the top cell phone providers

23
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:16,700
in the country as far as like your 
signal goes.

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,070
Joey Diaz swears by that sprints shit 
dog.

25
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,880
That's all.
That's all.

26
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:23,330
I have a goal with sprint to the end.
Um,

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,390
but it also has four g connections and 
they also have great fonts like Brian 

28
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,420
and I both have the Samsung Galaxy s 
three and it's fucking sick.

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,060
It's a great phone.
It makes iphones look really stupid.

30
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:40,061
Like if you try to like,
look at pictures and go on the Internet 

31
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:40,061
and it makes so much sense.

32
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:40,370
This sweet camera to.
It's a pretty,

33
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,070
pretty fucking dope phone.
They all,

34
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,110
they have ever pretty much everyone now.
I think they even have the note.

35
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,310
Yeah,
they have the note too.

36
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,240
So,
uh,

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,690
they,
they,

38
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:52,691
uh,
they essentially have all of the high 

39
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:52,691
end.
They have the note.

40
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:56,740
Yeah.
The Samsung Galaxy note to which is the 

41
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,470
newest one.
I'm all the high end android devices.

42
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:02,471
They even have flip phones if you're a 
fucking Weirdo and you want to get some 

43
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:05,950
little shitty ass flip phone that 
doesn't do anything and you get a text 

44
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:05,950
with your thumbs if that's your shit,
Dana White,

45
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,790
just going to say this,
anti tend to that.

46
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,830
He's got a little flip phones.
But um,

47
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,970
if you're,
if you're into that,

48
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:14,000
they have that stupid shit as well,
but it's an excellent company.

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,600
It's an ethical company.
They provide you with an excellent 

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,451
service and it's very reasonable prices 
and they haven't set up that if you 

51
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:27,911
don't use the minutes,
like if you say you're going to use a 

52
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:27,911
certain amount,
you only use half of them,

53
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:29,390
they refund you money on your next bill.

54
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,270
I mean it's just a fucking great company
and that's why we,

55
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:33,680
uh,
that's what we do business with them.

56
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,550
We're also brought to you by 
onnit.Rogan.ting.com

57
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:39,890
soccer.
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,590
dot com on ig.com.
That's o n n I t.

59
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,990
and if you've never been there,
Josh Barnett,

60
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,630
you should go because it's all shit that
you would be into.

61
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,810
It's manly shit.
Like we sell kettle bells and battle 

62
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:52,810
ropes.
Okay.

63
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,500
Battle Bells.
We need to get those.

64
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,320
How do you see that?
They have.

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,440
Well,
we have a bunch of different fitness 

66
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:02,440
shit.
We have um,

67
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,650
a medicine balls,
which I've just started using medicine 

68
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:05,650
balls.
Right.

69
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,220
That's excellent.
You can put bengay on your nuts,

70
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,370
right?
That is a painful medicine.

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Yeah.
Have you ever actually put Bengay and 

72
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:14,800
your boss?
Have you ever done that?

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,940
Just for a recreational purpose.
I shaved my balls once and I put 

74
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,360
aftershave on my balls to see what it 
would feel like.

75
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,020
Oh my.
So you're getting a blow job to remind 

76
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,291
her of her dad was a terrible mistake.
It was unbelievably painful.

77
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,490
I thought.
How painful could it be?

78
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:31,110
It's just,
you know,

79
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,270
skin like you look,
if you shave your face,

80
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,910
then you put after shave on,
you get the splash of light,

81
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,710
but it's okay.
I'm like,

82
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,800
how much worse could it be on my balls?
It's a lot worse.

83
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,900
It's exponentially worse.
So totally different experience.

84
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,940
Uh,
what shape did you.

85
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,380
Were you,
were you a Stetson man?

86
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,210
No,
I went with one of those black velvet.

87
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,430
Those blick or what did I put on my 
face?

88
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,680
No spice old spice.
That's good.

89
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:54,880
Yeah.
That can go with.

90
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,740
I go with old spice deodorant.
Old Spice Guy.

91
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,830
Like old spice.
Did you do the home alone slap to your 

92
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,830
balls afterwards?
No,

93
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,700
I squeeze them tight because they were 
furious.

94
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,260
I grabbed them and squeeze them as if I 
was somehow or another.

95
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:11,590
They're going to stop the pain by 
squeezing my balls and I'm telling you,

96
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:13,640
you're just going to give a girl a 
flashback or.

97
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,770
Oh my God,
it's Grandpa.

98
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,370
GRANDPA again.
Well,

99
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,100
you know the old spice on the COC.
Oh,

100
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,220
Jesus did not know where you're going 
with that.

101
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,150
Just wherever I go with it,
it's always going to be bad.

102
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:28,990
Bad,
bad.

103
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,110
Josh Barnett.
I like the sound of this ting.

104
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,200
That sounds pretty awesome.
Although at first I thought it was like 

105
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,770
someone's massive joke on like Asians 
and cell phones.

106
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:38,980
Right.

107
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,160
That would be rude.
That would be rude as fuck.

108
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,600
No,
it's just a name.

109
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,980
What is t?
His is a Tang.

110
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,130
Does it mean anything?
What is it tingling.

111
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:49,960
Is it like a technical term or anything 
like that?

112
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:54,961
Oh No,
like Ping Ping is if you send a packet 

113
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,980
on the Internet,
so somewhere when it hits the next 

114
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:58,980
server it sends you like the time and 
that's a pain.

115
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,500
The server was important back in the 
quake days.

116
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,910
Oh yeah.
You got a ping.

117
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:06,530
The server is checked to see what your 
latency.

118
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,540
Yeah.
You want to be able to fuck people up 

119
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:11,540
when they can't fuck you up and then 
you.

120
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,130
But no matter what,
when you're losing,

121
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,150
you're doing shitty.
It's like,

122
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,390
Oh God damn it,
I fucking lag the lag.

123
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:16,890
Got Me.
Me.

124
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,810
Anyway,
on it.com

125
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,080
o n n I t we have a bunch of different 
packages now,

126
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,440

127
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:26,640

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,301

Basically what happens a lot is the 

130
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:38,871
we'll talk about shit on the show that I
really liked and we'll wind up just 

131
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:38,871
selling it on it.
Just because it's awesome.

132
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,230
That's how it is with those Blendtec 
blenders.

133
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,870
That's how it is with this,
uh,

134
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,920
extreme kettlebell cardio workout DVD.
It's a fucking phenomenal workout.

135
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,950
It's,
if you can get through that with a 50 

136
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,660
pound kettle bell and you could do 45 
minutes urine,

137
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,640
Anna,
45 minutes.

138
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,720
Fifty Pound Kettlebell.
Yeah.

139
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,850
It's brutal.
If you can do it,

140
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,980
you are a fucking the animal.
You're,

141
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,990
you're,
you're a serious one of those freak 

142
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,110
crossfit motherfuckers that runs up 
pills all day.

143
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,400
They're,
they're in the best in the world at 

144
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,400
working out.
It's an incredible,

145
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,400
incredible.
A DVD.

146
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,800
It's in.
This guy's in like some serious shape.

147
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:11,560
The Guy who,
uh,

148
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,060
who,
what,

149
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:17,061
what the fuck is his name?
I don't remember how we used to start 

150
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:21,741
talking about my other units.
Then hopefully Kelly units around the 

151
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:21,741
podcast.
Why?

152
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:21,741
Why is that?
Because.

153
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,710
Oh,
I get it.

154
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,250
He can't sell Mila Kunis.
We can make not like that,

155
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,240
man.
I'm telling you.

156
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:32,960
She's not like that.
You don't know or you don't know.

157
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,970
Like,
I know I heard Ashton paid a pretty 

158
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:37,970
penny for her.
What?

159
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,140
That's who she's dating now.
Aston Kutcher.

160
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,350
Oh really?
Yeah.

161
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:45,960
So shower with or $2 bills and the 
dudes.

162
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,020
The dudes name is Keith Weber,
the guy who is the guy who takes you 

163
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,501
through the workout in the extreme 
kettlebell cardio workouts like 

164
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:54,501
somebody's already.
Hey,

165
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:54,501
he's bad ass.

166
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,560
You would love him.
You love him.

167
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,260
He would love you.
He probably give you a neck rub anyway,

168
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,020
dot com.
Go get yourself some protein,

169
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,120
some Alpha brain,
all of the supplements.

170
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:06,150
Use the code named Brogan and you will 
save 50 percent off.

171
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,330
What's No 10 percent off?
Jesus Christ.

172
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:11,730
Could you imagine?
What did I just say that for?

173
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,670
I was thinking of something Chris was 
trying to do.

174
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,100
I was trying to think and talk at the 
same time.

175
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,280
If you use a code name Brogan,
you save 10 percent off.

176
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,310
Okay,
and here's the other percent is if you 

177
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,680
do not like Alpha brain or shroom tech 
or are these supplements that you buy?

178
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,540
We have 100 percent money back 
guarantee.

179
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,110
No one is trying to rip you off.
The stuff that we're selling is the best

180
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:39,111
shit we can possibly sell you.
I know I say this all the time and I 

181
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:42,711
know it's annoying,
but on the hope that there's a new 

182
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:44,871
person listening to this podcast,
unfortunately we all have to go through 

183
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:45,900
the shit over and over and over again.
That's why I have a fast forward button.

184
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,450
Pitch it.
You don't have to listen to me,

185
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,940
but sometimes we'll say shit in the 
middle of these commercials and it makes

186
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:52,260
it better than just a regular 
commercial.

187
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:53,820
Okay?
Look what I.

188
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,920
Josh Barr now,
kettle bells out.

189
00:07:55,921 --> 00:08:00,921
This motherfucker is prepared.
He's Karl gotch trained bitches.

190
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,870
He knows all about strength and 
conditioning.

191
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,430
Use a code name Brogan.
Save yourself 10 percent off and by the 

192
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,430
way,
yeah,

193
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,430
no one's trying to rip you off,
blah,

194
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,430
blah,
blah.

195
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,950
Hit The music bitches.
The Joe Rogan experience

196
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,690
Joe Rogan podcast.

197
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,050
So many times we started this podcast 
off and I never say who I'm talking to 

198
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,780
him until about an hour in,
so I will just say it right up front.

199
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,180
A manly man,
a man of character,

200
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:34,181
a man's man who likes muscle cars and 
fucking psycho music and it's an 

201
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:39,211
intellectual dude,
a guy you sit down and talk to Josh 

202
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:39,211
Barnett,
lives in channel,

203
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:39,860
bring her home.
I break bread and bring,

204
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:44,861
bring me on home to introduce me to mom,
tell her about raping and pillaging and 

205
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:47,510
not necessarily,
but if you lived in another era,

206
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,870
you might be on the menu,
could be to make a good conquer.

207
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,900
If you came in on a boat and everybody 
else was doing,

208
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,840
you would go out and do your thing.
You know it.

209
00:08:55,841 --> 00:08:58,510
I will be at that and be like drunk fast
or you send them a bitch.

210
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,700
So,
uh,

211
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:01,720
what's new for you?
Man?

212
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,940
I know you're going to be in the end.
The last strikeforce card,

213
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:05,830
right?
Which is in January for folks that don't

214
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:10,831
know Josh,
Josh is a former UFC heavyweight 

215
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:11,230
champion,
a king of pancrase.

216
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,730
How many other titles did you get?

217
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,360
Uh,

218
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,850
bunch of grappling titles,

219
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,660
grapping titles.
I think I had a,

220
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,850
a smoothest penis head.

221
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,210
If we were going to have a manliest men 
board of approval,

222
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,940
I would have to have you on this 
manliest men board of approval.

223
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:33,860
You're clearly about as manly as it 
gets.

224
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:38,861
I think I appreciate it.
We can go to you and we can get like 

225
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:40,940
real strict,
like no nonsense.

226
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,610
I saw you straightened up dudes nose 
with a fucking pencil.

227
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,130
Got Video of it on the end of that dude,
guys,

228
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,010
those broken Josh like you want me to 
fix it?

229
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,710
I'll fix it right now.
Faced with a fucking pencil,

230
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,410
shoves a pencil.
This dude's nodes and breaks it back and

231
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:59,411
you see it.
You'd see the crunching and see if he 

232
00:09:59,411 --> 00:09:59,411
can find it because it's pretty fun.
It's pretty fucking funny.

233
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,270
Yeah.
Uh,

234
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,180
I'm,
I'm there for,

235
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:04,950
for that boob jobs.
Pretty much any kind of general surgery.

236
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,940
Did he break his nose sparring?
Was it like,

237
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,770
did it actually with,
uh,

238
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,550
with,
uh,

239
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,020
he was doing snatches.
Oh,

240
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,990
the barbell.
And somehow he manages to waylay himself

241
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:15,700
right in the face.
He crushed it.

242
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,930
He nailed well,
he'd already mangled it.

243
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:19,790
Pretty good.
Uh,

244
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,730
uh,
doing rugby earlier on.

245
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:22,410
And,
uh,

246
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,580
uh,
I think in college maybe something like 

247
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:28,580
that,
he'd been doing rugby for years,

248
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,450
so you'd already known the pleasures of 
a broken nose,

249
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,490
but this was just out of nowhere.
So,

250
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,450
you know,
there's an interesting debate that's 

251
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:38,450
going on right now,
uh,

252
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,321
amongst people that are football fans,
but that are also realizing how much 

253
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:47,361
damage these players take and they're 
trying to figure out what to do about 

254
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:50,511
it.
And one of the more interesting ideas 

255
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:53,421
that it's being presented is the idea to
make them wear leather helmets to take 

256
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:57,861
away these big fucking hard helmets that
allow you to crash into each other full 

257
00:10:57,861 --> 00:10:59,940
speed and just give you a little 
something that protects your skin.

258
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:03,480
And that's basically all you got.
And you can't have the same strategy can

259
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,970
go head to head like that.
You can't crash into each other,

260
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,860
no pants,
leather helmets.

261
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:10,260
And the idea is that if they,
if they rocked it down away,

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,650
we would avoid a lot of these crazy high
speed collision.

263
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,550
People would be more realistic about it.

264
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,880
I think it would cut down on the high 
speed collisions.

265
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,790
Uh,
you wouldn't,

266
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,820
you wouldn't have people blowing into 
each other near as hard.

267
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:25,821
I've had the argument with people that 
are big rugby fanatics for years that 

268
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:25,821
I'm like,
look,

269
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:27,180
rugby guys don't hit as hard as football
players.

270
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:29,140
I mean,
it's not just that they have pads on us,

271
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,510
they're huge,
they're running fast and those,

272
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,570
you know,
the pads in addition help you to just 

273
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,020
like lay everything you got into another
human being.

274
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,400
However,
I mean,

275
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:39,960
let's be honest,
look at these monsters.

276
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,130
I mean,
you stick them in leather,

277
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,110
they're still gonna start smashing into 
each other.

278
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:46,710
I don't know if it's going to stop from 
people getting as hurt as bad or

279
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,790
right.
But the problem is like the sports 

280
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,890
already developed into what it is and to
try to take it a step back.

281
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:58,330
Things don't usually go a step back.
Do you want to watch guys in leather 

282
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,330
helmet?
No.

283
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,200
Like patty cake and grab each other's 
balls and there's a video that's being 

284
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,200
played above your head.

285
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,950
Oh yeah.
Two bends in the states.

286
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,160
No,
it's just so gnarly.

287
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,630
But this is some known.
Don said,

288
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,340
Shit,
look,

289
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:15,341
he just opens a pathway.
I'd like to say that I was just looking 

290
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:16,030
to see whatever I could find a Jamun 
pianist,

291
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,180
his Schnoz anyways,
just for the hell of it,

292
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,350
but it actually makes sense.
Oh yeah,

293
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,620
it totally makes sense.
If you can get it to heal in the correct

294
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:29,621
position,
it won't be nearly as fucked up as if 

295
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:30,020
the cartilage is all bent up in there to
get mine fixed.

296
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,080
I broke it when I was a little kid.
I fell down a flight of stairs my whole 

297
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,291
life.
It was fucking nights were really the 

298
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:38,291
only way to really do it if you have a 
bad enough break,

299
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:38,510
is to,
uh,

300
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,860
to have like a,
an ear,

301
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:42,740
nose and throat doctor go in there and 
do the proper stuff to it.

302
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,750
But it's,
it's a hellacious coming back from it.

303
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,340
I didn't think it was.
No.

304
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:46,880
Well,
I've heard,

305
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:50,150
I've heard of people like crying blood 
out of their eyes and that's pretty cool

306
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,280
and a metal sense.
Save the buggers.

307
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,650
I'll show you some passive one.
Oh my God.

308
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:57,380
Let me show you something because you 
can't even believe these are real.

309
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,070
I,
uh,

310
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,280
I showed one of my buddy Tom,
me and Tommy,

311
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,160
we were,
we were,

312
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:08,161
uh,
at the airport and I blew this fucking 

313
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,040
booger into this tissue.
It did not look real.

314
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,720
It looked like it came from another 
planet.

315
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,830
Blood clot fucking insane.
It was huge.

316
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:16,120
First of all.
I mean,

317
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:16,470
I,
I've,

318
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,400
I've got the photos,
I've saved them.

319
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:19,690
I mean,
there was no way I was ever going to let

320
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:21,520
this go.
It's just going to take a few.

321
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:26,521
Um,
I have a lot of God damn pictures in 

322
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:26,521
here.
I've got to go back to when it was,

323
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:27,110
which I think was about three years ago.
Oh,

324
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,520
that was,
it changed.

325
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,870
Oh,
that's my picture.

326
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:36,550
When I was back in the day,
I'd hit it.

327
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,200
I would do,
I would hit it.

328
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:40,480
And it's me trying to find these 
buggers.

329
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:44,250
Ma'Am.
Something literally here couldn't.

330
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,980
You couldn't imagine this coming out of 
a human being.

331
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,110
I've put this online,
I'm sure.

332
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,130
No,
I definitely did.

333
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,660
I put it on my twitter page.
So Brian,

334
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,560
if you could find it,
uh,

335
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,080
Joe Rogan's bloody snot on twitter.
I bet there's a photo of it up there.

336
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:04,710
As long as it stays up there.
I'm imagining some comic book villain of

337
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:06,880
a booger.
It's just unbelievable.

338
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,860
I mean,
I wouldn't be talking it up this much if

339
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,390
it wasn't really unbelievable.
But for ladies and gentlemen,

340
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,320
if you have a broken nose,
if you get the inside of the nose fucked

341
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:14,800
up,
if you,

342
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,370
if you know,
like,

343
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,850
I know like mayhem had thought about 
getting his fix but he's still fighting.

344
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,590
So it's like I can't do it until I'm 
done.

345
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:23,320
But if you get a chance,
that's the only one.

346
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,580
That's what it looks like.
A,

347
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,930
like cartilage and everybody's like,
just pieces is unbelievable.

348
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,860
And that was the only one that's not 
even the biggest one.

349
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,420
I had some other ones that were even 
bigger.

350
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:36,421
They were so ridiculous.
I blew them out and I looked at him in 

351
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:36,421
my hand.
I'm like,

352
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:39,481
you gotta be fucking kidding.
How'd you feel if that thing came out 

353
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:39,481
like a,
like a potato chip came out of my,

354
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,370
uh,
blood giant bloody Nacho.

355
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,170
That's what it was like.
Yeah.

356
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,420
There's a look at the size of that 
fucking thing.

357
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,180
That thing came out of my note.
What did it tastes like?

358
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,240
Calgon take it wasn't good.
It something I would recommend you try 

359
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,240
and um,
it was,

360
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,490
it was unbelievable.
I would,

361
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:58,080
I would shoot those out of my nose.
I'm like,

362
00:14:58,081 --> 00:14:59,180
it leaves out here.
Here I was,

363
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,740
I got a bunch of pictures I really need 
to,

364
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,630
to get my nose fixed.
I broke it a long time ago,

365
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,960
kid.
And then I broke it again.

366
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:10,390
Really a in this first round of that 
super ball tournament and it just,

367
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:11,510
it bleeds easy now,

368
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,770
which is a problem.
So that they,

369
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,990
what do they do?
They cauterize the inside.

370
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,960
They've tried doing that.
But the way to get up,

371
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,200
I need a doc to get.
That's impressive.

372
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,460
That's unbelievable,
right?

373
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:25,830
I blew 100 of those three or four 
months.

374
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:27,300
I hope you have that framed in your 
house.

375
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,880
I should,
I should just stay in my office or at 

376
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,720
least put it in one of those led,
rotating picture frames.

377
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,860
The dog,
the kid.

378
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,710
Fuck.
That's a great idea,

379
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,330
dude.
I might do that.

380
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,820
I'll do that and put one up in here.
That's what we'll do for the,

381
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,910
for the studio.
Um,

382
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,810
so,
uh,

383
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:51,040
you're on the last strike force card.
Yes.

384
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,060
Is it January

385
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,730
twelfth in the wonderful Oklahoma City?
Uh,

386
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,780
we'll be down there a beating the crap 
out of each other for the last time 

387
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:00,780
under the strikeforce banner.
But uh,

388
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,120
it'll be on showtime as usual so people 
will be able to see it.

389
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,410
What did you say,
Tim Kennedy's pissed off.

390
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:10,100
He thinks that he was mad a little bit,
you know,

391
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,850
those,
uh,

392
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,780
those,
uh,

393
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,740
high level military dudes,
they tend to be a little high strung on 

394
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:17,740
edge.
Yeah.

395
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,720
But he was talking about how he thinks 
of all these guys are pulling out 

396
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,510
because it's the last card they just 
don't want to fuck because it won't mean

397
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:28,511
enough to them.
They want to just try to get fights in 

398
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:30,311
the UFC.
So they're just pulling out of the last 

399
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:32,370
strikeforce.
I think that was what he was 

400
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:32,370
insinuating.
He was definitely saying that

401
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,890
beyond the realm of possibility for me,
I look at it and people love to complain

402
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,150
about,
oh well you don't,

403
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:39,420
you don't,
you're not fighting this guy.

404
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,320
You're not fighting.
We're not fighting that fight.

405
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,430
I fight the people that they put in 
front of me and,

406
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,840
and you know,
they're like,

407
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:45,530
well,
who the hell is this?

408
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,460
And slash or guy.
I'm like,

409
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:48,200
I don't fucking know and I don't fucking
care.

410
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,260
You know what I mean?
He's just another fucking victim that.

411
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,100
And no matter what,
if it was Nan door or junior dos Santos,

412
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,460
I get paid the same right now.
So I really don't give a shit.

413
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,040
I,
I fight who steps up and uh,

414
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,430
you know,
that's just the way that you're 

415
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,430
fighting.
He is impressive looking.

416
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,260
I'll give him that.
He does look like he's a man door,

417
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,560
Gill Amino Guild Amino.
That doesn't sound Australian to me,

418
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:13,190
but whatever.

419
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,220
Is that where you're supposedly from?
That's where he's from.

420
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,120
He's called the Hun.
So I plan.

421
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,580
I can dig that.
The hunt fights for master.

422
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,020
That's pretty intense shit.
Yeah,

423
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:24,410
that sounds a like a like some sort of 
fantasy movie.

424
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,440
He's,
it looks like a big giant end of the 

425
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,440
world type dude.
He does.

426
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,530
He's got a nice big thick brow over his 
eyes.

427
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Well his tactics may strikes fucking 
gigantic and it looks like actually 

428
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,180
building.
Well they shot it up,

429
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,530
you know,
tricks of camera.

430
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,430
He's like six,
two,

431
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,380
two,
2130.

432
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,780
So he's a pretty decent sized,
smaller size of the heavy I think.

433
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:48,260
Just think he likes to do a lot of 
curls.

434
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,030
Okay.
And he's probably got the tiny legs.

435
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Oh,
it's one of those dudes and he's 

436
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,460
fighting in the UFC.
How's that possible?

437
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Well,
maybe it's just a,

438
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,350
I don't know,
man,

439
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,660
but he's a,
he's got some fights under his belt.

440
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,010
He's not,
he's not like,

441
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:03,200
he's never been there before.
And he's 36.

442
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:05,170
He's,
he's gonna come in fit and I.

443
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,210
and he thinks this is his opportunity to
fuck somebody up and you think it's 

444
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:10,340
going to be me.
So yeah,

445
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,740
it looks so that's a big step up for 
that dude.

446
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:13,280
And you know

447
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,220
that happens man,
a lot in mma where guys that someone was

448
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,900
talking about Danny Lozan,
Joe Lowe's,

449
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,110
his brother first fight in UFC fight,
Spencer Fisher,

450
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,240
that's pretty big.
That happens.

451
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,130
That kind of shit happens.
This guy.

452
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:31,131
That's a giant opportunity for him.
But really he should like if you looked 

453
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,920
at it like in the world of outside of 
MMA,

454
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:39,921
if it was like a boxing thing,
that guy would have to go through a lot 

455
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,040
more hoops and ladders before he gets to
a Josh Barnett level.

456
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,210
That's true.
And then the thing with boxing also is 

457
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,641
that they,
they put their cars together based on 

458
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:51,281
how they can promote it for the back end
dollar or two specific to the bouts 

459
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:52,640
themselves were with him May.
It's just like,

460
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:55,340
Hey,
we have a card or on it.

461
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,390
Let's just have him fight.

462
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,910
Yeah.
Because a guy like this,

463
00:18:57,911 --> 00:19:00,970
I mean obviously he's got,
he's got a few fights under his belt,

464
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:03,220
but you know,
you're a former champion,

465
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:04,930
you're a big name,
both in pride,

466
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:07,150
big name in strikeforce,
big name in the UFC.

467
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,860
Like that doesn't make any sense.
Like this is a guy that uh,

468
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,600
if you were banking,
you know,

469
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,300
if you see,
like if it was like Bob Arum,

470
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,600
something like this,
they will probably never scheduled like 

471
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:21,600
this.
They go,

472
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:21,600
wait a minute,
we can make a lot of money.

473
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,710
I've charged Barnett.
We got to move them into a good position

474
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,630
to get them a big name fight.
There's very few big name guys,

475
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,590
especially outside of the UFC that at 
this point there's only a few and you're

476
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:30,850
one of them,
you know,

477
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,790
and outside of you,
there's really not that many anymore,

478
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,500
you know,
now who else is left?

479
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,610
Just me now.
Cormier and a

480
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,730
and a fader is done.
He,

481
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,090
he says he,
he was,

482
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,650
he was going to retire.
He was,

483
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,700
he was thinking about it apparently at 
one point in time.

484
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,240
Then he had a loss and his family.
And uh,

485
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,530
yeah,
I think he's a,

486
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,980
I believe he's retired.
I don't really see him coming back.

487
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,930
If he does,
it won't be for some time.

488
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:58,550
I just don't think that fighting is so 
absolutely necessary to him.

489
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,040
I think he's,
he may be looking at different stages in

490
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,760
his life and I think from,
from how I know him anyways,

491
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:09,761
he seems pretty content with the things 
that he's doing outside of fighting and 

492
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:12,320
happy with family and church and things 
like that.

493
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,670
Yeah,
he definitely doesn't have the same last

494
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:19,360
for it that he had.
Like when he fought cro cop,

495
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,580
like back in those days I,
I considered that like his prime,

496
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,110
like the one of the first cro cop fight 
I think.

497
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:27,110
Uh,
he just,

498
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,790
he,
he went after him on the feet,

499
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:32,060
like he basically walked down like one 
of the best kick boxers and mma.

500
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,590
Well that's the thing,
when you're fighting a good striker,

501
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:35,740
you,
you got a and,

502
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,570
and that fueled or wanted to.
Needed to put him on his back.

503
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,320
So he had to close that distance.
And the only way you can't just walk 

504
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,320
into them,
you're going to get tagged up,

505
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,070
meaning he got cracked with a lot of 
good shots.

506
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:52,250
He had yet to be aggressive.
You have to be quick coming forward and 

507
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:52,500
then initiate those opportunities to put
them on his back.

508
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,880
You know,
every time I fought cro cop,

509
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:55,270
I came forward to.
Because again,

510
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,660
if I,
if I want to put them on the floor,

511
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,990
I can't do it backing up.
And everybody that backs up the more 

512
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:02,990
distance you give a guy like cro cop,
especially back then,

513
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,330
the more he would look for is 
opportunity to land kill shot,

514
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,010
then fucking left high kick or just a 
middle kick or you know,

515
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,610
he was a hellacious low kicker too.

516
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,980
But uh,
uh,

517
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,100
he uh,
filter look great in his last couple of 

518
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,100
bouts.
Looked real sharp,

519
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,390
but I think it was more just to prove to
himself that he could do it.

520
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:18,820
That,
you know,

521
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,840
all right,
well I have the ability and I can stay 

522
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,670
in here and be a top guy.
But I've done this and I'm good.

523
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:29,430
And I guess his brother just recently 
retired also,

524
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,940
and then uh,
um,

525
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,180
uh,
Tim Silvia is still out there and 

526
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,180
around,
I don't know,

527
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,190
I mean he's got a pedigree and he has 
still a pretty high high record of wins 

528
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,571
versus losses and Arlovski is trying to 
make a run back into the limelight as 

529
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,900
far as being a top everywhere.

530
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,660
Well,
I lost.

531
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,070
He's actually doing really well.
He's uh,

532
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,700
he,
uh,

533
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,510
he actually just beat Tim Wright.
He beat Tim and then he was disqualified

534
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:55,130
because of an illegal soccer kick.
Yeah.

535
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:56,730
I have a weird rule.
It's a one.

536
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,680
Is that one FC?
Is that Matt?

537
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,220
Uh,
Matt Hume's old,

538
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:05,370
a pancreas pro pankration rules in 
Washington and they had this open guard 

539
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,440
a call things.
So it was like the,

540
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,450
I guess the deal was you,
you're not supposed to spend a long 

541
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:13,450
time.
So I fought and washing.

542
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,030
Well,
let me explain it to people that don't 

543
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,030
know what we're talking about for most 
fights,

544
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,980
you can't kick a guy in the head when 
he's down.

545
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:24,840
You can only kick the body and the legs.
But in pride and the old school days,

546
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:27,000
you could do anything.
You could stomp guys,

547
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:28,140
you could soccer,
kick them,

548
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:31,170
you could do anything.
And a lot of people miss that technique.

549
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:36,210
So there's open guard thing is where 
they allow the kicks stops as well.

550
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,270
Uh,

551
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,440
maybe no stomps.
Maybe just kicks.

552
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,130
I believe it just kicks A.
I'd have to pencil long,

553
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,730
but uh,
um,

554
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,810
but once they call open guard,
then you're free to do,

555
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,430
you know,
I,

556
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:53,431
I believe it was taken from Valley Tudo 
Japan or something similar way back in 

557
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:54,860
the day,
but it was like if you're on your back,

558
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,800
guy can go ahead and come around.
And soccer kick at your head.

559
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,030
Is the idea that if you've rocked and 
you're down,

560
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,550
is that when he would not,
when would he not let you?

561
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,950
Soccer of all fours I believe.
Okay.

562
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,370
So if you scratch like,
you've,

563
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,410
you're down,
you're hurt,

564
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,010
then you can't soccer kick guy.
Look,

565
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,890
then he would stop.
But if he went to his back,

566
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,300
that would be open guard and you can 
talk.

567
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,230
Okay.
That's interesting.

568
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:19,231
So only when the guy's on his back,
because I guess the idea is that your 

569
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:19,231
legs and your hands are up in front of 
you,

570
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,290
so you're protecting yourself.
That totally.

571
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,440
That actually is very logical.
The Japanese had a lot of very logical,

572
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:26,200
uh,
approaches to mma.

573
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:28,810
One of them that I really liked was that
10 minute first round.

574
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,360
Yes.
That's a brutal fight.

575
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,290
That really separated the men from the 
boys.

576
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,280
Did that round was the endurance 
breaker.

577
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I liked it.
I loved that you go out there and you 

578
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,400
just get it on some.
Yeah.

579
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,870
You,
you have to strategize your wind and 

580
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,870
your endurance.
Uh,

581
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,870
but it,
I mean,

582
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,700
we didn't stop a lot of us from still 
just going nonstop,

583
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,480
10 minutes,
man.

584
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:48,910
We'd just go for it.
And uh,

585
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,380
uh,
coming from a guy like me who started in

586
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:53,300
the days of no time limits,
I mean,

587
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:53,870
right.

588
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,930
And well,
you know,

589
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,960
for a guy like you also,
it's sometimes you would work for a 

590
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,540
while to get a takedown and you finally 
get to take down.

591
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,890
You only got 20 seconds left than 
around.

592
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,900
The guy can defend.
But if there's five minutes and 20 

593
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,101
seconds,
he's fucked right now and get a lot of 

594
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:10,170
work in on a guy and five slash 12 that 
really favor.

595
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:15,171
I mean that was one of the main 
arguments for not having three minute 

596
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:17,961
rounds in the first place is that you 
wanted to give the grappler sometime to 

597
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:17,961
work once he completed the tank down.
Right.

598
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:20,820
But if you look at like,
like consider the exertion that they put

599
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:23,910
off in a boxing rounds,
boxing the high level of boxing runs,

600
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,920
it's really not even nearly as 
devastating as a high level MMA right 

601
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:28,920
now.

602
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,390
It's different because you don't have 
that muscle fatigue from constant wear 

603
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,250
and and resistance and it's a different 
sort of conditioning.

604
00:24:35,251 --> 00:24:38,660
Or you can take a guy who's an excellent
wrestler who's got fantastic when,

605
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:41,190
when it comes to to contact and,
and,

606
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:45,190
and resistance and strength and balance 
that way against another opponent.

607
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:50,191
But you get out there and you start 
putting all these punches together and 

608
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:51,340
all of a sudden his wind is gone,
got blasted because it's a different.

609
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:55,930
It's more akin to more of an aerobic.
Anaerobic just wind based,

610
00:24:55,931 --> 00:24:57,970
then it's a different.
It's completely different.

611
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,090
Yeah.
It's interesting how it doesn't apply,

612
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,430
like fitness does not apply across the 
board.

613
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:02,870
No,
no,

614
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:07,871
no.
And that's the thing is that the 

615
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:07,871
Olympic,

616
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:10,500
uh,
the Olympic committees have done all 

617
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:10,500
these,
uh,

618
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:10,500
these studies like committees,
whatever,

619
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:10,810
the,
uh,

620
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,880
all the people that come with all the 
science and the training behind these 

621
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
Olympic athletes and that is,
you can do sports specific training.

622
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:20,250
You can go ahead and shoot doubles with 
bands on,

623
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:25,251
you can punch with dumbbells,
you can do all this stuff to try and 

624
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:26,070
simulate doing your sport,
but in the end,

625
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:29,760
the only thing that makes you better at 
your sport and the most,

626
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,850
especially in terms of endurance and 
everything else is to actually do your 

627
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,841
sport.
But because your body learns how to 

628
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:38,841
relax,
it has muscle memory.

629
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:40,010
It has a um,
um,

630
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,480
your,
your brain understands all the movements

631
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,860
and dynamics of exactly what you're 
doing and that's how it learns to be as 

632
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,920
most efficient as possible in your 
sport.

633
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,180
Yeah.
And so it's great.

634
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,180
You know,
all these strength conditioning guys 

635
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,180
have come out of the woodwork,
especially I love all the guys that have

636
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,321
no fight training or fights under their 
belt and they want to go and they train 

637
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:04,071
all these fighters with all this stuff.
They see a Jim Jones or crossfit or a 

638
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:08,480
now westside barbell and these are all 
great systems that have amazing things 

639
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:11,640
to take from it,
but I could have the best workout in the

640
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:14,040
world,
but it might not be the best workout for

641
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:19,130
this particular type of athlete and not 
to mention he can do the best work out 

642
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,881
in the world all day long.
If his time in the sport that he's 

643
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,380
actually doing is not being applied,
then it's a waste.

644
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:30,381
You're not,
you're not going to really be able to 

645
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:30,381
make the most of it.

646
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:31,960
You feel like there's a certain level of
the game were strengthened.

647
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:36,961
Condition is absolutely necessary.
We can get to like a rory macdonald 

648
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:37,330
athlete level,
like absolutely.

649
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,850
You know,
I mean this kid at 23,

650
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,200
24,
something like that.

651
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:43,150
He's young,
he's a freakish and,

652
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,180
and he's so fucking athletic and he's 
doing these incredible strength and 

653
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,210
conditioning workouts along with all his
sports specific shit.

654
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,540
It's,
I feel like I absolutely agree with you 

655
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,961
that the most important thing is 
technique and efficiency and training 

656
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,640
and sparring and timing and Mitt work 
and all that good stuff.

657
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,940
But there's also,
you get to a Roy Mcdonald level where 

658
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,640
he's got Roy Mcdonald.
He has that as well.

659
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,690
You know,
he's got all the training all the time,

660
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:18,390
putting in,
in all the intensity and the drills.

661
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,460
But then he also has this

662
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,560
and that's,
that was I actually,

663
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:23,170
I,
uh,

664
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,700
uh,
unofficially named that laugh that UFC 

665
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,460
on Fox a card I called the UFC on Fox 
five speed kills.

666
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Basically everybody who is faster,
more conditioned and quicker beat their 

667
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,050
opponents.
Well really what it came down to,

668
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,800
you know,
a Benson,

669
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,100
a Rory Gustafson,
all of them were quicker.

670
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:42,660
They were quicker to the punch,
they were better.

671
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,140
They seem to be better condition.
They,

672
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:46,860
they pushed the pace higher and they 
beat all their opponents.

673
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,980
I mean,
they had great skillsets and great game 

674
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:51,980
plans,
but they moved so much,

675
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,680
so much and had so much more speed over 
their opponents that they just couldn't 

676
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,240
keep up.
And uh,

677
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,760
um,
the athleticism,

678
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,100
strength conditioning,
that's a huge equalizer,

679
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:04,470
called God's Lord say technique within 
strength.

680
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,500
If you're not strong enough and physical
enough to pull off a ship and you're 

681
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:09,500
trying to do,
then it ain't gonna work,

682
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:09,990
you know?
And

683
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,290
that's such an important point because 
that's sort of denied in the Jiu Jitsu 

684
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:15,510
community a little bit.
You know,

685
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,340
there's a lot of people say I'm wearing 
it,

686
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,840
by the way,
this is no disrespect.

687
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:22,500
And I got to Leo Gracie tee shirt on 
right now when I'm saying this and work

688
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,500
requires a lot of strength and I've 
trained with all the,

689
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,380
with a lot of top,
high level Jujitsu guys are legends like

690
00:28:29,381 --> 00:28:31,110
Henzel Gracie.
I've rolled with these dudes.

691
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:36,410
And even as a kid I remember hearing all
the rhetoric about Jujitsu and the 

692
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,490
gentle way and all this and you know,
no energy and effortless.

693
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:41,190
And I'm like,
fuck that.

694
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,580
These dudes are strong as shit.
They do everything with a huge amount of

695
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:48,840
strength.
They have a lot of technique,

696
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,870
but the difference like the difference 
between like this Hen i Henzel and this 

697
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,800
is back in Abu Dhabi and this other 
fucking,

698
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,910
you know,
black belt champion Schmo from Brazil is

699
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:02,690
that black belt Schmo from Brazil does 
the same move.

700
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:07,691
The hanzo does,
but it handles like fucking three times 

701
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:07,691
as strong as that dude.
Right?

702
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:09,910
And he's going after it wrestling style 
as well.

703
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:14,911
He's like snapping your head down and 
clamping down on a guillotine and 

704
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:18,720
yanking on it and put this mist on you 
and you're trying to get your hand away 

705
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,871
and you can't.
I tell them I'm a lifelong of grappling 

706
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:22,150
strength today.
No question.

707
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,160
Perfect technique,
no question,

708
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,830
but absolutely strong given,
given a,

709
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,160
an uneven playing field are given,
even techniques,

710
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:32,170
you know,
even on the technique side of the person

711
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,180
who is stronger and faster is going to 
apply it better.

712
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,680
Yeah.
You know,

713
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:37,160
I always had this theory about Hickson 
and uh,

714
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,080
one of the theories about Hixon that I 
always say,

715
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:44,270
if people know Hixon Gracie,
it was always considered to be the 

716
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,330
greatest of the Gracie clan,
just like a magician on them.

717
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,910
Yeah.
But also like weight way more built.

718
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,100
I mean if you compare him to like,
well he is raising a physical specimen,

719
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,200
especially when he was young.
I mean he was just like a perfect 

720
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,200
athlete,
but if you,

721
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,581
if you think about him when those days 
he got more taps in because he was 

722
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:04,510
stronger and he was like physically he 
was a freak.

723
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,410
Like he was a great Yogi.
He's like a,

724
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,810
like a really an avid yoga practitioner 
that belly flexibility,

725
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,310
strength and body control.
Mind watching them go at it with people

726
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,210
go hard fast.
Those clips from those Samo tournaments,

727
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,800
he just sign onto people's limbs.
I mean,

728
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,620
there ain't nothing like smooth 
whatever,

729
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:27,450
like just chilling out and catching an 
oh my friend y'all.

730
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:27,950
How are y'all?

731
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,690
No,
the guy's like,

732
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,350
oh,
he's like a,

733
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,680
he's like a fucking blast beat,
you know,

734
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,730
from a death metal song.
Just chewing through somebody's body.

735
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,880
I love that a guy like that exists.
I love that there's a guy that is the 

736
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,630
one guy that stands above everyone else.

737
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:47,520
You know what I've always heard,
not to create rumors and not to say that

738
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:50,820
any of the people a fore mentioned ever 
said as such either because,

739
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:51,870
uh,
you know,

740
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,280
they've never with this guy,
wouldn't you never ever,

741
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:58,980
ever,
ever talk shit or,

742
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,780
or try to like,
you know,

743
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:01,750
run around and,
and,

744
00:31:01,751 --> 00:31:02,370
and,
you know,

745
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:04,200
behind the scenes I'd be like,
oh,

746
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:09,201
but really he's not that kind of guy,
but I've always heard that from people 

747
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:13,890
that have trained with both of them,
that Laborio is considered even better.

748
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:19,020
You know what?
That's a very funny thing that you said 

749
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,881
that I was going to say Laborio is the 
other guy that has that sort of Laborio 

750
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,330
is like the most approachable,
friendliest,

751
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:23,080
sweetest guy.

752
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,060
She'll do it.
And laboriel even say about,

753
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,650
he'll talk about his competition.
He goes,

754
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:32,651
you know,
I just wasn't able to do as much in 

755
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:34,980
competition as I had wanted to or as I 
was capable of on the mats.

756
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,720
I mean,
he's not,

757
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,150
he's a humble,
straightforward,

758
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,240
no nonsense,
just a,

759
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:45,310
he's not a,
he's not going to bullshit about any of 

760
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,411
it.
He's not going to sit back and start 

761
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:47,411
naming off all these excuses or 
whatever.

762
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:47,411
He goes,
ah,

763
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:47,411
you know,
that day I just,

764
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,530
you know,
I wasn't able to.

765
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,520
I know,
I'm like,

766
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,770
I should have taken that guy out and 
like a minute.

767
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:56,771
But uh,
for whatever reason that it just didn't 

768
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:56,810
work out,
maybe my head or this or whatever.

769
00:31:56,811 --> 00:31:57,300
I mean,
he does.

770
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,560
He's not a,
he's not a,

771
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,660
some cocky sort of dude trying to make,
give himself an out to why he didn't 

772
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,280
perform as what he wanted.

773
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:09,310
But that's one of the reasons why I 
liked that guy so much because I know 

774
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,280
how good he is.
I even watching them back in the day and

775
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:11,120
I'd tell him,
Oh man,

776
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:12,200
that was a really good match.
I mean,

777
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:13,250
he was like,
yeah,

778
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:13,970
you know,
it was cool.

779
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:15,110
It was all right.
But uh,

780
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,920
but you know,
I'd heard from all from these other 

781
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Jujitsu guys,
like,

782
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,701
man laborio actually,
that's the dude and people don't talk 

783
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:26,891
about it,
but that's the guy that they think is 

784
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:26,910
Charles.
Charles Mccarthy was the first person to

785
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,540
told me that,
but chainsaw.

786
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:28,770
Yeah,

787
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,480
he,
uh,

788
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,510
he told me a long time ago and then I 
started asking around,

789
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:34,220
you know,
I was only like a blue belt purple belt,

790
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,170
but I didn't really know who the great 
guys were.

791
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:41,171
But he said the other guy that was like 
that with him that people don't give 

792
00:32:41,171 --> 00:32:41,171
enough credit to,
he said was travis Luder.

793
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,340
He said,
Travis Luder is a lot better than people

794
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,300
gave him credit for.
He's like,

795
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:47,630
he never really got his shit together 
like conditioning wise and had a few.

796
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,890
Travis is tough.
We all knew that.

797
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:52,560
He was a pretty,
pretty talented when it came to,

798
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:53,410
uh,
to,

799
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,470
to his grappling skills on the mat.
I mean,

800
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:57,420
he very underrated.
He was Terry,

801
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,390
let's be honest.
He put Anderson on his back and did what

802
00:33:00,391 --> 00:33:01,240
he wanted.
He just moved.

803
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:01,290
Yeah.

804
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,810
Let me tell you something.
The day before travis looked like a dead

805
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:06,680
man.
I mean,

806
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:10,280
I've.
I've never seen a guy in all my years of

807
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,830
being at the weigh ins and that's over 
12 years now.

808
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,420
More than that,
if you count the nineties,

809
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:20,020
he was dead dude.
He shuffled to the scale for his second 

810
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,431
attempt,
like literally couldn't lift his feet 

811
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:24,431
up.
The chores were married up there.

812
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:25,220
Huh?
Looked horrible.

813
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:30,221
I've never seen a guy who his lips were 
cracked and dried out like he had sucked

814
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,830
himself dry like a sponge.
He was still more than a pound over.

815
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,540
He couldn't make it.
He couldn't make the way.

816
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:37,490
I don't remember what the final thing 
was,

817
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:40,030
but he just fits right.
Whatever happened,

818
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:45,040
it wasn't fucked up.
He wasn't a title fight and he was 

819
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,740
dominating him,
but he ran out of juice.

820
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,780
I'm sure most of it was due to even 
because he pooped out in mountain was 

821
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,320
physical exertion and his muscles just.
They didn't have enough energy to power 

822
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:56,520
them.
They didn't have any electrolytes.

823
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,630
You didn't have a mineral is needed to 
keep those things going and they just,

824
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,530
they just gave up.

825
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:05,550
That one drives me crazy.
There's a lot of guys that I've seen 

826
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:05,550
fall apart.

827
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,690
Honestly.
It hadn't been so exhausted and you 

828
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:09,690
know,
that's,

829
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,500
that's up to look at saluter,
you know what I mean?

830
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:12,620
And his coaches.
But yeah,

831
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,920
I think he probably would have tapped 
into

832
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:19,860
luder luder in top form in that fight.
Alluded that was not sick.

833
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:22,290
Would it get in the Anderson Silva a lot
of problems.

834
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,540
I mean Anderson is a lot better on the 
ground and people think,

835
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,160
yes,
he's very wily.

836
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Luder is so his more similar to like a 
another guy that people don't 

837
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,271
understand,
like a Picasso who tapped Anderson from 

838
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:35,271
amount,
amount of triangle,

839
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,560
the uh,
I think it ended up being mounted,

840
00:34:37,561 --> 00:34:40,320
but I started off on the back,
but a part of the reason why he,

841
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:42,170
I believe he tap Anderson and,
and,

842
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:47,220
and you can see that backstage footage 
from pride and Anderson is so upset 

843
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,220
about it,
I think.

844
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,640
And I know in my opinion why he's so 
upset that he lost,

845
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:55,910
wasn't he?
Because he can't believe he got caught 

846
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:55,980
like that is because what he didn't 
understand is to.

847
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:58,830
Casa is one of those dudes that has 
freak strength,

848
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,340
like unreal crazy,
like his arm feels like a pile of steel 

849
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,840
strength when he gets a hold of you.
And I rolled with the dude and the guy.

850
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,920
I'm like,
Holy Shit,

851
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:09,840
I can't believe how strong this guy.
And I remember when Vernon,

852
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,280
Vernon,
White Russell.

853
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:12,510
Then back in Abu Dhabi,
it's like,

854
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:17,511
man,
that guy's a fricken stronger and you 

855
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:17,511
think he is.
Then we're dudes like that,

856
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:17,511
right?
Yeah.

857
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:18,600
He's just crazy.
Fricking strong.

858
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:20,870
And so I'm guessing Anderson,
you know,

859
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,810
ended up on the ground,
he's like,

860
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,560
cool,
whatever.

861
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:24,660
And all of a sudden it's like,
holy fuck,

862
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:29,661
I can't get away shit.
And I think luder probably has some of 

863
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,190
that similar quality of being a lot 
stronger than people really understand.

864
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,480
I always liked travis from the get 
because he was.

865
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,180
He came from the,
from the Jujitsu background,

866
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,810
but everyone's like,
he's a,

867
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,060
he likes lego blocks exit and he trained
at the lines and dudes and always been a

868
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:43,860
nice humble dude.
I've always dug travis,

869
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,410
speaking of leg locks for,
for folks who don't know,

870
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:51,411
for the longest time Jujitsu guys didn't
go for leg locks because they thought 

871
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:56,130
that leg locks were who were cheating a 
weak way to tap a guy.

872
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,750
And one of the,
I don't know what,

873
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,840
what,
what put that in their heads because 

874
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:02,840
it's like a train.

875
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,690
Maybe you know why it's like,
let's just be honest,

876
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:05,730
they said that because they didn't train
it.

877
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,040
Um,
most of the training that was coming 

878
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,550
down throughout the rest of the Jujitsu 
tree was not including leg lots.

879
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,940
A lake lots are not really given a lot 
of precedent even if they were illegal.

880
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,080
So they just ignored what made you 
choose to do good in the first place was

881
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:19,830
adapting.

882
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,010
Sure.
And they just,

883
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,660
they,
because they weren't good at that.

884
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:25,510
Instead of accepting it and being like,
okay,

885
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,060
this is a weakness,
they just threw a fit about it,

886
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,200
wasn't it?
Also because dudes are getting fucked 

887
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,200
up,
especially like heel hooks maybe,

888
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,640
I don't know.
I mean,

889
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,680
you don't have much time to tap how many
times,

890
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:37,390
especially people get their arms busted 
off.

891
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,470
It's true,
but he'll hook seem to be even more 

892
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,881
devastating.
It seems to me that you can snap your 

893
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:46,600
arm back and get it repaired better than
you can fuck your knee sideways

894
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,640
potentially.
I think maybe the difference between,

895
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,070
uh,
the uh,

896
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,570
vertical like type of a break versus 
that twisting.

897
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:00,370
Like if you had an arm and you twisted 
it and smashed and tore up all the 

898
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:00,370
tendons instead of just going one 
direction.

899
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,980
Maybe that's part of the problem.
But also,

900
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,430
uh,
I think there's a bit of a disconnect 

901
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:07,430
for people between their legs and their 
arms.

902
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:07,430
Like they don't,
they,

903
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,380
they are more aware of their arm 
position and how bad something is or 

904
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,711
isn't versus their legs.
And then I'm sure some of that comes to 

905
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:18,981
the lack of training.
Eric won a Pan Am games that blue belt 

906
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:20,670
and blue belt,
purple something back in the day,

907
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,290
way back in the day back when,
you know,

908
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,090
he probably road there in a horse and 
carriage.

909
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:29,540
And uh,
he tapped a bunch of people with leg 

910
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,030
locks and the whole crowd booed him.
Isn't that crazy?

911
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Ooh,
why I'm bringing this up is that it 

912
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,020
changed somewhere along the line they 
had to give up and they all go after leg

913
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,130
locks.
I mean,

914
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:41,110
it's the most,
it's most hypocritical.

915
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:43,350
Juarez is excellent.
He's the best.

916
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,710
He's just one of the scariest guys when 
it comes to leg locks because he's a 

917
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,350
fucking ridiculously strong dude and 
he's got good technique.

918
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:55,351
So if he wraps a hold of that thing,
like you're in a fucking terrible 

919
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:55,351
situation.

920
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:55,420
Yeah.
He's like a,

921
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,030
he's like a,
a,

922
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,060
like a Solomon Grundy of it may just 
getting in there and just trying to 

923
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,060
figure leg off.

924
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,710
And.
And your,

925
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,140
your best friend Hector Lombard went out
it.

926
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,520
Oh yeah.
Actually,

927
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,530
you know who's not bad at leg locks.
Hector Hector's very good at language 

928
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:12,980
factors.
Good at actually hector's pretty good at

929
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:17,981
everything.
He will only choose to use a piece of 

930
00:38:17,981 --> 00:38:20,981
his arsenal for the most part.
I think that's more of a mental thing 

931
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:23,681
than anything else.
But hector actually has a ton of tools 

932
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:23,681
at his disposal.

933
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,840
Yeah,
we're very underrated ground game.

934
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,600
If you watch that leg lock,
there's a video of him competing,

935
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:33,601
uh,
one of the Nogi grappling tournaments 

936
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:35,050
and he slaps a straight ankle lock in 
this guy and breaks his leg and you hear

937
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,220
crack,
you know,

938
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:38,080
and like you see that torque that he's 
put in with that

939
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,710
fireplug man,
we were talking about muscle ups.

940
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,260
How do you do muscle?
And Hector come eight man wasn't muscle 

941
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,260
up man.
I'm like,

942
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,700
well what you do did you do like this?
And he goes like this man,

943
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,860
it also explained a muscle muscle up is 
you grab a pull up bar and so you go and

944
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:58,970
you go through the whole pull up motion 
of pulling yourself chin over the bar.

945
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:04,180
But once you get up to that point,
you pull your body all the way over the 

946
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,520
top of the bar.
So now you're,

947
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,640
you're a,
a,

948
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,780
the bar is now at your waist and your,
you've got your arms completely extended

949
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,520
out.
It's ridiculously difficult.

950
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:11,950
Hard thing to do.
And,

951
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,930
and hector wasn't doing it like kicking 
his feet like a crazy fuck.

952
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:20,260
He was just like,
like George of the jungle fucking 

953
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,690
flinging himself around like this man.

954
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,510
Yeah,
like that.

955
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:28,570
You know,
you didn't have to do 12 of them to 

956
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:28,570
prove it,
but you got to be 12.

957
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,810
It's something like,
he just fucking popped him out and he 

958
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:31,810
goes,
I do pull up all the time map mode,

959
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:31,810
the digital,
the digital.

960
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,430
Jesus Christ got that crazy judo 
strength.

961
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,010
He's got crazy.
Everything is crazy.

962
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:38,960
Genetics.
Crazy mentality.

963
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,060
Yeah.
Well it's.

964
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:42,500
When it works,
it's fantastic.

965
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,270
You know,
he's an exciting guy to watch,

966
00:39:44,271 --> 00:39:45,080
man.
That dude,

967
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,050
he's got some fucking freak power in his
hands too.

968
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,400
He can hit.
He's fast.

969
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:51,050
He's very sharp.
He's a,

970
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:54,200
he's more of a,
he's not a heavy puncher.

971
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:56,120
And like that heavy flooding.
He's a,

972
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:57,510
he's a snapper.
Yeah.

973
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,030
Yeah.

974
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,870
Throws his hips into things.
You know.

975
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,310
That's one thing about judo guys as well
as a wrestler guys,

976
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,400
once they learn,
like especially a wrestler has got a 

977
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,741
good power double once they learn how to
put that same effort and energy into a 

978
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,641
punch like you saw with Erin Simpson,
Erin Simpson started putting people 

979
00:40:14,641 --> 00:40:14,920
away,
learn to spring into his punches.

980
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:19,921
You know,
once those guys really learn how to do 

981
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:19,921
that.
Like Henderson,

982
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:21,490
Rashad Evans,
Rashad Evans has gotten ridiculous right

983
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:21,740
hand.

984
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,460
Rashad has tons more,
tons and tons of power.

985
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:25,390
Uh,
I think it's.

986
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:27,040
Timing is terrible though.
Yeah.

987
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:32,190
He often whiffs tons of punches were I 
think he's throwing without thinking 

988
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,050
instead of setting up that strike that 
he's looking for instead,

989
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,670
I think you don't think he's getting 
better at that now.

990
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm sure there's improvement,
but I still think that that is like,

991
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:43,630
he doesn't lack speed at all super fast.
He doesn't lack power.

992
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,030
Uh,
I've,

993
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,090
I remember watching the chuck flight 
gets going,

994
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:51,091
man,
he's getting tore apart in terms of 

995
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:53,791
timing,
but chuck's hands are so down that and 

996
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:53,791
that,
that,

997
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:54,250
that right handy,
that right hook.

998
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,280
He keeps throwing his,
got knockout all over,

999
00:40:57,281 --> 00:40:58,750
like you don't want to get touched by 
that.

1000
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:03,751
And boom,
he gets beat Clemson with it and chuck 

1001
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:06,661
goes out like a light or even he got on 
top of forest and he threw just a punch 

1002
00:41:06,661 --> 00:41:08,200
from down on top,
but it had such snap on it.

1003
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:13,410
Boom,
tort a forest was out from there that 

1004
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,980
were shot of the chunk of Delphi.
There were shot that you saw against.

1005
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:15,950
Um,
uh,

1006
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,250
who's this last fight?
Well,

1007
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:23,251
Jones,
but I wouldn't even know in his last 

1008
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:23,251
fight

1009
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:23,251
are any fight.
Um,

1010
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,160
Mr.
Wonderful.

1011
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:24,560
Denise.

1012
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,820
Oh he did.
But even still they're like,

1013
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:28,440
I don't,
he's still not,

1014
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,140
he's not really a timing's better,
but he still like,

1015
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:34,140
there's so many opportunities that I 
think he's a,

1016
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,920
in terms of lining up good solid shots 
and uh,

1017
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:43,010
and putting his opponents away.
I still don't think he has as much 

1018
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,880
comfort and I'm just like,
he's not as at home on his feet as a 

1019
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:49,560
striker,
still as,

1020
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,290
as perhaps as he could be.
Well,

1021
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:53,970
he's been training with spong now,
you know,

1022
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:57,840
those guys that done at the Blackzilians
with spong and with that Henry,

1023
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,110
who's that guy,
I'm sure those guys put them through pad

1024
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:03,200
work and all the different because they 
Davis Friday.

1025
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,360
I thought that was like some of his best
striking one of his best fight.

1026
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,740
I just think what it comes down to is 
it's not even necessarily the,

1027
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:11,810
uh,
the,

1028
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,690
the pad work he's doing or the technical
work or even just the flat out sparring.

1029
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:20,690
I think it has to be a very engineered 
drilling scenario to try and awakened 

1030
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:24,540
that potential in somebody.
A lot of times people they think,

1031
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:29,541
well,
I need to get better on my feet so I'm 

1032
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:29,670
just going to spar more and spar harder.
But actually what happens is,

1033
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:34,671
is it's a,
it's like the difference between doing 

1034
00:42:34,671 --> 00:42:35,380
shoulders and doing your rotator cuffs 
when you're doing your shoulders.

1035
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:38,310
Like every muscle group comes into play 
and often you know,

1036
00:42:38,311 --> 00:42:40,170
things like the rotator cuffs,
the weakest link,

1037
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,500
you're not going to really draw upon 
that because that's not made for 

1038
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:45,500
shoving,
you know,

1039
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:45,500
weight,
overhead,

1040
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,640
big heavyweight.
And and high stress loads,

1041
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:52,790
so all of this other stuff is going to 
compensate for your little muscles so 

1042
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,451
they don't have to work nearly as hard 
when you've got these big movers in 

1043
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:56,451
place,
well,

1044
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:56,580
when you need to work your rotator 
cuffs,

1045
00:42:56,581 --> 00:43:00,390
you have to use a small way on purpose 
because you have to try and get all this

1046
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:05,391
to shut down so that it doesn't come 
into play and you can work just those 

1047
00:43:05,391 --> 00:43:09,471
little tiny muscles that often get over 
overlooked and over compensated by the 

1048
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:13,821
bigger muscle groups and that's how you 
work your rotator cuffs and you don't 

1049
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:14,010
doing small weight because you're a 
pussy.

1050
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,920
If you got to do small weight because 
otherwise you're not going to engage.

1051
00:43:16,921 --> 00:43:19,980
Those muscles and other muscles are 
going to come in and take over,

1052
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:25,190
which you don't want.
You're trying to work on something very 

1053
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,190
specific.
Same thing with standup work.

1054
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:28,980
You can't go out there and just go 
harder and go fast and go tougher.

1055
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Sometimes you've got to really dial that
shit way the hell back way slower and 

1056
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,911
just start putting yourself in two 
different mindsets and start putting 

1057
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:40,080
yourself into a position where,
okay,

1058
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:41,610
well,
what am I working on here?

1059
00:43:41,611 --> 00:43:46,611
I'm always retreating too much.
Like so maybe you cut up like a little 

1060
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:49,881
square and you've got to stay within it 
and you got to move slow and light and 

1061
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:53,631
just get used to getting hit and then 
rolling with the punches and you're 

1062
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,990
slipping and your,
your head movement and because often you

1063
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:55,320
know,
okay,

1064
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:57,720
I'm going to work on my defense this 
round and you're going hard.

1065
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,930
You just get your head harder one 
direction or the other.

1066
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,940
Dip harder,
swing faster,

1067
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,240
but you don't what?
You don't realize that you're actually 

1068
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,570
overcompensating your technique by your 
athleticism.

1069
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,230
Yes.
And uh,

1070
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:16,610
what you have to do,
if you really want to work your 

1071
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:16,610
technique,
you got to scale it way the fuck back.

1072
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:20,630
You gotta you gotta train the mind,
the eyes and the body all at the same 

1073
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:20,630
time.
And it's different

1074
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:25,830
in this approach.
Your approach is one of the reasons why 

1075
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,350
you're this many years in the game.
Now.

1076
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,360
I said I saw you fight way back in super
raw,

1077
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:30,190
which was in the nineties,
right when,

1078
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,340
right.

1079
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,000
You're going to make 99.

1080
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,620
Well,
I started my career in like a 96,

1081
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:35,860
97,
but this,

1082
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:40,450
this approach to it,
this cerebral approach did this the only

1083
00:44:40,451 --> 00:44:44,200
way you stay this lucid but this many 
years in the fight game.

1084
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,210
But this is the only way,
right?

1085
00:44:46,211 --> 00:44:46,480
I mean

1086
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,950
much that uh,
and uh,

1087
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:54,070
you know,
fucking people up bad so they can't 

1088
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:54,130
really do.
But uh,

1089
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:59,170
back at Amc we used to do a lot of 
flowing drills and things just weren't 

1090
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,240
all about killing each other.
I mean we had a lot of time killing each

1091
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,680
other to trust me there.
Fuck,

1092
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,120
you have to have both.
Yeah.

1093
00:45:05,121 --> 00:45:06,110
I mean,
we,

1094
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,080
we have a good balance and the problem 
with especially like,

1095
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:14,081
so I've got this reputation of not being
able to keep sparring partners and all 

1096
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:14,081
this stuff,
you know,

1097
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:18,010
because the problem is they come in 
during fight training and they get 

1098
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,180
fucked up and I don't go to injure 
anybody,

1099
00:45:20,181 --> 00:45:21,500
but you're damn right.
I beat him up.

1100
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:24,040
So are you,
when you're doing flight training,

1101
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,390
are you going full clip every sparring 
session?

1102
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:27,550
Do you go 70 percent?

1103
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,450
Well,
usually 80 to 80 to 90

1104
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,430
now.
Isn't that a.

1105
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:33,350
it's a,
it's a fascinating thing.

1106
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:38,410
The idea of how to correctly prepare 
someone for an mma fight and with you 

1107
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:43,160
it's got to be really difficult because 
it's probably not a lot of dudes.

1108
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,200
You're going to take advice from that 
know more than you at this stage of the 

1109
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,601
game.
So when you're piecing together your 

1110
00:45:52,601 --> 00:45:55,691
training programs,
you're piecing together your stand up 

1111
00:45:55,691 --> 00:45:57,380
and you're grappling and how do you,
how do you decide like how much time you

1112
00:45:57,381 --> 00:45:59,480
should put on this and how do you 
engineer it?

1113
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,300
It's a balance.
You have to be very honest with yourself

1114
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:09,301
on what's necessary and you can't just 
sit back and have this pride and ego 

1115
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:13,590
step over what what is important towards
developing you're training and I've got 

1116
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:17,890
guys like Eric Paulson and there's 
Paulson is a walking,

1117
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:20,270
talking encyclopedia,
fucking people up and.

1118
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,320
But he also has the tendency to just 
start pulling from everywhere sometimes 

1119
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:25,420
and so he'll throw in these techniques.
I'm like,

1120
00:46:25,421 --> 00:46:26,590
Dude,
one,

1121
00:46:26,591 --> 00:46:28,100
I've never even done that in too.
That's.

1122
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,740
I don't fucking really think that's 
applicable,

1123
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:32,020
but that's just how Paulson is.
He'll hit you,

1124
00:46:32,021 --> 00:46:32,620
you know,
you say,

1125
00:46:32,621 --> 00:46:33,610
all right,
let's do a,

1126
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,780
let's work on some hand combos and he'll
throw a thousand of them that you.

1127
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,700
And.
But the thing is,

1128
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:42,820
is that there is tons of valuable 
information and tweaks.

1129
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:47,821
It can be made.
You have to be smart enough and open 

1130
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:47,821
enough and,
and,

1131
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:51,910
and present enough in this type of 
training to work with him to develop all

1132
00:46:51,911 --> 00:46:52,420
those skills.

1133
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,420
I mean,
I have all kinds of tricks that I've 

1134
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:57,420
picked up from Paulson over the years 
that are.

1135
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,280
I know it wouldn't have gotten any place
else because people don't have that kind

1136
00:47:00,281 --> 00:47:02,080
of background martial background and 
even,

1137
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,160
uh,
you know,

1138
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:06,430
I've got specific coaches that what I do
is when I go on a train with them,

1139
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:11,431
I really narrow it all down and I do 
exactly what I'm there to do with them 

1140
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:16,050
and then when I'm done with it,
then I have to assess all the data that 

1141
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:20,401
I got from that training session and how
that's going to apply to me in the ring 

1142
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:22,270
with my overall strategy,
what works best,

1143
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:24,040
where my natural tendencies are,
are,

1144
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:27,370
and under certain scenarios and just in 
general and uh,

1145
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:32,371
and how to best incorporate it.
If I'll go and I'll do a training 

1146
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:33,480
session.
Often I'll have a hill.

1147
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:38,620
My coach Nixonian will have me doing 
these six seven punchkick combos or 

1148
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,380
involve me spinning and hook kicking and
all this kind of stuff.

1149
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:44,770
I'm never probably going to be able to 
pull that off.

1150
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,450
Uh,
in the ring.

1151
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,660
You know,
that whole start to finish at the top of

1152
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,650
the double kicks up top boom,
spend bank,

1153
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:51,250
come back,
boom,

1154
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:51,580
boom,
boom.

1155
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:56,581
Like,
but there are pieces that I could take 

1156
00:47:56,581 --> 00:47:59,161
from that and use it in a combination or
use a setup to something else or set up 

1157
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,750
to a take down or is it counter?
Uh,

1158
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:04,570
also just the ability to be more 
dexterous,

1159
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:09,571
more able,
more agile and just have better body 

1160
00:48:09,571 --> 00:48:09,571
control and balance.
Uh,

1161
00:48:09,571 --> 00:48:14,550
yeah.
That's why GSP has been doing 

1162
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:14,550
gymnastics.
It's fantastic.

1163
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,350
If I wasn't a big son of a bitch who 
thinks their arms just pull off,

1164
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:22,351
I tried to do it.
Not to mention who's a deteriorated his 

1165
00:48:22,351 --> 00:48:24,700
body with years and years of training 
and whores and alcohol.

1166
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,210
Uh,
it,

1167
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:30,260
maybe I would do more in gymnastics 
other than bedroom.

1168
00:48:30,261 --> 00:48:31,450
Gymnastics.
Yeah.

1169
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:34,390
My leg doesn't go there.
You shouldn't try either.

1170
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,120
You can't even do rubber guard pulling 
any kind of ironic.

1171
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:39,320
Not really a

1172
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:40,700
so don't know the,
you're,

1173
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:45,701
you're a leg lock master.
You've known for your leg locks but it 

1174
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:45,701
needs are all fucked.

1175
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:47,080
Oh yeah.
I mean knees,

1176
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:47,800
ankles,
all.

1177
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:50,070
I mean everything takes the price.
But uh,

1178
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,840
um,
no,

1179
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:52,810
I can't do rubber guard especially.
I'm just not,

1180
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,010
don't have that kind of flexibility that
way.

1181
00:48:55,011 --> 00:48:55,600
And,
but uh,

1182
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,130
I understand how it works,
you know,

1183
00:48:57,131 --> 00:49:02,131
I mean I can do pieces of it and I can,
I can get down there with someone like 

1184
00:49:02,131 --> 00:49:06,060
Victor Webster or a,
a role for any of those dudes from 10th 

1185
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:06,060
planet and go,
okay,

1186
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,650
well while you're working this,
your angle is off here.

1187
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:10,390
You need to apply your pressure.
There you this,

1188
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:10,960
that,
you know,

1189
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,150
whatever.
And you know,

1190
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,700
I'll do stuff if I'm at Eddie's just 
rolling with vic and those dudes.

1191
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:18,040
I'll throw rubber guard type shit on 
Vic.

1192
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:23,041
Best,
my best approximation and sometimes I 

1193
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:23,380
come up with some pretty clever stuff.
Somebody asked me,

1194
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,120
why are all these fighters getting 
injured?

1195
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:30,140
Wow.
These fighters getting engine pulling 

1196
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,140
out of fights.
I'm like,

1197
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,110
because they're doing a sport where the 
whole key to the sport,

1198
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:34,020
the,
the end game is breaking people's bodies

1199
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,940
and then the practicing it all the time.
Sure.

1200
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:41,210
How do you intelligently approach it's.
So you get through all the training but 

1201
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,850
with as little injury to your body as 
possible.

1202
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:47,580
Do you engineer that or you just roll 
the dice?

1203
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:47,860
I mean,

1204
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,850
I think it's a little of both.
I mean,

1205
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:53,450
there's a lot of a factors that you just
can't account for,

1206
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:54,290
you know,
somebody,

1207
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:57,830
excuse me,
somebody just rolls into your leg,

1208
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,160
whatever.
Nuts that's been coming up a lot lately.

1209
00:50:01,161 --> 00:50:04,070
And Dana talked about it that Rashad 
Evans had to pull out of a fight.

1210
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:09,071
The actual fight where Shogun lost the 
title to Jon Jones shot was supposed to 

1211
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:14,381
fight Shogun,
but Diego Sanchez was wrestling with 

1212
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:16,840
some dude and accidentally see that 
that's just a lot easier.

1213
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,520
That's near each other.

1214
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,450
No they shouldn't.
And,

1215
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,840
and one thing that I got from Japan and 
just always made total sense to me at,

1216
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:28,620
uh,
at AACC A,

1217
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,150
our bay and we were going to be Fuji is 
Jim.

1218
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,810
The other people that aren't wrestling 
stand in between all the other folks and

1219
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:40,811
keep them from running into each other.
We do that attend planet 10 flat does 

1220
00:50:40,811 --> 00:50:40,811
that happened to.
And that's a,

1221
00:50:40,811 --> 00:50:42,470
that's a nice thing if you could just 
come on,

1222
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:44,570
you got to be smart with your training.
And sometimes like,

1223
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:46,040
hey look,
look at this fighter.

1224
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,690
He is completely beat down.
Wore out and,

1225
00:50:49,691 --> 00:50:50,630
and he's,
you know,

1226
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:53,090
yeah,
you can try and get him to mentally push

1227
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,250
through all this kind of stuff,
but guess what?

1228
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,280
That muscle fatigue is there and he's,
he's right to be injured right now to 

1229
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:00,280
change training.
Yeah,

1230
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:00,920
change your training.

1231
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:06,090
That's where intelligence comes in and 
that's what people don't understand 

1232
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:06,850
about mma is that,
you know,

1233
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,900
I've,
I've had people like write these really 

1234
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:11,900
stupid things that are just knee jerk 
reaction.

1235
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:16,830
Oh,
these brain dead knee jerk reactions to 

1236
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:16,930
stuff.
I bet you've seen this,

1237
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:22,190
you've seen this amongst people,
but when you really break it down in,

1238
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,010
in order to really be at a high level 
and compete in mma,

1239
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:30,940
you are managing a lot of shit mentally,
emotionally,

1240
00:51:30,941 --> 00:51:33,310
physically,
and on top of that,

1241
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:38,490
you're trying to piece together the game
with the most consequences of any other 

1242
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:41,440
game that the game of fucking people up 
or getting fucked up.

1243
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,540
There's the most consequences 
emotionally.

1244
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:48,541
Most consequences physically.
Anybody who thinks losing a basketball 

1245
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:49,820
game as hard as you could go out.

1246
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:50,840
They're in,
you know,

1247
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,920
going out and as a team losing,
uh,

1248
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:56,070
let's say the NBA championships sucks,
you know what I mean,

1249
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:01,430
but it really is only a real 
motherfucker if you have the game 

1250
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,970
winning shot and you were actually 
inside the,

1251
00:52:02,971 --> 00:52:05,220
uh,
the key and you throw it up and you blew

1252
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:08,910
it.
Now that is way that's really painful.

1253
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,420
That flows,
that's as close as you can get.

1254
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:17,421
That kind of thing to being a fighter 
and losing a major fight on national,

1255
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:21,560
worldwide television.
That's.

1256
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:25,320
And even still,
it has to be the championship.

1257
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,650
You have to lose the APP,
that entire championship to do that.

1258
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:31,980
And here's the,
the thing that also why it doesn't quite

1259
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,960
get to that point for,
for that per,

1260
00:52:33,961 --> 00:52:38,961
that basketball player versus the 
fighter because next year you get 

1261
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:40,170
another chance to just do it all over 
again.

1262
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,680
And while you may have blown it and the 
whole city is like,

1263
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:43,800
fuck you,
you suck,

1264
00:52:43,801 --> 00:52:44,900
whatever,
blah,

1265
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:45,540
blah,
blah.

1266
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,500
No one kicked your ass at the.
So.

1267
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:53,510
So now you go and you compound the fact 
that not only did you just do something 

1268
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:57,470
you had at all the cards,
you had all everything in front of you 

1269
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:00,051
and this was your chance.
Not only did you blow it in front of 

1270
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,691
everyone,
but somebody beat your ass to make you 

1271
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:05,211
blow it.
You didn't just go out there and fuck 

1272
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:05,211
up.
No,

1273
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:06,510
you got fucked up and you lost.
You have the mental management

1274
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,460
of all these different things.
The physical task of actually fighting,

1275
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:15,461
controlling your energy,
knowing how to pace yourself on top of 

1276
00:53:15,461 --> 00:53:19,121
knowing what to execute and there's so 
many dimensions to execution as opposed 

1277
00:53:19,121 --> 00:53:24,071
to like a standard,
like a basketball game or a boxing 

1278
00:53:24,071 --> 00:53:24,071
match.
The dimensions.

1279
00:53:24,071 --> 00:53:25,780
I have so many messages,
fourth dimension,

1280
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,150
like my third eye,
my brown eye.

1281
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,220
When you're adding in,
I mean like how many?

1282
00:53:30,221 --> 00:53:35,221
Look,
I've watched a cro cop today versus 

1283
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:35,221
random and we were watching best of 
pride.

1284
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:38,950
I was going off on twitter,
did the fucking best of pride today was 

1285
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:42,271
insane.
It was a Dan Henderson's a second fight 

1286
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,340
with vandelay,
which is like one of the greatest fights

1287
00:53:42,341 --> 00:53:43,570
of all time.
That was awesome.

1288
00:53:43,571 --> 00:53:47,800
And then they showed cro cop getting 
knocked out by random in and I was like,

1289
00:53:47,801 --> 00:53:52,801
man,
that is where that wrestling dimension 

1290
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:56,491
really falls into place because cro cop 
is so worried about that takedown that 

1291
00:53:56,491 --> 00:54:01,351
he gets clipped with a big punch right 
where he probably would not have gotten 

1292
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:01,510
clip with that.
It was just a standard standup.

1293
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:06,540
Like exactly.
It just makes it all so random or 

1294
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:06,540
engaging the fake.
And then he came up with new.

1295
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,990
The kick was coming.
That's when he threw the punch.

1296
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:13,020
There's so much intelligence and 
strategy and consequence and it's like 

1297
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:18,090
it's,
it's such a highly charged game that 

1298
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,671
when people like say things about it,
like a bunch of braindead Mongoloid is 

1299
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,840
beating the shit out of each other.
It's just like sand some.

1300
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,040
But it's such a silly point of view.
It is.

1301
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:27,150
It says that it's just

1302
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,530
anytime,
like I read something,

1303
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:30,810
uh,
and this,

1304
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:32,740
this really got to me.
There was a,

1305
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,880
an article on,
there's this new thing on vice called 

1306
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:37,880
fight land.
Yes.

1307
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,500
And one of the guys on there,
uh,

1308
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,170
likes to interview musicians about what 
were their fight music b,

1309
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:45,070
and he interviewed some guy that's like 
a producer or something and the guy just

1310
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:50,460
essentially just spewed vitriol about 
how stupid fighting isn't fighting is 

1311
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,600
dumb and that's what idiots do and 
that's what we've regressed with.

1312
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:54,430
That's a regression.
We progress past that,

1313
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:59,460
you know,
the uncultured and the society is 

1314
00:54:59,460 --> 00:54:59,460
unlike.
That's what animals do.

1315
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,010
Animals and babies fight and I'm like,
fuck you,

1316
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,160
you know,
I'm sorry that you're a lopsided 

1317
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:07,160
individual and that you actually,
the physicality,

1318
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,670
the physical part of your brain and your
body are basically defunct and you've 

1319
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:15,991
thrown that away and you think that 
somehow that makes you a superior human 

1320
00:55:15,991 --> 00:55:15,991
being because actually what it makes 
you,

1321
00:55:15,991 --> 00:55:16,750
it makes you a defect.

1322
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:22,080
You're the kind of thing that I don't 
want to be out there breeding to make a 

1323
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,200
better human race because you're not 
gunna.

1324
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:28,230
Because you've decided to throw away a 
part of it is as essential as a human 

1325
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,670
being and fighting doesn't have to be 
angry,

1326
00:55:30,671 --> 00:55:32,620
violent,
animalistic,

1327
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:35,440
just to dogs and cats going at it,
you know,

1328
00:55:35,441 --> 00:55:36,720
that kind of thing.
It has,

1329
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:41,500
it can be so much more than that and it 
doesn't in any physical endeavor is more

1330
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:44,440
than that and can be more than that.
And it was just such a Shitty,

1331
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,950
narrow point of view that I thought,
well,

1332
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:50,290
for someone who supposed to be so 
educated to say such a thing,

1333
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:52,000
like it really got under my fucking 
skin,

1334
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:53,220
like mad,
like maybe

1335
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:58,720
up on it.
But I just thought it was ridiculous to 

1336
00:55:59,331 --> 00:56:00,110
say that,
look,

1337
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:05,130
I've been in the presence of people who 
have called me an idiot for doing 

1338
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:05,840
martial arts or even working out,
you know,

1339
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:06,740
I've had like,
you know,

1340
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:11,741
the people mock that you take care of 
your body and it's just a defense 

1341
00:56:11,741 --> 00:56:12,350
mechanism because they're smoking 
cigarettes.

1342
00:56:12,351 --> 00:56:13,910
I didn't know they're rotting themselves
away.

1343
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:19,060
And so there's some weird justification 
that there's like an intellectual 

1344
00:56:19,401 --> 00:56:22,310
argument for the finite lifespan of the 
human being and why.

1345
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:24,470
Fuck with it anyway.
Why even worry about it?

1346
00:56:24,471 --> 00:56:29,471
What do you.
What do you do when you're trying to 

1347
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:29,471
stay alive forever?
What are you doing?

1348
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:29,510
Eating Greens and taking your vitamins.
What have you taken?

1349
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:34,511
Steroids?
What are you trying to live forever and 

1350
00:56:34,511 --> 00:56:36,470
you know that that attitude of they 
can't be bothered with exercise like,

1351
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,480
well,
that is one of the dumbest things you're

1352
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:39,860
telling me.
You're an intelligent person.

1353
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:44,870
You want me to respect your opinion.
You have these cynical points of views 

1354
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,621
on things,
but yet you're not taking care of your 

1355
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:47,621
meat vehicle.
Right?

1356
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:47,621
Okay.
What are you retarded?

1357
00:56:47,621 --> 00:56:49,520
The thing that holds the brain,
the computer.

1358
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:54,560
Then all this I suppose,
and intelligence and wisdom and and all 

1359
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,420
of the filter that you have to do 
everything in the spew out.

1360
00:56:56,421 --> 00:57:00,500
Anything that you experienced in the 
world exists within this.

1361
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:03,380
You don't just drive a car into the 
fucking ground and throw it away.

1362
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,360
It's dumb.
Yeah.

1363
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,430
If you,
if your car works,

1364
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,020
take care of it.
Okay.

1365
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:13,080
Change the oil stupid.
And when you deal with people that 

1366
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,500
somehow or another words,
it's hilarious.

1367
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,740
That is.
There's like a whole section of humanity

1368
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,920
that thinks that for some reason that 
they,

1369
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:26,010
by issuing anything physical and 
sweating and that they are a superior 

1370
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:29,110
intellect,
the judge,

1371
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:34,410
a person like yourself or anybody who's 
doing something physical as being an 

1372
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:38,701
inferior intellect,
you almost automatically get 

1373
00:57:38,701 --> 00:57:38,701
categorized.
Oh,

1374
00:57:38,701 --> 00:57:38,701
you are a,
a,

1375
00:57:38,701 --> 00:57:40,030
a martial artist.
Oh you,

1376
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:40,600
you fucked up.

1377
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,940
Cute on you.
Must be dumb.

1378
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:43,750
Oh,
that's great.

1379
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:48,751
I can't wait.
I'm glad that you can push a broom 

1380
00:57:48,751 --> 00:57:48,751
better than somebody else.
Now it's like no asshole.

1381
00:57:48,751 --> 00:57:49,690
It's not.
Got nothing to do with that.

1382
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:50,260
And while,
yes,

1383
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:52,210
I could out broom you,
but uh,

1384
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,800
and probably out fuck your wife,
but probably either way be able to wrap 

1385
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,650
their head around what it must've been 
like to be in.

1386
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:02,080
Like what was the biggest arena you guys
played in Japan?

1387
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,620
Tokyo national outdoor stadium.
Ninety $3,000.

1388
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:10,540
Went out there with Bob Sapp and called 
out Nogueira right in front of 93,000

1389
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:12,650
fans in Japanese.
3,000

1390
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:14,770
people.
Holy Shit.

1391
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,720
Who did you fight?
I didn't get to fight thing.

1392
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,730
I wish I could have.
I was Bob's coach.

1393
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,760
I walked out and then I got into the 
center of the ring called out Nogueira 

1394
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,091
after beating bombed.
What's the biggest crowd that you ever 

1395
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:27,091
had?
Was it 50,000

1396
00:58:27,091 --> 00:58:30,250
at the Tokyo Dome when I fought a shaky 
Takahashi defending the king of pancreas

1397
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,370
belt for new Japan pro wrestling.
Ultimate crushed too.

1398
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,600
I was 55,
I think it was 60,000

1399
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:41,630
Andrea Rogers Centre in Toronto for the 
George St Pierre and Jake Shields and 

1400
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:43,200
that was insane.

1401
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,630
It's nuts and I was,
I mean also to add to.

1402
00:58:46,631 --> 00:58:48,820
I fought in front of like 50,
55,000

1403
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:53,500
people.
I fought on the same car where a Leo toe

1404
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,960
made his uh,
his debut.

1405
00:58:56,110 --> 00:59:01,110
So I knew that kid when we all,
the only way we could converse was 

1406
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:05,070
through Japanese because he didn't 
really speak English at the time and I 

1407
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:06,520
didn't speak any Portuguese.
And then that card why fought,

1408
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,010
you know,
50 in front of 50,000

1409
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:12,400
plus I've fought on the same car.
That whole cogan wrestled on

1410
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,040
mix it up with pro wrestling as well.
Right.

1411
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,800
That was a big thing in Japan,
right?

1412
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:18,640
Like they,
they would,

1413
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:23,670
they would mix in pro wrestling and then
they would also have pro wrestlers who 

1414
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,310
would fight shoots,
they would fight real mma fight.

1415
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,010
There was a real,
um,

1416
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:30,560
want to try and bridge that gap again 
and you know,

1417
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,410
what it takes the right individual and 
it takes the right kind of planning.

1418
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:38,411
There wasn't really a good amount of 
planning put behind getting those 

1419
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:39,350
wrestlers prepared to do it.
They were just really,

1420
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:43,040
a lot of them were just shoved into 
these scenarios where Yakuza no,

1421
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,170
just by,
they're just my Japanese,

1422
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,810
a bureaucracy.
Politics as it is,

1423
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:48,170
like,
you know,

1424
00:59:48,171 --> 00:59:50,930
this is your shot is,
is your boss or whatever.

1425
00:59:50,931 --> 00:59:55,931
Like if he says,
go do this and you really gotTa fucking 

1426
00:59:55,931 --> 00:59:55,931
do it.
And that's just the way it goes.

1427
00:59:55,931 --> 00:59:58,910
If you're a big time pro wrestler to 
Takata and your,

1428
00:59:58,911 --> 01:00:01,240
your boss comes out.
Takotna was a huge progress for big,

1429
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,870
handsome Japanese motherfucker,
right?

1430
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:08,110
Um,
he went into MMA and he had a couple of 

1431
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:10,761
fishy fights,
like the forum with Coleman that was 

1432
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:11,280
fishy as Coleman is a goddamn terrible 
actor.

1433
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,650
I love Mark Coleman.
I love the hammer.

1434
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,240
He's the original.
Matt Hamill.

1435
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,870
Was that he just had a birthday.
Yeah,

1436
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:24,020
I love the fuck out of that dude.
He's important due to hang out with 

1437
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,200
Lundbeck.
I tell him he's got amazing stories for 

1438
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:26,200
days.
He's great to work with.

1439
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,860
He's a good dude too.
I hung out with him when he was the 

1440
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:30,870
champ in Augusta,
Georgia.

1441
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,710
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

1442
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,840
We went to this crazy club that was 
like,

1443
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:35,460
it was,
it wasn't like a house,

1444
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:37,140
like someone had turned the house into a
club.

1445
01:00:37,141 --> 01:00:38,890
I mean,
it was a mess about,

1446
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:39,380
uh,
you know,

1447
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,060
it was like in the nineties when he was 
the champ.

1448
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:47,290
Awesome.
The godfather of ground and pound love 

1449
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:50,631
Coleman.
But his fight with Dakota was clearly 

1450
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:50,631
fucker.
And so.

1451
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:50,631
Okay.
So here's an example.

1452
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:51,090
Well,
so,

1453
01:00:51,091 --> 01:00:52,570
uh,
uh,

1454
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:56,850
I find a Gnocchi bond by 2003,
I think

1455
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:01,850
it was.
I don't understand what we're talking 

1456
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:01,850
about.
We're talking about fixed fights.

1457
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:05,530
We're talking about.
There was a few fights where they had 

1458
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,551
predetermined outcomes because they 
wanted these big Japanese Superhero 

1459
01:01:07,551 --> 01:01:07,551
dudes to,
to win.

1460
01:01:07,551 --> 01:01:08,880
And there was a couple of them that were
kind of obvious.

1461
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:09,630
So,
uh,

1462
01:01:09,631 --> 01:01:14,631
I'm fine finding this,
an Okie Bombay card and Kobe stadium 

1463
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:16,400
that was a combination card because this
card was all filed,

1464
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:18,720
eliminate.
This one was all fights and uh,

1465
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:23,721
I fought some shield night,
defended the king of pancrase title 

1466
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:24,720
against who is the former king of 
pancreas guy before me.

1467
01:01:24,721 --> 01:01:25,260
So,
uh,

1468
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:30,470
so it was a rematch against semi and uh,
on that same card as my friend,

1469
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,970
a fellow new Japan pro wrestling at the 
time.

1470
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,910
And it still is Eugene anegada fought,
fueled our.

1471
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:41,420
And here's the thing,
he got pushed into that like three or 

1472
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:42,730
four weeks out.
Oh,

1473
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:45,600
my niece.
And his attitude was just like,

1474
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,430
all right,
well this,

1475
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:47,400
you know,
I got to do it.

1476
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,840
They want them,
they want me to fight him.

1477
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:54,080
So to make sure that this guy in the 
fuel basically fights on this card and 

1478
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:59,181
they have a match where people are going
to be all interested to see it because 

1479
01:01:59,181 --> 01:01:59,181
I'm another name,
I'll do it.

1480
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:01,080
And so I did my best to help him out,
train him.

1481
01:02:01,081 --> 01:02:06,081
I even paid stitch to who was there with
me as my cut and quarter guy to go to 

1482
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:11,331
wrap his hands and work on his cuts too,
and I did the best I could and I 

1483
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:14,811
cornered the Kata and you know,
there wasn't all right corner to Nevada 

1484
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:15,450
and they're just eating.
He just wasn't.

1485
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,010
He Won.
He's not even fighting.

1486
01:02:17,011 --> 01:02:22,011
I mean we used to spar and wrestle and 
grapple and do all kinds of stuff on 

1487
01:02:22,011 --> 01:02:23,140
tour all the time.
Here we are always working out together,

1488
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:28,500
but that's way different from training 
for a fight and they're trying to fight 

1489
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,560
one of the absolute best guys in the 
world.

1490
01:02:29,561 --> 01:02:31,150
And then on like three weeks,
notice it.

1491
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:34,000
The a trouper man.
He's a real fucking awesome dude.

1492
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:35,950
But he got pushed into it.

1493
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:40,980
There's a different attitude though.
They're in Japan to organize what it's 

1494
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,070
called.
She organized means it can't be helped.

1495
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:45,840
So that's basically the attitude is if 
you know something shit,

1496
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:50,850
he goes down,
whatever reactor start melting down and 

1497
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,581
you as this technician or just going to 
go in there knowing you're going to 

1498
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:57,720
basically your community,
you're going to die and you're going to 

1499
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:57,720
go into your ship.
That thing down anyways,

1500
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,930
Shogun,
I can't be helped.

1501
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:04,860
That's hard for us to understand.
Well that's why a tragedy hits Japan 

1502
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,360
like that and people stand in line,
don't flip out.

1503
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,480
They take care of each other,
but it's beautiful.

1504
01:03:10,481 --> 01:03:11,230
Really.
It is.

1505
01:03:11,231 --> 01:03:14,140
And that's a.
That was another thing like the cultures

1506
01:03:14,141 --> 01:03:17,650
around the world are all different in 
the way they operate are all different.

1507
01:03:17,651 --> 01:03:20,230
So like when all the crazy shit that's 
been going on in the U,

1508
01:03:20,231 --> 01:03:25,231
s and then people are going rampant like
rabid dogs throwing out statistics from 

1509
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:30,001
this country and that country and this 
country all about different things and 

1510
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:31,530
it's like you can't really compare us to
Japan or us to the UK or us.

1511
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:36,910
Like every.
They're all different cultures and you 

1512
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:38,410
may only can compare America to America 
and the way that we are.

1513
01:03:38,411 --> 01:03:43,411
People are educated.
The way that our government system 

1514
01:03:43,411 --> 01:03:45,811
works,
the way that the populace is divided up 

1515
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:46,270
in the land that they live in,
the type of philosophies that they carry

1516
01:03:46,271 --> 01:03:51,271
and the culture that drives them makes 
them unique to America and no place 

1517
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:51,910
else.
Yeah.

1518
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,670
It's hard to wrap your head around that.
For a lot of people.

1519
01:03:54,671 --> 01:03:55,990
They think that,
you know,

1520
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:56,650
if we have

1521
01:03:56,670 --> 01:04:01,670
the same access to weapons as people do 
in other parts of the world and we'd 

1522
01:04:01,681 --> 01:04:04,980
have the same results,
but that's not the case because you look

1523
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:09,981
at parts of Africa where we've got 
complete total immersion and crime,

1524
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:16,160
you know,
like you look at Liberia and the amount 

1525
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:16,160
of guns and violence and stuff.
Like there's parts of the world that are

1526
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:16,160
just violent

1527
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:20,510
that just murdering each other everyday.
Just about this apparently South Africa.

1528
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:21,340
Even the,
the,

1529
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:24,040
what you think of as a civilized more 
um,

1530
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,060
um,
uh,

1531
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:31,210
developed parts of Africa in terms of 
like a society and a or like just like 

1532
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:35,130
city and modern type infrastructure.
I'm not here to,

1533
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,590
to,
to declare that,

1534
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,660
you know,
one way of living is better than say,

1535
01:04:38,661 --> 01:04:40,520
you know,
an aboriginal,

1536
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,120
right.
Whatever,

1537
01:04:41,121 --> 01:04:43,040
who cares?
You were just talking about technology,

1538
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:45,710
right?
So even in those,

1539
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:48,020
I mean there's like these people,
you know,

1540
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:50,180
that BMW has an,
an option.

1541
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,400
And I got this from a,
from a South African who was telling me 

1542
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:55,400
about this.
I was down racing the Baja 1001 of these

1543
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,360
guys,
uh,

1544
01:04:56,361 --> 01:04:58,820
working with the company,
a wide open was telling me about,

1545
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:02,540
uh,
about living in South Africa and how BMW

1546
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,210
has a factory option at the dealerships.
And,

1547
01:05:05,211 --> 01:05:10,211
or I think it's a factory often,
or at least it's only offered in South 

1548
01:05:10,211 --> 01:05:10,211
Africa.

1549
01:05:10,211 --> 01:05:14,530
Your bmw,
you can order an antique car jacking a 

1550
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:18,250
package and you want to hear what this 
antique car jacking packages.

1551
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,840
Yes.
Okay.

1552
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:25,020
What they do is they install propane 
tanks into these cars and they put a set

1553
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:29,380
of burners along the the side trim down 
there and below the door,

1554
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:34,360
so if somebody comes and take car jack 
you because it is so prevalent,

1555
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,840
you hit this [inaudible] button and 
flames shoot out the fucking car and you

1556
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:41,890
char them to death.
I love that.

1557
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:45,060
And you know what the cops do,
they come rolling up in South Africa.

1558
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:45,580
They're like,
oh,

1559
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,260
another one.
Wow,

1560
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,090
I need to get that.
And have you seen that?

1561
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:52,000
Can pull that up.
Little feverish.

1562
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:57,001
I don't even know how true this is,
but I've seen the thing rolling around 

1563
01:05:57,001 --> 01:06:00,121
on facebook and whatever about some 
female doctor in South Africa because 

1564
01:06:00,121 --> 01:06:02,540
rape is so such a fricking often rape 
content.

1565
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,470
They make that insertion device with 
barbs in it.

1566
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,280
Yes,
it does.

1567
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:10,630
Can you imagine living in a society 
where you have to wear as a woman,

1568
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,810
you have to wear a condom with spikes in
it,

1569
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:17,390
but to protect yourself from rape?
Yeah,

1570
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,270
because there's.
There's that much rape going on.

1571
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:22,670
It's basically like the jungle.
How W W as close.

1572
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,860
Closest people can get to in terms of 
behavior.

1573
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:26,320
Uh,
another thing,

1574
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:28,390
my buddy from South Africa was telling 
me about his,

1575
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:29,410
uh,
at one point.

1576
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:30,940
So he,
he did get,

1577
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,340
so they have tricky ways of carjacking,
you know,

1578
01:06:33,341 --> 01:06:34,330
down there.
So he does,

1579
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:36,850
he gets car jacked and he's not in his 
car and uh,

1580
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
in a way that he can hit this burners 
and kill these fuckers.

1581
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,360
So they carjack um,
they,

1582
01:06:41,361 --> 01:06:45,280
they run off and whatever and the cops 
show up and the cops chase them down and

1583
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:46,180
shoot these fuckers.

1584
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:48,400
But in the midst of that,
where they leave the guy,

1585
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,940
they have to leave the guy to go track 
down these dudes.

1586
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:54,250
So my friends just sitting there and 
they go,

1587
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:55,180
hey,
here you go.

1588
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,330
And they just hand them a specter 
submachine gun a go.

1589
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:02,340
All right,
if these guys come back around to shoot 

1590
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:02,340
him.
Whoa.

1591
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:02,340
So there is,
here's the place.

1592
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:06,941
But Cole have guns.
The cops just gave him a gun and told 

1593
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:09,220
him to wipe this dude.
Here's a machine gun.

1594
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:11,590
Hold your ground.
Holy Fuck.

1595
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:12,910
Here's the car jacking.
They,

1596
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,320
I've actually seen this before.
It's crazy.

1597
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,780
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.

1598
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:18,220
I need to see this.
God bless you.

1599
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:18,360
Bye.

1600
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:26,610
Holy Fuck.
Why don't they just Jackie from the back

1601
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:30,380
door.
They have ways of trying to do.

1602
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:33,720
They're going to do this on somebody.
Somebody get cooked.

1603
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:37,920
Oh my God.
That's amazing.

1604
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,790
That is the coolest fucking thing I've 
ever seen in my life.

1605
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:47,580
And that's what people are living in.
What if you missed that switch?

1606
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,070
What if you're texting while you're 
driving?

1607
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,610
You hit that switch.
Look at this.

1608
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:54,720
Okay.
Hey,

1609
01:07:54,721 --> 01:07:56,730
I'm sorry.
Let me hit this switch real quick.

1610
01:07:56,731 --> 01:07:58,800
Where you got this gun in my face.
Oh No,

1611
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:01,980
it's not a flame thrower that I'm 
fighting for pain.

1612
01:08:01,981 --> 01:08:05,010
You smell that says,
wow,

1613
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:06,450
you need bulletproof class too.

1614
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:11,590
They probably offer that.
Can you imagine getting in a car 

1615
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:11,590
accident?
Your car just blow up.

1616
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:12,340
God bless you.
God you to see BMW.

1617
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,850
So,
so that's what I'm talking about.

1618
01:08:13,851 --> 01:08:14,540
And that,
you know,

1619
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:15,320
it's,
it's,

1620
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:20,840
yeah,
there's cultures and societies are 

1621
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,610
radically different everywhere now.
We don't necessarily need flame thrower,

1622
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,560
you know,
things on our cars.

1623
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,300
I mean,
there are probably,

1624
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:29,930
are parts of the US,
Detroit potentially,

1625
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:32,490
I don't know,
a whole lot about Detroit supposed to be

1626
01:08:32,491 --> 01:08:32,910
the best,
you know,

1627
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,820
it's supposed to be real bad,
but uh,

1628
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,420
I mean that is a viable option.
I mean,

1629
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:43,421
that could be unnecessary and it's not 
because I want to run around flame 

1630
01:08:43,421 --> 01:08:46,811
throwing people for freedom,
although I try to do most things for 

1631
01:08:46,811 --> 01:08:47,510
freedom as long as you do it with a good
country music background.

1632
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,690
And the belt buckles big something six.

1633
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,290
He gets something hanging in the 
background.

1634
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:56,840
Yeah,
you burn you Lug Eagle inside my heart,

1635
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:03,890
fire straight from Jesus,
the blood guy.

1636
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:05,730
So,
uh,

1637
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,780
I mean,
but how about this,

1638
01:09:08,781 --> 01:09:09,470
you know,
think about,

1639
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:10,550
Oh,
you're driving in your car,

1640
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:12,650
you've got your kids and whatever.
And some asshole comes up.

1641
01:09:12,651 --> 01:09:14,720
He wants to carjack you and let's just 
be honest.

1642
01:09:14,721 --> 01:09:16,610
One send me,
somebody starts pulling guns,

1643
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:21,620
knives,
any type of weapon he wants to do harm 

1644
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:21,620
to you,
but for,

1645
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,441
for his own purposes,
you have no idea what they're going to 

1646
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:24,441
do.
Oh,

1647
01:09:24,441 --> 01:09:28,301
well he's just going to know he's not.
You don't know if he's just going to 

1648
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:28,301
steal your shit.
No,

1649
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:28,301
you have no clue.
I mean,

1650
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:31,490
there was a report of a these dudes and 
like,

1651
01:09:31,491 --> 01:09:33,690
um,
I don't know if it was Mississippi.

1652
01:09:33,691 --> 01:09:38,120
It was,
it was like a bad news ghetto area,

1653
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:38,480
right?

1654
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:43,480
It was like a gnarly spot where these 
were folks who were living and 

1655
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,220
apparently these dudes carjack some 
little couple and took them back,

1656
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:47,930
took their car,
took their shit,

1657
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:49,850
took them back to their,
to their,

1658
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:52,400
to the residence or wherever we're were 
were these,

1659
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:57,401
uh,
these nefarious dudes or staying and 

1660
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:57,401
then tortured and raped them and killed 
them.

1661
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,670
And then through their bodies in a trap 
and a dumpster.

1662
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:03,970
Okay.
So it wasn't even enough to just take 

1663
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:03,970
someone's car,
their possessions and belongings,

1664
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:08,951
but took like this boyfriend,
girlfriend and fucking mutilated them 

1665
01:10:08,951 --> 01:10:09,440
and did horrible shit to him and then 
kill them.

1666
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,500
And uh,
you're like,

1667
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:16,530
well it can.
That's just the thing is that you don't 

1668
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:16,530
know what somebody who has ill intent 
for you is,

1669
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:21,010
it really has up to do.
So I've had people talk to me about 

1670
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:21,010
like,
oh,

1671
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:21,590
what happens if he pulls a gun on you?

1672
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:23,120
I'm like,
like give them what they want,

1673
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:28,121
you know what I mean?
I'm not trying to to bargain my life 

1674
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:30,860
versus a bullet over a wallet with some 
money in it or whatever.

1675
01:10:30,861 --> 01:10:35,861
Like that's just not that important.
But I also think in my head like you 

1676
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:39,560
have to assess a situation and it might 
become absolutely clear that I'm,

1677
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:41,960
this guy might not have any intention of
letting me go.

1678
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:44,270
There's a lot of that in the world or 
you know,

1679
01:10:44,271 --> 01:10:45,740
if someone pulls a knife on me,
I'm like,

1680
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:46,790
I got,
I hope never.

1681
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:49,700
And I like why I go because if someone 
pulls a knife on me,

1682
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:51,380
I'm going to murder them.
If I have to.

1683
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:55,280
Like I'm not going to stop until he's 
dead because he's got a fucking knife.

1684
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,980
I don't know where his friends are.
I don't know anything about what's going

1685
01:10:57,981 --> 01:11:02,981
on.
All I know is it the minutes a weapon 

1686
01:11:02,981 --> 01:11:02,981
gets pulled on my person.
They intend for me to die.

1687
01:11:02,981 --> 01:11:05,300
Whether they actually don't have the 
guts to go through with it or not,

1688
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:07,250
or maybe that just they just want my 
belongings.

1689
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:10,760
I don't know that shit.
I can't read minds.

1690
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:13,470
I just know someone wants to cut and 
like kill me to my shit.

1691
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:18,740
I think there's a real,
there's a mindset that a lot of people 

1692
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,310
have where if you concentrate on things 
like that,

1693
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:25,340
you could sort of manifest it and if you
spend all your time worrying about 

1694
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:28,731
people attacking you,
then you know you're going to invite 

1695
01:11:28,731 --> 01:11:31,701
that shit into your life.
There's a lot of people that really 

1696
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:31,701
believe that and they also believe that,
you know,

1697
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:36,240
really the,
the evolved way to be is to just never,

1698
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,150
never get into any sort of an 
altercation with anybody and try to keep

1699
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:42,660
society as civil as possible and as many
last as possible.

1700
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,060
Yeah,
I see their point of view.

1701
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:50,210
But uh,
the real problem is the randomness of 

1702
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:50,210
life.

1703
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:50,920
Oh,
I see their point of view too,

1704
01:11:50,921 --> 01:11:55,000
but I think it's pretty obvious where 
that type of concept goes.

1705
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:56,330
I mean,
it's like killed.

1706
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:57,520
Well,
you can get,

1707
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:02,690
not only can you get killed,
but now all of a sudden you take away 

1708
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,981
the ability to be the kind of any kind 
of per person than any individual that 

1709
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:07,910
you want to be.
All of a sudden you become some you can.

1710
01:12:07,911 --> 01:12:09,760
Part of this.
I'm fucked up and ran novel.

1711
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:12,130
We can't even use the word I anymore.
You know?

1712
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:13,330
It's like,
whoa.

1713
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,030
That's why would you want to.
That's yeah,

1714
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:17,770
it may be peaceful,
but how is that?

1715
01:12:17,771 --> 01:12:21,960
That's a repression of of the human 
spirit and and like that.

1716
01:12:21,961 --> 01:12:23,590
There's no growth in that.

1717
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,490
Well,
not only that,

1718
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:29,550
you're allowing,
you're doing a shitty job of preserving 

1719
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,760
your own excellent genetics by allowing 
some cut bag to take you out.

1720
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:33,400
Of course,
when you intellectually,

1721
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:38,401
you have made a decision early in your 
life to prepare for something like this 

1722
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:41,970
so that if something goes down,
you're not physically completely inapt 

1723
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:43,150
and you get to decide whether or not you
get injured or not,

1724
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:48,210
and if somebody goes to do you bodily 
harm and they don't understand that 

1725
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:48,210
you're a trained killer,
boom,

1726
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:53,310
you survive and they don't.
Whereas another person in the same 

1727
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:53,530
situation,
you could think you're smart all day,

1728
01:12:53,531 --> 01:12:54,930
but now you're dead.
Okay.

1729
01:12:55,390 --> 01:13:00,390
Smart enough to fucking stop from 
getting your ass pummeled to death on 

1730
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,520
the street.
And the thing is,

1731
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:04,660
it could be as simple as a home dude 
from a nxs right?

1732
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:08,070
He a guy jerking off.
No,

1733
01:13:08,071 --> 01:13:08,440
no,
no

1734
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,100
guy.
That guy died jerking off.

1735
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:11,990
No,
he got it from Nsx in excess.

1736
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,220
He killed himself.
You know,

1737
01:13:13,221 --> 01:13:14,120
he,
he died.

1738
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:17,840
It was auto erotic association is one of
a slew.

1739
01:13:17,841 --> 01:13:18,770
Trust me,
I'm a God damn.

1740
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,460
Okay.
Well that may be so,

1741
01:13:20,461 --> 01:13:22,430
but up leading up to that point,
uh,

1742
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:27,770
he was drunk as fuck apparently.
And got an altercation with somebody 

1743
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:31,311
you've got shoved and he fell and he has
head on a curb and the repercussions 

1744
01:13:31,311 --> 01:13:35,690
from that was a,
he received brain damage to where he 

1745
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:37,740
couldn't smell or taste anymore really?
And it drove him nuts.

1746
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,760
Oh my God.
Himself.

1747
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:44,870
But that was just simply falling down,
hitting his head and he could hit his 

1748
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:45,900
head on the curb like 50 times.
And who knows how it could turn out,

1749
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:47,730
you know,
it could have burned him right there and

1750
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:52,731
killed him or taken done.
Just given them a crack and needed some 

1751
01:13:52,731 --> 01:13:55,380
stitches.
It could be just a big goose egg.

1752
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:58,180
How long did it last forum?
Like A.

1753
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,480
I think it was a permanent thing for how
many years?

1754
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:01,440
I don't know.
I don't know,

1755
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:06,441
but I believe it was a permanent thing,
like it wasn't coming back so he 

1756
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:09,150
couldn't taste anything.
Taste or smell Jesus Christ.

1757
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,710
How would you know?
Like what policies?

1758
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,050
Miles.

1759
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:16,180
That was actually what was described to 
me as part of the huge issue was that he

1760
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:16,430
loved

1761
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:18,740
how much you can never taste a woman 
ever again.

1762
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:25,210
Yeah.
I mean that's a horrible fucking thing 

1763
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,861
to think of,
but that's also to show you that you 

1764
01:14:26,861 --> 01:14:26,861
know,
the randomness you could fall off,

1765
01:14:26,861 --> 01:14:27,990
you could fall from,
you know,

1766
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,510
10,000
feet in the air and you're shooting wide

1767
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:34,511
open balance.
Break every bone in your body and live 

1768
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:34,511
through it.
I mean fuck.

1769
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:35,810
The human body is pretty amazing what it
can go through.

1770
01:14:35,811 --> 01:14:38,230
I mean,
I should be some sort of a,

1771
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:43,240
um,
a example of that as a fighter of 15 

1772
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,930
years and all the fucking Shit I've been
through and yet I'm a walking,

1773
01:14:44,931 --> 01:14:49,931
talking,
moving capable human being still and 

1774
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:53,231
being physically fit does help with that
and all my flight training and the few 

1775
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:54,220
accidents I've ever been in where people
have hit me in,

1776
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:57,650
my car's a,
all that training,

1777
01:14:57,651 --> 01:15:00,110
all that sparring,
all that time spent in the gym and being

1778
01:15:00,111 --> 01:15:01,030
in those,
you know,

1779
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:01,890
those,
uh,

1780
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,370
fight or flight scenario isn't that high
intensity shit.

1781
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:08,030
The whole world slows down to me and I'm
completely cognizant,

1782
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:13,060
aware and capable where I know if you 
were a person that did not train and 

1783
01:15:14,031 --> 01:15:17,600
hone your focus and your physicality and
your mental fortitude,

1784
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,060
you just fucking,
you.

1785
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:22,430
But I don't know what happened either 
and they just flip out and they wouldn't

1786
01:15:22,431 --> 01:15:25,370
be able to be cognizant or aware in that
moment at all.

1787
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,700
It says that he was found dead.
He committed suicide apparently.

1788
01:15:29,701 --> 01:15:30,620
Yeah,
I'm,

1789
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:35,720
I'm wrong.
I thought he was an autoerotic 

1790
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:35,720
appreciation guy and he's really big on 
your,

1791
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,041
uh,
on your choking and jerking off and I 

1792
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:40,041
don't know why.
That's my thing.

1793
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:40,041
Um,
there was a.

1794
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:44,500
I know,
I apologize to the family of Mr 

1795
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,110
Hutchings.
I thought he said it had been suggested,

1796
01:15:46,111 --> 01:15:51,111
but there was no evidence that found it.
Maybe it was one of those like Richard 

1797
01:15:51,111 --> 01:15:53,010
Gere Journal warrant rumor thing.
Just some spreading through.

1798
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,020
Have you ever double up your ass?
No.

1799
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:55,290
No,
no,

1800
01:15:55,291 --> 01:16:00,291
no.
Jesus shutting yourself off when you 

1801
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:00,291
jerk off with a job up here.
No,

1802
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:01,770
I don't need to.
I don't need to truck myself off while I

1803
01:16:01,771 --> 01:16:03,650
beat off.
I'm fine with regular feeding.

1804
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:06,210
Regular bed.
It's always worked well for me.

1805
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,830
It's quite,
quite satisfied.

1806
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:08,390
Yeah.
I,

1807
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,740
I'm pretty happy with it myself.
I'm a big fan.

1808
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:15,770
I don't,
I really don't find any need to improve 

1809
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:17,631
it.
It's like when girls started putting 

1810
01:16:17,631 --> 01:16:17,631
like tongue rings in.
Oh,

1811
01:16:17,631 --> 01:16:17,631
it helps when you give him blow jobs,
guess what?

1812
01:16:17,631 --> 01:16:19,230
It doesn't really help.
It's just a new thing.

1813
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:21,420
The only thing that make it maybe in 
your mind,

1814
01:16:21,421 --> 01:16:22,080
it's like,
oh,

1815
01:16:22,081 --> 01:16:24,570
she's sucking my cock with like this 
weird piece of jewelry.

1816
01:16:24,571 --> 01:16:27,450
Like I had a couple girls that have had 
pierce pussies and like

1817
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,290
on any better.
No.

1818
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:34,360
The weird thing about the peers tongue 
is they're letting you know that down 

1819
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:34,760
the sucks cock.
That's like in a way.

1820
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:35,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

1821
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,440
That's a green light.
Any girl who lives in 10 years time and 

1822
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:43,241
doesn't suck,
there's a target to shoot some loads 

1823
01:16:43,241 --> 01:16:43,241
down to fuck.
Awesome.

1824
01:16:43,241 --> 01:16:47,000
Are the cereal bowl.
Girls don't have stamps if they're not 

1825
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,481
down to fuck.
I mean if a girl does not like sex just 

1826
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:49,481
to put a goddamn target on her lower 
back.

1827
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:50,870
Right?
And if a girl doesn't like giving head,

1828
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:52,690
she doesn't walk around with a barbell 
in her mouth.

1829
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:54,740
Uh,
yeah.

1830
01:16:54,741 --> 01:16:56,570
That's what you're thinking about 
shooting loads on that thing.

1831
01:16:56,571 --> 01:16:57,710
You know what you're doing.
You dirty bitch.

1832
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:59,870
You know what you're trying to do.
God Damn it.

1833
01:16:59,871 --> 01:17:02,060
Don't pretend any girl who has a tongue 
ring.

1834
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:06,500
Give head is an asshole.
If you're a girl,

1835
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,790
you have a ton.
Or if you're a guy,

1836
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:12,791
if you're a guy,
you don't give her head with the time 

1837
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:12,791
you

1838
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:12,860
think about that.
If you're a guy with a tongue ring,

1839
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:14,690
you don't eat pussy,
you can go fuck yourself.

1840
01:17:14,691 --> 01:17:18,140
How about that silly bitch pussy 
anyways,

1841
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:20,390
you're a pretty horrible person.
Signs,

1842
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:22,580
there's a reason why it smells bad.
Okay?

1843
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:27,581
That's nature.
Telling you to get the fuck out of 

1844
01:17:27,581 --> 01:17:27,581
there.
You're not the only one is using this,

1845
01:17:27,581 --> 01:17:31,110
this watering hole.
It's a battle of loads going on inside 

1846
01:17:31,431 --> 01:17:34,370
that snatch right now.
There is no way to cleanse this thing,

1847
01:17:34,371 --> 01:17:36,740
right?
This is a bad news deal.

1848
01:17:36,741 --> 01:17:39,290
You need to get out of there.
Isn't it funny that that smell?

1849
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:43,760
It's the smell of shit and the smell of 
dirty pussy,

1850
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:45,380
man,
that's debatable.

1851
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,610
I'll tell you a yeast infection smell is
just as bad or worse.

1852
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:54,630
Shin shit sharp and and it's like this 
sort of gets on your tongue is even if 

1853
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:55,350
you don't eat it,
you're just like,

1854
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,560
oh I want to fleet.

1855
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,720
Whereas Shit makes you want to clean it 
up.

1856
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,000
You know?
If you smell shit you like Jay,

1857
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:03,860
you smelled dirty.
You don't want to clean it up,

1858
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:08,861
you just want it to be gone.
I spray with Lysol and kick it out the 

1859
01:18:08,861 --> 01:18:12,101
door.
You never gone down on a girl and you 

1860
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:12,101
smell her dirty ass hole.
Some girls,

1861
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:15,870
they don't use baby wipes.
They wipe their ass with paper towels 

1862
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:16,400
and shift.
It's a terrible,

1863
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:21,430
terrible thing where you're trying to 
concentrate on eating pussy and you 

1864
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:22,490
smell the asshole next door.
Just stinking up the box,

1865
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:25,880
but you don't want to give up because 
her pussy doesn't smell bad.

1866
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:30,881
It's just a smell shit.
You just want to clean her up so you 

1867
01:18:30,881 --> 01:18:30,881
know,
you just,

1868
01:18:30,881 --> 01:18:33,641
he's just take a little bit of the uh,
the sheets and just kind of roll it up 

1869
01:18:33,641 --> 01:18:33,641
on top.

1870
01:18:33,641 --> 01:18:35,270
A little handover it a little palm.
Actually.

1871
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:36,590
Blogging.
By the way,

1872
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:38,810
this is the moment when we lost all of 
our female listeners.

1873
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,760
I'm sorry if you're hanging in there.
God bless you.

1874
01:18:40,761 --> 01:18:45,761
Want to turn the ship around?
We're going to bring it back to here 

1875
01:18:45,761 --> 01:18:45,761
that we're talking about.
The ast may stink.

1876
01:18:45,761 --> 01:18:49,751
Alright?
You want to use the Brillo pad on it 

1877
01:18:49,751 --> 01:18:49,751
instead of something proper.
And here,

1878
01:18:49,751 --> 01:18:53,620
look,
I'm still down there trying to do our 

1879
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:55,601
job.
I'm trying to get to the bottom of that 

1880
01:18:55,601 --> 01:18:55,601
horrific smell.
Like the.

1881
01:18:55,601 --> 01:19:00,500
I know women get uncomfortable,
but the subject I've had girls I get 

1882
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:00,910
really mad at me for even broaching the 
subject line.

1883
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:06,230
It's like a rotten squid,
like rolled in a pile of six month old.

1884
01:19:06,231 --> 01:19:07,520
Catch it.
And then by the way,

1885
01:19:07,521 --> 01:19:10,040
I'm not talking about talking about the 
woman who has the.

1886
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,020
I would never do that.
I'm not rude.

1887
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:13,760
I mean I'd probably let you know you got
a little issue,

1888
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:16,120
but I wouldn't be like really graphic.
You've got to be cool about it.

1889
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:18,950
Like fucking fun up.
Weird Shit.

1890
01:19:18,951 --> 01:19:20,330
The best thing you can do is like,
look,

1891
01:19:20,331 --> 01:19:23,810
if there's like some sort of a bv thing 
going on or anything like that.

1892
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:25,020
Be a fucking cool dude.
Please.

1893
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:30,230
Okay.
You're fucking a girl in the ass and 

1894
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:30,230
there's a little poop.
All right,

1895
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:30,320
I'll tell him,
don't flip out about it.

1896
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:32,660
Go in the shower and then get back to it
and you know what?

1897
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:33,590
And then,
you know,

1898
01:19:33,591 --> 01:19:35,150
probably this chick's gonna be like,
Oh my God.

1899
01:19:35,151 --> 01:19:37,700
I'm like,
I don't give her a hug and be like,

1900
01:19:37,701 --> 01:19:38,810
fuck that.
Who Cares?

1901
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,450
The other girl look it up.
Yeah,

1902
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:41,390
exactly.
Other girl.

1903
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,150
Brian,
you rolling like you bring it across the

1904
01:19:44,151 --> 01:19:44,450
room.

1905
01:19:45,050 --> 01:19:45,780
Yeah.
You know,

1906
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:48,110
if you're an artist you can make a 
painting out of it.

1907
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:53,140
But even if you were talking about the 
subject of Stinky vaginas with a girl 

1908
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,820
who's vagina doesn't sink,
nobody likes desktop.

1909
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:56,810
They'll be like,
stop.

1910
01:19:56,870 --> 01:20:01,870
Stop.
It's like you're bringing up candyman 

1911
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:02,350
and you're saying his name twice.
Somehow.

1912
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,720
Tony Todd's going to come flying out of 
her vagina.

1913
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,220
Look,
what's that weird thing?

1914
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:09,960
It's everywhere.
It's nature.

1915
01:20:09,961 --> 01:20:13,590
Literally telling you to get away.
Like the smell of like a yeast infection

1916
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:15,030
is like,
it's repulsive.

1917
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,720
It's making you fully like.
It literally makes you fat,

1918
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:21,030
doesn't then the Kurds coming out.
Are you using that?

1919
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:22,770
How dare you?
I dare.

1920
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:25,370
Yeah.
What is that?

1921
01:20:25,371 --> 01:20:30,371
Think of that with peaches on it.
How come sometimes that cheesy stuff 

1922
01:20:30,371 --> 01:20:30,371
doesn't smell bad at all.
You don't even care like some.

1923
01:20:30,371 --> 01:20:33,740
Sometimes girls just get overly Horny 
and they start producing yogurt.

1924
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:37,260
Yeah.
I think it's the beginning of or the end

1925
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,310
of one.
Is that what it is?

1926
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,870
Well,
there's also that cream.

1927
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:42,230
Some girls have that creamy white stuff 
that they.

1928
01:20:42,231 --> 01:20:42,960
They start,
you know,

1929
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:46,200
some more than other than it's a,
it's a fucking potent man.

1930
01:20:46,201 --> 01:20:47,070
It's,
it's a serious.

1931
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:50,010
It's like eating flog raw kind of a 
girl.

1932
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:53,460
I dated when I was a young girl,
a day when I was a teenager would get so

1933
01:20:53,461 --> 01:20:56,010
wet it would run down her leg.
Oh yes.

1934
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,040
Like literally.
Oh yeah.

1935
01:20:57,110 --> 01:21:02,110
I mean all the way down a few of them 
below her knee starts bubbling and you 

1936
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:02,640
know,
yeah.

1937
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,780
It didn't even make any sense.

1938
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,390
I'm like,
what the fuck is going on?

1939
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,370
She would just.
And it was all pussy lube,

1940
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,540
like everything will be all slippery.
She was just fucking going and you know,

1941
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,570
there is a thing about,
there's a problem with a,

1942
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,810
not a problem,
but just one thing you have to take into

1943
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:20,811
account or you get the.
I've had a few girls that just crazy 

1944
01:21:20,811 --> 01:21:24,261
wetness.
I like to think it's all attributed to 

1945
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:24,261
me,
but I'm such A.

1946
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:25,160
I'm such a fucking manly stud,
stead,

1947
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:26,010
Meister,
you know,

1948
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:31,050
I,
I've put my hands on them the way I 

1949
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:31,050
like,
kicked the cat out of the way.

1950
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:35,580
We're working on the bed.
That's important sometimes for girls 

1951
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:35,580
fucking throw the animals out of the 
room,

1952
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:38,640
but it can get to the point where it's 
so wet.

1953
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,380
You gotta you just gotTa wipe away,
man.

1954
01:21:40,381 --> 01:21:43,560
You gotta you gotta clean off and keep 
going because you can't feel anything.

1955
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:48,240
It's just like girls that just goes 
overboard.

1956
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:51,240
But fortunately I have a gigantic cox so
that's not an issue.

1957
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:52,590
Oh perfect.
So it's tight.

1958
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:54,650
It just fucking just stretches that 
whole St.

1959
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:57,180
they should drink pedialyte so they 
don't,

1960
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:58,000
you know,
dehydrated.

1961
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:02,990
So I was thinking to myself because I 
thought when I don't have a gigantic car

1962
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:06,240
in the interest of full disclosure,
I don't want a lot of the people,

1963
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,820
but when we're going to come up to you 
at a show and be like,

1964
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,290
Joe,
let me see how big your cock is.

1965
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,570
Like it was just when I was dating this 
girl.

1966
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:15,540
Obviously I didn't know any better.
I was only like 18,

1967
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:17,940
19 years old.
I didn't know that everybody wasn't like

1968
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:20,040
that.
I didn't know that one day.

1969
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:21,690
You know,
like a lot of like young girls,

1970
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,390
they get really wet,
but then you get older and you realize,

1971
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:25,320
oh wait a minute.

1972
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,600
That was like his wet as a girl ever got
ever.

1973
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:28,860
And they're like,
oh,

1974
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:33,861
well that was our prime.
Like her baby making prime was when she 

1975
01:22:33,861 --> 01:22:34,050
was 16,
17.

1976
01:22:34,051 --> 01:22:37,500
Maybe she just had less hangups with 
women.

1977
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,260
Then it's all about the brain.
Like if they don't want to come,

1978
01:22:40,261 --> 01:22:43,020
they ain't coming.
Some girls can't come right now.

1979
01:22:43,021 --> 01:22:45,810
There's that,
which is a tragedy because they,

1980
01:22:45,811 --> 01:22:47,910
they should uh,
you know,

1981
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:48,760
have that out.
I mean,

1982
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:51,870
it's up to them and you've got girls 
will say to you,

1983
01:22:51,871 --> 01:22:52,590
no,
fuck you,

1984
01:22:52,591 --> 01:22:54,210
you didn't,
you didn't make her calm.

1985
01:22:54,211 --> 01:22:55,890
She can come.
You just can't make her kind of like,

1986
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:57,840
trust me.
There's some,

1987
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:00,390
there's some girls that were technical 
difficulty or something,

1988
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:02,460
you know,
you don't put it out right.

1989
01:23:02,461 --> 01:23:04,710
But honestly,
like a lot of times it's really.

1990
01:23:04,711 --> 01:23:05,920
And you know,
if she's not

1991
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,770
comfortable at 100 percent,
she's not where she needs to be,

1992
01:23:08,771 --> 01:23:13,771
or even if she's not comfortable with 
her body enough to know how to make 

1993
01:23:13,771 --> 01:23:14,090
herself call sensitive,
you know,

1994
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:17,410
I get in there.
How you doing?

1995
01:23:17,411 --> 01:23:19,060
Do you want me to release these 
medicals?

1996
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:24,070
Are they too tight?
You want me to let you out of the 

1997
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,070
basement,
Joshua?

1998
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:25,870
It's like the Grad data in high school.
I could fit so easily.

1999
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:27,640
Every thought,
every girl you could fit.

2000
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:32,740
Every girl was festival when your hands 
were little back then you were just 

2001
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:32,740
growing up.
If I can,

2002
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,560
if I can at least karate chop.
I'm a little bit and I'm good to go.

2003
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,220
Well,
it's,

2004
01:23:36,221 --> 01:23:38,650
it's funny how one girl respond to one 
thing.

2005
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,920
Then you try that on another girl in the
fucking angry.

2006
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:41,800
Well,
you know what I get.

2007
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:43,390
Okay.
How about some uniformity?

2008
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,810
Here's something now I'm.

2009
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:46,360
Maybe this would make sense or not,
but.

2010
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:47,820
So I,
I,

2011
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,750
I was in a relationship for almost eight
years now.

2012
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:50,890
I'm super loyal,
dude.

2013
01:23:50,891 --> 01:23:52,420
Don't fuck around.
Don't play around.

2014
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:54,220
That's my thing.
When I'm in one,

2015
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:55,030
I'm in one,
when I'm not,

2016
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:56,600
I'm not.
And uh,

2017
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,350
I became newly single and so,
uh,

2018
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,250
you know,
first off I get to do at the time,

2019
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,510
at the time,
do,

2020
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:05,200
do,
do,

2021
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:07,480
do,
do that newly single.

2022
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:08,530
And so,
uh,

2023
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:13,560
first thing I'm going on,
I'm trying to go out on the town every 

2024
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:13,560
and uh,
you know,

2025
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:13,560
people are like,
oh,

2026
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,420
especially the chicks that you'd run 
into rob.

2027
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:18,640
You just have groupies everywhere.
He just fucking everything all the time.

2028
01:24:18,641 --> 01:24:19,870
We just got all porn.
I go,

2029
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:20,890
yeah,
actually,

2030
01:24:20,891 --> 01:24:25,891
in a way,
I've got tons of groupies straight men 

2031
01:24:25,891 --> 01:24:28,650
who form a barrier around me buying me 
all the fucking drinks I want by me all 

2032
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:30,520
the shots wanting to feel like pushing 
girls out of the way.

2033
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,550
I can't get a single piece of pussy 
because they can't get through that wall

2034
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:36,400
of caulk that surrounding me.
And so,

2035
01:24:36,401 --> 01:24:37,620
uh,
and,

2036
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,150
and every girl was like mine every year,
lying yourself,

2037
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:40,900
Holy Shit.
Like,

2038
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:42,650
you're just such a playboy.
I'm like,

2039
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:47,560
okay.
So,

2040
01:24:47,561 --> 01:24:48,730
uh,
so at any point,

2041
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:53,760
uh,
I finally start finding a few gals that 

2042
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:53,760
are,
they're down to like,

2043
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,300
they're cool.
They read books,

2044
01:24:55,301 --> 01:24:56,380
go for coffee,
right?

2045
01:24:56,381 --> 01:25:01,381
Yeah.
We're chilling or we're talking about 

2046
01:25:01,381 --> 01:25:02,760
the new operating system on our,
our Max Roller Ball that the dog catcher

2047
01:25:02,761 --> 01:25:04,330
and bring it back.
Absolutely.

2048
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:09,450
Um,
and so I find some chicks that are cool 

2049
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:13,080
and respectable.
They're not assholes or whatever and 

2050
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:13,080
we're were,
all right,

2051
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:13,080
cool,
let's,

2052
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,860
we'll fucking hang out.
And all of a sudden I get,

2053
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:18,340
start getting all these girls and want 
physicality.

2054
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:19,890
Like,
Oh yeah,

2055
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,730
held up,
whacked around,

2056
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:24,610
smacked around,
fucking thrown all over the place,

2057
01:25:24,611 --> 01:25:26,830
Aka my ex girlfriend.
And I'm like,

2058
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:29,470
I started to think for,
I'm talking to my buddies.

2059
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:34,480
I'm like,
is it because I'm a big physical dude 

2060
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,691
now I'm a fighter.
Like I don't think they're this way 

2061
01:25:36,691 --> 01:25:36,691
necessarily with everybody,
like,

2062
01:25:36,691 --> 01:25:37,180
and they want me to do shit.
Never done.

2063
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:41,540
And of course I'm more than willing to 
oblige.

2064
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:42,350
Well,
you have to,

2065
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:44,240
but do you do judge them?
Know,

2066
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,680
you know?
Well,

2067
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:47,060
I mean every,
every,

2068
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:52,300
every person is different and you can 
definitely tell the difference between 

2069
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:52,300
ones where there's like,
okay,

2070
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:54,040
there's some psychological fucking 
issues going on here and some that just,

2071
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:59,110
they see me as the facilitator of a,
of an open fucking apparently Aka the 

2072
01:26:00,351 --> 01:26:01,910
good ones I guess.
Yeah.

2073
01:26:01,911 --> 01:26:03,330
Those are the ones that are guilt.
No,

2074
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:08,340
no.
I've had plenty of chicks that liked 

2075
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:09,950
getting the shit ragdoll out of them,
but we're awesome.

2076
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,470
SMART,
normal mean.

2077
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:17,490
Just good people like they're red and 
their bedroom habits don't necessarily 

2078
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:19,580
aren't always an indication of what 
somebody is as a person.

2079
01:26:19,581 --> 01:26:24,581
That's always like one of my big issues.
Why people are always being such 

2080
01:26:24,581 --> 01:26:27,200
assholes about gay people.
It's like I don't give a fuck what he or

2081
01:26:27,201 --> 01:26:29,090
her does.
If they're gay at all,

2082
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,070
like how has that?
That's not.

2083
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:36,160
They are a amalgamation of all these 
different things and who they fuck is 

2084
01:26:36,651 --> 01:26:38,360
only one small part of it.
Yeah.

2085
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,090
It's okay.

2086
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:40,880
It's an.
It's a dumb person's argument.

2087
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:46,030
Either dumb or my joke is you the dumb 
or you secretly worried that dicks are 

2088
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:46,490
delicious.
Those are the only two reasons why you'd

2089
01:26:46,491 --> 01:26:47,330
be upset.
Well,

2090
01:26:47,331 --> 01:26:51,350
my Dick seems to be very delicious as 
far as how flexible are you,

2091
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:52,340
John?
Well,

2092
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:55,370
I can't rubber guard so I have to still 
keep finding these chicks,

2093
01:26:55,371 --> 01:26:58,370
but I've been told by the time my 
dictates famous,

2094
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:02,290
I had been told that famous,
that you're dictates famous w,

2095
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:03,500
w.
What else did he tell you?

2096
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:14,330
My now where people are getting so super
angry because the sound levels are not 

2097
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:14,330
equalized.

2098
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,410
Hey,
what can we do to do this?

2099
01:27:16,411 --> 01:27:17,820
There's something we can do about that,
Brian,

2100
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:19,350
because people are constantly 
complaining,

2101
01:27:19,351 --> 01:27:24,351
but they're always complaining that this
out of 1 million people that listen to 

2102
01:27:24,351 --> 01:27:27,841
it,
there's always going to be two people 

2103
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:27,841
that tweet you but the sound,
but apparently there are large spikes.

2104
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:30,260
If you have something you're always 
going to have,

2105
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:31,800
you're always going to have large 
spikes.

2106
01:27:31,801 --> 01:27:33,320
It's if you have certain people like 
joey ideas.

2107
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:37,040
Where's that Josh Barnett fucking Viking
Shit going on here.

2108
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:38,300
Well,
you know,

2109
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:43,350
here's the thing,
like a and anybody that's completely 

2110
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:47,271
cool and love something,
they often don't say a fucking thing 

2111
01:27:47,271 --> 01:27:50,210
right?
Anybody that wants to be a negative 

2112
01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:52,220
piece of shit like go out there and 
spoil it for everyone and just shit all 

2113
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,400
over the world with all their negative 
garbage bullshit.

2114
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:58,200
They want to talk the most people with 
the least to say want to be heard them.

2115
01:27:58,201 --> 01:27:58,320
Okay.

2116
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:01,220
So there's a little bit,
but there also is a lot of.

2117
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:05,360
I learned a lot from the criticism that 
I'm not applying that with a broad brush

2118
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:06,430
across.
I know I'm just,

2119
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:11,440
I'm just saying I need to qualify myself
because I don't want people to think a 

2120
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:15,280
lot.
A lot of the shit that people have said 

2121
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:17,741
to us about the show and me as a standup
and me as a commentator and it means a 

2122
01:28:17,741 --> 01:28:20,020
comedian I said that are sort of twice.
Um,

2123
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:22,640
I've learned a lot from douche bags.
Like it's,

2124
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:25,250
it seems like you wouldn't because 
they're there being county,

2125
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:26,180
but then you got to say,
well,

2126
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,390
if they even have a point,
like even a tiny point,

2127
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:32,390
they can say something and then all you 
have to do is figure out what that thing

2128
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:35,540
is and take that away.
Like if you have a fix that weakness,

2129
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:36,880
now they can't say shit.
Sure.

2130
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:41,950
If they do say Shit,
well then it doesn't mean anything 

2131
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:41,950
anymore.
It only means something.

2132
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:42,920
If you really feel like there's some 
merit to what they're saying,

2133
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:46,180
some of the dumbest,
just most asinine trite that gets thrown

2134
01:28:46,181 --> 01:28:49,930
at you.
It's not always easy to do,

2135
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:54,960
but you realize,
I mean it is possible to learn in some 

2136
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:59,551
way from all of this shit.
Sometimes it isn't anything learning 

2137
01:28:59,551 --> 01:29:02,911
necessarily directly about you,
but this could be by seeing what this 

2138
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:07,821
person is doing,
being on the receiving end of these 

2139
01:29:07,821 --> 01:29:07,821
things and you can look back and you can
think about,

2140
01:29:07,821 --> 01:29:11,901
well,
how have I done anything remotely like 

2141
01:29:11,901 --> 01:29:11,901
that in my own life?
How?

2142
01:29:11,901 --> 01:29:16,550
How have I ever acted in such a way that
is on that same level of like just 

2143
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:24,410
shittiness this guy is doing to me?
Or why is it that people or are are know

2144
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,160
exerting this kind of terrible attitude.
You know,

2145
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:29,400
via that anonymity.
I mean,

2146
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:34,401
there's so many things that your brain 
can go to where it's an opportunity for 

2147
01:29:34,401 --> 01:29:37,350
you to to expand upon who you are as a 
person.

2148
01:29:37,351 --> 01:29:39,720
There is something to take from it.
I'm not saying it's going to change your

2149
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:42,450
life,
but I mean even some of the dumbest,

2150
01:29:42,451 --> 01:29:47,451
worst shit that's ever come my way and 
sometimes I just get good material out 

2151
01:29:47,451 --> 01:29:50,211
of it.
I just fucking started ripping on 

2152
01:29:50,211 --> 01:29:50,211
people,
whatever,

2153
01:29:50,211 --> 01:29:50,211
and it's hilarious and it's still serve 
me a purpose.

2154
01:29:50,211 --> 01:29:51,180
I still got something out of it

2155
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:56,220
and it definitely does broaden your 
understanding of the possibility of 

2156
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:59,800
human behavior and you learn a lot about
like why people act the way they act.

2157
01:29:59,801 --> 01:30:04,801
And here's the big one.
Haters like people who are really 

2158
01:30:04,801 --> 01:30:08,260
douchey or all failures,
it's 100 percent across the board.

2159
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:12,400
No one who is truly brilliant at 
anything is a hater.

2160
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:16,000
They're just not.
They might be a few jealous like sports.

2161
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:18,480
They are a hater.
They're not going to go out publicly and

2162
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:19,050
I hate her.

2163
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:24,150
Well yeah,
and I mean to be truly excellent at 

2164
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:24,400
something,
you have to be concentrating on yourself

2165
01:30:24,401 --> 01:30:28,060
and positive shit and you can't be 
worrying about shooting somebody down or

2166
01:30:28,061 --> 01:30:31,600
chipping too many down.
So like you are taking the opinions,

2167
01:30:31,601 --> 01:30:36,601
like if you're one of those guys that 
gets in battles with haters a lot of 

2168
01:30:36,601 --> 01:30:36,601
time online,
you know,

2169
01:30:36,601 --> 01:30:40,261
you could do it for fun if you want to,
but what you're doing essentially is 

2170
01:30:40,261 --> 01:30:42,931
you're arguing with like some of the 
biggest failures as a human being that 

2171
01:30:42,931 --> 01:30:42,931
exists usually

2172
01:30:42,931 --> 01:30:44,070
person that's like,
I mean,

2173
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:44,630
you know,
uh,

2174
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:49,680
I'm gonna,
I'm just gonna drop out of high school 

2175
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:49,680
and get my ged and graduated early.

2176
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,830
That person,
that's if you're lucky.

2177
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,870
You know what I mean?
But even if they have a job somewhere,

2178
01:30:52,871 --> 01:30:54,140
it doesn't matter.
It's like you're,

2179
01:30:54,141 --> 01:30:57,220
you're socially unsuccessful.
Like there was that guy that was,

2180
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,530
he lost his job.
What's his name?

2181
01:30:59,531 --> 01:31:00,700
Brian.
You know what I'm talking about?

2182
01:31:00,701 --> 01:31:04,020
The reddit guy,
he was responsible for like someone like

2183
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:06,880
the most heinous,
fucked up shit on reddit.com.

2184
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:12,110
Like yeah,
like underage girls like suggested 

2185
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:16,300
positions and like some dark shit and it
was like really rude online.

2186
01:31:16,301 --> 01:31:19,030
Well they found out his name,
they went out and they got them and they

2187
01:31:19,031 --> 01:31:24,031
contacted his employer and then they got
the guy fired and then he was on some 

2188
01:31:24,031 --> 01:31:28,051
television show,
sort of defending it saying this is a 

2189
01:31:28,051 --> 01:31:28,470
character that he plays online and that 
it gives them freedom or it's

2190
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,970
too far.
It's bullshit.

2191
01:31:29,971 --> 01:31:34,971
Like you know what,
I don't care if it's a character you 

2192
01:31:34,971 --> 01:31:34,971
even when you're just reading a bunch of
texts,

2193
01:31:34,971 --> 01:31:37,240
like you can't tell who's a fucking 
character or not and,

2194
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:42,410
and there's no way to interpret that 
when Andy Kaufman goes on stage and no 

2195
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:45,990
matter what crazy shit he was doing,
he wasn't out there trying to,

2196
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:50,130
to really fuck up people's lives.
Like you maybe you show up at a show and

2197
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:51,390
he sings,
you know,

2198
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,670
a cartoon theme songs or actually he 
just lip syncs.

2199
01:31:54,671 --> 01:31:56,010
So the whole time,
okay,

2200
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:01,280
you're mad.
You may as you spent your money to go 

2201
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:01,280
see it,
but he didn't ruin your fucking

2202
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,980
life.
He didn't cause you some sort of a 

2203
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:04,980
difficulty.
He didn't do something and it's like,

2204
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:05,740
Fuck Dude,
what?

2205
01:32:05,741 --> 01:32:06,130
That,
you know,

2206
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:09,790
he didn't impact you in such a negative 
way that made you want to kill them.

2207
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:11,630
And there's there,
there used to be a,

2208
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,220
uh,
an mma for them.

2209
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:15,040
The same thing that fight sport.
Oh yeah.

2210
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:16,030
I remember that.
They would just,

2211
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:18,380
everything was just nothing but 
negativity,

2212
01:32:18,381 --> 01:32:19,370
negativity,
negativity,

2213
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:23,110
just horrible as shit.
There'd be people at portraying or maybe

2214
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:27,040
for real,
like a racist personalities.

2215
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:32,041
There'd be people digging up stuff on 
other and just all of it was just to be 

2216
01:32:32,041 --> 01:32:34,540
nothing but to be horrible to each other
and the other fighters and people.

2217
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:35,410
And I'm like,
fuck,

2218
01:32:35,411 --> 01:32:35,930
you know,
why?

2219
01:32:35,931 --> 01:32:37,990
Why live your life that way?
Why spend all that energy?

2220
01:32:37,991 --> 01:32:40,890
And truly at the end of the day you 
haven't gotten anywhere like you,

2221
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,370
you've just been swimming in place.

2222
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:46,810
You haven't improved your life.
You haven't gotten any further along and

2223
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:49,180
trying to accomplish something for 
yourself at all.

2224
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:50,590
Well,
most of them are 12,

2225
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,130
you know,
sad,

2226
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,580
sad,
part of some of those are 30 to 20.

2227
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:57,640
Maybe even 50 and this guy who got 
caught,

2228
01:32:57,641 --> 01:33:00,430
the reddit guy who was a guy who had 
children.

2229
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:01,750
See why,
why would you,

2230
01:33:01,751 --> 01:33:03,340
why spend?
Because there's,

2231
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:05,980
there's clearly,
clearly there's something lacking in his

2232
01:33:05,981 --> 01:33:06,960
life,
uh,

2233
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:12,030
socially somehow that he never came to 
grips with and he's using this anonymity

2234
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:17,850
to do this and it's just that they have 
a voice that didn't exist in the past 

2235
01:33:18,131 --> 01:33:19,900
and in the past they were the person 
that,

2236
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:22,540
you know,
when they would be dealt with socially,

2237
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:25,360
like in a one on one situation,
if they ever said anything,

2238
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:27,430
anything remotely route,
everybody will be like,

2239
01:33:27,431 --> 01:33:28,720
fuck you stupid.
Look at you.

2240
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:29,920
You'd dump fat.
Fuck.

2241
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,900
And they'd be shot down.
It will be over,

2242
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:35,760
but they can lash out at you without any
fields of social repercussions.

2243
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:40,000
Just brought something really that 
really just went off in my head.

2244
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:41,680
All right,
Joe Comedian.

2245
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:46,920
Yes sir.
Comedians throw out heinous shit 

2246
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:50,161
sometimes you know,
but jokes are jokes are jokes and you 

2247
01:33:50,161 --> 01:33:50,161
fucking,
you,

2248
01:33:50,161 --> 01:33:50,161
you,
you,

2249
01:33:50,161 --> 01:33:51,160
you throw as you give out as much as you
got.

2250
01:33:51,161 --> 01:33:54,910
But that's the only way that you can 
throw out as much as you got,

2251
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:57,490
you know,
in terms of being a comedian and pushing

2252
01:33:57,491 --> 01:34:02,491
boundaries and saying crazy shit 
sometimes whatever is because you will 

2253
01:34:02,491 --> 01:34:03,490
need to take as much as you get.
And that's the difference there.

2254
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:08,540
Like,
don't go out there and say some rude 

2255
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:10,771
shit even if you're trying,
even if you're doing the right thing to 

2256
01:34:10,771 --> 01:34:13,891
go out and stand up and say something 
that is against somebody else or some 

2257
01:34:13,891 --> 01:34:18,841
other groups are because even if it's 
the wrong thing that they're doing and 

2258
01:34:18,841 --> 01:34:20,570
you need to stand up as some sort of a,
uh,

2259
01:34:20,610 --> 01:34:23,980
um,
avatar against it because it's the wrong

2260
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:24,670
fucking thing.

2261
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:29,670
It's not good to do.
That means you have to be willing to 

2262
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:30,760
accept every negative thing that's going
to come with that and be okay with that.

2263
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:31,690
And be like,
you know,

2264
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:36,840
to do,
to go out there and stand up for the 

2265
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:36,840
right thing.
Something shitty might come my way.

2266
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:41,551
But this is something that must be done.
And even if in a social scenario of 

2267
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:41,551
your,
oh,

2268
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:41,890
I'm going to where everyone's a pot 
shouting each other,

2269
01:34:41,891 --> 01:34:42,400
you know,
and,

2270
01:34:42,401 --> 01:34:42,880
and,
and it's,

2271
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:45,490
it's fun,
but to say something,

2272
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,770
you know,
to insult somebody else,

2273
01:34:47,771 --> 01:34:52,771
even in a fun and adjust way,
you can't do it if you can't fucking 

2274
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:53,350
take it because we've all known those 
people were all fucking around,

2275
01:34:53,351 --> 01:34:56,380
were saying horrible shit to each other 
and somebody chimes in and,

2276
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:56,750
and,
and,

2277
01:34:56,810 --> 01:35:01,810
and that's what's funny is there's 
always a change in tone when that guy 

2278
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:04,010
does it from everybody's response to 
them because you can,

2279
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:09,011
it's like you can feel the shit that 
they're saying and not being able to 

2280
01:35:09,011 --> 01:35:09,920
take it.
And the place they're coming from,

2281
01:35:09,921 --> 01:35:10,560
it's like,
it,

2282
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:15,570
it could come out their mouth the same,
but there's a different energy and if 

2283
01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:16,460
you turn to them and then you're like,
fuck you,

2284
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:17,930
you piece of shit,
shut the fuck up.

2285
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:19,730
And it changes.
It's like,

2286
01:35:19,731 --> 01:35:21,240
it's different between you and me 
riffing on it.

2287
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,120
Sure.
He's serious.

2288
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:28,121
And it was just joking around with 
everybody else as long as he was 

2289
01:35:28,121 --> 01:35:28,121
involved in the joking.

2290
01:35:28,121 --> 01:35:28,150
But we realized,
but it's like you,

2291
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:31,200
you can read,
you can you realize that when they throw

2292
01:35:31,201 --> 01:35:36,201
out that thing,
they can't take it either and so they 

2293
01:35:36,201 --> 01:35:36,960
shouldn't really be participating 
because there just isn't,

2294
01:35:36,990 --> 01:35:38,070
isn't in the same vein.

2295
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:43,080
Well,
that's what the thing about being able 

2296
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:43,080
to hate on someone,
especially a public person,

2297
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,670
like a Josh Barnett type character,
which is your apparently wonderful to do

2298
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,640
your anonymous because if you're just 
some anonymous person,

2299
01:35:48,641 --> 01:35:52,660
you have no repercussions whatsoever.
You know so much about you.

2300
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:54,790
They know what your look like.
They know the fights you've had.

2301
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:59,800
Like I was watching some battle on 
twitter or whatever the fuck it was.

2302
01:36:00,191 --> 01:36:05,191
I was reading on an mma site was Josh 
Thompson was arguing with this guy and 

2303
01:36:05,191 --> 01:36:07,840
the guy who was bringing up like me and 
my friends,

2304
01:36:07,841 --> 01:36:11,410
we laughed out loud watching you get 
Kayo by Eve's Edwards,

2305
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:14,110
please fight again so we can laugh again
and you get knocked out.

2306
01:36:14,111 --> 01:36:15,810
And I'm,
and I'm why I'm like this.

2307
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:20,811
This piece of shit like that is the 
weakest and move of as a human being to 

2308
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:23,870
go after what you know her to guy.
Well,

2309
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,360
you know,
it was a devastating loss.

2310
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,000
The goal to go after that when you're 
just,

2311
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:30,610
when you haven't done anything yourself,
someone that put it out there.

2312
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:35,710
Yeah,
they expose themselves to all the glory 

2313
01:36:35,710 --> 01:36:38,321
and all the.
All the sadness and difficulty of 

2314
01:36:38,321 --> 01:36:40,520
defeat.
He went and dared to do it and you don't

2315
01:36:40,521 --> 01:36:45,521
dare to do anything besides sit behind 
an anonymous thing and and and really 

2316
01:36:45,521 --> 01:36:46,970
accomplished nothing and try to take 
shots at somebody who went out there and

2317
01:36:46,971 --> 01:36:51,971
tried who were not there.
Try went to excel and put himself in a 

2318
01:36:51,971 --> 01:36:55,541
position where it's precarious and it's 
difficult and there's no guarantees and 

2319
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:59,081
he knew that and he knew that everyone 
would watch it and he and you also know 

2320
01:36:59,081 --> 01:36:59,750
as a fire,
you go out there and you lose.

2321
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:04,960
You're opening yourself up to all of 
that for people to come out there and 

2322
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,430
use that as a weapon against you because
of their shitty a personality.

2323
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:08,180
Yeah,
exactly.

2324
01:37:08,181 --> 01:37:09,860
And so to,
to do that,

2325
01:37:09,861 --> 01:37:14,861
it's fucking,
we of course don't argue with them 

2326
01:37:14,861 --> 01:37:17,051
because they,
no one's paying attention to what the 

2327
01:37:17,051 --> 01:37:17,051
fuck they have to say anyway.
So when you respond,

2328
01:37:17,051 --> 01:37:18,950
you give them exactly what they're 
looking for.

2329
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:19,410
Now.

2330
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:20,450
Important.
Yeah.

2331
01:37:20,451 --> 01:37:21,050
And you know,
I,

2332
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:23,240
I also think that this is not gonna 
last.

2333
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:26,620
I think this is an error in humanity 
that we're going to figure out.

2334
01:37:26,621 --> 01:37:28,440
And I think it's already been too long.
Yeah,

2335
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:29,300
kind of.
I don't.

2336
01:37:29,301 --> 01:37:31,200
I don't know when it's gonna end,
if it does end

2337
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,480
well it sort of already has with this 
reddit guy.

2338
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:34,170
I mean it's,
it's,

2339
01:37:34,171 --> 01:37:36,330
they can track you down,
they can find out who the fuck you are.

2340
01:37:36,331 --> 01:37:38,960
If somebody is decently motivated,
you know,

2341
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:41,490
for guys like you or I or Brian,
you know,

2342
01:37:41,491 --> 01:37:41,810
you,
you,

2343
01:37:41,811 --> 01:37:42,280
you're,
you're,

2344
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:46,110
you get a certain amount of access to 
us.

2345
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:47,250
You know,
you're on twitter,

2346
01:37:47,251 --> 01:37:48,900
you're on facebook,
you know,

2347
01:37:48,901 --> 01:37:51,090
people can write threads on the 
underground,

2348
01:37:51,091 --> 01:37:51,990
you're going to read them,
you know,

2349
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:57,040
there's,
there's a certain amount of access and 

2350
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:57,040
the Brian

2351
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:57,910
though they should be.
Oh yeah,

2352
01:37:57,911 --> 01:37:58,630
absolutely.
Definitely.

2353
01:37:58,631 --> 01:37:59,250
No,
no.

2354
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:02,080
Come on,
there's a certain amount of,

2355
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:03,060
I mean you're,
you're,

2356
01:38:03,061 --> 01:38:08,061
you're gonna,
you're used to it and you can deal with 

2357
01:38:08,061 --> 01:38:08,061
it,
but when it comes on them,

2358
01:38:08,061 --> 01:38:11,400
when all of a sudden their real name is 
exposed and their employer is like,

2359
01:38:11,401 --> 01:38:13,500
all the sudden it's like whoa.
Then they realize like,

2360
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:14,260
look,
you're,

2361
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:15,990
you're in an ever changing game.
Okay,

2362
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:20,991
and this anonymity that might've enjoyed
two years ago really doesn't exist 

2363
01:38:20,991 --> 01:38:24,201
anymore and guess what?
In a year from now and be able to read 

2364
01:38:24,201 --> 01:38:24,201
your thoughts.
Okay,

2365
01:38:24,201 --> 01:38:24,201
so keep it together,

2366
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:29,390
keep it together and taking all this 
stuff from onnit Dotcom that may even 

2367
01:38:29,390 --> 01:38:29,390
come sooner

2368
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:35,110
to be a better person.
You fuckhead and that's what people 

2369
01:38:35,110 --> 01:38:35,110
don't understand.

2370
01:38:35,110 --> 01:38:39,520
They aren't trying to be better people 
and that is what's killing this country 

2371
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,060
as it is people,
the human race period,

2372
01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:46,090
the human race period and it.
But it varies from place and I think 

2373
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:47,060
here in America we have a very specific 
case.

2374
01:38:47,061 --> 01:38:48,230
Like I'm saying that it,
it's,

2375
01:38:48,231 --> 01:38:53,231
it's,
it is specific to us as Americans have 

2376
01:38:53,231 --> 01:38:56,860
the way we use our technology,
the way that we are progressing or 

2377
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:57,710
regressing as individuals.
And uh,

2378
01:38:57,910 --> 01:39:00,530
there's,
there's this huge concept of uh,

2379
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:05,590
so,
so one thing about people talking shit 

2380
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,590
about folks is that,
you know,

2381
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:06,800
of course that is the anonymity,
but there's also this prevalent attitude

2382
01:39:06,801 --> 01:39:11,801
that I can go out there and be as much 
of an asshole as I want because you're 

2383
01:39:11,801 --> 01:39:12,230
not going to do anything about it.
You can't beat me up.

2384
01:39:12,231 --> 01:39:17,231
You can't just fight me like nobody.
Like nobody actually thinks that 

2385
01:39:17,231 --> 01:39:17,231
anything will happen.

2386
01:39:17,231 --> 01:39:18,530
But oh well I'll sue you.
You should be able to you.

2387
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,810
If someone talks shit to you and your a 
problem and may fire,

2388
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:23,250
you should at least be able to bitch 
slap them a little bit.

2389
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:24,230
Totally legal.
And,

2390
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:25,820
and my thing is like,
even if,

2391
01:39:25,821 --> 01:39:30,821
uh,
if you're being outwardly with so many 

2392
01:39:30,821 --> 01:39:32,780
people lack common courtesy anymore,
just the smallest things.

2393
01:39:32,781 --> 01:39:37,781
And if you do something that is 
discourteous in a public manner and you 

2394
01:39:37,781 --> 01:39:39,890
upset somebody,
well most people just fucking take it.

2395
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:41,510
But if someone goes,
hey,

2396
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:43,300
fuck you for doing x,
Y,

2397
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:44,480
Z,
that's not cool.

2398
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:47,180
Instead of someone being like,
all right,

2399
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,650
either a,
I'm sorry,

2400
01:39:48,651 --> 01:39:50,150
you're right.
That was fucked up.

2401
01:39:50,151 --> 01:39:51,530
I shouldn't have done that.
And you know,

2402
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:54,680
waking up a or b being like,
you know what,

2403
01:39:54,681 --> 01:39:55,700
fuck you,
I'm just an asshole.

2404
01:39:55,701 --> 01:39:57,350
So let's fight and dealing with it.

2405
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:59,960
And then let's say they get their ass 
beat and then they go about their way.

2406
01:40:00,310 --> 01:40:00,810
No,
no,

2407
01:40:00,811 --> 01:40:01,700
no.
It's always like,

2408
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:04,290
they just keep pushing that barrier 
because that boundary.

2409
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:09,291
But,
and crossing that line because they 

2410
01:40:09,291 --> 01:40:09,291
think you can do anything about it.
You can't just,

2411
01:40:09,291 --> 01:40:10,430
you know,
use freedom of speech.

2412
01:40:10,431 --> 01:40:11,930
I can be as much of a dickhead as I 
want,

2413
01:40:11,931 --> 01:40:13,040
as long as they don't do anything to 
you.

2414
01:40:13,041 --> 01:40:14,420
And it's okay.
Fine.

2415
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:15,890
And I've,
I've had,

2416
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:18,710
usually it is these things where I've 
had,

2417
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:20,450
where it's happened to me,
I've turned to him and I,

2418
01:40:20,451 --> 01:40:22,700
you know,
I tell them like in a movie theater,

2419
01:40:22,701 --> 01:40:24,480
you know,
fucking cell phone and the on the,

2420
01:40:24,481 --> 01:40:26,850
on the cell phone talking on it in the 
middle of the movie theater,

2421
01:40:26,851 --> 01:40:27,690
I had to turn around.
I go,

2422
01:40:27,691 --> 01:40:29,960
are you fucking on your phone in the 
middle of a movie?

2423
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:30,830
Fucking kidding me.

2424
01:40:30,830 --> 01:40:35,830
And I looked at him and go get off that 
fucking phone right now I'm a breaker 

2425
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:38,140
and a half and shove it up your ass.
And I say that because I slept.

2426
01:40:38,170 --> 01:40:39,830
Someone would say in a movie,
well there's that.

2427
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:42,590
But also it's very appropriate.
It's very clinical.

2428
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,330
When I,
I tried,

2429
01:40:44,331 --> 01:40:49,331
I pride myself on being.
If I say some shit like that after I've 

2430
01:40:49,641 --> 01:40:52,640
said it during no turning back.
And if I say I'm going to do it,

2431
01:40:52,641 --> 01:40:55,550
I'm going to fucking do it because 
otherwise my word is meaningless.

2432
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:58,010
But you really shove it up their ass.
You might shove it up there.

2433
01:40:58,011 --> 01:41:00,170
I would break them a little,
like a bad baby.

2434
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,730
Throw them across the chair,
maybe.

2435
01:41:01,731 --> 01:41:02,630
I Dunno,
but yeah,

2436
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:07,640
I just went limp though.
You probably just scream and pick them 

2437
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:07,640
up and shake them them.
Yeah,

2438
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,680
if they just went lamp,
they just completely fetal position.

2439
01:41:09,681 --> 01:41:11,060
I'd take that phone,
break it,

2440
01:41:11,061 --> 01:41:16,061
slam it on the phone,
tell him what a piece of shit they were 

2441
01:41:16,061 --> 01:41:16,061
and they let it go.
But that's your move folks.

2442
01:41:16,061 --> 01:41:17,450
Listen,
you got to go limp.

2443
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:20,900
Just go limp.
And if you can start crying,

2444
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:23,270
just crying.
I go limp all the time.

2445
01:41:23,271 --> 01:41:28,271
It's that after I'm done.
Oh happens buddy.

2446
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:35,150
I think this is a very important subject
and I love that you brought it up and I 

2447
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:36,180
think um,
this is a,

2448
01:41:36,181 --> 01:41:36,800
um,
a,

2449
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:40,410
a really important subject for the young
men,

2450
01:41:40,411 --> 01:41:43,760
especially of this era that are growing 
up now.

2451
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:47,190
Just being forced fed video games and 
not having any character

2452
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:50,290
to build it.
They just leave the kid with the eye,

2453
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:53,680
the portable portable gaming system.
And you know what?

2454
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:58,780
I Love Games.
I gained a lot when I was a kid and I 

2455
01:41:58,780 --> 01:41:58,780
loved it.
But guess what?

2456
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,140
When I'm out with my parents or I'm at 
family functions,

2457
01:42:00,141 --> 01:42:05,141
when I'm not sitting in a corner 
completely buried into some electronics 

2458
01:42:05,141 --> 01:42:05,750
the whole time being like,
fuck that.

2459
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:07,400
Like you can't let your kid do that 
shit.

2460
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:07,930
Yeah,

2461
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,850
definitely doesn't teach them.
That doesn't raise a good human skills,

2462
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:17,970
but the mind what what concerns me is 
the lack of character building things.

2463
01:42:18,221 --> 01:42:20,560
If you're not involved in some kind of 
athletics,

2464
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:25,570
then to me if you're.
It's either that or some other difficult

2465
01:42:25,571 --> 01:42:30,571
intellectual pursuit,
but there's something that has to 

2466
01:42:30,571 --> 01:42:30,571
happen.

2467
01:42:30,571 --> 01:42:30,800
They need to suffer being being,
being made to,

2468
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:32,060
to have some,
you know,

2469
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,390
a push.
Yeah.

2470
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:37,800
To be able to realize that you will fail
and learn from the failures.

2471
01:42:37,801 --> 01:42:38,750
Objective.
Lee,

2472
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,880
one of the most important things you 
could ever learn as a man is how you 

2473
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,881
fucked up and how not to fuck up again 
because you understand the pain of 

2474
01:42:46,881 --> 01:42:48,040
fucking up.
One of the saddest thing to it too,

2475
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:50,280
and one of the saddest things is when 
you see rich kids,

2476
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:55,580
kids that grow up with no character and 
no one ever tells them what to do with 

2477
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:55,580
fucking up.
Yeah,

2478
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:56,700
they got to cook all their life.
That takes.

2479
01:42:57,310 --> 01:43:02,310
Here's the other one.
They don't understand that the reason 

2480
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:04,950
that they're able to create a business 
doing this or do that or have all this 

2481
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:08,731
little successful shit running around 
them is because they had all the 

2482
01:43:08,731 --> 01:43:12,301
facilities to do it in the first place.
They didn't have to strive and struggle 

2483
01:43:12,301 --> 01:43:12,301
and fucking,
you know,

2484
01:43:12,301 --> 01:43:12,580
oh,
you fuck up.

2485
01:43:12,581 --> 01:43:14,680
I've got money to cover that fuck up.
Oh,

2486
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:15,910
dummies.
Who were proud of that

2487
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:20,930
be from America.
Like they did something to one to one 

2488
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:24,181
thing.
We proud to be from America because we 

2489
01:43:24,181 --> 01:43:24,181
have an agreement that we're America and
we're not conscious.

2490
01:43:24,290 --> 01:43:26,180
We all get together and we fucking 
strive.

2491
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:28,560
We try to make the best shit and be 
proud of that,

2492
01:43:28,561 --> 01:43:33,561
but to make it seem like you're great 
because you're American when you were 

2493
01:43:33,561 --> 01:43:35,640
just fucking born in a lucky spot,
like that's ridiculous.

2494
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:37,960
That's fucking bullshit.
It's not your country.

2495
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:38,750
Yeah,
exactly.

2496
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,490
You if you're lucky enough to be born 
anywhere you're at,

2497
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:43,300
you should be proud of of where you're 
at,

2498
01:43:43,301 --> 01:43:48,301
but part of being,
having pride in that is by being a 

2499
01:43:48,301 --> 01:43:51,781
fucking good example of a human being 
and representing that culture to its 

2500
01:43:51,781 --> 01:43:51,781
fullest.
That's it.

2501
01:43:51,781 --> 01:43:52,290
Not being proud

2502
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:54,090
that you're from a fucking city.
Stupid.

2503
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:55,380
No,
that's ridiculous.

2504
01:43:55,381 --> 01:44:00,381
Be Proud.
Be Proud of your own personal control 

2505
01:44:00,381 --> 01:44:00,381
over your character

2506
01:44:00,381 --> 01:44:02,050
and your contribution to hew to your 
community.

2507
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:05,930
Your community is to be a fucking 
involve yourself.

2508
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:11,920
That's the big problem is,
you know I've said this over and over 

2509
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,791
again,
is that the biggest resource in the 

2510
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:15,791
world,
his children,

2511
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:15,800
children will become the adults of the 
future obviously,

2512
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:21,040
and the more access to information and 
character building exercises and the 

2513
01:44:21,711 --> 01:44:26,711
more we can make them great,
the better off the future's going to be 

2514
01:44:26,711 --> 01:44:29,531
for everybody of course,
but that's the most neglected aspect of 

2515
01:44:29,531 --> 01:44:29,531
this world.

2516
01:44:29,531 --> 01:44:29,790
Exactly.
I mean,

2517
01:44:30,150 --> 01:44:32,730
how many people are just out there 
popping kids out?

2518
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:35,100
They don't have the education or the 
money to support.

2519
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:36,120
I mean,
they don't even,

2520
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:41,300
to me,
I look at it is they don't understand 

2521
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:42,560
how difficult and how important raising 
a child.

2522
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:45,210
There's also a disconnect in what we 
call culture.

2523
01:44:45,930 --> 01:44:50,930
There's a disconnect in a society 
because the society started out where 

2524
01:44:50,930 --> 01:44:54,621
everybody had to stick together because 
you go on a hunting parties and you 

2525
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:57,551
know,
you'd be growing food or taking care of 

2526
01:44:57,551 --> 01:44:59,020
babies and they were to be collective 
collection collectives where,

2527
01:44:59,021 --> 01:44:59,290
uh,
you know,

2528
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,950
everybody would pile in their food.
Everybody had to stay alive.

2529
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:06,960
Everybody had to do their own job.
Everybody knew everybody encountered on 

2530
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:06,960
everybody.
But it got to a point where there wasn't

2531
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:07,740
50 people anymore.
Now,

2532
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,790
now you have walls and now there's a 
thousand,

2533
01:45:09,791 --> 01:45:14,791
now there's 2000.
Now you don't even know these fucking 

2534
01:45:14,791 --> 01:45:14,791
people.
So that,

2535
01:45:14,791 --> 01:45:17,720
that this disconnect is in place where 
you have all these people that are 

2536
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,320
supposed to be like your comrades and 
your brothers and sisters,

2537
01:45:19,321 --> 01:45:21,540
but you don't even fucking know them.
You know?

2538
01:45:21,541 --> 01:45:23,460
And then it get.
That's when you get to a city and that's

2539
01:45:23,461 --> 01:45:25,500
when you get to a country.
And that's where America is.

2540
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:26,240
It's this weird

2541
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:31,260
then now look at the way that technology
has influenced our disconnect from each 

2542
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:34,621
other.
You're buried in your phone everyday of 

2543
01:45:34,621 --> 01:45:34,621
every,
of every second of every hour.

2544
01:45:34,621 --> 01:45:38,570
These people,
you're not talking to anybody in line 

2545
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:40,451
and you're not actually conversing with 
the people that provide the services 

2546
01:45:40,451 --> 01:45:41,050
that you,
that you're supposed to go to in life.

2547
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:42,520
Like the postman,
the,

2548
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:45,190
the person with the supermarket.
You're not converting.

2549
01:45:45,191 --> 01:45:45,790
You're just like,
hey,

2550
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:47,530
swipe card.
Do whatever you got back.

2551
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:47,790
You know,

2552
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:50,770
ironically,
it's also connecting countries,

2553
01:45:50,890 --> 01:45:53,800
Internet connects countries and 
disconnects people.

2554
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:56,430
It does.
The thing is is that the internet can be

2555
01:45:56,431 --> 01:46:01,431
used for so much good and it can also be
a crutch to turn you into a shitty 

2556
01:46:01,431 --> 01:46:05,600
completely non community based.
You think that you're getting the same 

2557
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,260
thing by being on facebook or twitter 
and all this and that.

2558
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:09,170
All of sudden that you're interacting 
with people,

2559
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:12,630
you are interacting with people,
but that is not the way humanity works.

2560
01:46:12,631 --> 01:46:17,631
In fact,
I was reading a thing about how being a 

2561
01:46:17,631 --> 01:46:19,941
misanthrope like deliberately not 
interacting with society on a regular 

2562
01:46:20,071 --> 01:46:22,980
basis can be worse than being an 
alcoholic for your,

2563
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:28,010
for your body and your health.
Like just simply not interacting with 

2564
01:46:28,010 --> 01:46:28,470
other people.
Yeah,

2565
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:29,790
it makes sense.
I mean it's just,

2566
01:46:29,791 --> 01:46:30,890
you're,
you're dwelling on it

2567
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,530
negative energy and you're not getting 
any positive warm from humans,

2568
01:46:34,531 --> 01:46:37,520
which is like one of the most satisfying
things a person can get as well.

2569
01:46:37,521 --> 01:46:37,640
Like

2570
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,880
love from other people.
Yeah.

2571
01:46:38,881 --> 01:46:41,010
You see somebody write something nice to
you online,

2572
01:46:41,011 --> 01:46:41,940
all that.
That's cool.

2573
01:46:42,030 --> 01:46:43,960
If you have an a one on one 
conversation,

2574
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,480
look somebody in the eye and they say,
you know what,

2575
01:46:45,481 --> 01:46:49,550
I really respect you for the person that
you and I,

2576
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:51,090
I,
I'm really proud to know you.

2577
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:56,240
That as a way different effect on some.
Same as like people want to send text 

2578
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:58,590
messages about important as shit.
Like oh,

2579
01:46:58,591 --> 01:47:00,570
sorry about this.
Oh,

2580
01:47:00,571 --> 01:47:03,390
and you know,
dog eat whatever or something.

2581
01:47:03,391 --> 01:47:05,040
Or a are like,
oh,

2582
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:07,230
did you hear that a so and so.
It just died like,

2583
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:09,240
fuck,
give me at least a phone call.

2584
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:11,330
Like a text is not.
I mean,

2585
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,960
well that's a cheap way out.
It is a cheap way because you really,

2586
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:14,820
you're,
it's like,

2587
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:19,850
oh,
I want to break up with you with even a 

2588
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:21,201
phone call or do anything show up and 
somebody wants to break up with you and 

2589
01:47:21,201 --> 01:47:21,330
sends you a text message.

2590
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:22,860
You Got off light.
I guess.

2591
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,590
So I want to talk to you.
I've gotten a phone call break up.

2592
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,120
Oh yeah.
That was actually,

2593
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:27,960
that one was,
that was,

2594
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:29,610
that was,
that was really fucked up.

2595
01:47:29,611 --> 01:47:30,980
I'm like,
oh man.

2596
01:47:30,981 --> 01:47:32,820
Well it was to me also because I'm like,
aren't you?

2597
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:37,840
Weren't you?
Weren't we supposed to be like best 

2598
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:37,840
friends before all this shit together,
Josh?

2599
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:38,880
Pardon?
Shitty.

2600
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:44,060
God.
Can't even look me in the face and be 

2601
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:44,060
like,
Hey,

2602
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:44,060
what's up?
It's over.

2603
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:44,060
Bitch.
Can't fuck me.

2604
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:48,471
No Mall is heading in that direction.
And you stay right there.

2605
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:52,340
My own boat and a bonanza.
This vagina right out.

2606
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:53,290
Yeah.
It's,

2607
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:54,430
um,
the,

2608
01:47:54,490 --> 01:47:56,730
the lack of development of,
uh,

2609
01:47:56,740 --> 01:48:01,740
of human beings like where they're 
tested and where they have to develop 

2610
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:05,491
character that's like one of the big,
like one of the most disappointing 

2611
01:48:07,211 --> 01:48:10,990
aspects of our society and our culture 
is that we've never figured out a way to

2612
01:48:10,991 --> 01:48:15,670
cultivate people correctly that way we 
can do it.

2613
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:20,710
That's the question.
We have plenty of money and plenty of 

2614
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:20,710
resources to do things.

2615
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:24,220
It's,
and it can just start from the smallest 

2616
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:24,220
thing in the house with chores to,
to just,

2617
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:25,350
you know,
just being stern in your word and,

2618
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:30,420
and leading by example.
I mean the opportunity to give children 

2619
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:33,410
those things to help develop them,
male or female,

2620
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:38,500
you know,
exist every single day and they're 

2621
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,990
completely at our fingertips.
If we want to choose to participate and 

2622
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:44,051
taking that kind of responsibility for 
bringing this child into the world and 

2623
01:48:44,051 --> 01:48:45,260
trying to raise them to be a,
uh,

2624
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:46,760
an awesome human being,
an uh,

2625
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:51,940
uh,
contributing important part of society 

2626
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:54,470
and helping show by example what a good 
person is.

2627
01:48:54,471 --> 01:48:56,370
You know,
the drop that starts the ripples.

2628
01:48:56,371 --> 01:48:57,260
That's super important.

2629
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:02,480
Well it is and some people,
they obviously they take on that task 

2630
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:02,480
when they're just trying to get some 
pussy,

2631
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,240
let people,
all of a sudden they're there,

2632
01:49:03,241 --> 01:49:08,241
they're there in this situation and they
try to make due and they fuck up and 

2633
01:49:08,241 --> 01:49:08,241
they,
you know,

2634
01:49:08,241 --> 01:49:08,790
they really don't have their own shit 
together.

2635
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:14,060
But I think as a society what we got,
there's a real problem in that we,

2636
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:18,810
we haven't really addressed how to 
properly,

2637
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:22,170
properly make use of our,
our young people.

2638
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:27,350
I think it's beautiful to have freedom.
It's beautiful to have the ability to 

2639
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:27,590
choose whatever occupation you want and 
speed.

2640
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:32,400
But I think that like the steps that you
go from being a young man,

2641
01:49:32,401 --> 01:49:34,140
living with your parents to being in 
college,

2642
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:37,530
to being independent there,
they're so obscure and massive.

2643
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:39,310
It's so like,
am I really am out of.

2644
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:40,470
Am I out here now?
Okay,

2645
01:49:40,471 --> 01:49:42,570
now I've got to get an apartment and 
what do I do now?

2646
01:49:42,571 --> 01:49:44,230
While you've got to make sure you got a 
good job,

2647
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:44,990
but a good.
Okay,

2648
01:49:44,991 --> 01:49:46,050
I'm good.
You could do that.

2649
01:49:46,051 --> 01:49:46,730
How do you get the good?
Yeah,

2650
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,490
right.
Go to college,

2651
01:49:47,491 --> 01:49:48,030
you go to college,
you

2652
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:49,440
spend on it.
It's like actually,

2653
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:52,050
you know,
I mean there's still this huge myth that

2654
01:49:52,051 --> 01:49:54,480
you need to go get a four year degree in
dollar ship will,

2655
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:59,500
you know,
not every four year degree is actually 

2656
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,210
worth the fucking $50,000.
You just put yourself in debt.

2657
01:50:00,211 --> 01:50:05,211
Like sometimes you're actually doing a 
disservice to yourself and putting 

2658
01:50:05,211 --> 01:50:07,761
yourself behind the.
You can be just another college 

2659
01:50:07,761 --> 01:50:08,270
graduate,
work in a fucking shit job that can't,

2660
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:11,050
can barely pay off their loans.
You got to realize what,

2661
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:16,100
what is it,
where is it worth putting that money 

2662
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:16,100
towards?
You know what I tell people all the time

2663
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:17,040
that are just sort of,
you know,

2664
01:50:17,041 --> 01:50:18,170
unsettled,
whatever.

2665
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:18,720
Even,
you know,

2666
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:19,900
parents are kids,
you know,

2667
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:22,530
we're thinking about moving them along 
in the next step.

2668
01:50:22,531 --> 01:50:24,870
They're graduating to go sending a fuck,
you know,

2669
01:50:24,871 --> 01:50:25,620
figure out,
get a,

2670
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:26,820
you know,
he probably isn't.

2671
01:50:26,850 --> 01:50:28,710
He or she isn't going to really know 
what they want to do yet.

2672
01:50:29,190 --> 01:50:30,840
Likely.
But if they have an idea,

2673
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:32,430
find the,
find the,

2674
01:50:32,431 --> 01:50:37,431
uh,
the university or whatever school that 

2675
01:50:37,431 --> 01:50:39,171
at some point they're going to need to 
be at and then find the appropriate 

2676
01:50:39,171 --> 01:50:42,681
junior community college that,
that transfer as well into that fucking 

2677
01:50:42,681 --> 01:50:45,300
dude and the dude that because you need 
to get in there and get your shit done.

2678
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:47,580
Books,
education.

2679
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:49,950
I mean,
if you really want to be true about it,

2680
01:50:49,951 --> 01:50:51,870
you don't have to go to college to learn
anything.

2681
01:50:52,350 --> 01:50:57,350
You can fucking read a book.
You can teach yourself and even with 

2682
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:57,350
like the Internet like you're talking 
about,

2683
01:50:57,350 --> 01:51:01,910
there is so much information and 
knowledge out there that a person can 

2684
01:51:01,910 --> 01:51:01,910
process.
Now of course,

2685
01:51:01,910 --> 01:51:06,710
having one on,
well you don't ever get that 

2686
01:51:06,710 --> 01:51:08,811
necessarily,
but having human interaction to help 

2687
01:51:08,811 --> 01:51:10,860
guide you upon this with their own 
experience is invaluable.

2688
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:16,130
But the actual knowledge of the APP,
the actual process of just gathering 

2689
01:51:16,261 --> 01:51:18,570
knowledge and getting understandings 
that,

2690
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:23,690
fuck man,
you think you could become a lawyer by 

2691
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:23,690
going to a library.

2692
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:25,710
The actual process of gathering 
knowledge for sure is,

2693
01:51:25,711 --> 01:51:26,460
uh,
you know,

2694
01:51:26,461 --> 01:51:29,100
it's much easier now than it's ever been
before.

2695
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:34,220
The real problem is that people don't 
have good guidelines as far as behavior,

2696
01:51:36,061 --> 01:51:38,700
as far as getting things done,
and as far as positive thinking,

2697
01:51:38,730 --> 01:51:43,730
yes.
One of the things that has been a side 

2698
01:51:43,730 --> 01:51:46,881
effect of this podcast are completely 
unintended and we never saw it coming.

2699
01:51:48,150 --> 01:51:51,540
Was that all these fucking people are.
I meet them after shows.

2700
01:51:51,690 --> 01:51:53,550
He changed my life.
I lost 100 pounds.

2701
01:51:53,551 --> 01:51:55,770
I drink Kale shakes every morning.
I work out everyday.

2702
01:51:55,830 --> 01:51:59,850
I started Jujitsu.
It's like thousands of fucking people.

2703
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:04,880
It's like,
and what they say is that almost to a 

2704
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:09,681
man,
it's like I never had anybody around me 

2705
01:52:09,681 --> 01:52:09,681
that was talking the right way is that 
it wasn't me.

2706
01:52:09,681 --> 01:52:12,010
It's not that I didn't have potential.
It's not that I have no,

2707
01:52:12,011 --> 01:52:16,140
but nobody that motivated me and then 
all of a sudden someone did and now what

2708
01:52:16,141 --> 01:52:17,220
are you doing?
Are you sleeping over there?

2709
01:52:17,221 --> 01:52:18,060
Dude,
it's not me.

2710
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:19,850
Is that you're snoring?
No.

2711
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:22,170
You sleeping.
Sleeping.

2712
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:24,360
No.
That wasn't you.

2713
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,740
I think there's not enough.
It wasn't.

2714
01:52:25,741 --> 01:52:29,340
You know somebody who is breathing and 
it doesn't like

2715
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:32,180
it wasn't him.
Oh my God,

2716
01:52:32,181 --> 01:52:32,510
he was sleep.

2717
01:52:33,170 --> 01:52:38,170
I swear to God.
That sounds really familiar to a lot of 

2718
01:52:39,351 --> 01:52:40,040
women.
I've called.

2719
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,010
Is that what you do?
It's,

2720
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:46,010
it's my opening.
Tell you what you're wearing.

2721
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,880
If you like that.
If you go,

2722
01:52:46,881 --> 01:52:47,570
Hey,
what are you wearing?

2723
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:52,540
Crazy bitch.
Then they tell you a dirty whore bars.

2724
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:54,060
Yeah,
well,

2725
01:52:54,061 --> 01:52:55,400
you know,
we all have our preferences.

2726
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:57,020
That's when they get kicked,
punched her with you.

2727
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:01,700
Get it.
You know what?

2728
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:02,810
It's just like I said,
you,

2729
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,180
you wanna.
Do you want people to be a certain way?

2730
01:53:05,181 --> 01:53:06,680
You want to make a difference in the 
world?

2731
01:53:06,681 --> 01:53:08,540
Start with yourself and it goes from 
there.

2732
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:09,760
We'll start with you.
So lead.

2733
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:12,110
Give an example that other people can 
follow.

2734
01:53:12,111 --> 01:53:13,580
Just like the examples that you 
followed.

2735
01:53:13,581 --> 01:53:18,581
I mean everybody is where they are 
because they learn for someone greater 

2736
01:53:18,581 --> 01:53:18,581
than them.
Almost everybody to a person.

2737
01:53:18,581 --> 01:53:19,400
Learn from somebody.

2738
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:24,470
When I have some of the men that have 
been formative in developing who I am as

2739
01:53:24,471 --> 01:53:29,471
a man in life,
and I tell people some of the stories 

2740
01:53:29,471 --> 01:53:30,150
that came to,
you know,

2741
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:35,400
to,
to have these people in my life and 

2742
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:35,400
some,
and there's some folks,

2743
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:35,400
especially a lot of these,
these,

2744
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:40,241
these men nowadays that are,
and I'm not even to speak about women 

2745
01:53:40,241 --> 01:53:43,511
because women and men are,
they have totally different mindsets in 

2746
01:53:43,511 --> 01:53:43,511
the way that they develop.
And uh,

2747
01:53:43,511 --> 01:53:44,360
you can,
they're apples and oranges,

2748
01:53:44,361 --> 01:53:45,710
but the men,
you,

2749
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:47,000
the men and women,
a different dude.

2750
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:49,730
Oh my God,
man from Mars were women.

2751
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:54,790
I know I'm from Mars.
Are they from Uranus as a save a 

2752
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:55,220
warrior,
you know,

2753
01:53:55,221 --> 01:53:58,190
as the god of war and death and blood 
and fire and all that.

2754
01:53:58,191 --> 01:54:00,050
She just needed a hug.
Yeah,

2755
01:54:00,090 --> 01:54:04,100
in a handy,
but a start from there,

2756
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,600
uh,
these,

2757
01:54:05,601 --> 01:54:07,670
these men will look at me that way.

2758
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:09,490
Underdeveloped in terms of trying to,
to,

2759
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:11,820
to have that well rounded understanding 
of,

2760
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,000
of,
of being a man.

2761
01:54:14,001 --> 01:54:15,770
You know,
I haven't the all the,

2762
01:54:15,771 --> 01:54:20,771
all the facets covered and I'll tell him
these stories about some of the people 

2763
01:54:20,771 --> 01:54:23,240
that,
that are major to making me the man I am

2764
01:54:23,241 --> 01:54:28,241
and they're like,
like their eyes get huge dinner place 

2765
01:54:28,241 --> 01:54:28,241
and they can't believe that they're 
like,

2766
01:54:28,241 --> 01:54:29,570
that sounds terrible.
That's fucking horrible.

2767
01:54:29,571 --> 01:54:33,500
That's how like,
you know what's not actually that bad.

2768
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,370
All right.
You know,

2769
01:54:34,371 --> 01:54:39,371
and I'm wouldn't change any of it 
because it made me the kind of person 

2770
01:54:39,371 --> 01:54:39,590
that I am the day and I like who I am 
and,

2771
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:41,780
and some of these people were hard as 
fuck.

2772
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:47,200
There's been some people in the past 
that were hard as fuck that farmer 

2773
01:54:47,931 --> 01:54:50,060
Burns' character who used to hang 
himself.

2774
01:54:50,090 --> 01:54:55,090
Oh yeah.
By his own hang himself from his neck 

2775
01:54:55,090 --> 01:54:55,090
and just stand there.

2776
01:54:55,090 --> 01:54:59,600
People Watch this guy used to drop.
He didn't just use to hang himself.

2777
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:01,620
He used to drop like,
I don't know how.

2778
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:03,370
I don't know how many feet it was.
I mean,

2779
01:55:03,371 --> 01:55:05,720
it wasn't,
it wasn't just let me put this around.

2780
01:55:05,721 --> 01:55:06,740
Okay,
I'm ready.

2781
01:55:06,741 --> 01:55:07,460
Go.
No,

2782
01:55:07,461 --> 01:55:09,990
he would drop and catch yourself with 
his fucking neck.

2783
01:55:09,991 --> 01:55:11,620
And neck,
giant neck,

2784
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,030
these guys used to wrestle a back in the
day doing all the catches,

2785
01:55:15,031 --> 01:55:18,360
catch can stuff or just any type of 
wrestling and have nice,

2786
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:23,540
wonderful spongy mats.
And if you did have any sort of matte 

2787
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:26,310
substance that you could use a,
it was probably someplace that was quite

2788
01:55:26,311 --> 01:55:29,430
affluent so you know what they wrestling
on ground grass,

2789
01:55:29,970 --> 01:55:31,380
rug,
carpet type shit,

2790
01:55:31,410 --> 01:55:33,160
you know,
I mean that's a snake pit in,

2791
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:38,180
in England.
They used to wrestle on a carpet 

2792
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:38,180
throwing each other.
Jesus,

2793
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,700
Jesus Christ.
But that was it.

2794
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:45,470
Pick out a famous catch.
There's a,

2795
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:48,770
there's a couple different schools of 
submission style,

2796
01:55:48,771 --> 01:55:52,680
a grappling and one of the earliest ones
in America,

2797
01:55:52,681 --> 01:55:55,160
the called catch wrestling or catch as 
catch can.

2798
01:55:55,490 --> 01:55:56,730
And um,
it was,

2799
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:59,020
it was real professional wrestling at 
one point in time,

2800
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:01,460
unlike theatrical professional 
wrestling,

2801
01:56:01,461 --> 01:56:03,530
which is like entertainment.
They used to,

2802
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:06,740
they used to go out and then you can pin
a guy or you can submit them.

2803
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,330
It could be,
it could be either one.

2804
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:13,550
And there's a lot of gangster fucking 
holds that I learned from Sylvia Momenta

2805
01:56:14,290 --> 01:56:16,630
who was a black belt in a gene labell oh
yeah.

2806
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:19,200
Gina Bell loves all that Shit.
So sylvio,

2807
01:56:19,201 --> 01:56:24,201
uh,
he was always like pig and all these 

2808
01:56:24,201 --> 01:56:24,290
crazy net cranks and all,
all these different things that like,

2809
01:56:24,530 --> 01:56:25,910
I'm like,
why aren't these in Jujitsu?

2810
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:27,170
Cause.
But they are.

2811
01:56:27,290 --> 01:56:29,210
Some guys use them.
Do you see,

2812
01:56:29,211 --> 01:56:31,400
did you see Damien Maia has victory over
Rick Story?

2813
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:32,820
Uh,
no I didn't.

2814
01:56:32,910 --> 01:56:35,250
He submitted them in the first round,
but he got his back.

2815
01:56:35,251 --> 01:56:37,640
He couldn't get a rear naked and so he 
turned it into a net cranking.

2816
01:56:37,770 --> 01:56:38,030
Sure.

2817
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:39,710
Fuck the shit out of luck.
Yeah.

2818
01:56:39,830 --> 01:56:41,340
Oh,
it was a terrible angle.

2819
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:45,590
Like it was like instant tap ones.
Like your head's gonna fly off.

2820
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:48,280
Sure enough,
I mean wrestling is wrestling match and,

2821
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:52,100
and it's all over the world and people 
are styles that have developed,

2822
01:56:52,101 --> 01:56:57,101
you know,
Jujitsu is the way it is for the most 

2823
01:56:57,101 --> 01:56:57,101
part because of the rules of the sport,
of Jujitsu.

2824
01:56:57,101 --> 01:57:00,881
Because you know,
often sport will predicate how your 

2825
01:57:00,881 --> 01:57:04,721
training will be developed because you 
want to be the best within this 

2826
01:57:04,721 --> 01:57:04,721
confinement.
Uh,

2827
01:57:04,721 --> 01:57:09,100
but that doesn't,
that's not to say that you can't expand 

2828
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:09,100
upon anything with the human body.
If you want to be a dynamic,

2829
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:10,340
be as dynamic as you want to,
you know,

2830
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:13,880
the jkd Bruce Lee's philosophy,
eat the meat and spit out the bone.

2831
01:57:13,881 --> 01:57:18,881
I mean,
there's no reason anybody can't do that 

2832
01:57:18,881 --> 01:57:18,881
for themselves.
But you know,

2833
01:57:18,881 --> 01:57:19,280
what's his name?
Um,

2834
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:21,160
Shannon,
who's the dude?

2835
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:22,610
Jake Shannon,
Shannon.

2836
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:27,820
Shannon is a,
a great historian when it comes to just 

2837
01:57:27,820 --> 01:57:28,040
the traps.
Awesome dude all around me when it comes

2838
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:28,640
to,
uh,

2839
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:33,680
you know,
even political stuff and cultural stuff 

2840
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,801
and he's a brilliant dude and uh,
the shit that he puts out there in the 

2841
01:57:35,801 --> 01:57:39,401
world as a whole,
not just the catch stuff is amazing 

2842
01:57:39,401 --> 01:57:39,401
shit.
Yeah,

2843
01:57:39,401 --> 01:57:39,401
I agree.
He's a really good dude.

2844
01:57:39,401 --> 01:57:40,110
Great.
Historically

2845
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:45,200
he really loves like the history of 
catch wrestling and because of him and 

2846
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:47,640
he's put out books and dvds and shit,
but some of the photos that he's found,

2847
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:51,300
it's amazing like the techniques that 
they had that they were using,

2848
01:57:51,301 --> 01:57:55,020
like triangles that were using,
they were using half guard.

2849
01:57:55,050 --> 01:57:56,970
They're using the lockdown from half 
guard.

2850
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:59,100
There were sweeping guys with these 
positions.

2851
01:57:59,101 --> 01:58:01,580
Are we using all these different good 
teams arm in game.

2852
01:58:01,870 --> 01:58:02,260
The first

2853
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:07,260
time I saw the lockdown Sushi Osaka was 
doing it to us in an AMC back in the day

2854
01:58:08,501 --> 01:58:10,390
and he used it as the submission 
version.

2855
01:58:10,570 --> 01:58:15,570
So you get lined up on a half guard,
you'd throw the lockdown on and you 

2856
01:58:15,570 --> 01:58:17,410
would extend and you basically you're 
putting like a calf crank on somebody.

2857
01:58:17,411 --> 01:58:22,411
And so that's how I first,
this was back in like 2001 if you count 

2858
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:25,480
sideways on it,
it's like a heel hook too.

2859
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:30,800
So that's how I learned it as like a,
like a tricky little submission and 

2860
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:30,800
close Daca was full of them,
you know,

2861
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:31,900
tk.
Yeah.

2862
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:34,620
And so that's what I first found out 
about lockdown.

2863
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:36,070
And then,
um,

2864
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:38,380
and then I saw Eddie,
you know,

2865
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:42,920
he came across and he used it as a,
as a positional to keep him for,

2866
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:47,770
for using his bottom game in terms of 
his reverses reversals and setting up,

2867
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:52,800
you know,
isolating that leg to use it later into 

2868
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:52,800
different applications.

2869
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:55,860
But it just goes to show you,
you can do fucking things a million 

2870
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:56,380
ways.
And then I remember Billy Robinson,

2871
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:57,990
who is from the snake pit,
uh,

2872
01:58:58,070 --> 01:59:00,040
in England where that whole term,
like those,

2873
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,320
uh,
he's a billy Robinson,

2874
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:03,190
uh,
is a,

2875
01:59:03,191 --> 01:59:05,230
uh,
he's from Wigan and in Wigan,

2876
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:07,030
that's what they came up with.
The term catches catch,

2877
01:59:07,031 --> 01:59:09,340
can get it any way you can.
And uh,

2878
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:10,480
billy,
uh,

2879
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:13,370
which I also refer to my love life.
Um,

2880
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:14,860
then,
uh,

2881
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:16,260
they had,
uh,

2882
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:21,310
the snake pit over there and billy Riley
started this place and just only the 

2883
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:21,550
toughest of the tough,
these fucking coal miners,

2884
01:59:21,551 --> 01:59:26,551
these,
these gnarly dudes wrestling on 

2885
01:59:26,551 --> 01:59:26,551
hardwood.
Well,

2886
01:59:26,551 --> 01:59:26,940
here's another sport that they used to 
do over there called [inaudible].

2887
01:59:27,630 --> 01:59:29,160
And what they would do is they would,
yeah,

2888
01:59:29,161 --> 01:59:29,890
it doesn't.
Yeah.

2889
01:59:29,891 --> 01:59:32,200
It doesn't involve kitty cats,
unfortunately.

2890
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:35,800
What it involves is them putting on,
they have these boots with studs on them

2891
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:38,290
on the bottom and it would kick each 
other in the shin.

2892
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:39,610
Oh,
get the fuck out of here.

2893
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,830
Not just like freeform,
but back and forth.

2894
01:59:41,831 --> 01:59:43,720
I go.
You go until somebody quit?

2895
01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:45,820
Yes.
How big of the spikes.

2896
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:47,020
Okay.
I don't know too big.

2897
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:48,530
Obviously.
It's always too big.

2898
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:50,740
It's just like this.
Is there any photos of this shit?

2899
01:59:50,741 --> 01:59:52,270
I believe so.
Go ahead and look it up.

2900
01:59:52,990 --> 01:59:56,050
But a Peri Peri P,
P U R R A,

2901
01:59:56,051 --> 02:00:01,051
P U R R I n g I believe.
Hurrying violence taking shins.

2902
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:02,740
England.
Uh,

2903
02:00:02,741 --> 02:00:04,150
so anyways,
just with England,

2904
02:00:04,151 --> 02:00:05,390
was it?
There was no policy over there.

2905
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:09,820
I'm just exhausted that opportunity and 
know snort and too much coal,

2906
02:00:09,821 --> 02:00:11,620
I guess makes you want to kick each 
other in the shins,

2907
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:14,470
but we're not so polite today.
Sure enough.

2908
02:00:14,530 --> 02:00:15,370
Yeah.
Uh,

2909
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:16,850
but uh,
uh,

2910
02:00:17,630 --> 02:00:22,630
the only time I remember being in a town
with the UFC were over in England and 

2911
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:26,971
the only time I remember where,
or the fighters were out trying to go 

2912
02:00:26,971 --> 02:00:26,971
grab shit to eat and do whatever.

2913
02:00:26,971 --> 02:00:27,430
And people are constantly like,
Hey,

2914
02:00:27,431 --> 02:00:30,460
fuck,
you might want to fucking go like,

2915
02:00:30,461 --> 02:00:31,540
Whoa,
dude,

2916
02:00:31,541 --> 02:00:32,860
are you kidding me?
It was just London.

2917
02:00:32,890 --> 02:00:34,420
Yes.
Just over nothing.

2918
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:35,430
Yeah.
Wow.

2919
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:36,880
Thank you.
Looking at me funny.

2920
02:00:37,190 --> 02:00:39,150
We'll fucking knock you out.
Right?

2921
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:42,760
Well some improper proper go out and 
looking for that shit.

2922
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:47,790
Sure enough.
But I just remember people coming back 

2923
02:00:47,790 --> 02:00:47,790
to the hotel over and over again,
be like,

2924
02:00:47,790 --> 02:00:47,790
Jesus Christ,
man.

2925
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,830
Everyone's trying to like the hardest 
shit trying to fight everyone.

2926
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:52,480
Was this the uh,
Tito Ortiz,

2927
02:00:52,481 --> 02:00:53,650
Lee Marie days.
Oh yes.

2928
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:58,800
So this was actually before mma had 
really made its way to Ingraham and 

2929
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:02,101
isn't that interesting?
They didn't really give a shit like who 

2930
02:01:02,101 --> 02:01:02,101
any of these,
you know,

2931
02:01:02,101 --> 02:01:02,230
American blocks where they want to fight
them.

2932
02:01:02,231 --> 02:01:07,231
But it's funny,
there's a before and I'm a keen there 

2933
02:01:07,231 --> 02:01:07,480
because now that mma is there,
the attitude is kind of different.

2934
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:10,320
Still.
Plenty of Brits,

2935
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:12,270
they'll just want to slug you up.
But uh,

2936
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:14,130
so,
so these guys,

2937
02:01:14,131 --> 02:01:14,970
you know,
these cats,

2938
02:01:14,971 --> 02:01:15,600
wrestlers,
you know,

2939
02:01:15,601 --> 02:01:18,960
they're going out there.
And so billy Robinson who trained at the

2940
02:01:19,110 --> 02:01:20,490
snake pit,
he's a catch wrestler.

2941
02:01:20,491 --> 02:01:23,020
And an amateur wrestler and I remember,
uh,

2942
02:01:23,070 --> 02:01:26,960
he's doing a little seminar out in Santa
Monica and he's showing this dropdown,

2943
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:28,470
sort of this,
this leg hook,

2944
02:01:28,471 --> 02:01:29,700
single leg,
and it turned,

2945
02:01:29,701 --> 02:01:31,680
you know,
you drop to a hip and then you come back

2946
02:01:31,681 --> 02:01:32,430
up.
And I'm like,

2947
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:35,100
just so you know,
billy right now,

2948
02:01:35,101 --> 02:01:40,101
there's this Jujitsu guy called Marcello
Garcia and that's like his number one 

2949
02:01:40,101 --> 02:01:41,000
into everything he fucking does right 
now.

2950
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:46,280
And not crazy.
Even though you've never trained 

2951
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:46,370
Jujitsu,
you've never seen Marcello and trust me,

2952
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:49,460
billy Robinson had never seen or heard 
of Marcello Garcia.

2953
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:51,970
It's just moves.
Yeah.

2954
02:01:51,971 --> 02:01:54,850
Well Marcello's technique is fairly 
basic.

2955
02:01:54,851 --> 02:01:58,390
It's just that he had hit it so well,
like the arm drag to the back.

2956
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:00,670
It was pretty,
pretty standard the way he did it with.

2957
02:02:00,671 --> 02:02:02,370
So is this,
it is this powering.

2958
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:04,580
Oh my God,
a very good photos.

2959
02:02:04,610 --> 02:02:07,630
Is this real?
These motherfuckers still do this shit.

2960
02:02:09,180 --> 02:02:11,650
I don't see any spikes.
Did they give up on the spikes?

2961
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:13,450
Oh No,
they have spikes around their ankles.

2962
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:16,240
Do you see?
I'm talking about she's.

2963
02:02:16,630 --> 02:02:19,720
When there's not enough vagina around,
you start doing really stupid shit.

2964
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:20,320
It.
Trust me.

2965
02:02:20,321 --> 02:02:23,260
I grew up in Boston.
I know what's up.

2966
02:02:23,620 --> 02:02:24,340
So,
uh,

2967
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:25,630
oh,
there we go.

2968
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:26,580
So,
uh,

2969
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:29,050
this guy grew up doing that as well when
they weren't.

2970
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:31,570
I don't think Billy Robinson was doing 
any permanent.

2971
02:02:31,571 --> 02:02:35,050
I think it was smarter than that,
but it's just the fact that,

2972
02:02:35,110 --> 02:02:36,530
you know,
moves are moves and you know,

2973
02:02:36,570 --> 02:02:39,790
he's showing something from one angle 
and it's like,

2974
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:40,750
by the way,
you know,

2975
02:02:40,751 --> 02:02:42,790
there's a guy doing that right now and 
he's winning a world title.

2976
02:02:42,870 --> 02:02:46,250
I think it was really interesting when 
the Shin Kicking Championships,

2977
02:02:46,370 --> 02:02:47,820
Jesus Christ,
this is state,

2978
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:50,200
this is pussy shit.
They're putting hay.

2979
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:52,050
They're packing their shins with,
hey,

2980
02:02:52,230 --> 02:02:54,060
this is fake.
Fake.

2981
02:02:54,061 --> 02:02:57,390
These frauds,
frauds take these frauds away.

2982
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Um,
it was really interesting in mma when 

2983
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,420
soccer Robert came along because there 
was this one style of submissions that 

2984
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:09,621
everybody was sort of gravitating 
towards are a lot of people gravitate 

2985
02:03:09,621 --> 02:03:09,621
towards,
which is Brazilian Jujitsu.

2986
02:03:09,621 --> 02:03:12,630
And then there's this Japanese dude who 
had this really kind of Funky,

2987
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:17,660
different sort of style,
did like similar techniques but kinda 

2988
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:21,800
had his own little flair to it.
And it turned out he had actually been 

2989
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:22,860
trained in catch wrestling that he was a
robinson.

2990
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:25,170
Yeah,
that's an amazing story.

2991
02:03:25,171 --> 02:03:28,620
The Sakharova for people weren't really 
fans of MMA.

2992
02:03:28,621 --> 02:03:32,070
They'll never going to appreciate how,
what a bad motherfucker Kazoo.

2993
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:32,580
She soccer.

2994
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:34,920
Let me tell you some Sakharova shit 
about,

2995
02:03:34,921 --> 02:03:36,540
you know,
I know how bad ass he is.

2996
02:03:36,541 --> 02:03:38,140
You know,
how bad ass he is a lot.

2997
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:39,220
There are plenty of,
uh,

2998
02:03:39,221 --> 02:03:44,221
of serious mma fans that know how legit 
Sakharova was and how much of a,

2999
02:03:45,150 --> 02:03:46,000
uh,
of a,

3000
02:03:46,001 --> 02:03:51,001
of like a,
just a character got like a sprung 

3001
02:03:51,001 --> 02:03:51,280
fucking cat on the ground.
Like just able to,

3002
02:03:51,281 --> 02:03:52,280
to,
to bound the,

3003
02:03:52,450 --> 02:03:54,570
to any positioning and come get his 
stuff,

3004
02:03:54,571 --> 02:03:55,320
you know,
uh,

3005
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:00,010
back in the day when he was going 
through the system and at the UWF during

3006
02:04:00,030 --> 02:04:05,030
the shoot style progressing stuff where 
they would sometimes mixing shoots and 

3007
02:04:05,030 --> 02:04:07,941
works on the same deal.
And a shoot for folks who don't know 

3008
02:04:07,941 --> 02:04:10,911
what it means really full on fight,
but these were all predetermined bright 

3009
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:13,350
and these are all under professional 
wrestling rules.

3010
02:04:13,351 --> 02:04:18,351
They had this last point thing with the 
rope escapes and getting suplex and 

3011
02:04:18,351 --> 02:04:18,780
knocked down and whatever.
But uh,

3012
02:04:19,170 --> 02:04:20,040
you know,
back in the day,

3013
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:24,630
not only did a Toccata used to beat them
up because Takata used to be a legit,

3014
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:27,480
like fucking.
I had a hellacious kick.

3015
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:29,160
He was a good athlete and he could 
fight.

3016
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:34,580
But tamra used to abuse the Shit Outta 
Sakharova all the time.

3017
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:39,860
There was a few times where they'd go,
they'd the ring in professional 

3018
02:04:39,860 --> 02:04:43,131
wrestling.
They would go legit and fucking Tamar 

3019
02:04:43,131 --> 02:04:43,131
would own him.
Like Tamra was the man.

3020
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:46,100
So what happened?
How did Sakharova he graduated,

3021
02:04:46,101 --> 02:04:46,810
man,
he grew up.

3022
02:04:46,811 --> 02:04:47,890
He got better.
Yeah,

3023
02:04:47,891 --> 02:04:51,520
of course.
And fight the first UFC in Japan when he

3024
02:04:51,521 --> 02:04:53,230
fought Kona.
So Vera and they,

3025
02:04:53,231 --> 02:04:58,231
uh,
they stopped prematurely and he was 

3026
02:04:58,231 --> 02:04:58,231
like,
what the fuck?

3027
02:04:58,231 --> 02:04:58,231
And so they started a back up again 
later on,

3028
02:04:58,231 --> 02:04:59,800
later on that night,
they didn't fight again.

3029
02:04:59,830 --> 02:05:01,390
It was craziness.
It was like,

3030
02:05:01,690 --> 02:05:03,230
boy,
just the emotional rollercoaster.

3031
02:05:03,310 --> 02:05:04,900
They must've been under.
He didn't just beat him.

3032
02:05:04,901 --> 02:05:07,050
He went out and tapped him tap conan.
So Vera,

3033
02:05:07,060 --> 02:05:12,060
which had never been done before.
No one had seen a Brazilian jujitsu 

3034
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:12,060
black belt get tapped yet.
It was like the new thing.

3035
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:13,990
I was like maybe,
maybe someone had,

3036
02:05:13,991 --> 02:05:17,690
I think maybe I'm John Lewis and uh,
Andre Pinera,

3037
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:20,410
I think maybe pet nera said tap John 
Lewis.

3038
02:05:20,411 --> 02:05:25,411
Did he tap him?
Did he know he didn't tap me soccer.

3039
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:26,390
Kicked him.
Oh,

3040
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:31,420
did Sata was on his back and Eris like 
slapped why his right leg and came 

3041
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:33,610
around with his left and soccer kicked 
them while Sato is an open garden.

3042
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:38,640
Was so was.
Who was the first place in Japan to 

3043
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:38,640
black belt to get tapped?
Because it might've been,

3044
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:39,390
it might've been.
It was like,

3045
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:41,500
it was like,
it was the most high profile one,

3046
02:05:41,590 --> 02:05:43,090
that's for sure.
Well then,

3047
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:44,510
uh,
was that,

3048
02:05:44,540 --> 02:05:46,750
that was before Maurice Fought Conan?
No,

3049
02:05:46,870 --> 02:05:47,920
after,
after.

3050
02:05:47,921 --> 02:05:52,921
Yeah.
Maurice had already known that going in 

3051
02:05:52,921 --> 02:05:52,921
and out,

3052
02:05:52,921 --> 02:05:54,530
but you know,
a key box or knocking somebody out 

3053
02:05:54,530 --> 02:05:54,530
that's,
you know,

3054
02:05:54,530 --> 02:05:55,620
kind of a given.
But the idea of a Jujitsu guy lose,

3055
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:58,920
especially to a non Jujitsu fighter.
Yeah,

3056
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:00,360
no,
they know what the contributor.

3057
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:05,040
And I used to get that all the time at 
AMC and people would be like introducing

3058
02:06:05,041 --> 02:06:05,910
folks,
what's your belt?

3059
02:06:06,170 --> 02:06:07,380
Uh,
I don't have a belt.

3060
02:06:07,890 --> 02:06:09,750
Oh,
what do you do for grappling?

3061
02:06:09,751 --> 02:06:10,580
And I'm like,
well,

3062
02:06:10,581 --> 02:06:11,340
you know,
we train here,

3063
02:06:11,341 --> 02:06:12,350
we do catch wrestling with,
do they?

3064
02:06:12,460 --> 02:06:13,230
Oh,
okay,

3065
02:06:13,231 --> 02:06:14,430
okay.
And then we'd roll on it,

3066
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:18,870
fucking annihilate them and they'd get 
so pissed and upset and phony Baloney.

3067
02:06:19,510 --> 02:06:21,180
Unfortunately there are.
But you know,

3068
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:25,110
that's a wonderful aspect of humanity if
you've got the ability to,

3069
02:06:25,111 --> 02:06:26,640
uh,
to uh,

3070
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:30,360
to bring truth into the world and be 
honest about shit and you know,

3071
02:06:30,361 --> 02:06:32,850
with all the faults and,
and also great things about it.

3072
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:38,210
Most human beings instinct is to go out 
there and just lie the fuck out of it 

3073
02:06:38,210 --> 02:06:40,770
and just make excuses changed shit 
around because you know,

3074
02:06:40,771 --> 02:06:44,010
it's not good enough to just to have 
things exist and have it be true.

3075
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:45,120
No,
we have to go ahead.

3076
02:06:45,121 --> 02:06:47,400
And I mean,
especially shit like religion,

3077
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:48,540
politics,
it's just,

3078
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:53,930
Oh,
let's make a book and call out the word 

3079
02:06:53,930 --> 02:06:56,511
of God.
So therefore you can't fucking argue 

3080
02:06:56,511 --> 02:06:56,511
against it.
Anything that happens.

3081
02:06:56,511 --> 02:06:56,511
He said,
well,

3082
02:06:56,511 --> 02:06:58,800
the word of God,
the word of God with garbage and then,

3083
02:06:58,801 --> 02:07:03,801
uh,
but essentially have a book that's 

3084
02:07:03,801 --> 02:07:03,801
compiled of other books.
The end,

3085
02:07:03,801 --> 02:07:05,490
you decided to leave other random shit 
out just because,

3086
02:07:05,491 --> 02:07:06,430
and then,
you know,

3087
02:07:06,450 --> 02:07:09,390
it's gone through the hands of all these
other people and all their other agendas

3088
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:14,540
from Jujitsu.
It's because the basic idea of it was a 

3089
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:18,060
human beings all throughout 
civilization.

3090
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:20,670
A full of shit when they flying line 
for,

3091
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:22,320
you know,
obscuring the truth.

3092
02:07:22,350 --> 02:07:25,650
There's a lot of guys that uh,
don't have belts that are like,

3093
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:28,560
like super high level.
Matt Hughes,

3094
02:07:28,890 --> 02:07:29,740
Chris Lidell,
Chris,

3095
02:07:30,190 --> 02:07:32,700
we said Chris was a Brazilian jujitsu 
black belt.

3096
02:07:32,970 --> 02:07:35,770
But apparently that was like even given 
it to us press sheets,

3097
02:07:35,771 --> 02:07:36,130
Brazilian

3098
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:36,880
Jiu Jitsu,
blackbelt,

3099
02:07:36,881 --> 02:07:37,560
Chris Lidell.
No,

3100
02:07:37,610 --> 02:07:38,440
he doesn't have any belt.

3101
02:07:38,690 --> 02:07:39,360
Probably not.
No.

3102
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:40,340
He trained with those.
Uh,

3103
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:44,170
speaking of a bunch of cats wrestlers 
that integrated fighting academy.

3104
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:45,620
Where,
where was that?

3105
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:48,740
That was out in Indianapolis.
That was Jason.

3106
02:07:48,741 --> 02:07:49,570
God sees place.

3107
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:55,760
You're such an interesting case.
Knew because you were there like during 

3108
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:55,950
the dark days,
like you were there,

3109
02:07:55,980 --> 02:08:00,980
like,
like you were there when there was no 

3110
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:03,441
regulation,
you were there when you were allowed to 

3111
02:08:03,441 --> 02:08:03,441
wear shoes,
you know,

3112
02:08:03,441 --> 02:08:05,850
like kicking,
stopping and that you're still here when

3113
02:08:05,851 --> 02:08:06,230
it's not far.

3114
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:08,850
The difference is that,
you know,

3115
02:08:08,851 --> 02:08:11,340
as I've developed as an athlete over the
years,

3116
02:08:11,341 --> 02:08:13,800
but the biggest thing is I developed my 
skills.

3117
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:17,040
So I'm not.
Most of these fighters and you know,

3118
02:08:17,041 --> 02:08:18,900
I'll,
I'll say this and I'll say it publicly,

3119
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:21,660
they have most of these fighters that go
through the system,

3120
02:08:21,661 --> 02:08:23,370
let's say they get good enough that they
get,

3121
02:08:23,371 --> 02:08:24,810
let's say,
to get in the UFC and we'll just use the

3122
02:08:24,811 --> 02:08:25,980
UFC is the,
as the,

3123
02:08:25,981 --> 02:08:28,890
as the standard example,
excuse me.

3124
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:30,410
So what they do is,
uh,

3125
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:35,660
they get to a certain point and they get
to enough a skill wise and then they 

3126
02:08:35,851 --> 02:08:38,100
just improve their athleticism to such a
degree with.

3127
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:39,840
They'll get into the UFC,
let's say,

3128
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:45,140
and let's say they're successful,
they probably have about a two to three 

3129
02:08:45,931 --> 02:08:48,970
year window if they're good enough to be
like a,

3130
02:08:49,010 --> 02:08:51,240
to a,
to get a title or be a title contender.

3131
02:08:51,420 --> 02:08:56,420
If they're that good,
they got about two or three years at 

3132
02:08:56,420 --> 02:08:57,540
which they could potentially get a title
or fight for a title.

3133
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:00,900
And after that then they're never been 
declined.

3134
02:09:01,050 --> 02:09:04,860
And then they might still be successful 
enough to be still a viable,

3135
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:09,920
a fighter in the UFC.
But even that lasts about is about only 

3136
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:13,610
is about as much as five years.
And after that throw them out because 

3137
02:09:13,610 --> 02:09:16,671
they're done.
Their athleticism has dropped enough 

3138
02:09:16,671 --> 02:09:16,671
that they don't have the skills to back 
it up anymore.

3139
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:19,800
Most of these fighters just out athlete 
the other fighter for the most part.

3140
02:09:20,130 --> 02:09:20,850
And,
uh,

3141
02:09:20,910 --> 02:09:24,510
they even did a big statistic about 
fight careers and the,

3142
02:09:24,630 --> 02:09:29,630
once you get to seven years,
the dropoff for success is astronomical 

3143
02:09:29,630 --> 02:09:34,020
and the idea of people going 10 years or
15 years like myself,

3144
02:09:34,590 --> 02:09:36,630
unreal,
like it's almost unheard of.

3145
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:37,800
And uh,

3146
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:42,380
well not only that,
but you go from age 20 to age 35,

3147
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:46,370
19 to 35,
19 was my first time against a pro

3148
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:52,440
and at 35,
you're still amongst the top 

3149
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:52,440
heavyweights in the world.

3150
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:54,440
I could be any of those motherfuckers 
out there walking the earth right now.

3151
02:09:55,570 --> 02:09:58,810
If you had to,
would you,

3152
02:09:58,830 --> 02:10:01,420
I mean,
if you had to retire for any reason,

3153
02:10:01,450 --> 02:10:04,390
would you start coaching because I think
you would have a lot to offer.

3154
02:10:04,420 --> 02:10:06,040
I think you're,
you have,

3155
02:10:06,050 --> 02:10:09,190
um,
just the fact that you've gotten through

3156
02:10:09,191 --> 02:10:12,070
15 years at a very high level,
you know,

3157
02:10:12,071 --> 02:10:15,010
I mean from your time and pride to 
today.

3158
02:10:15,011 --> 02:10:15,520
I mean,
that's a,

3159
02:10:15,810 --> 02:10:18,610
it's a lot of God damn competition 
against very high level guys.

3160
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:22,990
You didn't have a lot of shit that you 
could teach kids that could cut out.

3161
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:28,020
Like you see like a lot of people that 
are being coached and being coached by 

3162
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:31,801
people that don't have nearly the kind 
of experience that you have and you see 

3163
02:10:31,801 --> 02:10:31,801
some mistakes they're making with young 
talent.

3164
02:10:31,801 --> 02:10:31,801
Sure,

3165
02:10:31,801 --> 02:10:33,380
I do.
I see a lot of mistakes.

3166
02:10:33,381 --> 02:10:38,381
And in terms of coaching,
it's not just even about technique 

3167
02:10:38,381 --> 02:10:38,540
necessarily.
A lot of it is they,

3168
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:43,700
they create a system and they think that
everybody has to fit within that system 

3169
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:44,870
and that there is no,
there is no wavering from that system.

3170
02:10:44,871 --> 02:10:47,690
And the thing is not any.
Everybody is different.

3171
02:10:48,050 --> 02:10:50,540
Everybody's an individual and everybody 
needs to be coached differently.

3172
02:10:50,541 --> 02:10:53,180
I've had a and I have coached through 
the years and I've,

3173
02:10:53,181 --> 02:10:55,670
I've coached people,
the world championship fights,

3174
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:57,680
I've coached people to the world titles.
I've had a,

3175
02:10:57,681 --> 02:11:02,681
I think I've had more women at one time 
ranked in the top 10 and some,

3176
02:11:03,010 --> 02:11:08,010
most of them ranked in the top five of 
the world and their respective way 

3177
02:11:08,010 --> 02:11:11,471
classes than any other coach.
And then the baby food Fuji was making 

3178
02:11:11,471 --> 02:11:11,471
Fuji Jenelle Marquez.
Shana Bassler.

3179
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:12,400
I've,
we're going to hit told me,

3180
02:11:12,401 --> 02:11:14,300
you know,
uh,

3181
02:11:14,930 --> 02:11:16,760
let's see.
Uh,

3182
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,230
so are you,
are you want you,

3183
02:11:18,370 --> 02:11:20,130
that what you want to do when you start 
fighting?

3184
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:21,020
No,
no,

3185
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:26,670
because I was thinking that you didn't 
know a real shame because there's not a 

3186
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:31,521
lot of guys who are fighters but have 
also taken the time to really sort of 

3187
02:11:32,641 --> 02:11:35,470
intellectually breakdown the properties 
of creating a fight.

3188
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:40,510
I don't want to be a coach like that.
I just don't because if I'm going to be 

3189
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:46,720
a coach,
think of it more as like an old school 

3190
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:48,080
boxing coach or maybe one of these old 
catch coaches where you only really,

3191
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:53,200
okay.
Someone proves to you enough that 

3192
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:53,390
they're worth giving that kind of time 
and information.

3193
02:11:53,391 --> 02:11:56,510
I don't just look at it as well,
I'm just going to show you some move.

3194
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:00,110
By the way,
this move came from this coach came from

3195
02:12:00,111 --> 02:12:05,111
that coach came.
Do you know how many hundreds of years 

3196
02:12:05,111 --> 02:12:07,241
of development came behind this?
Do you know how difficult it was for 

3197
02:12:07,241 --> 02:12:11,591
someone to the original person down the 
line to get this thing to me with the 

3198
02:12:11,591 --> 02:12:14,831
shit that they had to go through and to 
live their life and to harness these 

3199
02:12:14,831 --> 02:12:16,370
techniques and give them to me.
These things are precious,

3200
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:20,590
so I understand that,
but when I see a guy like you and I see,

3201
02:12:20,591 --> 02:12:22,300
you know,
you have 35 years of age.

3202
02:12:22,301 --> 02:12:24,880
I mean totally respectfully and 
honestly.

3203
02:12:24,881 --> 02:12:26,500
I mean,
what do you got five years left?

3204
02:12:26,501 --> 02:12:27,450
Ten years left.
If you're,

3205
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:29,470
I guess Randy coture style,
I'm done.

3206
02:12:29,620 --> 02:12:30,720
You never know.
You know what I mean?

3207
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:34,270
With today it was nutrition and training
methods.

3208
02:12:34,330 --> 02:12:37,090
Who knows with skill,
but when,

3209
02:12:37,270 --> 02:12:41,200
if a guy like you got a hold of John 
Jones type character,

3210
02:12:41,620 --> 02:12:43,780
you could take a motherfucker to the 
next level.

3211
02:12:43,810 --> 02:12:45,190
You know what I mean?
If you,

3212
02:12:45,191 --> 02:12:49,560
if you really started like approaching.
Okay,

3213
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:51,400
Jon Jones,
is it an anomaly?

3214
02:12:51,401 --> 02:12:53,200
He's just,
he's a bad motherfucker.

3215
02:12:53,230 --> 02:12:54,820
He,
anybody could make him good.

3216
02:12:54,850 --> 02:12:57,160
Yes and no.
Yes,

3217
02:12:57,220 --> 02:13:02,220
and without a doubt.
Mike Winkeljohn has done some amazing 

3218
02:13:02,220 --> 02:13:03,880
things.
Without a doubt.

3219
02:13:03,881 --> 02:13:05,200
He's brilliant.
Without a doubt,

3220
02:13:05,201 --> 02:13:07,080
John is a prodigy.
John is a.

3221
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:11,260
he's a very intense,
powerful human being.

3222
02:13:11,290 --> 02:13:13,840
John Jones,
besides his physicality,

3223
02:13:13,841 --> 02:13:17,380
which is obviously very gifted,
his mind is very powerful and I think he

3224
02:13:17,381 --> 02:13:20,290
would be great that he would figure it 
out watching other people,

3225
02:13:20,291 --> 02:13:21,460
no matter who was coaching,
he,

3226
02:13:21,461 --> 02:13:23,800
he's the kind of guy that's going to 
excel no matter what.

3227
02:13:23,890 --> 02:13:27,700
But having a guy like Winkeljohn who's a
brilliant striking code,

3228
02:13:27,710 --> 02:13:30,230
they really different being

3229
02:13:30,230 --> 02:13:32,030
somebody that like,

3230
02:13:32,030 --> 02:13:37,030
you know,
taking that middle of the pack guy and 

3231
02:13:37,030 --> 02:13:39,771
that one and developing them into a 
world champion that's always going to 

3232
02:13:39,771 --> 02:13:39,810
get that.
You'll never be.

3233
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:40,860
But it depends.
I mean,

3234
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:42,150
and that's what I'm saying is I'm not 
going to.

3235
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:44,370
Because there's a lot going on there,
right?

3236
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:47,220
I'm not talking necessarily about who I 
would coach.

3237
02:13:47,221 --> 02:13:49,110
You just be like the ones that just 
shine as.

3238
02:13:49,111 --> 02:13:50,370
No,
I want to coach.

3239
02:13:50,371 --> 02:13:52,530
I would coach a person that I feel 
personality,

3240
02:13:52,531 --> 02:13:57,531
integrity,
character mentality as well as 

3241
02:13:57,531 --> 02:13:59,190
physicality all matches what I think is 
worth investing the time into.

3242
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:00,900
So you would do that,
but they would have to.

3243
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:05,920
He'd be like special people came onto up
on the mountain top when you're alone 

3244
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:07,820
fucking chopping wood and then you will 
make them like fences and shit.

3245
02:14:08,270 --> 02:14:09,020
Right?
You know,

3246
02:14:09,021 --> 02:14:12,320
I wax on carbon carbon.
Some ruins into their body.

3247
02:14:12,321 --> 02:14:15,180
So you're going to do it like we go 
chapel really style still works,

3248
02:14:15,330 --> 02:14:18,020
still works with Mac Danzig.
He works at a few people,

3249
02:14:18,021 --> 02:14:19,720
but he's not the man.
I,

3250
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:24,800
I,
that's one of those guys I have a shit 

3251
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:24,800
ton of respect for.
I do have one.

3252
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:25,220
I think Ricoh is um,
often,

3253
02:14:25,670 --> 02:14:28,250
you know,
he's so unknown to so many of these guys

3254
02:14:28,251 --> 02:14:30,050
out there that claim to be mma 
aficionados.

3255
02:14:30,051 --> 02:14:31,820
They just don't know their ass from a 
hole in the wall.

3256
02:14:31,821 --> 02:14:36,821
It really don't know.
And that there's people out there like 

3257
02:14:36,821 --> 02:14:38,210
Rico who's wrestling is fantastic.
Who's mind to fighting is great.

3258
02:14:38,211 --> 02:14:39,740
Who,
whose attitude is,

3259
02:14:40,130 --> 02:14:45,130
you know,
you want to get in there with this and 

3260
02:14:45,130 --> 02:14:45,130
this is what you want to do.
I can,

3261
02:14:45,130 --> 02:14:48,520
I can help you with that and I can show 
you if you're going to fucking slack 

3262
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:48,520
off,
fuck around,

3263
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:49,190
whatever you think you know better than 
all,

3264
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:50,300
then fuck you.
Then take off.

3265
02:14:50,301 --> 02:14:50,870
I don't need you.

3266
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:56,080
And he smokes weed all day or day or a 
day to day and he will choke you all 

3267
02:14:59,121 --> 02:15:00,260
day.
Fuck your shit.

3268
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:04,700
And I really respect Mac Danzig a lot.
I like Mac as a human being.

3269
02:15:04,701 --> 02:15:05,880
I think he's really,
he's just,

3270
02:15:05,910 --> 02:15:08,060
he's just a solid dude.
I love that guy.

3271
02:15:08,061 --> 02:15:13,061
I know he's grumpy,
but he's just because he's smart as 

3272
02:15:13,061 --> 02:15:13,400
fuck.
He's always super cool to me too.

3273
02:15:13,610 --> 02:15:16,020
He just has a low tolerance for dummies.
I still do.

3274
02:15:16,060 --> 02:15:18,380
I really do.
I can't stand fucking idiots.

3275
02:15:18,381 --> 02:15:21,350
But Matt speaks so highly of Rico,
you know,

3276
02:15:21,351 --> 02:15:23,630
and what Rico is done and helping as he 
should.

3277
02:15:23,631 --> 02:15:24,440
Yeah.
But I just,

3278
02:15:24,441 --> 02:15:26,510
as a coach,
there's so much investment

3279
02:15:26,650 --> 02:15:30,110
goes into that and that it's not 
something I'm,

3280
02:15:30,170 --> 02:15:32,700
I'm not saying I won't coach.
Uh,

3281
02:15:32,710 --> 02:15:36,500
and if the availability is there a and 
the possibility is there,

3282
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:39,450
but I just,
I got a lot of Shit,

3283
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:42,860
you know what I'm done with fighting a 
whenever that day comes,

3284
02:15:42,861 --> 02:15:45,350
which is going to suck in its own right.
But uh,

3285
02:15:46,250 --> 02:15:49,040
I got other shit I can do with my life.
Other things I'm trying to accomplish,

3286
02:15:49,041 --> 02:15:49,390
you know?
Um,

3287
02:15:49,410 --> 02:15:51,050
I mean a male model.

3288
02:15:51,850 --> 02:15:56,850
Well,
little underwear modeling perhaps a 

3289
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:56,850
little bit,
little bit,

3290
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:56,850
little bit.
I mean we got to do a lot of padding,

3291
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:58,900
but I think we can make the most of it.
I mean,

3292
02:15:58,901 --> 02:16:01,420
prosthetics are pretty impressive.
Don't go prosthetic,

3293
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:03,670
but the little dick,
but a big smile.

3294
02:16:03,710 --> 02:16:05,290
Oh man,
fuck it.

3295
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:08,170
Little Little Chubby.
A little turtle or let it swing.

3296
02:16:08,390 --> 02:16:10,420
It gives a fuck.
You're Josh Barnett.

3297
02:16:10,790 --> 02:16:15,790
Still Suck it.
But the easier so much just you ever 

3298
02:16:15,790 --> 02:16:20,130
watch a porn when the guys get a little 
dick and this girl's like licking his 

3299
02:16:20,130 --> 02:16:20,130
bowl.
She's already in so happy about it.

3300
02:16:20,130 --> 02:16:21,910
It's like an easy,
easy deal and it's just,

3301
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:23,800
it's a,
it's more like convenience.

3302
02:16:23,890 --> 02:16:24,970
Yeah.
The guy with the little deck,

3303
02:16:24,971 --> 02:16:26,760
like maybe there's a benefit to that,
like the sheer,

3304
02:16:26,761 --> 02:16:28,630
now she's deep throat and him and it's,
you know,

3305
02:16:28,631 --> 02:16:30,040
it's not that impressive,
but it

3306
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,230
looks like he's having a good time and,
and she's like,

3307
02:16:32,231 --> 02:16:33,620
this is,
this is not straining.

3308
02:16:33,730 --> 02:16:38,730
Stressing me.
One of dudes with John Hancock's feel 

3309
02:16:38,730 --> 02:16:38,730
more pleasure because there's more 
pleasure.

3310
02:16:38,730 --> 02:16:39,100
Just more skin,
more,

3311
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:41,320
more,
more skin is getting close.

3312
02:16:41,321 --> 02:16:43,750
Like if a girl's giving you a blow job 
and she goes in deeper,

3313
02:16:43,751 --> 02:16:45,880
it feels better than if she's shallow.
Right?

3314
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:47,720
It's definitely something that's mental 
commodities.

3315
02:16:47,721 --> 02:16:50,320
Even chick begin feeling it hit the back
and she keep going.

3316
02:16:50,350 --> 02:16:54,080
So you're like,
oh wow.

3317
02:16:54,370 --> 02:16:57,220
We just.
The idea of it alone,

3318
02:16:57,221 --> 02:16:58,530
someone's willing to suck on your 
tablet.

3319
02:16:58,590 --> 02:17:00,550
I only half mast right now.

3320
02:17:00,690 --> 02:17:01,520
I'm,
I'm ready.

3321
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:04,090
If you had the girl like where you go so
far and they start like puking,

3322
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:09,100
like the stomach acid all over your 
mouth during the porn movies today in 

3323
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:09,990
the wrong girls.
How am I started up?

3324
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:15,500
They got to relax yourself,
I guess to get these girls to throw up 

3325
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:15,500
on your Dick.
That's like bio and stuff.

3326
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:19,180
It feels good actually.
It's awesome.

3327
02:17:19,310 --> 02:17:20,260
What if they don't?
Uh,

3328
02:17:20,330 --> 02:17:25,330
if those girls don't,
they don't watch their diet and they're 

3329
02:17:25,330 --> 02:17:27,710
probably like all anorexic and signs of 
like weird cat food all over it.

3330
02:17:29,750 --> 02:17:31,590
Fuck,
are you talking about cat food?

3331
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:33,560
Maybe I'd eight different girls.
And you do,

3332
02:17:33,710 --> 02:17:38,710
but everybody does a who hates cats.
He dates cats day cats,

3333
02:17:40,310 --> 02:17:41,870
cat food.
There are so finicky.

3334
02:17:41,910 --> 02:17:42,950
You did it again.

3335
02:17:44,060 --> 02:17:45,820
It took it to a bad place.
Where,

3336
02:17:45,821 --> 02:17:50,821
uh,
where were we going with this before we 

3337
02:17:50,821 --> 02:17:50,821
got on a blow jobs and small Dicks,
I don't know.

3338
02:17:50,821 --> 02:17:54,790
Terrible places.
One of the things that you wanted to 

3339
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:54,790
talk about when you,
you,

3340
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:54,790
you,
uh,

3341
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:59,160
contacted me about coming on the podcast
is all this craziness that's going on 

3342
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:01,300
with all these school shootings and 
school shootings.

3343
02:18:01,301 --> 02:18:01,800
It was the,
uh,

3344
02:18:01,801 --> 02:18:06,801
the Oregon shooting.
I guess that one was in a mall and all 

3345
02:18:06,801 --> 02:18:06,801
this shit.
Yeah.

3346
02:18:06,801 --> 02:18:11,570
Well,
and the interesting thing about the 

3347
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:11,570
mall,
one that's coming out now is that he was

3348
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:13,900
confronted by an armed civilian and 
that's when he shot himself.

3349
02:18:14,530 --> 02:18:17,680
And that's not something that's being 
talked about very much.

3350
02:18:18,190 --> 02:18:23,190
Why would they?
That doesn't work with the agenda at 

3351
02:18:23,190 --> 02:18:23,190
hand of why.
And you know,

3352
02:18:23,190 --> 02:18:24,070
that's,
that's hard of a problem,

3353
02:18:24,071 --> 02:18:29,071
right?
A huge problem is that we've got media 

3354
02:18:29,071 --> 02:18:29,790
that wants to just create knee jerk 
reactions and emotional responses.

3355
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:33,610
They don't care about trying to deliver 
a whole unbiased story.

3356
02:18:33,611 --> 02:18:38,500
They've each got an agenda to try and 
put a rift in the populace at general at

3357
02:18:38,501 --> 02:18:43,501
large.
And that's fucking irresponsible and is 

3358
02:18:43,501 --> 02:18:43,501
terrible.
I was listening to a,

3359
02:18:43,501 --> 02:18:48,220
something that would come on about a,
it was either MSNBC or CNN and after the

3360
02:18:48,221 --> 02:18:49,750
horrible Sandy Hook,
tragedy,

3361
02:18:50,170 --> 02:18:51,670
uh,
one of the teachers,

3362
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:57,120
boyfriends have a year.
They found him and started giving their 

3363
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:58,670
full interview on.
I'm just going,

3364
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:01,630
why I don't want to.
This is completely one.

3365
02:19:01,631 --> 02:19:04,480
It's just giving more prudent credence 
to,

3366
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:09,750
hey,
you want to do something crazy and be 

3367
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:09,820
fucking famous forever.
Here's more publicity for you.

3368
02:19:09,821 --> 02:19:10,200
It's like,
well,

3369
02:19:10,210 --> 02:19:12,310
you didn't have anything else better to 
do than talk to a guy.

3370
02:19:12,311 --> 02:19:14,020
Oh,
I knew her for a year.

3371
02:19:14,021 --> 02:19:17,170
And like you were some guy,
some guy for a year,

3372
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:19,480
it wasn't even crying,
like you didn't even miss her.

3373
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:21,790
It was like,
it was no big deal and he was on CNN.

3374
02:19:21,791 --> 02:19:23,220
Maybe he really did fucking,
you know,

3375
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:24,970
he was super torn up about it,
whatever.

3376
02:19:24,971 --> 02:19:28,100
But it doesn't fucking matter because 
why are you on TV?

3377
02:19:28,101 --> 02:19:31,880
Why is the news finding that to be 
important to talk about?

3378
02:19:31,881 --> 02:19:34,070
Why shouldn't we be talking about 
something more important?

3379
02:19:34,071 --> 02:19:39,071
Like why is our culture devolving in 
such a way that people are acting in 

3380
02:19:39,861 --> 02:19:44,861
such manner,
whether they're shooting people or 

3381
02:19:44,861 --> 02:19:48,340
fucking stabbing them or robbing them or
car jacking him and taking them back to 

3382
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:50,660
a place and raping and torturing him.
Like what the fuck is going on?

3383
02:19:50,661 --> 02:19:52,660
Why?
Why is humanity at large doing this kind

3384
02:19:52,661 --> 02:19:53,810
of shit?
And then the other thing,

3385
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:59,200
so another channel.
I'm sitting here and I just hear it 

3386
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:00,860
coming into the ears and I hear they're 
talking about how some Republican,

3387
02:20:00,861 --> 02:20:01,400
his,
you know,

3388
02:20:01,401 --> 02:20:06,401
he keeps,
he throws out the word assault weapon 

3389
02:20:06,401 --> 02:20:06,401
like 17 times.

3390
02:20:06,401 --> 02:20:06,401
Uh,
every,

3391
02:20:06,401 --> 02:20:07,280
every fucking statement he's got to 
make.

3392
02:20:07,281 --> 02:20:09,280
He's really trying to pin,
you know,

3393
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:13,410
pound something home with his lingo and 
then there's a,

3394
02:20:13,480 --> 02:20:16,840
the reporter goes on after talking about
this guy who was gonna,

3395
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:21,850
you know,
probably working towards creating bills 

3396
02:20:21,850 --> 02:20:24,161
about this ship will,
she'll probably be back ended with all 

3397
02:20:24,161 --> 02:20:24,161
kinds of shit that have nothing to do 
with it,

3398
02:20:24,161 --> 02:20:25,610
which they always do,
always,

3399
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:30,670
you know,
it's just fucking absolute tantamount 

3400
02:20:30,670 --> 02:20:30,670
lying.
It's absolute fucking lying.

3401
02:20:30,670 --> 02:20:33,110
Irresponsible.
And it should be absolutely anil loud.

3402
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:34,580
So.
So after that,

3403
02:20:34,870 --> 02:20:36,770
this,
this reporter goes on about,

3404
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:38,450
you know,
something about,

3405
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:43,720
you know,
people go and makes an offhand comment 

3406
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:46,181
about people going to gun shows and just
not just willy nilly buying firearms and

3407
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:48,750
in that,
just like,

3408
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:51,130
I just couldn't fucking take it anymore.
Didn't Bruno true.

3409
02:20:51,131 --> 02:20:52,040
Proven.
That's true.

3410
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:55,700
Didn't he go to a gun store as a gay 
character?

3411
02:20:56,030 --> 02:20:56,600
Didn't?
Uh,

3412
02:20:57,470 --> 02:20:58,970
I dunno,
I haven't seen the movie.

3413
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:01,340
I mean,
but here's the deal.

3414
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:02,770
I guess it wasn't in Bruno was on the 
show.

3415
02:21:02,790 --> 02:21:03,460
I,
uh,

3416
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:05,170
I,
you know,

3417
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:10,180
who knows what they're doing on shows 
the people you can people have sold 

3418
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:12,250
potentially.
I could see it a fucking shady stuff.

3419
02:21:12,310 --> 02:21:14,030
Yeah.
But people will sell guns,

3420
02:21:14,070 --> 02:21:15,740
not at gun shows.
They get some other way.

3421
02:21:15,741 --> 02:21:16,460
I mean,
fuck.

3422
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:21,520
So here's the deal.
I am a lifelong hobbyist when it comes 

3423
02:21:22,941 --> 02:21:23,940
to firearms.
I,

3424
02:21:23,941 --> 02:21:24,220
it was,
uh,

3425
02:21:24,221 --> 02:21:27,770
it was something I inherited from my dad
who a big time hobbyist.

3426
02:21:27,771 --> 02:21:30,380
And when I say hobbyist,
I reload.

3427
02:21:30,381 --> 02:21:35,381
Meaning I make my own ammunition.
Like I buy bullets have different 

3428
02:21:35,381 --> 02:21:40,271
weights and shapes and sizes.
I buy different types of powders to have

3429
02:21:40,521 --> 02:21:42,110
to burn at different rates.
And you know,

3430
02:21:42,111 --> 02:21:43,460
all this shit is very.
Exactly.

3431
02:21:43,461 --> 02:21:48,461
I Buy Bras and primers and I match all 
this shit up based on recipes through,

3432
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:49,570
uh,
the,

3433
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:54,440
the ammunition manufacturers that sell 
this stuff through my dad's own research

3434
02:21:54,441 --> 02:21:55,370
on certain,
you know.

3435
02:21:55,370 --> 02:22:00,370
And the thing is every firearm that 
you're doing this for is entirely 

3436
02:22:00,370 --> 02:22:01,010
different.
You could have three,

3437
02:22:01,011 --> 02:22:01,700
19,
11,

3438
02:22:01,701 --> 02:22:03,980
45,
all the same barrel length,

3439
02:22:03,981 --> 02:22:08,981
all the same manufacturer,
but they're not all going to shoot the 

3440
02:22:08,981 --> 02:22:11,711
same.
Not exactly in one load is going to 

3441
02:22:11,711 --> 02:22:13,931
shoot different than the other other.
Some bullet weights depending on barrel 

3442
02:22:13,931 --> 02:22:15,440
length.
The amount of rifling has gone nuts.

3443
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:16,910
I'm a gun nut.
Okay.

3444
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,710
And uh,
you know,

3445
02:22:18,711 --> 02:22:21,710
I grew up not only with that but my dad 
inherited from,

3446
02:22:21,711 --> 02:22:24,400
from people in his life,
the hobby of,

3447
02:22:24,430 --> 02:22:27,240
of target shooting and,
and,

3448
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:32,330
you know,
gun smithing and creating your and just 

3449
02:22:32,330 --> 02:22:32,330
being a,
just a nerd about guns.

3450
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:36,210
Like I'm a nerd about cars,
but he was a hunter.

3451
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:38,250
And when,
when,

3452
02:22:38,251 --> 02:22:39,420
uh,
and he was growing up,

3453
02:22:39,421 --> 02:22:42,140
that's what you did.
He grew up in the fucking woods of,

3454
02:22:42,340 --> 02:22:44,610
of southwestern Washington.

3455
02:22:44,890 --> 02:22:49,890
Uh,
he was a logger from as early as he 

3456
02:22:49,890 --> 02:22:49,890
could.
He worked in paper mills.

3457
02:22:49,890 --> 02:22:51,780
He's been in the forest all his whole 
fucking life almost.

3458
02:22:51,781 --> 02:22:54,090
And so hunting,
fishing game,

3459
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:55,880
all that kind of stuff.
And uh,

3460
02:22:56,130 --> 02:23:01,130
you know,
I've been out there in the woods with 

3461
02:23:01,130 --> 02:23:01,130
him since I was a kid going hunting and 
catch,

3462
02:23:01,130 --> 02:23:01,620
you know,
getting animals,

3463
02:23:01,770 --> 02:23:03,090
cleaning them,
dressing.

3464
02:23:03,091 --> 02:23:05,760
I'm going through the whole process and 
I can tell you one thing.

3465
02:23:06,090 --> 02:23:11,090
Fucking being a hunter and being 
somebody that had spent so much time in 

3466
02:23:11,090 --> 02:23:11,790
the wilderness and Anon,
the Anon,

3467
02:23:11,791 --> 02:23:16,791
the ocean and boats fishing and all this
made me appreciate nature like a 

3468
02:23:16,791 --> 02:23:20,220
gazillion times more than I think 
anybody that doesn't necessarily.

3469
02:23:20,221 --> 02:23:25,221
I think nature is something that is 
overlooked huge and I don't think we as 

3470
02:23:25,770 --> 02:23:30,770
humans sometimes really understand the 
vastness and the impressiveness of of 

3471
02:23:31,141 --> 02:23:36,141
mother earth as a general and you know,
being out there in the mountains and 

3472
02:23:36,141 --> 02:23:37,080
seeing the animals and the uniting when 
you're hunting them.

3473
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:42,080
Just being involved in this whole 
process and just knowing them and then 

3474
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:43,610
taking an animal and going through that 
whole process of,

3475
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:48,640
of all the care and responsibility that 
comes to to do this correctly and then 

3476
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:50,060
serve this meat to other people.
And when,

3477
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:52,710
when my family didn't have money,
when they're broke as fuck.

3478
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:57,800
The animals that my dad had caught help 
feed that family that my.

3479
02:23:58,670 --> 02:24:03,670
They're all broke living in this little 
apartment in north Seattle and no 

3480
02:24:03,670 --> 02:24:08,200
unexcused.
They go out there with their tags and 

3481
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:08,200
they'd get their,
their,

3482
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:08,200
their,
their elk or they get their deer.

3483
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:09,480
They would,
they would catch fish,

3484
02:24:09,481 --> 02:24:11,080
they would grouse all the,
you know,

3485
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:12,870
fuck,
that all went onto the table,

3486
02:24:13,410 --> 02:24:15,160
you know,
and that was a big part of that,

3487
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:19,560
that growing up for me.
And so I've had gun responsibility.

3488
02:24:19,770 --> 02:24:24,540
I've been shooting since I was a kid and
being a responsible parent is why,

3489
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:29,960
uh,
from the get like one guns were always 

3490
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:29,960
locked up.

3491
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:34,360
They're always in safes.
I don't know how to get into these 

3492
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:34,470
fucking things.
I'm not allowed access to this shit as a

3493
02:24:34,471 --> 02:24:37,240
child or even as an 18 year old,
like that ain't happening.

3494
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:42,260
Like I didn't know that the combination 
to my dad's gun safe until I was almost 

3495
02:24:42,691 --> 02:24:44,910
30 years old,
you know what I mean?

3496
02:24:44,970 --> 02:24:48,660
And other than that mean if there was a 
possibility,

3497
02:24:48,661 --> 02:24:50,700
let's say,
and I didn't know because this was never

3498
02:24:50,701 --> 02:24:55,701
spoken about,
if there was even the potential that 

3499
02:24:55,701 --> 02:24:55,800
there was a firearm,
let's say for home defense,

3500
02:24:55,801 --> 02:24:58,170
that was somewhere,
let's say in my parents room,

3501
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:01,650
but I didn't know about through the fear
of fucking God,

3502
02:25:01,651 --> 02:25:06,651
I wouldn't step in there.
My Dad had me so afraid of fucking with 

3503
02:25:06,651 --> 02:25:10,860
his shit or anything in their room as a 
responsible parent.

3504
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:13,710
That never happened.
I knew fucking way better.

3505
02:25:13,711 --> 02:25:18,711
And the idea if I ever,
if he ever found out if I ever laid 

3506
02:25:18,711 --> 02:25:21,060
hands on a gun that he wasn't around.
Alright,

3507
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:24,320
well you what you're ascribing sounds 
like an ideal situation

3508
02:25:24,350 --> 02:25:27,590
to grow up and raise someone in an 
environment where you teach them firearm

3509
02:25:27,591 --> 02:25:30,590
safety and respect for firearms and 
appreciation for firearm.

3510
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:32,750
Absolutely.
The real debate is not that though.

3511
02:25:32,751 --> 02:25:35,000
The real debate is the fact that if the 
guns are out there,

3512
02:25:35,001 --> 02:25:40,001
it's not just you and you're responsible
parents that are going to have these 

3513
02:25:40,001 --> 02:25:43,241
guns.
It's this crazy motherfucker in 

3514
02:25:43,241 --> 02:25:43,241
Connecticut and is nutty mother that he 
killed.

3515
02:25:43,241 --> 02:25:45,230
And then took her guns and shot up all 
those poor kids.

3516
02:25:45,260 --> 02:25:50,260
Absolutely.
That's the where the real issue comes 

3517
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:50,260
in.
It's like,

3518
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:50,660
well,
how do you stop that from happening?

3519
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:51,380
Exactly.
And,

3520
02:25:51,381 --> 02:25:52,130
and I,
uh,

3521
02:25:52,210 --> 02:25:55,700
and through through all this,
and I'm a time spent,

3522
02:25:55,740 --> 02:25:57,860
you know,
actually having firearms as a hobby.

3523
02:25:58,640 --> 02:25:59,200
I,
uh,

3524
02:25:59,490 --> 02:26:04,490
you know,
I ended up working in the industry of 

3525
02:26:04,490 --> 02:26:06,530
selling firearms and buying them through
a thrift shop and,

3526
02:26:06,531 --> 02:26:07,550
uh,
in Washington.

3527
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:12,580
And uh,
I can tell you like everything that went

3528
02:26:12,921 --> 02:26:15,350
through that shop,
everything that was ever done all had to

3529
02:26:15,351 --> 02:26:17,900
go through the federal program,
the,

3530
02:26:19,050 --> 02:26:21,230
the instant criminal,
national,

3531
02:26:21,231 --> 02:26:22,730
instant criminal background check 
system.

3532
02:26:22,731 --> 02:26:27,590
The Knicks and I had to call in every 
fucking thing every single time.

3533
02:26:27,770 --> 02:26:30,420
And this whole thing was insistent in pr
in,

3534
02:26:30,500 --> 02:26:35,500
in the system for a reason.
And I can't say that it's perfect 

3535
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:37,010
because I know it ain't,
it's a federal government,

3536
02:26:37,011 --> 02:26:38,540
you know,
there's no way that it's perfect.

3537
02:26:38,541 --> 02:26:39,430
In fact,
you know,

3538
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,870
reading the information on Nick's,
you know,

3539
02:26:41,871 --> 02:26:42,790
they like to claim that,
uh,

3540
02:26:42,791 --> 02:26:43,430
over,
you know,

3541
02:26:43,431 --> 02:26:44,720
since uh,
being put in,

3542
02:26:44,721 --> 02:26:48,140
in [inaudible] 93,
there's a over 100 million checks in the

3543
02:26:48,140 --> 02:26:49,460
last decade leading the morning,
700,000

3544
02:26:49,490 --> 02:26:52,310
denials of firearms in the hands of 
people that it shouldn't be.

3545
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:57,700
But the problem is that you look at some
of this stuff and what the things that 

3546
02:26:57,700 --> 02:27:00,761
they might deny you for sometimes 
there's the simple issue of I'm a 

3547
02:27:01,861 --> 02:27:04,610
concealed weapons owner or a permit 
holder in Washington,

3548
02:27:04,611 --> 02:27:06,440
which means I already had to go through 
fingerprinting.

3549
02:27:06,441 --> 02:27:11,441
I had to fill out all this paperwork.
I had to go through a process and get 

3550
02:27:11,441 --> 02:27:11,450
approved to get my concealed weapons 
permit.

3551
02:27:12,170 --> 02:27:14,360
And uh,
when that meant,

3552
02:27:14,361 --> 02:27:17,420
when I went to a gun store,
even the one I worked at a,

3553
02:27:17,421 --> 02:27:22,421
if I want to purchase a handgun,
which normally has a waiting period 

3554
02:27:22,421 --> 02:27:23,240
because I'm a concealed weapons permit 
holder and I've already gone through all

3555
02:27:23,241 --> 02:27:28,241
these extra checks.
I fill out all the paperwork like 

3556
02:27:28,241 --> 02:27:28,241
everyone else had.
All gets filed with the serial number of

3557
02:27:28,241 --> 02:27:30,260
the gun.
And what I'm purchasing and so on and so

3558
02:27:30,261 --> 02:27:35,261
forth and uh,
and I still go through the next check 

3559
02:27:35,261 --> 02:27:37,900
list like everybody else,
but because there was somebody in 

3560
02:27:37,900 --> 02:27:42,070
California who had a similar name to 
mind every time I would call in with my 

3561
02:27:42,070 --> 02:27:43,820
social security number of my weapons 
license number,

3562
02:27:43,821 --> 02:27:48,080
like all this different information and 
data for at least three years.

3563
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:52,190
I was always put on a hold with every 
firearm I bought.

3564
02:27:52,191 --> 02:27:55,700
And even if that included a rifle,
which is normally a same day thing after

3565
02:27:55,701 --> 02:28:00,701
nick's all every single time because 
they would always see that there's some 

3566
02:28:00,701 --> 02:28:05,140
stuff in it and they will always in.
The thing about it is the fact that 

3567
02:28:05,140 --> 02:28:07,220
there's a hold put on that could last 
anywhere from,

3568
02:28:07,470 --> 02:28:12,470
you know,
three hours they might call back or you 

3569
02:28:12,470 --> 02:28:12,470
know,
three days.

3570
02:28:12,470 --> 02:28:13,580
It wasn't having a whole.
That was,

3571
02:28:13,610 --> 02:28:15,620
that ever bothered me whatsoever.
It's like,

3572
02:28:15,621 --> 02:28:16,430
okay,
whatever.

3573
02:28:16,670 --> 02:28:19,250
It's just that there isn't like why 
isn't this not being updated?

3574
02:28:19,251 --> 02:28:24,251
Like you're being given very specific 
information about me as a person.

3575
02:28:24,620 --> 02:28:27,400
So I want my,
you know,

3576
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:32,410
if I'm going to have this database is 
going to be used to try and be a 

3577
02:28:32,410 --> 02:28:36,820
responsible about having firearms,
not in the hands of people that it 

3578
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:36,820
shouldn't be.

3579
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:39,470
Why are you not updating this enough to 
know that I'm not that fucking guy.

3580
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:44,680
And eventually three years,
two or three years later down the road 

3581
02:28:44,680 --> 02:28:45,440
it came about and now that's not the 
case anymore for me,

3582
02:28:45,441 --> 02:28:48,440
far as I know I haven't bought a Po,
a purchase a firearm in a long time.

3583
02:28:48,830 --> 02:28:53,830
But uh,
and then when it came to going to gun 

3584
02:28:53,830 --> 02:28:53,830
shows,
which I've been a member,

3585
02:28:53,830 --> 02:28:57,670
I've been going to gun shows since I was
a kid because my dad would go there and 

3586
02:28:57,670 --> 02:29:00,430
my uncle and you know.
And then even especially when I worked 

3587
02:29:00,430 --> 02:29:00,590
for the gun shop,
I would go there and help out at shows.

3588
02:29:00,591 --> 02:29:03,410
Maybe if we had a table,
a different stuff.

3589
02:29:04,370 --> 02:29:07,160
You go to a gun show and even as a 
concealed weapons license holder,

3590
02:29:07,161 --> 02:29:09,050
I mean anybody that comes to the gun 
show,

3591
02:29:09,051 --> 02:29:10,020
you pay your admission,
boom,

3592
02:29:10,021 --> 02:29:15,021
you can come in if you want to purchase 
a firearm and this goes for the 

3593
02:29:15,021 --> 02:29:18,311
Washington arms collector association 
who runs all their gun shows and 

3594
02:29:18,311 --> 02:29:20,771
Washington.
You have to go and do another line and 

3595
02:29:20,771 --> 02:29:23,921
fill out and have all your paperwork,
whereas you have the same in every 

3596
02:29:23,921 --> 02:29:26,831
state.
I'm not sure now I cannot speak for 

3597
02:29:26,831 --> 02:29:29,021
every state,
but I know that me growing up as a 

3598
02:29:29,021 --> 02:29:31,200
working and being a part of the 
Washington arms collector association 

3599
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:31,200
and all that and going to their gun 
shows,

3600
02:29:31,290 --> 02:29:33,980
uh,
you have to go get nicks checked.

3601
02:29:34,630 --> 02:29:35,950
Well that's all well and good man.
But,

3602
02:29:35,951 --> 02:29:38,020
and,
and how do you stop letting this kid who

3603
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:39,430
did this in Connecticut?
I mean,

3604
02:29:39,431 --> 02:29:41,470
he violated a bunch.
He approached.

3605
02:29:41,730 --> 02:29:44,320
He already started leaving the house.
He started off off

3606
02:29:44,420 --> 02:29:46,030
by murdering his mom.
Yeah,

3607
02:29:46,290 --> 02:29:47,700
that's already,
that's not good.

3608
02:29:47,850 --> 02:29:48,600
No,
it's not good.

3609
02:29:48,601 --> 02:29:51,690
And why does a guy murder their,
their parents in the first place?

3610
02:29:51,691 --> 02:29:53,850
That's the problem.
And the thing is,

3611
02:29:53,851 --> 02:29:55,530
is that,
you know,

3612
02:29:55,531 --> 02:30:00,531
he,
he went and he chose to use the tool of 

3613
02:30:00,531 --> 02:30:02,910
firearms to go off and do whatever that 
is that he decided to.

3614
02:30:02,911 --> 02:30:06,030
And I still can't figure out why the 
fuck in the first place.

3615
02:30:06,390 --> 02:30:09,360
Did he go to a school and shoot children
of all things,

3616
02:30:09,390 --> 02:30:11,940
like I don't understand that,
that rationale.

3617
02:30:11,941 --> 02:30:14,550
Like what did it accomplish?
What was the statement?

3618
02:30:14,551 --> 02:30:16,350
What was he trying to prove?
I don't know.

3619
02:30:16,351 --> 02:30:21,351
There's not to mention there's even 
stuff floating about on the Internet 

3620
02:30:21,351 --> 02:30:23,360
where the dads have not only this,
uh,

3621
02:30:23,710 --> 02:30:28,710
the sandy hook killer and the killer 
from the Batman movie a shooting both 

3622
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:35,000
somehow have something to do with a 
banking and financial stuff that has 

3623
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
actually been disproven.

3624
02:30:36,060 --> 02:30:36,450
Well,
no,

3625
02:30:36,451 --> 02:30:39,540
they're not actually going to go to the 
library a scandal as,

3626
02:30:39,580 --> 02:30:42,660
as they're trying to say that they're 
both going to be at the library hearing,

3627
02:30:42,661 --> 02:30:47,661
but they're not.
But yet the Batman shooters dad is 

3628
02:30:47,661 --> 02:30:49,170
apparently some,
a statistical analysis,

3629
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:54,200
whatever kind of guy that what he does,
he creates these algorithms that are 

3630
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:55,230
used in banking.
Did the decipher all this shit.

3631
02:30:55,231 --> 02:30:56,880
And figure all this shit out and what it
is,

3632
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:59,310
is that the shit that he creates,
these algorithms,

3633
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:04,320
these mathematical things are the same 
things that you use to figure out that 

3634
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:06,890
libraries as being is that the library 
scandals,

3635
02:31:06,900 --> 02:31:11,900
shit,
all the line that's been done in the 

3636
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:13,500
rates being so he's involved or maybe 
even just on a cursory way in terms of 

3637
02:31:13,500 --> 02:31:16,680
figuring out the people that are 
cheating you with the banks and then the

3638
02:31:16,681 --> 02:31:19,020
other guy,
the dad of the sandy hook killer,

3639
02:31:19,180 --> 02:31:24,180
he's apparently it works at some 
financial institution of some sort and 

3640
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:27,541
his division has three people underneath
them that are being indicted for having 

3641
02:31:27,580 --> 02:31:32,580
being a part of this live worship and 
using the falsified a ratings to to

3642
02:31:36,530 --> 02:31:38,270
how many people are involved in the or 
scandal.

3643
02:31:38,271 --> 02:31:38,860
I mean it isn't impossible.

3644
02:31:39,010 --> 02:31:41,020
It was just coincidence.
It could be and I'm not,

3645
02:31:41,021 --> 02:31:46,021
I'm not.
I'm not sitting there saying that this 

3646
02:31:46,021 --> 02:31:47,671
all is necessarily related and I,
I'm sure that there is fucked up 

3647
02:31:47,671 --> 02:31:51,181
parenting.
That you've got kids that are being 

3648
02:31:51,181 --> 02:31:53,971
medicated to death and who knows what 
he's taking because apparently he was 

3649
02:31:53,971 --> 02:31:57,301
mentally ill and,
and there are drugs out there that they 

3650
02:31:57,301 --> 02:32:00,331
will give our kids and they will give 
people and have them walk the streets 

3651
02:32:00,331 --> 02:32:01,180
that some of the side effects are 
suicidal thoughts,

3652
02:32:01,181 --> 02:32:03,640
homicidal act.
I mean it's just ridiculous.

3653
02:32:03,690 --> 02:32:08,690
You're jamming all this medication down,
a human being and you expect them to 

3654
02:32:08,690 --> 02:32:09,730
function within our society like anybody
else.

3655
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:10,870
Well,
the real issue,

3656
02:32:10,871 --> 02:32:12,730
um,
the actual numbers,

3657
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:17,760
the,
a citizens' commission on human rights 

3658
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,861
of CCHR has said that out of the last 14
recent school shootings,

3659
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:25,380
all of them were committed by those 
taking or withdrawing from psychiatric 

3660
02:32:25,380 --> 02:32:28,120
drugs resulting in 109 wounded,
58 killed.

3661
02:32:28,140 --> 02:32:33,140
It was also at least 22 international 
drug regulatory warnings that have been 

3662
02:32:33,140 --> 02:32:37,650
issued on psychiatric drugs causing side
effects of mania,

3663
02:32:37,810 --> 02:32:38,920
psychosis,
aggression,

3664
02:32:38,921 --> 02:32:39,910
hostility,
violence,

3665
02:32:40,020 --> 02:32:41,250
and even homicidal.
I,

3666
02:32:41,740 --> 02:32:45,610
I think a big part of it is that it's 
not everybody you know.

3667
02:32:45,611 --> 02:32:47,800
And that's important for a lot of people
that are on that shit,

3668
02:32:48,010 --> 02:32:50,020
that it does them good.
It helps them.

3669
02:32:50,410 --> 02:32:52,780
But there's a lot of people that can't 
drink also,

3670
02:32:52,850 --> 02:32:57,850
you know,
there's a lot of people they drink and 

3671
02:32:57,850 --> 02:32:57,850
they're gone,
you know,

3672
02:32:57,850 --> 02:32:57,850
so you see the switch go off and they 
become an alcoholic.

3673
02:32:58,250 --> 02:33:01,240
The everybody's got a different setup.

3674
02:33:01,420 --> 02:33:03,700
And for some people these things are not
good.

3675
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:05,850
And um,
when,

3676
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:08,790
when you're talking about those numbers,
you could.

3677
02:33:09,190 --> 02:33:11,410
I've seen people argue and it's really 
fascinating,

3678
02:33:11,740 --> 02:33:16,090
the people that are like really opposed 
to anything that might be fuckery.

3679
02:33:16,350 --> 02:33:17,530
You know,
there's a lot of people like,

3680
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:18,130
oh,
there's this,

3681
02:33:18,190 --> 02:33:23,190
there's no cars which are just.
So you're talking about people are 

3682
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:23,500
fucked up.
Of course people are fucked up on drugs.

3683
02:33:23,550 --> 02:33:28,550
It doesn't mean the drugs are causing 
them and you don't know that that's a 

3684
02:33:28,550 --> 02:33:32,431
really good.
But it's a weird thing where chemical 

3685
02:33:32,431 --> 02:33:32,431
composition of your brain.
But there's this,

3686
02:33:32,431 --> 02:33:37,130
this sort of pro science stance that a 
lot of people want to take that are 

3687
02:33:37,360 --> 02:33:42,360
people that think that there's a lot of 
people wearing tinfoil hats and looking 

3688
02:33:42,360 --> 02:33:43,690
for conspiracies and looking for 
nonsense and everything.

3689
02:33:43,990 --> 02:33:48,990
But man,
they're like the same type of people 

3690
02:33:48,990 --> 02:33:49,840
that want to downplay the possibility 
that any sort of,

3691
02:33:49,870 --> 02:33:54,870
um,
vaccinations have been damaging to 

3692
02:33:54,870 --> 02:33:54,870
children.
Right.

3693
02:33:54,870 --> 02:33:58,320
That's,
that's another weird one that people 

3694
02:33:58,320 --> 02:33:58,320
don't want.
It was weird and address I

3695
02:33:58,320 --> 02:34:00,930
think the strongest argument for all of 
that as even potential.

3696
02:34:01,110 --> 02:34:06,110
And I'm not talking about that.
I wear tinfoil hats or anything like 

3697
02:34:06,110 --> 02:34:06,110
that,
but something I stated,

3698
02:34:06,110 --> 02:34:09,300
you know,
I touched on earlier throughout mankind,

3699
02:34:09,301 --> 02:34:13,600
we fucking lie.
We lie and we cheat our,

3700
02:34:13,670 --> 02:34:16,590
our populous constantly over and over 
and over.

3701
02:34:16,591 --> 02:34:19,060
We do it religion,
we do it with our politics.

3702
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:20,560
They constantly,
you know,

3703
02:34:20,561 --> 02:34:25,561
you have companies that go and they 
deliberately destroy the environment 

3704
02:34:26,081 --> 02:34:29,110
with their chemicals and their shit and 
they know they're doing it and they know

3705
02:34:29,111 --> 02:34:34,111
that it's destroying shit and they just 
know that they can get away with it and 

3706
02:34:34,111 --> 02:34:34,150
they just lie.
And then all of a sudden boom there have

3707
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:37,630
somebody comes out of the woodwork and 
make them accountable for it.

3708
02:34:37,631 --> 02:34:40,030
And then they backtrack and they tell a 
whole bunch more lies.

3709
02:34:40,270 --> 02:34:45,270
They feed them a couple of goats and 
then they keep on doing the same 

3710
02:34:45,270 --> 02:34:45,270
bullshit and they never have to pay the 
price for.

3711
02:34:45,270 --> 02:34:50,250
We have all these politicians that go 
out there and when they try to feed us 

3712
02:34:50,250 --> 02:34:51,430
all these lines about how they're,
you know,

3713
02:34:51,490 --> 02:34:53,650
they're this,
they're part of that side and this other

3714
02:34:53,651 --> 02:34:58,651
side is wrong and vice versa and split 
us as a populous and then they go and 

3715
02:34:58,651 --> 02:34:58,651
they,
they,

3716
02:34:58,651 --> 02:35:00,190
they claim all these great things 
they're going to do.

3717
02:35:00,191 --> 02:35:01,330
You know,
they do nice,

3718
02:35:01,360 --> 02:35:02,590
tricky,
Wonderful Shit.

3719
02:35:02,591 --> 02:35:03,460
Like,
Hey,

3720
02:35:03,461 --> 02:35:05,470
I'm just about to get reelected.
So now.

3721
02:35:05,471 --> 02:35:06,340
Yeah,
gay marriage.

3722
02:35:06,341 --> 02:35:07,660
Great.
I totally support it.

3723
02:35:07,690 --> 02:35:09,790
Why don't you say a four years ago,
you piece of shit.

3724
02:35:09,870 --> 02:35:10,720
Yeah.
You piece of shit.

3725
02:35:10,750 --> 02:35:12,610
You know,
he wasn't your son cares.

3726
02:35:12,670 --> 02:35:17,670
Here's something crazy.
More than one in 10 in the United 

3727
02:35:17,670 --> 02:35:17,670
States.
Take antidepressants.

3728
02:35:18,130 --> 02:35:19,420
Should they be.
How about,

3729
02:35:19,421 --> 02:35:20,380
you know,
good question.

3730
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:23,870
I'll tell you something.
I remember having a.

3731
02:35:23,880 --> 02:35:28,880
What does that number?
How many is that one in 10 million 

3732
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:28,880
people.

3733
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:32,640
So what does that 30 million.
A 3 million I think know 30 million.

3734
02:35:33,641 --> 02:35:34,250
Yeah.
$300.

3735
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:35,020
Yeah,
30 million.

3736
02:35:35,470 --> 02:35:40,470
That's insane.
It's not 30 million people out there 

3737
02:35:40,470 --> 02:35:40,470
walking the street,
all the fucking PROZAC,

3738
02:35:40,470 --> 02:35:42,670
Xanax to whatever up.
And I remember,

3739
02:35:42,671 --> 02:35:47,671
I remember going through a really 
fucking bad breakup not that long ago 

3740
02:35:47,671 --> 02:35:49,780
and just fucking dying and having 
anxiety for the first time.

3741
02:35:49,781 --> 02:35:54,781
I've never had that shit.
I've got a lot of shit go down in my 

3742
02:35:54,781 --> 02:35:57,481
life,
but I've never had this fucked up 

3743
02:35:57,481 --> 02:35:58,891
anxiety and all.
I'm not sleeping and I'm having a hard 

3744
02:35:58,891 --> 02:36:01,000
time getting full deep breaths.
All this shit.

3745
02:36:01,110 --> 02:36:02,920
Trash Strip clubs.
Uh,

3746
02:36:03,070 --> 02:36:04,660
yeah.
I definitely did strip clubs.

3747
02:36:04,661 --> 02:36:08,530
I hope it helps some but a little bit,
but it's like a little bridge.

3748
02:36:08,531 --> 02:36:09,640
Yeah.
Bridge to happiness.

3749
02:36:09,641 --> 02:36:11,120
But uh,
but the thing was,

3750
02:36:11,121 --> 02:36:14,440
is that I knew that I could probably hit
up somebody and get a pill,

3751
02:36:14,740 --> 02:36:15,850
take all that shit away.

3752
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:19,540
And to me I thought that's a fucking 
coward's way out.

3753
02:36:19,960 --> 02:36:23,800
That's not the way you do it because 
going through this shit means something.

3754
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:27,460
It's something that I need to do to be a
stronger,

3755
02:36:27,490 --> 02:36:30,010
better,
more well adjusted man.

3756
02:36:30,011 --> 02:36:35,011
Like I need to go through this and deal 
with it because dealing with it is how 

3757
02:36:35,011 --> 02:36:35,830
you make yourself better in the future 
so you know,

3758
02:36:35,831 --> 02:36:40,831
you go through a cold instead of getting
the vaccine flu instead of getting 

3759
02:36:40,831 --> 02:36:43,561
vaccinated,
so now your body knows how to adapt to 

3760
02:36:43,561 --> 02:36:45,901
it,
so you go through depression and 

3761
02:36:45,901 --> 02:36:45,901
figuring out how to solve it and not get
depressed again.

3762
02:36:45,901 --> 02:36:47,440
And I'm not saying that there aren't 
people out there that,

3763
02:36:47,470 --> 02:36:52,470
that WHO's chemical balances for 
whatever reason have gotten all twisted 

3764
02:36:52,470 --> 02:36:56,851
up and they really do need help.
That's the real issue is when I knew 

3765
02:36:56,851 --> 02:36:59,611
that,
but for me I could tell that wasn't the 

3766
02:36:59,611 --> 02:36:59,611
case.
You know,

3767
02:36:59,611 --> 02:36:59,611
I was just fucking heartbroken.
Right?

3768
02:36:59,611 --> 02:37:00,880
That,
that's what it was and it was.

3769
02:37:00,910 --> 02:37:05,910
It was not really few fine.
Poor Josh Barnett on the inside.

3770
02:37:06,700 --> 02:37:09,670
Oh yeah.
This is never going to find her again,

3771
02:37:09,671 --> 02:37:10,630
by the way.
Yeah.

3772
02:37:11,820 --> 02:37:13,960
The idea is that,
you know,

3773
02:37:13,961 --> 02:37:15,960
it's not either or.
I think the

3774
02:37:16,060 --> 02:37:17,900
same thing.
Yeah,

3775
02:37:17,901 --> 02:37:22,901
he's cute and very funny,
but I don't think you'd ever be 

3776
02:37:22,901 --> 02:37:25,241
together.
I just can't get over the fact that he 

3777
02:37:25,241 --> 02:37:25,241
likes guns.
It's creepy and a little scary.

3778
02:37:25,241 --> 02:37:26,660
Somebody as smart as him shouldn't need 
a gun to feel like a man,

3779
02:37:27,020 --> 02:37:30,650
be a man,
lose the gun to shoot loads in her.

3780
02:37:30,830 --> 02:37:32,190
Oh Man.
It's a blast.

3781
02:37:32,330 --> 02:37:37,330
Hide my guns in a hole in the backyard 
and pretend kind of propaganda is fucked

3782
02:37:38,121 --> 02:37:38,620
up.
It's like,

3783
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:39,770
you know,
I've,

3784
02:37:39,771 --> 02:37:44,771
I've,
I own quite a few firearms and most of 

3785
02:37:44,771 --> 02:37:45,250
it for the collection of it,
like I'm a nerd,

3786
02:37:45,310 --> 02:37:50,310
you know,
and that's the people that inhabit all 

3787
02:37:50,310 --> 02:37:50,310
those,
uh,

3788
02:37:50,310 --> 02:37:50,870
those evil gun shows,
fat,

3789
02:37:51,080 --> 02:37:54,320
balding,
social awkward.

3790
02:37:54,350 --> 02:37:56,060
They're just nerds,
nerds,

3791
02:37:56,061 --> 02:37:56,570
nerds,
nerds,

3792
02:37:56,571 --> 02:38:01,571
that people that buy all the assault 
weapons that everyone wants to go on 

3793
02:38:01,571 --> 02:38:04,601
about.
All these crazy solves all these crazy 

3794
02:38:04,601 --> 02:38:04,601
capabilities.

3795
02:38:04,601 --> 02:38:04,601
Gun nerds,
nerds.

3796
02:38:04,601 --> 02:38:05,010
That's it.
That's who buys these fucking thinks is.

3797
02:38:05,011 --> 02:38:07,490
Those are the only people that can 
afford them or have the interest to have

3798
02:38:07,491 --> 02:38:07,970
them.
Well,

3799
02:38:07,971 --> 02:38:09,680
that's not true because there's always 
crazy.

3800
02:38:09,750 --> 02:38:12,920
It's such a huge amount of crazy people 
that share them.

3801
02:38:13,010 --> 02:38:18,010
There is a small amount.
That's when people really don't 

3802
02:38:18,010 --> 02:38:18,010
understand.
When it comes to the numbers of guns,

3803
02:38:18,010 --> 02:38:22,420
it's like there's like Pierce Morgan.
I thought he was going on this crazy 

3804
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:22,420
rant about,
oh,

3805
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:27,091
you know,
America has this love affair with guns 

3806
02:38:27,091 --> 02:38:27,091
and look where it's got us and look,
it's.

3807
02:38:27,091 --> 02:38:27,260
It's so dangerous.
Guns is doing it well.

3808
02:38:27,350 --> 02:38:28,430
Yeah.
The people,

3809
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:33,760
first of all,
you got to think about how many people 

3810
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:33,760
are not doing it.
Okay.

3811
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:35,630
Because there's so many armed 
motherfuckers in this country.

3812
02:38:35,631 --> 02:38:40,631
It's amazing gun.
I don't walk around pulling guns on 

3813
02:38:40,631 --> 02:38:44,171
people.
When you get on the highway and you see 

3814
02:38:44,171 --> 02:38:46,370
a like a traffic accident,
it's amazing how few you find they are 

3815
02:38:46,370 --> 02:38:48,290
God damn millions of cars flying,
going 60,

3816
02:38:48,291 --> 02:38:53,291
70 miles an hour all around each other,
all the time in each other and they 

3817
02:38:53,291 --> 02:38:53,291
aren't hitting each other.

3818
02:38:53,291 --> 02:38:53,291
I mean,
what?

3819
02:38:53,291 --> 02:38:56,540
What we have to realize is that when 
you're dealing with a society,

3820
02:38:56,570 --> 02:38:59,480
a complex society like what we have now,
complex,

3821
02:38:59,650 --> 02:39:04,650
credible numbers,
the number of people is absolutely 

3822
02:39:04,650 --> 02:39:04,650
staggering.
You know what?

3823
02:39:04,650 --> 02:39:08,321
I read something recently,
like America itself is like the only 

3824
02:39:08,321 --> 02:39:12,371
example of so many cultures and races 
and mixing all the way that it does.

3825
02:39:13,090 --> 02:39:15,470
Like you go to Europe and it's like,
for the most part,

3826
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:17,930
almost all countries are pretty much 
homogeneous,

3827
02:39:18,200 --> 02:39:23,200
right?
With a few exceptions of experts and 

3828
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:23,270
people from other general,
like in America we said,

3829
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:24,050
you know what?
No,

3830
02:39:24,590 --> 02:39:27,560
everybody of any kind at any religion of
any faith,

3831
02:39:27,561 --> 02:39:28,850
of any creative,
any color,

3832
02:39:29,210 --> 02:39:32,360
bring them all together and to take all 
these different cultures,

3833
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:34,320
some quite different,
you know,

3834
02:39:34,340 --> 02:39:39,340
when you,
let's say from a root culture to know 

3835
02:39:39,340 --> 02:39:40,340
before becoming an American,
let's say early stages of American,

3836
02:39:40,341 --> 02:39:45,341
how even vast Irish could be from 
Italian and how they're brought up and 

3837
02:39:45,341 --> 02:39:46,280
um,
their upbringings.

3838
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:48,440
I mean fuck,
I mean there's so many different and yet

3839
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:51,680
we managed to put together this country 
that has survived,

3840
02:39:52,070 --> 02:39:57,070
you know,
however many hundred so years as it has 

3841
02:39:57,070 --> 02:39:57,440
and has done some pretty amazing things.
Yeah.

3842
02:39:57,770 --> 02:39:59,810
Without us trying to all murder each 
other all the time.

3843
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:02,660
I think there's some issues that we 
definitely have to be addressed.

3844
02:40:02,661 --> 02:40:04,700
One of them is this antidepressant 
thing,

3845
02:40:04,701 --> 02:40:09,701
and I'm not saying that people should 
not be on it because I know people that 

3846
02:40:09,701 --> 02:40:10,280
have been on it and it's helped them and
changed their life and saved their life.

3847
02:40:10,281 --> 02:40:15,281
He sure,
but maybe you shouldn't have a fucking 

3848
02:40:15,281 --> 02:40:15,281
gun when you're on it because it seems 
like

3849
02:40:15,281 --> 02:40:16,600
a lot of people that are on these things
and take guns.

3850
02:40:16,630 --> 02:40:18,490
That's where my problem is,
that that's not okay

3851
02:40:18,520 --> 02:40:23,520
listed as one of the things about next,
but probably because of a pharmaceutical

3852
02:40:23,891 --> 02:40:25,330
industry that,
and the,

3853
02:40:25,331 --> 02:40:30,331
you know,
under the guise of the whole patient 

3854
02:40:30,331 --> 02:40:30,331
confidentiality.
Now they say in the,

3855
02:40:30,331 --> 02:40:31,180
in the statutes that,
you know,

3856
02:40:31,210 --> 02:40:32,020
they can,
they can,

3857
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:37,080
your,
you cannot have a gun if you're a under 

3858
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:37,080
indictment,
uh,

3859
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:39,400
for crime punishable by imprisonment,
a exceeding one year.

3860
02:40:39,401 --> 02:40:40,570
All these different things,
illegal,

3861
02:40:40,571 --> 02:40:41,480
alien,
agitated.

3862
02:40:41,770 --> 02:40:45,630
Now here's the one that's even similar 
to being on antidepressants and all this

3863
02:40:45,640 --> 02:40:50,640
is who has been educated as a mental,
defective or has been committed to any 

3864
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:50,640
mental institution.
Okay?

3865
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:52,990
That's where they commit you.
Right?

3866
02:40:52,991 --> 02:40:54,400
And so,
you know,

3867
02:40:54,460 --> 02:40:56,680
by the,
under the probably the laws of,

3868
02:40:56,681 --> 02:40:58,660
uh,
of medical confidence,

3869
02:40:59,080 --> 02:41:00,130
therefore it's like,
oh,

3870
02:41:00,131 --> 02:41:01,480
we can't just tell people,
oh,

3871
02:41:01,481 --> 02:41:04,330
this guy is all jacked up on like four 
different antidepressants.

3872
02:41:04,690 --> 02:41:05,500
We can't just say,
oh,

3873
02:41:05,501 --> 02:41:07,420
well you can't have a firearm based on 
that alone.

3874
02:41:07,450 --> 02:41:09,130
Where I think,
yeah,

3875
02:41:09,131 --> 02:41:10,850
actually we probably should.
In fact,

3876
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:13,730
if it was really to be honest,
my,

3877
02:41:13,780 --> 02:41:17,390
my whole thing is I wish that there was 
a way we had a,

3878
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:19,840
uh,
a licensing system to get your firearm.

3879
02:41:19,841 --> 02:41:22,420
Just like you have to get a car.
Like you have to prove your,

3880
02:41:22,540 --> 02:41:24,850
you have to take competency tests,
you have to prove competency,

3881
02:41:24,851 --> 02:41:29,050
you have to improve understanding of the
mechanics of the firearm itself,

3882
02:41:29,051 --> 02:41:31,390
how it operates,
how to take it apart,

3883
02:41:31,530 --> 02:41:34,210
how to understand taking care of it,
how to operate it.

3884
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:36,640
I agree on this thing safely.
And then then,

3885
02:41:36,850 --> 02:41:38,770
then once you've passed such a certain,
you know,

3886
02:41:38,771 --> 02:41:39,920
uh,
you know,

3887
02:41:39,940 --> 02:41:44,940
amount of testing,
then you can be given a card and then 

3888
02:41:44,940 --> 02:41:44,940
you meet,
you know,

3889
02:41:44,940 --> 02:41:47,330
can go out there and buy a farm.
I really think that apps people are not,

3890
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:52,500
but I also believe that that we as a 
populace are so irresponsible,

3891
02:41:53,411 --> 02:41:57,010
even more so with our motor vehicles 
that is not even funny,

3892
02:41:57,040 --> 02:42:00,430
that the how easy it is to get behind 
the wheel of a 4,000

3893
02:42:00,431 --> 02:42:05,431
pound car and go out there and kill each
other is ridiculous and it's way too 

3894
02:42:05,431 --> 02:42:08,830
easily available to anyone and people 
love just creating the hot button topics

3895
02:42:08,831 --> 02:42:10,570
and it's easy to get people fired up 
about something.

3896
02:42:10,570 --> 02:42:11,800
Has guns.
You don't need those,

3897
02:42:11,890 --> 02:42:13,600
but we need cars.
Great.

3898
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:14,730
Well,
I've seen people say,

3899
02:42:14,731 --> 02:42:16,530
you know,
if you could get another,

3900
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:17,560
you know,
you go,

3901
02:42:17,561 --> 02:42:19,770
you got to go hunting.
Get another fucking hobby.

3902
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:21,570
I've actually seen people write that 
down.

3903
02:42:21,960 --> 02:42:23,340
That's the answer I've seen.
People say,

3904
02:42:23,341 --> 02:42:28,341
Oh,
I wish that the animals were armed to 

3905
02:42:28,341 --> 02:42:30,380
what you were saying all about licensing
and everything that all that's all well 

3906
02:42:30,380 --> 02:42:30,380
and good,
but here's the problem.

3907
02:42:30,380 --> 02:42:32,240
That kid,
it was not as fucking gun.

3908
02:42:32,270 --> 02:42:34,290
No,
he went and legal.

3909
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:39,500
It's illegal use of the guns,
which is also the case with the kids in 

3910
02:42:39,500 --> 02:42:39,780
Columbine.
Illegal.

3911
02:42:40,410 --> 02:42:41,770
They murdered somebody,
installed them,

3912
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:44,400
yes.
So you're always gonna have that problem

3913
02:42:44,430 --> 02:42:46,470
if those guns exist and also potentially

3914
02:42:46,810 --> 02:42:49,800
let's say that mother had gone through 
all that training and,

3915
02:42:49,930 --> 02:42:50,300
and,
and,

3916
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:52,660
and in doing so locked her guns up.

3917
02:42:52,690 --> 02:42:53,550
Well,
you know,

3918
02:42:54,020 --> 02:42:56,830
you now you're going really far.
You trying to make someone a responsible

3919
02:42:56,831 --> 02:42:58,810
parent almost fucking of course.
But

3920
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:04,280
is that when,
when people are forced to do something 

3921
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:04,280
through responsible means to actually 
acquire the,

3922
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:07,990
improve themselves capable of owning the
opportunity to be responsible like that.

3923
02:43:07,991 --> 02:43:09,190
And,
and trust me,

3924
02:43:09,191 --> 02:43:12,050
you know,
me talking about having government which

3925
02:43:12,051 --> 02:43:17,051
I already think is incredibly 
irresponsible and does things for its 

3926
02:43:17,051 --> 02:43:17,051
own reasons,
create more,

3927
02:43:17,051 --> 02:43:17,300
you know,
licensing,

3928
02:43:17,330 --> 02:43:19,310
you know,
I mean there's always a concern like,

3929
02:43:19,311 --> 02:43:24,311
okay,
well then they just decided that nobody 

3930
02:43:24,311 --> 02:43:24,311
can ever pass and therefore no one can 
ever have a gun regulatory

3931
02:43:24,311 --> 02:43:27,110
bodies that do their job.
I'm out of passion first.

3932
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:32,200
For instance,
fish and game fish and game does a 

3933
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:34,151
pretty fucking good job,
but he spent the money is all from 

3934
02:43:34,151 --> 02:43:38,111
hunting tags and you know,
and that that's what pays for 

3935
02:43:38,111 --> 02:43:40,631
conservation efforts.
A lot of people don't understand that 

3936
02:43:40,631 --> 02:43:42,831
that fishing game does a very good job 
of managing the wildlife in this 

3937
02:43:42,831 --> 02:43:42,831
country.
People,

3938
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:43,900
one of the most efficient.
Yeah.

3939
02:43:44,690 --> 02:43:49,690
How the hunting tags or even re relegate
it out there to the populace is because 

3940
02:43:49,710 --> 02:43:50,300
uh,
they've,

3941
02:43:50,350 --> 02:43:55,350
they've,
they've studied the heard the train and 

3942
02:43:55,350 --> 02:43:58,121
all these different animals and how,
how they've been getting sick or how 

3943
02:43:58,121 --> 02:44:01,721
healthy they are,
how many infants they've had and all 

3944
02:44:01,721 --> 02:44:04,121
this,
and they calculate how many tags they 

3945
02:44:04,121 --> 02:44:04,190
can allow to give out.
And then there's even for dose,

3946
02:44:04,220 --> 02:44:09,220
okay,
well you have to go into a lottery to 

3947
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:09,220
get a doe tag to go ahead and be able to
hunt a doe.

3948
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:12,530
And so that's kind of that.
That whole figure has come up by,

3949
02:44:12,660 --> 02:44:15,140
by being on top of what's going on with 
the animals.

3950
02:44:15,190 --> 02:44:16,210
Yeah.
It's knowledge.

3951
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:20,260
It's based on people who are actually.
They're concerned about the environment,

3952
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:21,040
right?
They're not trying to get.

3953
02:44:21,041 --> 02:44:26,041
No one's getting rich off of that.
It's all passionate hunters and they 

3954
02:44:26,041 --> 02:44:26,041
want to conserve the environment under 
his love,

3955
02:44:26,041 --> 02:44:30,380
the environment and some of the most 
environmentally responsible and 

3956
02:44:30,380 --> 02:44:32,520
important organization in the world are 
full of basically.

3957
02:44:32,530 --> 02:44:32,670
Huh?

3958
02:44:32,940 --> 02:44:37,940
And there's a problem that people don't 
understand when you advocate against 

3959
02:44:37,940 --> 02:44:37,940
hunting is that,
well,

3960
02:44:37,940 --> 02:44:42,691
if you're not the top of the food chain,
that you better bring somebody in who's 

3961
02:44:42,691 --> 02:44:42,691
going to do the dirty work because if 
you don't,

3962
02:44:42,691 --> 02:44:43,770
you're going to have all these prey 
animals.

3963
02:44:43,771 --> 02:44:45,670
They're going to be running rampant all 
over the place.

3964
02:44:45,671 --> 02:44:47,770
You have to do something because there's
not enough food.

3965
02:44:48,040 --> 02:44:51,370
And the,
the idea that if you don't kill them,

3966
02:44:51,371 --> 02:44:54,670
they're just gonna be okay and peaceful 
and live with us.

3967
02:44:54,700 --> 02:44:56,470
You're crazy.
They're going to slam into cars,

3968
02:44:56,590 --> 02:45:01,590
they're going to die of starvation and 
you're going to have a Predator 

3969
02:45:01,590 --> 02:45:01,590
population increase.

3970
02:45:01,590 --> 02:45:05,460
There's a responsibility as human beings
on this planet and our involvement in 

3971
02:45:05,460 --> 02:45:07,180
this planet's ecosystem can manage that.
We have to,

3972
02:45:07,210 --> 02:45:08,980
we have to work on managing it.
And uh,

3973
02:45:08,981 --> 02:45:10,390
and that's the thing,
but I mean,

3974
02:45:10,480 --> 02:45:13,630
but I think it should be more difficult 
to get a car.

3975
02:45:13,720 --> 02:45:14,520
I really,
I agree.

3976
02:45:14,550 --> 02:45:15,730
I mean it's like,
I agree,

3977
02:45:15,790 --> 02:45:17,440
it's 70.
Think of it as a right,

3978
02:45:17,441 --> 02:45:20,170
76,000
people were involved in fatal crashes.

3979
02:45:20,171 --> 02:45:22,600
Now they didn't die,
but that's 76,000

3980
02:45:22,601 --> 02:45:25,630
fucking people that.
How many of those could have been solved

3981
02:45:25,631 --> 02:45:28,240
by not texting.
Irresponsible bullshit.

3982
02:45:28,241 --> 02:45:29,050
Just,
you know,

3983
02:45:29,051 --> 02:45:32,080
it should be a lot more difficult to get
behind the wheel and I want that kind of

3984
02:45:32,081 --> 02:45:34,270
responsibility.
I would love to see that to,

3985
02:45:34,330 --> 02:45:37,060
for someone to own a firearm.
And then even besides that,

3986
02:45:37,330 --> 02:45:39,040
if you,
let's say you take all the guns away,

3987
02:45:39,400 --> 02:45:44,400
if we have people that are doped up or 
fucking crazy or whatever and they're 

3988
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:45,400
going out,
let's say say the Batman guy just walked

3989
02:45:45,401 --> 02:45:48,170
into the theater with an ax and he 
fucking nailed three people.

3990
02:45:48,170 --> 02:45:53,170
He just.
Three people die for no fucking good 

3991
02:45:53,170 --> 02:45:53,170
reason,
right?

3992
02:45:53,170 --> 02:45:53,590
But the idea is it's not 33 because he 
doesn't have guns.

3993
02:45:53,591 --> 02:45:54,790
He's not,
he's not wearing.

3994
02:45:54,820 --> 02:45:59,820
And I'm not going to give any examples 
because I'm not that asshole like a lot 

3995
02:45:59,820 --> 02:46:00,070
of the media.
Well,

3996
02:46:00,071 --> 02:46:01,200
where they'll sit there and say,
well,

3997
02:46:01,360 --> 02:46:02,050
Hey,
guess what?

3998
02:46:02,051 --> 02:46:03,400
This is how you made x,
Y,

3999
02:46:03,401 --> 02:46:08,401
Z or how you do this and give a fucking 
information out there to people so they 

4000
02:46:08,401 --> 02:46:08,401
can go out and some other Wacko can do 
it,

4001
02:46:08,401 --> 02:46:12,901
but look,
I could sit here with you in private 

4002
02:46:12,901 --> 02:46:15,371
until you at least three different ways.
I probably could've killed everybody in 

4003
02:46:15,371 --> 02:46:15,371
that theater.
Yeah,

4004
02:46:15,371 --> 02:46:20,170
no,
there's way the more strategic about it 

4005
02:46:20,170 --> 02:46:21,750
and the thing is why we got to solve the
problem of,

4006
02:46:21,751 --> 02:46:24,950
of our populace murdering the rest of 
us.

4007
02:46:24,970 --> 02:46:29,970
Okay.
But you and it's America and it's a 

4008
02:46:29,970 --> 02:46:29,970
total rare a thing as it is.

4009
02:46:29,970 --> 02:46:32,160
Like if you added up all the people that
out of how many we have in the,

4010
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:34,940
in,
in America versus how many are are,

4011
02:46:34,970 --> 02:46:37,910
are coming under.
It's still.

4012
02:46:38,210 --> 02:46:41,210
I mean in as pure statistics game,
we're not.

4013
02:46:41,420 --> 02:46:43,550
It's not like it's still a fucking super
rare thing.

4014
02:46:43,551 --> 02:46:48,551
I'm sure there's a statistics person 
that can tell you the likelihood of you 

4015
02:46:48,551 --> 02:46:49,730
actually being involved in a shooting at
all in anywhere in America.

4016
02:46:50,180 --> 02:46:55,180
Well,
let's get down to the nitty gritty 

4017
02:46:55,180 --> 02:46:55,180
because we only got a couple of minutes 
left for you.

4018
02:46:55,180 --> 02:46:55,180
Turn into a pumpkin.
Three,

4019
02:46:55,180 --> 02:46:56,870
three hours were useless.
Um,

4020
02:46:56,960 --> 02:46:59,180
what,
what is the solution then?

4021
02:46:59,210 --> 02:47:00,980
I mean,
is it arming schools?

4022
02:47:01,010 --> 02:47:01,640
No.
Army.

4023
02:47:01,641 --> 02:47:02,390
No,
definitely not.

4024
02:47:02,470 --> 02:47:07,470
That's the thing.
It's an armed guard and that kind of 

4025
02:47:07,470 --> 02:47:07,470
shit from happening.
I had a,

4026
02:47:07,470 --> 02:47:08,100
we had an armed guard at our school.
Like I,

4027
02:47:08,450 --> 02:47:10,620
I think there should at this point in A.

4028
02:47:10,730 --> 02:47:12,210
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with an arm chair.

4029
02:47:12,220 --> 02:47:13,340
No,
but we had armed,

4030
02:47:13,341 --> 02:47:14,320
uh,
an arm.

4031
02:47:14,350 --> 02:47:15,530
Just a police officer.
Yeah.

4032
02:47:15,650 --> 02:47:18,560
We had an officer on our school and I 
had a pretty gnarly school.

4033
02:47:18,561 --> 02:47:19,550
We didn't have shooting.
Well,

4034
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:24,551
no,
I guess we did have a shooting girl got 

4035
02:47:24,551 --> 02:47:24,551
shot in the face seven times by some 
little Asian gangster kid.

4036
02:47:24,551 --> 02:47:24,551
Whoa.
But,

4037
02:47:24,551 --> 02:47:27,440
and then we had a girl got shot in,
but you know,

4038
02:47:27,441 --> 02:47:30,170
and that was fucking super tragic.
And uh,

4039
02:47:30,470 --> 02:47:35,470
you know,
the key to all of that also is that she 

4040
02:47:35,470 --> 02:47:36,650
was hanging around all these bad fucking
dudes and these bad dudes were doing bad

4041
02:47:36,651 --> 02:47:37,360
shit.
And you know,

4042
02:47:37,370 --> 02:47:42,370
it's like if you.
It's not like they came down to just to 

4043
02:47:42,370 --> 02:47:42,370
shoot anybody.
Right.

4044
02:47:42,370 --> 02:47:46,990
You know what I mean?
I don't think they didn't even come to 

4045
02:47:46,990 --> 02:47:46,990
shoot her specifically and it's just 
like a.

4046
02:47:46,990 --> 02:47:50,780
and then you know,
why do these kids want to live this 

4047
02:47:50,780 --> 02:47:52,010
lifestyle where they're running around 
shooting each other anyways,

4048
02:47:52,100 --> 02:47:57,100
what?
I mean it's just like fucked up parents 

4049
02:47:57,100 --> 02:47:57,100
to live education,
whatever,

4050
02:47:57,100 --> 02:47:59,770
and then it ends up in this girl getting
shot and it's pointless.

4051
02:47:59,780 --> 02:48:04,780
But yeah,
we had an awesome solution that NRA 

4052
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:07,130
rhetoric about putting guards and I in 
front of all these fucking schools,

4053
02:48:07,131 --> 02:48:12,131
like that doesn't change the problem.
What if we took all the guards that are 

4054
02:48:12,131 --> 02:48:13,940
working for the dea,
have them guard the schools.

4055
02:48:13,941 --> 02:48:18,941
We killed two birds with which we just 
put one of them in every school so that 

4056
02:48:18,941 --> 02:48:22,721
you.
And maybe these people could not only 

4057
02:48:22,721 --> 02:48:22,721
just be in the school of standing around
with a gun,

4058
02:48:22,721 --> 02:48:26,441
but maybe they could also be an 
influence on people as far as like just 

4059
02:48:26,441 --> 02:48:26,441
being like,
Hey,

4060
02:48:26,441 --> 02:48:27,170
guess what?
I'm here to defend you,

4061
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:30,680
but I'm doing it as an upright fucking 
citizen and this is why it's important.

4062
02:48:31,100 --> 02:48:33,260
Well,
that would be like a volunteer sort of a

4063
02:48:33,261 --> 02:48:35,330
militia type thing.
Is that what you mean?

4064
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:36,770
Something like that.
Well,

4065
02:48:36,771 --> 02:48:39,200
he doesn't like that shit,
but even if it was regulated,

4066
02:48:39,230 --> 02:48:40,580
I'm cool with that.
I'm just saying that,

4067
02:48:40,610 --> 02:48:41,900
you know,
do one further.

4068
02:48:41,930 --> 02:48:42,530
My,
my,

4069
02:48:42,590 --> 02:48:47,590
my point where I'm getting to with this 
is that it's not just the having an 

4070
02:48:47,590 --> 02:48:50,651
armed guard.
Here's the thing that helps change this 

4071
02:48:50,651 --> 02:48:53,830
from,
from people just blindly shooting each 

4072
02:48:53,830 --> 02:48:55,871
other and whatever community.
We don't have any fucking community 

4073
02:48:55,871 --> 02:48:59,351
anymore.
No one's responsible and when I say 

4074
02:48:59,351 --> 02:48:59,351
responsible,
they're not just respond.

4075
02:48:59,351 --> 02:49:02,740
You know what?
Just responsible for yourself in a 

4076
02:49:02,740 --> 02:49:02,740
community.
You keep an eye out,

4077
02:49:02,740 --> 02:49:02,900
hey,
you got some crazy fucking psycho kid.

4078
02:49:03,110 --> 02:49:04,790
Keep an eye on.
Let other people know.

4079
02:49:04,791 --> 02:49:05,570
Like,
Hey,

4080
02:49:05,571 --> 02:49:10,571
by the way,
tom is actually fucking weird right now 

4081
02:49:10,571 --> 02:49:10,770
and we need to be aware of that so that 
he,

4082
02:49:10,810 --> 02:49:12,500
you know,
everybody just work.

4083
02:49:12,501 --> 02:49:14,790
Everybody just wants a little mom's 
house nowadays.

4084
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:16,110
That's,
that's my example.

4085
02:49:16,111 --> 02:49:18,750
They just want a big hand to come over 
and wash all their laundry,

4086
02:49:18,751 --> 02:49:23,751
do everything,
and they don't want to see or be a part 

4087
02:49:23,751 --> 02:49:23,751
of the process and made all that happen 
anymore.

4088
02:49:23,751 --> 02:49:23,751
I think that

4089
02:49:23,880 --> 02:49:28,880
random or sort of a big,
broad way community is definitely the 

4090
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:31,710
answer.
I think that what's going on now,

4091
02:49:31,711 --> 02:49:36,711
what we were talking about with Internet
trolls and people getting exposed and 

4092
02:49:36,711 --> 02:49:37,560
realizing that anonymity is slowly 
slipping away.

4093
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:42,920
I think ultimately that's going to lead 
to a bigger sense of community because 

4094
02:49:42,920 --> 02:49:44,400
we're going to have repercussions for 
actions and thoughts.

4095
02:49:44,401 --> 02:49:49,401
Homes are going to have access to each 
other in a way that I don't think we've 

4096
02:49:49,401 --> 02:49:52,401
ever had before.
I'm hoping that this is a stage of 

4097
02:49:52,401 --> 02:49:55,881
humanity.
I think we are really involved in some 

4098
02:49:55,881 --> 02:49:57,280
sort of a,
a more,

4099
02:49:57,610 --> 02:49:59,810
a metamorphosis,
uh,

4100
02:49:59,970 --> 02:50:04,970
growing and developing because of this 
technology and because of this sort of 

4101
02:50:04,970 --> 02:50:04,970
connection that people share with 
people.

4102
02:50:04,970 --> 02:50:09,450
And I don't want to be live in society.
I don't want to overstate it,

4103
02:50:09,451 --> 02:50:14,451
but that's the feeling that I get from 
people that benefit from this show on 

4104
02:50:14,451 --> 02:50:17,331
the Internet.
That's the things that people benefit 

4105
02:50:17,331 --> 02:50:19,281
from reading things and being exposed to
things and lectures and Ted talks and 

4106
02:50:19,281 --> 02:50:19,780
shit that they really wouldn't have had,
that

4107
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:21,260
we need to participate more.
You know,

4108
02:50:21,261 --> 02:50:26,261
it's one thing to listen.
It's another thing to to to listen to a 

4109
02:50:26,261 --> 02:50:27,380
show and then stay in your own fucking 
bubble and never participate in the rest

4110
02:50:27,381 --> 02:50:29,240
of your community.
You need to be a part of your community,

4111
02:50:29,260 --> 02:50:32,570
need to be to know your fellow man.
You need to know your fucking neighbor.

4112
02:50:32,571 --> 02:50:34,880
You need to know you.
The more you're a part of this,

4113
02:50:34,881 --> 02:50:39,881
now all of a sudden you're not just some
random drone that nobody knows or ever 

4114
02:50:39,881 --> 02:50:43,121
know and now you're a human being that 
the interacts with other human beings 

4115
02:50:43,121 --> 02:50:44,200
and now you're forming this greater and 
stronger bond that's gonna.

4116
02:50:44,210 --> 02:50:45,110
Look out for each other.

4117
02:50:45,140 --> 02:50:50,140
Yeah.
We have to sort of somehow or another 

4118
02:50:50,140 --> 02:50:51,800
feel a need for that and as a society,
as a society,

4119
02:50:51,801 --> 02:50:55,430
figure out how to engineer that,
that sense of community again,

4120
02:50:55,431 --> 02:50:58,190
and I've been trying to get all my 
friends to move on the same block,

4121
02:50:58,490 --> 02:51:01,850
but none of these motherfuckers are 
willing to move out to my neighborhood.

4122
02:51:02,150 --> 02:51:04,610
We're going to have to buy a patch of 
land and do it cult style.

4123
02:51:05,210 --> 02:51:06,740
But I really think that,
that,

4124
02:51:06,820 --> 02:51:11,820
you know,
wouldn't it be the best way to live is 

4125
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:11,820
to like have most of your friends like 
in your neighborhood,

4126
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:14,390
instead of being in some neighborhoods 
shirt with strangers,

4127
02:51:14,570 --> 02:51:16,010
which is how most of us live.

4128
02:51:16,060 --> 02:51:17,680
Or even if we're in a neighborhood full 
of strangers,

4129
02:51:17,681 --> 02:51:19,940
why don't we make the time to make them 
not strangers?

4130
02:51:20,360 --> 02:51:24,310
It's fucking ass music.
Wife and a country dog.

4131
02:51:24,670 --> 02:51:26,020
Get Out of my driveway.
Fuck face.

4132
02:51:26,050 --> 02:51:28,540
I just moved into a new place and uh,
at some point,

4133
02:51:28,541 --> 02:51:33,541
once I get it all put together,
I want to hold an open house in my own 

4134
02:51:33,541 --> 02:51:36,571
little area.
Like invite all my neighbors that come 

4135
02:51:36,571 --> 02:51:37,330
by and fucking going to know how shit is
coming and stealing my shit.

4136
02:51:37,331 --> 02:51:38,830
Yeah.
Pancakes,

4137
02:51:38,840 --> 02:51:43,840
belt.
They're going to go out there and 

4138
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:43,880
fucking wander up and down the streets 
looking at some good ideas.

4139
02:51:43,910 --> 02:51:48,910
Josh Barnett.
What'd you need to do is be a fucking 

4140
02:51:48,910 --> 02:51:50,741
leader.
You need to go out there and start the 

4141
02:51:50,741 --> 02:51:50,741
Josh Barnett School for how to be a 
fucking man,

4142
02:51:50,741 --> 02:51:50,741
right?

4143
02:51:50,741 --> 02:51:51,110
Sorry.
The ripple in the water.

4144
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:52,370
That.
That'd be the drop in the water.

4145
02:51:52,371 --> 02:51:53,360
That starts the ripples,
man.

4146
02:51:53,361 --> 02:51:55,520
That's the best thing anybody can do.
And it starts small,

4147
02:51:55,521 --> 02:51:58,310
but it gets bigger and it really does.
You start by exam.

4148
02:51:58,560 --> 02:52:00,580
It starts by what you're doing just by 
being you.

4149
02:52:00,730 --> 02:52:03,190
Just by having a character.
Being a fucking man.

4150
02:52:03,450 --> 02:52:06,130
Starts Small and gets big like A.
I just found

4151
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:08,560
out that you were in my favorite video 
game.

4152
02:52:08,590 --> 02:52:09,150
Beautiful Academy.

4153
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:11,550
I guess I'm the wrestler if you enroll 
me up.

4154
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:12,300
How,
how,

4155
02:52:12,301 --> 02:52:14,910
how'd you get connected?
This is your second category game too.

4156
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:16,070
Uh,
I don't,

4157
02:52:16,071 --> 02:52:16,940
I don't know.
You know,

4158
02:52:16,941 --> 02:52:17,750
they just fucking,
they'd.

4159
02:52:17,770 --> 02:52:22,770
Somebody dug me.
That was into the game and they put me 

4160
02:52:22,770 --> 02:52:23,030
in it and not to mention there's a,
there's a game called no more heroes.

4161
02:52:23,031 --> 02:52:26,030
It was on the wheat and I think you can 
buy it on the PS three now even.

4162
02:52:26,500 --> 02:52:31,370
And the main character looks like a 
Johnny Knoxville.

4163
02:52:31,850 --> 02:52:33,740
But everything about the dude is based 
on me.

4164
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:34,880
Oh,
that's hilarious.

4165
02:52:34,910 --> 02:52:38,660
And a about the idea of,
of this guy going out there and fighting

4166
02:52:38,690 --> 02:52:43,690
the,
finding some debt assassin on accident 

4167
02:52:43,690 --> 02:52:46,331
and grabbing his weapon.
Now he becomes part of the assassin's 

4168
02:52:46,331 --> 02:52:46,331
guild.
And so the thing is,

4169
02:52:46,331 --> 02:52:49,900
he's now number 10,
so he just starts fucking fighting them 

4170
02:52:49,900 --> 02:52:49,900
all and killing them just to get to 
number one,

4171
02:52:49,900 --> 02:52:50,710
play this game.
What is it?

4172
02:52:50,800 --> 02:52:52,540
Oh,
this is where you roll up all the junk.

4173
02:52:52,600 --> 02:52:57,600
And uh,
he made this big giant ball of yarn and 

4174
02:52:57,600 --> 02:52:58,120
you're one of the characters.
I'm one of the characters you can,

4175
02:52:58,150 --> 02:53:00,540
you can roll up into this big ball of 
fluff.

4176
02:53:00,590 --> 02:53:03,350
It's my favorite game of all time to.
It's weird that you're in it.

4177
02:53:04,890 --> 02:53:06,310
Simply amused.
He,

4178
02:53:06,440 --> 02:53:07,180
oh,
he's a musician.

4179
02:53:07,190 --> 02:53:12,190
Way Simpler than that.
That's one of the more complex aspects 

4180
02:53:12,190 --> 02:53:12,420
of his life.
Powerful.

4181
02:53:12,460 --> 02:53:14,410
Josh Barnett,
thank you very much for joining us,

4182
02:53:14,411 --> 02:53:15,490
brother.
Always a pleasure.

4183
02:53:15,491 --> 02:53:17,130
Anytime you ever want to come on again 
and taught.

4184
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:22,160
I mean,
I don't think we really got to the 

4185
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:22,160
bottom of this because I don't think you
can,

4186
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:25,171
but I know it's your insight,
especially as an intelligent guy and 

4187
02:53:25,171 --> 02:53:30,060
you're allowed to fucking enjoy fighting
and guns and allowed to enjoy all these 

4188
02:53:30,060 --> 02:53:34,321
things and you're not a bad guy.
You're not a fucking a blight on 

4189
02:53:34,321 --> 02:53:34,321
society.
You're not a criminal.

4190
02:53:34,321 --> 02:53:36,340
You're not doing anything wrong.
And I think that needs to be represented

4191
02:53:36,341 --> 02:53:39,720
as well because in you don't throw out 
the baby with the bathwater.

4192
02:53:39,810 --> 02:53:40,750
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen,

4193
02:53:41,350 --> 02:53:42,700
freedom ain't free.
Okay?

4194
02:53:42,760 --> 02:53:47,560
It's not saying enough cliches.
It's guns aren't the problem.

4195
02:53:47,590 --> 02:53:50,200
It's just part of the US people with the
problem,

4196
02:53:50,201 --> 02:53:50,440
right?

4197
02:53:50,620 --> 02:53:51,790
Sure enough,
God bless you.

4198
02:53:51,970 --> 02:53:54,310
Whatever that means.
Jihad.

4199
02:53:54,910 --> 02:53:56,630
Alright.
Hello?

4200
02:53:57,400 --> 02:53:59,500
Salaam Aleikum.
What else can I say?

4201
02:53:59,501 --> 02:54:01,150
That's nice.
Josh Barnett.

4202
02:54:01,240 --> 02:54:02,100
Josh.
Yes.

4203
02:54:02,110 --> 02:54:03,390
Praise out and he's in.
Gentlemen,

4204
02:54:03,400 --> 02:54:05,970
praise and Josh Barnett on twitter.
That's B,

4205
02:54:05,980 --> 02:54:10,980
a r n e two t's.
Now each fuck just doesn't eat well.

4206
02:54:11,421 --> 02:54:12,400
Yeah,
but not at the end,

4207
02:54:12,430 --> 02:54:13,840
but we're constantly Barnetti.
I'm like,

4208
02:54:13,850 --> 02:54:15,410
no,
fuck that shit.

4209
02:54:15,411 --> 02:54:18,050
Oh God.
Could you imagine that?

4210
02:54:18,750 --> 02:54:19,980
It's too many letters.
I don't know.

4211
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:21,190
Fucking manly man.
Like you.

4212
02:54:21,191 --> 02:54:22,810
You don't need that many letters of the 
toughest.

4213
02:54:22,811 --> 02:54:23,410
Josh.
I know.

4214
02:54:23,411 --> 02:54:24,370
How about that?
I don't know any.

4215
02:54:24,371 --> 02:54:26,350
Josh is tougher than you did.
Toughest job you might be.

4216
02:54:26,351 --> 02:54:27,810
The toughest job on the planet are 
toughest.

4217
02:54:27,820 --> 02:54:28,830
Joshua are out there.
Huh?

4218
02:54:28,900 --> 02:54:33,900
I think you might be the.
I think it's really safe to say we just 

4219
02:54:33,900 --> 02:54:34,940
did a podcast with the toughest Joshua 
on the planet earth about.

4220
02:54:34,960 --> 02:54:36,340
Honestly,
I can't think of another bank at that.

4221
02:54:36,341 --> 02:54:37,290
On a belt buckle.
Yeah,

4222
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:40,570
that's my tree.
I don't know what the fuck that meant to

4223
02:54:40,580 --> 02:54:45,580
you to reference.
Like youtube reference to Joshua Tree.

4224
02:54:45,730 --> 02:54:46,210
Oh,
you.

4225
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:49,390
Oh my God.
You are fucking Weirdo.

4226
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:53,020
And go to the doctor.
Please go to the doctor.

4227
02:54:53,740 --> 02:54:56,470
My special available on Joe Rogan.net.
Five bucks.

4228
02:54:56,471 --> 02:54:57,070
He'd already fucked.

4229
02:54:58,220 --> 02:54:58,910
Great.
Great.

4230
02:54:58,970 --> 02:55:00,940
Great.
I love how great it was filmed.

4231
02:55:00,941 --> 02:55:03,940
Like the HD is fucking hardcore.
We used

4232
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:05,780
the same guys.
Positive image.

4233
02:55:05,980 --> 02:55:07,310
You're talking about the one that I use 
at.

4234
02:55:07,370 --> 02:55:07,940
Yeah.
You were there.

4235
02:55:07,941 --> 02:55:12,941
That was fucking hilarious.
The special out of.

4236
02:55:13,240 --> 02:55:13,920
Bring your name up.

4237
02:55:16,280 --> 02:55:17,420
Oh,
I didn't get out of the middle.

4238
02:55:17,421 --> 02:55:19,240
The eyes,
but I'll fucking kill that guy.

4239
02:55:19,870 --> 02:55:21,880
Fucking talk.
No fucking rapist.

4240
02:55:21,980 --> 02:55:26,980
I was doing a brock Lesnar rape joke and
brought in Josh Barnett just because he 

4241
02:55:26,980 --> 02:55:27,050
was there.
He's in the audience.

4242
02:55:27,230 --> 02:55:30,400
It's called audience participation here 
called ad libbing.

4243
02:55:30,410 --> 02:55:35,410
Ladies and gentlemen,
I add flavor to the stew based on the 

4244
02:55:35,410 --> 02:55:36,200
circumstances,
but it's available by Joe Rogan.net.

4245
02:55:36,900 --> 02:55:39,050
It's fucking hilarious.
I was in stitches.

4246
02:55:39,051 --> 02:55:40,700
I was dying the whole time.
Thank you brother.

4247
02:55:40,701 --> 02:55:42,980
If that's not alive and everything about
it was hilarious.

4248
02:55:43,070 --> 02:55:45,380
I do what I can.
I tried my best.

4249
02:55:45,410 --> 02:55:50,410
Ladies and gentleman,
we have so many death metal kids that 

4250
02:55:50,410 --> 02:55:50,410
love you.
You know that death metal.

4251
02:55:50,410 --> 02:55:51,590
Fuck good.
I'm happy people in the bands.

4252
02:55:52,050 --> 02:55:54,170
The do Johnny Davey from job for a 
cowboy.

4253
02:55:54,171 --> 02:55:56,280
He fucking heard me on this thing.
He came up to me at the.

4254
02:55:56,320 --> 02:55:56,840
At,
at the.

4255
02:55:56,870 --> 02:55:58,070
At the show is like,
dude,

4256
02:55:58,071 --> 02:56:00,450
I just heard you on a podcast like,
Huh,

4257
02:56:00,920 --> 02:56:01,580

4259

Huge Fan of yours.

4261
02:56:06,410 --> 02:56:11,410
He wants to even come on the show.
Powerful death metal will have been 11

the last.

4263
02:56:12,531 --> 02:56:17,531
You must because it will be history.
That will be the very last fight in the 

4264
02:56:17,531 --> 02:56:20,930
history of these trading organization.
It is over after that.

4265
02:56:20,931 --> 02:56:21,800
It's a,
what is it?

4266
02:56:21,801 --> 02:56:23,240
January one.

energy arena in Oklahoma City.

Guilty.

4269
02:56:29,510 --> 02:56:33,500
Eramo girl kill Amino Amino group.
Gets a type of horse.

02:56:33,501 --> 02:56:37,060
This is how you spell it.
G U E L M

Yes.
Are you sure there's not more vowels?

4273
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:44,250
No.
That's it.

4274
02:56:44,700 --> 02:56:47,340
A profit better and make them smile.

They're the shit.

4285
02:57:13,501 --> 02:57:15,030
It's like a fucking tablet.
I get,

I'm going to have to get it screened.
V that's it.

4288
02:57:20,791 --> 02:57:22,650

bush.

4291

supplements aren't you?
Freaks.

4292
02:57:32,550 --> 02:57:37,550
We didn't even get a chance to talk 
about junior dos Santos and Cain 

4293
02:57:37,550 --> 02:57:37,550
Velasquez.

4294
02:57:37,550 --> 02:57:38,990
Not Talk about that junior.
Here's the deal.

4295
02:57:39,140 --> 02:57:44,140
Cane doesn't get his take down game 
going with his distance on a striking 

4296
02:57:44,140 --> 02:57:47,800
early on.
And Juniors dictating pace and distance 

4297
02:57:47,800 --> 02:57:50,050
on unstopped and the takedown,
it's the only going to farms away.

4298
02:57:50,060 --> 02:57:51,290
He's going to take them out.
Uh,

4299
02:57:51,291 --> 02:57:56,291
I don't think he's going to one,
punch him again because he's not 

4300
02:57:56,291 --> 02:57:58,391
normally,
he's not normally a one punch knockout 

4301
02:57:58,391 --> 02:57:58,391
guy as you've seen,
but he,

4302
02:57:58,391 --> 02:58:01,451
his,
his head high accuracy is very high and 

4303
02:58:01,451 --> 02:58:01,451
he'll,
he'll pick it apart if can,

4304
02:58:01,451 --> 02:58:02,220
can get his down game,
his timing

4305
02:58:02,220 --> 02:58:05,460
on,
on fighting junior to initiate and score

4306
02:58:05,461 --> 02:58:07,290
the takedown early on.
If he can get it,

4307
02:58:07,291 --> 02:58:10,620
go and be successful with it,
he can win that fight the APP.

4308
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:13,250
No one's ever been able to do that.
It's an amazing thing about dosantos.

4309
02:58:13,590 --> 02:58:16,670
People are always so afraid of fighting 
him on the feet problem.

4310
02:58:16,680 --> 02:58:21,680
You,
it's just like we talked about what 

4311
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:22,820
Croak theater wasn't going to take him 
down if he wasn't getting in his face 

4312
02:58:22,820 --> 02:58:22,820
and slugging them out.
And you know,

4313
02:58:22,820 --> 02:58:23,940
juniors got great feet,
which is tough,

4314
02:58:24,270 --> 02:58:25,980
but a cane can do it.
Came,

4315
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:26,940
has enough.
If he,

4316
02:58:26,941 --> 02:58:30,960
if he's smart enough and if he can get 
the right mindset,

4317
02:58:31,170 --> 02:58:31,610
uh,
he,

4318
02:58:31,700 --> 02:58:36,700
he can put,
he put on his back and once it starts 

4319
02:58:36,700 --> 02:58:36,700
it,
it'll,

4320
02:58:36,700 --> 02:58:36,700
it'll,
it can continue.

4321
02:58:36,700 --> 02:58:37,480
You can keep doing it right.
You can't,

4322
02:58:37,550 --> 02:58:40,020
you get that timing down and all of a 
sudden you pick up on that,

4323
02:58:40,021 --> 02:58:45,021
that Shoulder Movement for that jab 
comes and you fake out you overhand 

4324
02:58:45,021 --> 02:58:48,380
right,
and then stop and you go right into the 

4325
02:58:48,380 --> 02:58:50,181
take down or you,
you pull them forward with some strikes 

4326
02:58:50,181 --> 02:58:50,181
and then he thinks it's some exchange 
and boom,

4327
02:58:50,181 --> 02:58:50,181
you get them on it.

4328
02:58:50,181 --> 02:58:54,930
I think another interesting aspect of it
can be if cain could take him into the 

4329
02:58:54,930 --> 02:58:56,310
fourth and fifth round because canes 
known for his legendary Cardio,

4330
02:58:56,360 --> 02:59:01,360
he ain't gonna.
He's still not going to be successful 

4331
02:59:01,360 --> 02:59:01,580
and less he gets that takedown.
Uh,

4332
02:59:01,610 --> 02:59:03,890
that timing down.
If he doesn't get that timing down,

4333
02:59:04,390 --> 02:59:05,600
no,
it won't even matter.

4334
02:59:05,640 --> 02:59:08,370
Powerful words from Josh Barnett.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4335
02:59:08,400 --> 02:59:11,850
that'll be the UFC this weekend,
the 29th of December,

4336
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:17,000
which will be going on an mgm.
You fucks Cain Velasquez vs junior dos 

4337
02:59:17,221 --> 02:59:20,830
Santos dose and it'll be happening live 
on paper view.

4338
02:59:20,831 --> 02:59:25,831
All right,
we will be back on a Wednesday or 

4339
02:59:25,831 --> 02:59:25,831
something.
Merry Christmas.

4340
02:59:25,831 --> 02:59:30,500
Merry Christmas.
Happy Hanukkah and whatever crime.

4341
02:59:30,930 --> 02:59:32,620
Goofy Shit.
You fall off the.

4342
02:59:32,850 --> 02:59:35,160
We Love Ya.
And I was glad the world didn't end.

4343
02:59:35,220 --> 02:59:40,220
Oh,
thanks for coming out to the end of the 

4344
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:40,220
world show.
It's fucking fantastic.

4345
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:40,220
Probably one of the greatest nights of 
my life.

4346
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:40,590
Thanks to honey,
honey,

4347
02:59:40,591 --> 02:59:42,210

4349
02:59:42,661 --> 02:59:44,190
uh,
an epic evening and,

4350
02:59:44,191 --> 02:59:45,420
uh,
we're just getting started.

4351
02:59:45,421 --> 02:59:46,260
Bitches will see you soon.
