1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,890
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,251
Now,

3
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:04,150
let me ask you a question.

4
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:04,641
I know you,

5
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:04,920
you don't,

6
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,130
yeah.

7
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,831
You're not going to say,

8
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:06,011
yeah,

9
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:07,600
I know Jamie's been watching lately.

10
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,291
Jamie,

11
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,930
tell me the truth as Pete
rose been killing it lately.

12
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,220
Tell me the truth.

13
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:12,851
J Rose,

14
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:16,220
what do you mean he been killing it
on national TV p baseball player.

15
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,170
What's he doing?

16
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,160
He's doing like this.

17
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,410
I'll analyze it,

18
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,880
but they got him and Alex Rodriguez.

19
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,460
Oh my God,

20
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,390
it Joe Rogan.

21
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:24,850
You've got watch.

22
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:29,620
This is 2016 Pete rose with
a bow tie because Pete rose,

23
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,490
no matter,

24
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,710
I've never been mad at p rose.

25
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,300
Pete rose was one of my heroes though.

26
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:34,990
Yeah,

27
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,220
Pete rose is one of my heroes.

28
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,110
I've never gotten mad at Pete rose.

29
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:38,944
He's human,

30
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,770
but in a way how they treat him.

31
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:43,000
But he was a junkie and he was
a piece of shift for a while.

32
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,590
Like he was a gambling junkie,

33
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:45,040
you know,

34
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,330
he was a piece of shift for a while,

35
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,371
but enough,

36
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:49,870
he's fucking Pete rose dog and he's in,

37
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,471
I'm telling you,

38
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:53,200
I watched this show one
night and I was dying.

39
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,550
How funny he is.

40
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:57,640
Like how crazy is I think
going to keep them around Fox.

41
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,010
I hope they fucking do well.

42
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,270
Did you ever watch him Joe?

43
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:03,470
Anything looking at both times.

44
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,550
That's classic.

45
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,490
How old is Pete Rose Now?

46
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,440
Fifties or 60s.

47
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,813
Sixties.

48
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,940
I just feel bad that you know,

49
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,041
there was a,

50
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,940
all the speculation that he had done.

51
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,863
75.

52
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,703
Wow.

53
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,910
Yeah,

54
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,250
there was all that
speculation that he had um,

55
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,170
gambled on his own team,

56
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,090
but I don't think that was ever shown.

57
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:31,810
Listen,

58
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,350
you have to assume I'm a gambling.

59
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,510
Can you do me a favor of Jamie?

60
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,310
Can you put up for Joe Rogan?

61
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:40,420
Can you put up Pete Rose Against
Ron Boon and the all star game?

62
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,500
This is when you,

63
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,420
I had to show people at
a ball one that I go,

64
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,370
you youngsters never know Pete Rose's.

65
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,060
No.

66
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,800
Let me just show you a Pete Rose's.

67
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,600
Pete Rose Tackles Ron.

68
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:50,230
Boom.

69
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,190
But the beauty of this,

70
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,420
it's an all star game.

71
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,220
You never saw this German?

72
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,143
No.

73
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,541
Look at you.

74
00:01:58,541 --> 00:01:59,590
You're beside yourself.

75
00:01:59,650 --> 00:01:59,921
Oh No,

76
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:00,130
no,

77
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,850
because I'm like get allergies is shit.

78
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,060
You have to look at this.

79
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:04,271
Look,

80
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:04,481
all right,

81
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:05,231
this is this guy.

82
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:07,980
How he played like this
guy wasn't American savage.

83
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,620
Oh yeah.

84
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:08,850
Right.

85
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,880
He's a barbarian.

86
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,303
Charlie Hustle.

87
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,250
This is crazy.

88
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,500
This is still the crime.

89
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,003
Look at it.

90
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,750
Oh my God.

91
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,580
He just took him out.

92
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,841
He tells him,

93
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,180
don't ever block that fucking
basic gun cock sucker.

94
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,860
Oh Shit.

95
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,480
Like he was the last of
the real fucking Americans.

96
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:30,470
He fucked up.

97
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,593
Yeah,

98
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,863
I'm a gambler.

99
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,270
And he wrecked that dude.

100
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,860
He literally tackled him.

101
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,751
Oh my God.

102
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:44,880
Full shoulder down.

103
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,260
Now here's the beauty.

104
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:47,550
If you put on yelled at them,

105
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,421
let me tell you something.

106
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:49,470
1973,

107
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,370
I was 10 years old.

108
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,310
I went to see the mets
against the Cincinnati reds.

109
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,780
I was in my fucking haven.

110
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,550
It was the fucking all star game.

111
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,320
It was the National League,

112
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,560
uh,

113
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,580
Eastern Conference.

114
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,490
And he beat up but house and his second,

115
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,563
I left there,

116
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,320
look at us.

117
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,981
I left there,

118
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:06,940
so fucking happy.

119
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:08,230
I went there with my mom,

120
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,360
my stepdad.

121
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,370
We was sitting behind Tony Perez family
and Pete rose is beaten up on bud house.

122
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,980
And I left that with my fucking Dick hard.

123
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:17,814
And that,

124
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,360
and I could chicken pox.

125
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,590
I had the chicken pox.

126
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,270
I went to that game with
the fucking chicken pox.

127
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,740
So here's my question to you.

128
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,480
Go ahead.

129
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,350
How come this can't happen today?

130
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,680
Because how come the guy can't run
into the guy at home base today?

131
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,130
That would be a much suspension,

132
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,730
three months suspension,

133
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,900
suspensions,

134
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,311
nothing,

135
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:36,700
right?

136
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,240
Nothing.

137
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,680
And that was one of the greatest,

138
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,300
look at that team right there.

139
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:41,134
That's playing.

140
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,130
That's one of the greatest.

141
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,360
You'll never see anything like that.

142
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,231
Yeah,

143
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,310
that's New York City.

144
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,780
This is fucking tremendous.

145
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,860
Oh my goodness.

146
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,611
This is awesome.

147
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:49,444
What a fight.

148
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:49,790
Oh,

149
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,623
did they cut it off?

150
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,820
What a terrible time to edit it.

151
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:52,720
That was just,

152
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,560
it was just getting good.

153
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,011
Yeah.

154
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:55,540
P has gotten a bunch of his fights,

155
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,374
right?

156
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,810
Fist fights he used to
tackle you at second,

157
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,140
but you know,

158
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,973
he played baseball.

159
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,383
He played,

160
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:01,690
you know,

161
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,440
Cincinnati,

162
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,060
somebody would get hurt on Cincinnati.

163
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:09,061
Reds and bench would automatically go
to first and plumber would play like a

164
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,460
plumber was like fucking God.

165
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,330
And he sat by,

166
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:13,541
you know,

167
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,910
it was just a Trump meta.

168
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,420
When me and Goldberg get together,

169
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,270
we talk about the Cincinnati
reds cause I grew up on them.

170
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,560
But at this point I think I don't give
a fuck about the hall of fame for Pete

171
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:23,590
Rose.

172
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,140
I know he gambled on his own team,

173
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,983
but if you know any,

174
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,740
if you know any history of
gambling and professional sports,

175
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:30,131
guess what?

176
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:30,964
Joe Rogan,

177
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,320
the all losers,

178
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,880
they all lose a ton of money,

179
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,160
tons of money from Archie
fleets to to fucking Pete rose.

180
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,950
There was another one that used to bet on,

181
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,290
you know the arch sleets still
didn't get caught Baeten on himself,

182
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,331
but he,

183
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:45,461
he,

184
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,290
he's known to fucking lose everything.

185
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,370
I'm professional gambling.

186
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,820
These guys all called right
from downstairs only they
think they're the only

187
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:52,654
ones who did it.

188
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,340
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

189
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,770
I have a brother who's a fucking moron,

190
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:01,030
but he's married to my sister and I
know he's a dumb fucking loser gambler.

191
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,380
I can't call him and say to him,

192
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:03,214
listen,

193
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,390
fucking Malique shore.

194
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,220
His ankles hurt until I bet against them,

195
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,551
you know,

196
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:07,510
whatever I can,

197
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,611
you know what I'm saying?

198
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,650
I mean a lot of fucking people do it.

199
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,641
Pete rose,

200
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,474
they hate him.

201
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,011
He used to tell him,

202
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:15,611
fuck you.

203
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,600
When you play like that,

204
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,590
what do you think?

205
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,710
You don't think your rest of your life
is telling people to go fuck themselves.

206
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,190
Who does that in 1973 in an all star game?

207
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,510
It doesn't mean anything.

208
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,240
So the players didn't like him like that.

209
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,640
He,

210
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,720
he was against the fucking
system like since day one.

211
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,670
Then he went and he became a player.

212
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,061
She,

213
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:35,260
when he was gambling on himself,

214
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:36,370
he was a player manager.

215
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,204
Supposedly.

216
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:37,730
What's,

217
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:37,900
Oh,

218
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,290
okay.

219
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,130
A player manager.

220
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,660
But me and my gambling mind,

221
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:42,010
he been gambling the whole time.

222
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,110
You know what I'm saying?

223
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,470
Where I start.

224
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,550
It's not to say that it just,

225
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,140
he just started gambling one day.

226
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:47,370
No,

227
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,980
he had been gambling the whole time
because in the 70s it was a little less

228
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:51,814
frowned upon.

229
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:53,931
What do you like to the,

230
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:55,510
I got this horse in the third row,

231
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,261
you know what I'm saying?

232
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:56,740
Yeah.

233
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,250
And Day that basketball,

234
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:00,590
but football back becomes a baseball bat.

235
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:00,891
Well,

236
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:03,410
people had bookies were really common.

237
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,890
Common.

238
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,723
Everybody had a book.

239
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,680
It's less common today.

240
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,251
Yes.

241
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:07,521
Today,

242
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:10,700
because everything's done on computers
and people could do stuff like that.

243
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,380
But,

244
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:11,660
uh,

245
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,740
30 years ago,

246
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,143
August,

247
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,890
the skinny guy would look at the bar.

248
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,840
You went to [inaudible]
and that's the book.

249
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:18,951
What do you want to do?

250
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:22,560
You gave him cash after three or
four or five fucking seat a week,

251
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:24,250
he starts letting you bet on credit.

252
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,410
Okay.
