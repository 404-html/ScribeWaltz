1
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,280
Bob auditing, leaning. Dong,
Dong Ding Dong. Ding, Ding Dong.

2
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,280
Ding Dong.
Ding Dong Ding Ding Dong

3
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,760
does that. The intro auditing,

4
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:40,520
Dong Ding Dong gum kind
of fucking intro is that,

5
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:43,940
but I didn't think being being done,
this is how relaxed they are.

6
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,110
One year in. We have no idea
what's going on. Like wait,

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,280
was that an intro just starts.

8
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:56,000
We've got to stop using music folks for
legal purposes and all sorts of other

9
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:00,520
shit. But when I got sued,
so that's our music. Oh,

10
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,690
what was that song I
sing? I don't know. Yeah,

11
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:11,840
we said copyright that sued them and
they want to use it as fucking horse.

12
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,850
We'll call it. Welcome to the podcast
pitches. Ladies and gentlemen,

13
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:20,840
the one and only Ms. Dot. Ari Shaffir
is joining us today. Thank you.

14
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,200
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

15
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,480
Ari would be here to promote
his shows in San Francisco,

16
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:30,370
but unfortunately for cunts,
they're all sold out. Sold out. I'm,

17
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,830
I'm super happy about it.
He's balling storyteller shows.

18
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,330
So you going to promote subway instead?
Sandwiches.

19
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,080
So where are these shows at?
So people know where they
can't go. The purple onion,

20
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,880
they might release them
that they have to show up.

21
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:45,100
I don't really understand how that works.
Well,

22
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,960
what happens is sometimes people reserve
them and they don't pick them up and

23
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:51,350
they don't pay for him and they flake,
which I'm sure happens at time,

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,970
especially in San Francisco. He fuck it,
flaky free. I buy second sentence raining.

25
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:58,880
It's like, no, I'm not going
anywhere. People just flake, dude.

26
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,490
There's a certain amount of
people that always flake.

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,640
No matter how bad ass the concert is,
pink Floyd's the wall,

28
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:06,740
whatever the fuck it is.
I think it was just going to flake.

29
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:07,574
There's a certain amount.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,220
You just have to accept that if friend
just had a birthday party and she was

31
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:12,730
pissed because more people said they
were going to show up and do it,

32
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,500
and I was like, Oh, you've never tried
to promote a show, nobody comes. Yeah.

33
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:19,910
And that's, that's ridiculous.
Have unreasonable expectations.

34
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,490
The worst is when you buy tickets and
then you break up at the girl and then

35
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:23,061
you're like,
ah,

36
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:28,061
I don't want to see fucking
whoever block Morrissey and to uh,

37
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,770
to Coachella. Well, first of all,
you're dating some depressing bitches.

38
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:37,130
If they want to go see Morrison,
we might've found a problem.

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,420
Morrissey, man, if you ever wanted
to cry, Mexicans are under them.

40
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,550
Them to and to Morris Morris in this mess.

41
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:46,790
I have no idea why Mexicans
are super into Morrissey. Wow.

42
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:51,120
Maybe Mexicans totally wished they
were whiny white people, right?

43
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:54,410
Of a Mexican Sarah into
flashlights. Oh, that's right.

44
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:58,460
We're sponsored by the flashlight.
Flashlight. Doctor Suck. The subtle segue,

45
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,340
if you go Joe rogan.net,

46
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,590
there's a link for a flashlight and click
the link and enter in a the word rogue

47
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:06,580
and you get 15% off.
We're just trying to save you money.

48
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,980
Bitches are just trying to save
people money on flushed lights.

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,870
I don't want any buddy beaten off for
retail. Just don't think that's right

50
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,680
at his girl. Find my flesh language. Do
you really use this? And I'm like, yeah,

51
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,740
yeah, you want to watch? And she's just
starts putting her fingers. And I'm like,

52
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,620
you do know. I just said I, you could use
it. She gets, I don't care. You washed it,

53
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,200
right? I'm like, yeah, I guess.
How often do you not wash it?

54
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,590
This is the girl you were
boning. Uh Huh. No, just uh,

55
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,930
please touch her house or boning. Yeah.
You're trying to vote on them? No, no,

56
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,120
it's just my landlord. Oh, you're Atlanta
was not playing with their fleshlight.

57
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,020
Brian story is full of holes.

58
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,820
I was coming up short
last month in rent and

59
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,970
feed off into the fleshlight
for, no, not that. Nothing.

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,913
It's like the scene

61
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,430
when he's hurling,

62
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,710
he's a toilet and she's talking
about something, but you know, fuck.

63
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:06,680
It makes you really want to take a shit.
I love that.

64
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,460
I want to see you hit their new movie and
they have a new movie coming out where

65
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:13,210
it's like about this guy that's married
and he gets to take a week off of the

66
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:17,020
marriage or something like that. Oh, it
was from the same guys I believe. Yeah.

67
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,740
Yeah. They made some great shit. They
made something about Mary too. Yeah,

68
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,330
I read this book. It was about
being a comic. Oh really?
About stand up? I think so.

69
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,510
If I remember just living in like
no apartment with his brother.

70
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,490
I believed it been doing comedy.
I remember

71
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,760
it's been so long. They're
east coast guys. The comedy
writer is what it's called.

72
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,480
Do you got? Oh yeah. You've got
to wash. Speaking of comedy,

73
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,210
got to watch Denis Leary's new
comedy central special. Oh is it?

74
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,310
Must be that good. Wow. You're like,

75
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,980
like didn't talk down to you like an
actor who's never really done standup,

76
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,890
has to write his own material
and then play a standup in
a movie. No, really just,

77
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,100
is it just rusty? It's just death.
There's just nothing funny there.

78
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,810
It's just a missing. What's funny, would
you ever have him on the podcast? A No,

79
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,880
because I don't want them over my
house and I would probably want to,

80
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,670
you could always go to the desk squad to,

81
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,740
he's the type of guy that would be like
kind of threatened you and for talking

82
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:12,250
the truth. He's not a good
guy, you know, the, the whole,

83
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,350
the whole scene is just
ugly. But it was fascinating
watching it. You know, I, I've,

84
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,150
I root for people, man. I
wanted it to be good. You know,

85
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:22,780
I would not get a work out and stuff
beforehand. He's not in the same guy.

86
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,190
He live in la? Yeah, I think so. I Dunno.

87
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,010
I've never heard of been
working on is actually,

88
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:30,940
I think he lives in the east coast. Okay.
I root for him, man. I swear to God,

89
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,480
I root for everybody would be better and
root for everybody to to get over their

90
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:38,800
bullshit. You know everybody
that's done shady shit in the past.

91
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,220
If you even, you got to feel that this
is shady. I root for, I swear to God,

92
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,200
but fuck, fuck. It was just a void.

93
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,040
It was a void. Know here's my
favorite comic. When I first started,

94
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,000
when I was an open microphone,
like six months. Who's my
favorite comic? Really? Oh,

95
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:58,070
he was just killer.
He was just Troyer and like so much more

96
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,900
aggressive than anybody
I've ever seen on stage.

97
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,500
So much more like my kind of comedy
and like the type of people that I was

98
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:06,020
hanging around with and like the,
the shit that I was used to, I was,

99
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,970
he's the hard people.
You know,

100
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,090
like the comedy that I was used to is
all from mostly from boxing gems from my,

101
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,840
my, my boxing coach, Joe Lake,

102
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,620
the guy who had his finger bitten off
a street fight and had a toe attached

103
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:22,430
where his finger was and
curled permanently so he
could keep throwing right

104
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:26,300
hooks. Not Kidding. He had his
stroke. I had my belt put curled.

105
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,170
I had it done like this, so I could
fucking told her. Right. Yeah, he's crazy.

106
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:33,080
He was on he,
he's far fucking animal.

107
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,900
I don't want to tell all the stories
that I know because I don't know what he

108
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:37,310
wants to get out there on the Internet,

109
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,340
but these are the type of people I was
hanging out with forms that kind of

110
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:42,260
surgery. There's bedroom, there's,

111
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:46,250
did they do that finger back and he
told the doctor what Craig or Dr Bunch,

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,890
you know, he didn't want a straight
finger. That would be terrible.

113
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,500
It gets stuck in the boxing
glove because I couldn't move.

114
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,380
He couldn't articulate the finger
anymore because the nerves are gone. Oh,

115
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,333
they're all separate.

116
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,100
Somebody bit his fucking
finger off and it's true. Ah,

117
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,230
how does it get to that move?

118
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,130
Like at what point are you losing
my friend Mike [inaudible] time?

119
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:10,460
My friend Mike Blight was a bouncer at
the rathskeller and he was a professional

120
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:13,880
boxer and he wasn't,
I mean he would drink occasionally,

121
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:17,600
but we wasn't drinking when he was
there and he didn't look like a killer.

122
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:21,020
He looks like a very, he's a very smart
guy too. And he's very well spoken,

123
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,100
but he's a straight south Boston
thug and he worked glasses and ship.

124
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,100
He's a pro boxer and so he would just
totally get off on just lighting up drunk

125
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,440
college dudes,
you know,

126
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,720
guides who would get stupid and guys that
would get in his face and got and who

127
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:40,010
would allow them to like literally almost
pick on him before he would knock them

128
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:43,690
unconscious. Yeah, it just, he would
say, I'm a, I'm telling you this is,

129
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,820
you guys are making a big mistake.
You know, this is not the way to go.

130
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:48,290
I don't know.
I don't know how you're living your life.

131
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,400
And then he would just turn
on them whether you fucking
figure you fucking pussy.

132
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,420
Oh really? Oh, what, what the bank,
it would just just tee off on him.

133
00:07:56,421 --> 00:08:00,200
He's a pro boxer who's fucking good ones.
And then all their friends to be like,

134
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:03,860
you got to knock out by a nerd. No, he
was, he would knock them out. So scary.

135
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:07,610
They would all just slack jaw and
wait for their animals, their animals.

136
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,240
Nuke that whole era of us,

137
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,160
I should knock it out and it's lost
is the craziest place I've ever been.

138
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,200
I've never,
I mean in what I do shows there,

139
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:18,820
like the last time I did a show there at
that, uh, that, that theater and the, the,

140
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,320
the what used to be the combat zone,
I forgot the name of the theater.

141
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,530
10 action come. It used to be the
common connection. Now it's a theater.

142
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:27,440
The Wilbur, the Willard here. It's
a beautiful theater. That was cool.

143
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:31,700
I forgot that. But you realize they're
savages. They're just wild. Or people,

144
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,120
you know, they're more willing to
fight. They're, they're more than,

145
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:36,830
am I going to have complained about shit,

146
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,160
they're less likely to deal with
bullshit. Take your shit. You know,

147
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:42,230
they're less likely to let
you get away with anything.

148
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,920
Like there's certain shit that people
get away with in California that I didn't

149
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:49,790
realize like when I came out
here that people lived like this,

150
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,790
that like act or talk, you know,
like, you know when you eat here,

151
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:56,190
people talking on the sad
and just straight actor

152
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,030
talking. No one ever calls them on
their bullshit and it's like, Ooh,

153
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,440
when did you start sounding
like that in Boston?

154
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:05,640
Everybody calls everybody on everything.
You don't ever get to put on airs.

155
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,110
There's so many fights,

156
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,220
but it's also why there's so many
comedians come from that area.

157
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,970
So many comics came from that spot, man.
Whenever it happened to Dave Moore, Dell,

158
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:20,930
I was thinking about him the other day.
Is He still doing stand up? He's what?

159
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:23,610
A show for awhile. Yeah. Funny.

160
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:27,500
Had some sort of a comic standing for a
little bit, right? Yeah. Good comment.

161
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:30,330
A man. He's hilarious. I got
to work with him in New York.

162
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:35,290
I did a show with him in New
York. He's really funny, man.
He's, uh, he's, yeah, he's,

163
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:39,220
he's like real, like solid
professional, you know, really
good timing. Good writing,

164
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,920
good writing. What happened
man? Yeah, there was a,

165
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,280
I did stand up last night and it was
an actress that was doing the, yeah,

166
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:50,670
she was on the phone and she says
like, yeah, I'm doing standup tonight.

167
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,950
It's my first time.
It's going to be easy.

168
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,970
He was doing it while she's
gonna be so easy. Actually,

169
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,180
I had just paid $15 and what it is,

170
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,840
it's like 10 people go up in the audience
votes and I'm going to fucking take

171
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:03,210
this. It's, I mean it's,
this is gonna be like,

172
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:07,800
it's just never talking shit
about how easy it's going to be.

173
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,770
I wanted to stay,
but that would be the worst comedy ever,

174
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:13,250
so I'm not going to ever watch
that. Yeah, that's fascinating.

175
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,400
Know every talk you see someone you've
never done, you're going to be awesome.

176
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,660
Especially something that hard.
Never done it jack.

177
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:24,120
The owner was just out back around.
They're just like, just cleaning at her,

178
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,980
you know,
like just laughing his ass off.

179
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,800
There's people that think they're going
to be awesome at everything before they

180
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:29,430
ever do it.

181
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,040
Those are the Douche bags of the world
because they've never really tested

182
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:36,210
themselves and develop character where
character comes from its failure and

183
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:41,211
recognizing and being humble and you
know and feeling the humility and knowing

184
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,220
that, okay, you know what man that
no one's perfect. This is crazy.

185
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,990
Like all my Hubris of youth,

186
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:48,330
that's all it a logical and
it doesn't make any sense,

187
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,670
but the people that keep it like forever
and they have it in their thirties and

188
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:54,870
shit and forties and they just,
they think they could do anything.

189
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,070
Richard Taylor of the old manager
of the Congress remember? Yeah,

190
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,770
at 39 he thought he could still play
on some teams in the NFL and start a

191
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:05,550
quarterback. I still got an arm for
real. I've walked with be an all pro,

192
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,800
but I can beat song guys out. We're like
how cocky you have to be first of all,

193
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,360
no, you've never been anything. Second
of all, you're 39 even if you were great,

194
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,590
you still can't compete.
Now,

195
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,490
the only guys who can keep competing
like when they're in their late thirties

196
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:23,610
and forties and shit like the first
of all, it's very, very recent.

197
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:26,430
So you have to start
thinking about chemicals.

198
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,000
You have to start thinking about chemicals
because we all want to think that

199
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,420
everybody's doing everybody's
natural and just doing squats.

200
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,450
And I don't want to
cast judgment on anyone,

201
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,910
but when you look at like
40 year old athletes,

202
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:42,780
there was no bread farms when I was a kid,
they didn't exist.

203
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,950
There's no 40 year old dudes
playing professional football.

204
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:50,130
What in the Super Bowl
are you shitting me?

205
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,010
That guy's got gray hair listening.
Even register

206
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,520
like Bernard Hopkins, there's never
been someone like Bernard Hopkins.

207
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,410
See George Foreman when he won the title.

208
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,360
He was 46 years old when he knocked out
Michael Moore, but well that's kind of,

209
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,190
he was getting his fucking ass kick
before that and he hit him with like some

210
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,190
legit old man strength.
You know what I mean?

211
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:12,790
Like the George Foreman was
just an old strong tough dude.

212
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,190
He never looked dug a young
guy when he was older,

213
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:18,880
he looked like a big ass strong
old dude that could fuck you up.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,320
And he worked out real hard.

215
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,620
You would push trucks and shit in his
driveway and he was like one of the

216
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,920
pioneers of like chopping logs.
That was all like old, old,

217
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:30,850
old school training shit. Back in the
Joe Lewis days, he brought it all back.

218
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,800
But if you look at like Bernard Hopkins,

219
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,570
he's 46 man and he looks like he's
30 it's the craziest thing ever.

220
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,280
There's never been a professional boxer.
I don't know. I can't, I can't say.

221
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,950
But you're saying it's weird.
It's fucking beyond weird.

222
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,890
It doesn't make any sense. It's never
existed before. Sugar Ray Leonard,

223
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:51,160
when he got to his like late thirties
it was a rap. You know everybody else.

224
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:51,850
It's a wrap.

225
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,850
Bernard Hopkins 46 not even 41 that
even 40 almost 46 and he's out in super

226
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:05,050
athletes. That means,
what's the formatting like
defendants title a few times.

227
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,890
Yeah. Yeah. No, he really fought
Tommy Marsy law said to Toni Morrison.

228
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,650
So did he defend it?
He might not have defended it.

229
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:13,540
He knocked out my horse was a champion.

230
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,840
Tommy Morrison had some
wacky belt. He won, uh,

231
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,740
from George Foreman.
He beat George Foreman.

232
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,550
I thought it was just a
contender when he got, no,

233
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,130
I'm pretty sure Tommy Marson
won the title. I'm pretty sure.

234
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,330
I know he'd beat George Foreman

235
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,920
decision. What were those belts
that used to tie in and you're like,

236
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:35,780
fold it around and then back of
like as London fog coats, the belts,

237
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,410
belts were on level. Fuck what
are no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

238
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:43,250
They were like the leather belts that
like were really long and then you had to

239
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:47,660
like kind of twirl it around.
Oh, you got it on right now.

240
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,280
Yeah. Except this isn't that
long. It's been that long.
Wow. Yeah. I'm wearing it. I'm

241
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,830
what citizen if becomes psychically
more vacated. The title. That's bizarre.

242
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:01,340
I don't even understand that. That's
still where we're in the vacate a title,

243
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,750
not retirement. I mean like I
threw in the garbage can. Yeah.

244
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:06,870
You know what the problem with
boxing for real, super crooked.

245
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,920
It's not just super crooked.
There's so many organizations,

246
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,340
there's not just one
UFC style organization.

247
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:17,430
You know a lot of people bitch about
UFC beam and beat in a monopoly.

248
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,130
But at least you know
when you have a monopoly,

249
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,120
at least you got white
one clear world champion.

250
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,960
There's a Wbo, the IBF, the WBA,

251
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:29,340
the WBC,

252
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,430
and a bunch of other ones that people
weren't sure whether they should take

253
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:33,060
seriously.

254
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,970
Like there's a gang of the world champ
and say somebody retires and make the

255
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:40,170
belts open. It's like, well, who do we
think is the most deserving of it? Yeah,

256
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,500
they do that.
They make guys fight,

257
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:46,840
but they all make a decision on their own.
Who would she be? Yeah, exactly. It's,

258
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:49,830
I mean, that's how it is with the UFC and
strike force too, because now we have,

259
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,070
you know, strike forces,
this big heavyweight

260
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,740
tournament that's coming up and they have
failed over and over and we got a lot

261
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:58,670
of good guys in their tournament, man.
But it's, it's almost kind of annoying.

262
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,540
You know, it's like, man, I want
to see everyone fight everyone.

263
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,920
I want it to be one big giant league.
There's gotta be a way they can do that.

264
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,650
They're pushing for that in baseball to
have a Japanese versus American world

265
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:12,560
champion really are we're real
world or real world champion.

266
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:15,980
That would be the shit that would be
the one that would be dope. You know,

267
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,000
it'd be dope.
I hate to say it,

268
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:19,580
but I would love if Japanese dudes
came over here at kicked Americans,

269
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:22,740
ask his son of a bitch, son of a
bitch, communists tug. There you,

270
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,470
there should be a,
where were you?

271
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,390
The problem is no one's going
to be willing to do that.

272
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,860
I was going to say with
UFC and strike force,

273
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,780
no one's going to be willing to say,
you know,

274
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,170
then the guy rep or whoever the champion
as he represents your organization and

275
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:35,570
you know each guy fight it
out for each weight class.

276
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:40,000
Like that's like too much of a downside,
you know? Then if you lose, you get that.

277
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,993
You get our champions.

278
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,850
And what if the UFC got all the
champions then strike force.

279
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:46,610
What they just go out of business
then, you know, if that gets tricky,

280
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,180
what are they going to, they can't
have, it was just an new champion.

281
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,600
I have a title. You can't have a
title, you know, but it's weird.

282
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:56,540
You know you got nick Diaz is a champion
over there and George St Pierre was a

283
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,080
champion over here.
But I guess what?

284
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,700
They're not fighting as long as they
keep Nick Diaz happy and they keep paying

285
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:05,290
them, you know, they're not
going to fight. Keep smoking.

286
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,360
I was right in a way that 10 whites,
a little wary of him too because he uh,

287
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:13,390
he got in a fight with Joe rigs in
the hospital after they were Africans.

288
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,790
They argued when they were in the
hospital and Nikki has jumped him in the

289
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,900
hospital. They had IV bags on and shit
and he's beating his ass in the hospital.

290
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:25,160
Stockton guys out of their minds. It,
him, him and his brother are there.

291
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:28,100
Look how those guys are the real deal.
They're not fucking around.

292
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,710
Don't talk shit unless you want.
You get your plan, your face bunch.

293
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,010
We hung out in Stockton and we hung up
that there was this chick at some bar

294
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,190
were there and we had like a 45
minute drive to get back home.

295
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:39,560
And the young guy and the tour
and the monsters store was like,

296
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:42,860
we were trying to get him some, the girl
was like intuit, right? So he was like,

297
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,270
I don't know if I can get it.
We were like, Hey, come on,

298
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,430
you're gonna come back with us and shit.
I was like, can you get back tomorrow?

299
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:50,180
She goes, yeah, I'll find a ride. She
just is weird girl at the bar. Let's go.

300
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:54,590
You're coming. Let's go. So we got in the
backseat and then he got really cold. Um,

301
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,070
uh, she started rapping. Yeah,
she started rapping randomly.

302
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,360
He got really cold to where he goes, oh,
I don't want to, I'm like, why? He goes,

303
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,140
she told me she was autistic and I was
like, what? I'm like, all right. Behavior.

304
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:07,430
It makes complete sense now.
I just thought she was weird and quirky.

305
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,790
So autistic people are well aware
that they have an issue. Yeah.

306
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,710
And she was doing tons of blow.
Oh my God,

307
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:17,450
that sounds so owning it and
then rapping 30 straight minutes,

308
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,100
autistic and low and she's a
wigger. I drove her back to her. Um,

309
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,670
I'm assuming it's not a black rooms
at a black or white girl and what she

310
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:29,240
rapping like a black girl. Yeah. Nice.
That's what I assumed. All those things.

311
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,860
It's kind of a painted for myself
because that would be the most,

312
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,920
this something very special about poor
white people that act like poor black

313
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,020
people.
There's a weirdness to it man.

314
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:44,600
Serious when like white dudes are like
real serious about being street and

315
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:48,170
acting pill. But like is it just a
poor thing? No, no, not necessarily.

316
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:50,190
I mean a little bit of it.
Sure. I mean cause their

317
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,550
world interacts, you know that they're
intertwined in other communities.

318
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,500
The poor white and poor black communities.

319
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,100
I mean poor people have to live
where poor people live. And I'm like,

320
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,160
and I lived in Jamaica Plain.

321
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,320
There was a lot of poor white people
and poor black people together.

322
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:05,640
But it's just some weird,
when a dude has a clear affectation,

323
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,260
just takes it on and all sudden, you know,
it's like he won't get crazy, you know,

324
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:11,460
you won't get crazy.

325
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,520
And yet like I've seen white guys talk
like that and you're like, wow, okay.

326
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:17,100
There's no part of the country
where white people talk like that.

327
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:22,020
You didn't see that on TV if this isn't
like a rural Greensboro South Carolina

328
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:25,000
thing and like, well everybody
has his weird accent there.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

329
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:29,970
no. You're clearly urban, black,
urban, black southern a little bit,

330
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,270
you know, and then the, and due
to New York do it too. A lot of,

331
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,660
a lot of white and from the north then.
Okay. Yeah. Still talking like a southern.

332
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:40,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two Guy. I've seen
guys do it, especially back in the, um,

333
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,423
in the 90s,

334
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,090
there was a lot of guys that would a
especially involved in like when I was

335
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,820
playing pool and I was going and
watching guys gamble on pool,

336
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,120
there was always a lot of like these sort
of thug type characters who were white

337
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,490
guys that talked like black
guys that would even say nigger.

338
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,110
They would say like this isn't a thing.

339
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:59,850
You've got to come here and
take all that shit. You're like,

340
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:02,250
what's this Nigga think he going
to come here and take out La Shit.

341
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,430
Shut this motherfucker who's up.
Shoulders are going to be like, wow,

342
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:07,980
like this guys.
It's like an alien personally.

343
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,810
You're near not just saying these things.

344
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,460
You think then that
guy's saying that line.

345
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:13,320
Do you think he still feels
it when he says the n word?

346
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,560
You think he's still in charge at all?
He's squirming a little and let,

347
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:18,800
I mean he must be on
Oxycontin's if he's hot,

348
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,760
you know you're a white guy and you're,

349
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:23,720
you're saying nigger and especially
he's got like, he had like, you know,

350
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,550
like a really shit short shaved head.
Like almost like,

351
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,600
like a almost like a skinhead but like
little stubble on his head, you know,

352
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:33,330
so it's like you were,
you were just so much whiteness.

353
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,730
There's whiteness everywhere.
There's whiteness all over your head.

354
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:37,580
You don't even have like
a bunch of black hair.

355
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,800
I look at you and it's curly
hair and I'm like, man,

356
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,270
this guy's like part black or
something. No, no, nothing.

357
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,470
He was like super white and I met Jason
Kidd and he's doing these things with

358
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:49,680
his fingers, you know, were
guys like shake their hand
in the air where they talk.

359
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,830
There's some weird thing like that
when they hold their hand approximately

360
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:56,680
forehead level and then they just
shake it up and down like Paul,

361
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,120
like knuckles out and certainly they
shake their hand up and down. Yeah,

362
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:04,410
it is almost like that. It's like a chip
dad. His arms up in it's just progressed.

363
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,240
Do you think there are
black eyes like deep,

364
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:10,440
deep in the hood who talks super
upscale white? Yes, for sure. Yeah.

365
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:13,210
There's a lot of black guys that would
die to be white and a lot of white guys

366
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:14,280
that would be die to be black.

367
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,890
The most people in this world
do not want to be who they are.

368
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,420
I feel like everyone else has
it so much easier. Cooler.

369
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,430
We will let the easiness
as an insult like, oh,

370
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,410
your parents paid your worth
through college. I know you're like,

371
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,520
my parents worked hard to put me
through college. Yeah. Is that bad?

372
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,770
The people want us to leave.
Everyone wanted me to be smoking.

373
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,650
Having it harder as the way
cooler way to be. Why? Yeah,

374
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,720
you didn't get there for real.
You ain't legit.

375
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,840
You ain't just treat so it's like a
stock and guys stuck with it for real.

376
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:44,130
It's like even move he there.
He gets a crazy place to live.

377
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,680
You want to live where you can go to
sleep and not worrying about fucking

378
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:48,160
gunshots coming through your window.

379
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,910
It's nice.

380
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,910
It's one thing you might be into
something like that idea of thrills out of

381
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:56,110
nowhere.

382
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,230
Some people like like living in Silver
Lake and hearing sirens all the time.

383
00:20:59,620 --> 00:20:59,891
You know,

384
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,710
there's people that like that they feel
like they're in the heart of some sort

385
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,720
of an artist's colony.
Arrieta's yeah,

386
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,300
I drove use of Homea Dave Silver Lake
and there's some of those streets that

387
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,350
look like straight Gatto yeah,

388
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:13,840
just straight like what Rick talks walking
over across the street with no tags

389
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:17,260
at all. Pitbulls yeah,
several weeks. Tricky man.

390
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,810
It's cause you got a bunch of hipsters
and they're living with a bunch of gang

391
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:24,160
bangers, you know? And I think a lot of
them must get robbed, right? Don't they?

392
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,570
Probably.
You've got to have bars.

393
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,070
I always worried about Dunkin Cause
Dunkin is like super into like living in

394
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,850
those kind of areas. He lives in
that was anyone even broken into any,

395
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,150
but he's like the first guy to wet
his pants. If someone, you know,

396
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,150
he's never been broken. It's pretty
crazy. The history of his theory.

397
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,570
What's the neighborhood?
Yeah,

398
00:21:43,571 --> 00:21:47,120
what's some famous guy that bad day?
I can't really tell the story.

399
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,370
It's pretty famous.

400
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,100
I don't know if he's talked about it
and I know he has and he doesn't want

401
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,180
anybody to know where he lives.

402
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,990
I just saw that with his girl now and
I just saw that documentary. That guy,

403
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,080
that Guy Jim Jeff. Well, I'll tell you
after the show show's over, you know,

404
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,010
you really can't say because it will,
everyone will know exactly where he lives.

405
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,570
He lives in a weird house.
It's a long story. You know
that it got a Kool aid guy.

406
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:11,170
Jim Jeffries. Is that his name was Jim
Jefferies. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no, no.

407
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:14,140
You're talking about the comedian? No,
no, no. The guy that got Yana trategy,

408
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:15,280
Jim Jones,
Jim Jones.

409
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,990
I was watching the documentary about that
the other day and it mixes the ido in

410
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:22,960
with the video and stuff with Gabby.
You guys seen this documentary?

411
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:24,220
I highly recommend it.

412
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,850
I think it was on Netflix or something
like that and it showed videos and it

413
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:29,980
talked to the guy's brother the
whole time. He's like, yeah,

414
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:34,030
my brother then told everybody to,
you know, drink this and do that. No,

415
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:36,870
it wasn't even cooler. Those poor
Koolaid fucks. Right. It was like,

416
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,540
couldn't even get grape drink.
Right. There's like some drink. Yeah.

417
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,500
And they were showing up there was
shooting it in the kid's mouth with like

418
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,500
tricky based or type things. Oh
my God. And yeah, and the niche.

419
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,290
I didn't know how many people
also died from like NBC News,

420
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:54,370
a senator or it was a senator
died. All the got there. Got
Shot. Killed, right? Yeah,

421
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,840
yeah. They murdered them. A senator. We
landed there. Yeah, a bunch of people.

422
00:22:57,841 --> 00:23:01,240
Well it got real tricky because you know,
there was a lot of them and this guys,

423
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,040
they basically were running sort
of a paramilitary operation.

424
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,660
You had guns and shit and
then guards and you know,

425
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,590
whenever you get control
of a group of people,

426
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,770
the government is not going to let that
happen. You get, you get a big group.

427
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,390
Like what they tried to do in Waco,

428
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,240
they had themselves fenced in and they
basically started their own country.

429
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,240
They started real a mini country and
this we're going to talk to them and they

430
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:21,400
just went in after him. The
pro, they killed everybody.

431
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,350
If you go look at rules of engagement,

432
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:28,351
it's a documentary about the Waco tragedy
where they just clearly show tanks

433
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,600
blowing fire into buildings,

434
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,500
tanks or knocking over buildings and
blowing fire and the billings like a bunch

435
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,970
of children and women died in
this thing. He just, the dude,

436
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:41,230
they sh apparently shots were exchanged,

437
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,070
a few agents got hit and you know, and
there's, there's video agents like getting

438
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,670
shot at and shooting people and jumping
into buildings and shit and breaking

439
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:54,050
into windows and one and one
agent actually almost got
shot and so friendly fire,

440
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,230
use a video, you could watch it that
where a guy, you know, it's craziness.

441
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:58,930
They're breaking into windows
and shit and trying to get,

442
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,500
but at a certain point in time they got
the go ahead use the tanks and so they

443
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:07,660
are knocking over fucking buildings with
these tanks and you see there these see

444
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:10,070
the the gun, you know the,
what is the gun turret?

445
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:11,300
What does that part of the tank called?

446
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:16,190
It's all going to turn to the barrel
of the big long thing that looks at the

447
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:17,240
bone Hakan death.

448
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:21,940
It cock the cock of death is spraying
fire into these buildings. Dude.

449
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,350
It's gnarly.
Gnarly.

450
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,050
It's pretty gnarly because
I mean it's clear cut,

451
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,930
absolute unequivocal
unequivocable evidence evidence
that that fire was not an

452
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,110
accidental fire that plays out.

453
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,830
That's how I remember they
said it just caught fire.

454
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:38,300
That's when we met up a tank or something.
I mean,

455
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:41,660
unless all this is completely fake
footage. I mean I wasn't there.

456
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:44,990
I don't know for sure,
but it seems like that's what they did.

457
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:46,820
I mean all those people
died and burned to death,

458
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:49,490
but it is fire happen all the time.
How does fire happened?

459
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:51,590
Just all of a sudden your
house caught fire. Sorry. Oops.

460
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,090
How rare is it that fucking,

461
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:56,360
you know your got gigantic
compound with filled with bullets.

462
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,370
It's been around forever.
Yeah. Where is it? Where is it?

463
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,430
That shit just catches fire,
you know,

464
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,460
and there's videos of these tanks
knocking over buildings, blowing fire.

465
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,300
You can't be shooting at the government
are the, they're Ruby Ridge Shit.

466
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:09,740
Same Shit.
They're gonna kill you man.

467
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,140
I was in his room when that happened
and I remember my uncle and I asked him,

468
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:16,650
he looks, what's up with that?
What are the, I was like,
I don't know, weird thing.

469
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,730
I'm 18 I don't know anything
you're supposed to know. Yeah.

470
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,970
It represent your country. You're
not allowed to do that, man.

471
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:25,670
You're not allowed to start your
own country inside our country.

472
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:29,700
You can't just put up a fence and have
a military vehicles and everyone's got,

473
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,090
got like guns out in the open.

474
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,670
They would walk around with
like guns out rifles and shit.

475
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,950
Nino because stock pile of weapons.

476
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,740
They were just letting everybody know
that they're are protected and that this

477
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:42,700
is, you know, this is an arm
community and this one guy,

478
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,950
he's just banging everybody's wife. One
guy who was, that's what it was all about.

479
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:49,250
This one guy who would like play songs
and it was to play the guitar and play

480
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:53,420
music and he, he fucked everyone's wife
like a different battle star Galactica.

481
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,140
He, it was basically a real sick,
real similar that Balt is our guys.

482
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:59,750
Is that what his name was? Who was
his name? The the dark haired guy.

483
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,060
I'm making it up his name.
I might've made up his name.

484
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,410
I forget what the British guy, yeah, the
British guy was the real swarming guy,

485
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,000
but this guy was a little bit more Jesus,
like he was a little bit more, you know,

486
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,290
Christ like, and he
just fucking, everybody,

487
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,730
just a brilliant guy who realized that
he can manipulate people and he got a

488
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:19,760
bunch of Dell people that were looking
to find the way and he brought them all

489
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:24,040
together and gave Balsam
Dick. Oh, of course you want
to fuck. That's what he did.

490
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,290
Talk to my, you want to fuck him?
It's just, it's a tricky thing, man.

491
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,470
Where the government says, no, no,
no, no. You can't run that hustle,

492
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,120
but what about your hustle?

493
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,810
What about your crazy taxes
and the Federal Reserve?

494
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:40,811
Not really even being a
federal institution and all
privately owned and banks

495
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:45,000
that control everything and Bilderberg
group. What about your fucking hustle?

496
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,650
All this guy's doing
is getting some pussy.

497
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,130
You know your hustling sees a lot
worse than what they're doing. Oh,

498
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:53,150
is it was just the guns. Was that, why are
where they would want to do that? Yeah,

499
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,910
because he's not for the guns and let
them go ahead and do whatever. He got big.

500
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,240
It got the compound was, you know,
it was, they had resources, you know,

501
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:01,800
people would leave the
compound and come back.

502
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:05,340
They would work in town and come back to
the compound. It was like, it got tricky.

503
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,050
It got to the point where, you know, hey,

504
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:09,750
if they decided to just
take over this community,

505
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,820
who's going to be able to
stop them? You know, do,

506
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,740
do we have to protect ourselves from
this like armed group? It gets tricky.

507
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,980
I don't know what the exact,
you know what, what they used.

508
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:22,470
I think probably they
probably use like child abuse,

509
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,180
which may or may not have been true
because it's cool or something.

510
00:27:25,181 --> 00:27:27,090
That could have been that.
It could have been sexual abuse.

511
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:30,180
It could have been any, I mean it might
have been true. I mean my own teasing.

512
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,460
I'm not saying that this
guy for sure you know,

513
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,210
was a great guy and the government
should have left them alone, you know?

514
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,720
But if we're really going to
go after people for child,

515
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,060
why the fuck are we not going after
the Catholic Church? Why is that not?

516
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:43,530
Why aren't they arresting the pope?

517
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:48,090
Why are they not going in to like guns
drawn to these organizations to finding

518
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:51,630
out, okay, how many of you have fuck
kids? How many of you are fucking kids?

519
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,060
There was a document that got released
that we were talking about before the

520
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:56,220
podcast started from 1997 that said,

521
00:27:56,221 --> 00:28:01,221
the Vatican sent a letter out telling
these churches to not report cases of

522
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:05,910
child abuse to the police.
That is some nasty shit, man.

523
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,210
I mean if that was the case was like
anyone who covered up and didn't report it

524
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:11,760
when they knew it, like they should be
arrested. Yeah. They'll be like, hey,

525
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:14,570
you can't, you can't do that. You can't
give up stuff like that. Exactly. Anyway,

526
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,560
if it was anywhere else, if it was, if it
was like, you know, any other business,

527
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,423
any other,
exactly.

528
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,980
Let me tell my boss and then I
won't say anything to the place.

529
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:25,620
Let me ask my boss when he wants
to do and the boss like, no, no,

530
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:29,340
you can't just check it out loud.
If your boss is business was fucking kids,

531
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,750
like that was their number one hobby.

532
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,280
We're going to go play
golf and they would say,

533
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:34,680
go play golf with the finger quotes in
the air and that meant they were going to

534
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:37,080
go bang kids. I mean that's
really almost what it's like.

535
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,440
It seems for some of these,
these priests, if you watch that,

536
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,670
there's a terrible
documentary about a guy,

537
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,740
but he shipped them all over the place.
Uh,

538
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,690
I think it's called deliver us from evil.

539
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,040
Let me tell you exactly what it's called.

540
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:50,010
I like coloring and I
like watching cartoons.

541
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,640
I'm starting to think my age group
is a kid. Deliver us from evil.

542
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:54,241
That's what it is.

543
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:58,020
It was that it don't watch it if you
don't want to get depressed because if you

544
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:00,480
want to get depressed it will
get you depressed. It's fucking,

545
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,170
it's gnarly shit man. You
know, you find out like their,

546
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:09,030
their strategy of like keeping these
guys from getting in trouble and how they

547
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,800
could just move them instead of
like strategy talk written out man.

548
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,300
They're good. Praise. Let's, let's uh,
yeah, let's just try to move around.

549
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,170
That's what rats,
the new guy.

550
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:23,370
What does the name Raskin or what the
fuck is his name? Poke poke county. Fuck.

551
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:27,180
The fifth where a former Nazi. Yeah, the
creepy guy was in the Hitler youth group.

552
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,900
That guy literally like actively,

553
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:35,340
like they know for sure he tried to
shield child molesters like you know that

554
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:39,030
the he did, they still move
on to the top. There's, it's,

555
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,190
it's an it's outstanding. No, no

556
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,930
debate,
no debate about it.

557
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:47,360
There's papers out there showing that
they are actively trying to shield charm

558
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:50,740
monsters and protect the church
from lawsuits and litigation and,

559
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,920
and just try to squash these claims.
I mean they must have,

560
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,100
it must be just an overwhelming
amount of kid fuckers.

561
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,170
I mean it must be like impossible.
The man was there.

562
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:01,980
No one else to promote to the top.
I don't think so.

563
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:04,450
When someone in the former heavily
you have, they're all fucked up.

564
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:07,930
I think if you, he's probably the one
that can sit in his pants the best.

565
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,360
I bet if you went digging
into some of those other guys,

566
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:11,470
he'd find he didn't fucking anyway,

567
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,730
but he knew about a bunch
of people who are good.

568
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,760
Maybe flux him every now and then
and the rest of them. It's a,

569
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:16,750
it's a weekend party.

570
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,980
Do you guys think it's most of those
people do it or most not because I think

571
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:24,400
it's like 99% was dump. Most dumb
people are child molesters. Right?

572
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:27,190
Like can you look at child molesters
and has nothing to do with intelligence?

573
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:31,920
You don't think like
that's kind of retired. No,

574
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,500
no.
Flip the baby.

575
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,400
Most of most of what it is is from being
abused yourself. That's what it is. They,

576
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:38,760
they,

577
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,030
they sort of replay what really fucked
up and damaged them when they were young

578
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,820
and then it just keeps going back and
they did it because someone else had

579
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,150
vampires. Yeah, exactly. It's a re
recurring a problem. It's a killer.

580
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:54,400
Had charm authored. Yeah. It's, it's
really, it's really a crazy phenomenon.

581
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:57,250
People that get sexually attracted to
children and sexually attracted to the

582
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:58,930
idea of raping and you know,

583
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:01,120
and holding someone down against their
will and that's where they get their

584
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:03,430
rocks off. It's very, very tricky.

585
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,810
It's really tricky than it happens to
them and then for some reason they wanted

586
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:09,810
to do it to other people, but there's
been so many cases of that. Yeah.

587
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,210
The best is that guy and I
have to catch a predator.

588
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,750
They call it was like a second time
or no, it wasn't that time. It was,

589
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,460
they caught him and as soon as they
call them they were like, he was like,

590
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,460
can you just send the cops in here and
have them execute me already? Oh yeah.

591
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,760
Yeah. He was like, I don't want to do
this, but this is all I want to do.

592
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,140
Imagine that's all you wanted to do
and I can't help myself just fuck.

593
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,820
I know it's gross. Yeah. That's
what I'm into. It's fucked.
It's fucked. Yeah. He's,

594
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,320
his brain was wired fucked up.
No.

595
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,320
Could you imagine if your brain was
wired great in every other way except for

596
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:42,330
this whole,
except yeah.

597
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,310
And so you're smart enough to
be aware this is frowned upon.

598
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,870
So it had to be some kind of therapy.

599
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,600
Like they could have made like a
fleshlight baby for them. And then just,

600
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:53,240
I tried this sink that's helping.
I think that if it,

601
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:56,950
if it helped them not fuck a kid
and like get into this flashlight,

602
00:31:56,951 --> 00:32:00,470
real doll baby, there's pills you
can take. Right? Give it a cute face.

603
00:32:00,471 --> 00:32:04,480
They give them pills to like, I don't
have no, what they do. I don't know.

604
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,450
I don't know. What's the, I mean
how the and libido little comb,

605
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,610
depress the Harrison.
It's different for every person.

606
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,140
What was trading at one dude,

607
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:13,510
he's not going to treat down
another dude does have lots.

608
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,110
How much resources are going to do
and straightening up pedophiles.

609
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,070
You got to kill him. There's too many
people in the world as it is. We know.

610
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:22,990
We know that we,
we just,

611
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,110
that's sort of what I think
in the grand scheme of things.

612
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,900
Just a couple of numbers. You Shit
you supposed to call it all agree.

613
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,070
We don't want them around the
dogs that do the same shit.

614
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:31,510
When dogs go to bite people,
man,

615
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:34,990
I firmly believe that those dogs should
be put down and I put down dogs that

616
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:36,040
were aggressive to people.

617
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,530
I've had dogs in my past that bit
people and we had to put the dog down.

618
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,100
It happened more

619
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,070
than once. Yeah. And uh, I think
that's what you have to do.

620
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,950
I really don't think if you
train a dog and you, you know,

621
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:49,130
you love them and you're around them,
but something's still wrong with that dog.

622
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,500
And that dog wants a bite.
People like, what's going on?

623
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:55,820
Why is this dog even associating people
with danger and people with wanting to

624
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:57,680
attack them.
No one's been fucking with this dog.

625
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:59,630
You've had it since he was a
puppy. Every now and then, man,

626
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:03,140
you get a nutty dog and you've got to
kill him. You've got to kill those nuts.

627
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,570
Yeah, because so look man, what the
fuck I had the dog with this temporary,

628
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,460
your dog had a doberman with to Stanford.

629
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:11,540
He tried to bite me once and it was just,
I didn't know he had to stand up.

630
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,270
My dog has an oral fixation that won't
stop licking and biting and eating and on

631
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,470
dogs. Dude, you got to give
him Roger. I do, but it's
nonstop. Like now it's like he,

632
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,740
she self-medicating,
he's like,

633
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:25,400
she has this thing that like a squeaker
toy that she just keeps her mouth 90% of

634
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:29,890
the day. Like she knows like if I take
this out, the rubber dog, Dick. Yeah,

635
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,700
call the fleshlight people.

636
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:36,850
You have to make a very firm rubber dog
eat dog dick that has like a meat flavor

637
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:41,270
to it. A fleshlight baby.
Yeah, that'd be great.

638
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,830
Flashlight babies for my dog.

639
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,650
Dogs are awesome when they're awesome.

640
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:47,770
But the bottom line about dogs
is that there are animals, man.

641
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:50,800
We were just sort of have this weird
trust and a bunch of animals that can kill

642
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:54,550
us and we keep them in our yards and
shit and people also put like emotional

643
00:33:54,551 --> 00:33:57,010
attachments on them.
But then if you look back on 50 years on,

644
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:58,870
you're killing your dog because he
was biting people. They'd be like,

645
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,080
this amount percentage, they don't know
your attachment. They'll just be like,

646
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,280
this percentage of dog was killed
because they bought somebody.

647
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,410
Here's a crazy story.

648
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,500
There's two people that I know that have
had a pit bull fights in the yard where

649
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,870
they had dogs and the pitbull wind up
killing another dog and they're killing

650
00:34:13,871 --> 00:34:17,140
another pit bull or killing a dog and
both of them tried to blame it on some

651
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:20,320
other shit. Like what? One of
them blamed it on a mountain lion.

652
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,670
One of them thought that a mountain
lion came in and killed a dog.

653
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,920
That's what everyone was saying.
But then my friend Bud said, listen,

654
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:29,720
I know those dogs and those
dogs used to fight and they,

655
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:33,190
that fucking idiot had two females in
his yard trapped up together and they

656
00:34:33,191 --> 00:34:36,100
fought in one killed the other one and
he wanted to blame it on a mountain lion

657
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:36,930
and I went,

658
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,580
ah,
okay,

659
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:41,420
that makes sense because
why would a mountain lion
coming to a house full of pit

660
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:44,820
bulls like Jesus?
Isn't there like a better way to eat?

661
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,900
You know how fucking id you have to
be you guys with your mountain lions?

662
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,310
I wouldn't have a mountain lion story.

663
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:56,820
Like I was at the grocery
store in a mountain lion
jumped on my face where I was

664
00:34:56,821 --> 00:34:58,920
living in Colorado because
where I was living in Colorado,

665
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:01,980
man there they lost 160 plus houses.

666
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,840
I think it was like 170 total, 179
maybe fire. They had a horrible fire.

667
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,580
The worst fire in Colorado history because
if you think about 170 houses in this

668
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:15,060
area, this is extremely rural.
This is a mountain community.

669
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:18,780
So it's all houses in the
mountains and 170 of them are gone.

670
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,520
So a huge amount of forest was burned
down thousands and thousands of acres.

671
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,570
So now mountain lions have less
territory where there's woods and there,

672
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,370
you know the,
they're already like,

673
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,270
they are in an area around people
and they do kill people's dogs.

674
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:34,020
They want to like,

675
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,930
they want to keep that open as an option
and they know that there's a lot of

676
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,010
around where

677
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,070
people are because of the fact that
people aren't killing the deer because

678
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:43,500
people are killing the deer in boulder.
Deer everywhere.

679
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:45,000
So that brings in mountain lions.

680
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,780
So now they have like more and more
mountain line signings there. Wow.

681
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,270
But coming in,
so then the other one about the dog,

682
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:55,290
the other dog story with a dog killed
another dog or this guy blamed it on

683
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:58,920
someone I know this dude who
sells weed and uh, he, uh,

684
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,630
was growing plants in his background.

685
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:04,350
He told me this crazy story where
someone broke into his house and,

686
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,860
and stabbed his dog and
killed his dog and then,

687
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:11,940
and then to run it ran away with
his plants and I was like, Whoa,

688
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:16,110
that is fucked up. Like you came home
and your dog was dead and then you know,

689
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:17,000
you cut your plants.
Uh,

690
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:22,100
well in time this story has morphed and
now what I've learned is one of the dogs

691
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:26,880
was a bulldog of female bulldog and the
other dog was a pit bull and the pit

692
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:29,220
bull more than likely
killed the female dog.

693
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,130
And he's like blaming it on like what
about the plants that are going well,

694
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:34,950
when he took the dog to the hospital,
because if dog was fucked up,

695
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,650
his neighbor who had been
eyeballing is plants,

696
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,720
hopped over his fence and chop
to shit down, stole his weed.

697
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,450
Every time somebody tells me sort of
crazy, unbelievable story, I'm like,

698
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,360
it's this reason. There's an
unbelievable, it's just not true. Well,

699
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:50,160
there's some good stories that are legit,

700
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:52,980
but that ain't one of them that I
was a mad at this guy like, man,

701
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:55,440
you made me feel like your
dog got stabbed. You know,

702
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:58,410
and then that felt for that poor dog
getting murdered by some, you know,

703
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,990
some fucking asshole just
wants to steal a plant.

704
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,620
And then I realized that this
idiot's got two female dogs.

705
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,540
I was willing to accept that if it
was two beta fish oil to females,

706
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,140
female dogs, man, female dogs do
not deal well with female dogs.

707
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,880
It's one of the things you like,
you know,

708
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:17,610
you can really learn a
lot from about nature,

709
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:21,600
from watching female dogs interact
because female dogs never choose an Alpha.

710
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,160
They don't,
they don't give up.

711
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,810
Like if you beat it like squeaky and Lucy
where my two dogs, they're both sweet,

712
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:31,800
sweet dogs to people. But both,
he would fight you for attention.

713
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,420
Like if you were petting one of them,

714
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,320
the other one would come
over and grout or like pitch.

715
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:37,590
But I get the fuck out of here. That's
my hand. I'm gonna get this pet.

716
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,340
And they hated each other because this
and they would never give up no matter

717
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:43,290
how much they fought,
no matter how many times they would,

718
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,790
I would have to separate them with hoses.

719
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:48,540
Sometimes they would bite each other
and Claude each other and go crazy.

720
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,050
And in the middle of a fucking picnic,
right. Everybody would be just chilling.

721
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,993
And then once you know,

722
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,380
someone would give one dog a bone and
the other dog would get fucking crazy.

723
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:59,340
And before you know it,
it's on check thing.

724
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,880
Like it is like your dog should
get a podcast. It is like, and you,

725
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:07,080
you realize like that's
just a nature thing.

726
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:12,081
Like there is a natural predisposition
to not want other women around you.

727
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,570
The other, especially other women that
are competing for affection. Attention.

728
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,560
That's why those women who hate their
daughters when they're too hot and they

729
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:23,370
can no longer hot. Yes dude, that's
dark. That is some dark scary shit.

730
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:25,890
When you got an old lady,
he was hating on her pre young daughter.

731
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,250
She's 37 daughters,
17 and looking good and I've seen it man.

732
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:33,180
I've seen it happen many, many times on
her daughter in public. Take the legs out,

733
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:36,010
every guys who their fucking
girlfriends mom comes

734
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,850
on to them. Wow. How about that?
Yeah, my mom's still sorta got it.

735
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:44,851
She's like 46 and kind of clinging on
there and I knew that this girl from Texas

736
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,150
who uh, her mom in her is like, like
she's a slant to grind in from Texas.

737
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:52,450
You actually know her too.
I and the mom is a slut,

738
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,860
like an older version of her and like
they'll come over and have parties like in

739
00:38:56,861 --> 00:39:00,670
high school and college and like her mom
would come out in like short tits and

740
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,490
fucking like, it was just
like, like hanging out.

741
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:05,610
Like she acted like she
was one of the kids. Whoa.

742
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,040
And she still does it today though with
with her, her Margaret. It doesn't,

743
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,540
but doesn't she get like super
rational and irrational fights too? No,

744
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:16,480
she's actually, I mean she works for an
airline and stuff like that, so she works,

745
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,960
I'm thinking of a different
girl. Yeah. Oh yeah.

746
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,280
We still have to talk about this so I'll
know exactly what the file often do you

747
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:24,620
guys bring up stories and you're
like, and this said, said person went,

748
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,510
we always try to edit around them as
much as they're particularly embarrassing

749
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:31,030
about a close friend.
Very difficult. Yeah.

750
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:34,140
You don't want to throw people under the
bus. That bugs the shit out of me, man.

751
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:38,050
When I watch TV shows or listen to a
radio shows and people throw their friends

752
00:39:38,051 --> 00:39:42,320
under the bus too, probably
she was doing heroin with, uh,

753
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,800
some dudes. You could just talk about
anything like Joey Diaz, like you,

754
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,950
you don't have, you don't
even have restrictions. He
doesn't give a fuck. Yeah,

755
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,960
I can tell that story. It doesn't care.
I mean, he'll tell you stories about me.

756
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,660
I was fucking Facebook east. He
wrote that he invited the, uh,

757
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:02,650
the guy he kidnapped 23 years ago
to be friends with them on Facebook.

758
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,860
And then we got accepted his request.
Diddy, diddy. I Dunno. I Dunno.

759
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,330
We need to find out.
He's probably getting it.

760
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,500
Getting harassment charges filed against
Joey does, right. It's been 30 years.

761
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,090
I was kidnapped.
She wasn't kidnapped.

762
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:19,360
He was held at gunpoint to a new house
to be like, where's your, where's your,

763
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,600
as the drugs? Yeah. Yeah. We took
it from one house to another.

764
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,870
And you've got to think that. No, he
tied that guy up, bro. Oh really? Yeah.

765
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,390
He tied that guy up and he had a machine
gun. It wasn't like a light crime.

766
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,170
Wasn't like he was jaywalking and they
got out of control. It's pretty intense.

767
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,600
It was already doing some shit. Yeah.
And on top of that, the, uh, well,

768
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,970
the guy was selling drugs and you've got
to think, anybody who's selling drugs,

769
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:43,030
who's selling drugs back then was
in the 80s. It was like the 80s.

770
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,950
This is how drugs are real.
Yeah.

771
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,810
He can't that can't assume that guy's
still alive. I'll be that guy. Be a lot.

772
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:51,790
That's someone else at the same name.
I live,

773
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,060
I grew up totally different than
mountain lions and muggings from

774
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,950
Columbus, Ohio. I was upper middle class.

775
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,860
You never ran out of milk and Columbus.
It's everywhere.

776
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:05,590
People make their own
milk. Holy Cow. Tipping.

777
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,530
But was it like growing up in
Columbus and then you know,

778
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,110
eventually realizing that the rest of
the world wasn't like that? You know,

779
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,850
I was thinking about this last night,

780
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:16,690
how weird it is that like my high
school in my school growing up,

781
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:20,590
there was only like two Asians. All
right. There was one girl, one guy,

782
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,660
the girl was named [inaudible],

783
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:25,420
which was a video game that was
popular or a company at that time.

784
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,570
So she was like, who is this Asian
girl? And she has the coolest name ever.

785
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:31,000
Kidnap me. Wow. And the guy,

786
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,310
I was his friend and we
grew up together and my only

787
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,700
Asian thing was like,
I was like in love with this Asian girl.

788
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,850
Like she was like the only
person like her of the kind.

789
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,050
And that's where I think I got like Asian
fetishes from one girl. That one girl.

790
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:49,670
So did someone else date this one
girl? Uh, no. She wished very shy.

791
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,271
You know,

792
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:53,270
I would buy her and those pencils that
used to take out the end and and put it

793
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:58,140
in the back by bottom. They
have like little cartridges
now. Oh yeah, I know. Yeah.

794
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,470
Yeah.
It was a big Japanese girl thing anyways,

795
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:04,050
like she would give me like a pencil
and then I'd go, oh, this is nice.

796
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:07,370
And you know, no, no. And then I had,

797
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,940
I had Asian several years later
and it was like, you know,

798
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,000
it was just regular sex and totally
broke down those walls. And now my,

799
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,250
the Asian fetish was gone.
But it doesn't,

800
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,970
Nick Adams stories talks about having
sex with an Indian for the first time and

801
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:26,630
then no girl would ever compete
without brown skin. Like plump woman

802
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,570
from India or from America,
American native American.

803
00:42:30,571 --> 00:42:33,500
Those bitches are probably wild.
Those are crazy jungle bitches.

804
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,710
It was weird about Mexicans.
It's like out here,

805
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,960
you're pretty much 50% 50 and
Mexican and white almost, you know,

806
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,440
short most everyone in
Columbus, Ohio, there was like,

807
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,060
I don't even remember any Mexicans.

808
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,080
Like I remember there was like when the
Mexican race started coming to Columbus

809
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:51,200
and everyone's like, oh my God, sell
your house, sell your house, you know,

810
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:54,740
type thing. Yeah, yeah. I
pretty much lived, had a house,

811
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,400
a three bedroom house that my
mom gave me. Yeah, I grew up,

812
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:00,860
she got remarried and she was like going
to sell and she's like, Yup, you want,

813
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:05,420
you just have it, you know, you know,
I do not have it but you, I mean he,

814
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:08,500
she owned it so just live there.
And uh,

815
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:11,450
I was living there for like three or
four years and I just remembered the

816
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:14,690
neighborhood slowly starting to see
more Mexicans and to us they were like,

817
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,360
so what was the problem?
People would freak out. No,

818
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:20,120
it was just that you can
tell the neighborhood crime.

819
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:24,320
Like my car started getting broken into,
it's during the Mexicans from, no, no, no,

820
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:29,060
no. I'm just saying at this time period,
this is the facts that happened. And then,

821
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,950
uh, my told my mom, I'm like, mom,

822
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,310
I love this house but I think you
should sell the house pretty quick.

823
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,870
And so she's like, all right. So she
sold it and then like two years later,

824
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,710
that neighborhood is fucking destroyed.
It looks like straight out of Mad Max.

825
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:44,870
Like the apartment sign is like,

826
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:48,140
she crumbled down and do your
mic is like really hot? Is it,

827
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,550
is it harder than everybody else's?
Are you doing on top of it? You know,

828
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:56,930
I'm just probably just on top of it. Um,
did, um, so did this, was this engineer,

829
00:43:56,931 --> 00:43:59,990
cause they do that, you know, they, they
do what's called blockbusting but right.

830
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,970
Real estate agents will go
door to door and they say,

831
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:05,180
hey Mike guns are moving in.
Yeah. You saw your shit now.

832
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,430
Well I think they actually did
move in now. That's the difference.

833
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,090
It would actually be like the British
are coming the legs of Paul Revere Shit.

834
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,110
But it's weird how like in Columbus,
like you said,

835
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,330
like we only had like the mix mud,
the puppy, you know, like the mud.

836
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,870
I didn't grow up with different races
and the only racist we knew like Italians

837
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,640
were all Italian. You know, they're
were just like, that's weed through it.

838
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:31,700
And three Italians, they all exactly
the same. That's how that race acts. But

839
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,250
Armenian, see, they still
wear gold chains. Gold chains

840
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,510
eat a lot. They're very
friendly. You know,

841
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:41,120
they're when Lasagna away from having sex
with each other, you know, it was just

842
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,830
crime went up when the Mexicans moved in.

843
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,280
It was clearly the Mexicans were causing
the crime. Right. Well it seems like,

844
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,390
but it seemed like the poverty caused
it. But if, if, if the Mexicans moved in,

845
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:54,460
you got to think that you're talking
about lower echelon or class four ports

846
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,810
were different team,
different Mexicans and the ones out here,

847
00:44:56,811 --> 00:45:01,190
something happened to a new job,
open up a new factory or some shit

848
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,780
started migrating. I
think you know, lately,

849
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:08,070
I mean I noticed from zero Mexican too,
like a lot of Mexicans in Columbus,

850
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:09,570
Ohio within five years.

851
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,930
Yeah. But isn't there something
that draws them? They're like,

852
00:45:11,931 --> 00:45:13,950
don't they must have jobs.
There must be something.

853
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,820
I think there's been a migration,
Marilyn.

854
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,910
There weren't very many when I was
growing up, but now there are more

855
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,850
pull man. It's just diluting
out everywhere, you know?

856
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:25,150
And I think they're just
slowly, it's starting like,
seems like it's, they told her

857
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:28,190
want to move into a platelet. I
know there's a lot in Colorado, man.

858
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,980
A lot of Mexican Martinez was there.
Fantastic Mexican food.

859
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:34,850
There's a place called pop who
says in Boulder, Holy Shit,

860
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,610
you got to get the maneuver noodle.
It's the real deal man.

861
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,040
Oregon's in there and bones and shit.

862
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,630
Menudo and there's fucking spectacular.
That's what minuto is. Oh really?

863
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:48,740
Udo is, it's not a bank. I was a
gay man and he was a band, but it's,

864
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:53,630
it's also a soup. It's this crazy
like beef and pork soup. Um,

865
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:56,150
and I don't even know what the fuck the
ingredients are cause they're different.

866
00:45:56,151 --> 00:45:56,984
Everywhere you go,

867
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:59,120
everybody's got their own different
way and make them a noodle.

868
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,600
But what it is is some disgusting,
fantastic,

869
00:46:02,601 --> 00:46:05,840
beautiful creation of where someone's
not even worried about what something

870
00:46:05,841 --> 00:46:06,470
looks like.

871
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:11,120
There's bones in there and literally
stomach tripe and there's pieces of

872
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:14,990
Oregon's like pieces of liver. It's
delicious. It's fucking fantastic.

873
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,080
And it just looks like how it looks like,
how it's so good.

874
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:20,280
It's supposed to be really
good after hangovers too.

875
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,180
And if anybody knows anything
about hangovers, it's Mexicans.

876
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,120
They know what the fuck to do.
They've got it down to a science,

877
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:30,860
throw a bunch of organs and bones into
a bowl and fucking keep that shit up.

878
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,460
Mexican women are so horny.
Are they? Yeah, no, no.

879
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:40,870
My friend has this Mexican girl.
Every time I see him together with her,

880
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,670
it's just nonstop. She's on
a grinding, she's moaning.
She's like kissing his neck.

881
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,430
She has three kids. Two,
three separate. Yeah.

882
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,600
No,
just 20 line.

883
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,840
But she is fucking so high and that's
all she does. She has one drink.

884
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:57,750
She has just, Whoa, what
a good kid. Yeah. Well,

885
00:46:57,751 --> 00:47:00,810
there's a reason why there's a lot
of Mexicans. Okay. It's just a fact.

886
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,720
They're debriefing. Yeah. So the
Mexican girl and you know, it's fine.

887
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:09,600
The Mexican guys are awesome. Rapist.
Yeah. The Mexican girls must be horny.

888
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,450
There's just no other way around it.
Even though a lot of Holocaust,

889
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,710
why would they love babies?
You know the problem,

890
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,460
I know if I hung out with a girl,

891
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:21,210
I got Super Hot Latino's 21 and she had
three babies and there was no condom

892
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:24,690
around, I'd still be like, ah, fuck.
Okay. Right. Let's just chance it. Yeah,

893
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:27,480
you would probably fucker. And then
later I'd be like, what was I do? Well,

894
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:31,320
in the poorer communities,
man, it's a problem having
kids, you know? It's like in,

895
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:32,530
in,
when you get older,

896
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:35,020
the real issue is the reason why people
want abortions because they don't want a

897
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:39,160
kid ruining their life, quote unquote,
you know? But in poor communities, like,

898
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:42,860
oh my gosh, she's got to have a baby.
She's only 16 months of crazy know,

899
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,260
like they don't, they, you
know. Oh yeah, your Mama. She
was only 16 too. It's crazy.

900
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,690
The both got the same shit,
you know,

901
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:53,290
and like it's okay and everyone's
living together so it's all right.

902
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:56,170
And they all help take care of the
baby and it's all family. You know,

903
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:57,070
poorer communities.

904
00:47:57,071 --> 00:48:01,060
What they do is there's more of them
in smaller places and they have like a

905
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:05,500
tighter knit sense of family.
You get a big ass place with a,

906
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:08,050
a family that's like spread
out where you either,

907
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,020
mom's never over the house
and grandma's never over.

908
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,380
It's like you see them on rare
occasions and holidays and shit.

909
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,170
That's not all Mexicans rocket.
They stack everybody together.

910
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,430
Let's all get in a house together.

911
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,810
That's really a better way to [inaudible]
family's cool. My friend's fiance,

912
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,780
she is big into like
rescuing dogs and stuff.

913
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,680
She hates Mexicans because
of the way they just like,

914
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:31,970
they take puppies and then they're
just, yeah, they're adults now.

915
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,130
Let them go and they just wander around
aimlessly in those neighborhoods.

916
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,440
The Mexican sign them
when you're really poor,

917
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:43,200
you don't fucking give a shit about dog.
You're on team people and you know,

918
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,090
that's just how it goes.
Yeah, I could see that too.

919
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:48,910
If I was Mexican or if I was poor
and I was living in some communities,

920
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,860
probably loved dogs and everything,

921
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,480
but there's only so many
things you can think of.

922
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,480
No thing number one is you gotta get
the fuck out of this crazy neighborhood

923
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,920
then worry about dogs.

924
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:04,240
So did you see the vice guide to
North Korea? Yes. That one is crazy.

925
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,030
How they like the food they don't have,
they have really shitty,

926
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:10,150
crappy food and they have this whole
display that tricks you into thinking that

927
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:12,880
they have a budget. Well, we're not
doing a good description description.

928
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:17,380
First of all gets vbs.tv and there's a
show called the vice guide to travel and

929
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:20,590
they go all over the place. The
scariest one, my favorite ones, Liberia.

930
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,420
But the North Korea one
was interesting too.

931
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,140
And what Brian is trying to say is that
what they did is they set up the whole

932
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:29,950
situation because they knew that these
guys were journalists to try to trick

933
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:33,520
people into thinking that they
have this luxurious way of living.

934
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:37,060
Then it's just like the Western world
and even though they are a communist

935
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:40,870
society and they're run by a dictator
that you know how we can go get something

936
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:44,250
to eat, but all these things they realize
we're just set up for them. Right.

937
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,230
When they went to [inaudible], there was
no other patrons. Tables were set up.

938
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:49,030
There was waiters and waitresses,
but there was no one else.

939
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:50,740
There were just some things like
house or so it wasn't, yeah,

940
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:52,000
they weren't real restaurants.

941
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:56,620
They literally set up food for these
people and set up like a servers so that

942
00:49:56,621 --> 00:49:58,340
they would have good propaganda.
So they would,

943
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:02,890
and they would bring out really good
looking food and put it on all the other

944
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:07,330
tables. Almost like if it was like a lax
Turkey, you know, so like it looked like,

945
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:10,120
wow, look at all that really good
food and then he would get served.

946
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,630
What he said was like, you
know, over fried crap. You know,

947
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,970
like it was horrible food. They weren't
really a restaurant. I'd love to.

948
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,620
So it was like a trick. The whole thing
was like a tree. And what's crazy is that,

949
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,430
that's almost like the whole country Oman
is, are they just as huge chick? Yeah.

950
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,140
They have nuclear weapons, you know, they
do. Yeah. They do have nuclear weapons on.

951
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,470
It's too late. I mean, the, the
real issue is stuck now. It did.

952
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:34,630
So that's an old school dictatorship.

953
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,440
There's one guy who's running shit
and he's got nuclear weapons. I mean,

954
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:43,120
that is a, that's a rare situation
where you have one guy who's, you know,

955
00:50:43,121 --> 00:50:47,170
essentially running a whole country
and the military is gigantic.

956
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,350
They have like a million people
in their military military shoot.

957
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,590
You would suck those
that, that, that host guy,

958
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,940
I don't know if you
remember this part at all,

959
00:50:53,941 --> 00:50:57,630
where he got drunk and he was hanging
out with like a soldier doing karaoke

960
00:50:57,631 --> 00:51:00,930
singing and he had assaulted them somehow.
It was that drunk.

961
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,850
He was just being a drunk dude.
Like he was just a Bajic.

962
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,540
The host is when I'm saying,
oh the fat guy. Yeah. He,

963
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,270
that guy annoys the fuck out of me. Not
host. I'm sorry if he listens or anything.

964
00:51:09,271 --> 00:51:14,250
But that guy was kind of annoying and kind
of Douchey had assholey. Yeah, I dunno.

965
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,700
Well you know,

966
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:18,520
I mean I think he felt like that guy was
playing them to them and that guy was

967
00:51:18,521 --> 00:51:21,520
his like, you know, the guy was
like a, a personal propaganda agent.

968
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,790
He's probably trying to fuck with the
guy just even for the film to make the

969
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:26,890
film more interesting.
You know, try to get it.

970
00:51:26,891 --> 00:51:29,230
But he said something
if it was really mild,

971
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:33,850
so whatever he said and insulted the sky,
what does that got really crazy?

972
00:51:33,851 --> 00:51:38,490
Where he wanted to kill him now was for
vice guide. Yeah. It's, well it's a,

973
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,150
it's a web show. You could watch it on the
web. vbs.tv. It's fucking fantastic, man.

974
00:51:43,151 --> 00:51:46,810
There's so much shit there.
I have problems with meet with,

975
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:50,200
like for me it's like one o'clock in the
morning. I have to decide, okay, I'm,

976
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:52,480
I can't watch documentary
now because if I do,

977
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:54,080
I'm not going to sleep
for like five hours,

978
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:56,830
so I'm just going to stay up and I'm just
a good cause I'll go one to the other

979
00:51:56,831 --> 00:51:57,664
to the other.

980
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,640
Then I start writing and start writing
things down about these different

981
00:52:00,641 --> 00:52:03,030
documentaries and the VBS places,

982
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,860
the worst website to go to at one
o'clock in the morning for me.

983
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,170
Cause that's just doom.

984
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:09,670
I just go right off the deep end and
then you go and start looking at the

985
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:11,860
Internet and I start,
yeah,

986
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:14,920
read the research and other sources and
writing things down and make sure we're

987
00:52:14,921 --> 00:52:16,740
talking about this on
the podcast and you know,

988
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:21,040
write a bit about that and how the fuck
is this still going on in 2011 blah,

989
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:21,670
blah blah.

990
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,650
Did you hear what Trent Reznor
did the other day? I mean,

991
00:52:23,651 --> 00:52:26,660
this is what's so fucking
cool about Trent Reznor. He,

992
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:31,360
he just released a website that has every
single tour date that he's ever done,

993
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:33,970
you know, and like the last back past
20 years or whatever. And you know,

994
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,740
they have all the tours aren't,
you know,

995
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:41,100
and then they're adding soundboard audio
from each tour and you could download

996
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:47,350
it for free. So I um, I went back
and found like the dates that uh,

997
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:50,740
I went to see him and I'm going
to like as much the ones I wanted,

998
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,110
I went only a couple of a
half the whole concert. Yeah.

999
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:54,370
And you can have a whole concept of free,

1000
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:56,560
the one that you went to
like fucking 15 years ago.

1001
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,530
This is going to be a trip for me.
Hoarded every concert he ever,

1002
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:03,190
I guess so like only, I mean there's a
lot of them that are up yet, you know,

1003
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:06,970
but there's a lot of them that are, you
know, that's going to crush it. So, oh,

1004
00:53:06,971 --> 00:53:09,040
it was so crushed when I got it yesterday.

1005
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:11,590
Right when he announced it and
it was like five minutes. I was,

1006
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,720
you couldn't even get on it. Yeah.
I was downloading one and it said,

1007
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,770
you're like a estimated
down like three days.

1008
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,430
I would like to find my guys is
bandwidth fees are going to be for this.

1009
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:25,440
How does he pay for the longest?
He's got money, he's balling.

1010
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,840
He's all like yolked out now. Trent Reznor
is like a kid and it's a big meathead.

1011
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:34,190
He's got like a big thick neck and shit.
She would come on the podcast,

1012
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,140
he would be the most interesting
podcast. You make. Nice. Nice with him.

1013
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:39,590
A long time ago you met
him backstage and you know,

1014
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:44,240
you proposed us ever talking about
this quarter? No. Great Story.

1015
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:47,610
Cool story. You know, so like before
the Internet was like big at all.

1016
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,370
I don't even think it existed or just,
you know,

1017
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,550
me like schools had it or whatever.
Um, what you were talking about. Oh,

1018
00:53:53,551 --> 00:53:57,750
this is like 93 maybe. I don't know.
Internet wasn't much. It wasn't much.

1019
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:01,350
Um, I was a manager of
a record store and, uh,

1020
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,440
I used to always have free cds and stuff
like that and I'm just sitting at my

1021
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:08,640
home. What's going, man, I wish I could
meet Trent Reznor and he was like my hero,

1022
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:10,230
you know? And, um,

1023
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,640
so I looked at the back of the CD and
there was an address I said like a

1024
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,460
whatever, nothing records Cleveland,
Ohio and had like a zip code or you know,

1025
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:19,800
and had the whole address. So
I wrote this thing saying, Hey,

1026
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,210
I'm a manager of a record store.

1027
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:25,800
I have like a nine inch nail fan club
that it's about 100 people read this

1028
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:26,700
newsletter I do and stuff.

1029
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,580
And I was wondering if there's any way
I can interview them or take photos,

1030
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,760
you know, and stuff. And they're like,
of course, as soon as a copy of it.

1031
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,010
So I was like, Oh fuck,
now I have to make a copy.

1032
00:54:35,011 --> 00:54:38,640
So I did like issue seven and it had like
letters to the editor or where it was

1033
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:42,250
like sound, what's Trent,
you know, favorite food. And
I would like make shit up.

1034
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,540
He built a fake news letter
with the fake news letter.

1035
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:50,370
I have it somewhere in my house and then,
and then, uh, had like fake articles,

1036
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:53,910
take that thing and scan it.
I know it's somewhere a great story.

1037
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:56,220
You should tell him to tell that
story and put the scan that,

1038
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:00,420
that newsletter and put it online. Right.
I should cancel it. And so then you know,

1039
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:04,260
a couple of, was it eight by ten eight
by 10 it was about five pages long.

1040
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,210
And so then this person called
me actually back and goes, dude,

1041
00:55:09,211 --> 00:55:10,290
we love this newsletter.

1042
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:14,400
You can have any concert
on track record label,

1043
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:17,790
any Marilyn Manson concert. It's any,
you know, anything on his regular,

1044
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,810
you get full access backstage, you get
full photo passes to anything you want to.

1045
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:25,740
And so welcome aboard,
Brian. This is awesome. Whoa.

1046
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,470
And so then I just started going
to every single concert possible.

1047
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:32,550
I got to hang backstage. I mean, I was
talking to Trent and taking photos.

1048
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:37,020
I was the thing that made me the worst
people are back there. I don't know.

1049
00:55:37,021 --> 00:55:40,650
Not many.
I mean 2030 at a time.

1050
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:44,490
At one of 20 and 30 how many other
ones were quote unquote journalists?

1051
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:48,690
I think I was the only one. I
mean, yeah. What was kind of crazy?

1052
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:52,560
It's being imagined. This if you, if
you grew up loving nine inch nails,

1053
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,030
um, maybe 18, 19, something like that.

1054
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,770
And actually I was younger
than that. It's like 17. Yeah.

1055
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,280
And so imagine going from your, like
your idol. I mean, Trent was my idol.

1056
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:06,480
He was the only musician I like.

1057
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:11,070
Then going to hear like here's
the stage Trent's right here.

1058
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,510
I'm taking photos. He sees me and starts
singing right into the, into the camera.

1059
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:18,990
So I have all these photos where he's
just screaming right into my camera and

1060
00:56:18,991 --> 00:56:21,460
I'm going to have a real camera.
I used my dad's old camera.

1061
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:24,400
I was trying to learn how to
use in a manual film camera.

1062
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:27,390
And so half the photos are blurry, but
it's probably cool that they're blurred.

1063
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,620
Some of them are crazy,

1064
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:34,200
like really cool thing that makes
me mad that they are aligned.

1065
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:39,000
They've been online, a nine inch
nail, red ban on Google. Uh,

1066
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:42,820
I'll find it. But, and then, um, so then I
used to, you know, go to Marilyn Manson's.

1067
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,780
I did it with Marilyn Manson.

1068
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:47,170
And one time I was hanging out
backstage with Marilyn Manson,

1069
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:51,810
this is when Marilyn Manson first came
out and he was like, you know, people,

1070
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,450
you know and stuff like that. And he goes,
Brian, go, Ugh, do you live around here?

1071
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:57,910
Around here? Right? And I'm like, yeah,
I live across the street. And he goes,

1072
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,930
go get me a razor. And I'm like, really?
Okay. Marilyn Manson, Marilyn Manson,

1073
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,410
Marilyn Manson told you, go
get a razor. Yeah, yeah. Well,

1074
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:09,070
and there was all these fans around him,
like what chicks and shit like that.

1075
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:12,160
There was women, uh,
block, like the tour bus,

1076
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,460
they were laying on the street in front
of the wheels so they couldn't drive

1077
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:18,090
away what blog that's on Flickr.

1078
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,770
But if you just Google red band nine
inch nail photos or something like that.

1079
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:25,360
Or in I n photos, um, so,
so, so, so, so Merrill man,

1080
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:28,260
so he taught, tells me to get a rage.
So I go inside running crappy razors,

1081
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:32,080
run back and he's like, thanks, watch
this Bryan, this is fucked up. Hey,

1082
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:35,560
who wants me to shave a circle
on the top of their head?

1083
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:40,030
And then these girls like, so just this
beautiful woman comes up and she's like,

1084
00:57:40,031 --> 00:57:42,620
I want you to do it. And he
goes, he starts to shaving it.

1085
00:57:42,621 --> 00:57:47,050
A little bald spot on the top
or here like a month. Wow.

1086
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:51,510
Whoa. Like a ballpark. Yeah. Wow. And
they were into it. They were like,

1087
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,300
those photos are,
you look at that.

1088
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,730
And you know what's also
crazy is a hanging out with
Jim rose circus, uh, member,

1089
00:57:57,731 --> 00:58:01,860
those guys. Jim Rose Circus.
Yeah. Behind them. That's all.

1090
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,100
Back in the day I used to,
you know,

1091
00:58:03,101 --> 00:58:05,650
hang out with them too because they used
to open up for nine inch nails and you

1092
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,880
just being backstage with
like the puzzles, peep guy

1093
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,820
guys. Great photos. Yeah. That
was like, I mean, I didn't know.

1094
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,940
I have no idea what I was doing. Folks,
if you just Google, go to flicker,

1095
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:18,780
F L I C K r.com.
And uh,

1096
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,880
you just Google red band n I n photos
and I'll take you to the website.

1097
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:27,390
Yeah,
they're fucking great photos and I wish,

1098
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,570
I wish Trent Reznor would come on this
podcast. You know him? No, no. I mean,

1099
00:58:31,571 --> 00:58:35,490
I'm back in the day, it was like he
was just blowing. That was during the,

1100
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,460
you know, when he was just becoming
big, you know, like fuck me,

1101
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,620
like an animal and all that crap.
That was a huge song and

1102
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,830
people, and so I also did, I also did a
remake of that. Did he really did know?

1103
00:58:48,831 --> 00:58:53,020
He did hurt. Oh, that's the,
yeah. Yeah. Imagine if you
did fuck you like an animal.

1104
00:58:53,021 --> 00:58:55,210
That gravelly old man voice.

1105
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:03,330
I was talking to this girl the other day
about that and they were like, she goes,

1106
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,550
I love this song. It was hurt.
And then I was like, yeah,

1107
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:08,430
I like the original better though.
Accident. She goes, she goes, oh,

1108
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:11,910
what are you talking about? This is the
original. I'm like, no, nine inch nails.

1109
00:59:11,911 --> 00:59:15,480
And she had no idea.
He wouldn't really use those words,

1110
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,040
hey songs to really be up on all of them.
There's no way.

1111
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,650
What's it? It's, it's weird because
I've done that a times where I'm like,

1112
00:59:21,651 --> 00:59:24,280
this is an awesome song. Not Realizing
I wasn't even the original song.

1113
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:25,340
I heard buffalo soldiers.

1114
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,600
I mean it was a buffalo who did, um,
what's the name? It was Neil Young. Right.

1115
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,990
And Bob Marley. Bob Marley. Somebody.

1116
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:35,480
You know who's the guy who we did one
of his songs. Oh, I shot the sheriff.

1117
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,450
Who did, who did we did that. Eric
Clapton. Yeah. I'd only heard that.

1118
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:41,240
And I heard Bob Marley's version
and I was like, what is this?

1119
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,270
Who is that girl sweet seam
in the middle of sucks. Yeah.

1120
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:48,090
It's Kinda weird that people can do that.
Just kind of like Redo your shit. Yeah.

1121
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,730
That most people don't know.
It's weird.

1122
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:52,490
And you don't have to try to get
our mission right. I don't know.

1123
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:55,040
If you get permission, you have to
pay them by the moral duty. Yeah.

1124
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,150
But it's weird.
You know,

1125
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:58,760
like sometimes I think it should
be better if it was like this,

1126
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,440
I don't think it would be better
if it was like that. Like, man,

1127
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,770
go write your own fucking
song every now and then.

1128
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:05,060
Then it comes out bad ass though.

1129
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,303
There's a few ones.

1130
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:11,180
There is a kid cutty song that I forget
the name of the female that re did it.

1131
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,300
Uh, one of his songs hundred times
better at sort of girls singing it.

1132
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:18,080
Then came up with the version of smells
like teen spirit. It's pretty great.

1133
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:22,500
Yeah. Tori Amos, that bitch you
stole wail on that fucking piano.

1134
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,510
She's one of the weirdest singers ever,
man.

1135
01:00:24,511 --> 01:00:27,420
It was something like super hyper sexual,

1136
01:00:27,421 --> 01:00:31,920
fucking creepy Weirdo about Ryanair.
Everything singing,

1137
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,450
screaming into the piano
when she's fucking slamming.

1138
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:35,940
Now you can barely understand the words,

1139
01:00:35,941 --> 01:00:39,330
but brilliant piano playing an
incredible voice. I was a preacher.

1140
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,290
Wasn't that one of molestation son.
Oh Wow.

1141
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:45,103
Girls.

1142
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:51,240
Some girls saying grammy winning artists.
Yeah.

1143
01:00:51,241 --> 01:00:55,710
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real
real soon. How's that thought for you?

1144
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,960
That was one of her lines.
Remember that boy,

1145
01:00:57,961 --> 01:01:01,440
you best pray that I bleed real soon.
I'm like fucked up.

1146
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:05,010
That's fucked up and
shot a load in me sparky.

1147
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,180
And that's already should have come.

1148
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:10,920
But I hope the next couple of days where
I didn't make people, oh that's curious.

1149
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:14,010
How's that for what?
How the line is boy,

1150
01:01:14,011 --> 01:01:18,450
you best pray that I bleed real soon.
How's that thought for you? Wow.

1151
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,190
Cause you know I still found a
girl thinks really deep thoughts.

1152
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:27,120
That's the words. What's so amazing
about really deep thoughts. Boy,

1153
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:30,510
you best pray that I bleed real soon.
How's that thought for you?

1154
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:35,370
Like fuck real thoughts. Fucking these
amazing deep here's reality deep girls.

1155
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:39,030
I just want to, you know,
wonder. It's amazing.

1156
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:45,030
Come back to reality. And I sewed
on thoughts from, from girls.

1157
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:45,600
You know,

1158
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,870
George Harrison said this once and it's
brilliant quote and I use it all the

1159
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,840
time. All I need from a girl
is to be attracted to her.

1160
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:56,640
Everything else I get from a man. And
it's really true. I mean, you know,

1161
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:01,080
you should have women in your life that
you have good conversations with and

1162
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,740
that you enjoy their company and you
know, you know, share a lot of interest.

1163
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:07,800
So that's all good. There's nothing
wrong with that, but if you don't,

1164
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,410
you're going to be okay.
You know,

1165
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:11,940
as long as you have friends and you
have chicks or you're attracted to,

1166
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:16,140
you know there's guys who live happy lives
contrary to popular belief where they

1167
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:20,850
just have girls that they have sex with
and they're attracted to them and they

1168
01:02:20,851 --> 01:02:23,190
have all their interesting time
and fun with their friends.

1169
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,520
The bachelor culture for a lot of guys,
man,

1170
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:30,480
that bachelor culture is so fucking
like the idea of being like a bachelor

1171
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:34,380
forever and it's so tempting dudes that
are roped down and terrible marriages

1172
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:37,080
and their wives scream at him and
telecom. Think of her now. I was like,

1173
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,580
I'm just enjoying single.

1174
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,180
I don't want to deal with
any sort of responsibility.

1175
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,050
It's anything that comes attached to
that. Very tricky. It's very tricky.

1176
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,290
I am happy,
but I realized that I don't have to be,

1177
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:53,340
I could very well be with some crazy
bet. She doesn't like kids, you know,

1178
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:53,921
or she know.

1179
01:02:53,921 --> 01:02:57,810
She has some unfulfilled dreams that she
feels like these children are holding

1180
01:02:57,811 --> 01:03:01,380
her back from. That's, that's a, that's
an issue with a lot of girls, you know.

1181
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:03,840
And then all of a sudden there's some
weird resentment because they, you know,

1182
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:05,850
they have to take care of the children
more than the father does cause of

1183
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:06,684
dentist at work.

1184
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:10,590
I have a few friends that had kids
that they did have that issue with.

1185
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,110
The wife would be mad at them that they
didn't have to deal with the kids all

1186
01:03:13,111 --> 01:03:16,350
day and she would like immediately give
them the kids as soon as they get home

1187
01:03:16,351 --> 01:03:19,260
and the wife were just lock herself
in the bathroom and you know,

1188
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:22,890
fill the tub up and wouldn't answer
questions and leave me alone.

1189
01:03:22,891 --> 01:03:26,970
Like he'll just as a weird chaos inside
your, your house and your family.

1190
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:30,900
So for guys like that man, and they
have a friend who's like just guessing.

1191
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:35,490
I grew up around a lot of pool
players and a lot of pool players,

1192
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:39,240
our whole lifelong bachelors. Some of
them wind up having kids here and there.

1193
01:03:39,241 --> 01:03:41,100
Some of them even get
married for a little bit.

1194
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,450
[inaudible] are playing pool till five
o'clock in the morning every fucking day.

1195
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:46,240
And they're gambling,

1196
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,540
they're going on the road and they're
going a tournament's that traveling all

1197
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:50,920
over the country and
it's just a wild life.

1198
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:54,210
And in like the 1940s and
the fifties in America,

1199
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,150
there was this big bachelor
culture of pool halls.

1200
01:03:57,330 --> 01:04:00,880
That's why pool halls were always
associated with like deadbeats and well,

1201
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,920
people doing the wrong thing and you know,
bad, bad people hanging out in places.

1202
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:08,100
It's because those are the guys that
didn't get wives and kids and didn't get

1203
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:11,490
regular jobs and just said,
I don't want to be a fucking slave.

1204
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:14,130
I don't want to live a shit life.
I want to have fun. I want to,

1205
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:17,750
I want to pay $10,000 sets
at three o'clock in the
morning. You know, they, it's,

1206
01:04:17,751 --> 01:04:20,380
it's just a, they just decided
that it would be more fun that way.

1207
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,330
I think a lot of it has
to do with divorces. Yeah.
Fucking divorce is terrible.

1208
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:27,360
Man. Crushes people as what it is.
He goes through one divorce, man.

1209
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:30,000
It ain't like a breakup
man. I have friends. I have,

1210
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:33,320
I have one friend that's been
divorced twice this fucking dumb.

1211
01:04:33,321 --> 01:04:35,860
He is in his third marriage now.
He's been divorced twice a week.

1212
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,180
Most of those batches are saying
we're had been divorced. No,

1213
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:43,330
I mean I made a divorced family like mom
and dad was divorced. I don't want any,

1214
01:04:43,331 --> 01:04:46,770
that's why he was going to be a bachelor
because I know. I don't know. I got that.

1215
01:04:46,771 --> 01:04:50,880
A lot of it is bad relationships,
man. It's hard. It's hard to be happy.

1216
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:54,000
I know a few people like that. That's
their version of relationship was bad.

1217
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,440
The mom download spot and they're like,
I just don't want to do that. Right.

1218
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:58,380
There's that. Yeah, there's,
they don't wanna get married,

1219
01:04:58,381 --> 01:05:01,860
but they don't mind staying with a
buddy. There's that, but there's also,

1220
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:03,750
it's fucking very difficult.

1221
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,090
Especially I feel like on the
east coast and the east coast,

1222
01:05:06,091 --> 01:05:08,550
I found it much harder because
a lot of the women were harder.

1223
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:13,020
They did have this like a lot of like,
like hard edge sort of, you know, brassy,

1224
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:17,860
tough girl kind of shit, which I don't
find attractive at all. I find repulsive.

1225
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:18,733
Yeah.
Like girls,

1226
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:21,520
like their hands on their hips and
they want to talk shit and getting like

1227
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:25,070
insult battles with you, you know, good
luck hooker, you know, take care of him.

1228
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:28,450
And I'm so not into that like getting
in arguments and chicks. I mean,

1229
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:31,600
how many times have you dated girls
like that? Yeah, most of the time

1230
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:39,160
I'm not into that man. You can't talk
shit to me. You can't talk shit to me.

1231
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:41,770
If you're my friend and you can't
talk to shit. To me, if you're dating,

1232
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:46,120
if you wanna start insulting
me and getting stupid
reasons because they want to

1233
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:49,150
because they're frustrated or they
want to pick on something about you.

1234
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:52,780
And you know, God forbid if you're
not the most successful guy, you know,

1235
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:54,020
God forbid if you know you're,

1236
01:05:54,021 --> 01:05:56,200
you're in the middle of trying to put
something together and then they start

1237
01:05:56,201 --> 01:05:57,670
criticizing you.
And I've had,

1238
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,050
I've had relationships with girls
where they are like, you know,

1239
01:06:00,051 --> 01:06:02,880
would critique what I'm doing
and you know what, what,

1240
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:05,950
what's going to happen if that doesn't
pan out for you and talk all kinds of

1241
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,810
crazy shit and you're like,

1242
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:09,370
I don't know what's going on but if you
don't pan out for you, what? I'm like,

1243
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:12,940
Bitch, I'm 21 or why? Why are you
getting so crazy? Like what am I doing?

1244
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:15,370
We can settle down. I was
trying to blow loads. Okay.

1245
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,250
And that's the only reason why we're
hanging around your my pussy dealer.

1246
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:19,211
You know,

1247
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:22,840
you're my God damn vagina deal and you're
insulting me while I tried to get my

1248
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:26,800
fix. I'm going to have to get it
somewhere else. Black chick, it's cheaper.

1249
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,590
That's what it is. Bad. It's like,

1250
01:06:29,591 --> 01:06:32,710
it becomes like some sort of
a fucking sex barter system.

1251
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,040
You're willing to tolerate
nonsense until you get older.

1252
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:39,820
And then when you get older you kind of
understand who you are and you attract

1253
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:43,060
people that are a little smarter,
a little more experienced in life,

1254
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:45,940
and then you can have real relationships
with people that you actually find

1255
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:47,680
interesting.
When I started going on dates,

1256
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:51,370
I was just trying to make the girl
feel happy, you know what I mean?

1257
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:54,090
Like I was just like,
just have her keep talking Fart

1258
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,340
crotch shot, which is have her
keep talking, I'll be fine.

1259
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:01,970
Just make sure she's having a good
time. And then later it's like, oh,

1260
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,630
I want to have a good time to just
talk about stuff. For both of them too.

1261
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:09,090
You do an I like, I like finding
a girl that's like really young,

1262
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:13,410
like 22 and then have them
having complete like, all right,

1263
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:16,680
I trust you. You know, like in
here, let me teach you about this.

1264
01:07:16,681 --> 01:07:18,810
Let me teach you about this.
And they listen, you know?

1265
01:07:18,811 --> 01:07:22,980
So if somebody came to me when I was
22 years old and gave me guidance,

1266
01:07:22,981 --> 01:07:27,030
creep gave me guidance, that would
be nice. From who though? Man.

1267
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,630
Maybe you shouldn't be giving guidance.
They're looking for a father

1268
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:37,530
like little things like just go rejoin.
Yeah, I guess so. How not to get too high.

1269
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,580
Got It. Know when to back off
exactly what your father pay.

1270
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:43,650
You know you don't know when to stop.
You think you're getting drunk as great.

1271
01:07:43,651 --> 01:07:47,510
Just take you know, three drinks
and then take a water. I said, oh,

1272
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,970
that makes sense. I can do that. It's
like little things like that. Management,

1273
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:51,800
art.

1274
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,890
That is very important because I've been
out so many times with people and they

1275
01:07:54,891 --> 01:07:57,530
just want to keep going. Come on.
We know the drug Nugent. It's like,

1276
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:59,930
I don't need another drink.
Why do you need me to have another drink?

1277
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,950
I'm happy right now. We don't all
need to go to a Bolivian together.

1278
01:08:03,951 --> 01:08:05,000
If you want to go to oblivion,

1279
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,850
I'll be right here and I'll
tell you what really for,

1280
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:09,350
and I'll show you where your room is.

1281
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,500
I don't have to go to
oblivion to stupid enablers.

1282
01:08:12,501 --> 01:08:14,000
They're looking for someone to
make them feel better about it.

1283
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,730
They're looking for someone to dive with
them. Let's go into this crazy pool.

1284
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:20,060
Come on man. I'm going to the crazy Paul.
Don't you want to go on a crazy book?

1285
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:24,050
You're like, I'll be right
here. Sunbathing right next
to the crazy. Cool. So Brian,

1286
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:26,780
even having a lot of issues with
girls, man in your life, I think,

1287
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,060
I think we need to write a book.

1288
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:33,250
Just changed the names to protect the
NSA because this shit is just too good to

1289
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:37,700
waste too much good stuff going on. A soap
opera, Twix, he vixen. He's, Look Brian,

1290
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:41,200
I think it cannot be disputed
that you are in fact a pimp now.

1291
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,220
You've got bitches. If I, if
I were all at camp, I didn't,

1292
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,500
we wouldn't want to murder
so many bitches. Well,

1293
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,750
no pimps loved her murder bitches.
No, I'm not going to murdering lynch.

1294
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:51,200
Are you concerned to think
that I would exiting ready? Oh,

1295
01:08:51,201 --> 01:08:54,260
you mean like if somebody else murders
her, that could be happening. The podcast.

1296
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:59,250
Oh see we don't do this like a lot of
those other guys, Bro. This is live.

1297
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,300
Okay. This shit is going to get
out on the Internet no matter what.

1298
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,830
It's on the Internet right now already.

1299
01:09:03,831 --> 01:09:06,380
They're probably chopping
this thing up and making,

1300
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:10,430
making a video of that as we speak.
So you should be careful.

1301
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,530
You should be very careful what you say.
You're paranoid. No, not you. I'm shit.

1302
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:17,130
Seriously.
We shouldn't,

1303
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:20,120
we should change the names to protect
the innocent and you write a book days of

1304
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:23,750
your lives too. Cause it's fabulous. The
story is fabulous. You what you should do,

1305
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:28,250
you really should do what you really
should do is start experiments.

1306
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,660
What do you mean like with them?
Yeah,

1307
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:33,880
it start life as an experiment show just
like yours. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

1308
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:38,100
We're in the labs. We are in the labs.
What are you going to talk about you?

1309
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,870
We're talking about gardening. Um,
there was a few people when I used to,

1310
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,730
when I first moved to California.

1311
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:46,610
One of the weird things is when
you meet people that are like,

1312
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:50,360
I'm sure you've met a ton of these people
that are in a open Mike nights that

1313
01:09:50,361 --> 01:09:55,310
have no chance. There's zero
chance. Yeah. Yeah. What does that,

1314
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:57,430
how weird is that feeling?
That's why you staying with this.

1315
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,760
You've been in this more than
like three times. Like why? Yeah,

1316
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:03,470
there's something absolutely wrong with
them there for a couple of years and

1317
01:10:03,471 --> 01:10:05,690
you're like,
you're not getting any response.

1318
01:10:05,691 --> 01:10:08,480
So they would become my science
projects and I would, uh,

1319
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:12,830
I would literally like make notes.
I'll be like, okay, now I see some,

1320
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:15,980
some resentment starting to show up.
We didn't have resentment before,

1321
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,480
but now there's some resentment.

1322
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:21,080
We're about five years into this thing
and now they see that other people are

1323
01:10:21,081 --> 01:10:23,300
actually making a living and
going out and getting gigs.

1324
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:26,240
And I would like be in the back of the
comedy store and people would be pissed

1325
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:29,030
that no one would take them on the
road with them. And I'm like, whoa.

1326
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:32,540
Like you don't even see your own
sense of why do you think you should,

1327
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,230
like you're not good, you don't do
well. Those are the weirdest nights.

1328
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:39,500
When someone would go up, like Damon
Wayans would show up and uh, you know,

1329
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:41,420
out of the, in the middle of
like Sunday night, you know,

1330
01:10:41,421 --> 01:10:44,360
they'd be a lineup and you know,
a bunch of comics like maybe get on,

1331
01:10:44,361 --> 01:10:45,194
maybe you don't.

1332
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:48,780
And then Damon Wayans would show up and
some guys put fucking Bull Shit, man.

1333
01:10:48,781 --> 01:10:51,890
What the fuck man, he's taking my fucking
stage time. And you're like, Whoa, whoa,

1334
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:52,790
Whoa, Whoa, dude,

1335
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:57,500
you really shouldn't be on stage at all
on Sunday and it's probably going to get

1336
01:10:57,501 --> 01:11:02,240
up there. Let's be honest. You were only
going to get up there and show off. Yeah,

1337
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,400
exactly. That's the other problem.
They would do the same stuff.

1338
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,860
It's all or the commerce store. I hate
it when people come in, like on Sundays,

1339
01:11:06,861 --> 01:11:07,310
on Monday nights,

1340
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:10,340
the pop pop a night and they go on
like during the employee section. Uh,

1341
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,680
but they hate it more if
it just doing the material.

1342
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:14,220
They've all a thousand times.
Like,

1343
01:11:14,221 --> 01:11:18,840
why did you come here during our sets to
come to the same crap you've been doing?

1344
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,960
The only reason why I could see anyone
wanting to do that as if you're just

1345
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:26,100
looking for a tuneup set, you know, it's
like you, yeah, that'd be fine in a while.

1346
01:11:26,101 --> 01:11:29,010
And you want to just kind of align some,
showcase something loosen up.

1347
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:32,550
You don't wanna do that on Friday night
at the comedy store was the most the at,

1348
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:36,710
I've never been to a place where people
like felt like you're taking away from

1349
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,560
their time.

1350
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:40,990
It's cause you're all junkies and you're
taking away their fucking juice. Yeah.

1351
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,920
That's all it is. Stephanie. Ask her,
Hey, don't want David tell came in.

1352
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:47,160
It was like his first time coming in
for like years that I'd seen. And uh,

1353
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,370
she was like, you gonna go on and
like, we're all like, oh cool,

1354
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:53,010
we get to see David Toe. And he's like,
Nah, I don't want to bump buddy buddy.

1355
01:11:53,011 --> 01:11:54,570
And she was like, I'm sure no
one will mind. It was like,

1356
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:58,830
what are you talking about? Of
course the mind, the letters stand,

1357
01:11:58,831 --> 01:11:59,910
but they don't want it to happen.

1358
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,150
They'll mind if red Fox came
out of the grave and was like,

1359
01:12:03,151 --> 01:12:04,650
I want to go on there.
It's like right after me.

1360
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:08,100
It would be the best time to go on.
People would get pissed. Yeah. Yeah.

1361
01:12:08,101 --> 01:12:09,060
It's a tricky thing man.

1362
01:12:09,061 --> 01:12:13,350
That the bumping comedians thing and
it gets real tricky when guys use it as

1363
01:12:13,351 --> 01:12:17,310
like a douchebag move when
they purposefully do it
and they don't want to call

1364
01:12:17,311 --> 01:12:19,740
in, they don't want to, they don't
want to schedule it in advance.

1365
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,100
They want that cloud of being able
to just walk in and go onstage. Like,

1366
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:27,420
look at me, I'm here. Forget
what you were doing. Look at me.

1367
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:28,290
I'm here.

1368
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,400
I have that problem all the term to you
jumping in like teachers go in there and

1369
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:35,190
just get that love. Yeah. What do
you do with it when you get the love?

1370
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:39,250
Give it to somebody. Oh,
you're so sweet. Some behind.

1371
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:44,400
So, um, do you think this is going to
have a happy ending? Your scenario?

1372
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,930
It's pretty crazy right now.
Yeah.

1373
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,510
Can you give two hours

1374
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:53,570
too much within a year or you won't get
one bite at all within like a year one?

1375
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,090
Yeah.
The summary is in a year.

1376
01:12:55,091 --> 01:12:58,900
The other two will both be pregnant with
his baby summary is ex-girlfriend's all

1377
01:12:58,901 --> 01:13:03,460
seem to be knowing each other and
combining to form Voltron's of let's work

1378
01:13:03,461 --> 01:13:05,500
together to keep each other.
You get him back,

1379
01:13:05,501 --> 01:13:08,500
but they know what they're trying to do.
All using each other to,

1380
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,641
to get each other,

1381
01:13:09,641 --> 01:13:14,560
but to get each other back and I'll
stay in my life. Here's the deal,

1382
01:13:14,561 --> 01:13:19,540
dude. As long as you keep smiling, you
win. Okay. As long as you keep smiling,

1383
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:21,220
you always went,
no matter what they do,

1384
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:25,530
if it doesn't hurt your it was when
they're all because, exactly. Exactly.

1385
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,610
They become parts of Iraq
building my own material.

1386
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:29,730
And if they're not your act motherfucker,
they're going to be my act.

1387
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:32,360
Cause I'm thinking about talking about it.
Oh they're in my act.

1388
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:36,460
Cause I got a whole a whole bit I've
been working on for years that you pay,

1389
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:40,820
you pay brow, you pattern, no matter what
you pay. It's a fucking, you know. Yeah.

1390
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:44,180
You can't, first of all, you can't fuck
over your head. Don't try. Don't do it.

1391
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:47,980
Don't do it. Fuck. Fuck. People
that are actually attracted to you.

1392
01:13:47,981 --> 01:13:51,760
You're your speed. Don't go crazy
when you start fucking over your head.

1393
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,130
Once you in the deep water every time,

1394
01:13:54,131 --> 01:13:56,800
sometimes that's just fucking over
your head is just a title. Like, wow,

1395
01:13:56,801 --> 01:14:00,940
you won this title. If you didn't have
this title, you'd be a little bit,

1396
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:05,590
go ahead. As being above your head.
You know the fuck did you just say,

1397
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:08,560
I'm trying to, I'm trying to
tip toe around things. Joe,

1398
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:12,070
I know what you're trying to do,
buddy. If you're, what you're saying is

1399
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:14,950
that I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll
preface. I'll make it briefer.

1400
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,830
What you're saying is that it
seems like they're above your head,

1401
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,760
but it's only because they have this
label when in reality they're not,

1402
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,750
if they did not have that label of
that one certain award. Right, right.

1403
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:28,390
You are just a crazy fucking
person. That's right. But,

1404
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:31,030
but that's the only reason why I'm
not above my head. That's that.

1405
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:35,920
You know if she's hot as shit. So
sort of is above your head. Well,

1406
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:40,750
see, you guys don't see anything
except the photo shopped version

1407
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:48,780
or what don up to be that
character or hanging out

1408
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,980
up to be that character.
If the,

1409
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:54,490
you know how much makeup would be
so popular if that was the case,

1410
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:56,680
if we looked at completely bitches
could just throw something like that.

1411
01:14:56,681 --> 01:15:00,070
Pixie dust on their face. We're
not saying you're an ugly guy, bro.

1412
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:02,800
Don't get me wrong. You're a very handsome
young man, young, beautiful features,

1413
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:05,260
especially when you're clean shaven.
Why it takes years.

1414
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:09,230
I've dated some beautiful
women and that's them.

1415
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:14,000
That's not what I'm saying.
What I'm saying goes, yeah,
I know what you're in ones,

1416
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,820
which we shouldn't even really talk about
you. I have a better story. There's a,

1417
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:20,080
there's a guy that I know that was
actually a rockstar and he was living with

1418
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:22,840
his check and he eventually got married
to her and she was way harder than him

1419
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,530
and everyone knew that it was just a
matter of time. She was just literally,

1420
01:15:26,531 --> 01:15:31,000
she just was waiting to
stick a needle in them yet,

1421
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:34,480
not yet.
Not yet

1422
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:39,330
married. See if I can do a year, I'm
at a year. If I could do two years,

1423
01:15:39,331 --> 01:15:42,000
I want to make more money.
Let's see if I can make three years.

1424
01:15:42,001 --> 01:15:43,110
She made it about three years.

1425
01:15:43,111 --> 01:15:47,170
That's not that fucking needle in there
and just talking socking money and blood

1426
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:49,020
out of them and just vanished and change.

1427
01:15:49,021 --> 01:15:52,030
It became a totally different person
and hired lawyers who attacked them.

1428
01:15:52,031 --> 01:15:56,970
No prenuptial of course. So
she just raping and pillaging
like a fucking monster.

1429
01:15:56,971 --> 01:15:58,050
Just tore through his life.

1430
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:00,870
Like all of a sudden she pulls off
her mask and she shows what happened.

1431
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,950
He robbed, he got robbed, she robbed
him, she fucked him. She sucked his dick.

1432
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:08,040
She did it all for like three or
four years and then she robbed him.

1433
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:11,850
She literally robbed him. She
made millions and millions
of dollars and he was,

1434
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:16,800
he's a really unattractive guy and he's
small and he's got like little hands and

1435
01:16:16,801 --> 01:16:20,970
he's not, he's nothing manly about it. And
this girl is like, she's like an Alpha,

1436
01:16:20,971 --> 01:16:23,640
she's the Alpha female, she's
got a hot body, you know,

1437
01:16:23,641 --> 01:16:27,480
she's like in shape and young and
the like and, and, and she came from,

1438
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:30,930
she will like other relationships where
she was dating pro athletes and a bunch.

1439
01:16:30,931 --> 01:16:35,400
So she had been like targeting people
like for a while and she just went after

1440
01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:38,730
this guy and robbed a man and that was a
clear example of fucking over your head

1441
01:16:38,731 --> 01:16:42,660
for this poor fuck. And he was just, he
was just bonkers over just bonkers man.

1442
01:16:42,661 --> 01:16:44,250
He took her everywhere on
the road with them. Yeah,

1443
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:47,590
I helped letter designed the
house. They built a house. I said,

1444
01:16:47,591 --> 01:16:50,750
you got your asshole looked right just
one time and you're fucking hope forever.

1445
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:55,020
Amen. If you're some little weasley dude
with terrible genetics and you know,

1446
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:55,621
just,
you know,

1447
01:16:55,621 --> 01:16:59,100
just happened to be like really good at
a certain area of music and you know,

1448
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:00,560
you start making,
you know,

1449
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:03,840
you know people like cheer when
they see you on stage and you know,

1450
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:06,570
this bitch just started racking
up dollar signs in their head.

1451
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:10,660
But the scary thing from all his friends
was how it changed. Like overnight,

1452
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:14,030
like when she decided to sync the needle
in, it was like, all right, game's over,

1453
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,850
game's over, game's over. It's all
different. Yeah. And I'll look,

1454
01:17:16,851 --> 01:17:18,980
I'm not attracted to you. I'm
not into, I don't love you.

1455
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:22,880
And this poor fuck tried to bring her
back. He tried, he didn't understand.

1456
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:25,820
He didn't get it. He is, something
must be wrong. What did I do wrong?

1457
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:30,020
We can make it work out.
I don't like you just got,

1458
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:33,530
she got crazy and angry. It's so
pathetic. I really, I thought, I mean,

1459
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:35,360
this is the most pathetic I've ever seen.

1460
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:38,060
You just attacking him and
abusing him and his poor fuck.

1461
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:39,950
Tried to keep her around,
you know, just like,

1462
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:42,980
I'm not going to make this marriage hard.
I'm not going to divorce her.

1463
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:46,370
I just want you to be happy. Could I
want to be happy to like just anger,

1464
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:50,570
just no love and just
sock the money from him.

1465
01:17:50,571 --> 01:17:55,400
Socked it. Yeah. I got the, I got
the, you know, if we break up,

1466
01:17:55,401 --> 01:18:00,350
you'll come walk crawling back
to me. Yeah. I said again again,

1467
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:03,570
and you will, won't you if
you will. I mean, if she be

1468
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:08,240
fucking Hook you, dude, I get
it. They fucking hook you.

1469
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,420
If it's three o'clock in the morning
and you're standing there like sort of

1470
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:14,690
halfway committed to masturbating while
you're watching television, you know,

1471
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,900
you're like playing with your
underwear while you're watching TV.

1472
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:20,160
Like should I beat off? You know that
that foggy thing for most moment,

1473
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,000
don't know this, but most men,
while we're watching TV alone,

1474
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:27,800
we're in a constant state
of semi masturbation where
your hand is always on your

1475
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:31,070
deck and you're always adjusting your
balls or you're rubbing your deck just to

1476
01:18:31,071 --> 01:18:32,630
see if Dick would get hard.

1477
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:35,180
Right now I'm watching a
documentary on killer whales.

1478
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,690
Let's see if my dick gets hard.
That would be crazy.

1479
01:18:37,691 --> 01:18:41,240
If my dictus guard hard right here
while I'm watching these killer whales.

1480
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,300
The thumb comes out of your mouth and
onto your, no, don't do that stuff,

1481
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,400
but if that was going on,
I mean like you start off,

1482
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:48,640
you're born with your thumb in
your mouth and then you grow older.

1483
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:51,530
It goes to your Dick. Okay. Anyway,

1484
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,410
if all this is going on and you're in
your underwear watching TV three o'clock

1485
01:18:54,411 --> 01:18:57,820
in the morning and you open up the
door and she was there, you would go,

1486
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:03,260
come on in. Of course, you know mouth. No,

1487
01:19:03,261 --> 01:19:06,350
I wouldn't say that, but if she
was, if she showed up in a fur coat,

1488
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:09,890
she opens a fur coat and she said,
shut your mouth.

1489
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:11,691
If you don't,

1490
01:19:11,691 --> 01:19:14,780
if you don't call me at three o'clock in
the morning and I'll come over and slap

1491
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:19,250
you that I'll put a camera on it so I
could have the most mediocre sex I've ever

1492
01:19:19,251 --> 01:19:22,460
had. All right, sure. That's
not true. No, it is true.

1493
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,730
You just got to get
better at making noises.

1494
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,260
What's that about?
What kind of,

1495
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:34,970
I guess you could say that
or I can go through the, you
know, no. Dot, dot dot, dot.

1496
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:36,620
Be Nice. But yeah, no, I'm
just saying what you're saying.

1497
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:38,820
I don't know what you're saying, but you
don't need to. I know what I'm saying.

1498
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,420
You don't want to do that.
Yeah. Well, you know what, man?

1499
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:46,340
A lot of people that moments of
weakness when I cover headsets. Yeah.

1500
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:47,600
Moments of weakness,
especially with my,

1501
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:50,210
even the ugly ones that are like
jewelry with like four kids did.

1502
01:19:50,211 --> 01:19:53,600
I liked when I was like 15
I was still like, all right,
let's do it. I'm very calm,

1503
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,750
very little confidence in myself and
my Dick is hard and make smart choices,

1504
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,960
especially if I was alone in my house
and halfway masturbating were so mad at

1505
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:06,630
the true trick our first and think
about it as legitimate advice. It works.

1506
01:20:06,631 --> 01:20:08,220
This is legit advice.
I used to be.

1507
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,550
We used to say that me and my friend
Jimmy to Telia when we lived together in

1508
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:15,780
Waltham, Massachusetts, we would go out
to avoid making fucking big mistakes.

1509
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,500
We used to like actively say
that and do it like, all right,

1510
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,360
remember you got to beat off first before
you leave the house or you're fucking,

1511
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:26,190
you'll chase after bad dreams and
I would fucking make sure I just,

1512
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:29,280
as a rule, you know, we'd live
together. We had a stack of Pornos,

1513
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,920
most of them that I
stole from my stepfather.

1514
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:34,680
I stop fucking cases of
fucking VHS tapes of porn.

1515
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:38,260
I stole some of them bitches when you
can kind of say shit. And he's a mine.

1516
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:43,680
Just turned 12 when I moved out or when
I came back home that I felt terrible.

1517
01:20:43,681 --> 01:20:47,970
Two's dad. Yeah, my Stepdad. That's
so great. Oh my God. My playboys.

1518
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,740
Always just make sure that you know,

1519
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,500
always gotta make sure you peed off
first before you leave the house.

1520
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:56,250
One time I walked in on him PTEN off in
the living room. So impaired or your dad?

1521
01:20:56,370 --> 01:21:00,850
No, no, no, no. My friend Jimmy.
Oh, not my stepdad. Did he jump out?

1522
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,640
No. No. He's laughing. He's laughing.
He just stopped. He stopped.

1523
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:08,810
He grabbed turn sideways.
I couldn't see his deck.

1524
01:21:08,811 --> 01:21:11,490
And he was naked in the living
room. Huh? Well, you fucking free.

1525
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:14,190
We lived a little bit [inaudible]
apartment. Yeah. It was a tiny apartment.

1526
01:21:14,191 --> 01:21:16,650
It was just the living room and
two bedrooms. He went there.

1527
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:19,770
And you had two bedrooms. Well,
you know the, the TV in his room.

1528
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,120
He didn't have a TV in
his room at the time.

1529
01:21:21,121 --> 01:21:23,940
It took me on a TV in the living room.
That's what it was. Was He watching porn?

1530
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,250
Do what you gotta do it?
Yeah, he's watching. Oh,
okay. So you had to be there.

1531
01:21:26,251 --> 01:21:28,170
I'm like, what? There's gotta
be a reason to do it there.

1532
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:29,790
I said every retired I went to a big,

1533
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:32,550
I think I went to a Gig and I was just
home earlier than he thought. Yeah.

1534
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:36,480
That was the salad days. Back in
the day was Waltham, Massachusetts.

1535
01:21:36,481 --> 01:21:39,960
Right in front of Burger King. You
have ever Ingram telling you about? Um,

1536
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,460
about when he walked in and his girlfriend
and fucking his best friend. Whoa.

1537
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,680
He got home early from Chili's one day.
Oh my God.

1538
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:50,640
Held him off early and he came home. I
was like, whoa. Wow. That's fucking crazy.

1539
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:53,880
That's nuts man. I'm glad
that never happened in the
ad. It would not know how to,

1540
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:57,780
that's such a different trail. It's one
thing if she's fucking some other dudes,

1541
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,090
he was letting me stay there.
Like, he was like, all right,

1542
01:22:00,091 --> 01:22:02,790
you can stay here while you're,
and then shoes are crazy, man.

1543
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:07,200
Some pitches just can't help themselves
when they're around a man to want to

1544
01:22:07,201 --> 01:22:10,170
fuck them and it'll get real close
and they don't mean to do it.

1545
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,500
But once their pussy gets wet and that
got touches it and then his dick is hard,

1546
01:22:13,501 --> 01:22:14,880
all of a sudden,
oops.

1547
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,260
It's in there.
It's in there.

1548
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:20,800
And the friends who's not thinking,
you can't think clearly, man.

1549
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:24,160
Hard dicks or monsters.
They are monsters hard.

1550
01:22:24,161 --> 01:22:28,430
Dick's have minds of their own
hard. What'd you think? Oh,
sorry. Heart. Dick's. Yeah,

1551
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:32,120
it was like, what the fuck
is that? That's my new baby.

1552
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:35,770
The most romantic emotional self
help books called Heart Dick. Well,

1553
01:22:35,771 --> 01:22:38,380
I'm trying to do is combine
men and woman together.

1554
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:40,870
I mean amount of basically
Dixon women at heart, you know,

1555
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:46,060
and together we're all happy. We need
heart Dick. It's like, uh, like goop.

1556
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:49,210
Like the Gwyneth Paltrow website.
I'll start a website called heart dick.

1557
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,950
It's probably already registered
and there's probably some,

1558
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:55,490
some dork out there in Australia right
now to slam my keyboards too late heart

1559
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,850
pig doc.
I can see the graphic.

1560
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:01,810
The top would be the head and then we'll
come down to Sioux balls and come under.

1561
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:04,270
Yeah, look like I like
it. Yeah. That's cool.

1562
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:05,980
Or any designer there
and make a heart deck

1563
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,160
and you can make the bottom of like
fades to pink and with a little hairs.

1564
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:14,080
Unless you're black, you can get
a black version two. We're hard.

1565
01:23:14,081 --> 01:23:18,520
Dick is a fucking big giant
chimpanzee. Black balls. This,

1566
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:22,780
we have the biggest balls ever.
Yeah. If I, if my balls were black,

1567
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:23,440
if I was a black car,

1568
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,710
I would want like chimps size balls to
have over micro do a really good joke

1569
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,370
about when and he said, uh,
you think I have small shoes?

1570
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:34,180
You think small shoes means Oh,
it was a fucking puppet comic.

1571
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:37,960
A black guy with an old white guy puppet.
That's who told the joke. But he goes,

1572
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:39,370
oh, I know what the girls are.
They could, you must have,

1573
01:23:39,371 --> 01:23:41,050
I must have a small dick
cause my small shoes.

1574
01:23:41,051 --> 01:23:43,810
Well you know who else had small shoes?
Horses.

1575
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:49,840
That is funny. That old man, Donny.

1576
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:52,870
That's very good because a horse
shoe is only like as big as yeah.

1577
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:57,610
And those decks aren't that passive.
That's, that's actually very funny man.

1578
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:01,300
Horses don't have such big balls.
I don't know. It tastes the same.

1579
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:06,630
Duly grills have a little tiny
ass balls. Really animated.

1580
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:10,510
No, it's true though. Actually going
over this in the podcast before,

1581
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:11,790
but I'll do it just for the point of this.

1582
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:14,770
This particular discussion for people
who don't want listen to every fucking

1583
01:24:14,771 --> 01:24:16,990
episode or observe the um,
the,

1584
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:21,940
the size of your balls is directly
related to how many female sluts there are

1585
01:24:21,941 --> 01:24:24,700
and your community.
Why am I ball so much bigger?

1586
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,980
This is why you grew up with a horse,

1587
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:32,530
or at least my ancestors
did horse for real.

1588
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:37,210
It's true when your body is producing
sperm, a huge amount of their sperm,

1589
01:24:37,211 --> 01:24:38,410
like a great percentage of it,

1590
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,390
our attack sperm that are there
only around to kill other sperm.

1591
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:45,190
So if a of a guy shoots
a load in some chicken,

1592
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:46,960
then you come in and
you get sloppy seconds,

1593
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:50,470
your lows will go and
kill his loads. Wow. Yeah.

1594
01:24:50,471 --> 01:24:54,700
That's why chimps have big balls because
chimp girls or are whores like there's

1595
01:24:54,701 --> 01:24:57,460
that bit that I used to do in
my act about a chimpanzees.

1596
01:24:57,490 --> 01:24:59,290
It's a true story about fucking,

1597
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:03,670
they did studies on Champs when they
taught them that if they gave them,

1598
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,400
they taught them the value of money and
they taught the chimps that they would

1599
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:09,320
give them coins and if they gave
the coins back, they give him food.

1600
01:25:09,321 --> 01:25:12,040
So they realize these coins represent
food and they would do things to earn the

1601
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:13,630
coins and then they
would get food from it.

1602
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:16,050
The first thing that champs
did was give the coins,

1603
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:19,450
the female champs and fuck them.
There was the first thing they did.

1604
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:22,810
They went right up to him and they were
like, look, I got this. This is for food.

1605
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:25,780
And the the female chimps would go,
they would get their food,

1606
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,910
they would eat their food and they would
just like stick their pussy out him in

1607
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:30,280
the mail chimp because they
wanted to fuck anyway. Well,

1608
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:33,430
they wanted to fuck anyway and they would
allow it like whenever the mail chimp

1609
01:25:33,431 --> 01:25:34,930
wanted it right away,

1610
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:38,110
there would have to be him chasing
her around the fucking cage all day.

1611
01:25:38,111 --> 01:25:40,120
And then finally she says, okay, fine.

1612
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:44,530
That's what most of it is
a human equivalent to the
sympathy handjob. Exactly.

1613
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:48,250
You know, it's just like in, in the
chimp world, the chimp pimps, you know,

1614
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,790
they can just kick back and relax and
then they're more attractive because

1615
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:54,310
they're, they're not constantly chasing
after it. The ones that are on needy,

1616
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:56,260
just like in real life,
if you're all needy,

1617
01:25:56,261 --> 01:25:59,170
chasing after grow over and over and over
again, I'll, she's like, all right, fine,

1618
01:25:59,171 --> 01:26:00,004
you could fuck me,

1619
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:03,470
but if you don't even hardly talk to her
and all the other girls are talking to

1620
01:26:03,471 --> 01:26:05,840
you. And then she's like,
why is he with them?

1621
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:09,550
I'm surprised at how often girls were when
you were like, I don't really want to,

1622
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:12,160
you know, a girlfriend. They're like,
well that's, that's what I want.

1623
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:15,140
And then how many of them like, all right,
that's fine. We'll do it on your terms.

1624
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:18,890
Yeah. But how many of them do it and
try to trick you? They're like, oh,

1625
01:26:18,891 --> 01:26:21,980
I want a boyfriend either.
Yeah. It was a few of those.

1626
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,890
They give you just
because you're interested.

1627
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:27,440
They're lying to themselves to the reason
why you can keep these non monogamous

1628
01:26:27,441 --> 01:26:29,750
relationships. It's just because
you're an exceptional person.

1629
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:32,540
Mr [inaudible] everyone,
she's not dating you.

1630
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:35,730
She's going to be dating some
boring motherfucker. Yeah,

1631
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:39,710
an accountant or something who works
all day and is exhausted at night and I

1632
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:44,750
always get gout getting fucking hyper
hypertension because he's fucking stressed

1633
01:26:45,171 --> 01:26:48,890
at work cause he needs to be talking to
his boss about some sort of a promotion

1634
01:26:48,891 --> 01:26:51,530
and he feels like there's a glass
ceiling and you know you're dealing with

1635
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:53,270
nonsense man.
At least your fun.

1636
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,880
You'd take a check to a comedy show
and she's like, look at this guy.

1637
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:58,070
He gets up on stage. It
makes people laugh. Yeah.

1638
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,600
So you're allowed to pull off this.

1639
01:26:59,601 --> 01:27:01,970
I don't want a girlfriend shit for a
little way I'm a Dick because if you wake

1640
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:04,130
me up before noon,
that's new. Let me sleep.

1641
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,920
It's like we'll have no problem.
I hate that.

1642
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:09,820
Why did they have to all wake up
early? Why go wake up? Just go do it.

1643
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:14,690
Do they really? Oh Man. It's all
see it. Not the girls. I did. Well,

1644
01:27:14,691 --> 01:27:17,730
people with regular jobs to wake up early
cause I used to it. That's true. Yeah.

1645
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:20,620
You gotta be careful with a girl has a
regular job or girls that are like hyper

1646
01:27:20,621 --> 01:27:25,100
ambitious. C'Mon, let's go hiking. A
hate died. I've never went skydiving.

1647
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:27,610
I want to try skydiving and
you're going to go with me, bitch.

1648
01:27:27,611 --> 01:27:31,930
I am not dying on a fucking farm rooftop.
I'm not gonna.

1649
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,960
That's not gonna be the last thing I see
as I go through the fucking roof of the

1650
01:27:34,961 --> 01:27:38,020
barn. They never go on
vacations. We never go hiking.

1651
01:27:38,021 --> 01:27:42,400
We never got to Santa Barbara. Santa
Barbara is amazing this time of year.

1652
01:27:42,401 --> 01:27:46,660
Come on, let's go. You weren't around.
I would never even think of doing that.

1653
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:48,780
Yeah.
I mean there's some fun shit you can do,

1654
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:51,090
you know as a couple that you
really can't do with your buddies.

1655
01:27:51,091 --> 01:27:53,820
Like I guess you could go wine tasting
or something. It might be a fun,

1656
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,540
cool. Go for a drive. Great to
black out and get drunk. It's well,

1657
01:27:57,541 --> 01:28:00,940
it's cool to just do different
things, man. And he hurting.
You're hurting inside.

1658
01:28:00,941 --> 01:28:03,100
You know, I went to Santa Barbara
and that's what happening with,

1659
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,600
there was like five wineries on a row
and he just like walked from each one.

1660
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:10,920
It's so expensive. Getting
a hotel in Santa Barbara, we
can only afford one night,

1661
01:28:10,921 --> 01:28:13,670
which was like $350 a lot of wineries too.
Oh yeah.

1662
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:17,760
It starts there and it
was like $350 a night.

1663
01:28:17,761 --> 01:28:20,580
So we've got this really nice or actually
it was a pretty shitty, you know, room.

1664
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,160
Me and Katie and uh,

1665
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:25,760
we went to like five wineries and then
that's when you walk to them? Yeah.

1666
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:28,560
You just walk a little winery. What, what
they were, they were fronts where like,

1667
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:32,910
you know, like store presence, but you
do wine tastings there and it was like,

1668
01:28:32,911 --> 01:28:36,240
you know, down the street or whatever.
But basically drive just to drink wine.

1669
01:28:36,241 --> 01:28:38,130
Exactly.
But not even seeing the grapes.

1670
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,920
Like I thought that was part of the charm.

1671
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,790
You pull over on the side here, next
five miles, it'll be this place.

1672
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:47,100
Go to the grocery store,
graft and grief and look at them.

1673
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:51,240
And named go get to the wine,
go to

1674
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:54,400
Maynard's grape vineyards.
How cool is that?

1675
01:28:54,401 --> 01:28:58,780
Maynard from tool [inaudible] vineyards.
Yeah. He's a fascinating guy. My buddy,

1676
01:28:58,781 --> 01:29:01,380
Dustin is a sound guy.
You know,

1677
01:29:01,381 --> 01:29:05,370
he does a travels and bands and shit
and you know Dustin and Dustin said that

1678
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:07,950
he's a super cool guy. He just
wants to train Jujitsu all the time.

1679
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:10,640
He's apparently really good at
Jujitsu. Yeah. Maynard's uh,

1680
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:13,860
of phenomenal Jujitsu guys like uh,

1681
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:17,310
Hixon Gracie student and like he brings
Dustin with them on the road cause

1682
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:19,290
Dustin can do Jujitsu with them as well,

1683
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:22,150
so and so they'll set up the sound
and they have mats set up. All right,

1684
01:29:22,151 --> 01:29:24,780
let's train. And then what he wants to
train for an hour and a half and shit.

1685
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:27,180
Loves to roll.
Go over techniques like really loves it.

1686
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:30,040
Well that last night in the wiener
though, it was, are, you know what I mean?

1687
01:29:30,041 --> 01:29:34,660
When we were there that that night after
we went to five wineries puking all

1688
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:37,000
night,
like laying on floor,

1689
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:40,040
can't try to drag her into
bed and she wouldn't go.

1690
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,160
So she slept in the toilet.

1691
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:47,240
Wine is so awesome when it's good. You
know, I never traveled like when I'm,

1692
01:29:47,241 --> 01:29:50,250
I'm never traveling happier at like
when I'm going through the wine menu,

1693
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:52,950
they'll want, when I'm with
Lichtenberg Lichtenberger you can,

1694
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:56,390
you give that guy the wine menu. You
don't even ask, you know, and say like,

1695
01:29:56,940 --> 01:30:00,840
we get this, he just go, dude,
you pick something cool. He
knows exactly what to do.

1696
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:04,050
He'll bring his own wine cozy.
Remember that wine crazy thing.

1697
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:06,600
He has not fucking around.
I go over his house, Bro.

1698
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:11,460
He's got this giant in wine cellar.
It's all temperature controlled.

1699
01:30:11,461 --> 01:30:14,880
He's got all these bottles on the walls
and he's got them all like segregated.

1700
01:30:14,881 --> 01:30:18,850
These are from France. So these are
California Cath, his hobby. Oh yeah, he's,

1701
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:21,360
well he's a master.
I mean he really knows his shit.

1702
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:24,330
I went to his birthday and
it was a wine tasting party.

1703
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:27,390
I tried writing a bit about it and
I started telling him on stage,

1704
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:31,290
but no one could relate. It was like so
off the charts weird. So I'm there. Right.

1705
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:33,660
And you know, I, I enjoy
wine. It's really good.

1706
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:36,630
But everyone else at the
party is a wine connoisseur.

1707
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,640
And so we have this tasting menu with,

1708
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:40,620
they're bringing over these
little tiny plates of food,

1709
01:30:40,621 --> 01:30:43,570
like different hors d'oeuvres and stuff.
And then they'll bring over a,

1710
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:45,540
a selection of wines to go with it.

1711
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:48,120
Often two or three different
wines to go with it.

1712
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:52,560
And everyone will go over the selection
and then they'll all talk about it.

1713
01:30:52,561 --> 01:30:54,450
So I had a recorder
with me and a recording.

1714
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:58,860
I wish I could find it because it was
so ridiculous. It's like this one has a,

1715
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:03,260
a woody finish this. Yeah. It's
like, okay. And the tannins and,

1716
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,850
and then this one is corked. And what
someone would say, I think this one,

1717
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:08,970
it's cork and everyone else had joined.
And I'd be like, this is my favorite one.

1718
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,540
The one that you're saying is bad. It's
like my favorite one. Like how do we,

1719
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:15,280
I don't, I don't understand.
Oh, I was all loose.

1720
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:18,780
I mean they have an educated
palate and I'm like,

1721
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:21,810
why would you want your sense
of taste to be that educated?

1722
01:31:21,811 --> 01:31:24,540
Why would you want to be so
goddamn specific about wine?

1723
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:26,420
Well, well, what it is kind
of cool about that is there,

1724
01:31:26,421 --> 01:31:28,880
there's one I went to where
the winery is next to,

1725
01:31:28,881 --> 01:31:31,490
or like a rose garden or something.
And so they were like,

1726
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,370
you can taste the roses in it
because it's in the dirt. Oh,

1727
01:31:35,371 --> 01:31:39,560
from Tony left a joint next to

1728
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:45,140
Tony. Tony Harris fluff had
joint next to a box in a bag,

1729
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,650
in a sealed bag next to a box of um,
uh,

1730
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:52,670
those dryer sheets and the
joint tastes like, yeah,

1731
01:31:52,690 --> 01:31:55,670
it tastes like dryer sheets. Oh
my God. Do you exhale only? Yeah.

1732
01:31:55,671 --> 01:31:59,770
So this is why is he threw a
sheet zip lock bag. That's crazy.

1733
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:00,873
That just wine though.

1734
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:04,660
A free said taste the roses and like you
drink it and you just have this slight

1735
01:32:04,661 --> 01:32:07,960
tit. It's kind of cool being right next
to where the air would get into it. Wow.

1736
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:12,490
That's Kinda freaking, yeah.
Wow. It's two Buck Chuck Berry.

1737
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:17,380
You ever drink two buck chuck?
Delicious. What is that?

1738
01:32:17,381 --> 01:32:21,670
Is it particles from the fucking
rose? The sort of what? What is it?

1739
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:24,070
It's private just from over
the years, you know, I've just,

1740
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:27,760
I don't do they really know. Is that
like there's, these are science guesses,

1741
01:32:27,761 --> 01:32:30,670
right? This is wineries
talking about their product.

1742
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:34,480
It's the same thing as a joint.
The touching thing too,

1743
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:37,800
I don't know what is it fair? But
what, what happens in the air?

1744
01:32:37,801 --> 01:32:40,930
It's like what's traveling
over there? Smells, smell.

1745
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:43,300
That was a little tiny
particles gets in at,

1746
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,330
that's why my friends say when you smell
a Fart, it's little pieces of shit.

1747
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:48,310
It is. No, no. That's
why it's so offensive.

1748
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,910
Well that's one of the reasons why
grilling over wood is so delicious.

1749
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,720
It gets it in the flavor.
Gets it.

1750
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:57,670
That I have is I know how to
cook a steak over mesquite.

1751
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:01,090
I always get mesquite hardwood.
Like if you go to like a whole foods,

1752
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:04,060
they don't sell bearcats
bearcats are all like, you know,

1753
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:06,580
if he bought like Kingsford all and
that Shit, a lot of them, they're,

1754
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:09,670
they're jammed full of lighter
fluid. You know, the way that the re,

1755
01:33:09,810 --> 01:33:13,420
the best way to cook is you don't use,
you don't use any lighter fluid.

1756
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:17,240
You just use paper and one of those
cones, you know, they have those like,

1757
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:20,330
they're like a volcano. It looks
like a chimney. That's it all up.

1758
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:22,870
So you pour all the coals in the chimney.

1759
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,360
At the bottom there's an
area where you stuff paper.

1760
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:28,360
So you light the paper on fire and
the paper, the, the flames go up.

1761
01:33:28,361 --> 01:33:32,170
He catches the mesquite wood, you
lay it down and then, you know,

1762
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:36,000
once it gets to a certain temperature,
when it's like really red, hot and steamy,

1763
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:39,100
then you sear it on each side for two
and a half minutes and you finish it on

1764
01:33:39,101 --> 01:33:43,600
the top and it just smells like the wood
and the fucking meat is so delicious.

1765
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:46,190
You're used one of those
chimney sweep logs. Uh,

1766
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:48,340
you know where you put it in and
cleans your chimney out. Those,

1767
01:33:48,341 --> 01:33:51,160
I guess it's a chimney out the
fuck are you talking about?

1768
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:53,830
There's a log that clean.
Yeah. You never know that. Oh,

1769
01:33:53,831 --> 01:33:58,120
that guy that can't be good
can, can imagine that just
killing it. Killing birds.

1770
01:33:58,121 --> 01:33:59,740
That's where all those birds
are falling from. The fucking,

1771
01:33:59,741 --> 01:34:02,380
somebody did one of those.
Right. How about this matter?

1772
01:34:02,381 --> 01:34:03,250
I was just thinking about this,

1773
01:34:03,251 --> 01:34:05,230
speaking of birds a fall from
the sky because this, this,

1774
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:08,590
this really is kind of
bizarre. You know, you know,

1775
01:34:08,591 --> 01:34:11,350
when people think about the apocalypse,
you know, people think about, you know,

1776
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,480
the end of days and shit like that.
Stuff like that happen.

1777
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:16,640
This is the kind of shit they talk
about, right? Biblical. Yeah. Yeah.

1778
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:20,920
Like dying fish and dying birds and all
these things happening and every dog's

1779
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:23,050
following what is going on with the birds.
They don't,

1780
01:34:23,051 --> 01:34:26,020
while they're still good autopsies, but
they're saying all kinds of crazy shit.

1781
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:27,060
Like some of them say that the,

1782
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:31,270
the birds like got scared by sound
and slammed into, into a houses.

1783
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:36,640
Yes. Yesterday. Where's
Chicago? They're lying for sure.
But here's the thing. They,

1784
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:39,250
they're guessing and they're trying to
come up with some sort of an answer cause

1785
01:34:39,251 --> 01:34:41,290
I don't think they're really know.
You know, they're saying that these,

1786
01:34:41,291 --> 01:34:44,830
these birds have a, uh, have their
showing trauma on their body, of course,

1787
01:34:44,831 --> 01:34:48,550
are shown the trauma. They fell
from the fucking sky. Retard,

1788
01:34:48,551 --> 01:34:51,790
like the idea that they ran into houses
and that's how they died at stupid

1789
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:55,060
because there's not broken houses. I
mean weren't all around. Yeah, exactly.

1790
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:55,571
And there's,

1791
01:34:55,571 --> 01:34:59,000
there's no way they would all be like
near the house if they're all slamming in

1792
01:34:59,001 --> 01:34:59,391
the houses,

1793
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:03,770
they would all be right there up inhale
eventually melted when it came down

1794
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:05,390
lower stacker hilltop.
It could be it,

1795
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:08,540
that definitely can be or it could be
some poisoned shit. Yeah. You know,

1796
01:35:08,541 --> 01:35:11,450
we talked about that John Wheeler Guy,
that guy that was assassinated,

1797
01:35:11,451 --> 01:35:14,540
he was a chemical weapons expert and uh,
you know,

1798
01:35:14,541 --> 01:35:19,310
he was a chemical weapons expert under
George Bush's father and he was involved

1799
01:35:19,311 --> 01:35:21,010
somehow in other with the
current administration,

1800
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:23,570
they found this guy tortured
and murdered in a landfill.

1801
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:26,690
And this was like right along the time
that all this shit was going down,

1802
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:27,231
you know,

1803
01:35:27,231 --> 01:35:30,740
with these birds falling from the sky and
these hundred thousand fish turning up

1804
01:35:30,741 --> 01:35:33,770
dead, you know, and massive fish
kills. Sometimes that should happen.

1805
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:35,030
Sometimes you know,

1806
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:38,920
sometimes things go wrong or pollutants
getting the water or you know what?

1807
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:42,040
If it's just government testing,
it could be more,

1808
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:45,230
it could be them testing chemicals.
Receiver theorist won. Yeah,

1809
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:49,310
well you know fucking the problem with
conspiracy theories is some of this shit

1810
01:35:49,311 --> 01:35:50,270
is really going on.

1811
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:53,960
The primary conspiracy theories is
people want to come up with a theory for

1812
01:35:53,961 --> 01:35:54,351
everything.

1813
01:35:54,351 --> 01:35:59,351
A lot of their ideas are
completely ridiculous and
it they're hoping that these

1814
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:03,980
theories are right and I want the most
sexy and ridiculous option to be real.

1815
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:09,170
Has there been any video of or witnesses
showing of the birds falling like,

1816
01:36:09,171 --> 01:36:12,100
hey, why are all these birds? I do
not think so. I don't think anybody,

1817
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:18,090
just some kind of graffiti prank that p
kids or never even having them on over

1818
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:21,320
miles there you don't understand. These
are like thousands of birds over miles,

1819
01:36:21,321 --> 01:36:24,140
that very same species over and
over again. Something happened.

1820
01:36:24,141 --> 01:36:27,590
He's birds in the air and it was either
they were poisoned or they're hit by

1821
01:36:27,591 --> 01:36:30,230
hail. Hail is possibility.
Some people saw fireworks,

1822
01:36:30,231 --> 01:36:32,030
scared them and they slammed into things.

1823
01:36:32,031 --> 01:36:34,820
But that doesn't make any dead
birds is the next crop circle.

1824
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,863
We just don't know yet.

1825
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:38,750
But what I was saying is look at all
the different shit that's going down.

1826
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:40,430
All these birds done,
all these fish dying,

1827
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:44,710
all the water leaking of the oil leaking
into the ocean, all the, uh, the, the,

1828
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:48,080
the floods that are going on right now
in, in Australia. I mean, they're like,

1829
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:51,830
it's like the size of Europe is underwater
in Australia. I mean, it's incredible.

1830
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:55,490
And now the latest thing is the scientists
are saying that there's a possibility

1831
01:36:55,491 --> 01:36:59,660
of some gigantic superstorm that could
hit Los Angeles or get to hit California.

1832
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:03,550
And that literally 25% of all the
houses are going to be flooded in room.

1833
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:05,870
They don't know.
They're trying to figure it out,

1834
01:37:05,871 --> 01:37:08,690
but they're saying because of
all the hot weather that, well,

1835
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:11,870
this is what it says con cal guess is
that it will never happen. Yeah. Yeah.

1836
01:37:11,871 --> 01:37:15,830
That's a good guess. But apparently it's
happened. US Geological Survey. Uh, they,

1837
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:20,660
they've, they've, they've studied that
the dates to 12, four, four 46, you know,

1838
01:37:20,661 --> 01:37:25,520
when they'd done like core samples
and the earth, uh, 1029, 14, 18, 16,

1839
01:37:25,521 --> 01:37:28,550
oh five was the last time it happened.
So it happens every few hundred years.

1840
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:31,040
They have these, you know, you
know, it could be 800 years.

1841
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:34,460
They have these gigantic superstorms
and what they're talking about,

1842
01:37:34,461 --> 01:37:36,920
the superstorms raining for 40 days,

1843
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:41,300
dumping 10 feet of water and this is all
possible and they're saying the storm

1844
01:37:41,301 --> 01:37:45,800
would be goaded on by an atmospheric
river that would move water at the same

1845
01:37:45,801 --> 01:37:50,090
time rate as 50 Mississippi's discharging
water into the Gulf of Mexico,

1846
01:37:50,091 --> 01:37:51,790
into the clouds coming through us.

1847
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,150
It just would be just a massive
amount of water pouring notion.

1848
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:56,850
Let it go inland.

1849
01:37:57,310 --> 01:38:00,540
Shit that we couldn't even wrap our head
around there saying that literally it

1850
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,070
would be like,
you know,

1851
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:05,430
it would be like the same
category as a gigantic earthquake.

1852
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,460
I want a boat on a boat.

1853
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:11,090
I don't think a boat we'll help you
do if you're way up here. But Dude,

1854
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:13,150
a boat is going to,
the water's gonna come over the top,

1855
01:38:13,151 --> 01:38:15,030
but smash on top of you
and crush your head.

1856
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:19,120
I don't think a boat's going to help pour
down. I Dunno. I mean, I'm [inaudible].

1857
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,210
We talked to me.

1858
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:24,540
Obviously this never happened in
recorded human history that we know of.

1859
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:28,200
You know, that we don't have any
representations of what it was like,

1860
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:29,890
but I think that it's, I mean, if they're,

1861
01:38:29,891 --> 01:38:33,840
they're really telling you that it's going
to come in 40 days in dump 10 feet of

1862
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:35,430
water and that's insane.

1863
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:40,500
The rate of 50 Mississippi rivers
discharging water into the Gulf of Mexico,

1864
01:38:40,501 --> 01:38:42,390
pouring down on the state.
That's incredible.

1865
01:38:42,391 --> 01:38:45,480
They're talking about 125 mile
an hour winds, landslides.

1866
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:48,450
Think about all those guns. Goofy
houses are all gone about, happens.

1867
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:51,570
All those Laurel Canyon houses that
are on still early days of rain. Yeah,

1868
01:38:51,571 --> 01:38:55,620
that's a wrap. Bitches. Like
a few years ago, a bunch of
them, too much rain. Right?

1869
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:59,430
And then like six houses fell down.
Remember Malibu Laurel too.

1870
01:38:59,910 --> 01:39:03,870
Mad mealtime, multibillion dollar
houses at mill million. Excuse me.

1871
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:08,610
It looks seven, $8 million
houses in Malibu. Just sinking
big chunks of the hill.

1872
01:39:08,611 --> 01:39:12,930
Broke off away from their pipes were
sticking out, electricity sparks and shit.

1873
01:39:12,931 --> 01:39:13,320
And then,

1874
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:17,180
I mean they had all this video of these
things sliding down the hills like you

1875
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,370
do your, you can't make a house on
the side of a fucking hill like that.

1876
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:23,610
That ain't cool. I know you want a
nice view, but you're being ridiculous.

1877
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:27,150
Like you just totally rolling
the dice with Mother Nature.

1878
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:31,670
How fucking awesome is this?
Whether it was 84 here in short,

1879
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,920
five fucking love.
Twitter's from people in Calgary.

1880
01:39:34,921 --> 01:39:38,400
Yesterday was 30 below with the windchill
factor use or just got back from

1881
01:39:38,401 --> 01:39:42,900
Chicago, said hadn't see daylight in four
days. Yeah, it was snowing and overcast.

1882
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:46,040
Yeah, it gets gray and then you've got
to take your jacket off here. Yeah.

1883
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:49,930
See seasonal affective disorder.
That's a real shit. You know, you're,

1884
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:52,730
you're not happy when it's
gray all the time. That's care.

1885
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:56,730
What you say about California still shit.
This weather is good the most.

1886
01:39:56,731 --> 01:39:59,550
The best thing about California is the
sun and that's why they have those lights

1887
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:01,980
that you didn't even have this nightstand
lights where it just gives you a

1888
01:40:01,981 --> 01:40:06,540
simulation of the sun will do. That's
why. That's why Colorado so fucking dope.

1889
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:09,600
Colorado has sun 250 to 300 days a year,

1890
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:13,990
like they have very few overcast days,
so even though it's cold, it's sunny.

1891
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:16,550
That's what we need,
man. It's not the cold.

1892
01:40:16,551 --> 01:40:20,550
It's so bad because when it's cold out
yet sucks to drive. But you know what man,

1893
01:40:20,551 --> 01:40:24,410
you put some fucking clothes on.
You put a warm coat on gloves.

1894
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:28,020
When it's sunny out and it's cold,
it's like, whoa, it's cold out here.

1895
01:40:28,021 --> 01:40:29,010
But you're still smiling.

1896
01:40:29,011 --> 01:40:32,400
You can go out with your friends and go
snowboarding and shit and go fuck around.

1897
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:36,360
When it's Boston, Boston winters
brow, they would just be like, God,

1898
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:37,081
when is it going to end?

1899
01:40:37,081 --> 01:40:41,220
It's like you were being pissed on so
you've been held down and pissed on it.

1900
01:40:41,221 --> 01:40:43,260
You just have to deal with it.
Okay. When are you gonna let me up.

1901
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:46,200
Still sucks dealing with snow in
general though. I hate fucking snow.

1902
01:40:46,201 --> 01:40:51,060
I want to punch it smells bad. Ice
is worse. Icy Rain is the worst.

1903
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:53,560
The worst is when it's like 31 degrees.

1904
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:57,350
That's scary shit cause it rains and it
turns to ice the next morning and the

1905
01:40:57,351 --> 01:41:01,720
rains on top three in the morning.
It's so bad. When I was in high school,

1906
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:02,860
me and my buddy,
uh,

1907
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:06,490
my sister's boyfriend sat on top of
the garage and just watch these cars

1908
01:41:06,491 --> 01:41:07,031
slamming,

1909
01:41:07,031 --> 01:41:09,880
knew each other because our whole street
was covered in ice and we lived on a

1910
01:41:09,881 --> 01:41:13,510
hill. So we just sat, we drank beer and
we sat on the roof and it was a show.

1911
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:17,620
We were just watching guys slide down
and the cop cars to cop car came down

1912
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:21,000
slight. We told him he called
the cops. Yeah, yeah, we'll
be right there. You know,

1913
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:24,430
they came, they came. Dummies didn't
listen. Came Downhill. I tell him,

1914
01:41:24,431 --> 01:41:27,090
you better go uphill because if you do,
if you go downhill,

1915
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:28,990
you're not gonna be able
to stop. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1916
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:33,340
Fucking don't tell me what to do.
Fucking queer attacking each other,

1917
01:41:33,341 --> 01:41:36,050
but no one's ever learning and changing
their behavior. Well, it's still dull.

1918
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:38,410
They're not introspective at all.
Talk Shit on Boston,

1919
01:41:38,411 --> 01:41:40,270
but still one of the
best places to have fun.

1920
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:44,410
It's one of the best places to do shows.
It's a fucking, it's a great town.

1921
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:46,540
I just don't want to live there anymore.
I can't deal with the winters,

1922
01:41:46,541 --> 01:41:49,000
but the people are fucking phenomenal.
They're fun.

1923
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:51,130
There's like a certain
energy that they have.

1924
01:41:51,131 --> 01:41:54,260
There's a certain like they're like a zest
for life. You know when you, when you,

1925
01:41:54,261 --> 01:41:57,670
you have to fucking walk home in the cold
and you have to deal with that kind of

1926
01:41:57,671 --> 01:41:59,940
shit. You deal with those kinds
of, that kind of weather, if any,

1927
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:03,310
having donors go there. Yeah. It's
not the best way to describe it.

1928
01:42:03,311 --> 01:42:05,800
I imagine it as like the
downstairs in titanic,

1929
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,120
people dancing and having a great
old time, like a poverty thing.

1930
01:42:10,121 --> 01:42:11,530
There's a lot of rich people in Boston.

1931
01:42:11,531 --> 01:42:14,410
It's just that there's a certain amount
of no nonsense in a place where it gets

1932
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:19,270
zero degrees for a month.
You know? It's that wicked,

1933
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:22,570
but it's different than like Montreal.
It's like, why is no one from Vermont,

1934
01:42:22,650 --> 01:42:27,190
so like assholes? Who you, well,
Vermont is like Super Hippie, liberal,

1935
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:31,100
grateful dead California to
Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

1936
01:42:31,890 --> 01:42:35,410
It's a beautiful state to man. God,
I, I used to do gigs in Vermont.

1937
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:39,280
I would drive up to Burlington and just
be driving and I would just be trying to

1938
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:40,720
think of how I can live here.

1939
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:44,120
I'd be like 21 years old and
I would be in my car going,

1940
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:46,060
is there a way that I could
figure out how to live here?

1941
01:42:46,061 --> 01:42:47,500
Because this is how I want to live,
man.

1942
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:51,970
I want to live where there's like a river
by my house and it's like green grass

1943
01:42:51,971 --> 01:42:55,150
and there's woods and it's
like it's healthy. When I,

1944
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:58,570
when I drive around La as like, all right,
this is where I have to live, right?

1945
01:42:58,720 --> 01:42:59,501
I'm in my car,

1946
01:42:59,501 --> 01:43:04,150
I'm on this fucking monstrous freeway
that's six lanes on each side and every

1947
01:43:04,151 --> 01:43:08,290
one of those jams solid. No one can
move. I don't want to live like that.

1948
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:11,420
You want to take a dirt road and pass
somebody on the left? I want to beat,

1949
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:12,580
I want peace.

1950
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:16,940
I just went to bathrooms are tired of how
my parents tried to send it to Vermont.

1951
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:21,940
A camp, learning retards for learning
disabilities. What was wrong with you?

1952
01:43:22,110 --> 01:43:26,010
Learning disability? What kind of learning
disabilities? Uh, underachieving, uh,

1953
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,810
son of a middle class family,
but it's not read a really up,

1954
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,560
you don't have a learning disability. You
were probably just bored, Huh? Um, yeah,

1955
01:43:32,561 --> 01:43:33,041
they say that.

1956
01:43:33,041 --> 01:43:35,260
But that's why I think we've learned
that there was a psychological block,

1957
01:43:35,261 --> 01:43:37,690
probably something like that where it
wouldn't let you get into what you're

1958
01:43:37,691 --> 01:43:38,021
doing.

1959
01:43:38,021 --> 01:43:41,440
It's so hard when you have a troubled
childhood to be good at school because you

1960
01:43:41,441 --> 01:43:44,140
know, I had a troubled childhood and you
just don't want to concentrate on what

1961
01:43:44,141 --> 01:43:44,891
they're teaching you.
You're,

1962
01:43:44,891 --> 01:43:47,830
you're just trying to figure out the
whole world around you and how to,

1963
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,560
how to navigate through it.
Cool people and yeah,

1964
01:43:50,561 --> 01:43:53,690
just trying figure out how to not get
picked on and how to fucking get home

1965
01:43:53,691 --> 01:43:56,230
without, you know, having no
fear for your life. Like, which,

1966
01:43:56,250 --> 01:44:00,380
what your kids do I have to avoid, where
do I have to go and all that shit. It's,

1967
01:44:00,381 --> 01:44:03,170
they're very difficult to concentrate
on us history. Like how was this?

1968
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:06,710
The shit ain't affecting me. You
know? I just like watching TV.

1969
01:44:06,730 --> 01:44:09,230
I was kind of lucky because I hung out
with the Asian kid and I went thought he

1970
01:44:09,231 --> 01:44:14,050
knew karate. So really trying
to fuck his sister, his sister,

1971
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:16,810
just the Asian girl. It was an Asian
girl that wasn't related. Yeah,

1972
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:19,460
they weren't two different families and
different families. They try to hook up.

1973
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:20,091
No,

1974
01:44:20,091 --> 01:44:23,120
I think they hated each other cause I
think one was Japanese and moment or with

1975
01:44:23,121 --> 01:44:26,210
Korean, Koreans and
Japanese. The Japanese,

1976
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:29,000
because of all the robots do the
rape and Nam King. There's a,

1977
01:44:29,001 --> 01:44:31,880
there's a crazy documentary that
I watched is very disturbing.

1978
01:44:31,881 --> 01:44:33,920
Some of the sheets the
Japanese did to the Chinese,

1979
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:39,880
like genocidal gave in Cardinia
potholes in babies and fucked them.

1980
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:43,430
Ah, yeah, like really dark, dark,

1981
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:46,580
dark shit or just they just didn't
respect them as as people. No,

1982
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:50,720
they killed systematically tortured them
and did all kinds of crazy shit man.

1983
01:44:50,721 --> 01:44:54,180
It's a, it's a really, really disturbing
documentary. It was a documented this.

1984
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,420
I have it. If you want to watch
it we can watch it. It's not, um,

1985
01:44:56,421 --> 01:44:58,880
it wasn't released like I
had to buy it from some,

1986
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:03,270
some a library somewhere actually had
like rented and then not bring it back to

1987
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:06,170
you. One of those things. Yeah, just
pay the fine so that you can get it.

1988
01:45:06,171 --> 01:45:09,200
I couldn't get it anywhere else and
it's a really creepy and there's,

1989
01:45:09,201 --> 01:45:11,360
there's a bunch of shit on it online.
If you could read about it.

1990
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:12,194
I don't know the,

1991
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:16,130
it's like this is all like my friend
Rupert who was a director of your factor.

1992
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:17,570
He,
he turned me onto this many,

1993
01:45:17,571 --> 01:45:20,900
many years ago and I got into it back
then and it was so disturbing that I

1994
01:45:20,901 --> 01:45:24,950
forgot a lot of the particulars, so I'm
not going to, you know, I can't quote it,

1995
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:25,401
but if you,

1996
01:45:25,401 --> 01:45:29,210
if you're into genocide and into reading
up about how fucking cruel people can

1997
01:45:29,211 --> 01:45:33,010
pay, it's the genocide dude. I mean, a lot
of people are into finding out how deep,

1998
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:37,970
how
long walks in the park.

1999
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:39,410
They were talking about
this a few weeks ago at,

2000
01:45:39,411 --> 01:45:42,800
somebody found it in his
own lawn and is a yard sale.

2001
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:47,660
They found a human skin lamp from the
Holocaust and he sold it for 30 bucks is

2002
01:45:47,661 --> 01:45:49,250
right, bought it, and then
took it to his friend,

2003
01:45:49,290 --> 01:45:52,850
get thousand dollars got tested there
like it is humans can dish. It was so old,

2004
01:45:52,851 --> 01:45:56,240
they couldn't tell what race it had come
from. Wow. That's true. The Holocaust.

2005
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:57,373
Holy Shit.

2006
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:02,420
Like this had been someone's skin
and now it's adorning a lamp.

2007
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:06,410
Uh, it's crazy. The judge,
that was not that long ago. No,

2008
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:10,070
there are people still alive. Yeah. A
lot of them. Lot of people, you know,

2009
01:46:10,071 --> 01:46:12,230
there was, I watched the documentary
on the moon landing, Swanson,

2010
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:16,400
there was this guy who was a, uh, a
consequent cost Treatian camp survivor,

2011
01:46:16,401 --> 01:46:20,150
and he had his tattoos and he was talking
about Wernher von Braun that Wernher

2012
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:23,270
von Braun ran a rocket factory in
Brazil, or excuse me, in Berlin.

2013
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:25,910
What a lot of people don't realize
that the guy was the head of NASA,

2014
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:30,620
Wernher von Braun was a serious Nazi
because that guy was alive today.

2015
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:33,890
He would be the Simon Wiesenthal Center
said they would prosecute him for crimes

2016
01:46:33,891 --> 01:46:34,724
against humanity.

2017
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:38,950
He used to hang the five slowest Jews in
front of his factory in Berlin. Anytime,

2018
01:46:38,951 --> 01:46:42,530
you know, people are slow, hang them,
hang them in front of everybody else.

2019
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,500
So everybody would walk through and see
what the fuck was going on. Look, look,

2020
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:46,700
these are these guys
you used to work with.

2021
01:46:46,701 --> 01:46:50,880
Now they're hanging in front of the
fucking door, slow go to work. I mean,

2022
01:46:50,881 --> 01:46:52,500
it's dark, dark, dark shit.

2023
01:46:52,501 --> 01:46:56,370
And this guy with his tattoo from the
Holocaust was talking about how he

2024
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:59,430
remembers very clearly
seeing Wernher von Braun.

2025
01:46:59,431 --> 01:47:02,130
They would come in with suits and they
know I'll be working and they would come

2026
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:05,910
in and inspect the work and walk around
people and he'd fucking hang people

2027
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,010
hanging right in front of
people. You know? And this was a,

2028
01:47:08,011 --> 01:47:11,280
there's a thing called
operation paperclip. They
were all brought over here.

2029
01:47:11,281 --> 01:47:13,860
All the Nazi scientists.
Yeah, that's what it's called.

2030
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:17,670
They were all brought over here to run
NASA in the United States had like dog

2031
01:47:17,671 --> 01:47:20,580
shit for a rocket program before
Wernher von Braun came over.

2032
01:47:20,850 --> 01:47:21,870
He was a super genius.

2033
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:25,200
I feel like it's easy to like dehumanize
that moment when you say like, oh,

2034
01:47:25,201 --> 01:47:27,750
he used to hang people. But if you imagine
it from the person's point of view,

2035
01:47:27,751 --> 01:47:31,350
like you're just taking a ranch or
something and someone grabs you and you're

2036
01:47:31,351 --> 01:47:33,420
just screaming to like,
please don't, don't.

2037
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:35,010
And they didn't put it around your neck.
All right.

2038
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:38,100
And how many people do we know that are
just lazy as fuck and would slack off

2039
01:47:38,101 --> 01:47:41,730
and not, not made workers.
Yeah, me too. You know?

2040
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:43,500
I mean until someone died and
then I was like, all right,

2041
01:47:43,501 --> 01:47:44,760
I'm going to need to get through this.
You know,

2042
01:47:44,761 --> 01:47:47,790
and then you know the of children and
your children are being held captive to

2043
01:47:47,791 --> 01:47:50,340
your whole family is being held
captive. I mean, it's really,

2044
01:47:50,341 --> 01:47:54,090
really scary to think that that was not
that long ago and that while this is

2045
01:47:54,091 --> 01:47:57,660
going on, it was so much more
important for us to win the space race.

2046
01:47:57,780 --> 01:48:00,930
They were like, yeah, Wernher von
Braun, Mr Nancy, come on over here.

2047
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,870
Get on over here buddy.
Don't worry about all that other shit.

2048
01:48:03,871 --> 01:48:07,980
You get over the and whatever,
whatever, whatever, up race or race.

2049
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:09,420
No one's going to know.

2050
01:48:09,421 --> 01:48:13,170
They're not going to know your Wernher von
Braun from NASA. Don't sweat it, buddy.

2051
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:14,820
We're all good now.
It's all groovy.

2052
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:17,790
That's like what your friend is like
really douchey. Didn't like just look,

2053
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:21,420
just don't bring it up. Let's just go.
Just leave this fucking guy though. Man.

2054
01:48:21,421 --> 01:48:25,020
This documentary was so intense when
he would chose Tattoo and he would talk

2055
01:48:25,021 --> 01:48:28,080
about seeing Wernher von Braun and
talk about, you know, the, you know,

2056
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,270
how they would hang people
in the front of the factory.

2057
01:48:30,271 --> 01:48:33,150
Like this shit is never leaving
that guy's brain. You know,

2058
01:48:33,151 --> 01:48:36,690
that guy was a slave for a while and
here now he was living in Miami and you

2059
01:48:36,691 --> 01:48:39,050
know,
relaxing his entire retirement years away.

2060
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:42,150
But there was a point in that guy's
life where he lived in utter terror

2061
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:45,600
surrounded by monsters.
Like the goddamned star wars episode.

2062
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:48,720
The storm troopers would come in
and they would just, you know,

2063
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:53,790
a lot of people he knew were dead.
That's some scary shit.

2064
01:48:53,791 --> 01:48:56,400
Think that people are willing to
go that and they go that, you know,

2065
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:59,700
relatively easily. You know, it's
not, it's not like, you know,

2066
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:03,030
that's hard to get people to do. It's
happened many times. I mean, it is hard,

2067
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:06,280
but it's happened many, many
times throughout history
of Pol Pot with, you know,

2068
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,920
so many different cases of genocide.
The Stalin,

2069
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:11,970
I mean all these different examples
all around the world. Liberia, yeah.

2070
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:15,360
So many all around the world. I mean,
look what's going on in Iraq. I mean,

2071
01:49:15,361 --> 01:49:18,870
if you talk about the numbers
in Iraq, supposedly, uh,

2072
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,000
according to many credible sources,

2073
01:49:21,001 --> 01:49:25,380
a million civilians have died since
2002 or 2003, whenever we invaded.

2074
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:29,460
I'm not doing it in a million a million.
Wrap your brain around that, you know,

2075
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:31,860
wrap your brain around that.
That's some crazy shit.

2076
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:34,710
Do you remember that old footage of the,
um,

2077
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:38,580
the guys on tanks and they were listening
to death metal and they were fucking,

2078
01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:41,250
they were shooting, they showed like
what it's like to be over there in Iraq.

2079
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:44,310
Remember that's just the x's
eliminate them. Yeah. These guys,

2080
01:49:44,311 --> 01:49:46,770
they were listening to music.
They were listening to like crazy,

2081
01:49:46,771 --> 01:49:49,360
like metal music while they
were shooting people in Iraq.

2082
01:49:49,361 --> 01:49:51,730
And I remember it was a,
it was a video and you know,

2083
01:49:51,731 --> 01:49:53,830
they were interviewing these guys
and what's it like? It was, you know,

2084
01:49:53,831 --> 01:49:56,550
they're smoking cigarettes in their real
young and it's like so surreal to them.

2085
01:49:56,551 --> 01:49:59,940
Yeah. But it doesn't even seem
real. Apparently. This is all, um,

2086
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:03,130
the wiki leaks put that out too.
Oh yeah. That was the first one.

2087
01:50:03,131 --> 01:50:04,760
We're missing something. I
didn't know that man. Yeah,

2088
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:07,360
I did not know that was the first
thing when they got some friendly fire

2089
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:11,140
situation. See somebody kill talking
about, it's called collateral murder.

2090
01:50:11,141 --> 01:50:13,660
That's a video that they released.
That was the start of all this wiki leaks.

2091
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:16,840
This shit was way before that.
A few years before that. Yeah.

2092
01:50:16,841 --> 01:50:19,670
They've been involved for a long
time release and shit. I did.

2093
01:50:19,671 --> 01:50:22,260
I didn't know that they had been around
as long as it had been around that a

2094
01:50:22,261 --> 01:50:26,260
sandwich dude. It's so fucking
interesting. It's fascinating.
But seems so douchey.

2095
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:30,670
Like when you read, did you read his
online dating profile? No. Oh my God.

2096
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:33,790
He's just,
just so douchey.

2097
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:38,710
Just like it comes through the screen
and gets your fingers greasy. Really.

2098
01:50:39,870 --> 01:50:43,710
Like, you know what he's talking
about? Like you know, who does it,

2099
01:50:43,711 --> 01:50:46,570
what does he want to meet people for
Friendship for, you know, whatever.

2100
01:50:46,570 --> 01:50:49,720
And it's like, it's just
like, it's the, first of all,

2101
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:54,700
literally it is impossible to make an
online dating profile and not come off

2102
01:50:54,701 --> 01:50:58,420
Douchey. It's not possible. It
is not talk yourself up. Right.

2103
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:01,660
You have to talk yourself up and you have
to lie about what you're looking for.

2104
01:51:01,661 --> 01:51:02,171
What are you looking for?

2105
01:51:02,171 --> 01:51:05,510
I'm looking for some really easy pussy
from a hot girl is not going to ask too

2106
01:51:05,511 --> 01:51:08,770
many questions where it's not going to
get crazy and you're never going to be

2107
01:51:08,771 --> 01:51:11,530
mad at me cause I don't want to be with
you anymore. Can I get that? No, no.

2108
01:51:11,531 --> 01:51:13,900
And so everybody's got this whole thing.
I'm looking for romance.

2109
01:51:13,901 --> 01:51:16,780
I mean even if you're not, you know,
so it's impossible to, you know,

2110
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:19,520
I'm outgoing but I, you know, I'm,

2111
01:51:19,530 --> 01:51:23,200
I'm friendly to a fault and look for the
real me. You'll be pleasantly surprised.

2112
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:26,410
Oh good.
Like what you find is someone,

2113
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:28,840
she should make a profile and just overdo.
Sure.

2114
01:51:28,841 --> 01:51:31,210
We're doing almost like Brody
Stevens that where it's like,

2115
01:51:31,450 --> 01:51:35,740
like a becomes a comedy set. Scott,
I have a couple out there somewhere.

2116
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:39,970
Do you have dating? Probably
hilarious. Big will after a fiance,

2117
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:42,460
the seven year relationship ended.
I went through a,

2118
01:51:42,461 --> 01:51:46,120
like a or I have been single in
eight years or so, seven years.

2119
01:51:46,121 --> 01:51:47,230
I have no idea what to do,

2120
01:51:47,231 --> 01:51:52,150
so I got into the online thing because
it was before Facebook and Myspace,

2121
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:53,440
you know?
Really,

2122
01:51:53,441 --> 01:51:56,140
so it's just making a my space profile
pretty much just the craziest thing.

2123
01:51:56,141 --> 01:52:00,120
What you did is you want in the last
like fucking 70 pounds or something.

2124
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:04,240
What did you lose? How much do you
lose? I got 70 70 pounds, 70 pounds.

2125
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:07,270
I remember when you got
super giant like Smurf,

2126
01:52:07,271 --> 01:52:11,740
like yeah dude,
you couldn't walk straight.

2127
01:52:11,741 --> 01:52:15,570
Your legs would rub in the middle. You'd
have to, you'd have to, Ralphie may at.

2128
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:19,060
You'd have to circle your legs on the
outside and then bring them back in the

2129
01:52:19,061 --> 01:52:22,510
front or it's impression,
a good impression.

2130
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:25,230
He's got the worst impressions of
anyone I've ever heard of. Yeah.

2131
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,970
It's not a good impact. Maybe. At
least I don't do it. It's amazing.

2132
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:31,240
It's amazing how awesome they are.
Gizmo from Gremlin's singing.

2133
01:52:34,570 --> 01:52:37,190
It's pretty good. That's
old school geek. Cool.

2134
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:43,490
How am I doing it? Mock why? That was
a great your mind. No, I loved it.

2135
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,980
I loved it when they got
wet turn monsters and

2136
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,820
shit. Cause that what happened? They
got started and then they become evil.

2137
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:51,951
It's so crazy.

2138
01:52:51,951 --> 01:52:54,680
Like they're so cute when they're little
tiny things and then turned into key

2139
01:52:54,681 --> 01:52:58,730
for school. You get them wet? Yeah.
What? Or feed him after midnight. Oh,

2140
01:52:58,731 --> 01:53:02,250
feed them after midnight. That was all
a metaphor for treating women, isn't it?

2141
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:04,520
You can't get them alcohol after midnight
because it will become crazy animals.

2142
01:53:04,521 --> 01:53:08,090
They we come horse bitches. You can't
deal with them bitches, man. Bitches.

2143
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:10,810
It ain't about that Brian.
Man. Don't become a woman
hater. Okay, just kidding. No,

2144
01:53:10,820 --> 01:53:14,060
that's from a movie that's from like
say anything or said, Oh really?

2145
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:18,670
I didn't know that you, um,
are you worried about becoming
a woman? Hear me? Yeah.

2146
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:22,400
Oh No, absolutely. Absolutely. No worries.
Fuck no chicks don't have to worry. Sweet.

2147
01:53:22,401 --> 01:53:25,880
Brian will never go away. No, I'm
a crazy hater. You're crazy heater.

2148
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:27,730
Is that what it is? Did
you take crazy? Yeah.

2149
01:53:27,731 --> 01:53:31,090
I just need to start changing
my go to yoga classes,

2150
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:35,180
brow and pizza on centered
girls with loose sweat pants.

2151
01:53:35,181 --> 01:53:36,170
You know what I'm talking about?

2152
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:42,740
Joe Rogen downward facing dog
all up in this bitch. Yeah,

2153
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:45,480
I heard that's the best place though
to actually hit head on my man.

2154
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:48,990
Mr. Sing it girls buttholes all day.
And then you see how flexible and yeah.

2155
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:50,090
Sexy their bodies,

2156
01:53:50,091 --> 01:53:54,170
man hope finger of it in terms of that
and see if they fart when they get stuck

2157
01:53:54,171 --> 01:53:57,680
in weird positions at saddle ranch when
they have some inviting the bowl on.

2158
01:53:57,681 --> 01:54:01,790
Super slow. Some hot girl, super
slow riding. It was like, oh my God.

2159
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:05,030
All the guys were looking at trying not
to look like they are looking. Yeah,

2160
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:06,620
it's just hot. Yeah. There's a,

2161
01:54:06,621 --> 01:54:09,650
there's a some strange connection
between his imagine there.

2162
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:13,160
It's you under the right.
I saw Tipco at the other day.

2163
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:19,190
Always waiting for that and a bull riding.
Yeah, it was black chick, black chicks,

2164
01:54:19,191 --> 01:54:20,850
tit.
Nice black chicks on a bull ride.

2165
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:24,890
This just letting me know I need some
white Dick Krakow. Yeah, let's get it on

2166
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:27,110
Brian.
Um,

2167
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,780
have you considered maybe trying some
black checks out since he's white chicks?

2168
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:33,470
I, yeah, we've talked about this
and I, I have a certain, yeah,

2169
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:35,570
I'm totally going to go for
it. Hey, I would go for it,

2170
01:54:35,571 --> 01:54:39,550
but it has to be a certain
kind of a certain kind of
black check. Not a big one.

2171
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:42,950
Not the one that like if you just don't
squint your eyes and imagine them with

2172
01:54:42,951 --> 01:54:44,870
short hair that they're
a guy. Oh, by the way,

2173
01:54:44,871 --> 01:54:48,230
have you seen pictures of
Little Kim? Yeah. Oh my God.

2174
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:50,930
Google Little Kim photos.
Show it to Ari.

2175
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:53,710
She did crazy plastic
surgery and she became like,

2176
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:57,500
she looks like a Vietnamese woman.
Lil Kim Little Kim is dude,

2177
01:54:57,530 --> 01:55:01,610
it's really hard to look at.
Chief really, really fucked up.

2178
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:06,690
Like really bad. It's almost like
Steven Tyler. Yeah. He looks like a bat.

2179
01:55:06,691 --> 01:55:10,860
Boom man. Look, go back up to that. Yeah.
Look at that. He looks like a bat. Boom.

2180
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,400
His whole bottom of his
lip thing is jutting out.

2181
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:19,250
I bet he gets stuck on me and cock.
Oh, you'd know what those big fat lips.

2182
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:21,800
Yeah.
Ooh,

2183
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:23,610
that's a football player,
I think.

2184
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:27,090
Isn't it weird how the doctors come out
in scrubs as if they just came from the

2185
01:55:27,091 --> 01:55:29,990
hospital? That guy. Why don't
you just Google the actual image?

2186
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:31,350
It's on the second page.

2187
01:55:32,190 --> 01:55:33,023
Yeah,

2188
01:55:33,270 --> 01:55:35,670
it's really crazy. You got to
see it. They don't just have it.

2189
01:55:35,671 --> 01:55:38,790
Can you just Google images? What do you
do when you're scrolling? Like my mom,

2190
01:55:39,230 --> 01:55:43,800
this is how my mind, Dark
Ages. I'll find you. Mine.

2191
01:55:43,801 --> 01:55:48,270
You're just always in a hurry.
Why are you always in a hurry?

2192
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:51,540
My mother became Jewish chickson name.

2193
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:55,860
It's the most annoying impression you
could do. Have a mother, little Kim,

2194
01:55:55,890 --> 01:56:00,210
little Kim, l I. L little Kim photos,
plastic surgery. What the fuck?

2195
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:05,190
Type all that out and here we go. Bam.
Look at her on the right kind of crazy.

2196
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:09,180
It kind of looks like it might be makeup.
She was on Jackson. I don't know Bro.

2197
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:12,490
That's coming off. What?
She has the cat eye.

2198
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:18,120
I look at her nose man. Other
ones, their before and after.

2199
01:56:18,210 --> 01:56:20,820
She looks a little like Janet
Jackson. If there's a way worse, Bro.

2200
01:56:20,821 --> 01:56:24,300
I think way worse. Janet Jackson. Well,
I haven't seen Janet Jackson recently,

2201
01:56:24,301 --> 01:56:29,190
but for the longest time she kept
it together. See before and after.

2202
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:34,800
Let's see that one on the top was
it? That's her. Look at that dude.

2203
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:39,210
She's hot there. It's already
a little Asian. Huh? Whoa.

2204
01:56:39,211 --> 01:56:42,960
Look at the difference that is monstrous.
That it's terrifying.

2205
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:46,080
And then it was kind of looks
the same though. You said about

2206
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:49,390
people, man, where they, they just
start fucking changing their face.

2207
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:54,020
That's so scary. Well, I can, I can
totally relate to that. Like having to,

2208
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:56,930
haven't done, not what tattoos
but with having done, um,

2209
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:00,160
hair transplants because a
dunk doing hair transplants,

2210
01:57:00,161 --> 01:57:02,950
like I was losing my hair and I was
like, well, how do I stop this man?

2211
01:57:02,951 --> 01:57:03,730
Is there a way to stop it?

2212
01:57:03,730 --> 01:57:05,950
I don't want to wear a fucking
wig and I want to be bald. Like,

2213
01:57:05,951 --> 01:57:06,784
how do I stop this?

2214
01:57:06,910 --> 01:57:10,360
So then a friend of mine had gotten hair
transplants and he had me convinced,

2215
01:57:10,361 --> 01:57:12,730
he's like, dude, just getting
her to transfer the team.
They take it from the back.

2216
01:57:12,731 --> 01:57:13,331
They put it the front,

2217
01:57:13,331 --> 01:57:15,940
like you do it as you're losing your hair
and you can keep your hair. I'm like,

2218
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:20,230
oh, okay, cool. And so I did it and
right after I did it I felt like, oh,

2219
01:57:20,231 --> 01:57:23,020
now you have this stupid scar
in the back of your head.

2220
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:24,220
Didn't they tell you about the scar?

2221
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:27,280
That all I knew about the stupid
scar but I didn't think about it.

2222
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:29,590
You don't need to think about ads in the
back of the head was going to notice,

2223
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:32,440
you know, you think everything's
going to turn out normal and be fine.

2224
01:57:32,441 --> 01:57:34,840
And then I wanted to do
another one to correct it.

2225
01:57:34,841 --> 01:57:37,960
So I did another one and it looks still
looks like shit now the scar in the back

2226
01:57:37,961 --> 01:57:39,970
of my head is bigger and after a while,
you know,

2227
01:57:39,971 --> 01:57:44,190
it's like you can get roped into like
I know a guy who um, uh, he does, he's,

2228
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:45,580
he passed away a few years ago,

2229
01:57:45,730 --> 01:57:49,450
but he was obsessed with plastic surgery
and he was a nice guy and he's in show

2230
01:57:49,451 --> 01:57:52,780
business and he had done a
bunch of different things
to the point where his face

2231
01:57:52,781 --> 01:57:57,520
look weird and his, he had peck implants
and he had a bunch of hair transplants.

2232
01:57:57,790 --> 01:57:58,600
You just start,

2233
01:57:58,600 --> 01:58:02,860
you start fucking with your appearance
like that and it becomes like a up,

2234
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:06,460
it becomes like a
pathology. Yeah. You like,

2235
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:10,900
you get sick like [inaudible] who have
issues that two people do the same thing.

2236
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:13,810
Yeah. Yeah. Two, three, four.
Well, I shouldn't say that.

2237
01:58:13,811 --> 01:58:16,540
I mean both of my arms or
sleeved, but I'm stopping. I mean,

2238
01:58:16,541 --> 01:58:18,850
I don't have a problem.
I just felt like when I did the one,

2239
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:22,180
I felt like I was on balanced and then
I really had an idea for the second one

2240
01:58:22,181 --> 01:58:24,760
that I wanted to do and I'm like, I
don't mind having two sleeves of tattoos.

2241
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:27,130
It's not like I'm getting them on
my fucking face or anything crazy.

2242
01:58:27,131 --> 01:58:28,780
Which speaking of does something like,

2243
01:58:28,781 --> 01:58:32,380
there's a line where you're not supposed
to tattoo and your face is that line

2244
01:58:32,410 --> 01:58:36,160
above you see the Kushi Lane. Have
you seen Gucci Mane? Have you seen it?

2245
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:41,080
You haven't seen Gucci Mane.
Gucci. You type up Gucci Mane.

2246
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:45,880
Face Tattoo, get ready for this.
Gucci Mane is a rapper. Okay.

2247
01:58:46,090 --> 01:58:50,350
And he got a face tattoo and
his face tattoo is an ice cream.

2248
01:58:50,351 --> 01:58:52,060
Cassava,
I saw the,

2249
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:57,220
it says three scoops of ice cream on it
and it says burr. That's it. I'm thought,

2250
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:02,440
I know it's top left. Top Top. That's not
that. There we go. Yeah, that's the image.

2251
01:59:02,441 --> 01:59:04,870
Click on that. Folks
online. You, you, you,

2252
01:59:04,871 --> 01:59:06,820
you have to see this
if you haven't already,

2253
01:59:06,821 --> 01:59:10,150
most of the Internet already has seen
it, but it's like, it's clear madness.

2254
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:10,630
I mean,

2255
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:14,080
he gets released from a mental institution
and then he has an ice cream cone

2256
01:59:14,081 --> 01:59:17,870
tattooed on his face. This
guy out of war, if you,

2257
01:59:18,490 --> 01:59:19,720
it's like it's live like clinger,
right?

2258
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:25,090
It's my horrible,

2259
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:28,270
I'll just keep saying I'm a cross dresser
until they let me out and me more.

2260
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:32,950
It was, I can't match. Goes on forever.
Check Brian's tattooed or Brian's tattoo.

2261
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:35,410
He got it from a guy who
was learning how to Tattoo,

2262
01:59:35,411 --> 01:59:39,550
so we talked to them for [inaudible]
school. No good cheap shit.

2263
01:59:39,551 --> 01:59:42,760
This chick that w that worked for me
when I was a manager of movie theater.

2264
01:59:42,761 --> 01:59:46,690
She's like, I want to be a tattoo artist.
My Ha, my boyfriend owns a tattoo studio.

2265
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,610
He's been trying to
teach me on cantaloupes.

2266
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:52,510
Would you like to be my first person?
It will be free. I was like, sure,

2267
01:59:52,511 --> 01:59:55,720
why not cantaloupes? You know you're
supposed to practice on pig ears and shit.

2268
01:59:56,110 --> 02:00:00,700
That's just relax on pigskin similar to
humans scam, but it's an art form man.

2269
02:00:00,701 --> 02:00:02,800
Like,
you know my boy Aaron Dellavedova,

2270
02:00:02,801 --> 02:00:07,040
my buddy from a crew tattoo who does my
stuff, he totally offered to to fix it.

2271
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:10,390
It's kind of funny story now.
Like I was the other day,

2272
02:00:10,391 --> 02:00:13,450
I was just laying in bed and I worked on
this movie called a better way to die a

2273
02:00:13,451 --> 02:00:16,660
long time ago and my job was to do like,
all right this,

2274
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:21,130
you need to make this a tag,
this whole area, like all
these cars, all these walls,

2275
02:00:21,131 --> 02:00:22,450
you need to make it little at graffiti.

2276
02:00:22,451 --> 02:00:27,440
Like it's a gang ridden
a alley in Chicago. Yeah,

2277
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:30,670
I was doing said what?

2278
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:33,350
Fuck you become so interested in this.

2279
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:35,170
So that was a chick I'd be
showing to you right now.

2280
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:37,840
How fast it was done so many things.

2281
02:00:37,841 --> 02:00:40,780
It was like three days after I got
this tattoo and I'm like, dude,

2282
02:00:40,781 --> 02:00:43,060
I'm just going to put my
fucking tattoo everywhere.

2283
02:00:43,061 --> 02:00:44,860
So I just sprayed my tattoo on the walls,

2284
02:00:44,861 --> 02:00:47,200
on the cars and that put nine
inch nails and a couple of places.

2285
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:50,710
But then I did all these like my tattoos
and so the other day I'm just sitting

2286
02:00:50,711 --> 02:00:52,960
there watching it and then it
was like, good. I'm like, Oh,

2287
02:00:52,961 --> 02:00:55,030
this is a movie I worked
on. And it was like, wow,

2288
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:59,130
there's my waterfall tattoo
everywhere. I was like, that's,

2289
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:03,190
I just changed that scene into like the
faggy ass gang scene everywhere by the

2290
02:01:03,191 --> 02:01:05,890
way. You explain to people what
waterfall tattoo ones cause they don't,

2291
02:01:05,950 --> 02:01:06,580
well I got,

2292
02:01:06,580 --> 02:01:09,850
I went and got this free tattoo or
whatever and I looked in the book and then

2293
02:01:09,890 --> 02:01:13,140
the couple of things I liked
were like Egyptian turtles and,

2294
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:17,800
and I saw it. I was like into Asian
girls at that time or whatever.

2295
02:01:17,801 --> 02:01:22,120
So I got an are in Chinese and they
put it together and I said I also like

2296
02:01:22,121 --> 02:01:22,690
Spiderman.

2297
02:01:22,690 --> 02:01:27,430
So they mixed the three up and it's like
Spiderman logo with a Chinese letter in

2298
02:01:27,431 --> 02:01:28,830
the middle. Hey, I'm,

2299
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:32,010
you know that I have it as a new hire
primate tee shirts coming out yet. Yeah.

2300
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:34,540
For folks who don't know,
if you go to higher primate,

2301
02:01:34,541 --> 02:01:37,000
higher-primate.com
that's my clothing line.

2302
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:40,010
I actually have a clothing line now
called higher primate and it's real

2303
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:40,820
low key.

2304
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:44,660
I'm just kinda trying to figure it out
before I going to go commercial with it.

2305
02:01:44,661 --> 02:01:49,280
Yeah. That's all just t shirts. I'm
going to have fanny packs to stay strong.

2306
02:01:49,281 --> 02:01:53,180
Faggy pack date. Truong bitches
love annual packs coming back, son.

2307
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:56,120
I've traveled a fair. Any artist
fears? Seen it. Brian seen it.

2308
02:01:56,121 --> 02:01:58,840
I'm not fucking around with his fanny
pack would be cool if you renamed it baggy

2309
02:01:58,850 --> 02:02:03,290
pack pack faggy packs. That's not bad.
That's a good idea, right? Why not, right,

2310
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:08,300
right. It's not fancy. It's not fag hag
enough though. Pat, any pack. Anyway,

2311
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:11,810
the point is, my point is with
these new t shirts, we could, uh,

2312
02:02:11,811 --> 02:02:15,630
I want to make that red band logo
with the, the explosion. The,

2313
02:02:15,631 --> 02:02:18,680
the suicide kitty suicide kitty.
Yeah. Let's turn that into a shirt.

2314
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:21,650
I've got to do that. We'll sell
it. You know, we could just,

2315
02:02:21,710 --> 02:02:24,140
I'll have these guys make it for you.
You already have the thing.

2316
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:27,860
So we have the company to make sure it's
now and we'll, uh, we'll sell it on.

2317
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:29,870
We know what,
we'll just sit on red button,

2318
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:32,960
red band.com because I know a lot of
people on the board asked about it.

2319
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:35,600
I would wear that shit. Yeah, I like
it. It's kind of an inside thing,

2320
02:02:35,601 --> 02:02:37,630
like no one would even know what
the fuck that means. You know,

2321
02:02:37,650 --> 02:02:41,780
it's so funny as a, uh, I, those other
podcasts I did the death squad podcasts,

2322
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:42,710
stitcher,

2323
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:46,670
just put them on the radio and they kind
of like make a local thing like welcome

2324
02:02:46,671 --> 02:02:50,840
to the United States has like, did they,
they know that that's like a Hitler cat,

2325
02:02:50,850 --> 02:02:54,640
that Hitler who's covered with explosive,
explosive,

2326
02:02:54,641 --> 02:02:57,980
no suicide in his hand
for people don't know,

2327
02:02:57,981 --> 02:02:59,150
like what does his death squad thing.

2328
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:01,370
This all happened when we
were on a opie and Anthony,

2329
02:03:01,371 --> 02:03:04,300
and this is like fucking
many years ago. Uh, we,

2330
02:03:04,350 --> 02:03:08,290
I came on to Opie and Anthony and uh,
I brought with me Eddie Bravo, uh,

2331
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:09,291
Tait Fletcher.

2332
02:03:09,291 --> 02:03:12,610
And this was like right after Tate had
done the ultimate fighter and Tate was a

2333
02:03:13,190 --> 02:03:14,780
traveled on the road with us.
And Brian,

2334
02:03:14,781 --> 02:03:16,940
you came on to write and who
else was already, did you go,

2335
02:03:16,941 --> 02:03:19,040
you can walk about another time.
He came on a different time.

2336
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:21,540
You came out of the time
when we roasted Jamie, uh,

2337
02:03:21,940 --> 02:03:26,150
saw that as a baby and the baby bird
that was that far off in another minute.

2338
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:29,000
So we've done many, many times.
Anyway, we'd come in and you know,

2339
02:03:29,001 --> 02:03:34,001
Tate is such an imposing figure taters
this gigantic fucking hunk of a man and a

2340
02:03:34,101 --> 02:03:35,210
we'd walk in the room with,
you know,

2341
02:03:35,211 --> 02:03:37,250
everybody knows Eddie Bravo
is his Jujitsu master.

2342
02:03:37,251 --> 02:03:39,500
He just choked out horror
Gracie. And then, you know,

2343
02:03:39,501 --> 02:03:44,240
it's like so oop goes looking at Joe
Rogan's with the death squad and then it

2344
02:03:44,241 --> 02:03:48,350
became weeks, you know, just thought
it was so silly. You know, death squad.

2345
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:51,380
We started calling ourselves
dusk squad. Yeah, I started,
actually, this is kind of,

2346
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:54,560
it's kind of interesting. Back in the
day when podcasts were first made,

2347
02:03:54,830 --> 02:03:58,190
I started making little short Joe show
videos and then call them death squad.

2348
02:03:58,191 --> 02:04:01,430
And they were only available on
iTunes as a podcast video podcast.

2349
02:04:01,470 --> 02:04:05,580
I had had 12 of them or something like
that. Yeah. Those fucking old videos do.

2350
02:04:05,581 --> 02:04:06,860
Some of those were brilliant.

2351
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,770
I went back and watched a couple of
those old desk squads that you did.

2352
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:13,880
Some of those were fucking funny as
shit and some of the moments we captured

2353
02:04:13,881 --> 02:04:18,560
were so ridiculous. Getting mad at you
for about Ari Shaffir becoming a lawyer.

2354
02:04:18,740 --> 02:04:20,150
Okay.
There was a guy who was

2355
02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:26,650
insane and he said he was the Holy Spirit
and he needed help and he wanted to

2356
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:31,130
somehow or another, he wanted me to
help him and, and then Ari got involved,

2357
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:35,150
you know, you call a call. I got her
home. I was, I didn't have a spot.

2358
02:04:35,151 --> 02:04:37,980
It's like 1230 or something at the
store. So you, you had having this

2359
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:39,990
whole argument. I had no idea. You're
just calling me like, hey listen,

2360
02:04:39,991 --> 02:04:42,240
I need you to be my lawyer.
I'm like, what? What do you
mean if you're my lawyer?

2361
02:04:42,690 --> 02:04:44,550
He's like, someone's gonna call you
and you got to be my Lord. I'm like,

2362
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:47,510
what should I say? I'm like, Hey, I've got
another call here. Your mother, goodbye.

2363
02:04:49,790 --> 02:04:51,850
[inaudible] one of those dudes who,
you know,

2364
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:54,450
if you got a friend who
was a standup comedian,

2365
02:04:54,451 --> 02:04:57,270
but he has got a wife and he's
got kids and he's got a day job,

2366
02:04:57,271 --> 02:04:59,360
he's got a lot of,
you can't count on that motherfucker.

2367
02:04:59,370 --> 02:05:00,630
He's not always down for the fund.

2368
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:03,020
But I could call Ra should fear at
three o'clock in the morning. Ari,

2369
02:05:03,030 --> 02:05:06,350
I need you to represent me as my lawyer.
Are you comfortable with this? Uh,

2370
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:10,590
because the background is
pretty high right now, but,

2371
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:15,790
so anyway, go ahead. It's got called me
so he can take down the footage of you.

2372
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:18,480
You said you have to call my lawyer to
take on this footage. It's very important.

2373
02:05:18,481 --> 02:05:20,830
If you want to take down the footage,
you're going to have to call my lawyer,

2374
02:05:20,831 --> 02:05:24,060
my lawyer, because this crazy
guy, he was completely nuts.

2375
02:05:24,090 --> 02:05:26,480
And in retrospect and you thought
was the Holy Spirit. Yeah,

2376
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:27,480
I thought it was the Holy Spirit.

2377
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:30,900
I forget a lot of other shit that he
said he was trying. He was gonna Sue,

2378
02:05:30,901 --> 02:05:35,760
John Edwards
psychic for being a false prophet.

2379
02:05:36,590 --> 02:05:39,930
And I remember going like, why should
we sue him? Like, why would you sue him?

2380
02:05:39,931 --> 02:05:42,870
He's like, this is a false prophet. He
was going to, but why you, you know?

2381
02:05:42,871 --> 02:05:46,350
He had a lot of interesting things to
say. Yeah, great. Back massage too.

2382
02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:50,460
I got him to give me power of attorney
over all his affairs verbally recorded it.

2383
02:05:50,610 --> 02:05:52,590
I don't know what I do. I
can get the recording. Yeah,

2384
02:05:52,591 --> 02:05:55,510
I did it and then he disappeared for
a while and then he came back. Right.

2385
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:59,940
Sued me. How long ago did he
go to court court and sued me?

2386
02:06:00,270 --> 02:06:04,020
I forgot about that.
He sued me for millions of $18 million.

2387
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:07,980
We get nervous at all.
Where you even a little bit,

2388
02:06:08,090 --> 02:06:11,460
well first I wrote this guy on
for like six months to a year.

2389
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:15,560
Just kept until they got too annoying
and I was like, I'm bored. But yeah,

2390
02:06:15,570 --> 02:06:19,380
he sued me for big fig, a bad attorney.
I'm like, I represented you pro bono.

2391
02:06:19,410 --> 02:06:21,780
How many people are out there right now
who are looking to get mad at something

2392
02:06:21,781 --> 02:06:23,850
like,
that's real good fucking Dick.

2393
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:26,250
Text somebody with mental
illness and make fun of them.

2394
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:28,440
It's really funny fucking Shit.

2395
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:32,520
Hope you drowned in a river of age that's
like obviously it's not a nice thing

2396
02:06:32,521 --> 02:06:34,740
to do, but it was fun anyway.
There's a guy was annoying.

2397
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:37,230
He was annoying from the get go, which
is why we did this in the first place.

2398
02:06:37,231 --> 02:06:39,840
We couldn't get rid of them.
It's amazing.

2399
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:43,740
How bad is it if you actually eat
toothpaste? Terrible for in Florida.

2400
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:44,590
Really awful.
Yeah.

2401
02:06:44,710 --> 02:06:47,070
I mean it's not going to kill you
because like do you real toxic levels of

2402
02:06:47,071 --> 02:06:47,490
Florida.

2403
02:06:47,490 --> 02:06:50,850
I bet if you ate a whole
tube of toothpaste you could
probably get really sucked

2404
02:06:50,851 --> 02:06:55,530
up. Even like one drop to
go to the emergency room.

2405
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:57,690
No names to faces or something like that.

2406
02:06:57,691 --> 02:07:01,500
They might say that just to cover
their ass cause I used to that we,

2407
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:05,280
that was my go to thing and you know,
keep a tube of toothpaste and my car,

2408
02:07:05,281 --> 02:07:09,300
you know and just like eat
it [inaudible] something bad.

2409
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:10,520
Don't do that man.
Well,

2410
02:07:10,620 --> 02:07:14,310
that was like when I was 16 about fluoride
in the drinking water and everybody

2411
02:07:14,311 --> 02:07:15,810
claims to know exactly.

2412
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:19,010
By the way that sound you're hearing is
a shot at the volcano you ever comes to.

2413
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:23,280
No, but where are the people dying?
Where is it happening? Interesting.

2414
02:07:23,281 --> 02:07:25,860
Where the interesting part
about it is that that is all a,

2415
02:07:25,861 --> 02:07:29,220
supposedly if you go online
and read the websites,

2416
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,680
communists based on a Nazi shit,

2417
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:36,250
the idea of keeping the people
a passive and keeping people

2418
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:38,850
in their place and making sure
they're docile and easy to control,

2419
02:07:38,851 --> 02:07:40,900
and that was the idea of putting
fluoride in the water supply.

2420
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:44,530
I highly doubt that's why it helps
your toy. Yeah, I think it's probably,

2421
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:45,970
I don't know if it does help your t's.

2422
02:07:45,980 --> 02:07:48,640
I don't really know cause there's
a lot of things that say this. No,

2423
02:07:48,641 --> 02:07:50,880
that's not the case. What helps
your teeth is fucking cleaning him.

2424
02:07:50,881 --> 02:07:53,710
You fucking pigs now.
That's what's good for your teeth.

2425
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:57,180
I use Tom's of Maine toothpaste and it
doesn't have fluoride in it for that shit.

2426
02:07:57,310 --> 02:08:01,750
There certain types of sweet berry
taste taste like you're eating chocolate

2427
02:08:01,751 --> 02:08:04,240
tastes like the shit I used when I lift
weights and I put chalk on my hands.

2428
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:09,120
Do you think that maybe that toothpaste
is PR missing some thing that you,

2429
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:12,840
no cavities. I haven't had
cavities in a law. Really. I'm,

2430
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:15,360
I'm pretty good at brushing. That's
going the last time I went to the, um,

2431
02:08:15,740 --> 02:08:16,260
to the eye,

2432
02:08:16,260 --> 02:08:20,560
first of all I went like years without
any teeth cleaning and then I went to the

2433
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:24,690
dentist and I didn't have any cabinet has
really surprised you got to do it dude.

2434
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:28,830
If you fuck up like yeah,
learn, learn from my mistake.
I eat so many gummy bears.

2435
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:32,400
Don't, I definitely have cavities and
you go to sleep right? You just crash.

2436
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:35,450
That's not good.
Good morning.

2437
02:08:35,780 --> 02:08:39,150
And you got to clean your teeth because
your gums will receive to which,

2438
02:08:39,151 --> 02:08:43,430
which did happen to me. There was
an area where I had a a cap and um,

2439
02:08:43,470 --> 02:08:47,040
if you got a really clean around those
things, cause it's not like natural,

2440
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:50,160
you know, you can get a lot of plaque
and then my gum is receding a little bit.

2441
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:53,260
So then I had to get it really they
take gum from the back and put it in the

2442
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:56,850
fall. It wasn't like that. It does.
They do do that though. It's really bad.

2443
02:08:56,851 --> 02:08:59,580
Or is there this great bit of a hair
transplant now because get them now,

2444
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:03,300
not 25 years ago when they were terrible.
Now is when you get the procedure.

2445
02:09:03,301 --> 02:09:06,810
Even now, don't get it a ticket from me
folks. This is the way I describe it.

2446
02:09:06,930 --> 02:09:09,690
This is how stupid the idea of hair
transplants are. You're taking,

2447
02:09:09,691 --> 02:09:14,430
it's like taking people who are really
healthy and moving him to a neighborhood

2448
02:09:14,431 --> 02:09:17,190
where everyone's dying. Cause
that's what it's like. Cause they,

2449
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:20,280
the hair that you have up on the top of
your head after you've transplant Harris,

2450
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:23,520
the other hair's gonna fall out too.
So even though it looks okay at first,

2451
02:09:23,521 --> 02:09:25,830
like when I was on like news
radio is when I first got it done,

2452
02:09:25,831 --> 02:09:27,750
my hair looked fucking sport.
He just started Rogan.

2453
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:30,570
Did you look at Rogan for a picture?

2454
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:34,680
No, I was, I was thinking about doing it.

2455
02:09:34,681 --> 02:09:38,050
I don't really need it too bad because
I've always had high. We're now,

2456
02:09:38,070 --> 02:09:42,060
but the problem is is if you look
at Rogaine, it only does the middle.

2457
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:45,380
No, no, no. Broken. Does the back corner.
Oh No, no, no, no. It does everything.

2458
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:48,890
It was a study that they did in the
study they did was on the vertex of the

2459
02:09:48,891 --> 02:09:51,620
scalp and the idea was that
you can't prove you'd have to,

2460
02:09:51,621 --> 02:09:54,260
it would have to go and spend millions
and millions of dollars and I studied to

2461
02:09:54,261 --> 02:09:55,700
show the reason why it works on this,

2462
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:58,850
the reason why it works at all is it
increases circulation to the area so it

2463
02:09:58,851 --> 02:10:01,370
makes your hair grow.
It will work everywhere in your scalp.

2464
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,260
It doesn't just work in
the back of your head. Yes,

2465
02:10:03,410 --> 02:10:07,370
especially Propecia and Rogaine. Same
thing, but most people have bald spots.

2466
02:10:07,371 --> 02:10:09,800
In the back of the head and he had a
concentrate on one area of the head cause

2467
02:10:09,801 --> 02:10:12,740
they needed like a patch, you know that
they would prove that it worked there.

2468
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:15,350
So they proved that it worked in the
back of your head and so they just went

2469
02:10:15,351 --> 02:10:17,120
with it.
It proven to grow hair good enough.

2470
02:10:17,150 --> 02:10:20,060
They don't have to show you that it works.
It's not flowing to grow in the front.

2471
02:10:20,061 --> 02:10:24,020
But it's not just writer. But he died.
No, it does. It's, it's the way it works.

2472
02:10:24,021 --> 02:10:27,380
Shift Minoxidil Minoxidil when they
first made it was a high blood pressure

2473
02:10:27,381 --> 02:10:28,214
medication.

2474
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:32,040
See, I swear to God, even like on
Amazon or on their own advertising,

2475
02:10:32,041 --> 02:10:34,220
it says this is the
area. Exactly. They have

2476
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:36,980
to because that was the study
scientifically proven to wow. Yeah.

2477
02:10:36,981 --> 02:10:39,190
See they made the study.
Right. I see what I'm saying.

2478
02:10:39,790 --> 02:10:41,240
That's kind of weird that
they have to do that though.

2479
02:10:41,241 --> 02:10:44,470
And they couldn't say and it might
work on the other side. Yeah, no,

2480
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:47,480
they don't want to do that. They want
to, you can't say anything by that ghost.

2481
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:51,140
This is, we don't look good here.
Sucking out of plastic bags,

2482
02:10:51,530 --> 02:10:55,000
sucking missed out of bags. You
know, this does not look like a,

2483
02:10:55,030 --> 02:10:57,170
like something a healthy person.
When did your thing it's done.

2484
02:10:57,510 --> 02:10:58,320
I've got to go soon.

2485
02:10:58,320 --> 02:11:01,900
Okay, well let's end this fucking crazy
thing. You put a couple shows. Yeah.

2486
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:06,380
Vegas February 4th yeah. We're doing
a bunch of shows together. Ari.

2487
02:11:06,381 --> 02:11:10,320
Fear is coming to for the next one
is actually, um, West Palm Beach.

2488
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:12,870
We're doing the Improv in West Palm Beach,
the 28th,

2489
02:11:12,871 --> 02:11:15,330
29th and 30th West Palm Beach,
Florida.

2490
02:11:15,331 --> 02:11:17,770
So it be the young and
talented Mr Rsu fear.

2491
02:11:17,830 --> 02:11:21,480
And that is a dope fucking club.
It's gigantic.

2492
02:11:21,481 --> 02:11:26,010
It's like 650 50 seats. It's a,
it's awesome. So that's a, yeah,

2493
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:26,731
the 28th,

2494
02:11:26,731 --> 02:11:31,440
29th and 30th and then we're also
doing February 4th at the Mandalay Bay

2495
02:11:31,441 --> 02:11:34,320
theater. The big spot. Who's the
new one? How many seats is it?

2496
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:37,290
It's like 2000 and this would be the
biggest show I've ever done. Yeah,

2497
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:40,470
it's pretty well, I think in Canada
we did some bigger than that.

2498
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:45,480
Everybody was behind us. That
was, that was a few thousand.

2499
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:49,110
That was nuts. That was a
Calgary. Calgary was crazy.

2500
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:53,040
We did a bunch of shows up that you
missed the Toronto. Toronto was shit.

2501
02:11:53,190 --> 02:11:54,840
I'm trying to do my special in Toronto,

2502
02:11:54,930 --> 02:11:56,640
but I'm having a hard
time getting a venue.

2503
02:11:57,260 --> 02:11:59,760
It's in April and a lot of these
things are booked in advance.

2504
02:11:59,910 --> 02:12:01,740
But if I get a get a venue,
a good venue,

2505
02:12:01,741 --> 02:12:06,080
I want to do this special in
April in Toronto, Toronto.
I recorded myself that a,

2506
02:12:06,081 --> 02:12:09,390
a couple of different places and I've
got an hour and 15 minutes a new shit.

2507
02:12:09,450 --> 02:12:14,310
So that's a enough where I can widdle
it down to what I want for like a 44

2508
02:12:14,311 --> 02:12:16,530
minute. What are you
playing music for? Prime.

2509
02:12:16,531 --> 02:12:19,440
We told you you can't play music unless
I made this song and you make a song.

2510
02:12:19,830 --> 02:12:23,180
You're so multitalented wait a minute.
You make newsletters and,

2511
02:12:23,250 --> 02:12:28,140
and you're a stalker and bang hot
chicks and you, you do set design.

2512
02:12:28,141 --> 02:12:30,930
And I hear you're doing standup
comedy when you perform it again,

2513
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:32,360
uh, tonight, uh,

2514
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:37,460
going to sounds and then big
fish and Glendale and I'm
hosting sales comedy club.

2515
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:40,100
If, unless I'm going with
you do a Florida the 30th.

2516
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:43,170
Yeah, that's, that's going to be the
shit. Do you want to come to Florida?

2517
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:47,550
It's up to you. Do, do you wanna I would
love to go to Florida. Itar like Florida.

2518
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:52,380
I love Florida. We'll hook it up. Um, so
third is my next story teller show. Yeah.

2519
02:12:52,381 --> 02:12:55,350
Where are these storytellers shows
that people can't see in San Francisco.

2520
02:12:55,351 --> 02:12:58,290
But you might be able to go right down
in the front at the purple and that are

2521
02:12:58,291 --> 02:13:01,810
sold out. I'm so glad about are
gone. That's one. It's called um, uh,

2522
02:13:01,890 --> 02:13:04,250
thicker than water. And when is this
all about families this weekend.

2523
02:13:04,290 --> 02:13:08,070
Friday and Saturday night. Yeah. And
then the next one is brain on drugs.

2524
02:13:08,071 --> 02:13:13,020
Just all drugstores nine. These are
both nice. Damn. These sounds good dude.

2525
02:13:13,021 --> 02:13:16,950
You sound really good. If people don't
know our has been doing this thing.

2526
02:13:16,951 --> 02:13:19,560
You've been doing it for about
a year now and it's really cool.

2527
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:23,880
And what it is is he does like
a standup show but it's not,

2528
02:13:23,881 --> 02:13:24,720
they don't talk about,

2529
02:13:24,721 --> 02:13:27,660
because they don't do like set
up punchline set up punchline.

2530
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:31,470
It's mostly like really funny stories
because a lot of sort of like,

2531
02:13:31,471 --> 02:13:35,340
you know like podcast stories. I've got a
lot of the, the funnier podcast stories,

2532
02:13:35,341 --> 02:13:38,400
you know, and Adam Carolla show or in
any of the other ones. It's like, it's,

2533
02:13:38,470 --> 02:13:40,080
they're not like a setup punchline.

2534
02:13:40,081 --> 02:13:43,380
It's can't like do home in front of
a comedy audience where they expect a

2535
02:13:43,381 --> 02:13:46,320
certain like rhythm but it's,
it can be slower.

2536
02:13:46,321 --> 02:13:48,120
It's more like Annie Hall
as a comedy where it's like,

2537
02:13:48,121 --> 02:13:51,730
it was good right now as huge
laugh, more involved, you know,

2538
02:13:52,010 --> 02:13:53,610
and you're going to see a comedy movie,
right?

2539
02:13:53,611 --> 02:13:56,790
If you're going to see a comedy movie,
it's not like always funny. Always funny.

2540
02:13:56,791 --> 02:13:58,440
Like they have to set up
a lot of what's funny.

2541
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:00,330
And it was like just a lot of
spots where there's, you know,

2542
02:14:00,331 --> 02:14:04,080
you're not laughing for 10 15 minutes
but on stage it's got to be set up.

2543
02:14:04,081 --> 02:14:07,460
Punchline, punchline, set up punchline.
But the what you're doing is like you,

2544
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:11,430
you're, you're making these guys, you're
giving them like a in a picture to venue.

2545
02:14:11,690 --> 02:14:14,430
Yeah.
Jellies were fucking spectacular man.

2546
02:14:14,490 --> 02:14:17,820
Your story of when you went to a strip
club in Alabama with, what's his name?

2547
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:22,770
Mark Coleman. Yeah. That's like a perfect
like crazy story. Yeah, that's a PR. Yeah.

2548
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:26,760
Yeah, there's exactly, I tried to do that
one for with comedy, like do it on stage,

2549
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,260
but I had to punch it up too much.

2550
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:32,000
I had to add a bunch of shit
to it and like shorter. Yeah.

2551
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:34,200
I added combined two different
scenarios for crushers.

2552
02:14:34,201 --> 02:14:36,600
Tells the best story of all time.
The Tracy Morgan style.

2553
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:39,210
He's supposed to come on tomorrow.
I got to, he lands today though.

2554
02:14:39,211 --> 02:14:42,980
I got a fucking good,
yeah, it's Tracy Morgan.

2555
02:14:42,981 --> 02:14:46,260
Is that the heart of a million
great stories. It's good to know.

2556
02:14:46,261 --> 02:14:47,520
There's dudes like that out there man.

2557
02:14:47,790 --> 02:14:50,370
When I see a guy like Joe Diaz
or a garlic, Tracy Morgan,

2558
02:14:50,610 --> 02:14:53,730
I just want to just shake their hand
and say thank you. Thank you for,

2559
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:57,410
thank you for rocking it.
Mason just going out there and realizing,

2560
02:14:57,420 --> 02:15:01,260
man ain't know, nobody knows how the
fuck this thing works. Just go crazy.

2561
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:05,190
You know, having a guy like Joe d as
in your life do well, do you wonders?

2562
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:09,210
You know? I think he's Comedians for
real. He's like having him around you,

2563
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:10,620
it like makes you funnier.

2564
02:15:10,650 --> 02:15:14,970
I really believe you're in a relaxed
when you kidnap someone. All right. Yeah.

2565
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:16,620
Not only that, he's just, he's show,

2566
02:15:16,621 --> 02:15:20,580
I don't give a fuck that he makes things
more Cheley and more fun. It just,

2567
02:15:20,581 --> 02:15:25,020
it's more fun. Like Joe, I
always tell Joey like whenever
every special I've done,

2568
02:15:25,050 --> 02:15:26,070
and this is one of the things that I,

2569
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:28,680
one of the reasons why I've thought
about not doing it in Toronto,

2570
02:15:28,681 --> 02:15:30,660
the number one reason
is I can't get Joey up.

2571
02:15:31,490 --> 02:15:34,980
Can't get up there with him
with aggravated kidnapping
and the Columbus that

2572
02:15:34,981 --> 02:15:36,690
places the bomb.
It was the bomb.

2573
02:15:36,691 --> 02:15:41,280
But what I'm trying to do is I'm trying
to do somewhere that I haven't done and

2574
02:15:41,281 --> 02:15:43,390
I really love Toronto. And uh, my,

2575
02:15:43,420 --> 02:15:47,460
my last show in Toronto sold out
like months in advance. It was crazy.

2576
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:50,940
Like I got so much love and Toronto and
if the show was so much fun, I was like,

2577
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:53,190
this would be a great place to do my shit.

2578
02:15:53,191 --> 02:15:55,980
And it's not like I've done it a bunch
of times where they've seen my material

2579
02:15:55,981 --> 02:16:00,010
over and over again. It's oversaturated
and you know, pretty much everything on,

2580
02:16:00,090 --> 02:16:00,450
I mean,

2581
02:16:00,450 --> 02:16:03,990
everything I'm doing in my sets these
days is all shit that wasn't on my old

2582
02:16:03,991 --> 02:16:07,530
stuff and saw all that stuff
has been phased out and
it's all straight new stuff.

2583
02:16:07,531 --> 02:16:10,100
So most people that I'm
running into on the road,

2584
02:16:10,110 --> 02:16:14,250
unless they get on youtube all the time,
they don't know the material. So to me,

2585
02:16:14,251 --> 02:16:17,260
Toronto is like the perfect spot. You
know, it's like they're, they're cool,

2586
02:16:17,261 --> 02:16:21,630
they're smart or enthusiastic. It's a fun
city. But I don't know if I could do it.

2587
02:16:21,810 --> 02:16:22,591
I'm going to have to find out.

2588
02:16:22,591 --> 02:16:25,650
We still haven't figured out if they get
the venue, you know, and then you know,

2589
02:16:25,651 --> 02:16:29,240
there's also a can't bring Joey. Oh yeah.
So I wonder if you can get them, eh,

2590
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:32,880
maybe, maybe not getting up there.
He, he told me he was going to do,

2591
02:16:32,890 --> 02:16:35,610
we had some gigs in my truck was
Joe Rogan was the one I'm gonna do.

2592
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:39,450
I'm flying to buffalo from Buffalo.
My friend Mikey statue. Yoni.

2593
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:42,640
He's going to fucking drive me up there.
He goes.

2594
02:16:42,730 --> 02:16:46,420
He's going to drop off some
heroin. Halfway on the web
is a drop by the bridge.

2595
02:16:46,421 --> 02:16:50,530
It's a perfect time. Yeah. He would
always have some fucking crazy plan.

2596
02:16:50,531 --> 02:16:53,740
He had some crazy plan to
sneak in to do gigs. Wow. Yeah.

2597
02:16:53,741 --> 02:16:56,570
He wasn't fucking around either. He was
dead serious and he would do it. He,

2598
02:16:56,630 --> 02:17:00,490
those crazy stories are
really, they're all fucking
happen. Yeah. They're all real.

2599
02:17:00,491 --> 02:17:02,830
They're all real. When you've hung
around with Joey, as long as we have,

2600
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:06,070
and still Joey to this day,
still completely unpredictable.

2601
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:09,880
Like he was supposed to do Brian
show last Sunday at south and gone.

2602
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:14,200
He just disappeared. It was watching
the mechanic earlier, the old one,

2603
02:17:14,201 --> 02:17:16,810
Charles Bronson,
Bronson,

2604
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:19,900
he's upset and new ones coming
out this fucking Jason Dayton.

2605
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:24,190
What the fuck's his name? Get the fuck
Outta here. Charles Bronson Cock sucker.

2606
02:17:24,250 --> 02:17:26,640
He's like angry or fuck you want man.

2607
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:31,030
And who was the dude that played Charles
Bronson's protege? I don't the real one.

2608
02:17:31,031 --> 02:17:35,220
Who's the, yeah, the famous guy
that became a really nutty, uh, he,

2609
02:17:35,230 --> 02:17:37,360
he became like the biggest
drunk in Hollywood.

2610
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:42,010
He was like super handsome and young
and devastating or no, no, no, no. He's,

2611
02:17:42,030 --> 02:17:42,280
you know,

2612
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:46,510
he's on celebrity rehab right now and
he's a source of awesome entertainment.

2613
02:17:46,511 --> 02:17:49,090
If you haven't been watching your work,
I don't remember the guy's name.

2614
02:17:49,091 --> 02:17:51,300
It's like a three word name hold on.
And the mechanic

2615
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:57,650
dog Ronson. That's the new ones
coming out real soon. Yeah.

2616
02:17:57,700 --> 02:18:02,350
That's just coming up. It's the Cap Jan
Michael, Vince is not ever hearing about,

2617
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:03,310
and he was like this,
you know,

2618
02:18:03,311 --> 02:18:07,540
this fucking studly looking all
American super handsome actor movie star

2619
02:18:07,541 --> 02:18:09,280
character. And he, um,

2620
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:13,690
he went and lost his fucking marbles
and became a huge drop just second right

2621
02:18:13,691 --> 02:18:14,610
there. Yeah, yeah.

2622
02:18:14,611 --> 02:18:17,320
I remember we've done these interviews
with them now and he's just a stuttering

2623
02:18:17,321 --> 02:18:20,750
fucking retard. I love
that. Isn't it weird math it

2624
02:18:22,270 --> 02:18:22,771
when you,

2625
02:18:22,771 --> 02:18:25,390
you know when you run into people like
at the store or something like that that

2626
02:18:25,391 --> 02:18:28,240
have hit the rocks to Kravitz
has gone completely down.

2627
02:18:28,300 --> 02:18:31,990
It's like he's burned out. What happened?
He's just like, it's like the, the drugs,

2628
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,050
whatever it just to something was
in his brain is fucked up. He just,

2629
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:37,930
he can't talk to me. A normal human
being and just fills you with sadness.

2630
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:41,050
Being around him. He's just like, you
can't carry a normal conversation.

2631
02:18:41,051 --> 02:18:44,710
He starts midway through a conversation.
You can't leave. He wasn't always like,

2632
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:47,260
no. I remember her like seven, eight
years ago. It was like a normal guy.

2633
02:18:47,261 --> 02:18:49,720
Normal little beaten down, but
still fall. It'll beaten down.

2634
02:18:49,721 --> 02:18:51,610
But I had some fun conversations with him.

2635
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:53,830
So friendly and nice and now it's like,
so what happened?

2636
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:57,280
I think the stuff caught up,
drugs or whatever he was doing,

2637
02:18:57,281 --> 02:18:59,230
that's my guess is it doesn't
get done eventually caught up.

2638
02:18:59,400 --> 02:19:01,210
I don't think it does anymore,
but I think it eventually,

2639
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:04,060
I don't know that many people that have
totally cooked their brain with drugs.

2640
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:05,313
Huh.

2641
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:07,660
Do you know how many people do you know
that have cooked their brand with drugs?

2642
02:19:08,140 --> 02:19:12,580
Do you know anybody? I know I know a
couple of you right now that, uh, yeah.

2643
02:19:12,850 --> 02:19:16,960
So how many people would you guess you
know that like, absolutely like started,

2644
02:19:16,961 --> 02:19:19,630
that's what I would guess
that they looked, they looked
like you had done that.

2645
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,800
Uh, at least one and two
and probably, I don't know,

2646
02:19:24,610 --> 02:19:26,560
there's probably another one, but I know
to have that could think of right now.

2647
02:19:26,590 --> 02:19:29,600
Did I have to tell you Brian Cowen
story about the girl who used to date,

2648
02:19:29,630 --> 02:19:30,770
listen to this shit up burned out.

2649
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:32,840
There was a girl that
Brian Count dated and uh,

2650
02:19:33,170 --> 02:19:37,790
she was Khorasan the moment I met
her, I go, dude, I go listen to me.

2651
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:42,530
I know you don't like to believe this.
I can smell crazy people. Okay, I go in,

2652
02:19:42,531 --> 02:19:46,940
this bitch stinks. This bitch is nuts.
Like all I is, meet her. I keep right.

2653
02:19:46,950 --> 02:19:50,030
It's ridiculous assumption on my part
just to be able to take this chance.

2654
02:19:50,270 --> 02:19:55,220
But all my spidey senses was like, Whoa,
what's going on here? Oh, she didn't say.

2655
02:19:55,221 --> 02:19:58,700
I said, uh, you know, hi, my
name's Joe. Nice to meet you.
And you know, she said Hi.

2656
02:19:58,701 --> 02:20:00,340
And she shook my hand
and he goes, no, no, no.

2657
02:20:00,350 --> 02:20:02,780
People get nervous when
they're around you. They've
seen you in fear factor. I go,

2658
02:20:02,781 --> 02:20:06,620
that is not nervousness. I go, this is
a crazy person. I'm telling you, Bro,

2659
02:20:06,621 --> 02:20:09,440
you're dating a crazy girl. It turned
out the whole time he was dating her,

2660
02:20:09,441 --> 02:20:12,620
he had no idea she was a meth addict,
like a severe metastatic.

2661
02:20:12,650 --> 02:20:16,080
And she also had like some boyfriend
who was like an ex boyfriend is still

2662
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:18,140
picture to while she was
living at Brian's playing,

2663
02:20:18,141 --> 02:20:21,590
she was like hooking up with this
guy to get math craziness. So anyway,

2664
02:20:21,740 --> 02:20:25,400
Brian gets rid of her long, drawn out,
tries to save her, can't do it. I mean,

2665
02:20:25,401 --> 02:20:27,080
just a devastating shit.
Him. He would always,

2666
02:20:27,081 --> 02:20:29,900
he would always get himself hooked
up with these really crazy bitches.

2667
02:20:29,990 --> 02:20:31,760
It's when I was, when I met
him, when he was really young,

2668
02:20:31,761 --> 02:20:35,330
he was like trying to fix himself
through fixing other people.

2669
02:20:35,570 --> 02:20:37,460
It was very strange.
He got over it.

2670
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:40,760
But the point is years
later he's walking by.

2671
02:20:40,761 --> 02:20:43,350
Remember that bar that Stan hope used
to go to the cat and the fiddle? Yeah.

2672
02:20:43,550 --> 02:20:47,500
You know, that's like a stripper or a
hooker walk right there. That's what,

2673
02:20:47,530 --> 02:20:50,230
what's his face? The English guy
got busted. What is his name? Grant.

2674
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:53,450
Hugh grant got busted down there. I
was there. He picked up a hooker there.

2675
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:58,400
It's grody. It's totally grody by the way.
That's my two year old's favorite word.

2676
02:20:58,490 --> 02:21:02,210
Grody grody. Anyway, um, uh,

2677
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:05,810
so he's a walking to the cat and the
fiddle and as he's walking there,

2678
02:21:05,811 --> 02:21:09,620
he sees a hooker come his way and
he stops and he realizes it's his ex

2679
02:21:09,621 --> 02:21:13,670
girlfriend. Oh. And she's got
scabs on her face and shit.

2680
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:18,140
They go get tested after. No, this is
years later and he looks at, it goes, uh,

2681
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:23,720
hey, how you doing? She goes,
I sounded like you can guess

2682
02:21:26,170 --> 02:21:29,790
that was my life and accepted
it all. They said, wow,

2683
02:21:29,791 --> 02:21:31,030
that's all they said to each other.
And he,

2684
02:21:31,031 --> 02:21:35,630
he went into the bar and it was just like,
why the fuck the girl lived with him.

2685
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:39,470
She lived with him, she was dating him
and now here she is with scabs. Anyway,

2686
02:21:39,471 --> 02:21:44,300
folks will be at Mandalay Bay, Mandalay
Bay theater, you worry forth. Um,

2687
02:21:44,390 --> 02:21:47,930
were we at, um, I want to be the
Ontario Improv tomorrow night.

2688
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:48,860
It might be sold out.

2689
02:21:48,861 --> 02:21:53,861
It's a Korean Chad's show and I'm a
storyteller shell third in the pink,

2690
02:21:55,611 --> 02:21:59,060
purple onion and fourth February, third
year in La. Oh, there's another one.

2691
02:21:59,061 --> 02:21:59,890
February 3rd,

2692
02:21:59,890 --> 02:22:03,670
Jeff Garlin and powerful is that the
Improv lab improv back of the room.

2693
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:07,820
They moved the regular room so it was
too big for that little fucking tiny ass.

2694
02:22:07,821 --> 02:22:11,240
But I'm doing my best to keep the
shows if $5, like I'm still trying to,

2695
02:22:11,241 --> 02:22:13,280
what are they trying to jack up the price.

2696
02:22:13,350 --> 02:22:16,310
What are they trying to make it 10
at least 10 tens not bad though.

2697
02:22:16,660 --> 02:22:19,970
It's reasonable. It's a
reasonable, reasonable, I think
that's all. It's all good.

2698
02:22:19,971 --> 02:22:21,740
They're good. They're very
entertaining shows. Yeah.

2699
02:22:21,890 --> 02:22:24,350
I liked the idea of keeping a cheap,
cause it's kind of experimental,

2700
02:22:24,351 --> 02:22:27,700
but it's a reasonable, I mean, they're
all very entertaining. It's well worth it.

2701
02:22:28,170 --> 02:22:31,490
Bert Kreischer. No burr Bill Burr a
boulevard. Yeah. Yeah. Bill bursal areas.

2702
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:35,760
He's got great stories too. Um, so
anyway, February 4th Mandalay Bay theater.

whole on Melrose all the time. Right?

the time, but I'm hosting Sunday the 30th.

2706
02:22:47,790 --> 02:22:49,260

I'm not doing that now.

2707
02:22:49,300 --> 02:22:51,560

02:23:13,910 --> 02:23:17,010
If you go on Joe rogan.net I
believe it has more information.

2716
02:23:17,020 --> 02:23:18,720
Are you going to have to use your brain?

2717
02:23:18,721 --> 02:23:22,290
And that's the only gay guy could get
in Australia. Cause these UFC things,

2718
02:23:22,291 --> 02:23:24,900
what happens is they book the
UFC like a couple of months out,

2719
02:23:24,901 --> 02:23:26,220
like three months out and say,
hey,

2720
02:23:26,221 --> 02:23:28,950
the UFC is going to be in Australia and
I immediately start looking for any more

2721
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:32,310
big. But the problem is a lot of
these banned like these venues,

2722
02:23:32,311 --> 02:23:35,640
they book up with bands like six,
seven months in advance. So yeah,

2723
02:23:35,690 --> 02:23:38,460
so most of our taken,
so this is the place that I had to go to.

2724
02:23:38,461 --> 02:23:41,290
It's kind of a little bit further out,
but my friends in Sydney, I apologize.

2725
02:23:41,291 --> 02:23:42,630
We're going to have a good time to Ari.
Yeah,

2726
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:45,420
we're going to fly over in
a fucking apartment. And
did you check out the plane?

2727
02:23:45,421 --> 02:23:49,920
We're going to really, oh, it's
the dopest shit ever. Quantis yeah,

2728
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:53,100
it's fucking bad ass dude. Look a
little apartment and he's going to be,

2729
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:56,850
we'll make videos. All right,
flashlight. All right. Dirty bitches.

2730
02:23:57,080 --> 02:24:00,450
If you go to Joe rogan.net,
you can get 15% off the flashlight,

2731
02:24:00,451 --> 02:24:03,420
click the link and enter in
the code name, Rogan. And uh,

2732
02:24:03,870 --> 02:24:06,930
are you still having used
one? Have, you know, you don't
want one, right? You scared.

2733
02:24:07,310 --> 02:24:09,010
Yeah, I'm scared. That's
exactly what it is to be honest.

2734
02:24:09,011 --> 02:24:10,800
It'd just be shooting loads
and thing all day and I'm like,

2735
02:24:10,801 --> 02:24:13,470
I don't need this in my life.
It's way better than beating off.

2736
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:15,370
That's what it should say
in quotes on the bottom.

2737
02:24:15,371 --> 02:24:19,170
But it's way better than
beating off it is works. Okay.

2738
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,610
That's the end of the show. Uh,
thank you very much Burt Christ.

2739
02:24:21,611 --> 02:24:24,860
You're supposed to be here tomorrow.
I haven't talked to him. Um,

2740
02:24:25,010 --> 02:24:28,140
you so hopefully we got it all.
I know he's traveling today.

2741
02:24:28,170 --> 02:24:31,110
Hopefully we got it all worked out,
but check Twitter and a,

2743
02:24:37,150 --> 02:24:39,970
This is your music. Yeah. What is it?
Don't make fun of. It's really good.

2744
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:43,570
Is it a song? Yeah, it's called VCR.
Okay. This list guys and the commercial.

2745
02:24:45,090 --> 02:24:48,760
Tell me, Yo, live at so bad,

2746
02:24:49,410 --> 02:24:53,120
which you would digest me.
Get Sas.

2747
02:24:59,240 --> 02:25:00,390
Do you need to go to a doctor?

2748
02:25:05,230 --> 02:25:06,440
Hey Ben,
it's bad.

2749
02:25:07,130 --> 02:25:10,710
Thanks to Jeff Banks who
needs medical science,

2750
02:25:10,711 --> 02:25:15,510
doc Ninja kick its ass.
Your razor still stu syrup.

2751
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:18,770
It still sucks.
It just fails miserably.

2752
02:25:18,771 --> 02:25:22,890
Gout Ninja kick its ass.
You get it.

2753
02:25:23,050 --> 02:25:24,610
You got a real problem,
dude.

2754
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:29,080
Where's that one you had that
one song you made with your xx.

2755
02:25:33,310 --> 02:25:34,660
Brian's terrifying

2756
02:25:38,070 --> 02:25:40,510
humanity has ever produced.
You have a worm in your brain.

2757
02:25:42,020 --> 02:25:45,310
Niches picked no ass southbound.

2758
02:25:45,350 --> 02:25:50,280
Celebrate job knowledge. A beats on honor.

2759
02:25:50,550 --> 02:25:53,480
T mobo kicked our ass that much too,

2760
02:25:56,410 --> 02:26:01,410
so I can drive back to 1985
don't need nothing fancy.

2761
02:26:02,590 --> 02:26:07,170
I won't go too far. I just need, I'm fine

2762
02:26:10,610 --> 02:26:14,650
to
row somewhere making this,

2763
02:26:14,820 --> 02:26:18,300
they're going to make this the features
on their myspace page. I got an answer.

2764
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:22,620
Call me. I'm story. Random words
in are fairly arriving ejaculators

2765
02:26:23,270 --> 02:26:26,840
it's called word salad. All
circuits are busy now. Right?

2766
02:26:26,850 --> 02:26:29,700
What does that song that you made with
your ex, can you make a song with your ex?

2767
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:32,370
Yeah. What's that one about? It was
kind of a good one. What was it?

2768
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:35,700
What was it about? Well, there's
the one that I'm punching the dog.

2769
02:26:35,790 --> 02:26:38,770
Is that what the one you're talking about
now? But it was good. It was fun. Uh Oh,

2770
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:43,500
Juno Ish. Juno Ish. Yeah. That's
actually just a remake of a song. Oh,

2771
02:26:43,501 --> 02:26:46,460
don't do that because you don't have
rights. But there was the other one.

2772
02:26:46,461 --> 02:26:48,720
The other ones, the punching the
dog was about punching my dog.

2773
02:26:50,030 --> 02:26:52,850
Do you think that's funny man?
Yeah.

2774
02:26:56,240 --> 02:27:00,080
I just, your dog a douchebag
and no, this was, uh, because

2775
02:27:00,890 --> 02:27:05,830
if the song was about, um, her dog, how
she asked her dogs, she's from Texas,

2776
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:09,790
I'm going to punch you. And I'm like,
you didn't say you're going to punch it.

2777
02:27:10,180 --> 02:27:13,210
So then I wrote this song and it was
a little dog too, right? I have a few.

2778
02:27:13,211 --> 02:27:14,550
Didn't really like punch it or anything.

2779
02:27:14,730 --> 02:27:17,850
Sometimes you have to punch
dogs. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

2780
02:27:17,870 --> 02:27:21,260
if they're trying to bite you,
punch him punching. Who's scared?

2781
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:28,130
Let the dog know. Biting me,
mother fucker be repercussions.

2782
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:31,340
You got punched in the face and you
get punched in the face that this is

2783
02:27:31,341 --> 02:27:34,820
actually a horse out and bite your hands
off. This is the punching. Go throw it.

2784
02:27:34,970 --> 02:27:37,850
Throw it. All right. You know, play. That
one is good or should we not play it?

2785
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:41,460
Maybe we should all not good.
They're all my stupid song right now.

2786
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:45,660
I don't want to leave people disappointed.
Okay, we're not going to work.

2787
02:27:45,730 --> 02:27:47,780
I wish I could've heard it. They're
going to think it's better than it was.

2788
02:27:48,080 --> 02:27:50,600
They're going to leave now thinking
that I missed out on something good.

2789
02:27:50,601 --> 02:27:53,240
Would reality folks,
is it shut off your iPhone?

2790
02:27:54,060 --> 02:27:54,893
Shut off.

2791
02:27:57,050 --> 02:27:59,140
Disconnect from use dreams.

2792
02:27:59,490 --> 02:28:04,490
Please don't listen to what we're doing
here right now for you to waste your

2793
02:28:06,571 --> 02:28:11,130
time. This is right. You craft
a rock clicking on the link.

2794
02:28:13,620 --> 02:28:16,950
Okay. Stop Tab. This is
worse than the other one.

2795
02:28:17,830 --> 02:28:19,840
This is where it pulled up,
man. Shut up. Please stop it

2796
02:28:20,410 --> 02:28:21,950
like a along with your own song.

2797
02:28:22,850 --> 02:28:27,490
This terrible bro like it. No. Well, I
could play the Jewish song. Nope. Nope.

2798
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:29,480
That's no copyright. That's actually
really good. They were good.

2799
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:31,370
That's really good. That's
it. That's a wrap, right?

2800
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:34,640
Because you have to show a very
nice, thank you for having me, sir.

2801

Thank you for being here, sir. This
was fun. Thanks for the ride, Brian.

2802
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:39,930
Thanks everybody. Fall our
ship. You're on Twitter. S h.

2803
02:28:39,931 --> 02:28:44,931
O.

2804
02:28:46,710 --> 02:28:49,400
F. F. I. R. A. R. I. S. H. A.
F. F. I. R. R is your fear and
red band. Red Ban, but Brian,

2805
02:28:49,401 --> 02:28:52,790

do you got? How many people you got now?

2806
02:28:53,300 --> 02:28:56,660
Like 11,000 or something like that.
11,000 people listening to your stuff.

2807
02:28:56,750 --> 02:29:01,700
You're happy with that man? No, I
need to beat the fucking sludge. Oh,

2808
02:29:01,750 --> 02:29:02,780

2809
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:07,370
21,000 how many did she
grow while she was with you?

2810
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:11,720
I don't know. How much is it responsible?
Are you responsible for sure.

2811
02:29:11,820 --> 02:29:15,220
Growth made it more popular thing.
I definitely got her some.

2812
02:29:15,450 --> 02:29:17,540
He ain't got it from the
Internet. People different. Yeah.

2813
02:29:17,690 --> 02:29:21,680
Different people with her animated gifs
of her fingering herself all over the

2814
02:29:21,681 --> 02:29:25,430
website. How weird is that when this
competition? Brilliant. How weird is that?

2815
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:28,480
Weird it ever went to
competition in this country.

2816
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:33,100
What you gotta do to start that over
with? Start showing my dick. Okay.

2817
02:29:33,350 --> 02:29:36,590
Always tell the, hey, that's the end of
the show folks. Thank you very much. Bye.

We love you bitches.

2819
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:45,540
Shut that fucking music off. Yeah. Yeah.
